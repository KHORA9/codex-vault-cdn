JOHN.\r\n\r\nI DEDICATE the following work to you, my dear Son, as a token of my\r\ngratitude for the cheerful patience with which you have aided me in\r\ncompleting it, despite the calamity that overtook me in the midst of my\r\nlabours. Whatever may be the fate of the publication it will always\r\nrecall to me some of the happiest hours of my life, rendered so chiefly\r\nby beholding the contented serenity with which you subdued the\r\nirksomeness of studies so little suited to your years. At length,\r\nhowever, you are delivered from lexicographers and scholiasts. The final\r\npage has been written, the last proof read. I escape from a task\r\ncommenced before you were born, and you from a four years’\r\napprenticeship to the craft and mystery of authorship. All that now\r\nremains is to watch the reception which the fruit of our toil may meet\r\nwith in the world. It has been produced and has grown up under very\r\npeculiar circumstances. Whithersoever we have travelled, the wrecks of\r\nGrecian literature have accompanied us, and the studies to which these\r\npages owe their existence have been pursued under the influence of\r\nalmost every climate in Europe. Nay, if I pushed my researches still\r\nfurther and visited the portion of Africa commonly supposed to have been\r\nthe cradle of Hellenic civilisation, it was solely in the hope of\r\nqualifying myself to speak with some degree of confidence on the subject\r\nof those arts which represent to the Modern World so much of the\r\ngrandeur and genius of Greece. Here, probably, the action of\r\npestilential winds, and of the sands and burning glare of the desert\r\ncommenced that dimming of the “visual ray,” which, in all likelihood,\r\nwill wrap me gradually in complete darkness, and veil for ever from my\r\nsight those forms of the beautiful which have been incarnated, if I may\r\nso speak, in marble. This is a language which neither you nor your\r\nsister can read to me. All that sweet Olympian brood which used to smile\r\nupon me with kindly recognition when I was a solitary wayfarer in lands\r\nnot my own, will, as far as I am concerned, be annihilated. Those twelve\r\nmystical transformations of Aphroditè into stone, which may be beheld\r\nall together at Naples, and appeared to me more lovely than its vaunted\r\nbay, or even the sky that hangs enamoured over it, will, I conjecture,\r\nbe seen of me no more, or seen obscurely as through a mist. Homer,\r\nhowever, and Æschylus, with Plato and Thucydides and Demosthenes, will\r\nbe able still through the voices of my children—voices more cheerful and\r\nwilling than ministered to the old age and blindness of Milton—to\r\nproject their beauty into my soul. I will not, therefore, repine; but,\r\nimitating the example of wiser and better men, submit unmurmuringly to\r\nthe will of God. Had things been otherwise ordered, I might have\r\ncontinued these researches. As it is, I take leave of them here. Our\r\nfriend, Mr. Keightley, who has visited Italy for the purpose, will\r\nperform for the Romans what I have endeavoured to accomplish for the\r\nGreeks; and his extensive and varied learning, the excellence of his\r\nmethod, and the pleasing vivacity of his style, will, probably, ensure\r\nfor his work a still greater degree of popularity even than that which\r\nhis very successful productions already enjoy.\r\n\r\n                               Believe me, my dear son,\r\n                                       Ever affectionately yours,\r\n                                                     J. A. ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n        London,\r\n  October 13th, 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany moral phenomena appear to baffle the sagacity of statesmen,\r\nbecause, confiding too implicitly in experience, they omit to widen the\r\nrange of their contemplation so as to embrace the whole circle of the\r\npeople’s existence whose fortunes and character they desire to\r\ncomprehend. To be successful in such an inquiry it is requisite to lay\r\nopen, as far as possible, the influence on that people of climate and\r\ngeographical position, to break through the husk and shell of customs,\r\nmanners, laws, religions, that we may come to the kernel of its moral\r\nnature, to that inner organization, intellectual and physical, of which\r\nthe external circumstances of its civil and political life are but so\r\nmany fluctuating symbols.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, however, even in the case of a contemporary nation,\r\namong whom we may behold in full activity all the material movements of\r\nsociety, is no easy task. But the difficulty must be very much\r\naugmented, when, in addition to the obstacles which necessarily under\r\nthe most favourable circumstances beset every avenue to a people’s inner\r\nlife, those are added arising out of the distance on the track of time\r\nat which the nation we are considering happens to stand, the scantiness\r\nand contradictory nature of the reports that reach us, and more,\r\nperhaps, than all, the atmosphere of prejudice through which we are apt\r\nto view whatever in any degree differs from our own manners and\r\ninstitutions. But this consideration, though it should bespeak\r\nindulgence for the unavoidable errors even of the most diligent\r\ninvestigator, can certainly be no reason for abstaining from all further\r\ninvestigation. For, notwithstanding the disadvantages under which we\r\nlabour, it is still possible to extract from the fragments remaining of\r\nancient literature materials for reconstructing something more than the\r\nskeleton of antiquity. We can invest the bones with sinews and muscles,\r\nclothe them with flesh and skin, spread over the whole colours that\r\nshall resemble life; and if we cannot steal from heaven celestial fire\r\nto kindle this image of surpassing beauty, that, at least, is the only\r\nthing which exceeds our power.\r\n\r\nIn saying this, I merely state my opinion of what is possible, not by\r\nany means what I conceive myself to have effected in the present work. I\r\nam but too sensible of how far the execution falls short of “the ample\r\nproposition that hope made,” when, many years ago, the idea suggested\r\nitself to me at that ardent and flattering season of life in which we\r\nare apt to imagine all things within our reach. But as\r\n\r\n                Every action that hath gone before\r\n                Whereof we have record, trial did draw\r\n                Bias, and thwart; not answering the aim\r\n                And that unbodied figure of the thought\r\n                That gave ’t surmised shape;\r\n\r\nso, no doubt, in my own case, the realisation will be found to be a very\r\nimperfect embodying of the ideal plan.\r\n\r\nFew subjects, however, abound more in interest or instruction than the\r\none I have here ventured to treat. The inquiry turns upon the\r\ninstitutions and moral condition of a people to whose fortunes history\r\naffords no parallel; of a people that, like the cloud no bigger than a\r\nman’s hand, which the servant of the prophet saw from the top of Carmel,\r\ncontained within itself the seeds of mightiest and most momentous\r\nevents. The Hellenes can never, in fact, by any but the uninformed be\r\nregarded in the same light as ordinary political communities. Their\r\npower, vast and astonishing for the age in which they flourished, arose\r\nentirely out of their national character and the spirit of their\r\ninstitutions. It was the power of intellect. They were in reality the\r\nsun and soul of the ancient world, and darted far into the darkness\r\naround them those vivifying rays which, reflected from land to land,\r\nhave since lighted up the world.\r\n\r\nAthens, the wisest and noblest of Grecian states,\r\n\r\n                                     Mother of arts\r\n                     And eloquence,\r\n\r\nwas the great preceptress of mankind. The spirit of her laws,\r\ntransmitted through those of Rome, still pervades the whole civilized\r\nworld. Her wisdom and her arts form, in all polished communities, a\r\nprincipal object of study; and to comprehend and to enjoy them is to be\r\na gentleman. Sallust, therefore, notwithstanding his genius and\r\nsagacity, took but a commonplace view of national greatness, when he\r\nconsidered that of Athens to be chiefly based on the splendour shed\r\naround her achievements by historians. Her triumphs, it is true, were\r\nnot effected by vast military masses, such as those which many barbarous\r\nnations in different ages have put in motion for the purpose of spoil or\r\nconquest. Athens built her glory on other foundations. She could not,\r\nindeed, lead countless armies into the field, but she knew how, with a\r\nlittle band, to defeat those who could. In the days of her freedom no\r\nhuman force could subdue her. To effect this, every man within the\r\nborders of Attica must have been exterminated; for so long as an\r\nAthenian was left, the indomitable spirit of democracy would have\r\nsurvived in him and sufficed to kindle up fresh contests.\r\n\r\nBut the energies of Athens, how great soever, did not, like those of\r\nmost other states, develope themselves chiefly in war. It is the\r\ncharacteristic of barbarians to destroy, but to create nothing. The\r\ndelight and glory of the people of Athens consisted, on the contrary, in\r\nthe exercise of creative power, in calling into existence new arts,\r\nfounding colonies, widening the circle of civilisation, covering the\r\nearth with beautiful structures, sacred and civil; in producing\r\npictures, statues, vases, and sculptured gems, of conception and\r\ndelicacy of workmanship inimitable. Wherever the Athenian set his foot,\r\nthe very earth appeared to grow more lovely beneath it. His genius\r\nbeautified whatever it touched. His imagination vivified everything. He\r\nspread a rich mythological colouring over land and sea. Gods, at his\r\nbidding, entered the antique oak, sported in the waters of brook and\r\nfountain, scattered themselves in joyous groups over the uplands and\r\nthrough the umbrageous valleys, and their voices and odoriferous breath\r\nmingled with every breeze that blew.\r\n\r\nIn the distant colonies whither he betook himself, when poverty had\r\nrelaxed the chain that bound him indissolubly to the Attic soil, a few\r\nyears saw a new diminutive Athens springing up. The Pnyx, the Odeion,\r\nthe Theatre of Bacchos, the Prytaneion, the Virgin’s Fane, rose on a\r\ndiminished scale around him, presenting an image, though faint, of his\r\nearlier home, the loveliest, undoubtedly, and, after Jerusalem, the most\r\nhallowed spot ever inhabited by man. Above all things, he was everywhere\r\ncareful to enjoy the blessings of his ancestral institutions, and\r\nlistened, as in the mother city, to those popular thunders which, thrice\r\nin every month, rolled from the bema over the assembled crowd,\r\ncommunicating pleasurable emotions to his mind, and rousing continually\r\nthe passion for freedom.\r\n\r\nIt were needless to dwell at any considerable length on the naval and\r\nmilitary achievements of the Athenians. The world is still full of the\r\nvictories of Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa, and the soil, drenched in\r\ndefence of liberty with Attic blood, is to this day sacred in the eyes\r\nof the most phlegmatic. I appeal in proof of this to every man’s daily\r\nexperience: for does not the bare mention of any spot where the great\r\nDemos triumphed or suffered some national calamity, make the blood bound\r\nmore rapidly and tingle in our veins? Even the grovelling and\r\nworldly-minded, who affect to consider nothing holy but Mammon, can have\r\nfire struck out of their cold natures by the spell of those glorious\r\nsyllables; for virtue, and valour, and that religious link which binds\r\nthe soul to the spot where a mother’s dust reposes, are found, and will\r\never be found, to kindle warm admiration in every heart. And never since\r\nsociety began did these great qualities develope themselves more visibly\r\nthan among the people of Athens. For this reason, who can visit\r\nSyracuse, or the shores of the Hellespont, or the site of Memphis’s\r\nWhite Castle, without experiencing as he gazes on the scene an\r\nelectrical thrill of mental anguish at the recollection of what Athenian\r\ncitizens more than two thousand years ago suffered there? Even\r\nThermopylæ, glorious as it is, scarcely stirs our nature so deeply as\r\nMarathon; for the coarser and more material genius and institutions of\r\nSparta, the nurse of those heroes who fell at the Gates of Hellas\r\ninspire less of that fervent admiration which the great actions and\r\ngreat men of Athens awaken in every cultivated mind.\r\n\r\nOf the political institutions which throughout Hellas influenced so\r\npowerfully the developement of the national character, it is not my\r\ndesign in the present volumes to speak. I confine myself entirely to the\r\nother causes which rendered the ancient Greeks what they were; reserving\r\nthe examination of their forms of government for a separate treatise.\r\nThe subject here discussed possesses sufficient interest of itself. It\r\nhas been my aim to open up as far as possible a prospect into the\r\ndomestic economy of a Grecian family, the arts, comforts, conveniences,\r\nregulations affecting the condition of private life, and those customs\r\nand manners which communicated a peculiar character and colour to the\r\ndaily intercourse of Greek citizens. For, in all my investigations about\r\nthe nature and causes of those ancient institutions which, during so\r\nmany ages constituted the glory and the happiness of the most highly\r\ngifted race known to history, I found my attention constantly directed\r\nto the circumstances of their private life, from which, as from a great\r\nfountain, all their public prosperity and grandeur seemed to spring.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the great sources of a nation’s happiness and power must always\r\nlie about the domestic hearth. There or nowhere are sown, and for many\r\nyears cherished by culture, all those virtues which bloom afterwards in\r\npublic, and form the best ornaments of the commonwealth. Men are\r\neverywhere exactly what their mothers make them. If these are slaves,\r\nnarrow-minded, ignorant, unhappy, those in their turn will be so also.\r\nThe domestic example, small and obscure though it be, will impress its\r\nimage on the state; since that which individually is base and little,\r\ncan never by congregating with neighbouring littleness, become great, or\r\nlead to those heroic efforts, those noble self-sacrifices, which elevate\r\nhuman nature to a sphere in which it appears to touch upon and partake\r\nsomething of the divine.\r\n\r\nBy minutely studying, as far as practicable, those small obscure\r\nsanctuaries of Greek civilisation—the private dwellings of Attica--I\r\nhoped to discover the secret of that moral alchemy by which were formed\r\n\r\n           Those dead, but sceptred sovereigns who still rule\r\n           Our spirits from their urns.\r\n\r\nIn these haunts, little familiar to our imagination, lay concealed the\r\ngerms of law, good government, philosophy, the arts, and whatever else\r\nhas tended to soften and render beautiful the human clay. That this was\r\nthe case is certain; why it should have been so, we may perhaps be\r\nunable satisfactorily to explain; but that is what we shall at least\r\nattempt in the present work, and for this purpose, it will at the first\r\nglance be apparent, that the most elaborate delineation of the political\r\ninstitutions of Athens must prove altogether insufficient. These were\r\nbut one among many powerful causes. The principal lay deeper in a\r\ncombination of numerous circumstances:—a peculiarly perfect and\r\nbeautiful physical organization; a mind fraught with enthusiasm, force,\r\nflexibility, and unrivalled quickness; a buoyancy of temper which no\r\ncalamity could long depress; consequent, probably, upon this, a strong\r\nreligious feeling ineradicably seated in the heart; an unerring\r\nperception of the beautiful in art and nature; and lastly, the enjoyment\r\nof a genial climate, and an atmosphere pure, brilliant, and full of\r\nsunshine as their minds.\r\n\r\nRaces of men, though not in precisely the same manner as individuals,\r\nyet exhibit, at particular periods of their history, a freshness, a\r\nvigour, a disinterestedness, like that of youth; and, because this state\r\nof feeling may more than once occur in the course of their career, they\r\nseem to spring, like Æson, out of convulsions and apparent dissolution\r\nto a state of perfect rejuvenescence. Calamity and suffering purify\r\nwhole communities as they do individuals. In the boiling and commotion\r\nof revolutions the impurities of the national character bubble upwards\r\nand are skimmed away by the iron hand of misfortune. These political\r\nconvulsions are, in fact, so many efforts of nature to expel some\r\ndisease lurking in the constitution, and which, though the race be\r\nimmortal, might, if suffered to remain in the frame, produce a lethargy\r\nworse than death. This truth we should bear constantly in mind; for\r\namong the characteristics of the Athenian constitution, not the least\r\nremarkable are the many efforts it made to right itself, and adapt its\r\nframework to the changing circumstances of the times.\r\n\r\nIn the present inquiry we must, as I have already said, discover, if we\r\ncan, how much Hellas owed to its climate, to its position on the globe,\r\nand to the physical organization of its inhabitants. It would be absurd\r\nto infer with some writers, that the influence of these circumstances is\r\nimaginary, because Greece seems to remain where it was of old, and the\r\nconstitution and temperament of the people to be likewise unchanged. But\r\nthis is not the case. Greece no longer occupies in the map of the world\r\nthe position it occupied in antiquity. It has been lifted out of the\r\ncentre of civilisation, to be cast upon its outskirts, or, which is the\r\nsame thing, civilisation has shifted its seat. Nor are the Greeks any\r\nlonger what they formerly were, though perhaps by a fortunate\r\ncombination of circumstances they might still be rendered so. At present\r\nthere is the same difference between them and their ancestors as between\r\na jar of Falernian, and an empty jar. The clay, indeed, is there,\r\nbeautifully moulded, and the purple hue of life is on the cheek; but\r\ntyranny from the battle of Cheronæa,\r\n\r\n                              “That dishonest victory\r\n                  Fatal to liberty!”\r\n\r\nuntil now has been draining out the soul. In the day when Hellas was\r\nitself its children walked in light, in the first beautiful light of the\r\nmorning, which long seemed to shine only upon them; and now, perhaps,\r\nafter the revolution of a cycle almost equal to the Great Year, they\r\nmay, probably, be approaching another dawn.\r\n\r\nComparing the several states of Greece together, it is customary to\r\nbestow the palm of energy and military valour upon the Spartans, who\r\nmade war their sole profession, and passed their lives as it were in the\r\ncamp from the cradle to the grave. But, in thus deciding, justice is\r\nscarcely done to the character of Athens; for, if the former excelled in\r\ndiscipline, to the latter belonged, indisputably, the superiority in\r\nnative courage. Trained or not trained they faced whatever enemy\r\npresented himself, and won at least as many laurels from Sparta, on the\r\nocean, as the Doric State, in all its wars, ever gathered on land. And,\r\nlastly, at Platæa, among which race, among Ionians or Dorians, was most\r\nactivity manifested? In whose ranks was found the greatest ardour to\r\nengage? Who bore the first brunt of the Median horse, and broke the\r\ndreaded shock of that vaunted Asiatic chivalry which the Barbarian hoped\r\nwould have trampled down with its innumerable hoofs the spirit of\r\nGrecian freedom? This was effected by the Athenians; by those gay and\r\nseemingly effeminate soldiers, who went forth from their beautiful city\r\ncurled, perfumed, clad in purple, as to the mimic combats of the\r\ntheatre. The spirit of their commonwealth, all splendour without and all\r\nenergy within, urged them to the field. Their cry at the approach of the\r\nking was “Freedom or honourable graves!”—such as their countrymen had\r\never been wont to repose in.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Athenians, under a free government, had learned what it was\r\nto live—had imbibed from their education the feeling, that if deprived\r\nof such a government, if reduced to bow beneath the yoke of despotism,\r\nto die, if the Apostle’s words may without blame be thus applied, would\r\nbe gain. It will readily be conceived that the citizens of such a state\r\nfelt an impassioned attachment to their country,—an attachment\r\nunintelligible to persons living under any other form of civil polity.\r\nAthens was the cradle of their freedom and their happiness. There was a\r\nreligion in the love they bore it; they had, according to mythical\r\ntraditions, which they believed, sprung on that spot from the bosom of\r\nthe earth. It stood, therefore to them in the dearest of all relations,\r\nbeing, to sum up everything holy in one word,—their MOTHER; and they\r\nembodied their profound veneration for the sacred spot in every fond,\r\nevery endearing, epithet their matchless language could supply. Even the\r\ngods, in their patriotic partiality, were believed to look on Athens as\r\nthe most lovely, no less than the most glorious city on the broad\r\nearth,—an idea which they expressed by representing Poseidon and Athena\r\ncontending for the honour of becoming their tutelar divinity.\r\n\r\nTo persons so thinking no calamity short of the entire extinction of\r\ntheir race could appear so intolerable as beholding that sacred city,\r\nwith the tombs of their ancestors, the sanctuaries of their gods, the\r\nvenerable but immoveable symbols of their faith and mythological\r\nhistory, delivered over to be trodden down or obliterated with sword and\r\nfire by barbarian slaves, strong only from their countless numbers. Yet\r\neven to this did the love of freedom reconcile the Athenian people. They\r\nabandoned their holy place, and, embarking on board the fleet with their\r\nwives and children, took refuge in Trœzen and Salamis. History has\r\ndescribed in touching language the circumstances of this event, than\r\nwhich it has nothing more pathetic to record save, peradventure, the\r\ncarrying away of Judea and her children into captivity. I will not\r\ndisturb its archaic simplicity. No eloquence could heighten its effect.\r\nIt goes at once to the heart and rouses our noblest sympathies. “The\r\nembarkation of the people of Athens was a very affecting scene. What\r\npity, what admiration of the firmness of those men who, sending their\r\nparents and families to a distant place, unmoved with their cries and\r\nembraces, had the fortitude to leave the city and embark for Salamis!\r\nWhat greatly heightened the distress was the number of citizens whom, on\r\naccount of their extreme old age, they were forced to leave behind. And\r\nsome emotions of tenderness were due even to the tame domestic animals\r\nwhich, running to the shore with lamentable howlings, expressed their\r\naffection and regret for the persons by whom they had been fed. One of\r\nthese, a dog belonging to Xanthippos, the father of Pericles, unwilling\r\nto be left, is said to have leaped into the sea and to have swam by the\r\nside of the galley till it reached Salamis, where, quite spent with\r\ntoil, it immediately died. And they show, to this day, a place called\r\nCynossema—‘the dog’s grave’—where they tell us it was buried.”[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Plutarch, Life of Themistocles, in Langhorne’s plain and vigorous\r\n  translation.\r\n\r\nThe Athenian people, on this and similar occasions, were enabled to\r\nresolve and perform boldly from the generous spirit inspired by their\r\nnational system of education. Their institutions, also, were eminently\r\ncalculated to bring into play the energies of every individual citizen,\r\nand to diffuse in consequence through the whole community a grandeur of\r\nsentiment and an heroic enthusiasm peculiar to free states. At Athens\r\nwhoever possessed the means of serving his country could easily,\r\nwhatever might be his rank, make those means known, and bring them into\r\noperation. If he were virtuous his virtue was remarked and placed him on\r\nthe road to promotion. If genius constituted his title to distinction,\r\nif nature had gifted him with the power to serve the state, the state,\r\nwithout inquiry whether he were poor or rich, readily availed itself of\r\nhis capacity, rewarded him during his life with political honours and\r\nauthority, and, after his death, with imperishable glory. If in war he\r\nperformed any act of superior conduct or courage, a general’s name was\r\nhis reward; if he received wounds that name, or the hope of it, healed\r\nthem; if in the achieving of any heroic deed he perished, his country,\r\nhe knew, would honour his ashes, watch over his memory, and, with words\r\npowerfully soothing because embodying a nation’s sympathy, dry up the\r\ntears of his parents and beloved children. He knew that his glory,\r\nheightened by matchless masters of eloquence, would flash like lightning\r\nfrom the bema; that lovely bosoms would beat high at his name; that\r\nhands, the fairest in Greece, would yearly wreath his tomb with\r\ngarlands; and that tears would be shed for ever on the spot by the\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\nIf children remained behind him, the state would become their parent;\r\nevery Athenian would share with them his salt; would impart to them\r\ntheir best inheritance—the feeling of patriotism and an inextinguishable\r\nhatred of tyranny; would repeat to them with unenvious pride the eulogy\r\nof their father, and point daily to the laurels which kept his grave\r\never green. The Athenian was taught, from the cradle, to consider death\r\nbeautiful when met on the red battle-field in defence of his home. And,\r\naccording to the creed of his country, he believed that his spirit would\r\nin such an event be numbered among the objects of public worship. Hence\r\nthe sublimity, the thrilling power of that oath in Demosthenes, who, in\r\nswearing by the souls of those that fell at Marathon, accomplished their\r\napotheosis and placed them among the gods of Athens.\r\n\r\nThat such were the habitual feelings of this most gallant and\r\ngenerous-minded people appears even from the admission of their\r\nbitterest enemies. “They,” observe, in Thucydides, the Corinthian\r\nambassadors, when urging Sparta into the Peloponnesian war,—\"they push\r\nvictory to the utmost, and are least of all men dejected by defeat;\r\nexposing their bodies for their country as if they had no interest in\r\nthem, yet applying their minds in the public service as if that and\r\ntheir private interest were one. Disappointment of a proposed\r\nacquisition they consider as a loss of what already belonged to them;\r\nsuccess in any pursuit they esteem only as a step towards farther\r\nadvantages; and, defeated in any attempt, they turn immediately to some\r\nnew project by which to make themselves amends: insomuch, that, through\r\ntheir celerity in executing whatever they propose, they seem to have the\r\npeculiar faculty of at the same time hoping and possessing. Thus they\r\ncontinue ever amid labours and dangers, enjoying nothing through\r\nsedulity to acquire; esteeming that only a time of festival in which\r\nthey are prosecuting their projects; and holding rest as a greater evil\r\nthan the most laborious business. To sum up their character, it may be\r\ntruly said, that they were born neither to enjoy quiet themselves, nor\r\nto suffer others to enjoy it.\"[2]\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Mitford, History of Greece, iii. 53.\r\n\r\nThe feeling that what they fought for was their own, which accounts for\r\nthe heroism of Hellenic armies, likewise led, particularly at Athens, to\r\nthe beautifying and adorning of the city, and the perfection of public\r\ntaste. The people saw among them no palaces devoted to the private\r\nluxuries of a despotic court, where persons maintained at the public\r\nexpense learn to look with contempt on the honest hands that support\r\nthem. There, whatever was magnificent belonged to the people at large,\r\nno private individuals, during the best ages of the commonwealth,\r\npresuming, how great soever might be their talents or their influence,\r\nto arrogate to themselves more than can be due to individuals, or to\r\nenshrine their perishable bodies in buildings suited only to the worship\r\nof God. Yet, in genuine grandeur, no monarch, with the wealth of half a\r\nworld at the disposal of his caprice, ever rivalled the Athenian people.\r\nTrue taste, the genuine sense of the beautiful and the sublime, will,\r\nwhile the world endures, refuse to be the subject of a tyrant, or to\r\ninhabit the same city with him; because no patronage, pensions, or\r\nlavish expenditure, can create in one state of society what belongs to\r\nanother; and pure taste being nothing more than the cultivated popular\r\nfeeling spontaneously expanding, can nowhere exist but in a free state.\r\nA prince may, doubtless, know what pleases him; but the people only can\r\ntell what pleases the people, which nothing certainly will unless it be\r\nproduced expressly for them, without the slightest reference to any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\nSuch, in the best periods of Grecian history, were the Athenians. Among\r\nthem Nature generally was allowed to make herself heard; from the cradle\r\nupwards it was their guide. A pure religion they had not, or pure\r\nmorality. Far from it; they barely caught indistinct glimpses of what in\r\nfaith and practice is true and beautiful. Nor could it be otherwise; for\r\nthe sun had not then risen, and men but felt their way uncertainly and\r\ntimidly amid the obscurities of the dawn. Nevertheless, the light\r\nvouchsafed them they did not spurn. According to the best notions then\r\nprevailing, they were of all men the most pious; and though of this\r\npiety much, nay, the greater part, was superstition, yet, doubtless,\r\nGod, according to the saying of the Apostle, accounted it unto them for\r\nrighteousness, that, having not the law, they were a law unto\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans, on the other hand, were mere monastic soldiers, brave,\r\nindeed, and true as their swords, but ungifted with those loftier and\r\nmore exquisite sympathies which properly constitute the beauty of human\r\ncharacter, and are alone the parents of love. Few, perhaps, were all\r\nthings within their reach, would choose to be citizens of Sparta; while\r\nno one, for whom the poetry of life has any charms, would hesitate,\r\nafter his own country, perhaps, to select Athens for his home. And that\r\nthis is no scholastic fancy created by literary preferences is clear\r\nfrom the practice of antiquity. Every man possessing superior genius,\r\nwhether sprung from Ionic or Doric race, betook himself to Athens, as to\r\nthe Greece of Greece—the common country of letters, sciences, and arts.\r\nThither, too, as now to London, fled the oppressed and persecuted of all\r\nlands, and there they found welcome and encouragement. It was the great\r\nasylum, the common city of refuge to all men. Strangers who could be\r\ncontent with hospitality and generous protection were never driven from\r\nthence. There every man might live as he pleased, think as he pleased,\r\nand utter freely what he thought. The recorded instances of persecution\r\nare barely sufficiently numerous to serve as exceptions to the general\r\nrule; and in Gorgias of Leontium, Polos, Protagoras, Prodicos, Hippias,\r\n“and what the Cynic impudence uttered,” we discover to how great an\r\nextent the spirit of toleration was carried at Athens. It would be\r\nabsurd to object the examples of Anaxagoras, Aspasia, and Socrates; for\r\nthese were merely instances of the rage of party spirit, from which,\r\nwhile men continue men, no state will ever be free, and can no more be\r\nimputed to the Athenian people, or to the spirit of their government,\r\nthan the execution of Sir Thomas More, or Cranmer, or Fisher, can be\r\nlaid to the charge of the English Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n                          OF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n                                BOOK I.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                          PAGE\r\n\r\n       I.

But the signification of this term was not fixed, being\r\nsometimes confined to Greece Proper, at others, comprehending likewise\r\nthe possessions of the Hellenes in Asia; that is, Hellas within and\r\nbeyond the Ægæan, as we now say, India within and beyond the Ganges.[3]\r\nThe progress of the name seems to have been as follows: it designated,\r\noriginally,[4] a city of Thessaly, built by Hellen son of Deucalion;\r\nnext, Phthiotis; the whole of Thessaly; all Greece, with the exception\r\nsometimes of Peloponnesos, sometimes of Macedonia, sometimes,—which is\r\nvery remarkable,—of Thessaly itself; sometimes of Epeiros; then all\r\nGreece within the Ægæan; afterwards all countries inhabited by Greeks in\r\nwhatever part of the world; and, lastly, it would appear to have been\r\noccasionally employed to signify Athens alone.[5] The most ancient name,\r\nPelasgia, sprang from the race who first, perhaps, peopled that part of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Paus. v. 21. 10.

Zeun. i. 1.\r\n\r\nNearly all writers who treat of Grecian history or antiquities, have\r\nventured more or less upon inquiries respecting the original inhabitants\r\nof the country, some contending that it was peopled by many independent\r\nraces, while others content themselves with supposing one primary stock.\r\nTo arrive at certainty in such investigations is scarcely to be hoped\r\nfor, since, over the whole field, facts have moved in so close a\r\nconjunction with fables, “that the most which remaineth to be seen, is\r\nthe show of dark and obscure steps where some part of the truth hath\r\ngone.”[6] It appears, however, to be a fact established, that the\r\nHellenes were not the first who occupied Greece. They were preceded by a\r\nnumber of tribes all apparently of Pelasgian origin. But who and what\r\nthe Pelasgians were, how and whence they came into the country, and by\r\nwhat gradations and influences they were ripened into Hellenes, or were\r\nby these expelled from the land, are questions to which no satisfactory\r\nanswers have ever been given, but must still be discussed whatever the\r\nresult of the investigation may be.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Hooker, Ecc. Pol. i. p. 95.\r\n\r\nEven the name of this people has opened up an endless labyrinth of\r\nconjecture, at least among the moderns, for the ancients when such\r\npoints were to be cleared up, easily removed the difficulty by inventing\r\na hero or a demigod, with an appellation exactly suited to their\r\npurpose. Thus from Hellen they derived the name of the Hellenes, from\r\nHeracles that of Heracleidæ, from Ion that of the Ionians, and from\r\nPelasgos, the son sometimes of Zeus, sometimes of Poseidon, sometimes of\r\nTriops or Inachos or Lycaon or Palachthon or of the earth itself,[7]\r\nthat of the Pelasgi. An Attic writer, familiar with this question, and\r\nhinting at a part of the theory which I have adopted, imagines the name\r\nof Pelasgi to have been at first bestowed on the race because they\r\nusually made their appearance on the shores of Hellas like migratory\r\nbirds in spring.[8] But though conjecture in such matters may amuse, it\r\nis not likely, at this distance of time, to lead to truth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Paus. viii. 1. 6; ii. 14. 4; 22. 1.

Siebel. p. 14.\r\n\r\nThe ancients had evidently formed no theory as to whence the Pelasgi\r\ncame, but were satisfied with the notion of their autochthoneïty,[9]\r\nwhich we cannot adopt. It must be acknowledged, however, that we are\r\nlittle able to trace them with certainty beyond the limits of Greece,\r\nbefore their arrival in that country. My own opinion is, that when the\r\nmigrations began from that vast and lofty table land of Central Asia,\r\nwhich formed the primitive abode of mankind, and where the mother\r\nlanguage of the Sanskrit, the Greek, and many other dialects was first\r\nspoken, the illustrious race, afterwards known under the name of\r\nPelasgi, moved westward by the Caspian, along the Caucasian range,\r\nthrough Armenia and Kourdistân, until they descended into the plains of\r\nAsia Minor. Here we seem to touch upon the obscurest verge of Grecian\r\nfable, for the tradition which sent Argo to Colchis, at the Eastern\r\nextremity of the Black Sea, evidently contemplated the people of the\r\nland as a kindred race, of similar faith, character, and manners. By\r\nwhat precise channel the stream of population rolled westward, cannot be\r\ndetermined: but here and there, on the southern shores of the Euxine, we\r\ndiscover some obscure footsteps of the parents of the Greeks, as they\r\ncontinued their journeyings towards the land which they were afterwards\r\nto encircle with glory. Moving through Pontos, Paphlagonia, and\r\nBithynia, they appear everywhere to have made settlements on the coast,\r\nuntil they reached the narrow stream of the Bosporos, over which they\r\nthrew themselves into Europe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Marsh. Chron. Sec. ix. p. 130.\r\n\r\nUp to this point we have little whereon to build our conclusions, save\r\nwhat is supplied by the general theory of ancient migrations, and what\r\nappear to be facts dimly seen within the extreme orbit of mythology. The\r\nancients themselves seem to have obtained some uncertain glimpses of\r\nlinks connecting their ancestors with Asiatic Scythia, for there were\r\nthose among them who represented the Caucons of Paphlagonia stretching\r\nalong the banks of the Parthenios, and between the Maryandinians and the\r\nsea, as a nation of Scythian origin. Now the Caucons were undoubtedly\r\nPelasgians, as were the Phrygians, the Carians, and the Leleges, who,\r\nunited by the ties of blood, flocked to the defence of Troy.[10] In a\r\nmuch remoter age, the heroes of the traditional Argo were, it is said,\r\nconfounded by night at Cyzicos,[11] in Mysia, with the warlike Pelasgi,\r\neven then masters of the sea, and accustomed with their galleys to vex\r\nthe coast and plunder the settled inhabitants. I regard the working of\r\nthe gold and silver mines on the southern shores of the Euxine, anterior\r\nto the Trojan war, as another proof of the settlement of the Pelasgi in\r\nthat part of Asia Minor;[12] and who but they, at a period beyond the\r\nreach of tradition, could have opened those gold mines on the shores of\r\nThrace, which on his conquest of the country Philip of Macedon found to\r\nhave been long ago worked and abandoned by some unknown people?[13]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Strab. viii. 3. p. 127.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Apollod. i. 9. 18. The mythology describes the Pelasgi as driven out\r\n  of Thessaly by the Æolians, and, under the guidance of Cyzicos, taking\r\n  possession of the peninsula of that name previous to the Argonautic\r\n  expedition. They fought with the Argonauts, and were afterwards\r\n  expelled by the Tyrrhenians, who in their turn were driven out by the\r\n  Milesians. Phot. Bib. p. 139. a. 25.

The\r\nThracians themselves were of Pelasgian origin. Thracians inhabited both\r\nsides of the Bosporos; traces of Pelasgian settlements and Pelasgian\r\nnames are likewise found on both sides. The stream of knowledge\r\nunquestionably poured through Thrace into Greece; and it is highly\r\nprobable that the stream of population had, at a remoter period, flowed\r\nin the same channel. Once in Macedonia, the adventurers would be tempted\r\nsouthward by the beauty of the climate and country; so that while some\r\nmoved up the valley of the Haliacmon, others, perhaps, took possession\r\nof the ridge of Olympos, Ossa and Pelion, where they were known under\r\nthe names of Centaurs and Lapithæ.[14] From these lofty ridges they\r\nlooked down upon the great lake which in those ages covered the whole\r\nplain of Thessaly, and, following the ramifications of the mountains,\r\npeopled Pelasgian Argos, Phthiotis, and the roots of Œta, while the\r\nlowlands were still under water: thence, too, they crossed over into\r\nEubœa, where they assumed the names of Macrones[15] and Curetes. This\r\nlatter tribe settling at Chalcis,[16] and having been worsted in a\r\ncontest for the Lalantian plain, fled across the Euripos, and traversing\r\nthe whole of Bœotia, founded a new settlement about Pleuron in Ætolia,\r\nand gave the name of Curetis to the whole country. Hence, also, in\r\nprocess of time, they were driven by the Ætolians from Pisa in Elis,\r\nupon which they took refuge in Acarnania.[17]\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Λέλεγας γάρ φασι πρότερον αὐτοὺς προσαγωρευομένους, διὰ τὸ ἀποκεντῆσαι\r\n  τοὺς ἵππους προσαγορευθῆναι Ἱπποκενταύρους.

Following that stream upwards towards its source, they found\r\nthemselves in Epeiros, a land abounding with water brooks, with lovely\r\nmountains, and lovelier valleys, and at length settled, and erected\r\nthemselves lasting habitations in the sacred neighbourhood of\r\nDodona,[18] where the first oracle known to the Hellenes flourished\r\nunder the protection of the Pelasgian Zeus.[19]\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Strab. vii. 7. p. 124. seq.

Nevertheless, it rests in part on facts which\r\nan historian ought not to reject. For example, though it be nowhere,\r\nperhaps, distinctly stated that the Thracians were entirely of Pelasgian\r\norigin, we are compelled by various circumstances to believe that such\r\nwas the case: first, Samothrace on the coast was undoubtedly peopled by\r\nPelasgi;[20] secondly, the Macedonians, plainly of the same stock with\r\nthe Thracians, are acknowledged to have been Pelasgi;[21] and since the\r\nIllyrians likewise were a kindred people,[22] we have a line of\r\nPelasgian settlements stretching along the whole northern frontier of\r\nGreece, the Ægæan, the Hellespont, and the Propontis, from the Adriatic\r\nto the Black Sea. The chain of proofs, indeed, is not complete, but\r\nappears and disappears alternately, like the stream of the Alpheios,\r\nthough little doubt can be entertained of the existence of the links\r\nwhich happen to lie out of sight. In nearly every part of Macedonia the\r\nfootsteps of the Pelasgi are clearly discernible; at Crestona,[23] on\r\nthe Echidoros in Pœonia; in Emathea, and Bottiœa;[24] and looking at the\r\nlanguage of the country, we find it at all times to have been identical\r\nwith that of Greece. That the same thing must be predicated of Thrace,\r\neven in the remotest ages, appears indisputably from this, that her\r\nbards, Thamyris and Orpheus traversed the whole of Hellas, and sang\r\ntheir wisdom to its inhabitants; while Olen coming from Lycia, a\r\nPelasgian settlement,[25] likewise brought his kindred songs to the same\r\ntolerant and hospitable land.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Justin. vii. 1.

Wesseling.\r\n\r\nBut to follow the movements of the Pelasgi through Greece itself, where,\r\nthough no chronology of events can be attempted, our views rest on a\r\nstable foundation. Much, however, of our reasoning will be confused or\r\nperhaps unintelligible, if it be not borne in mind that the name of the\r\nPelasgi, like that of the Tartars or Arabs, was a general appellation\r\napplied to the whole race, while the several tribes bore separate\r\ndenominations; as the Chaones,[26] the Dryopes, the Leleges, the\r\nCaucons, the Cranaans, with many others,[27] precisely as among the\r\nArabs, we find the Ababde, the Mahazi, the Beni Sakker, &c. The\r\nPelasgian tribe which first made its appearance, and became powerful in\r\nEpeiros, a country not to be separated from Greece, was that of the\r\nChaones, whose chief seat was Cheimera,[28] at the foot of the Ceraunian\r\nmountains. An obscure scholiast, indeed, denominates them\r\nbarbarians;[29] but as from the best authority we know them to have been\r\nPelasgi, this shows the value of the term in the mouth of the later\r\nwriters. Another class,—the Levites, perhaps, of those primitive\r\npeople,—settled amid the oak forests which surrounded the lovely lake of\r\nDodona, where under the name of Selli,[30] they founded the most\r\ncelebrated oracle of early antiquity. In their habits they remind us of\r\nthe Sanyasis, and other religious anchorites of India, living from views\r\nof penance with unwashed feet, and sleeping on the bare ground. Other\r\ntribes renowned of old in Epeiros, and all Pelasgian,[31] were the\r\nThesprotians, the Molossians, the Perrhæbians, and the Dolopians, the\r\nlast rough mountaineers inhabiting both the eastern and western slopes\r\nof Pindos.[32]\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Steph.

This happened, we\r\nare told, while one Pelasigos[33] reigned over the mountaineers in the\r\ndistrict of Hæmonia. They were celebrating a great feast, when a certain\r\nslave named Peloros, brought them tidings of what had come to pass,\r\nspeaking with admiration of the vast plains which were appearing through\r\nthe ebbing waters. In gratitude for the news he communicated, they\r\ncaused the man to seat himself at table while both the king and his\r\nattendants, in the joy and fulness of their hearts ministered to him.\r\nThis, it is said, was the origin of the Pelorian festival, afterwards,\r\ndown to a very late period, celebrated with great pomp and magnificence\r\nin Thessaly, where, for the day, masters changed condition with their\r\nslaves, and became their servants.[34] The same festival in the\r\nPelasgian settlements of Italy was known down to the latest times, under\r\nthe name of Saturnalia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Palmer.

Hal. i. 3. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 45.\r\n\r\nOn the interior of Thessaly becoming thus habitable, the Pelasgian\r\ntribes of Epeiros, beginning to be straitened for room, and feeling\r\nstill the original wandering impulse, poured over the heights of Pindos\r\ninto the valleys of Histiæotis, and moved eastward along the foot of the\r\nCambunian mountains, settling every where as they advanced. The tribe\r\nwhich took this direction bore the name of Perrhæbians, and left traces\r\nof their movements in the great Perrhæbian forest, stretching to the\r\nfoot of Olympos, and in the name of the whole district extending from\r\nthe Peneios to the northern limits of Thessaly. In this rich and fertile\r\ntract they became powerful, spreading their dominion along the banks of\r\nthe Peneios, quite down to the sea. But the Lapithæ rising into\r\nconsequence and overcoming the Perrhæbians in battle, reduced a portion\r\nof the tribes under their yoke, while the remainder, enamoured of\r\nindependence, retreated inland, again crossed the Pindos, and\r\nestablished themselves in the upper valley of the Acheloös. About the\r\nsame time, perhaps, a fragment of this tribe traversing the whole of\r\nThessaly crossed over into Eubœa, where they subdued and took possession\r\nof Histiæotis. It was possibly the entrance of these adventurers into\r\nthe island, pushing fresh waves of population southward, that caused the\r\ncontest for the Lalantian plain, and the emigration of the Curetes to\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nOther Pelasgian tribes established themselves, and became illustrious in\r\nThessaly. The Centaurs, for example, a Lelegian clan inhabiting Mount\r\nPelion, where they were, perhaps, the first tamers of the horse, whence\r\nthe fable of their double form. Other sections of the Leleges were also\r\nfound in Thessaly,[35] as were also the Dryopes. In this country,[36]\r\nnotwithstanding that it must be regarded upon the whole as only the\r\nsecond stage of the Pelasgians in their migrations southward, we find\r\nmore traces of their power and influence than anywhere else in Northern\r\nGreece. Here were two cities, called Larissa; here was Pelasgian\r\nArgos;[37] here, too, was a great district known by the name of\r\nPelasgiotis, while that of Pelasgia seems to have preceded Thessaly as\r\nthe appellation of the whole province.[38] This people, like most\r\nothers, seem to have had a number of names, to which they were\r\npeculiarly attached, which we nearly always find reappearing wherever\r\nthey formed a settlement. Generally, too, it may be regarded as certain\r\nthat the more northern were the most ancient: thus we find Pelagonia in\r\nthe kingdom of Macedon and in Thessaly; Larissa[39] on the Peneios;\r\nLarissa Cremaste near the shore. The Dryopes,[40] again, appear first in\r\nEpeiros, not far from Dodona; next we find them in Thessaly, then in\r\nDoris, finally in Peloponnesos; and Strabo is careful to remark that the\r\nlast-mentioned were an off-shoot from those in the north.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Serv. ad.

Rhod. i.\r\n  1218,) who was himself the son of Pelasgos.—Suid. _v._ Λυκ. Cf. Etym.\r\n  Mag. 154, 7. 288, 32. Paus. viii. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nFrom Thessaly the tide of population rolled southward;[41] different\r\ntribes of Pelasgi, under the name of Leleges, Hyantes, Aones, and\r\nDryopes taking possession of the mountains and valleys of Doris, Locris,\r\nPhocis, and extending their migrations into the plains of Bœotia. From\r\nthence, across the isthmus, some few straggling hordes appear to have\r\nfound their way into Peloponnesos, where, as shepherds, they gradually\r\ndiffused themselves over its rich plains. All the Pelasgi in fact appear\r\nlike the Arabs and Tartars to have been originally Nomades, different\r\ntribes of whom, as they were tempted by the beauty of particular\r\nregions, quitted their wandering life, as the Arabs have done in Egypt,\r\nYemen, and elsewhere, and from shepherds became husbandmen. In process\r\nof time, the descendants of the settlers, accustomed to the easy and\r\nluxurious life of cities, learned to look back upon their wandering\r\nancestors as a wretched and a barbarous race. Indeed, they sometimes\r\nspeak of them[42] after their arrival in Peloponnesos as cannibals,\r\nnaked, houseless, ignorant of the use of fire, on a level, in short,\r\nwith the fiercest and most brutal savages existing in the islands of the\r\nPacific. But these erroneous ideas evidently arose from the theory of\r\nautochthoneïty which supposes man to have gradually ripened out of a\r\nbeast into a man; whereas, the low savages discovered in various parts\r\nof the world, do not represent the original state of mankind, but are\r\nmere instances of extreme degeneracy. In fact, a different set of\r\ntraditions also prevailed among the Greeks, which, referring evidently\r\nto the period when their ancestors were Nomades, spoke with rapture and\r\nenthusiasm of their happy and tranquil life, when, following their\r\nflocks from vale to vale and from stream to stream, they fed upon the\r\nspontaneous productions which nature spread before them. On this period\r\nthe poets bestowed the name of the Golden Age, and, perhaps, if examined\r\nphilosophically, there is no stage in the history of civilisation at\r\nwhich there is so much to enjoy and so little to suffer, as when the\r\nwhole nation are shepherds, and happen to light upon a land where, as\r\nyet too few to inconvenience each other, they can live unmolested by\r\nforeign tribes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Just. xiii. 4.—The Epicnemidian Locrians were anciently called\r\n  Leleges, and by them the channel of the Cephissos was opened to the\r\n  sea.—Pliny, iv. 12.

Pind. Pyth. iv. 104.—Dion. Hal. (Ant. Rom.\r\n  i. 31) is one of those writers who considers the Pelasgi miserable\r\n  because they were wanderers. Upon this notion Palmerius remarks\r\n  judiciously: “Sed si tales migrationes miseræ sunt, miserrimi olim\r\n  Galli majores nostri, qui usque in Asiam, post multas errores, armis\r\n  victricibus penetrâsse historiæ omnes testantur, et hoc seculo\r\n  miserrimi Tartari et Arabes, qui Nomadice vivunt, et sedes identidem\r\n  mutantes, non se miseros existimant, et id genus vitæ Attalicis\r\n  conditionibus mutare recusarent.”—Græc. Antiq. p. 60.\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown how Hellas might have been entirely peopled from\r\nthe north; but certain traditions, prevailing from the earliest times,\r\ncompel us to admit that some portion, at least, of its population\r\nreached it by a different route; that is, through Asia Minor and the\r\nislands. I have already alluded briefly to the existence of a Pelasgian\r\ntribe in Paphlagonia,[43] that is to say, the Caucons, whose\r\nestablishment in this region supplies a link in the chain of proofs by\r\nwhich we endeavour to connect the Pelasgi with the Scythians of Central\r\nAsia; for the Caucons are admitted to have been of Pelasgian origin, and\r\nan opinion prevailed among the ancients that they were likewise\r\nScythians.[44] Thus we find that certain Scythians settled in\r\nPaphlagonia, were called Caucons, that the Caucons were Pelasgi, and\r\nthat the Pelasgi peopled Greece. The Greeks, therefore, by this account,\r\ntraced their origin to Scythia. Circumstances connected with the\r\ngeography of Asia Minor and of Hellas, seem to furnish traces of the\r\nroute of the Pelasgi westward. It appears to have been among the\r\nprimitive articles of their creed, that the deity delighted to abide on\r\nthe summits of lofty and even of snowy mountains; and whenever in their\r\nsettlements the features of the earth presented any such towering\r\neminence, they seem to have bestowed on it the name of Olympos, or\r\nCelestial Mansion.[45] Immediately south of the Cauconian settlements,\r\non the limits of Bithynia and Galacia, we accordingly find a mountain of\r\nthis name; again, travelling westward, we have another Mount Olympos, on\r\nthe northern confines of Phrygia; a third meets us in the island of\r\nLesbos;[46] a fourth in Cypros, a fifth in Arcadia,[47] a sixth in Elis,\r\nand a seventh, best known of all, near the cradle of the Hellenes in\r\nThessaly. In Mysia,[48] the footsteps of the race are numerous;\r\nPelasgian cities—Placia, Scylace, Cyzicos, Antandros—studded the coast;\r\ninland there was a Larissa;[49] and the lovely-leafed evergreen, which\r\nshaded the slopes and crags of the Trojan Ida, was named the Pelasgian\r\nlaurel.[50] Other facts there are connecting the Trojans with the\r\nPelasgian stock: thus the Caucons, whom we find among their allies in\r\nHomer, are called a Trojan tribe; the language of Troy was evidently a\r\nPelasgian dialect, closely allied to the Greek,[51] which may likewise\r\nbe predicated of the Phrygian, the Lydian, the Carian, the Lycian\r\nextending along the whole western coast of Asia Minor. The gods,\r\noracles, rites, ceremonies of all these people appear in early times to\r\nhave been identical with those of Hellas, and mythology represents the\r\nheroes of both continents as sprung from the same gods. Nay, positive\r\ntestimony describes the Pelasgi as a great nation, holding the whole\r\nwestern coast of Asia Minor, from Mycale to the Hellespont;[52] and\r\nspeaks of the Leleges as inhabiting a part of Caria, where their\r\ndeserted fortifications, called Lelegia,[53] apparently of Cyclopian\r\nconstruction, were still found in the time of Strabo,[54] together with\r\ntheir tombs, probably barrows, resembling those scattered through\r\nPeloponnesos, and called the “Tombs of the Phrygians.”[55] Similar\r\nsepulchral relics of Carian dominion were found and opened by the\r\nAthenians in the purification of Delos.[56] Possibly, too, the tumuli,\r\nexisting to this day in Tartary, and occasionally rifled by the\r\nSiberians, mark the original seat of the Pelasgi in Asia; though similar\r\nmonuments are found in other parts of the East, as in Nubia, where I\r\ncounted a cluster of ten or twelve, and nearly all over Europe. Homer\r\nspeaks of one on the plains of Troy, and the Greeks themselves cast up\r\nbarrows over their heroes, as Ajax, where\r\n\r\n                 “Far by the solitary shore he sleeps.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  According to the reading of Callisthenes, Homer himself fixes their\r\n  residence in Paphlagonia.—Cf.

We find, then,\r\nthat they occupied the greater part of Lydia,[57] and at the time of the\r\nIonian migration held the citadel of Ephesos. They, too, in conjunction\r\nwith the Nymphs were the founders of the temple of Hera at Samos,[58]\r\nand crossing the Mæander they re-appear again at Miletos on the coast of\r\nCaria. Indeed this city[59] was originally, from its inhabitants, called\r\nLelegeis, though it afterwards was known under a variety of names, as\r\nPituoussa from the surrounding pine woods, Anactoria, and lastly,\r\nMiletos. A little further southward was another Lelegian settlement at\r\nPedasos on the Satneios.[60] From a passage in Homer it has been\r\nsupposed that the Carians and Lelegians were distinct races, but in\r\nreality the Carians were a Lelegian tribe;[61] that is Pelasgi, who like\r\nthe Hellenes in Greece, gradually acquired power and dominion, and\r\neclipsed their brethren. This they were enabled to do by applying\r\nthemselves passionately to the use of arms, a circumstance which at a\r\nlater period led them to make a traffic of their valour and hire their\r\nswords to the best bidder. In earlier and better times they achieved\r\nconquests for themselves, and rivalling the Phœnicians in maritime\r\nenterprise and success, reduced under their sway the greater number of\r\nthe Ægæan islands,[62] and even some portion of the Hellenic continent\r\nitself.[63] Certain clans of this martial race sought an outlet for\r\ntheir restless daring by joining the Cilicians[64] in their piratical\r\nenterprises, and probably it was in this character that they first\r\nobtained possession of some of the smaller isles. Positive historical\r\ntestimony there seems to be none for fixing the Pelasgi in Cypros,[65]\r\nthough we cannot doubt that it was included in their dominions, from the\r\nruins of Cyclopian fortresses still found there, and the Olympian Mount\r\nalready mentioned. In Rhodes, however, and Samos antiquity speaks of\r\ntheir settlements;[66] they, too, were the earliest inhabitants of\r\nChios,[67] whence they sent forth a colony to Lesbos,[68] which received\r\nfrom them the name of Pelasgia. They expelled the Minyans from\r\nLemnos,[69] which afterwards, through fear of Darius, their king ceded\r\nto the Athenians,[70] and held Imbros[71] and Samothrace[72] in the\r\nnorth; Scyros, too, was originally named Pelasgia.[73] Andros was\r\npeopled by one[74] of their colonies, and Delos, as we have already\r\nseen, held their bones until they were cast forth by the Athenians. But\r\nit is unnecessary to enumerate each separate point, since we know\r\ngenerally that all the Ægæan isles were anciently in their\r\npossession,[75] and that even the great island of Crete formed, in\r\nremote ages, a portion of their empire. Here under the names of Curetes,\r\nCorybantes, Telchines and Dactyli,[76] they flourished in the mythical\r\ntimes, and were the reputed preservers and nurses of the infant Zeus, a\r\ngod pre-eminently Pelasgian, so that wherever his worship was found I\r\nregard it as a proof that the Pelasgi had settled there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Paus. vii. 2. 8.

Probably on their arrival\r\nthey found there some few inhabitants who by the isthmus had entered and\r\nscattered themselves at leisure over the peninsula. But whether this was\r\nso or not, certain it is that the oldest legends of Hellenic mythology\r\nallude to the peopling of Argos by sea, representing Inachos, its first\r\nruler, as a son of the ocean.[77] From this chief, whether historical or\r\nfabulous, the principal river of Argos received its appellation, and\r\nmembers of his family bestowed their names on Argolis first, and\r\nafterwards on the whole of Peloponnesos, which from Apis was denominated\r\nApia;[78] from Pelasgos, Pelasgia;[79] and from another prince so\r\ncalled, it received the name of Argos.[80] In this division of Hellas,\r\nwhich the rays of poetry and mythology unite to render luminous, the\r\nPelasgi[81] seem early to have struck deep root, and made a rapid\r\nprogress in civilisation. Here, accordingly, in historical times were\r\nfound the most numerous monuments of their power and grandeur; and here,\r\nin the treasury of Atreus and the walls of Tiryns denominated Cyclopian,\r\nwe still may contemplate proofs of their opulence and progress in the\r\narts. Among them would appear to have existed a class or caste named\r\nCyclops, addicted extremely to handicrafts, particularly building. These\r\nit was who erected the walls and citadel of Argos,[82] on which they\r\nbestowed the name of Larissa, together with certain labyrinths, said to\r\nhave existed in the neighbourhood of Nauplia. Mycenæ appears to have\r\nbeen the most ancient capital of the country, built while the site of\r\nArgos was yet a marsh,[83] or perhaps under water; then came Tiryns, and\r\nlastly Argos. Other early seats of the Pelasgi were at Epidauros and\r\nHermione.[84]\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Apollod. ii. 1. Keightley, Mythol. 405.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

In this province one of\r\nthe most famous of the Pelasgian tribes, is by some traditions said to\r\nhave had its origin; for Lelex,[89] who gave his name to the Leleges,\r\nthey fabled to have been an autochthon of Laconia, and down even to the\r\ntimes of Pausanias an heroum was shown at Sparta erected in honour of\r\nhis name. Undoubtedly a mythical legend connected with this hero was\r\ndeeply interwoven with the fabulous history of Laconia. His son Eurotas\r\nwas the father of Sparta, wife of Lacedæmon, who gave his name to the\r\ncountry. He had two daughters, Amycla and Eurydice, the latter of whom\r\nbecame the wife of Acrisios.[90] The Acarnanians, however, had among\r\nthem a tradition which made Lelex an autochthon of Leucadia,[91] and the\r\npeople of Megara spoke of one Lelex[92] who arrived in their country by\r\nsea from Egypt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Which Strabo (viii. 3, 157,) says was the original seat of the\r\n  Caucons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

It\r\nhas sometimes been supposed that no proof exists of their having held\r\nany part of this peninsula excepting Argos, Achaia and Arcadia;[93] but\r\nerroneously, for we have seen the Leleges, a Pelasgian tribe, in\r\nLaconia; and we find a settlement of the Pelasgi in Messenia. Here also\r\nat Andania flourished the Pelasgian worship of the Dii Kabyri from\r\nSamothrace;[94] colony of Leleges, under Pylos, son of Cleison, settled\r\nat Pylos on the Coryphasian promontory.[95] The Caucons held\r\nCyparissos;[96] that is both in the interior of Messenia and along the\r\nsea coast we find settlements of the race which peopled the whole\r\npeninsula. Passing northward into Elis, we immediately on crossing the\r\nNeda find Caucons in the Lepreatis,[97] where, probably, in proof that\r\nthe tribe originated there, they showed in Strabo’s[98] time the tomb of\r\nCaucon. They had likewise a river Caucon[99] in the north of Elis, and\r\nin short the whole country from the Neda to the Larissos bore anciently\r\nthe name of Cauconia.[100] Some, however, maintain that they were found\r\nonly at three points on the coast, that is, in the south of\r\nTriphylia,[101] in the north near Dyme, and at Hollow Elis on the\r\nPeneios, which Aristotle considered their chief seat.[102] Nevertheless\r\nAntimachos regarded the Epeians as Caucons,[103] and since these\r\ninhabited the whole western coast from Messenia northward, we must\r\nconsider Elis as the principal though not the original seat of this\r\ntribe; for we find them represented as issuing from Arcadia, and we have\r\nalready shown that they were settled in Paphlagonia, and were\r\ndenominated a Trojan tribe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Thirl.

A modern historian[106] who experienced the same\r\ndifficulty, observes, that the Ionians appear to have dropped from\r\nheaven into Attica. Unquestionably we do not know whence they came, and\r\nas their own legends represent them as autochthons[107] we can expect no\r\naid from tradition. The most probable supposition is, that when the\r\nmigratory hordes were pushing southward from Thessaly, some clans, more\r\nfortunate than the rest, traversing the heights of Cithæron soon found\r\nthemselves in possession of this unfertile but lovely land, covered in\r\nthose ages with forests, diversified by hill and dale, and breathing\r\nperfume from every thicket. The succeeding tide of emigration breaking\r\nagainst the ridge of Cithæron seems to have turned westward and flowed\r\ninto the Peloponnesos, leaving Attica unmolested. Some have regarded its\r\nown barrenness as the rampart which protected it from invasion. But why\r\nmay we not suppose that the inhabitants finding themselves thriving and\r\ntranquil, resolved early to fight for their possessions, and hedged\r\nthemselves from invasion by courage and arms? be this as it may, Attica\r\nwas the first part of Hellas that enjoyed permanent exemption from war,\r\nso that the olive, its principal ornament and riches, became in all\r\nafter ages the emblem of peace. Once settled in this country the Pelasgi\r\nwere never driven thence,[108] nor did they ever receive any\r\nconsiderable mixture of foreign settlers. Individuals from time to time\r\nwere permitted to take up their abode among them; but, in this favoured\r\nspot, unalloyed by foreign mixture, the Pelasgic genius completely\r\ndeveloped itself, and reached the highest pitch of civilisation known to\r\nthe ancient world.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Müll. Dor. i. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Arist. Acharn. 75.—Nubb. 971.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Herod. i. 56. vii. 161. Lesbon. Protrept. ii. 22. f. Conf. Wessel. ad\r\n  Herod. p. 26.\r\n\r\nThe earliest name bestowed on the Pelasgian tribe which held Attica was\r\nthat of Cranaans;[109] but whether they were so distinguished before\r\ntheir migration thither, or, which is more probable, derived their\r\nappellation from the rocky nature[110] of their country, does not\r\nappear. Like most of the ancient nations, however, they frequently\r\nchanged their name: at first perhaps simply Pelasgi, next Cranaans, then\r\nCecropidæ and Ionians; afterwards, under the reign of Erechtheus they\r\nobtained from their patron divinity the name of Athenians, by which they\r\nhave been known down to the present day. Among the fables of the\r\nmythology we discover traces of several attempts at disputing with the\r\nAborigines the sovereignty of Attica. Thus Eumolpos, with a colony of\r\nThracians, is by one tradition said to have obtained possession of the\r\nwhole country,[111] while another and more probable legend represents\r\nhim as settling with a small band at Eleusis, where his family during\r\nthe whole existence of Paganism exercised the office of priests of\r\nDemeter.[112] The Cretans again under Minos sought to obtain a footing\r\nin the country; but the close of the tradition which speaks of this\r\ninvasion shows that though disgraceful to Attica it was without any\r\npermanent result. Afterwards, when the unsettled Pelasgi had degenerated\r\ninto pirates and freebooters, a powerful band of them appears to have\r\nfound its way thither, and obtained a settlement in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the capital,[113] on condition, apparently, of\r\nlabouring at the erection of walls round the Acropolis. A portion of the\r\nfortifications is said to have been completed by these marauders, and to\r\nhave obtained from them the name of the Pelasgian wall. But even these\r\nstrangers were not suffered to remain; quarrels arising either about the\r\nland which the Pelasgi had obtained on the slopes of Hymettos, or on\r\naccount of violence offered to certain Athenian maidens descending to\r\nthe fountain of Callirrhoë for water. The emigrants were expelled and\r\ntook refuge in Lemnos. In revenge for what they regarded as an injury,\r\nthey carried away a number of Attic virgins who were celebrating the\r\nfestival of Artemis at Brauron, which led in after times to the capture\r\nof Lemnos by Miltiades.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  Herod. i. 57. viii. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  Suid. _v._ Κραν. t. i. p. 1518. d.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  Strab. vii. 7. p. 114.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  Palmer.

Herod. ii. 51. seq.\r\n\r\nIt seems to result from the above inquiry that every district in Hellas\r\nwas originally peopled by the Pelasgi, which the poets in after ages\r\nexpressed by saying that a king of that nation reigned over the whole\r\ncountry as far northward as the Strymon in Thrace.[114]\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  Æschyl. Suppl. 259. sqq.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that their dominions extended much further, and included\r\nnot Thrace only, beyond the limits of Greece, but a great part likewise\r\nof Asia Minor and nearly every island in the Ægæan. But even these\r\nspacious limits were not wide enough to contain the whole Pelasgian\r\npopulation; for traversing the Adriatic, they penetrated into Etruria,\r\nand there and elsewhere in Italy, under the name of Tyrrhenians, erected\r\nCyclopian cities, and deposited the germs of its future\r\ncivilisation.[115] Hence the great resemblance which historians and\r\nantiquaries have observed between the Etruscans and the Greeks. Both\r\nwere offshoots from the great Pelasgic stem; though the simplicity of\r\nthe original race in religion and manners maintained longer its ground\r\nin Italy than under the warmer skies of Greece. In these more western\r\nsettlements, however, new tribes sprang up, who in glory eclipsed the\r\nmother race, which they learned to regard with contempt, so that they\r\nbestowed the name of Pelasgi on their slaves. A similar circumstance had\r\npreviously occurred in Asia Minor, where the Carians reduced to\r\nservitude such of their brethren as in later times retained the name of\r\nLeleges.[116]\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  Gœttl. ad Hes.

They then separated with groans, cries, and mingling\r\n  together their tears.—Athen. xiv. 81. The Bruttii are said to have\r\n  been driven out of their country by the Pelasgi (Plin. iii. 8); who\r\n  also settled in Lucania and Bruttium (9, 10). Pelasgi came out of\r\n  Peloponnesos into Latium, settled on the Sarna, called themselves\r\n  Sarrhastes, and built, among others, the town of Nuceria.—Serv. ad Æn.\r\n  vii. 738.

Athen. vi. 101.\r\n\r\nIf now we cast a rapid glance over the sciences and civilisation of the\r\nPelasgi, we shall probably have acquired as complete an idea of that\r\nancient people as existing monuments enable us to frame.[117] Tradition\r\nattributed to them the invention of several arts of primary necessity,\r\nas those of building houses and manufacturing clothing, which they did\r\nfrom the skins of wild boars, the animals first slain by man for food. A\r\nrelic of this primitive style of dress remained, we are told, to a very\r\nlate age among the rustics of Phocis and Eubœa.[118] Other traditions\r\nwill have it that mankind fed on grass and herbs until the Pelasgi\r\ntaught them the greater refinement of feeding upon acorns. But leaving\r\nthese poetical fancies, we shall find in many genuine monuments and\r\nfacts undisputed proofs of the power and knowledge of the Pelasgi. In\r\nthe first place, they it was who bequeathed to their Hellenic\r\ndescendants some knowledge, though imperfect and obscure, of the true\r\nGod.[119] In their minds the recognition of the unity of the Divine\r\nBeing formed the basis of theology, and the philosophers of after ages\r\nwho reasoned best and thought most correctly rose no higher on these\r\npoints than their rude ancestors.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  See Nieb. i. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Paus. viii. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 32. 51. Plato, Tim. t. vii. 22–31. 96. 142.\r\n\r\nBut the natural tendency of the human mind to error soon disturbed the\r\nsimplicity of their faith; for as the tribes separated, each taking a\r\ndifferent direction, they all in turns learned to consider the God as\r\ntheir patron, so that speedily there were as many gods as tribes, and\r\npolytheism was created. Thus the Pelasgi, who had at first like the\r\npolished nations of modern times no name for _the gods_, because they\r\nbelieved in but one, degenerated in the course of time, and invented\r\nthat system of divinities and heroes which afterwards prevailed in\r\nGreece. They, too, it was, who in the developement of their superstition\r\nmade the first steps towards the arts by setting up rude images of the\r\npowers they worshipped, and to them accordingly the introduction of the\r\nHermæan statues at Athens is attributed.[120] There was likewise in a\r\ntemple of Demeter between mount Eboras and Taygetos, a wooden statue of\r\nOrpheus, supposed to be the workmanship of the Pelasgi.[121] Evidently\r\ntoo, the worship of Demeter, and of all the rural gods grew up\r\noriginally among them, as did likewise the adoration of supreme power\r\nand supreme wisdom in Zeus and Athena.[122]\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  Paus. iii. 20. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  We find mention, too, of a Pelasgian Hera, Alex. ab. Alex. p. 321.\r\n  Sch. Apol. Rhod. i. 14.\r\n\r\nUsually the Pelasgi are considered as a much wandering people,[123]\r\nthough it would be more correct to represent them, like the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace in modern times, as the prolific parents of many settlements,\r\nspreading widely, but taking root wherever they spread. A proof of this\r\nstill exists in the vast structures[124] which they reared, whose ruins\r\nare yet found scattered through Asia, Greece, and Italy. These Cyclopian\r\nbuildings, palaces, treasuries, fortresses, barrows, were not the works\r\nof nomadic hordes, but of a people attached to the soil and resolute in\r\ndefending it. Navigation, likewise, they cultivated, and were among the\r\nearliest nations who possessed a power at sea,[125] which led\r\nnecessarily to the study of astronomy, together with the occult science\r\nof the stars.[126] Of their progress in the more ordinary arts of\r\nutility we have very little knowledge, but we find in the Iliad a\r\nPelasgian woman staining ivory to be used as ornaments of a\r\nwar-horse;[127] the invention of the shepherd’s crook was attributed to\r\nthem; so likewise was the religious dance called Hyporchema;[128] their\r\nproficiency in music is spoken of;[129] and their pre-eminence in war\r\nwas signified by representing them as inventors of the shield.[130]\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  Strab. xiii. 3. p. 144.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  Serv. ad Æn. vi. 630.

Some,\r\nrelying on particular passages in ancient writers, have imagined that it\r\nwas very different from the Greek,[131] but although in support of such\r\nan opinion much ingenuity may be exhibited there are circumstances which\r\ncompel us to reject it. The Athenians and Arcadians, for example, though\r\nof Pelasgian origin, spoke, and that from the remotest times, the same\r\nlanguage with the rest of the Greeks; and though the Æolic dialect,[132]\r\nthe most ancient in Arcadia, or indeed in all Greece, was transformed to\r\nLatin in Italy, we are not on that account to infer that Latin bore a\r\ncloser resemblance than the Greek to the mother tongue of both. The\r\nPelasgian language indeed appears to have been the Hellenic in the\r\nearlier stages of its formation, just as the Pelasgi themselves were\r\nGreeks under another name and in a ruder state of civilisation. Whether\r\nthey possessed any knowledge of written characters before[133] the\r\nintroduction of the Phœnician we have now no means of ascertaining, the\r\npassages usually brought forward in behalf of such an opinion being of\r\nsmall authority. To them, however, tradition attributes the introduction\r\nof letters into Latium,[134] and there can be no doubt that the use of\r\nwritten characters was known in Greece before its inhabitants had ceased\r\nto be called Pelasgi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  Nieb. i. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  Palm.

The Athenians, and consequently the Ionians, are on\r\nall hands acknowledged to have sprung from the Pelasgian stock. It only\r\nremains to be shown that the Dorians also traced their origin to this\r\npeople, and we shall be satisfied that the whole of the illustrious\r\nnation, known to history under the name of Greeks, flowed from one and\r\nthe same source. The Hellenes, of whom the Dorians were a tribe,[135]\r\noccupied in later times the south of Thessaly, but at a much earlier\r\nperiod, along with the Selli,[136] dwelt in the mountainous tracts about\r\nDodona, where they were known under the name of Greeks or\r\nmountaineers,[137] which was the original signification of the term.\r\nThis district of Epeiros, it has been shown, was among the very earliest\r\nof the Pelasgian settlements, from which of itself it might be inferred\r\nthat the Hellenes were Pelasgi. We are not left to rely in this matter\r\non mere inference, since Herodotus states distinctly that they were a\r\nfragment of the Pelasgi.[138]\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Serv. ad Æn. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

These persons, coming from countries\r\nfarther advanced in civilisation, would undoubtedly bring along with\r\nthem a superior degree of knowledge in many useful arts, which, in\r\ngratitude for their hospitable reception, they would undoubtedly\r\ncommunicate to the inhabitants. But the most active agent in the\r\ndiffusion of civilisation was probably commerce, which, by bringing\r\nneighbouring nations into close contact, by enlarging the sphere of\r\ntheir experience, and teaching them the advantages to be derived from\r\npeaceful intercourse, has in all ages softened and refined mankind. When\r\nthe use of letters began first to prevail in the East is not known, but\r\nit was probably communicated early to the Pelasgi, along with the\r\nmaterials for writing; and whatever inventions were made on either side\r\nof the Mediterranean passed rapidly from shore to shore, so that the\r\ncivilisation of the Egyptians, Phœnicians, and Greeks, advanced\r\nsimultaneously, though the beginnings of improvement were undoubtedly\r\nmore ancient on the banks of the Nile and among the maritime Arabs than\r\nin Hellas. The amount, however, of eastern influences I conceive was not\r\ngreat, and as to colonies, properly so called, with the exception of\r\nthose already described from Asia Minor, I believe there never were any.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  See Mitford (Hist. of Greece, 81. ff.) who is full of these colonies.\r\n  Herod. i. 2.

In doing this it may be useful\r\nto consider them in three different stages of their progress: first, in\r\nthe heroic and poetical times; secondly, in the historical and\r\nflourishing ages of the Hellenic commonwealth; thirdly, in their corrupt\r\nand degenerate state under the dominion of the Macedonians and Romans.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguishing characteristic of the Hellenes, when poetry\r\nfirst places them before us, is a profound veneration for the divinity\r\nand every thing connected with the service of religion. By the force of\r\nimagination heaven and earth were brought near each other, not so much,\r\nindeed, by elevating the latter, as by bringing down the former within\r\nthe sphere of humanity. Gods and men moved together over the earth,\r\ncooperated in bringing about events, keeping up a constant interchange\r\nof beneficence; the god aiding, the mortal repaying his aid with\r\ngratitude;[140] the god guiding, the mortal submitting to be directed,\r\nuntil, sometimes, as in the case of Odysseus and Athena, the feeling of\r\ngrace and favour on the one side, and of veneration and gratitude on the\r\nother, ripened into something like friendship and affection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plut. Pericl. § 13.\r\n\r\nNo man entered on any important enterprise without first consulting the\r\ngods, and throwing himself upon their protection, by sacrifice,\r\ndivination, and prayer.[141] They conceived, according to the best\r\nlights afforded them by their rude creed, that although means existed of\r\nwarping the judgment, perverting the affections, and vitiating the\r\ndecisions of their divinities, yet upon the whole and in the natural\r\norder of things they were just and beneficent, mercifully caring for the\r\npoor and the stranger, the guardians of friendship and hospitality, and\r\navenging severely the offences committed against their laws. Habitually,\r\nwhen not provoked to vengeance by impiety or crimes, the gods they\r\nbelieved were not only beneficent towards mankind, but given among\r\nthemselves to cheerfulness and mirth, loving music, songs, and laughter,\r\nfeasting jovially together in a joy serene and almost imperturbable,\r\nsave when interrupted by solicitude for some favoured mortal.\r\nPhilosophy, in more intellectual times, condemned this rude conception\r\nof divine things; but men’s ideas, like their offerings, belong to the\r\nstate of society in which they live, and the Greeks of the heroic ages\r\nunquestionably attributed to their gods the qualities most in esteem\r\namong themselves.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  See Man. Moschop. ap Arist. Nubb. 982.\r\n\r\nNext to religion the most prominent feeling in the mind of the early\r\nGreeks was filial piety.[142] Nowhere among men were parents held in\r\nhigher honour. The reverence paid to them partook largely of the\r\nreligious sentiment. Regarded as the instruments by which God had\r\ncommunicated the mysterious and sacred gift of life, they were supposed\r\nby their children to be for ever invested with a high degree of sanctity\r\nas ministers and representatives of the Creator. Hence the anxiety\r\nexperienced to obtain a father’s blessing and the indescribable dread of\r\nhis curse. A peculiar set of divinities, the terrible Erinnyes, all but\r\nimplacable and unsparing, were entrusted with the guardianship of a\r\nparent’s rights, and indescribable were the pangs and anguish supposed\r\nto seize upon transgressors. These were the powers who tracked about the\r\nmatricides Orestes and Alcmæon, scaring them with spectral terrors and\r\nfilling their palaces with the alarms and agonies of Tartaros. On the\r\nother hand, nothing can be more beautiful than the pictures of filial\r\npiety exhibited by the nobler characters of heroic times. The examples\r\nare innumerable, but none is so striking or complete as that of Achilles\r\ntowards his father Peleus. Fierce, vehement, stern in the ordinary\r\nrelations of life, towards his aged father he is gentle as a child. His\r\nheart yearns to him with a strength of feeling incomprehensible to a\r\nmeaner nature. He submits to his sway and authority not from any\r\napprehension of his power, not even from the fear of offending him, but\r\nfrom the fulness of his love, from the natural excellence and purity of\r\nhis heart. He would erect his valour and the might of his arm into a\r\nrampart round the old man, to protect him from injury and insult; and\r\neven in the cold region of shadows beyond the grave this feeling is\r\nrepresented as still alive, so that in death, as in life, the uppermost\r\nanxiety of the hero’s soul is for the happiness of his father. Even in\r\nthe government of his impetuous passions during his mortal career, in\r\nthe choice of the object of his love, Achilles expresses a desire to\r\nrender his feelings subordinate to those of his parent, thus verging on\r\nthe utmost limits of self-denial and self-control conceivable in a state\r\nof nature. Homer understood his countrymen well when he gave these\r\nqualities to his hero. Without them, he knew that no degree of courage\r\nor wisdom would have sufficed to render him popular, and, therefore, we\r\nfind him not only pre-eminent for his piety towards the gods, but at the\r\nsame time the most affectionate and dutiful of sons, the warmest, most\r\ndisinterested, and unchangeable of friends.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  Respect for old age is still a remarkable feature in the Greek\r\n  character. Thiersch. Etat Actuel de la Grèce, i. 292. On the same\r\n  trait in their ancestors see Mitf. i. 186. Odyss. ω. 254. Plat. Repub.\r\n  vi. p. 6. f. Æsch. cont. Tim. § 7.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to consider another remarkable feature of the Greek\r\ncharacter,—its peculiar aptitude for friendship. No country’s history\r\nand traditions abound with so many examples of this virtue as those of\r\nGreece. In truth, it was there regarded as the most unequivocal mark of\r\nan heroic and generous nature, being wholly inconsistent with anything\r\nbase, sordid, or ignoble, and flourishing only in company with virtues\r\nrarest and most difficult of acquisition. Poetry, no doubt, has clad the\r\nfriendship of heroic times with a splendour scarcely belonging to real\r\nlife, but the experience of history warrants us in making but slight\r\ndeductions. Nature in those ages appeared to delight in producing men in\r\npairs, each suited to be the ornament and solace of the other,\r\npossessing different qualities, imperfect when apart, but complete,\r\nunited. Men thus constituted were a sort of moral twins, an extension,\r\nif we may so speak, of unity, the same yet different, bringing two souls\r\nunder the yoke of one will, desiring the same, hating the same,\r\npossessing the same, valuing life and the gifts of life only as they\r\nwere shared in common, seeking adventures, facing dangers together,\r\nconforming their thoughts, opinions, feelings, each to the other, having\r\nno distinct interest, no distinct hope, but engrafting two lives on the\r\nchances of one man’s fortune, and both perishing by the same blow.\r\n\r\nThis feeling has by some been supposed to have owed its strength, in\r\npart at least, to the degraded position of women in society; a subject\r\non which I shall have more to say hereafter, but may here remark that\r\nsuch an opinion is wholly incompatible with an impartial interpretation\r\nof the Homeric poems and the older traditions of Greece. Throughout\r\nfabulous times women are the prime movers in all great events; and the\r\nrespect which as mothers, sisters, wives, and daughters they received,\r\nthough expressed in uncourtly language, was perhaps as great as has ever\r\nbeen paid them in any age or country. Every distinguished woman in Homer\r\nis the centre of a circle of tender and touching associations. We behold\r\nthem beloved by their relatives, honoured by their dependants, enjoying\r\nevery decent freedom, every becoming pleasure, with all the influence\r\nand authority appertaining to their sex. Thus Helen, both before and\r\nafter her fall, is entire mistress of her house, and treated with all\r\npossible deference and delicacy: so Hecuba, Andromache, Penelope, Arete,\r\nNausicaa, and Iphigeneia in their respective positions, are held in the\r\nhighest esteem, and command as great a share of love from those whose\r\nduty it was to love and honour them, as any other women in history or\r\nfiction. Nor were due respect and tenderness confined to the high and\r\nthe noble; for innumerable proofs occur in Homer that even among the\r\nhumblest ranks, that delicate self-respect which is shown by respect to\r\nour other self, and may be regarded as the pivot of civilisation, was\r\nalready in that age very generally diffused.\r\n\r\nBut if the Greeks of heroic times possessed the good qualities we have\r\nattributed to them, they were still more, perhaps, distinguished for\r\nothers, which often obliterated the footsteps of their virtues, and\r\nappeared to be the guiding principles of their lives. Chief among these\r\nwas their passion for war and violence,[143] which engaged them in\r\neverlasting struggles with their neighbours, developed overmuch their\r\nfierce and destructive qualities, and threw into comparative shade such\r\nof their propensities as were gentler and more humane. War by land,\r\npiracy by sea, filled the whole country with incessant alarms. Commerce\r\nwas checked and confined within very narrow channels, both travelling\r\nand navigation being exceedingly unsafe, while bands of marauders\r\ntraversed land and sea in quest of rapine and plunder. In some states no\r\nother mode was known of arriving at opulence, and the humbler classes of\r\nsociety were wholly subsisted by it.[144] The laws of war, too, were\r\nproportionably savage. It was customary either to give no quarter, or to\r\ndevote all prisoners taken to servitude; and, accordingly, every petty\r\nstate was filled with unfortunate captives, many of them of illustrious\r\nbirth and qualities, reduced to the humblest conditions, being compelled\r\nto earn their bread by the sweat of their brow. In peace, too, and in\r\ntheir own homes their warlike habits led frequently to the perpetration\r\nof violence; their passions being strong and unbridled they resented\r\ninsults on the spot, and numerous homicides were, in consequence, found\r\nflying from the country whose infant institutions their passions had\r\nsought to overthrow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  See Thirlwall i. 180. sqq. and Mitford i. 181.—Among the Sauromatæ, in\r\n  the time of Hippocrates, even the women mounted on horseback and\r\n  fought in battle. They were not allowed to marry until they had slain\r\n  three enemies.—De Aër. et. Loc. § 78. A circumstance is related of the\r\n  Parthian court, illustrative of the ferocity which prevailed generally\r\n  in antiquity. The monarch, it is said, kept a humble friend, whom he\r\n  fed like a dog, and whipped till the blood flowed, for the slightest\r\n  offence at table, apparently for the amusement of the guests.—Athen.\r\n  iv. 38. This trait of barbarism was imitated by the Czar Peter, by\r\n  servile historians denominated the Great, who used brutally to\r\n  maltreat the princess Galitzin before his whole court.—Mem. of the\r\n  Margrav. of Bayreuth, vol. i. p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 5.\r\n\r\nBut in all stages of society it has been ordained by Providence that out\r\nof the wickedness of man some compensating good shall flow: thus, from\r\nthe dangers and difficulties surrounding the stranger the virtue of\r\nhospitality[145] sprang up in generous minds. From the distress and\r\nmisery of the passionate or accidental slayer of man arose the merciful\r\nrites of expiation, and all the friendly ties which subsisted between\r\nthe purifier and the purified. Wanderers driven from their home often\r\nfound a better in a foreign land; and thus even the transgressions and\r\nmisfortunes of men, by breaking down the narrow enclosures of families\r\nand clans, and connecting persons of distant tribes together by benefits\r\nand gratitude, hastened the progress of refinement and paved the way for\r\nthe greatness and glory of succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Il. ρ. 212. seq. The word ξένος signified, actively and passively, the\r\n  host and the guest. The rights of hospitality were hereditary, the\r\n  descendants of men being compelled to entertain the descendants of\r\n  those with whom their forefathers had contracted hospitable ties.\r\n  Πρόξενοι sometimes signified persons who publicly received\r\n  ambassadors, as Antenor among the Trojans. Agamemnon had hospitable\r\n  ties with the Phrygians, because he came of Phrygian ancestors. Damm.\r\n  _v._ ξένος. Sch. Aristoph. Eq. 347. Cf. Virg. Æn. viii. 165. et Serv.\r\n  ad loc. Plat. Soph. t. iv. p. 125, where Socrates alludes to a passage\r\n  in Homer, in which Zeus is said to be the companion of the wanderer,\r\n  observing jocularly that the Eleatic stranger might probably have been\r\n  some deity in disguise. Cf. Tomas. Tess. Hosp. c. 23. ap. Gronov.\r\n  Thesaur. ix. 266. sqq. It was a proverb at Athens that the doors of\r\n  the Prytaneion would keep out no stranger.—Sch. Aristoph. Ach. 127.\r\n  The Lucanians had a law thus expressed: “If a stranger arriving at\r\n  sunset ask a lodging of any one, let him who refuses to be his host be\r\n  fined for want of hospitality.” The object, I imagine, of the law,\r\n  says Ælian (Var. Hist. iv. i.) was at once to avenge the stranger and\r\n  Hospitable Zeus.\r\n\r\nIt will, from what has been said, be seen that among the elements of the\r\nGreek character passion greatly predominated; but, even from the\r\nearliest times, the existence was apparent of other powerful principles,\r\nby the influence of which the nation was led to emerge rapidly from its\r\nperiod of barbarism. These were an innate love of magnificence, and a\r\nstriking inclination towards all social enjoyments; the former leading\r\nto the cultivation of commerce and industry, the latter communicating an\r\nextraordinary impetus to the natural desire common to mankind for\r\ncompanionship and society. But in developing these principles nature\r\npursued in Greece a peculiar route. Instead of establishing a common\r\ncentre, towards which the energies of the whole nation might tend,\r\nsociety was broken up into numerous parts, each forming, when considered\r\nseparately, a whole, but united with its neighbours by identity of\r\norigin, language, religion, and national character.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers usually seek in geographical position a key to the fact of\r\nthe formation of so many separate states as the Hellenic population was\r\ndivided into; but the cause was probably of a different kind. Among\r\nevery other people, a difficulty has always been experienced in\r\ndiscovering men capable of conducting public affairs; and, when any such\r\nhave arisen, they have easily subdued to their will their less\r\nintellectual and, consequently, less ambitious neighbours. Among the\r\nGreeks the case was wholly different: every province, every district,\r\nnay, every town and village abounded with men endowed with the ability\r\nand passion for governing. These feelings begot the aversion to submit\r\nto the government of others; this aversion engendered strife; and it was\r\nonly the accident of a numerical superiority existing in one division of\r\nthe country, or of a statesman of extraordinary genius springing up,\r\nthat enabled one village to subdue its neighbours for a few miles\r\naround, and thus establish a small political community.\r\n\r\nHistory rarely penetrates back so far as the period in which this state\r\nof things existed. But we have an example in the annals of Attica, where\r\nthe twelve small municipal states, if one may so speak, were, partly by\r\npersuasion, partly by force, brought under the authority of one city,\r\npossessing the advantages of a superior position and wiser and more\r\nenterprising leaders.\r\n\r\nThese diminutive polities once formed, many causes concurred to preserve\r\ntheir integrity, of which the most obvious and powerful was the pride of\r\nrace, and, next to this, certain religious feelings and peculiarities,\r\nwhich stationed gods along the frontier line of states, and rendered it\r\nimpious for the worshippers of other divinities to invade or dispossess\r\nthem of their lands. Communities having at first been thus isolated,\r\nnumerous circumstances arose to make eternal the separation. The ready\r\ninvention of the people gave to each state its heroes and heroic\r\ntraditions, based, perhaps, on the exploits of border warfare, in which\r\nthe ancestors of one community had suffered or inflicted injuries on the\r\nancestors of another. Poets sprang up who celebrated these deeds in\r\nsong, and every assembly, every festival, every merry-making resounded\r\nwith the commemoration of deeds as galling to one people as they were\r\nglorious to the other. These prejudices, this cantonal patriotism, this\r\ntribual vanity, if I may coin a new word to express a new idea,\r\nconstituted a far more impassable barrier between the diminutive states\r\nof Greece, than either mountains or rivers; though, in process of time,\r\nsome few cases occurred in which very small communities were immersed\r\nand lost in greater ones. The heroism, however, with which the smallest\r\ncommonwealth struggled to preserve its separate existence, the watchful\r\njealousy, the undying solicitude, the fierce and sanguinary valour by\r\nwhich it hedged round its independence, the indescribable agonies of\r\npolitical extinction, may be seen in the examples of Ægina, Megara,\r\nPlatæa, and Messenia.\r\n\r\nIn fact the most remarkable peculiarity in the Greek character was a\r\ncertain centrifugal force, or abhorrence of centralisation, which\r\npresented insurmountable obstacles to the union of the whole Hellenic\r\nnation under one head. The inhabitants of ancient Italy exhibited on\r\nthis point an entirely dissimilar character. Though differing from each\r\nother widely in manners, customs and laws, they still possessed so much\r\nof affinity as enabled them successively to unite themselves with Rome,\r\nand melt into one great people. The causes lay in their moral and\r\nintellectual character: possessing little genius or imagination, but\r\nmuch good sense, they experienced less keenly the misery of inferiority,\r\nthe anguish of defeat, the tortures of submission, and calculated more\r\ncoolly the advantages of protection and tranquillity, and all the other\r\nbenefits of living under a strong government. Where the masses are but\r\nslightly impregnated with the fire of genius they are naturally disposed\r\nto amalgamation, and form a vast body necessarily subjected to one head.\r\nBut where a nation is everywhere pervaded and quickened by genius, where\r\nimagination is an universal attribute, where to soar is as natural as to\r\nbreathe, where the principal enjoyment of life is the exercise of power,\r\nwhere men hunger and thirst more for renown than for their daily bread,\r\nwhere life itself without these imaginary delights is insipid and\r\ndespicable, no force, while the vigour of the national character\r\ncontinues unbroken, can erect a central government, or achieve extensive\r\nconquests, that is, subject one part of the nation to the sway of the\r\nother. And perhaps it may be found when we shall farther have perfected\r\nthe science of government, that in politics as in physics the largest\r\nbodies are not the most valuable, or the most difficult to be shattered.\r\nThe diamond resists when the largest rock yields. The true tendency of\r\ncivilisation, therefore, is to reduce unwieldy empires into compact\r\nbodies, which the light of education can penetrate and render luminous.\r\nVast empires are but opaque masses of ignorance.\r\n\r\nFrom precisely the same causes arose the peculiar notions of the Greeks\r\non the subject of government; that is, the citizens of each state\r\napplied to one another the principle which regulated the conduct of\r\ncommunities. Every man experienced an aversion to yield obedience to his\r\nneighbour, every man was ambitious to rule; but, as this was impossible,\r\nit became necessary to invent some means by which public business could\r\nbe carried on without offering too much violence to the national\r\ncharacter. Hence the origin of republicanism and the establishment of\r\ncommonwealths, in which the sovereignty was acknowledged to reside in\r\nthe body of the people, and where such of the citizens as by abilities,\r\nrank, friends, were qualified, might rule in vicarious succession.\r\n\r\nBut the various families of the Hellenes were not all equally endowed\r\nwith the energy and intellect which belonged to their race; some\r\npossessed more of these qualities, others less, and there were besides\r\nin operation numerous peculiar and local causes which modified the forms\r\nof polity adopted by the various states of Greece. The heavier, the\r\ncolder, the more inert naturally chose that form of government which\r\nwould least tax their mental faculties, and most completely relieve them\r\nfrom the care of public affairs, in order the more sedulously to attend\r\nto their own; while the fierier, the busier, more active and buoyant\r\npreferred that political constitution which would afford their energetic\r\nnatures most employment, and supply a legitimate outlet for the ardour\r\nand impetuosity of their temperament. Thus, in certain communities there\r\nwas a leaning towards monarchy, in others towards oligarchy; in a third\r\nclass towards aristocracy; while Athens and some few smaller states\r\npreferred the stir, bustle, and incessant animation of democracy.\r\n\r\nAgain these institutions, springing at first out of national\r\nidiosyncrasies, became in their turn among the most active causes which\r\nimpressed the stamp of individuality on the population of each separate\r\nstate: for the principle which animates a form of government is not a\r\nbarren principle, but impregnates, leavens, and vivifies the community\r\nsubjected to its influence, and produces an offspring analogous to the\r\nsource from which it sprang. Thus, in monarchies the summits of a nation\r\nare rich with verdure and glorious with light; in aristocracies a broad\r\ntable-land is fertilized and rendered beautiful; while in commonwealths,\r\nproperly so called, the whole surface of society unrolls itself like a\r\nvast plain to the sun, and receives the light and comfort, and\r\ninvigorating influence of its beams:—and all these various modifications\r\nof civil polity were at different times and in different parts of the\r\ncountry beheld in Greece, where they produced their natural fruits.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal results of the causes we have enumerated were a high\r\nintellectual cultivation, the profoundest study of philosophy, the most\r\nardent pursuit of literature, a matchless taste for the beautiful in\r\nnature and in art, an irrepressible enthusiasm in the search after\r\nknowledge of every kind, and, joined with these, as their cause\r\nsometimes, and sometimes as their consequence, an invincible and\r\nlimitless craving after fame. And these characteristic qualities of the\r\npeople exhibited themselves in various ways. Sometimes, as in Thessaly,\r\nmen sought to distinguish themselves by their wealth and the pomp by\r\nwhich they were surrounded:—sometimes their ruling passion urged them to\r\npluck, amidst blood and slaughter, the laurels of war, as in Crete and\r\nSparta, where military discipline was carried to its utmost perfection,\r\nwhere men lived perpetually encamped around their domestic hearths,\r\ncultivated the habits, preferences, tastes, and feelings of soldiers,\r\nand looked upon dominion as the supreme good:—sometimes religion, with\r\nits rites and pomp and sacrifices, absorbed a whole people, as in Elis,\r\nwhere the worship of supreme Zeus and the celebration of sacred games\r\nconferred a sanctity upon the land and people which all men of Hellenic\r\nblood respected:—elsewhere mountaineers,[146] of indomitable valour,\r\nhired out their swords to the best bidder, and became, as it were, the\r\njourneymen of war:—elegant pleasures in many cities, and commerce and\r\nmagnificence, occupied and depraved the whole community; while\r\nothers,[147] of grosser minds and more sordid propensities, passed their\r\nwhole lives in indolent gluttony round the festive board, amid crowds of\r\nsingers, flute-players, and dancers; or else, like the Delphians, were\r\never seen hovering amid the smoke of the altars, whetting their\r\nsacrificial knives or feasting on the savoury victims; and yet the\r\ntriumphs of the Thebans proved that even the lowest of the Greeks, when\r\ncircumstances led them to cultivate the arts of war, were capable of\r\nplanning and executing great designs, and acquiring lasting celebrity.\r\nThe arts, however, by which the Greeks rose to greatness,[148] and\r\nbecame the instructors and everlasting benefactors of mankind,\r\nflourished chiefly at Athens, and in the numerous colonies which she\r\nplanted in various parts of Asia and the islands. To men of Ionian race\r\nwe owe, in fact, the invention and most successful culture of poetry and\r\nphilosophy, and those plastic and mimetic arts which added to the world\r\nof realities another world more beautiful still. If the Greeks borrowed,\r\nas no doubt they did, certain varieties and forms of art and learning\r\nfrom the barbarians, they immediately so refined and improved them, that\r\nthe original inventors would no longer have recognised the works of\r\ntheir own hands. The glory of giving birth to several of the arts and\r\nsciences belongs to them: they were the inventors of the art of war;\r\namong them alone, in the ancient world, painting and sculpture assumed\r\ntheir proper dignity; and in politics and statesmanship, and that art of\r\narts, philosophy, they led the way, and taught mankind the steps by\r\nwhich to arrive at perfection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  According to Hippocrates, the inhabitants of lofty mountains, well\r\n  watered, are generally hardy and of tall stature, but fierce and\r\n  ferocious. In saying this, the philosopher describes the Arcadians\r\n  without naming them. De Aër. et Loc. § 120.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 74.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Clem. Alex. Strom. i. p. 355. l. 12. Wink. Hist. de l’Art, i. 316.\r\n\r\nGreece, by the means we have described, was gradually reclaimed from the\r\nstate of nature, covered with beautiful cities, harbours, docks,\r\ntemples, palaces adorned with infinite variety of works of art, with\r\nsculpture in ivory and gold, with paintings, gems, and vases, which\r\nconverted her principal cities into so many museums. Her plains, her\r\ndells, her mountain recesses were studded with sanctuaries and sacred\r\ngroves, conferring the external beauty of religion on the whole face of\r\nthe country. Public roads, branching from numerous capital cities,\r\ntraversed the land in every direction; bridges spanned her rivers,\r\nagriculture covered her hills and plains with harvests, the vine hung in\r\nfestoons from tree to tree, the foliage of the olive clothed the\r\nmountain sides, and a belt of beautiful gardens surrounded every city,\r\ntown, and village.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of all this amazing activity has, by philosophers,\r\nbeen sought for in various circumstances of the condition of the Greeks,\r\nin the form of their institutions, in the rivalry of so many small\r\ncommunities, in the fact of their being inventors, and the consequent\r\nfreshness of their pursuits. But although all these circumstances and\r\nmany others contributed, as we have shown, to expedite the progress of\r\nthe Greeks in civilisation, they were none of them the fountain head,\r\nwhich lies far beyond our ken. It were in fact as easy to tell why one\r\nstar differs from another star in glory, as why one nation or one man\r\nrises in intellect above his fellows. But we are supplied with a link in\r\nthe chain which connects the above effects with their cause, by the\r\nphysical organisation of the Greeks, who possessed the most perfect\r\nforms in which humanity ever appeared. Their frame exhibiting all the\r\nbeauty of which the human body is susceptible, uniting strength with\r\nlightness, dignity and elegance with activity, the utmost robustness of\r\nhealth with extreme delicacy of contour, the muscles developed by\r\nexercise, and developed over the whole structure alike, suggested the\r\nidea of power and indefatigable energy; the stature, generally above the\r\nmiddle size, the free and unembarrassed gait, the features[149] full of\r\nbeauty, the expression replete with intellect, and the eye flashing with\r\na consciousness of independence:—all these united conferred upon the\r\nform of the Greek an elevation, a grandeur, a majesty which we still\r\ncontemplate with admiration in their sculpture, and denominate the\r\nideal. Above all things, the form of the Grecian head was most\r\nexquisite, with its smooth, expansive, almost perpendicular forehead and\r\nmajestic outline, describing a perfect oval. Generally the complexion\r\nwas of a clear olive, the hair and eyes black, the temperament inclined\r\nto melancholy, though numerous instances occurred of sanguine fair\r\npersons with light eyes and chesnut or auburn hair, which the youth\r\nwore, as now, in a profusion of ringlets falling to the shoulders.\r\nInstances likewise occurred among the Greeks of individuals, who, like\r\nour own Chatterton, had eyes of different colours. Thus the poet\r\nThamyris[150] is said to have had one eye grey, the other black. Nay,\r\nthis peculiarity was even remarked among the inferior animals, more\r\nparticularly the horses.[151]\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Among the ancient Scythians an extraordinary uniformity of feature was\r\n  observable, as also among the Egyptians, (the same is the case at\r\n  present,) supposed to proceed, in the one case from the rigour, in the\r\n  other from the extreme heat, of the climate. Hippoc. de Aër. et Loc. §\r\n  91. But in every country, the climate being alike for all, the same\r\n  effect ought to be produced on the whole population. The similitude is\r\n  chiefly to be traced to the absence of all mixture with foreign races;\r\n  and the equal indevelopement of the mind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 141.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. de Gen. Anim. v. i.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic beauty of the nation displayed itself in every stage\r\nof life, only assuming new phases in its progress from the beauty of\r\ninfancy to the beauty of old age, inspiring the mingled feelings of love\r\nand admiration; and notwithstanding the effects of time, and\r\ninter-marriage with barbarous races, the same is the case still. For\r\nnowhere in Europe do we meet with infants so lovely, with youths so\r\nsoft, so virginal, so beautiful in their incipient manliness, with old\r\nmen so grave, stately, and with countenances so magnificent, as among\r\nthe living descendants of the Hellenes, whose destiny may yet be, one\r\nday, as enviable as their forms.\r\n\r\nTo push our enquiry one step further; it may be questioned, whether the\r\nglorious organisation we have been describing was not itself an effect\r\nof air, climate, and soil.[152] Certain at any rate it is, that the\r\natmosphere of Greece is clearer, purer, more buoyant and elastic, than\r\nthat of any other country in our hemisphere. At night, particularly,\r\nthere is a transparency in the air, which appears to impart additional\r\nlustre and magnitude to the stars and moon. Its mountain tops, the\r\nintervening space being, as it were, removed, seem to mingle with the\r\nconstellations which cluster in brightness on the edge of the horizon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Hippoc. de Aër. et Loc. § 125, seq. § 23, seq. Casaub. ad Theoph.\r\n  Char. p. 94. seq.\r\n\r\nA principal cause of this clearness and pellucidness is the great\r\nprevalence of the north wind,[153] which brings with it few or no\r\nvapours, but gathers together the clouds in heaps and rolls them from\r\nthe land towards the Mediterranean. The reason why this wind so often\r\nprevails may be discovered in the geographical configuration of the\r\ncountry, which is not, like Italy, divided from the rest of the\r\ncontinent by a range of Alps that might have screened it from the colder\r\nblasts, but lies open like an elevated threshing-floor, to be purged and\r\nwinnowed on all sides by the winds, which in many parts are so violent\r\nthat no tree can attain to any great height, while the stunted woods\r\nthrow all their branches in one direction, and the vines and other\r\nclimbing shrubs are laid prostrate along the rocks. These winds,\r\nhowever, prevail not constantly, but the southern and western breezes,\r\nblowing at intervals, bring along with them the warm atmosphere of Syria\r\nor Egypt, or the cooling freshness of the ocean. Another cause, which\r\ngreatly tends to promote the purity of the air, is the lightness,\r\nfriability, and dryness of the soil, which, distributed for the most\r\npart in thin layers over ledges of rocks, permits no stagnation of\r\nmoisture, but enables the rain that falls to trickle through, collect in\r\nrills and brooks, and find its way rapidly to the sea. The plains and\r\nirregular valleys, which form an exception to this rule, are not\r\nnumerous enough, or of sufficient magnitude to affect the general\r\nproposition. There appear, moreover, to be many peculiar properties and\r\nvirtues in the soil itself, causing all fruits transplanted thither to\r\nattain to speedy ripeness and superior flavour, while odoriferous plants\r\nand flowers, as the jasmine, the wild thyme, and the rose exhale sweeter\r\nand more delicious fragrance. This is more particularly the case in\r\nAttica, which accordingly produced in antiquity, where due care was\r\nbestowed on gardening and agriculture, the finest fruits and sweetest\r\nhoney in the world.[154]\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  This wind, wherever it prevails, increases the appetite; and the\r\n  Greeks were a hearty-eating people.—Aristot. Probl. xxvi. 45. The wind\r\n  Ornithias was often so cold as to strike birds dead on the wing.\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Ach. 842.\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. Probl. xx. 20. The black myrtle, which is much larger than\r\n  the white, grew wild about the hills. (xx. 36.) The southern breezes\r\n  were considered highly salutary to the plants of the Thriasian plain.\r\n  (xxvi. 18.)\r\n\r\nThe same qualities in soil and climate which affect vegetation, likewise\r\npowerfully influence the character and temperament of men and animals.\r\nIt is, for example, well known in the Levant, that the Bedouins\r\ninhabiting Arabia Proper and the Eastern Desert degenerate both in\r\ncharacter and physical organisation when transplanted to the Libyan\r\nwastes on the western banks of the Nile. But if particular soil and\r\nsituation engender particular diseases; if the air of fens and marshes\r\nblunt the senses and paralyse, to a certain degree, the intellectual\r\nfaculties, the converse of the proposition must also hold good; so that\r\nit is conceivable that the light soil and pure air of Greece may have\r\nproduced corresponding effects on the bodies and minds of its\r\ninhabitants. The experiment, in fact, is made daily; for strangers\r\narriving there with the germs of disease in their constitution, are, in\r\nmost cases, speedily destroyed by the force of the climate; while the\r\nhealthy and vigorous acquire the vivacity, the cheerfulness, the nervous\r\nand impetuous energy of the natives themselves, and, like them, extend\r\nthe term of life to its utmost span. Greece, indeed, has always been the\r\nhabitation of longevity; its philosophers in antiquity,—its monks,\r\nanchorites, and rural population in modern times, furnishing, perhaps,\r\nmore examples of extreme old age than could be found on the same extent\r\nof territory in any other part of the globe.\r\n\r\nNow this excess of vitality, this superabundance of the principle of\r\nlife, which constitutes what we intend by physical or moral energy,\r\nalmost inevitably produces, among an ill-governed, ill-educated people,\r\na large harvest of crime, and, accordingly, the modern Greeks have often\r\nbeen distinguished for audacious villany; the intrepid vigour of their\r\ncharacter, controlled neither by religion nor philosophy, easily\r\nbreaking through the restraints of tyranny and unjust laws in the chase\r\nafter power or excitement. That Frenchman spoke more truly than he\r\nthought, who said the Greeks were still the same “canaille” as in the\r\ndays of Themistocles: for, give them the same laws, the same education,\r\nthe same incentives to virtue and to heroism, and they will probably be\r\nagain as virtuous, as wise, and as heroic as their illustrious\r\nancestors. I judge in this way partly from my own experience, for I have\r\nseldom become acquainted with a Greek,—and I have known many,—who has\r\nnot improved upon acquaintance, won my esteem, and, in most cases, my\r\naffection, and impressed me with the firm belief that there is no nation\r\nin the varied population of Europe which, if ruled with wisdom and\r\njustice, would exhibit loftier or more exalted qualities. In these views\r\nI am happy to be borne out by the testimony of Monsieur Frederic\r\nThiersch, whose facilities for studying the modern Greek have been far\r\nmore ample than mine, and whose opinions are marked by the cautious\r\nacuteness of the statesman with the depth and originality of the\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\nIn alluding to the causes which pervert the feelings and misdirect the\r\nenergies of the existing race, I have touched also at the great source\r\nof crime among their ancestors,—I mean, defective laws and institutions;\r\nfor although the Greek character was, in force and excellence, all that\r\nI have said, and more, it, nevertheless, contained other elements than\r\nthose I have described, which it now becomes my duty to speak of. From a\r\nvery early period there existed in Greece two political parties,\r\nvariously denominated in various states, but upholding,—the one, the\r\ndoctrine that the many ought to be subjected to the few; the other, that\r\nthe few ought to be subjected to the many: in other words, the\r\noligarchical and democratical parties. From the struggles of these two\r\nfactions the internal history of Greece takes its form and colour, as to\r\nthem may be traced most of the fearful atrocities, in the shape of\r\nconspiracies, massacres, revolutions, which, instructing while they\r\nshock us, stain the Greek character with indelible blots.[155] Ambitious\r\nmen are nowhere scrupulous. To enjoy the delight imparted by the\r\nexercise of power, individuals have in all ages stifled the dictates of\r\nconscience; and where, as in modern Italy and in ancient Greece,\r\nnumerous small states border upon each other, sufficiently powerful to\r\ndream of conquest though too weak to achieve it, the number of the\r\nambitious is of necessity greatly multiplied. In proportion, however, to\r\nthe thirst of power in one class was the love of freedom and\r\nindependence in the other, so that the process of encroachment and\r\nresistance, of tyranny and rebellion, of usurpation and punishment, was\r\ncarried on perpetually,—the oligarchy now predominating, and cutting off\r\nor sending into exile the popular leaders, while the democratic party,\r\ntriumphing in its turn, inflicted similar sufferings on its enemies. By\r\ndegrees, moreover, there sprang up two renowned states to represent\r\nthese opposite principles, and the contests carried on by them assumed\r\nconsequently many characteristics of civil war,—its obstinacy, its\r\nbitterness, its revenge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  See the savage anecdote of Stratocles in Plutarch. Demet. § 12.\r\n\r\nIn these struggles seas of blood were shed, and crimes of the darkest\r\ndye perpetrated. Cities, once illustrious and opulent, were razed to the\r\nground; whole populations put to the sword or reduced to servitude;\r\nfertile plains rendered barren; men most renowned for capacity and\r\nvirtue made a prey to treachery or the basest envy; the morals of great\r\nstates corrupted, their glory eclipsed, their power undermined, and a\r\nway paved for the inroads of barbarian conquerors who ultimately put a\r\nperiod to the grandeur of the Hellenes.\r\n\r\nExamples without number might be collected of these horrors. It will be\r\nsufficient to advert briefly to a few, more to remind than to inform the\r\nreader. In the troubles of Corcyra[156] the nobles and the commons\r\nalternately triumphing over each other, carried on with the utmost\r\nruthlessness the work of extermination with abundant baseness and\r\nperfidy, some portion of which attached to the Athenian generals: the\r\nwrongs and sufferings inflicted by the Spartans on the brave but\r\nunfortunate inhabitants of Messenia, with the annual butchery of the\r\nHelots, the treacherous withdrawal of suppliants from sanctuary, and\r\ntheir subsequent slaughter,[157] the extermination of the people of\r\nHysia,[158] the precipitating of neutral merchants into pits,[159] the\r\nbetrayal of the cities of Chalcidice and the islands, the massacre in\r\ncold blood of the Platæans, of four thousand Athenians in the\r\nHellespont,[160] the reduction of innumerable cities to servitude: by\r\nthe Athenians, the extermination of the people of Melos,[161] the\r\nslaughter of a thousand Mitylenians, the cruelties at Skione, Ægina, and\r\nCythera;[162] but beyond these, and beyond all, the fearful excesses of\r\ncivil strife at Miletos where the common people called Gergithes having\r\nrisen in rebellion against the nobles and defeated them in battle, took\r\ntheir children and cast them into the cattle stalls where they were\r\ncrushed and trampled to death by the infuriated oxen; but the nobles\r\nrenewing the contest and obtaining ultimately the victory, seized upon\r\ntheir enemies,—men, women, children, and covered them with pitch, to\r\nwhich setting fire they burnt them alive.[163]\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. iii. 70. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. Var. Hist. vi. 7. Cf. Eurip.

Pont. ap. Athen. xii. 26.\r\n\r\nFrom these glimpses of guilt and suffering, we may learn to what\r\nextremes the Greek was sometimes hurried by passion and the thirst of\r\npower. But propensities so wolfish were not predominant in his\r\nnature.[164] On the contrary, in private life, even the Spartans and the\r\nDorians generally put off their cruel and severe habits, and relaxed on\r\nall proper occasions into joviality and mirth. In their social\r\nintercourse, in fact, few nations have been more cheerful or addicted to\r\njokes and pleasantry than the Greeks, and above all the Athenians, whose\r\nhours of leisure were one continued round of gossip, sport, and\r\nlaughter.[165] Never in any city were news-mongers, or even\r\nnews-forgers, so numerous. In the mouth of young and old no question was\r\nso frequent as, “What is the news?” These were the sounds that\r\ncirculated from rank to rank in the assembly of the people before the\r\norators began their harangues, that were bandied to and fro in the\r\nAgora, that filled by their incessant repetition the shops of barbers\r\nand perfumers.[166] Akin to this itching ear was the passion for show\r\nand magnificence, every man, from highest to lowest, affecting as far as\r\npossible spacious dwellings, superb furniture and costly apparel. Even\r\nthe bravest of the brave, the heroes of Marathon, were _petits-maîtres_\r\nat their toilette, and went forth to the field in purple cloaks, their\r\nhair curled, adorned with golden ornaments, and perfumed with essences.\r\nThe study of philosophy itself failed in most cases to subdue this\r\nostentatious spirit. Plato loved rich carpets and splendid raiment. Even\r\nAristotle was an exquisite, and Æschines an acknowledged coxcomb.\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Wink. Hist. de l’Art, i. 320. Thiersch, Etat. Act. de la Grèce, i.\r\n  p. 290. sqq; and for their disinterestedness, Pashley, Trav. in Crete,\r\n  i. 221.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  Loud laughter was nevertheless considered vulgar among the\r\n  Greeks.—Plat. Repub. t. vi. 112. The Athenians were addicted to the\r\n  language of shrugging and nodding, κ.τ.λ. To nod upwards was to deny,\r\n  downwards to confess. Sch. Aristoph. Ach. 112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  Aristotle says that the orators of Athens, who governed the people,\r\n  passed sometimes the whole of the day seeing mountebanks or jugglers,\r\n  or talking with those who had travelled as far as the Phasis or\r\n  Borysthenes; and that they never read anything save the Supper of\r\n  Philoxenos and that not all.—Athen. i. 10. It was in the opinion of\r\n  these persons perhaps, that “a great book was a great evil.”—Id. iii.\r\n  1.\r\n\r\nFrom several of these weaknesses the Spartans were free. They cared\r\nlittle for news, still less for dress, and less still for cleanliness;\r\nso that their beautiful long hair and waving beards swarmed with those\r\nautochthonal beasts, for the expulsion of which there was no law in\r\nSparta. Though neither a knowing nor cleanly race, however, their wit\r\nwas bright and piercing. No people uttered pithier or finer sayings, and\r\ntheir taste both in music and poetry was cultivated and refined.\r\nProbably, therefore, the dining halls and gymnasia and public walks of\r\nSparta were enlivened by as much mirth as those of any other Grecian\r\ncity, where usually cheerfulness was so prevalent, that “to be as merry\r\nas a Greek,” has become a proverb in all countries.\r\n\r\nOn the third period of the Greek character it is unnecessary to speak at\r\nany length. Most of their good qualities having departed with their\r\nfreedom they degenerated into a dissembling, hypocritical, fawning and\r\ndouble-dealing race, with little or no respect for truth, without\r\npatriotism, and without genuine valour. The literature, painting, and\r\nsculpture, to which in their period of degradation they gave birth, bore\r\nevident marks of their degeneracy, and tended by the corruption they\r\ndiffused to avenge them on their conquerors the Romans; whose minds and\r\nmorals they vitiated, and whose career of freedom and glory they cut\r\nshort. Through their vices, however, the fame of their more noble and\r\nvirtuous ancestors has greatly suffered, for the Romans contemplating\r\nthe Greeks they saw before them, and implanting their opinion throughout\r\nthe whole civilised world, their false and unjust views have been\r\nbequeathed to posterity; for it is still in a great measure through the\r\nRomans that people study the Greeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                         GEOGRAPHICAL OUTLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo render still clearer the point we have been insisting on in the\r\nforegoing chapter, it may be useful to take a rapid survey of the\r\ngeography of the country, and enter somewhat more at length into its\r\npeculiar configuration and productions.[167] Considered as a whole, the\r\nmost remarkable feature in the aspect of Greece consists in the great\r\nvariety of forms which its surface assumes in the territories of the\r\nnumerous little states into which the country was anciently divided. Of\r\nthese no two resemble each other, whether in physical structure, climate\r\nor productions; so that it may be said that in general the atmosphere of\r\nGreece is mild,[168] but not in every part, for within its narrow\r\nboundaries are found nearly all grades of temperature. The inhabitants\r\nof Elis and the valley of the Eurotas are exposed to a degree of heat\r\nlittle inferior to that of Egypt, while the settlers about Olympos,\r\nPindos and Dodona, with the rough goat-herds of Parnassos, Doris and the\r\nArcadian mountains experience the rigours of an almost Scandinavian\r\nwinter. In this extraordinary country the palm tree and the myrtle\r\nflourish within sight of the pine, the larch, and the silver fir of the\r\nnorth. In several of the islands and on parts of the continent certain\r\ntropical birds, as the peacock and the golden pheasant, have long been\r\nnaturalised, while in other districts snipes and woodcocks[169] appear\r\nearly; storms of sleet and hail are frequent, and the summits of\r\nmountains are capped with eternal snow.[170] A no very elevated range of\r\nhills separates the marsh miasmata and wit-withering fogs of\r\nBœotia,[171] the home of gluttony and stupidity, from the bland\r\ntransparent cheerful atmosphere and sweet wholesome soil of Attica,\r\nwhere, as a dwelling-place for man, earth has reached her highest\r\nculminating point of excellence, and where, accordingly, her noblest\r\nfruits, wisdom and beauty, have ripened most kindly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Hermann, Pol. Ant. § 6. Müll. Dor. ii. 425.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Varro gave the preference to the soil and climate of Italy, where\r\n  everything good was produced in perfection. He thought no barley to be\r\n  compared with the Campanian, no wheat with the Apulian, no rye with\r\n  the Falernian, no oil with the Venafran. The whole country was so\r\n  thickly planted with trees that it seemed to be an orchard. Not even\r\n  Phrygia itself abounded more in vineyards; nor was Argos so fertile as\r\n  parts of Italy, though it was said to produce from ten to fifteen\r\n  pipes the juger. De Re Rustica, i. 2. p. 46. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  “Woodcocks and snipes, I am informed, visited the neighbourhood of\r\n  Attica during the winter in considerable quantities. I heard the\r\n  curlew and the red shank cry along the marsh to the right of the\r\n  Piræus.” Sibth. in Walp.

But descending the Ionian sea, and doubling\r\nCape Crio, the south westernmost promontory of Crete, the approach\r\ntowards the tropics is felt both in the air and in the landscape. The\r\nnights are beyond description lovely, the stars appear with increased\r\nsize and brilliancy,[172] and morning spreads over both land and wave a\r\nbeauty but faintly reflected even in poetry. Every rock and headland,\r\nclothed with the double light of mythology and the sun, emerges from the\r\nobscurities of the dawn glittering with dew and fresh as at the\r\ncreation. The slopes of the mountains, feathered with hanging woods,\r\nlead the eye upwards to those aspiring peaks, the cradle of many a\r\nHellenic legend, where snows pale and shining as those of Mont\r\nBlanc,[173] descending on all sides in wavy gradations to meet the\r\nforests, rest for ever, and at the opening and the close of day exhibit\r\nthat crimson blush which we observe among the higher Alps. All the\r\nlowlands at their base are meantime covered, perhaps, with heavy mists,\r\nwhile lighter and more fleecy vapours hang here and there upon the\r\nmountain tops, augmenting their grandeur by allowing the imagination\r\nlike a Titan to pile them up as high as it pleases towards heaven. The\r\ncoasts of eastern Hellas, including those of Eubœa, along the whole line\r\nof Thessaly to the confines of Macedonia, are bold and rocky, frowning\r\nlike the ramparts of freedom upon the slaves of the Asiatic plains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  I never saw the Pleiades appear so large as on the coast of Messenia.\r\n  See Coray, Disc. Prel. ad Hipp. de Aër. et Loc. § 115.\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  Even the Cheviot hills are sometimes (as in 1838) covered all the\r\n  summer with patches of snow, on which occasions the peasants are said\r\n  to pay no rent. _Tyne Mercury_, July 1, 1838.\r\n\r\nTraversed in almost every direction by mountain chains infinitely\r\nramified and towering in many places to a vast height, Greece has,\r\nlikewise, its elevated table-lands, lakes, bogs, morasses, with\r\nextensive open downs and heaths. Lying between the thirty-sixth and\r\nforty-first degrees of north latitude, and excepting on the Illyrian and\r\nMacedonian frontier everywhere surrounded by the sea, it may in many\r\nrespects be said to enjoy the most advantageous position on the globe.\r\nFrom the barbarian countries of Macedonia and Illyria it is divided by a\r\nseries of contiguous mountain ridges, which commencing with Olympos,\r\n(covered all the year round with snow, amid which the poet Orpheus[174]\r\nwas interred,) and including the Cambunian range, with the lofty peak of\r\nLacmos, stretches westward across the continent, and terminates in the\r\nstormy Acroceraunian promontory. The most northern provinces of Hellas,\r\nimmediately within this boundary and west of the Pindos range, were\r\nChaonia and Molossia, and towards the east Thessaly—a circular valley of\r\nexceeding fertility, encompassed by chains of lofty mountains. This\r\nprovince contains the largest and richest plains in Greece; and many of\r\nthe names most hallowed by its religious traditions and most renowned in\r\npoetry, belong to Thessaly. Here, in fact, was the supposed cradle of\r\nthe Hellenes. From hence sailed the Argo and incomparably the greatest\r\nof all the heroes who fought at Troy\r\n\r\n                     “—--mixed with auxiliar gods.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  Paus. ix. 30. 9.

Protrept. c. xi. t. i. p. 16.\r\n  From the blood of this man sprang the herb parsley.\r\n\r\nThe geography of Thessaly is remarkable. According to a tradition\r\nalready mentioned it was once a mountain-girt lake, the waters of which\r\naugmented by unusual rains burst their stupendous barriers and tore\r\nthemselves a way through opposing rocks to the sea. Among the tribes of\r\nnorthern Hindùstân a similar tradition prevails respecting the formation\r\nof the Vale of Kashmèr; and whether in these cases the voice of fame has\r\npreserved or not an historical truth, such events may be regarded as not\r\nimprobable in countries abounding with mountain lakes whose beds lie\r\nconsiderably above the level of the sea. The lofty ridge which skirts\r\nthe shores of the Ægæan, and is said to have been rent in remote\r\nantiquity by the waters of the lake, presents a highly varied aspect to\r\nthe approaching mariner. First on sailing northward Pelion comes in\r\nsight: a broad ridge rising from the waves like a huge uncrenalated\r\nwall, and covered in Homeric times with fiercely waving woods. To this\r\nsucceeds Ossa, with its steep conical peak, clothed with durable snows\r\nand divided by a narrow dusky gap from Olympos. This gap is Tempe,[175]\r\nwhose savage beauties poets and sophists have vied with each other in\r\ndescribing, though the reality is still finer than their pictures. On\r\nentering the defiles of the mountains a narrow glen hemmed in by\r\nprecipitous rocks, bare in some places, in others verdant with hanging\r\noaks, receives the waters of the Peneios, which, like the Rhone at St.\r\nMaurice and the Nile at Silsilis, in some places fill up the whole\r\nbreadth of the pass, leaving scarcely room for a straitened road carried\r\nover rocky ledges. Farther on they diffuse themselves over a broad\r\npebbly bed, and narrow prospects are opened up through woody vistas into\r\nsoft pastural recesses, carpeted with emerald turf, and perfumed with\r\nflowers and shrubs of the richest fragrance. Anon the vale contracts\r\nagain, gloomy cliffs frown over the stream and sadden its surface with\r\ntheir shadows, until at length the whole chain is traversed and the\r\nPeneios precipitates its laughing waters into the Ægæan.[176] Crossing\r\nthe great range of Pindos we enter Epeiros,[177] a country anciently\r\ndivided into many provinces, and partly inhabited by semi-barbarous\r\ntribes, where on the borders of a lake singularly beautiful and\r\npicturesque stood the fane and oracle of Dodonæan Zeus. Homer,\r\naccustomed to the mild skies of Ionia, speaks of its climate as rude and\r\nsevere. But Byron, born among the hungry rocks of Caledonia, and\r\nhabituated to the savage features of the north, was smitten with its\r\nwild charms, and thus describes one of the scenes in the neighbourhood\r\nnear the sources of the Acheron.\r\n\r\n        Monastic Zitza, from thy shady brow,\r\n        Thou small but favoured spot of holy ground,\r\n        Where’er we gaze,—around, above, below,\r\n        What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!\r\n        Rock, river, forest, mountain,—all abound;\r\n        And bluest skies that harmonize the whole.\r\n        Beneath, the distant torrent’s rushing sound\r\n        Tells where the volumed cataract doth roll\r\n      Between those hanging rocks which shock yet please the soul.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Æl.

In the latter case, he observes, the\r\n  air, thick and whitish, is reflected from the surface of the turbid\r\n  waters; while, in the Ægæan, the sea, transparent to a great depth,\r\n  reflects the bright rich colour of the sky.—Prob. xxiii. 6. He adds\r\n  that the sea is more transparent during the prevalence of the north\r\n  wind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  Though this country be not generally included by geographers within\r\n  the limits of Hellas, I have considered it as a part of Greece,\r\n  because Homer evidently so thought it.

On\r\na point of the Acarnanian shore[178] in the mouth of the Ambracian gulf,\r\nthe Commonwealth of Rome which had foundered so many rival states\r\nsuffered final shipwreck, and the shores of avenged Hellas were strewed\r\nwith the wrecks of Roman freedom. Ætolia, Doris, Locris, Phocis, in\r\nwhich was the mystic navel of Gaia,[179] and the deep valley of Bœotia,\r\ndivided from each other by mountains or by considerable rivers, minutely\r\nintersected by streams, and broken up into a perpetual succession of\r\nhill and dale, conduct us southward to the Corinthian Gulf and the\r\nborders of Attica.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  Where stood a celebrated Temple of Apollo.—Thucyd. i. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  The “rocky Pytho” afterwards Delphi. Iliad, β. 519.\r\n\r\nReserving this illustrious division of Hellas, and Megaris which\r\noriginally formed a part of it, for the close of our rapid outline, we\r\nenter the Peloponnesos,—a country remarkable both for its physical\r\nconfiguration, and for the races which anciently inhabited it. Connected\r\nwith the continent by the narrow isthmus of Corinth it immediately\r\nexpands westward and southward into a peninsula of large dimensions, in\r\nform resembling a ragged plantain leaf or outstretched palm.[180] Like\r\nthe northern division of Hellas the Peloponnesos is rough with mountain\r\nchains, and belted round with cliffs. Towards the centre it swells into\r\na lofty plateau, known to antiquity under the name of Arcadia. Foreign\r\npoets, misapprehending the nature of the country, have described this\r\nprovince as a succession of soft pastoral scenes.[181] But its real\r\ncharacter is very different, consisting chiefly of an extensive\r\ntable-land, supported by vast mountain buttresses, which in some places\r\ntower into peaks of extraordinary elevation. It is broken up into\r\ninnumerable valleys and deep glens, overhung with wild precipitous\r\nrocks, clothed with gloomy forests, and buried during a great part of\r\nthe year in clouds and snow. The inhabitants were rough and unpromising\r\nas the soil, distinguished like the modern Swiss for no quality but\r\nbravery, which, like them too, they sold with a mercenary recklessness\r\nto the best bidder.[182] Achaia is a slip of sea-coast sloping towards\r\nthe north. Elis, a succession of beautiful plains with few eminences\r\nintervening, well watered and renowned for their fine breed of mares.\r\nThis, the Holy land of the Hellenes, sacred every rood to Zeus, was to\r\nthe Greeks a place of pilgrimage, as Mecca to the Arabs and Palestine to\r\nthe Christians of the West. In the Homeric age it was confined within\r\nnarrow limits, its sea-coast only extending from Buprasion to the\r\npromontory of Hyrminè, scarcely indeed, so far, as Myrsinos is said to\r\nbe its last city towards the north, and Buprasion is mentioned rather as\r\na separate state. It was divided from Achaia by Mount Scollis, which\r\nHomer calls “the rock Olenia,” and Aleision is the boundary to the\r\nsouth; consequently, neither Mount Pholöe nor Olympia, nor the Alpheios\r\nwas then included in Elis, still less Triphylia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Strb. viii. 2. 140.

He observes that the winds, blowing in from the sea, were\r\n  not colder there than in other parts of Greece; but that during calms\r\n  the exhalations from the stagnant waters were particularly chill. See\r\n  also Hippoc. de Aër. et Loc. § 120.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Steph. Byzant. _v._ Ἀρκας. p. 166. b. seq.\r\n\r\nArgolis, on the opposite side of the peninsula, is traversed by a broad\r\nridge of hills, which, branching off from Mount Cyllene and Parthenion\r\nin Arcadia, abounds in deep ravines and spacious natural caverns. It\r\ncontains, however, several plains of much fertility; but, though marshy\r\nand subject to malaria, the neighbourhood of the capital is deficient in\r\ngood water. The fame of Argos[183] rests almost wholly on a fabulous\r\nbasis: it was great in the infancy of Greece; it took the lead in the\r\nTrojan war; but, with the irruption of the half-barbarous Dorians into\r\nthe Peloponnesos, the glory of the old heroic race\r\n\r\n                   “that fought at Thebes and Ilion,”\r\n\r\nwaned visibly, and Argos and its twin city, Mycenæ, sank into\r\ncomparative insignificance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Il. β. 559. Mases, an Argive city, is mentioned by Homer in\r\n  conjunction with Ægina, which island also belonged at that time to\r\n  Argos. This place, in later ages, was the harbour of the\r\n  Hermioneans.—Pausan. ii. 36, 83. Cf. Müll. Æginet. p. 85.\r\n\r\nLaconia consists of a hollow valley, enclosed between two mountain\r\nchains, proceeding from the great Arcadian barrier, Parnon and Kronios,\r\nand stretching southward to the sea. Down the centre of this vale flows\r\nthe Eurotas, whose sources lie above Belemina, among the steep recesses\r\nof Taygetos.[184] Though enlarged by several tributary brooks, it\r\npreserves, until some way below Sparta, the character of a mountain\r\ntorrent; but after precipitating itself in a romantic sparkling cascade,\r\nappears for some time to be lost in a morass. Escaping, however, from\r\nthe swamp, it flows during the remainder of its course over a firm\r\ngravelly bed to the Laconian gulf. Immediately above Sparta the valley\r\nnarrows exceedingly; but, at this point, the hills receding suddenly on\r\nboth sides, sweep round a small circular plain, and, a short distance\r\nbelow the city, again approach, and press upon the bed of the\r\nEurotas.[185] The site of Sparta, therefore, resembles on a small scale\r\nthat of the Egyptian Thebes, which is similarly hemmed round by the\r\nArabian and Libyan mountains. It follows, too, that the condition of the\r\natmosphere must to a certain extent be alike in both places; for the\r\nridges of Taygetos and Thornax rising to a great height, not only\r\nintercept the cooler breezes from the west and north, but, bending\r\namphitheatrically round the plain, concentrate the sun’s rays, which,\r\nbeing bare and rocky, they reflect with great force. In summer,\r\ntherefore, the heat is intense: in winter, on the other hand, their\r\ngreat elevation suffices morning and evening to exclude the slanting\r\nbeams, thus causing a degree of cold little inferior, perhaps, to what\r\nis felt in the highlands of Arcadia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  This mountain (which in one place Vibius Sequester converts into a\r\n  river, p. 19, Cf.

Thiersch, Etat Actuel de la Grèce, i. 287, who\r\n  gives the following romantic glimpse of the Laconian valley:—“Oh! que\r\n  ce pays était beau, lorsqu’au mois de Mai 1832, nous traversâmes ses\r\n  ravissantes vallées au milieu des montagnes de la Laconie, et ses\r\n  villages situés au bord de ruisseaux limpides et entourés d’arbres\r\n  fruitiers tout en fleurs! Quelle était belle cette terre, lorsque, le\r\n  soir, revenant des ruines de Sparte à Mistra, nous étions comme\r\n  baignés de ces parfums qu’exhalent les orangers qui remplissent la\r\n  plaine, et rafraichis par la brise délicieuse descendue des montagnes\r\n  majestueuses du Taygète, dont les cimes, encore couvertes de neige,\r\n  semblaient toucher le ciel parsemé d’étoiles! Nôtre sommeil fut\r\n  interrompu la nuit par le chant mélodieux d’une troupe de rossignols.”\r\n\r\nBut though lofty and bleak, the uplands of Laconia are not incapable of\r\ncultivation, and in many places were anciently covered with forests of\r\nplane trees. Their eastern slopes were likewise clothed with vines,\r\nirrigated, as in Switzerland and Burgundy, by small rills, conducted\r\nthrough artificial channels from springs high up in the mountains.[186]\r\nThe summits of Taygetos are waste and wild; rent and shattered by\r\nfrequent earthquakes, lashed by rain-storms, and here and there bored\r\nand undermined by gnawing streams, working their way to the valley, it\r\npresents the aspect of a fragment of nature in its decrepitude. South,\r\nhowever, of Mount Evoras the country opens into a plain of considerable\r\nfertility, extending eastward towards Mount Zarax and the sea. On the\r\nMessenian frontier, also, are many valleys highly productive. This\r\nportion of Lacedæmon obtained in the time of Augustus the name, given\r\nperhaps in mockery, of the land of the Eleuthero Lacones, or “Free\r\nLaconians.”[187]\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Aleman, ap. Athen. i. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Strab. viii. 6. p. 190. Paus. iii. 21. 6.\r\n\r\nProtected on the land side by mountains difficult to be traversed, and\r\npresenting towards the sea an inhospitable harbourless coast, Laconia\r\nseems marked out by nature to be the abode of an unsocial people. Like\r\nthat of many Swiss cantons, its climate is generally harsh and rude,\r\nvexed by cold winds alternating with burning heats, and appears to\r\ncommunicate analogous qualities to the minds of its inhabitants, who\r\nhave been in all ages remarkable for valour untempered by humanity. In\r\nsuch a country the nobler arts can never be completely naturalised. The\r\nvirus imbibed from nature will find its way into the character, and defy\r\nthe influence of culture and of government.\r\n\r\nMessenia presents, in every respect, a contrast to Laconia. Along the\r\nsea-coast, indeed, particularly from Pylos to Cape Aeritas, its\r\nbarrenness is complete; neither woods nor thickets, nor any vestige of\r\nverdure being visible upon the red cinder-like precipices beetling over\r\nthe sea, or sloping off into grey mountains above. But having passed\r\nthis Alpine barrier, we find the land sinking down into rich plains,\r\nwhich on the banks of the broad Pamisos were anciently, for their\r\nluxuriant fertility,[188] denominated “the Happy.” North, and about the\r\nsources of the Balyra, the Amphitos, and the Neda the scenery grows\r\nhighly romantic and picturesque, the eye commanding from almost every\r\nelevated point innumerable narrow meandering glens, each with its\r\nbubbling streamlet circling round green eminences, clothed to their\r\nsummits with hanging woods. Messenia, which, as soon inhabited, must\r\nhave been wealthy, appears to have been a favourite resort of poets in\r\nremote antiquity. Here the Thracian Thamyris, in a contest, as was\r\nfabled, with the Muses, lost his sight, together with the gift of song;\r\nand in a small rocky island on its coast,—the haunt, when I saw it, of\r\nsea-mews and cormorants,—Sparta received from an Athenian general of\r\nmean abilities one of the most galling defeats recorded in her annals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sibth. in Walp. Mem. i. 60.\r\n\r\nReturning out of the Peloponnesos by way of the Isthmos, and quitting at\r\nthe Laconian rocks the territories of Corinth, we enter the\r\nMegaris,[189] originally, as I have before observed, a part of the\r\nAthenian territories. Attica is a triangular promontory, of small\r\nextent, projecting into the Myrtöan sea, between Argolis and Eubœa. A\r\nmountain chain, of no great elevation, forms, under several names, the\r\nboundary between this country and Bœotia; and Mount Kerata, in later\r\ntimes, divided it from Megaris. On every other side Attica is washed by\r\nthe sea, which, together with nearly all the circumjacent islands, was,\r\nin antiquity, regarded as a part of its empire.[190] This minute\r\ndivision of Greece, fertile in nothing but great men, is seldom viewed\r\nwith any eye to the picturesque. Satisfied that Athens stood there, we\r\ncommonly ask no more. Genius has breathed over it a perfume sweeter than\r\nthe thyme of its own hills,—has painted it with a beauty surpassing that\r\nof earth,—rendered its atmosphere redolent for ever of human greatness\r\nand human glory,—and cast so dazzling an illusion over its very dust and\r\nruins, that they appear more beautiful than the richest scenes and most\r\nperfect structures of other lands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  Strab. ix. i. p. 232.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  Strab. ix. 1. Philoch. Siebel. p. 28.\r\n\r\nIndependently, however, of its historical importance, Attica is invested\r\nwith numerous charms. Consisting of an endless succession of hill and\r\ndale,[191] with many small plains interspersed; and swelling towards its\r\nnorthern frontier into considerable mountains, it presents a miniature\r\nof the whole Hellenic land.[192] In antiquity its uplands and ravines\r\nand secluded hollows were clothed with wood,—oaks, white poplars, wild\r\nolive-trees, or melancholy pines. The arbutus, the agnus castus, wild\r\npear, heath, lentisk, and other flowering shrubs decked its hill-sides\r\nand glens; on the brow of every eminence wild thyme, sweet marjoram,\r\nwith many different kinds of odoriferous plants exhaled their fragrance\r\nbeneath the foot;[193] while rills of the clearest and sweetest water in\r\nthe world, leaped down the rocks, or conducted their sparkling currents\r\nthrough its romantic and richly cultivated valleys. Southward, among the\r\nmountains of scoriæ of the mining district, springs of silver[194] may\r\nbe said to have usurped the place of fountains. The face of the country\r\nis nearly everywhere arid and barren,—the plains are parched,—the\r\ngullies encumbered with loose shingle,—the eminences unpicturesque and\r\ndreary; yet wherever vegetation takes place, the virtue of the Attic\r\nsoil displays itself in the production of fragrant flowers, whence the\r\nbee extracts the most delicious honey in the world, superior in quality\r\nto that of Hybla or Hymettos.\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  Mardonius, in fact, found Attica too hilly for the operations of\r\n  cavalry:—οὔτε ἱππασίμη ἡ χώρη ἦν ἡ Ἀττική.—Herod. ix. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  See, in Plato’s Critias, t. vii. p. 153. the eulogium of its beauty\r\n  and fertility. At present “the plain of Attica, if we except the\r\n  olive-tree, is extremely destitute of wood, and we observed, on our\r\n  return, the peasants driving home their asses laden with Passerina\r\n  hirsuta for fuel.”—Sibthorp in Mitchell, Knights, p. 155. But the\r\n  description by no means applies to the whole country. At the foot of\r\n  Cithæron there are still forests four hours in length.—Sibth. in Walp.\r\n  Mem. i. 64.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  This is accounted for by the dryness and purity of the atmosphere;\r\n  for, as Pliny remarks, “hortensiorum odoratissima quæ sicca; ut ruta,\r\n  mentha, apium, et quæ in siccis nascantur.”—Hist. Nat. xxi. 18. p. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Ἀργύρου πηγή τις αὐτοῖς ἐστι, βησαυρὸς χθονός.—Æschyl. Pers. 238. In\r\n  all countries the waters of mining cantons are bad.—Hippocr. de Aër.\r\n  et Loc. § 35.\r\n\r\nComparative barrenness may, however, upon the whole, be considered as\r\ncharacteristic of Attica. Indeed, Plato,[195] in a very curious passage,\r\nlikens to a body emaciated by sickness the hungry district round the\r\ncapital, where the soil has collapsed about the rocks. But from this\r\ninnumerable advantages have arisen. The earth being light and porous\r\npermits whatever rain falls immediately to sink and disappear, as in\r\nProvence,[196] which, more than any other part of Europe, resembles\r\nAttica. Hence, except in some few inconsiderable spots,[197] no bogs, no\r\nmarshes exist to poison the air with cold effluvia: a ridge of mountains\r\nprotects it against the northern blasts: mild breezes from the ocean\r\nprevail in almost all seasons: snow seldom lies above a few hours on the\r\nground. The atmosphere, accordingly, kept constantly free from terrene\r\nexhalations, is buoyant and sparkling as on the Libyan desert, when, at\r\nnoon, every elevated rock appears to be encircled by a luminous\r\nhalo.[198] In air so pure the act of breathing is a luxury which\r\nproduces a smile of satisfaction on the countenance; the mind performs\r\nits operations with ease and rapidity; and life, everywhere sweet,\r\nappears to have a finer relish than in countries exposed to watery and\r\nunwholesome fogs. It was perfectly philosophical, therefore, in\r\nPlato,[199] to regard Attica as a place designed by nature to bring the\r\nhuman intellect to the greatest ripeness and perfection, a quality\r\nextended by Aristotle to Greece at large. The same atmospheric\r\nproperties were favourable to health and long life, warding off many\r\ndisorders common in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  Critias, t. vii. p. 154.

Following up this idea, we must\r\nunquestionably pronounce Athens to have been the head, the seat of\r\nthought, the place where its arts and its wisdom ripened. But ere we\r\ntouch upon the capital, which cannot be slided over with a cursory\r\nremark, it will be necessary to enter into some little detail respecting\r\nthe demi or country towns of Attica,[201] of which in the flourishing\r\ntimes of the republic there existed upwards of one hundred and\r\nseventy-four. Of these small municipal communities, of which too little\r\nis known, several were places of considerable importance, possessing\r\ntheir temples, their Agoræ, their theatres, filled with walks and\r\nsurrounded by impregnable fortifications. The Athenians regarded Athens,\r\nindeed, as the Hebrews did Jerusalem, in the light of their great and\r\nholy city, the sanctuary of their religion and of their freedom. But\r\nthis did not prevent their preferring the calm simplicity of a country\r\nlife to the noisier pleasures of the town. Many distinguished families,\r\naccordingly, had houses in these demi, or villas in their vicinity.\r\nHere, also, several of the greatest men of Athens were born: Thucydides\r\nwas a native of Halimos,[202] Sophocles of Colonos, Epicurus of\r\nGargettos, Plato of Ægina, Xenophon of Erchia, Tyrtæos, Harmodios, and\r\nAristogeiton of Aphidnæ, Antiphon of Rhamnos, and Æschylus of Eleusis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  Müll. Dor. i. 76.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  See Col. Leake, Trans. Roy. Soc. Lit. i. 114–283.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  Poppo, Prolegg. in Thucyd. i. 22.\r\n\r\nIn other points of view, also, the towns and villages of Attica\r\npossessed great interest. They long continued to be the seats of the\r\nprimitive worship of the country, where the tutelar deities of\r\nparticular districts, of earth-born race, were adored with that\r\naffectionate faith and that fervency of devotion which peculiarly belong\r\nto small religious communities. The gods they worshipped appeared almost\r\nto be their fellow citizens, and to exist only for their protection. In\r\nfact, they were the patron saints of the villages. Fabulous legends and\r\nhistorical traditions combined with religion to shed celebrity over the\r\nAttic demi. There was hardly in the whole land a single inhabited spot\r\nwhich did not figure in their poetry or in their annals as the scene of\r\nsome memorable exploit. Aphidnæ[203] was renowned, for example, as the\r\nplace whence the Dioscuri bore away their sister Helen, after her rape\r\nby Theseus, in revenge for which the youthful heroes devastated the\r\nwhole district. “Grey Marathon,”[204] as Byron aptly terms it, was\r\nembalmed for ever in Persian blood, and rendered holy by the vast\r\nbarrows raised there by the state over the ashes of its fallen warriors.\r\nRhamnos on the Attic Dardanelles became famous for its statue of\r\nNemesis, originally of Aphrodite, the work of Diodotos or Agoracritos of\r\nParos, not unworthy to be compared for size and beauty with the\r\nproductions of Pheidias. The irruption of the Peloponnesians conferred a\r\nmelancholy celebrity on Deceleia,[205] and Phylæ obtained a place in\r\nhistory as the stronghold where Thrasybulos gathered together the small\r\nbut gallant band which avenged the cause of freedom upon the thirty. Of\r\nEleusis,[206] it is enough to say that there the ceremonies of\r\ninitiation into the mysteries were performed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 17. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 32. 3. sqq. “We observed the long-legged plover near\r\n  Marathon; the grey plover and the sand plover on the eastern coast of\r\n  Attica.” Sibth.

Protrept. § 2. t. i. p. 16. seq. where he relates the\r\n  story of Demeter and Baubo.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Megara, like Athens, stood a short distance from the sea;\r\nbut was joined by long walls to its harbour Nisæa, protected from the\r\nweather by the Minoan promontory. In sailing thence to the Peiræeus we\r\npass several islands, none of which, however, are of any magnitude, save\r\nSalamis, in remote antiquity a separate state governed by its own laws.\r\nThe old capital, already deserted in the time of Strabo, stood on the\r\nsouthern coast over against Ægina; but the principal town of later times\r\nwas situated on a bay at the root of a tongue of land projecting toward\r\nthat part of Attica[207] where Xerxes sat to behold his imperial armada\r\nannihilated by the republicans of Hellas. Salamis was known of old under\r\nvarious names,—Skiras, Cychræa and Pituoussa, from the Pitus, or pine\r\ntree, by which its rocks and glens were in many places shaded.\r\nImmediately before the engagement in which his navy was destroyed, the\r\nPersian monarch sought to unite Salamis to the continent by a dam two\r\nstadia in length; his project, had it succeeded, would have ruined the\r\nferrymen of Amphialè, a class of individuals whose operations Solon\r\njudged of sufficient importance to be regulated by a particular article\r\nin his code. Of the smaller islets that form the outworks of the Attic\r\ncoast, little need be said, since they were nearly all barren, and\r\ninhabited only by a few legendary traditions. The tomb of Circe was\r\nshown on the larger of the Pharmacoussæ; and the island of Helena, east\r\nof the Samian promontory obtained the reputation of having been the spot\r\nwhere the faithless queen of Menelaus consummated her guilt.[208]\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  On one of the projecting roots of Mount Ægaleus, which anciently,\r\n  according to Statius, was well-wooded, and clothed like Hymettos with\r\n  thyme.—Theb. xii. 631. Suid. _v._ Μᾶσσον. This mountain produced\r\n  likewise an abundance of figs (Theoc. Eidyll. i. 147), which were\r\n  considered the best in Attica.—Athen. xiv. 66. Meurs. Rel.

Strab. ix. 1. p. 245.—Pausanias (i. 35. 1) has\r\n  preserved another tradition representing Helen as landing here on her\r\n  return from Troy.—Chandler, ii. 7.\r\n\r\nÆgina belonged to Attica only by conquest; but as when subdued its\r\nsubjection was complete and lasting, it must not be altogether omitted\r\nin this glance over the home territories of the Great Demos. Like Attica\r\nitself, the island lying in the Saronic Gulf is of a triangular shape.\r\nBy proximity it belongs to the Peloponnesos, being within thirty stadia\r\nof the Methanæan Chersonesos, while to Salamis is a voyage of ninety\r\nstadia, and to the Peiræeus one hundred and twenty. But the sea itself\r\nhaving been considered a part of Attica, whose flag, like that of\r\nEngland, streamed for ages triumphantly over its billows, the islands\r\nalso which it surrounded fell one by one into the hands of the people,\r\nand this small Doric isle among the rest. A number of diminutive islets,\r\nor rather rocks, cluster round the shores of Ægina, some barren and\r\ntreeless, others indued with a certain degree of fertility and verdant\r\nwith pine woods.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable objects in Ægina were placed at the angles of the\r\nisland. The city and harbour towards the west, on the east looking\r\ntowards Attica the temple of Athena, and, near its southern extremity,\r\n“a magnificent conical mountain, which from its grandeur, its form, and\r\nits historical recollections, is the most remarkable among the natural\r\nfeatures of Ægina.”[209] An eminence so lofty and in shape so beautiful\r\nwould naturally be an object of much interest in so small an island. The\r\nlocal superstitions would necessarily cluster round it, as around Ida in\r\nCrete and Olympos in Thessaly. Accordingly on the summit of this\r\nmountain the fables of Ægina represent King Æacos praying, in the name\r\nof the whole Hellenic nation, to Zeus for rain, as the prophet prayed\r\nfor the Israelites, and with equal success. Here, therefore, a recent\r\ntraveller has with great judgment fixed the site of the Panhellenion,\r\nnear the spot where a chapel, dedicated to the prophet Elias, now\r\nstands. In dimensions Ægina, according to Scylax, ranked twelfth among\r\nthe isles of Hellas. Strabo attributes to it a circumference of one\r\nhundred and eighty stadia; but Sir William Gell, in his Argolis,[210]\r\nconsiders its perimeter, not including the fluctuations of the bays and\r\ncreeks, to be not less than two hundred and ten stadia, and its square\r\ncontents three thousand one hundred and sixty-four stadia, or forty-one\r\nsquare miles.[211] The interior is rocky, rough, and perforated with\r\ncaverns, in which, according to fabulous legends, the Myrmidons resided,\r\nand Chabrias afterwards lay in ambush for the Spartan Gorgopos and his\r\nÆginetan allies.[212] A light thin soil nourishes but sparing vegetation\r\non the mountains, but several of the small valleys, filled with earth\r\nwashed down by rains from the uplands, are rich and fertile, watered by\r\nsprings and rivulets, and beautified with groves of imperishable\r\nverdure.[213]\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  Wordsworth, Athens and Attica, p. 262.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  Ib. 28. ap.

An examination of their statements might still,\r\nperhaps, be interesting; but it would lead me far beside the scope of my\r\npresent work, and occupy space that can be better filled up. According\r\nto the most careful calculation Attica contained seven hundred and\r\ntwenty square miles, or taking into account the island of Salamis seven\r\nhundred and forty-eight. The whole of this extremely limited space\r\nswarmed, however, with population; for even so late[214] as 317 B. C.\r\nafter all the calamities which the republic had undergone, Attica still\r\ncontained five hundred and twenty-seven thousand six hundred and sixty\r\npersons, or nearly seven hundred and seventy-three to the square mile, a\r\nproportion much higher than is found in the most thickly peopled\r\ncounties of England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  Clint.

But in what is related of the\r\npopulation of Ægina, the calculations current among learned authors are\r\nso extravagant as to exceed all belief. Müller and Boeckh,[215] who on\r\nother occasions, and sometimes very unseasonably affect scepticism,\r\nunhesitatingly admit the account in Athenæus, which attributes four\r\nhundred and seventy thousand slaves to the Æginetans.[216] To these the\r\nformer adds a free population of forty thousand, making the whole amount\r\nto upwards of half a million, or twelve thousand four hundred and\r\nfifty-seven to the square mile. Mr. Clinton,[217] clearly perceiving the\r\nabsurdity of this calculation, proposes to read seventy thousand, which\r\nwill leave a population in the proportion of two thousand six hundred\r\nand eighty-two to the square mile. The passage in Athenæus is no doubt,\r\nas Bochart suspects,[218] corrupt, and this being the case nothing is\r\nleft but to determine from analogy the population of Ægina, which,\r\nsupposing it equally dense with that of Attica would have amounted to\r\nsomething more than thirty thousand souls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  Æginet. 128.

In\r\nthe other little could be discovered indicative of imaginative power, of\r\nthe thirst to create, of the yearning of the mind after the ideal, of\r\nthe desire of genius to breathe a soul into stone, to live and obtain a\r\nperpetuity of existence in the works of its own hands, to gaze on its\r\nown beauty reflected on all sides from its own creations as from a\r\nconcave mirror. At Athens everything public, everything which had\r\nreference to the united efforts of the people wore an air of grandeur.\r\nThe Acropolis inhabited only by the gods appeared worthy to be the\r\ndwelling place of immortal beings: all the poetry of architecture was\r\nthere; it seemed to have owed its birth to a concentration of the best\r\nreligious spirit of the ancient world, aiming at giving earth a\r\nresemblance to heaven; at peopling it with mute deities, speaking only\r\nthrough their beauty and surrounding these representatives of the\r\ninvisible Olympos with everything most excellent, most valuable, most\r\ncherished among men. At Sparta a spirit of calculating economy entered\r\ninto the very worship of the gods. They seemed, in the manner they\r\nlodged and entertained them, to have always had an eye to their common\r\ntables and their black broth. Between the temples of Athens and Sparta\r\nthere was, in fact, the same contrast that now exists between St.\r\nPeter’s at Rome and a Calvinistic conventicle. Accordingly, several\r\nancient writers have vied with each other in heaping encomiums upon\r\nAthens, which they regarded as at once the most glorious and the most\r\nbeautiful of cities. Athenæus denominates it the “Museum of Greece;”\r\nPindar, “the stay of Greece;” Thucydides, in his epigram upon Euripides,\r\n“the Greece of Greece;” and the Pythian Apollo, “the home and place of\r\ncouncil of all Greeks.”[220] By others it was termed “the Opulent;”\r\nthough the principal part of its riches consisted in the wise and great\r\nmen whom it produced, and whose achievements covered it with glory. In\r\nthe same spirit the Arabs call Cairo the “Mother of cities;” and all\r\nnations concentrate more or less upon their capital, their affection and\r\ntheir pride.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  Dem. Olynth. iii. 9. Palm. Exercit. in Auct. Græc. p. 622. Zander, De\r\n  Luxu Athen. c. iii. 5, § 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  Athen. v. 12. Soph. Œdip. Col. 107. seq.\r\n\r\nThe superior magnificence of Athens appears from this; that it was\r\nalways the place to which the Greeks referred when desirous of\r\nmagnifying the splendour of their own country, in comparison with what\r\ncould be found elsewhere. Thus Dion Chrysostom[221] affirms that Athens\r\nand Corinth in all that constitutes real grandeur surpassed the famous\r\ncapitals of Persia, Syria, and Ecbatana, and Babylon, and the metropolis\r\nof Bactriana. Nay, in the opinion of this writer the Kraneion with its\r\ngymnasia, fountains, and shady walks, and the Acropolis with its\r\nPropylæa, antique altars, temples, and population of gods, exceeded in\r\nmagnificence the palaces of the Great King, though there was something\r\nexceedingly striking in the site and structure of what may properly be\r\ncalled the Acropolis of Ecbatana.[222] The city itself was unwalled, but\r\nthe citadel, which probably rose in the midst of it, occupied the slopes\r\nof a conical hill, not unlike Mount Tabor, and was girt by seven walls\r\nof different colours and elevation, rising in concentric circles above\r\neach other to the summit. The circumference of the lowest is said to\r\nhave equalled that of Athens including the Peiræeus. The colour of this\r\nwall was white; the next being black for the sake of contrast, was\r\nsucceeded by one of light purple, which was followed by walls of sky\r\nblue, of scarlet, of silver and of gold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  Orat. vi. t. i. p. 199.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  Herod. i. 98. Bochart, Geog. Sac. Pars Prior, l. iii. c. 14. p. 222.\r\n  Aristot. De Mund. ch. 6. Apuleius, p. 19.\r\n\r\nIn mere magnitude the great capitals of the East far exceeded Athens.\r\nThe circuit, for example, of Babylon, is said to have been at least four\r\nhundred stadia, while, according to the orator Dion, that of Athens was\r\nin round numbers two hundred stadia, or twenty-five miles. Aristeides\r\nprobably adopted the same calculation when he pronounced it to be a\r\nday’s journey in compass. But there is some exaggeration in these\r\naccounts; for, according to Thucydides, the total extent of the walls\r\ndid not exceed one hundred and seventy-eight stadia. The area, however,\r\nof the city was not proportioned to the vast range of its\r\nfortifications, consisting of two distinct systems of buildings, the\r\nAstu, or city proper, and the Peiræeus or harbour, connected together by\r\nthree walls more than four miles in length. There were other capitals in\r\nthe western world equal in dimensions, as Syracuse, one hundred and\r\neighty stadia in circumference, and Rome, which in the time of Dionysios\r\nof Halicarnassos did not command a larger circuit, though the space\r\nincluded within the walls was much greater.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, to convey a more complete idea of the ancient home of\r\nDemocracy and the Arts, we must, as far as possible, open up a view into\r\nthe interior of Athens, which, with its harbours, docks, arsenals, its\r\nmarket-places, bazārs, porticoes, public fountains and gymnasia,\r\nprobably formed the noblest spectacle ever presented to the eye by a\r\ncluster of human dwellings. From whatever side approached, whether by\r\nland or by sea, the city appeared to be but one vast group of\r\nmagnificence. In sailing up along the shore from the promontory of\r\nSunium, the polished brazen helmet and shield of the colossal\r\nAthena,[223] standing on the brow of the Acropolis, were beheld from\r\nafar flashing in the sun. On drawing nearer, the Parthenon, the\r\nPropylæa, the temple of Erectheus, with the other marble edifices\r\ncrowning the Cecropian rock, glittered above the pinnacles of the lower\r\ncity, and the deep green foliage of the encircling plain and olive\r\ngroves. Among its principal ornaments in the later ages of the republic\r\nwas a remarkable monument in the road to Eleusis,—the tomb of the\r\nhetaira Pythionica, who dying while her beauty still bloomed and her\r\npowers of fascination were unimpaired, the love she had inspired\r\nsurvived the grave and manifested itself by rearing a costly pile of\r\nmarble over her ashes.[224]\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 28. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 67.\r\n\r\nUpon sailing into the Peiræeus,[225] where generally ships from every\r\nquarter of the ancient world lay at anchor, the stranger was immediately\r\nstruck by manifestations of the people’s power and predilection for\r\nstateliness and grandeur. The entrance into the port, barely wide enough\r\nto admit a couple of galleys abreast, with their oars in full sweep, lay\r\nbetween two round towers, in which terminated on either hand the\r\nmaritime fortifications of the city. Across the mouth vast chains were\r\nextended in time of war, rendering the Peiræeus a closed port;[226]\r\narrived within which, the pleased eye wandered over the spacious quays,\r\nwharfs, and long ranges of warehouses extending round the harbour, with\r\ntombs and sepulchral monuments rising here and there in open spaces\r\nbetween. Among them was a cenotaph in the form of an altar, raised by\r\nthe repentant people in memory of Themistocles,[227] the founder of the\r\nnaval power of Athens, whose bones however it has sometimes been\r\nsupposed were brought thither from Magnesia. The Peiræeus consisted of\r\nthree basins, Zea, Aphrodision, which was by far the largest, and\r\nCantharos. On the western shore were the vast docks and arsenals of the\r\ncommonwealth erected by Philon,[228] in which, during peace, all that\r\nportion of the public navy not engaged in protecting its trade in\r\ndistant colonies, was drawn up in dry docks, roofed over and surrounded\r\nby massive walls. Towards the centre of the town stood the\r\nHippodameia,[229] an agora or market place, which appears to have\r\nresembled Covent Garden, with ranges of stalls in the area and\r\nsurrounded by dwelling-houses. This building derived its name from\r\nHippodamos of Miletos, the architect who erected it, and laid out the\r\nwhole maritime city in the regular and beautiful style of which he was\r\nthe inventor.[230] Here, also, were several other market-places or\r\nbazārs, among which may be reckoned a place[231] resembling the Laura of\r\nSamos, the Sweet Ancon of Sardis, the Street of the Happy at Alexandria,\r\nand the Tuscan Street at Rome, in which fruit, confectionary, with\r\ndelicacies and luxuries of every kind were exposed for sale. In these\r\nagora, as now in the bazārs of Cairo, Damascus, and Constantinople, were\r\nbeheld, in close juxtaposition, the wines of Spain and Portugal, amber\r\nfrom the shores of the ocean, the carpets, shawls, and jewels of the\r\nEast, fruit and gold from Thasos, ivory and ostrich feathers from\r\nAfrica, and beautiful female slaves from Syria, Dardania, and the\r\nsouthern shores of the Euxine, the Mingrelians and Georgians of the\r\nmodern world.[232] Around these singular groups the young men of Athens,\r\nin an almost oriental pomp of costume, might be seen lounging, some\r\nperhaps purchasing, others merely looking on, half in haste to return to\r\nthe gymnasium or to the lectures of Socrates.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Of these the latter was the most ancient, and from hence\r\nMnestheus sailed for Troy and Theseus for Crete.[241] The Munychian\r\npromontory,[242] abounding in hollows and artificial excavations, and\r\nconnected by a narrow neck of land with the continent, was the strongest\r\nposition on the coast, and may be regarded as the key of Athens, since\r\nwhoever held possession of it could command the city. In this Demos\r\nstood the Bendideion[243] where shows were exhibited in honour of Bendis\r\nthe Thracian Artemis, to behold which Socrates and his friends came down\r\nfrom the city, when at the house of Cephalos that conversation took\r\nplace with Glaucon and Adimantos, out of which arose the Republic of\r\nPlato. This division of the port likewise possessed its theatre,[244]\r\nand here were fought some of those battles with the thirty that\r\nre-established the liberty of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 1, 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Strab. ix. 1. t. ii. p. 239.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

Dr. Cramer, Desc. of Greece, ii. 346, seq.\r\n  understands the long walls to have been but two in number.\r\n\r\nProceeding inland towards the Astu or city of Athens proper, the\r\nstranger beheld before him a straight street upwards of five miles in\r\nlength, extending from the Peiræeus to the foot of the Acropolis,\r\nbetween walls[245] of immense elevation and thickness, flanked by square\r\ntowers at equal distances. Along the summit of these vast piles of\r\nmasonry a terrace was carried, commanding superb views of the Saronic\r\nbay and distant coasts of Peloponnesos; and, on the other hand, of the\r\ncity relieved against the green slopes of Lycabettos[246]. The space\r\nbetween the long walls abounded with remarkable monuments. Here were the\r\ntombs of Diopethes, Menander, and Euripides, the temple of Hera, burned\r\nby the Persians, and left in ruins as a memento to revenge, and numerous\r\ncenotaphs and statues of illustrious men.\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  Marin. vit. Procl. p. 74. ed. Fabric.\r\n\r\nSpacious and lofty gates admitted you into the Astu, through a belt of\r\nimpregnable fortifications: and the appearance of the interior,[247]\r\nthough the streets for military purposes were mostly narrow and winding,\r\nand the houses low, projecting over the pavement or concealed by\r\nelevated front-walls, surpassed in all probability the promise of its\r\ndistant aspect. The grandeur which peculiarly belonged to the Athenian\r\ndemocracy was visible at every step. But it would weary the reader to\r\nlead him in succession through all the public places—the Pnyx, the\r\nAgora, the Cerameicos: let us ascend the Acropolis, from whose ramparts\r\nthe plan of the whole city will unfold itself before us like a map.\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  Boeckh, Pub. Econ. of Athens, i. 88. seq.\r\n\r\nHalf the beauty of all civilised countries springs out of their\r\nreligion. At Athens nearly everything costly or magnificent belonged to\r\nthe Gods; even the Propylæa,[248] apparently a mere secular or military\r\nstructure, probably owed its erection in so expensive a style to the\r\ncircumstance of its adorning the entrance to the sacred enclosure of\r\nAthena, and the other tutelary divinities of Athens, and spanning the\r\nroad by which the pomp of the Panathenaic procession descended and\r\nascended the mount. Be this as it may, a road[249] which, by running\r\nzigzag up the slope, was rendered practicable for chariots, led from the\r\nlower city to the Acropolis, on the edge of the platform of which stood\r\nthe Propylæa, erected by the architect Mnesicles in five years, during\r\nthe administration of Pericles. A pile of architecture, similar in name,\r\nis usually found at the entrance of the court of Egyptian temples, and\r\nthe Propylæa Luxor and Karnak, with their aspiring obelisks, couchant\r\nsphynxes, and ranges of colossal statues, may be reckoned among the most\r\nchaste and beautiful monuments in the valley of the Nile. The Propylæa\r\nof Athens, richer in design and materials, and executed with a grace and\r\nperfection unknown to the Egyptians, enjoyed in its mere site an immense\r\nadvantage over their noblest works which, the pyramids and the great\r\ntemple of Koom Ombos excepted, stand on a dead level, while this\r\noccupies the brow of a precipitous rock, visible on every side from\r\nafar. Pillars, architraves, pediments, walls, and roof, were all of\r\nsnow-white marble, with mouldings of bright red and blue, and ceilings\r\nof azure bedropped with stars.[250] Externally, on either hand, were\r\nequestrian statues of the sons of Xenophon,[251] placed on lofty square\r\nbasements; and, overlooking the whole on the left, stood the colossal\r\nstatue of Athena Promachos.[252]\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  Suid. in v. t. ii. p. 611. d.

It is the word applied at\r\n  present to it by the Greek peasants, who are the best commentators on\r\n  the old naturalists.” Sibthorp in Walp.

Vit. p. 18 seq.\r\n\r\nOn entering through the gates of the Propylæa a scene of unparalleled\r\ngrandeur and beauty burst upon the eye. No trace of human dwellings\r\nanywhere appeared, but on all sides temples of more or less elevation,\r\nof Pentelic marble, beautiful in design and exquisitely delicate in\r\nexecution, sparkled like piles of alabaster in the sun. On the left\r\nstood the Erectheion or fane of Athena Polias; to the right that\r\nmatchless edifice known as the Hecatompedon of old, but to later ages as\r\nthe Parthenon. Other buildings, all holy to the eye of an Athenian, lay\r\ngrouped around these master structures, and in the open spaces between,\r\nin whatever direction the spectators might look, appeared statues, some\r\nremarkable for their dimensions, others for their beauty, and all for\r\nthe legendary sanctity which surrounded them. No city of the ancient or\r\nmodern world ever rivalled Athens in the riches of art. Our best filled\r\nmuseums, though teeming with her spoils, are poor collections of\r\nfragments compared with that assemblage of gods and heroes which peopled\r\nthe Acropolis, the genuine Olympos of the arts, where all the divinities\r\nof the pagan heaven appeared grouped in immortal youth and beauty round\r\nthe Thunderer and his virgin daughter. Many volumes were written in\r\nantiquity on the pictures, statues, and architectural monuments which\r\nthronged the summit of this rock, and though those works have perished,\r\na long and curious list might still be given of the objects of this kind\r\nwhich we know to have existed there.[253] It will, however, be\r\nsufficient to glance over a few of the more striking features of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  Somewhere in a cavern in the rock of the Acropolis was a slab called\r\n  the pillar of infamy, on which were engraved the names of traitors and\r\n  other public delinquents. Thrasybulos accused Leodamas of having had\r\n  his name on this pillar.—Aristot. Rhet. ii. 23.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the entrance stood a chariot drawn by four horses in\r\nbronze, and directly opposite a chapel of Aphrodite, containing a bronze\r\nlioness, with a statue of the goddess herself by Calamis; a little\r\nfurther the eye rested on Diitrephes, pierced like St. Sebastian with\r\narrows; two figures of the goddess Health; a youth in bronze, by Lycios,\r\nbearing the Perirrhanterion, or brush for sprinkling holy water; Myron’s\r\ngroup of Perseus cutting off the head of Medusa, and the three Graces\r\ndraped by Socrates,[254] son of Sophroniscos. Advancing past the chapel\r\nof Artemis Brauronia you beheld, amid numerous groups of less striking\r\nmonuments, the Attic conception of the Trojan horse; Athena smiting\r\nMarsyas; Heracles strangling the serpents in his cradle; Phrixos\r\nsacrificing the ram; and Theseus, the national hero, slaughtering the\r\nMinotaur in the Cretan labyrinth.[255] Here, too, was an Athena issuing\r\nfrom the head of Zeus, together with the figure of a bull presented by\r\nthe Senate of Areiopagos; and, a little beyond, an embodiment of a very\r\npious and a very beautiful thought,—a figure of Earth, the mother of\r\ngods and men, praying to the ruler of Olympos for rain. Of Zeus, the\r\nCloud-Compeller, there were numerous representations by artists of\r\ncelebrity; the figure of Apollo, by Pheidias, standing before the\r\neastern front of the Parthenon, was lighted up by the first rays of the\r\nmorning. But the tutelar gods of Attica, Athena and Poseidon, the genii\r\nof political wisdom and maritime power, exhibited as struggling for the\r\nmastery over the Athenian mind, met the eye in various parts of the\r\nAcropolis,—the piety of the people delighting to reproduce with various\r\nattributes the objects of their affectionate adoration. Among these\r\ndivinities, the statues of several poets, orators, and generals were\r\nfound; Anacreon, Epicharmos, Phormio, Timotheus, Conon, Pericles, and\r\nIsocrates. On drawing near the Parthenon, its sculptured pediments and\r\nmetopes, representing legends in the mythology and religious processions\r\nof Athens, excited admiration, and still excite it, by their original\r\ndesign and matchless workmanship: and, suspended from its highly painted\r\nfriezes, and resting on its white marble architraves, were rows of\r\nhighly burnished shields of gold.[256]\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 22. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  On the labyrinth at present shown in Crete, see Tournefort, i. 76.\r\n  sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  They were votive offerings, and the impressions they made are still\r\n  visible upon the marble.—Words. Athens and Attica, 117. Lachares\r\n  afterwards, when Athens was besieged by Demetrius, carried them away\r\n  with him into Bœotia.—Paus. i. 25. 7. To facilitate his escape, he is\r\n  said to have scattered handfuls of golden Darics on the road, which,\r\n  tempting the cavalry in pursuit, prevented his capture.—Polyæn. iii.\r\n  7. 1.\r\n\r\nTechnical descriptions of buildings, whether religious or civil, would\r\nbe out of place in the present work; but a compendious account of the\r\nErectheion and Parthenon, the two great sanctuaries of the Acropolis,\r\ncould not with propriety be omitted. To commence with the former, as the\r\nmore ancient and sacred:—this edifice, of irregular design though highly\r\nbeautiful, contained three chapels, with the same number of porticoes.\r\nThe chapel of Erectheus, entered through a portico of six columns, faced\r\nthe east, where stood the altar of supreme Zeus, never stained by blood\r\nor libations of wine. The pavement of this portion of the edifice was\r\nraised eight feet above the level of the other chapels. Here the piety\r\nof Athens had erected altars to Erectheus, Poseidon, Butas, and\r\nHephaistos, and pictures dedicated by the sacred family of the\r\nEteobutadæ adorned the walls. In a subterraneous chamber beneath the\r\nfloor lay the mortal remains of Ericthonios, a man sprung in a\r\nmysterious manner from the gods. The Erectheion being about twenty-four\r\nfeet square, some have imagined it must have been hypæthral, unless the\r\nstone blocks of the roof were supported by pillars. But the ancients\r\nemployed slabs of much greater dimensions in building and roofing their\r\ntemples; for at the Egyptian quarries of Hajjar Silsilis and Essouan we\r\nobserved blocks from forty-two to seventy feet in length and of suitable\r\nproportions, while others equally vast had been removed. Volney, too, as\r\nthe reader will remember, found masses of no less magnitude in the walls\r\nof Syrian temples: besides, several obelisks, now on their pedestals,\r\nfall little short of a hundred feet in height.\r\n\r\nBetween the Erectheion and the chapel of Athena Polias there was no door\r\nof communication. Having surveyed the former, therefore, the stranger\r\nagain issued into the open air, and turning to the left entered the\r\nstately portico leading from the north into the temple of Pandrosos,\r\nwhere, constructed of Pentelic marble, stood the altar of frankincense.\r\nPassing this, and traversing the Pandrosion, he entered the ancient\r\nsanctuary of Athena, unwindowed and gloomy, whither not even that “dim\r\nreligious light” which contends with obscurity in our gothic cathedrals\r\ncould find its way. This is the case in many Egyptian temples where the\r\nadyta are totally dark. But sunshine and the splendour of day would ill\r\nhave suited the mystic rites here celebrated; for which reason these\r\nsacred recesses were lighted up with lamps, magnificent in form and\r\nmaterials, that shed a soft pale ray over the worshippers. The\r\nmany-branched[257] golden candelabrum of Athena’s sanctuary was\r\nfurnished with asbestos wicks, and, according to the temple-wardens, of\r\nsufficient dimensions to contain oil for a whole year. Once lighted,\r\ntherefore, it burned with perennial flame, and the smoke was received\r\nand conducted to the roof by a hollow bronze palm tree reversed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  A conjecture of Müller, Minerv. Pol. v. 25.\r\n\r\nThis inextinguishable lamp was kindled and kept burning, through\r\nreverence for that antique image of Athena in wood of olive which\r\nconstituted one of the palladia of Attica. In honour, moreover, of this\r\nprimitive statue the Panathenaic procession is said to have been\r\ninstituted, during which, like the velabrum of the temple of Mekka, the\r\npeplos,[258] whatever this may have been, was dedicated with vast pomp\r\nand ceremony to the service of the goddess.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  Antiquarians have formed many ingenious conjectures; but to me it\r\n  appears evidently to have been a female veil, such as Helenos in the\r\n  Iliad (σ. 734) commands to be offered to the same goddess of citadels,\r\n  by his mother and the other matrons of Troy.\r\n\r\nThe principal argument, however, against supposing the peplos to have\r\nbeen designed for the gold and ivory statue of the Parthenon,—that it\r\nwas not needed, is of very little weight. None of the ceremonies\r\nattending its presentation were necessary. The offering was a work of\r\ndevotion; and however costly in itself and elaborately adorned, may have\r\nbeen simply designed to protect the image from dust and the action of\r\nthe air. That Pheidias represented the goddess without her peplos, is no\r\nargument that his statue needed none, but the contrary. He may have\r\nomitted it expressly that it might be supplied by the piety of the\r\nstate. Besides, the sculptured metopes of the Parthenon, representing\r\nthe Panathenaic procession, are themselves a strong argument for\r\nconnecting the presentation of the peplos and the other ceremonies of\r\nthe festival with that more splendid structure and image rather than\r\nwith the Erectheion. As the Athenians supposed the Islands of the\r\nblessed and the dwelling-place of their gods to have been somewhere in\r\nthe regions of the west, they were accustomed to pray with their faces\r\nturned in that direction;[259] and so also buried they their dead. For\r\nthis reason, desiring to behold the countenance of their divinities\r\nduring this religious service, the statues of the gods were generally\r\nset up with their faces eastward; and hence, too, the front of the\r\ntemples looked in the same direction. This was the case with the\r\nolive-wood image of Athena Polias; and in the reign of Augustus the\r\nAthenians, rendered more superstitious than ever by their misfortunes,\r\nwere vehemently terrified on finding that the goddess had turned her\r\nback upon them,[260] as if preparing to seek her ancient home in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. But her real presence had forsaken the city long before\r\nthe battle of Chæroneia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Sol. § 10. Visconti, Mem. p. 18. Müll. Minerv. Pol. p. 27.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  Dion. Cass. iv. 7.\r\n\r\nBut Athena, though the principal, was not the sole inhabitant of her\r\nsanctuary. On one side of the door stood a phallic statue of Hermes,\r\noriginally set up by the Pelasgians,[261] and in later ages nearly\r\nconcealed by a profusion of myrtle branches. Here, also, in a very\r\nextraordinary inmate were found traces of that animal worship which\r\nextended so widely over the ancient world. In a den constructed for its\r\nuse lived a great serpent, considered as the guardian of the temple, and\r\nsupposed to be animated by the soul of Ericthonios, who here performed\r\nthe part assigned in the fane of Demeter to Cadmos, likewise believed to\r\nhave undergone a similar transformation after death. The snake-god of\r\nthe Acropolis received its daily sustenance from the priestess of\r\nAthena; and once every month was propitiated with pious offerings of\r\ncakes of the purest honey.[262] Relics of this worship are still found\r\nin Egypt. In a deep chasm, among the wild rocky mountains on the Arabian\r\nside of the Nile, we were shown a fissure in a hermit’s cell, whence a\r\nlarge reptile of this species is said to issue forth at stated days to\r\nreceive the offerings of food brought him by the neighbouring peasants.\r\nThis creature, as well as the guardian of the Athenian Temple, is\r\nsupposed to possess a human soul, that of the holy Sheikh Haridi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  Herod. viii. 41. Combe, Terra-cottas of the British Museum, pl. 28.\r\n  Petit. Radel, Musée Napol. iv. 33.\r\n\r\nLike most other Hellenic sanctuaries, the chapel of the goddess was a\r\nkind of museum filled with memorials of Athenian victories and other\r\nremarkable objects. Here were shown curious or beautiful specimens of\r\narms or armour, taken from the enemy; among which were the breast-plate\r\nand scimitar of Masistios,[263] commander of the Median cavalry at the\r\nbattle of Platæa. Close beside these warlike memorials, stood a folding\r\ncamp-stool, the invention, it was said, and workmanship of Dædalos; the\r\narchetype of all those portable seats borne after the maidens of Attica\r\nby the daughters of aliens in the grand Panathenaic procession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 27. 1. The Athenians in the age of this traveller confounded,\r\n  it seems, Masistios with Mardonios, nothing very extraordinary several\r\n  hundred years after the event referred to. Pausanias speaks of it as a\r\n  mistake; Mr. Müller, who is less ceremonious, as a falsehood. Minerv.\r\n  Pol. 29. The passion for relics, which led to the preservation of\r\n  these objects, existed in all its whimsicality among the ancients. But\r\n  they were scarcely so ingenious as the Roman Catholics of the\r\n  continent, whose sacred treasures include a number of feathers from\r\n  the wings of the angel Gabriel, a small bone of one of the cherubim,\r\n  and a few rays of the star by which the wise men of the East were led\r\n  to Bethlehem. They have also a small phial, containing some of the\r\n  darkness that overspread the land of Egypt. (Cf. Fabric. ad Cod.\r\n  Pseud. epigr. v. i. p. 93. t. 11. and Christophori Carmen, ap\r\n  Boissonade ad Eunap. p. 277. seq.) In the temples of antiquity relics\r\n  nearly as curious were preserved: they had an egg of Leda, possibly,\r\n  as Lobeck conjectures, an ostrich’s (Aglaoph. i. 52; Paus. iii. 16.\r\n  1); the teeth of the Erymanthean boar (Paus. viii. 24. 2), whose\r\n  spoils were also shown at Tegea (Lucian adv. Indoct. § 13); the teeth\r\n  of the Calydonian boar were preserved at Beneventum (Procop. Bell.\r\n  Goth. i. 15. 349. c); they had also the sword of Memnon (Paus. iii. 3.\r\n  6); the iron spear of Epeios (Justin. xx. 7), the brazen vessel in\r\n  which Pelias was boiled, the arrows of Teucer, the chlamys of\r\n  Odysseus, were preserved in the temple of Apollo at Sicyon. (Ampel.\r\n  Memor. viii. 68. Beckm. Hist. of Invent. ii. 364. Germ. in Lobeck.) In\r\n  the Troad the anvils were shown which Zeus suspended to the heels of\r\n  Hera, when he hung her up between heaven and earth (Eustath. p. 15. l.\r\n  30); here, too, anyone might see the cithara of Paris. (Plut. Alex. §\r\n  15.) Like the Catholics, too, they showed the same thing in two or\r\n  three places; for example, the hair of Isis might be seen at Koptos\r\n  (Etym. Mag. _v._ κόπτος, 522. 12), and at Memphis. (Luc. adv. Ind. §\r\n  13.) The Romans, according to Horace (Carm. ii. 3. 21), possessed the\r\n  bronze wash-hand-basin of Sisyphos. A much more extensive list may be\r\n  found in Beckmann, Hist. of Inven. ii. 42. seq. _Eng. Tr._\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting portion of this extraordinary edifice\r\ndedicated to the worship of so many gods and heroes, was the small\r\nchapel of Pandrosos, where Pandora and Thallo were said to have lived,\r\nand where the ashes of Cecrops reposed. Here dwelt the priestess, shut\r\nup for several months with the Ersephoræ. This cella may, therefore, be\r\nsaid to have belonged not only to Pandrosos, who was one of the earliest\r\nministers of these rites, but to all who from her received the office.\r\nThe building opened on the south into a portico, adorned with Caryatides\r\ninstead of columns, and filled with ceremonial and religious\r\nassociations. Here grew the Pancuphos, or sacred olive tree, which,\r\nburned by the Persians, shot up a cubit in a single night, and was\r\nthought to be endued with the power of undying vegetation, for, if the\r\ntrunk were cut down, new shoots immediately succeeded. Near the sacred\r\nolive was the salt well, called the sea of Erectheus, which Poseidon is\r\nsaid to have produced by smiting the rock with his trident. In the\r\nhollow of this fountain, during the prevalence of the south wind, a\r\nsound like the murmuring of the waves was supposed to be heard. This\r\nwell has not been discovered in modern times; but in another part of the\r\ncitadel there existed a spring of brackish water, known by the name of\r\nthe Clepsydra, which, about the rising of the dog-star, while the\r\nEtesian winds were blowing, overflowed; but on their cessation again\r\nsubsided.[264]\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  This fountain was likewise called Empedo.—Sch. Arist. Vesp. 857. I may\r\n  here mention, by the way, that most ancient cities were supplied with\r\n  water by pipes underground, as Syracuse.—Thucyd. vi. 100. Cf. Sch.\r\n  Arist. Achar. 1145.\r\n\r\nWe have perhaps too long lingered among the dusky recesses of this\r\nancient fane, spell-bound by the charms of a beautiful mythology. We\r\nemerge now into the light of history, and approach that matchless\r\nstructure erected by Ictinos where the Athenian people offered up their\r\ndaily prayers to heaven.[265] The Parthenon occupies the most elevated\r\nplatform of the Acropolis, the pavement of its peristyle being on a\r\nlevel with the capitals of the columns of the Propylæa. It was\r\nconstructed entirely of white Pentelic marble,[266] and consisted of a\r\ncella surrounded by a Doric peristyle having eight columns on either\r\nfront, and seventeen on the sides. These pillars, thirty-four feet in\r\nheight, sprang from a pavement elevated three steps above the rocky\r\nplatform, from whence the total height of the building was about\r\nsixty-five feet. The arrangement of the interior like that of the great\r\ntemples of Egypt had reference rather to utility and the convenience of\r\npublic worship, than to the effect which long ranges of lofty pillars,\r\nextending through unencumbered space, would have produced upon the mind:\r\nfor the cella, sixty-two feet in breadth, was divided into two chambers\r\nof unequal size,—the western about forty-four feet in length, the\r\neastern nearly one hundred. In both these chambers the ceiling was\r\nsupported by columns.\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of remark that from this temple all persons of Doric race\r\n  were excluded. King Cleomenes, therefore, when desirous of obtaining\r\n  admission, denied his birth-right, and called himself an\r\n  Achæan.—Herod. v. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  The quarries of this mountain, worked to so great an extent by the\r\n  ancients, are now filling again with marble which grows\r\n  rapidly.—Chandler, ii. 191.

Its dimensions\r\nof two hundred and twenty-eight feet by a hundred and two, with a height\r\nof sixty-eight feet to the top of the pediment, were sufficiently great\r\nto give an impression of grandeur and sublimity, which was not disturbed\r\nby any obtrusive division of parts, such as is found to diminish the\r\neffect of some larger modern buildings. In the Parthenon, whether viewed\r\nat a small or at a great distance, there was nothing to divert the\r\nspectator’s contemplation from the simplicity and majesty of mass and\r\noutline which forms the first and most remarkable object of admiration\r\nin a Greek temple; and it was not until the eye was satiated with the\r\ncontemplation of the entire edifice that the spectator was tempted to\r\nexamine the decorations with which this building was so profusely\r\nadorned; for the statues of the pediments the only elevation which was\r\nvery conspicuous by its magnitude and position, being enclosed within\r\nframes, which formed an essential part of the design of either front,\r\nhad no more obtrusive effect than an ornamental capital has to a single\r\ncolumn.\"[267]\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  Topog. of Athens, pp. 211, 212. See also Chandler, ii. 49. sqq.\r\n\r\nThat object of art, whatever its dimensions, is sufficiently great,\r\nwhich fills the mind with high ideas of grandeur and beauty. There is,\r\nmoreover, in mere size, a point, beyond which if we proceed, the eye\r\nwill fail to grasp the whole at a glance, and create a feeling of want\r\nof unity; but, in proportion as we fall short of that point will be our\r\nsense of the absence of sublimity. In this predicament, perhaps, the\r\ntemples of Greece too generally stood. Considerations of expense, which\r\nin the end affected their habits of thinking, cramped the ideas of the\r\narchitects, or forced them to direct their studies towards beauty of\r\nform unconnected with that grandeur which springs out of mass and\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nAmong the barbarous nations of the East, where the whole resources of\r\nthe country lay at the disposal of the monarch or of the priestly caste,\r\nas in Hindùstân, Persia, and Egypt, full scope, on the contrary, was\r\ngiven to the imagination of the architect, who, if his invention were\r\nequal to it, might give his structures the elevation of a mountain and\r\nthe spaciousness of a vast city. Hence, the grandeur arising from\r\nmagnitude, is, in most cases, found to belong to the sacred edifices of\r\nEgypt;[268] and in some instances a feeling of symmetry, a sense of the\r\nbeautiful, appears to have restrained the artist within due bounds, as\r\nin the great temple of Apollinopolis Magna, which, whatever may be the\r\nimperfections of its architectural details, is invested, as a whole,\r\nwith an air of genuine magnificence and sublimity. Proceeding from the\r\ncontemplation of these to the religious structures of Greece, there\r\nwould be found, I imagine, in most minds a slight feeling of\r\ndisappointment, and though afterwards, the delight imparted by the\r\npresence of extreme beauty,—a delight serene, soft, and inexpressibly\r\nsoothing, may more than compensate for the want of awe and wondering\r\nadmiration, their absence will still be felt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  Of these temples Lucian says: ὅμοιαι ... τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις ἱεροῖς: κᾀκεῖ\r\n  γὰρ, αὐτὸς μὲν ὁ νεὼς κάλλιστός τε καὶ μέγιστος, λίθοις τοῖς\r\n  πολυτελέσιν ἠσκημένος, καὶ χρυσῷ, καὶ γραφαῖς διηνθισμὲνος. ἔνδον δὲ\r\n  ἢν ζητῆς τὸν βεὸν ἢ πιθηκός ἔστιν, ἢ ἴβις, ἢ τράγος, ἢ αἴλουρος.\r\n  Imagin. § 11.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed: in rich and elaborate decorations the Parthenon\r\nresembled the temple of Tentyris. Every part of its exterior, where\r\nornament was admissible, presented to the eye some creation of Hellenic\r\ntaste and fancy, figures in high and low relief, grouped in action or\r\nrepose, conceived and executed in a style worthy of the prince of the\r\nmimetic art.[269] Many wrecks of these matchless compositions are now\r\nprotected from further defacements in the metropolis of Great Britain,\r\nbut withal so mutilated and decayed that none but a practised eye can\r\ndiscern, through the ravages of age, all the sunshine of beauty and\r\nloveliness which beamed from them when fresh from the Pheidian chisel.\r\nOne of the greatest works of this artist filled the interior of the\r\nParthenon with the emanations of its beauty, the statue of Athena in\r\nivory and gold,[270] which, representing a form distinguished for all\r\nthe softness and roundness belonging to womanhood, and a countenance\r\nradiant with the highest intellect, must in some respects have borne\r\naway the palm from the Olympian Zeus; for in the latter, after all,\r\nnothing beyond masculine energy, dignity, majesty could have existed.\r\nThese indeed were so blended, so subdued into a glorious and god-like\r\nserenity, that this creation of human genius, like the august being of\r\nwhich it was a mute type, possessed in a degree the celestial power of\r\nchasing away sadness and sorrow, and shedding benignity and happiness\r\nover all who beheld it.[271] But for men at least, the Zeus must have\r\nlacked some attributes possessed by the Athena. She was in all her\r\netherial loveliness, a woman still, but without a woman’s weakness, or a\r\nsingle taint of earth. The Athenians paid the highest possible\r\ncompliment to womanhood when they gave wisdom a female form; and the\r\ndelicacy of the thought was enhanced by surrounding this mythological\r\ncreation with an atmosphere of purity which no other divinity of the\r\npagan heaven could lay claim to. Nor in beauty did Athena yield even to\r\nAphrodite herself. Her charms partook indeed of that noble severity\r\nwhich belongs to virtue; and to intimate that she was rather of heaven\r\nthan of earth, her eyes were of the colour of the firmament. Yet this\r\nspiritual elevation above the reach of the passions, only appears to\r\nhave enhanced, in the estimation of the Athenians, the splendour of her\r\npersonal beauty, which shed its chastening and ennobling influence among\r\nher worshippers like the droppings of a summer cloud.\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

The Athenians, it has been ingeniously conjectured, seized for\r\nthe dedication of the statue, on the period of the celebration of the\r\nmost gorgeous festival in their calendar, the greater Panathenaia, which\r\nlike a kind of jubilee occurred but once in an Olympiad.[273] What\r\nlength of time Pheidias employed in finishing this statue we possess no\r\nmeans of determining; but as the Parthenon itself is supposed not to\r\nhave been completed in less than ten years, the artist need not have\r\nbeen hurried in his work.[274]\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  Frag. ed.

Olymp. p. 222.\r\n\r\nIn the temple of Zeus at Olympia and in every sacred structure we\r\nvisited in Egypt and Nubia, there was a staircase conducting to the\r\nroof. No positive testimony remains to prove this to have been the case\r\nin the Parthenon, though antiquarians, with much probability, have\r\nsupposed it to have been so.[275] Let us therefore assume the fact, and\r\nascending to the summit of the edifice survey the surrounding scene and\r\nthe superb city encircling the rock at our feet. Few landscapes in the\r\nworld are more rich or varied, none more deeply interesting. History has\r\npeopled every spot within the circle of vision with spirit-stirring\r\nassociations; or if history has passed over any, there has poetry been\r\nbusy, building up her legends from the scattered fragments of tradition.\r\nCarrying our eye along the distant edge of the horizon we behold the\r\npromontory of Sunium, Ægina rising out of the Myrtoan sea, Trœzen, the\r\nbirth-place of Theseus the national hero, the mountains of Argolis, the\r\nhostile citadel of Corinth, with Phylæ and Deceleia rendered too famous\r\nby the Peloponnesian war. Nearer the shore is “sea-born” Salamis, and\r\nthat low headland where the barbarian took his seat to view the battle\r\nin the straits. Yonder at the extremity of the long walls are the ports\r\nof Munychia, Phaleron and Peiræeus; on our left is Hymettos with its bee\r\nswarms and odoriferous slopes;[276] to the right Colonos, the grove of\r\nthe terrible Erinnyes, and the chasm in the rock by which the wretched\r\nŒdipus, having reached the end of his career, descended to the infernal\r\nworld.[277] Beyond lies Eleusis and the Sacred Way.[278] Yonder in the\r\nmidst of groves is the Academy; here is the Cerameicos[279] filled with\r\nthe monuments which the republic erected to its heroes, there the\r\nCynosarges and the Lyceium. The hill of Areiopagos, contiguous to the\r\nrock of the Acropolis, divides the Pnyx from the Agora planted by Conon\r\nwith plane trees. Near at hand, encircled by ordinary dwellings, are the\r\nLeocorion, the temple of Theseus, the Odeion, the Stoa Pœcile, and the\r\nDionysiac theatre, with various other monuments remarkable for their\r\nbeauty or historical importance.[280]\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Leake, Topog. p. 215.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  About half a mile from Athens in this direction was a temple of\r\n  Artemis (Ἄγρα), on the Ilissos, with an altar to Boreas; where,\r\n  according to the fable, the god carried away Orithyia while playing on\r\n  the rock with Pharmacia.—Plat. Phæd. i. 7. In consequence of the\r\n  alliance thus contracted Boreas always felt a particular friendship\r\n  for the Athenians, to whose succour he hastened with his aërial forces\r\n  during the Median war.—Herod, vii. 189.\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  Antigone, in Sophocles, (Œdip.

M. Barbie du\r\n  Bocage’s Essay on the Topography of Sparta, upon the whole faulty, is,\r\n  nevertheless, in my opinion, right with respect to the portion of the\r\n  bridge Babyx which Mr. Müller throws over the Tiasa, contrary to all\r\n  the reasonable inferences to be derived from history. Colonel Leake’s\r\n  plan, given in his travels in the Morea, conveys a different idea of\r\n  Spartan topography; but I am unable to reconcile his views with the\r\n  account of the city in Pausanias, though I very much regret that the\r\n  plan I have adopted should not be recommended by the support of a\r\n  writer so learned and so ingenious.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has endeavoured to discover anything like order in\r\nPausanias’ topography of Sparta,[282] will fully comprehend the\r\ndifficulty of constructing from his information anything like an\r\nintelligible plan of the city. Nevertheless, by setting out from a fixed\r\npoint, by laboriously studying the thread of his narration, by divining\r\nthe secret order he seems to follow in enumerating and delineating the\r\nvarious public buildings of which he speaks, and by comparing his\r\nfragmentary disclosures with the present physiognomy of the site, I have\r\nformed a conception of the features of ancient Sparta which may,\r\nperhaps, be found to bear some resemblance to the original.\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  III. 11–20. Cf. Polyb. v. 22. Liv. xxxiv. 26. seq.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose ourselves to have passed the Eurotas, and to be standing\r\non the summit of the loftiest building of the Acropolis, the Alpion for\r\nexample, or the temple of Athena Chalciœcos,[283] from which we can\r\ncommand a view of the whole site of Sparta from the Eurotas, where it\r\nflows between banks shaded with reeds and lofty rose laurels[284] on the\r\neast, to the brisk sparkling stream of the Tiasa, and the roots of the\r\nTaygetos on the west. North and south the eye ranges up and down the\r\nvalley,[285] discovering in the latter direction the ancient cities of\r\nTherapne[286] and Amyclæ,[287] celebrated for their poetical and heroic\r\nassociations. Beyond the Eurotas eastward, occupying the green and\r\nwell-wooded acclivities upwards, from the banks of the stream towards\r\nthe barren and red-tinted heights of the Menelaion,[288] lay scattered\r\nthe villas of the noble Spartans, filled with costly furniture and every\r\nother token of wealth,[289] while here and there, on all sides,\r\nembosomed in groves or thickets, arose the temples and chapels of the\r\ngods surrounded by a halo of sanctity and communicating peculiar beauty\r\nto the landscape.\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  In the precincts of this temple, evidently the strongest place in the\r\n  city, the Ætolian mercenaries took refuge after the assassination of\r\n  Nabis.—Liv. xxxv. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Instit. Lacon. § 10. Chateaubriand, Itin. xi. 110.\r\n  Poucqueville’s description of the stream is striking and picturesque:\r\n  “The banks,” he says, “are bordered with never-fading laurels, which,\r\n  inclining towards each other, form an arch over its waters, and seem\r\n  still consecrated to the deities of whom its purity is a just emblem;\r\n  while swans, even of a more dazzling whiteness than the snows that\r\n  cover the mountain-tops above, are constantly sailing up and down the\r\n  stream.”—Travels, p. 84. The Viscount Chateaubriand, however, sought\r\n  in vain for these poetical birds, and, therefore, evidently considers\r\n  them fabulous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  Strabo’s brief description of the site deserves to be mentioned: ἔστι\r\n  μὲν οὖν ἐν κοιλοτέρῳ χωρίῳ τὸ τῆς πόλεως ἔδαφος, καίπερ ἀπολαμβάνον\r\n  ὄρη μεταξύ. viii. 5. t. ii. p. 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

Immediately contiguous to the\r\ndwellings of this tribe in the north eastern division of the city,\r\nopposite that cloven island in the Eurotas, which contained the temple\r\nof Artemis, Orthia, and the Goddess of Birth, dwelt the Limnatæ,[294]\r\nwho possessed among them the temple erected by the Spartans to Lycurgus.\r\nNorth again of these, and clustering around that sharp eminence which\r\nconstituted as it were a second Acropolis, were the habitations of the\r\nCynosuræ,[295] whose quarter appears to have extended from the old\r\nbridge over the Eurotas to the temple of Dictynna, and the tombs of the\r\nEuripontid kings on the west. From this point to the Dromos, lying\r\ndirectly opposite the southern extremity of the Isle of Plane Trees,\r\nformed by the diverging and confluent waters of the Tiasa, lay the\r\nvillage of the Messoatæ,[296] where were situated the tomb of Alcman,\r\nthe fountain Dorcea, and a very beautiful portico overlooking the\r\nPlatanistas. The road extending from the Dromos to the Issorion formed\r\nthe western limits of the tribe of the Ægidæ,[297] whose quarter\r\nextending inward to the heart of the city, appears to have comprehended\r\nthe Acropolis, the Lesche Pœcile, the theatre, with all the other\r\nbuildings grouped about the foot of the ancient city.\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. i. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  See Müller, Dor. ii. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  Paus.

The face of the ground was broken and diversified, rising\r\ninto six hills of unequal elevation, and constituting altogether a small\r\ntable-land, in some places terminating in perpendicular cliffs;[298] in\r\nothers, shelving away in gentle slopes to meet the meadows on the banks\r\nof the surrounding streams. Over all was diffused the brilliant\r\nlight[299] which fills the atmosphere of the south, and paints, as\r\ntravellers uniformly confess, even the barren crag and crumbling ruin\r\nwith beauty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  Leake, Trav. in Morea, v. i. p. 154.\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Chateaub. Itin. i. 112. Similar, also, is the testimony of Mr.\r\n  Douglas. “The mixture of the romantic with the rich, which still\r\n  diversifies its aspect, and the singularly picturesque form of all its\r\n  mountains, do not allow us to wonder that even Virgil should generally\r\n  desert his native Italy for the landscape of Greece; whoever has\r\n  viewed it in the tints of a Mediterranean spring, will agree with me\r\n  in attributing much of the Grecian genius to the influence of scenery\r\n  and climate.” Essay, &c. p. 52.\r\n\r\nThe structures that occupied the summit of the Acropolis appear to have\r\nbeen neither numerous nor magnificent. The central pile, around which\r\nall the others were grouped, was the temple of Athena Chalciœcos,[300]\r\nflanked on the north and south by the fanes of Zeus Cosmetas and the\r\nMuses. Behind it rose the temple of Aphrodite Areia, with that of\r\nArtemis Cnagia, and in front various other edifices and statues,\r\ndedicated to Euryleonis, Pausanias, Athena Ophthalmitis, and Ammon.\r\nSomewhere in the neighbourhood of the temenos of Athena stood two\r\nedifices, one called Skenoma and the other Alpion. The relative position\r\nof all these it is now extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\r\ndetermine. Let us therefore descend into the agora, and having briefly\r\ndescribed the objects which there offered themselves to the eye of the\r\nstranger, endeavour to thread our way through the various streets of\r\nSparta, pointing out as we go along the most remarkable monuments it\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Apophtheg. Lacon. Archid. 6. Lycurg. 7.\r\n\r\nIn all Greek cities the point of greatest importance, next to the\r\ncitadel, was the market-place, where the body of the citizens assembled\r\nnot only to buy and sell, but to transact public business, and perform\r\nmany ceremonies of their religion. Thus, in the agora of Sparta, in the\r\ncentre of which probably stood an altar, surrounded by the statues of\r\nApollo, Artemis, Leto, and the soothsayer Hagias who foretold the\r\nvictory of Lysander at Ægospotamos, sacred chorusses and processions\r\nwere exhibited during the Gymnopædia in honour of Phœbos Apollo, in\r\nconsequence of which, a part at least of the place obtained the name of\r\nChoros: here, likewise, was a colossal statue, erected in honour of the\r\nSpartan Demos, with a group representing Hermes bearing the infant\r\nDionysos in his arms, and a statue of King Polydoros, doubtless set up\r\nin the neighbourhood of his house, Boonetos, lying between the street\r\nAphetæ and the steep road leading up to the citadel. The edifices by\r\nwhich the agora was encircled, though in most cases, perhaps, far from\r\nmagnificent, when separately considered, presented a grand _coup-d’œil_.\r\nThis will be made evident if, placing ourselves near the central altar,\r\nwe enumerate and briefly describe them in the order in which they\r\nfollowed each other in the great circle of the agora. First, beginning\r\non the right-hand corner of the street Aphetæ we behold the palace of\r\nthe Bidiæi, the five magistrates who watched over the education of the\r\nyouth; next succeeds that of the Nomophylaces, or guardians of the laws;\r\nthen that of the Ephori; and, lastly, the senate-house, standing at the\r\ncorner of the street leading to Therapne. Crossing over to the\r\nsouth-eastern side of the Agora we behold a spacious and stately portico\r\ncalled the Persian, because erected from the spoils of the Persians. Its\r\ncolumns of white marble were adorned with bassi relievi representing\r\nPersian warriors, among others Mardonios and Artemisia daughter of\r\nLygdamis queen of Halicarnassos, who fought in person at the battle of\r\nSalamis. Beyond the road to Amyclæ, we meet with a range of temples to\r\nGaia, Zeus Agoræos, Athena, Poseidon the Preserver, Apollo, and Hera;\r\nand traversing the western street opening into the Theomelida, and\r\naffording us a glimpse in passing of the tombs of the Agid kings we\r\narrive at the ancient halls of the Ephori, containing the monuments of\r\nEpimenides and Aphareus. To this edifice succeed the statues of Zeus\r\nXenios and Athena Xenia. Next follows the temple of the Fates, near\r\nwhich was the tomb of Orestes lying on the left hand of the road leading\r\nto the sanctuary of Athena Chalciœcos. On the other side stands the\r\nhouse of King Polydoros, which obtained in after ages the name of\r\nBoonetos because purchased of his widowed queen with a certain number of\r\noxen. With this terminates the list of the buildings by which the Agora\r\nwas encompassed.\r\n\r\nQuitting, now, this central point, we proceed northward through the\r\nstreet called Aphetæ, and observe on the right hand at a short distance\r\nfrom each other three temples of Athena Keleuthia, together with the\r\nheroa of Iops, Lelex, and Amphiaraos. On the opposite side apparently,\r\nstood the temenos of Tænarian Poseidon, with a statue of Athena, erected\r\nby the Dorian colonists of Italy. We next arrive at a place called the\r\nHellenion, probably nothing more than a large open space or square in\r\nwhich the deputies or ambassadors of foreign states assembled on\r\nextraordinary occasions. Close to this was erected the monument of\r\nTalthybios. A little further on were the altar of Apollo Acreitas, the\r\nGasepton, a temple of earth, and another altar sacred to Apollo\r\nMaleates. At the end of the street, near the walls of the late city, was\r\na temple of Dictynna, with the tombs of the kings called Eurypontidæ.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Hellenion, and proceeding eastward up the great public\r\nroad leading to the bridge Babyx, you saw the temple of Arsinoë,\r\ndaughter of Leucippos, and sister to the wives of Castor and Polydeukes.\r\nFurther on, near the Phrouria or Barriers, stood a temple of Artemis;\r\nand advancing a little you came to the monument of the Eleian\r\nsoothsayers called Iamidæ, and the temple of Maron and Alpheios, who\r\nwere among the bravest of those who fell with Leonidas at Thermopylæ.\r\nBeyond this stood the fane of Zeus Tropæos erected after the reduction\r\nof Amyclæ, when all the ancient inhabitants of Laconia had been brought\r\nunder the yoke of the Dorians. Next followed the temple of the Great\r\nMother and the heroic monuments of Hippolytos and Aulon. On a spot\r\ncommanding the bridge stood the temple of Athena Alea.\r\n\r\nSetting out once more from the Agora, and advancing up the street\r\nleading towards the east the first building on the left-hand was called\r\nSkias[301] contiguous to the senate-house: it was of a circular form\r\nwith a roof like an umbrella, and erected about seven hundred and sixty\r\nyears before Christ, by Theodoros of Samos, inventor of the art of\r\ncasting statues in iron. Here the Spartan people held their assemblies\r\neven so late as the age of Pausanias, who relates that the lyre of\r\nTimotheus[302] the Milesian, confiscated as a punishment for his having\r\nadded four strings to the seven already in use, was suspended in this\r\nbuilding as a warning to all innovators. Near the Skias was another\r\ncircular building erected by Epimenides, containing statues of Olympian\r\nZeus and Aphrodite. On the other side apparently of the street, in front\r\nof the Skias, were the tombs of Idas and Lynceus, the temple of Kora\r\nSoteira, said to have been built by Orpheus, or Abaris the Hyperboræan,\r\nthe tomb of Cynortas and the temple of Castor. Near these were the\r\nstatues of Apollo Carneios, and Aphetæos, the latter of which marked the\r\npoint whence the suitors of Penelope started in their race for a wife,\r\nrunning up the street Aphetæ, whence the name. Immediately beyond this\r\nwas a square surrounded with porticoes, where all kinds of cheap wares\r\nwere anciently sold. Further on stood altars of Zeus, Athena, and the\r\nDioscuri, all surnamed Amboulioi; opposite which was the hill called\r\nColona whereon was erected a temple of Dionysos, and close at hand a\r\ntemenos sacred to the hero who conducted the god to Sparta. Not far from\r\nthe Dionysion was a temple of Zeus Euanemos, giver of gentle breezes;\r\nand immediately to the right the heroon of Pleuron. On the summit of a\r\nhill at a little distance stood a temple of the Argive Hera, together\r\nwith the fane erected in honour of Hera Hypercheiria, built by order of\r\nthe oracle after the subsiding of an inundation of the Eurotas. In this\r\nedifice was a very ancient wooden statue of Aphrodite Hera. Close to the\r\nroad which passed to the right of the hill was a statue of Etymocles\r\nmany times victor in the Olympic games. In descending towards the\r\nEurotas you beheld a wooden statue of Athena Alea, and a little above\r\nthe banks a temple of Zeus Plousios. On the further side of the river\r\nwere temples of Ares and Asclepios.\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Σκιὰς, τὸ ᾠδεῖον ἐκαλεῖτο τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων κατὰ τὴν ἀρχαίαν φωνήν. κ.\r\n  τ. λ.—Etym.

Agis, § 10.\r\n\r\nOnce more retracing our steps to the Agora, and quitting it by a street\r\nleading towards the west, the first remarkable object that struck the\r\neye was the cenotaph of Brasidas, and a little beyond it a spacious and\r\nbeautiful theatre of white marble.[303] Directly opposite were the tombs\r\nof Leonidas and Pausanias, and near these a cippus, on which were\r\nengraved the names of the heroes who fell at Thermopylæ, together with\r\nthose of their fathers. At this spot games were annually celebrated, in\r\nwhich none but Spartans were allowed to contend for the prizes.\r\nDiscourses were likewise here pronounced in honour of the dead. The\r\nmultitudes at these games required a large clear space in which to\r\ncongregate, and this I suppose to have been the place called Theomelida,\r\nopening on both sides of the road, and extending as far as the tombs of\r\nthe Agid Kings, and the Lesche of the Crotoniatæ. Near this edifice\r\nstood the temple of Asclepios, the tomb of Tænaros, and temples of\r\nPoseidon Hippocourios, and Artemis Ægeinea. Turning back towards the\r\nLesche, probably round the foot of the Hill of the Issorion,[304] you\r\nobserved on the slope of the eminence towards the Tiasa the temple of\r\nArtemis Limnæa the Britomartis of the Cretans, somewhere in the vicinity\r\nof which were temples of Thetis, Chthonian Demeter, and Olympian Zeus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  This theatre, as Mr. Douglas has observed, is the only remaining\r\n  fragment of ancient Sparta, the other ruins still visible on its site,\r\n  belonging all to Roman times.—Essay on certain Points of Resemblance\r\n  between the Ancient and Modern Greeks, p. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  Ἰσσώριον, ὄρος τῆς Λακωνικῆς ἀφ’ οὗ ἡ Ἄρτεμις Ἰσσωρία.—Steph.

Agesil. § 32.\r\n\r\nStarting from the crossroad at the north-west foot of the Issorion, on\r\nthe way to the Dromos, the first edifice which presented itself on the\r\nleft was the monument of Eumedes, one of the sons of Hippocoon. A little\r\nfurther on was a statue of Heracles, and close at hand, near the\r\nentrance to the Dromos, stood the ancient palace of Menelaos, inhabited\r\nin Pausanias’ time by a private individual. Within the Dromos itself\r\nwere two gymnasia. This was the most remarkable building in the western\r\npart of the city, from whence branched off many streets, while numerous\r\npublic structures clustered round it; to the north, for example, the\r\ntemples of the Dioscuri, of the Graces, of Eileithyia, of Apollo\r\nCarneios, and Artemis Hegemona: on the east the temple of Asclepios\r\nAgnitas, and a trophy erected by Polydeukes after his victory over\r\nLynceus. On the west towards the Platanistas were statues of the\r\nDioscuri Apheterii, and a little further was the heroon of Alcon, near\r\nwhich stood the temple of Poseidon Domatites, near the bridge leading\r\nover to the island covered with plane trees. On the other hand\r\napparently of the road a statue was erected to Cynisca, daughter of\r\nArchidamos, the first lady who ran horses at Olympia.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the Tiasa from the Dromos to a line extending\r\nwestward from the temple of Dictynna to the upper bridge leading to the\r\nPlatanistas, lay a road adorned with numerous public buildings, among\r\nothers a portico, behind which were two remarkable monuments, the heroa\r\nof Alcimos and Enaræphoros. Immediately beyond were the heroa of Dorceus\r\nand Sebros, and the fountain Dorcea flowing between them. The whole of\r\nthis little quarter obtained from the latter hero the name of Sebrion.\r\nTo the right of the last mentioned heroon was the monument of the poet\r\nAlcman;[305] beyond which lay the temple of Helen, and near it that of\r\nHeracles close to the modern wall.\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  Ἀλκμάν, Λάκων ἀπὸ Μεσσόας.—He was an erotic poet said to have been\r\n  descended from servile parents.—Suid. i. p. 178. ed. Port.\r\n\r\nHard by a narrow pathway, striking into the fields from the road leading\r\neastward from the Dromos, was the temple of Athena Axiopænos, said to\r\nhave been erected by Heracles.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Dromos by another road running in a south-easterly direction\r\nthrough the midst of the quarter of the Ægidæ, we behold, on one hand,\r\nthe temples of Athena and Hipposthenes, and directly opposite the\r\nlatter, a statue of Ares in chains. At a short distance beyond these was\r\nthe Lesche Pœcile, and in front of it, the heroon of Cadmos son of\r\nAgenor, those of two of his descendants, Œolycos and his son Ægeus, and\r\nthat of Amphilocos. Farther on lay the temples of Hera Ægophagos, so\r\ncalled because she-goats were sacrificed to her, and at the foot of the\r\nAcropolis, near the theatre, the temples of Poseidon Genethlios, on\r\neither side of which probably stood an heroon, the one sacred to\r\nCleodæos son of Hyllos, and the other to Œbalos.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the Lesche Pœcile, and following a road skirting\r\nround the hill of the Acropolis, towards the east-south-east, pass by\r\nthe monument of Teleclos, and the most celebrated of all the temples of\r\nAsclepios at Sparta, situated close to the Boonetos. Traversing the\r\nstreet Aphetæ and proceeding along the road leading to the Limnæ, the\r\nfirst temple on the left was that of Aphrodite, on a hill, celebrated by\r\nPausanias for having two stories. The statue of the goddess was here\r\nseated, veiled and fettered. A little beyond was the temple of Hilaeira\r\nand Phœbe wherein were statues of the two goddesses, the countenance of\r\none of which was painted and adorned by one of the priestesses according\r\nto the later rules of art, but warned by a dream she suffered the other\r\nto remain in its archaic simplicity. Here was preserved an egg adorned\r\nwith fillets and suspended from the roof, said to have been brought\r\nforth by Leda. In a building near at hand, certain women wove annually a\r\ntunic for the Apollo of Amyclæ, from which circumstance the edifice\r\nitself obtained the name of Chiton. Next followed the house of the\r\nTyndaridæ, the heroa of Chilon and Athenæus, and the temple of Lycurgus,\r\nwith the tomb of Eucosmos behind it. Near them was the altar of Lathria\r\nand Anaxandra, and directly opposite the monuments of Theopompos and\r\nEurybiades and Astrabacos. In an island in the marshes were the temple\r\nand altar of Artemis Orthia, and the fane of Eileithyia.\r\n\r\nOn the road leading from the Agora to Amyclæ[306] there were few\r\nremarkable monuments. One only, the temple of the Graces, is mentioned\r\nnorth of the Tiasa, and beyond it the Hippodrome; towards the west the\r\ntemple of the Tyndaridæ near the road, and that of Poseidon Gaiouchos\r\ntowards the river.[307]\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  Οὗ τὸ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερόν. Strab. viii. 5. t. ii. p. 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Hellen. vi. 5. 30.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the proofs on which the above description is based.\r\nPausanias informs us that the citadel was the highest of the hills of\r\nSparta. Colonel Leake observes that the eminence found in the quarter\r\nwhich I have assigned to the Cynosuræ is equal in height to that\r\nimmediately behind the theatre; but the former is pointed and appears to\r\nhave retained its natural shape, while the summit of the latter has been\r\nlevelled for building. Now if its height be still equal, it must have\r\nbeen considerably greater before the levelling process took place.\r\nTherefore the hill behind the theatre was the Acropolis. Admitting this,\r\nthe spacious flat or hollow immediately at its foot on the south-east\r\nside must have been the Agora,[308] for that the Agora was close to the\r\ncitadel is clear from history, which represents Lycurgus and king\r\nCharilaos escaping thither from the market-place.[309] Again we know\r\nfrom Pausanias that it lay a little to the east of the theatre, having\r\nnothing between them but the cenotaph of Brasidas. The position of the\r\nAgora being thus fixed beyond dispute, we arrive with certainty at the\r\ndirection of the four great streets that diverge from it; for, first, we\r\nknow that the road to the Issorion lay towards the west; the road to\r\nAmyclæ towards the south. The street called Skias terminated at the\r\nextremity of the city between two small hills. These two hills are still\r\nthere on the brink of the high ground overlooking the valley of the\r\nEurotas on the east. This therefore was the direction of the Skias. As\r\nan additional proof, it may be mentioned that the temple of Hera\r\nHypercheiria was erected in commemoration of the subsiding of an\r\ninundation of the Eurotas, which shows it must have been somewhere\r\nnearly within reach of the waters of that stream. For the street Aphetæ\r\nno direction is left but that towards the north-west or the north-east;\r\nbut the latter led to the temple of Artemis Orthia in the Limnæ, the\r\nformer to the temple of Dictynna. The street Aphetæ led therefore to the\r\nnorth-west, no other road being mentioned but that leading from Mount\r\nThornax over the bridge Babyx, which was not the street called Aphetæ.\r\nThus we have the direction of every one of the great streets of Sparta\r\nincontrovertibly determined. Proceed we now to establish the position,\r\nwith respect to the citadel, of each of the five tribes who occupied as\r\nmany quarters of the city. First we learn from Pausanias that the\r\nPitanatæ inhabited the quarter round the Issorion:[310] from Pindar[311]\r\nand his scholiast that they dwelt likewise near the banks of the\r\nEurotas. They possessed therefore the whole southern quarter of the\r\ncity.[312] As the Limnatæ obtained their name from the marshes near\r\nwhich they lived, the position of the Limnæ determined by the chain of\r\nreasoning given above, proves them to have occupied the eastern quarter\r\nof the city directly opposite the temple of Artemis Orthia. That the\r\ntribe of the Ægidæ inhabited all that part extending in one direction\r\nfrom the Issorion to the Dromos, and in the other from the banks of the\r\nTiasa to the Boonetos, may almost with certainty be inferred from the\r\ncircumstance that the tomb of Ægeus, their founder, was situated in this\r\nquarter, close to the Lesche Pœcile. The quarter of the Mesoatæ lay in\r\nthe north-west, between the Dromos and the temple of Dictynna; for here\r\nwas found the tomb of Alcman who belonged to that tribe. All the rest of\r\nthe site being thus occupied, there remains only for the tribe of the\r\nCynosuræ that part lying between the road to Thornax and the temple of\r\nDictynna, where accordingly we must suppose them to have lived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

Athen. i. 57.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the bridge Babyx, if bridge it really was, it appears\r\nvery difficult[313] to believe that it spanned the Tiasa, though we\r\nstill find massive ruins of arches in the channel of that stream. There\r\nseems to be much stronger reason for supposing it to have been thrown\r\nover the Eurotas, where the road from the Isthmus traversed it.[314] We\r\nshould then understand by the oracle which commanded Lycurgus to\r\nassemble his people between Babyx and Cnacion,[315] that he was to\r\ngather them together anywhere within the precincts of the city.\r\nAccordingly we find in the time of Lycurgus, that the Agora in the\r\ncentre of Sparta was the place were the Apellæ[316] were held. This,\r\ntoo, is evident, by the sense in which the matter was understood by\r\nPlutarch, who, speaking of the victory of the Bœotians over the Spartans\r\nat Tegyra, observes, that by this event it was made manifest that not\r\nthe Eurotas, or the space between Babyx and Cnacion alone produced brave\r\nand warlike men.[317] Now it appears to me, that a few meadows without\r\nthe city on which assemblies of the people were occasionally convened\r\ncould never be said to produce these people. I have therefore supposed\r\nthat Babyx was the bridge by which travellers coming from the Isthmus\r\nentered Sparta.\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  This, however, is the opinion of Mr. Müller, Dor. ii. 456.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  See the passage in which Xenophon (v. 5. 27), describes the advance of\r\n  the Thebans upon Sparta.\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

They regarded it as the matrix in which future\r\ngenerations are fashioned, and receive that peculiar temperament and\r\ncharacter belonging to the institutions that presided at their birth.\r\nTheir theories were so large as to comprehend the whole developement of\r\nindividual existence, from the moment when the human germ is quickened\r\ninto life until the grave closes the scene, and in many cases looked\r\nstill further; for the rites of initiation and a great part of their\r\nethics had reference to another world. On this account we find their\r\nlegislators possessed by extreme solicitude respecting the character of\r\nthose teachers into whose hands the souls of the people were to be\r\nplaced, to receive the first principles of good or evil, to be\r\ninvigorated, raised, and purified by the former, or by the latter to be\r\nperverted, or precipitated down the slopes of vice and effeminacy, by\r\nwhich nations sink from freedom to servitude. Among them, moreover, it\r\nwas never matter of doubt, whether the light of knowledge should be\r\nallowed to stream upon the summits of society only, or be suffered to\r\ndescend into its lower depths and visit the cottages of the poor.\r\nWhatever education had to impart was, in most states, imparted to all\r\nthe citizens, as far as their leisure or their capacity would permit\r\nthem to receive it. The whole object, indeed, of education among the\r\nGreeks was to create good citizens, from which it has by some been\r\ninferred that they confined their views to the delivering of secular\r\ninstruction. But this is to take a narrow and ignorant view of the\r\nsubject, since religion was not only an element of education but\r\nregarded as of more importance than all its other elements taken\r\ntogether. For it had not escaped the Hellenic legislators, that in many\r\ncircumstances of life man is placed beyond the reach and scrutiny of\r\nlaws and public opinion, where he must be free to act according to the\r\ndictates of conscience, which, if not rightly trained, purified, and\r\nrendered clearsighted by religion, will often dictate amiss. It is of\r\nthe utmost moment, therefore, that in these retired situations man\r\nshould not consider himself placed beyond the range of every eye, and so\r\nbe tempted to lay the foundation of habits which, begun in secrecy, may\r\nsoon acquire boldness to endure the light and set the laws themselves at\r\ndefiance. Accordingly over those retired moments in which man at first\r\nsight appears to commune with himself alone, religion was called in to\r\nteach that there were invisible inspectors, who registered, not only the\r\nevil deeds and evil words they witnessed, but even the evil thoughts and\r\nemotions of the heart, the first impulses to crime in the lowest abysses\r\nof the mind. Consistently with this view of the subject, we discover\r\neverywhere in Greek history and literature traces of an almost\r\npuritanical scrupulousness in whatever appeared to belong to religion,\r\nso that in addressing the Athenians St. Paul himself was induced to\r\nreproach them with the excesses of their devotional spirit, which\r\ndegenerated too frequently into superstition. But the original design\r\nwith which this spirit was cultivated was wise and good, its intention\r\nbeing to rescue men from the sway of their inferior passions,—from envy,\r\nfrom avarice, from selfishness, and to inspire them with faith in their\r\nown natural dignity by representing their actions as of sufficient\r\nimportance to excite the notice, provoke the anger, or conciliate the\r\nfavour of the immortal gods. This religion, which base and sordid minds\r\nregard as humiliating to humanity, was by Grecian lawgivers and founders\r\nof states contemplated as a kind of holy leaven designed by God himself,\r\nto pervade, quicken, and expand society to its utmost dimensions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  Dion Chrysostom tells a curious story respecting a blunder of the\r\n  Athenians on this subject. Apollo once commanding them, if they\r\n  desired to become good citizens, to put whatever was most beautiful in\r\n  the ears of their sons, they bored one of the lobes, and inserted a\r\n  gold earring, not comprehending the meaning of the God. But this\r\n  ornament would better have suited their daughters or the sons of\r\n  Lydians or Phrygians; but for the offspring of Greeks, nothing could\r\n  have been intended by the God but education and reason, the possessors\r\n  of which would probably become good men, and the preservers of their\r\n  country.—Orat. xxxii. t. i. p. 653. sqq.—The popular maxim that\r\n  knowledge is power may be traced to Plato.—De Rep. v. t. vi. p. 268.\r\n\r\nThe question which commands so much attention in modern states, viz.\r\nwhether education should be national and uniform, likewise much occupied\r\nthe thoughts of ancient statesmen, and it is known that in most cases\r\nthey decided in the affirmative. It may however be laid down as an\r\naxiom, that among a phlegmatic and passive-minded people, where the\r\ngovernment has not yet acquired its proper form and developement, the\r\nestablishment of a national system of education, complete in all its\r\nparts and extending to the whole body of the citizens, must be\r\ninfallibly pernicious. For such as the government is at the commencement\r\nsuch very nearly will it continue, as was proved by the example of Crete\r\nand Sparta. For the Cretan legislators, arresting the progress of\r\nsociety at a certain point by the establishment of an iron system of\r\neducation, before the popular mind had acquired its full growth and\r\nexpansion, dwarfed the Cretan people completely, and by preventing their\r\nkeeping pace with their countrymen rendered them in historical times\r\ninferior to all their neighbours. In Sparta, again, the form of polity\r\ngiven to the state by Lycurgus, wonderful for the age in which it was\r\nframed, obtained perpetuity solely by the operation of his pædonomical\r\ninstitutions. The imperfection, however, of the system arose from this\r\ncircumstance, that the Spartan government was framed too early in the\r\ncareer of civilisation. Had its lawgiver lived a century or two later,\r\nhe would have established his institutions on a broader and more\r\nelevated basis, so that they would have remained longer nearly on a\r\nlevel with the progressive institutions of neighbouring states. But he\r\nfixed the form of the Spartan commonwealth when the general mind of\r\nGreece had scarcely emerged from barbarism; and as the rigid and\r\nunyielding nature of his laws forbade any great improvement, Sparta\r\ncontinued to bear about her in the most refined ages of Greece\r\ninnumerable marks of the rude period in which she had risen. From this\r\ncircumstance flowed many of her crimes and misfortunes. Forbidden to\r\nkeep pace with her neighbours in knowledge and refinement, which by\r\nrendering them inventive, enterprising, and experienced, elevated them\r\nto power, she was compelled, in order to maintain her ground, to have\r\nrecourse to astuteness, stratagem, and often to perfidy.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan system, it is well known, made at first, and for some ages,\r\nlittle or no use of books. But this, at certain stages of society, was\r\nscarcely an evil;[319] for knowledge can be imparted, virtues implanted\r\nand cherished, and great minds ripened to maturity without their aid.\r\nThe teacher, in this case, rendered wise by meditation and experience,\r\ntakes the place of a book, and by oral communication, by precept, and by\r\nexample, instructs, and disciplines, and moulds his pupil into what he\r\nwould have him be. By this process both are benefited. The preceptor’s\r\nmind, kept in constant activity, acquires daily new force and expansion;\r\nand the pupil’s in like manner. In a state, therefore, like that of\r\nSparta, in the age of Lycurgus, it was possible to acquire all necessary\r\nknowledge without books, of which indeed very few existed. But\r\nafterwards, when the Ionian republics began to be refined and elevated\r\nby philosophy and literature, Sparta, unable to accompany them, fell\r\ninto the background: still preserving, however, her warlike habits she\r\nwas enabled on many occasions to overawe and subdue them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  Montagne relates, in his Travels (t. iii. p. 51), an instance of how\r\n  the mind may be cultivated, particularly in poetry, by persons\r\n  ignorant of the art of reading and writing. His Lucchese\r\n  improvisatrice may be regarded as a match for the ancient rhapsodists.\r\n\r\nAmong the Athenians,[320] though knowledge was universally diffused,\r\nthere existed, properly speaking, no system of national education. The\r\npeople, like their state, were in perpetual progress, aiming at\r\nperfection, and sometimes approaching it; but precipitated by the excess\r\nof their intellectual and physical energies into numerous and constantly\r\nrecurring errors. While Sparta, as we have seen, remained content with\r\nthe wisdom indigenous to her soil, scanty and imperfect as it was,\r\nAthens converted herself into one vast mart, whither every man who had\r\nanything new to communicate hastened eagerly, and found the sure reward\r\nof his ingenuity. Philosophers, sophists, geometricians, astronomers,\r\nartists, musicians, actors, from all parts of Greece and her most\r\ndistant colonies, flocked to Athens to obtain from its quick-sighted,\r\nversatile, impartial, and most generous people that approbation which in\r\nthe ancient world constituted fame. Therefore, although the laws\r\nregulated the material circumstances of the schools and gymnasia,\r\nprescribed the hours at which they should be opened and closed, and\r\nwatched earnestly over the morals both of preceptors and pupils, there\r\nwas a constant indraught of fresh science, a perpetually increasing\r\nexperience and knowledge of the world, and, consequent thereupon, a\r\ndeep-rooted conviction of their superiority over their neighbours, an\r\nimpatience of antiquated forms, and an audacious reliance on their own\r\npowers and resources which betrayed them into the most hazardous schemes\r\nof ambition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

De Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 1.\r\n\r\nBut, by pushing too far their literary and philosophical studies, the\r\nAthenians were induced at length to neglect the cultivation of the arts\r\nof war, which they appeared to regard as a low and servile drudgery. And\r\nthis capital error, in spite of all their acquirements and achievements\r\nin eloquence and philosophy,—in spite of their lofty speculation and\r\n“style of gods,” brought their state to a premature dissolution; while\r\nSparta, with inferior institutions, and ignorance which even the\r\nchildren at Athens would have laughed at, was enabled much longer to\r\npreserve its existence, from its impassioned application to the use of\r\narms, aided, perhaps, by a stronger and more secluded position. From\r\nthis it appears that of all sciences that of war is the chiefest, since,\r\nwhere this is cultivated, a nation may maintain its independence without\r\nthe aid of any other; whereas the most knowing, refined, and cultivated\r\nmen, if they neglect the use of arms, will not be able to stand their\r\nground against a handful even of barbarians. They mistake, too, who look\r\nupon literature and the sciences as a kind of palladium against\r\nbarbarism,[321] for a whole nation may read and write, like the\r\ninhabitants of the Birman empire, without being either civilised or\r\nwise; and may possess the best books and the power to read them, without\r\nbeing able to profit by the lessons of wisdom they contain, as is proved\r\nby the example of the Greeks and Romans, who perished rather from a\r\nsurfeit of knowledge than from any lack of instruction. But it is time,\r\nperhaps, to quit these general speculations, and proceed to develope, as\r\nfar as existing monuments will enable us, the several systems of\r\neducation which prevailed in the different parts of Greece.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding that Plato regards knowledge as the medicine of the\r\n  soul.—Crit. t. vii. p. 145.—Cf. t. viii. p. 2. seq.—Aristot. Ethic.\r\n  vi. 13.\r\n\r\nAmong Hellenic legislators the care of children commenced before their\r\nbirth. Their mothers were subject while pregnant to the operation of\r\ncertain rules; their food and exercises were regulated, and in most\r\ncases the laws, or at least the manners, required them to lead a\r\nsedentary, inactive, and above all a tranquil life.[322] Physicians,\r\nguided by experience, prescribed a somewhat abstemious diet; and wine\r\nwas prohibited, or only permitted to be taken with water, which, where\r\nreason is consulted, we find to be the practice at the present day. But\r\nLycurgus, in the article of exercise, gave birth to, or, at least,\r\nsanctioned, customs wholly different.[323] Even while _enceinte_ his\r\nwomen were required to be abroad, engaged in their usual athletic\r\nrecreations, eating as before and drinking as before.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. l. vii. t. viii. pp. 4. et 11.—During the pregnancy of\r\n  women great care was taken not to bring into the house the wood of the\r\n  ostrya or carpinus ostrys, the appearance of which was ominous of\r\n  difficult births, or even of sudden death. Theoph. Hist. Plant. iii.\r\n  10. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. de Rep. Laced. i. 3. Perizon. ad Ælian. Var. Hist. x. 13.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, too, as on all others, the deep-rooted piety of the\r\nnation displayed itself. Prayers and sacrifices were habitually offered\r\nup by all married persons for children, as afterwards by Christian\r\nladies to the saints;[324] and these of course were not discontinued,\r\nwhen it appeared by unequivocal signs that their desires had begun to\r\nreceive their fulfilment. What the divinities were whom on these\r\noccasions the Athenian matrons invoked under the name of _Tritopatores_,\r\nit seems difficult to determine. Demon in Suidas[325] supposes them to\r\nbe the winds; but Philochoros, the most learned of ancient writers on\r\nthe antiquities of Attica, imagined them to be the first three sons of\r\nHelios and Gaia. According to some they were called Cottos or Coros,\r\nGyges or Gyes, and Briareus; according to others Amalcides, Protocles,\r\nand Protocleon, the watchers and guardians of the wind. There are\r\nauthors, moreover, by whom they have been confounded with the Dii Kabyri\r\nof Samothrace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  Theodoret. iv. 921.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  _v._ Τριτοπ. t. ii. p. 947. b. seq.

This goddess, who by Olen the Lycian was\r\nconsidered older than Kronos,[326] had the honour as certain mythical\r\nlegends relate, of being the mother of love,[327] though several ancient\r\nauthors appear to have confounded her with Pepromene or Fate, others\r\nwith Hera, and others again with Artemis or the moon. The traditions of\r\nthe mythology respecting this divinity were various. Her worship seems\r\nto have made its first appearance among the Greeks in the island of\r\nDelos, whither she is said to have come from the country of the\r\nHyperboreans, to lend her aid to Leto, when beneath the palm tree, which\r\nZeus caused to spring up over her,[328] she gave birth to the gods of\r\nnight and day. From that time forward she was held in veneration by the\r\nDelians, who in her honour offered up sacrifices, chaunting the hymns of\r\nOlen, whence we may infer she was a Pelasgian deity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  Paus. viii. 21. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Paus. ix. 27. 2. Cf. Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  Callim. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nFrom thence her name and worship were diffused through the other islands\r\nand states of Hellas; though the Cretans pretended that she was born at\r\nAmnisos in the Knossian territory, and was a daughter of Hera. The\r\nAthenians, who erected a temple to Eileithyia appeared to favour both\r\ntraditions, since of the two statues which were found in her fane the\r\nmore ancient was said to have been brought from Delos by Erisicthon,\r\nwhile the second, dedicated by Phædra, came from Crete. Among the\r\nAthenians, alone, as an indication of the national modesty, the wooden\r\nimages of this mysterious divinity were significantly veiled to the\r\ntoes.[329]\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 18. 5. Cf. Keightley, Mythol. p. 193. In Arcadia, also, this\r\n  goddess was so closely draped that nothing was visible but the\r\n  countenance, fingers, and toes.—Paus. vii. 23. 5.\r\n\r\nThe simple delicacy of remoter ages required women to be attended, while\r\nbecoming mothers, by individuals of their own sex. But the contrary\r\npractice, now general among civilised nations, prevailed early at\r\nAthens, where the study of medicine, in which the accoucheur’s[330] art\r\nis included, was prohibited to women and slaves. The consequences bear\r\nstronger testimony to the refined taste and truly feminine feelings of\r\nthe Athenian ladies than a thousand panegyrics. Numbers, rather than\r\nsubmit to the immodest injunctions of fashion, declined all aid, and\r\nperished in their harems: observing which, and moved strongly by the\r\ndesire to preserve the lives of her noble-minded countrywomen, a female\r\ncitizen named Agnodice, disguised as a man, acquired a competent\r\nknowledge of the theory and practice of physic in the medical school of\r\nHerophilos; she then confided her secret to the women who universally\r\ndetermined to avail themselves of her services, and in consequence her\r\npractice became so extensive that the jealousy of the other\r\npractitioners was violently excited. In revenge, therefore, as she still\r\nmaintained her disguise, they preferred an accusation against her in the\r\ncourt of Areiopagos as a general seducer. To clear herself Agnodice made\r\nknown her sex, upon which the envious Æsculapians prosecuted her under\r\nthe provisions of the old law. In behalf of their benefactress the\r\nprincipal gentlewomen appeared in court, and mingling the highest\r\ntestimony in favour of Agnodice with many bitter reproaches, they not\r\nonly obtained her acquittal, but the repeal of the obnoxious law, and\r\npermission for any free woman to become an accoucheuse.[331]\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  The duties of an accoucheuse are briefly enumerated by Max. Tyr.\r\n  Dissert. xxviii. p. 333. Cf. Pignor. de Serv. 184.\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  Hygin. Fab. 274.\r\n\r\nMention is made by ancient writers of several rude and hardy tribes,\r\nwhose women, like those of Hindùstân at the present day, stood in very\r\nlittle need of the midwife’s aid. Thus Varro,[332] speaking of the rough\r\nshepherdesses of Italy, observes that among the countrywomen of Illyria,\r\nbringing forth children was regarded as a slight matter; for that,\r\nstepping aside from their work in the fields, they would return\r\npresently with an infant in their arms, having first bathed it in some\r\nfountain or running stream, appearing rather to have found, than given\r\nbirth to, a child. Nor are the manners of these uncultivated people at\r\nall altered in modern times, as appears from an anecdote related to\r\nPietro Vittore,[333] by Francesco Sardonati, professor of Latin at\r\nRagusa, who said that he saw a woman go out empty-handed to a forest for\r\nwood, and return shortly afterwards with a bundle on her head and a\r\nnew-born infant in her arms. At Athens, however, where the women were\r\npeculiarly tender and delicate, the young mother remained within doors\r\nfull six weeks,[334] when the festival of the fortieth day was\r\ncelebrated, after which she went forth, as our ladies do to be churched,\r\nto offer up sacrifices and return thanks in the temple of Artemis or\r\nsome other divinity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  De Re Rust. ii. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  Var. Lect. xxxiv. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  Meurs. Græc. Fer. p. 260. sqq. Censor. de Die Natali. c. 11.\r\n\r\nNew-born infants, when designed to be reared, were at Athens and in the\r\nrest of Greece bathed in cold water: at Sparta in wine, with the view of\r\nproducing convulsions and death should the child be feeble, whereas,\r\nwere its constitution strong and vigorous, it would thus they imagined,\r\n“acquire a greater degree of firmness, and get a temper in proportion,\r\nas Potter[335] expresses it, like steel in the quenching.”\r\nSwaddling-bands[336] also, in use throughout the rest of Greece, were\r\nbanished from Sparta, which led the way therefore to that improved\r\nsystem of infant management advocated by Rousseau, Lacépède and\r\nothers,[337] and now generally adopted in this country, though but\r\npartially in France. The ceremonies and customs of the Greeks were a\r\nkind of symbolical language, many times containing important meaning,\r\nand always perhaps indicative of the character and familiar feelings of\r\nthe race. Much stress was laid on the thing wherein the infant was\r\nplaced upon its entrance into the world. This, among the Athenians,\r\nconsisted of a wrapper adorned with an embroidered figure of the\r\nGorgon’s head, the device represented on the shield of Athena, tutelar\r\ndivinity of the state. From the beginning every citizen seemed thus to\r\nbe placed under the immediate shelter of that goddess’s ægis which\r\nshould be extended over him in peace and in war. In other parts of\r\nGreece the child’s first bed, and too frequently his last, was a\r\nshield.[338] In accordance with this custom we find Alcmena cradling her\r\ntwin boys Heracles and Iphicles in Amphytrion’s buckler; and the same\r\npractice prevailed, as might have been expected, at Sparta, where war\r\nconstituted to men the sole object of life.[339] Elsewhere other symbols\r\nspoke to the future sense rather than the present of the new citizen. In\r\nagricultural countries the military symbol was replaced by a winnowing\r\nvan, not unfrequently of gold or other costly materials;[340] though it\r\nmay be doubted whether the word so rendered meant not rather a cradle in\r\nthe form of that rustic implement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Antiq. ii. 320.\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Coray, ad Hippoc. de Aër. et Loc. ii. 309.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  Even so early as the age of Montaigne the necessity of some change was\r\n  felt. “Les liaisons et emmaillottements des enfans ne sont non plus\r\n  necessaires.” He then alludes to the practice of the Spartan\r\n  nurses.—Essais, ii. 12. However, in certain habits of body, swaddling\r\n  is not merely useful, but necessary: as Hippocrates remarks in his\r\n  account of the Scythians (de Aër. et Loc. § 101), and as his able\r\n  commentator, Coray, confirms by example. _ubi sup._\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  Theoc.

Hymn. in Jov. 48.\r\n\r\nIn another custom, long on these occasions observed, we discern traces\r\nof that serpent-worship which at different epochs diffused itself so\r\nwidely over the world. Among opulent and noble families at Athens\r\nnew-born children were laid on golden amulets in the form of dragons by\r\nwhich they were supposed to commemorate Athena’s delivery of\r\nErichthonios to the care of two guardians of that description.[341]\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  Eurip. Ion. 15. sqq.—There were certain amulets, too, called περίαπτα\r\n  which superstitious mothers hung about the necks of their children to\r\n  defend them from fascination and the evil eye. Pollux, iv. 182. Vict.\r\n  in Arist. Ethic. Nicom. p. 42.\r\n\r\nBut under certain circumstances, instead of the joy and gladness by\r\nwhich the noble and the great are greeted on their entrance into the\r\nworld, the birth of a child was, as in Thrace,[342] an event fraught\r\nwith sorrow and misery. It announced in fact the approach of an enemy,\r\nof one who, if he survived, must snatch from them a portion of what\r\nalready would scarcely sustain life. Together with the announcement of\r\nhis birth, therefore, came the awful consciousness that war must be made\r\non him—that he must in short be cast forth, a scape-goat for the sins of\r\nsociety, not for his own—that his parents who should have cherished him,\r\nwhose best solace he should have been, must steel their hearts and close\r\nfast their ears against the voice of nature, and become his\r\nexecutioners. The poor-laws of Greece, or rather their substitutes for\r\npoor-laws, were exceedingly imperfect, and foundling hospitals had not\r\nbeen introduced. They got rid of their surplus population, as many\r\nnations still do, by murder; for infanticide, under various forms, has\r\nmore or less prevailed in all civilised countries, if the term civilised\r\ncan properly be applied to nations among whom crimes so demoralising are\r\nhabitually perpetrated. No doubt the sullen reluctance of a father to\r\nimbrue his hands in the blood of his child produced daily many a\r\nheart-rending scene; no doubt the sting of want must have been keenly\r\nfelt before the habit of slaughter was confirmed;—but the fashion once\r\nset, children were thrown into an earthen pot and exposed in mountainous\r\nand desert places to perish of cold, or fall a prey to carnivorous\r\nbirds[343] or wolves, as coolly as they are murdered by their young and\r\nfrail mothers in our own Christian land.\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  Sext. Empir. p. 186.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  Vict. (Var. Lect. ii. 3) has an useful chapter on the exposing of\r\n  infants, in which he has collected several valuable testimonies.\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances, however, the parents thus criminal are objects\r\nof pity. Misery is blind, and crime is blind. But what shall we say to\r\nthose priests of humanity, those sacred and reverend interpreters of\r\nnature,—the philosophers who come forward to sanction and justify the\r\npractice? It would be criminal to disguise the fact, that both Plato and\r\nAristotle, the great representatives of the wisdom of the Pagan\r\nworld,[344] conceived infanticide, under certain circumstances, to be\r\nallowable. Near, therefore, as the former stood to the truths of\r\nChristianity, there was still a cloud between him and them. What he saw,\r\nhe saw through a glass darkly. Christ had not then stamped the seal of\r\ndivinity upon human nature, had not shed abroad that light by which\r\nalone we discover the true features of crime, no less than the true\r\nfeatures of holiness. Philosophy is beautiful; but with the beauty of\r\none involuntarily polluted. Religion alone, breathing of heaven, radiant\r\nwith light, reflected on its whole form from the face of God, is lovely\r\naltogether without spot or blemish. The Greeks wanting this guide went\r\nastray. They looked at the question of population as coarse\r\nutilitarians,—all but the gross, unintellectual Thebans, who, relying on\r\nthe vast fertility of their soil, or led by some better instinct, on\r\nthis point soared high above their cultivated neighbours, an example of\r\nhow the foolish things of this world, even in the unregenerate state of\r\nnature, may sometimes confound the wise. Among the Tyrrhenians,[345]\r\nlikewise, a people of Pelasgian origin, infanticide was unknown,\r\nprobably because among them it was accounted no disgrace to be the\r\nparents of illegitimate offspring; indeed the sense of shame could not,\r\nin any case, be very keen among a people whose female slaves served\r\nnaked at table, and where even the ladies appeared at public\r\nentertainments in the same state, drinking bumpers and joining freely in\r\nthe conversation of the men.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  Plato, de Rep. v. § 9. p. 359.

It\r\nwill, therefore, readily be supposed that in those countries of\r\nantiquity where neither law nor public opinion opposed the practice, but\r\nin some cases winked at, in others enjoined it, the number of\r\nchild-murders must have been enormous. Sparta very naturally took the\r\nlead in this guilty course.[346] Here it was not permitted to private\r\nindividuals to make away with their offspring stealthily, and with those\r\nmarks of shame and compunction inseparable from individual guilt. The\r\nstate monopolized the right to Herodise, and by sharing the criminality\r\namong great numbers appeared to silence the objections of conscience.\r\nFathers were compelled by law to bring their new-born infants to certain\r\nofficers, old, grave men,[347] who held their sittings in the Lesche of\r\ntheir tribe, and after due deliberation determined on the claim of each\r\nchild to live or die. By what rules they decided, rude and ignorant of\r\nphysiology as they were, it would now be impossible positively to\r\naffirm. Little skill no doubt had they in detecting the latent seeds of\r\nrobustness and physical energy, still less those of splendid mental\r\nendowments lurking in the crimson countenance of helpless infancy. They\r\nwho might have proved the wise and good of their generation no doubt\r\noften went instead of the mere animal. However, giving orders that the\r\nstrong and apparently healthy should be nursed, the weakly and delicate,\r\noften the noblest men, and the bravest soldiers, as witness Lucius\r\nSulla, were condemned to be cast like so many puppy dogs into the\r\nApothetæ, a deep cavern at the foot of Mount Taygetos. This den of death\r\nrelieved the Spartans from the necessity of erecting workhouses or\r\nenacting poor-laws. The surplus population went into that pit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  Compare the coolness of Hase. p. 190. Müller. ii. 313. with Lamb. Bos.\r\n  p. 212. seq. and the humane remarks of Ubbo Emmius iii. 83. Potter,\r\n  too (ii. 326. sqq.), seems to disapprove of the practice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lycurg. 16.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, and in a mitigated form, the same practice\r\nprevailed at Athens. Here, however, it was more a matter of custom than\r\nof law, and in this respect differed materially[348] from the practice\r\nof Sparta, that it was left entirely to the father to determine the fate\r\nof his children. Accordingly, the more cold-blooded had recourse to\r\nmurder, while the less atrocious exposed them in jars in desert places\r\nto perish, or in the thronged and crowded quarters of the city in the\r\nhope that they might excite in others that compassion, which he, their\r\nfather, denied them.[349] And humane individuals were often found who,\r\nlike our Squire Allworthy, would sympathise with these deserted\r\ncreatures.[350] Numerous examples occur in the comic poets. In these\r\ncases poverty was no doubt the motive, particularly when boys were\r\nexposed; but even wealthy persons, reasoning like the Rajpoots of\r\nnorthern India, would prefer exposing their daughters, to the care and\r\nexpense of educating them to an uncertain destiny. On these occasions\r\nthe child was dressed and swaddled more or less carefully, placed in a\r\nlarge earthen vessel called a chytra,[351]—the same in which soup was\r\nmade, and which ought, therefore, to have awakened humane\r\nassociations,—and laid at the mouth of some cave without the walls, or\r\nin such situations as I have above described. To this custom allusion is\r\nmade in the anecdote of a foundling, who amusing himself by rolling a\r\nchytra before him with his foot, “What! exclaimed some one desirous of\r\nreminding him of his origin, have you the impiety to kick your mother in\r\nthe belly?”[352]\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  Petit is of the contrary opinion, but his authorities by no means bear\r\n  him out.—Legg.

Thesmoph. 509.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the object was rather to escape shame than to shun the\r\nexpense of education, rings, jewels, or other valuable tokens were\r\nsuspended about the child, or put along with it into the chytra.[353]\r\nAnd in the comic writers these usually assist in bringing about a\r\ndiscovery. If they fell into the hands of the poor the costly marks of\r\nnoble birth, always held in honour by the ignorant and needy, would\r\nperhaps tempt them to preserve and cherish the off-cast, as in the case\r\nof Shakespeare’s Perdita, or in the event of death, would defray the\r\nexpenses of their funerals. Sometimes superstition operated on their\r\nminds, urging them into a mock show of sharing their possessions with\r\nthe little wretches they abandoned.[354] Thus Sostrata, wife of Chremes,\r\nin the Self-tormentor delivered along with her little daughter to the\r\nperson who was to expose it, a ring from her own finger to be left with\r\nthe child, that should it die it might not be wholly deprived of all\r\nshare of their property. Such also is the behaviour of Creusa in\r\nEuripides; for Hermes, whom the poet introduces unfolding the argument\r\nof the drama, relates that when the young princess laid her new-born son\r\nto perish in the cavern, where he had been conceived, she took off her\r\ncostly ornaments and with them decked her devoted boy.[355]\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  Vict.

From the sequel it would appear that such children were the\r\nslaves of the temple, and under the immediate protection of the\r\ngod.[358]\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  Conf. Hypoth.

Here, according to the poets, Antiope\r\nbrought forth Zethos and Amphion, twin sons of Zeus, whom, to conceal\r\nher shame, she abandoned where they were born. The infants were\r\nimmediately afterwards discovered by a shepherd, who, having bathed them\r\nin the neighbouring spring, took them to his cot, where they were\r\nbrought up as his own children.[359] The catastrophe of many an ancient\r\nplay was brought about by a discovery of the real characters of persons\r\nwho had been exposed in infancy. Thus Œdipus, whose story is too well\r\nknown to need repetition, was abandoned on Mount Cithæron. The daughters\r\nof Phineus,[360] of whom nothing else has come down to us, had been cast\r\nforth in infancy and preserved, and were afterwards brought to be put to\r\ndeath on the same spot; by alluding to which their lives were saved. The\r\nsons,[361] likewise, of Tyro, Peleus and Neleus, were deserted by their\r\nmother, who placed them in a little bark or chest on the banks of the\r\nEnipeus, a circumstance which served afterwards to reveal the parentage\r\nof the twins. The story of Romulus and Remus, who were thus abandoned by\r\ntheir vestal mother, is familiar to every reader; and from the example\r\nof Moses recorded in the sacred volume, we may infer that the exposing\r\nof children was common in remoter ages in Egypt. Pindar,[362] in\r\nrelating the birth of the prophet Iamos, presents us with a poetical\r\npicture of one of these unhappy transactions. Evadne, daughter of\r\nPoseidon by the river-nymph Pitana, dwelling at the court of Æpytos a\r\nking of Arcadia, going forth, like the daughters of the Patriarchs, to\r\ndraw water from a fountain, is overtaken by her birth-pangs.\r\n\r\n            “Her crimsoned girdle down was flung,\r\n              The silver ewer beside her laid,\r\n            Amid a tangled thicket, hung\r\n              With canopy of brownest shade;\r\n            When forth the glorious babe she brought,\r\n            His soul instinct with heavenly thought.\r\n            Sent by the golden-tressed god,\r\n            Near her the Fates indulgent stood,\r\n            With Eileithyia mild.\r\n            One short sweet pang released the child,\r\n            And Iamos sprang forth to light.\r\n            A wail she uttered; left him then,\r\n              Where on the ground he lay;\r\n            When straight two dragons came,\r\n            With eyes of azure flame,\r\n              By will divine awaked out of their den;\r\n            And with the bees’ unharmful venom they\r\n            Fed him, and nursled through the night and day.\r\n            The king meanwhile had come\r\n            From stony Pytho driving, and at home\r\n            Did of them all after the boy inquire\r\n            Born of Evadne; for, he said, the sire\r\n            Was Phœbos, and that he\r\n            Should of earth’s prophets wisest be,\r\n            And that his generation should not fail.\r\n            Not to have seen or heard him they avouched,\r\n            Now five days born. But he, on rushes couched,\r\n            Was covered up in that wide brambly maze;\r\n              His delicate body met\r\n            With yellow and empurpled rays\r\n              From many a violet:\r\n            And hence his mother bade him claim\r\n            For ever this undying name.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  Paus. ii. 6. 4.—Cf.

I give the passage as it is elegantly\r\n  translated by Mr. Cary.\r\n\r\nGenerally, it would appear, illegitimate children were exposed in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Gymnasium, in the Cynosarges, because, as suggested\r\nby Suidas, Heracles, who was himself a bastard, had a temple there.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of infanticide the Thebans,[363] as I have said,\r\nentertained juster sentiments than the rest of their countrymen. By\r\ntheir institutions it was made a capital crime; but because severe laws\r\nwould not furnish the indigent with the means of supporting the children\r\nthey were forbidden to kill, they by another enactment provided for\r\ntheir maintenance. If a poor man found himself unable to support an\r\naddition to his family, he was commanded to bear his children\r\nimmediately from the birth, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, to the\r\nmagistrates, who disposed of them for a small sum to wealthy people in\r\nwant of children or servants: for, according to the Theban laws, they\r\nwho undertook the charge of foundlings, if they may be so called, were\r\nentitled to their services in return for their nursing and education.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  Ælian, Var. Hist. ii. 7.—Cf. Phil. Jud. de Legg. Special. p. 543.\r\n\r\nConnected with infanticide is another subject equally important, but of\r\nvery difficult treatment; that is practices to destroy the infant before\r\nthe birth.[364] In modern nations all such offences are theoretically\r\nvisited with very severe punishment by the law, and public opinion so\r\nstrongly condemns them that no one solicitous of upholding a respectable\r\ncharacter in society will dare to be their apologist. It was otherwise\r\nin antiquity. The greatest dread of a superabundant population was in\r\nmany states felt, and led to customs and acts of a very nefarious\r\nnature; for some classes of which, if not for all, writers of highest\r\neminence are found to plead. Thus Pliny,[365] commonly a great declaimer\r\nin behalf of virtue, admits that some artificial limit should be put to\r\nfemale productiveness; and Aristotle, despite his far nobler and more\r\ngenerous ethics, had on this point no loftier views.

An ancient law attributed to Romulus has misled\r\nthem. By this it was enacted that no male child should be exposed; and\r\nthat of daughters the first should be permitted to live, while the\r\nothers having been brought up till they were three years old, might then\r\nif judged expedient be destroyed.[366] The legislator, it is argued,\r\nknew human nature too well to fear that parents who had preserved their\r\nchildren three years would after that take away their lives. But infants\r\nexceedingly mutilated or deformed might be killed at once, having first\r\nbeen shown to five neighbours, and these neighbours, like the overseers\r\nof murder at Lacedæmon, were probably lax in interpreting the law,\r\nwhich, acknowledging the principle, would easily tolerate variations in\r\nthe practice.[367] Be this, however, as it may, child-murder and child\r\ndropping were in imperial times of ordinary occurrence at Rome. There\r\nwas in the Herb-market a pillar called the “Milky column,”[368] whither\r\nfoundlings were brought to be suckled by public nurses, or to be fed\r\nwith milk—for the passage in Festus may be both ways interpreted, and\r\ntheir numbers would seem to have been considerable. The Christian\r\nwriters constantly object the practice of infanticide to the Romans.\r\n“You cast forth your sons,” says Tertullian,[369] “to be picked up and\r\nnourished by the first woman that passes.” And the poor, as Ambrose\r\nremarks, would desert and expose their little ones, and if caught deny\r\nthem to be theirs.[370] Others adopted more decisive measures, and\r\ninstead of exposing strangled them.[371] Probably, moreover, it was the\r\natrocious device of legislators to get rid of their superabundant\r\npopulation that gave rise to the rite of child-sacrificing known to have\r\nprevailed among the Phœnicians, who passed their children through fire\r\nto Moloch; and among their descendants the Carthaginians,[372] who\r\noffered up infants to their gods, as at the present day our own\r\nidolatrous subjects in the East cast forth their first-born infants on\r\nislands at the mouth of the Ganges, to be devoured by the alligators. In\r\nChina Christianity has performed for infancy the same humane duty as in\r\nancient Rome, as many of the converts made by the Jesuits consisted of\r\nfoundlings whom they had picked up when cast forth by their parents to\r\nperish in the streets.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  Dion.

Of these, the\r\nfirst was held on the fifth day from the birth, when took place the\r\nceremony called Amphidromia, confounded by some ancient authors with the\r\nfestival of the tenth day.[374] On this occasion the accoucheuse or the\r\nnurse, to whose care the child was now definitively consigned,[375]\r\nhaving purified her hands with water,[376] ran naked[377] with the\r\ninfant in her arms, and accompanied by all the other females of the\r\nfamily, in the same state, round the hearth,[378] which was regarded as\r\nthe altar of Hestia, the Vesta of the Romans. By this ceremony the child\r\nwas initiated in the rites of religion and placed under the protection\r\nof the fire goddess, probably with the same view that infants are\r\nbaptized among us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  More particularly that of a son.—Casaub. ad Theophr.

Fer. p. 21.\r\n\r\nBut it was on the seventh day that the child generally received its\r\nname,[385] amid the festivities of another banquet; though sometimes\r\nthis was deferred till the tenth.[386] The reason is supplied by\r\nAristotle.[387] They delayed the naming thus long, he says, because most\r\nchildren that perish in extreme infancy die before the seventh day,\r\nwhich being passed they considered their lives more secure. The eighth\r\nday was chosen by other persons for bestowing the name, and, this\r\nconsidered the natal day, was solemnized annually as the anniversary of\r\nits birth, on which occasion it was customary for the friends of the\r\nfamily to assemble together, and present gifts to the child, consisting\r\nsometimes of the polypi and cuttle-fish[388] to be eaten at the feast.\r\nHowever the tenth day[389] appears to have been very commonly observed.\r\nThus Euripides:[390]\r\n\r\n           “Say, who delighting in a mother’s claim\r\n           Mid tenth-day feasts bestowed the ancestral name?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  Alex. ab Alex. 99. a.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. _v._ Ἑβδομ. p. 92.

Jason, tyrant of Pheræ, most of\r\nwhose stratagems were played off against members of his own family, had\r\na brother named Meriones, extremely opulent, but to the last degree\r\nclose-fisted, particularly towards him. When at length a son was born to\r\nJason, he invited to the Nominalia many principal nobles of Thessaly,\r\nand among others his brother Meriones, who was to preside over the\r\nceremonies. In these he was probably occupied the whole day, during\r\nwhich, under pretence, apparently, of providing some choice game for his\r\nguests, the tyrant went out for a few hours with his dogs and usual\r\nfollowers. His real object, however, soon appeared. Making direct for\r\nPagasæ, where his brother’s castle stood, he stormed the place, and\r\nseizing on Meriones’ treasures, to the amount of twenty talents,\r\nreturned in all speed to the banquet. Here, by way of showing his\r\nfraternal consideration, he delegated to his brother the honour of\r\npouring forth the libations, and bestowing the name, which was the\r\nfather’s prerogative. But Meriones receiving from one of the tyrant’s\r\nattendants a hint of what had taken place, called the boy “Porthaon,” or\r\nthe “Plunderer.”[393] At Athens the feast and sacrifice took place at\r\nnight, with much pomp, and all the glee which such an occasion was\r\ncalculated to inspire.[394]\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  Græc.

Δεκάτην ἑστιάσαν, t. i. p. 654. c. d.\r\n\r\nOn the bestowing of the name Potter’s information is particularly full.\r\nHe is probably right, too, in his conjecture, that in most countries the\r\nprincipal object of calling together so great a number of friends to\r\nwitness this ceremony was to prevent such controversies as might arise\r\nwhen the child came out into the business of the world. But at Athens\r\nthe Act of Registration[395] rendered such witnesses scarcely necessary.\r\nThe right of imposing the name belonged, as hinted above, to the father,\r\nwho likewise appears to have possessed the power afterwards to alter it\r\nif he thought proper. They were compelled to follow no exact precedent;\r\nbut the general rule resembled one apparently observed by nature, which,\r\nneglecting the likeness in the first generation, sometimes reproduces it\r\nwith extraordinary fidelity in the second. Thus, the grandson inheriting\r\noften the features, inherited also very generally the name of his\r\ngrandfather,[396] and precisely the same rule applied to women; the\r\ngranddaughter nearly always receiving her grandmother’s name.[397] Thus,\r\nAndocides, son of Leagoras, bore the name of his grandfather; the father\r\nand son of Miltiades were named Cimon; the father and son of Hipponicos,\r\nCleinias.[398] The orator Lysias formed an exception to this rule, his\r\ngrandfather’s name having been Lysanias.[399] In short, though there\r\nexisted no law upon the subject, yet ancient and nearly invariable\r\ncustom operated with the force of law.[400]\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. v.

It came, in aftertimes, to be considered\r\nindecorous for persons of humble condition to assume the names of heroic\r\nfamilies. Thus, the low flatterer Callicrates, at the court of Ptolemy\r\nthe Third, was thought to be audacious because he bestowed upon his son\r\nand daughter the names of Telegonos and Anticleia, and wore the effigy\r\nof Odysseus in his ring, which appeared to be claiming kindred with that\r\nillustrious chief. In fact, to prevent the profanation of revered names,\r\nthe law itself forbade them to be adopted by slaves or females of bad\r\ncharacter,[405] though, in defiance of its enactments, we find there\r\nwere hetairæ, who derived their appellation from the sacred games of\r\nGreece, Nemeas, Isthmias, and Pythionica.[406]\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  See in Winkel. iii. p. 248, an account of a picture representing this\r\n  transaction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  Il. i. 552. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  Potter, ii. 225.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. τ. 406. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  Anim. ad Athen. t. xii. p. 170.\r\n\r\nBut of this enough: we now proceed to the management and education of\r\nchildren, beginning with their earliest infancy. In old times the women\r\nof Greece always suckled their own offspring, and for the performance of\r\nthis office they were excellently adapted by nature,[407] since they had\r\nno sooner become mothers than their breasts filled so copiously with\r\nmilk than it not only flowed through the nipple, but likewise transpired\r\nthrough the whole bosom. On the little derangements of the system\r\npeculiar to nurses the Greeks entertained many superstitious opinions;\r\nfor instance, they conceived those thread-like indurations which\r\nsometimes appear in the breasts to be caused by swallowing hairs, which\r\nafterwards come forth with the milk, on which account the disorder was\r\ncalled Trichiasis.[408] The nourishment supplied by mothers so robust\r\nand lactiferous was often so rich and abundant as, like over-feeding, to\r\ncause spasms and convulsions, supposed to be most violent when they\r\nhappened during the full moon, and began in the back. The usual remedy\r\namong nurses would appear to have been wine, since Aristotle,[409] in\r\nspeaking of the disorder, observes that white, particularly if diluted\r\nwith water, is less injurious than red, though even from the former he\r\nthought it better to abstain. The administering of aperient medicines\r\nand the absence from everything that could cause flatulence, he\r\nconsidered the only safe treatment. Nurses, however, sometimes placed\r\nmuch reliance on the brains of a rabbit.[410]\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  When the case happened to be otherwise the remedies recommended by\r\n  physicians were numerous, among which was the halimos, a prickly shrub\r\n  found growing along the northern shores of Crete.—Dioscor. i. 120.\r\n  Tournefort. i. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  Arist.

Rep. v. t. vi. p. 236.—The desire of the philosopher was, that\r\n  the people, or the state, should be regarded as the father of the\r\n  child. Among our ancestors illegitimate children were denominated\r\n  “sons of the people,” which was then thought equivalent to being the\r\n  sons of nobody. Hence the following distich:—\r\n\r\n          Cui pater est populus, pater est sibi nullus et omnis,\r\n          Cui pater est populus, non habet ipse patrem.\r\n\r\n                                                Fortescue, Laud.

Most men, through the defect of nature or\r\nearly discipline, live long before they acquire this mastery, which\r\nmany never attain at all. Generally, however, where it is possessed,\r\nmuch may certainly be attributed to that training which begins at the\r\nbirth, so that of all the instruments employed in the[413] forming of\r\ncharacter, the nurse is probably the most important. Of this the\r\nancients generally appear to have been convinced, and most of all the\r\nSpartans and Athenians. The Lacedæmonian nurses, on whom the force of\r\ndiscipline had been tried, enjoyed a high reputation throughout\r\nGreece, and were particularly esteemed at Athens.[414] They no doubt\r\ndeserved it. To them may be traced the first attempt to dispense with\r\nthose swathes and bandages which in other countries confined the\r\nlimbs, and impeded the movements of infants, and by their skilful and\r\nenlightened treatment, combined with watchfulness and tender\r\nsolicitude, they are said to have preserved their little charges from\r\nthose distortions so common among children. But their cares extended\r\nbeyond the person. They aimed at forming the manners, regulating the\r\ntemper, laying the foundation of virtuous habits, at sowing in short\r\nthe seeds, which in after life, might ripen into a manly, frank, and\r\ngenerous character. In the matter of food, in the regulating of which,\r\nas Locke confesses, there is much difficulty, the Spartan nurses acted\r\nup to the suggestions of the sternest philosophy, accustoming the\r\nchildren under their charge, to be content with whatever was put\r\nbefore them, and to endure occasional privations without murmuring.\r\nOver the fear of ghosts too they triumphed. Empusa and the\r\nMormolukeion, and all those other hideous spectres which childhood\r\nassociates with the idea of darkness, yielded to the discipline of the\r\nSpartan nurse.[415] Her charge would remain alone or in the dark,\r\nwithout terror, and the same stern system, which overcame the first\r\noffspring of superstition, likewise subdued the moral defects of\r\npeevishness, frowardness, and the habit of whining and mewling, which\r\nwhen indulged in render children a nuisance to all around them. No\r\nwonder therefore, these Doric disciplinarians were everywhere in\r\nrequest. At Athens it became fashionable among the opulent to employ\r\nthem, and Cleinias, as is well known, placed under the care of one of\r\nthese she-pædagogues that Alcibiades, whose ambitious character, to be\r\ncurbed by no restraints of discipline or philosophy, proved the ruin\r\nof his country and the scourge of Greece.[416]\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  Repub. i. 315.

It being\r\n  customary among the Laconians to drink moderately in the syssitia,\r\n  says Plutarch, they went home without a torch, it not being lawful\r\n  to make use of a light on these or any other occasions, in order\r\n  that they might be accustomed to walk by night and in darkness\r\n  boldly, and without fear. Instit. Lacon. § 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lycurg. § 16.\r\n\r\nPlato, however, while framing at will an imaginary system, and though\r\ninclined upon the whole to laconise, adheres, in some respects, to the\r\ncustoms of his country, and ordains that infants be confined by\r\nswaddling bands till two years old. From the mention of this age, it\r\nmay be inferred that children commonly did not walk much earlier at\r\nAthens, which is the case in the East, as we may learn from the story\r\nof Ala-ed-deen Abushamet. Plato would also have nurses to be vigorous\r\nand robust women, much inclined to frequent the temples, in order,\r\nprobably, to introduce into the minds of their charges early\r\nimpressions of religion, and to stroll about the fields and public\r\ngardens until the children could run alone; and even then, and until\r\nthey were three years old, he urged the necessity of their being\r\nfrequently carried, to prevent crooked legs and malformed ankles. But\r\nbecause all this might press hard on one nurse, several were employed,\r\nas among ourselves,[417] and a kind of Nursery Governess overlooked\r\nthe whole. The Gerula or under-nurse was, in later times, the person\r\nupon whom fell the principal labour of bearing the infant about; but\r\nin remoter ages the Greeks, more particularly their royal and noble\r\nfamilies, employed in this capacity a Baioulos[418] or nurse-father,\r\nwho, as in the case of Phœnix, was sometimes himself of illustrious\r\nbirth. Cheiron, too, the Pelasgian mountain prince, performed this\r\nsacred office for the son of his friend Peleus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 5.

Their cradles were of\r\nvarious forms, some of which like our own required rocking,[420] while\r\nothers were suspended like sailors’ hammocks from the ceiling, and\r\nswung gently to and fro when they desired to pacify the child or lull\r\nit to sleep:[421] as Tithonos is represented in the mythology to have\r\nbeen suspended in his old age.[422] Other cradles there were in the\r\nshape of little portable baskets wherein they were carried from one\r\npart of the harem to another.[423] It is probable, too, that as in the\r\nEast the children of the opulent were rocked in their cradles wrapped\r\nin coverlets of Milesian wool.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  See in Winkelmann, vignette to l. iv. ch. 3. a view of an ancient\r\n  nursery, where the mother, the pædagogue, the nurse, &c. are engaged\r\n  in the work of education, t. i. p. 414.

They had further a superstition that by\r\nrubbing fresh figs upon the eyes of children they would be preserved\r\nfrom ophthalmia.[426]\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  It was even then remarked that sucking children teethe much better\r\n  than such as are dry nursed.—Aristot. de Gen.

The first verse of a Roman\r\nnursery air, which still, Pignorius[431] tells us, was sung in his\r\ntime by the mothers of Italy, ran thus:—\r\n\r\n                   “Lalla, Lalla; dorme aut lacte.\r\n                   Lalla, Lalla; sleep or suck.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  Ilgen. de Scol.

He observes,[436] too, that children suckled and\r\nbrought up by dumb nurses, will remain themselves dumb, which would\r\nnecessarily happen had they no other person with whom to converse.\r\nWhen the infant was extremely wakeful the soothing influence of the\r\nsong was heightened by the aid of little timbrels and rattles hung\r\nwith bells.\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  Quintil. i. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  Instit.

The nurse, it is to be presumed, felt no inclination to\r\ndispute the passage with him; but Anacreon attracted, perhaps, by her\r\npretty face, making a timely lurch, sent both her and her charge\r\nspinning off the pavement, at the same time muttering something\r\ndisrespectful against “the brat.” Now, for her own part, the girl felt\r\nno resentment against him, for she could see which of the divinities\r\nwas to blame; but loving, as a nurse should, her boy, she prayed that\r\nthe poet might one day utter many words in praise of him whom he had\r\nso rudely vituperated; which came to pass accordingly, for the infant\r\nwas the celebrated Cleobulos, whose beauty the Teïan afterwards\r\ncelebrated in many an ode.[438]\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  See in the Mus. Cortonens. pl. 35. the figure of a nurse bearing the\r\n  infant Bacchos.\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  Max. Tyr. Diss. xi. p. 132.\r\n\r\nTraces of the remotest antiquity still linger in the nursery. The word\r\nbaby, which we bestow familiarly on an infant, was with little\r\nvariation, in use many thousand years ago among the Syrians, in whose\r\nnursery dialect _babia_[439] had the same signification. _Tatta_, too,\r\n_pappa_ and _mamma_[440] were the first words lisped by the children\r\nof Hellas. And from various hints dropped by ancient authors, it seems\r\nclear that the same wild stories and superstitions that still flourish\r\nthere haunted the nursery of old. The child was taught to dread Empusa\r\nor Onoskelis or Onoskolon,[441] the monster with one human foot and\r\none of brass, which dwelt among the shades of night and glided through\r\ndusky chambers and dismal passages to devour “naughty children.” The\r\nfables which filled up this obscure part of Hellenic mythology, were\r\nscarcely less wild than those the Arabs tell about their Marids, their\r\nEfreets, and their Jinn; for Empusa, the phantom minister of\r\nHecate,[442] could assume every various form of God’s creatures,\r\nappearing sometimes as a bull, or a tree, or an ass, or a stone, or a\r\nfly, or a beautiful woman.[443] Shakspeare, having caught, perhaps,\r\nsome glimpse of this superstition, or inventing in a kindred spirit,\r\nattributes a similar power of transformation to his mischievous elf in\r\nthe Midsummer Night’s Dream, located on Empusa’s native soil.\r\n\r\n       “I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about, around,\r\n       Through bog, through bush, through brake, through briar.\r\n       Sometimes a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,\r\n       A hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire,\r\n       And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\r\n       Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire at every turn.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  Phot.

They loved to relate “around the fire\r\no’ nights,” how Lamia had once been a beautiful woman caressed and\r\nmade the mother of a fair son by Zeus; how Hera through jealousy had\r\ndestroyed the boy; and how, thereupon Lamia took to the bush and\r\ndevoted her wretched immortality to the destroying of other women’s\r\nchildren.[447] According to another form of the tradition there were\r\nmany Lamiæ, so called from having capacious jaws, inhabiting the\r\nLibyan coast,[448] somewhere about the Great Syrtis, in the midst of\r\nsand hills, rocks, and wastes of irreclaimable aridity. Formed above\r\nlike women of surpassing beauty, they terminated below in serpents.\r\nTheir voice was like the hissing of an adder, and whatever approached\r\nthem they devoured.[449]\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

The ceremony took place annually during certain festivals,\r\ndenominated Tithenidia,[451] when, in a moment of hospitality, they\r\nnot only made merry themselves, but overlooked their xenelasia, and\r\nentertained generously all such strangers as happened to be present.\r\nThe banquet given on this occasion was called Kopis, and, in\r\npreparation for it, tents were pitched on the banks of the Tiasa near\r\nthe temple of Artemis Corythalis. Within these, beds formed of heaps\r\nof herbs were piled up and covered with carpets. On the day of the\r\nfestival the nurses proceeded thither with the male children in their\r\narms, and, presenting them to the goddess, offered up as victims a\r\nnumber of sucking pigs. In the feast which ensued loaves baked in an\r\noven, in lieu of the extemporary cake, were served up to the guests.\r\nChoruses of Corythalistriæ or dancing girls, likewise performed in\r\nhonour of the goddess; and in some places persons, called Kyrittoi, in\r\nwooden masks, made sport for the guests.[452] Probably it may have\r\nbeen on occasions such as this that the nurses, like her in Romeo and\r\nJuliet, gave free vent to their libertine tongues, and indulged in\r\nthose appellations which the tolerant literature of antiquity has\r\npreserved.[453]\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  Meurs.

Even respecting the recreations\r\nwhich succeeded and amused the leisure of boys our materials for\r\nworking out a picture are scanty, so that we must content ourselves\r\nwith little more than an outline. Nevertheless, though the accounts\r\nthey have transmitted to posterity are meagre, they attached much\r\nimportance to the subject itself; so that the greatest legislators and\r\nphilosophers condescended to make regulations respecting it. Thus\r\nPlato, with a view of generating a profound reverence for ancient\r\nnational institutions, forbade even the recreations of boys to be\r\nvaried with reckless fickleness; for the habit of innovation once\r\nintroduced into the character would ever after continue to influence\r\nit, so that they who in boyhood altered their sports without reason,\r\nwould without scruple in manhood extend their daring hands to the laws\r\nand institutions of their country.[456]\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  Plato had the utmost faith in the power of education over both mind\r\n  and body; but his system embraced much more than is usually\r\n  comprehended under the term, even taking charge of the infant before\r\n  its birth, and immediately afterwards, in the hope of wisely\r\n  regulating its physical developement. As the child grows most during\r\n  the first five years, its size in the following twenty being seldom\r\n  doubled, most care, he thought, should then be taken that the great\r\n  impulses of nature be not counteracted. Much food is then consumed,\r\n  with very little exercise; hence the multitude of deaths in infancy\r\n  and diseases in after-life, of which the seeds are then sown. For\r\n  this reason he would encourage the violent romping and sports of\r\n  children, that the excess of nourishment may be got rid of.

The children themselves, as\r\nwithout any authority might with certainty be inferred, employed their\r\ntime in erecting walls with sand,[460] in constructing little\r\nhouses,[461] in building and carving ships, in cutting carts or\r\nchariots out of leather, in fashioning pomegranate rinds into the\r\nshape of frogs,[462] and in forming with wax a thousand diminutive\r\nimages, which pursued afterwards during school hours subjected them\r\noccasionally to severe chastisement.[463]\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

Numerous women appear to have\r\nearned their livelihood by carrying round from village to village\r\nthese ludicrous and frolicsome images, which were usually about a\r\ncubit in height, and may be regarded as the legitimate ancestors of\r\nPunch and Judy. By touching a single string, concealed from the\r\nspectators, the operator could put her mute performers in action,\r\ncause them to move every limb in succession, spread forth the hands,\r\nshrug the shoulders, turn round the neck, roll the eyes, and appear to\r\nlook at the audience.[465] After this, by other contrivances within\r\nthe images, they could be made to go through many humorous evolutions\r\nresembling the movements of the dance. These exhibitors, frequently of\r\nthe male sex, were known by the name of Neurospastæ. This art passed,\r\ntogether with other Grecian inventions, into Italy, where it was\r\nalready familiar to the public in the days of Horace, who, in speaking\r\nof princes governed by favourites, compares them to puppets in the\r\nhands of the showman.\r\n\r\n          “Tu, mihi qui imperitas, aliis servis miser; atque\r\n          Duceris, ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.”[466]\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Buleng. de Theat. l. i. c. 36. sqq.

Schol.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary puppet, in the form of a silver skeleton, was,\r\naccording to Petronius Arbiter,[467] exhibited at the court of Nero;\r\nfor, like the Egyptians, this imperial profligate appears to have been\r\nexcited to sensual indulgences by the remembrance of the grave: “Let\r\nus eat and drink,” cried he, “for tomorrow we die.” The skeleton being\r\nplaced upon the table, in the midst of the tyrant’s orgies, threw its\r\nlimbs strangely about, and bent its form into various attitudes with\r\nwonderful flexibility, which having performed once and again, and then\r\nsuddenly ceasing to move, the master of the feast exclaimed, “Alas,\r\nalas! what a mere nothing is man! Like unto this must we all be when\r\nOrcus shall have borne us hence. Therefore let us live while enjoyment\r\nis in our power.” But to return to the children of Hellas. Among the\r\nearliest sports of the Greek boy was whipping the bembyx or top,[468]\r\nwhich would appear to have been usually practised in those open spaces\r\noccurring at the junction of several roads:—\r\n\r\n        “Where three ways meet there boys with tops are found,\r\n        That ply the lash and urge them round and round.”[469]\r\n\r\nSometimes also, as with us, they spun their tops with cord. The\r\namusement is thus described by Tibullus:[470]\r\n\r\n        “Namque agor, ut per plana citus tota verbere turben,\r\n        Quem celer assuetâ versitat arte puer.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Satyric. p. 80.

It was sometimes made of bronze,\r\nabout three feet in diameter,[471] and adorned with little spherical\r\nbells and movable rings, which jingled as it rolled. The instrument\r\nemployed to urge\r\n\r\n                    “the rolling circle’s speed,”\r\n\r\nas Gray expresses it, in his reminiscences of the Eton play-ground,\r\nwas crooked at the point, and called a plectron: its exact\r\nrepresentation may any day, in the proper season, be seen in the\r\nstreets of London impelling forward the iron hoop of our own children.\r\nThe passages of ancient authors, in which mention of the trochos\r\noccurs, appear to have been imperfectly understood before the\r\ndiscovery of a basso-rilievo, in marble, on the road from Rome to\r\nTivoli, afterwards removed to the vineyard of the Cardinal Alexander\r\nAlbani. On certain engraved gems also, in the cabinet of Stosch, are\r\nseveral representations of boys playing at hoop, where the trochos in\r\nsome cases reaches to the waist, in others to the breast, and where\r\nthe child is very small up to the chin. It has been conjectured by\r\nWinkelmann,[472] that a circle represented in one of the paintings of\r\nHerculaneum was no other than an ancient trochos. Rolling the hoop\r\nformed a part of the exercises of the palæstra, which were performed\r\neven by very young children. Thus we find the nurse describing the\r\nsons of Medeia returning from playing at hoop the very day that they\r\nwere slain by their mother.[473] This amusement has been described\r\nbriefly by the Roman poets. Thus Martial:[474]—\r\n\r\n              “Garrulus in laxo cur annulus orbe vagatur\r\n              Cedat, et argutis obvia turba trochis.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Vesp. 1517.

This\r\nspecies of beetle making its appearance when the apple-trees were in\r\nbloom, was therefore called _Melolanthe_, or apple-blossom. Having\r\ncaught it, and tied a linen thread about its feet, it was let loose,\r\nand the fun was to see it move in spiral lines through the air as it\r\nwas twisted by the thread.[479]\r\n\r\nFootnote 475:\r\n\r\n  iii. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  Ars Poet. 380. where the ancient scholiast seems doubtful whether\r\n  the trochus was a hoop or a top:—“Trochus dicitur turben, qui\r\n  flagello percutitur, et in vertiginem rotatur, aut rota quam\r\n  currendo pueri scuticâ vel virgâ regunt.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 477:\r\n\r\n  Carm. iii. 24. 56. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 478:\r\n\r\n  On the games at present practised in Greece, see Dodwell, ii. 37.\r\n  sqq.; and Douglas, Essay on certain points of resemblance between\r\n  the Anc. and Mod. Greeks, p. 127. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 124.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice among the children of Greece, when the sun\r\nhappened to be obscured by a cloud, to exclaim, “Ἔξεχ᾽ ὦ φίλ᾽\r\nἥλιε!”—“Come forth, beloved sun!” Strattis makes allusion to this\r\ncustom in a fragment of his Phœnissæ:—\r\n\r\n        “Then the god listened to the shouting boys,\r\n        When they exclaimed, ‘Come forth, beloved sun!’”[480]\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that our English boys have no such passion for\r\nsunshine; otherwise, as Phœbos Apollo hides his face for months\r\ntogether in this blessed climate, we should be in a worse plight than\r\nDionysos among the frogs of Acheron, when his passion for Euripides\r\nled him to pay a visit to Persephone. In some parts of the country,\r\nhowever, the children have a rude distich which they frequently bawl\r\nin chorus, when in summer-time their sports are interrupted by a\r\nlong-continued shower:—\r\n\r\n                      “Rain, rain, go to Spain;\r\n                      Fair weather, come again.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 480:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 123.\r\n\r\nThe Muïnda was our “Blindman’s-buff,” “Blind Hob,” “Hobble ’em-blind,”\r\nand “Hood-man-blind,” in which, as with us, a boy moved about with his\r\neyes bandaged, spreading forth his hands, and crying “Beware!” If he\r\ncaught any of those who were skipping around him, the captive was\r\ncompelled to enact the blind-man in his stead. Another form of the\r\ngame was for the seers to hide, and the blind man to grope round till\r\nhe found them; the whole probably being a rude representation of\r\nPolyphemos in his cave searching for the Greeks who had blinded him. A\r\nthird form was, for the bystanders to strike or touch the blindfolded\r\nboy until he could declare who had touched him, when the person\r\nindicated took his place. To this the Roman soldiers alluded when they\r\nblindfolded our Saviour and smote him, and cried, “Prophesy who struck\r\nthee.”[481] In the Kollabismos,[482] the Capifolèt of the French, one\r\nperson covered his eyes with his own hands, the other then gave him a\r\ngentle blow, and the point was, for the blindfolded man to guess with\r\nwhich hand he had been stricken. The Χαλκὴ Μυῖα,[483] or Brazen Fly,\r\nwas a variety of Blindman’s-buff, in which a boy, having his eyes\r\nbound with a fillet, went groping round, calling out, “I am seeking\r\nthe Brazen Fly.” His companions replied, “You may seek, but you will\r\nnot find it”—at the same time striking him with cords made of the\r\ninner bark of the papyros; and thus they proceeded till one of them\r\nwas taken. Apodidraskinda (“hide and seek,” or “whoop and holloa!”)\r\nwas played much as it is now. One boy shut his eyes, or they were kept\r\nclosed for him by one of his suspicious companions, while the others\r\nwent to hide. He then sallied forth in search of the party who lay\r\nconcealed, while each of them endeavoured to gain the post of the\r\nseeker; and the first who did this turned him out and took his place.\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  This has been observed by Hemsterhuis, ad Poll. t. vi. p. 1173,\r\n  where his commentary alone can render the text intelligible.—Cf.\r\n  Matthew, xxvi. 68.

Nerdilud. p. 266.\r\n\r\nAnother game was the Ephedrismos, in which a stone called the Dioros\r\nwas set up at a certain distance, and aimed at with bowls or stones.\r\nThe one who missed took the successful player upon his back, and was\r\ncompelled to carry him about blindfolded, until he went straight from\r\nthe standing-point to the Dioros. This latter part of the game has\r\nbeen described by several ancient authors, under the appellation of\r\nEncotyle, though they are rightly, by Hesychius,[484] considered as\r\ndifferent parts of the same sport. The variety called Encotyle,—the\r\n“Pick-back” or “Pick-a-back,” of English boys, consisted in one lad’s\r\nplacing his hands behind his back, and receiving therein the knees of\r\nhis conqueror, who, putting his fingers over the bearer’s eyes, drove\r\nhim about at his pleasure. This game was also called the Kubesinda and\r\nHippas,[485] though, according to the conjecture of Dr. Hyde, the\r\nlatter name signified rather our game of “Leap-frog,”—the “mazidha” of\r\nthe Persians, in which a number of boys stooped down with the hands\r\nresting on the knees, in a row, the last going over the backs of all\r\nthe others, and then standing first.\r\n\r\nFootnote 484:\r\n\r\n  In v. Ἐφεδρίζειν.\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  Hyde, Hist. Nerdilud. p. 241.\r\n\r\nIn the game called Chytrinda, in English[486] “Hot-cockles,” “Selling\r\nof pears,” or “How many plumbs for a penny,” one boy sat on the\r\nground, and was called the chytra or pot, while his companions,\r\nforming themselves into a ring, ran round, plucking, pinching, or\r\nstriking him as they went. If he who enacted the chytra succeeded in\r\nseizing upon one of the buffeters the captive took his place. Possibly\r\nit was during this play that a mischievous foundling, contrary to\r\nrule, poking, as he ran round, the boy in the centre with his foot,\r\nprovoked from the latter the sarcastic inquiry, “What! dost thou kick\r\nthy mother in the belly?” alluding to the circumstance of the former\r\nhaving been exposed in a chytra.[487] Another form of the Chytrinda\r\nrequired the lad in the centre to move about with a pot on his head,\r\nwhere he held it with his left hand, while the others struck him, and\r\ncried out, “Who has the pot?” To which he replied, “I Midas,”\r\nendeavouring all the while to reach some one with his foot,—the first\r\nwhom he thus touched being compelled to carry round the pot in his\r\nstead.[488]\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  Hyde, Hist. Nerdilud. p. 263.\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Thesm. 509. But see above, p. 122.\r\n\r\nFootnote 488:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 114.\r\n\r\nAnother game, peculiar to girls, was the Cheli Chelone, or “the\r\ntortoise,” of which I remember no representative among English\r\npastimes. It somewhat resembled the Chytrinda of the boys. For one\r\ngirl sat on the ground and was called the tortoise, while her\r\ncompanions, running round, inquired “Tor-tortoise what art thou doing\r\nthere in the middle?” “Spinning wool,” replied she, “the thread of the\r\nMilesian woof;” “And how, continued they, was thy son engaged when he\r\nperished?” “He sprang from his white steeds into the sea.”[489] If\r\nthis was, as the language would intimate, a Dorian play, I should\r\nconsider it a practical satire on the habits of the other Hellenic\r\nwomen, who remained like tortoises at home, carding and spinning,\r\nwhile their sons engaged in the exercises of the palæstra or the\r\nstadium. Possibly, also, originally the name may have had some\r\nconnection with καλλιχέλωνος “beautiful tortoise,” the figure of this\r\nanimal having been impressed on the money of the Peloponnesians; in\r\nfact, in a fragment of the Helots of Eupolis, we find the obolos\r\ndistinguished by the epithet of καλλιχέλωνος.[490]\r\n\r\nFootnote 489:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 125.\r\n\r\nFootnote 490:\r\n\r\n  Id. ix. 74.

Græc. p. 41.\r\n\r\nThe Kynitinda was so called from the verb κυνέω to kiss, as appears\r\nfrom Crates in his “Games,” a play in which the poet contrived to\r\nintroduce an account of this and nearly all the other juvenile\r\npastimes. The form of the sport being little known, the learned have\r\nsometimes confounded it with a kind of salute called the chytra in\r\nantiquity, and the “Florentine Kiss” in modern Italy, in which the\r\nperson kissing took the other by the ears. Giraldi[491] says he\r\nremembers, when a boy, that his father and other friends, when kissing\r\nhim, used sometimes to take hold of both his ears, which they called\r\ngiving a “Florentine kiss.” He afterwards was surprised to find that\r\nthis was a most ancient practice, commemorated both by the Greek and\r\nLatin authors. It obtained its name, as he conjectures, from the\r\nearthen vessel called chytra, which had two handles usually laid hold\r\nof by persons drinking out of it, as is still the practice with\r\nsimilar utensils in Spain. This writer mentions a present sent from\r\nthe peninsula to Leo X, consisting of a great number of chytræ of red\r\npottery, if we may so call them, of which he himself obtained one.\r\nCrates, as Hemsterhuis[492] ingeniously supposes, introduced a wanton\r\nwoman playing at this game among the youths in order that she might\r\nenjoy the kisses of the handsome.\r\n\r\nFootnote 491:\r\n\r\n  Opp. ii. p. 880.

Standing on the\r\nshore of the sea at the Peiræeus, for example, they flung the shells\r\nedgeways over the water so that they should strike it and bound\r\nupwards again and again from its surface. The boy whose shell made\r\nmost leaps before sinking, won the game. Minucius Felix gives a very\r\npretty description of this juvenile sport. “Behold, he says, boys\r\nplaying in frolicsome rivalry with shells on the sea-shore. The game\r\nconsists in picking up from the beach a shell rendered light by the\r\nconstant action of the waves, and standing on an even place, and\r\ninclining the body, holding the shell flat between the fingers, and\r\nthrowing it with the greatest possible force, so that it may rase the\r\nsurface of the sea or skim along while it moves with gentle flow, or\r\nglances over the tops of the waves as they leap up in its track. That\r\nboy is esteemed the victor whose shell performs the longest journey or\r\nmakes most leaps before sinking.”[494]\r\n\r\nFootnote 493:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 494:\r\n\r\n  Seber ad Poll. t. vi. p. 1188.\r\n\r\nThe Akinetinda was a contention between boys, in which some one of\r\nthem endeavoured to maintain his position unmoved. Good sport must\r\nhave been produced by the next game called Schœnophilinda, or “Hiding\r\nthe Rope.” In this a number of boys sat down in a circle, one of whom\r\nhad a rope concealed about his person, which he endeavoured to drop\r\nsecretly beside one of his companions. If he succeeded, the unlucky\r\nwight was started like a hare round the circle, his enemy following\r\nand laying about his shoulders. But on the other hand, if he against\r\nwhom the plot was laid detected it, he obtained possession of the rope\r\nand enjoyed the satisfaction of flogging the plotter over the same\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Basilinda[495] was a game in which one obtained by lot the rank of\r\nking, and the vanquished, whether one or many, became subject to him,\r\nto do whatever he should order. It passed down to the Christians, and\r\nwas more especially practised during the feast of the Epiphany. It is\r\ncommonly known under the name of Forfeits, and was formerly called\r\n“One penny,” “One penny come after me,” “Questions and commands,” “The\r\nchoosing of king and queen on Twelfth night.” In the last-mentioned\r\nsense it is still prevalent in France, where it is customary for\r\nbakers to make a present to the families they serve, of a large cake\r\nin the form of a ring in which a small kidney bean has been concealed.\r\nThe cake is cut up, the pieces are distributed to the company, and the\r\nperson who gets the bean is king of the feast. This game entered in\r\nGreece likewise into the amusements of grown people, both men and\r\nwomen, as well as of children, and an anecdote, connected with it, is\r\ntold of Phryne, who happened one day to be at a mixed party where it\r\nwas played. By chance it fell to her lot to play the queen; upon\r\nwhich, observing that her female companions were rouged and lilied to\r\nthe eyes, she maliciously ordered a basin and towel to be brought in,\r\nand that every woman should wash her face. Conscious of her own native\r\nbeauty, she began the operation, and only appeared the fresher and\r\nmore lovely. But alas for the others! When the anchusa, psimmuthion,\r\nand phukos had been removed by the water, their freckled and coarse\r\nskins exposed them to general laughter.[496]\r\n\r\nFootnote 495:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 110.\r\n\r\nFootnote 496:\r\n\r\n  Galen.

A knot of boys having drawn\r\na line on the ground, separated into two parties. A small earthenware\r\ndisk or ostrakon, one side black with pitch, the other white, was then\r\nproduced, and each party chose a side, white or black. The disk was\r\nthen pitched along the line, and the party whose side came up was\r\naccounted victorious, and prepared to pursue while the others turned\r\nround and fled. The boy first caught obtained the name of the ass, and\r\nwas compelled to sit down, the game apparently proceeding till all\r\nwere thus caught and placed hors de combat. He who threw the ostrakon\r\ncried, “night or day,” the black side being termed _night_, and the\r\nopposite _day_. It was called the “Twirling of the ostrakon.” Plato\r\nalludes to it in the Phædros.[497]\r\n\r\nFootnote 497:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 111. seq. Plat. Phæd. t. i. p. 29. seq. Bekk.\r\n\r\nThe Dielkustinda, “French and English,” was played chiefly in the\r\npalæstra, and occasionally elsewhere. It consisted simply in two\r\nparties of boys laying hold of each other by the hand, and pulling\r\ntill one by one the stronger had drawn over the weaker to their side\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Phryginda was a game in which, holding a number of smooth and\r\ndelicate fragments of pottery between the fingers of the left hand,\r\nthey struck them in succession with the right so as apparently to\r\nproduce a kind of music.[498]\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  Turneb. Advers. xxvii. 33. Poll. ix. 114. Comment. t. vi. p. 1178.\r\n\r\nThere was another game called Kyndalismos, played with short batons,\r\nand requiring considerable strength and quickness of eye. A stick\r\nhaving been fixed up-right in a loose moist soil, the business was to\r\ndislodge it by throwing at it other batons from a distance; whence the\r\nproverb, “Nail is driven out by nail, and baton by baton.”[499] A\r\nperson who played at this game was called by some of the Doric poets\r\nKyndalopactes.[500] A similar game is played in England, in which the\r\nprize is placed upon the top of the upright stick. The player wins\r\nwhen the prize falls without the hole whence the upright has been\r\ndislodged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 499:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Vatic. Append. Proverb. Cent. ii. prov. 12. et Ib. not.

The first and\r\nmost simple form consisted in hopping on one foot, sometimes in pairs,\r\nto see which in this way could go furthest. On other occasions the\r\nhopper undertook to overtake certain of his companions who were\r\nallowed the use of both legs. If he could touch one of them he came\r\noff conqueror. This variety of the game appears to have been the\r\nEmpusæ ludus of the Romans. “Scotch hoppers,” or “Fox to thy hole,” in\r\nwhich boys, hopping on one leg, beat one another with gloves or pieces\r\nof leather tied at the end of strings, or knotted handkerchiefs, as in\r\nthe _diable boîteux_ of the French. At other times victory depended on\r\nthe number of hops, all hopping together and counting their\r\nsprings,—the highest of course winning. But the most amusing variety\r\nof the game was that practised during the Dionysiac festival of the\r\nAskolia. Skins filled with wine or inflated with air, and extremely\r\nwell oiled, were placed upon the ground, and on these the shoeless\r\nrustics leaped with one leg and endeavoured to maintain a footing,\r\nwhich they seldom could on account of their slipperiness. However, he\r\nwho succeeded carried off the skin of wine as his prize.\r\n\r\nFootnote 501:\r\n\r\n  Phurnutus, De Nat. Deorum, c. 30. p. 217. seq. Gale.—Poll. ix. 121.\r\n  Sch. Aristoph.

The fun was\r\nto see the ludicrous figure he cut with his face daubed and\r\ndiscoloured by the lees.\r\n\r\nPhitta Maliades, Phitta Meliai, Phitta Rhoiai, “Hasten, nymphs!” may\r\nbe regarded as exclamations of encouragement uttered by Dorian girls,\r\nwhen engaged in a race.[502]\r\n\r\nFootnote 502:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 127. with the note of Hemsterhuis.\r\n\r\nPlaying at ball was common, and received various names. Episkyros,\r\nPhæninda, Aporraxis and Ourania. The first of these games was also\r\nknown by the names of the Ephebike and the Epikoinos. It was played\r\nthus: a number of young men assembling together in a place covered\r\nwith sand or dust, drew across it a straight line, which they called\r\nSkyros, and at equal distances, on either side, another line. Then\r\nplacing the ball on the Skyros, they divided into two equal parties,\r\nand retreated each to their lines, from which they immediately\r\nafterwards rushed forward to seize the ball. The person who picked it\r\nup, then cast it towards the extreme line of the opposite party, whose\r\nbusiness it was to intercept and throw it back, and they won who by\r\nforce or cunning compelled their opponents to overstep the boundary\r\nline.\r\n\r\nDaniel Souter[503] contends that this was the English game of\r\nfootball, into which perhaps it may, in course of time, have been\r\nconverted. This rough and, it must be confessed, somewhat dangerous\r\nsport, originally, in all probability, introduced into this country by\r\nthe Romans, may still on Shrove Tuesday be witnessed in certain towns\r\nof South Wales. The balls consist of bulls’ bladders protected by a\r\nthick covering of leather, and blown tight. Six or eight are made\r\nready for the occasion, every window in the town is shut by break of\r\nday, at which time all the youths of the neighbourhood assemble in the\r\nstreets. The ball is then thrown up in front of the town-hall, and the\r\nmultitude, dividing into two parts, strive with incredible eagerness\r\nand enthusiasm to overcome their antagonists, each endeavouring to\r\nkick the foot-ball to the other extremity of the town. In the struggle\r\nsevere kicks and wounds are given, and many fierce battles take place.\r\nThe ball sometimes mounts thirty or forty feet above the tops of the\r\nhighest houses and falls far beyond, or goes right over into the\r\ngardens, whither it is immediately followed by a crowd of young men.\r\nThe sport is kept up all day, the hungry combatants recruiting their\r\nstrength from time to time by copious horns of ale, and an abundant\r\nsupply of the nice pancakes which the women sell in baskets at the\r\ncorner of every street. To view this sport, thousands of persons\r\nassemble from all the country round, so that to the secluded\r\npopulation of those districts it is in some sort what the battle in\r\nthe Platanistas was to the Spartans, or even what the Isthmian and\r\nNemean games were to the whole of Greece.\r\n\r\nFootnote 503:\r\n\r\n  Palamedes, iii. 4. p. 207. Alex. ab Alex. iii. 21.\r\n\r\nThe Phæninda[504] is supposed to have received its name either from\r\nits inventor, Phænides (called Phænestios in Athenæus[505] and the\r\nEtymologicon Magnum), or from the verb Φενακίζειν[506] “to deceive,”\r\nbecause, making as though they would throw at one person, they\r\nimmediately sent it at another, thus deluding the expectation of the\r\nformer. It appears at first to have been played with the small ball\r\ncalled Harpaston, though the game with the large soft one may\r\nafterwards perhaps have also been called Phæninda. The variety named\r\nAporraxis consisted in throwing the ball with some force against the\r\nground and repelling it constantly as it rebounded; he who did this\r\nmost frequently, winning. In the game called Ourania, the player,\r\nbending back his body, flung up the ball with all his might into the\r\nair; on which there arose a contention among his companions who should\r\nfirst catch it in its descent, as Homer appears to intimate in his\r\ndescription of the Phæacian sport. They likewise played at ball in the\r\nmodern fashion against a wall, in which the person who kept it up\r\nlongest, won, and was called king; the one who lost, obtained the name\r\nof ass, and was constrained by the laws of the game to perform any\r\ntask set him by the king.[507]\r\n\r\nFootnote 504:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Souter. Palam. iii. 3. p. 201.\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. i. 26.\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Schweigh. ad Athen. t. vi. p. 248. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 106.\r\n\r\nA game generally played in the gymnasia was the Skaperda. In this a\r\npost was set up with a hole near the top and a rope passed through it.\r\nTwo young men then seized each one end of the rope, and turning their\r\nback to the post exerted their utmost strength to draw their\r\nantagonist up the beam. He who raised his opponent highest won.\r\nSometimes they tried their strength by binding themselves together,\r\nback to back, and pulling different ways.\r\n\r\nThe Himanteligmos, “pricking the garter,” in Ireland “pricking the\r\nloop,” was really an ingenious amusement. It consisted in doubling a\r\nthong, and twisting it into numerous labyrinthine folds, which done,\r\nthe other party put the end of a peg into the midst in search of the\r\npoint of duplication. If he missed the mark the thong unwound without\r\nentangling the peg; but if he dropped it into the right ring his peg\r\nwas caught and the game won. Hemsterhuis[508] supposes the Gordian\r\nknot to have been nothing but a variety of the Himanteligmos. He\r\nconjectures that the boys of Abdera were fond of this game, on which\r\naccount the sophisms of Democritus were called ἱμαντελικτεαὶ, and\r\nhence probably a sophist, as one who twists words together, to _lash_\r\nothers, was called Himantelicteus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  Ad Poll. t. vi. p. 1186. sqq. Cf. Plut. Symp. i. 1.\r\n\r\nAnother game, not entirely confined to children, was the Chalkismos,\r\nwhich consisted in twisting round rapidly on a board or table a piece\r\nof money, and placing the point of the finger so dexterously on its\r\nupper edge as to put a stop to its motion without permitting it to\r\nfall. This was a favourite amusement of Phryne the hetaira, as\r\nbuilding houses of cards was of La Belle Stuart.[509] Some of these\r\nsports were peculiar to the female sex,[510] as the Pentalitha, which\r\nis still played by girls in some remote provinces of our island, where\r\nit is called “Dandies.” The whole apparatus of the game consisted in\r\nfive astragals—knuckle bones—pebbles, or little balls, which, gathered\r\nup rapidly, were thrown into the air and attempted to be caught in\r\nfalling on the back of the hand or between the slightly spread\r\nfingers. If any fell it was allowable to pick them up, provided this\r\nwere done with the fingers of the same hand on which the other\r\nastragals rested.[511] The girls of France, according to Bulenger,\r\nstill amuse themselves with the Pentalitha, there played with five\r\nlittle glass balls, which are flung in the air and caught so\r\ndexterously as seldom to fall either on the table or on the ground. I\r\nhave never, however, seen it played myself in that country.\r\n\r\nFootnote 509:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 118.\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  The game of astragals, properly so called, was common to both sexes\r\n  (Paus. vi. 24. 7), who saw in Elis one of the Graces, represented\r\n  with an astragal in her hand, while her two companions held the one\r\n  a rose, the other a branch of myrtle, symbolical of their\r\n  relationship to Aphrodite. The poets sometimes transfer these sports\r\n  of earth to the Olympian halls, where we find Eros and Ganymede\r\n  playing with golden astragals—Cf. Apollon. Rhod. iii. 117. seq. Cf.\r\n  Odyss. α. 107. Il. χ. 87. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  Poll. ix. 126.\r\n\r\nThe Astragalismos,[512] which by the Romans was denominated talorum or\r\ntaxillorum ludus, (by Hyde through the Greek πάσσαλος, derived from\r\nthe Hebræo-Punic Assila,) by the Arabs Ka’b or Shezn, by the Persians\r\nShesh-buzhûl bâzi, by the Turks Depshelìm, (played in their country\r\nboth by girls and boys,) by the French Garignon or Osselets, in\r\nEnglish “Cockall.”[513] In the game of astragals the Persians, as is\r\nimplied in the name given above, often use six bones while the Greeks\r\nemployed only four, which were thrown either on a table or on the\r\nfloor. According to Lucian,[514] the huckle bones were sometimes those\r\nof the African gazelle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 512:\r\n\r\n  Children, according to Lysander, were to be deceived with astragals,\r\n  and men with oaths.—Plut.

Trans. vol. 50. pt. i. p. 88. Hyde. Hist. Talor. p. 137.\r\n\r\nThe several sides of the astragal or huckle bone had their character\r\nexpressed by numbers, and obtained separate names, which determined\r\nthe value of the throw.[515] Thus, the side showing the Monas was\r\ncalled the Dog, the opposite side Chias, and the throw Chios. In\r\ncockall as in dice there are neither twos nor fives. The highest\r\nnumber, six, was called the Coan (συνορικὸς or ἑξίτης); the Dog or one\r\nwas called the Chian or dog-chance; to which the old proverb alluded\r\nΚῶος πρὸς χῖον, six to one. To have the Dog turn up was to lose,\r\nhence, perhaps, the phrase, “going to the dogs,” that is, playing a\r\nlosing game. The throw of eight was denominated Stesichoros, because\r\nthe poet’s tomb at Himera consisted of a perfect octagon. Among the\r\nforty who succeeded to the thirty at Athens Euripides was one, and\r\nhence, if the throw of the astragals amounted to forty points, they\r\nbestowed upon it the name of Euripides. All animals in which the\r\nastragal is found have it in the hough or pastern of the hind legs.\r\nThe τὸ πρανὲς, the gibbous side or blank, because it counts for\r\nnothing; the τὸ κοῖλον, the hollow side or “put in;” the χῶα, the\r\ntortuous side, \"cockall,\" or “take all,” so called because it wins the\r\nstake; the smooth side τα χῖα, “take half,” because of the money put\r\nin, it wins half. Among the Greeks and Romans the _put in_ was called\r\ntrias, the blank tetras, the half-monas, and the cockall hexas.[516]\r\nBy the Arabs they are denominated the thief, the lamb, the wezeer, and\r\nthe sultan; by the Turks the robber, the ploughman, the kihaya, or the\r\ndog, and the bey; by the Persians the robber, the rustic, the wezeer,\r\nand the schah; by the Armenians the thief, the ploughman, the steward,\r\nand the lord. The number of casts among the Greeks, according to\r\nEustathius, amounted to thirty-five.[517] Pliny[518] speaks of a work\r\nof Polycletos representing naked boys playing at this game, and the\r\nreader will probably remember the mutilated group in the British\r\nMuseum, in which a boy having evidently been beaten at astragals, is\r\nbiting in revenge the leg of his conqueror.\r\n\r\nFootnote 515:\r\n\r\n  Hyde.

There was a kind of divination by\r\nastragals, the bones being hidden under the hand, and the one party\r\nguessing whether they were odd or even. The same game was occasionally\r\nplayed with beans, walnuts, or almonds, or even with money, if we may\r\ncredit Aristophanes, who describes certain serving-men playing at Odd\r\nor Even with golden staters.[520] There was a game called Eis\r\nOmillan,[521] in which they drew a circle on the ground, and, standing\r\nat a little distance, pitched the astragals at it; to win consisting\r\nin making them remain within the ring. Another form of the Eis Omillan\r\nwas to place a trained quail within a circle, on a table for example,\r\nout of which the point was to drive it by tapping it with the middle\r\nfinger. If it reared at the blow, and retreated beyond the line, its\r\nmaster lost his wager. The play called Tropa[522] was also generally\r\nperformed with astragals, which were pitched into a small hole, formed\r\nto receive such things when skilfully thrown. The common acorn, and\r\nfruit of the holm oak, were often substituted for astragals in this\r\ngame. The Ephentinda seems to have consisted in pitching an ostrakon\r\ninto a circle, so as to cause it to remain there. The Skeptinda\r\nconsisted in placing an ostrakon, or a piece of money, on the ground,\r\nand pitching another at it so as to make it turn.[523]\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  Hyde, Hist.

From the very day of his\r\nbirth man begins to be acted on by those causes that furnish his mind\r\nwith ideas. As his intelligence acquires strength, the five sluices\r\nwhich let in all that flood of knowledge which afterwards overflows\r\nhis mind, appear to be enlarged, and education at first, and for some\r\ntime, consists in watching over the nature and quality of the ideas\r\nconveyed inward by those channels. It is difficult to say when actual\r\ninstruction commenced: but among the earliest formal attempts at\r\nimpressing traditionary knowledge on the infant mind was the\r\nrepetition by mothers and nurses of fables and stories, not always, if\r\nPlato may be credited, constructed with a religious or ethical\r\npurpose.[525] They, in fact, introduced into the minds of their\r\nchildren the legends of the mythology, under the forms of which truths\r\nof the greatest importance, such as Bacon has developed in his “Wisdom\r\nof the Ancients,” lay sometimes concealed, though more frequently,\r\nperhaps, they inculcated no useful lesson, but were the mere sportive\r\ncreations of fancy, or if they contained any moral kernel the shell in\r\nwhich it was cased was too hard for the teeth of the vulgar. Such, for\r\nexample, as the legend of Zeus in Hesiod mutilating his father Kronos,\r\nwhich, in Plato’s opinion, was not to be delivered to the empty-headed\r\nmultitude or to untaught children; but, having sacrificed, not a hog,\r\nbut the most precious victim, in mysterious secrecy to a few.\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  Among the ancient writers on education, of which the greater number\r\n  have perished, was Clearchos of Soli, on whom see Voss. de Hist.\r\n  Græc. i.

Cramer, 8, 9.\r\n\r\nWholly different from these, however, were the fables[526] properly so\r\ncalled, which, invented apparently by Hesiod,[527] (at least his Hawk\r\nand Nightingale is the oldest example extant in Hellenic literature,)\r\nwere afterwards sprinkled by the greatest poets, through their\r\nwritings, or spontaneously uttered in pressing emergencies to warn\r\ntheir countrymen against the approaches of tyranny. Archilochos’ Eagle\r\nand Fox[528] was famous throughout antiquity, as was likewise the\r\nHorse and the Stag, related by Stesichoros[529] to the people of\r\nHimera, to put them on their guard against the Machiavellian policy of\r\nGelon. But the most complete, perhaps, of these ancient compositions\r\nis the fable of the lion, delivered by Eumenes to the Macedonian\r\ngenerals under his order, when they had been tampered with by\r\nAntigonos, who would have persuaded them to disband.[530]\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The old man replied that he was quite ready to bestow\r\non him his daughter upon one condition, namely, that he should pluck\r\nout his teeth and his claws, for that he feared his majesty might upon\r\nthe wedding night forget himself and unwittingly destroy the bride. To\r\nthese terms the lion consented, and allowed his teeth and claws to be\r\npulled out, upon which the father seeing he had lost the only things\r\nwhich rendered him terrible fell upon him with a club and beat him to\r\ndeath.” The Æsopic fables[531] which Socrates a few days before his\r\ndeath amused himself by turning into verse,[532] are known to us\r\nsolely by comparatively modern imitations, and of those which were\r\ndenominated Sybaritic we know nothing[533] beyond the name; for though\r\none scholiast informs us that the Sybaritic fables brought men upon\r\nthe scene, as the Æsopic did animals, another states the direct\r\ncontrary. In the earlier and ruder ages of Greece, however, these\r\ncompositions were in great repute, as they are still among the people\r\nof the East. To the infancy of nations as of individuals the wisdom\r\nthey contain is, in fact, always palatable; for which reason they were\r\nhighly esteemed by Martin Luther as particularly adapted to the spirit\r\nof his times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 531:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

On this point we must reject the testimony of Plato’s\r\nacademic dream. The historic fields of Marathon, Platæa, Thermopylæ,\r\nand a thousand others confute his fanciful theorising, proving\r\nincontestably that the love of glory and independence could, in the\r\nvery polities which lie least esteemed, achieve triumphs unknown to\r\nthe subjects of other governments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 533:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

For the school-boys of Greece tasted very little\r\nof the sweets of bed after dawn. “They rose with the light,” says\r\nLucian, “and with pure water washed away the remains of sleep, which\r\nstill lingered on their eyelids.”[537] Having breakfasted on bread and\r\nfruit, to which through the allurements of their pædagogues they\r\nsometimes added wine,[538] they sallied forth to the didaskaleion, or\r\nschoolmaster’s lair as the comic poets jocularly termed it,[539]\r\nsummer and winter, whether the morning smelt of balm, or was deformed\r\nby sleet or snow, drifting like meal from a sieve down the rocks of\r\nthe Acropolis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  De Legg. vi. t. viii. p. 41.

In order ranged,\r\n          The boys from all the neighbourhood appeared,\r\n          Marching to school, naked, though down the sky\r\n          Tumbled the flaky snow like flour from sieve.\r\n          Arrived, and seated wide apart, the master\r\n          First taught them how to chaunt Athena’s praise,\r\n          ‘Pallas unconquered, stormer of cities!’ or\r\n          ‘Shout far resounding’ in the self-same notes\r\n          Their fathers learned.

On this account, Aristotle enumerating Archytas’ rattle among\r\nthe principal toys of children, denominates education the rattle of\r\nboys.[543] In order, too, that its effect might be the more sure and\r\npermanent, no holidays[544], or vacations appear to have been allowed,\r\nwhile irregularity or lateness of attendance was severely\r\npunished.[545] The theories broached by Montagne, Locke, and others,\r\nthat boys are to be kept in order by reason and persuasion were not\r\nanticipated by the Athenians.[546] They believed that to reduce the\r\nstubborn will to obedience, and enforce the wholesome laws of\r\ndiscipline, masters must be armed with the power of correction, and\r\naccordingly their teachers and gymnasiarchs checked with stripes[547]\r\nthe slightest exhibition of stubbornness or indocility.[548]\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  Polit. viii. 6. 268.

Rhet. v. 6. p. 471. seq.\r\n\r\nNor did their pædagogues[549] or governors behave towards them with\r\nless strictness. These were persons,—slaves for the most part,—who at\r\nAthens as in the rest of Greece, Sparta not excepted, were from the\r\nearliest ages intrusted with the care of boys, and whose ministry\r\ncould on no account be dispensed with. By Plato[550] even these\r\nprecautions were deemed insufficient. In his ideal state he would have\r\nthe pædagogues themselves, as at Sparta, under the strictest\r\ninspection, making it the duty of every citizen to have an eye upon\r\nthem, and arming him with the power to correct their delinquencies as\r\nwell as those of the boys under their charge. There was to be,\r\nmoreover, a general inspector intrusted with authority to punish\r\nneglect, by whichsoever of the parties committed. Upon these points\r\nthe views of the Athenians were unquestionably judicious, for since\r\nboys did not amongst them pass at once from the hands of their mothers\r\nand domestic guardianship into those of the state as at Sparta, such\r\ngovernors were necessary to preserve their manners from defilement and\r\ncontamination.[551] Their principal duty consisted in leading the lad\r\nto and from school, in attending him to the theatre, to the public\r\ngames, to the forum, and wherever else it was thought fit he should\r\ngo.[552] It has been by some conjectured that while the boys continued\r\nunder the care of the schoolmaster the governors remained in the\r\nhouse, or in a building adjoining denominated the pædagogeion, to\r\nawait their return; but the inference, drawn chiefly from the name of\r\nthe edifice, is erroneous; pædagogeion was employed to signify the\r\nschool itself,[553] and we have the testimony of Plato to prove that\r\nthe pædagogue having delivered the boy to the didaskalos, usually\r\nreturned to his master’s house.\r\n\r\nFootnote 549:\r\n\r\n  On these and the other persons engaged in the education of youth,\r\n  see Bergmann, ad Isoc.

Lysis. t. i. p. 145.\r\n\r\nOn the character of these governors[554] antiquity appears to have\r\ntransmitted us more satire than information. If we may credit some\r\nwriters, it was not merely slaves who were intrusted with the care of\r\nboys, but often the meanest and vilest of slaves,—base in mind,\r\ndepraved in manners,—whose guardianship, when they chanced to be\r\ncrabbed and morose, could be no other than disgusting to their\r\ncharges; and, when inclined to indulgence, most pernicious. Nay, were\r\nthey themselves corrupt, what could be of more evil tendency than\r\ntheir own example? They who take this view of the matter appear to me\r\nillogical and inconsistent.[555] Though aware that these men were\r\nchosen by the parents to preserve their children from bad example,\r\nfrom the infection of corrupt manners, from the allurements of vicious\r\ncompanions, these writers persuade themselves that they voluntarily\r\ngave them as companions and guardians men worse than whom could not be\r\nfound. It is more reasonable to conclude that when these pædagogues\r\nproved unworthy of the trust reposed in them they were sufficient\r\nmasters of hypocrisy to conceal their vices at home, and only revealed\r\nthemselves to their young masters gradually as their lessons produced\r\ntheir evil fruits. Thus, it is clear, that the father whom the comic\r\nwriter Plato, in his Fellow Deceiver,[556] introduced reproaching the\r\npædagogue who had corrupted his son, knew nothing of his evil ways\r\nwhen he delivered the lad to his keeping.\r\n\r\n            “The youth, O wretch, whom I intrusted to thee\r\n            Thou hast perverted, teaching him vile habits\r\n            Once stranger to his mind; for now he drinks\r\n            Even in the morning, which was not his wont.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  Plut. de Lib.

Athen. p. 12.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest reason we may suppose, that of all the domestics in\r\nthe family the most staid and sober, the most attached, the most\r\nfaithful, were chosen to fulfil this important duty, such as Plautus\r\ndescribes an honest pædagogue,—\r\n\r\n      Eademque erat hæc disciplina olim, cum tu adolescens eras?\r\n      Nego tibi hoc annis viginti fuisse primis copiæ,\r\n      Digitum longe a pædagogo pedem ut efferres ædibus,\r\n      Ante solem exorientem nisi in palæstram veneras,\r\n      Gymnasii præfecto haud mediocres pœnas penderes.\r\n      Idque ubi obtigerat, hoc etiam ad malum arcessabatur malum\r\n      Et discipulus et magister perhibebantur improbi.\r\n      Ubi cursu, luctando, hasta, disco, pugillatu, pila,\r\n      Saliendo sese exercebant magis, quam, scorto aut saviis:\r\n      Ibi suam ætatem extendebant, non in latebrosis locis.\r\n      Inde de hippodromo et palæstra ubi revenisses domum,\r\n      Cincticulo præcinctus in sella apud magistrum assideres:\r\n      Cum librum legeres.

Bacchid. Act iii. Sc. 3.\r\n\r\nLucian, too, speaking of the attendants of youths in the better times\r\nof the republic, describes them as an honourable company who followed\r\ntheir young masters to the schools, not with combs and looking-glasses\r\nlike the attendants of ladies, but with the venerable instruments of\r\nwisdom in their hands, many-leaved tablets or books recording the\r\nglorious deeds of their ancestors, or if proceeding to the music\r\nmaster bearing, instead of these, the melodious lyre.[558]\r\n\r\nFootnote 558:\r\n\r\n  Amor. §. 44.\r\n\r\nIn fact the fortunes of war often in those days reduced men of virtue\r\nand ability to the condition of slaves, when they would naturally be\r\nchosen as the governors of youth. Thus we find Diogenes the Cynic\r\npurchased by a rich Corinthian, who intrusted to him the education of\r\nhis sons. The account which antiquity has left us of his sale,\r\nreception by his master, and manner of teaching, being extremely\r\nbrief, we shall here give it entire. Hermippos[559] who wrote a small\r\ntreatise called the Sale of Diogenes, observes that when the\r\nphilosopher was exposed in the slave-market and interrogated\r\nrespecting his qualifications, he replied that “He could command men;”\r\nand then addressing himself to the herald, bade him inquire whether\r\nthere was any one present who wanted a master. Being forbidden to sit\r\ndown, he said “This matters nothing, for fish are bought in whatever\r\nway they may lie.” He remarked also, that he wondered that when people\r\nwere buying a pot or a dish they examined it on all sides, whereas\r\nwhen they purchased a man they were contented with simply looking at\r\nhim. Afterwards, when he had become the slave of Xeniades, he informed\r\nhis owner that he expected the same obedience to be paid to him as men\r\nyield to a pilot or a physician.\r\n\r\nFootnote 559:\r\n\r\n  Diog. Laert. Vit. Diog. vi. ii. 4. sqq. with the observation of\r\n  Menage, t. ii. p. 138.\r\n\r\nIt is further related by Eubulos, who likewise wrote a treatise on\r\nthis incident, that Diogenes conducted with the utmost care the\r\neducation of the children under his charge. In addition to the\r\nordinary studies, he taught them to ride, to draw the bow, to use the\r\nsling, and to throw the javelin. In the palæstra, moreover, where,\r\ncontrary to the Athenian practice he remained to watch over the boys,\r\nDiogenes would not permit the master of the Gymnasium to exercise them\r\nafter the manner of the athletæ; but in those parts only of\r\ngymnastics, which had a tendency to animate them and strengthen their\r\nconstitutions. They learned also by heart,[560] under his direction,\r\nnumerous sentences from the poets and historians, as well as from his\r\nown writings. It was his practice likewise very greatly to abridge his\r\nexplanations in order that they might the more easily be committed to\r\nmemory. At home he habituated them to wait on themselves, to be\r\ncontent with frugal fare, and drink water, from which it may be\r\ninferred that others drank wine. He accustomed them to cut their hair\r\nclose, not to be fastidious in dress, and to walk abroad with him\r\nbarefoot and without a chiton, silent and with downcast eyes.[561] He\r\nalso went out with them to hunt. On their part they took great care of\r\nhim, and pleaded his cause with their parents. He therefore grew old\r\nin the family, and they performed for him the rites of sepulture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 560:\r\n\r\n  I may say with Herault de Sechelle “Apprendre _par cœur_; ce mot me\r\n  plait. Il n’y a guère en effet que le cœur, qui retienne bien, et\r\n  qui retienne vîte.”—Voyage à Montbar, &c. p. 77.\r\n\r\nFootnote 561:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Luc. Amor. § 44. Καὶ χλανίδα ταῖς ἐπωμίαις περόναις συῤῥάψας ἀπὸ\r\n  τῆς πατρῴας ἑστίας ἐξέρχεται κάτω κεκυφὼς, καὶ μηδένα τῶν ἀπαντών\r\n  τῶν ἐξ ἐναντίου προσβλέπων. In his exhortation to Demonicos,\r\n  Isocrates has thrown together numerous precepts which almost\r\n  constitute a code of morals and politeness. They are far superior to\r\n  Lord Chesterfield’s even where the Graces only are recommended; and\r\n  have the advantage of almost always subjoining the reason to the\r\n  rule.\r\n\r\nNow what Diogenes was in the house of Xeniades numerous pædagogues\r\nwere doubtless found to be in other parts of Greece. But the majority\r\nit is thought were open to blame; and so they are everywhere, and so\r\nthey would be, though taken from the best classes of mankind. That is,\r\nthey were men with many failings, far from what could be wished; but\r\nthat their character upon the whole was respectable seems to me\r\ndemonstrated by the powers delegated to them by the parents. For not\r\nonly could they use upon occasion, as we have said, menace and harsh\r\nlanguage,—they were even permitted to have recourse to blows, in order\r\nto preserve their pupils from vices which none would have sooner\r\ntaught than they, had their characters been such as is commonly\r\nbelieved. For example, would they have made a drunkard the guardian of\r\na boy’s sobriety? a thief the guardian of his honesty? a libertine of\r\nhis chastity? a coarse and ribald jester the inculcator of modesty and\r\npurity of language?[562]\r\n\r\nFootnote 562:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Dion. Chrysost. ii. p. 261; i. 299.\r\n\r\nAt home, of course, the influence and example of the parents surpassed\r\nall other influences, of the mother more especially, who up to their\r\nmanhood retained over her sons the greatest authority. Of this a\r\nplayful illustration occurs in the Lysis of Plato.[563] Socrates,\r\ninterrogating the youth respecting the course of his studies, inquires\r\narchly whether when in the harem he was not as a matter of course\r\npermitted to play with his mother’s wool basket, and loom, and spathe,\r\nand shuttle?\r\n\r\nFootnote 563:\r\n\r\n  Opp. t. i. p. 118. The influence of imitation over the gesture,\r\n  voice, and thoughts of youth is forcibly pointed out in the\r\n  Republic.—t. vi. p. 124.\r\n\r\n“If I touched them,” replied Lysis, laughing, “I should soon feel the\r\nweight of the shuttle upon my fingers.”\r\n\r\n“But,” proceeds the philosopher, “if your mother or father require\r\nanything to be read or written for them, they, probably, prefer your\r\nservices to those of any other person?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt.”\r\n\r\n“And in this case, as you have been instructed in reading and\r\nspelling, they allow you to proceed according to your own knowledge.\r\nSo likewise, when you play to them on the lyre, they suffer you, as\r\nyou please, to relax or tighten the chords, to touch them with the\r\nfingers, or strike them with the plectron,—do they not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that the authority of the parents was equal;\r\nthough generally at Athens, as Plato[564] elsewhere complains, greater\r\nreverence was paid to the commands of the mother even than to those of\r\nthe father. Indeed to be wanting in respect to her was there deemed\r\nthe _ne plus ultra_ of depravity.[565] The father, however, of\r\nnecessity took a considerable share in the instruction and moral\r\ntraining of his son,[566] who at home profited by his conversation,\r\nand, arrived at the proper age, accompanied him abroad.[567] When\r\nreduced to the state of orphanhood the republic took children under\r\nits own protection, not considering it safe to intrust them to the\r\nsole guidance of masters or pædagogues.\r\n\r\nFootnote 564:\r\n\r\n  Repub. viii. 5. t. ii. p. 182.

Var. Lect. l. xxx. c. 20.\r\n\r\nCare, too, was taken lest those public schools, established for the\r\nadvancement of virtue and morals, should themselves be converted into\r\nnurseries of vice. They were by law[568] forbidden to be opened before\r\nsunrise, and were closed at sunset; nor during the day could any other\r\nmen be introduced besides the teachers,[569] though it appears from\r\nsome of Plato’s dialogues that this enactment was not very strictly\r\nobserved.[570] To prevent habits of brawling, boys were forbidden to\r\nassemble in crowds in the streets on their way to school. Nor were\r\nthese laws deemed sufficient; but still further to protect their\r\nmorals ten annual magistrates called Sophronistæ, one from each tribe,\r\nwere elected by show of hands,[571] whose sole business it was to\r\nwatch over the manners of youth. This magistracy, dated as far back as\r\nthe age of Solon,[572] and continued in force to the latest time. The\r\nGymnasiarch, another magistrate,[573] was intrusted with the\r\nsuperintendence of the Gymnasia, which, like the public games and\r\nfestivals, appeared to require peculiar care; and, if we can receive\r\nthe testimony of Plautus[574] for the classical ages of the\r\ncommonwealth, transgressors received severe chastisement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 568:\r\n\r\n  Æsch. cont.

Here, too, the music-masters frequently gave their lessons,\r\nwhether in singing or on the lyre, which practice explains the\r\nanecdote of the musician, who, hearing the crowd applaud one of his\r\nscholars, gave him a box on the ear, observing, “Had you played well\r\nthese blockheads would not have praised you.” A custom very similar\r\nprevails in the East, where, in recesses open to the street, we often\r\nsee the turbaned schoolmaster with a crowd of little Moslems about\r\nhim, tracing letters on their large wooden tablets or engaged in\r\nrecitations of the Koran.\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  See Coray, Disc.

Numerous boys are seated on forms reading,\r\n  while a delinquent is horsed on the back of another in the true\r\n  Etonian style. One of the carnifices holds his legs, while another\r\n  applies the birch to his naked back. Occasionally in Greece we find\r\n  that free boys were flogged with a leek in lieu of a birch.

For the children of\r\nthe noble and the opulent spacious structures were raised, and\r\nfurnished with tables, desks,—for that peculiar species of\r\ngrammateion[577] which resembled the plate cupboard, can have been\r\nnothing but a desk,—forms, and whatsoever else their studies required.\r\nMention is made of a school at Chios[578] which contained one hundred\r\nand twenty boys, all of whom save one were killed by the falling in of\r\nthe roof. From another tragical story we learn that in Astypalæa,[579]\r\none of the Cyclades, there was a school which contained sixty boys.\r\nThe incidents connected with their death are narrated in the romantic\r\nstyle of the ancients. Cleomedes, a native of this island, having in\r\nboxing slain Iccos the Epidaurian, was accused of unfairness and\r\nrefused the prize, upon which he became mad and returned to his own\r\ncountry. There, entering into the public school, he approached the\r\npillar that supported the roof, and like another Sampson seized it in\r\nan access of frenzy, and wresting it from its basis brought down the\r\nwhole building upon the children. He himself however escaped, but,\r\nbeing pursued with stones by the inhabitants, took sanctuary in the\r\ntemple of Athena, where he concealed himself in the sacred chest. The\r\npeople paying no respect to the holy place still pursued him and\r\nattempted to force open the lid, which he held down with gigantic\r\nstrength. At length when the coffer was broken in pieces Cleomedes was\r\nnowhere to be found, dead or alive. Terrified at this prodigy they\r\nsent to consult the oracle of Delphi, by which they were commanded to\r\npay divine honours to the athlete as the last of the heroes.[580]\r\n\r\nFootnote 577:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iv. 18, 19. x. 57. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 578:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vi. 27.\r\n\r\nFootnote 579:\r\n\r\n  Called the Table of the Gods, from its beauty and amenity.—Steph. de\r\n  Urb. in v. p. 189. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 580:\r\n\r\n  Paus. vi. 9. 6. seq.

Pretending often, when\r\nthey were not, to be thirsty, they would steal in knots to this\r\noratory, and there amuse themselves by splashing the water over each\r\nother; on which account the legislator ordained that strict watch\r\nshould be kept over it. Every morning the forms were spunged,[582] the\r\nschoolroom was cleanly swept, the ink ground ready for use, and all\r\nthings were put in order for the business of the day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 581:\r\n\r\n  Sch.

Græc. p. 413.\r\n\r\nTo the above were added rulers, reed-pens,[587] pen-cases, pen-knives,\r\npencils, and last, though not least, the rod which kept them to the\r\nsteady use of all these things.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  It was as the instrument of literature that the reed subdued half\r\n  the world, though Pliny only celebrates its conquest as an arrow.\r\n  “Ac si quis Æthiopas, Ægyptum, Arabas, Indos, Scythas, Bactros,\r\n  Sarmatarum tot gentes et Orientis, omniaque Parthorum regna\r\n  diligentiùs computet, æqua fermè pars hominum in toto mundo calamis\r\n  superata degit.”—Hist.

They were\r\nprivate speculations, and each master was regulated in his charges by\r\nthe reputation he had acquired and the fortunes of his pupils. Some\r\nappear to have been extremely moderate in their demands.[588]\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  Which was the case even among the sophists, as we find Proclos\r\n  granting a perpetual admission to his lectures for a hundred\r\n  drachmæ.—Philost.

Didaskaloi were not however held in sufficient respect,\r\nthough as their scholars were sometimes very numerous,[589] as many\r\nfor example as a hundred and twenty, it must often have happened that\r\nthey became wealthy. From the life of Homer, attributed to\r\nHerodotus,[590] we glean some few particulars respecting the condition\r\nof a schoolmaster in remoter ages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 47.\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  Vit. Hom. §§ 5. seq. 25. seq.\r\n\r\nPhemios it is there related kept a school at Smyrna, where he taught\r\nboys their letters and all those other parts of education then\r\ncomprehended under the term music. His slave Chritheis, the mother of\r\nthe poet, spun and wove the wool which Phemios received in payment\r\nfrom his scholars. She likewise introduced into his house great\r\nelegance and frugality, which so pleased the school-master that it\r\ninduced him to marry her. Under this man, according to the tradition\r\nreceived in Greece, Homer studied, and made so great a proficiency in\r\nknowledge that he was soon enabled to commence instructor himself. He\r\ntherefore proceeded to Chios,[591] and opened a school where he\r\ninitiated the youth in the beauties of epic poetry, and, performing\r\nhis duties with great wisdom, obtained many admirers among the Chians,\r\nbecame wealthy, and took a wife, by whom he had two sons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  Speaking of the antiquities of this island Chandler remarks: “The\r\n  most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason,\r\n  _The School of Homer_. It is on the coast at some distance from the\r\n  city, northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele,\r\n  formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is\r\n  the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She is\r\n  represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each\r\n  side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim or seat, and\r\n  about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is\r\n  rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity.” i. 61.\r\n\r\nThe earliest task to be performed at school was to gain a knowledge of\r\nthe Greek characters, large and small, to spell next, next to read.\r\nHerodes the Sophist experienced much vexation from the stupidity\r\nexhibited in achieving this enterprise by his son Atticus, whose\r\nmemory was so sluggish that he could not even recollect the\r\nChrist-cross-row. To overcome this extraordinary dulness he educated\r\nalong with him twenty-four little slaves of his own age, upon whom he\r\nbestowed the names of the letters, so that young Atticus might be\r\ncompelled to learn his alphabet as he played with his companions, now\r\ncalling out for Omicron now for Psi.[592] In teaching the art of\r\nwriting their practice nearly resembled our own; the master traced\r\nwith what we must call a pencil (γραφὶς), a number of characters on a\r\ntablet, and the pupil following with the pen the guidance of the faint\r\nlines[593] before him, accustomed his fingers to perform the requisite\r\nmovements with adroitness.[594] These things were necessarily the\r\nfirst step in the first class of studies, which were denominated\r\n_music_,[595] and comprehended everything connected with the\r\ndevelopement of the mind; and they were carried to a certain extent\r\nbefore the second division called gymnastics was commenced. They\r\nreversed the plan commonly adopted among ourselves, for with them\r\npoetry[596] preceded prose, a practice which coöperating with their\r\nsusceptible temperament, impressed upon the national mind that\r\nimaginative character for which it was preëminently distinguished. And\r\nthe poets in whose works they were first initiated were of all the\r\nmost poetical, the authors of lyrical and dithyrambic pieces,\r\nselections from whose verses they committed to memory, thus acquiring\r\nearly a rich store of sentences and imagery ready to be adduced in\r\nargument or illustration, to furnish familiar allusions or to be woven\r\ninto the texture of their style.[597]\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  Philost.

Plat. de Rep. t. i. p. 149. Stallb.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difference however existed in the practice of different\r\nteachers. Some imagining that by the variety of their acquirements\r\nthey would be rendered eloquent, recommended the indiscriminate study\r\nof the poets,[598] whether they wrote in hexameter, in trimeter, or\r\nany other kind of verse, on ludicrous or on serious subjects. Certain\r\npoets there were who like Fenelon and the pretended Ossian, wrote\r\ntheir works in prose,[599] respecting the use of whose compositions\r\nPlato was in some doubt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plato de Legg. t. viii. p. 44. sqq. On the style of declamation\r\n  used in the Greek and Roman schools, see Schömann, de Comit. p. 187.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  There were likewise poems written in the language of the common\r\n  people.—Athen. xiv. 43.\r\n\r\nBy other philosophers wandering unrestrained over the vast fields of\r\nliterature was condemned. They desired to separate the gold from the\r\ndross, contending that persons accustomed from their infancy to the\r\nloftier and purer inspirations of the muse will regard with contempt\r\nevery thing mean or illiberal, whereas they who have learned to\r\ndelight in low and vulgar compositions will consider all other\r\nliterature tame and insipid. For so great is the force of imitation,\r\nthat habits commenced from the earliest years pass into the manners\r\nand character of a man, affecting even his voice and corporeal\r\ndevelopement, nay, modifying the very nature of the thoughts\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the other branches of knowledge[600] most necessary to be\r\nstudied, and to which they applied themselves nearly from the outset,\r\nwas arithmetic, without some inkling of which, a man, in Plato’s\r\nopinion, could scarcely be a citizen at all. For, as he observes,\r\nthere is no art or science which does not stand in some need of it,\r\nespecially the art of war, where many combinations depend entirely on\r\nnumbers. And yet Agamemnon in some of the old tragic poets was\r\nrepresented by Palamedes as wholly ignorant of calculation, so that\r\npossibly, as Socrates jocularly observes, he could not reckon his own\r\nfeet.[601] The importance attached to this branch of education,\r\nnowhere more apparent than in the dialogues of Plato, furnishes one\r\nproof that the Athenians were preëminently men of business, who in all\r\ntheir admiration for the good and beautiful never lost sight of those\r\nthings which promote the comfort of life, and enable a man effectually\r\nto perform his ordinary duties. With the same views were geometry and\r\nastronomy pursued. For, in the Republic, Glaucon,[602] who may be\r\nsupposed to represent the popular opinion, confesses at once, upon the\r\nmention of geometry, that as it is applicable to the business of war\r\nit would be most useful. He could discover the superiority of the\r\ngeometrician[603] over the ignorant man in pitching a camp, in the\r\ntaking of places, in contracting or expanding the ranks of an army,\r\nand all those other military movements practised in battles, marches\r\nor sieges. To Plato however this was its least recommendation. He\r\nconceived that in the search after goodness and truth the study of\r\nthis science was especially beneficial to the mind, both because it\r\ndeals in positive verities, and thus begets a love of them, and\r\nlikewise superinduces the habit of seeking them through lengthened\r\ninvestigation and of being satisfied with nothing less.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 62. where he describes the Egyptian\r\n  method of teaching arithmetic by rewards and allurements. Locke,\r\n  however, condemned the practice. “He that will give to his son\r\n  apples or sugar-plums, or what else of this kind he is most\r\n  delighted with, to make him learn his book, does but authorise his\r\n  love of pleasure, and cocker up that dangerous propensity, which he\r\n  ought by all means to subdue and stifle in him.” Education § 52.\r\n  Vid. Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 340. seq. Muret. Orat. iv. 43. Sir\r\n  Josiah Child has some good remarks on the value of arithmetic as a\r\n  branch of education: “It hath been observed in the nature of\r\n  arithmetic, that, like other parts of the mathematics, it doth not\r\n  only improve the natural faculties, but it inclines those that are\r\n  expert in it to thriftiness and good husbandry, and prevents both\r\n  husbands and wives in some measure from running out of their\r\n  estates, when they have it always ready in their heads what their\r\n  expenses do amount to, and how soon by that course their ruin must\r\n  overtake them.”—Discourse of Trade, p. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. vii. t. vi. p. 340. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 349. seq.

Nub. 181. an anecdote of Thales cutting a new\r\n  channel for the river Halys.\r\n\r\nIn the study of astronomy[604] itself a coarse and obvious utility was\r\nalmost of necessity the first thing aimed at, and even in the age of\r\nSocrates, when philosophical wants were keenly felt in addition to\r\nthose of the animal and civil life, there were evidently teachers who\r\nconsidered it necessary to justify such pursuits, by showing their\r\nbearing on the system of loss and profit. For when Socrates comes in\r\nhis ideal scheme of education to touch on this science, Glaucon, the\r\npractical man, at once recognises its usefulness, not only in\r\nhusbandry and navigation, but in affairs military. Nor are such fruits\r\nof it to be despised. But philosophy proposes a higher aim, insisting,\r\nin opposition to popular belief, that by means of such pursuits the\r\nsoul may be purified, and its powers of discovering truth, overlaid\r\nand nearly extinguished by other studies, rekindled and fanned into\r\nactivity like a flame.\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 357. seq.; de Legg. t. viii. p. 370. Sch.\r\n  Aristoph. Nub. 860. 208.\r\n\r\nThe importance of music,[605] in the education of the Greeks, is\r\ngenerally understood. It was employed to effect several purposes.\r\nFirst, to soothe and mollify the fierceness of the national character,\r\nand prepare the way for the lessons of the poets, which, delivered\r\namid the sounding of melodious strings, when the soul was rapt and\r\nelevated by harmony, by the excitement of numbers, by the magic of the\r\nsweetest associations, took a firm hold upon the mind, and generally\r\nretained it during life. Secondly, it enabled the citizens gracefully\r\nto perform their part in the amusements of social life, every person\r\nbeing in his turn called upon at entertainments to sing or play upon\r\nthe lyre. Thirdly, it was necessary to enable them to join in the\r\nsacred choruses, rendered frequent by the piety of the state, and for\r\nthe due performance in old age of many offices of religion, the\r\nsacerdotal character belonging more or less to all the citizens of\r\nAthens. Fourthly, as much of the learning of a Greek was martial and\r\ndesigned to fit him for defending his country, he required some\r\nknowledge of music that on the field of battle his voice might\r\nharmoniously mingle with those of his countrymen, in chaunting those\r\nstirring, impetuous, and terrible melodies, called pæans, which\r\npreceded the first shock of fight.\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Ilgen. de Scol. Poes. xiv.—“Post Persica demum bella musicæ\r\n  assidue operatos Græcos dicit. Et præmia diebus festis nonnullis\r\n  constituta iis pueris adolescentibusque, qui lyrica carmina Solonis\r\n  aliorumque optime cecinissent.”—Creuzer. de Civ. Athen. Omn. Hum.\r\n  Par. p. 55. seq.\r\n\r\nFor some, or all of these reasons, the science of music began to be\r\ncultivated among the Hellenes, at a period almost beyond the reach\r\neven of tradition. The Bards, whom we behold wandering on the remotest\r\nedge of the fabulous horizon, have invariably harps or lyres in their\r\nhands; and the greatest of the heroes of poetry, the very acme of Epic\r\nexcellence, is represented delighting in the performance of music, and\r\nchaunting on the shores of the Hellespont the deeds of former\r\nwarriors. In those ages the music of the whole nation possessed\r\nevidently a grave and lofty character; but as that of the Ionians\r\nbecame afterwards modified by the influence of a softer climate and\r\nimitation of the Asiatic, while the Dorian measure remained nearly\r\nunchanged, the latter is supposed to have possessed originally the\r\nsuperiority over the former, which in reality it did not. In process\r\nof time, however, the existence of three distinct measures was\r\nrecognised, the Dorian, the Æolian, and the Ionian: the first was\r\ngrave, masculine, full of energy, and though somewhat monotonous\r\npeculiarly adapted to inspire martial ardour; the last distinguished\r\nby a totally different character, rich, varied, flexible, breathing\r\nsoftness and pleasure, adorning the hour of peace and murmuring\r\nplaintively through the groves and temples of Aphrodite, Apollo, and\r\nthe Muses; while the second, which was fiery, with a mixture of\r\ngaiety, formed the intermediate step between the two measures,\r\npartaking something of the character of each. The Hypermixolydian and\r\nHyperphrygian, at one time cultivated among the Ionians, were\r\ncomparatively recent inventions.[606]\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 20. sqq. Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Eq. 984. Clem. Alex. i. 3.\r\n  5.\r\n\r\nThe Phrygian measure distinguished for its exciting and enthusiastic\r\ncharacter,[607] was much employed upon the stage, on which account\r\nAgias the poet used to say that the styrax burned on the altar in the\r\norchestra had a Phrygian smell, because its odours recalled the wild\r\nPhrygian measures there heard. The national instrument of the\r\nPhrygians was the flute, and it is worthy of remark that up to a very\r\nlate period flute-players at Athens were usually distinguished by\r\nPhrygian names. Olympos the greatest musician known to the Greeks, was\r\nprobably himself a native of Phrygia, since he is said to have been a\r\npupil of Marsyas. In fact the barbarians of antiquity appear, though\r\nin a somewhat different way, to have made as much use of music as the\r\nGreeks themselves. They chaunted the songs of their bards in going to\r\nbattle, sang funeral dirges at tombs, and even caused their\r\nambassadors when proceeding on a mission to foreign states to be\r\naccompanied by music.[608] No people, however, appear to have carried\r\ntheir love for music to so preposterous a length as the Tyrrhenians,\r\nwho caused their slaves to be flogged to the sound of the flute.\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  Luc. Nigrin. § 37.\r\n\r\nFootnote 608:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 24.\r\n\r\nThe music of the flute[609] was supposed to be peculiarly delightful\r\nto the gods, so that those who died while its sounds were on their\r\nears were permitted to taste of the gifts of Aphrodite in Hades, as\r\nPhiletæros expresses it in his Flute-lover:\r\n\r\n  “O Zeus! how glorious ’tis to die while piercing flutes are near\r\n  Pouring their stirring melodies into the faltering ear;\r\n  On these alone doth Eros smile within those realms of night,\r\n  Where vulgar ghosts in shivering bands, all strangers to delight,\r\n  In leaky tub from Styx’s flood the icy waters bear,\r\n  Condemned, for woman’s lovely voice, its moaning sounds to hear.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 609:\r\n\r\n  On the effect of music on the mind, see Magius, Var. Lect. p. 204 b.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of music were divided into two classes: the Citharistæ,\r\nwho simply played on the instrument, and the Citharœdi who accompanied\r\nthemselves on the cithara with a song.[610] Of these the humble and\r\npoorer taught, as we have already observed, in the corners of the\r\nstreets, while the abler and more fortunate opened schools of music or\r\ngave their lessons in the private dwellings of the great. The Cithara,\r\nhowever, was not anciently in use at Athens, if we may credit the\r\ntradition which attributes to Phrynis its introduction from\r\nIonia.[611]\r\n\r\nFootnote 610:\r\n\r\n  Kühn ad Poll. iv. p. 711. Cf. Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 611:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Nub. 958; Vesp. 574.\r\n\r\nDamon the great Athenian musician[612] used to observe, that wherever\r\nthe mind is susceptible of powerful emotions there will be the song\r\nand the dance, and that wherever men are free and honourable their\r\namusements will be liberal and decorous, where men are otherwise the\r\ncontrary. A very judicious remark was likewise made by Caphesias the\r\nflute-player. Observing one of his pupils striving to produce loud\r\nsounds, he stamped on the ground and said,—\"Boy, that is not always\r\ngood which is great; but that is great which is good.\"[613]\r\n\r\nFootnote 612:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. Repub. t. vi. p. 133.\r\n\r\nFootnote 613:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 26.\r\n\r\nThe power of music in assuaging passion and anger is well illustrated\r\nby an anecdote of Cleinias the Pythagorean philosopher, a man\r\ndistinguished for his virtue and gentleness. If at any time he felt\r\nhimself moved to wrath, taking up his lyre he would touch the chords\r\nand chaunt thereto some ode, and if any questioned why he did so, he\r\nwould reply, “I am in search of serenity.”[614]\r\n\r\nFootnote 614:\r\n\r\n  Πραΰνομοι. Cham. Pont. ap. Athen. xiv. 18.\r\n\r\nLike the Hebrews, also, the people of Hellas attributed to music still\r\nmore marvellous virtues,[615] conceiving it to be able to cure\r\ndiseases both of the mind and body. Thus the sounds of the flute were\r\nsupposed to remove epilepsy, and sciatica, and faintness, and fear,\r\nand paroxysms of long-established madness,[616] which will probably\r\nremind the reader of David playing before Saul, when his mind was\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 615:\r\n\r\n  Thus demons were expelled by the sound of brass bells.—Magius, Var.\r\n  Lect. p. 205. b.\r\n\r\nFootnote 616:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 18.

Among northern nations the\r\ninfluence of education is requisite to soften the manners and check\r\nferocity; but in the south hardihood must in general be the fruit of\r\ndiscipline, and flourishes only while assiduously cultivated. Thus we\r\nfind that the Persians,[619] by acting on the advice of Crœsos, and\r\nteaching the Lydians to become musicians and shopkeepers, uprooted\r\nentirely their martial spirit. In Greece, however, during the\r\nflourishing period of her history there was more danger that the\r\npassion for war should drown all others, than that its influence\r\nshould be too feeble. Among the Athenians particularly, that restless\r\nenergy of character, so marvellous and so distasteful to the Dorians,\r\nsought vent in dangerous and distant wars and stupendous schemes of\r\nambition. This characteristic trait is adduced by Plato for the\r\npurpose of suggesting a contrast with the rival race. He had been\r\ndwelling, to his Cretan and Spartan companions, on the exercises\r\nnecessary for pregnant women,[620] and observing their astonishment,\r\nhe could understand, he said, how it might appear extraordinary to\r\nthem, but at Athens his recommendation would be perfectly\r\nintelligible; for there, people were rather too active than otherwise.\r\nThe difficulty always was to find becoming employment. Accordingly,\r\nfor lack of something better, not merely boys but grown-up men,\r\ncomprehending nothing of the _dolce far niente_, employed themselves\r\nin breeding cocks, quails, and other birds for fighting, and the care\r\nof these imposed on them the necessity of much exercise. To be sure,\r\nthese cock-fighters, during their professional perambulations,\r\npresented a spectacle infinitely ludicrous. All regard to appearances\r\nwas abandoned. With a couple of small cocks[621] in their hands, and\r\nan old one under either arm, they sallied forth, like vagabonds who\r\nhad been robbing a henroost, to give their favourite animals air and\r\ngentle exercise, and thus laden often strolled several miles into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 618:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

But within the bounds of moderation it was prescribed\r\nby philosophers in lieu of physic, and as an antidote against those\r\npale faces and emaciated frames, too common where intellectual studies\r\nare ardently pursued.[622] It was a law of Solon, that every\r\nAthenian[623] should be able to read and to swim; and the whole spirit\r\nof Attic legislation, leaving the poor to the exercise of industrious\r\nand hardy occupations, tended to create among the opulent and the\r\nnoble a taste for field-sports, horsemanship, and every martial and\r\nmanly exercise.[624] The difficulty, of course, was to render them\r\nsubordinate to mental cultivation, and to blend both so cunningly\r\ntogether as to produce a beautiful and harmonious system of\r\ndiscipline, well fitted to ripen and bring to greatest perfection\r\nevery power and faculty of body and mind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 622:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

At first, no doubt, the exercises, frequently\r\nperformed in honour of the gods,[626] were few and rude; but by the\r\nage of Homer they had assumed an artificial and regular form, and\r\ncomprehended nearly all such divisions of the art as prevailed in\r\nlater times. Other views than those with which they were instituted,\r\ncaused them to be kept up. When reflection awoke, it was perceived\r\nthat in these amicable contests men acquired not only force and\r\nagility, a martial bearing, the confidence of strength, beauty, and\r\nlightness of form; but, along with them, that easy cheerfulness into\r\nwhich robust health naturally blossoms.[627] In fact, so far were the\r\nlegislators of Greece from designing by gymnastics to create, as\r\nMontesquieu[628] supposes, a nation of mere athletes and combatants,\r\nthat they expressly repudiate the idea, affirming that lightness,\r\nagility, a compactly knit frame, health, but chiefly a well-poised and\r\nvigorous mind, were the object of this part of education. In order the\r\nbetter to attain this point, Plato in his republic ordains that boys\r\nbe completed in their intellectual studies, which in his ideal state\r\nthey were to be at the age of sixteen, before they entered the\r\ngymnasium, the exercises of which were to be the companions of simple\r\nmusic. From converting their citizens into athletes they were\r\nprevented by experience; for it was quickly discovered that those men\r\nwho made a profession of gymnastics acquired, indeed, by their diet\r\nand peculiar discipline a huge stature and enormous strength, but were\r\naltogether useless in war, being sleepy, lethargic, prodigious eaters,\r\nincapable of enduring thirst or hunger, and liable to the attacks of\r\nsudden and fatal diseases if they departed in the least degree from\r\ntheir usual habits and regimen.[629]\r\n\r\nFootnote 625:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Runners, it was observed, had large legs;\r\n  wrestlers small.—Xenoph. Conv. ii. 17.\r\n\r\nAlready in the Homeric age, gymnastics, though not as yet so\r\nnamed, constituted the principal object of education, and many\r\nbranches of the art had even then been carried to a high degree of\r\nperfection.[630] The passion for it descended unimpaired to the\r\nSpartans, whose polity, framed solely for the preservation of\r\nnational independence and the acquisition of glory in war,\r\ninspired little fondness for mental pursuits, but left the youth\r\nchiefly to the influence of the gymnasia, which gradually created\r\nin them a temper of mind compounded of insensibility and\r\nferocity,[631] not unlike that of the North American Indians.\r\nThis, however, they above all things prized, though as has been\r\njustly observed their exercises could in no sense be considered\r\namong the aids to intellectual cultivation.[632]\r\n\r\nFootnote 630:\r\n\r\n  Feith, Antiq.

Antiq. § 26. n. 2.\r\n\r\nAt Athens they came later into vogue, though common in the age of\r\nSolon. When, however, this ardent and enthusiastic people commenced\r\nthe study of gymnastics, admiring as they did strength and vigour of\r\nframe, when united with manly beauty, their plastic genius soon\r\nconverted it into an art worthy to be enumerated among the studies of\r\nyouth. In very early ages they imitated the Spartan custom of\r\nadmitting even boys into the gymnasia. But this was soon abandoned, it\r\nbeing found more profitable first to instruct them in several of the\r\nbranches of study above described, and a class of men[633] called\r\npædotribæ or gymnasts arose, who taught the gymnastic art privately,\r\nin subordination to their other studies, and were regarded as\r\nindispensable in the progress of education.[634] These masters gave\r\ntheir instructions in the palæstræ,[635] which generally formed a part\r\nof the gymnasia, though not always joined with those edifices, and to\r\nbe carefully distinguished from them. It is not known with certainty\r\nat what age boys commenced their gymnastic exercises, though it\r\nappears probable that it was not until their grammatical and musical\r\nstudies were completed, that is somewhere perhaps, as Plato counsels,\r\nabout the age of sixteen. For it was not judged advisable to engage\r\nthem in too many studies at once, since in bodies not yet endowed with\r\nall their strength over-exertion was considered injurious.\r\n\r\nFootnote 633:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Of these\r\nestablishments there were many at Athens;[636] though three only,\r\nthose of the Academy, Lyceum, and Cynosarges have acquired celebrity.\r\nThe site of the first of these gymnasia being low and marshy was in\r\nancient times infested with malaria, but having been drained by Cimon\r\nand planted with trees it became a favourite promenade and place of\r\nexercise.[637] Here, in walks shaded by the sacred olive, might be\r\nseen young men,[638] with crowns of rushes in flower upon their heads,\r\nenjoying the sweet odour of the smilax and the white poplar, while the\r\nplatanos and the elm mingled their murmurs in the breeze of spring.\r\nThe meadows of the Academy, according to Aristophanes the grammarian,\r\nwere planted with the Apragmosune,[639] a sort of flower so called as\r\nthough it smelt of all kind of fragrance and safety like our\r\nHeart’s-ease or flower of the Trinity. This place is supposed to have\r\nderived its name from Ecadamos, a public-spirited man who bequeathed\r\nhis property for the purpose of keeping it in order. Around it were\r\ngroves of the moriæ sacred to Athena, whence the olive crowns used in\r\nthe Panathenaia were taken. The reason why the olive trees as well as\r\nthose in the Acropolis were denominated moriæ must be sought for among\r\nthe legends of the mythology, where it is related that Halirrothios\r\nson of Poseidon formed the design of felling them because the\r\npatronship of the city had been adjudged to Athena, for the discovery\r\nof this tree. Raising his axe, however, and aiming a blow at the trunk\r\nthe implement glanced, and he thus inflicted upon himself a wound\r\nwhereof he died.[640]\r\n\r\nFootnote 636:\r\n\r\n  There was a gymnasium sacred to Hermes, near the Peiraic\r\n  gate.—Leake, Topog. of Attica, p. 124.\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

It lay near the banks of the Ilissos, and was adorned\r\nwith stately edifices, fountains and groves. Here stood a celebrated\r\nstatue of Apollo, in a graceful attitude, as if reposing after toil,\r\nwith his bow in the left hand, and the right bent negligently over his\r\nhead. The walls, too, were decorated with paintings. In this place\r\nanciently the Polemarch held his court[643] and the forces of the\r\nrepublic were exercised before they went forth to war.[644]\r\n\r\nFootnote 641:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. i. 19. 3.

Its principal patron,\r\nhowever, was Heracles,[647] who, lying himself under the suspicion of\r\nillegitimacy, came very naturally to be regarded as the protector of\r\nbastards, half citizens, and in general all persons of spurious birth,\r\nwho accordingly in remoter ages resorted thither to perform their\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nFootnote 645:\r\n\r\n  Liv. xxxi. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 646:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v. Κυνόσαργ. t. i. p. 1550. e.\r\n\r\nFootnote 647:\r\n\r\n  In the gymnasia, the statue of Eros was generally placed beside\r\n  those of this divinity and Hermes.—Athen. xiii. 12.\r\n\r\nThemistocles afterwards, by prevailing upon several of the young\r\nnobility to accompany him to the Cynosarges, obliterated its reproach,\r\nand placed it on the same level with the other gymnasia.[648] Here\r\nanciently stood a court in which causes respecting illegitimacy, false\r\nregistry, &c. were tried. But to proceed to the general description.\r\n“The gymnasia were spacious edifices, surrounded by gardens and a\r\nsacred grove. The first entrance was by a square court, two stadia in\r\ncircumference, encompassed with porticoes and buildings. On three of\r\nits sides were large halls, provided with seats, in which\r\nphilosophers, rhetoricians, and sophists assembled their disciples. On\r\nthe fourth were rooms for bathing and other practices of the\r\ngymnasium. The portico facing the south was double, to prevent the\r\nwinter rains, driven by the wind, from penetrating into the interior.\r\nFrom this court you passed into an enclosure, likewise square, shaded\r\nin the middle by plane-trees. A range of colonnades extended round\r\nthree of the sides. That which fronted the north had a double row of\r\ncolumns, to shelter those who walked there in summer from the sun. The\r\nopposite piazza was called Xystos, in the middle of which, and through\r\nits whole length, they contrived a sort of pathway, about twelve feet\r\nwide and nearly two deep, where, sheltered from the weather, and\r\nseparated from the spectators ranged along the sides, the young\r\nscholars exercised themselves in wrestling. Beyond the Xystos was a\r\nstadium for foot-races.”[649]\r\n\r\nFootnote 648:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Them. § 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 649:\r\n\r\n  Barthel. Trav. of Anach. ii. p. 133. sqq.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of the gymnasium were,—first, the porticoes,\r\nfurnished with seats and side-buildings where the youths met to\r\nconverse. 2. The Ephebeion,[650] that part of the edifice where the\r\nyouth alone exercised. 3. The Apodyterion, or undressing-room.[651] 4.\r\nThe Konisterion, or small court in which was kept the haphe, or yellow\r\nkind of sand sprinkled by the wrestlers over their bodies[652] after\r\nbeing anointed with the ceroma, or oil tempered with wax. An important\r\npart of the baggage of Alexander in his Indian expedition consisted of\r\nthis fine sand for the gymnasium. 5. The Palæstra, when considered as\r\npart of the gymnasium,[653] was simply the place set apart for\r\nwrestling: the whole of its area was covered with a deep stratum of\r\nmud. 6. The Sphæristerion,[654]—that part of the gymnasium in which\r\nthey played at ball. 7. Aleipterion or Elaiothesion,[655] that part of\r\nthe palæstra where the wrestlers anointed themselves with oil. 8. The\r\narea: the great court, and certain spaces in the porticoes, were used\r\nfor running, leaping, or pitching the quoit. 9. The Xystoi have been\r\ndescribed above. 10. The Xysta[656] were open walks in which, during\r\nfine weather, the youths exercised themselves in running or any other\r\nsuitable recreation. 11. The Balaneia or baths, where in numerous\r\nbasins was water of various degrees of temperature, in which the young\r\nmen bathed before anointing themselves, or after their exercises. 12.\r\nBehind the Xystos, and running parallel with it, lay the stadium,[657]\r\nwhich, as its name implies, was usually the eighth part of a mile in\r\nlength. It resembled the section of a cylinder, rounded at the ends.\r\nFrom the area below, where the runners performed their exercises, the\r\nsides, whether of green turf or marble, sloped upwards to a\r\nconsiderable height, and were covered with seats, rising behind each\r\nother to the top for the accommodation of spectators.\r\n\r\nFootnote 650:\r\n\r\n  Vitruv. v. 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 651:\r\n\r\n  Plin. xxv. 13.—Even old men performed their exercises naked.—Plat.\r\n  de Rep. t. vi. p. 221.\r\n\r\nFootnote 652:\r\n\r\n  Casaub. ad Theoph.

Of this covered walk Aristeas makes\r\n  mention in a fragment of his Orpheus:—\r\n\r\n                    Ἦν μοὶ παλαίστρα καὶ δρόμος\r\n                         ξυστὸς πέλας.\r\n                                       Poll. ix. 43.\r\n\r\nFootnote 657:\r\n\r\n  Potter, Book i. chap. 8.\r\n\r\nSuch were the buildings which Athens appropriated to the exercises of\r\nits youth; and if we consider the conveniences which they contained,\r\nthe large spaces they enclosed, and the taste and magnificence which\r\nthey exhibited, we shall probably conclude that no country in the\r\nworld ever bestowed on the physical training of its citizens so much\r\nenlightened care.\r\n\r\nThe first step in gymnastics was to accustom the youth to endure,\r\nnaked, the fiercest rays of the sun and the cold of winter, to which\r\nthey were exposed during their initiatory exercises.[658] This is\r\nillustrated in a very lively manner by Lucian, where he introduces the\r\nScythian Anacharsis anxious to escape from the scorching rays of noon\r\nto the shade of the plane-trees; while Solon, who had been educated\r\naccording to the Hellenic system, stands without inconvenience\r\nbareheaded in the sun. The step next in order was wrestling, always\r\nregarded as the principal among gymnastic contests, both from its\r\nsuperior utility and the great art and skill which the proper practice\r\nof it required. To the acquisition of excellence in this exercise the\r\npalæstra and the instructions of the pædotribæ were almost entirely\r\ndevoted; while nearly every other branch of gymnastics was performed\r\nin the gymnasium. These, according to Lucian, were divided into two\r\nclasses, one of which required for their performance a soft or muddy\r\narea, the other one of sand, or an arena properly so called.[659] In\r\nall these exercises the youth were naked, and had their bodies\r\nanointed with oil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 658:\r\n\r\n  Lucian, Amor. § 45. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 659:\r\n\r\n  Lucian, Anach. § § 1–3. 28.\r\n\r\nTo render, however our account of the exercises more complete, it may\r\nbe proper to give a separate though brief description of each. The\r\nfirst or most simple was the Dromos or Course,[660] performed, as has\r\nbeen above observed, in the area of the stadium, which, in order to\r\npresent the greater difficulty to the racers, was deeply covered with\r\nsoft and yielding sand. Still further to enhance the labour, the youth\r\nsometimes ran in armour, which admirably prepared them for the\r\nvicissitudes of war, for pursuit after victory, or the rapid movements\r\nof retreat. The high value which the Greeks set upon swiftness may be\r\nlearned from the poems of Homer, where likewise are found the most\r\ngraphic and brilliant descriptions of the several exercises. Some of\r\nthese we shall here introduce from Pope’s version, which in this part\r\nis peculiarly sustained and nervous. Speaking of the race between\r\nOilean Ajax, Odysseus, and Antilochos, he says:—[661]\r\n\r\n           “Ranged in a line the ready racers stand,\r\n           Pelides points the barrier with his hand.\r\n           All start at once, Oileus led the race;\r\n           The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace,\r\n           Behind him diligently close he sped,\r\n           As closely following as the mazy thread\r\n           The spindle follows, and displays the charms\r\n           Of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms.\r\n           Graceful in motion, thus his foe he plies,\r\n           And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;\r\n           The glowing breath upon his shoulder plays,\r\n           Th’ admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise,\r\n           To him they give their wishes, heart, and eyes,\r\n           And send their souls before him as he flies.\r\n           Now three times turned, in prospect of the goal,\r\n           The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul;\r\n           Assist, O Goddess, (thus in thought he prayed,)\r\n           And present at his thought descends the maid;\r\n           Buoyed by her heavenly force he seems to swim,\r\n           And feels a pinion lifting every limb.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 660:\r\n\r\n  Accumenes, the friend of Socrates, advised persons to walk on the\r\n  high-road in preference to the places of exercise, as being less\r\n  fatiguing and more beneficial.—Plat.

They appear to have\r\n  acquired so equable and steady a pace that time was measured by\r\n  their movements, as distance is by that of caravans in the East.\r\n  Thus Dioscorides, ii. 96. gives direction that gall should be boiled\r\n  while a person could run three stadia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 661:\r\n\r\n  Il. ψ. 754. sqq. Cf. Odyss. η. 119.—As an illustration of the\r\n  necessity there was of going through all the various exercises, it\r\n  is mentioned by Xenophon that runners had large legs, wrestlers\r\n  small ones.—Conviv. ii. 17.\r\n\r\nNext in the natural order, proceeding from the simplest to the most\r\nartificial exercises, was leaping, in which the youth among the Greeks\r\ndelighted to excel. In the performance of this exercise they usually\r\nsprang from an artificial elevation (βατὴρ), and descended upon the\r\nsoft mould, which, when ploughed up with their heels, was termed\r\nἐσκαμμένα.[662] The better to poise their bodies and enable them to\r\nbound to a greater distance, they carried in their hands metallic\r\nweights, denominated _halteres_,[663] in the form of a semi disk,\r\nhaving on their inner faces handles like the thong of a shield,\r\nthrough which the fingers were passed. Extraordinary feats are related\r\nof these ancient leapers. Chionis the Spartan and Phaÿllos the\r\nCrotonian, being related to have cleared at one bound the space of\r\nfifty-two, or according to others, of fifty-five feet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 662:\r\n\r\n  Poll. iii. 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 663:\r\n\r\n  Paus. v. 26. 3; 27. 12.\r\n\r\nWith the latter account agrees the inscription on the Crotonian’s\r\nstatue:\r\n\r\n           “Phaÿllos leaped full five and fifty feet,\r\n           The discus flung one hundred wanting five.”[664]\r\n\r\nFootnote 664:\r\n\r\n  Eustath. ad Odyss. θ. 128. Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 210.\r\n\r\nHomer briefly describes leaping among the sports of the Phæacians:\r\n\r\n            “Amphialos sprang forward with a bound,\r\n            Superior in the leap a length of ground.”[665]\r\n\r\nFootnote 665:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. θ. 128.\r\n\r\nTo this succeeded pitching the quoit, which in the Homeric age would\r\nappear to have been practised with large stones or rude masses of\r\niron. On ordinary occasions it has been conjectured that one discus\r\nonly was used. But Odysseus, desirous of exhibiting his strength to\r\nthe Phæacians, converts into a quoit the first block of stone within\r\nhis reach.[666]\r\n\r\n          “Then striding forward with a furious bound\r\n          He wrenched a rocky fragment from the ground,\r\n          By far more ponderous and more large by far\r\n          Than what Phæacia’s sons discharged in air;\r\n          Fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings,\r\n          Sonorous through the shaded air it sings;\r\n          Couched to the earth, tempestuous as it flies,\r\n          The crowd gaze upwards while it cleaves the skies.\r\n          Beyond all marks, with many a giddy round,\r\n          Down rushing it upturns a hill of ground.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 666:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. θ. 186. sqq. Cf. Il. ψ. 836. seq.\r\n\r\nThe disk[667] in later times varied greatly both in shape, size, and\r\nmaterials. Generally it would seem to have been a cycloid, swelling in\r\nthe middle and growing thin towards the edges. Sometimes it was\r\nperforated in the centre and hurled forward by a thong, and on other\r\noccasions would appear to have approached the spherical form, when it\r\nwas denominated solos.[668]\r\n\r\nFootnote 667:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Hom. Il. β. 774.\r\n\r\nFootnote 668:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Hom. Il. β. 774.\r\n\r\nOther of these exercises were shooting with the bow at wisps of straw\r\nstuck upon a pole,[669] and darting the javelin, sometimes with the\r\nnaked hand and sometimes with a thong wound about the centre of the\r\nweapon. In the stadium at Olympia, the area within which the pentathli\r\nleaped, pitched the quoit, and hurled the javelin, appears to have\r\nbeen marked out by two parallel trenches: but if these existed\r\nlikewise in the gymnasia, they must have been extremely shallow, as we\r\nfind in Antiphon[670] a boy meeting with his death by inconsiderately\r\nrunning across the area while the youths were engaged in this\r\nexercise. Instead of throwing for the furthest, they would seem, from\r\nthe expressions of the orator, to have aimed at a mark.\r\n\r\nFootnote 669:\r\n\r\n  Lucian.

In the other, called Anaclinopale, the wrestler who\r\ndistrusted his own strength but had confidence in his courage and\r\npowers of endurance, voluntarily flung himself upon the ground,\r\nbringing his adversary along with him, and then by pinching,\r\nscratching, biting, and every other species of annoyance, sought to\r\ncompel him to yield.\r\n\r\nFootnote 671:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sch. Aristoph. Eq. 569.\r\n\r\nAn example of wrestling in both its forms occurs in Homer, where Ajax\r\nTelamon and Odysseus contend in the funeral games for the prize.[672]\r\n\r\n       “Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,\r\n       Embracing rigid, with implicit hands;\r\n       Close locked above, their heads and arms are mixt;\r\n       Below their planted feet at distance fixt.\r\n       Like two strong rafters which the builder forms\r\n       Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms;\r\n       Their tops connected, but at wider space\r\n       Fixed on the centre stands their solid base.\r\n       Now to the grasp each manly body bends,\r\n       The humid sweat from every pore descends,\r\n       Their bones resound with blows, sides, shoulders, thighs\r\n       Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\r\n       Nor could Ulysses, for his art renowned,\r\n       O’erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\r\n       Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\r\n       The watchful caution of his artful foe.\r\n       While the long strife even tires the lookers-on,\r\n       Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\r\n       Or let me lift thee, Chief, or lift thou me,\r\n       Prove we our strength and Jove the rest decree.\r\n       He said; and straining heaved him off the ground\r\n       With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\r\n       The strength t’ evade, and where the nerves combine\r\n       His ankle struck: the giant fell supine.\r\n       Ulysses following on his bosom lies,\r\n       Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\r\n       Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;\r\n       He barely stirred him but he could not raise.\r\n       His knee locked fast the foe’s attempt defied,\r\n       And grappling close they tumbled side by side,\r\n       Defiled with honourable dust they roll,\r\n       Still breathing strife and unsubdued of soul.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 672:\r\n\r\n  Il. ψ. 708, sqq. et Heyne ad loc.\r\n\r\nBoxing, which has very properly been called a rough exercise, though\r\ncondemned by physicians and philosophers, was still practised in the\r\ngymnasium, sometimes with the naked fist but more frequently with the\r\ncestus, which consisted of a series of thongs, bound round the hand\r\nand arm up to the elbow, or even higher.[673] This exercise, however,\r\nseems to have been little practised, except by those who designed to\r\nbecome athletæ by profession. Homer has described the combat with the\r\ncestus in its most terrible form.[674]\r\n\r\n         “Amid the circle now each champion stands,\r\n         And poises high in air his iron hands:\r\n         With clashing gauntlets now they firmly close,\r\n         Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\r\n         And painful sweat from all their members flows.\r\n         At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\r\n         Full on the cheek of his unwary foe.\r\n         Beneath that ponderous arm’s resistless sway\r\n         Down dropped he powerless, and extended lay.\r\n         As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\r\n         By some huge billow dashed against the shore,\r\n         Lies panting, not less battered with his wound,\r\n         The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\r\n         To rear his fallen foe the victor lends\r\n         Scornful his hand, and gives him to his friends,\r\n         Whose arms support him reeling through the throng,\r\n         And dragging his disabled legs along.\r\n         Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulders o’er,\r\n         His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore.\r\n         Wrapped round in mist he lies, and lost to thought,\r\n         His friends receive the bowl too dearly bought.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 673:\r\n\r\n  Theoc.

This feat seems to\r\nhave been so great a favourite among the youths of antiquity, that\r\nthey applied themselves to it with constant assiduity, and arrived at\r\nlength at a degree of skill little inferior to that of our\r\nmountebanks. It seems, in fact, to have been a common practice in the\r\ngymnasium to run upon the tight rope. The Romans, seeking in something\r\nto outdo the Greeks, taught an elephant to perform a similar exploit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 675:\r\n\r\n  But Galen cautions youth against useless acquisitions, which he says\r\n  are not arts at all: such as πεττευριπτεῖν, throwing the\r\n  tali,—walking over a small tight rope,—whirling round without being\r\n  giddy, like Myrmecides the Athenian and Callicrates the\r\n  Spartan.—Protrept. § 9. p. 20. Kühn.—He then speaks very slightingly\r\n  of gymnastic exercises. The studies he recommends are: medicine,\r\n  rhetoric, music, geometry, arithmetic, dialectics, astronomy,\r\n  grammar, and jurisprudence, to which may be added, modelling and\r\n  painting.—§ 14. Cf. Foës. Œcon. Hip. p. 366.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of gymnastics consisted in the various forms of the\r\ndance, to be ignorant of which was at Athens esteemed a mark of an\r\nilliberal education. To excel in this accomplishment was nearly by all\r\nthe Greeks[676] considered absolutely necessary, either as a\r\npreparation for the due performance of the movements and evolutions of\r\nwar, sustaining a proper part in the religious choruses, or regulating\r\nthe carriage with the requisite grace and decorum in the various\r\nrelations of private life. Thus the Cretans, the Spartans, the\r\nThessalians, and the Bœotians, held this division of gymnastics in\r\nespecial honour, chiefly with a view to war, while the Athenians, and\r\nIonians generally, contemplated it more as a means of developing the\r\nbeauty of the form, and conferring ease and elegance on the gait and\r\ngesture. But because in treating of the theatre I design fully to\r\ndescribe the several varieties of scenic dances, I think it proper to\r\nthrow together in that place whatever I may have to say on this\r\nsubject.[677]\r\n\r\nFootnote 676:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Aristot. de Poet. i. 6. Herm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 677:\r\n\r\n  See Book iv. Chapter 8.\r\n\r\nTo all these branches of gymnastics the Grecian youth[678] applied\r\nthemselves with peculiar eagerness, and on quitting the schools\r\ndevoted to them a considerable portion of their time, since they were\r\nregarded both as a preparation for victory in the Olympic and other\r\ngames, and as the best possible means for promoting health and\r\nripening the physical powers. Nor could anything be easily conceived\r\nbetter suited to the genius of their republics. In the first place, as\r\nI have already observed, the wild and headstrong period of youth was\r\nwithdrawn by these agreeable exercises from the desire and thoughts of\r\nevil, while a wholesome feeling of equality was cultivated, and\r\nsomething like brotherhood engendered in men destined to live and act\r\ntogether. Besides what could more admirably prepare them for\r\nfulfilling their duties as citizens and more especially for defending\r\ntheir country, than a system of physical training, which at the same\r\ntime brought to perfection their strength, their vigour, and their\r\nmanly beauty, and fitted them for the acquisition of that peculiar\r\nspecies of glory which success in the sacred games conferred? The\r\nacquisition, moreover, of robust health and that vigour of mind which\r\naccompanies it, was a consideration second to none. And it will\r\nreadily be conceived that a judicious system of exercises, such as we\r\nhave described, would necessarily render men patient of labour,\r\ninaccessible to fear, and be productive at once of graceful habits and\r\nlofty and honourable sentiments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 678:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 97.—The gymnasia in the later ages of\r\n  Greece were so little frequented, that their area was sown with\r\n  corn. Dion. Chrysos. i. 223.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                          HUNTING AND FOWLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the sports and pastimes of the Greeks, which may be considered\r\nas a kind of supplement to gymnastics, we must class first the chase,\r\nwhich Xenophon vainly hoped might be made to operate as a check on the\r\nluxurious and effeminate habits of his contemporaries.[679] But each\r\nage having its own distinctive characteristic, it profits very little\r\nto aim at engrafting the customs of one period of civilisation upon\r\nanother. The world will go its own gait. Chuckfarthing and Pricking\r\nthe Loop might as well be recommended to young gentlemen and ladies\r\ndying for love, as hunting to the population of a vain and foppish\r\ncity, to whom wild boars and wolves must seem certain death. However,\r\nthe country gentlemen, and the agricultural population generally, long\r\nin their own defence continued the practice of the chase, though in\r\nAttica the absence of wild animals, consequent upon a high and careful\r\ncultivation, had reduced it at a very early period to a matter of mere\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 679:\r\n\r\n  In the early ages of the world, hunting we are assured led to the\r\n  establishment of monarchy by accustoming youth whose brains were in\r\n  their sinews to pay implicit obedience to their leaders in the\r\n  chase.—Bochart, Geog. Sac. t. i. p. 258.\r\n\r\nBut in remoter times, and in those parts of the country where game\r\nalways continued to abound, there were never wanting persons who\r\ndelighted in the excitement of the chase. Herdsmen, particularly, and\r\nshepherds, considered it part of their occupation.[680] Thus we find\r\nAnchises a young Trojan chief, who inhabited the hill country, making\r\nhis lair of bears and lion-skins, the spoils of his own lance.[681]\r\nSport, of course, it would furnish to bold and reckless young men, as\r\nlion and tiger hunting still does to our countrymen in Northern India;\r\nbut from this recreation proceeded in some measure their safety, since\r\nwhere wild beasts are numerous they not only devastate the\r\ncountry,[682] trampling down the corn-fields and devouring herds and\r\nflocks, but occasionally, if they chance to find them unarmed, dine\r\nalso upon their hunters. Thus the chase of the Calydonian boar, the\r\ntally-ho’s and view-halloes of which still sound fresh in song, was\r\nundertaken by the Ætolians and Curetes, for the purpose of delivering\r\nthe rustic population from a pest;[683] and precisely the same motive\r\nurged Alcmena’s boy into the famous conflict with the Nemean\r\nlion,[684] which he brought down with his invincible bow and finished\r\nwith his wild olive club. In like manner Theseus, his rival in glory,\r\nslew the Marathonian bull; and delivered the Cretans from another\r\nmonster of the same kind.[685] He engaged, too, with a sow of great\r\nsize at Crommyon on the confines of Corinthia, and slaughtered the\r\npig, an achievement of much utility and no little glory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 680:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, λ. 547.\r\n\r\nFootnote 681:\r\n\r\n  Hom.

Sometimes, to the\r\nattack of the wild bull or the boar, they went forth with formidable\r\nbattle-axes.[686] But when their game was fleet and innocuous a\r\nhandful of light javelins and the bow sufficed, as when Odysseus and\r\nhis companions beat the country in search of wild goats.[687] In the\r\nÆneid, too, we find the hero doing great execution among a herd of\r\ndeer with his bow. Boar-spears also were in use ere the period of the\r\nTrojan war, as Odysseus, who appears to have been excessively addicted\r\nto the chase, is represented going thus armed to the field with the\r\nsons of Autolycos when he was wounded by the hog.[688] With the same\r\nweapon we find Adrastos engaged in the same sport, killing the son of\r\nCrœsos.[689] The chase of the lion, which in Xenophon’s time could\r\nno longer be enjoyed in Greece Proper, required the most daring\r\ncourage and the most formidable weapons, spears, javelins, clubs, and\r\nburning torches, with which at last they repelled him at night from\r\nthe cattle stalls. Homer, as usual, represents the contest to the\r\nlife:[690]\r\n\r\n “He turned to go, as slow retreats the lion from the stalls,\r\n Whom men and dogs assault while round a shower of javelins falls.\r\n They all night watch about their herds, lest he intent on prey\r\n Should bear the flower of all their fields, the fattest bull away.\r\n Onward impetuously he bounds—the hissing javelins fly\r\n From daring hands, while torches send their blaze far up the sky.\r\n He dreads, though fierce, the dazzling flames thick flashing on his\r\n    sight,\r\n And hungry still and breathing rage, retires with morning’s light.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 686:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ρ. 520. seq.

Egypt, Chaldæa,\r\nAssyria, the earliest peopled countries, enjoyed few of these helps to\r\nrefinement. The reasons of Greek civilisation lay neither in their\r\ncountry or in the accidents of it, but in the race itself, which, as\r\none family in a nation is distinguished from its neighbours by\r\nsuperior genius, was thus distinguished from other races of men.\r\nHowever, the lion, as we have seen, formerly existed among them,\r\nthough never probably in great numbers, and even in the age of\r\nHerodotus was still found in a wild tract of country extending from\r\nthe Acheloös in Acarnania to the Nestos in Thrace,[692] where in\r\nfabulous times Olynthos, son of Strymon,[693] is said to have been\r\nslain in a lion hunt. In the age of Dion Chrysostom, however, this\r\nfierce animal was no longer known in Europe.[694]\r\n\r\nFootnote 691:\r\n\r\n  Hist. of Greece, i. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 692:\r\n\r\n  Herod. vii. 125. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 693:\r\n\r\n  Conon, Dieg. iv. ap.

Odysseus’ famous dog Argos was a hound that\r\n\r\n “Never missed in deepest woods the swift game to pursue\r\n If once it glanced before his sight, for every track he knew.[695]”\r\n\r\nFootnote 695:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. ρ. 316. seq.\r\n\r\nAnd again when the same sagacious Nimrod makes his rounds in quest of\r\n“belly timber,” a brace of dogs runs before him “examining the\r\ntraces,” while with boar-spear in hand he follows close at their\r\nheels.[696] But already, even in those days, the habit of keeping more\r\ncats than catch mice had got into fashion—that is among the\r\ngreat—since we find grandees with their κύνες τραπεζῆες or “table\r\ndogs,”[697] valued simply for their beauty. Patroclus maintained nine\r\nof these handsome animals, and Achilles understanding his tastes, cast\r\ntwo of them into the flames of his funeral pile, that their shades\r\nmight sit at his board in the realms below.[698]\r\n\r\nFootnote 696:\r\n\r\n  Id. τ. 436. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 697:\r\n\r\n  Id. ρ. 310.\r\n\r\nFootnote 698:\r\n\r\n  Iliad ψ. 173. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 699:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. i. 22. et 24.\r\n\r\nFowling too, if we may depend upon Athenæus,[699] entered into the\r\nlist of heroic amusements. It is clear, however, that the sportsmen of\r\nthose days were arrant poachers, for, not content with attacking their\r\nprey in open fight, they condescended to spread nets for them and set\r\ngins for their feet. But being accomplished bowmen, however, they\r\ncould occasionally, when pressed for provisions, fetch down a thrush,\r\na pigeon, or a dove with an arrow, dexterously as that Jew in\r\nEusebius[700] who exhibited his marksmanship to demonstrate the\r\nfallacy of augury. For in the funeral games of Patroclus, we find one\r\nof the heroes hitting from a considerable distance a dove which had\r\nbeen tied by a small cord to the summit of a mast.[701]\r\n\r\nFootnote 700:\r\n\r\n  Præp.

From an expression of Augustus, if we\r\n  can regard it as anything more than a figure of speech, it may be\r\n  inferred that to increase the luxury of the sport by converting it\r\n  into a species of gambling, people sometimes fished with golden\r\n  hooks.—Polyæn.

He appears to have\r\nentertained an especial aversion for the Isaac Waltons of the ancient\r\nworld, and in his advice to youth earnestly exhorts them to eschew\r\nhooks and fish-traps, which he slily classes with piracy and\r\nhouse-breaking: and so he does fowling. Nor would his generous\r\nphilosophy countenance poaching with nets and gins and snares. His\r\nsportsmen, modelled after the old Homeric type, were to mount their\r\nchargers,[706] and accompanied by their dogs come to close quarters\r\nwith their wild foes in open daylight, and subdue them by dint of\r\npersonal courage.[707] Precisely similar views prevailed in the heroic\r\nage, when the chiefs and principal men were exercised from boyhood in\r\nthe chase, as appears from the examples of Achilles and Odysseus;[708]\r\nof whom the former, according to Pindar, tried his hand at a lion at\r\nthe age of six years, ἐξέτης τοπρῶτον. Being swift of foot as those\r\nArabs of Northern Africa, who, as Leo[709] says, are a match for any\r\nhorse, he used without the aid of dogs to overtake and bring down deer\r\nwith his javelin, and whatever prey he took he carried to his old\r\nmaster Cheiron. This passage Mr. Cary has translated in the following\r\nvigorous and elegant manner:—\r\n\r\n               “In Philyra’s house a flaxen boy\r\n               Achilles oft in rapturous joy\r\n               His feats of strength essayed.\r\n               Aloof like wind his little javelin flew,\r\n               The lion and the brinded boar he slew;\r\n               Then homeward to old Cheiron drew\r\n               Their panting carcases.\r\n               This when six years had fled;\r\n               And all the after time\r\n               Of his rejoicing prime\r\n               It was to Dian and the blue-eyed Maid\r\n               A wonder how he brought to ground\r\n               The stag without or toils or hound.\r\n               So fleet of foot was he.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 706:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Their notions of a sportsman’s costume differed\r\nmaterially from our own, for instead of decking themselves like our\r\nfox-hunters in scarlet, they selected the soberest and least brilliant\r\ncolours both for their cloaks and chitons. The latter were in general\r\nextremely short, reaching merely to the hams, as Artemis is usually\r\nrepresented in works of art. But the chlamys was long and ample, that\r\nit might be twisted round the left arm in close contest with the\r\nlarger animals. Their hunting boots reached to the knee, and were\r\nbound tight round the leg with thongs. Probably also, as in\r\ntravelling, they covered their heads with a broad-brimmed hat.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of a Greek sportsman would appear somewhat cumbersome,\r\nand perhaps a little ludicrous to a modern Nimrod. But understanding\r\ntheir own object they went their own way to work; their arms and\r\nimplements, varying with the chase in which they were engaged,\r\nconsisted of short swords, hunting knives[714] for the purpose of\r\ncutting down brushwood to stop up openings in the forest, axes for\r\nfelling trees, darts furnished with thongs for drawing them back when\r\nthey had missed their aim, bows, boar-spears, weapons peculiarly\r\nformidable, nets small and large, some for setting up in the plains,\r\nsome for traversing glades or narrow alleys in the woods, and others\r\nshaped like a female head-net, to be placed in small dusky openings,\r\nwhere being unperceived the game sprang into them as into a sack,\r\nwhich closed about it by means of a running cord, net-poles, forked\r\nstakes, snares, gins, nooses, and leashes for the dogs.[715] The darts\r\nused on these occasions had ashen or beechen handles, and the nets\r\nwere usually manufactured with flax imported from Colchis on the\r\nPhasis, Egypt, Carthage, and Sardinia.[716] Generally, too, they took\r\nalong with them the Lagobalon, a short, crooked stick with a knob at\r\none end, with which they sometimes brought down the hare in its\r\nflight.[717] This practice, common enough among poachers in our\r\ncountry, is by them denominated _squailing_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 714:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 715:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

The\r\nancients, therefore, much addicted to this branch of education, paid\r\ngreat attention to the breed of these animals, of which some were\r\nsought to be rendered celebrated by heroic and fabulous associations.\r\nThus the Castorides, it was said, sprang[718] from a breed to which\r\nthe twin god of Sparta was partial; the Alopecidæ were a cross between\r\na dog and a she-fox; and a third kind[719] arose from the mingling of\r\nthese two races. Among modern sportsmen, there are also good\r\nauthorities who prefer harriers with a quarter of the fox-strain.[720]\r\nOther kinds of hounds, as the Menelaides and Harmodian derived their\r\nappellation from the persons who reared them.[721]\r\n\r\nFootnote 718:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 39.

This breed, according to Aristotle, was\r\nproduced by crossing with the tiger, probably the Cheeta.[727] The\r\nfirst and second removes were considered too fierce and unmanageable,\r\nand it was not until the third generation that these tiger-mules could\r\nbe broken in to the use of the sportsman. Some sought in mythology the\r\norigin of this noble animal; for, according to Nicander, the hounds of\r\nActæon, recovering their senses after the destruction of their master,\r\nfled across the Euphrates and wandered as far as India. Strange\r\nstories are related of this breed, of which some it is said would\r\ncontend with no animal but the lion. Alexander’s dog, which he\r\npurchased in India for a hundred minæ, had twice overcome and slain\r\nthe monarch of the forest.[728]\r\n\r\nFootnote 722:\r\n\r\n  Arist. de Gen. Anim. v. 2. p. 344.

As in\r\nEngland, their principal sport was the hare. In winter,[729] it was\r\nobserved that puss, from the length of the nights, took a wider\r\ncircuit, and therefore afforded the dogs a better chance of detecting\r\nher traces.[730] But when in the morning the ground was covered with\r\nice or white with hoar-frost, the dogs lost their scent, as also\r\namidst abundant dews or after heavy rains. The sportsman accordingly\r\nwaited till the sun was some way up the sky, and had begun to quicken\r\nthe subtile odours communicated to the earth.[731] The west wind,[732]\r\nwhich covers the heavens with vast clouds and fills the air with\r\nmoisture, and the south blowing warm and humid, weaken the scent; but\r\nthe north wind fixes and preserves it.[733] By moonlight, too, as the\r\nold sportsmen remark, and the warmth it emits, the scent is affected;\r\nbesides that when the moon shines brightly, in their frolicsome and\r\nsportive mood the hares, in the secluded glades of the forest, take\r\nlong leaps and bounds over the green sward, leaving wide intervals\r\nbetween their traces.[734]\r\n\r\nFootnote 729:\r\n\r\n  See on the subject of scent, Sport.

Homer, in a few picturesque words, describes the war carried on\r\nagainst puss by this destructive bird.[737] On the islands, whether\r\ninhabited or not, few of these obstacles to their increase existed.\r\nSportsmen rarely passed over to them, and in such as were sacred to\r\nany of the gods the introduction of dogs was not permitted, so that,\r\nlike the pigeons and turtle-doves of Mekka, they multiplied in those\r\nholy haunts prodigiously.\r\n\r\nFootnote 737:\r\n\r\n  Il. χ. 308. sqq.\r\n\r\nIt was prohibited by the laws of Attica[738] to commit the slightest\r\ntrespass during the chase. The sportsman was not allowed to traverse\r\nany ground under cultivation, to disturb the course of running water,\r\nor to invade the sanctity of fountains. The scene of action\r\naccordingly lay among the woods and mountains, the common property of\r\nthe republic, or, if not, abandoned by general consent to the use of\r\nthe sportsman. Such were, for example, the woodland districts of\r\nParnes and Cithæron on the borders of Bœotia. Towards these the\r\nhuntsman, well shod, plainly and lightly dressed,[739] and with a\r\nstick in his hand, set out about sunrise in winter, in summer before\r\nday.[740] On the road strict silence was observed[741] lest the hare\r\nshould take the alarm and to her heels. Having reached the cover, the\r\ndogs were tied separately that they might be let slip the more easily,\r\nthe nets were spread in the proper places, the net-guards set, and the\r\nhuntsman with his dogs proceeded to start the game, first piously\r\nmaking a votive offering of the primitiæ to Apollo and Artemis,[742]\r\ndivinities of the chase.[743]\r\n\r\nFootnote 738:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

When he heareth the chirping of small birds\r\n  perched upon their dewy boughs, when he draws in that fragrancy of\r\n  the pastures and coolness of the air! How jolly is his spirit when\r\n  he suffers it to be imported with the noise of bugle-horns and the\r\n  baying of hounds which leap up and play around him!\"—Pref. to Tr. of\r\n  Gratius, p. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 741:\r\n\r\n  See, in the Cyropædia, i. 6. 40, an extremely interesting passage on\r\n  the chase of the hare.—Cf.

Drawing near the game they indicate the fact to their master by\r\ntheir movements, kindling up into a warlike humour, bounding emulously\r\nforward, scorning all thought of fatigue,—now in a body, now\r\nsingly,—till reaching the hiding-place[745] of the hare they spring\r\ntowards it all at once. In the midst of shouts and barking the swift\r\nanimal glances from her form with the hounds at her heels.

Those\r\nislands, it is said, were almost entirely exempted from vermin, but,\r\non the other hand, contained prodigious numbers of rabbits, which\r\nalmost destroyed every herb and plant by biting their roots. At\r\nlength, however, they discovered a remedy for this evil. They imported\r\nferrets from Africa, which, having first muzzled them, they let loose\r\nin the rabbit-warrens. Creeping into the holes they scared forth the\r\ninmates, which were caught by the sportsman. Strabo, who relates the\r\ncircumstance, calls the ferret a “wild cat.” Pliny, having likewise\r\ndescribed the devastations of the rabbits, speaks of it under the name\r\nof _viverra_, and says it was held in great estimation for its utility\r\nin this chase, which in the seventeenth century was practised in the\r\nisland of Procida, where they procured the animal from Sicily, and\r\ndenominated it Foretta, whence the English name. The common Italian\r\nappellation was donnola.[747]\r\n\r\nFootnote 747:\r\n\r\n  Vict. Var. Lect. xxxi. 20. p. 883. seq. Cf. Plin. Hist. Nat. viii.\r\n  8, cum notis. Strab. iii. 2. p. 231.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that in classic times the ferret was unknown in\r\nGreece, otherwise we should never have heard of the proverb of the\r\nCarpathian and his Hare[748] applied to persons who brought evil upon\r\nthemselves. Originally, we are told, the Island of Carpathos[749] was,\r\nlike Ithaca, entirely destitute of hares; but a pair having been at\r\nlength introduced, multiplied so prodigiously that they almost\r\ndepopulated the island by devouring the fruits of the earth. A similar\r\nfact is related of the island Porto Santo, near Madeira, for Prince\r\nHenry of Portugal, immediately after its discovery, “sent Bartholomew\r\nPerestrello with seeds to sow and cattle to stock the place; but one\r\ncouple of rabbits put in among the rest increased so prodigiously that\r\nall corn and plants being destroyed by them it was found necessary to\r\nunpeople the place.”[750]\r\n\r\nFootnote 748:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v.

Coll. of Voy. and Trav. vol. i.\r\n  p. xx.\r\n\r\nA peculiar kind of hare is commemorated by the ancients as found in\r\nElymœa. It is said to have been little inferior in size to the fox, to\r\nhave been elongated and slender in shape, and blackish in colour, with\r\na long white tip at the end of the tail. It is remarked by the same\r\nwriter that the scent left by leverets on the ground is stronger and\r\nmore pungent than that of the grown hare, so that the dogs become\r\nfurious on getting wind of it.[751]\r\n\r\nFootnote 751:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 74.\r\n\r\nFrom the chase of the hare and rabbit we pass on to that of the fawn\r\nand the stag, in which they made use of Indian dogs,[752] animals of\r\ngreat strength, size, speed, and courage. Fawns[753] were hunted in\r\nspring, the season of their birth. The first step was for the\r\nsportsman to beat up the woods to discover where the deer were\r\nnumerous; and having found a proper place he returned thither before\r\nday, armed with javelins, and accompanied by a game-keeper with a pack\r\nof hounds. The dogs were kept in leash afar off, lest they should give\r\ntongue at the sight of the deer. He himself took his station on the\r\nlook-out. At break of day[754] the does, with their yellowish and\r\nrichly-speckled skins, were seen issuing from the thickets, followed\r\nby their still more delicately-spotted fawns, which they led to the\r\nplaces[755] where they usually suckled them, while the stags stationed\r\nthemselves at a distance, as an advanced guard, to defend them from\r\nall intruders. The graceful creatures then lay down to perform their\r\nmatronly office, looking round watchfully the while to observe whether\r\nthey were discovered. This pleasing task completed, they, like the\r\nstags, posted themselves in a circle about their fawns to protect\r\nthem. Sportsmen have no sentiment. At the very moment when this most\r\nbeautiful exhibition of mute affection would have warmed with sympathy\r\nthe heart of the philosopher or the poet, the dogs were let loose,\r\nwhile their master and his companions, armed with javelins, closed\r\nupon the game. The fawn itself, unless chilled and drenched by the\r\ndew—in which case it frisked about—would remain still in its place and\r\nbe taken. But on hearing its cries the doe rushed forward to deliver\r\nit, and was smitten down by the javelins or torn to pieces by the\r\ndogs. The chase of the female elephant in Africa exhibits the same\r\ntraits of affection in the brute and ferocity in man. In this case the\r\nyoung will fight for his mother, or the mother for her young till\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFootnote 752:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

Cyneg. ix. § 1.\r\n\r\nWhen the fawn had attained any considerable size, and begun to feed\r\namong the herd, the chase of it became more arduous. The fidelity of\r\ninstinctive love, opposed to human sagacity, exhibited all its force.\r\nClosing round their young and drawing up in front of them, the stags,\r\nemboldened by affection, trampled the dogs under their feet,\r\nfrequently to death, unless the huntsman, dashing into the midst of\r\nthem, could succeed in detaching a single animal from the herd. But,\r\nsupposing this done, the hounds at first remained far behind the fawn,\r\nwhich, terrified at finding itself alone, bounded along with\r\nincredible velocity, though, its strength soon failing, it in the end\r\nfell a prey to the hunter.\r\n\r\nThe object of the ancients, however, in the chase not being simple\r\nsport, but to obtain possession by the shortest method possible of the\r\ngame, they set snares in the narrows of the mountains, around the\r\nmeadows, near the streams and freshes, and in the thickets—wherever,\r\nin short, stags could be taken. Pitfalls, too, were dug, as in Africa\r\nfor the lion,[756] and most of those stratagems resorted to which the\r\nNubians and Egyptian Arabs put in practice against the gazelle. It was\r\nin fact common to erect, with rough stones or wood, a sort of skreen,\r\nperhaps semicircular, like those behind which the hunters of the\r\ndesert hide, to conceal themselves when lying in wait for the\r\ngame.[757]\r\n\r\nFootnote 756:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Cyneg. ix. 14. sqq.—Ælian describes another method of taking\r\n  these animals not much practised by modern sportsmen; that is to say\r\n  by the charms of music, as the Egyptian Psylli captured serpents.—De\r\n  Nat. Anim. xii. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 757:\r\n\r\n  Poll. v. 36.\r\n\r\nFor the chase of the wild boar,[758] at once a manly and a useful\r\nsport, somewhat complicated preparations were necessary. In this the\r\ndogs of India, of Crete, of Locris, of Sparta, hunted side by side,\r\nand the sportsman took the field armed with strong nets, javelins,\r\nhunting poles, and snares. The boar-spears of the ancients[759] were\r\nmost carefully fashioned, with a broad sharp head and handle of tough\r\nwood. So likewise were their hunting-poles armed with long iron\r\npoints, fixed in brazen sockets, with a shaft of service wood.\r\nFootsnares of great strength were set at intervals. This was not the\r\nsport of a solitary hunter. They went out in considerable numbers, and\r\nkept close together, finding still, for lack of fire-arms, no small\r\ndifficulty in coping with the foe. On reaching the spot where they\r\nsupposed the hog to be ensconced, the dogs were all led carefully in\r\nleash with the exception of one Spartan hound, which was let loose and\r\naccompanied in all his movements. When he appeared to have found the\r\ntrack, they followed him, and he thus took the lead in the chase.\r\nNumerous signs also directed the movements of the hunter; in soft\r\nplaces the track, broken branches in thickets, and in forests the\r\nwounds on the bark of trees, given by the boar in sharpening his tusks\r\nas he passed.[760]\r\n\r\nFootnote 758:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Aristoph. Vesp. i. 202. seq. Xen. Cyrop. i. 6. 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 759:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Cyneg. x. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 760:\r\n\r\n  The huntsmen give judgment of the wild boar by the print of his\r\n  foot, by his rooting; a wild swine roots deeper than our ordinary\r\n  hogs, because its snout is longer, and when he comes into a\r\n  corn-field, as the Calydonian boar in Ovid, turns up one continued\r\n  furrow, &c.—Wase, Illustrations, V. p. 64.\r\n\r\nGenerally the traces were found leading to some sheltered nook, warm\r\nin winter, in summer cool, where the boar made his lair. On\r\ndiscovering him the dog gave tongue, but the animal in general refused\r\nto rise. The hound was then withdrawn and put in leash with the\r\nothers, and every opening, save one, leading to the place, closed with\r\nnets, the upper ends of which were passed over the forks of trees. The\r\nnets were hung so as to belly outwards, and carefully disposed so that\r\nthey could be seen through. Bushes cut hastily supported them on\r\neither side, and closed every aperture through which the game could\r\nattempt to force a way. This done the hounds were all slipped, and the\r\nhunters, armed with pikes and spears, entered the netted enclosure.\r\nOne of the boldest and most experienced led the dogs; the others\r\nfollowed at intervals, leaving an ample space between them for the\r\nboar, which if closely hemmed in might have inflicted on his opponents\r\nthe fate of Adonis. Presently the hounds sprang all at once upon the\r\ngame, which rising in sudden alarm tossed the first it encountered\r\ninto the air, and breaking through the pack made away towards the\r\nnets, followed by men and dogs in full cry. On finding the\r\nunaccustomed opposition, he would, if running down hill, plunge right\r\nforward to force his way through; if in a plain he would stand still,\r\nglaring fiercely around.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, however, soon closed upon his track, while the hunters\r\ngalled him with javelins and stones, approaching closer and closer\r\ntill he was driven by his own impetuosity into the nets. Upon this the\r\nmost daring of his pursuers drew near, pike in hand, and sought to put\r\nan end to the contest by piercing him in the head. Sometimes,\r\nnotwithstanding all they could do, instead of plunging into the toils\r\nhe would turn upon them; in which case some dexterous sportsman, armed\r\nwith spear or pike, usually presented himself to receive his charge\r\nwith one foot advanced, impelling the weapon with the right hand,\r\ndirecting it with the left. Instead, however, of rushing on at once\r\nthe hog would perhaps pause a moment to reconnoitre, when it behoved\r\nhis antagonist carefully to mark every movement of his head or glance\r\nof his eye.[761] For in the very moment that a blow was aimed at him,\r\nhe would sometimes dash the spear aside with tusk or snout, and the\r\nnext moment be upon his enemy, whose only chance of safety now\r\nconsisted in throwing himself instantaneously on his face, and holding\r\nfast by whatever he could grasp, since, the tusks of the boar curving\r\nupwards, he found it difficult to gore his enemy thus lying, and\r\nfailing to turn him over would in his fury trample on him. A second\r\nhunter now rushed forward to deliver his companion, and usually drew\r\noff the hog by dexterous attacks in flank. The fallen sportsman,\r\nrecovering at the same time his feet and his spear, must by the laws\r\nof the chase return to the combat, and could only secure his\r\nreputation by immolating his foe. By this time, indeed, the task had\r\ngenerally become easier; for, rendered reckless by fury, he would\r\nthrow himself impetuously on their pikes, which, but for the\r\nprotecting guards at the head, would have gone through him handle and\r\nall. His whole frame now appeared to be kindled with rage, his blood\r\nboiling, his eyes flashing, and his tusks so nearly on fire that if\r\nbrought in contact with hair at the moment of death, they would\r\nfrizzle it like a red-hot iron.[762]\r\n\r\nFootnote 761:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Poll. v. 23. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 762:\r\n\r\n  Οὕτω δὲ πολλὴ ἡ δυναμίς ἐστιν αὐτοῦ, ὥστε καὶ, ἃ οὐκ ἂν οἴοιτό τις,\r\n  πρόσεστιν αὐτῷ· τεθνεῶτος γὰρ εὐθὺς ἐάν τις ἐπὶ τὸν ὀδόντα ἐπιθῇ\r\n  τρίχας, συντρέχουσιν· οὑτως εἰσὶ θερμοὶ· ζῶντι δὲ διάπυροι, ὅταν\r\n  ἐρεθίζηται· οὐ γὰρ ἂν τῶν κυνῶν, ἁμαρτάνων τῇ πληγῄ τοῦ σώματος,\r\n  ἄκρα τὰ τριχώματα περιεπίμπρα.—Xen.

As this animal abounded, however, in most parts of\r\nGreece, where it was extremely troublesome and destructive,\r\nparticularly to the fruit-trees, various expedients were hit upon for\r\ntaking and destroying it. Sometimes it was pursued as game and brought\r\ndown by the bow; but the common method appears to have been to make\r\nuse of traps and snares. They dug, for example, a deep trench round\r\none of those trees in the fruit of which the bear particularly\r\ndelighted, and covering it with reeds or brittle branches, they\r\nsprinkled thereon a thin layer of earth, and concealed the whole\r\napparatus with fresh grass. The bear, proceeding as usual towards the\r\ntree on his thievish errand, broke in the roof of the pit with his\r\nweight, and was caught. Even in the most civilised times this animal\r\nhad not been wholly extirpated from Attica,[764] but, as well as the\r\nboar, was found on Mount Parnes. In Laconia also, through the whole\r\nrange of Taygetos, it abounded, together with hogs, deer, and wild\r\ngoats. Bruin was sacrificed in Achaia to Artemis Laphria. In Thrace\r\nthe white bear was found.[765]\r\n\r\nFootnote 763:\r\n\r\n  Pausanias mentions the bear as an inhabitant of Pendeli. “About\r\n  three years since one was shot in the mountains of Parnassos, and\r\n  brought to Aracooa. The lynx, the wild cat, the wild boar, the wild\r\n  goat, the stag, the roebuck, the badger, the martin, and squirrel\r\n  inhabit the steeper rocks of Parnassos, and the thick pine forests\r\n  above Callidia. The rough mountains about Marathon are frequented by\r\n  moles, foxes, and jackals; weasels are sometimes taken in the\r\n  villages and out-houses; hares are too numerous to be\r\n  particularised.” Sibthorp in Walp. Mem. i. 73.\r\n\r\nFootnote 764:\r\n\r\n  Paus. i. 32. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 765:\r\n\r\n  Paus. iii. 20. 4. vii. 18. 13. viii. 17. 3.\r\n\r\nRespecting the habits of the Grecian bear the ancients have left us\r\nsome few facts which may be worth repeating. When it comes forth from\r\nthe den,[766] where it has passed the winter, it is said to chew bits\r\nof wood, and to feed on snake-weed, wake-robin, or cuckoo-pint (arum\r\nmaculatum[767]), which has a purgative power. These operations\r\nperformed, its ravenous appetites immediately awake, and it commences\r\nits devastations in the farm-yard, the orchard and the apiary.\r\nDelighting greatly in honey it attacks and overthrows the hives which\r\nit tears to pieces in order to devour the combs, though Pliny[768]\r\nadduces another reason for this fact, exceedingly characteristic of\r\nthat writer. He says that the bear, after his winter sleep, finding\r\nhis eyes dim and his head heavy, applies to the bees as to skilful\r\noculists, that in revenge for robbing them of their honey, sting him\r\nangrily about the face, which by letting much blood relieves him at\r\nonce from his ophthalmia and his headache. The bear, it is well known,\r\nis omnivorous like man. He accordingly plunders the bean-fields, and\r\nfeeds on every kind of pulse. In robbing orchards,[769] too, his\r\ncourage and ability are great, being as I have said as complete an\r\nadept as a school-boy in climbing trees, out of which when he has\r\nsatisfied himself he descends, like the aforesaid mischievous beast,\r\nfeet foremost. When none of the delicacies above enumerated was within\r\nhis reach, the bear would feed on ants, crabs, or any kind of vermin,\r\nbut preferred of course the flesh of the larger animals, such as the\r\nstag, the wild boar, and the bull. His mode of taking his prey was\r\ncurious. Upon the boar and stag he probably dropped from his hiding\r\nplace in the trees, but the stratagem by which he usually got the bull\r\ninto his power was this.[770] Throwing himself on the ground directly\r\nin his way he provoked the lord of the herd to gore him, upon which,\r\nseizing his horns, and fastening ravenously upon his shoulder, he\r\nbrought him to the ground, where he fed upon his carcass at leisure.\r\nWhen flying from the more terrible face of man, the female usually\r\ndrove her young before her, or taking them up in her mouth or on her\r\nback, she would endeavour to escape with them into the trees.[771]\r\n\r\nFootnote 766:\r\n\r\n  Aristot.

In all those countries, however, both the lion,[773]\r\nthe panther, the pard, the lynx, and other animals of this destructive\r\nclass had been confined to the mountains, where, as an acute and\r\nexperienced observer has remarked, they lose much of their force and\r\nferocity. The expression made use of by Xenophon proves in fact that\r\nthe dread of man had driven them almost into inaccessible fastnesses,\r\nwhither they could not be pursued by the hunter, so that they were\r\nchiefly taken in their descent to the lowlands by poisoning, with\r\naconite,[774] the waters or the baits which they set for them:\r\nsometimes, indeed, when want compelled them into the plains, parties\r\nof hunters on horseback, and armed to the teeth, would assault and\r\ndestroy them, not without imminent peril. Pitfalls, too, of ingenious\r\nconstruction were dug for them, having an earthen pillar in the centre\r\non which a goat was tied.[775] The encircling moat, like that above\r\ndescribed, destined for the bear, was concealed by a covering of\r\nslender bushes which, breaking under them, they were precipitated to\r\nthe bottom and there killed. The wolf, though a sacred animal[776] in\r\nAttica, had by the laws a price set upon his head, at which\r\nMenage[777] wonders, though the Egyptians also slaughtered their\r\nsacred crocodiles, when they exceeded a certain size.\r\n\r\nFootnote 772:\r\n\r\n  Xen.

Thus during the campaigns of Alexander in Asia,\r\nwe find the generals Leonatos and Menelaos or Philotas[781] carrying\r\nabout among their baggage, linen skreens, ten or twelve miles in\r\nlength, which during their halts they caused to be stretched round a\r\ngiven district, where they hunted as in a park. An anecdote is related\r\nstrikingly illustrating the high estimation in which the chase was\r\nheld at the court and among the nobles of Macedonia, where it was\r\ncustomary for the son to sit upright on a chair at his father’s table\r\nand not to recline among the guests until he had slain a wild boar out\r\nof the toils. Cassander, son of Antipater, continued, it is said,[782]\r\nup to his thirty-fifth year bolt upright at the regal board, because,\r\nthough a brave man and a skilful hunter, fortune had constantly denied\r\nhim the pleasure of despatching the hog after the prescribed fashion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 781:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xii. 55. Plut. Alex. § 40. See in Wase’s Illustrations, p.\r\n  68. an account of the Polish royal hunts in which, on a smaller\r\n  scale, the same practice prevailed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 782:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 31.\r\n\r\nThere is one department of the chase, and that perhaps the most\r\ncurious and interesting, which was not practised by the Greeks of\r\nclassical times, though it cannot be said to have been unknown to\r\nthem; I mean falconry, described by several ancient writers as it was\r\npursued in India and in Thrace. If I give a short description of it,\r\ntherefore, it must be regarded as a digression introduced for the\r\npurpose of completing, as far as possible, the circle of ancient\r\namusements. Ctesias,[783] who was contemporary with Socrates, and\r\npublished his Indian history four hundred years before Christ, seems\r\nto be the oldest writer by whom falconry is mentioned. He tells us\r\nthat among the Hindùs hares and foxes were hunted with kites, ravens,\r\nand eagles, and minutely describes the way in which the birds were\r\nbroken in. Having been caught while young, they were first taught to\r\nfly at tame hares and foxes in the following manner. The animals with\r\npieces of flesh tied to them were started in sight of the falcons,\r\nwhich were immediately let loose and sent in pursuit. When they caught\r\nand brought back the game the flesh was given them as their reward,\r\nand by this bait and allurement they were encouraged to persevere.\r\nWhen sufficiently trained, they were taken to the mountains and flown\r\nagainst wild hares and foxes. The passion for falconry is still kept\r\nalive in the East, particularly in Persia, where the shâh-baz, or\r\nroyal falcon, is flown against hares and antelopes, occasionally\r\ninvested with leathers, which protect him from being torn\r\nasunder.[784] But the most daring and dangerous service in which\r\nfalcons have ever been employed is the chase of the wild horse by the\r\nTurcomâns of Khiva on the eastern shores of the Caspian.[785] A more\r\ndetailed description of ancient falconry than that given by Ctesias is\r\nfound in a work attributed to Aristotle.[786] It is said, observes\r\nthis writer, that the youth of Thrace, who were addicted to hunting,\r\npursued their game by the assistance of hawks. On arriving upon the\r\nground, the falcon, which had evidently been trained for the purpose,\r\nobeyed the calls of the sportsmen and chased the birds into the\r\nthickets, where they were knocked down with hunting-poles and taken.\r\nEven when the falcons themselves captured the game, they brought it to\r\nthe hunters, who as in modern times gave them, as a reward, some\r\nportion of the animal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 783:\r\n\r\n  Ap.

The male bird\r\nhaving been tamed was put out in the neighbourhood of a covey, upon\r\nwhich the boldest of the wild birds came forward to fight him, and was\r\nsecured with the net. The challenge was usually accepted by every male\r\nbird in the covey until one after another they were all taken. When\r\nthe female was employed she drew them successively to the nets by her\r\ncall.[788] The first that is deluded is generally the principal cock\r\nin the covey, which the others collecting together seek to drive away.\r\nTo elude their pursuit the leader sometimes drew near the decoy in\r\nsilence, that he might not have to contend with the other males. Not\r\nunfrequently they would descend and allow themselves at such times to\r\nbe caught on the roofs of the houses.[789]\r\n\r\nFootnote 787:\r\n\r\n  Arist. Hist. Anim. ix. 8. Xenoph.

The sophist of Naucratis has indeed been\r\nsuspected of confounding the ὠτὸς with the ὠτὶς, that is, the owl with\r\nthe bustard;[790] but it having been in his power to examine what he\r\nrelates, I shall lay his account before the reader, who will judge for\r\nhimself. This bird, it is said, is found in great numbers in the\r\ndesert near Alexandria, (though I myself saw none there,) and is as\r\nmuch given to mimicry as a monkey. Above all things he is ambitious of\r\nimitating man, and, as far as possible, will do whatever he sees done\r\nby the fowler. Aware of his propensity in this way, these gentlemen,\r\nwhen desirous of taking an owl, carried along with them into the\r\ndesert a thick tenacious glue, with which on coming within eyeshot of\r\nthe Otos they affected to anoint their eyes. Then laying down the\r\nglue-pot on the sand they retreated to some hollow for concealment.\r\nUpon this the owl having watchfully observed their movements,\r\napproached, and covering his eyes with the treacherous ointment was\r\nblinded and taken.\r\n\r\nFootnote 790:\r\n\r\n  Alexand. Myndius calls it the λαγωδίας in which case it may probably\r\n  mean the _Ptarmigan_.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of catching this bird also prevailed. It having been\r\ndiscovered that he was as partial as the Bedouin Arab to the company\r\nof a horse, the fowlers covered themselves with horses’ skins, and in\r\nthis disguise approaching the flock were enabled to catch as many as\r\nthey pleased. A third method of taking the Otos was one which exposed\r\nthe unfortunate bird to the ridicule of the comic poets. The fowlers\r\nsetting out upon the chase in pairs, separated at coming in sight of\r\nthe game. One of the two then stepped out in front of the game and\r\ncommenced a jig, upon which the thoughtless mimic immediately did the\r\nsame, beating exact time with his feet, and keeping his eye fixed upon\r\nhis wily teacher. While the merry victim was thus engaged, capering,\r\nspringing, and pirouetting like a feathered Taglioni, the other\r\nbird-catcher approached from behind and seized him by the neck.\r\n\r\nThe same story is related by other writers of the Scops or\r\nmocking-owl, in imitation of whose movements, the ancients had a\r\ncelebrated dance.[791]\r\n\r\nFootnote 791:\r\n\r\n  Athen. ix. 44. seq.

Anim. viii. 12 ad fin.\r\n\r\nQuails in certain seasons of the year frequent Greece in vast numbers,\r\nas they do Egypt and Southern Italy.[792] It has been supposed that\r\nthe island of Delos received the name of Ortygia from the quails\r\n(ὄρτυγες), which alighted on it in great numbers during their\r\nmigration towards the north. They were likewise plentiful in\r\nPhœnicia,[793] where they sacrificed them to Heracles. Numerous\r\ncontrivances were resorted to for catching this bird. During pairing\r\ntime it was taken as follows: mirrors were set up in the fields with\r\nsnares in front of them, and the quail running towards the imaginary\r\nbird was there entrapped. Clearchos of Soli describes a curious mode\r\nof capturing jackdaws. In places frequented by those birds they used,\r\nhe says, to lay broad vessels filled to the brim with oil. Presently\r\nthe jackdaws, curious and prying in their temper, would alight on the\r\nedges, and, being vastly pleased with the reflection of their own\r\nbeauty, would chuckle over it and clap their wings, till becoming\r\nsaturated with oil the feathers stuck together and they could no\r\nlonger fly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 792:\r\n\r\n  They are taken in so great numbers in the island of Capri that they\r\n  constitute the chief source of revenue to the bishop of that island.\r\n\r\nFootnote 793:\r\n\r\n  Phanodem. l. iii. ap.

We shall thus have traversed the whole circle\r\nof Hellenic education, when we shall have exhibited the youth passing\r\nthrough the schools of the philosophers and sophists into the\r\nworld.[794]\r\n\r\nFootnote 794:\r\n\r\n  Cf. M. Ant. Muret. Orat. vii. p. 70. sqq.\r\n\r\nTheir mode of teaching differed very materially from ours. It scarcely\r\nseemed an object with them to devour large quantities of learning, but\r\ngoing leisurely again and again over the same ground they appeared to\r\ngive the lessons they received time to sink like gentle rain into\r\ntheir minds. Some advantage, too, arose from their method of teaching,\r\nas far as possible, orally. The master was to them instead of a\r\nlibrary. A book has but one set of phrases for all. But the living\r\nteacher, if he found his pupils could not rise to his language, could\r\nlower it to meet them half-way, could be brief or expansive, or\r\ngeneral or minute, as the necessities of the moment required. There\r\nwas a familiarity, too, in the relation, scarcely compatible with our\r\nmanners. The youth forgot he was learning, and rather supposed himself\r\nto be searching in the company of a friend for truths equally unknown\r\nto both. This appears to have been more particularly the case in their\r\nmoral studies,[795] at least in the Socratic schools, where all the\r\npomp of wisdom was laid aside that it might be the more popular.\r\n\r\nFootnote 795:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Ant. Muret. Orat. iv. 43. sqq.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that the first lessons in morals were\r\nlearned from the poets, whom, in my opinion, Plato wrongs most\r\negregiously when he arraigns their fables as so many sources of\r\nimmorality.[796] He appears, in fact, wilfully to confound them with\r\nthose impostors, the purificators and diviners, who furnished the\r\nPopes with the original hint of penitences and indulgencies, and\r\nexpiating crimes by proxy. But this is unjust. It is visiting the sins\r\nof low and sensual versifiers upon the divine heads of bards whom\r\nheaven itself had inspired. However this may be, upon the Greeks young\r\nand old no teachers exercised so powerful an influence as the poets,\r\nwho, from Homer down to Callistratos,[797] whether in epic or\r\nafter-dinner song, wielded the empire of their feelings despotically,\r\nprompting them to actions pregnant with renown. And the avidity with\r\nwhich their lessons were imbibed, is compared to that of a swarm of\r\nbees alighting (ἐπιπτομένοι)[798] on a bed of spring flowers. In fact,\r\nwhat Jason of Pheræ said of himself,—that he was devoured by the love\r\nof empire[799]—appears to have been true of the Athenian youth, in\r\ntheir irrepressible thirst after knowledge. Such of them, at least, as\r\nwere εὐφυεῖς καὶ ἱκανοὶ, are said to have hungered fiercely after\r\nphilosophy, and that not for any particular part but for the whole.\r\nAnd Socrates declares that he who while young is fastidious in his\r\nstudies, rejecting this, disliking that, before mature reason has\r\ntaught him which is useful and which is not, may consider himself what\r\nhe pleases, but can never be great in learning or philosophy. To excel\r\nin these it is necessary insatiably to covet every kind of\r\ninstruction, and joyfully to enter on the acquisition of it. He says,\r\nindeed, that they resemble sight-seers, greedy of every spectacle; or\r\nmusical people, who are led by the ear wherever fiddling and singing\r\nare going forward; except that, with the latter pleasure is the sole\r\nmotive, with the former an exalted passion for truth.[800] But what\r\ntruths are the object of philosophy? Those which have regard to the\r\nnature and attributes of goodness, from which, as from a fountain,\r\nflow all the usefulness and advantages of virtue. Philosophy in Greece\r\ncomprehended religion, and to be religious was to act justly,\r\nbenevolently, mercifully towards men, humbly and piously towards God.\r\nTo live thus, that is, to be virtuous, they considered it necessary to\r\npossess a knowledge of the whole theory of ethics, since virtue, in\r\ntheir opinion, is incompatible with ignorance. But man, besides being\r\na moral being, accountable to God, is a political being, accountable\r\nto the laws of his country. He has duties also to perform towards that\r\ncountry. To perform these properly he must comprehend the nature of a\r\nstate, and the relations subsisting between the state and the\r\nindividuals who compose it; that is, he must be acquainted with the\r\nscience of politics. Again in all free states, reasoning and\r\npersuasion, not blind will and brute force, are the instruments of\r\ngovernment. The citizen must, therefore, be versed in logic and\r\neloquence,[801] that he may think correctly and explain clearly and\r\nforcibly to others the convictions which determine his own judgment.\r\nWe have thus a cycle of Greek studies with the reasons on which they\r\nwere founded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 796:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. ii. t. i. p. 112. sqq.

Bekk.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their religious education, which commenced in the\r\nnursery and was interwoven with every other study, it may be observed\r\nthat without it no person at Athens could rise to any eminence, or\r\ncommand, even in private life, the respect of his fellow-citizens. To\r\nbe in favour with them a man must be supposed to stand well with the\r\ngods. They conceived, in fact, that while conscience remained\r\nunstifled, there would be a sense of religion, and that when this\r\nwent, probity, for the most part, and honour fled along with it. For\r\nregarding the deity in the light of a parent,—\"we are all his\r\noffspring,\"—irreligion appeared to them something like a disposition\r\nto parricide, a compound of injustice with the basest and most\r\natrocious ingratitude. Arrived at this pitch, a man to compass his\r\nends would scruple at nothing. They, therefore, regarded every symptom\r\nof impiety as a blow aimed at the democracy, of which Zeus was king.\r\nHe who tramples on his country’s religion, which is the basis of all\r\nits laws, will infallibly, if it be in his power, trample next on\r\nthose laws themselves, and next on his fellow-citizens whom the laws\r\nprotect. Hence the terror, the vengeance, and, indeed, the cruelty\r\narising out of the mutilation of the Hermæ, and the profanation of the\r\nmysteries, and the prosecution which followed, of Alcibiades,\r\nAndocides, and the rest. An attempt had been made to break down that\r\nenclosure of reverential sanctity which surrounded the commonwealth,\r\nand commended it to the protection of heaven. They considered the act\r\na formal renouncing of the Almighty, and feared,—so imperfect were\r\ntheir notions,—lest the impiety of the few should redound to the\r\ndetriment of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe remark is common in the mouths[802] of men that the education of\r\nthe people should be conformable to the spirit of their institutions.\r\nBut this is a mere truism, and means no more than this,—that men\r\nshould not be enjoined one thing by their laws and political\r\nconstitution, and another by the habits and maxims taught in youth.\r\nThe grand difficulty, however, always has been to make them so to\r\nharmonise in practice that they should be but two parts of the same\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFootnote 802:\r\n\r\n  See on this part of the subject Destutt de Tracy. Com. sur l’Esprit\r\n  des Loix, p. 25. sqq.\r\n\r\nIn monarchies[803] a spirit of exclusion, something like that on which\r\nthe system of castes is built, must pervade the whole business of\r\neducation. The nobility must have schools to themselves, or, if\r\nwealthy plebeians be suffered to mingle with them, superior honour and\r\nconsideration must be yielded to the former. The masters must look up\r\nto them and to their families, not to the people for preferment and\r\nadvancement; and the plebeians, though superior in number, must be\r\nweak in influence, and be taught to borrow their tone from the\r\nprivileged students.\r\n\r\nFootnote 803:\r\n\r\n  In an ill-constituted state, observes Muretus, a good man cannot be\r\n  a good citizen, for he will desire to alter the government, which\r\n  being bad he cannot respect.—In Aristot. Eth. p. 398.\r\n\r\nIn an oligarchy, properly so called, there should be no mingling of\r\nthe classes at all. Schools must be established expressly for the\r\ngovernors, and others for the governed. The basis of education should\r\nbe the notion that some men were born for rule and others for\r\nsubjection; that the happiness of individuals depends on uninquiring\r\nsubmission to authority; that their rulers are wise and they unwise;\r\nthat all they have to do with the laws is to obey them; and all\r\nteachers must be made to feel that their admission among the great\r\ndepends on the faithful advocacy of such notions.\r\n\r\nIn free states, again, the contrary course will best promote the ends\r\nof government; the schools must be strictly public, and not merely\r\ntheoretically but practically open to all. There should be no\r\ncompulsion to attend them, but ignorance of the things there taught\r\nshould involve a forfeiture of civil rights as much as being of\r\nunsound mind; for in truth, an ignorant man is not of sound mind, any\r\nmore than one unable to use all his limbs is of sound body. Here the\r\ndiscipline must be very severe. A spirit rigidly puritanical must\r\npervade the studies and preside over the amusements. Every tendency\r\nirreligious, immoral, ungentlemanly, as unworthy the dignity of\r\nfreedom, should be nipped in the bud. The students must be taught to\r\ndespise all other distinctions but those of virtue and genius, in\r\nother words the power to serve the community. They should be taught to\r\ncontemplate humanity as in other respects wholly on the same level,\r\nwith nothing above it but the laws. The teachers must be dependent on\r\nthe people alone, and owe their success to their own abilities and\r\npopular manners. And this last in a great measure was the spirit of\r\nAthenian education.[804]\r\n\r\nFootnote 804:\r\n\r\n  The advantages of which were so much coveted by foreigners, that\r\n  they sent their children in crowds to be educated at Athens.—Æsch.\r\n  Epist. Orat. Att. xii. 214.\r\n\r\nThe best proof[805] that could be furnished of the excellence of a\r\nsystem of education would be its rendering a people almost independent\r\nof government, that is swayed more by their habits than by the laws.\r\nThis was preëminently the case with the Athenians. They required to be\r\nvery little meddled with by their rulers. Instructed in their duties\r\nand the reason which rendered them duties, accustomed from childhood\r\nto perform them, they lived as moral and educated men live still,\r\nindependent of the laws.\r\n\r\nFootnote 805:\r\n\r\n  A commonwealth, says Plato, once well constituted will proceed like\r\n  an ever rolling circle. For by persevering in good training and\r\n  instruction, the minds and disposition of the people will be\r\n  rendered good, and these again in their turn will improve the system\r\n  of training and instruction, and even the race of man itself, as the\r\n  breed of other animals, is rendered more excellent by care.—De Rep.\r\n  t. vi. p. 173. Cf. Isocrates, Areop. § 14. seq.\r\n\r\nThis was the effect. The causes must be sought in their discipline and\r\nstudies. I have observed that among them a principal subject of\r\ninvestigation was the science of politics, that is the science\r\naccording to the principles of which states are framed and preserved.\r\nNor did they, as some do, conduct their studies in that cold manner in\r\nwhich men investigate matters of mere curiosity, or things they are\r\nnever to do more than converse or write about. They studied it as a\r\nprofession, as a means of rising to power, and through power to fame,\r\nthat is with all the ardour and earnestness of which enthusiastic\r\nyouth is capable. Education by this means exerted an influence unknown\r\nunder other forms of government. A consciousness that they were\r\nengaged in a sort of sacred contest, of which all Greece was\r\nspectator, pervaded the youth of every rank, and impelled them\r\nirresistibly into that course of studies which promised the greatest\r\nprobability of success. Hence, no doubt much of the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich philosophy was cultivated. It was often not so much the abstract\r\nlove of wisdom as a conviction of the political value of that wisdom\r\nwhich filled the schools of the great men who taught at Athens,\r\nwhether they were physiologists, mathematicians, masters of music, of\r\nstrategy, or of eloquence. The example of Pericles applying himself to\r\nnatural philosophy under Anaxagoras, and deriving thence those streams\r\nof pure and masculine eloquence which overflowed the Pnyx, operated\r\nforcibly on public opinion. By the same arts and studies men hoped to\r\nmount to equal elevation, forgetting that Anaxagoras only watered the\r\nplant spontaneously produced by nature.\r\n\r\nHowever, the hopes and aspirations I have described filled the schools\r\nfirst of the philosophers, then of the sophists. And this is the\r\nnatural course of things. Few pursue wisdom for its own sake, in order\r\nthat it may purify and render holy their own minds. And by this\r\ndispensation of Providence society is a gainer; for, as man is\r\nconstituted, no sooner does he possess any mental excellence, any\r\nknowledge or art or experience, which can be rendered available, than\r\nhe comes eagerly forward with it to extort praise or reward from the\r\ncommunity by conferring benefits upon it. The examples of reserve in\r\nthis matter are few, nor, in fact, are they to be commended who in\r\nthis or in any thing else hide their light under a bushel; and\r\ntherefore Plato is wrong when he teaches that wise men will as a rule\r\nabstain from intermeddling with state affairs, unless constrained\r\nthereto by fines and menaces. He confesses, indeed, that the worst of\r\nall punishments is to be governed by evil men, and that to avoid this\r\neven philosophers will consent to hold the reins of government.[806]\r\nBut where they do not, they are always in free states the masters of\r\nthose who do. Their schools were the colleges and universities of the\r\nancient world, and so long as freedom endured the great object of\r\ntheir philosophy was to create able citizens and a happy state. On\r\nthis account their remains are still instinct with life. Their object\r\nwas gradually to ripen human nature into perfection by perfecting its\r\neducation and its institutions. They knew how completely a people is\r\nin the power of its teachers for good or for evil, and accordingly,\r\nwith some few exceptions, applied themselves to elevate the\r\nconceptions, the moral tone, the feelings of their countrymen, seldom\r\ndescending to trifling disquisitions excepting for relaxation in the\r\nintervals of more important inquiries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 806:\r\n\r\n  Repub. i. t. vi. p. 42. seq. Bekk.\r\n\r\nThe physical sciences,[807] save in the case of their earliest\r\ncultivators, were regarded as simple handmaids to ethics and politics.\r\nNevertheless, in the study of them much earnestness was exhibited.\r\nFor, where knowledge is at all held in honour, men will always be\r\nfound sufficiently prone to the palpable and visible. But even these\r\npursuits assumed a peculiar form in Greece. The genius of the nation,\r\nessentially creative, developed its force and its peculiar energy in\r\nframing systems of physics, explaining the origin of the world, the\r\nbirth of the human race, its early fortunes and fabulous history.\r\nEvery great philosopher became, like an intellectual sun, the centre\r\nof a system of physics, and his disciples like satellites revolved\r\naround him, receiving and reflecting his light. This, despite of some\r\ninconveniences, was highly favourable to science. It compelled men to\r\nthe study of the philosophical art of attack and defence. Each school\r\nbecame the reviewers and critics of its rivals, sought out their weak\r\npoints, studied them profoundly, called up all its acuteness, all its\r\nsubtlety, both to assault others and defend itself; and thus, whatever\r\nbecame of the system, the professors of it carried, as far as might be\r\ntowards perfection, their intellectual powers, invested their\r\nreasonings with every grace of which they were susceptible, culled\r\nfrom the most recondite arts and hidden resources of style and\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 807:\r\n\r\n  Vid. Athen. ii. 18.—That geography entered but very little into\r\n  their studies may be inferred from Thucydides, vii. 1.\r\n\r\nBut, while this golden currency was circulating through Greece,\r\nenriching its mind and augmenting its chances of independence and\r\nhappiness, a race of men sprang up, who brought into use a number of\r\ningenious and beautiful counters,—I mean the sophists.[808] The\r\ninfluence of these men in the education of the Greeks has seldom been\r\ncorrectly appreciated. It has been more common to vituperate than to\r\nstudy them. They corrupted, we are told, the mind and manners of\r\nyouth. But how? No one, as far as I know, has observed that to them is\r\nto be traced the extinction of the republican spirit and the opening\r\nof a way for despotism.[809] That they created the yearning after\r\ninnovation I will not affirm; but their epoch constituted a period of\r\ntransition from republican to monarchical institutions, and the only\r\nway in which they can be said to have corrupted the youth was by\r\nundermining that love of liberty and of country, the feeling of\r\ndisinterestedness on which chiefly a commonwealth must be founded, and\r\ninculcating in lieu thereof a system of ethics more in conformity with\r\nthe modifications of civil polity prevalent in modern times. In this\r\nway only did they corrupt and undermine the morals of their country.\r\nBut in so far they effected it, and that the more easily, in that\r\ncircumstances conspired, about the time they arose, to fling the whole\r\nbusiness of teaching into their hands, insomuch that to be a sophist,\r\nand to teach youth, grew to be synonymous terms.[810]\r\n\r\nFootnote 808:\r\n\r\n  Vid.

It was soon discovered by shrewd and calculating\r\nmen, that since philosophy excited much admiration and rendered its\r\nteachers objects of mark and reverence, it might by a little ingenuity\r\nbe converted into a source of profit.[812] But by what means?—The\r\nphilosophers at the outset were in possession of the popular ear, more\r\nthrough the sanctity of their lives, of which all could judge, than\r\nthrough their doctrines, necessarily comprehended in their fullest\r\nextent by few. They despaired, therefore, of the people. There\r\nexisted, however, in Greece, and will ever exist in free states, young\r\nmen of immeasurable ambition, who, impatient of the restraint of laws,\r\nwould gladly cast them off, seize the reins of government, and become\r\nthe tyrants of their country. The mere conception of such a design\r\nimplies the possession of wealth and powerful friends. Eager for any\r\nhelp they enthusiastically welcomed all who seemed capable of\r\npromoting their views, and when the sophists appeared, enriched with a\r\nvariety of knowledge, specious, eloquent, unscrupulous, they eagerly\r\nthrew themselves into their arms, became their pupils, and in\r\nconjunction with them framed the subjugation of Greece.\r\n\r\nFootnote 811:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. t. vi. p. 286. seq. Cf. Schol. Aristoph. Nub. 331.\r\n\r\nFootnote 812:\r\n\r\n  That money was the sole object of the sophists is observed by\r\n  Isocrates, Hel. Encom. § 4.

Theat.\r\n  Rhet. v. iii. p. 447.\r\n\r\nIn tracing this class of men to their origin, we must look back a\r\ngreat way, and endeavour to detect them, under a variety of forms,\r\ndifferent from that in which they ultimately settled. They arose with\r\nthe first philosophers, or the first poet who made self the centre of\r\nhis researches, and sought to render the investigation of science a\r\nmeans of personal aggrandisement. Protagoras describes in Plato the\r\nrise of his own art; where, though a side blow be wrongfully aimed at\r\npoetry itself, the truth of the accusation against a number of poets\r\ncannot be denied. He makes good at the very outset what I have\r\nasserted above. They travelled, he says, over all Greece, alluring the\r\nnoblest youths to abandon the company of their friends and\r\nfellow-citizens, to become their pupils, and be guided wholly by their\r\nmaxims, the nature of which I shall presently unfold. The feelings\r\nthey thus excited, he denominates envy and malevolence, though in\r\ntruth it was nothing more than that patriotic and parental jealousy\r\nand hatred experienced by the good when they behold those they love\r\nled astray. The better to escape this hostility, the ancient sophists\r\nadopted various disguises, sometimes enveloping their art in the folds\r\nof poetry as Homer, Hesiod, and Simonides, on other occasions\r\naffecting to be the interpreters of foreign rites and oracles, as\r\nOrpheus and Musæus; while a third class concealed the features of\r\ntheir art under the less suspected mask of gymnastics, such as Iccos\r\nof Tarentum, and that Herodicos of Silymbria a man of Megarean origin\r\nwho in the art of sophistry was second to none of his age.\r\nOccasionally they made their entrance into cities as professors of\r\nmusic. In this capacity Damon conversed with Pericles, and Agathocles,\r\nan Athenian by birth, diffused through the state the seeds of\r\nsophistry; Pythocleides, too, the Coan, pursued the same course; and\r\nthus a youth, while ostensibly engaged in gaining a proficiency on the\r\nlyre or cithara, was initiated in the mysteries of tyranny, irreligion\r\nand injustice.[813]\r\n\r\nFootnote 813:\r\n\r\n  Plat.

Bekk.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, however, it was discovered that all disguise might be very\r\nsafely laid aside.[814] In fact the object at first aimed at,—to\r\nescape the notice of men in power,—was found impracticable; and as to\r\nthe people, against whom all these shafts were directed, it was easy\r\nto delude them, since what their leaders recommended they praised.\r\nProtagoras, accordingly, boldly professed himself a sophist, trusting\r\nfor safety to his eloquence, and that growing laxity of manners which\r\nwas rapidly undermining the old republican constitution and preparing\r\nthe way for a new order of things. His candour was praiseworthy, but\r\nlamentable were the circumstances which rendered it safe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 814:\r\n\r\n  At a late period, by a decree of Sophocles, the sophists were driven\r\n  out of Attica.—Athen. xiii. 92. Cf. Cressol. Theat. Rhet. i. 12. p.\r\n  87.\r\n\r\nI would not, however, be understood to share the opinions of those,\r\nwho can discern nothing but evil in the doctrines of the sophists. On\r\nmany points their notions harmonised altogether with those of the\r\nwisest philosophers. Accordingly it was not precisely what they\r\ninculcated, but the principles which regulated their teaching, that\r\nrendered them sophists. They taught with a view to enrich themselves,\r\nwhich is wholly incompatible with a strict allegiance to truth; since,\r\nwith such views, men will always be found to prophesy agreeably in\r\norder that they may effect their purpose.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance has not been sufficiently considered by the writers\r\nwho undertake their apology. They compare them with the literary men\r\nof modern times, and imagine this comparison a defence. But does it\r\nnot rather substantiate the accusation? It is true that, like modern\r\nliterary men, they haunted the houses of the great, whom they regarded\r\nas their patrons; that to them, rather than to the people, they looked\r\nfor support; that, like them, they worshipped wealth and abhorred\r\npoverty; that their studies, their discourses, their writings,\r\ndiffused far and wide through society a taste for arts and elegance;\r\nthat they furnished the public in their declamations, satires, novels,\r\nof which they were the inventors, with inexhaustible sources of\r\namusement:—but what virtue did they inculcate? On whom did they urge\r\nthe necessity of sacrificing private to public good? On what occasion\r\ndid they dare to stem the torrent of immorality, of impiety, of\r\nunpatriotic maxims, which the base and the selfish were pouring forth\r\nagainst the old bulwarks of freedom? That among them there were men of\r\na very high order of genius, it is impossible to deny. Gorgias of\r\nLeontium, from whose name we have borrowed an epithet to express\r\nwhatever is most glorious in nature or dazzling and elaborate in art,\r\nProtagoras, Prodicos, Hippias of Elis, Polos of Agrigentum,\r\nThrasymachos of Chalcedon, have left behind them an imperishable\r\nmemory;[815] but so have Busiris and Phalaris and Catiline. They are\r\nremembered for the good they might have done, and the evil they did.\r\n\r\nFootnote 815:\r\n\r\n  Muretus considers the word sophist to be synonymous with a teacher\r\n  of eloquence: “Sophista, id est, dicendi magister;” and, speaking of\r\n  this same Thrasymachos, cites a passage from Cicero which attributes\r\n  to him the invention of the rhetorical style. Orat. § 12. Suidas\r\n  regards Thrasymachos as the first who made use of the period and the\r\n  colon; and supposes him to have been pupil to Plato and Isocrates,\r\n  whereas he preceded both.—Muret. Comm. p. 631. seq.\r\n\r\nSince, however, the sophists acted so important a part in the\r\neducation of the Greeks, the space I devote to them is clearly their\r\ndue: it is necessary to the thorough comprehension of the subject.\r\nAlmost from the moment they arose they aimed at a monopoly of the art\r\nof teaching, and the father of the art, properly so called, was\r\nGorgias. Few names of antiquity, as Geel[816] has well observed, are\r\nbetter known or more celebrated than that of this distinguished\r\nsophist, among the causes of whose amazing popularity must be reckoned\r\nthe number of great men whom he instructed in eloquence, and the\r\nsplendid vices of style which his example and precept brought into\r\nvogue. The exact date of his birth is not known:[817] he is, however,\r\nsupposed to have been born at Leontium in Sicily, about the\r\nseventy-third Olympiad. His father’s name was Charmantes.[818] Nearly\r\nall the particulars of his early life are unknown, the ancients having\r\nbeen as much too negligent as we are too lavish of biographical\r\ndetails. Under whom he studied, with whom he conversed, how much he\r\nowed to others, and how much to his own genius and industry, are\r\npoints not easy to be determined, though we cannot adopt the opinion\r\nof Ælian,[819] who sends him to school to Philolaos; or of Diogenes\r\nLaertius, who will have Empedocles to have been his teacher, since the\r\nlatter was very little older than himself, and the former much\r\nyounger. Empedocles is indeed said to have invented the art of\r\nrhetoric, in which case we might suppose Gorgias to have been his\r\nscholar. But how invented? He may have been the first who sought to\r\nreduce it into an art, or who so called it; but as Aristotle observes,\r\nevery man who reasons persuasively is a rhetorician, whether his\r\neloquence be based on the formal study of the art or not. In\r\nphilosophy, indeed, he would seem[820] to have been the disciple of\r\nEmpedocles; but in rhetoric they both very probably derived\r\ninstruction from Corax and Tisias, who flourished and taught rhetoric\r\nin Sicily about the period of their youth.[821]\r\n\r\nFootnote 816:\r\n\r\n  Hist. Sophist. p. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 817:\r\n\r\n  Clinton, Fast. Hellen. ii. 28. 65. 67. Geel (Hist. Sophist. p. 14)\r\n  assumes the seventieth Olympiad as the date of his birth; but as it\r\n  seems to result from the text of Pausanias that he was still living\r\n  in 380. B.C. this would extend the duration of his life beyond that\r\n  assigned to it by any ancient writer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 818:\r\n\r\n  Of whom, as Muretus (Comm. p. 631. seq.) observes, no mention occurs\r\n  save in Plato de Repub. i. § 2. t. i. p. 8. Stallb.\r\n\r\nFootnote 819:\r\n\r\n  Var. Hist. i. 23. Diog. Laert. viii. 58.—Mr. Clinton, however,\r\n  adopts the opinion of Diogenes (Fast. Hell. ii. 365); and, to render\r\n  it probable, supposes Empedocles to have been a few years older than\r\n  his pupil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 820:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Men. p. 14. g.\r\n\r\nFootnote 821:\r\n\r\n  Cic. Brut. § 12. Geel, Hist. Sophist. p. 15. seq. Sext. Empir. p.\r\n  306. seq.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are mere conjectures. He would probably have died in\r\nobscurity, and been forgotten with the kings who reigned _ante\r\nAgamemnona_, had not the misfortunes of his country brought him, in\r\nold age, to the great workshop of Fame. The immediate occasion was\r\nthis; the people of Leontium having engaged and been worsted in war by\r\nthe Syracusans, sent ambassadors to demand succour of the Athenian\r\npeople, and among these the principal speaker was Gorgias. Practised\r\nin a style of oratory new at Athens, indulging in a profusion of\r\nmetaphors and other figures bordering on the licences of poetry, he\r\nimmediately hurried away captive his hearers, fulfilled the desires of\r\nhis fellow citizens, and established for himself a reputation[822]\r\nwhere all men most desired to possess one. To augment his glory it has\r\nnot been unusual to enumerate Pericles and Thucydides among those who\r\nbecame his scholars. But this embassy took place in the fifth year of\r\nthe Peloponnesian war when Pericles had been dead two years. That\r\nThucydides heard him, however, is not at all improbable, since his\r\nexile did not take place[823] till the eighth year of the war. Among\r\nhis admirers are mentioned two other men, whose principles and history\r\nafford the best illustration of what fruit the teaching of the\r\nsophists was likely to produce,—Critias and Alcibiades, whose ability,\r\ncourage, and profligacy rendered them the scourges of their country.\r\nIt has been with great probability supposed that, having on his return\r\nto Leontium rendered an account of his mission, he quitted Sicily for\r\never, for the purpose of becoming a professor of eloquence in Greece.\r\nThis is Diodorus’s account, but the Scholiast on Hermogenes supposes\r\nhim to have remained at Athens. Whether this was the case or not, he\r\nsoon considered one city, however great or celebrated, too confined a\r\ntheatre for the display of his merit. He, therefore, adopted the\r\nprofession of an itinerant lecturer, with the double view of\r\ngratifying his vanity and filling his purse. And he thoroughly\r\nunderstood the art of dazzling mankind, for, not supposing it enough\r\nto unfold before his auditors his magazines of tropes and figures,\r\nstored up, like theatrical thunder and lightning, to be introduced at\r\nthe proper moment, he had recourse to other dramatic arts for\r\nproducing effect, appearing in magnificent attire, flowing purple\r\nrobes, embroidered sandals, his fingers sparkling with gold and gems.\r\nBut though the oldest of the sophists, he was not the first who\r\nadopted this course. Protagoras, and perhaps others, had previously\r\ncommenced their peregrinations, and begun to practise on the credulity\r\nand weakness of the multitude. Among the Athenians they were paid\r\nchiefly with praise; “the solid pudding” was to be sought elsewhere.\r\nAnd accordingly we find, as Plato sarcastically expresses it, that\r\nupon the advent of the sophists, the Thessalians, usually celebrated\r\nfor their full purses and fine horses,[824] grew all at once\r\nremarkable for their love of wisdom, that is, paid the sophists\r\nhandsomely, in the hope of thus enticing knowledge to remain among\r\nthem. In fact they supposed that wisdom is like a candle and lantern,\r\nby which you may have light,—or a saint’s shirt, by wearing which you\r\ninfallibly become holy,—or the lamp of Epictetus, which a rich man\r\nbought at three thousand drachmas, in the hope that it would light him\r\ninto the very adyta of philosophy. However this may be, it is very\r\ncertain that the Thessalians became the patrons of the sophists, who\r\ndisposed in that country of more wisdom and eloquence than in any\r\nother part of Greece, and the principal purchasers of it were of the\r\nrich family of the Aleuadæ, the earliest Mæcenases, I believe, on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nFootnote 822:\r\n\r\n  Diod. Sicul. xii. 53.\r\n\r\nFootnote 823:\r\n\r\n  I cannot, therefore, see the reason of Geel’s doubt.—Hist. Sophist.\r\n  p. 18. Cf. Clint. Fast. Hellen. ii. p. 68.\r\n\r\nFootnote 824:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Hip. Maj. t. v. p. 416.\r\n\r\nBut the sophists, to their credit be it acknowledged, were no misers.\r\nWhat they easily gained they spent freely; and not merely so, but in\r\nmany instances converted the effects of their personal vanity into\r\npublic ornaments of the whole country. Thus Gorgias, enriched by the\r\nspoils of Thessaly, erected at Delphi a golden statue[825] of himself,\r\nwhich argued a more generous spirit than he would have shown by\r\nsetting it afloat in the channels of trade or husbandry or usury, in\r\nthe hope of rendering himself a great capitalist.\r\n\r\nFootnote 825:\r\n\r\n  Cressol. Theat. Rhet. i. 8.\r\n\r\nGorgias was long absent from Athens, and visited during his travels\r\nthe most considerable cities of Greece. Among other places he came to\r\nDelphi, where from the steps of the altar, probably during the games,\r\nhe delivered that oration called the Pythian, in celebration of which\r\nhe erected the above-mentioned statue.[826] From thence perhaps,—for\r\nthe chronology of his journey is not exactly known,—he proceeded to\r\nOlympia, where he also assisted at the games for the purpose of\r\nexhibiting his oratorical talents in the presence of all Greece, and\r\nreaping as it were in an hour a harvest of glory. This declamation,\r\ndelivered during the Peloponnesian war, had at least the\r\nrecommendation of being patriotic. Standing in front of the temple of\r\nZeus, the god of concord and of peace, he earnestly recommended union\r\nand harmony.[827] If war they must have, there were the\r\nbarbarians,—let their arms be turned against them. With what success\r\nhe spoke, history has informed us; but the satirists of antiquity,\r\never naturally addicted to scandal, are careful to remark that this\r\ngreat advocate of concord and unanimity kept up a civil war in his own\r\nhouse, where the charms of some beautiful-cheeked θεραπαινίδιον[828]\r\nexcited the jealousy of Madame. At the same time the old gentleman, to\r\nadopt the most moderate computation, must have been hard upon\r\nthree-score and ten, though some would make him eighty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 826:\r\n\r\n  Geel, Hist. Sophist. p. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 827:\r\n\r\n  They sometimes selected more humble subjects for their panegyric,\r\n  for example, the bumble-bee, or salt.—Isocrat. Hel. Encom. § 4. p.\r\n  461. Plutarch, too, speaks of a learned work on salt, which he\r\n  considered very edifying.—Sympos. § 5. A French author of the same\r\n  class devoted twenty years of his life to a treatise on the\r\n  nightingale. Another member of this confraternity is celebrated by\r\n  Rousseau:—“On dit qu’un allemand a fait un livre sur un zeste de\r\n  citron; j’en aurais fait un sur chaque gramen des prés, sur chaque\r\n  mousse des bois, sur chaque lichen qui tapisse les rochers; enfin,\r\n  je ne voulais pas laisser un poil d’herbe, pas un atome végétal qui\r\n  ne fût amplement décrit.”—Réveries, t. iii. p. 106. On the verbal\r\n  trifling of the sophists see Muret. in Aristot. Ethic. p. 79. By Le\r\n  Conte, in his Commentary on the Anabasis, Gorgias is transformed\r\n  into “a prudent and experienced officer,” because Proxenos is said\r\n  to have studied under him.—t. i. p. 246.\r\n\r\nFootnote 828:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Conj. Præcept. § 43. whom Geel follows.—Hist. Sophist. p. 25.\r\n  But Isocrates, who had been himself a hearer of Gorgias in Thessaly\r\n  (Cic. Orat. § 22), relates that he was never married, and had no\r\n  children.—De Permut. § 26. 10. Another tradition however speaks of\r\n  his son Philip as having been condemned by the Heliasts.—Schol.\r\n  Aristoph. Av. 1700.\r\n\r\nOver the latter days of Gorgias[829] hovers the same darkness which\r\nconceals from view the commencement. It is known with no degree of\r\ncertainty where he spent the close of his long life or where he died,\r\nthough as no account exists of his return to Sicily, it probably was\r\nin Greece.\r\n\r\nFootnote 829:\r\n\r\n  See Athen. xii. 71.\r\n\r\nNext to Gorgias in reputation was Protagoras, whose history is still\r\nless known. In the opinion of some writers he was the oldest of the\r\nsophists. Though the date of his birth be later than that of Gorgias,\r\nhe preceded him in the profession of the art. He was certainly, I\r\nthink, born much earlier than is supposed either by Clinton or by\r\nGeel, who take him to have been almost exactly of Socrates’ age, that\r\nis to have come into the world about 479 B. C. But in this opinion I\r\ncannot concur. It is in direct contradiction with a passage in\r\nPlato[830] who, however careless in matters of chronology, would, I am\r\npersuaded, never push his negligence so far as to make one man say to\r\nanother, born in the same year with himself, that he was old enough to\r\nbe his father. To me, therefore it appears necessary that we throw\r\nback ten or twelve years the date of his birth. He was ten years, it\r\nis admitted, older than Democritos. The latter, who had made\r\nconsiderable progress in philosophy when he saw Protagoras in the\r\ncapacity of a wood-carrier and undertook to initiate him in his\r\nsystem, could hardly have been less than seven or eight and twenty, so\r\nthat the former was little short of forty. He exercised the profession\r\nof sophist during forty years, and died about 406 B. C. He must\r\ntherefore have been born about 484–485 B. C.[831]\r\n\r\nFootnote 830:\r\n\r\n  Addressing Socrates, among many others, he says in one place, ἀλλὰ\r\n  πότερον ὑμῖν, ὡς πρεσβύτερος νεωτέροις, μῦθον λέγων ἐπιδείξω. κ. τ.\r\n  λ.—Protag. i. 170. But this is nothing to what he elsewhere says:\r\n  οὐδενὸς ὅτου οὐ πάντων ἂν ὑμῶν καθ᾽ ἡλικίαν πατὴρ εἴην.—Id. p.\r\n  165.—which without extreme absurdity a man could not say to a person\r\n  exactly of his own age. Meiners. (Hist. des Arts et des Sciences,\r\n  iii. 258), evidently refers to this passage; as does also Hardion.\r\n  Dissert. vii. Bib. Acad. iii. 295. Yet it must have wholly escaped\r\n  Geel, who (Hist. Sophist. p. 71) says: “Deinde _nescimus_ quomodo\r\n  efficiatur e Platonis Protagorâ, sophistam ejusdem nominis _multo_\r\n  majorem fuisse Socrate.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 831:\r\n\r\n  Diog. Laert. ix. 55. observes that, according to some writers, he\r\n  died, at the age of 90, during a journey.—Geel, p. 81. It is\r\n  sufficiently remarkable that most of the Sophists attained to a very\r\n  great old age, and the same thing may be said generally of the\r\n  philosophers of antiquity. Lord Bacon undertakes to account for the\r\n  fact. Having given the palm of long life to hermits and anchorites,\r\n  he says: “Next unto this is a life led in good letters, such as was\r\n  that of Philosophers, Rhetoricians, Grammarians. This life is also\r\n  led in leisure, and in those thoughts which, seeing they are severed\r\n  from the affairs of the world, bite not, but rather delight through\r\n  their vanity and impertinency: they live also at their pleasure,\r\n  spending their time in such things as like them best, and for the\r\n  most part in the company of young men, which is ever the most\r\n  cheerful.”—History of Life and Death, p. 24.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot here pursue the history of the sophists, which no further\r\nbelongs to my work than as it is connected with the subject of\r\neducation. On their writings, however, and manner of teaching it is\r\nnecessary that I should be more explicit. Whether Gorgias first\r\npublished or Protagoras is of little moment; both evidently wrote with\r\nthe same aim, which was to confound truth and error, right and wrong,\r\nnot perhaps through any enmity to truth or to virtue, but from the\r\nsheer vanity of being thought capable of any thing, and the desire of\r\nconverting their talents to account. One distinguishing quality of the\r\nclass was fertility. They piqued themselves on being able to pour\r\nforth volume after volume, treatise after treatise, speech after\r\nspeech. This, indeed, it was that constituted their principal claim to\r\nsuperiority over the philosophers, a pains-taking race, among whom the\r\nperiod of intellectual gestation was longer than that of the elephant;\r\nwhereas your true sophist, without meditation, study or experience,\r\nastonished his admirers by the copiousness of his invention, by\r\nimagery, gorgeous and glittering, generally stolen from the poets, and\r\nby a piquant air of profoundness and originality, which the art of\r\nseeming to doubt all that other men believe never fails to confer.\r\n\r\nBesides, comprehending enough of human nature to know that whoever\r\namuses is listened to, whatever atrocities he may utter, they were\r\ncareful to invest their doctrine with a light and graceful exterior.\r\nNo man ever excelled them at a joke. They in fact managed matters so\r\nthat in their hands every thing became a joke, and to overthrow an\r\nantagonist demanded nothing more than to be able to raise a laugh at\r\nhis expense; for, all the world over, in the opinion of the vulgar,\r\nwhoever is ridiculous is wrong. From calculation, they eschewed the\r\nuphill task of correcting error, or advancing truth, or reforming\r\nmanners. To upbraid men for their faults and counsel amendment, is to\r\nincur their enmity. Reformers, prophets, apostles of truth have always\r\nbeen persecuted, often put to death. The sophists felt no ambition to\r\nbe martyrs. Poverty, too, and obscurity, spare diet, a coarse mantle,\r\nand the solitude in which the poor great man walks the world, they\r\ncould not away with. To their happiness crowds of admirers, opulence,\r\ncostly robes[832] and all the refinements of luxury formed a _sine quâ\r\nnon_; and accordingly in the choice of their doctrines they were\r\nguided by one consideration only, viz. how they might amuse mankind,\r\nand reap all the advantages of popularity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 832:\r\n\r\n  Herault de Sechelles, who, had he lived, would have excelled Boswell\r\n  in biography, describes with singular felicity the passion of that\r\n  arch-sophist, Buffon, for the splendours of dress. Even among the\r\n  peasants of Montbar, a race of primitive simplicity, the French\r\n  Hippias would never appear but in an embroidered suit, curled and\r\n  decorated as if at court. He had nicely calculated the effect of\r\n  external appearances on the mind; and we must forgive him, since he\r\n  shared the weakness with Lord Bacon and Aristotle.—See Voyage à\r\n  Montbar, p. 42, seq.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence which statesmen employed to recommend their measures,\r\nthe sophists applied to fictitious uses, imagining themselves in\r\nimpossible circumstances, reversing times, confounding manners, and\r\nattacking or defending men long since dead. In all such cases the\r\ninterest would chiefly depend on the novelty or ingenuity of the\r\nthoughts and the subtle artifices of style. Hence the extravagance,\r\nthe coldness, the perversion of imagery, the distortion and monkey\r\ntricks of language, for which their manner of compositions became\r\nremarkable. The false position they took up led, in philosophy, to\r\nresults equally disastrous. To aim at truth, would have been to throw\r\nthemselves into the wake of the philosophers, to share, without\r\nworldly compensation, their dangers, labours, and comparative\r\ninsignificance. They struck out, therefore, a new course for\r\nthemselves. Taking philosophy as it was, they undertook to dispute on\r\nall and every part of it; to show that for a skilful dialectician\r\nthere was no proposition that might not with nearly equal facility be\r\nattacked or defended; that by means of syllogisms or enthymemes,\r\nartfully arranged, darkness may be proved to be light, and light\r\ndarkness; that between lying and speaking the truth there is no\r\ndifference; that in fact both veracity and falsehood are nonentities,\r\nall our notions being mere arbitrary fictions; and that to beat your\r\ndog and to beat your father is the same thing.\r\n\r\nOf this novel and ingenious style of argumentation,[833] in which\r\nHudibras was an adept, we are furnished with abundant examples by\r\nPlato, more especially in the Euthydemus, where two old fellows, with\r\narguments longer than their beards, luxuriate in the felicitous\r\ninventions by which, like another Circe, they are enabled to transform\r\ntheir hearers into hogs and bulldogs. In humorous extravagance the\r\ndialogue scarcely falls short of an Aristophanic comedy or a Christmas\r\npantomime. Socrates[834] plays the Clown, Ctesippos the Harlequin, and\r\nthe blows dealt upon the magicians in the course of the piece, are\r\nsuch as, were they fully comprehended, would set all Drury Lane or\r\nCovent Garden in a roar. But the length of the scenes prevents their\r\ntransplantation into my pages, and the abridgment of a joke is a very\r\ndull thing. Let us, however, hear by what logic they proved Socrates\r\nto have been a second “man without a navel.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 833:\r\n\r\n  Another example may be found in Athen. iii. 54.\r\n\r\nFootnote 834:\r\n\r\n  Socrates has been confounded with the Sophists, because he\r\n  frequented their company to refute them; but there was between them\r\n  the same difference, as between a thief-taker and a thief.\r\n\r\n“Answer me,” cried Dionysidoros.\r\n\r\n“Well then,” replied Socrates, “I answer that Iolaus was the nephew of\r\nHeracles, and, as far as I can see, no nephew of mine. For my brother\r\nPatrocles was not his father, but quite another guess sort of person,\r\nIphicles the brother of Heracles.”\r\n\r\n“And Patrocles was your brother?”\r\n\r\n“By the mother, not by the father.”\r\n\r\n“Then he was your brother, and not your brother?”\r\n\r\n“By the father’s side he was not,” answered Socrates, “since he was\r\nthe son of Charidemos, and I of Sophroniscos.”\r\n\r\n“But Sophroniscos, no less than Charidemos, was a father.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; the former was my father, the latter Patrocles’.”\r\n\r\n“Then was Charidemos other than a father?”\r\n\r\n“He was other than mine.”\r\n\r\n“Then he was a father, and not a father? But, come, are you the same\r\nthing as a stone?”\r\n\r\n“I fear,” replied Socrates, “I shall appear to be no better in your\r\nhands, though I do not discover the identity.”\r\n\r\n“Well, being other than a stone, you are not a stone; being other than\r\ngold, you are not gold. And must not the same thing happen to\r\nCharidemos? Being something else than a father, he is not a father.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems,” replied the philosopher.\r\n\r\n“And what is true of Charidemos,” replied the younger sophist, “must\r\nbe true of Sophroniscos. Being other than a father, he is not a\r\nfather: from which, my good friend, it follows that you never had any\r\nfather at all![835]”\r\n\r\nFootnote 835:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Opp. iii. 444, seq.\r\n\r\nSocrates being thus placed on a level with the first man, his friend\r\nCtesippos took up the ball, and sent it with so much force into the\r\nface of the sophists, that it somewhat startled them.\r\n\r\n“Come, then,” said he, “is not your own father in precisely the same\r\ncircumstances? Is he not different from my father?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” answered Euthydemos.\r\n\r\n“What, then, he is the same?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“I should be sorry to think so. However, is he my father only, or is\r\nhe everybody else’s father?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody’s, of course; for can you imagine him to be a father, and\r\nnot a father?”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought so,” answered Ctesippos.\r\n\r\n“What! that gold is not gold, and that a man is not a man?”\r\n\r\n“Not so, friend Euthydemos; but you do not, as the saying is, mingle\r\nflax with flax; and your assertion, that your father is the father of\r\nall men, seems very extraordinary.”\r\n\r\n“But he is, though.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; but is he not only the father of men but of horses and\r\nevery other animal?”\r\n\r\n“Of everything!”\r\n\r\n“And your mother, in like manner, is the mother of all things?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then she is the mother of the sea-hedgehog.”\r\n\r\n“And so is yours!”\r\n\r\n“And you are the full brother of gudgeons, cubs, and sucking-pigs.”\r\n\r\n“So are you!”\r\n\r\n“And your father is a dog.”\r\n\r\n“And yours, too!”\r\n\r\nIt was now evident they were in anger, and accordingly Dionysidoros\r\ninterposed, and observed jocularly,—\r\n\r\n“Provided you will answer me, Ctesippos, I undertake to make you\r\nconfess that your father is just what my brother has said. So, tell\r\nme, have you a dog?”\r\n\r\n“I have, and a snappish cur he is, too.”\r\n\r\n“And has he young ones?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and they are more snappish than himself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, is not the dog their father?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt.”\r\n\r\n“And the dog is yours?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“It follows then, if he be a father and yours, that he must be your\r\nfather; so that his cubs are your brothers.”\r\n\r\nBefore the young man could reply to this compliment the sophist\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n“Answer me, Ctesippos, a little longer. Do you ever beat that dog?”\r\n\r\n“That I do,” replied Ctesippos laughing; “and I wish I could\r\nadminister the same discipline to you in your turn.”\r\n\r\n“Then you beat your own father!”\r\n\r\n“The beating,” answered the young man, “would be more justly inflicted\r\non yours, for having knowingly let loose two such sages upon\r\nmankind!”[836]\r\n\r\nFootnote 836:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Opp. t. iii. p. 245.—The amusing manner of teaching introduced\r\n  by these sophists was sometimes imitated by the philosophers. Thus\r\n  Theophrastus, who, before proceeding to his school, used to anoint\r\n  himself with oil and perform his exercises, had recourse to\r\n  extraordinary drollery for the purpose of charming his pupils,\r\n  adapting all his gestures and movements to his discourses; so that\r\n  when describing the manners and character of a glutton, he used,\r\n  like a comic actor, to thrust out his tongue and lick his\r\n  lips.—Athen. i. 38.\r\n\r\nBut these, after all, were but laughing sophists, who, though they had\r\nsucceeded in confounding and obliterating from their own minds every\r\ntrace of difference between right and wrong, fell short of that superb\r\ndegree of wickedness at which Polos, Callicles, and Thrasymachos\r\narrived, at least in speculation. The former were mere babblers, who\r\ncorrupted a pupil or two whom bad luck threw in their way.\r\nThrasymachos flew at higher game. His sophistry was political,[837]\r\nand his aim the destruction of freedom, by extinguishing that sense of\r\njustice on which it must ever be based. The genius of the man was\r\nconsiderable. He had deep thoughts, and investigated boldly; but his\r\nsympathies having somehow been early perverted, he grew sombre,\r\nfierce, and unsociable, and without the slightest disguise advocated,\r\nlike our Hobbes,[838] tyrannical maxims and morals. Money, like the\r\nrest, he of course worshipped. Nay, in the conversation at the house\r\nof Cephalos he even ventures to sneer rudely at Socrates’ poverty;\r\nupon which Glaucon[839] observes:—\"Don’t fear to go unpaid for the\r\ninstruction you may give him, for we will enter into a subscription on\r\nhis behalf.\"[840] Thrasymachos, however, was still more vain than\r\navaricious. He thirsted to exhibit his notions in order to enjoy the\r\nsatisfaction arising from shocking those who heard him. He maintained\r\nthat justice is nothing more than what in any state the rulers think\r\nproper to establish; and that, consequently, the ordinances of a\r\ntyrant are as binding and as just as the laws of a free state, since\r\nby nature all actions are indifferent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 837:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Dem. Lacrit. § 10. Sch. Aristoph. Nub. 113.\r\n\r\nFootnote 838:\r\n\r\n  The modern Thrasymachos is as frank in his hatred of philosophers as\r\n  the ancient. He compares their enthusiasm in favour of freedom to\r\n  the virus imparted by the bite of a mad dog, imagining that nothing\r\n  is so sedulously to be guarded against as liberty. He would, if\r\n  possible, have the study of ancient statesmen and historians\r\n  prohibited, or at least that care should be taken to counteract\r\n  their maxims by the teaching of discreet sophists. “I cannot\r\n  imagine,” he says, “how anything can be more prejudicial to a\r\n  monarchy than the allowing of such books to be publicly read,\r\n  without present applying such correctives of discreet masters, as\r\n  are fit to take away their venom; which venom I will not doubt to\r\n  compare to the biting of a mad dog, which is a disease the\r\n  physicians call _hydrophobia_, or _fear of water_. For, as he that\r\n  is so bitten has a continual torment of thirst, and yet abhorreth\r\n  water, and is in such an estate, as if the poison endeavoured to\r\n  convert him into a dog; so, when a monarchy is once bitten to the\r\n  quick, by those democratical writers, that continually snarl at that\r\n  estate, it wanteth nothing more than a strong monarch, which,\r\n  nevertheless, out of a certain _tyrannophobia_ or fear of being\r\n  strongly governed, when they have him, they abhor.”—Leviathan, Pt.\r\n  ii. c. 29. iii. 315. Count Capo D’Istrias, if he was ignorant of the\r\n  language of ancient Greece, appears at least to have understood\r\n  something of the spirit of ancient philosophy, for, designing to\r\n  establish a tyranny, he prohibited the reading of Plato in the\r\n  public schools. He may possibly have learned his maxims of\r\n  government from Hobbes, as well as that the master of the academy\r\n  deserved his hatred.—Thiersch. Etat. Act. de la Grèce, ii. 121.\r\n\r\nFootnote 839:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. i. § 11. t. i. p. 41. Stallb.\r\n\r\nFootnote 840:\r\n\r\n  Ἔρανος. Cf. Sympos. t. iv. p. 379. Bekk.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, a part of the sophistical doctrine, to maintain in\r\npolitics, what Hobbes afterwards advocated, the right of the\r\nstronger:—\r\n\r\n                —--\"The good old rule, the simple plan,\r\n              That they should take who have the power,\r\n                And they should keep who can.\"\r\n\r\nBut because there is in every man’s heart a rooted prejudice in favour\r\nof justice, they were fain to argue that all governors, in as far as\r\nthey deserved the name, would ordain what was best for themselves, and\r\nthat, whatever it might be, was just:[841] a very satisfactory\r\ndoctrine, which has never grown wholly out of fashion. They laughed to\r\nscorn, as persons who required nurses to look after them and wipe\r\ntheir noses,[842] whomsoever they found entertaining the notion that\r\ngovernments were instituted for the good of the governed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 841:\r\n\r\n  Upon this point Father Paul observes:—\"We must reduce under the\r\n  title of justice everything that may contribute to the service of\r\n  the state; for the prince has no greater justice than to preserve to\r\n  himself the quality of prince, and, in order to this, to keep his\r\n  subjects in a dutiful subjection to his authority.\"—Max. of the Gov.\r\n  of Venice, chap. i. § 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 842:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. t. vi. p. 34.\r\n\r\nTheir staple comparison was always a flock or a herd. What shepherd,\r\nthey inquired, ever looked after his flock for their benefit, and not\r\nfor his own use? In like manner magistrates, who, as is proper, hold\r\nthe chief place in cities, look on the public exactly as if they are\r\nso many sheep or oxen, and think of nothing, night or day, but how\r\nthey may derive most advantage from them. Justice, therefore, is what\r\npromotes the interests of the governors, though it may be loss to the\r\ngoverned. The man, esteemed just and pious and holy by the\r\nphilosopher, was merely, in their opinion, a fool. Whenever anything\r\nis to be gained he gets less than any man, and when anything is to be\r\ndone for the community he does more. He is always ready with his purse\r\nwhenever anything is to be paid; always out of the way when gain is\r\nafloat. The unjust man, on the contrary, knows what he is about. He\r\npays and does as little as possible for the public, and takes from it\r\nall he can. The former renders himself disagreeable to his friends and\r\ndomestics, by refusing to commit any unjust action on their behalf.\r\nThe latter, on the other hand, unscrupulous in acquisition, is able to\r\noblige many by his wealth if he happens to require their services.\r\nThus even in private life and small matters injustice is to be\r\npreferred; but when it operates on a grand scale, plunders whole\r\ncities, and usurps over them supreme authority, it reaches the acme of\r\nfelicity, is saluted by the name of prince, and becomes an object of\r\nenvy to all mankind.\r\n\r\nNor did they pause even here. It was not enough to show the happiness\r\nof vice as vice; they undertook to prove that vice is virtue and\r\nvirtue vice, which may be considered as their magnum opus. They went\r\nto work boldly, but, like the fox of Archilochos,[843] always kept\r\nsomething of their figure concealed, that, if any necessity arose,\r\nthey might be able to retreat by treating their whole chain of\r\nargumentation as a mere rhetorical exercise. “You appear to be in\r\nearnest,” observed Socrates on one occasion. “What does it signify to\r\nyou whether I am in earnest or not,” replied the sophist, “if you\r\ncannot refute what I advance?” With this prudent reserve, they taught\r\nthat injustice is a powerful and beautiful principle, reckoning it\r\namong the virtues, and attributing to it all the characteristics\r\nusually attributed to justice.[844] Pascal, in developing the morals\r\nof the Jesuits, describes their principles exactly. They patronised\r\neven cutting purses, providing the operator had the ingenuity to\r\nconceal his performance. No doubt, in thus arguing, they did violence\r\nto their secret convictions, and might, by an able dialectician, be\r\nmade to feel, though never to acknowledge, the deformity of their\r\ndoctrines, as Thrasymachos, driven up in a corner by the logic of\r\nSocrates, blushes and is chap-fallen;[845] but as sophistry was their\r\noccupation, the misery and degradation was, that, convinced or not\r\nconvinced, they must still sing the old song. It is evident, in fact,\r\nthat, like many sophists of other days, they were bold with the lips\r\nwhile the heart within trembled. The light of conscience could not be\r\nwholly quenched. They conceived the gods to be armed with power and\r\ndisposed to exert it, not only against evil doers but against evil\r\nspeakers also. Pressed upon this point, whether the bad be not\r\nobnoxious and the good agreeable to the deities, Thrasymachos would\r\nnot deny it. And why? Lest he should render himself hateful to them,\r\nἴνα μὴ τοῖς δὲ ἀπέχθωμαι. So that in the worst times of paganism,\r\nreligion, how corrupt soever, failed not to preserve some influence\r\nover men’s minds, to save them from the bestial recklessness into\r\nwhich they seemed desirous to plunge.[846]\r\n\r\nFootnote 843:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. t. vi. p. 72. Bekk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 844:\r\n\r\n  Id. i. t. vi. p. 44. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 845:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. vi. 49. i. 76. Stallb. Cf. Vict. Var. Lect. iii. v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 846:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. t. vi. p. 52.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the sophists on many points did but methodise, condense\r\nand embody in florid language the maxims and modes of thinking current\r\nin corrupt ages among the vulgar. Their doctrines were but an echo of\r\nwhat was heard in the ecclesiæ, in the law courts, in the theatres,\r\nand in the camps. It would have been to little purpose, therefore, to\r\nhave silenced them, unless, at the same time, the above schools could\r\nhave been purified, wherein young and old, men and women, imbibed the\r\nopinions, maxims, prejudices, which constituted the system of the\r\nsophists.[847] And Plato, who observes this, supplies us, in doing so,\r\nwith a fresh proof that women frequented the theatre. In one of these\r\nfour places, he says, they were corrupted: but they were not soldiers,\r\nand, therefore, not in the camp; they were not dicasts, and,\r\ntherefore, not in the law courts; they were neither orators nor\r\nvoters, and, therefore, not in the ecclesiæ. The evil doctrines they\r\nimbibed, therefore, must have been imbibed at the theatre.[848] Here,\r\ntoo, the youth, disciplined and principled in better things by his\r\nphilosophical teachers, received a new education which overthrew the\r\nformer. Deeds and words, condemned by his teachers, he often found to\r\nbe greeted here with rapturous applause, re-echoed by rocks and walls;\r\nwhile hisses, sneers, or vociferous vituperation would, perhaps, be\r\nshowered on things he had been taught most to revere. In his feelings,\r\ntherefore, and internal convictions a revolution was soon effected. He\r\ngrew ashamed of the notions implanted in him at school. Every\r\nlingering sentiment of honour seemed to him an unfortunate prejudice\r\ndespised by men of the world, and he hastened to shift his notions as\r\na clown does his dress to prepare for admittance into fashionable\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nFootnote 847:\r\n\r\n  Id. vi. 290.\r\n\r\nFootnote 848:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Rep. vi. t. vi. p. 289. Cf. Athen. ii. 54.\r\n\r\nThe sophists, skilled in the study of mankind, soon discovered, that\r\nto please and ultimately to rule the ignorant, it was necessary to\r\nhumour their failings, and, in appearance at least, to adopt their\r\nopinions. In a commonwealth, governed by wholesome principles, great\r\nmen obtain influence, not by resembling the majority but by\r\ndiffering from them. They are popular by the authority of their\r\nvirtues. They are reverenced with the reverence due to a father from\r\nhis child, who confides in him from long experience in his love and\r\nimplicit faith in his honour, and will submit to be rebuked and\r\nchastised, and determined by him in his actions from the conviction\r\nthat his superior wisdom and probity and affection entitle him to\r\nrule. But the sophists, and their political disciples, despaired of\r\nthus governing the people. In their manners there was none of the\r\ndignity, in their minds none of the wisdom, in their resolutions\r\nnone of that inflexible firmness arising from consciousness of\r\nright, which neither threats nor clamour can subdue. They regarded\r\nthe populace as a huge beast, whose ways and temper they must study,\r\nwhose passions and desires they must know how to raise and how to\r\nsatisfy; by what arts they might safely enter his den, stroke his\r\nterrible paws, or mount, if they thought proper, on his back and\r\ndirect his irresistible might against their enemies. And this they\r\nesteemed as wisdom, and upon those who excelled in it they bestowed\r\nthe name of statesmen and philosophers.[849] Among the arts by which\r\nthis influence was acquired were flattery and boasting; by the\r\nformer they disposed people to listen, by the latter they sought to\r\njustify them for listening, by dwelling on the wonders they could\r\nperform. If they might be believed, they could convert fools into\r\nwise men, which philosophers regarded in the light of a miracle.\r\nThis disposition τὸ θρασὺ καὶ τὸ ἰταμὸν,[850] as Basilius expresses\r\nit, is admirably painted by Plato in the character of Thrasymachos.\r\nAnd the contrast afforded by Socrates makes good, as Muretus\r\nobserves, the wise remark of Thucydides ὅτι ἀμαθία μὲν θάρσος,\r\nφρόνησις δ᾽ ὄκνον φέρει.\r\n\r\nFootnote 849:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. vi. 293.\r\n\r\nFootnote 850:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Rep. vi. 333. Cf. Muret. Adnot. in Repub. p. 667, seq. 677,\r\n  seq.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, as they were, the reputation of the sophists spread far\r\nand wide. Even among the barbarians of Asia a desire was felt to have\r\nthe ear tickled by their eloquence, as we may gather from the letter\r\nof Amytocrates, an Indian king, to Antiochos, requesting him to ship\r\noff for India as soon as possible, some boiled wine, dried figs, and a\r\nsophist, observing that he would very willingly pay the price of him.\r\nBut Antiochos, either loth to part with so useful a servant of the\r\nmonarchy, or out of pity for the Indians, whom he suspected to be\r\nalready sufficiently tormented, replied, that as for boiled wine and\r\nfigs he might be supplied to his heart’s content, but that with\r\nrespect to sophists the law prohibited their exportation.[851] He had\r\nall the while, however, without knowing it, abundant specimens of the\r\nrace in his own realms, where the Brahmins have, time out of mind,\r\ncultivated and thriven by the same arts, and maintained the same\r\nopinions, as conferred celebrity on the followers of Gorgias and\r\nProtagoras. Their practices, indeed, as well as those of the Yoghis,\r\nare in India modified by the state of society and public opinion. The\r\nwonder which among the Greeks was excited by the advocacy of monstrous\r\ndoctrines, on the banks of the Ganges, arises out of physical pranks.\r\nThe Greek sophist tortured his mind, the Indian tortures his body for\r\nthe edification of the public, but the result is the same; the\r\npractitioners thus contrive to subsist in idleness on the earnings of\r\nthe industrious and credulous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 851:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                  EDUCATION OF THE SPARTANS, CRETANS,\r\n                            ARCADIANS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nA different picture is presented to us by the education of the\r\nSpartans,[852] which, almost perfect in its kind, aimed chiefly at\r\nunfolding the powers of the body. Mental acquirements in the states of\r\nDoric origin were few, and the object even of these seems to have been\r\nrather connected with the developement of the animal than the\r\nspiritual nature of man, though they were not utterly destitute of all\r\nthose arts and accomplishments which embellish a life of peace. Little\r\nstress, however, can be laid on the elaborate divisions of youth into\r\nnumerous classes, the intention of which is not stated. There can,\r\nnevertheless, be no doubt that much art, reflection and wisdom was\r\nexhibited in the forming of the system whose object was the creation\r\nof a military character, and through this the enjoyment of the\r\nhegemonia or lead in the public affairs of Greece, an honour which\r\nSparta attained to and held during many years.[853]\r\n\r\nFootnote 852:\r\n\r\n  See Müll. Dor. ii. 313, sqq. Cf. Pfeiff. Ant. ii. 57. p. 370.\r\n\r\nFootnote 853:\r\n\r\n  To destroy the power of Sparta the Achæans could imagine no better\r\n  means than to change their system of education.—Plut. Vit. Philop. §\r\n  16. Paus. vii. 8. 5. The Mityleneans, too, desirous of breaking the\r\n  military spirit of certain of their allies, forbade them to give the\r\n  least instruction to their children.—Ælian, V. H. vii. 15. With the\r\n  same view the Emperor Julian closed the public schools against the\r\n  Christians.—Gibbon, iv. 111. Among our ancestors, too, when a blow\r\n  was meditated against Dissenters, no measure more severe could be\r\n  devised than to deprive them of education.—Lord John Russell, Hist.\r\n  of Eur. i. 273.\r\n\r\nA modern writer has correctly remarked that by permitting the state to\r\ndecide on the lives of infants, the institutions of Lycurgus\r\nrecognised the authority of the community to regulate, how it pleased,\r\nthe education they were to receive. The authority of parents over\r\ntheir children was thus all but annihilated, for, although the\r\nrecognition and feeling of relationship continued after the state had\r\nundertaken the training of youth, their influence was exceedingly\r\nweakened, a circumstance to which may be attributed the seeming\r\nheroism of the Spartan women, who could stoically bear the death of\r\ntheir sons because they had been in a great measure estranged from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the institutions of Lycurgus differed in all things else\r\nfrom those of other Grecian legislators, it is not surprising they\r\nshould also differ on the subject of education. But it may greatly be\r\ndoubted whether we altogether comprehend his system. The accounts\r\ntransmitted to us are in many points contradictory, and it may in\r\ngeneral be remarked that on no subject whatever do modern ideas differ\r\nso much from those prevalent in antiquity, as on the subject of\r\neducation. Plutarch and Xenophon, or rather the sophist who assumed\r\nhis name, two of the authors on whom in this discussion most reliance\r\nis usually placed, were prejudiced and credulous, and often, to speak\r\nfrankly, extremely ignorant. Both were unwilling, even if they\r\npossessed the power, to criticise the system, and yet by modern\r\nwriters their opinions have generally without scruple been adopted.\r\nXenophon himself, as well as the sophist who here apes him, was in\r\npredilections a Spartan, and as strongly disposed to satirise and\r\nunderrate the institutions of his own country as to exaggerate the\r\nmerits of the Laconian. Even were the trifling essay on the\r\nLacedæmonian republic proved to be his, we should yet lay little\r\nstress upon its testimony, unless when corroborated by the evidence of\r\nother and better writers.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in Greece,—observes the author of this tract,[854] whoever\r\nhe was,—persons, the most solicitous respecting the education of their\r\nchildren, placed over them at the first dawn of intellectual\r\ndevelopement, pædagogues, who at the outset undertook their\r\ninstruction, and afterwards conducted them to the schools where\r\nletters, music, and gymnastics were taught. In this respect, however,\r\nas a modern writer has shown, the institutions of Sparta were in no\r\ndegree superior, since Helots were there the instructors of young\r\nchildren; and, on this account, he rejects the story of Plutarch,[855]\r\nthat they were compelled to intoxicate themselves, to exhibit to the\r\nyouths a practical proof of the deformity of drunkenness.[856] It was\r\ncontrary, he says, to common sense. But as common sense had very\r\nlittle to do with any part of the system, this is a poor argument, and\r\nwill not weigh against positive testimony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 854:\r\n\r\n  Rep. Lac. ii. 1. Cf. Pfeiff. Ant. p. 370.\r\n\r\nFootnote 855:\r\n\r\n  Lycurg. 28. Müll. Dor. ii. 39. Commonly, also, the nurses of the\r\n  kings were Helots.—Plut. Ages. § 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 856:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Inst. Lac. § 29.\r\n\r\nAnother evil which the Pseudo-Xenophon discovers in the common\r\nHellenic plan of training,[857] was that lads were indulged with the\r\nuse of shoes, and rendered effeminate by frequent changes of clean\r\nlinen, while their appetite, generally keen in boyhood,[858] was\r\nsuffered to be the measure of what they ate. Lycurgus, he remarks,\r\nmanaged all these things differently. Instead of remaining under the\r\nsuperintendence of their parents, and frequenting what schools and\r\nmasters they might judge proper, boys at Sparta passed under a sort of\r\ncamp discipline regulated by the laws and intrusted to the\r\nguardianship of a particular magistrate, whom they denominated a\r\nPædonomos. This part of the system Xenophon[859] prefers to the\r\nAthenian practice of intrusting youth to the care of servile\r\npædagogues. The Pædonomos, however, resembled in many respects the\r\nAthenian Gymnasiarch, and, so far as I can perceive, possessed no\r\nsuperiority over him, except that his authority extended beyond school\r\nhours. He was, indeed, a kind of despot, vested with the power to call\r\nthe boys together when he pleased, and inflict chastisement, at his\r\nown discretion, on any whom he detected exhibiting the least symptom\r\nof effeminacy. To enable him to carry his resolutions instantly into\r\neffect he marched about the town like an executioner, attended by men\r\nhaving whips, who at his nod seized the boy delinquent and subjected\r\nhim at once to the torture. Thus possessing the power of enforcing\r\nobedience, a great show at least of reverence attended him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 857:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. Laced. ii. 5. Cf. Plut. Lycurg. § 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 858:\r\n\r\n  And keen it must needs have been before they could have relished\r\n  their black broth, with a dose of which Dionysios once made an\r\n  experiment upon his stomach. Having put a spoonful of the compound\r\n  into his mouth, he instantly spat it out again, declaring that he\r\n  could not swallow it, for it was the filthiest stuff he had ever\r\n  tasted; upon which his Spartan cook remarked, “You should have first\r\n  bathed in the Eurotas.”—Plut.

Who the Mothaces were it is extremely difficult to determine. Some\r\ncontend that they were slaves brought up in the family.[861] But\r\nAthenæus, and Phylarchos whom he quotes, state most distinctly that\r\nthey were free, ἐλεύθεροι μέν εἰσί. In order to remove the\r\nunfavourable impression made on mankind by the accounts transmitted to\r\nus of Spartan slavery, it has been pretended that they, as well as the\r\nNeodamodes, were Helots. Of the Neodamodes, however, the very author\r\non whom reliance is placed asserts the contrary. They were originally\r\nslaves indeed, he says, but different from the Helots, ἑτέρους ὄντας\r\nτῶν εἱλώτων. With respect to the Mothaces,[862] notwithstanding the\r\ntestimony of Hesychius and other grammarians, it seems clear that they\r\nwere the sons of free though poor Laconians, who, desirous of\r\nobtaining for them the rights of Spartans, sent them to be the\r\ncompanions of such youthful citizens as would consent to receive them.\r\nIt is moreover added that the youth, according to their means, chose\r\none, two, or more of these companions; which shows that although the\r\nright of controlling the studies of its children was vested in the\r\nstate, the expenses, in whole or in part, devolved upon the parents.\r\n\r\nFootnote 860:\r\n\r\n  Athen. vi. 102.\r\n\r\nFootnote 861:\r\n\r\n  Müll. ii. 314.\r\n\r\nFootnote 862:\r\n\r\n  Harpocrat. v. Μόθωνες.\r\n\r\nThe Mothaces, or Mothones as they are sometimes called, were identical\r\nwith the σύντροφοι:[863] but the τρόφιμοι were such youthful\r\nstrangers—for example, the sons of Xenophon[864] and Phocion—as, by\r\nsubmitting to the severities of Spartan discipline, acquired the\r\nfreedom of the city, the privilege of aspiring to political\r\ndistinction, and, according to some writers, even a share of the land.\r\nThis, if true, would render credible the statement of the philosopher\r\nTeles,[865] who affirms that even Helots, by the means above\r\ndescribed, could rise to the rank of Spartans; while they who in this\r\npoint disobeyed the laws, were they even the children of kings, sank\r\nto the condition of Helots, and of course forfeited their estates,\r\notherwise there would have been no land to bestow on the military\r\nneophytes. Three of the most remarkable men in Spartan story,\r\nLysander, Gylippos, and Callicratidas were Mothaces, whose fathers\r\nwere obscure.[866] It will be seen that we have here the original of\r\nthat system of education sketched by Xenophon in his Persian Utopia,\r\nand designed to recommend monarchy to his countrymen, as that of Sir\r\nThomas More was framed for the contrary purpose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 863:\r\n\r\n  De Rep.

Fact,\r\ntoo, bears out this view, for two of the noblest sovereigns of Sparta,\r\nLeonidas and Agesilaos, had been subjected, while boys,[868] to the\r\ncorrection of their teachers.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that the spirit of Spartan education was\r\nsevere. It was, in fact, precisely the same as that which, in the last\r\ngeneration, pervaded the discipline of the Seneka and Mohawk Indians,\r\nand produced those numerous examples of patience, fortitude, and\r\nmagnanimity, together with that force, agility and suppleness of body\r\nso greatly admired and, perhaps, envied by civilised nations. It was\r\nthis stern and martial system that constituted the secret model,\r\naccording to which Locke fashioned his plan of youthful training,\r\ndesigned rather to produce a sound mind in a sound body than to\r\nshatter and enervate the latter by the piling up in the brain of\r\nmiscellaneous and often useless knowledge. But in his attempts at\r\nhardening the frame and rendering it invulnerable to the stings of\r\nsuffering, our countryman did not dare to go the lengths of the\r\nSpartan legislator, who in this, at least, exhibited superior wisdom,\r\nthat he did not consider the chastisement of stripes to have any\r\ntendency towards creating a base and servile habit of mind.[869]\r\n\r\nFootnote 867:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Ages. § i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 868:\r\n\r\n  Müll. Dor. ii. 315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 869:\r\n\r\n  On the democratic tendency of Spartan discipline see Bœckh. in Plat.\r\n  Min. 181. sqq. Isocrat. Areop. § 14–16.\r\n\r\nConsistently with the general aim of his institutions, Lycurgus,\r\ninstead of ordaining, like Locke, that his alumni should wear leaky\r\nshoes, dispensed with the incumbrance altogether. And, certainly, in a\r\nsoldier, the habit of trampling with the naked foot on ice and snow\r\nand the sharpest rocks, is worthy of acquisition.\r\n\r\nInstitutions are generally based on the actual circumstances of\r\nsociety. Lycurgus legislated for a people to whom it was important to\r\nbe able easily to climb steeps, or descend them with a sure foot, to\r\nspring forward also, to run, to bend, and perform innumerable acts of\r\npersonal dexterity. He, therefore, commenced with boyhood the\r\ninculcating of those habits and exercises which their manhood would\r\nimperatively require of them.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that for change of linen an especial aversion was\r\nentertained at Sparta. Children were, therefore, taught to be content\r\nwith one clean shirt per annum, at the termination of which period it\r\nwas probably as well peopled as the Emperor Julian’s beard,\r\nparticularly as, during all that time, it was considered low and\r\nunfashionable to bathe or make use of the ordinary ointments, an\r\nindulgence permitted to them but for a few days in the course of the\r\nyear. All this time, however, they might more properly, perhaps, be\r\nsaid to be shirtless, since the himation only was left them, the\r\nchiton being taken away.[870] They were compelled also, as incipient\r\nsoldiers, to lie hard on pallet beds, made with the tops of reeds\r\ncollected, perfunctorily, without the help of the knife or dagger,\r\nfrom the banks of the Eurotas. To this, as an especial indulgence,\r\nthey were in winter permitted to add a quantity of thistle-down, which\r\nmaterial was supposed to contain much warmth.[871]\r\n\r\nFootnote 870:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lycurg. § 17. Inst. Lac. § 5. Xen. de Rep. Lac. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 871:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Inst. Lac. § 10.\r\n\r\nThe initiation into these accomplishments commenced at the age of\r\ntwelve. At the same time, acting upon the Galenian maxim, that “a fat\r\nstomach makes a lean wit,” the boys were reduced to short commons, the\r\nBouagor, or leader of the juvenile troop, being instructed to pinch\r\nthem as closely as possible on that score, in order that when the\r\nchances of war should reduce them to the necessity of subsisting on\r\nfamine rations, they might be prepared without murmuring to submit to\r\nit. Persons so educated, moreover, would be little delicate in the\r\nchoice of provisions. Anything, from a sea hedgehog to a snail, would\r\nsuit their stomachs; and it would be hard indeed if war could ever\r\nplace them in circumstances where such food as they were accustomed to\r\nmight not be found. Health, too, and light spirits, as Lycurgus well\r\nunderstood, are the offspring of an abstemious diet. The spare\r\nwarrior, clean-limbed and agile, would leap round the man puffed out\r\nand bloated with overfeeding, and, therefore, to be fat was at Sparta\r\nan offence punishable at law.[872] However, not to be too hard on the\r\nyoung gentlemen, it was always permitted, when hunger grew\r\ntroublesome, to have recourse to what, for want of a fitter name, we\r\nmust call stealing.[873]\r\n\r\nFootnote 872:\r\n\r\n  Ælian. V. H. xiv. 7. Plut. Inst. Lac. § 13. Athen. xii. 74.—Apropos\r\n  of this subject, the ancients have left us a very curious anecdote.\r\n  Dionysios, son of Clearchos, the first tyrant of Heraclea, having\r\n  succeeded to the government of his country, became insensibly so\r\n  corpulent by his daily excess and extreme niceness in the choice of\r\n  his viands, that he was nearly suffocated by the enormous mass of\r\n  his fat. Every time he fell into a deep slumber it was feared he\r\n  would never wake again; and, to rouse him from his lethargy, the\r\n  physicians were often compelled to thrust long, sharp needles into\r\n  his body until they reached the quick, upon which he would again\r\n  exhibit signs of animation. Of this prodigious obesity his majesty\r\n  was so much ashamed, however, that, when transacting business or\r\n  giving audience to strangers, he would ensconce himself behind a\r\n  large trunk, so that no part of him was visible but his face. Yet,\r\n  in spite of this infirmity, he lived fifty-five years and reigned\r\n  thirty-three; and, to the honour of corpulence be it remarked, that\r\n  no tyrant ever before exhibited so much mildness and moderation.—Id.\r\n  xii. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 873:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Rep. Lac. ii. 6.—This writer observes, that what might be\r\n  filched was determined by law.—Anab. iv. 6. 14. And Plutarch\r\n  explains, that they might take as much food as they could.—Inst.\r\n  Lac. § 12.\r\n\r\nIn modern times it would be thought a poor compliment to any system of\r\neducation to represent it as an admirable method for rendering a man\r\nan accomplished thief. But the Spartan sophists, whose wisdom Plato,\r\nin a jocular mood, so greatly extols, held a different theory. They\r\ndid not undertake the teaching of morals, but such habits as became a\r\nsoldier, among which thieving always maintains a distinguished place.\r\nXenophon, however, is careful to guard us against the supposition that\r\nthis habit of appropriation arose from want. The object of the\r\nlegislator was, without the incurring of moral guilt, to nourish all\r\nthe useful habits commonly found in a thief,—as, the power to watch by\r\nnight, to wear the mask of honesty by day, craftily to lay snares, and\r\neven to set spies upon the individual to be plundered. To men designed\r\nto spend their lives in war such qualities are, doubtless, of the\r\nhighest importance, since they enable them to procure provisions and\r\noverreach the enemy.[874] To this practice Xenophon alludes in the\r\nAnabasis, where the army is placed in circumstances of much\r\ndifficulty. “I understand,” he says to Cheirisophos, “that among you\r\nLacedæmonians the habit of stealing is carefully cultivated from\r\nchildhood; and that, so far from being disgraceful, it is considered a\r\nnecessary accomplishment, so long as you keep within the bounds\r\nprescribed by law. When detected, however, it is equally lawful to be\r\nscourged.”[875]\r\n\r\nFootnote 874:\r\n\r\n  Xen. de Rep. Lac. ii. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 875:\r\n\r\n  Anab. iv. vi. 14.\r\n\r\nWere they scourged, then, for stealing? Not at all, but simply for\r\nbeing caught; and Xenophon is right in remarking, that, in all human\r\narts, they who unskilfully perform what they undertake are punished,\r\nand so should a bungling thief.[876] The passage immediately following\r\nis mutilated or inextricably corrupt,[877] but, from an attentive\r\nexamination, it would appear that the boys detected on these occasions\r\nwere selected to be flogged[878] during the festival of Artemis\r\nOrthia, or Orthosia, whose altar was thus annually smeared with human\r\nblood. This impartial superstition extended its empire over all ranks\r\nand conditions of men, servile or free, from the beggar to the prince;\r\nfor here, we are told, Helots had sometimes the honour to be scourged\r\nin company perhaps with a scion of the Eurypontid or Agid kings. At\r\nAlea, in Arcadia, women, by the command of an oracle, were subjected\r\nto the same discipline. “Here,” says Pausanias,[879] “during the\r\nfestival of Dionysos women, by command of an oracle, were flogged like\r\nthe youth of Sparta at the altar of Artemis Orthia.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 876:\r\n\r\n  De Rep.

At first, perhaps, they confined themselves\r\nwithin the limits prescribed by law. But almost of necessity they\r\nwould become involved in quarrels with the Helots, by plundering whose\r\nfarms and villages they chiefly subsisted. The Helots would sometimes\r\nresist and sometimes resent their incursions. Ill blood would be\r\nengendered. Hot and fiery youths, abandoned to their own guidance,\r\nwould easily discover excuses for cruelty and revenge. From quarrels\r\nthey would proceed to blows—from blows to assassination; and beaten,\r\nperhaps, by day, they would fall suddenly on the defenceless peasants\r\nin the dead of night, and butcher whole hamlets to avenge an affront\r\noffered to them perhaps by an individual. Thus, out of a custom\r\nblameless enough in its origin, grew the terrible institution of the\r\nCrypteia,[881] or annual massacre of the Helots, denied by some modern\r\nwriters, but too well authenticated, and too much in keeping with the\r\nSpartan character and general policy, to allow of our indulging in any\r\nscepticism on the point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 880:\r\n\r\n  The Platonic Scholiast confounds this practice with the Crypteia, so\r\n  called, he says, because the youth were compelled to conceal\r\n  themselves while they subsisted on plunder. Ἀπολύοντες γὰρ ἕκαστον\r\n  γυμνὸν, προσέταττον ἐνιαυτὸν ὅλον ἔξω ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι πλανᾶσθαι, καὶ\r\n  τρέφειν ἑαυτὸν διὰ κλοπῆς, καὶ τῶν τοιούτων, οὕτω δὲ ὥστε μηδενὶ\r\n  κατάδηλον γενέσθαι· διὸ καὶ κρύπτεια ὠνόμασται· ἐκολάζοντο γὰρ οἱ\r\n  ὅπου δήποτε ὀφθέντες.—Ad Legg. p. 225. Ruhnk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 881:\r\n\r\n  For a fuller account of this institution see Book V. Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to the above, there were other branches of education\r\ntaught at Sparta,—that is gymnastics and music. Writers, desirous of\r\nenhancing the mental acquisitions of the Dorians, adhere somewhat too\r\nstrictly to the meaning often affixed by the Greeks to the word\r\n_music_, which they employed to signify literature. But Xenophon, in\r\nhis treatise on the Lacedæmonian Commonwealth, appears invariably to\r\nuse it in its limited and modern signification.\r\n\r\nTo gymnastics the Dorians, upon the whole an unintellectual people,\r\nwere naturally much addicted,—far too much according to ancient\r\nwriters; but here again their modern historian steps in to their\r\ndefence. He will have it, that it was in later times that they became\r\nphilogymnasts, and quotes Dion Chrysostom as if he was the principal\r\nwitness. Plato, to be sure, is referred to as a parasitical authority,\r\nand so is Aristotle;[882] but then the latter only says, that their\r\nconstant violent exercises rendered them brutal, in which the\r\nhistorian appears to discover no harm. “This want of moderation,\r\nhowever, though it occurred in later times, is never perceivable in\r\nthe maxims and ideas of the Dorians, who in this, as in several other\r\ncases, know how to set bounds to youthful ardour, and check its\r\npernicious effects.”[883] This, it appears to me, is the language of\r\nan apologist. If they had such knowledge, how culpable must they have\r\nbeen not to check it in the matter of the Crypteia?\r\n\r\nFootnote 882:\r\n\r\n  Polit. viii. 3. 3.—To this may be added the testimony of Plato, who\r\n  evidently, without naming them, means to describe the Spartans,\r\n  where he speaks of a people wholly given up to the study of bodily\r\n  exercises, and by that means becoming brutal and ferocious.—De Rep.\r\n  t. vi. p. 154.\r\n\r\nFootnote 883:\r\n\r\n  Dorians, ii. 319. seq.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, however, that though they devoted to gymnastics\r\ntoo much of their leisure, the fault lay in them, not in the system of\r\nexercises, which was in itself one of extreme beauty and simplicity.\r\nIts object,—which it was excellently calculated to attain,—was not to\r\ncreate athletæ but soldiers, not gigantic strength, but an elastic,\r\nagile, beautiful frame, adapted for all the movements of war. Boxing,\r\naccordingly, and the pancration[884] were banished from their\r\ngymnasia, a regulation evincing at the same time their wisdom and\r\ntheir taste; the former being the most barbarous and useless, the\r\nlatter the most unseemly portion of gymnastics, often exhibiting the\r\nantagonists rolling and struggling, like savages or animals devoid of\r\nreason, on the ground.\r\n\r\nFootnote 884:\r\n\r\n  Ταῦτα μόνα μὴ κωλύσαντος ἀγωνίζεσθαι τοὺς πολίτας, ἐν οἷς χεὶρ οὺκ\r\n  ἀνατείνεται.—Plut.

The exercises, in which the\r\n  admission of being vanquished was made by holding up the hand, are\r\n  elsewhere named:—Πυγμὴν δὲ καὶ παγκράτιον ἀγωνίζεσθαι ἐκώλυσεν, ἵνα\r\n  μηδὲ παίζοντες ἀπαυδᾷν ἐθίζωνται.—Reg.

Lycurg. 23.\r\n\r\nAs the ancient idea of education included every thing employed to\r\ndevelope the powers of body or mind, we must regard in this light the\r\nmilitary games peculiar to the Spartans and Cretans.[885] Among the\r\nformer the youth, having sacrificed to Ares in a temple at Therapne,\r\npassed over into an island dyked round and called Platanistas, where,\r\ndividing off into separate parties, they engaged in a contest which\r\nwanted nothing but arms to render it a genuine battle. A learned\r\nhistorian, seldom sparing of words, avoids describing this interesting\r\nscene; and wherefore?—Because a faithful description of it must convey\r\na striking idea of Spartan ferocity. “They exerted” says he, “every\r\nmeans in their power to obtain the victory.”—Exactly; but what were\r\nthose means? “Adolescentium greges Lacedæmone vidimus ipsi indibili\r\ncontentione certantes, pugnis, calcibus, unguibus, morsu denique; quum\r\nexanimarentur priusquam se victos faterentur.[886]” Yet were these\r\nbattles carried on under the eyes of magistrates, the five Bidiæi[887]\r\nappointed to superintend these exercises as well as those performed\r\nelsewhere. The little island where they fought was a spot of great\r\nnatural beauty, encircled by a sheet of clear water, and approached on\r\nall sides through thick and lofty groves of platane trees. A bridge\r\nthrown over the canal led to the island on both sides, and on the one\r\nstood a statue of Heracles, on the other of Lycurgus. This battle was\r\nreckoned among the institutions of the latter, and under the\r\nprotection probably of the former. The preliminaries to the fight were\r\nas follow. They first sacrificed in the Phœbaion which stands without\r\nthe city, not far from Therapne. Here each of the two divisions of the\r\nyouth offered up a dog’s whelp to Ares, the bravest of domestic\r\nanimals, sacred in their opinion to the bravest of the Gods. No other\r\nGrecian people sacrificed the dog excepting the Colophonians, who\r\noffered up a black bitch to Hecate. In both cities the sacrifice was\r\nperformed by night. After the ceremony two tame boars were brought\r\nforward, one by each party, which they compelled to fight; and they\r\nwhose brute champion proved superior, thence augured that victory\r\nawaited them in the Platanistas. On the following day, a little before\r\nnoon, they entered by the bridges into the island, one party by one\r\nbridge, the other by the other. But the choice was not left to them,\r\nhaving been determined on the preceding night by lot. Being arrived,\r\nthey faced each other, and commenced the battle, striking with the\r\nfist, kicking, leaping on each other, tearing one another with their\r\nteeth, and gouging after the most approved Kentucky fashion. Thus they\r\nstruggled, man to man, urging forward together and thrusting each\r\nother into the water.[888] From these words, as well as from the\r\ntestimony of Cicero cited above, it is clear the combat was conducted\r\nwith no other arms than those furnished by nature, though Lucian,\r\nmisemploying the verb ὁπλομάχειν,[889] would lead us to a different\r\nconclusion. But this kind of battle is always enumerated among the\r\ngymnastic exercises or contests; and what necessity would there have\r\nbeen to have recourse to fists, feet, teeth, and nails, had they been\r\npermitted the use of arms? Fatigued with this violent exertion they\r\nbetook themselves for a short time to repose, refreshed by which they\r\nresumed their exercises, dancing in most intricate measures to the\r\nsound of the pipe.[890] Akin in spirit to the contests in the\r\nPlatanistas were the ever-recurring battles fought by the young men\r\nwith the three hundred followers of the Hippagretæ; three inferior\r\nmagistrates appointed by the Ephori, who selected each one hundred\r\nfollowers from among the healthiest and bravest of the youthful\r\npopulation. Against this chosen band all the other young men of the\r\ncity were bound by custom to make war; and, but that they could be\r\nparted by any citizen who might happen to be passing by, it is\r\nprobable that these fierce boxing matches would often have terminated\r\nfatally.\r\n\r\nFootnote 885:\r\n\r\n  Müll. ii. 26.\r\n\r\nFootnote 886:\r\n\r\n  Cic.

Græc. iii. 89. sqq.\r\n\r\nSimilar customs prevailed in Crete, where, as in most other parts of\r\nGreece, the business of education appears to have commenced at the age\r\nof seven years, when the cake called Promachos was given to the boys,\r\nbecause, as it has been conjectured, they were thenceforward to be\r\ntrained for fighting. Up to the age of seventeen they were denominated\r\nApageli, since they were not until then admitted into those Agelæ[891]\r\nor bands, in which they thenceforward performed their exercises. Here,\r\nas in Sparta, the greatest possible care was taken to extirpate from\r\nthe character every germ of effeminacy. They ate whatever food was\r\ngiven them squatting on the ground, not being permitted to join their\r\nelders at the board, and went abroad in all weathers clad in a single\r\ngarment, like the boys of Sparta during their hibernation. However,\r\nthe youth of the several Agelæ, armed with stones, and iron weapons,\r\nmarching to the sound of flutes, and assailing each other, converted\r\ntheir exercises into something very like real warfare. Our\r\ncudgel-playing, single-stick, &c. are pastimes of the same\r\ndescription; and boxing now nearly exploded, can plead classical\r\nprecedent. They were habituated, says Ephoros, to labours and arms,\r\nand taught to despise both heat and cold, rough roads and cliffs, and\r\nthe blows they received in the gymnasium and their mock battles. The\r\nuse of the bow formed part of their education, as well as the armed\r\ndance, at first taught by the Curetes, and afterwards named the\r\nPyrrhic; so that a warlike spirit breathed through the whole system of\r\ntheir education.[892]\r\n\r\nFootnote 891:\r\n\r\n  Ἀγέλη for the boys, συσσίτιον for the men.—Strab. x. 4. p. 379.\r\n  Müll.

Their object, in his opinion, was to obtain something like\r\nideal beauty of form, strength, and health, which, he says, they\r\naccordingly attained, being, about B. C. 540, the healthiest of the\r\nGreeks and most renowned for beautiful men and women. But Xenophon\r\nwhom, on the subject of health he quotes, does not authorise his\r\nsuperlative:—\"It would not be easy,\" are his words, “to find healthier\r\nor more active men.”[893] Again, the language of Herodotus by no means\r\nbears him out. He, indeed, affirms that Callicrates, a Spartan, was\r\nthe handsomest man in the army at Platæa, but says nothing of the\r\nSpartans being handsomer than the other Greeks; but rather the\r\ncontrary. He was not merely the handsomest man among his countrymen,\r\nbut, which he evidently considered more remarkable, among all the\r\nother Greeks.[894]\r\n\r\nFootnote 893:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. Lac. v. 9.—At a later period the reputation of being the\r\n  handsomest men in Greece was enjoyed by certain young men of\r\n  Athens.—Æschin. cont. Tim. § 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 894:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ix. 72.\r\n\r\nNot, however, to insist on such points as these, let us proceed to\r\nexamine the intellectual cultivation of the Dorians.[895] That the art\r\nof writing never flourished very generally at Sparta appears to be on\r\nall hands admitted, though we can by no means doubt that among them\r\nnumerous individuals possessing this accomplishment might always be\r\nfound. Thus, in the old story of the combat of the three hundred\r\nSpartans and Argives, it is related that Othryades, the sole survivor\r\nof the Laconian band, having remained last on the field of battle,\r\nerected a trophy and wrote upon it with his blood Λακεδαιμόνιοι κατ᾽\r\nἈργείων, immediately after which he died of his wounds.[896]\r\nGenerally, however, no great stress was laid on a knowledge of the art\r\nof writing, which, in the opinion of some authors, was of\r\ncomparatively little value where the people were taught to chant their\r\nlaws as well as their songs. Similar customs and regulations prevailed\r\non this head in Crete, where, nevertheless, letters appear to have\r\nbeen viewed with a more favourable eye.[897] In addition to their body\r\nof legal poetry, which was probably less voluminous than a metrical\r\nversion of the statutes at large, the youth were taught to sing hymns\r\nin honour of the gods and the praises of illustrious men.[898] In\r\nmusic, too, they were permitted to make some proficiency, though\r\ngenerally, we are told, it was their ambition to excel rather in the\r\nregularity of their manners than in the extent of their acquirements.\r\n\r\nFootnote 895:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Ælian. Var. Hist. xii. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 896:\r\n\r\n  Stob. Florileg. vii. 67.\r\n\r\nFootnote 897:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Inst. Lac. § 14. seq.—The Spartans sacrificed to the muses\r\n  before going to battle in order that they might perform something\r\n  worthy of notice by them.—Id. § 16. It is remarked of king Cleomenes\r\n  that he studied philosophy under Sphæros the Borysthenite who was\r\n  likewise permitted to impart his system to the other youth.—Id.\r\n  Cleom. § 2.—Cf. Diog. Laert. vii. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 898:\r\n\r\n  In later times learning grew to be more highly valued. Thus it was\r\n  ordained by law that the youth should assemble annually in the Hall\r\n  of the Ephori to hear the work of Dicæarchos on the constitution of\r\n  their country read to them.—Suid. v. Δικαίαρχ. t. i. p. 730. d.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Spartans it is probable, though the testimony of\r\nancient writers be sufficiently contradictory, that no great stress\r\nwas laid even on the ability to read; for, while Plutarch[899]\r\nconceives this art to have been among their ordinary acquirements,\r\nIsocrates, a grave and more competent authority, is decidedly of the\r\nopposite opinion.[900]\r\n\r\nFootnote 899:\r\n\r\n  Inst.

Τοσοῦτον ἀπολελειμμένοι τῆς κοινῆς παιδείας καὶ\r\n  φιλοσοφίας εἰσιν ὥστ᾽ οὐδὲ γράμματα μανθάνουσιν.\r\n\r\nÆlian,[901] too, coming in the rear of Plutarch, observes that the\r\nLacedæmonians were ignorant of mental culture (μουσικῆς) meaning\r\nevidently as Perizonius has already observed, not “music” as Kühn\r\nwould translate it, (for in this they were learned,) but a knowledge\r\nof poetry and eloquence.[902]\r\n\r\nFootnote 901:\r\n\r\n  Var. Hist. xii. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 902:\r\n\r\n  So again in Ælian. Var. Hist. iv. 15. Gelo, king of Syracuse, an\r\n  illiterate person is termed ἄμουσος.\r\n\r\nThat the Spartans were noted for their indifference to literature, is\r\nwell known. Even Xenophon, their apologist, instituting a comparison\r\nbetween their system of education and that prevailing among the other\r\nGreeks, observes that the latter sent their boys to school that they\r\nmight learn their letters, music, and the exercises of the palæstra,\r\nwhile the former placed them under the care of a grave man who might\r\npunish them if slothful and inactive, and inculcate great modesty and\r\nobedience in lieu of the usual accomplishments. Plato also, in the\r\nGreater Hippias,[903] having observed that their laws were averse from\r\nthe reception of foreign learning, adds immediately after that the\r\nmajority of them were even ignorant of arithmetic. In another\r\nplace,[904] indeed, the philosopher appears to hold a different\r\nlanguage, and is literally understood by Perizonius. But the reader\r\nwho examines the passage attentively, will probably agree with me in\r\nconsidering it nothing more than one of those profoundly ironical\r\nstrokes in which, above all writers, he abounds. He in fact remarks,\r\nwhat in another sense may have been very true, that no countries were\r\nmore fertile in sophists than Crete and Lacedæmon, but that they\r\ndissembled their wisdom and feigned ignorance, lest they should appear\r\nto excel all their countrymen in sapience, of which in reality there\r\nwas very little danger. He observes, however, no less ironically, that\r\nthose rude and unrhetorical nations were of all men most philosophical\r\nand eloquent, and that it had long been understood by a great many\r\nthat to _laconise_, or act the Spartan, was rather to be a philosopher\r\nthan a diligent student of gymnastics. Perizonius,[905] indeed,\r\nconceives that all this is to be understood of natural sound sense,\r\napplied to morals and those brief and pithy sayings or λογοὶ, which\r\nconstituted the science of laconics.\r\n\r\nFootnote 903:\r\n\r\n  T. v. p. 418.\r\n\r\nFootnote 904:\r\n\r\n  Protag. t. i. p. 209.\r\n\r\nFootnote 905:\r\n\r\n  Not. ad Ælian. xii. 50.—From an ironical passage of Plato we\r\n  may likewise infer that they were able genealogists and\r\n  story-tellers.—Hipp. Maj. t. v. p. 419.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there never was, as Cicero observes, a single orator\r\namong the Spartans; nor could it be otherwise, since all the arts\r\nwhich beget and foster eloquence, and, more important still, every\r\npolitical institution which favours it, were unknown in their state.\r\nNay, so far did they push their aversion for the oratorical art, that\r\nif any citizen of Sparta acquired, in his experience abroad, the skill\r\nartificially to wield a syllogism or a trope, he was subjected to\r\npunishment,[906] while rhetoricians were expelled the city.[907]\r\nIgnorance, therefore, of whatever learned nations prize, was their\r\nchief boast. To them the sublime speculations of the Academy, and the\r\nlogic, sharp and irresistible, of the Lyceum, were equally strangers;\r\nyet their discipline, and the habits of youth, imparted to them what\r\nin modern jargon is termed a kind of practical “philosophy.” They\r\nunderstood the great art, at least among them, how to command their\r\npassions; as Maximus Tyrius[908] relates of Agesilaos who, though\r\neducated in no school of philosophy, was nevertheless not a slave to\r\nlove, which therefore the sophist infers could not be a matter of\r\ngreat difficulty. However there were limitations to their aversions\r\nfor learning. They opened in their state an asylum for those antique\r\nteachers of mankind, the poets,[909] proscribed by Plato, and were in\r\nthis respect so superior in good taste to that philosopher, that they\r\nat length, in imitation of the Great Preceptors of Greece, instituted\r\npublic recitations of Homer. And this, Maximus Tyrius adduces as a\r\nproof that many well-constituted states had existed in which Homer was\r\nnot publicly studied, for he could not mean that he was once entirely\r\nunknown at Sparta.[910]\r\n\r\nFootnote 906:\r\n\r\n  The laws of Sparta were in this respect, as in many others, merely\r\n  imitations of those of Crete.—Sext.

Athen. xiv. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 910:\r\n\r\n  Dissert. vii. p. 91.\r\n\r\nInto the character of the Greeks, generally, there entered an element\r\nbut faintly discernible in the moral composition of modern nations, I\r\nmean a most exquisite and exalted sensibility, which rendered them to\r\nthe last degree susceptible, and liable to be swayed irresistibly for\r\ngood or for evil by poetry and music. And this characteristic\r\ndistinguished in some degree the Doric as well as the Ionic race. They\r\ncould be excited, past belief, by the agency of sound. Music,\r\ntherefore, with us at least a mere source of enjoyment, among them was\r\ninvested with a moral character, and employed in education as a\r\npowerful means of harmonising, purifying, ennobling the principles and\r\nthe affections of the heart. For this reason the government, which in\r\nGreece was in reality a Committee of Public Safety,[911] watched over\r\nthe music no less sedulously than over the morals of the people, which\r\nit powerfully influenced. It must, nevertheless, be confessed that\r\nmany ancient authors are little philosophical in relating or reasoning\r\nupon the effects of music. They often confound consequences with\r\ncauses. Thus, in the example which certain authors undoubtingly adduce\r\nof the Sicilian Dorians,[912] whose morals we are told were corrupted\r\nby their fiddlesticks, they omit to inquire whether it was not rather\r\nthe natural and necessary degeneracy of a wealthy people, which\r\ncorrupted the music. This is my interpretation. For, in the history of\r\nthe ancient Sicilians, I can discover causes enough of lax and\r\nimperfect morals, without calling in the aid of lyre or cithara. But\r\nsome writers on this point have an easy faith. They suppose that the\r\nstrict domestic discipline of Sparta “would hardly have been\r\npreserved”[913] without the old-fashioned music.\r\n\r\nFootnote 911:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Inst. Lac. § 17.\r\n\r\nFootnote 912:\r\n\r\n  Max. Tyr. iv. p. 54. Cic. de Legg. ii. 15.—Cicero, though apt in\r\n  most cases to defer to the opinion of Plato, hangs back here. He\r\n  does not, indeed, consider it a matter of indifference what songs\r\n  are sung, or what airs prevail in a state; but neither does he\r\n  credit the inferences drawn too subtilely by the great philosopher\r\n  from his musical theory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 913:\r\n\r\n  Dorians. ii. 340.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way we decide on the metaphysics of the matter, certain it\r\nis that in old times music was an universal accomplishment in most\r\nparts of Greece; but this was when it was little more than the\r\nchanting of savages, in which, however ignorant, any one may join.\r\nExactly in proportion as it rose into an art its cultivators\r\ndiminished in number, until, when a high degree of perfection had been\r\nattained, it was abandoned almost wholly to professional musicians.\r\nThe Athenians had been commanded by the Pythian oracle to chant\r\nchorically in the streets, a divine service in honour of Bacchos.[914]\r\nAt Sparta similar performances took place during the gymnopædia, when\r\nchoruses of naked men and boys, with crowns of palm leaves on their\r\nheads, proceeded through the streets singing the songs of Thaletas and\r\nAlcman and the pæans of Dionysidotos.[915] Mr. Müller, who loves to\r\ncomplete or round off the accounts he finds in ancient authors, says\r\nthat, _doubtless_, a large portion of the inhabitants of the city took\r\npart in these exhibitions. Perhaps they did, but we have no authority\r\nfor such a supposition. The place in the agora which contained statues\r\nof Apollo, Artemis and Leto, was called _Choros_,[916] because there\r\nthe Ephebi danced in choruses in honour of Apollo. On these occasions\r\nunwarlike persons were sometimes thrust into the least honourable\r\nplaces,[917] while bachelors were excluded; so that, as Schneider has\r\nwell remarked, cowardice was less dishonourable than celibacy. But it\r\ndoes not at all appear that the Spartans themselves were ever good\r\nmusicians, though they were not incapable of relishing good\r\nmusic;[918] and hence the foreign musicians who flocked thither found\r\na welcome reception. The developement of the warlike constitution of\r\nthe state threw the favourable side of their discipline into the\r\nshade.[919]\r\n\r\nFootnote 914:\r\n\r\n  Demosth. in Mid. § 15.\r\n\r\nFootnote 915:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xv. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 916:\r\n\r\n  Paus. iii. 11. 9.—Müller, ii. 341., supposes the whole agora may\r\n  have been thus denominated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 917:\r\n\r\n  Xen. de Rep.

Dor. ii. 342.\r\n\r\nThe Arcadians, likewise, made great use of music in their system of\r\neducation, and, though otherwise a rude race, continued to practise it\r\nup to the age of thirty. Among them alone, in fact, were children\r\naccustomed from infancy to sing, in certain measures, hymns and poems,\r\nin which they celebrated the praises of the gods and heroes of their\r\ncountry. After this, observes Polybius,[920] they learned the _nomoi_\r\nof Timotheus and Philoxenos, and every year during the Dionysia formed\r\nchoruses in the theatre, where they danced to the sound of the flute.\r\nHere boys contended with antagonists of their own age, and the young\r\nmen with those more advanced towards their prime. During the whole of\r\ntheir lives they frequented these public assemblies, where they\r\ninstructed each other by their songs, and not by means of foreign\r\nactors. With respect to other branches of education they considered it\r\nno disgrace to profess themselves ignorant; but not to know how to\r\nsing would, in Arcadia, have been a mark of extreme vulgarity. They\r\nhabituated themselves to walk with gravity to the sound of the flute,\r\nand, having been thus instructed at the expense of the state,\r\nproceeded once a year in public procession to the theatre. Their\r\nancestors introduced these customs, not with any view to pleasure, or\r\nthat they might grow rich by the exercise of their talents, but in\r\norder to soften the austerity of character which their cold and murky\r\natmosphere would otherwise have engendered. For the character of\r\nnations is invariably analogous to the air they breathe, and it is the\r\ngeographical position of races which determines alone their temper of\r\nmind and the colour and configuration of their bodies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 920:\r\n\r\n  iv. 20. 7. Athen. xiv. 21. seq.\r\n\r\nBesides what has already been said of the Arcadians, it may be added,\r\nthat it was customary among them for the men and women to unite in\r\nchanting certain odes, and to offer up sacrifices in common. There\r\nwere also dances in which the youth of both sexes joined, and their\r\nobject was to create and diffuse humane and gentle manners.\r\n\r\nBut the same habits were not prevalent throughout the whole country.\r\nThe Kynæthes made no progress in these humanising arts, and as they\r\ndwelt in the rudest districts of Arcadia, and breathed the crudest\r\nair, their ferocity became proverbial; they addicted themselves to\r\nstrife and contention, and degenerated into the fiercest and most\r\nuntameable savages in Greece. In fact, obtaining possession of several\r\ncities, they shed so much blood that the whole nation was roused, and\r\nat length united in expelling them the land. Even after their\r\ndeparture the Mantinæans thought it necessary to purify the soil by\r\nsacrifices, expiations, and the leading of victims round the whole\r\nboundary line.\r\n\r\nDancing very naturally constituted a separate branch of education at\r\nSparta as in Crete. In both places the execution of the Pyrrhic\r\nappears to have been regarded as a necessary accomplishment, the\r\nyouths, from the age of fifteen or earlier, having been taught to\r\nperform it in arms.[921] It was or is—for the Pyrrhic still lingers in\r\nGreece,\r\n\r\n                 “Ye have the Pyrrhic dance as yet—”\r\n\r\nan exhibition purely military. The dancers, accoutred with spear and\r\nshield, went gracefully and vigorously through a number of movements,\r\nwheeling, advancing, giving blows or shunning them, as in real\r\naction.[922] In other parts of Greece, however, the Pyrrhic quickly\r\ndegenerated in character, becoming little better than a wild dance of\r\nBacchanals.[923] It has been rightly observed that at Sparta “the\r\nchief object of the Gymnopædia was to represent gymnastic exercises\r\nand dancing in intimate union, and, indeed, the latter only as the\r\naccomplishment and end of the former.”[924] One of the dances,\r\nresembling the Anapale, partook of a Bacchanalian character.”[925] The\r\nyouth, also, when skilled in these exercises, danced in rows behind\r\neach other to the music of flutes, both military and choral dances, at\r\nthe same time, repeating an invitation in verse to Aphrodite and Eros\r\nto join them, and an exhortation to each other.[926]\r\n\r\nFootnote 921:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 29.—The armed dance was in particular favour with\r\n  Plato.—De Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 17. Boys danced in armour during\r\n  the Panathenaia at Athens.—Sch. Aristoph. Nub. 935.\r\n\r\nFootnote 922:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 54.\r\n\r\nFootnote 923:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 924:\r\n\r\n  Müll.

Herod. i. 230.\r\n\r\nFootnote 926:\r\n\r\n  Lucian de Saltat. § 10. seq.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above details that the object of education at\r\nSparta was rather the formation of habits and the disciplining of the\r\nmind to act in exact conformity with the laws, than to develope to\r\ntheir fullest extent the intellectual powers of individuals. They\r\ndesired to amalgamate the whole energies of the people into one mass,\r\nupon the supposition that being thus impelled in any particular\r\ndirection they would prove irresistible. No account was made of\r\nprivate happiness. Everything seems to have been devised for the\r\neffecting of national purposes, though from the known laws of the\r\nhuman mind even the restraint and tyrannical interference of such a\r\nsystem would with time be reconciled to the feelings and contribute to\r\nindividual content. But very much of what renders life sweet, was\r\nsacrificed. Letters and arts, that subordinate creation, that world\r\nwithin a world which the beneficence of Providence has permitted man\r\nto call into existence, were at Sparta unknown. They enjoyed little or\r\nnothing of that refined delight which arises from multiplying the\r\nalmost conscious fruits of the soul, from sending winged thoughts\r\nabroad to move, enchant, electrify millions, from deifying truth and\r\nconfounding error, from ascending to the greatest heights of\r\nmortality, and diffusing from thence a light and a glory to warm and\r\nilluminate and gladden the human race for ever. This greater felicity\r\nwas reserved for the education of Athens, which must, therefore, in\r\nall enlightened times, bear away the palm of excellence and utility.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE FINE ARTS ON EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nIt behoves us now to quit the circle of studies, which, taken\r\ntogether, are commonly supposed to constitute the whole of education,\r\nand consider the influence exercised by other elements on the minds of\r\nthe Hellenic youth. Even in these days we speak intelligibly and\r\ncorrectly of that experience which young men gain on their first\r\nentrance into life, from travel and fashionable society, as of a\r\nparticular stage in their education, it being during that period that\r\nthey learn to estimate the value of their school acquirements, how\r\nadvantageously to conceal or display them according to circumstances,\r\nand to bend the neck, perchance, of their lofty theories and sublime\r\nspeculations to the yoke of the world. But in Greece this was more\r\npalpably the case; for, though escaped from the formal rule of\r\npreceptors and pædagogues, the youth had still to master several\r\ndepartments of study, either by their own independent exertions or\r\nunder the guidance of judicious friends: I mean those infinitely\r\nvaried creations of art and literature, which, as they are in harmony\r\nwith them or otherwise, confirm or subvert the principles and\r\ndiscipline of the schools.\r\n\r\nThoroughly to comprehend, therefore, the nature and extent of that\r\nsway which the state and its institutions directly or indirectly\r\nexerted over the minds of the citizens, it is necessary briefly to\r\ninquire into the character of the plastic and mimetic arts which found\r\nencouragement in the Grecian commonwealths, and afterwards to examine\r\nfor a moment the stores of thought and sentiment and passion, and\r\npiety and virtue, which the literature and religion of Greece laid\r\nopen to the contemplation of those who were entering upon the career\r\nof life. We shall begin with the arts, as they were the inculcators of\r\nthe principle of the beautiful, advance next to literature, the\r\nteacher of wisdom and patriotism, concluding with religion, which\r\nopened up to their view a prospect, though dim, of heaven, and\r\ndirected their footsteps thitherward.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, to the generality, the vast superiority of the\r\nGreeks in the arts, which like an universal language need no\r\ntranslation, is more palpable and apparent than their superiority in\r\nliterature; though Demosthenes be in reality as much above any orator,\r\nThucydides above any historian, Plato above any philosopher, Homer\r\nabove any epic poet, Milton perhaps excepted, who has since written,\r\nas Pheidias, or Polycletos, or Praxiteles rose above any sculptor of\r\nthe north. Nor can we account for this any more than we can explain\r\nwhy Shakespeare was superior to Ford or Massinger. Nature infused more\r\ngenius into their souls. They loved or rather worshiped the beautiful.\r\nIt breathed within and around them: their minds were pregnant with it,\r\nand, when they brought forth, beauty was their offspring. Thus\r\nAristophanes[927] insinuates, that even the gods borrowed much of\r\ntheir majesty and splendour from the human mind, when he says, that\r\nheaven-born peace derived her loveliness from some relationship to\r\nPheidias.\r\n\r\nFootnote 927:\r\n\r\n  Pac. 614. seq.\r\n\r\nReligion, in one sense, may be called the parent of the fine arts; but\r\nit would perhaps be more philosophical to consider religion and the\r\narts as twin sisters, both sprung from that yearning after the ideal\r\nwhich constituted the most marked feature in the Hellenic mind. We\r\nmust carry back our investigations very far, if we would discover them\r\nradiant with loveliness in their cradle; but when they issued thence\r\nit was to shed light over the earth, a light derived from the skies.\r\nFor man does not originate his ideas of the beautiful, which fall like\r\nimages from heaven on the speculum of his mind; he gives back but what\r\nhe receives. The conception of beauty is an inspiration, a thing which\r\ndoes not come when called upon; or rather, shining on all, it is lost\r\non the dull and opaque fancy, and is reflected only from the luminous\r\nand bright.\r\n\r\nMan needs companionship always, and the creative and imaginative make\r\nto themselves companions of their own ideas, and clothe them in\r\nmaterial forms to render the illusion more complete. There is an\r\nimpassioned intercourse between the soul and its offspring. We love\r\nnothing like that which has sprung from ourselves, and in this we are\r\ntruly the image of God, who saw all things that he had made, and,\r\nbehold, they were very good. And he loved his creation; and from him\r\nwe inherit, as his children, the love we bear to our creations. Hence\r\nthe enthusiasm for art, hence the power and the inspiration of poetry.\r\nThey are not things of earth. They are the seeds of immortality\r\nripening prematurely here below; and therefore we should love them.\r\nThey are the warrant, the proof that we are of God; that we are born\r\nto exercise an irresistible sway over the elements; that our thrones\r\nare building elsewhere; that in the passion for whatever is spiritual\r\nwe exhibit instinctively indubitable tokens that spirits we are, and\r\nin a spiritual world only can find our home.\r\n\r\nIt does not belong to this work to attempt a history of Grecian art,\r\nwhich in a certain sense has been already written. My object, if I can\r\naccomplish it, is to describe the spirit by which that art was created\r\nand sustained, and this I should do triumphantly if love were\r\nsynonymous with power; for never, since the fabled artist hung\r\nenamoured over the marble he had fashioned, did any man’s imagination\r\ncleave more earnestly to the spirit that presided over Grecian art,\r\nnot the plastic merely but every form of it, from the epic in poetry\r\nand sculpture down to the signet ring and the drinking song. But the\r\nthing is an ample apology for the enthusiasm. There, if anywhere, we\r\ndiscover the culminating point of human intellect and human\r\ngenius;—there\r\n\r\n                 “The vision and the faculty divine”\r\n\r\nmeet us at every step. Even the fragments of her literature and her\r\nart are gathered up and treasured in all civilised countries, as if\r\nthe fate of our race were mystically bound up in them. And so it is:\r\nfor when we cease to love the beautiful, of which they are the most\r\nperfect realisation we know, our own race of glory and greatness will\r\nhave been run: we shall be close on the verge, nay, within the pale of\r\nbarbarism.\r\n\r\nSocrates used to say, that whatever we know we can explain; but not so\r\nalways with what we feel. There is in the ideal of beauty, which\r\nformed the vivifying principle of Greek art, a certain subtile and\r\nfugitive delicacy, a certain nameless grace, a certain volatile and\r\nfleeting essence, which defy definition, and, rejecting the aid of\r\nlanguage, persist in presenting themselves naked to the mind. And by\r\nthe mind only, and only, moreover, by the inspired mind, can they be\r\ndiscerned.\r\n\r\nIt was in the attempt, however, to chain this spirit, and to imprison\r\nit in durable forms, that all the poetry and arts of Greece consisted.\r\nThey beheld within them a world of loveliness, of living forms which\r\nknocked at the golden door of fancy, and demanded their dismissal from\r\nthe spiritual to the material universe. All their studies were but how\r\nto dress these celestial habitants in fitting habiliments to go abroad\r\nin; and their lives were often spent in the throes of creatures big\r\nwith immortal beauty. It is a privilege to the world to converse with\r\nminds of such a nature. It is ennobling to approach them. Their\r\nenergy, their vivifying power continues ever active, ever operating,\r\nand if high art be ever to flourish and command, not admiration, but\r\nlove in England, it can only be by kindling here the lamp removed from\r\nGreece, but essentially Greek, that is, essentially beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe proof that religion issued with art from the same womb in Greece,\r\nand was not its parent, is supplied by every other country. There is\r\nreligion elsewhere, while nowhere is there art like that of the\r\nGreeks. But religion had nevertheless much to do with the forms in\r\nwhich the creative faculty there developed itself, as it invariably\r\nhas with whatever is great or beautiful among men. The persuasion\r\narose in them that the inhabitants of Olympos could be represented by\r\nmaterial forms, and as they found their own reverence for the divine\r\nbeing represented, augment in proportion to the beauty or grandeur of\r\nits image, the conclusion was natural that the deity himself would be\r\npleased by the same rule, so that their piety was their first and most\r\npowerful incentive to excellence. They hoped to recommend themselves\r\nto the gods, as they did to their countrymen, by the greatness of\r\ntheir workmanship; and veneration from without, and piety from within,\r\nunited in urging them forward. And this, with the poet equally as with\r\nthe artist, inflamed the desire to excel.\r\n\r\nThere are, as has already been observed,[928] three periods in the\r\nhistory of art: 1st. that, in which the necessary is sought; 2ndly,\r\nthat in which the study of the beautiful is pursued; and 3dly, the\r\nperiod of superfluity and extravagance. But in some countries men\r\nappear to pass from the first to the third, without traversing the\r\nsecond. Thus, in Egypt, Persia, Etruria, in Germany, Holland, France,\r\nEngland[929] the wild, the grotesque, the terrible have been aimed at,\r\nseldom the beautiful. Even in Italy, where in modern times art has\r\ntaken firmest root and most luxuriantly flourished, the object sought\r\nto be attained has lain on a lower level. Among the northern nations\r\nthe grotesque variously disguised or modified is the spirit of art;\r\namong the Italians it is voluptuousness, among the Greeks the\r\nbeautiful. Hence no Greek statue of the flourishing period of art is\r\nindecent.[930] Naked it may be, but like the nakedness of infancy, it\r\nis chaste as a mother’s love. Our thoughts are instantly carried away\r\nby it to the regions of poetry; the soft influence of the ideal\r\ndescends like dew upon our fancy; we are elevated above the region of\r\nthe passions to heights where all is sunny and calm and pure. The\r\nbeautiful is chaste as an icicle, yet warm as love. It breathes in\r\nRaffaelle’s virgins which we regard as some “bright particular star,”\r\nthings to inspire a holy affection, a love not akin to earth. Yet this\r\nbeauty is not distanced from us by its severity: no! but by its\r\nintense innocence, by its unsullied purity, by its inexpressible\r\nconcentration and mingling up of maternity and girlhood. It was this\r\nbeauty that Milton sought in his Comus to express, when he represents\r\nchastity as its own guard. And this is preëminently the spirit\r\nbreathing through Grecian art. In the Artemis, in the Athena, nay,\r\neven in Aphrodite or Leda, or an orgiastic Bacchante, the overruling\r\nsense of beauty, after the first flutter of sensation, hurries the\r\nimagination far beyond all considerations of sex or passion. The root\r\nof all the pleasures we feel, seems to be hidden under the load of\r\nthree thousand years, not because the things are old, but because they\r\nare the material representatives of a period when the foot of the\r\nbeautiful rested on the earth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 928:\r\n\r\n  By Winkelmann, Hist. de l’Art, i. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 929:\r\n\r\n  It is remarked by Winkelmann that Rubens painted the figures of\r\n  Flemings after many years’ residence in Italy.—i. 60. The Greek grew\r\n  up from infancy in the presence of the beauty he afterwards\r\n  represented: his mother, his sisters, his father, and all around\r\n  him. What he saw constituted the basis of what he painted or\r\n  sculptured. In most modern nations the school models of our youth\r\n  are Greek; but their home models, and which are to them models from\r\n  the cradle, are of a different style. Hence they are under two sets\r\n  of influences, the one neutralising the other, and producing that\r\n  coldness which the mock classical exhibits. This may, perhaps, be\r\n  one cause of the slow progress of art among us.\r\n\r\nFootnote 930:\r\n\r\n  Plato, jocularly perhaps, bestows the same praise on Egyptian art,\r\n  and Muretus seriously adopts his notions: “Meritoque Ægyptios\r\n  commendat Plato, apud quos et pictorum et musicorum licentia legibus\r\n  coërcebatur, quod permagni interesse judicarent, ut adolescentes à\r\n  teneris annis honestis picturis, et honestis cantibus\r\n  assuefierent.”—In Aristot. Ethic. p. 249. But perhaps Plato had not\r\n  looked very narrowly into the sacred sculptures of Egypt which in\r\n  reality abound with images offensive to decency.\r\n\r\nNo doubt we come prepared to regard them with eyes coloured, and a\r\nfancy haunted by the beauties of Grecian literature. Possibly, it is\r\nunder the spell of Homeric verse that our eyes grow humid with delight\r\nat the aspect of Aphrodite, that we behold divinity in Zeus or Phœbos\r\nApollo; but this only proves that the fragments of Hellenic\r\ncivilisation throw a light upon each other, and are parts of one great\r\nwhole. Perhaps, too, no man ever enjoyed the sculpture of Greece as he\r\nshould, unless conversant with her poetry—the right hand of her art.\r\nIn this we find the first seeds and increments of those ideas, which\r\nwere afterwards transplanted and bore fruit in another field. We\r\ndiscover, therefore, but half the subject when we see only the\r\nsculpture. It is unknown to us whether the artist has fulfilled the\r\nconditions into which he entered, by undertaking to clothe in marble,\r\nthoughts already invested with the forms of language. Hence the little\r\nsympathy between Hellenic art and the people generally of modern\r\nnations. The figures they behold are dumb to them. To a Greek, on the\r\ncontrary, or to a man with a Greek’s soul, a thousand sweet\r\nreminiscences, a thousand legends, a thousand dim but cherished\r\nassociations appear clustering round them. Every time they flash upon\r\nhim, he lives his youth over again. The briery nook, the dewy lanes,\r\nthe dim religious forests, the pebbly or wave-fretted shore, where the\r\npoetry of Greece first opened its eyes upon him in boyhood, sweep in\r\nprocession over his fancy. He starts to see the hamadryad or the faun\r\nor the mountain nymph, before him but one remove from life; to him art\r\nspeaks not merely in an intelligible, but in an impassioned tongue. He\r\ncomprehends all the mysteries she has to reveal, and loves her because\r\nin a land as it were of foreigners they can converse with each other,\r\nand speak of the past and the future.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely philosophical to regard poetry, sculpture, and\r\npainting, as the offspring of pleasure, though pleasure in some sense\r\nbe as necessary to man as food. Man possesses creative and imitative\r\nfaculties, and must, at certain stages of society, employ them. The\r\nmoment his merely animal wants are provided for, he begins to feel\r\nthat he has others which demand no less imperiously their\r\ngratification. First, he desires to clothe with material forms the\r\nthings he worships, and hence the first-born of art are gods. At the\r\noutset, indeed, (and this is a strong argument against their having\r\nborrowed their arts from the East,)[931] the Greeks were content with\r\nsetting up rude stones, as symbols rather than representations of\r\ntheir divinities; then followed the head upon a rude pillar; then, the\r\nindications of the sex; next, the round thighs began to swell out of\r\nthe stone; to these succeeded legs and feet; and, lastly, arms and\r\nhands completed the figure. Dædalos, a mythological personage, is\r\nsupposed to have been the first who carried the art to this point of\r\nimprovement. His figures were of wood, and already executed with\r\nconsiderable skill, though they would have been despised in the days\r\nof Socrates.[932]\r\n\r\nFootnote 931:\r\n\r\n  See Winkel. t. i. p. 7.—Pollux gives a list of the names under which\r\n  the representations of the gods were classed.—i. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 932:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Repub. t. vi. p. 354. Cf. Hipp. Maj. t. v. p.\r\n  410.—Winkelmann slightly misinterprets the sense of Plato.—Hist. de\r\n  l’Art, t. i. p. 12.\r\n\r\nFor some ages, perhaps, a stiff, unanimated manner, not unlike the\r\nEgyptian, prevailed; but the impulse, once given, went on increasing\r\nin strength. One improvement imperceptibly followed another. Artists,\r\ntogether with their experience, acquired professional learning, the\r\nresults of which soon became visible in their productions. Movement\r\nand variety of position succeeded. But though knowledge of art was\r\nenlarged and strict rules laid down, there still remained a hard,\r\nsquare massiveness in the style, resembling what we find in modern\r\nsculpture as improved by Michael Angelo. And this manner became the\r\ntype of the Æginetan school, which expressed the character of the\r\nDoric mind, powerful but rude, harmonious but heavy, wanting in grace,\r\nwanting in elegance, and aiming rather at effect than beauty.[933]\r\n\r\nFootnote 933:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Winkelmann, t. i. p. 22.\r\n\r\nNumerous causes, however, concurred in ripening the principle of art\r\nin Greece,—the climate, the form of government, the happy taste of the\r\npeople, and, lastly, the high respect which was there paid to artists.\r\nNor is it at all paradoxical to affirm, that moral causes concurred\r\npowerfully with physical, in begetting that radiant beauty of\r\ncountenance which distinguished the nation. The consciousness of\r\nfreedom and independence produces satisfaction in the mind; the\r\nserenity thus originated communicates itself to the features; thence\r\narise harmony and dignity of aspect and mien; these are so many\r\nelements of beauty, and such feelings long indulged would operate\r\npowerfully on the countenance, and, seconded by the tranquillising\r\ninfluences of external nature, end by creating symmetry and\r\nproportion, which, joined with intellect, are beauty. Artists in such\r\na country, besides that they must themselves involuntarily be\r\nimpressed with a veneration for it, would soon discover the reverence\r\npaid to beauty and the value set upon accurate representations of it.\r\n\r\nOf the high estimation in which beauty was held innumerable proofs\r\nexist in Greek literature. At Ægion in Achaia, the priest of Zeus was\r\nchosen for the splendour of his personal charms, to determine which a\r\nsort of contest was instituted. This office he held till his beard\r\nbegan to appear, when the honour passed to the youth then judged to\r\nexcel[934] in the perfection of his form. So, also, at Tanagra, the\r\nyouth selected to bear the lamb round the walls in honour of Hermes\r\nwas supposed to be the first for beauty in the city.[935] Of the\r\ninvoluntary power of beauty history has recorded various instances.\r\nPhrynè, accused of impiety and on the point of being condemned,\r\nobtained her acquittal through the hardihood of her advocate, who\r\nbared her bosom before the judges. Another example is said to have\r\nbeen afforded by Corinna, sole poetess of Tanagra, who, contending\r\nwith Pindar for the prize of verse, obtained the victory more by her\r\nbeauty, (she being the loveliest woman of her time,) and the sweetness\r\nof the Æolic dialect in which she wrote, than by the greatness of her\r\ngenius.[936]\r\n\r\nFootnote 934:\r\n\r\n  Paus. vii. 24. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 935:\r\n\r\n  Id. ix. 22. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 936:\r\n\r\n  Id. ix. 22. 3.\r\n\r\nIn another instance heroic honours were paid to a man after death for\r\nthe beauty of his person.[937] This happened at Egestum in Sicily,\r\nwhere Philippos, a native of Crotona, obtained this distinction, which\r\nHerodotus observes never fell to any other man’s lot before.[938]\r\n\r\nFootnote 937:\r\n\r\n  Euripides, speaking of course as a poet, pronounces beauty to be\r\n  worthy of supreme power. But many ancient nations were seriously of\r\n  this mind, and chose the finest person among them to be their king:\r\n  which was the practice of those Ethiopians called the\r\n  Immortals.—Athen. xiii. 20. If by Ethiopians be meant the people now\r\n  known under the name of Nubians, I am sure they had very good reason\r\n  to encourage beauty, than which there is, at this day, nothing more\r\n  rare in their country.\r\n\r\nFootnote 938:\r\n\r\n  V. 47.\r\n\r\nIt was to its artists that Greece delegated, at least in some\r\ninstances, the privilege of deciding on the rival pretensions of the\r\nfair and beautiful. They were permitted to select from the loveliest\r\nwomen of the land models for their female divinities, and at other\r\ntimes made their mistresses the representatives of goddesses. Pains\r\nwere taken, by filling their apartments with beautiful statues, to\r\nimpress upon the imagination of pregnant women the perfect forms of\r\ngods and heroes, as of Nireus, Narcissos, Hyacinthos, Castor and\r\nPolydeukes, Bacchos and Apollo.[939] This was at Sparta. In other\r\nparts of the Peloponnesos a species of Olympic contest for the prize\r\nof beauty took place, instituted, it is said, by Cypselos, an ancient\r\nking of Arcadia. Having founded a city in the plain on the banks of\r\nthe Alpheios, in which he fixed a colony of Parrhasians, he dedicated\r\na temple and altar, and instituted a festival in honour of Eleusinian\r\nDemeter, during which the women of the neighbourhood disputed with\r\neach other the prize, and received from some circumstance connected\r\nwith the contest the name of Chrysophoræ. The first woman who won was\r\nHerodice, wife of the founder Cypselos. This institution flourished\r\nupwards of fourteen hundred years, having been established in the time\r\nof the Heracleidæ, and still existing in the age of Athenæus.[940]\r\n\r\nFootnote 939:\r\n\r\n  Opian. Cyneg. i. 357. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 940:\r\n\r\n  Deipnosoph. xiii. 90. Eustath. ad Il. τ. 282. relates briefly the\r\n  same facts, concluding with the very words made use of by Athenæus.\r\n  Palmerius, who, in his remarks on Diogenes Laertius quotes them,\r\n  immediately adds: “quæ non dubito Eustathiun ab aliquo auctore\r\n  antiquo accepisse.”—Exercit. in Auct. Græc. p. 448. In which\r\n  conjecture he was right; and that ancient author was Nicias in his\r\n  history of Arcadia.\r\n\r\nA similar practice prevailed in the islands of Tenedos and Lesbos,\r\nwhere likewise the ebullitions of vanity were concealed beneath the\r\nveil of religion. The exhibition took place in the temple of Hera, to\r\nwhom, as the goddess of marriage, beauty should be dear. Priapos,\r\nhowever, was in some places supposed to be the deity who awarded the\r\nprize of loveliness in the Callisteia, on which account Niconoë, a\r\nBacchante perhaps, dedicated to him her fawn-skin and golden\r\newer.[941] But the ladies were not singular in these displays. For\r\namong the Eleians, who had as favourable an opinion of themselves as\r\nOliver Goldsmith, a similar show took place, and the pretensions of\r\nthe male candidates were as carefully sifted as if they had been to\r\ntake academical honours on their figures. And honours in fact they did\r\ntake. They were presented with a complete suit of armour, which the\r\nwinner consecrated with extraordinary pomp and rejoicing in the temple\r\nof Athena, whither he was led garlanded with fillets by his triumphant\r\nfriends. According to Myrsilos, he was likewise decorated with a\r\nmyrtle crown.[942]\r\n\r\nFootnote 941:\r\n\r\n  Schol. ad Il. ι. 129. Cf. Meurs. Gr. Fer. p. 177. Hedyl. in Anth.\r\n  Gr. vi. 292. Athen. xiii. 90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 942:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 90.\r\n\r\nIn some places, not named by historians, a contest was instituted\r\nwhich, though unconnected with the arts, we will intreat the reader’s\r\npermission to introduce here, for its extraordinary nature. This was a\r\ncontest in prudence and good housewifery, in which certain barbarian\r\nnations followed the example. And, to show that character and mental\r\nqualifications were properly esteemed by the Greeks, it is added by\r\nTheophrastos[943] that it is these that render beauty beautiful, and\r\nthat without them it is apt to degenerate into wantonness. Winkelmann,\r\nwho has noticed several of these facts, is betrayed into some errors.\r\nHe speaks of an Apollo of Philesia[944] at whose festival a prize was\r\nbestowed on the youth who excelled in kissing. The contest took place\r\nunder the inspection of a judge, he supposes, at Megara. Meursius,\r\nthough under the name of Diocleia he notices the Megarean festival,\r\noverlooks the writer who gives the fullest account of it;—I mean the\r\nscholiast on Theocritus, who observes that Diocles was an Athenian\r\nexile who took refuge at Megara. In a battle in which he was engaged,\r\nhe fought side by side with a friend, whose life he saved at the\r\nexpense of his own. He was interred by the Megareans, who instituted\r\nan annual festival in his honour, where the youth who excelled his\r\ncompanions was crowned and led in triumph to the arms of his\r\nmother.[945]\r\n\r\nFootnote 943:\r\n\r\n  Ap. Athen. xiii. 90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 944:\r\n\r\n  Lutat. ad Stat. Theb. viii. 178. Cf. Barth. iii. 828. Hist. de\r\n  l’Art, i. 319. Carlo Fea with a simplicity rare in an Italian,\r\n  remarks upon this: “Il est question ici de baise-mains!” The Apollo\r\n  intended is Apollo Philesias, whose statue was sculptured in\r\n  Æginetic marble by Canachos.—Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 19. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 945:\r\n\r\n  Sch. in Theocrit. xii. 28.\r\n\r\nThe exercises, discipline, and moral notions of the Greeks had\r\ndoubtless much effect on their form; for in the decline of their\r\nstates, when despotism had succeeded to freedom, and vice to virtue,\r\nbeauty became exceedingly rare. Cotta, in the De Naturâ Deorum,\r\nobserves that he found few handsome youths at Athens, where in the age\r\nof Demosthenes the most beautiful in Greece flourished;[946] and Dion\r\nChrysostom observes that in his time there were scarcely any that\r\ncould be so considered.[947]\r\n\r\nFootnote 946:\r\n\r\n  Æschin. cont. Tim. § 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 947:\r\n\r\n  Orat. 21. t. 1. p. 500. sqq. Reiske.\r\n\r\nIf we come now to the other causes which account for the progress of\r\nthe arts in Greece, we shall find the principal of these to have been\r\nthe high consideration and esteem[948] in which artists were held.\r\nRiches, no doubt, obtained credit there as elsewhere, but not to the\r\nexclusion of other recommendations as in modern Europe, or at least in\r\nEngland. Winkelmann scarcely comprehends the irony of Socrates,\r\nhowever, when he supposes him seriously to mean that artists alone\r\nwere wise; though, since the sage had himself been a sculptor, he had\r\nsome reason to think well of them. It is, nevertheless, perfectly true\r\nthat men of this profession might become legislators or generals, or\r\neven behold a statue erected to them beside those of Miltiades and\r\nThemistocles, or among the gods themselves.[949] The historian of art\r\nobserves with pride that Xenophilos and Straton were permitted at\r\nArgos to place their own statues, even in a sitting posture, near\r\nthose of Asclepios and Hygeia.[950] Cheirisophos, who sculptured the\r\nApollo at Tegea, dedicated in the same fane a statue of himself in\r\nmarble, which was erected close to his great work.[951] The figure of\r\nAlcamenes occupied a place among the bassi-rilievi on the temple of\r\nDemeter at Eleusis. Parrhasios and Silanion shared the reverence paid\r\nto their picture of Theseus; and Pheidias affixed his name to his\r\nOlympian Zeus, the nearest approach perhaps which the arts have ever\r\nmade to perfection.[952]\r\n\r\nFootnote 948:\r\n\r\n  At the same time the earnings of inferior sculptors were small.—Luc.\r\n  Somm. § 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 949:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plut. Thes. § 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 950:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. ii. 23. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 951:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. viii. 53. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 952:\r\n\r\n  Id. v. 10. Wink. iv. 1. § 12. p. 332.\r\n\r\nIf the satisfaction of beholding a whole nation, I might say a whole\r\nworld, smitten with delight and wonder at his performance, would repay\r\nan artist for years of toil and study, Pheidias had his reward. And\r\nnot to the narrow circle of his life was this admiration confined; for\r\nsix hundred years after his death pilgrims from all parts of the\r\ncivilised world flocked to Olympia[953] to behold his matchless\r\nperformance; for to die without having partaken of this enjoyment was\r\nconsidered a misfortune. But neither praise, nor encouragement, nor\r\nhonour, nor gain will suffice to bring the arts to perfection. To\r\nensure this, the nation to which the arts address themselves must\r\ncomprehend their language. For, if the people be incapable of deciding\r\nwhen an artist has succeeded and when he has failed, it is very\r\ncertain that he will seldom succeed at all. Men soon find the\r\nuselessness of producing what no one around them can appreciate. Even\r\nin the matter of virtue and vice, few will soar very high in countries\r\nwhere a low standard of morals prevails generally; and, in the arts,\r\nno one will devote himself to the creation of forms which he knows\r\nwill be dumb to the public eye.\r\n\r\nFootnote 953:\r\n\r\n  Εἰς Ὀλυμπίαν μὲν ἀποδημεῖτε ἵν᾽ εἰδῆτε τὸ ἔργον τοῦ Φειδίου·\r\n  καὶ ἀτύχημα ἕκαστος ὕμων οἴεται, τὸ ἀνιστόρητον τούτον\r\n  ἀποθανεῖν.—Arrian. Com. in Epict. l. i. p. 27.\r\n\r\nIn Greece every condition required to ripen the genius of an artist\r\nexisted. He knew that his reputation and fortune would depend on the\r\ncaprice of no particular individual or class of individuals. He\r\nperceived among his countrymen at large the knowledge, the taste, and\r\nthe enthusiasm which just decisions in art demand, and laboured\r\nfearlessly for them, not doubting that he should obtain the reward his\r\ngenius merited. There were public exhibitions, as among us, both at\r\nCorinth and at Delphi;[954] but, instead of converting them into a\r\nsordid traffic, the whole world was invited to behold their\r\nperformances, and judges were appointed to decide upon the merits of\r\nthe exhibitors. Instances no doubt there were of artists showing their\r\nperformances for money: at least the memory of one example has come\r\ndown to us. Zeuxis of Heraclea, having finished his picture of Helen,\r\nopened an exhibition and fixed a certain admission price, by which he\r\ncleared a large sum of money; but to mark their disapprobation of such\r\nconduct, his contemporaries bestowed on his picture the name of the\r\ncourtesan.[955]\r\n\r\nFootnote 954:\r\n\r\n  Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxv. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 955:\r\n\r\n  Ælian, Var. Hist. iv. 12. Cf. Meurs. ad Lycoph. Cassand. 131. p.\r\n  1189. and Val. Max. iii. 7.\r\n\r\nIn the public exhibitions they appear to have looked solely to merit,\r\nand not to have allowed themselves to be dazzled by great names; for\r\nwhen Panænos, brother of Pheidias, entered the lists, neither his own\r\nreputation, nor that of the illustrious sculptor, could obtain for him\r\nthe preference over Timagoras, who was allowed to have excelled. A\r\nlike spirit prevailed among the judges of Olympia, whither artists\r\nsometimes brought their pictures during the games to delight assembled\r\nnations, and reap a harvest of joy and glory in a day. Thus when Ætion\r\nappeared with his “Marriage of Alexander and Roxana,” before the\r\nHellanodicos Proxenides,[956] he not only obtained the credit due to\r\nhis genius, but that magistrate, more emphatically to express his\r\nadmiration, bestowed on him the hand of his daughter. And Lucian, who\r\nhad seen the picture in Italy, has left a description of it which\r\njustifies the enthusiasm of Proxenides.\r\n\r\nFootnote 956:\r\n\r\n  Lucian. Herod. § 4.\r\n\r\nI have already in a former chapter accounted in some measure for the\r\ndiffusion of a correct taste among the great body of the people. It\r\nformed with them an indispensable branch of study. The arts of design\r\nwere cultivated by the philosopher, the politician, in short, by every\r\none who claimed to be considered a gentleman.[957] Nay, gentlewomen\r\nalso enjoyed these advantages, and instances are recorded of their\r\narriving at professional excellence and celebrity; for example,\r\nTimarete,[958] daughter of the younger Micon, an Athenian, and Helen\r\nan Alexandrian Greek, who painted the “Battle of the Issos,”\r\nafterwards consecrated in the temple of Peace.[959] It was in the\r\nnature of things, that artists moving in such a moral atmosphere\r\nshould partake largely of the national grandeur of sentiment, and look\r\nrather to the perpetuation of their name than to any sordid\r\nconsiderations of gain, above which they were elevated by the form\r\nwhich the national gratitude assumed. For we may be sure that what is\r\nrelated of the great historian of Halicarnassos was, to a certain\r\nextent, true of great artists. Men pointed at him, we are told, as he\r\nmoved through the public assemblies, exclaiming, “That is he!

However the public constituted the great patron\r\nof art, and uniting in itself natural aptitude, acquired knowledge,\r\nand an inherent leaning towards grandeur, communicated to those who\r\nlaboured to gratify it corresponding taste and elevation. In many\r\ncases the whole population of a city identified its own glory with\r\nthat of some celebrated picture or statue within its walls. Olympia,\r\nthough peopled by works of art of surpassing excellence, still looked\r\nupon the Pheidian Zeus[962] as the apex of its glory; and even Athens,\r\nwhere probably more objects of art were crowded together than in any\r\nother city of the world, the colossal statue of Athena stood\r\npreëminently the ornament of the Acropolis. In one respect we have\r\nbegun to imitate the Greeks, who often erected by general subscription\r\nthe statue of a divinity, or of some Athletæ victorious in the sacred\r\ngames. Some minor cities are solely remembered for the works of art\r\nthey contained: for example, that of Aliphera which owed its celebrity\r\nentirely to its statue of Athena in bronze, the work of Hecatodoros\r\nand Sostratos.[963]\r\n\r\nFootnote 961:\r\n\r\n  Galen, Protrept. § 8. t. i. p. 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 962:\r\n\r\n  On the interior of this statue inhabited by rats and mice.

Amor. § 11. seq.\r\n\r\nWinkelmann supposes that both sculpture and painting arrived earlier\r\nat a certain degree of perfection than architecture, and, assuming the\r\nfact, proceeds philosophically to account for it. But his theory\r\nitself, on this point, appears to be erroneous. In Egypt, at least,\r\nwhere the mind would necessarily be guided by the same laws as in\r\nGreece, it is certain that while sculpture and painting never escaped\r\nfrom the swaddling bands of infancy, architecture advanced to a very\r\nhigh degree of perfection. The force of necessity, which leads to the\r\ncreation of architecture, communicates a far more lasting impulse than\r\nthe instinct of imitation. Men must everywhere build to protect\r\nthemselves from the fury of the elements; and the first step thus\r\nmade, and leisure supervening, that sense of proportion and symmetry\r\nand arrangement, which is almost an instinct, would soon lead to the\r\ncontemplation of the ideal and the creation of architecture as an art.\r\nSculpture sprang later into existence, and still later painting; but\r\nlike the children of one family,—of whom some are older, others\r\nyounger,—all the arts flourish nearly together, and nearly together\r\ndecay. Nevertheless we may subdivide this period into minuter cycles,\r\nwhen we shall find that architecture and sculpture reached almost like\r\ntwins their acme together, while, like a younger sister, painting\r\nattained its greatest beauty when the former two had fallen something\r\nfrom their perfection. Thus, the Zeus of Pheidias and the Hera of\r\nPolycletos, two of the most celebrated statues of antiquity, already\r\nexisted, while Hellenic painting exhibited no knowledge of\r\nchiaro-scuro and was wholly destitute of harmony.\r\n\r\nApollodoros and after him Zeuxis, master and disciple,[964] who\r\nflourished about the ninetieth Olympiad, were the first who rendered\r\nthemselves remarkable for a knowledge of light and shade.[965] But,\r\narrived at this pitch, the beauty of the art began to be felt, picture\r\ngalleries were commenced in various temples,[966] and, a new world of\r\nforms and colours disclosing itself to the imagination, the versatile\r\nGreeks transferred to it a large share of the admiration hitherto\r\nmonopolised by sculpture. Painting, in fact, speaks a more popular\r\nlanguage. It tells a story, while sculpture can but embody a thought\r\nor fix an incident. Its accessories realise events more completely.\r\nThe Apollo, in sculpture, has bent his bow and discharged his\r\narrow—the remainder of the action the imagination must shape for\r\nitself. Painting gives us the whole scene teeming with life,—the\r\nwrithing dragon, the rocks, the woods, the mountain, the sky, with all\r\nthe illusions spread before the eye by many-coloured light. Sculpture\r\nfurnishes the nucleus of glorious associations, but ’tis we that must\r\ngroup them into sublime beauty. It asks more knowledge, more fancy,\r\nmore in short of every element of genius in its admirers than does\r\npainting. Hence the latter will always number, and justly, more\r\npartisans. In most persons a preference for sculpture would be mere\r\naffectation. It cannot equally please the many.\r\n\r\nFootnote 964:\r\n\r\n  Winkel. iv. 1. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 965:\r\n\r\n  Quintil. xii. 10. Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxv. 36.\r\n\r\nFootnote 966:\r\n\r\n  In the Stoa of Dionysos, at Rhodes, there was a picture gallery\r\n  filled with historical and mythic pieces.—Luc. Amor. § 8. Similar\r\n  exhibitions appear to have existed at Cnidos, in the portico of\r\n  Sostratos.—§ 11. Works of art, sacred to the gods, were likewise\r\n  treasured up at home.—§ 16. In some temples, we learn, even\r\n  pictures of immoral tendency, by Parrhasios and others, were\r\n  admitted.—Lobeck, Aglaopham. p. 606. Aristotle takes from this\r\n  circumstance occasion to sneer at the religion of paganism which\r\n  patronised such excesses.—Polit. vii. 15. p. 255. Gœttl.\r\n\r\nHowever, in proportion as the public became more enlightened, and, to\r\njustify its admiration and enthusiasm, imposed harder conditions on\r\nartists, the latter enlarged the circle of their studies, which\r\ngradually expanded until it embraced a certain portion of metaphysics,\r\nthe science of form and colours, with that art of grouping and\r\narrangement which constitutes a species of narrative in painting. A\r\ncomplete exposition of their studies would be the best manual which\r\ncould be put into the hands of contemporary artists, and at the same\r\ntime would furnish the best explanation of their seemingly\r\ninexplicable superiority. But such an exposition would be out of place\r\nhere. My object is simply to hint at what may be done, not to attempt\r\nit myself; and to show, that if the Greek nation afforded\r\nencouragement to its artists, it was because those artists met their\r\ncountrymen more than half way, and laboured to deserve encouragement.\r\n\r\nThere existed in Greece a philosophy of art, that is, a perfect theory\r\nof what its object is, and of all the means by which that object may\r\nbe accomplished. Now the object of art is delight, a delight which\r\naggrandises and ennobles the mind, and such delight is only to be\r\nobtained through the contemplation of the beautiful. This conviction\r\nestablished, the studies of the Greek artist were directed to the\r\ndiscovery of the elements of the beautiful, not such as it exists in\r\nthe original types of the intellectual world (which he abandoned to\r\nthe philosopher), but such as we find it in material developements of\r\nthe ideal, and chiefly in the forms of our own species.\r\n\r\nTheir researches, conducted in a philosophical spirit, by degrees\r\ntaught them that perfect beauty, like perfect happiness, consists in\r\nabsolute serenity and repose. Thus, the heavens are beautiful when in\r\nthe noon of a summer’s day their blue depths are unstained by a cloud,\r\nand not a breath is heard among the trees. Thus, the ocean is\r\nbeautiful when the most perfect calm broods upon it, and has smoothed\r\ndown every ripple and converted it into a mirror for reflecting the\r\ncerulean purity of the sky. And this is what the poets signify when\r\nthey represent Aphrodite, the very soul of beauty and of love,\r\nspringing up from the level and glittering surface of such a sea. In\r\nthe same state the human countenance is most beautiful, when every\r\nfeature in the most perfect equilibrium breathes of calm, joy, and\r\nserenity, and by the force of sympathy converts all who approach it\r\ninto so many mirrors reflecting its absolute bliss. This is the secret\r\nof that beauty which exists in Grecian sculpture.\r\n\r\nIt was a maxim of Greek philosophy, that the magnanimous man is\r\nseldom, under any circumstances, disturbed. In action, therefore, he\r\nwould exhibit the same tranquil countenance as when at rest. Thus,\r\nSocrates at Potidæa, at Delion, in the Prison of the Eleven about to\r\nquaff the hemlock, would in looks be much the same. And this\r\nself-command, observable in one great man, art attributed generally to\r\nthe gods and heroes, who, in whatever actions they might be engaged,\r\nwould still retain a self-possessed and serene aspect. Hence, even the\r\nbattle-pieces of the Greeks are beautiful. Men fight and die, but\r\nunder the guidance of duty. We behold none of those demoniacal\r\npassions, nothing of that animal ferocity, or of that succumbing to\r\npain which convert so many modern pictures into slaughter-house\r\nrepresentations. We feel that the actors contemplated death only as\r\nthe distributor of imperishable glory,—that imagination had coloured\r\neverything around them with its rainbow tints,—that by anticipation\r\nthey enjoyed the panegyric which would be pronounced over them in the\r\nhearing of all they loved,—the monument which would be raised over\r\ntheir ashes,—the deathless reward which would be bestowed on their\r\npatriotism and valour in the historic page. To men, so feeling and so\r\nthinking, where was the sting of death? They could compress eternity\r\ninto a moment, and grasp all future time, and live through it by the\r\nirresistible force of imagination.\r\n\r\nTo be able to represent such forms and features, it was necessary to\r\nstudy simultaneously the conceptions of the poets, and the progressive\r\ndevelopement of the human figure from infancy to age. From this study\r\nresulted a body of experience, the fruit of innumerable comparisons,\r\nout of which sprang that gradually corrected and improved and elevated\r\nconception of the human figure which is denominated _the ideal_.\r\nInstances, isolated from the great body of artistic study, have crept\r\ninto ordinary books, and been thereby invested with an air of\r\nvulgarity. But this will not hinder the philosopher or the artist from\r\nincluding them in his scheme of study and converting them into germs\r\nof utility. In this part of their progress religion stepped in to the\r\naid of the artist. The several goddesses represented each a style of\r\nwomen of whom they might be considered the original type. Aphrodite,\r\nfor example, represented the impassioned and tender,[967] naturally\r\nparasites of man and too often frail; Hera, the chaste matron,\r\ndignified, authoritative, energetic, but inclined to violence and\r\nself-will; Artemis, reserved, modest, retiring, like a nun, was the\r\nprototype of unspotted maidenhood, revered for its own purity; Athena,\r\nperfect in intellect as in form, uniting the loveliness of Aphrodite,\r\nthe majesty of Hera, the delicacy and chastity of Artemis with the\r\nwisdom of Zeus, constituted properly the ideal of womanhood, loftier\r\nthan Eve before the fall and such as it can exist only in the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 967:\r\n\r\n  An ancient author has the following expression: οὐκοῦν τὸ θῆλυ, κᾄν\r\n  λίθινον ᾖ, φιλεῖται· τί δ᾽ εἴ τις ἔμψυχον εἶδε τοιοῦτον κάλλος;—Luc.\r\n  Amor. § 17.\r\n\r\n  Something very like which is found in Byron:\r\n\r\n          “There, too, the Goddess _loves in stone_, and fills\r\n          The air around with beauty.”\r\n\r\nIn search, however, of female forms to represent these ideal originals\r\nartists travelled through the whole of Greece, gathering up as they\r\nwent those fragments of beauty which, when united, were to approach\r\nperfection. They resembled Isis in search of the limbs of Osiris.\r\nSometimes, as at Crotona and Agrigentum, parents did not scruple to\r\nexpose their daughters naked to their eyes, that from them they might\r\nfashion that loveliness which was to represent to their senses the\r\ndivine being they worshiped. But this excess of superstition was rare.\r\nIn general the Hetairæ, their mistresses and companions, served for\r\nthe models after which the soft divinities of Greece were moulded:\r\n\r\n           “If Queensberry to strip there’s no compelling,\r\n           ’Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen.”\r\n\r\nThus Phryne, idealised by art, became Aphrodite, Anadyomene in the\r\nhands of Apelles, or Aphrodite of Cnidos in those of Praxiteles.\r\n\r\nChildhood obtained its representative in Eros the god of love. Thus,\r\nfrom infancy upwards, even to old age, the human form in all its\r\nphases became the object of study to the Greek artist, not to be\r\nservilely copied, but to be idealised, to be clothed with poetry, to\r\nbe divested of everything mean, gross, unspiritual, and embalmed in\r\neternal beauty. And their success is proved by this, that, even with\r\ntheir works before them, modern artists have never been able\r\nsatisfactorily to imitate their excellences. Of this Winkelmann[968]\r\nmentions some examples which have not come under my own notice.\r\n“Although the best modern artists,” he says, “have striven to imitate\r\nexactly the celebrated Medusa of the Strozzi cabinet at Rome, which,\r\nnevertheless, is not a countenance of the highest beauty, an\r\nexperienced antiquary will always be able to distinguish the original\r\nfrom the copy.” The same thing is true, he says, with respect to the\r\nPallas of Aspasios, engraved by Natter and others. But this is\r\nperfectly intelligible. The original artist, working after his own\r\nideas and comprehending thoroughly his own object, would impart to his\r\ncreations a flexibility, a grace, a freedom, not to be reached by one\r\nwhose type existed out of his own mind. For even in literature it is\r\nthus—language, malleable, expansive, obedient to control in the hands\r\nof the original writer, who breathes into it his own ideas and\r\nrequires it only to drape them, becomes a stiff unmanageable mass with\r\nthe imitator like a corpse put in motion by galvanism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 968:\r\n\r\n  Hist. de l’Art, iv. 2. 23.\r\n\r\nTo be conversant with the arts of Greece, is to move among a race of\r\ngods endued with eternal youth. In the goddesses the small neck, the\r\nundeveloped bosom convey the idea of virgin innocence. The nipple\r\nshrinking inward retreats from the eye. Over the visage a radiance\r\nindescribable appears to play; the form, whether draped or undraped,\r\nsuggests the idea of divine unfleeting existence—of the poetry of life\r\nand love—such as youth dreams of in its purest aspirations. For the\r\ngods our feelings are in a slight degree different. Zeus, invested\r\nwith the majesty of Olympos, in the fulness of manhood, powerful,\r\nbeautiful, sublime, awakens in us a mingling of reverence and love, as\r\ntowards a father. Apollo towers like an elder brother above our heads.\r\nHades, Poseidon, Ares are powers whom we do not love. Mighty they\r\nwere, but strangers whom our sympathies do not cling to. But Dionysos,\r\nwith his vine garland and beautiful face of friendship, with Eros and\r\nHeracles and the heroic twins and Hephæstos and Seilenos, and the\r\nFauns, with every haunter of grove, or spring, or mountain seem\r\nfamiliar all and formed to inspire and repay affection. They are\r\nspirits of joy every one of them. They have lived from boyhood in our\r\ndreams, they have constituted one principal link in binding us to the\r\npast, one principal argument in favour of Grecian genius: and who can\r\ndo otherwise than love them? Nay, in some measure, when we consider\r\ntheir manifold escapes from time and barbarism, they appear to us as\r\nOthello to Desdemona—we “love _them_ for the dangers they have\r\npassed,”—and it asks no faith in miracles to persuade us that they\r\n“love _us_ that we do pity them.”\r\n\r\nWinkelmann, who on so many questions connected with art has put\r\nforward opinions highly just and philosophical, appears to have fallen\r\nshort of his wonted acumen in the theory he had formed of the beauty\r\nof the goddesses. His language in fact descends to puerility where he\r\nsays:—\"Since on the subject of female beauty there are few\r\nobservations to be made, it may be concluded that the study of it is\r\nless complicated and far easier for the artist. Nature itself appears\r\nto experience less difficulty in the formation of women than of men,\r\n_if it be true_ that there are born fewer boys than girls.\"[969] Since\r\nthe direct contrary is true, this imaginary difficulty of Nature (not\r\nto hazard a more sacred word) may be dismissed with contempt; but the\r\nremark by which it is ushered in requires to be confuted. Artists are\r\nwell aware, and Winkelmann himself admits, that the beau ideal of\r\nheroic beauty (that for example of Achilles or of Theseus) is merely\r\nthe blending of feminine loveliness with masculine power, so as to\r\nleave it undetermined, from the countenance, to which sex it belongs.\r\nAnd still the beauty of the Grecian youth, where they are beautiful,\r\nconsists in a near approach to that of the female, so near indeed that\r\nthey might be easily mistaken for women. If, therefore, the beauty of\r\nmen when highest and most perfect, consists chiefly in what it borrows\r\nfrom that of woman, the latter necessarily constitutes the apex of\r\nhuman beauty; and the artist whom this conviction guides in his\r\ncreations, will be the first to rival the great masters of antiquity.\r\nAnother observation which it is strange to find in the Historian of\r\nArt, is that artists draped their female figures because of the little\r\ndifficulty there is in imitating the naked form. But was it the\r\nextreme facility of representing paternal grief that led Timanthes to\r\nveil the face of his Agamemnon? In draping their goddesses and\r\nheroines, artists were guided by other reasons, of which the principal\r\nwas their desire to conform to the ideas of the poets and to popular\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nFootnote 969:\r\n\r\n  Hist. de l’Art, iv. 2. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                          HELLENIC LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the arts the transition is natural to the literature[970] of\r\nGreece, which in the historical period necessarily constituted the\r\nprincipal agent in ripening and stamping their peculiar character upon\r\nthe fruits of education among the people. Literature is in fact the\r\nschool-mistress of nations. In it so long as it remains entire, we may\r\ncontemplate the whole character, intellectual and moral, of the race\r\nout of whose passions, yearnings, tastes, and energies it may be said\r\nto be fashioned. And this, true of all literature, is especially\r\napplicable to that of Greece, which more than any other bears the\r\nimpress of nationality. Every idea, every image, every maxim, every\r\nreflection seems to emanate from one source. Nothing is foreign.\r\nNeither the inspiration, nor the spirit which regulated it and moulded\r\nit into beauty, borrowed a single impulse from anything existing\r\nbeyond the circle of Hellenic thought. Greece supplied at once the\r\nmatrix and the materials, the active power and that delicate sense of\r\nbeauty and perfection which presided over its organisation and\r\nrendered it the delight of mankind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 970:\r\n\r\n  Speaking of the influence of literature on education Plato remarks,\r\n  that persons accustomed from their infancy to the loftier and purer\r\n  inspirations of the muse will regard with contempt everything mean\r\n  or illiberal; whereas they who have always been familiar with low\r\n  and vulgar compositions will look upon all other literature as tame\r\n  and insipid.—De Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 30.\r\n\r\nIn characterising this literature many singular notions have been\r\nbroached. We have been told that its spirit is exclusively masculine,\r\nwhich means, of course, that while it abounds with strength and\r\nenergy, with sublimity of speculation and impassioned and impetuous\r\nimpulses, it is wanting in that sweetness, delicacy, grace, and\r\ntenderness which confer on the intellectual offspring of some modern\r\nnations a feminine aspect. Grecian literature, however, is neither\r\nmasculine nor feminine, but androgynous like the son of Aphrodite and\r\nHermes. There is no excellence of thought or language, of which, even\r\nin its present fragmentary state, it does not offer us some example.\r\nThere is a predominance, doubtless, of stern grandeur and colossal\r\nelevation of thought; but, beside these, we discover frequently\r\nmodifications of light and airy beauty, infantine purity of sentiment,\r\nease, grace, felicitous negligence, and a dreamy luxury of speculation\r\nnot to be outdone by the most subtile and fanciful literature\r\nexisting. If there be a deficiency of any thing, it is of\r\nspirituality. The imagination of the Greeks confined itself too\r\nrigidly perhaps to this “bank and shoal of time.” Not being able to\r\nlift the veil which curtains the realms beyond the grave, it busied\r\nitself too little about those things with which the disembodied soul\r\nmust converse for ever. In most Greek writers there is a visible\r\nreluctance to walk amid the forms of Hades. Their fancy will not be\r\nconducted beyond the limits of the visible universe, but shudders,\r\nrears and reverts its eyes towards the light where alone it finds firm\r\nfooting for speculation. But on the other hand if it refuse to quit\r\nthis earthly scene of existence, how glorious is the flood of sunshine\r\nand splendour which it pours over it! It is in these walks of\r\nliterature that we discover truly the freshness and the loveliness of\r\nmorning. The very clouds that hover over the landscape only add to its\r\nmajesty, by diversifying the prospect and introducing those shadows\r\nand contrasts which the mind delights everywhere to discover.\r\n\r\nPoets,[971] it is constantly repeated, commence in every country the\r\nmental movement which evolves civilisation out of the chaos of\r\nbarbarism; but it remains a mystery how and by what they themselves\r\nare moved. There may possibly be something more than a figure of\r\nspeech in the old affirmation that they were inspired of heaven. Their\r\nimagination towered to so great a height that it was kindled by the\r\nlamps of the firmament, and may be regarded as that fabled Prometheus\r\nwho applied the flame of science to the human clay. I do not therefore\r\nsee what objection can be urged against our maintaining the old\r\ndoctrine that poets partook and partake still, when their minds are\r\npure, of a divine impulse—that to the infant nations of the earth they\r\nwere teachers commissioned from on high.\r\n\r\nFootnote 971:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Lil. Gyrald. Opp. t. ii. p. 2. “Nihil traditum videbis in\r\n  religionibus et mysteriis, nihil in theologiâ et philosophiâ\r\n  aliisque bonis artibus à principio fuisse sine poeticâ, ita ut hoc\r\n  verè me tibi dicturum existimem, ex omnibus disciplinis unam hanc\r\n  divinam extitisse, quasi totius vitæ magistram.”\r\n\r\nThe condition of the mind in those early ages when poets were the only\r\noracles, it is difficult for men surfeited with the luxuries of a\r\nprolific literature to comprehend. Among the Arabs of the desert we\r\nmay still perhaps discover something similar. Deprived of books, but\r\nenjoying much leisure, they eagerly treasure up in their memories the\r\nmoral distich, the apologue, the tale which instructs while it\r\ndelights, and thus mentally furnished with a few weapons they are\r\noften wiser in deliberation, more persuasive in discourse, more ready\r\nin action than persons of education in civilised countries, whose\r\nintellectual armoury is so full that in the moment of danger they know\r\nnot what weapon to choose. Poets, among such a race and under such\r\ncircumstances, feel that they have a high mission to fulfil; their\r\nendeavours are not by polished rhythmical trifles to amuse a few rich\r\nand noble persons, but to clothe in befitting language and marry to\r\nimmortal verse those great central truths, upon which the whole system\r\nof the future world of civilisation must revolve. We find them always\r\ncuriously adapting their revelations to the times. First, the great\r\nfundamental truths of religion, the basis of the social structure, are\r\ninfused into the public mind. Next the rudiments of politics and\r\nlegislation, the precepts of agriculture, the leading rules of the\r\nuseful arts, the observances of civil life, and the first faint\r\nwhispers of the passions and affections are treasured up in their\r\nlays. Then, growing bolder by degrees, they aim at subduing the whole\r\nempire of knowledge, and impetuously, with numerous charms and\r\nallurements, hurry mankind forward in a sort of orgiastic rapture to\r\nthe very threshold of philosophy.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest names in the literary traditions of Hellas are\r\nthose of Olen, Pamphos, Musæos and Orpheus,[972] who, for their\r\nwisdom, are said to be sprung from the gods. They were sacred bards,\r\nwhose genius obtained for them an ascendency over the minds of their\r\ncountrymen. Yet all they attempted, perhaps, was to teach the doctrine\r\nof prayer, thanksgiving, sacrifice, which, being afterwards\r\nmisunderstood, caused them to be confounded with those impostors and\r\nincantation-mongers, who, in more recent times, granted absolutions\r\nand sold indulgences both to individuals and states, with a hardihood\r\nworthy of Giovanni di Medici. Musæos, older probably than Orpheus,\r\nthough sometimes regarded as his disciple, is said by certain\r\ntraditions to have been a teacher of ethics, who delivered a body of\r\nmoral precepts in four thousand verses. His country is unknown,—for he\r\nis now represented as an Athenian, now as a Thracian,—but his name and\r\nthe name of Orpheus and Eumolpos are associated with the expiations,\r\norgies, mysteries, celebrated during many ages in honour of Demeter\r\nand Dionysos.[973] We must rest content, however, with very imperfect\r\nnotions of what they were, for, in looking back at these great men,\r\nwhom we behold on the edge of the horizon, enlarged like the sun at\r\nits setting by misty exhalations, but by the same means rendered dim\r\nand obscure, we can form no just idea of their character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 972:\r\n\r\n  Plato de Repub. t. ii. p. 113. seq.

Wolf.\r\n  Proleg. in Homer. p. 51.\r\n\r\nThese, however, and such as these, were the men who fabricated the\r\nfirst link in that chain of thought and beauty, which, stretching over\r\nthe gulf of time and fastened to the skies, still holds up the nations\r\nof the earth from sinking into barbarism. Literature is degraded when\r\ncontemplated as an art or as an amusement. It is a paradise, into\r\nwhich the best fruits of the soul, when arrived at their greatest\r\nmaturity and beauty, are transplanted to bloom in immortal freshness\r\nand fragrance. It is the garner wherein the seeds of religion, virtue,\r\nmorals, national greatness and individual happiness are preserved for\r\nthe use of humanity. It is a gallery, where the likenesses of all the\r\ngreat and noble souls who have shed light and glory on the earth, are\r\ntreasured up as the heirloom and palladium of the human race. It is\r\nimpossible, therefore, for any but the most sordid minds to look back\r\ntowards the venerable fathers of literature without a deep thrill of\r\nfilial reverence and love, conjoined with the generous impulse and\r\nyearning desire to enlarge and add fresh brightness to the halo which\r\nencircles their names. They were not, what since too many have been,\r\nthe instruments and panders to the pleasures of worldlings. Conscious\r\nof the holy mission wherewith, according to their creed, the father of\r\ngods and men had intrusted them, they stood forward as the apostles of\r\ntruth, encircled by the majesty which a sense of divine inspiration\r\nmust impart. They felt a harmony within their souls which, in\r\nmanifesting itself, sought the aid of harmonious language; and hence\r\nthe precepts of wisdom, distilling from their lips like honey from the\r\nhoneycomb, moulded themselves naturally into verse, at whose sound the\r\nfountains of the great deep of knowledge were broken up, and the\r\nwindows of heaven opened, and a deluge of philosophy and science and\r\nintellectual delight poured forth upon the amazed world.\r\n\r\nIn what age or province of Greece arose the first minister of this\r\npoetical revelation, it is not now possible to decide. The art of\r\nwriting, however, which the Egyptian king regarded as the enemy of\r\nmemory, had not passed the Ægæan. The songs men heard were wafted on\r\nthe wings of music from tongue to tongue, and, by degrees, the\r\nprofessors of this marvellous art, by which the wisdom and the glory\r\nof the past were embalmed in the sweets of verse, embodied themselves\r\ninto a distinct order called Aoidoi or Singers.[974] The life of these\r\nmen in the remote ages of antiquity is little known to us. Wanderers,\r\nhowever, for the most part they were, in some respects not unlike the\r\nJongleurs and Troubadours of the middle ages, though occupying a\r\nhigher station and guided by a higher aim. Their first and ostensible\r\nobject was, doubtless, to delight; but it is of great importance to\r\ninspire men with a delight in lofty and ennobling conceptions,—to\r\nwithdraw them for a moment from pursuits sordid or brutalising or\r\nunmanly, to the contemplation of heroic acts,—of honour, of\r\npatriotism, of friendship,—of the great and solid advantages accruing\r\nfrom peace and commerce, and the experience of travel and adversity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 974:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Wolf. Proleg. in Hom. p. 73. 93. sqq.\r\n\r\nWhat were the rewards they obtained it is easy to conjecture. They\r\nconsisted, principally, in the rays of joy reflected back upon them by\r\na thousand happy countenances at once. Gain they neither would nor\r\ncould regard. He who renders multitudes wise and happy must be happy\r\nand wise himself; and wisdom scorns to measure its gifts against gold.\r\nThe truly wise and great man, therefore, if fortune have originally\r\nbefriended him, will shower his benefactions, as God his rain,\r\nliberally and without distinction upon all; and if necessity compel\r\nhim to receive some return, his moderation will content itself with\r\nthe least possible amount. Embraced within the circle of refinement\r\nwhich they themselves had created, however, they gradually became\r\nsecularised, though we must be careful to distinguish them from their\r\nsuccessors of a later age. The prodigious admiration which they and\r\ntheir songs excited may be learned from those passages in Homer where\r\nPhemios and Demodocos are introduced, and from that animated dialogue\r\nof Plato, in which the rhapsodist Ion describes his office and his\r\naudience. It has been justly remarked, that if this man, a mere actor,\r\ncould hurry into whatever channel he pleased the affections of a whole\r\ntheatre, melt them into tears, fire them with indignation, or clothe\r\ntheir countenances with the smiles of joy, much more would the poets\r\nthemselves work upon their passions by an art far nearer nature.\r\n\r\nCare must, no doubt, be taken not to confound the Rhapsodists with the\r\nAoidoi who preceded them, though it be certain that the manners and\r\ncondition of the later race may serve to throw considerable light on\r\nthose of the earlier. Both have recently much occupied the attention\r\nof the learned; and Wolff in particular deserves credit for his\r\ndefence of the Rhapsodists, into which, however, he was chiefly led by\r\nthe requirements of his celebrated theory. They were certainly, at\r\nfirst, a remarkable order of men, whom it would be injurious to\r\nconfound with their frivolous representatives in the age of Plato and\r\nXenophon. Nevertheless, the above distinguished scholar is perhaps\r\ninclined to exaggerate their merits, since to them, in his opinion, we\r\nowe it that the great Homeric poems have come down to us. But this is\r\ntaking for granted the matter in dispute between him and his\r\nopponents, who maintain that the author of the Iliad and Odyssey\r\npossessed both the knowledge and the materials for writing. He, with\r\nreason however, assumes that both theatrical and oratorical action\r\nfound a way opened for them by the rhapsodic art, though its\r\nprofessors were neither actors nor orators, but men exercising an\r\noffice connected with a peculiar state of society, and no longer\r\nexisting in modern times.\r\n\r\nIt has often been supposed, grounding the opinion on a false\r\ninterpretation of the word _rhapsodist_, that the members of this\r\nfraternity were mere compilers or patchers up of poems from fragments\r\npilfered out of various authors. And, to augment the absurdity, the\r\npractice of a recent age has been attributed to remote antiquity,\r\nwhen, as some imagine, the great rhapsodists like a modern lecturer,\r\ncarried about with them pictures of the subject they were upon, and\r\npointed out to the audience with a stick[975] the various characters\r\nor incidents they might be describing. Another error much insisted on\r\nby Wolff, is the supposition that the Homeric poems alone were chanted\r\nby the older Rhapsodists, which no doubt is contrary to the testimony\r\nof antiquity and to common sense. For, as might naturally be\r\nconcluded, not only the songs of Hesiod[976] and the whole epic race\r\nwere thus publicly sung, but those likewise of the lyric and iambic\r\npoets, and the very laws of the state when the legislator happened to\r\nhave composed them in verse. It must nevertheless be remarked, (though\r\nof this Wolff takes no notice,) that so much did recitations of\r\nHomer’s works predominate over all others, that Rhapsodists and\r\nHomerists were often regarded as synonymous terms;[977] and even in\r\nlater ages, when at any rate the art of writing was not unknown,\r\nDemetrius Phalereus introduced upon the stage a class of reciters,\r\nwho, down to the days of Athenæus, enjoyed the name of Homerists.\r\nStill, as I have observed above, the works of other good poets were at\r\ntimes recited, as Hesiod, Archilochos, Mimnermos, and Phocylides. Nay,\r\nthe Rhapsodist Mnasion, as Lysanias relates, used to recite the\r\nIambics of Simonides; Cleomenes, the Purifications of Empedocles, and\r\nHegesius the comedian, the Histories of Herodotus; that is, some\r\nportions of them I presume. Certain authors delivered their own\r\nproductions in this way,[978] as Xenophanes, who composed both epics,\r\nelegies and iambics.[979]\r\n\r\nFootnote 975:\r\n\r\n  Anim. ad Athen. xii. p. 371.

In fact, the poets of those times were\r\nthemselves Rhapsodists, and for many ages the only ones, if it be true\r\nthat Hesiod[980] was the first who reduced the chanting of other men’s\r\npoems into an art. Afterwards, from the age of Terpander the Lesbian\r\n(Olymp. 34) down to Cynæthos of Chios (Olymp. 69) supposed to have\r\nbeen the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, and a man of\r\ndistinguished genius, the Rhapsodists sometimes chanted the poems of\r\nothers, sometimes their own, and occasionally perhaps interpolated new\r\nverses into the golden relics of the past, as our modern actors often\r\nfoist their one-legged jokes into the stage text of Shakespeare. There\r\nappears, however, to be no foundation for the notion, that nearly\r\nevery one of these chanters was likewise a clever poet, which no\r\nancient writer, I believe, asserts, and which the assertions of fifty\r\nwould not render credible, though the probability is, that of those\r\nnumerous rhapsodists some were themselves poets, and others desirous,\r\nwithout the genius, of being thought such; so that it is quite as\r\nlikely that their vanity frequently laid claim to the works of others,\r\nwhere detection could be escaped, as that others were suffered to rob\r\nthem of their just fame.\r\n\r\nFootnote 980:\r\n\r\n  Ῥαψωδῆσαι φησὶ πρῶτον τὸν Ἡσιοδὸν Νικοκλῆς.—Schol. Pind. Nem. ii. 1.\r\n  Cf. Dissen. ad loc. Wolf. Proleg. p. 96. sqq.\r\n\r\nThey who contend for the flourishing of the system of castes in\r\nGreece, would probably maintain that the Rhapsodists constituted from\r\nthe first _a clan_, as the Homeridæ are said to have been in\r\nChios.[981] Among the few arts which commanded the undivided time and\r\nstudy of numerous professors in those ages, that of the Aoidos or\r\nPoet, was certainly one, and that, too, the most honoured and revered.\r\nDoubtless their characters were pure and noble, to overcome the envy\r\nwhich superior abilities usually inspire. For whether at home or\r\nabroad, in their native cities no less than in the public assemblies,\r\nand at the festive boards of kings, they were regarded as dear to gods\r\nand venerable to men. The Rhapsodists likewise enjoyed the same\r\nestimation and led the same kind of life until other studies and other\r\nmanners, with that most debasing of all passions, the love of gain,\r\nbrought contempt on their profession and pursuits.[982]\r\n\r\nFootnote 981:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Pind. Nem. ii. 1. Etym. Mag. 623. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 982:\r\n\r\n  Payne Knight, Proleg. in Hom. § 13. 28.\r\n\r\nIn the Homeric poems themselves we discover abundant proofs of the\r\nhigh honour in which the professors of the poetical art were held by\r\ntheir countrymen. They fulfilled in Greece[983] the office performed\r\namong the Hebrews by the Schools of the Prophets,[984] or the solitary\r\npossessors of the vaticinatory power who revealed to their countrymen\r\nthe will of heaven, and taught by what practices it might be\r\npropitiated. Some institution of this kind probably existed, as I have\r\nalready observed, from the very dawn of civilisation which it\r\nprincipally created. Most princes, like Agamemnon, Alcinoüs and\r\nOdysseus, retained in their palaces a man at once their chaplain and\r\ntheir laureate, who, when guests foreign or domestic assembled at\r\ntheir board, might administer instruction and delight, by chanting the\r\npraises of the gods, the exploits or greatness of their ancestors, or\r\neven by delivering precepts in morals or the useful arts. To a poet,\r\nalso, as to the holiest of guardians, kings entrusted the care of\r\ntheir wives and families,[985] when departing on distant expeditions;\r\nand so great was the veneration paid to their character, that we find\r\nClytemnæstra banishing the poet before she dares to become the\r\nparamour of Ægisthos.\r\n\r\nFootnote 983:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 984:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Sigon. de Rep. Hebræorum v. 9. Godwin, Moses et Aaron, i. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 985:\r\n\r\n  But the δόμων προφῆται in Æschylus (Agam. 377 Klausen,) were\r\n  household prophets, who not only disclosed the secrets of the future\r\n  and interpreted dreams, but acted also the part of counsellors in\r\n  present emergencies, and treasured up the records of the past.\r\n  Apollo is called the Prophet of Zeus, because he receives oracles\r\n  from him.—Eum. 19. 618. So Amphiaraos is denominated a great\r\n  prophet.—Sept. c. Theb. 611.\r\n\r\n  See the comment of Klausen, Agam. p. 143. seq.-Notice of the\r\n  household interpreters of dreams δόμων ὀνειρόμαντες and again κριταὶ\r\n  τῶν ὀνειράτων (Choep. 36. 39), is found in several parts of\r\n  Æschylus, who loved to furnish traits of these old superstitions. In\r\n  the Persians we find Atossa speaking of the τῶν ἐνυπνίων κριτὴς\r\n  (226) as a person of supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nBut those men of great original genius whose fame spread rapidly,\r\nand who probably found superior enjoyment in the independence of a\r\nwandering life, not content with the patronage of a single prince,\r\nor the admiration of a single people, moved perpetually from land to\r\nland, enhancing at once their glory and experience. We in fact\r\ndiscover in Homer, Pindar, and other original poets proofs that the\r\nflowers from which they collected the honey of their melodies grew\r\nnot all on one spot. Odysseus was a type of the bard who sang his\r\nadventures, and looking still further back we find the Thracian\r\nThamyris, whom the Muses were said to have punished for his vanity,\r\npenetrating into the obscurest parts of Peloponnesos, protected by\r\nthe sanctity of his character and the reverence due to his\r\nprofession.[986]\r\n\r\nWith respect to Homer, both ancient tradition and the form and spirit\r\nof his poems, require us to consider him in this light, though there\r\nis no ground for supposing him with Payne Knight to have celebrated\r\nthe different heroes of Greece for the purpose of ingratiating himself\r\nwith their descendants.\r\n\r\nFootnote 986:\r\n\r\n  Iliad β. 590. sqq. Payne Knight, Proleg. § 74.\r\n\r\nThose writers who imagine the works of Homer to have been composed\r\nfortuitously by a club of poets, all actuated by a blind instinct to\r\nproduce a number of parts which, when completed, should fit as well\r\ntogether as the several members of a statue, are necessarily desirous\r\nto establish two points: first, that the Aoidoi recited their works\r\nfrom memory, and that because, secondly, the art of writing was\r\nunknown. By far too much ingenuity has already been expended on this\r\nquestion to allow it to be any longer tempting from its novelty. Wolff\r\nand Heyne have obtained all the credit they sought by their visionary\r\nhypothesis, and the echoes of their scepticism are not yet silenced in\r\nthe academies and universities. The argument, derived from the\r\npractice of the Rhapsodists, of repeating from memory, is attended by\r\ntwo inconveniences: first, it cannot be shown that the order arose\r\nbefore the art of writing was common; second, these recitations were\r\nequally made from memory, not only in the age of Pericles, but down to\r\nthe latest period of their flourishing. It may, therefore, without the\r\nslightest risk to the argument, be granted the academic sceptics that\r\nthe Rhapsodists recited from memory, even when we know with certainty\r\nthat they learned the poems from written copies.\r\n\r\nTo render more credible the notion that the art of writing in the age\r\nof Homer was not yet known, great stress is laid on the powers of\r\nmemory in certain individuals, though from these nothing can in\r\nreality be inferred, except, that when necessary, men can certainly\r\nremember a great deal. It matters little, however, for my present\r\npurpose, whether the Iliad and Odyssey were written by one man or by a\r\nhundred; the grandeur of the poetry remains, and to it as a great\r\nfountain-head may be traced several principal streams of Hellenic\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nPlato, indeed, who laboured so assiduously in enlarging the empire and\r\ncorroborating the powers of the human understanding, at times\r\nmaintained the fancy that little benefit had been conferred on Greece\r\nby her bard. He observes, but in a manner so ironical that it is\r\ndifficult to determine his meaning, that if Homer and Hesiod had\r\npossessed the gift of improving their contemporaries in virtue they\r\nwould never have been suffered to wander about chanting their poems.\r\nPeople, he thinks, would have constrained them by benefits to remain\r\nwith them, or, not succeeding in this, would have quitted their homes\r\nto attend their footsteps, as in his age many did in the case of the\r\nsophists.[987]\r\n\r\nFootnote 987:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. x. 4. t. ii. 318. Stallb.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he admits the general opinion to have been that Homer\r\nwas the great preceptor of Hellas, who taught the sciences of politics\r\nand ethics, together with the whole discipline and economy of human\r\nlife.[988] Perhaps, notwithstanding his great wisdom and his genius,\r\nhe looked upon the question from a wrong point of view, regarding\r\npoetry as the rival rather than the precursor of philosophy. The\r\nmission of the former had, however, in his time been in a great\r\nmeasure accomplished, as far, I mean, as concerned positive teaching;\r\nand he did not consider that as civilisation advances and materialises\r\nnations the curb of poetry is the more required to check their\r\ndownward tendencies, and direct their head towards the skies. The\r\nobject of poetry is to keep alive in the human breast the love of\r\nwhatever is noble and beautiful, to dazzle the worldling from the\r\nworship of gold by showing him something more glorious than anything\r\nthat gold can purchase, to accomplish the apotheosis of pure\r\naffection, of virtue, of disinterestedness, of great passions, of\r\npatriotism,—and in Homer all this is effected with a spontaneous\r\nenergy, which like the ocean appears equal to bear the whole weight of\r\nhumanity clothed with all its attributes upon its breast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 988:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. x. 7. t. ii. 336.\r\n\r\nGreece has no poet worthy to be compared with our Shakespeare and our\r\nMilton but Homer, who possesses some advantages over them both.\r\nShakespeare, buoyant and full of life as was his spirit, felt\r\nevidently the waves of his imagination lapse at times from about him\r\nand leave his mind stranded and bare on the shores of the immeasurable\r\nuniverse. Melancholy creeps over him, like a black vapour, concealing\r\nthe Titanian head wont to tower above the region of the clouds. Even\r\nover Milton’s soul, serene in its fiery brightness as it usually is, I\r\nthink I discover something which at times obscures his faith in\r\nhimself and human nature, and produces a flagging of the fancy. But in\r\nHomer this never appears. Cheerfully and joyously he pursues his\r\ncourse with eternal sunshine on his brow, and a heart beating full and\r\ntrue, as if the life of all the world were within him. There is no end\r\nof his vitality. He seems as if he could never grow old. His strength\r\nis inexhaustible. Equal to whatever may happen, he nowhere seems to be\r\nhurried by his subject, or compelled to strain a nerve to accomplish\r\nwhat he desires. In himself he appears happy as a god, and only to\r\nsympathise in human suffering from the boundlessness of his charity.\r\nHe comes forth as the sun in the morning, full of brightness, showing\r\nall the tears that sprinkle the earth and drying them too, but\r\nshedding none. We call him old, though in reality he is all\r\nyouthfulness and love. Every function of life goes on harmoniously in\r\nhis frame. He enjoys whatever nature brings within the circle of his\r\nexperience. He drinks in with rapture the freshness of dawn,—basks\r\nsmilingly in the blaze of noon,—welcomes the stillness of evening—the\r\nsolemn grandeur of night. Sleep, too, has for him inexpressible\r\ncharms, and on the pleasures we taste among its bowers he has bestowed\r\nevery grateful, every endearing epithet. Milton is far more spiritual,\r\nand careers in a course nearer the stars. Shakespeare, in his\r\nmetaphysical subtlety and yearning to pierce beyond the grave,\r\nsuggests stranger thoughts, and calls up a wilder world of fancies.\r\nBut Homer, as if admitted behind the veil, never doubts for a moment.\r\nHabitually, too, his thoughts are of action, of man as he is, of the\r\nvirtue of the citizen, of the soldier, of the husband, of the father,\r\nof the son, of the wife. He loved the world and all that it contains.\r\nHis eye could detect beauty where the atrabilious sceptic beholds\r\nnothing but deformity.\r\n\r\nHence the universal fame and admiration of his writings. For, wherever\r\na well-spring of delight exists, the world will discover it and have\r\nrecourse to it for ever. The tragic poets who took up his mantle\r\ndiffered widely from him both in temper and character. The experiment\r\nof civilisation had been tried, and been the cause of less happiness\r\nthan at the outset it seemed to promise. A spirit of dissatisfaction\r\nhad consequently grown up in society, which, shaken by convulsions\r\nwithin and assaulted from without by storms, appeared to be fast\r\nresolving into its original elements. Upon the minds of the tragic\r\npoets there accordingly fell a gloomy shadow. They looked backwards\r\nand around them, and were saddened by the view of terrible pictures\r\nwhich the dark pencil of Fate was constantly filling up. The\r\ninexplicable influence of events upon the inner organisation of man\r\nhad caused them too, and their contemporaries equally, to delight in\r\ngloom, in slaughter, in revenge, in exhibitions of suffering,\r\nanalogous in many cases to what they beheld their countrymen inflict\r\nupon each other.\r\n\r\nObserve the creations of Æschylus:[989] in them, pregnant all with\r\nMiltonic haughtiness, energy, grandeur, we already discover symptoms\r\nof profound discontent with the character of actual existence and an\r\ninvincible yearning towards the past. He seemed desirous to haunt the\r\nimaginations of his contemporaries with gigantic phantoms, quarried\r\nout of the wrecks of a vanished ethical system, in which such\r\ngreatness found congeniality and sympathy. His ideas seemed to clothe\r\nthemselves spontaneously in language of massive structure, like a\r\nCyclopean wall, such as before or since no man ever used. He projected\r\nhimself by the force of meditation into the heroic spheres, conversed\r\nthere with mighty shades, acquired among them stern principles of\r\naction, of thought, of belief, of composition; and with these he\r\nsought to inspire the men of his own time. His object seems less to\r\ndelight than to overawe, to persuade than to command. His ideas move\r\nalong the highest arch of imagination which spans the universe from\r\npole to pole, or rise out of a sea of darkness which they illuminate\r\nfor a moment like lightning flashes in their passage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 989:\r\n\r\n  The plays of this poet, like those of Shakespeare, were, in\r\n  succeeding ages, altered for the stage—Quint. Instit. Orat. x. 1.\r\n  The orator, Lycurgus, procured a decree, ordering the tragedies of\r\n  the three poets to be copied, and statues to be erected in their\r\n  honour.—Plut. Vit. x. Orat.\r\n\r\nAll Æschylus’s more marked characters come before us invested with\r\nmarvellous attributes, and their voices awake a thrilling mysterious\r\necho in the depths of the soul. Prometheus, for example,—who or what\r\nin poetry is like him? Some features of resemblance he may have to the\r\nSatan of “Paradise Lost,” but only in his indomitable energy, in his\r\nunconquerable will; in all other respects he stands differenced from\r\nthat “archangel ruined” by qualities the most remarkable. Towards\r\nmankind he appears in the relation of supreme love. For their sake\r\nalone he braves the anger of Zeus, who, in the tempest of vengeance\r\nwhich he pours upon the naked form of this beneficent god, is\r\npresented to the mind as a tyrannical oppressor. Again, in the\r\nErinnyes, what mysterious phantoms does he conjure up! The whole\r\nscene, where black and blood-dripping they rise before the fancy in\r\nthe shrine of Delphi, is, beyond imagination, awe-inspiring and\r\nsublime. Like Orestes himself, the fancy is haunted, as we read, by an\r\nuneasy consciousness of their presence. They appear like the summits\r\nof the infernal world, thrust up visibly into the world of reality.\r\nThey are frightful dreams endued with form and vitality, and walking\r\nabroad to scare us even while waking. Never did faith in visionary\r\nbeings equal in strength the faith which he constrains us to have in\r\nthese his creations. The scent of blood fills the nostrils as we read.\r\nWe pant,—we shudder,—we expect to hear their footsteps on the carpet\r\nbehind us. Nevertheless the effect of Æschylus’ poetry is not, like\r\nByron’s, to humiliate or depress. On the contrary, it imparts to us\r\nits energy as we read. It fills,—it expands,—it aggrandises,—it\r\nelevates the mind.\r\n\r\nSophocles presents us with a wholly different type of genius. His\r\nconceptions, without being gigantic, are still great, and have a\r\nrichness and roundness something like the form of woman. To him, as to\r\nRaffaelle, the world appeared pregnant on all sides with beauty. Yet,\r\nthere was a vein of pensiveness in his fancy which, running through\r\nall his works, imparts to them a witchery independent of the amount of\r\nintellect displayed. He never, like Æschylus, transports us into the\r\ndim twilight of mythology amidst the nodding ruins of systems and\r\ncreeds. However antique may be the subject which he treats, his\r\ninvention gives it completeness, and he brings it out fresh, glossy,\r\ndistinct, and beautiful as the creations of to-day. Æschylus carries\r\nus back to the past, Sophocles brings the past forward to us. By a\r\nvigorous exertion of genius he breathes life into things dead; melts\r\naway from about them by his warm touch the hoar of antiquity; fills up\r\nthe outline; freshens the colours; converts them into contemporary\r\nexistencies. All his sympathies, healthy and true, cling to the things\r\naround him: the religion, the form of polity, the climate, the soil of\r\nAttica, invested with the beauty which they assumed in his plastic\r\nvision, satisfied his desires. What he found not in realities he\r\nbestowed upon them. He idealised his contemporaries. His poetry is\r\nsunny as the Ægæan in spring, and a breeze as healthful and refreshing\r\nbreathes over it. Like the nightingale, whose music he loved, it comes\r\nto us full of forgotten harmonies, re-awakening all the associations,\r\nall the delights, all the hopes and aspirations of youth. Sweet and\r\nmusical, and replete with tenderness, are his marvellous chorusses.\r\nThey burst upon the heart like the first note of the cuckoo[990] in\r\nthe depths of a forest, curling round the mossy trunks of the\r\nmeditative old trees upon the ear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 990:\r\n\r\n  In Greece heard early in the spring.—Sibthorp, in Walp. Mem. i. 75.\r\n\r\nAnd then his female characters, in which above all things he excels.\r\nNot Imogen herself, whose breath like violets perfumes the page of\r\nShakespeare, rises before us a more exquisite vision than Antigone, in\r\nher maiden purity, her unfathomable tenderness, her holy affection,\r\nfilial and fraternal. Even Œdipos, supported and led into the light by\r\nsuch a daughter, appears glorious as a god, his involuntary stains\r\nworked off by years of suffering, his reverend old age garlanded by\r\ncalamity, wreathed with the tendrils and snowy blossoms of a\r\ndaughter’s love. And Tecmessa, does she not seem to be Desdemona\r\nripened into a mother? There is no poet who has pourtrayed a wife of\r\nmore unmingled gentleness, or who has better sounded the depths of a\r\nmother’s heart. Her affection expands like an atmosphere round the boy\r\nEurysaces, menaced at once by treacherous enemies and by his father’s\r\nmadness, and casts a pure and bright ray over the sea of blood and\r\nstormy passion and guilt that floats around her. His Dejanira,\r\nlikewise, is a character of great beauty; but in the Clytemnæstra and\r\nElectra, in the Chrysothemis and Ismene, he has been less successful.\r\nAmong his male characters Œdipos is the masterpiece. Compounded of\r\nungovernable passion, a powerful will, a resolution invincible by\r\nsuffering, extreme in love or hate, he stands before us in heroic\r\ngrandeur, and like the sun’s orb dilates as he descends beneath the\r\nhorizon. Next to him in originality and beauty are Neoptolemos and\r\nTeucer, youths of the greatest nobleness of soul, who contrast\r\nstrikingly with his fox-like Odysseus and the mean-souled imperial\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nTo Sophocles succeeds Euripides,[991] whose genius inspired Milton\r\nwith the deepest admiration, as it had before inspired Aristotle.\r\nResembling Sophocles as little as the latter resembles Æschylus, he is\r\nmore deeply imbued than either with the tragic spirit, interprets more\r\nunerringly the language of passion and the heart, and unlocks more\r\nsurely the hidden springs of pity. In him, however, poetry is less an\r\ninstinct than an art. His intellect, lofty, powerful, penetrating,\r\nranged through the most untrodden paths of nature and philosophy,\r\ngrasped at all learning, at all experience, enriched itself with\r\nprodigious stores of reflections, observations, imagery, over which it\r\npossessed the most perfect mastery, to render them subservient to the\r\npurposes of the drama. Other poets learned in effects, may exhibit\r\naction with no less truth and skill; Euripides dares to unveil causes,\r\nto give the wherefore and the why of actions, to descend into the\r\nabysses of the mind and lay bare the curious mechanism, and, so to\r\nsay, central fires which produce and ripen our resolutions and our\r\ndemeanour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 991:\r\n\r\n  This writer, like most of his poetical contemporaries, used\r\n  constantly to wear a tablet and stylus suspended to his\r\n  dress.—Athen. xiii. 45. The use in fact of memorandum books was\r\n  common.—Sch. Aristoph. Vesp. 529.\r\n\r\nWithout the stern grandeur or the rich physical imagery of his\r\npredecessors, he could more surely touch the feelings and create an\r\nintense interest in the story of his tragedies. No man, moreover, has\r\ngiven birth to nobler sentiments. A moral beauty broods over his\r\nscenes; he elevates,—he enlarges,—he purifies the affections. Truths\r\nof greatest importance make themselves wings of melody in his verse,\r\nand fly across the gulf of two thousand years from him to us. Above\r\nall things, he may almost be said to have discovered the inexhaustible\r\nmine of love, whence he drew the gold that fashioned the divine image\r\nof Alcestis, the noblest mixture of earth’s mould that ever bore the\r\nname of woman. It is true this image is but dimly beheld. Perhaps no\r\ngenius, not even Shakespeare’s, could have filled up the outline of\r\nunearthly beauty which Euripides dared to draw. It embodies all the\r\nimagination ever conceived of love. Pure as the celestial Artemis,\r\nimpassioned to perfect disinterestedness, all devotion as a wife, all\r\ntenderness as a mother,—content to die, yet jealous of posthumous\r\nlove,—sacrificing everything for her husband’s life, yet haunted by\r\nthe fear that death might snap the golden links of affection, she\r\nissues forth like a celestial vision to take her farewell of the sun.\r\nEuripides might well be proud of this creation. Not Andromache, not\r\nNausicaa, not even the far-famed consort of Odysseus can exceed in\r\ntruth and beauty his conception of Alcestis. Yet this is the poet whom\r\nAristophanes had the bad taste to overwhelm with unceasing ridicule,\r\nand whom numerous critics, borrowing their canons from him, have\r\nrashly pronounced languid and insipid.\r\n\r\nMoving on a level below this is the character of Electra in the\r\nOrestes. In the Alcestis we have rather the results than the\r\ndevelopement of inexpressible love, which\r\n\r\n                   “raised a mortal to the skies.”\r\n\r\nBut Electra’s affection unfolds itself before us. There she watches\r\nbeside her brother’s bed, contending with the inexpiable guilt of\r\nmatricide, sharing his remorse but comforting him, herself oppressed,\r\nyet courageously bearing up for his sake against the worst\r\n\r\n                    “ills that flesh is heir to.”\r\n\r\nWith the most supreme delicacy is Polyxena conceived; and generally,\r\nwhatever may be said of Euripides’ aversion for the sex, it may be\r\naffirmed that no poet has more ably or more nobly painted the female\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nPassing next to comedy, of which Aristophanes must be regarded as the\r\nrepresentative, we have a department of literature peculiar to Greece,\r\nfor its comedy resembles that of no other country. It has never,\r\nperhaps, been fairly characterised. They who take part with the poet\r\nagainst the philosopher exaggerate his merits: the admirers of\r\nSocrates, in revenge for the unjust death of that great man, generally\r\nundervalue them. Let us endeavour to be just. Aristophanes was a poet\r\nof vast genius, quick to perceive, and powerful to paint the\r\nimperfections, vices, follies, weaknesses, miseries of man in society.\r\nHe was greedy, too, of reputation, in the acquisition of which he\r\nspared neither men nor institutions. The youthful, the gay, the\r\nthoughtless, reckoning laughter and amusement among the real wants of\r\nlife, (as to the weak and frivolous perhaps they are,) he undertook to\r\nbuild his fame on easing the human character of those moral excrements\r\nwhich pass off in grinning and mirth. There is, in fact, a load of\r\nsmall malignity and mischief in most mental constitutions, which, if\r\nnot expelled, might obstruct the healthful play of the faculties.\r\nMirth is the form it assumes in its exit, and comedy is one of the\r\nmeans provided by Nature for promoting its discharge.\r\n\r\nAristophanes, who comprehended at least this part of philosophy, found\r\nan abundant harvest of follies in his fellow-citizens. He saw, too,\r\nthat of all men they possessed the most inexhaustible good-nature,—to\r\nforgive if they could not profit by the satire which was directed\r\nagainst themselves. No one could complain of them on this score. Their\r\nrisible muscles were at every man’s service who could coin a joke, or\r\nmake faces, or draw a caricature or enact one. Athens was, in fact,\r\nthe home of laughter: it was the weak side of the national character;\r\nand never, since merry-making was invented, did a more skilful\r\nmanufacturer of this autochthonal production exist than Aristophanes.\r\nHe could make round things square, or straight crooked; he could\r\ninvest the noblest and most sacred things with burlesque and ridicule;\r\nhe could convert patriotism into a laughable weakness, genius into\r\npuerility, virtue into a farce. He knew how to make the brave man (as\r\nLamachos) seem a mere gasconader; the man of genius (as Euripides) a\r\ndealer in rhythmical jingles; the possessor of highest wisdom and most\r\nunsullied integrity a babbling impostor and a thief. Such were his\r\nprodigious powers. Another excellence he had, not unakin to the\r\nformer; he could, when it suited his purpose, place the most nefarious\r\nvices on the same level with very harmless foibles, so that both\r\nshould appear equally laughable or equally odious.\r\n\r\nBut the Athenians must have been a base people had these been the\r\nqualities which rendered him popular. They were not: on the contrary,\r\nthey formed the great drawback on his reputation. His attack on\r\nSocrates caused the first cast of the Clouds to be hooted off the\r\nstage. But great and crying as were his delinquencies against morals\r\nand philosophy, his genius triumphed, and he became popular in spite\r\nof them; and in spite of them he has continued to be a favourite among\r\nscholars down to the present day. No mean amount of creative power\r\ncould have achieved a triumph like this. He possessed, in fact, the\r\nquality, whatever it be, which confers vitality on the offspring of\r\nthe mind. Each of his plays, however extravagant its conceptions,\r\nhowever improbable the plot or wild the scene or fantastic the\r\ncharacters, still developes a distinct cycle of existences into which\r\nthe breath of everlasting life has been breathed. To every individual\r\nwhom he brings upon the stage has been assigned a distinct type of\r\ncharacter, a marked individuality, a moral and intellectual\r\nphysiognomy as peculiar to himself as his mask. No man exhibits\r\ngreater variety in a small compass. When he is working out a character\r\nevery word tells, and his ease is infinite. Nothing appears to have\r\nproceeded from him in a hurry. Like the wind, which now rises in\r\ngusts, now sinks to a whisper, but never suggests the idea of\r\nweakness, Aristophanes may trifle, but always because he desires to\r\ntrifle.\r\n\r\nMoreover, however barren the subject may be, however rugged, bleak,\r\nintractable, he pours over it the dews of poetry, and clothes it\r\nmagically with flowers and verdure. Look at the comedies of the Frogs\r\nand the Birds. By whom but Aristophanes could they have been rendered\r\ntolerable? And yet what marvellous effects grow out of them in his\r\nhands! How completely is the imagination detached from the common\r\neveryday world, and sent drifting down the dreamy intoxicating streams\r\nof poetry! Not in the island of Prospero or Philoctetes, not in the\r\nsavage-encircled nest of Robinson Crusoe, not in the most visionary\r\nvale that opens before us its serene bosom in the Arabian Nights, do\r\nwe breathe more at large, or more fresh and wholesome air, than among\r\nthe fogs and fens of Acheron, or the eternal forests of the Hoopoo\r\nking.\r\n\r\nWith an art, in which Shakespeare was no mean proficient, he opens up\r\na more culpable source of interest in the frequent satire of vices,\r\ncondemned as commonly as they are practised. He unveils the mysteries\r\nof iniquity with a fearless and by no means an unreluctant hand. No\r\nabyss of wickedness was too dark for his daring muse. He ventured\r\nfearlessly upon themes which few since or before have touched on,\r\ndespising contemporary envy and vindictiveness and the stern\r\ncondemnation of posterity. To be plain, he evidently shared in the\r\nworst corruptions of his age, and, like many other satirists, availed\r\nhimself joyfully of the mask of satire as an apology for entertaining\r\nhis own imagination with the description of them. No one with the\r\nleast clearsightedness or candour can fail to perceive and acknowledge\r\nthe depraved moral character of this comic writer. Only less filthy\r\nthan Rabelais, his fancy runs riot among the moral jakes and common\r\nsewers of the world, over which, by consummate art and the matchless\r\nmagic of his style, he contrives unhappily to cast a kind of delusive\r\nhalo, and to breathe a fragrance which should never be found but where\r\nvirtue is.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of his attack on Socrates his defenders must grant\r\none of two things—that he libelled him ignorantly, or that he\r\nexhibited a degree of wickedness capable, under other circumstances,\r\nof rising to the enormity of Judas Iscariot. Socrates, both for genius\r\nand for virtue, stands at the head of the pagan world. He whom Plato\r\nadmired must have stood on a higher level than Plato,—that is, have\r\noccupied the apex of mere humanity: and in that position we find him\r\nin the Gorgias, the Republic, the Euthyphron, and the Phædon. Many\r\ncharlatans, since the days of Aristophanes, have endeavoured to puff\r\nupward at him the smoke of their ignorance or their envy; and from\r\nthose who tread the mire with them have for a moment hidden the all\r\nbut divine serenity that smiles on humankind from that lofty and\r\nimmovable basis where the homage of a world has placed him; but the\r\nnext breeze has cleared away the stinking vapours, and left both him\r\nand them where they were,—the one on the highest, the others on the\r\nlowest step of the ladder which connects human nature with the skies.\r\n\r\nUpon the dramatic poets whose fragments only remain, it is in this\r\nplace unnecessary to dwell. I therefore pass to the historians and\r\norators, who, no less vividly than her poets, reflect the genius of\r\nGreece. The first age of prose composition, there as elsewhere,\r\nexhibited the natural characteristics of dawning art—indecisiveness\r\nand timidity. Herodotus, properly speaking, was her earliest\r\nhistorian, and even he still walks within the gigantic shadow of epic\r\nfable which stretched far over the civilised and cultivated ages of\r\nGreece, as doth that of Memnon at dawn over the Theban plains. His\r\ncharacter as a writer is very remarkable. He narrates like a prophet.\r\nHis language everywhere bears the impress and image of the\r\nsupernatural world wrought into its very substance. He had formed to\r\nhimself a poetical standard of human character and human action, which\r\naccordingly in his work develope themselves in poetical forms. Long\r\nand profound meditation had spread out the past before him like a map,\r\non which he could trace every fluctuation in the stream of events with\r\nsomething like the skill of a diviner. Men, past or present, may be\r\ninterpreted by meditation, if we comprehend the science of human\r\nnature. Herodotus understood much of this science. Indeed his chief\r\ngreatness lies in his wisdom.\r\n\r\nOrdinary readers, who are always wiser than their dead instructors,\r\ndiscovering him to be frankly superstitious, to have faith in oracles,\r\nin dreams, in prodigies, to chronicle many trivial actions, many\r\ntrivial remarks, feel or affect for him a species of contempt. But\r\nthey know very little of what is contained in that vast treasury of\r\nepic events. Little do they suspect with how many great statesmen,\r\ngenerals and heroic kings the eloquent Halicarnassian could render\r\nthem familiar. In his pages alone, perhaps, do we view in his true\r\nproportions that man of men, Themistocles, who overtops by a head and\r\nshoulders all the other statesmen of the ancient world. There, too,\r\nmay we best discover the character of his contemporaries, those\r\nextraordinary personages who connect the heroic with the historical\r\nperiod, and constitute the steps by which we descend from the heights\r\nof mythos and fable to the stern level of realities. Such an epoch\r\nrequired an historian of peculiar character. In him were to be united\r\nthe power to comprehend poetical motives to action, and the solemn\r\neloquence fittingly to describe deeds springing from such a source.\r\nBoth were found in Herodotus. He beheld Providence leading man as it\r\nwere into the light from the wilderness of mythological times, still\r\ninvested with many of his heroic habits and his forehead beaming with\r\nvisionary splendours, but prepared to doff them one by one, and in\r\ntheir stead to substitute the iron theory and practice of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThucydides, a few years only younger than Herodotus, found himself\r\nplaced in the midst of events the most extraordinary, produced by a\r\nsystem of civilisation prematurely decaying. Greece had not been\r\nsuffered to grow wise and great according to the laws which usually\r\nregulate the ripening of states. She had been scorched into\r\nfruit-bearing by the fiery conflicts of the Median war; and her\r\nstrength thus brought into play, and found to be great beyond\r\ncalculation, was immediately by ambitious statesmen seized upon,\r\nparcelled out into lots which were directed against each other, and\r\nthus exhausted in petty struggles. In Greece we have an example of a\r\nstate whose energies, turned inwards, corroded themselves by\r\nconcentration; affording a contrast with Rome whose energies, worked\r\noutward and were gradually weakened and lost by expansion. The genius\r\nof the people begot corresponding historians. Rome, had its\r\nperspicuous ornate, diffuse, haughty and sublime Livy; Athens her\r\nThucydides full of poetry indeed, and haughtier and more sublime, but\r\ncondensed as an oracle, and as an oracle obscure.\r\n\r\nFew have measured the greatness of this man. Ordinary critics missing\r\nthe ostentatious display of what is termed philosophy, appear to\r\nimagine that Thucydides is not a philosophical historian, reserving\r\nthis praise for Gibbon, Hume, or Voltaire. But each of these great\r\nwriters would have contemned the praise of such persons. Thucydides in\r\nhistorical writing stands above rivalry or comparison. The political\r\natmosphere in which he lived, dusky with thunderclouds and continual\r\nstorms, his eye could penetrate through, and discover all the very\r\nextraordinary figures that moved beneath it. Calmly, from heights of\r\nspeculation never trodden before, he contemplated the various groups\r\nof generals and statesmen dispersed over his horizon, pierced through\r\nevery disguise into their characters, detected their motives,\r\nunravelled their plots, gave their secret maxims a tongue, weighed and\r\ndescribed their actions with an impartial sagacity which among\r\nhistorians belongs to him alone. In this consists his philosophy. The\r\nsociety, whose developement he studied, was torn by two antagonist\r\nprinciples—aristocracy and democracy, whose struggles, undying in free\r\nstates, were then more fierce than at any other period in the history\r\nof the world. To enable his countrymen and posterity to comprehend the\r\nwhole chain of events, he opened up a long vista into the past, to the\r\npoint at which those adversaries appeared upon the scene, and threw a\r\nbroad light upon all their movements down to the time when Providence\r\nremoved him from his post. His conception of an historian’s duty,\r\nsomewhat different from that now entertained, was adopted by all\r\nantiquity, in which every succeeding writer bore testimony to his\r\nsuperiority by imitating him. He thought it not enough to narrate and\r\ndescribe, but, throwing open the council chamber and stilling the\r\ntumultuous agora, he brings the living statesman or demagogue upon the\r\nstage, developing in our hearing his views, his conceptions of\r\nsurrounding circumstances and characters, his projects, his means for\r\naccomplishing them. That the speeches found in his history were\r\nactually in that form delivered, I will by no means affirm. He\r\nprobably obtained but the substance from report, and himself clothed\r\nit in those vivid expressions which two thousand years have not\r\nstripped of their freshness. Nevertheless, the more trifling the\r\namount of what he owed to the relations of others, the greater must\r\nappear his genius, his unerring sense of fitness, his dramatic power\r\nof projecting himself successively into a whole gallery of characters,\r\nand truly interpreting the opinions, maxims, feelings of each; for no\r\none pretends that he has ever misrepresented a single individual. And\r\nif those speeches be examined on the score of eloquence, whether of\r\nthought or language, it will I think be found, that in almost every\r\nexcellence they may rank with those of Demosthenes. In each a peculiar\r\neconomy is observed in the management of the arguments, in the\r\nsentiments, in the opinions, in the logical tone, in the\r\nmanifestations of individuality which diffuse themselves over the\r\nwhole and give a colour to it.\r\n\r\nThe defects—for such there are—resolve themselves into a certain\r\nmagisterial air, indicating a consciousness of superiority, sure, more\r\nor less, to offend in all cases, and a certain imperspicuity of style\r\narising principally from the loose manner in which the drapery of\r\nlanguage is flung over his ideas, which is chiefly observable in the\r\norations, his narrative for the most part being free from this\r\nimperfection. Besides, whatever be the series of facts he relates,\r\ntheir importance appears to be enhanced by his manner of handling\r\nthem. He casts aside, as unworthy both of himself and the reader,\r\nwhatever is of inferior moment. These, in fact, the mere chaff of\r\nhuman affairs, only cling round the grain of action to conceal it, and\r\nmust be blown aside by the reader if the historian neglect to do it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the times conferred upon his subject all the\r\ninterest and the gloom of tragedy. But it thus suited him the better.\r\nHis genius delighted in terrible pictures: battles, plagues,\r\nearthquakes, general massacres, the storming of cities, the\r\nannihilation of great armies. His fancy vividly realised all,—the\r\nplague-tumbril rumbling, choked with dead, towards the sepulchral\r\nsuburbs,—the streets of Corcyra streaming alternately with democratic\r\nand aristocratic blood,—the expected slaughter of Mitylene,—the\r\nreality at Melos,—two thousand Helots cut off by the perfidy of\r\nSparta,—the butchery at Platæa,—at Skione,—in Sicily! Through all\r\nthese scenes we are precipitated forward, shuddering, compassionating,\r\ndetesting by turns. But we are neither overwhelmed nor inspired with\r\ndisgust for human nature. Our sympathies cling closer and closer to\r\nthe historian, who spares no villany, gratifies no malice, tramples on\r\nno noble principle, succumbs to no temptation of partiality. Faithful\r\nto his trust he deals forth truth to all, to none the slightest\r\nflattery. Not even for his country will he lie. It was she, in fact,\r\nwith her heroic ethics and grandeur of sentiment, that had taught him\r\nhis high principles, and he repaid her by recording all her errors,\r\nall her wrongs, all her imperfections: in which he acted like a great\r\nand a wise man. He would have sacrificed for her his life,—he would\r\nnot sacrifice his conscience.\r\n\r\nTo him succeeds Xenophon, a writer whom it is difficult to\r\ncharacterise. There was in the temper of his mind something\r\nparasitical, which led him to lean on others for support,—on Socrates,\r\non Cyrus, on Agesilaos. Incapable of acting in a republic the part of\r\na good citizen, he would have been that rare thing—a virtuous\r\ncourtier. From this the tone of his writings may be conjectured.\r\nAlmost everywhere we discover a degree of gentleness, sweetness,\r\nmodesty, which steals imperceptibly into the heart, and creates the\r\nimpression that he was a man highly amiable and upright. His piety,\r\nlikewise, causes itself to be felt. He never mentions the gods but\r\nwith due reverence, exhibits a strong reliance upon Providence, and,\r\naccording to his best apprehensions, justifies its ways to men with\r\nearnest solicitude. The style of his composition, necessarily\r\nharmonising with the qualities of his mind, is full of suavity,\r\npolished elegance, gentlemanliness, bonhomie, the very characteristics\r\nof a popular writer. Readers of moderate understanding can everywhere\r\nperceive his drift, can accompany him without feeling out of breath.\r\nHe is communicative, sensible, rational, indulges in no cloudy\r\nflights, never dives out of sight in the ocean of speculation.\r\n\r\nXenophon, however, misunderstood himself when he conceived that it was\r\nfor him to continue the history of Thucydides. It was as if Andrea del\r\nSarto had undertaken to complete a picture left in parts unfinished by\r\nMichael Angelo. He had neither the penetrating sagacity necessary to\r\ncomprehend the internal plan of the picture, the vivifying energy to\r\npreserve the intense tragedy of the action, nor the colours to\r\nharmonise with what he found painted. Still, considered by himself, he\r\nhas great merits. Several scenes in his history, the trial, for\r\nexample, of the generals, the death of Theramenes, the battles on the\r\nHellespont, exhibit a force of conception and a scope and flexibility\r\nof style uncommon in any literature; and the Anabasis, without\r\ncomparison his greatest work, reads like a chronicle of the most\r\nchivalrous knight-errantry. The attempt, however flagitious on the\r\npart of Cyrus, had the merit of extreme boldness. It was the model\r\nexpedition which disclosed the secret of Asia to Alexander, and showed\r\nwith how little danger its vast empires might be shattered to pieces.\r\nXenophon who, young and adventurous, accompanied the Persian prince\r\nand the heroic mercenaries in his pay, contemplated with delight the\r\nphysical aspect of the East, its luxurious population, its roving\r\ntribes, with the triumphs of his disciplined and warlike countrymen\r\nover innumerable barbarian hosts. This we discover from the interest\r\nand animation of his narrative, in which stern realities exceed in\r\ngrandeur and wildness the creations of romance. But it is equally\r\nclear that he did not fully comprehend the moral of the scene. For,\r\notherwise, he could never, with these facts before him, have\r\nendeavoured by his Cyropædia, to recommend to his countrymen those\r\ninstitutions which rendered Persia, with all its wealth, a constant\r\nprey to the small republics of Greece.\r\n\r\nOf the other writings of Xenophon little need be said: they are the\r\nparsley and the rue of Greek literature, bordering and adorning its\r\nentrance, and therefore beheld of all. But most of these have their\r\nbeauty. Even in the hunting treatise, amid the breeding of dogs, and\r\nnets, and knives, and boar-spears, and the slaughter of animals, we\r\ncatch glimpses of better things,—of glades where the hare frolics by\r\nmoonlight, and grassy uplands, dewy and fragrant, where does, poetical\r\nas she of Rylstone, lead forth their fawns at break of day. The\r\ntreatises on the states of Athens and Sparta have, I trust, been\r\nfalsely attributed to this able and accomplished writer. They are\r\ncontemptible productions, conceived in the spirit of a servile\r\nflatterer of the Dorians, and of a satirist, equally servile and\r\nstupid, of the greater and infinitely more intellectual Ionic race.\r\n\r\nI pass over the historians known to us only by a few scanty fragments,\r\nthat I may at once come to the orators, the peculiar ornament and\r\npride of Greece, whose greatest statesmen were equally great as\r\nspeakers, more especially at Athens, where, as an art, eloquence was\r\nmost assiduously cultivated, and achieved its greatest triumphs.\r\nTradition attributes to Themistocles, to Pericles, to Alcibiades\r\nconsummate skill in guiding the currents of human sympathy, and a\r\nsense of their glory lingered on the high places of society like\r\nsunshine on the Alps long after they had quitted the world. But as\r\nthey did not augment the stores of their country’s literature, we can\r\nhave nothing to speak of them here. The orators whose fragments time\r\nhas been unable to destroy are however sufficient, if not to satiate\r\nour thirst of admiration, at least to show, by the grandeur of their\r\nproportions, how great and glorious Attic eloquence, when entire, must\r\nhave been. More than any other department of literature it is the\r\ngrowth of patience and toil. A man may be born with the instincts of\r\neloquence,—fancy, constitutional fire, vehemence,—but unless these\r\ninstincts be broken in and trained by consummate art, nature will in\r\nvain have bestowed her gifts. These truths were early understood at\r\nAthens. It was perceived that without eloquence political distinction\r\nwas unattainable, and therefore all who aspired to\r\n\r\n                “wield at will that fierce democracy,”\r\n\r\nsubjected themselves to a course of laborious study, to which our more\r\nphlegmatic natures would not submit.\r\n\r\nThe results we may, in part, still contemplate in that body of\r\nAthenian oratory, which to the author and the statesman is in itself a\r\nlibrary. Every legitimate form of eloquence is there beheld. In\r\nAntiphon and Andocides it appears in rough simplicity, employing\r\ncontrivance and art, but employing them awkwardly. Lysias makes\r\nconsiderable advances beyond them, clothes his style with grace,\r\nconstructs his narrative with extraordinary skill, and moves the\r\npassions by considerable pathos. Isocrates it is common with the\r\nmoderns, who echo one another, to underrate: their delicate ears,\r\noffended by his too nicely balanced periods, his antitheses, his\r\nmonotonous cadences, refuse to relish that stately harmony, and\r\nmajestic flow of language, which recommend the thoughts of this “old\r\nman eloquent,” whose greatest panegyric is pronounced by Plato[992] in\r\nthe Phædros. In Isæos we have an argumentative, able pleader; in\r\nDeinarchos a vigorous accuser; in Demades the power of splendid\r\nimprovisation; in Lycurgus noble sentiments clothed in poetical\r\nlanguage, haughty patriotism, the rough virtues of a stoic; in\r\nÆschines an union of magnificent style, thoughts full of weight,\r\nadmirable arrangement, warmth, vivacity, wit. Yet Demosthenes soars\r\nfar above Æschines,—far above all. On him nature had bestowed every\r\nquality which constitutes an ingredient of eloquence,—originality,\r\nlove of labour, a clear head, a warm heart, a judgment all but\r\nunerring, with an impetuous vehemence perfectly irresistible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 992:\r\n\r\n  Opp. t. i. p. 105. seq.—He is said to have received a thousand\r\n  drachmas for each of his pupils.—Dem. cont. Lacrit. § 11.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary impression is created by the study of this\r\nwriter. He seems never to put forth all his strength. You see him,\r\nindeed, bear down every thing before him, overwhelming the arguments\r\nand the gold of Philip, crushing his rivals, annihilating his enemies;\r\nbut the persuasion rests with you that he could have done more. You\r\ndiscover amid the waves and foam of his terrible eloquence indications\r\nthat that vast ocean had never been stirred to the bottom, that\r\noccasion had never called forth all its latent powers of destruction.\r\nHe measures himself with his antagonist, and is secure of victory. He\r\npresents a front bristling with the deadliest points of logic, like\r\nthe spears of the Macedonian phalanx, and wherever he moves he is\r\ninvincible. Nevertheless he appears to advance nothing for the sake of\r\neffect, to be in search of none of the beauties of style, but rather\r\nto avoid them. He is neither draped, nor painted, nor adorned; but a\r\nnaked colossus whose sublimity springs from the perfection and\r\ngreatness of its proportions.\r\n\r\nOther orators persuade, Demosthenes enforces conviction. They who\r\nlisten to him have no choice,—they must believe. Without offending the\r\nreader’s pride, he makes him ashamed to hesitate. He reminds one of\r\nthe Nile at the cataracts, where, confined by rocks within too narrow\r\nlimits, it pours resistlestly along, swelling, deep, with scattered\r\nwhirlpools and foam scarcely visible on its vast surface, seemingly\r\ncalm at a short distance, but, to those who look near, agitated,\r\nangry, full of unstemmable currents and boiling motion. He had\r\nprofoundly studied human nature, chiefly, of course, as it developes\r\nitself in free states, and, better than any man, knew by what motives\r\nit may, in spite of corruption and degeneracy, be impelled to\r\nstrenuous action, though but for a brief space. His language, flashing\r\nthrough the moral gloom around him, called forth bright reflections\r\nfrom whatever was brilliant or polished, and kindled the fragments of\r\npatriotic emotions into a flame. If genius could regenerate, could\r\npour the blood of youth into the veins of age, could substitute\r\nloftiness of sentiment, heroic daring, disinterested love of country,\r\nreligious faith, spirituality, for sensual self-indulgence, for sordid\r\navarice, for a base distrust in Providence, Demosthenes had renewed\r\nthe youth of Athens. The spirit of the old democratic constitution\r\nbreathes through all his periods. He stands upon the last defence of\r\nthe republican world, when all else had been carried, the\r\nrepresentative of a noble but perished race, fighting gallantly,\r\nthough in vain, to preserve that fragment sacred from the foot of the\r\nspoiler. The passion and the power of democracy seem concentrated in\r\nhim. He unites in his character all the richest gifts of nature under\r\nthe guidance of the most consummate art, and, doubtless, Hume was\r\nright when he said that, of all human productions, his works approach\r\nthe nearest to perfection.\r\n\r\nBeyond this point it is irksome to proceed in our view of Grecian\r\nliterature, which, after the battle of Cheronæa, was overshadowed by\r\ndespotism and dwindled gradually into insignificance. Not that genius\r\nwholly and suddenly disappeared. The soil of Hellenic intellect was\r\nnot entirely exhausted, but the fruit it bore was comparatively\r\ninsipid. A courtly stamp was set upon every thing. Men no longer\r\nobeyed their genuine impulses. It was dangerous generally, and always\r\nprofitless to be frank and manly. Instead of addressing themselves to\r\nthe healthy natural sympathies of the people, writers servilely\r\nlaboured by conceit and flattery to wring reluctant patronage from\r\nprinces. The spirit of affectation, accordingly, for the first time\r\nmade its appearance. Men tortured their ingenuity to invent smart\r\nthings. Enthusiasm and passion and earnestness, characteristics all of\r\npopular writers, are never fashionable among courtiers, who consider\r\nsincerity vulgar, and hypocrisy a virtue. In the later Greek writers,\r\ntherefore, who all wrote for some court or other, we discover the\r\nusual frigidity and extravagance which invariably deform the\r\nliterature of such states. Along with these faults, others also are\r\nfound far more pernicious: the inculcation of selfishness, gross\r\nsensuality, base maxims, a depraved taste. Man in the savage state is\r\na garden in which noxious weeds and the most beautiful flowers and\r\nuseful plants grow together; civilised and free, he is the same garden\r\ncleared, as far as possible, of its weeds; but, when verging a second\r\ntime into barbarism, the weeds again become luxuriant, and entirely\r\nchoke or conceal the flowers. And thus too it is in literature. In the\r\nliteratures of Greece, Rome, and modern Italy we can now contemplate\r\nthe complete process; in our own, a part only, how great a part—it is\r\nnot here my business to inquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                    SPIRIT OF THE GRECIAN RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the Greeks received their earliest system of philosophy from\r\nthe East, as is commonly believed, or themselves invented it, as to me\r\nseems most probable, there can I think be little doubt that once\r\nengaged in philosophical speculations they exhibited in the pursuit a\r\ndegree of boldness and originality, a patience of research, a power of\r\ncombination rarely if ever equalled in succeeding times. For some\r\nages, it is true, from the days of Thales down to those of Socrates\r\n(B. C. 600 to B. C. 450) physical investigations and researches\r\nchiefly occupied the philosophers of Greece. They conceived it to be\r\nwithin the power of man to discover the nature of the principal\r\nelements which compose the world, and the law’s that regulated its\r\nformation.[993] The origin likewise of the human race, of which\r\nnothing is yet known but that which has been revealed, naturally\r\nawakened their curiosity and led to many theories wild and fantastic\r\nin the extreme.\r\n\r\nFootnote 993:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Diog. Laert. Pr. iii. 4. Ἀρχαῖος μὲν οὖν τις λόγος καὶ πάτριος\r\n  ἐστὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις, ὡς ἐκ θεοῦ τὰ πάντα, καὶ διὰ θεοῦ ἡμῖν\r\n  συνέστηκεν.—Aristot. de Mund. c. 6. In c. 7. we have a curious list\r\n  of the various epithets of Zeus, whose name the Pseudo-Aristotle\r\n  conceives to signify the root of all existence: ὡς κᾄν εἰ λέγοιμεν,\r\n  δἰ ὅν ζῶμεν. This thought St. Paul expresses by the well-known\r\n  words—\"in whom we live and move and have our being.\" The author of\r\n  the Treatise De Mundo then quotes from the Orphic fragments a\r\n  passage, the doctrine of which strongly resembles the Pantheism of\r\n  Pope:\r\n\r\n          Ζεὺς πρῶτος γένετα, Ζεὺς ὕστατος ἀρχικέραυνος·\r\n          Ζεὺς κεφαλὴ, Ζεὺς μέσσα· Διὸς δ᾽ ἐκ πάντα τέτυκται·\r\n          Ζεὺς πυθμὴν γαίης τε καὶ οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος·\r\n          Ζεὺς ἄρσην γένετο, Ζεὺς ἄμβροτος ἔπλετο, νύμφη·\r\n          Ζεὺς πνοιὴ πάντων, Ζεὺς ἀκαμάτου πυρὸς ὁρμή·\r\n          Ζεὺς πόντου ῥίζα· Ζεὺς ἥλιος, ἠδὲ σελήνη·\r\n          Ζεὺς βασιλεὺς· Ζεὺς ἀρχὸς ἁπάντων ἀρχικέραυνος·\r\n          Πάντας γὰρ κρύψας αὖτις φάος ἐς πολυγηθὲς\r\n          Ἐξ ἱερῆς κραδίης ἀνενέγκατο μέρμερα ῥέζων.\r\n\r\n  Cf. Orphic. fragm. 6. p. 138.\r\n\r\nInto any consideration of these it is not my design to enter; but the\r\nGreeks had another philosophy, which, resting on the basis of\r\ntheology, comprehended religion, morals, and politics, and may be\r\nregarded as the instrument, the soul, and the measure of their\r\ncivilisation. It seems to be a truth frequently overlooked, that man\r\nis civilised exactly in proportion as he is religious; at least this\r\nwas the case in Greece, where the highest developement of the national\r\nmind concurred in Socrates and Plato with the utmost developement of\r\nthe religious instinct, and began immediately to decline in Aristotle\r\nand his successors, arriving at the lowest degradation among the\r\ngrovelling sophists of the lower empire. This division of philosophy\r\noccupied among the Greeks the place, which in modern times is assigned\r\nto religion,[994] that is, it was their guide through this life, and\r\ntheir preparation for a better. It may, indeed, be regarded as the\r\nspiritual part of paganism, teaching man his duties, and explaining\r\nthe grounds and motives which should lead to their performance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 994:\r\n\r\n  “Do good to all,” an evangelical precept (Plat. Rep. i. § 9. p. 33.\r\n  Stallb.), forming part of that philosophy which taught the Greeks\r\n  what was honourable and what base, what just and what unjust, what\r\n  was above all things to be desired and what avoided, how they were\r\n  to demean themselves towards the gods, towards their parents, their\r\n  elders, the laws, strangers, magistrates, friends, wives, children,\r\n  slaves: to wit, that they were to reverence the gods, honour their\r\n  parents, respect their elders, obey the laws, love their friends, be\r\n  affectionate to their wives, solicitous for their children,\r\n  compassionate towards their slaves.—Plut. de Educ. Puer. § 10.\r\n\r\nThere is one article of faith without which no religion can of course\r\nexist—the belief in God. Devoid of this, it may be doubted whether an\r\nindividual or a nation ought not rather to be classed among the\r\ninferior animals than among men. It is superfluous, therefore, to say\r\nthat the Greeks, preëminently endowed with the highest attributes of\r\nhumanity, were a religious people, and held firmly all the doctrines\r\nwhich entitle a people to such an appellation. From their ancestors,\r\nthe Pelasgi,[995] they inherited a pure and lofty theism, which seems\r\nto have always continued to be the religion of the more enlightened;\r\nwhile among the mass of the people, this central truth of religion was\r\ngradually surrounded by a constantly expanding atmosphere of fable,\r\nwhich obscured its brightness, and in a great measure concealed its\r\nform. Mr. Mitford, whose acute and philosophical mind clearly\r\ndiscerned this verity, also seems to have understood the cause. “A\r\nfirm belief both in the existence of the Deity, and in the duty of\r\ncommunication with him, appears to have prevailed universally in the\r\nearly ages. But religion was then the common care of all men, a\r\nsacerdotal order was unknown.”[996]\r\n\r\nFootnote 995:\r\n\r\n  Herod. ii. 52.\r\n\r\nFootnote 996:\r\n\r\n  History of Greece, i. 97. Dioscorides in Athenæus observes that no\r\n  sacrifice is so acceptable to the gods as that which is offered up\r\n  by members of a family living in unison.—i. 15. In the earliest ages\r\n  of the world the first-born of every family was esteemed a\r\n  prophet.—Godwin, Moses et Aaron, i. 6. 2.\r\n\r\nThe institution of an order of priests, however effected, almost\r\nnecessarily corrupted the simple truths of religion, but it is\r\nunphilosophical in the highest degree to consider those ancient\r\npriests as impostors on this account, or to speak of their propagation\r\nof error as craft. Meditating, in seclusion and solitude, on the few\r\ntruths which had come down to them by tradition or been discovered by\r\nreason, they soon bewildered their own wits, and wandered into\r\nsuperstition.[997] As was too natural, they conceived that the\r\nDivinity must be desirous of giving them signs, marking what was to be\r\ndone and what avoided. The mistake of concomitance for causation,\r\noften made in more learned and refined ages, would confirm them in\r\nthis view. They would, for example, find that in the order of time the\r\nflight of certain birds over their heads, the appearance of a serpent\r\nin their path, the apparition of certain objects in a dream, was\r\nfollowed by certain misfortunes; while other apparitions were\r\nsucceeded by contrary events. Out of these observations the science of\r\naugury, divination, &c. arose. Yet the inventors were not therefore\r\nimpostors, but rather, in their intentions, benefactors of mankind;\r\nand to be respected accordingly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 997:\r\n\r\n  Plato, Crit. t. vii. 146.\r\n\r\nThe generation of polytheism is to be in like manner explained. It was\r\nan abuse of the inductive method of philosophy. Men perceived, as soon\r\nas they began to observe nature and draw inferences from what they\r\nbeheld, that the sun and moon[998] exert extraordinary influence,\r\nbeneficial or hurtful, upon mankind and the world they inhabit; and\r\nthe supposition was neither unnatural nor absurd that those glorious\r\nbodies, by whose rising and setting, by whose approximation or\r\nretreat, they were in turn affected with gladness or melancholy, with\r\ncomfort or discomfort, with good or evil, must be themselves possessed\r\nof intelligence as well as power, or at least be inhabited and\r\ndirected by beings on whom they bestowed the name of gods. The air,\r\ntoo, “which bloweth where it listeth while thou canst not tell whence\r\nit cometh or whither it goeth,” sweeping around them invisibly, and\r\nappearing only in its effects, soon obtained the rank of a deity,[999]\r\nas did the ocean which appears to be alive in all its extent, and the\r\nearth on whose inexhaustible bounty we subsist.\r\n\r\nFootnote 998:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. t. viii. p. 182.\r\n\r\nFootnote 999:\r\n\r\n  The air was Zeus.—Lycoph. Cassand. 80. Meurs. Comm. p. 1179. To some\r\n  particular state of which the ancients alluded when they spoke of\r\n  Kronos seeking to devour his children and swallowing stones instead\r\n  of them. For the teeth of time which produce no effect on the air\r\n  appear to devour whatever is composed of the element of earth.\r\n  Mythologists, however, have generally omitted to remark that the\r\n  stones which Kronos mistook for his children were not ordinary\r\n  blocks of basalt or granite but rather so many statues of children\r\n  endued, _pro tempore_, with life.—Ἔτι δέ, φησὶν, ἐπενόησε θεὸς\r\n  Οὐρανὸς βαιτύλια, λίθοις ἐμψύχοις μηχανησάμενος.—Sanchon. ap. Euseb.\r\n  Præp. Evang. l. i. c. 10. p. 37.\r\n\r\nOut of these elements the sacerdotal families of Greece framed its\r\nreligion, which, however, is by no means to be considered a system of\r\nmaterialism. They conceived every portion of nature to be animated by\r\nits particular soul, just as they believed the whole, as a whole, to\r\nhave one universal soul, the source of all the others. Their mythology\r\nwas based on unity. At every step backwards we find the number of gods\r\ndiminish, till at length we arrive at the Great One, surrounded by the\r\nunfathomable splendours of eternity. This is the θεὸς ὁ θεῶν Ζεὺς, of\r\nwhom Plato[1000] and Aristotle constantly speak when they employ the\r\nexpression τὸ δαιμόνιον.[1001] Philosophy, indeed, considered it to be\r\nits chiefest task to deliver men from their multitudinous errors\r\nrespecting the nature of God, and of our duties towards Him; so that,\r\nin their speculative notions, very little difference from our own can\r\nbe detected. Above all men, Plato sought to elevate the sphere of\r\nphilosophy. In his works, in truth, it moves frequently within the\r\nconfines of theology, and seldom quits them except for the purpose of\r\ninfusing spirituality into politics and morals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1000:\r\n\r\n  Crit. t. vii. p. 173.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1001:\r\n\r\n  Poll. i. 5.\r\n\r\nThis great man, whose profound veneration for the Deity equalled,\r\nperhaps, that of Newton himself, conceived that human happiness\r\nconsists wholly in the knowledge of God, concerning whose character\r\nand attributes he was anxious that no unworthy ideas should be\r\nentertained. His doctrine was, “that we should ever describe God such\r\nas he is.” But, as Muretus has well observed, this was requiring too\r\nmuch of human nature, for, most assuredly, we should never speak of\r\nGod if we waited to discover language befitting His majesty. “For the\r\nmind of man is incapable of comprehending the essence of God; the\r\nnature of God is known to God alone; he alone perfectly understands\r\nhimself, and in himself all things. The mind of man waxes dim,\r\nbeholding that stupendous light whose brightness excels all other\r\nlights; and, in proportion as it endeavours more daringly to soar, is\r\nit conscious of falling below its great aim.”[1002] The Egyptians\r\nexpressed the same conviction in the celebrated epigraph on the base\r\nof the veiled statue of Neith at Saïs: “I am whatever has been, is, or\r\nshall be, and no mortal has drawn aside my veil.” To the same purpose\r\nwas the saying of Simonides to Hiero, “that the more he contemplated\r\nthe Divine Nature the less he appeared to comprehend it.” And\r\nSocrates, in the Philebos of Plato, observes that he shuddered as\r\noften as the Great Name was to be pronounced lest he should bestow\r\nupon it some unworthy epithet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1002:\r\n\r\n  Muret. ad Plat. Rep. p. 726.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, indeed, that the idea which the theologians of Greece\r\nhad formed of the Almighty was very nearly the same as our own;\r\nthough, in compliance with popular prejudices, they often made use of\r\nthe plural for the singular. Goodness, power, and knowledge were his\r\ncharacteristics, which in substance are the same as the types of the\r\ntheologians of modern times—goodness, immutability, truth,—goodness\r\nleading the van in both cases, and the remaining conditions answering\r\nperfectly to each other. For in supreme power and supreme wisdom must\r\nbe immutability and truth, since the Almighty can do all he wills and\r\nmust ever will what is right.[1003] In accordance with these views,\r\nthe spiritual philosophy of Greece maintained that the Deity is the\r\nsource of no evil, though traces of a far different theory are here\r\nand there discoverable among the poets. Thus, speaking of the\r\ncalamities arising from the anger of Achilles, Homer says\r\n\r\n                       Διὸς δ᾽ ἐτελείετο βουλή.\r\n\r\nAnd, again—\r\n\r\n            Ζεὺς δ᾽ ἀρετὴν ἄνδρασιν ὀφέλλει τε, μινύθει τε\r\n            Ὅππως κεν ἐθέλησιν.[1004]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1003:\r\n\r\n  Muret. ad Plat. Rep. p. 727.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1004:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, υ. 242. seq.\r\n\r\nSo, again, the two vases in the palace of Zeus, out of which he\r\ndistributed good and evil to mankind.[1005] Hesiod also introduces\r\nZeus, boasting that instead of fire he will give men a curse:—\r\n\r\n                  Τοῖς δ᾽ ἐγὼ ἀντὶ πυρὸς δώσω κακόν\r\n\r\nBut in all ages men lay their misfortunes at the door of Providence.\r\nHowever, though the notions men entertain of God be ever so just,\r\ntheir conduct will not be thereby influenced, or a religion, properly\r\nspeaking, created, unless several other truths be equally believed. It\r\nmust be established not only that the maker of the universe still\r\nregards his workmanship, and will punish all those who seek to\r\ndisorder the machine, by entailing remorse upon transgression, but\r\nthat man is not a fugitive being, who can escape out of the hands of\r\nGod by shrinking into annihilation, but a creature who, in accordance\r\nwith his will, must run the vast circle of eternity, co-lasting with\r\nGod himself.[1006] This is the great keystone of religion: without\r\nthis, men will believe that even the Almighty can have no hold upon\r\nthem; that they die, and their accountability ceases. The doctrine of\r\nimmortality, however, has everywhere opened the skies to man, and set\r\nhim upon the discovery of the steps leading thither, and, at the same\r\ntime, has checked his daring, and poisoned his guilty pleasures.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1005:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ω. 527. seq. Cf. Muret. p. 737.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1006:\r\n\r\n  Sch. Aristoph. Nub. 95.\r\n\r\nFrom the remotest ages the immortality of the soul constituted a\r\nleading dogma in the religion of Greece, and was necessarily\r\naccompanied by the persuasion, that to the good that immortality would\r\nbring happiness, and to the evil the contrary.[1007] Homer is full of\r\nthis, and the fables, wherein the enemies of God, parricides,\r\nmurderers, the perpetrators of impiety and wrong, are, after death,\r\nbanished to the depths of Tartarus, while various degrees of glory and\r\nhappiness, not altogether unlike what is sublimely shadowed forth by\r\nSt. Paul, are attributed to the good. That part, for example, of\r\nHeracles, which is divine, ascends to Heaven: Achilles enjoys the\r\neverlasting serenity of the Islands of the Blessed; and, generally,\r\nevery virtuous man who rightly performed his duty ascended to the\r\nmansion prepared for him in the stars, there to live for ever in\r\nhappiness.[1008] They taught, moreover, that the spirit of man is of\r\nheavenly birth: without this we had lived as so many animals. But God\r\nbestowed upon us an immortal soul, to watch as a guardian angel over\r\nthe body, and placed it in the loftiest part of our frame, to teach us\r\nto look upward, and remember our birth,—that men are not creatures of\r\nclay but children of God and heirs of immortality.[1009]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1007:\r\n\r\n  Among the people of the East we even discover traces of the doctrine\r\n  of the resurrection:—Καὶ ἀναβιώσεσθαι, κατὰ τοὺς Μάγους, φησὶ\r\n  (Θεόπομποσ) τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἔσεσθαι ἀθανάτους.—Diog. Laert. Pr.\r\n  vi. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1008:\r\n\r\n  Plato, Tim. Opp. vii. 45. Cf. p. 97.—Is there not some allusion in\r\n  the following passage to the scriptural account of the creation of\r\n  man before woman? Ὡς γάρ ποτε ἐξ ἀνδρῶν γυναῖκες καὶ τἄλλα θηρία\r\n  γενήσοίντο ἠπίσταντο οἱ ξυνιστάντες ἡμᾶς.—Tim. Opp. t. vii. p. 111.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1009:\r\n\r\n  Plato, Tim. Opp. t. vii. p. 137.\r\n\r\nIt will not, however, surprise those who comprehend the constitution\r\nof human nature, to find that the Greeks, deprived as they were of\r\nrevelation, were not content with the simple dogma of immortality,\r\nrendered happy or otherwise by rewards and punishments, but imagined a\r\nreturn of the soul to earth, and its passage through a long succession\r\nof bodies, until the stains,[1010] contracted during its first\r\nsojourn, had been obliterated: properly, therefore, their Hell was a\r\nkind of Purgatory, and, no doubt, suggested the original idea of that\r\nintermediate place to the Church of Rome. The religious part of the\r\npagan world, those especially who went through the ceremonies of\r\nexpiation and initiatory rites, firmly believed that bad men met in\r\nthe realms of Hades with a just retribution for their crimes, and were\r\nagain launched into the career of life, that they might receive from\r\nothers that which they had done unto them.[1011] Though even in those\r\ndays there were not wanting persons who affected to possess the power\r\nof absolution, nay, of granting for a moderate sum of money\r\nindulgences and licences to sin. These ragged impostors, of course,\r\npatronised only rich sinners, over whose heads vengeance might be\r\nhanging for crimes committed either by themselves or their ancestors,\r\n(since the Greeks also believed that the sins of the parents are\r\nvisited upon the children to the third and fourth generations,[1012])\r\nprofessing to be masters of arts and incantations by which the gods\r\nwere compelled to grant their prayers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1010:\r\n\r\n  Even among the ancient Christians this doctrine was not wholly\r\n  exploded. Origen believed it:—Λέγει δὲ καὶ ἄλλα παραλογώτατα· καὶ\r\n  δυσσεβείας πλήρη μετεμψυχώσείς τε γὰρ ληρωδεὶ καὶ ἐμψύχους τοὺς\r\n  ἀστέρας καὶ ἑτέρα τούτοις παραπλησία.—Phot. Bib. p. 3. seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1011:\r\n\r\n  Plato de Legg. ix. Opp. viii. 152. seq. Cf. 172. seq. 191. seq. De\r\n  Rep. i. Opp. vi. 9. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1012:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. ii. 7. t. i. p. 112. sqq. Stallb.—The belief that children\r\n  suffered for the crimes of their parents, which widely pervaded the\r\n  pagan world, is nowhere more clearly stated than by Plato:—Γὰρ ἐν\r\n  Αἵδου δίκην δώσομεν ὧν ἂν ἐνθαδε ἀδικήσωμεν, ἢ αὐτσὶ ἢ παῖδες\r\n  παῖδων.—Id. c. 8. p. 119.\r\n\r\nBut while the vulgar and the superstitious were thus deluded, they who\r\npossessed superior education and superior minds, united, with a belief\r\nin the future, a more cheerful faith in the justice and beneficence of\r\nthe Deity. They discovered, even by the light of reason, that human\r\nnature has been perverted from its original perfection,—that an evil\r\nprinciple has been introduced into our inmost essence,—that in our\r\nsinful state we are at enmity with God and all goodness,—and must by\r\nprayers and sacrifices be purified and reconciled to him ere we can\r\ntaste of happiness. On the subject of prayer the wiser Greeks\r\nentertained notions not wholly unbecoming a Christian.[1013] They well\r\nenough understood, that it is not to be considered as an importuning\r\nof God for wealth or fame or wisdom, or, as ignorant persons suppose,\r\nan impious desire that He would for our sakes depart from his eternal\r\npurposes; but merely the nourishing in our minds of a profound\r\nveneration for the Almighty, a trust in his Providence and wisdom, an\r\nhabitual disclosure voluntarily made of our inmost thoughts and\r\ndesires, which must be known to him whether we will or not. Hence the\r\ngreat philosopher of antiquity[1014] simply prayed for those things\r\nwhich it might please God to send, and that if he asked for anything\r\nwrong it might be denied him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1013:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Mitford, Hist. of Greece, i. 115. 8vo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1014:\r\n\r\n  Xen. Mem. i. 3. 2. Cf. Plut. Inst. Lac. § 26.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true, as Mr. Mitford[1015] has observed, that the Gods\r\nin Homer are sometimes introduced favouring the perpetrators of\r\ninjustice. But this is in contradiction to the general tone of the\r\nGreek religion; according to the tenets of which, every injured person\r\nhad his Erinnyes who avenged whatever wrongs or violence he might\r\nsuffer. Nay, even animals were comprised within the protecting circle\r\nof this beneficent superstition; and the God Pan was intrusted with\r\nthe punishment of excesses perpetrated against them,[1016]\r\n\r\n          “When vultures that, with grief exceeding measure,\r\n          Lament their heart’s lost treasure,\r\n          And o’er their empty nest, in torturing woe,\r\n          Pass to and fro,\r\n          Borne on their oarlike wings,\r\n          Missing the task that brings\r\n          Joy with it, send their piercing wail on high,\r\n          Apollo, Pan, or Zeus hearing the cry,\r\n          Charges th’ Erinnyes, though late,\r\n          The penalty decreed by Fate\r\n          To visit on the spoilers far or nigh.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1015:\r\n\r\n  Hist. of Greece, i. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1016:\r\n\r\n  Æsch. Agam. 55. sqq. with the commentary of Klausen. p. 104.—There\r\n  occurs in the Scriptures a like sentiment, “He who stilleth the\r\n  young ravens, when they cry.” So also the Mahomedan tradition, that\r\n  in the midst of a battle-field, where two mighty hosts were engaged,\r\n  God preserved from the hoofs of the chargers, and from the feet of\r\n  men, the lapwing’s nest.\r\n\r\nAnother doctrine, which we might scarcely expect to discover in\r\npaganism, constituted, nevertheless, a part of the Greek religion,—I\r\nmean the power of penitence. In all cases, indeed, this would not\r\navail. The laws of nature (πεπρωμένη, fate) would have their course\r\nwhatever might be the conduct or disposition of man; but in all other\r\ncases, tears[1017] shed in secret, solemn acts of religion, and deep\r\ncontrition were supposed to appease the anger of Heaven. Besides, when\r\nafflictions fell upon men, they were not necessarily regarded as\r\nevils; for by suffering, the soul, they thought, is purified,\r\nchastened, endued with wisdom,—\r\n\r\n                  “Sweet are the uses of adversity;”\r\n\r\nand, hence, of those trials which ignorance regards as evils, most, if\r\nnot all, are but so many dispensations of mercy, designed to work off\r\nthe dross of sin, and restore the spirit to its original\r\nbrightness.[1018] By these means, likewise, transgressors were\r\nbelieved to make some atonement for their crimes. Remembrance haunted\r\nthem even in sleep. Their miseries rose up before them, compassed them\r\nround, and urged them by invisible stripes into her track, “whose ways\r\nare ways of pleasantness, and all whose paths are peace.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1017:\r\n\r\n  Πηγὴ δακρύων—Soph.

Long withheld, the anger of the Gods descended at length\r\nin showers, utterly extirpating the evil-doers.[1019] Thus perished\r\nParis, the violator of marriage and of hospitable rites; thus\r\nClytemnæstra and Ægisthos, adulterers and murderers; thus the whole\r\nhouse of [OE]dipos, involved in an unutterable cycle of misery and\r\ncrime. The interval, moreover, between the commission of guilt and its\r\nfinal punishment, was given up to the Erinnyes,[1020] those dire and\r\nmysterious powers of vengeance, whose breathless chace after crime is\r\npourtrayed with so much sublimity by Sophocles. These divinities,\r\nstarting into instant birth, whenever blood was unlawfully shed,\r\nwalked perpetually beside the murderer to his grave,—to him alone\r\nvisible, to him alone audible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1019:\r\n\r\n  Pind.

Att. t. 12. p.\r\n  384.\r\n\r\nThe gross and carnal-minded contrived, indeed, in the case of lesser\r\ntransgressions, to remain blind to this deformity, while youth and\r\nhealth and prosperity cast their illusions over their path. But age in\r\nthis matter sharpened their sight. On drawing near the brink of the\r\ngrave, the vices, hitherto so blythe and comely, appeared to grow more\r\nshrivelled and hideous and unlovely than their own impure\r\ncountenances, and they would then fain have parted company with them.\r\nBut, no! Having been comrades of their own choosing, Zeus chained them\r\nto their side to the last, unless repentance severed the link; and\r\ntheir fearful howlings, night and day, broke their repose, harrowed up\r\ntheir feelings, augmented tenfold their terrors, while sweat and\r\ntears, and agonising shrieks burst from them even in their dreams. The\r\nwicked, therefore, in the deepest darkness of paganism, were not left\r\nwholly to the error of their ways. But God reserved himself a witness\r\nin their hearts, and set up a light by which they might rightly, if\r\nthey chose, direct their footsteps. It is true that the cardinal\r\nverities of religion were then but very imperfectly perceived, that,\r\nto get at them at all, men had to break through the shells of many\r\nfables, and that, when found, they must be for the most part enjoyed\r\nin secret, far from the din of ambition. Not, indeed, that the people\r\nrefused their sympathy to virtue,—public opinion is never so far\r\ncorrupted,—but that in the world there has always existed a strong\r\ncurrent bearing men far from the track of duty and holiness.\r\n\r\nThere was, no doubt, some degree of fanaticism mixed up with all this.\r\nThe priesthood, an order of men much calumniated, but without whom\r\nsociety would be worse by far than it is, found it necessary to allure\r\nmen into the bosom of their church by imposing ceremonies, by\r\nsacrifices, and by the mysterious disclosure of certain truths in the\r\nperformance of certain rites. It will be seen that I allude to the\r\nmysteries. On the occasion of initiation, as if to intimate that men\r\ncannot be virtuous or religious by proxy, each individual became his\r\nown priest and sacrificed[1021] for himself. But in what initiation\r\nitself consisted, no man knows. Antiquity has revealed nothing, and\r\nnothing can we discover. The hypotheses of scholars are, therefore, so\r\nmany dreams, and a mere waste of ingenuity; for, if they should by\r\nchance hit the mark, there exist no means of proving that they have\r\ndone so. But of this we are sure, that a persuasion was widely spread\r\nthat a blissful immortality awaited the initiated. A greater degree of\r\nholiness was supposed to attach to them,—there was a spell shed around\r\ntheir persons,—in situations of danger they experienced less of the\r\nfear of death. In storms, for example, at sea, when the ship seemed\r\nabout to sink—\"Have you been initiated?\" was the question men asked\r\neach other. Still, among philosophers, the wisest and best sometimes\r\nneglected this popular consummation of a pious life. Socrates belonged\r\nnot to this communion, a circumstance which rendered it more easy to\r\nfasten upon him the charge of impiety, in those days more atrocious\r\nthan now, since, to be esteemed inimical to the gods, was the surest\r\nway to make enemies of men. Further than this, it is not necessary\r\nthat I enter into the gentile faith, which only incidentally, as it\r\naffected morals, belongs to my subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1021:\r\n\r\n  Schol. Aristoph. Acharn. 712.\r\n\r\nBut there exists in all countries a minor cycle of superstitions,\r\nwhich, more strongly perhaps than anything paints the peculiarities of\r\nthe national character. In the north, as we know, this indigenous\r\nbelief has survived all changes in the public creed, and will subsist\r\nto the last, lingering among our woods, our ruins, our moonlit\r\nmeadows, our churchyards, by our firesides. Fairies, witches, ghosts,\r\ngoblins can by no advances in civilisation be put to flight. They sail\r\nin our steamers on the ocean, ride at quickest speed along the\r\nrailroads, go to bed with the first lady in the land, and even nestle\r\nbeneath the statesman’s vest.[1022] With us these aërial beings, or\r\nspectres of crime, too commonly assume an aspect grotesque or\r\ndevilish, but they nevertheless keep alive in the popular mind the\r\nspirit of romance and poetry, one of the never-failing handmaids of\r\nreligion. Mythology rarely penetrates down to these primitive\r\nsuperstitions, which, however, constitute the basis of the whole\r\nscience, and in Greece assumed, in many cases, forms of beauty\r\nanalogous to its loftier and more poetic fables.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1022:\r\n\r\n  See, for example, Lord Castlereagh’s vision of the fire-devil in Mr.\r\n  Lockhart’s Life of Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nThe place occupied in our own popular mythology by the\r\n“light-sandalled fays,” was in Greece filled by the Hamadryads and\r\nNymphs.[1023] No wood or grove or solitary tree, no fountain or rill\r\nin moss-grown cell or rustic cavern, existed without its co-existent\r\ndivinity, female generally, and instinct with beauty and beneficence.\r\nThese creatures, the Jinn and Jinneh of the Arabs, extended their\r\ndominion over all minor streams, and sported, in the softness and\r\nstillness of night, athwart the billows silvered by the moon; but the\r\ndeities of great rivers, as the Acheloös, the Peneios, and others,\r\nwere male. Being only a few degrees raised above humanity, they were\r\noften enamoured of mortals, to whom they appeared arrayed in\r\nloveliness, amid the glimmering forests, at dawn or twilight, or when\r\n\r\n                             “overhead the moon\r\n                       Wheels her pale course.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1023:\r\n\r\n  The same superstitions, a little modified, are still found in many\r\n  parts of Greece. “The religious feelings of the Cretan, in the\r\n  nineteenth century, differ very little, if at all, from those\r\n  entertained for the Naïads by his heathen ancestors.”—Pashley, Trav.\r\n  in Crete, i. 89.\r\n\r\nIt was not always, however, that the love of a nymph proved a\r\nblessing. There were occasions when, having for a moment revealed\r\ntheir superhuman charms to some shepherd in his romantic solitude, or\r\nto some poet worshiping the muses alone, beside the inspiring mount or\r\nspring, they again capriciously withdrew, and left him vision-smitten\r\nto pine or, perchance, to die.\r\n\r\nNor were the Greeks wholly devoid of belief in evil spirits, for the\r\ndemon Alastor,[1024] which was a deification of the principle that\r\nincites to crime and afterwards brings vengeance, can in no way be\r\nregarded as good. Typhon, too, with the Giants and Titans, had at\r\nleast a predominance of evil in their character, but these are treated\r\nof at length by the mythologists. Several superstitions, commonly\r\nsupposed to be wholly Oriental, were current in Greece, such as that\r\nmen had the power by using certain spells to quit their mortal forms\r\nand roam disembodied through the earth. By magic rings, too, and\r\nhelmets they might be rendered invisible, and, thus protected, enter\r\ninto the secret chambers of kings, pollute their wives, and rifle\r\ntheir treasures.[1025] Means, moreover, they had, confounded in those\r\nages with supernatural power, of charming poisonous serpents, as to\r\nthis day is done by the subjects of our Eastern empire, and the\r\nsnake-catchers of Egypt; and though it be now known that opium\r\nconstitutes no small portion of this charm, the people generally, both\r\nin the East and West, conceive other influences to be employed than\r\nthose of legitimate art.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1024:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Poppo, Proleg. in Thucyd. i. 14. Xenarchos observes that the\r\n  home perishes when conflicting fortunes attach to the master, and\r\n  into which the Alastor creeps:\r\n\r\n                             φθίνει δόμος\r\n                    ἀσυντάτοισι δεσποτῶν κεχρημένος\r\n                    τύχαις, ἀλάστωρ τ᾽ εἰσπέπαικε.\r\n\r\n  Ap.

Stallb.\r\n\r\nThere was not in later times, perhaps, that boundless faith in spells\r\nand transformations still subsisting in the East. But in the earlier\r\nages, and in the gloomy mountain recesses of Arcadia, events equally\r\nstrange were supposed to have happened. Thus Lycaon having sacrificed\r\nan infant to Zeus Lycæos, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar,\r\nimmediately became a wolf;[1026] and it was reported that any one who\r\nperformed this dreadful sacrifice, and afterwards by accident tasted\r\nof the human entrails, when mingled with those of other victims,\r\nforthwith underwent the same transformation.[1027] Thus we find the\r\ngloomy legend of the Breton forests existing in the heart of the\r\nPeloponnesos, where there can, I fear, be little doubt, that human\r\nvictims were habitually offered up. Another ancient superstition,\r\nwhich found its way into Italy, was, that a person first seen by a\r\nwolf lost his voice, whereas if the man obtained the prior glimpse of\r\nthe animal no evil ensued.[1028]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1026:\r\n\r\n  Paus. viii. 2, 3.

Rep. i. 37.\r\n\r\nThe belief in ghosts, coeval no doubt with man, flourished especially\r\namong the Greeks. Hesiod entertained peculiar notions on this subject,\r\nwhich some suppose to have been borrowed from the East, that is, he\r\nbelieved that the good men of former times became, at their decease,\r\nguardian spirits, and were entrusted[1029] with the care of future\r\nraces. Plato adopts these ghosts, and gives them admission into his\r\nRepublic, where they perform an important part and receive peculiar\r\nhonours.[1030] When they appeared, as sometimes they would, by day,\r\ntheir visages were pale and their forms unsubstantial like the\r\ncreations of a dream.[1031] But, as among us, they chiefly affected\r\nthe night for their gambols, and in Arcadia particularly, would appear\r\nto honest people returning home late in cross-roads, and such places\r\nwhence they were not to be dislodged but by being pelted apparently by\r\npellets made from bread crumb, on which men had wiped their fingers,\r\ncarefully preserved for this purpose by the good folks about\r\nPhigaleia.[1032]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1029:\r\n\r\n  Hes. Opp. et Dies, 121. seq. where see Goettling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1030:\r\n\r\n  De Rep. v. 15. t. i. 377. seq. The Magi, among whom supernatural\r\n  sights and powers were most familiar, maintained that the Gods\r\n  occasionally appeared to them, and that the atmosphere is filled\r\n  with spectral shadows, which, floating about like mists or\r\n  exhalations, are visible to the sharpsighted.—Diog. Laert. Pr. vi.\r\n  9. A similar belief prevailed among the early anchorites. “It was\r\n  their firm persuasion, that the air which they breathed was peopled\r\n  with invisible enemies; with innumerable dæmons who watched every\r\n  occasion and assumed every form, to terrify, and, above all, to\r\n  tempt, their unguarded virtue.”—Gibbon, vi. 263.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1031:\r\n\r\n  Æsch. Agam. 68.—Klaus. Com. p. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1032:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 31.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable prank played by any ancient ghosts, however, with\r\nwhose history I am acquainted, did not take place in Greece, but in\r\nthe Campagna di Roma, where, after a bloody battle between the Romans\r\nand the Huns, in which all but the generals and their staff bit the\r\ndust, two spectral armies, the ghosts of the fallen warriors, appeared\r\nupon the field to enact the contest over again. During three whole\r\ndays did these valiant souls of heroes, as the Homeric phrase is,\r\ncarry on the struggle; and the historian who relates the fact, is\r\ncareful to observe that they did not fall short of living soldiers,\r\neither in fire or courage. People saw them distinctly charge each\r\nother, and heard the clash of their arms. Similar exhibitions were to\r\nbe seen in different parts of the ancient world. In the great plain of\r\nSogda,[1033] for example, spectral armies of mighty courage but\r\nvoiceless, were in the constant habit of engaging in mortal combat at\r\nthe break of day. Caria likewise possessed a favourite haunt of these\r\nwarlike phantoms. But here the apparition was only occasional, and all\r\nits evolutions were performed in the air, which was the case in\r\nEngland, as we have been assured by very old people, before the\r\nbreaking-out of the American war. Another fray of ghosts took place\r\nevery summer in Sicily on the plain of the Four Towers, but in this\r\ncase the whole business was carried on at noon, to the no small\r\nannoyance of Pan who usually takes his siesta at that hour,—that is,\r\nif they were as noisy in their battles as the Campanian\r\nspectres.[1034]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1033:\r\n\r\n  Which had once been a lake.—Vit. Isidor. ap. Phot. Bib. p. 839.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1034:\r\n\r\n  Phot. Bib. p. 339.\r\n\r\nLike the Roman Catholics, the Greeks had great faith in miraculous\r\nimages, holy wells, &c. and their descendants still maintain the same\r\ncreed. Near the Church of Haghia Parthenoë in Crete, is a most copious\r\nfountain deriving its name from the same holy and miracle-working\r\nvirgins to whom the church is dedicated, and who also preside over the\r\nwaters. “The worship of the headless body of Molos has also its\r\nparallel in modern times.”[1035] As the Cretan Christians for many\r\nyears reverenced the head of Titus, though deprived of its body, so\r\ntheir heathen ancestors used annually to honour by a religious\r\nfestival the body of Molos, the well-known father of Meriones, though\r\ndeprived of its head. The legend, told to explain the ancient ceremony\r\nin which the headless statue of a man thus exhibited, was that “after\r\nMolos got possession of a nymph’s person without having first obtained\r\nher consent, his body was found, but his head had disappeared.”[1036]\r\nAn image of the Virgin travelled by water from Constantinople to\r\nGreece, where it was shortly after seen standing up in the waves near\r\nMount Athos. Similar legends obtained of old. Near Biennos in\r\nCrete,[1037] “has been dug up the bones and skulls of giants, many of\r\nwhom were eight or ten times the size of common men.”[1038]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1035:\r\n\r\n  Pashley, Travels in Crete, i. 88.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1036:\r\n\r\n  Pashley, Travels in Crete, i. 177.—Plut. de Orac.

Prophetesses are frequently\r\nspoken of in Scripture, and in the Acts of the Apostles[1040] is given\r\nan account of a young female slave who brought her master large sums\r\nof money by this trade, which was that of a gipsy. Others there were\r\nwho, like many among the Orientals, professed to understand the\r\nlanguage of birds. A slave, said to possess this knowledge, is\r\ncelebrated, by Porphyry, and was probably from the East.[1041] One\r\nsort of divination was practised by pouring drops of oil into a vessel\r\nand looking on it, when they pretended to behold a representation of\r\nwhat was to take place. This in Egypt is still practised, merely\r\nsubstituting ink for oil, and a great many travellers appear to\r\nbelieve in it. Soldiers going to war were especially liable to fall\r\ninto this kind of foolery.[1042]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1039:\r\n\r\n  See Max. Tyr. Diss. iii. p. 31–38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1040:\r\n\r\n  C. xvi. v. 16. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1041:\r\n\r\n  De Abstinentiâ, iii. Cf. Cedren.

Acharn. 1106.\r\n\r\nThe use of holy water on entering temples is of great antiquity. This\r\ncustom was called περίῤῥανσις, and the act was performed with the\r\nbranch of the fortunate olive.[1043] There stood at the door of the\r\ntemple a capacious lustral font, whose contents had been rendered holy\r\nby extinguishing[1044] therein a lighted brand from the altar; thence\r\nwater was sprinkled on themselves, by worshipers or by the officiating\r\npriest. A similar apparatus stood at the entrance to the Agora, to\r\npurify the orators, &c. going to the public assembly. It was likewise\r\nplaced at the door of private houses, wherein there was a corpse, that\r\nevery one might purify himself on going out.[1045] Superstitious\r\npersons usually walked about with a laurel leaf in their mouth, or\r\noccasionally bearing a staff of laurel, there being a preserving power\r\nin that sacred shrub: hence arose the proverb δαφνίκην φορῶ\r\nβακτήριαν,—\"I carry a laurel staff,\" when a man would say, I have no\r\nfear. Persons not thus protected it is to be presumed were terrified\r\nif a weasel or dog crossed their path; and the omen could only be\r\naverted by casting three stones at it, the number three being\r\nexceedingly agreeable to the gods. Certain fruits would not burst on\r\nthe tree if three stones were cast into the same hole with the seed\r\nwhen the tree was planted. Two brothers walking on the way conceived\r\nit ominous of evil if they happened to be parted by a stone. On every\r\ntrifling occasion altars and chapels were erected to the gods,\r\nparticularly by women; no house or street was free from them. For\r\nexample, if a snake crept into the house through the eaves, forthwith\r\nan altar was erected. At places where three roads met, stones were set\r\nup, to be worshiped by travellers, who anointed them with oil. If a\r\nmouse nibbled a hole in a corn-sack, they would fly to the portent\r\ninterpreter, and inquire what they should do,—\"Get it mended,\" was\r\nsometimes the honest reply. Horrid dreams[1046] might be expiated, and\r\ntheir evil effects be averted, by telling them to the rising sun. When\r\nthe candles spit, it was a sign of rain.[1047] During thunder and\r\nlightning they made the noise called _Poppysma_,[1048] which it was\r\nhoped might avert the danger. On board ship sailors entertained the\r\nidea, that to carry a corpse would be the cause of shipwreck, as\r\nhappened to the vessel which was bearing to Eubœa the bones of\r\nPelops.[1049] The sailors of the Mediterranean, for this reason, will\r\nrefuse to receive mummies on board.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1043:\r\n\r\n  Ramo felicis olivæ.—Virgil.

I do not say that, after all, this\r\nis not the conclusion we should come to. Reason may possibly be on our\r\nside; but certainly it appears to me, that too little pains has\r\nhitherto been taken to arrive at the truth; and as it is a\r\nconsideration by no means unimportant, I have bestowed on it more than\r\nordinary attention in the hope of letting in additional light, however\r\nlittle, on this obscure and unheeded department of antiquities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1050:\r\n\r\n  Describing the approach to the temple of Aphrodite, Lucian says:\r\n  εὐθὺς ἡμῖν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ τοῦ τεμένους Ἀφροδίσιοι προσέπνευσαν\r\n  αὖραι.—Amor. § 12. These gentle airs should breathe into the style\r\n  and language of the author who treats of the women of Greece; but,\r\n  in my own case, research I fear and the effects of fifty-two degrees\r\n  of north latitude will prevent this consummation so devoutly to be\r\n  wished.\r\n\r\nIn form the Greek woman was so perfect as to be still taken as the\r\ntype of her sex. Her beauty, from whatever cause, bordered closely\r\nupon the ideal, or rather was that which, because now only found in\r\nworks of art, we denominate the ideal. But our conceptions of form\r\nnever transcend what is found in Nature. She bounds our ideas by a\r\ncircle over which we cannot step. The sculptors of Greece represented\r\nnothing but what they saw,[1051] and even when the cunning of their\r\nhand was most felicitous, even when loveliness and grace and all the\r\npoetry of womanhood appeared to breathe from their marbles, the\r\ninferiority of their imitations to the creations of God, in properties\r\nbelonging to form, in mere contour, in the grouping and developement\r\nof features, must have sufficed to impress even upon Pheidias, that\r\nhigh priest of art, the conviction of how childish it were to dream of\r\nrising above nature. The beauty of Greece was, indeed, a creature of\r\nearth, but suggested aspirations beyond it. Every feature in the\r\ncountenance uttered impassioned language, was rife with tenderness,\r\ninstinct with love. The pulses of the heart, warm and rapid, seemed to\r\npossess ready interpreters in the eye. But, radiant over all, the\r\nimagination shed its poetic splendour, communicating a dignity, an\r\nelevation, a manifestation of soul, which lent to passion all the\r\nmoral purity and enduring force that belong to love, when love is\r\nleast tainted with unspiritual and ignoble selfishness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1051:\r\n\r\n  On the beauty of the modern Greek women I can speak from my own\r\n  observation; but most travellers are of the same opinion, and Mr.\r\n  Douglas, in particular, gives the following testimony in their\r\n  favour: “Though the delicacy of her form is not long able to sustain\r\n  the heat of the climate and the immoderate use of the warm bath, I\r\n  can scarcely trust myself to describe the beauty of a young Greek\r\n  when arriving at the age which the ancients have so gracefully\r\n  personified as the Χρυσοστέφανος Ἥβη. Were we to form our ideas of\r\n  Grecian women from the wives of Albanian peasants we should be\r\n  strangely deceived; but the islands of Andro, Tino, and, above all,\r\n  that of Crete, contain forms upon which the chisel of Praxiteles\r\n  would not have been misemployed.”—Essay, &c. p. 159.\r\n\r\nI despair, however, of representing by words what neither Pheidias nor\r\nPolycletos could represent in marble or ivory. The women of Greece\r\nwere neither large nor tall. The whole figure, graceful but not\r\nslender, left the imagination nothing to desire. It was satisfied with\r\nwhat was before it. Limbs exquisitely moulded,[1052] round, smooth,\r\ntapering, a _torso_ undulating upwards in the richest curves to the\r\nneck, a bosom somewhat inclined to fulness, but in configuration\r\nperfect, features in which the utmost delicacy was blended with\r\nwhatever is noblest and most dignified in expression. Both blue eyes\r\nand black[1053] were found in Greece, but the latter most commonly.\r\nEven Aphrodite, spite of her auburn hair, comes before us in the Iliad\r\nwith large black eyes, beaming with humid fire. No goddess but the\r\nAttic virgin has the cold blue eye of the North, becoming her maidenly\r\ncharacter, reserved, firm, affectionate, with a dash of shrewishness.\r\nThe nose was straight and admirably proportioned, without anything of\r\nthat breadth which in the works of inferior sculptors creates an idea\r\nof Amazonian fierceness. Beauty itself had shaped the mouth and chin,\r\nand basked and sported in them. In these, above all, the Grecian woman\r\nexcelled the barbarians. Other features they might have resembling\r\nhers, but seldom that Attic mouth, that dimpled, oval, richly-rounded\r\nchin, which imprinted the crowning characteristic of womanhood upon\r\nher face, and stamped her mistress of man and of the world.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1052:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Winkelmann, iv. 4. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1053:\r\n\r\n  Plat. Repub. iv. t. vi. p. 167.—That black eyes were most common\r\n  among the Greeks may be inferred from this, that, in describing the\r\n  parts of the eye, they called the iris τὸ μέλαν, which is sometimes\r\n  of one colour, and sometimes of another.—Arist. Hist. Anim. I. viii.\r\n  2. He observes, further on, that some persons had black eyes, others\r\n  deep blue, others gray, others of the colour of goats.—§4. Other\r\n  animals have eyes of one colour, except the horse, which has\r\n  sometimes one blue eye. Eyes moderate in size and neither sunken nor\r\n  projecting were esteemed the best.—§. 5. Large eyes, likewise, were\r\n  greatly admired. Hence Hera is called βοῶπις by Homer. Aristœnetos,\r\n  describing his Laïs, says: ὀφθαλμοὶ μεγάλοι τε καὶ διαυγεῖς καὶ\r\n  καθαρῷ φωτὶ διαλάμποντες.—Scheffer ad Æl. Hist. Var. xii. 1. With\r\n  respect to the colour of the hair see Winkelmann, iv. 4. 38. It was,\r\n  of course, considered a great beauty to have it long, and,\r\n  therefore, Helen, in honour of Clytemnæstra, cut off the points\r\n  only.—Eurip. Orest. 128. seq.\r\n\r\nA creature thus fashioned and gifted with an intellect which, if less\r\nrobust and comprehensive, is equally active with that of man and still\r\nmore flexible, could scarcely be degraded into a domestic drudge and\r\nslave, and in Greece was not.[1054] Already, in the heroic ages, women\r\noccupied a commanding position in society, somewhat less honourable\r\nthan is their due, but, in many respects, higher and more to be envied\r\nthan was appropriated to them in the ignorant and corrupt times of\r\nchivalry which the Homeric period has been thought greatly to\r\nresemble. In those days, though fashion required more reserve in the\r\nfemale character than is consistent with the spirit of modern manners,\r\npersons of different sexes could meet and converse together without\r\nscandal. Gentlewomen of the highest rank went abroad under their own\r\nguidance. On the arrival of a foreign ship upon the shore we find an\r\nArgive princess descending without any male protector to cheapen\r\narticles of dress and trinkets, which however, as the event proved,\r\nwas not without danger, for both she herself and a number of her maids\r\nwere carried away captives by the perfidious strangers.[1055]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1054:\r\n\r\n  On the respect paid to women, see Demosth. in Ev. et Mnes. § 11.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1055:\r\n\r\n  Herodot. i. 1.\r\n\r\nHomer abounds with proofs both of the liberty women enjoyed and the\r\nhigh estimation in which they were held. They were quite as much as is\r\nconsistent with prudence and delicacy the companions of men.[1056] And\r\nin more than one particular, as in the bathing[1057] and perfuming of\r\ndistinguished male guests, the manners of those times allowed of or\r\nrather enjoined familiarities greater than the customs of any\r\ncivilised modern nations permit. Ladies lived at large with their\r\nhusbands and families in the more frequented parts of the house, dined\r\nand drank wine with them, rode or walked out in their company, or,\r\nattended by a female servant, and were, in fact, in the modern sense\r\nof the word, mistresses of the house and everything it contained.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1056:\r\n\r\n  Athen. i. 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1057:\r\n\r\n  Describing the beauty of Hippodameia, daughter of Anchises, Homer\r\n  says, she excelled all the maidens of her age in beauty, skill in\r\n  female accomplishments, and endowments of the mind, for which reason\r\n  Alcathoos, the noblest man in Troy, chose her to be his wife.—Iliad,\r\n  ε. 480. sqq. He must necessarily, therefore, have enjoyed\r\n  opportunities of studying her character. Another illustration of the\r\n  freedom of heroic female manners is furnished by the author of the\r\n  Little Iliad, who relates that, when Aias and Odysseus were\r\n  contending for the armour of Achilles, the Greeks, by the advice of\r\n  Nestor, sent certain scouts to listen beneath the battlements of\r\n  Troy to the conversation of the virgins who, in the cool of the\r\n  evening, it may be presumed, were wont to walk upon the ramparts and\r\n  converse frankly of the exploits of their illustrious enemies.—Sch.\r\n  Aristoph. Equit. 1051. Cf. Il. ζ. 239.\r\n\r\nWhen the husband happened to be absent it was not, indeed, considered\r\ndelicate, if the mansion was filled with youthful and petulant guests,\r\nfor the wife to be seen much among them,[1058] though it still appears\r\nto have been incumbent upon married ladies to exercise the rites of\r\nhospitality, which sometimes, as in the case of Helen, opened the way\r\nto intrigue and elopement. A similar event, veiled in mythological\r\nobscurity, shipwrecked the virtue of Alcmena.[1059] Clytemnæstra, too,\r\nand Ægialeia the wife of Diomede, fell before the temptations afforded\r\nby the absence of their lords,[1060] while Penelope surrounded with\r\nyouthful suitors, assailed by reports of her husband’s death,\r\nalternately soothed and menaced, remained true to her vows and became\r\nto all ages the pattern of conjugal fidelity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1058:\r\n\r\n  Hom. Odyss. α. 330. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1059:\r\n\r\n  Apollod. ii. 4. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1060:\r\n\r\n  Ovid. Ibis. 349. seq. Tzetz. ad Lycoph. 384. 1093.\r\n\r\nThe examples are many of the facility of their intercourse with\r\nstrangers. Sthenobœa wife of Prœtos, king of Argos, must have enjoyed\r\nnumerous occasions of being alone with Bellerophon before she could,\r\nlike the wife of Potiphar, have tried his honour and forfeited her\r\nown.[1061] Helen after her return to Sparta, banquets and associates\r\nfreely with strangers at the table of her husband, where, by her\r\nconversation and remarks, we discover how quick and penetrating the\r\nunderstanding of women was in those ages supposed to be. Nothing could\r\nbe further from the mind of those heroic warriors than the idea of\r\nregarding woman merely as an object of desire, or as a household\r\ndrudge.[1062] If she receives praise for her beauty, or industrious\r\nhabits, still more is she celebrated for her mental endowments, for\r\nher wisdom, for her maternal love. Where in fiction or in life shall\r\nwe find a lady more gentle, more graceful, more accomplished, more\r\ngifted with every charm of womanhood than Helen, who, nevertheless,\r\nfalls a prey to seduction! Where more feminine tenderness, or truer\r\nlove than in Andromache? Where more matronly sweetness and dignity\r\nthan in the Phæacian Arete; more unblameable vivacity, blithe\r\nunreserve, greater sensibility, united with the noblest maiden\r\nmodesty, self command and proud consciousness of virtue, than in that\r\nloveliest of poetical creations her daughter Nausicaa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1061:\r\n\r\n  Apollod. ii. 3. 7. Sch. Aristoph. Ran. 1041.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1062:\r\n\r\n  Hesiod suggests a luxurious picture of female life in the heroic\r\n  ages.—Opp. et Dies. 519. seq.\r\n\r\nHomer himself felt all the charm of this exquisite creation and\r\nlingered over it with the fondness of a parent. She is the very flower\r\nof the heroic age. In the rapid glimpse afforded us of her life, we\r\ndiscover what the condition and occupations of a noble virgin were in\r\nthose primitive times, a felicitous mixture of splendour and\r\nsimplicity, approaching nature in the rough energy of the passions,\r\nwith feelings healthy and vigorous and happy in the utter absence of\r\nsickly sentimentality. Though daughter to a king Nausicaa does not\r\ndisdain to care for the family wardrobe. Her nuptial day is not far\r\ndistant, and, agreeably to the nature of her sex in all ages, she is\r\ndesirous that her dress should on that occasion appear to the best\r\nadvantage, but to her father modestly feigns to think principally of\r\nher brothers.[1063] Alcinoos aware of the feint, smiles inwardly while\r\nhe approves of her solicitude. With his ready permission she piles the\r\ngarments on the royal car drawn by mules, and then, mounting the seat\r\nwhip in hand, departs for the distant rivulet accompanied by her\r\nmaids. Of these girls, the poet says, two, clothed by the graces with\r\nloveliness, used to sleep in the Princess’s chamber one on either side\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the secluded spot, the umbrageous embouchure of a mountain\r\nbrook where they usually performed their lowly task, it was their\r\nfirst care to unharness the mules, which were turned loose to graze on\r\nthe shore. Their labours occupy them but a portion of the morning, and\r\nthese concluded, they dine sumptuously enough, in some shady nook\r\noverlooking the stream, on wine and viands brought along with them\r\nfrom the palace. To remove every idea of sordid toil and fatigue Homer\r\nis careful to represent them full of life and animal spirits, bounding\r\nsportively along the meadows, having first bathed and lubricated their\r\nlimbs with fragrant oils. The game which engages them while their\r\nrobes and veils are drying on the pebbly beach received in later ages\r\nthe name of Phæninda,[1063] and consisted in throwing a ball\r\nunexpectedly from one individual to another of a large party scattered\r\nover a field. As it was uncertain to whom the person in possession of\r\nthe ball would cast it, every one was on the watch, and much of the\r\nsport arose from the eagerness of each to catch it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1063:\r\n\r\n  See Book II. v2-Chapter III.\r\n\r\nIn this game the princess takes part, laughing and singing with the\r\nrest, and it is a clumsy throw of hers which sends the ball into the\r\nriver that excites the loud exclamation from her maids which awakens\r\nOdysseus. Her conversation with the hero thereupon ensuing suggests a\r\nhigh notion of female education at the period. The maids of honour\r\nterrified at his strange and grotesque appearance, unclothed, and\r\ndeformed with ooze and mud, take to flight, but Nausicaa relying on\r\nthe respect due to her father maintains her ground. Odysseus\r\nreverencing her youth and beauty prefers his petition from a distance.\r\nShe grants far more than he seeks, and with many indications of female\r\ngentleness mingles so much self-possession, forethought, compassion\r\nfor misfortune, consideration of what is due to her own character, and\r\nconfidence in the generosity and unsuspicious goodness of her parents,\r\nthat we are constrained to suppose the existence of much instruction,\r\nmental training, and knowledge of the world. And if such\r\nqualifications had not at that time been found in women, Homer had\r\nmuch too keen a sense of propriety to have hazarded his reputation and\r\nhis bread by supposing their prevalence in his poems.[1064]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1064:\r\n\r\n  Clytemnæstra, again, in Æschylus exhibits considerable knowledge of\r\n  geography, which she could only have acquired from conversation with\r\n  travellers or from the songs of the poets.—Agamemn. 287. sqq.\r\n\r\nHow the women of the heroic times received their instruction it is not\r\ndifficult to comprehend, though there has come down to us very little\r\npositive information on the subject. The poets, those prophetic\r\nteachers of the infancy of humanity, had already commenced their\r\nrevelations of the good and beautiful. Wandering from town to town,\r\nunder the immediate direction of Providence, they scattered far and\r\nnear the seeds of civilisation. Their songs were in every mouth: both\r\nyouths and maidens imbibed the wisdom they contained, and with their\r\nsprightly strains, as in the case of Nausicaa, enlivened their lighter\r\nmoments when alone, or delighted the noble and numerous guests at\r\ntheir fathers’ board. Homer, indeed, nowhere introduces a lady singing\r\nat an entertainment, excepting in Olympos, where the Muses represent\r\nthe sex; but Æschylus, a poet profoundly versed in antiquity, speaks\r\nof Iphigenia as performing this sweet office in her father’s\r\nhall.[1065] The daughter of Alcinoos, however, shares in the\r\namusements and instruction supplied by the bard during the\r\nentertainment described by Homer, and converses freely with their\r\nillustrious guest.[1066]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1065:\r\n\r\n  And Theocritus enumerates among the accomplishments of Helen, that\r\n  she could sing and play upon the cithara.—Eidyll. xviii. 35. sqq. et\r\n  Kiesling ad Theocrit. Cf. Æneid. vi. 647.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1066:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. θ. 457. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1067:\r\n\r\n  Apophthegms, Old and New, § 278.\r\n\r\nWe have above seen that women in those ages were not creatures of mere\r\nluxury or show. Possessing considerable physical power and energy, and\r\nmuch skill in the elegant and useful arts of life, they were deterred\r\nby no false pride or ignorant prejudices from converting their\r\ncapacity to the use of their families. The magnificence of their\r\nattire, their costly ornaments, or the consciousness of the highest\r\npersonal beauty, nowise interfered with their thrifty habits; and Lord\r\nBacon[1067] tells a very good anecdote to show that the same in former\r\ndays was the case in England. There was a lady of the West country, he\r\nsays, who gave great entertainments at her house to most of the\r\ngallant gentlemen of her neighbourhood, among whom Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nwas one. This lady, though otherwise a stately dame, was a notable\r\ngood housewife, and in the morning betimes she called to one of her\r\nmaids that looked to the swine, and asked, “Is the piggy served?” Sir\r\nWalter’s chamber being near the lady’s, he heard this homely inquiry.\r\nA little before dinner the lady came down in great state to the\r\ndrawing-room, which was full of gentlemen, and as soon as Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh saw her, “Madam,” says he, “is the piggy served?” To which the\r\nlady replied, “You know best whether you have had your breakfast.”\r\n\r\nAn Homeric princess resembled this stately dame of the West, in\r\nthinking nothing beneath her which could contribute to the comfort or\r\nelegant adornment of those she loved. The employments of women in\r\nthose ages, however, included some things which, in the present state\r\nof the useful arts, would seldom fall to their share, and among these\r\nwere the labours of the loom, to excel in which was evidently\r\nconsidered one of their chiefest accomplishments and most necessary\r\nduties.[1068] In this occupation they took refuge from anxiety and\r\nsorrow; to this we find Hector with rough tenderness urging his\r\nbeloved wife to have recourse, when her affection would withdraw him\r\nfrom his post;[1069] and Telemachus, in a tone somewhat too\r\nauthoritative, recommends, in the Odyssey, the same course to his\r\nmother:[1070] and in the Eastern world the same tastes and habits\r\ncontinued to prevail down to a very late age. When Sisygambis, the\r\ncaptive Persian queen, was presented, however, by Alexander with\r\npurple and wool, she sank into an agony of grief and tears: they\r\nreminded her of happier days. But the conqueror, misunderstanding her\r\nfeelings, and desirous to remove the notion that he was imposing any\r\nservile task, observed:—\"This garment, mother, which you see me wear,\r\nis not merely the gift but the work also of my sisters.\"[1071] Similar\r\npresents passed between near relations in Persia; for in Herodotus we\r\nfind Amestris, the queen of Xerxes, conferring upon her husband, as a\r\ngift of price, a richly variegated and ample pelisse, which the\r\nlabours of her own fair hands had rendered valuable.[1072] Augustus,\r\ntoo, even when all simplicity of manners had expired with the\r\nrepublic, affected still to bring up the females of his family upon\r\nthe antique model, and wore no garments but such as were manufactured\r\nin his own house.[1073]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1068:\r\n\r\n  Alexand. ab Alexand. iv. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1069:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ζ. 491.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1070:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. α. 357.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1071:\r\n\r\n  Q.

Homer. iv. 34.\r\n\r\nTo return: constant practice and the delight which familiar and\r\nvoluntary labour inspires, had already in the heroic ages, enabled the\r\nGrecian ladies to throw much splendour and richness of invention into\r\ntheir fabrics. The desire also, perhaps, of excelling in works of this\r\nkind the ladies of Sidon, communicated an additional impulse to their\r\nindustry. At all events, Homer makes it abundantly clear that they\r\nunderstood how to employ with singular felicity the arts of design,\r\nand to represent in colours brilliant and varied, cities, landscapes,\r\nhuman figures, and all the complicated movements of war.[1074] We\r\nmust, no doubt, allow something for the poet’s own skill in painting;\r\nbut, after every reasonable deduction, enough will remain still to\r\nprove that at the period of the Trojan war Greece had made remarkable\r\nprogress in every art which tends to ameliorate and embellish human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1074:\r\n\r\n  In northern Greece and Macedonia women could depict such scenes from\r\n  the life, since they learned the use of arms, and engaged personally\r\n  in war.—Athen. xiii. 10. Tradition relates that Queen Matilda and\r\n  her maids wrought the tapestry of Bayeux, representing the conquest\r\n  of England by her husband.\r\n\r\nCarding, also, and spinning entered into the list of their\r\noccupations. Even Helen though frail as fair, is laborious as a\r\nPenelope, plying her shuttle or her golden distaff, and surrounded\r\nhabitually by a troop of she-manufacturers.[1075] Arete, queen of\r\nPhæacia, is likewise depicted sitting at the fire, distaff in hand,\r\nencircled by her maids;[1076] and the wife of Odysseus, famed for her\r\nhousehold virtues, is seen in the Odyssey at her own door spinning the\r\npurple thread.[1077] The work-baskets of the ladies of that period, if\r\nwe can rely on a poet’s word, were such as more modern dames might\r\nenvy, formed of beaten gold and chased with figures richly wrought,\r\nand grouped with infinite taste and judgment.[1078] In these their\r\nballs of purple were deposited when spun, though probably reed baskets\r\nor osier work contented the ambition of ladies less aspiring than\r\nEuropa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1075:\r\n\r\n  Iliad, ζ. 491.—Odyss. δ. 131.—Theocrit.

Eidyll. ii. 37. seq.\r\n\r\nWomen also, but chiefly slaves, performed in those primitive times all\r\nthe operations of the kitchen. They even in the great establishment of\r\nAlcinoos work at the mill, as they do also in the palace of Odysseus,\r\nwhere guided perhaps by the nature of the climate we find the young\r\nwomen preferring for this operation the cool of the night.[1079] Even\r\nin later ages, when juster ideas of what is due to the sex prevailed,\r\nthis severe toil sometimes devolved upon female slaves, though in\r\ngeneral it was the males, and of these the most worthless, who worked\r\nthe mills, regarded at length almost in the light of correctional\r\nestablishments.[1080] But the making of bread was very properly\r\nappropriated to women almost throughout the East. The Egyptians,\r\nindeed, an effeminate and servile people, very early, as we learn from\r\nGenesis, confounded the offices of the sex; but among the Lydians,\r\neven in the palace of Crœsos, we meet with a female baker,[1081] and\r\nthe Persian armies carried along with them women to bake their bread\r\nin their longest and most dangerous expeditions.[1082] In Greece to\r\npreside over the oven, was up to a very late period the prerogative of\r\nthe fair. One hundred and ten women had the honour of being locked up\r\nwith the handful of warriors who during three years baffled the whole\r\nforce of the Peloponnesos from the glorious walls of Platæa,[1083] and\r\nin the primitive ages of Macedonia the queen herself prepared the\r\nbread distributed among the royal shepherds.[1084]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1079:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. η. 103. seq.—ο. 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1080:\r\n\r\n  Theoph.

To behold the daughter of Bethuel\r\nor of Laban coming forth to draw water for her flock, does not strike\r\nus as at all out of keeping with the opulence or dignity of her\r\nfather, or with her own feminine delicacy; and we know that at this\r\npresent day the wealthiest Bedouin Sheikh of the desert, though lord\r\nof a thousand camels, discovers nothing in his daughter’s condition\r\nwhich should relieve her from this healthful employment. Similar\r\nnotions prevailed among the Greeks of the Heroic Age. For though in\r\nmany cases slave-maidens[1085] are found engaged in drawing water from\r\nthe springs, virgins of noble birth, nay the daughters themselves of\r\nkings, descend to the fountain with their urns, mingling there with\r\nfemale captives and young women of inferior rank. Thus, for example,\r\nthe princess of the Lestrygons in Homer goes forth with her\r\nwater-jar[1086] to the well, and even among the Athenians, where\r\nrefinement of manners first sprang up, and civilisation made most\r\nrapid strides, the daughters of the citizens in early times used to\r\ndescend to the fountain of Callirrhoe to draw water.[1087] But the\r\ntask was commonly allotted to female captives and other slaves.\r\nEuryclea, Odysseus’ house-keeper, sends a troop of girls on this\r\nerrand with orders to be quick in their movements, and Hector, in his\r\ndeep fear for Andromache, already in apprehension beholds her toiling\r\nat the fountains of Argos.[1088]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1085:\r\n\r\n  Eurip.

Their education and exercises promoting their health and\r\nphysical energies, aided, at the same time, the natural developement\r\nof the frame, with all its inherent symmetry and proportion. It is\r\nprobable, however, that the charms of Helen may have led on this point\r\nto some misapprehension; but Helen belonged to the old heroic race,\r\nwith which the Dorians of Sparta had nothing in common, that is, like\r\nso many other women celebrated by the poets of after times for their\r\nbeauty, was an Achæan. Still, lovely they were, well-formed, brilliant\r\nof complexion, with features of much regularity, and eyes into which\r\nexuberant health infused a sparkling brightness irresistibly pleasing.\r\nBut it would require to be peculiarly constituted to pronounce them\r\nthe most beautiful women in all Greece.[1089] They were what in modern\r\nphrase would be termed fine women, but exceeding considerably what we\r\ndeem true feminine proportions, being, in fact, a sort of female\r\ngrenadiers, robust, vigorous, bull-stranglers, as Lysistrata[1090]\r\nsomewhat ironically expresses it, their beauty was rather that of men,\r\nthan of women. Some among the Greeks preferred, it is true, ladies of\r\nthis large growth. Thus, we find Xenophon, in the Anabasis, expressing\r\nhis apprehension that should his countrymen become acquainted with the\r\nfine tall women of Persia, they would, like the Lotos-eaters, forget\r\nthe way to their country and their home.[1091] But this was a taste\r\nwhich never became general. The beauty which excited most admiration,\r\nwhere beauty constituted the noblest object of literature and art, was\r\na kind totally different in character, exquisitely feminine, gentle,\r\nsoft, retiring, modest, instinct with grace and delicacy, the parasite\r\nof the moral creation, clinging round man for support, but imparting\r\nmore than it receives.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1089:\r\n\r\n  See Müll. Dor. ii. 296.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1090:\r\n\r\n               Ὧ φιλτάτη Λάκαινα, χαῖρε.\r\n               οἷον τὸ κάλλος, γλυκυτάτη, σοῦ φαίνεται.\r\n               ὡς δ᾽ εὐχροεῖς, ὡς δὲ σφριγᾷ τὸ σῶμά σου,\r\n               κἂν ταῦρον ἄγχοις.\r\n\r\n  Which may be thus translated:\r\n\r\n         Beloved Laconian, welcome!\r\n         How glorious is thy beauty, love! how ruddy\r\n         The tint of thy complexion!

Lysist. 78 sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1091:\r\n\r\n  Anab. iii. 2. 25.—Ἀλλὰ γὰρ δέδοικα μὴ, ἂν ἅπαξ μάθωμεν ἀργοὶ ζῇν,\r\n  καὶ ἐν ἀφθόνοις βιοτεύειν, καὶ Μήδῶν δὲ καὶ Περσῶν καλαῖς καὶ\r\n  μεγάλαις γυναιξὶ καὶ παρθένοις ὁμιλεῖν, μὴ, ὣσπερ οἱ λωτοφάγοι,\r\n  ἐπιλαθώμεθα τῆς οἴκαδε ὁδοῦ.—And again, in the Cyropædia, Araspes\r\n  praises Panthea for her majestic size. It appears from Homer that\r\n  when Athena was desirous of making Penelope appear more lovely than\r\n  ordinary, she added to her height.—Odyss. σ. 194.\r\n\r\nSuch beauty, however, would have been inconsistent with the aim of\r\nLycurgus. Like a well-known modern despot, this great legislator aimed\r\nsolely at creating a nation of grenadiers, and to effect this, both\r\nthe education, laws, and manners of Sparta received a military\r\nimpress. Everything there breathed of the camp. The girls from their\r\ntenderest years, instead of being instructed as in other communities\r\nto entwine all their feelings round the domestic hearth, and expect\r\ntheir chiefest happiness at home, were systematically undomesticated,\r\nbrought incessantly into contact with men, initiated in immoral\r\nhabits, subversive of the female character,[1092] and taught to\r\nconsider themselves designed to be the wives of the state rather than\r\nof individuals. Nature, the legislator was aware, has implanted the\r\nprinciples of love and modesty deep in the female heart; in general\r\nalso, to eradicate one, is to root up the other; and both in the sense\r\nin which we contemplate them, being inimical to the purpose which his\r\nconstitution was intended to promote, he sought to subvert the power\r\nof love by obliterating from the female mind every trace of maidenly\r\nmodesty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1092:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 79.—Even Plutarch denominates the system of discipline\r\n  observed by the Spartan women ἀναπεπταμένη καὶ ἄθηλυς,—\"lax and\r\n  unfeminine,\"—and confesses that it afforded the poets an\r\n  inexhaustible fund for ridicule. Ibycos, for example, called them\r\n  φαινομηρίδες: and Euripides ἀνδρομανεῖς. Their education, in fact,\r\n  rendered them coarse and domineering, “bold and mannish;”\r\n  θρασύτεραι, and ἀνδριοδεῖς, are the words of Plutarch, who observes\r\n  that they desired not only to rule by violence at home, but even\r\n  audaciously to meddle with public affairs.—Compar. Lycurg. cum Num.\r\n  § 3.\r\n\r\nThe power of political institutions over the feelings of the heart,\r\nover manners, over habits, over conscience, and opinions, was never so\r\nstrikingly exemplified as at Sparta. Whatever the legislator\r\ndetermined to be good was good.[1093] Example, affection, nature\r\npleaded in vain. An iron system, strong as fate, encircled the whole\r\nscope of life, repressing every aspiration tending above the point\r\nprescribed, guiding every wish into a given channel, curbing every\r\npassion inconsistent in its full developement with the views of the\r\nlegislator. Aristotle, indeed, maintains that while the men of Sparta\r\nconformed to the design of the constitution, the women refused to bend\r\ntheir neck to the yoke, and persisted in the enjoyment of a freedom\r\nconstantly degenerating into licentiousness.[1094] He probably,\r\nhowever, supposes the existence in Lycurgus of a moral purpose, far\r\nloftier than he really aimed at. The virtues of a camp—and Sparta was\r\nnothing else—are never too rigid, nor must we look among female\r\ncamp-followers for much of that delicacy, reserve, self-control, or\r\nkeen sense of what is just and upright, of which none judge more\r\naccurately than well educated women. Doubtless the Doric lawgiver\r\ncherished no other design than to promote the happiness of his\r\ncountrymen. It would be unjust to suppose otherwise. But how far the\r\nregulations by which he sought to effect this purpose were calculated\r\nto ensure success, is what we have to inquire.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1093:\r\n\r\n  Philosophers, also, were found in antiquity as in modern times, who\r\n  theoretically maintained this doctrine. Thus Archelaos contended,\r\n  καὶ τὸ δίκαιον εἶναι καὶ τὸ αἰσχρὸν οὐ φύσει, ἀλλὰ νόμῳ.—Diog.\r\n  Laert. ii. 4. 3. Here we discover the fundamental maxim upon which\r\n  the whole system of Hobbes was constructed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1094:\r\n\r\n  Polit. ii. 9.\r\n\r\nIt may at once be observed that Lycurgus’s system of female education\r\nwas the furthest possible removed from common place. He contemplated\r\nboth the sexes in nearly the same point of view. Their form he saw;\r\nand in many points their character, their affections, their virtues,\r\ntheir vices, bear a close resemblance; and in his conception,\r\nperfection would be attained, if all such discriminating marks as\r\nnature has set up could be removed, and every quality of what he\r\nconsidered the superior sex transferred to the inferior. Much\r\nmisapprehension appears to exist on this point. Writers pretend that\r\namong the Dorians the female character stood in high estimation, while\r\nthe reverse they suppose to have been the case in Ionic States. But\r\nthe Dorians betrayed their contempt for women as they came from the\r\nhands of nature, by endeavouring to convert them into men; their\r\nneighbours the reverse, by contenting themselves with their purely\r\nfeminine qualities, which among people of Ionic race were cultivated\r\nand improved, perhaps, as far as was consistent with domestic\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIn the harems of the East the whip is of great service in\r\nmaintaining order, and the same, it is evident, was the case at\r\nSparta. Both youths and virgins from their tenderest years were\r\nsubjected to a severe discipline; regular floggers, as at our own\r\ngreat schools, always attended the inspectors of public instruction;\r\nand in this the system was wise, that habits were more regarded than\r\nacquisitions.[1095] But of the habits cherished by the Spartan\r\nsystem we cannot always approve. Like the boys, the virgins\r\nfrequented the gymnasia, where, naked as at their birth, they\r\nexercised themselves in wrestling, running, pitching the quoit, and\r\nthrowing the javelin.[1096] To these accomplishments, others,\r\naccording to a Roman poet, still less feminine were added. They\r\ncontended, he says, in the ring with men, bound the cestus on their\r\nclenched fists, and boxed their future husbands like so many\r\nprize-fighters. No wonder that the partners of such women were\r\nhenpecked. Horsemanship, the sword exercise, and the rough sports of\r\nthe chase, affected by women of similar character in our own\r\ncountry, completed the circle of female studies,[1097] and rendered\r\nthe Spartan maids something more than a match for their worse\r\nhalves, whether after marriage or before.[1098]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1095:\r\n\r\n  Jamblich. vit.

Polit. ii. 9.\r\n\r\nSome pains have in our own days been taken to pare away the\r\nroughnesses, and obliterate the peculiar features of the Doric\r\neducational institutions, in order to bring them into greater\r\nuniformity with modern notions. There is no probability, we are told,\r\nthat either youths or men were permitted to be present at the\r\nextraordinary exhibition of the female gymnasia.[1099] But whence is\r\nthis inference derived? From the delicacy of Spartan manners in other\r\nrespects? And are we in fact reduced on this curious point to depend\r\non inferences and probabilities? On the contrary, we are informed by\r\nantiquity that besides the personal advantages of health and vigour,\r\nderived to the women themselves, the legislator contemplated others\r\nlittle less important, the promotion of marriage and the recreation of\r\nall the useful portion of the citizens. For while the married men and\r\nyouths intent on connubial happiness, enjoyed the free entry to these\r\ngymnasia,[1100] those sullen egotists called bachelors were very\r\nproperly excluded. The former had some property in the young ladies,\r\nwho were their daughters, sisters, or future spouses, but persons\r\navowedly indifferent to the seductive influence of female charms could\r\nhave no business there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1099:\r\n\r\n  Müll. Dor. ii. 333.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1100:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lycurg. § 14. 15. Müller, with the amusing partiality of an\r\n  apologist, overlooks the passage, and introduces Plutarch affirming\r\n  “that they only witnessed the processions and dances of the young\r\n  (wo)men.” Note K. Dor. ii. p. 328. Here though _men_ be the printed\r\n  word in the English translation women must be clearly meant. Even\r\n  so, however, the assertion is unfounded, since we find that even\r\n  strangers were admitted:—ἐπαινεῖται δὲ καὶ τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν τὸ ἔθος τὸ\r\n  γυμνοῦν τὰς παρθένους τοῖς ξένοις. Athen. xiii. 20. The islanders of\r\n  Chios would appear to have imitated this laudable practice, since\r\n  the sophist speaks of it as a most pleasant spectacle to behold the\r\n  youths and virgins wrestling together in the public place of\r\n  exercise. Ibid.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, therefore, that when the Spartan virgins[1101] performed in\r\nthe gymnasia, for we must consider their exercises partly in the light\r\nof scenic exhibitions, the whole city, bachelors excepted, could be\r\npresent, it remains to be seen what other accomplishments they could\r\ndisplay for the public entertainment. Singing and dancing it has been\r\nshown were practised publicly by ladies of rank in the heroic ages,\r\nand this feature of ancient manners was preserved at Sparta, where not\r\nyouths and maidens only, but even the grave and aged joined, during\r\nseveral great festivals, in the dance and the song.[1102] But we must\r\nbeware how we apply to these performances the ideas suggested by those\r\nof modern times, or the gay and graceful movements of Ionian women. To\r\ndance at Sparta required great physical force.[1103] The maidens,\r\nunencumbered by dress, bounded aloft like an Anatole or a Taglioni,\r\nbut instead of twirling round with one foot on earth, and the other\r\nsuspended at right angles in air, the supreme merit of her performance\r\nconsisted in slapping the back part of the body with her heel for the\r\ngreatest possible number of times in succession.[1104] In this feat,\r\nwhich resembles strongly a Caribbee or Iroquois accomplishment, whole\r\ntroops of men and women often united; an exhibition which with the\r\nshouts of laughter arising from the bystanders, the grins of the\r\ngirls, and the wilful mistakes of young men who might send their feet\r\nin the wrong direction, must convey a curious idea of Spartan gravity.\r\nSuch, however, was the celebrated dance called _Bibasis_,[1105] upon\r\nthe frequent execution of which a Laconian girl prided herself no less\r\nthan a modern lady on her activity in the indecent waltz.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1101:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Plato. De Legg. t. viii. p. 85.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1102:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lycurg. §. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1103:\r\n\r\n  As now among the Galaxidiotes.

Lysistr. 82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1105:\r\n\r\n  Pollux. iv. 102.\r\n\r\nBut the other dances in which the Spartan maidens excelled were\r\nnumerous. Among them was the _Dipodia_[1106] of which the nature is\r\nnot exactly known, but it was accompanied by music and song and\r\napparently consisted of a series of orgiastic movements, like those\r\nof the Bacchantes when, inspired by wine, they bounded fawnlike with\r\ndishevelled hair along the mountains.[1107] On other occasions their\r\nmovements were designed to express certain passions of the mind,\r\nsometimes, as in the _Calabis_,[1108] highly wanton and licentious,\r\nthough the latitudinarian spirit of paganism contrived to admit them\r\namong the religious ceremonies, and that too in honour of Artemis.\r\nAnother of these lewd dances performed in the worship of Apollo and\r\nhis sister, and accompanied by songs, conceived no doubt in the same\r\nspirit, was the _Bryallicha_[1109], which the historian of the Doric\r\nrace finds some difficulty to reconcile with the worship of Apollo,\r\nas if their deity had been himself free from the inherent vices of\r\nthe Olympian dynasts. There was another dance called the\r\n_Deicelistic_[1110], a kind of rude pantomime intermingled with\r\nsongs supposed to have been performed by unmarried women[1111].\r\n\r\nFootnote 1106:\r\n\r\n  Scaliger’s idea of the dance is peculiar: Erat et διποδία, in quâ\r\n  junctis pedibus labore plurimo et conatu picas imitabantur.

Dor. ii. 335.\r\n\r\nTo these dances may be added the _Hyporchematic_, which was executed\r\nby a chorus, while singing, for which reason Bacchylides says, “This\r\nis not the work of slowness or inactivity.” By Pindar it is described\r\nas a dance performed by Spartan girls; but in fact both young men and\r\nwomen united in the Hyporchema, and as this dance is said to have\r\nresembled or been identical with the Cordax[1112], it will assist us\r\nin forming a notion of female delicacy at Sparta, where young women\r\ncould execute publicly in company with the other sex a dance scarcely\r\nless indelicate than the fandango or bolero[1113].\r\n\r\nFootnote 1112:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Accordingly we find Laconian\r\nladies of the first rank,—Cynisca daughter of king Archidamos, for\r\nexample,—attending to the breed of horses, and sending chariots to\r\ncontend at the Olympic games. Nor was her masculine ambition\r\ncondemned by the Greeks. A statue of the lady herself, together\r\nwith her chariot, and charioteer, existed among other Olympian\r\nmonuments in the age of Pausanias. Afterwards many other women,\r\nbut chiefly among the half barbarous Macedonians, followed the\r\nexample of Cynisca and Euryleonis another Spartan dame who had\r\nbeen honoured with a statue at Olympia for the success of her\r\nchariot at the games.[1114]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1114:\r\n\r\n  Pausan. iii. 15. 1. 17. 6. Cf. Vandal. Dissert. vii. p. 562. seq.\r\n\r\nIn strict keeping with the rough manners and masculine bearing of\r\nthese ladies was the habit of swearing,[1115] to which in common with\r\nmost other Greek women they were grievously addicted. At Athens,\r\nhowever, gentlewomen swore by Demeter, Persephone and Agraulos,[1116]\r\nan oath by divinities of their own sex[1117] being considered more\r\nsuitable to female lips; but the viragos of Sparta spiced their\r\nconversation with oaths by Castor and Polydeukes. According, moreover,\r\nto the poet whose testimony is commonly adduced against the Athenian\r\nladies, the women of Sparta drank[1118] as well as swore, and we know\r\nfrom authority altogether indisputable, that in the age of Socrates\r\ntheir licentiousness had already become universally notorious in\r\nGreece.[1119] A scholar, and a diligent inquirer, whose merits are too\r\noften overlooked, observes very justly that it was probably the\r\nausterity, or more properly the pedantry of Lycurgus’s institutions\r\nthat gave rise to the notion that chastity was a common virtue at\r\nSparta.[1120] It was supposed because occasionally subjected to\r\nviolent exercise, that they must necessarily be temperate in their\r\npleasures. But we might _à priori_ have inferred the contrary, and the\r\nuniform testimony of antiquity proves it. Their wantonness and\r\nlicentiousness knew no bounds. Even during the ages immediately\r\nsucceeding the establishment of their constitution, that is at the\r\ntime of the Messenian wars, to preserve for any length of time their\r\nchastity while their husbands were absent in the field was beyond\r\ntheir power, and substitutes were selected and sent home to become the\r\nhusbands of the whole female population.[1121]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1115:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph.

She was then received into the house of the\r\nbridesmaid, where her hair was cut short and her dress exchanged for\r\nthat of a young man, after which custom directed that she should be\r\nleft reclining on a pallet bed, in a dark chamber, alone. Thither the\r\nbridegroom repaired by stealth, and, afterwards, with equal secresy,\r\nreturned to his companions, among whom he continued for some time to\r\nlive as if no change in his condition had taken place. During this\r\nperiod, therefore, their union must be regarded rather as a\r\nclandestine intercourse than a marriage, since the husband continued,\r\nas at first, to steal secretly into the company of his wife and to\r\neffect his escape with equal care, it being considered disreputable\r\nfor them to be seen together.

Lac. i. 6. Plut. Lycurg. § 15.—Ubbo Emmius. Descr.\r\n  Reip. Lacon. p. 96. seq.\r\n\r\nA different account is given by other authors of the marriage ceremony\r\nat Sparta, but, if properly examined, both relations may very well be\r\nreconciled. The above, in fact, appears to have been the ordinary mode\r\nwhen young women of property who had dowries[1125] to bestow upon\r\ntheir husbands, were to be disposed of. But the portionless girls,\r\nexcepting, perhaps, the more beautiful, finding some difficulty in\r\nproviding themselves with helpmates, a contrivance was hit upon by the\r\nlegislator, calculated to give a fair chance to all. The unmarried\r\ndamsels of the city, thus circumstanced, were shut up in the dark, in\r\na spacious edifice,[1126] into which the young unmarried men were\r\nintroduced to scramble for wives, the understanding being, that each\r\nwas to remain content with the maiden he happened to seize upon. And\r\nit would appear that the awards of chance were, in most cases,\r\nsatisfactory, since we read of no one but Lysander who abandoned the\r\nwife he had thus chosen. He, however, having been presented, by\r\nfortune, with a maiden of homely features, immediately deserted her\r\nfor one more beautiful. The bad example thus set was not without its\r\nevil consequences, for the men who married his daughters put them away\r\nin like manner after his death.[1127] But, in both cases, fines for\r\ncontumacy were exacted by the Ephori. According to the laws of Sparta,\r\nmen were likewise fined for leading a life of celibacy,[1128] for\r\nmarrying late, or for marrying unsuitably. Thus, king Archidamos was\r\nfined for selecting a little woman to be his queen, as if there was\r\nsomething regal in loftiness of stature.[1129]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1125:\r\n\r\n  According to Justin, indeed, the Spartan legislator abolished the\r\n  usage of dowries: Virgines sine dote nubere jussit, ut uxores\r\n  eligerentur, non pecuniæ; severiusque matrimonia sua viri\r\n  coërcerent, cum nullis dotis frœnis tenerentur, iii. 3. But\r\n  Aristotle, who had deeply studied the polity of Sparta, gives a very\r\n  different account:—ἔστι δὲ καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν σχεδὸν τῆς πάσης χώρας\r\n  τῶν πέντε μερῶν τὰ δύο, τῶν τ᾽ ἐπικλήρων πολλῶν γινομένων, καὶ διὰ\r\n  τὸ προῖκας διδόναι μεγάλας.—Polit. ii. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1126:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1127:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Lysand. § 30.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1128:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1129:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Agis, § 2. Athen. xiii. 20. It was not without reason,\r\n  perhaps, that the Ephori interfered with the marriages of their\r\n  kings, since royalty has everywhere been capricious. But these\r\n  honest magistrates were sometimes tyrannical in their ordinances and\r\n  behaviour. Thus, when Anaxandrides married his niece for love,\r\n  because she had no children he was compelled by them to take a\r\n  second wife. When the first wife was confined they, fearing\r\n  imposition, or feigning incredulity, sat about her bed.—Herod. v.\r\n  39–41.\r\n\r\nOn almost every point connected with Spartan marriages the accounts\r\ntransmitted to us are contradictory. Thus, we are by some told, as has\r\nbeen seen above, that the union of the bride and bridegroom took place\r\nsecretly, and remained for some time almost unknown. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are not wanting those who speak of public ceremonies which took\r\nplace on the occasion, as for example Sosibios,[1130] who informs us,\r\nthat the cake, called cribanos, shaped like the female breast, was\r\neaten at that repast which the Lacedæmonian women gave in honour of a\r\nbetrothed maiden when her youthful companions assembled in chorus to\r\nchaunt her praises. At Argos, another Doric state, it was customary\r\nbefore the bride joined her husband for her to send him, as a present,\r\nthe cake called creion, which his friends were invited to partake of\r\nwith honey. It was baked upon the coals as cakes are still in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1130:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiv. 54.\r\n\r\nWhen at Sparta the state had recognised the marriage, by permitting\r\ncohabitation, no man could call his wife his own. Any person might\r\nlegally claim the favour of borrowing her for a certain time, in\r\norder, if he did not choose to be burdened with a wife, to have a\r\nfamily by her while she remained in the house of her lord. An elderly\r\nman was sure to have his connubial privileges invaded in this way, and\r\nthe most able and philosophical advocates of Lycurgus’s institutions\r\ninform us that the Spartan ladies highly approved of all these\r\narrangements. Yet, famous and learned authors undertake to break a\r\nlance for the chastity of the Spartan dames, and maintain with\r\ninfinite complacency that adultery was unknown among them. The truth\r\nis that the Spartan laws recognised no such offence.[1131] It was\r\nlegal, common, of every day occurrence, though, from many\r\ncircumstances, it would appear, that such Lacedæmonians as travelled\r\ninto other parts of Greece, and learned in what light manners and\r\nmorals so lax were by them viewed, blushed for their country’s\r\ninstitutions, and, in defence of them, put in practice those arts of\r\ndelusion and hypocrisy which constituted so distinguished a part of\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1131:\r\n\r\n  Xenoph. de Rep. Laced. i. 7. 8. 9.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the stern virtue and patriotism of the Spartan\r\nwomen, and high praise has been bestowed on the callous indifference\r\nwhich they sometimes exhibited on learning the death of their\r\nsons;[1132] but English mothers, who have given birth to sons as brave\r\nas ever fought or bled for Sparta, will, I think, agree with me in\r\nrating very low their boasted stoicism, which, if properly analysed,\r\nmight prove to be nothing more than a coarse and unnatural apathy. The\r\nreader of the Greek Anthologia will here remember her who meeting her\r\nson a fugitive among the flying from a victorious enemy, inflicted on\r\nhim with her own hands the death he sought to shun. Had Nature, which\r\nis but the voice of God indistinctly heard, anything to do with virtue\r\nsuch as that? Supposing the youth to have been a coward, which the\r\nfact of his flying before the enemy by no means proves, was it for the\r\nhands that had nursed him to become his executioners? A mother,\r\ndeserving of the name, would no doubt have sorrowed not to find her\r\nboy numbered among the brave, but her maternal heart would not the\r\nless have yearned towards the unhappy youth; she would have fled with\r\nhim into obscurity, and uttered her mild reproaches and shed her tears\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1132:\r\n\r\n  Cic. Tusc. Quæst. i. 49.\r\n\r\nAs often happens, however, these female stoics who were so lavish of\r\nthe blood of their children, displayed no readiness to set them the\r\nexample of making light of death when the fortunes of war afforded\r\nthem an occasion of putting their heroic maxims in practice; for when\r\nthe Theban army[1133] burst forth from the depths of the Menelaion,\r\nand swept down the valley of the Eurotas like a torrent, wasting\r\neverything before them with fire and sword, the women of Sparta, who\r\nhad never before seen the smoke of an enemy’s camp, lost in a moment\r\ntheir presence of mind, and, instead of encouraging their sons and\r\nhusbands calmly to rely upon their valour, ran to and fro through the\r\nstreets, filling the air with their effeminate wailings, and\r\ndistracting and impeding the movements of their natural protectors.\r\nVery different from this was the conduct of the female citizens of\r\nArgos. For when Cleomenes and Demaratos, after having defeated the\r\nArgive army, approached the city in the expectation of being able to\r\ntake it by storm, the poetess Telesilla armed her countrywomen, who,\r\nhastening to the defence of the walls, repulsed the Lacedæmonian\r\nkings, and preserved the state. In commemoration of this event a\r\nfestival was annually celebrated, in which the ladies appeared in male\r\nattire while the men concealed their heads beneath the female\r\nveil.[1134]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1133:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. Polit. ii. 9. Xenoph. Hellen. vi. v. 27. It should be\r\n  remarked, however, that on a future occasion, when Sparta was\r\n  besieged by King Pyrrhus, the female disciples of Lycurgus behaved\r\n  with more fortitude and energy; for when it was debated in the\r\n  senate whether they should not convey their wives and children to\r\n  Crete, and then, deriving courage from despair, determine to conquer\r\n  or perish on the spot, Archidamia, daughter of the king, entered\r\n  their assembly sword in hand, opposed their resolution, saying, it\r\n  behoved the women of Sparta to live and die with their husbands. The\r\n  female population was, in consequence, suffered to remain; and by\r\n  digging with the men in the trenches, sharpening the arms, and\r\n  attending on the wounded, so strongly excited the courage of the\r\n  Spartans, that they at length succeeded in repulsing the Macedonians\r\n  from their city. Cf. Plut. Pyrrh. § 27.—Polyæn. Stratagem. vii. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1134:\r\n\r\n  Plut. de Mulier. Virtut. t. ii. p. 195. Polyæn. Stratagem. viii. 33.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the Thebans broke into Platæa during the night, the women,\r\ninstead of delivering themselves up pusillanimously to fear, joined\r\nthe men in defence of the city, casting stones and tiles from the\r\nhousetops upon the enemy. Yet when defeated and flying for their\r\nlives, it was one of these same women who, with the characteristic\r\nhumanity of her sex, supplied them with a hatchet to cut their way\r\nthrough the gates.[1135]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1135:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. ii. 4.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable instance of self-devotion furnished by women\r\nin the whole history of Greece was, perhaps, that which is related of\r\nthe Phocian ladies,[1136] who, when their countrymen, under the\r\ncommand of Diophantos, were about to engage with the Thessalians in a\r\nbattle which it was felt must finally determine the destiny of Phocis,\r\nstrenuously, with the concurrence of their children, exhorted him to\r\npersevere in the design he had formed, of causing them to be consumed\r\nby fire should the battle be lost. Examples of this terrible expedient\r\nfor preserving the honour of women occur but too frequently in the\r\nhistory of India, where it is termed performing _johur_; and the\r\nRomans, in their Spanish wars, witnessed a similar act of\r\nself-sacrifice at Numantia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1136:\r\n\r\n  Plut. de Mulier. Virtut. t. ii. p. 192.\r\n\r\nIt should, nevertheless, by no means be concealed that the annals of\r\nSparta also contain some brilliant examples of female heroism, of\r\nwhich the most striking, perhaps, is that furnished by the wife of\r\nPanteus and her companions after the death of Cleomenes at Alexandria.\r\n“When the report of his death,” says Plutarch,[1137] “had spread over\r\nthe city, Cratesiclea, though a woman of superior fortitude, sank\r\nunder the weight of the calamity; she embraced the children of\r\nCleomenes, and wept over them. The elder of them, disengaging himself\r\nfrom her arms, got unsuspected to the top of the house, and threw\r\nhimself down headlong. He was not killed, however, though much hurt;\r\nand when they took him up he loudly expressed his grief and\r\nindignation that they would not suffer him to destroy himself. Ptolemy\r\nwas no sooner informed of these things than he ordered the body of\r\nCleomenes to be flayed, and nailed to a cross, and his children to be\r\nput to death, together with his mother and the women her companions.\r\nAmong these was the wife of Panteus, a woman of great beauty and most\r\nmajestic presence. They had been but lately married, and their\r\nmisfortune overtook them amid the first transports of love. When her\r\nhusband went with Cleomenes from Sparta, she was desirous of\r\naccompanying him, but was prevented by her parents, who kept her in\r\nclose custody. Soon afterwards, however, she provided herself with a\r\nhorse and a little money, and making her escape by night, rode at full\r\nspeed to Tænaros, and there embarked on board a ship bound for Egypt.\r\nShe reached her husband safely, and readily and cheerfully shared with\r\nhim in all the inconveniences of a foreign residence. When the\r\nsoldiers came to take Cratesiclea to the scaffold, she led her by the\r\nhand, assisted in bearing her robe,[1138] and desired her to exert all\r\nher courage, though she was far from being afraid of death, and\r\ndesired no other favour than that she might die before her children.\r\nBut when they arrived at the place of execution the children suffered\r\nbefore her eyes; and then Cratesiclea was despatched, uttering in her\r\nextreme distress only these words: ‘Oh! my children! whither are you\r\ngone?’\r\n\r\n“The wife of Panteus, who was tall and strong, girt her robe about her\r\nand in a silent and composed manner paid the last offices to each\r\nwoman that lay dead, winding up the bodies as well as her present\r\ncircumstances would admit. Last of all she prepared herself for the\r\nponiard by letting down her robe about her and adjusting it in such a\r\nmanner as to need no assistance after death, then, calling the\r\nexecutioner to do his office, and permitting no other person to\r\napproach her, she fell like a heroine. In death she retained all the\r\ndecorum which she had preserved in life, and the decency which had\r\nbeen so sacred with this excellent woman still remained about her.\r\nThus in this bloody tragedy in which the women contended to the last\r\nfor the prize of courage with the men, Lacedæmon evinced that it is\r\nimpossible for fortune to conquer virtue.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1137:\r\n\r\n  Cleomen. § 38. I have here made use of the translation of Langhorne,\r\n  because it would be no easy matter to furnish a better.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1138:\r\n\r\n  Πέπλος.\r\n\r\nAnother brief narrative given by the same historian exhibits in the\r\nmost touching manner, the tenderness and self-devotion of a Spartan\r\nwoman. Cleombrotos, in conjunction with other conspirators, had\r\ndethroned king Leonidas his father-in-law and possessed himself of the\r\ncrown. Events afterwards restored the old man to his kingdom, upon\r\nwhich burning with resentment he hurried to take vengeance on his\r\nson-in-law. \"Chelonis, the daughter of Leonidas, had looked upon the\r\ninjury done to her father as done to herself, and when Cleombrotos\r\nrobbed him of the crown she left him in order to console her father in\r\nhis misfortune. As long as he remained in sanctuary she stayed with\r\nhim, and when he fled, sympathising with his sorrow, and full of\r\nresentment against Cleombrotos, she attended him in his flight. But\r\nwhen the fortunes of her father changed she changed too. She joined\r\nher husband as a suppliant, and was found sitting by him with great\r\nmarks of tenderness, and her two children one on each side at her\r\nfeet. The whole company were much struck at the sight, and could not\r\nrefrain from tears when they considered her goodness of heart and\r\nuncommon strength of affection.\r\n\r\n\"Chelonis, then, pointing to her mourning habit and her dishevelled\r\nhair thus addressed Leonidas. ‘It was not my dear father compassion\r\nfor Cleombrotos which put me in this habit and gave me this look of\r\nmisery. My sorrows took their date with your misfortune and your\r\nbanishment, and have ever since remained my familiar companions. Now\r\nyou have conquered your enemies and are again king of Sparta should I\r\nstill retain these ensigns of affliction or assume festival and royal\r\nornaments, while the husband of my youth whom you yourself bestowed\r\nupon me falls a victim to your vengeance? If his own submission, if\r\nthe tears of his wife and children cannot propitiate you he must\r\nsuffer a severer punishment for his offences than even you require, he\r\nmust see his beloved wife die before him. For how can I live and\r\nsupport the sight of my own sex, after both my husband and my father\r\nhave refused to hearken to my supplications, when it appears that both\r\nas a wife and a daughter I am born to be miserable with my family. If\r\nthis poor man had any plausible reasons for what he did I invalidated\r\nthem all by forsaking him to follow you. But you furnish him with a\r\nsufficient apology for his misbehaviour by showing that a crown is so\r\nbright and desirable an object that a son-in-law must be slain and a\r\ndaughter totally disregarded when it is in question.’\r\n\r\n“Chelonis, after this supplication, rested her cheek upon her\r\nhusband’s head, and with an eye dim and languid through sorrow looked\r\nround on the spectators; Leonidas consulted his friends upon the\r\npoint, and then commanded Cleombrotos to rise and go into exile, but\r\nhe desired Chelonis to stay and not to forsake so affectionate a\r\nfather who had kindly granted her husband’s life. Chelonis, however,\r\nwould not be persuaded. When her husband had risen from the ground she\r\nput one child into his arms and took the other herself, and after\r\nhaving paid due homage at the altar where they had taken sanctuary\r\nwent with him into banishment. So that had not Cleombrotos been\r\ncorrupted by the love of false glory he must have thought exile with\r\nsuch a woman a greater happiness than a kingdom without her.”[1139]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1139:\r\n\r\n  Plut. Agis §§ 17. 18. Moore in his Lalla Rookh has expressed the\r\n  same idea.\r\n\r\n                Fly to the desert, fly with me,\r\n                Our Arab tents are rude for thee;\r\n                But ah! the choice what heart can doubt,\r\n                Of tents with love or thrones without?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                  CONDITION OF UNMARRIED WOMEN.—LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of an Athenian lady it is far more important and, in\r\nproportion, more difficult to describe. Extremely erroneous\r\nimpressions appear to exist on the subject, several writers of\r\neminence having adopted the theory that they lived in total seclusion,\r\nand were little less ignorant and degraded than Oriental women are\r\ncommonly supposed to be. My own opinion is somewhat different. After\r\nvery patiently investigating the matter, the conclusions at which I\r\nhave arrived are as follow:—\r\n\r\nIn delineating a picture of this kind, positive testimonies are\r\nunquestionably required; but I appeal to the impartial reader, whether\r\nvery great, I had almost said the greatest weight, should not, after\r\nall, be attributed to that conviction which grows up, gradually and\r\nsilently, in the mind, during a long and habitual intercourse with the\r\nsubject. In this way, new authorities are formed, for to have examined\r\nminutely and attentively what others have written, to have weighed\r\nauthorities and scrupulously sifted their several pretensions, may be\r\nallowed to entitle a man, if anything can, to express an opinion of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nThe notion appears to prevail extensively, even among writers not\r\notherwise ill-informed, that women occupied, among the Ionians\r\ngenerally, and more especially among the Athenians, a very mean\r\nposition, were neglected and despised, and, consequently, exerted\r\nlittle or no influence on manners, morals, literature, or public\r\naffairs. With what design this error has been propagated it is not\r\ndifficult to comprehend. But to pervert history for party purposes is,\r\nafter all, an useless undertaking, since the facts always remain, and\r\nit is never too late to rescue truth from the fangs of sophistry.\r\n\r\nThat the women of Athens were in the condition for which nature\r\ndesigned them, I will not affirm; a little more converse with the\r\nworld might have improved their understandings, they might have been\r\nrendered more pleasing companions; but what they gained as social,\r\nthey would probably have lost as domestic beings. No woman was ever\r\nrendered better as a wife or as a mother by that indiscriminate\r\nenjoyment of society, which, it is supposed, the gentlewomen of Athens\r\nlost so much by being deprived of.\r\n\r\nTo form, however, a correct conception of their station, and the\r\nhappiness within their reach, we must take into consideration several\r\ncircumstances peculiar to ancient society. In those times something\r\nvery different was understood by the word education from the meaning\r\nnow attached to it. It signified rather the disciplining of the mind\r\nto certain habits than the imparting of different kinds of knowledge.\r\nIt was the culture of the intellectual powers, and the sowing of the\r\nseed, rather than the transplanting of notions, half-grown, from one\r\nmind to another. More care was bestowed on the building up, than on\r\nthe furnishing, of the mind. There was by far less acquisition, less\r\naccomplishment than in modern times; but the faculties were more\r\nsurely impregnated, quickened sooner, and ripened into more vigorous\r\nmaturity. Hence, among the ancients, there were few dreamers, either\r\nmen or women. Exquisitely alive to all the peculiarities of their\r\nsituation, they were, in the best sense of the word, a poetical\r\npeople, gifted, indeed, with imagination, but possessing, too, the\r\npower to rein it in, to shape its course, and, on most occasions, to\r\nrender it subservient to the dictates of judgment.\r\n\r\nOf the management of infancy I have already spoken. At the age of\r\nseven the sexes were separated, the girls still remaining in the\r\nnursery, while governors, kept expressly for the purpose, conducted\r\nthe boys to the public schools.[1140] Too little is known of the\r\nmaterial circumstances attending the mental and bodily training of the\r\ngirls, or at what age they were taught to read and write. Much,\r\nhowever, in those ages was communicated orally. Their mothers imparted\r\nto them whatever notions they possessed of religion, performed in\r\ntheir presence several sacrifices and other pious rites, and gradually\r\nprepared them for officiating in their turn at their country’s\r\naltars.[1141] In a certain sense, therefore, every Athenian woman was\r\na priestess, and though their piety was imperfect and their faith\r\ncorrupt, it will still be admitted that important benefits must have\r\nbeen derived from imbuing the youthful mind with some principles of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1140:\r\n\r\n  From a passage in Terence (Phorm. i. 2. 30. sqq.) Perizonius\r\n  concludes that even girls were sent to school. But he applies to\r\n  Athenian maidens of free birth what in the Roman poet is related of\r\n  a servile music girl: Ea serviebat lenoni impurissimo.—(Not. ad\r\n  Ælian. Hist. Var. iii. 21.) It appears, however, from this passage,\r\n  as Kuhn has already observed, that there existed public schools for\r\n  girls at Athens, whatever might be the condition of the persons who\r\n  frequented them. In Lambert Bos’s Antiquitates, (Pars. iv. c. 5. p.\r\n  216,) the error of Perizonius is repeated; that is, in the note;\r\n  for, according to the text, the Attic virgins were closely confined\r\n  to the house.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1141:\r\n\r\n  Πολλὰς ἑορτὰς αἱ γυναῖκες ἔξω τῶν δημοτελῶν ἦγον ἰδία\r\n  συνερχόμεναι.—Sch. Aristoph. Lysist. i. In Homer we find the Trojan\r\n  women performing sacrifice to Athena—Il. ζ. 277. 310, just as the\r\n  Athenian matrons did on the Acropolis.—Aristoph. Lysistr. 179.\r\n\r\nThe performance of these pious duties commenced very early.\r\nImmediately on attaining the age of five years, they might be called\r\non to officiate, clothed in saffron robes,[1142] in the rites of\r\nArtemis Brauronia, when a she-goat was sacrificed to the goddess,\r\nwhile professed rhapsodists chaunted select passages from the Iliad.\r\nHere they were initiated in the mysteries of their national\r\npiety,[1143] accompanied by all the charms of music, and of a style\r\nof declaiming no less impressive than that of the theatre. At this\r\nfestival, celebrated every five years, all the ceremonies were\r\nperformed by virgins, none of whom could be above ten years\r\nold;[1144] we must, therefore, infer that they underwent much\r\nprevious training, and were instructed carefully respecting the\r\nobject of the rites. Another religious festival at which youthful\r\nvirgins only officiated, was the Arrhephoria, celebrated in honour\r\nof Athena or Herse. The ceremonies performed on this occasion appear\r\nto have required something more of preparation, since it was\r\nnecessary that the youthful sacrificers should, at least, be seven\r\nyears old and not exceed eleven. Four, selected for their noble\r\nbirth and training, presided, and other two were chosen to weave the\r\nsacred peplos, while engaged in which they resided in the\r\nSphæresterion, on the rock of the Acropolis, habited in white\r\ngarments with ornaments of gold.[1145] The bread which they eat\r\nduring their seclusion was called Anastatos.[1146]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1142:\r\n\r\n  Suid. v. ἄρκτος. t. i. p. 425. c.—Sch.

Had they mingled much in society, more\r\noccasions would have occurred of dwelling on their acquirements, and\r\nin dramatic compositions of representing them delivering opinions, and\r\nexhibiting tastes and preferences, obviously incompatible with an\r\nuncultivated intellect. But, though the difficulty of the investigator\r\nbe augmented by the paucity and indistinct manner of the witnesses, we\r\nare still not left entirely without ground for coming to a decision,\r\nand if writers have, hitherto, so far as I know, overlooked some of\r\nthe principal testimonies, that must be regarded only as an additional\r\ncause for bringing them forward now.[1148]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1147:\r\n\r\n  Muretus has brought forward several passages to prove that learned\r\n  women bore but an indifferent character in antiquity.—Var. Lect.\r\n  viii. 21. The Hetairæ of course were taught to read. Of this we have\r\n  abundant proof: τὰ ἐπὶ τῶν τοίχων γεγγραμμένα ἐν τῷ κεραμεικῷ\r\n  ἀναγνοθὶ, ὅπου κατεστηλίτευται ὑμῶν τὰ ὀνομάτα—says the jealous\r\n  lover to Melitta in Lucian.—Diall. Hetair. iv. 2. Nay even the\r\n  servant maid of this Hetaira Acis is able to read; for desirous to\r\n  ascertain whether there was any thing in the report of her lover,\r\n  Melitta sends forth the girl to examine the walls, who discovers and\r\n  reads the words “Melitta loves Hermotimos,” &c. which written there\r\n  in jest by some wag had proved the cause of her lover’s jealousy and\r\n  the quarrel that ensued.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1148:\r\n\r\n  Cf.

Gaisf.\r\n\r\nA report current in antiquity, and preserved by Marcellinus in his\r\nLife of Thucydides,[1149] represents the daughter of that great\r\nhistorian as the continuator of her father’s work, and as, in fact,\r\nthe author of the whole eighth book. The biographer does not, indeed,\r\nreceive the legend, but in rejecting it his assigned reasons are not\r\nthat in the days of Thucydides Athenian ladies were not taught to\r\nread, and were, therefore, incapable of any species of literary\r\nexertion, but that the portion in question of the history bears\r\nevident marks of the same lofty and masculine mind to which we owe the\r\nrest, and no-wise resembles the productions of a woman. Had\r\nMarcellinus known the art of writing to have formed no part of an\r\nAthenian lady’s education, that could have been the proper reason to\r\nassign for his doubt. He might, under such circumstances, have\r\nridiculed the folly of such a supposition. But no such objection\r\noccurred to him. He knew well that they could and did write, and had,\r\ntherefore, recourse to the proper argument for establishing his point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1149:\r\n\r\n  P. xxi. For Plato’s views on the education of women, see De Legg. t.\r\n  viii. p. 36.—Cf. Xen. Conviv. ii. 9, 10.\r\n\r\nAgain, in that fragment of the oration of Lysias which he wrote for\r\nthe children of Diodotos, an Athenian woman of rank is introduced\r\ndefending, under very distressful circumstances, the rights of her\r\nchildren against her own father. Diodotos, it seems, had married his\r\nniece, and by her had several children. He was at length required by\r\nthe commonwealth to proceed on a military expedition, during which he\r\nfell under the walls of Ephesos. Diogeiton, father of his wife, having\r\nbeen appointed guardian of the children, endeavours to defraud them of\r\ntheir property, and their mother, calling in the aid of impartial\r\narbiters, pleads before them her children’s cause, and the orator,\r\naddressing one of the tribunals of Athens, does not hesitate to put in\r\nher mouth language worthy of a rhetorician. This, however, I am aware,\r\ncannot be regarded as a proof. But, in the course of her speech she\r\ndiscloses a circumstance which must be so considered. During the\r\nperiod of her stay in her fathers house, the old man removed from one\r\nstreet to another, and in the confusion a small memorandum book,\r\ndropped from among his papers, was picked up by one of the children\r\nand brought to their mother.[1150] It happened to contain the account\r\nof the money her husband had left on departing for the army; this she\r\nreads,[1151] and thus discovers the state in which the affairs of the\r\nfamily had been left on the departure of her husband.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1150:\r\n\r\n  Lys.

Spud. § 8.\r\n\r\nAnother proof that writing formed one of the accomplishments of women\r\noccurs in Xenophon. Ischomachos is laying open the road to domestic\r\nhappiness and wealth. He enters, as elsewhere will be shown, into a\r\nvariety of interesting details, and among other things, discusses the\r\ncharacter and duties of a housekeeper; for in Greece the principal\r\ncare of the household was always committed to women. Thus, going back\r\nto the Heroic ages, we find Euryclea the housekeeper of\r\nOdysseus,[1152] and Hector’s palace in Troy is also placed under the\r\ncare of a woman.[1153] In the Cretan states, moreover, even the public\r\ntables had female inspectors,[1154] and at Athens, where domestic\r\neconomy was so much better understood than in the rest of Greece,\r\nwomen necessarily obtained the government of the household,[1155]\r\nwhich men would have certainly managed more imperfectly. But in\r\nwell-regulated families, the supreme control of everything rested with\r\nthe wife, whom Xenophon[1156] represents engaging with her husband in\r\ntaking a list of all the moveables in the house, and this afterwards\r\nremains in her hands as a check upon the housekeeper, which, had she\r\nnot known how to read, it would not have been. Besides, she is spoken\r\nof as aiding in writing the catalogue, and displays throughout the\r\ndialogue so much ability and knowledge that it would not surprise us\r\nto find her discoursing with Socrates on household affairs. There is,\r\nmoreover, a remark of Plato[1157] subversive at the same time of\r\nanother error on this same subject, which exhibits women exercising\r\ntheir judgment in literary matters. Children, he says, may find comedy\r\nmore agreeable, but educated women, youths, and the majority indeed of\r\nmankind, will prefer tragedy. Here we find the opinion corroborated\r\nthat both the comic and tragic theatres were open to them, otherwise\r\nit could not have been known which they would prefer. But of this more\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1152:\r\n\r\n  Odyss. α. 428. β. 345, 361.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1153:\r\n\r\n  Iliad. ζ. 381. 390.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1154:\r\n\r\n  Athen. iv. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1155:\r\n\r\n  In the household of Pericles, however, we find mention made of a\r\n  steward, and learn that the regulation of affairs was taken out of\r\n  the hands of the women.—Plut.

Similar business habits prevailed\r\n  among our neighbours, the Dutch, while they enjoyed the advantages\r\n  of republican institutions. Among the causes of their prosperity Sir\r\n  Josiah Child enumerates, “the education of their children, as well\r\n  daughters as sons, all which, be they of never so great quality or\r\n  estate, they always take care to bring up to write perfect good\r\n  hands, and to have the full knowledge and use of arithmetic and\r\n  merchants’ accounts, the well understanding and practice whereof,\r\n  doth strangely infuse into most that are the owners of that quality,\r\n  of either sex, not only an ability for commerce of all kinds, but a\r\n  strong aptitude, love and delight in it; and in regard the women are\r\n  as knowing therein as the men, it doth encourage their husbands to\r\n  hold on in their trades to their dying days. Knowing the capacity of\r\n  their wives to get in their estates and carry on their trades after\r\n  their deaths; whereas if a merchant in England arrive at any\r\n  considerable estate, he commonly withdraws his estate from trade,\r\n  before he comes near the confines of old age, reckoning that if God\r\n  should call him out of the world while the main of his estate is\r\n  engaged abroad in trade, he must lose one third of it, through the\r\n  inexperience and inaptness of his wife to such affairs, and so it\r\n  usually falls out.”—Discourse of Trade, p. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1157:\r\n\r\n  De Legg. l. ii. t. vii. p. 243. Bekk.—Ἐὰν δέ γ᾿ οἱ μείζους παῖδες,\r\n  τὸν τὰς κωμῳδίας· τραγωδίαν δὲ αἵ τε πεπαιδευμέναι τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ\r\n  τὰ νέα μειράκια καὶ σχεδὸν ἴσως τὸ πλῆθος πάντων.\r\n\r\nIn all countries, a great part of a woman’s education takes place\r\nafter marriage. But at Athens, where they entered so early[1158] into\r\nthe connubial state, marriage itself must be reckoned among the\r\nprincipal causes of their mental developement. They came into the\r\nhands of their husbands unformed, but pliable and docile. The little\r\nthey had been taught seemed rather designed to fit them to receive his\r\ninstructions than to dispense with them.[1159] Their seclusion from\r\nthe world preserved their character unfixed and impressionable. They\r\npassed from the nursery, as it were, to the bridal chamber, timid,\r\nunworldly, unsophisticated, and the husband, if he desired it, might\r\nfashion their mind and opinions as he pleased. In the women of Athens\r\nwe, accordingly, observe the most remarkable contrast to the Spartans.\r\nTheir influence, in effect greater, perhaps, acted invisibly, warming\r\nand impelling the ruder masculine clay, but without humbling their\r\nlords or exposing them to the ridicule of living under petticoat\r\ngovernment. Yet in Themistocles we have an example of the sway they\r\nexercised. Fondling one day his infant son he observed, sportively,\r\nbut with that ambitious consciousness of power ever present to the\r\nmind of a Greek—\"This little fellow is the most influential person I\r\nknow.\" His friends inquired his meaning—\"Why, replied Themistocles, he\r\ncompletely governs his mother, while she governs me, and I the whole\r\nof Greece.\"[1160]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1158:\r\n\r\n  The Roman ladies entered still earlier into the married state; at\r\n  the age of twelve, says Plutarch, or under.

Themist. § 18.\r\n\r\nThe steps by which an Athenian girl might arrive at so envied a\r\nposition are not unworthy our attention. From the age of fifteen she\r\nmight look to become the mistress of a family; and it is probable that\r\nthe maxim of Cleobulos,[1161] that women should approach their\r\nnuptials young in years but old in understanding, often governed their\r\nconduct. Love no doubt was not the only matchmaker at Athens.[1162] In\r\ngeneral the heart, as in modern times, followed in the train of\r\nprudential calculation. But this arose, not so much from any\r\nimpracticability[1163] of obtaining interviews, as from the habitual\r\npreference for gold, which, in all ages, has been found to actuate the\r\nconduct of the majority. To this day, in every country in Europe,\r\nmarriage in the upper classes is too frequently a matter of mere\r\nbargain and sale, in which the feelings remain altogether unconsulted.\r\nAnd it was the same at Athens, though to suppose with Müller that\r\ninterest was always the sole motive would be palpably to embrace an\r\nerror, alike uncountenanced by history and philosophy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1161:\r\n\r\n  Diog.

Heautontimor. v. 5. sub. fin.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that virgins in all Ionic states led an extremely\r\nsecluded life, we are not thence to conclude that no opportunity of\r\nbeholding, or even conversing with them, was enjoyed by men.[1164] It\r\nhas already been seen that from the age of five years various\r\nceremonies of their ancestral religion[1165] led females into the\r\nstreet, that they walked leisurely, arrayed with every resource of art\r\nand magnificence, in frequent processions to the temples, and it is\r\nknown that numerous private occasions, such as funerals, marriages,\r\n&c., exposed them to the indiscriminate gaze of the public. Thus, we\r\nhave in Terence a youth who from beholding a young lady with face\r\nuncovered and dishevelled hair lamenting at her mother’s funeral,\r\nfalls desperately in love;[1166] and the wife in Lysias, whose frailty\r\nled to the murder of Eratosthenes,[1167] was first seen and admired\r\nunder similar circumstances. Excuses, in fact, were never wanting to\r\nbe in public, and occasions unknown to us were clearly afforded men\r\nfor becoming acquainted with the temper and character of their future\r\nspouses, since we find Socrates conversing with men well acquainted\r\nwith their country’s manners, jocularly feigning to have chosen\r\nXantippe for her fierce, untameable spirit.[1168]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1164:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xiii. 29.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1165:\r\n\r\n  The religious rites in which the women of Athens officiated were\r\n  numerous and important: 1.

De Cæd. Eratosth. § 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1168:\r\n\r\n  Diog. Laert. ii. 5. 18.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by many distinguished scholars, that, at\r\nAthens,[1169] the theatre—that great bazaar of female beauty in modern\r\nstates—was closed against the women, at least the comic theatre. One\r\nprincipal ground of this opinion is the coarse and licentious\r\ncharacter of the old comedy which, with its broad humour, political\r\nsatire, and reckless disregard of decency, appears fitted for men\r\nonly, and those not the most refined. But there are strange\r\ncontradictions in human nature. The very religion of Greece teemed\r\nwith indecency. Phallic statues crowded the temples and the public\r\nstreets. Phallic emblems entered into many of the sacred ceremonies at\r\nwhich women, even in their maiden condition, assisted, and the poems\r\nchaunted at sacrifices, where they associated in every rite, were, in\r\nmany parts, broader than an Utopian legislator would consider\r\npermissible. Besides, to prove the nullity of this objection, we need\r\nonly note the history of our own stage. English women refused not,\r\nwhen they were in fashion, to behold, under the protection of a\r\nmask,[1170] the comedies of Massinger, Wycherly, Beaumont and\r\nFletcher. They still read, and, on the stage, admire, Shakespeare, and\r\nfrom these the interval is not wide to Aristophanes, the lewdest and\r\nmost shameless of ancient comic writers.[1171] And, further, it should\r\nnever be forgotten, that their perverted religion flung its protecting\r\nwing over the stage. Plays exhibited during the festivals of Bacchos\r\nwere, like our old mysteries and moralities, strictly sacred shows,\r\nand, consistently, women could no more have been excluded from them\r\nthan from the other exhibitions connected with public worship.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1169:\r\n\r\n  To prove the presence of the women at the theatre among the other\r\n  Greeks, ample testimonies might be collected. Thus, when in Æolis, a\r\n  certain Alexander exhibited dramatic performances, the people\r\n  flocked thither from all the neighbouring towns and villages, upon\r\n  which he surrounded the theatre with soldiers, made prisoners both\r\n  men, women, and children, and only released them on payment of a\r\n  large ransom.—Polyæn. Stratagem. vi. 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1170:\r\n\r\n  To this Pope alludes:\r\n\r\n                 “And not a mask went unimproved away.”\r\n\r\n  See also Swift, Tale of a Tub, § ix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1171:\r\n\r\n  On the coarseness of the German theatre, in the eighteenth century,\r\n  frequented by the empress and the first ladies of the court, see\r\n  Lady Montague’s Letters, ix.\r\n\r\nAs on many other points, however, the positive and direct testimonies\r\nto be adduced in proof of the position I maintain are scanty, and of\r\nmodern authorities nearly all are against me. Still, truth is not\r\nimmediately to be deserted because there happens to be much difficulty\r\nin defending it. It will be time enough to run when we have exhausted\r\nall our resources. An unknown writer, but still a Greek,[1172] relates\r\nthat, during the acting of the Eumenides, that awe-inspiring and\r\nterrible drama of Æschylus, the sight of the furies rushing\r\ntumultuously, like dogs of hell, upon the stage, with their frightful\r\nmasks and blood-dripping hands, shed so deep a terror over the\r\ntheatre, that children were thrown into fits, and pregnant women\r\nseized with premature birth-pangs. This, if admitted, would be\r\nevidence decisive as regards the tragic stage. But, because it is\r\nimpossible to elude its force, modern critics boldly assume the\r\nprivilege to treat the whole passage contemptuously, opposing scorn\r\nwhen they have no counterproof to oppose. Such a mode of arguing,\r\nhowever, by whomsoever pursued, must clearly bear upon the face of it\r\nthe mark of sophistry, for in that way there is no position which\r\nmight not be overthrown or established.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1172:\r\n\r\n  Τινες δὲ φάσιν, ἐν τῇ ἐπιδείξει τῶν Εὐμενίδων σποράδην εἰσαγαγόντα\r\n  τὸν χορὸν, τοσοῦτον ἐκπλῆξαι τὸν δῆμον, ὥστε τὰ μὲν νήπια ἐκψύξαι,\r\n  τὰ δὲ ἔμβρυα ἐξαμβλωθῆναι.—Vit. Æschyl. p. 6.\r\n\r\nBut our anonymous authority has not been left to encounter the attacks\r\nof the critics and historians alone. Other ancient authors, though\r\ntheir corroborative testimonies have, hitherto, been generally\r\noverlooked, furnish incidental hints and revelations which, duly\r\nweighed, will, I make no doubt, be admitted to amount to positive\r\nproof. Describing the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, Strabo observes,\r\nthat so vast were its dimensions, that during the celebration of the\r\nmysteries, it would contain the whole multitude usually assembled at\r\nthe theatre.[1173] Now, in the mysteries, we know that the Athenians\r\nof both sexes, and of all ages above childhood, were present, so that,\r\nif men only had been admitted to the theatre, it need not have been\r\nhalf the size of the Eleusinian temple, and, consequently, would have\r\nfurnished the geographer with no proper subject of comparison. Again,\r\nin the passage quoted above, from Plato, the presence of women at both\r\nthe tragic and comic theatres is indubitably presumed, since, to judge\r\nof both these kinds of exhibitions, it was necessary either to see\r\nthem, or to read the plays. If they read the plays there could be no\r\nreason for restraining them from the theatre, since, whatever they\r\ncontained of objectionable matter would thus be equally placed within\r\ntheir reach. It is to be presumed, therefore, even from this passage,\r\nthat the theatre was free to women.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1173:\r\n\r\n  Ὄχλον θέατρου δέξασθαι δυνάμενον.—Strab. ix. i. p. 238.—We have in\r\n  Pollux, ii. 56. and iv. 121., θεάτρια “a spectatress,” and\r\n  συνθεάτρια “a fellow spectatress,” a word used by Aristophanes, and,\r\n  doubtless, applied to women forming part of a theatrical audience.\r\n\r\nBut the philosopher is elsewhere more explicit. Treating in his\r\nDialogue on Laws expressly of tragic poetry, and speaking always in\r\nreference to his imaginary state, he respectfully and with many\r\nflattering compliments proscribes this branch of the mimetic arts,\r\nnot, however, without assigning his reasons. Assuming for the moment\r\nthe part of leader of the legislative chorus, he informs the\r\ntragedians, that “we, also, in our way, are poets, and aim at\r\nproducing a perfect representation of human life. You must regard us,\r\ntherefore, as your rivals, and believe that we labour at the\r\ncomposition of a drama, which it is within the competence of perfect\r\nlaw only to achieve. You must not, accordingly imagine, that, as\r\njealous rivals, we shall readily admit you into our city to pitch your\r\ntents in our agora, and, through the voice of loud-mouthed, actors to\r\nimbue our wives and children and countrymen with manners the very\r\nopposite to ours.”[1174] Now, what point, or, indeed, what sense would\r\nthere be in this, if in the commonwealths actually existing dramatic\r\npoets had always been prohibited from addressing themselves to the\r\nwomen? Would it not have been just such another novelty as an\r\ningenious philosopher of our days would hit upon, were he in a state\r\nof his own invention, to propose, as a great improvement on existing\r\ncustoms, that women should go to church?\r\n\r\nFootnote 1174:\r\n\r\n  Plat. de Legg. vii. t. viii. p. 59.

It is well known that the\r\ntheatre was, among the ancients, parcelled out into several divisions,\r\nsome more, some less honourable; and of these one whole division, by\r\nthe decree of Sphyromachos, was appropriated to the female citizens,\r\nwho would appear previously to have sat indiscriminately among the men\r\nand female strangers. To the latter the upper ranges of seats would\r\nappear to have been appropriated.[1175] On this point, therefore, the\r\nopinion received among the generality of writers is erroneous. Women\r\nwere not debarred the amusement or instruction of the theatre,[1176]\r\nwhich, for good or for evil, influenced their education, and rendered\r\ntheir minds subservient or otherwise to the designs of the legislator\r\nand the welfare of the state.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1175:\r\n\r\n  Aristoph. Eccles. 22. et Schol.\r\n\r\n             Ἐνταῦθα περὶ τὴν ἐσχάτην δεῖ κερκίδα\r\n             Ὑμᾶς καθιζούσας βεωρεῖν ὡς ξένας.\r\n                                  Alexis, ap. Poll. ix. 44.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1176:\r\n\r\n  An anecdote related by Plutarch, would of itself, in my opinion,\r\n  suffice to prove the presence of women at the theatre, as well as\r\n  that Athenian ladies habitually went abroad attended by a single\r\n  maid-servant. For on one occasion, when an actor who played the part\r\n  of a queen would have refused to appear upon the stage unless\r\n  furnished with a splendid costume and a large suite of attendants,\r\n  Melanthios, the manager, pushed him on the boards, saying, “Don’t\r\n  you see the wife of Phocion constantly going abroad attended by but\r\n  one maid? And wouldst thou affect superior pomp and corrupt our\r\n  wives?” It is evident that the pride of this actor could not have\r\n  exercised any evil influence on the women had they not been present\r\n  to witness his ostentation. We must necessarily infer, therefore,\r\n  that they were, and that they joined the theatre in the thunders of\r\n  applause with which it received the observation of Melanthios, who\r\n  had spoken so loud as to be heard by the whole audience.—Plut. Phoc.\r\n  § 19. The passage of Alexis had not escaped Casaubon, who, in his\r\n  notes on Theophrastus’ Characters, p. 165, has discussed the point\r\n  with his usual learning and ability. A passage in the\r\n  Thesmophoriazusæ of Aristophanes, seems however, but only seems, to\r\n  make against this opinion. There a woman says that when men returned\r\n  from seeing a play of Euripides, a “Woman-hater,” they used to\r\n  search the house in quest of lovers; but when Euripides’ plays were\r\n  acted they might be supposed to remain at home from pique.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it will be apparent that the sexes enjoyed at Athens\r\nabundant occasions of meeting; and in the other Ionian states similar\r\ncustoms and similar manners prevailed. For this we are reduced to rely\r\non no obscure scholiast or grammarian. Thucydides himself, describing\r\nthe second purification of Delos by the Athenians, and the institution\r\nof the Delian games, observes, that from very remote times the people\r\nof Ionia and the neighbouring islands had been accustomed to come with\r\ntheir wives and children to the sacred festivals there celebrated in\r\nhonour of Apollo. On these occasions gymnastic exercises and musical\r\ncontests took place; and of the chorusses who chaunted the praises of\r\nthe god some were female. The whole of the ceremonies are described in\r\nthe Homeric hymns to the tutelar divinity, where the poet very\r\nanimatedly recapitulates the principal features of the games.\r\n\r\n        To thee, O Phœbos! most the Delian isle\r\n        Gives cordial joy, excites the pleasing smile,\r\n        When gay Ionians flock around thy fane,\r\n        Men, women, children,—a resplendent train:\r\n        Where flowing garments sweep the sacred pile,—\r\n        Where youthful concourse gladdens all the isle,—\r\n        Where champions fight,—where dancers beat the ground,—\r\n        Where cheerful music echoes all around,\r\n        Thy feast to honour, and thy praise to sound.[1177]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1177:\r\n\r\n  Thucyd. iii. 104. The version is Dr. Smith’s. Cf. Hom. Hymn. in\r\n  Apoll. 146. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1178:\r\n\r\n  I have, as the reader will perceive, adopted the verse proposed by\r\n  Barnes:—\r\n\r\n              Δηλιάδες δὲ τε κοῦραι Ἀπόλλωνος θεράπαιναι.\r\n\r\n  Though Ernesti is perhaps right in supposing no addition necessary.\r\n  See his note on v. 165. Franke, in his recent edition of the Hymns,\r\n  has, with Ernesti, rejected the verse.\r\n\r\nThe great historian who quotes this hymn, and unhesitatingly\r\nattributes it to Homer, brings forward to prove the occurrence of\r\nmusical contests another passage, in which, as he observes, the poet\r\nspeaks of himself:—\r\n\r\n        But now, Apollo, with thy sister fair,\r\n        Smile as the lingering bard prefers his prayer;\r\n        And ye, O Delian nymphs,[1178] who guard the fane\r\n        Of Phœbos, listen to my parting strain;\r\n        Should some lone stranger, when my lay no more\r\n        Floats on the breezes of the sacred shore,\r\n        Demand who best, with soul-entrancing song,\r\n        Earned blithe your praise, and bore your hearts along?\r\n        Then answer with a warm approving smile—\r\n        “The blind old man of Chios’ rocky isle.”[1179]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1179:\r\n\r\n  Of these verses (Hymn. in Apol. v. 165. 172) I give my own\r\n  translation, the last line excepted, which Byron had somewhere done\r\n  ready to my hand.\r\n\r\nAnd down to the period of the Peloponnesian war similar games and\r\nsacred rites were performed at Ephesos, at which the Ionians with\r\ntheir wives and children were usually present.\r\n\r\nThe Doric historian, to whom all these circumstances must be\r\nfamiliarly known, makes, however, no account of them, but consistently\r\nwith his theory, if not with facts, remembers no well-authenticated\r\ninstance in the annals of Attica of a person’s marrying for love. What\r\nhe would admit to be well authenticated it were difficult to say. He\r\nrejects, whenever his particular notions seem to require it, the\r\ntestimonies both of Herodotus and Thucydides, so that for a narrative\r\nresting on the authority of Polyænus, Plutarch, and Valerius Maximus,\r\nwe can expect no quarter. Nevertheless, as these writers are at least\r\nfaithful in their delineations of manners, the following romantic\r\nincident may be hazarded even on their authority. Thrasymedes, an\r\nAthenian youth, entertaining a strong passion for the daughter of the\r\ntyrant Peisistratos, had the hardihood one day as she walked in a\r\nreligious procession to kiss her openly in the street. Her brothers,\r\nyoung men of a fiery temper, regarded the act as an affront almost\r\ninexpiable, and were apparently preparing to take vengeance on the\r\noffender, when the old prince allayed their anger by observing,—\"If we\r\npunish men for loving us, how shall we conduct ourselves towards our\r\nenemies?\" Escaping thus, Thrasymedes still cherished his love. He\r\ntherefore determined on carrying away the lady by force; and gaining\r\nover a number of his associates, he seized the occasion of a sacrifice\r\non the sea-shore in which the maiden was officiating, and rushing,\r\nattended by his followers with drawn swords, through the crowd, he\r\nsucceeded in conveying her to a boat, and set sail for Ægina.\r\nUnfortunately, however, for his design, Hippias, eldest son of\r\nPeisistratos, happened at this moment to be cruising in the bay on the\r\nlookout for pirates, and perceiving a bark putting hastily out to sea,\r\nhe bore down upon it, took the young men prisoners, and conducted them\r\ntogether with his sister back to Athens. Thrasymedes and his\r\ncompanions being brought before the tyrant, abated not a jot of their\r\ncourage, but bade him, in determining their punishment, use his own\r\ndiscretion, since from the moment they resolved on the enterprise they\r\nhad made light, they said, of life. Peisistratos, tyrant though he\r\nwas, regarded their loftiness of soul with admiration, freely bestowed\r\nhis daughter on Thrasymedes, and won them to his interest by\r\ngentleness and friendship. In this, says Polyænus, acting the part of\r\na good father and a popular citizen rather than of a tyrant.[1180]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1180:\r\n\r\n  Polyæn. Strat. v. 14. Meurs. Peisist. vi. p. 46. seq. Plutarch. in\r\n  Apophthegm. Peisist. § 3. who calls the young man Thrasybulos.\r\n  Valer. Max. v. 1.\r\n\r\nBut supposing no instances remained on record, who can doubt that the\r\nheart prompted, and the hand followed its promptings, at Athens as\r\nelsewhere? Its walls, its columns, every plane-tree in the Academy,\r\nthe Cerameicos, and other public walks, glowed with the language of\r\nthe passions, and the names of virgins beloved for their beauty. There\r\nwas, no doubt, some want of delicacy in this; but the manners of the\r\nAthenians, though they presented no insuperable bar to so much of\r\nintercourse as might serve to enkindle affection,[1181] opposed,\r\nnevertheless, that facility of communication which at Sparta existed,\r\nand in our own country is common. However, had the beloved been\r\nincapable of reading, to what purpose should her name, coupled with\r\nendearing epithets, have illuminated the bark of the smilax, or the\r\nmarble skreens of the gymnasia? It was traced there in order that her\r\nbright eyes might peruse it, and learn who of all the youth of Athens,\r\nhad singled her forth from the world to be the object of his love.\r\nLucian, in his sarcastic humour, represents a mad lover of the goddess\r\nAphrodite carving every tree and end of wall with her name.[1182] From\r\na fragment of Callimachos it would seem too as if men had sometimes\r\nwritten the beloved syllables on the leaves of trees;[1183] which may\r\nwell have been, since in our own days we have seen the English people\r\ninscribing in letters of gold the name of their youthful queen on\r\nleaves of laurel. Euripides, who lost no opportunity of venting his\r\naversion for the sex, introduces one of his characters protesting that\r\nhis opinion of women would not be bettered though every pine in Mount\r\nIda were covered with their names.[1184]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1181:\r\n\r\n  Schol. in Aristoph. Acharn. 144. Vesp. 98. Young men in love would\r\n  appear to have played at dice, with fortune, to discover whether\r\n  they should be successful or otherwise. Luc. Amor. § 16. Speaking of\r\n  Ameipsias’ Sphendone, or Jewelled Ring, Hemsterhuis observes:—“Nomen\r\n  habere potuerit hæc comedia ab annulo mutui amoris signo, atque\r\n  arrha, cujus in palâ fuerit insculpta, quod haud apud antiquos\r\n  insolens, amoris figura, quæque vario ut modo per aliorum manus\r\n  vagata.” ad Poll. ix. 96. t. vi. p. 1123.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1182:\r\n\r\n  Amor. § 16. Τοῖχος ἄπας ἐχαράσσετο, καὶ πᾶς μαλακοῦ δένδρου φλοιὸς\r\n  Ἀφροδίτην καλὴν ἐκήρυσσεν.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1183:\r\n\r\n  Callim. Frag. xxv. p. 241. Spanh.—Theoc. Epithal.

Potter, Archæol. ii. 244.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of declaring love, not quite unknown in modern times, was\r\nto clothe the language of the heart in verse. Poets, we are told,\r\noften disguised their own feelings by attributing them to the actors\r\nin a feigned narrative, which they would compose as an offering to the\r\nobject of their attachment who, it is very obvious, to appreciate such\r\na gift, must have been able to read it.[1185] They had likewise\r\nanother fashion, particularly Greek, of making known their sentiments,\r\nwhich was to suspend garlands of flowers, or perform sacrifice before\r\nthe door where the person possessing their heart resided.[1186]\r\nSometimes they repaired to the spot and poured forth libations of wine\r\nas at the entrance of a temple, a practice alluded to by the Scholiast\r\non Aristophanes, who relates that a number of Thessalian gentlemen\r\nbeing in love with Laïs,[1187] betrayed their passion by publicly\r\nsprinkling her doors with wine. Among the symptoms which disclosed the\r\ncondition of the feelings, a garland loosely thrown upon the head was\r\none.[1188] Women suffered their secret to escape them by being\r\ndiscovered wreathing garlands for their hair.[1189]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1185:\r\n\r\n  Philostrat. Epist. xx. p. 921. Hermann. Com. in Arist. Poet. p. 87.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1186:\r\n\r\n  Athen. xv. 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1187:\r\n\r\n  Cf. Naïs according to Harpocrat. in v. p. 203. Sch. Aristoph.

Thesmoph. 400.\r\n\r\nBut in whatever way the existence of passion was externally\r\nmanifested, a more interesting question is the modification which the\r\npassion[1190] itself underwent in the Greek mind.[1191] Numerous\r\ncircumstances concur to mislead our judgment on this subject. In the\r\nfirst place, the writers who sprang up like fungi amid the corruption\r\nand profligacy which attended the decay of Hellenic society, standing\r\nnearer to us, obstruct our view. Among them a coarse unhealthy craving\r\nafter excitement led to nefarious perversions of sentiment, and to\r\ncountenance their own excesses they threw back their vile polluting\r\nshadows upon the loftier and brighter moral station of their\r\nforefathers. Even so early as the age of Æschylus this culpable\r\npractice began to prevail, for this great poet scrupled not to\r\nattribute to Achilles vices, which, in the Homeric period, were\r\nevidently unknown.[1192]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1190:\r\n\r\n  Σὲ δέσποινα τῶν ὑπὲρ σοῦ λόγων, Ἀφροδίτη, σὲ βοηθὸν αἱ ἐμαὶ δεήσεις\r\n  καλοῦσιν. Luc. Amor. § 19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1191:\r\n\r\n  See the whole question treated with peculiar ability by Maximus\r\n  Tyrius viii. 105. sqq. Homer, in the opinion of this writer,\r\n  exhibits especial felicity in his description of love, from the\r\n  cool, timid dawn of passion to its fervid noon, pourtraying its\r\n  operations, the age at which it is experienced, its forms, its\r\n  feelings, chaste or unchaste. See too Lycophron Cassand. 104. with\r\n  the commentary of Meursius, p. 1184. 1186. sqq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1192:\r\n\r\n  The friendship of Achilles for Patroclos is celebrated by Maximus\r\n  Tyrius, viii. 106. Cf. Luc. Amor. 20.\r\n\r\nBut rightly to comprehend the spirit of an age, we must by no means\r\nconfide in the interpretation of the succeeding, or even in any one\r\nclass of contemporary writers. Least of all, in the authors of comedy,\r\nwho seldom paint men as they are, but run into exaggeration and\r\ncaricature for the sake of effect. To the imaginative, spiritual,\r\nimpassioned must we have recourse, if we would learn what the\r\nimpassioned, spiritual and imaginative felt, and to such only in any\r\nage or country, is love, in the poetical sense of the word, familiar\r\nor indeed intelligible.\r\n\r\nIn the apprehension of several modern writers, love among the Greeks,\r\nwas not merely based upon physical elements, as it must everywhere be,\r\nbut included little or nothing else.[1193] It had there, they suppose,\r\nnone of these romantic features, nothing of that heroic self-devotion\r\nor lofty intercommunion of soul with soul, which among northern\r\nnations, more particularly in fiction, characterises this powerful and\r\nmysterious principle, which binds together in indissoluble union\r\nindividuals of different sexes, and renders throughout life the\r\ncontentment and happiness of the one, dependent on the well-being of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1193:\r\n\r\n  Maximus Tyrius has, on the origin of love, a very beautiful passage.\r\n  “Its well-spring is the beauty of the soul gleaming upward through\r\n  the body. And as flowers seen under water appear still more\r\n  brilliant and exquisite than they are, so mental excellence seems to\r\n  manifest additional splendour when invested with corporeal\r\n  loveliness.” ix. 113. Euripides, whatever he may have written in his\r\n  old age, was once an enthusiastic panegyrist of love, of which he\r\n  has left a brilliant description. Athen. xiii. 11. In the gymnasia\r\n  the statue of Eros was placed beside those of Hermes and\r\n  Hercules—eloquence and strength. Love festivals Ἐρωτίδια were\r\n  celebrated by the Thespians. Athen. xiii. 12. Before entering battle\r\n  the Cretans and Spartans sacrificed to Eros, Id. xiii. 12. Alexis\r\n  imitates Plato in describing this passion. Eros had two bows, the\r\n  one of the graces producing happiness, the other engendering\r\n  violence and wrong. Id. xiii. 14. On the power of love see § 74.\r\n  Cleisophos of Selymbria fell in love at Samos with a statue of\r\n  Parian marble. § 84.\r\n\r\nBut I can discover in the Greeks nothing which, on this point, can\r\ndistinguish them from other civilised races, except, perhaps, that\r\nthere was in their love, more of earnestness and reality and less of\r\ndreaminess and fantastic affectation, than might be brought home to\r\nseveral modern nations. Their fables, however, and their poetry teem\r\nwith ideas and examples of the loftiest and purest love, such love,\r\nI mean, as is natural to mankind, as harmonises with the structure\r\nof their minds, and the object and tendency of their passions,\r\ngrowing like the oak out of earth, but springing upward and rearing\r\nits majestic stature and beautiful foliage towards heaven. Thus\r\nOdysseus in Homer prefers the sunshine of a wife’s affection to\r\nimmortality[1194] and the smiles of a sensual goddess. Hæmon with a\r\ntenderness carried to excess, spurns the blandishment of empire,\r\nnay, the very laws of duty and nature, that he may cling to the form\r\nof Antigone[1195] and join her in the grave. And Alcestis, rising\r\nabove them all, quits in youth and health and beauty\r\n\r\n              “The warm precincts of the cheerful day,”\r\n\r\nthat she may preserve the existence of one beloved still more than\r\nlife.[1196]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1194:\r\n\r\n  Καὶ τὴν Πηνελόπην ἄλλως Ὀδυσσεὺς ὁρᾷ, ἄλλως ὁ Εὐρύμαχος.—Max. Tyr.\r\n  ix. 115.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1195:\r\n\r\n  Soph. Antig. 635. sqq.—Καὶ ἐν εὐτυχίαις συνευτύχει καὶ ἀποθανόντι\r\n  συναποθνήσκει, Max. Tyr. ix. 116. We discover the same idea in our\r\n  own marriage ceremony, where husband and wife are said to be joined\r\n  together, “for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness\r\n  and in health.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1196:\r\n\r\n  Even Lucian could discover that there was something holy in love.\r\n  Κοινὸν οὖν ἀμφοτέρῳ γένει πόθον ἐγκερασαμένη, συνέζευξεν ἄλληλοις\r\n  θεσμὸν ἀνάγκης ὅσιον. Amor. § 19.\r\n\r\nNay, to prove the elevated conceptions of love that prevailed in\r\nearlier Greece, we find a personification of this passion reckoned\r\namong the most ancient gods of its mythology. Altars were erected,\r\nfestivals instituted, sacrifices offered up to it, as to a power, in\r\nits origin and nature divine.[1197] It breathed the breath of life\r\ninto their poetry, it was supposed to elicit music and verse from the\r\ncoldest human clay, like the sun’s rays from the fabulous Memnon—it\r\nallied itself in its energies with freedom—to love, in the imagination\r\nof a Greek, was to cease to be a slave,[1198]—it emancipated and\r\nrendered noble whomsoever it inspired,—it floated winged through the\r\nair, and descended even in dreams[1199] upon the mind of men or women,\r\nrevealing to sight the forms of persons unknown, annihilating\r\ndistance, trampling over rank, confounding together gods and men by\r\nits irresistible force.[1200] Much of the beauty of their fables is\r\nconcealed from us by the atmosphere of triteness and familiarity with\r\nwhich our injudicious education invests them. Every puling sonneteer\r\nbabbles of Eros. And Aphrodite, a creature of the imagination brighter\r\nand lovelier than her own star, has been rendered more common in\r\nmodern verse, than the most celebrated of her priestesses in ancient\r\nCorinth. But the poets of Greece possessed the art of clothing their\r\ngods in colours warm as life, varied as the rainbow; and as to Love,\r\nnever was his influence more delicately shadowed forth than by him who\r\nintroduces Endymion slumbering with unclosed lids on Mount Latmos,\r\nthat the divinity of sleep might enjoy the brightness of his\r\neyes![1201]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1197:\r\n\r\n  See too in Stobæus, the addresses of a bereaved husband to\r\n  philosophy—ὦ φιλοσοφία, τυραννίκά σου τὰ επιτάγματα· λεγεις φίλει·\r\n  κᾄν ἀποβάλῃ τις, λέγεις, μὴ λύπου. 34.
