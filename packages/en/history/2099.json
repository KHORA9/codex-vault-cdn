Libbey,\r\nM.A., Principal of the Moravian Theological College, Fairfield, for the\r\nloan of valuable books; to the Rev. J. T.

THE BOHEMIAN BRETHREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I -- THE RISING STORM.\r\n\r\nWhen an ordinary Englishman, in the course of his reading, sees mention\r\nmade of Moravians, he thinks forthwith of a foreign land, a foreign\r\npeople and a foreign Church. He wonders who these Moravians may be,\r\nand wonders, as a rule, in vain. We have all heard of the Protestant\r\nReformation; we know its principles and admire its heroes; and the\r\nfamous names of Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Latimer, Cranmer, Knox and\r\nother great men are familiar in our ears as household words. But few\r\npeople in this country are aware of the fact that long before Luther had\r\nburned the Pope's bull, and long before Cranmer died at the stake, there\r\nhad begun an earlier Reformation, and flourished a Reforming Church. It\r\nis to tell the story of that Church--the Church of the Brethren--that\r\nthis little book is written.\r\n\r\nFor her cradle and her earliest home we turn to the distressful land\r\nof Bohemia, and the people called Bohemians, or Czechs. To us English\r\nreaders Bohemia has many charms. As we call to mind our days at school,\r\nwe remember, in a dim and hazy way, how famous Bohemians in days of yore\r\nhave played some part in our national story. We have sung the praises at\r\nChristmas time of the Bohemian Monarch, \"Good King Wenceslaus.\" We have\r\nread how John, the blind King of Bohemia, fell mortally wounded at the\r\nBattle of Crecy, how he died in the tent of King Edward III., and how\r\nhis generous conqueror exclaimed: \"The crown of chivalry has fallen\r\ntoday; never was the like of this King of Bohemia.\" We have all read,\r\ntoo, how Richard II. married Princess Anne of Bohemia; how the Princess,\r\nso the story goes, brought a Bohemian Bible to England; how Bohemian\r\nscholars, a few years later, came to study at Oxford; how there they\r\nread the writings of Wycliffe, the \"Morning Star of the Reformation\";\r\nand how, finally, copies of Wycliffe's books were carried to Bohemia,\r\nand there gave rise to a religious revival of world-wide importance.\r\nWe have struck the trail of our journey. For one person that Wycliffe\r\nstirred in England, he stirred hundreds in Bohemia. In England his\r\ninfluence was fleeting; in Bohemia it was deep and abiding. In England\r\nhis followers were speedily suppressed by law; in Bohemia they became\r\na great national force, and prepared the way for the foundation of the\r\nChurch of the Brethren.\r\n\r\nFor this startling fact there was a very powerful reason. In many ways\r\nthe history of Bohemia is very like the history of Ireland, and the best\r\nway to understand the character of the people is to think of our Irish\r\nfriends as we know them to-day. They sprang from the old Slavonic stock,\r\nand the Slavonic is very like the Keltic in nature. They had fiery\r\nSlavonic blood in their veins, and Slavonic hearts beat high with hope\r\nin their bosoms. They had all the delightful Slavonic zeal, the Slavonic\r\ndash, the Slavonic imagination. They were easy to stir, they were swift\r\nin action, they were witty in speech, they were mystic and poetic in\r\nsoul, and, like the Irish of the present day, they revelled in the joy\r\nof party politics, and discussed religious questions with the keenest\r\nzest. With them religion came first and foremost. All their poetry was\r\nreligious; all their legends were religious; and thus the message of\r\nWycliffe fell on hearts prepared to give it a kindly welcome.\r\n\r\nAgain, Bohemia, like Ireland, was the home of two rival populations. The\r\none was the native Czech, the other was the intruding German; and the\r\ntwo had not yet learned to love each other. From all sides except one\r\nthese German invaders had come. If the reader will consult a map of\r\nEurope he will see that, except on the south-east frontier, where the\r\nsister country, Moravia, lies, Bohemia is surrounded by German-speaking\r\nStates. On the north-east is Silesia, on the north-west Saxony, on the\r\nwest Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate, and thus Bohemia was flooded\r\nwith Germans from three sides at once. For years these Germans had\r\nbeen increasing in power, and the whole early history of Bohemia is\r\none dreary succession of bloody wars against German Emperors and Kings.\r\nSometimes the land had been ravaged by German soldiers, sometimes a\r\nGerman King had sat on the Bohemian throne. But now the German settlers\r\nin Bohemia had become more powerful than ever. They had settled in large\r\nnumbers in the city of Prague, and had there obtained special privileges\r\nfor themselves. They had introduced hundreds of German clergymen, who\r\npreached in the German language. They had married their daughters into\r\nnoble Bohemian families. They had tried to make German the language of\r\nthe court, had spoken with contempt of the Bohemian language, and had\r\nsaid that it was only fit for slaves. They had introduced German laws\r\ninto many a town, and German customs into family life; and, worse than\r\nall, they had overwhelming power in that pride of the country, the\r\nUniversity of Prague. For these Germans the hatred of the people was\r\nintense. \"It is better,\" said one of their popular writers, \"for the\r\nland to be a desert than to be held by Germans; it is better to marry a\r\nBohemian peasant girl than to marry a German queen.\" And Judas Iscariot\r\nhimself, said a popular poet, was in all probability a German.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in Ireland, these national feuds were mixed up with religious\r\ndifferences. The seeds of future strife were early sown. Christianity\r\ncame from two opposite sources. On the one hand, two preachers, Cyril\r\nand Methodius, had come from the Greek Church in Constantinople, had\r\nreceived the blessing of the Pope, and had preached to the people in the\r\nBohemian language; on the other, the German Archbishop of Salzburg had\r\nbrought in hosts of German priests, and had tried in vain to persuade\r\nthe Pope to condemn the two preachers as heretics. And the people loved\r\nthe Bohemian preachers, and hated the German priests. The old feud was\r\nraging still. If the preacher spoke in German, he was hated; if he spoke\r\nin Bohemian, he was beloved; and Gregory VII. had made matters worse by\r\nforbidding preaching in the language of the people.\r\n\r\nThe result can be imagined. It is admitted now by all\r\nhistorians--Catholic and Protestant alike--that about the time when our\r\nstory opens the Church in Bohemia had lost her hold upon the affections\r\nof the people. It is admitted that sermons the people could understand\r\nwere rare. It is admitted that the Bible was known to few, that the\r\nservices held in the parish churches had become mere senseless shows,\r\nand that most of the clergy never preached at all. No longer were\r\nthe clergy examples to their flocks. They hunted, they gambled, they\r\ncaroused, they committed adultery, and the suggestion was actually\r\nsolemnly made that they should be provided with concubines.\r\n\r\nFor some years a number of pious teachers had made gallant but vain\r\nattempts to cleanse the stables. The first was Conrad of Waldhausen,\r\nan Augustinian Friar (1364-9). As this man was a German and spoke in\r\nGerman, it is not likely that he had much effect on the common people,\r\nbut he created quite a sensation in Prague, denounced alike the vices of\r\nthe clergy and the idle habits of the rich, persuaded the ladies of high\r\ndegree to give up their fine dresses and jewels, and even caused certain\r\nwell-known sinners to come and do penance in public.\r\n\r\nThe next was Milic of Kremsir (1363-74). He was a Bohemian, and\r\npreached in the Bohemian language. His whole life was one of noble\r\nself-sacrifice. For the sake of the poor he renounced his position as\r\nCanon, and devoted himself entirely to good works. He rescued thousands\r\nof fallen women, and built them a number of homes. He was so disgusted\r\nwith the evils of his days that he thought the end of the world was\r\nclose at hand, declared that the Emperor, Charles IV., was Anti-Christ,\r\nwent to Rome to expound his views to the Pope, and posted up a notice on\r\nthe door of St. Peter's, declaring that Anti-Christ had come.\r\n\r\nThe next was that beautiful writer, Thomas of Stitny (1370-1401). He\r\nexalted the Holy Scriptures as the standard of faith, wrote several\r\nbeautiful devotional books, and denounced the immorality of the monks.\r\n\"They have fallen away from love,\" he said; \"they have not the peace of\r\nGod in their hearts; they quarrel, condemn and fight each other; they\r\nhave forsaken God for money.\"\r\n\r\nIn some ways these three Reformers were all alike. They were all men\r\nof lofty character; they all attacked the vices of the clergy and the\r\nluxury of the rich; and they were all loyal to the Church of Rome, and\r\nlooked to the Pope to carry out the needed reform.\r\n\r\nBut the next Reformer, Matthew of Janow, carried the movement further\r\n(1381-93). The cause was the famous schism in the Papacy. For the long\r\nperiod of nearly forty years (1378-1415) the whole Catholic world was\r\nshocked by the scandal of two, and sometimes three, rival Popes, who\r\nspent their time abusing and fighting each other. As long as this schism\r\nlasted it was hard for men to look up to the Pope as a true spiritual\r\nguide. How could men call the Pope the Head of the Church when no one\r\nknew which was the true Pope? How could men respect the Popes when\r\nsome of the Popes were men of bad moral character? Pope Urban VI. was\r\na ferocious brute, who had five of his enemies secretly murdered; Pope\r\nClement VII., his clever rival, was a scheming politician; and Pope John\r\nXXIII. was a man whose character will scarcely bear describing in print.\r\nOf all the scandals in the Catholic Church, this disgraceful quarrel\r\nbetween rival Popes did most to upset the minds of good men and to\r\nprepare the way for the Reformation. It aroused the scorn of John\r\nWycliffe in England, and of Matthew of Janow in Bohemia. \"This schism,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"has not arisen because the priests loved Jesus Christ and His\r\nChurch, but rather because they loved themselves and the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut Matthew went even further than this. As he did not attack any\r\nCatholic dogma--except the worship of pictures and images--it has been\r\ncontended by some writers that he was not so very radical in his views\r\nafter all; but the whole tone of his writings shows that he had lost\r\nhis confidence in the Catholic Church, and desired to revive the simple\r\nChristianity of Christ and the Apostles. \"I consider it essential,\" he\r\nwrote, \"to root out all weeds, to restore the word of God on earth,\r\nto bring back the Church of Christ to its original, healthy, condensed\r\ncondition, and to keep only such regulations as date from the time of\r\nthe Apostles.\" \"All the works of men,\" he added, \"their ceremonies and\r\ntraditions, shall soon be totally destroyed; the Lord Jesus shall alone\r\nbe exalted, and His Word shall stand for ever.\" Back to Christ! Back to\r\nthe Apostles! Such was the message of Matthew of Janow.\r\n\r\nAt this point, when the minds of men were stirred, the writings of\r\nWycliffe were brought to Bohemia, and added fuel to the fire. He had\r\nasserted that the Pope was capable of committing a sin. He had\r\ndeclared that the Pope was not to be obeyed unless his commands were\r\nin accordance with Scripture, and thus had placed the authority of the\r\nBible above the authority of the Pope. He had attacked the Doctrine of\r\nTransubstantiation, and had thus denied the power of the priests \"to\r\nmake the Body of Christ.\" Above all, in his volume, \"De Ecclesia,\" he\r\nhad denounced the whole Catholic sacerdotal system, and had laid down\r\nthe Protestant doctrine that men could come into contact with God\r\nwithout the aid of priests. Thus step by step the way was prepared for\r\nthe coming revolution in Bohemia. There was strong patriotic national\r\nfeeling; there was hatred of the German priests; there was a growing\r\nlove for the Bible; there was lack of respect for the immoral clergy,\r\nand lack of belief in the Popes; there was a vague desire to return to\r\nPrimitive Christianity; and all that was needed now was a man to gather\r\nthese straggling beams together, and focus them all in one white burning\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. -- THE BURNING OF HUS.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, July 6th, 1415, there was great excitement in the city of\r\nConstance. For the last half-year the city had presented a brilliant and\r\ngorgeous scene. The great Catholic Council of Constance had met at last.\r\nFrom all parts of the Western World distinguished men had come. The\r\nstreets were a blaze of colour. The Cardinals rode by in their scarlet\r\nhats; the monks in their cowls were telling their beads; the revellers\r\nsipped their wine and sang; and the rumbling carts from the country-side\r\nbore bottles of wine, cheeses, butter, honey, venison, cakes and fine\r\nconfections. King Sigismund was there in all his pride, his flaxen hair\r\nfalling in curls about his shoulders; there were a thousand Bishops,\r\nover two thousand Doctors and Masters, about two thousand Counts, Barons\r\nand Knights, vast hosts of Dukes, Princes and Ambassadors--in all over\r\n50,000 strangers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after months of hot debate, the Council met in the great\r\nCathedral to settle once for all the question, What to do with John Hus?\r\nKing Sigismund sat on the throne, Princes flanking him on either side.\r\nIn the middle of the Cathedral floor was a scaffold; on the scaffold a\r\ntable and a block of wood; on the block of wood some priestly robes. The\r\nMass was said. John Hus was led in. He mounted the scaffold. He breathed\r\na prayer. The awful proceedings began.\r\n\r\nBut why was John Hus there? What had he done to offend both Pope\r\nand Emperor? For the last twelve years John Hus had been the boldest\r\nreformer, the finest preacher, the most fiery patriot, the most powerful\r\nwriter, and the most popular hero in Bohemia. At first he was nothing\r\nmore than a child of his times. He was born on July 6th, 1369, in a\r\nhumble cottage at Husinec, in South Bohemia; earned coppers in his\r\nyouth, like Luther, by chanting hymns; studied at Prague University; and\r\nentered the ministry, not because he wanted to do good, but because\r\nhe wanted to enjoy a comfortable living. He began, of course, as an\r\northodox Catholic. He was Rector first of Prague University, and then\r\nof the Bethlehem Chapel, which had been built by John of Milheim for\r\nservices in the Bohemian language. For some years he confined himself\r\nalmost entirely, like Milic and Stitny before him, to preaching of an\r\nalmost purely moral character. He attacked the sins and vices of all\r\nclasses; he spoke in the Bohemian language, and the Bethlehem Chapel was\r\npacked. He began by attacking the vices of the idle rich. A noble lady\r\ncomplained to the King. The King told the Archbishop of Prague that he\r\nmust warn Hus to be more cautious in his language.\r\n\r\n\"No, your Majesty,\" replied the Archbishop, \"Hus is bound by his\r\nordination oath to speak the truth without respect of persons.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Hus went on to attack the vices of the clergy. The Archbishop now\r\ncomplained to the King. He admitted that the clergy were in need of\r\nimprovement, but he thought that Hus's language was rash, and would do\r\nmore harm than good. \"Nay,\" said the King, \"that will not do. Hus is\r\nbound by his ordination oath to speak the truth without respect of\r\npersons.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Hus continued his attacks. His preaching had two results. It fanned\r\nthe people's desire for reform, and it taught them to despise the clergy\r\nmore than ever.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, when opportunity offered, John Hus made a practice of\r\npreaching on the burning topics of the day; and the most popular topic\r\nthen was the detested power of Germans in Bohemia. German soldiers\r\nravaged the land; German nobles held offices of state; and German\r\nscholars, in Prague University, had three-fourths of the voting power.\r\nThe Bohemian people were furious. John Hus fanned the flame. \"We\r\nBohemians,\" he declared in a fiery sermon, \"are more wretched than dogs\r\nor snakes. A dog defends the couch on which he lies. If another dog\r\ntries to drive him off, he fights him. A snake does the same. But us the\r\nGermans oppress. They seize the offices of state, and we are dumb. In\r\nFrance the French are foremost. In Germany the Germans are foremost.\r\nWhat use would a Bohemian bishop or priest, who did not know the German\r\nlanguage, be in Germany? He would be as useful as a dumb dog, who cannot\r\nbark, to a flock of sheep. Of exactly the same use are German priests\r\nto us. It is against the law of God! I pronounce it illegal.\" At last a\r\nregulation was made by King Wenceslaus that the Bohemians should be more\r\nfairly represented at Prague University. They had now three votes out\r\nof four. John Hus was credited by the people with bringing about the\r\nchange. He became more popular than ever.\r\n\r\nIf Hus had only halted here, it is probable that he would have been\r\nallowed to die in peace in his bed in a good old age, and his name would\r\nbe found enrolled to-day in the long list of Catholic saints. However\r\nwicked the clergy may have been, they could hardly call a man a heretic\r\nfor telling them plainly about the blots in their lives. But Hus soon\r\nstepped outside these narrow bounds. The more closely he studied the\r\nworks of Wycliffe, the more convinced he became that, on the whole,\r\nthe great English Reformer was right; and before long, in the boldest\r\npossible way, he began to preach Wycliffe's doctrines in his sermons,\r\nand to publish them in his books. He knew precisely what he was doing.\r\nHe knew that Wycliffe's doctrines had been condemned by the English\r\nChurch Council at Black-Friars. He knew that these very same doctrines\r\nhad been condemned at a meeting of the Prague University Masters. He\r\nknew that no fewer than two hundred volumes of Wycliffe's works had been\r\npublicly burned at Prague, in the courtyard of the Archbishop's Palace.\r\nHe knew, in a word, that Wycliffe was regarded as a heretic; and yet he\r\ndeliberately defended Wycliffe's teaching. It is this that justifies us\r\nin calling him a Protestant, and this that caused the Catholics to call\r\nhim a heretic.\r\n\r\nJohn Hus, moreover, knew what the end would be. If he stood to his guns\r\nthey would burn him, and burned he longed to be. The Archbishop forbade\r\nhim to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel. John Hus, defiant, went on\r\npreaching. At one service he actually read to the people a letter he had\r\nreceived from Richard Wyche, one of Wycliffe's followers. As the years\r\nrolled on he became more \"heterodox\" than ever. At this period there\r\nwere still two rival Popes, and the great question arose in Bohemia\r\nwhich Pope the clergy there were to recognise. John Hus refused to\r\nrecognise either. At last one of the rival Popes, the immoral John\r\nXXIII., sent a number of preachers to Prague on a very remarkable\r\nerrand. He wanted money to raise an army to go to war with the King of\r\nNaples; the King of Naples had supported the other Pope, Gregory XII.,\r\nand now Pope John sent his preachers to Prague to sell indulgences at\r\npopular prices. They entered the city preceded by drummers, and posted\r\nthemselves in the market place. They had a curious message to deliver.\r\nIf the good people, said they, would buy these indulgences, they would\r\nbe doing two good things: they would obtain the full forgiveness of\r\ntheir sins, and support the one lawful Pope in his holy campaign. John\r\nHus was hot with anger. What vulgar traffic in holy things was this? He\r\nbelieved neither in Pope John nor in his indulgences.\r\n\r\n\"Let who will,\" he thundered, \"proclaim the contrary; let the Pope, or a\r\nBishop, or a Priest say, 'I forgive thee thy sins; I free thee from the\r\npains of Hell.' It is all vain, and helps thee nothing. God alone, I\r\nrepeat, can forgive sins through Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement in Prague was furious. From this moment onwards Hus\r\nbecame the leader of a national religious movement. The preachers went\r\non selling indulgences {1409.}. At one and the same time, in three\r\ndifferent churches, three young artisans sang out: \"Priest, thou liest!\r\nThe indulgences are a fraud.\" For this crime the three young men were\r\nbeheaded in a corner near Green Street. Fond women--sentimental, as\r\nusual--dipped their handkerchiefs in the blood of the martyrs, and a\r\nnoble lady spread fine linen over their corpses. The University students\r\npicked up the gauntlet. They seized the bodies of the three young men,\r\nand carried them to be buried in the Bethlehem Chapel. At the head of\r\nthe procession was Hus himself, and Hus conducted the funeral. The whole\r\ncity was in an uproar.\r\n\r\nAs the life of Hus was now in danger, and his presence in the city\r\nmight lead to riots, he retired for a while from Prague to the castle of\r\nKradonec, in the country; and there, besides preaching to vast crowds\r\nin the fields, he wrote the two books which did the most to bring him to\r\nthe stake. The first was his treatise \"On Traffic in Holy Things\";\r\nthe second his great, elaborate work, \"The Church.\"[1] In the first he\r\ndenounced the sale of indulgences, and declared that even the Pope\r\nhimself could be guilty of the sin of simony. In the second, following\r\nWycliffe's lead, he criticised the whole orthodox conception of the day\r\nof the \"Holy Catholic Church.\" What was, asked Hus, the true Church of\r\nChrist? According to the popular ideas of the day, the true Church of\r\nChrist was a visible body of men on this earth. Its head was the Pope;\r\nits officers were the cardinals, the bishops, the priests, and other\r\necclesiastics; and its members were those who had been baptized and\r\nwho kept true to the orthodox faith. The idea of Hus was different. His\r\nconception of the nature of the true Church was very similar to that\r\nheld by many Non-conformists of to-day. He was a great believer in\r\npredestination. All men, he said, from Adam onwards, were divided into\r\ntwo classes: first, those predestined by God to eternal bliss; second,\r\nthose fore-doomed to eternal damnation. The true Church of Christ\r\nconsisted of those predestined to eternal bliss, and no one but God\r\nHimself knew to which class any man belonged. From this position a\r\nremarkable consequence followed. For anything the Pope knew to the\r\ncontrary, he might belong himself to the number of the damned. He could\r\nnot, therefore, be the true Head of the Church; he could not be the\r\nVicar of Christ; and the only Head of the Church was Christ Himself. The\r\nsame argument applied to Cardinals, Bishops and Priests. For anything he\r\nknew to the contrary, any Cardinal, Bishop or Priest in the Church\r\nmight belong to the number of the damned; he might be a servant, not\r\nof Christ, but of Anti-Christ; and, therefore, said Hus, it was utterly\r\nabsurd to look to men of such doubtful character as infallible spiritual\r\nguides. What right, asked Hus, had the Pope to claim the \"power of\r\nthe keys?\" What right had the Pope to say who might be admitted to\r\nthe Church? He had no right, as Pope, at all. Some of the Popes were\r\nheretics; some of the clergy were villains, foredoomed to torment in\r\nHell; and, therefore, all in search of the truth must turn, not to the\r\nPope and the clergy, but to the Bible and the law of Christ. God alone\r\nhad the power of the keys; God alone must be obeyed; and the Holy\r\nCatholic Church consisted, not of the Pope, the Cardinals, the Priests,\r\nand so many baptized members, but \"of all those that had been chosen\r\nby God.\" It is hard to imagine a doctrine more Protestant than this.\r\nIt struck at the root of the whole Papal conception. It undermined the\r\nauthority of the Catholic Church, and no one could say to what, ere\r\nlong, it might lead. It was time, said many, to take decisive action.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary, persuaded\r\nPope John XXIII. to summon a general Church Council at Constance; and at\r\nthe same time he invited Hus to attend the Council in person, and there\r\nexpound his views. John Hus set out for Constance. As soon as he arrived\r\nin the city, he received from Sigismund that famous letter of \"safe\r\nconduct\" on which whole volumes have been written. The King's promise\r\nwas as clear as day. He promised Hus, in the plainest terms, three\r\nthings: first, that he should come unharmed to the city; second, that he\r\nshould have a free hearing; and third, that if he did not submit to\r\nthe decision of the Council he should be allowed to go home. Of those\r\npromises only the first was ever fulfilled. John Hus soon found himself\r\ncaught in a trap. He was imprisoned by order of the Pope. He was placed\r\nin a dungeon on an island in the Rhine, and lay next to a sewer; and\r\nSigismund either would not or could not lift a finger to help him. For\r\nthree and a-half mouths he lay in his dungeon; and then he was removed\r\nto the draughty tower of a castle on Lake Geneva. His opinions were\r\nexamined and condemned by the Council; and at last, when he was called\r\nto appear in person, he found that he had been condemned as a heretic\r\nalready. As soon as he opened his month to speak he was interrupted; and\r\nwhen he closed it they roared, \"He has admitted his guilt.\" He had\r\none chance of life, and one chance only. He must recant his heretical\r\nWycliffite opinions, especially those set forth in his treatise on the\r\n\"Church.\" What need, said the Council, could there be of any further\r\ntrial? The man was a heretic. His own books convicted him, and justice\r\nmust be done.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on the last day of the trial, John Hus stood before the great\r\nCouncil. The scene was appalling. For some weeks this gallant son of the\r\nmorning had been tormented by neuralgia. The marks of suffering were on\r\nhis brow. His face was pale; his cheeks were sunken; his limbs were weak\r\nand trembling. But his eye flashed with a holy fire, and his words rang\r\nclear and true. Around him gleamed the purple and gold and the scarlet\r\nrobes. Before him sat King Sigismund on the throne. The two men looked\r\neach other in the face. As the articles were rapidly read out against\r\nhim, John Hus endeavoured to speak in his own defence. He was told to\r\nhold his tongue. Let him answer the charges all at once at the close.\r\n\r\n\"How can I do that,\" said Hus, \"when I cannot even bear them all in\r\nmind?\"\r\n\r\nHe made another attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said Cardinal Zabarella; \"we have already given you\r\na sufficient hearing.\"\r\n\r\nWith clasped hands, and in ringing tones, Hus begged in vain for a\r\nhearing. Again he was told to hold his peace, and silently he raised\r\nhis eyes to heaven in prayer. He was accused of denying the Catholic\r\ndoctrine of transubstantiation. He sprang to his feet in anger.\r\nZabarella tried to shout him down. The voice of Hus rang out above the\r\nbabel.\r\n\r\n\"I have never held, taught or preached,\" he cried, \"that in the\r\nsacrament of the altar material bread remains after consecration.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial was short and sharp. The verdict had been given beforehand.\r\nHe was now accused of another horrible crime. He had actually described\r\nhimself as the fourth person in the Godhead! The charge was monstrous.\r\n\r\n\"Let that doctor be named,\" said Hus, \"who has given this evidence\r\nagainst me.\"\r\n\r\nBut the name of his false accuser was never given. He was now accused\r\nof a still more dangerous error. He had appealed to God instead of\r\nappealing to the Church.\r\n\r\n\"O Lord God,\" he exclaimed, \"this Council now condemns Thy action and\r\nlaw as an error! I affirm that there is no safer appeal than that to the\r\nLord Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nWith those brave words he signed his own death warrant. For all his\r\northodoxy on certain points, he made it clearer now than ever that\r\nhe set the authority of his own conscience above the authority of the\r\nCouncil; and, therefore, according to the standard of the day, he had to\r\nbe treated as a heretic.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" he said, with his eye on the King, \"I came here freely to\r\nthis Council, with a safe-conduct from my Lord the King here present,\r\nwith the desire to prove my innocence and to explain my beliefs.\"\r\n\r\nAt those words, said the story in later years, King Sigismund blushed.\r\nIf he did, the blush is the most famous in the annals of history; if he\r\ndid not, some think he ought to have done. For Hus the last ordeal had\r\nnow arrived; and the Bishop of Concordia, in solemn tones, read out the\r\ndreadful articles of condemnation. For heretics the Church had then but\r\nlittle mercy. His books were all to be burned; his priestly office must\r\nbe taken from him; and he himself, expelled from the Church, must be\r\nhanded over to the civil power. In vain, with a last appeal for justice,\r\nhe protested that he had never been obstinate in error. In vain he\r\ncontended that his proud accusers had not even taken the trouble to read\r\nsome of his books. As the sentence against himself was read, and the\r\nvision of death rose up before him, he fell once more on his knees and\r\nprayed, not for himself, but for his enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"pardon all my enemies, I pray thee, for\r\nthe sake of Thy great mercy! Thou knowest that they have falsely accused\r\nme, brought forward false witnesses and false articles against me. O!\r\npardon them for Thine infinite mercies' sake.\"\r\n\r\nAt this beautiful prayer the priests and bishops jeered. He was ordered\r\nnow to mount the scaffold, to put on the priestly garments, and to\r\nrecant his heretical opinions. The first two commands he obeyed; the\r\nthird he treated with scorn. As he drew the alb over his shoulders, he\r\nappealed once more to Christ.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"was mocked in a white robe, when led\r\nfrom Herod to Pilate.\"\r\n\r\nThere on the scaffold he stood, with his long white robe upon him and\r\nthe Communion Cup in his hand; and there, in immortal burning words, he\r\nrefused to recant a single word that he had written.\r\n\r\n\"Behold,\" he cried, \"these Bishops demand that I recant and abjure. I\r\ndare not do it. If I did, I should be false to God, and sin against my\r\nconscience and Divine truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishops were furious. They swarmed around him. They snatched the Cup\r\nfrom his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Thou cursed Judas!\" they roared. \"Thou hast forsaken the council of\r\npeace. Thou hast become one of the Jews. We take from thee this Cup of\r\nSalvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I trust,\" replied Hus, \"in God Almighty, and shall drink this Cup\r\nthis day in His Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of degradation now took place. As soon as his robes had\r\nbeen taken from him, the Bishops began a hot discussion about the proper\r\nway of cutting his hair. Some clamoured for a razor, others were all for\r\nscissors.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said Hus to the King, \"these Bishops cannot agree in their\r\nblasphemy.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the scissors won the victory. His tonsure was cut in four\r\ndirections, and a fool's cap, a yard high, with a picture of devils\r\ntearing his soul, was placed upon that hero's head.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said the Bishops, \"we deliver your soul to the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most joyfully,\" said Hus, \"will I wear this crown of shame for thy\r\nsake, O Jesus! who for me didst wear a crown of thorns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, take him,\" said the King. And Hus was led to his death. As he\r\npassed along he saw the bonfire in which his books were being burned. He\r\nsmiled. Along the streets of the city he strode, with fetters clanking\r\non his feet, a thousand soldiers for his escort, and crowds of admirers\r\nsurging on every hand. Full soon the fatal spot was reached. It was a\r\nquiet meadow among the gardens, outside the city gates. At the stake he\r\nknelt once more in prayer, and the fool's cap fell from his head. Again\r\nhe smiled. It ought to be burned along with him, said a watcher, that he\r\nand the devils might be together. He was bound to the stake with seven\r\nmoist thongs and an old rusty chain, and faggots of wood and straw were\r\npiled round him to the chin. For the last time the Marshal approached to\r\ngive him a fair chance of abjuring.\r\n\r\n\"What errors,\" he retorted, \"shall I renounce? I know myself guilty of\r\nnone. I call God to witness that all that I have written and preached\r\nhas been with the view of rescuing souls from sin and perdition, and\r\ntherefore most joyfully will I confirm with my blood the truth I have\r\nwritten and preached.\"\r\n\r\nAs the flame arose and the wood crackled, he chanted the Catholic burial\r\nprayer, \"Jesu, Son of David, have mercy upon me.\" From the west a gentle\r\nbreeze was blowing, and a gust dashed the smoke and sparks in his face.\r\nAt the words \"Who was born of the Virgin Mary\" he ceased; his lips moved\r\nfaintly in silent prayer; and a few moments later the martyr breathed\r\nno more. At last the cruel fire died down, and the soldiers wrenched his\r\nremains from the post, hacked his skull in pieces, and ground his bones\r\nto powder. As they prodded about among the glowing embers to see how\r\nmuch of Hus was left, they found, to their surprise, that his heart was\r\nstill unburned. One fixed it on the point of his spear, thrust it\r\nback into the fire, and watched it frizzle away; and finally, by the\r\nMarshal's orders, they gathered all the ashes together, and tossed them\r\ninto the Rhine.\r\n\r\nHe had died, says a Catholic writer, for the noblest of all causes. He\r\nhad died for the faith which he believed to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. -- THE WELTER, 1415-1434.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in Bohemia was intense. As the ashes of Hus floated down\r\nthe Rhine, the news of his death spread over the civilized world, and in\r\nevery Bohemian town and hamlet the people felt that their greatest man\r\nhad been unjustly murdered. He had become the national hero and the\r\nnational saint, and now the people swore to avenge his death. A Hussite\r\nLeague was formed by his followers, a Catholic League was formed by his\r\nenemies. The Hussite Wars began. It is important to note with exactness\r\nwhat took place. As we study the history of men and nations, we are apt\r\nto fancy that the rank and file of a country can easily be united in\r\none by common adherence to a common cause. It is not so. For one man who\r\nwill steadily follow a principle, there are hundreds who would rather\r\nfollow a leader. As long as Hus was alive in the flesh, he was able to\r\ncommand the loyalty of the people; but now that his tongue was silent\r\nfor ever, his followers split into many contending factions. For all his\r\neloquence he had never been able to strike one clear commanding note. In\r\nsome of his views he was a Catholic, in others a Protestant. To some he\r\nwas merely the fiery patriot, to others the champion of Church Reform,\r\nto others the high-souled moral teacher, to others the enemy of the\r\nPope. If the people had only been united they might now have gained\r\ntheir long-lost freedom. But unity was the very quality they lacked the\r\nmost. They had no clear notion of what they wanted; they had no definite\r\nscheme of church reform; they had no great leader to show them the way\r\nthrough the jungle, and thus, instead of closing their ranks against the\r\ncommon foe, they split up into jangling sects and parties, and made the\r\nconfusion worse confounded.\r\n\r\nFirst in rank and first in power came the Utraquists or Calixtines.[2] For\r\nsome reason these men laid all the stress on a doctrine taught by Hus in\r\nhis later years. As he lay in his gloomy dungeon near Constance, he had\r\nwritten letters contending that laymen should be permitted to take the\r\nwine at the Communion. For this doctrine the Utraquists now fought\r\ntooth and nail. They emblazoned the Cup on their banners. They were the\r\naristocrats of the movement; they were led by the University dons; they\r\nwere political rather than religious in their aims; they regarded Hus\r\nas a patriot; and, on the whole, they did not care much for moral and\r\nspiritual reforms.\r\n\r\nNext came the Taborites, the red-hot Radicals, with Socialist ideas of\r\nproperty and loose ideals of morals. They built themselves a fort on\r\nMount Tabor, and held great open-air meetings. They rejected purgatory,\r\nmasses and the worship of saints. They condemned incense, images, bells,\r\nrelics and fasting. They declared that priests were an unnecessary\r\nnuisance. They celebrated the Holy Communion in barns, and baptized\r\ntheir babies in ponds and brooks. They held that every man had the right\r\nto his own interpretation of the Bible; they despised learning and art;\r\nand they revelled in pulling churches down and burning monks to death.\r\n\r\nNext came the Chiliasts, who fondly believed that the end of all things\r\nwas at hand, that the millennial reign of Christ would soon begin, and\r\nthat all the righteous--that is, they themselves--would have to hold the\r\nworld at bay in Five Cities of Refuge. For some years these mad fanatics\r\nregarded themselves as the chosen instruments of the Divine displeasure,\r\nand only awaited a signal from heaven to commence a general massacre\r\nof their fellow men. As that signal never came, however, they were\r\ngrievously disappointed.\r\n\r\nNext in folly came the Adamites, so called because, in shameless\r\nwise, they dressed like Adam and Eve before the fall. They made their\r\nhead-quarters on an island on the River Nesarka, and survived even after\r\nZiska had destroyed their camp.\r\n\r\nBut of all the heretical bodies in Bohemia the most influential were the\r\nWaldenses. As the history of the Waldenses is still obscure, we cannot\r\nsay for certain what views they held when they first came from Italy\r\nsome fifty or sixty years before. At first they seem to have been almost\r\nCatholics, but as the Hussite Wars went on they fell, it is said,\r\nunder the influence of the Taborites, and adopted many radical Taborite\r\nopinions. They held that prayer should be addressed, not to the Virgin\r\nMary and the Saints, but to God alone, and spoke with scorn of the\r\npopular doctrine that the Virgin in heaven showed her breast when\r\ninterceding for sinners. As they did not wish to create a disturbance,\r\nthey attended the public services of the Church of Rome; but they did\r\nnot believe in those services themselves, and are said to have employed\r\ntheir time at Church in picking holes in the logic of the speaker. They\r\nbelieved neither in building churches, nor in saying masses, nor in the\r\nadoration of pictures, nor in the singing of hymns at public worship.\r\nFor all practical intents and purposes they rejected entirely the\r\northodox Catholic distinction between things secular and things sacred,\r\nand held that a man could worship God just as well in a field as in a\r\nchurch, and that it did not matter in the least whether a man's body\r\nwas buried in consecrated or unconsecrated ground. What use, they asked,\r\nwere holy water, holy oil, holy palms, roots, crosses, holy splinters\r\nfrom the Cross of Christ? They rejected the doctrine of purgatory, and\r\nsaid that all men must go either to heaven or to hell. They rejected\r\nthe doctrine of Transubstantiation, and said that the wine and bread\r\nremained wine and bread. For us, however, the chief point of interest\r\nlies in the attitude they adopted towards the priests of the Church of\r\nRome. At that time there was spread all over Europe a legend that the\r\nEmperor, Constantine the Great, had made a so-called \"Donation\" to\r\nPope Sylvester; and the Waldenses held that the Church of Rome, by thus\r\nconsenting to be endowed by the State, had become morally corrupt, and\r\nno longer possessed the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. For this reason\r\nthey utterly despised the Roman priests; and contended that, being\r\nworldly men of bad character, they were qualified neither to administer\r\nthe sacraments nor to hear confessions. At this point we lay our finger\r\non the principle which led to the foundation of the Moravian Church.\r\nWhat ideal, we ask, did the Waldenses now set before them? We can answer\r\nthe question in a sentence. The whole object the Waldenses had now in\r\nview was to return to the simple teaching of Christ and the Apostles.\r\nThey wished to revive what they regarded as true primitive Christianity.\r\nFor this reason they brushed aside with scorn the bulls of Popes and the\r\ndecrees of Councils, and appealed to the command of the New Testament\r\nScriptures. For them the law of Christ was supreme and final; and,\r\nappealing to His teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, they declared that\r\noaths were wicked, and that war was no better than murder. If the law of\r\nChrist were obeyed, said they, what need would there be of government?\r\nHow long they had held these views we do not know. Some think they had\r\nheld them for centuries; some think they had learned them recently from\r\nthe Taborites. If scholars insist on this latter view, we are forced\r\nback on the further question: Where did the Taborites get their\r\nadvanced opinions? If the Taborites taught the Waldenses, who taught the\r\nTaborites? We do not know. For the present all we call say is that\r\nthe Waldenses in a quiet way were fast becoming a mighty force in the\r\ncountry. They addressed each other as brother and sister; they are said\r\nto have had their own translations of the Bible; they claimed a descent\r\nfrom the Apostles; and they are even held by some (though here we tread\r\non very thin ice) to have possessed their own episcopal succession.\r\n\r\nBut the method of the Taborites was different. If the Kingdom of God\r\nwas to come at all, it must come, they held, by force, by fire, by\r\nthe sword, by pillage and by famine. What need to tell here the\r\nblood-curdling story of the Hussite Wars? What need to tell here how\r\nPope Martin V. summoned the whole Catholic world to a grand crusade\r\nagainst the Bohemian people? What need to tell how the people of Prague\r\nattacked the Town Hall, and pitched the burgomaster and several aldermen\r\nout of the windows? For twenty years the whole land was one boiling\r\nwelter of confusion; and John Ziska, the famous blind general, took the\r\nlead of the Taborite army, and, standing on a wagon, with the banner\r\nabove him emblazoned with the Hussite Cup, he swept the country from end\r\nto end like a devouring prairie fire. It is held now by military experts\r\nthat Ziska was the greatest military genius of the age. If military\r\ngenius could have saved Bohemia, Bohemia would now have been saved. For\r\nsome years he managed to hold at bay the finest chivalry of Europe; and\r\nhe certainly saved the Hussite cause from being crushed in its birth.\r\nFor faith and freedom he fought--the faith of Hus and the freedom of\r\nBohemia. He formed the rough Bohemian peasantry into a disciplined army.\r\nHe armed his men with lances, slings, iron-pointed flails and clubs. He\r\nformed his barricades of iron-clad wagons, and whirled them in murderous\r\nmazes round the field. He made a special study of gunpowder, and taught\r\nhis men the art of shooting straight. He has often been compared to\r\nOliver Cromwell, and like our Oliver he was in many ways. He was stern\r\nin dealing with his enemies, and once had fifty Adamites burned to\r\ndeath. He was sure that God was on his side in the war. \"Be it known,\"\r\nhe wrote to his supporters, \"that we are collecting men from all parts\r\nof the country against these enemies of God and devastators of our\r\nBohemian land.\" He composed a stirring battle song, and taught his men\r\nto sing it in chorus when they marched to meet the foe.\r\n\r\n   Therefore, manfully cry out:\r\n   \"At them! rush at them.\"\r\n   Wield bravely your arms!\r\n   Pray to your Lord God.\r\n   Strike and kill! spare none!\r\n\r\nWhat a combination of piety and fury! It was all in vain. The great\r\ngeneral died of a fever. The thunderbolt fell. At a meeting in Prague\r\nthe Utraquists and Catholics at last came to terms, and drew up a\r\ncompromise known as the \"Compactata of Basle\" (1433). For nearly two\r\nhundred years after this these \"Compactata\" were regarded as the law\r\nof the land; and the Utraquist Church was recognised by the Pope as the\r\nnational self-governing Church of Bohemia. The terms of the Compactata\r\nwere four in number. The Communion was to be given to laymen in both\r\nkinds; all mortal sins were to be punished by the proper authorities;\r\nthe Word of God was to be freely preached by faithful priests and\r\ndeacons; and no priests were to have any worldly possessions. For\r\npractical purposes this agreement meant the defeat of the advanced\r\nreforming movement. One point the Utraquists had gained, and one alone;\r\nthey were allowed to take the wine at the Communion. For the rest these\r\nUtraquist followers of Hus were as Catholic as the Pope himself. They\r\nadored the Host, read the masses, kept the fasts, and said the prayers\r\nas their fathers had done before them. From that moment the fate of the\r\nTaborite party was sealed. At the battle of Lipan they were defeated,\r\nrouted, crushed out of existence. {1434}. The battle became a massacre.\r\nThe slaughter continued all the night and part of the following day, and\r\nhundreds were burned to death in their huts.\r\n\r\nWas this to be the end of Hus's strivings? What was it in Hus that was\r\ndestined to survive? What was it that worked like a silent leaven amid\r\nthe clamours of war? We shall see. Amid these charred and smoking ruins\r\nthe Moravian Church arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. -- PETER OF CHELCIC, 1419-1450.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a mighty prophet had arisen, with a clear and startling\r\nmessage. His name was Peter, and he lived down south, in the little\r\nvillage of Chelcic.[3] As the historian rummages among the ancient\r\nrecords, he discovers to his sorrow that scarcely anything is known of\r\nthe life of this great man; but, on the other hand, it is a joy to\r\nknow that while his story is wrapped in mystery, his teaching has been\r\npreserved, and that some of the wonderful books he wrote are treasured\r\nstill in his native land as gems of Bohemian literature. In later years\r\nit was commonly said that he began life as a cobbler; but that story,\r\nat least, may be dismissed as a legend. He enlisted, we are told, in\r\nthe army. He then discovered that a soldier's life was wicked; he then\r\nthought of entering a monastery, but was shocked by what he heard of the\r\nimmoralities committed within the holy walls; and finally, having some\r\nmeans of his own, retired to his little estate at Chelcic, and spent\r\nhis time in writing pamphlets about the troubles of his country. He\r\nhad picked up a smattering of education in Prague. He had studied the\r\nwritings of Wycliffe and of Hus, and often appealed to Wycliffe in his\r\nworks. He could quote, when he liked, from the great Church Fathers. He\r\nhad a fair working knowledge of the Bible; and, above all, he had the\r\nteaching of Christ and the Apostles engraved upon his conscience and his\r\nheart. As he was not a priest, he could afford to be independent; as he\r\nknew but little Latin, he wrote in Bohemian; and thus, like Stitny and\r\nHus before him, he appealed to the people in language they could all\r\nunderstand. Of all the leaders of men in Bohemia, this Peter was the\r\nmost original and daring. As he pondered on the woes of his native land,\r\nhe came to the firm but sad conclusion that the whole system of religion\r\nand politics was rotten to the core. Not one of the jangling sects was\r\nin the right. Not one was true to the spirit of Christ. Not one was\r\nfree from the dark red stain of murder. His chief works were his Net\r\nof Faith, his Reply to Nicholas of Pilgram, his Reply to Rockycana, his\r\nImage of the Beast, his theological treatise On the Body of Christ,\r\nhis tract The Foundation of Worldly Laws, his devotional commentary,\r\nExposition of the Passion according to St. John, and, last, though not\r\nleast, his volume of discourses on the Gospel lessons for the year,\r\nentitled Postillia. Of these works the most famous was his masterly Net\r\nof Faith. He explained the title himself. \"Through His disciples,\" said\r\nPeter, \"Christ caught the world in the net of His faith, but the bigger\r\nfishes, breaking the net, escaped. Then others followed through these\r\nsame holes made by the big fishes, and the net was left almost empty.\"\r\nHis meaning was clear to all. The net was the true Church of Christ; the\r\ntwo whales who broke it were the Emperor and the Pope; the big fishes\r\nwere the mighty \"learned persons, heretics and offenders\"; and the\r\nlittle fishes were the true followers of Christ.\r\n\r\nHe opened his bold campaign in dramatic style. When John Ziska and\r\nNicholas of Husinec declared at Prague that the time had come for the\r\nfaithful to take up arms in their own defence, Peter was present at the\r\ndebate, and contended that for Christians war was a crime. {1419.}\r\n\r\n\"What is war?\" he asked. \"It is a breach of the laws of God! All\r\nsoldiers are violent men, murderers, a godless mob!\"\r\n\r\nHe hated war like a Quaker, and soldiers like Tolstoy himself. He\r\nregarded the terrible Hussite Wars as a disgrace to both sides. As the\r\nfiery Ziska swept the land with his waggons, this Apostle of peace was\r\nsick with horror. \"Where,\" he asked, in his Reply to Rockycana, \"has God\r\nrecalled His commands, 'Thou shalt not kill,' 'Thou shalt not steal,'\r\n'Thou shalt not take thy neighbour's goods'? If God has not repealed\r\nthese commands, they ought still to be obeyed to-day in Prague and\r\nTabor. I have learned from Christ, and by Christ I stand; and if the\r\nApostle Peter himself were to come down from Heaven and say that it was\r\nright for us to take up arms to defend the truth, I should not believe\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nFor Peter the teaching of Christ and the Apostles was enough. It was\r\nsupreme, final, perfect. If a king made a new law, he was spoiling\r\nthe teaching of Christ. If the Pope issued a bull, he was spoiling the\r\nteaching of Christ. If a Council of Bishops drew up a decree, they were\r\nspoiling the teaching of Christ. As God, said Peter, had revealed His\r\nwill to full perfection in Jesus Christ, there was no need for laws made\r\nby men. \"Is the law of God sufficient, without worldly laws, to\r\nguide and direct us in the path of the true Christian religion? With\r\ntrembling, I answer, it is. It was sufficient for Christ Himself, and it\r\nwas sufficient for His disciples.\" And, therefore, the duty of all\r\ntrue Christians was as clear as the noon-day sun. He never said that\r\nChristian people should break the law of the land. He admitted that\r\nGod might use the law for good purposes; and therefore, as Christ had\r\nsubmitted to Pilate, so Christians must submit to Government. But there\r\ntheir connection with Government must end. For heathens the State was\r\na necessary evil; for Christians it was an unclean thing, and the less\r\nthey had to do with it the better. They must never allow the State to\r\ninterfere in matters within the Church. They must never drag each other\r\nbefore the law courts. They must never act as judges or magistrates.\r\nThey must never take any part whatever in municipal or national\r\ngovernment. They must never, if possible, live in a town at all. If\r\nChristians, said Peter, lived in a town, and paid the usual rates and\r\ntaxes, they were simply helping to support a system which existed for\r\nthe protection of robbers. He regarded towns as the abodes of vice, and\r\ncitizens as rogues and knaves. The first town, he said, was built by the\r\nmurderer, Cain. He first murdered his brother Abel; he then gathered his\r\nfollowers together; he then built a city, surrounded by walls; and thus,\r\nby robbery and violence, he became a well-to-do man. And modern towns,\r\nsaid Peter, were no whit better. At that time the citizens of some towns\r\nin Bohemia enjoyed certain special rights and privileges; and this, to\r\nPeter, seemed grossly unfair. He condemned those citizens as thieves.\r\n\"They are,\" he said, \"the strength of Anti-Christ; they are adversaries\r\nto Christ; they are an evil rabble; they are bold in wickedness; and\r\nthough they pretend to follow the truth, they will sit at tables with\r\nwicked people and knavish followers of Judas.\" For true Christians,\r\ntherefore, there was only one course open. Instead of living in godless\r\ntowns, they should try to settle in country places, earn their living as\r\nfarmers or gardeners, and thus keep as clear of the State as possible.\r\nThey were not to try to support the law at all. If they did, they were\r\nsupporting a wicked thing, which never tried to make men better, but\r\nonly crushed them with cruel and useless punishments. They must never\r\ntry to make big profits in business. If they did, they were simply\r\nrobbing and cheating their neighbours. They must never take an oath, for\r\noaths were invented by the devil. They must never, in a word, have any\r\nconnection with that unchristian institution called the State.\r\n\r\nAnd here Peter waxed vigorous and eloquent. He objected, like Wycliffe,\r\nto the union of Church and State. Of all the bargains ever struck,\r\nthe most wicked, ruinous and pernicious was the bargain struck between\r\nChurch and State, when Constantine the Great first took the Christians\r\nunder the shadow of his wing. For three hundred years, said Peter,\r\nthe Church of Christ had remained true to her Master; and then this\r\ndisgusting heathen Emperor, who had not repented of a single sin, came\r\nin with his vile \"Donation,\" and poisoned all the springs of her life.\r\nIf the Emperor, said Peter, wanted to be a Christian, he ought first to\r\nhave laid down his crown. He was a ravenous beast; he was a wolf in the\r\nfold; he was a lion squatting at the table; and at that fatal moment in\r\nhistory, when he gave his \"Donation\" to the Pope, an angel in heaven\r\nhad spoken the words: \"This day has poison entered the blood of the\r\nChurch.\"[4]\r\n\"Since that time,\" said Peter, \"these two powers, Imperial and Papal,\r\nhave clung together. They have turned everything to account in Church\r\nand in Christendom for their own impious purposes. Theologians,\r\nprofessors, and priests are the satraps of the Emperor. They ask the\r\nEmperor to protect them, so that they may sleep as long as possible, and\r\nthey create war so that they may have everything under their thumb.\"\r\n\r\nIf Peter lashed the Church with whips, he lashed her priests with\r\nscorpions. He accused them of various vices. They were immoral; they\r\nwere superstitious; they were vain, ignorant and empty-headed; and,\r\ninstead of feeding the Church of God, they had almost starved her to\r\ndeath. He loathed these \"honourable men, who sit in great houses, these\r\npurple men, with their beautiful mantles, their high caps, their fat\r\nstomachs.\" He accused them of fawning on the rich and despising the\r\npoor. \"As for love of pleasure,\" he said, \"immorality, laziness,\r\ngreediness, uncharitableness and cruelty--as for these things, the\r\npriests do not hold them as sins when committed by princes, nobles and\r\nrich commoners. They do not tell them plainly, \"You will go to hell if\r\nyou live on the fat of the poor, and live a bestial life,\" although they\r\nknow that the rich are condemned to eternal death by such behaviour.\r\nOh, no! They prefer to give them a grand funeral. A crowd of priests,\r\nclergy, and other folk make a long procession. The bells are rung. There\r\nare masses, singings, candles and offerings. The virtues of the dead\r\nman are proclaimed from the pulpit. They enter his soul in the books of\r\ntheir cloisters and churches to be continually prayed for, and if what\r\nthey say be true, that soul cannot possibly perish, for he has been so\r\nkind to the Church, and must, indeed, be well cared for.\"\r\n\r\nHe accused them, further, of laziness and gluttony. \"They pretend to\r\nfollow Christ,\" he said, \"and have plenty to eat every day. They have\r\nfish, spices, brawn, herrings, figs, almonds, Greek wine and other\r\nluxuries. They generally drink good wine and rich beer in large\r\nquantities, and so they go to sleep. When they cannot get luxuries they\r\nfill themselves with vulgar puddings till they nearly burst. And this is\r\nthe way the priests fast.\" He wrote in a similar strain of the mendicant\r\nfriars. He had no belief in their profession of poverty, and accused\r\nthem of gathering as much money as they could. They pocketed more money\r\nby begging, he declared, than honest folk could earn by working; they\r\ndespised plain beef, fat bacon and peas, and they wagged their tails\r\nwith joy when they sat down to game and other luxuries. \"Many citizens,\"\r\nsaid Peter, \"would readily welcome this kind of poverty.\"\r\n\r\nHe accused the priests of loose teaching and shameless winking at sin.\r\n\"They prepare Jesus,\" he said, \"as a sweet sauce for the world, so that\r\nthe world may not have to shape its course after Jesus and His heavy\r\nCross, but that Jesus may conform to the world; and they make Him softer\r\nthan oil, so that every wound may be soothed, and the violent, thieves,\r\nmurderers and adulterers may have an easy entrance into heaven.\"\r\n\r\nHe accused them of degrading the Seven Sacraments. They baptized\r\nsinners, young and old, without demanding repentance. They sold the\r\nCommunion to rascals and rogues, like a huckstress offering her wares.\r\nThey abused Confession by pardoning men who never intended to amend\r\ntheir evil ways. They allowed men of the vilest character to be ordained\r\nas priests. They degraded marriage by preaching the doctrine that it was\r\nless holy than celibacy. They distorted the original design of Extreme\r\nUnction, for instead of using it to heal the sick they used it to line\r\ntheir own pockets. And all these blasphemies, sins and follies were the\r\noffspring of that adulterous union between the Church and the State,\r\nwhich began in the days of Constantine the Great. For of all the evils\r\nunder Heaven, the greatest, said Peter, was that contradiction in\r\nterms--a State Church.\r\n\r\nHe attacked the great theologians and scholars. Instead of using their\r\nmental powers in the search for truth, these college men, said Peter,\r\nhad done their best to suppress the truth; and at the two great Councils\r\nof Constance and Basle, they had actually obtained the help of the\r\ntemporal power to crush all who dared to hold different views from\r\ntheirs. What use, asked Peter, were these learned pundits? They were no\r\nuse at all. They never instructed anybody. \"I do not know,\" he said,\r\n\"a single person whom they have helped with their learning.\" Had they\r\ninstructed Hus? No. Hus had the faith in himself; Hus was instructed by\r\nGod; and all that these ravens did for Hus was to flock together against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAgain, Peter denounced the Bohemian nobles. As we read his biting,\r\nsatirical phrases we can see that he was no respecter of persons and\r\nno believer in artificial distinctions of rank. For him the only\r\ndistinction worth anything was the moral distinction between those who\r\nfollowed the crucified Jesus and those who rioted in selfish pleasures.\r\n\r\nHe had no belief in blue blood and noble birth. He was almost, though\r\nnot quite, a Socialist. He had no definite, constructive social policy.\r\nHe was rather a champion of the rights of the poor, and an apostle of\r\nthe simple life. \"The whole value of noble birth,\" he said, \"is founded\r\non a wicked invention of the heathen, who obtained coats of arms from\r\nemperors or kings as a reward for some deed of valour.\" If a man could\r\nonly buy a coat of arms--a stag, a gate, a wolf's head, or a sausage--he\r\nbecame thereby a nobleman, boasted of his high descent, and was regarded\r\nby the public as a saint. For such \"nobility\" Peter had a withering\r\ncontempt. He declared that nobles of this stamp had no right to belong\r\nto the Christian Church. They lived, he said, in flat opposition to the\r\nspirit of Jesus Christ. They devoured the poor. They were a burden to\r\nthe country. They did harm to all men. They set their minds on worldly\r\nglory, and spent their money on extravagant dress. \"The men,\" said he,\r\n\"wear capes reaching down to the ground, and their long hair falls down\r\nto their shoulders; and the women wear so many petticoats that they\r\ncan hardly drag themselves along, and strut about like the Pope's\r\ncourtezans, to the surprise and disgust of the whole world.\" What right\r\nhad these selfish fops to call themselves Christians? They did more harm\r\nto the cause of Christ than all the Turks and heathens in the world.\r\n\r\nThus Peter, belonging to none of the sects, found grievous faults in\r\nthem all. As he always mentions the Waldenses with respect, it has been\r\nsuggested that he was a Waldensian himself. But of that there is no real\r\nproof. He had, apparently, no organizing skill; he never attempted to\r\nform a new sect or party, and his mission in the world was to throw\r\nout hints and leave it to others to carry these hints into practice.\r\nHe condemned the Utraquists because they used the sword. \"If a man,\" he\r\nsaid, \"eats a black pudding on Friday, you blame him; but if he sheds\r\nhis brother's blood on the scaffold or on the field of battle you\r\npraise him.\" He condemned the Taborites because they made light of the\r\nSacraments. \"You have called the Holy Bread,\" he said, \"a butterfly, a\r\nbat, an idol. You have even told the people that it is better to kneel\r\nto the devil than to kneel at the altar; and thus you have taught them\r\nto despise religion and wallow in unholy lusts.\" He condemned the King\r\nfor being a King at all; for no intelligent man, said Peter, could\r\npossibly be a King and a Christian at the same time. And finally he\r\ncondemned the Pope as Antichrist and the enemy of God.\r\n\r\nYet Peter was something more than a caustic critic. For the terrible\r\nills of his age and country he had one plain and homely remedy, and that\r\nfor all true Christians to leave the Church of Rome and return to the\r\nsimple teaching of Christ and His Apostles. If the reader goes to Peter\r\nfor systematic theology, he will be grievously disappointed; but if he\r\ngoes for moral vigour, he will find a well-spread table.\r\n\r\nHe did not reason his positions out like Wycliffe; he was a suggestive\r\nessayist rather than a constructive philosopher; and, radical though\r\nhe was in some of his views, he held firm to what he regarded as\r\nthe fundamental articles of the Christian faith. He believed in the\r\nredemptive value of the death of Christ. He believed that man must build\r\nhis hopes, not so much on his own good works, but rather on the grace\r\nof God. He believed, all the same, that good works were needed and\r\nwould receive their due reward. He believed, further, in the real\r\nbodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament; and on this topic he held\r\na doctrine very similar to Luther's doctrine of Consubstantiation. But,\r\nover and above all these beliefs, he insisted, in season and out of\r\nseason, that men could partake of spiritual blessings without the aid\r\nof Roman priests. Some fruit of his labours he saw. As the fire of\r\nthe Hussite Wars died down, a few men in different parts of the\r\ncountry--especially at Chelcic, Wilenow and Divischau--began to take\r\nPeter as their spiritual guide. They read his pamphlets with delight,\r\nbecame known as the \"Brethren of Chelcic,\" and wore a distinctive dress,\r\na grey cloak with a cord tied round the waist. The movement spread, the\r\nsocieties multiplied, and thus, in a way no records tell, were laid the\r\nfoundations of the Church of the Brethren. Did Peter see that Church? We\r\ndo not know. No one knows when Peter was born, and no one knows when\r\nhe died. He delivered his message; he showed the way; he flashed his\r\nlantern in the darkness; and thus, whether he knew it or not, he was the\r\nliterary founder of the Brethren's Church. He fired the hope. He drew\r\nthe plans. It was left to another man to erect the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. -- GREGORY THE PATRIARCH AND THE SOCIETY AT KUNWALD, 1457-1473.\r\n\r\nA brilliant idea is an excellent thing. A man to work it out is still\r\nbetter. At the very time when Peter's followers were marshalling their\r\nforces, John Rockycana,[5] Archbishop-elect of Prague (since 1448), was\r\nmaking a mighty stir in that drunken city. What Peter had done with his\r\npen, Rockycana was doing with his tongue. He preached Peter's doctrines\r\nin the great Thein Church; he corresponded with him on the burning\r\ntopics of the day; he went to see him at his estate; he recommended his\r\nworks to his hearers; and week by week, in fiery language, he denounced\r\nthe Church of Rome as Babylon, and the Pope as Antichrist himself. His\r\nstyle was vivid and picturesque, his language cutting and clear. One day\r\nhe compared the Church of Rome to a burned and ruined city, wherein the\r\nbeasts of the forests made their lairs; and, again, he compared her to\r\na storm-tossed ship, which sank beneath the howling waves because the\r\nsailors were fighting each other. \"It is better,\" he said, \"to tie a dog\r\nto a pulpit than allow a priest to defile it. It is better, oh, women!\r\nfor your sons to be hangmen than to be priests; for the hangman only\r\nkills the body, while the priest kills the soul. Look there,\" he\r\nsuddenly exclaimed one Sunday, pointing to a picture of St. Peter on the\r\nwall, \"there is as much difference between the priests of to-day and the\r\ntwelve apostles as there is between that old painting and the living St.\r\nPeter in heaven.[6] For the priests have put the devil into the sacraments\r\nthemselves, and are leading you straight to the fires of Hell.\"\r\n\r\nIf an eloquent speaker attacks the clergy, he is sure to draw a crowd.\r\nNo wonder the Thein Church was crammed. No wonder the people listened\r\nwith delight as he backed up his hot attack with texts from the prophet\r\nJeremiah. No wonder they cried in their simple zeal: \"Behold, a second\r\nJohn Hus has arisen.\"\r\n\r\nBut John Rockycana was no second John Hus. For all his fire in the\r\npulpit, he was only a craven at heart. \"If a true Christian,\" said he\r\nto a friend, \"were to turn up now in Prague, he would be gaped at like\r\na stag with golden horns.\" But he was not a stag with golden horns\r\nhimself. As he thundered against the Church of Rome, he was seeking,\r\nnot the Kingdom of God, but his own fame and glory. His followers soon\r\ndiscovered his weakness. Among those who thronged to hear his sermons\r\nwere certain quiet men of action, who were not content to paw the ground\r\nfor ever. They were followers of Peter of Chelcic; they passed\r\nhis pamphlets in secret from hand to hand; they took down notes of\r\nRockycana's sermons; and now they resolved to practise what they heard.\r\nIf Peter had taught them nothing else, he had at least convinced them\r\nall that the first duty of Christian men was to quit the Church of Rome.\r\nAgain and again they appealed to Rockycana to be their head, to act\r\nup to his words, and to lead them out to the promised land. The great\r\norator hemmed and hawed, put them off with excuses, and told them, after\r\nthe manner of cowards, that they were too hasty and reckless. \"I know\r\nyou are right,\" said he, \"but if I joined your ranks I should be reviled\r\non every hand.\"[7] But these listeners were not to be cowed. The more\r\nthey studied Peter's writings, the more they lost faith in Rockycana.\r\nAs Rockycana refused to lead them, they left his church in a body, and\r\nfound a braver leader among themselves. His name was Gregory; he was\r\nknown as Gregory the Patriarch; and in due time, as we shall see, he\r\nbecame the founder of the Church of the Brethren. He was already a\r\nmiddle-aged man. He was the son of a Bohemian knight, and was nephew\r\nto Rockycana himself. He had spent his youth in the Slaven cloister at\r\nPrague as a bare-footed monk, had found the cloister not so moral as he\r\nhad expected, had left it in disgust, and was now well known in Bohemia\r\nas a man of sterling character, pious and sensible, humble and strict,\r\nactive and spirited, a good writer and a good speaker. He was a personal\r\nfriend of Peter, had studied his works with care, and is said to have\r\nbeen particularly fond of a little essay entitled \"The Image of the\r\nBeast,\" which he had borrowed from a blacksmith in Wachovia. As time\r\nwent on he lost patience with Rockycana, came into touch with the little\r\nsocieties at Wilenow and Divischau, visited Peter on his estate, and\r\ngradually formed the plan of founding an independent society, and thus\r\ndoing himself what Rockycana was afraid to do. As soldiers desert a\r\ncowardly general and rally round the standard of a brave one, so these\r\nlisteners in the old Thein Church fell away from halting Rockycana, and\r\nrallied round Gregory the Patriarch. From all parts of Bohemia, from all\r\nranks of society, from all whom Peter's writings had touched, from all\r\nwho were disgusted with the Church of Rome, and who wished to see the\r\nTrue Church of the Apostles bloom in purity and beauty again, from\r\nall especially who desired the ministration of priests of moral\r\ncharacter--from all these was his little band recruited. How it all\r\nhappened we know not; but slowly the numbers swelled. At last the\r\nterrible question arose: How and where must they live? The question\r\nwas one of life and death. Not always could they worship in secret; not\r\nalways be scattered in little groups. It was time, they said, to close\r\ntheir ranks and form an army that should last. \"After us,\" Rockycana had\r\nsaid in a sermon, \"shall a people come well-pleasing unto God and right\r\nhealthy for men; they shall follow the Scriptures, and the example of\r\nChrist and the footsteps of the Apostles.\" And these stern men felt\r\ncalled to the holy task.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1457, Uladislaus Postumus, King of Bohemia, died, and George\r\nPodiebrad reigned in his stead; and about the same time it came to the\r\nears of Gregory the Patriarch that in the barony of Senftenberg, on the\r\nnorth-east border of Bohemia, there lay a village that would serve as\r\na home for him and his trusty followers. And the village was called\r\nKunwald, and the old castle hard by was called Lititz. The village\r\nwas almost deserted, and only a few simple folk, of the same mind as\r\nGregory, lived there now. What better refuge could be found? Gregory\r\nthe Patriarch laid the scheme before his uncle Rockycana; Rockycana, who\r\nsympathized with their views and wished to help them, brought the matter\r\nbefore King George; the King, who owned the estate, gave his gracious\r\npermission; and Gregory and his faithful friends wended their way to\r\nKunwald, and there began to form the first settlement of the Church of\r\nthe Brethren. And now many others from far and wide came to make Kunwald\r\ntheir home. Some came from the Thein Church in Prague, some across the\r\nGlatz Hills from Moravia, some from Wilenow, Divischau and Chelcic, some\r\nfrom the Utraquist Church at Königgratz,[8] some, clothed and in their\r\nright minds, from those queer folk, the Adamites, and some from little\r\nWaldensian groups that lay dotted here and there about the land. There\r\nwere citizens from Prague and other cities. There were bachelors and\r\nmasters from the great University. There were peasants and nobles,\r\nlearned and simple, rich and poor, with their wives and children; and\r\nthus did many, who longed to be pure and follow the Master and Him\r\nalone, find a Bethany of Peace in the smiling little valley of Kunwald.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the valley of Kunwald, did these pioneers lay the\r\nfoundation stones of the Moravian Church {1457 or 1458.}.[9] They were\r\nall of one heart and one mind. They honoured Christ alone as King;\r\nthey confessed His laws alone as binding. They were not driven from the\r\nChurch of Rome; they left of their own free will. They were men of deep\r\nreligious experience. As they mustered their forces in that quiet dale,\r\nthey knew that they were parting company from Church and State alike.\r\nThey had sought the guidance of God in prayer, and declared that their\r\nprayers were answered. They had met to seek the truth of God, not from\r\npriests, but from God Himself. \"As we knew not where to turn,\" they\r\nwrote to Rockycana, \"we turned in prayer to God Himself, and besought\r\nHim to reveal to us His gracious will in all things. We wanted to walk\r\nin His ways; we wanted instruction in His wisdom; and in His mercy He\r\nanswered our prayers.\" They would rather, they said, spend weeks in gaol\r\nthan take the oath as councillors. They built cottages, tilled the land,\r\nopened workshops, and passed their time in peace and quietness. For\r\na law and a testimony they had the Bible and the writings of Peter of\r\nChelcic. In Michael Bradacius, a Utraquist priest, they found a faithful\r\npastor. They made their own laws and appointed a body of twenty-eight\r\nelders to enforce them. They divided themselves into three classes, the\r\nBeginners, the Learners and the Perfect;[10] and the Perfect gave up their\r\nprivate property for the good of the common cause. They had overseers to\r\ncare for the poor. They had priests to administer the sacraments, They\r\nhad godly laymen to teach the Scriptures. They had visitors to see to\r\nthe purity of family life. They were shut off from the madding crowd by\r\na narrow gorge, with the Glatz Mountains towering on the one side and\r\nthe hoary old castle of Lititz, a few miles off, on the other; and there\r\nin that fruitful valley, where orchards smiled and gardens bloomed,\r\nand neat little cottages peeped out from the woodland, they plied their\r\ntrades and read their Bibles, and kept themselves pure and unspotted\r\nfrom the world under the eye of God Almighty.[11]\r\nBut it was not long before these Brethren had to show of what metal they\r\nwere made. With each other they were at peace, but in Bohemia the sea\r\nstill rolled from the storm. It is curious how people reasoned in those\r\ndays. As the Brethren used bread instead of wafer at the Holy Communion,\r\na rumour reached the ears of the King that they were dangerous\r\nconspirators, and held secret meetings of a mysterious and unholy\r\nnature. And King George held himself an orthodox King, and had sworn to\r\nallow no heretics in his kingdom. As soon therefore, as he heard that\r\nGregory the Patriarch had come on a visit to Prague, and was actually\r\nholding a meeting of University students in the New Town, he came down\r\nupon them like a wolf on the fold, and gave orders to arrest them on the\r\nspot. He was sure they were hatching a villainous plot of some kind. In\r\nvain some friends sent warning to the students. They resolved, with a\r\nfew exceptions, to await their fate and stand to their guns. \"Come what\r\nmay,\" said they, in their fiery zeal, \"let the rack be our breakfast\r\nand the funeral pile our dinner!\" The door of the room flew open. The\r\nmagistrate and his bailiffs appeared. \"All,\" said the magistrate, as\r\nhe stood at the threshold, \"who wish to live godly in Christ Jesus must\r\nsuffer persecution. Follow me to prison.\" They followed him, and were at\r\nonce stretched upon the rack. As soon as the students felt the pain of\r\ntorture their courage melted like April snow. After they had tasted the\r\nbreakfast they had no appetite for the dinner. They went in a body to\r\nthe Thein Church, mounted the pulpit one by one, pleaded guilty to the\r\ncharges brought against them, and confessed, before an admiring crowd,\r\ntheir full belief in all the dogmas of the Holy Church of Rome. But for\r\nGregory the Patriarch, who was now growing old, the pain was too severe.\r\nHis wrists cracked; he swooned, and was thought to be dead, and in his\r\nswoon he dreamed a dream which seemed to him like the dreams of the\r\nprophets of old. He saw, in a lovely meadow, a tree laden with fruit;\r\nthe fruit was being plucked by birds; the flights of the birds were\r\nguided by a youth of heavenly beauty, and the tree was guarded by three\r\nmen whose faces he seemed to know. What meant that dream to Gregory and\r\nhis Brethren? It was a vision of the good time coming. The tree was the\r\nChurch of the Brethren. The fruit was her Bible teaching. The birds were\r\nher ministers and helpers. The youth of radiant beauty was the Divine\r\nMaster Himself. And the three men who stood on guard were the three men\r\nwho were afterwards chosen as the first three Elders of the Brethren's\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nWhile Gregory lay in his swoon, his old teacher, his uncle, his sometime\r\nfriend, John Rockycana, hearing that he was dying, came to see him.\r\nHis conscience was stricken, his heart bled, and, wringing his hands in\r\nagony, he moaned: \"Oh, my Gregory, my Gregory, would I were where thou\r\nart.\" When Gregory recovered, Rockycana pleaded for him, and the King\r\nallowed the good old Patriarch to return in peace to Kunwald.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the first persecution of the Brethren had begun in deadly\r\nearnest {1461.}. King George Podiebrad was furious. He issued an order\r\nthat all his subjects were to join either the Utraquist or the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. He issued another order that all priests who conducted\r\nthe Communion in the blasphemous manner of the Brethren should forthwith\r\nbe put to death. The priest, old Michael, was cast into a dungeon; four\r\nleading Brethren were burned alive; the peaceful home in Kunwald was\r\nbroken; and the Brethren fled to the woods and mountains. For two full\r\nyears they lived the life of hunted deer in the forest. As they durst\r\nnot light a fire by day, they cooked their meals by night; and then,\r\nwhile the enemy dreamed and slept, they read their Bibles by the\r\nwatch-fires' glare, and prayed till the blood was dripping from their\r\nknees. If provisions ran short, they formed a procession, and marched in\r\nsingle file to the nearest village; and when the snow lay on the ground\r\nthey trailed behind them a pine-tree branch, so that folk would think a\r\nwild beast had been prowling around. We can see them gathering in those\r\nBohemian glades. As the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky, and\r\nthe night wind kissed the pine trees, they read to each other the golden\r\npromise that where two or three were gathered together in His name He\r\nwould be in the midst of them;[12] and rejoiced that they, the chosen of\r\nGod, had been called to suffer for the truth and the Church that was yet\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nIn vain they appealed to Rockycana; he had done with them for ever.\r\n\"Thou art of the world,\" they wrote, \"and wilt perish with the world.\"\r\nThey were said to have made a covenant with the devil, and were commonly\r\ndubbed \"Pitmen\" because they lived in pits and caves. Yet not for a\r\nmoment did they lose hope. At the very time when the king in his\r\nfolly thought they were crushed beneath his foot, they were in reality\r\nincreasing in numbers every day. As their watch-fires shone in the\r\ndarkness of the forests, so their pure lives shone among a darkened\r\npeople. No weapon did they use except the pen. They never retaliated,\r\nnever rebelled, never took up arms in their own defence, never even\r\nappealed to the arm of justice. When smitten on one cheek, they turned\r\nthe other; and from ill-report they went to good report, till the King\r\nfor very shame had to let them be. Well aware was he that brutal force\r\ncould never stamp out spiritual life. \"I advise you,\" said a\r\ncertain Bishop, \"to shed no more blood. Martyrdom is somewhat like a\r\nhalf-roasted joint of meat, apt to breed maggots.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the time drew near for Gregory's dream to come true. When the\r\nBrethren settled in the valley of Kunwald they had only done half their\r\nwork. They had quitted the \"benighted\" Church of Rome; they had not\r\nyet put a better Church in her place. They had settled on a Utraquist\r\nestate; they were under the protection of a Utraquist King;\r\nthey attended services conducted by Utraquist priests. But this\r\nblack-and-white policy could not last for ever. If they wished to be\r\ngodly men themselves, they must have godly men in the pulpits. What\r\nright had they, the chosen of God (as they called themselves) to listen\r\nto sermons from men in league with the State? What right had they\r\nto take the Holy Bread and Wine from the tainted hands of Utraquist\r\npriests? What right had they to confess their sins to men with the brand\r\nof Rome upon their foreheads? If they were to have any priests at all,\r\nthose priests, like Caesar's wife, must be above suspicion. They must be\r\npastors after God's own heart, who should feed the people with knowledge\r\nand understanding (Jer. iii. 15). They must be clear of any connection\r\nwith the State. They must be descended from the twelve Apostles. They\r\nmust be innocent of the crime of simony. They must work with their hands\r\nfor their living, and be willing to spend their money on the poor. But\r\nwhere could such clean vessels of the Lord be found? For a while\r\nthe Brethren were almost in despair; for a while they were even half\r\ninclined to do without priests at all. In vain they searched the country\r\nround; in vain they inquired about priests in foreign lands. When they\r\nasked about the pure Nestorian Church supposed to exist in India, they\r\nreceived the answer that that Church was now as corrupt as the Romish.\r\nWhen they asked about the Greek Church in Russia, they received the\r\nanswer that the Russian Bishops were willing to consecrate any man, good\r\nor bad, so long as he paid the fees. The question was pressing. If they\r\ndid without good priests much longer, they would lose their standing in\r\nthe country. \"You must,\" said Brother Martin Lupac, a Utraquist priest,\r\nwho had joined their ranks, \"you must establish a proper order of\r\npriests from among yourselves. If you don't, the whole cause will be\r\nruined. To do without priests is no sin against God; but it is a sin\r\nagainst your fellow-men.\" As they pondered on the fateful question, the\r\nvery light of Heaven itself seemed to flash upon their souls. It was\r\nthey who possessed the unity of the spirit; and therefore it was they\r\nwho were called to renew the Church of the Apostles. They had now become\r\na powerful body; they were founding settlements all over the land; they\r\nstood, they said, for the truth as it was in Jesus; they had all one\r\nfaith, one hope, one aim, one sense of the Spirit leading them onward;\r\nand they perceived that if they were to weather the gale in those stormy\r\ntimes they must cut the chains that bound them to Rome, and fly their\r\nown colours in the breeze.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in 1467, about ten years after the foundation of Kunwald, there\r\nmet at Lhota a Synod of the Brethren to settle the momentous question\r\n{1467.}, \"Is it God's will that we separate entirely from the power\r\nof the Papacy, and hence from its priesthood? Is it God's will that we\r\ninstitute, according to the model of the Primitive Church, a ministerial\r\norder of our own?\" For weeks they had prayed and fasted day and night.\r\nAbout sixty Brethren arrived. The Synod was held in a tanner's cottage,\r\nunder a cedar tree; and the guiding spirit Gregory the Patriarch, for\r\nhis dream was haunting him still. The cottage has long since gone; but\r\nthe tree is living yet.\r\n\r\nThe fateful day arrived. As the morning broke, those sixty men were\r\nall on their knees in prayer. If that prayer had been omitted the whole\r\nproceedings would have been invalid. As the Master, said they, had\r\nprayed on the Mount before he chose His twelve disciples, so they must\r\nspend the night in prayer before they chose the elders of the Church.\r\nAnd strange, indeed, their manner of choosing was. First the Synod\r\nnominated by ballot nine men of blameless life, from whom were to be\r\nchosen, should God so will, the first Pastors of the New Church. Next\r\ntwelve slips of paper were folded and put into a vase. Of these slips\r\nnine were blank, and three were marked \"Jest,\" the Bohemian for \"is.\"\r\nThen a boy named Procop entered the room, drew out nine slips, and\r\nhanded them round to the nine nominated Brethren.\r\n\r\nThere was a hush, a deep hush, in that humble room. All waited for God\r\nto speak. The fate of the infant Church seemed to hang in the balance.\r\nFor the moment the whole great issue at stake depended on the three\r\npapers left in the vase. It had been agreed that the three Brethren who\r\nreceived the three inscribed papers should be ordained to the ministry.\r\nThe situation was curious. As the Brethren rose from their knees that\r\nmorning they were all as sure as men could be that God desired them to\r\nhave Pastors of their own; and yet they deliberately ran the risk that\r\nthe lot might decide against them.[13] What slips were those now lying in\r\nthe vase? Perhaps the three inscribed ones. But it turned out otherwise.\r\nAll three were drawn, and Matthias of Kunwald, Thomas of Prelouic, and\r\nElias of Chrenouic, are known to history as the first three ministers of\r\nthe Brethren's Church. And then Gregory the Patriarch stepped forward,\r\nand announced with trembling voice that these three men were the very\r\nthree that he had seen in his trance in the torture-chamber at Prague.\r\nNot a man in the room was surprised; not a man doubted that here again\r\ntheir prayers had been plainly answered. Together the members of the\r\nSynod arose and saluted the chosen three. Together, next day, they sang\r\nin a hymn written for the occasion:--\r\n\r\n   We needed faithful men, and He\r\n   Granted us such.  Most earnestly,\r\n   We Pray, Lord, let Thy gifts descend,\r\n   That blessing may Thy work attend.[14]\r\nBut the battle was not won even yet. If these three good men, now chosen\r\nby Christ, were to be acknowledged as priests in Bohemia, they must\r\nbe ordained in the orthodox way by a Bishop of pure descent from the\r\nApostles. For this purpose they applied to Stephen, a Bishop of the\r\nWaldenses. He was just the man they needed. He was a man of noble\r\ncharacter. He was a man whose word could be trusted. He had often given\r\nthem information about the Waldensian line of Bishops. He had told them\r\nhow that line ran back to the days of the early Church. He had told them\r\nhow the Waldensian Bishops had kept the ancient faith unsullied, and had\r\nnever broken the law of Christ by uniting with the wicked State. To\r\nthat line of Bishops he himself belonged. He had no connection with the\r\nChurch of Rome, and no connection with the State. What purer orders,\r\nthought the Brethren, could they desire? They believed his statements;\r\nthey trusted his honour; they admired his personal character; and now\r\nthey sent old Michael Bradacius to see him in South Moravia and to lay\r\ntheir case before him. The old Bishop shed tears of joy. \"He laid his\r\nhand on my head,\" says Michael, \"and consecrated me a Bishop.\" Forthwith\r\nthe new Bishop returned to Lhota, ordained the chosen three as Priests,\r\nand consecrated Matthias of Kunwald a Bishop. And thus arose those\r\nEpiscopal Orders which have been maintained in the Church of the\r\nBrethren down to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe goal was reached; the Church was founded; the work of Gregory was\r\ndone. For twenty years he had taught his Brethren to study the mind\r\nof Christ in the Scriptures and to seek the guidance of God in united\r\nprayer, and now he saw them joined as one to face the rising storm.\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth,\" he wrote gladly to King George Podiebrad, \"we have done\r\nwith the Church of Rome.\" As he saw the evening of life draw near, he\r\nurged his Brethren more and more to hold fast the teaching of Peter of\r\nChelcic, and to regulate their daily conduct by the law of Christ; and\r\nby that law of Christ he probably meant the \"Six Commandments\" of\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount.[15] He took these Commandments literally,\r\nand enforced them with a rod of iron. No Brother could be a judge or\r\nmagistrate or councillor. No Brother could take an oath or keep an inn,\r\nor trade beyond the barest needs of life. No noble, unless he laid\r\ndown his rank, could become a Brother at all. No peasant could render\r\nmilitary service or act as a bailiff on a farm. No Brother could ever\r\ndivorce his wife or take an action at law. As long as Gregory remained\r\nin their midst, the Brethren held true to him as their leader. He had\r\nnot, says Gindely, a single trace of personal ambition in his nature;\r\nand, though he might have become a Bishop, he remained a layman to the\r\nend. Full of years he died, and his bones repose in a cleft where tufts\r\nof forget-me-not grow, at Brandeis-on-the-Adler, hard by the Moravian\r\nfrontier {Sept.13th, 1473.}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. -- LUKE OF PRAGUE AND THE HIGH CHURCH REACTION. 1473-1530.\r\n\r\nOf the Brethren who settled in the valley of Kunwald the greater number\r\nwere country peasants and tradesmen of humble rank. But already the\r\nnoble and mighty were pressing in. As the eyes of Gregory closed in\r\ndeath, a new party was rising to power. Already the Brethren were strong\r\nin numbers, and already they were longing to snap the fetters that\r\nGregory had placed upon their feet. From Neustadt in the North to Skutch\r\nin the South, and from Chlumec in the West to Kunwald in the East,\r\nthey now lay thickly sprinkled; and in all the principal towns of that\r\ndistrict, an area of nine hundred square miles, they were winning\r\nrich and influential members. In came the University dons; in came the\r\naldermen and knights. In came, above all, a large colony of Waldenses,\r\nwho had immigrated from the Margravate of Brandenburg {1480.}. Some\r\nsettled at Fulneck, in Moravia, others at Landskron, in Bohemia;\r\nand now, by their own request, they were admitted to the Brethren's\r\nChurch.[16] For a while the Brethren held to the rule that if a nobleman\r\njoined their Church he must first lay down his rank. But now that rule\r\nwas beginning to gall and chafe. They were winning golden opinions on\r\nevery hand; they were becoming known as the best men for positions of\r\ntrust in the State; they were just the men to make the best magistrates\r\nand aldermen; and thus they felt forced by their very virtues to\r\nrenounce the narrow ideas of Peter and to play their part in national\r\nand city life.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, when new ideas were budding, there entered the service\r\nof the Church a young man who is known as Luke of Prague. He was\r\nborn about 1460, was a Bachelor of Prague University, was a well-read\r\ntheological scholar, and for fifty years was the trusted leader of the\r\nBrethren. Forthwith he read the signs of the times, and took the tide\r\nat the flood. In Procop of Neuhaus, another graduate, he found a\r\nwarm supporter. The two scholars led the van of the new movement. The\r\nstruggle was fierce. On the one side was the \"great party\" of culture,\r\nled by Luke of Prague and Procop of Neuhaus; on the other the so-called\r\n\"little party,\" the old-fashioned rigid Radicals, led by two farmers,\r\nAmos and Jacob. \"Ah, Matthias,\" said Gregory the Patriarch, on his\r\ndeath-bed, \"beware of the educated Brethren!\" But, despite this warning,\r\nthe educated Brethren won the day. For once and for ever the Brethren\r\nresolved that the writings of Peter and Gregory should no longer be\r\nregarded as binding. At a Synod held at Reichenau they rejected the\r\nauthority of Peter entirely {1494.}. They agreed that nobles might join\r\nthe Church without laying down their rank; they agreed that if a man's\r\nbusiness were honest he might make profits therein; they agreed that\r\nBrethren might enter the service of the State; and they even agreed that\r\noaths might be taken in cases of special need.[17] And then, next year,\r\nthey made their position still clearer {1495.}. Instead of taking Peter\r\nas their guide, they now took the Bible and the Bible alone. \"We content\r\nourselves,\" they solemnly declared, at another Synod held at Reichenau,\r\n\"with those sacred books which have been accepted from of old by all\r\nChristians, and are found in the Bible\"; and thus, forty years before\r\nJohn Calvin, and eighty years before the Lutherans, they declared that\r\nthe words of Holy Scripture, apart from any disputed interpretation,\r\nshould be their only standard of faith and practice. No longer did they\r\nhonour the memory of Peter; no longer did they appeal to him in their\r\nwritings; no longer, in a word, can we call the Brethren the true\r\nfollowers of Peter of Chelcic. Instead, henceforward, of regarding Peter\r\nas the founder of their Church, they began now to regard themselves\r\nas the disciples of Hus. In days gone by they had spoken of Hus as a\r\n\"causer of war.\" Now they held his name and memory sacred; and from this\r\ntime onward the real followers of Peter were, not the Brethren, but the\r\n\"little party\" led by Amos and Jacob.[18]\r\nBut the scholars led the Brethren further still. If the reader will\r\nkindly refer to the chapter on Peter, he will see that that racy\r\npamphleteer had far more to say about good works than about the merits\r\nof saving faith; but now, after years of keen discussion, Procop of\r\nNeuhaus put to the Council of Elders the momentous question: \"By what\r\nis a man justified?\" The answer given was clear: \"By the merits of Jesus\r\nChrist.\" The great doctrine of justification by grace was taught;\r\nthe old doctrine of justification by works was modified; and thus the\r\nBrethren's Church became the first organized Evangelical Church in\r\nEurope.[19]\r\nAnd Luke designed to make her the strongest, too. His energy never\r\nseemed to flag. As he wished to establish the ministry more firmly,\r\nhe had the number of Bishops enlarged, and became a Bishop himself. He\r\nenlarged the governing Council, with his friend Procop of Neuhaus as\r\nEcclesiastical Judge. He beautified the Church Services, and made the\r\nritual more ornate. He introduced golden communion cups and delicately\r\nembroidered corporals, and some of the Brethren actually thought that\r\nhe was leading them back to Rome. He gave an impulse to Church music,\r\nencouraged reading both in Priests and in people, and made a use of the\r\nprinting press which in those days was astounding. Of the five printing\r\npresses in all Bohemia, three belonged to the Brethren; of sixty printed\r\nworks that appeared between 1500 and 1510, no fewer than fifty were\r\npublished by the Brethren; and of all the scribes of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Luke was the most prolific. He wrote a \"Catechism for\r\nChildren.\" He edited the first Brethren's hymn book (1501), the first\r\nChurch hymnal in history. He published a commentary on the Psalms,\r\nanother on the Gospel of St. John, and another on the eleventh chapter\r\nof 1 Corinthians; he drew up \"Confessions of Faith,\" and sent them to\r\nthe King; and thus, for the first time in the history of Bohemia, he\r\nmade the newly invented press a mighty power in the land.\r\n\r\nAnd even with this the good Bishop was not content {1491.}. If the\r\nBrethren, thought he, were true to their name, they must surely long for\r\nfellowship with others of like mind with themselves. For this purpose\r\nLuke and his friends set off to search for Brethren in other lands. Away\r\nwent one to find the pure Nestorian Church that was said to exist in\r\nIndia, got as far as Antioch, Jerusalem and Egypt, and, being misled\r\nsomehow by a Jew, returned home with the wonderful notion that the River\r\nNile flowed from the Garden of Eden, but with no more knowledge of the\r\nChurch in India than when he first set out. Another explored the South\r\nof Russia, and the third sought Christians in Turkey. And Luke himself\r\nhad little more success. He explored a number of Monasteries in Greece,\r\ncame on to Rome {1498.}, saw the streets of the city littered with\r\ncorpses of men murdered by Cæsar Borgia, picked up some useful\r\ninformation about the private character of the Pope, saw Savonarola put\r\nto death in Florence, fell in with a few Waldenses in the Savoy, and\r\nthen, having sought for pearls in vain, returned home in a state of\r\ndisgust, and convinced that, besides the Brethren, there was not to be\r\nfound a true Christian Church on the face of God's fair earth. He even\r\nfound fault with the Waldenses.\r\n\r\nIt was time, indeed, for Luke to return, for trouble was brewing\r\nat home. For some years there dwelt in the town of Jungbunzlau, the\r\nheadquarters of the Brethren's Church, a smart young man, by name John\r\nLezek. He began life as a brewer's apprentice; he then entered the\r\nservice of a Brother, and learned a good deal of the Brethren's manners\r\nand customs; and now he saw the chance of turning his knowledge to good\r\naccount. If only he told a good tale against the Brethren, he would\r\nbe sure to be a popular hero. For this purpose he visited the parish\r\npriest, and confessed to a number of abominations committed by him while\r\namong the wicked Brethren. The parish priest was delighted; the penitent\r\nwas taken to the Church; and there he told the assembled crowd the story\r\nof his guilty past. Of all the bad men in the country, he said, these\r\nBrethren were the worst. He had even robbed his own father with their\r\nconsent and approval. They blasphemed. They took the Communion bread to\r\ntheir houses, and there hacked it in pieces. They were thieves, and he\r\nhimself had committed many a burglary for them. They murdered men and\r\nkidnapped their wives. They had tried to blow up Rockycana in the Thein\r\nChurch with gunpowder. They swarmed naked up pillars like Adam and Eve,\r\nand handed each other apples. They prepared poisonous drinks, and\r\nput poisonous smelling powders in their letters. They were skilled in\r\nwitchcraft, worshipped Beelzebub, and were wont irreverently to say that\r\nthe way to Hell was paved with the bald heads of priests. As this story\r\nwas both alarming and lively, the parish priest had it taken down,\r\nsealed and signed by witnesses, copied out, and scattered broadcast\r\nthrough the land. In vain John Lezek confessed soon after, when brought\r\nby the Brethren before a Magistrate, that his whole story was a vile\r\ninvention. If a man tells a falsehood and then denies it, he does not\r\nthereby prevent the falsehood from spreading.\r\n\r\nFor now a more powerful foe than Lezek made himself felt in the land. Of\r\nall the Popes that ever donned the tiara, Alexander VI. is said to have\r\npresented the most successful image of the devil.[20] He was the father of\r\nthe prince of poisoners, Caesar Borgia; he was greedy, immoral, fond\r\nof ease and pleasure; he was even said to be a poisoner himself. If\r\na well-known man died suddenly in Rome, the common people took it for\r\ngranted that the Pope had poisoned his supper. For all that he was pious\r\nenough in a way of his own; and now, in his zeal for the Catholic cause,\r\nhe took stern measures against the Church of the Brethren. He had heard\r\nsome terrible tales about them. He heard that Peter's pamphlet, \"The\r\nAntichrist,\"[21] was read all over the country. He heard that the number\r\nof the Brethren now was over 100,000. He resolved to crush them to\r\npowder {Papal Bull, Feb. 4th, 1500.}. He sent an agent, the Dominican,\r\nDr. Henry Institoris, as censor of the press. As soon as Institoris\r\narrived on the scene, he heard, to his horror, that most of the Brethren\r\ncould read; and thereupon he informed the Pope that they had learned\r\nthis art from the devil. He revived the stories of Lezek, the popular\r\nfeeling was fanned to fury, and wire-pullers worked on the tender heart\r\nof the King.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt out and destroy these shameless vagabonds,\" wrote Dr. Augustin\r\nKäsebrot to King Uladislaus, \"they are not even good enough to be burnt\r\nat the stake. They ought to have their bodies torn by wild beasts and\r\ntheir blood licked up by dogs.\" For the last five years there had grown\r\nin the land a small sect known as Amosites. They were followers of old\r\nFarmer Amos; they had once belonged to the Brethren; they had broken off\r\nwhen the scholars had won the day, and now they sent word to the King\r\nto say that the Brethren were planning to defend their cause with the\r\nsword. \"What!\" said the King, \"do they mean to play Ziska? Well, well!\r\nWe know how to stop that!\" They were worse than Turks, he declared; they\r\nbelieved neither in God nor in the Communion; they were a set of lazy\r\nvagabonds. He would soon pay them out for their devilish craft, and\r\nsweep them off the face of the earth. And to this end he summoned the\r\nDiet, and, by the consent of all three Estates, issued the famous Edict\r\nof St. James {July 25th, 1508.}.[22] The decree was sweeping and thorough.\r\nThe meetings of the Brethren, public and private, were forbidden. The\r\nbooks and writings of the Brethren must be burnt. All in Bohemia who\r\nrefused to join the Utraquist or Roman Catholic Church were to be\r\nexpelled from the country; all nobles harbouring Brethren were to be\r\nfined, and all their priests and teachers were to be imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe persecution began. In the village of Kuttenburg lived a brother, by\r\nname Andrew Poliwka. As Kuttenburg was a Romanist village, he fled\r\nfor refuge to the Brethren's settlement at Leitomischl. But his wife\r\nbetrayed him. He returned to the village, and, desiring to please her,\r\nhe attended the parish Church.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was an installation service. As the sermon ended and the\r\nhost was raised, he could hold his tongue no longer. \"Silence, Parson\r\nJacob,\" he cried to the priest, \"you have babbled enough! Mine hour is\r\ncome; I will speak. Dear friends,\" he continued, turning to the people,\r\n\"what are you doing? What are you adoring? An idol made of bread! Oh!\r\nAdore the living God in heaven! He is blessed for evermore!\" The priest\r\nordered him to hold his peace. He only shrieked the louder. He was\r\nseized, his head was dashed against the pillar, and he was dragged\r\nbleeding to prison. Next day he was tried, and asked to explain why he\r\nhad interrupted the service.\r\n\r\n\"Who caused Abram,\" he answered, \"to forsake his idolatry and adore\r\nthe living God? Who induced Daniel to flee from idols?\" In vain was he\r\nstretched upon the rack. No further answer would he give. He was burnt\r\nto death at the stake. As the flames began to lick his face, he prayed\r\naloud: \"Jesus, Thou Son of the living God, have mercy upon me, miserable\r\nsinner.\"\r\n\r\nAt Strakonic dwelt the Brother George Wolinsky, a dependent of Baron\r\nJohn of Rosenberg {1509.}. The Baron was a mighty man. He was Grand\r\nPrior of the Knights of Malta; he was an orthodox subject of the King,\r\nand he determined that on his estate no villainous Picards[23] should\r\nlive. \"See,\" he said one day to George, \"I have made you a servant in\r\nthe Church. You must go to Church. You are a Picard, and I have received\r\ninstructions from Prague that all men on my estate must be either\r\nUtraquists or Catholics.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brother refused; the Baron insisted; and the Prior of Strakonic was\r\nbrought to convert the heretic. \"No one,\" said the Prior, \"should ever\r\nbe tortured into faith. The right method is reasonable instruction,\r\nand innocent blood always cries to Heaven, 'Lord, Lord, when wilt Thou\r\navenge me.'\"\r\n\r\nBut this common sense was lost on the furious Baron. As Brother George\r\nrefused to yield, the Baron cast him into the deepest dungeon of his\r\ncastle. The bread and meat he had secreted in his pockets were removed.\r\nThe door of the dungeon was barred, and all that was left for the\r\ncomfort of his soul was a heap of straw whereon to die and a comb to do\r\nhis hair. For five days he lay in the dark, and then the Baron came to\r\nsee him. The prisoner was almost dead. His teeth were closed; his mouth\r\nwas rigid; the last spark of life was feebly glimmering. The Baron was\r\naghast. The mouth was forced open, hot soup was poured in, the prisoner\r\nrevived, and the Baron burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"I am glad he is living\"; and allowed George to\r\nreturn to his Brethren.\r\n\r\nAmid scenes like this, Bishop Luke was a tower of strength to his\r\nBrethren. For six years the manses were closed, the Churches empty, the\r\nPastors homeless, the people scattered; and the Bishop hurried from\r\nglen to glen, held services in the woods and gorges, sent letters to the\r\nparishes he could not visit, and pleaded the cause of his Brethren in\r\nwoe in letter after letter to the King. As the storm of persecution\r\nraged, he found time to write a stirring treatise, entitled, \"The\r\nRenewal of the Church,\" and thus by pen and by cheery word he revived\r\nthe flagging hope of all.\r\n\r\nFor a while the Brethren were robbed of this morsel of comfort. As the\r\nBishop was hastening on a pastoral visit, he was captured by Peter von\r\nSuda, the brigand, \"the prince and master of all thieves,\" was loaded\r\nwith chains, cast into a dungeon, and threatened with torture and the\r\nstake. At that moment destruction complete and final seemed to threaten\r\nthe Brethren. Never had the billows rolled so high; never had the\r\nbreakers roared so loud; and bitterly the hiding Brethren complained\r\nthat their leaders had steered them on the rocks.\r\n\r\nYet sunshine gleamed amid the gathering clouds. For some time there had\r\nbeen spreading among the common people a conviction that the Brethren\r\nwere under the special protection of God, and that any man who tried\r\nto harm them would come to a tragic end. It was just while the Brethren\r\nwere sunk in despair that several of their enemies suddenly died,\r\nand people said that God Himself had struck a blow for the persecuted\r\n\"Pitmen.\" The great Dr. Augustin, their fiercest foe, fell dead from his\r\nchair at dinner. Baron Colditz, the Chancellor, fell ill of a carbuncle\r\nin his foot, and died. Baron Henry von Neuhaus, who had boasted to the\r\nKing how many Brethren he had starved to death, went driving in his\r\nsleigh, was upset, and was skewered on his own hunting knife. Baron Puta\r\nvon Swihow was found dead in his cellar. Bishop John of Grosswardein\r\nfell from his carriage, was caught on a sharp nail, had his bowels torn\r\nout, and miserably perished. And the people, struck with awe, exclaimed:\r\n\"Let him that is tired of life persecute the Brethren, for he is sure\r\nnot to live another year.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Brethren possessed their souls in patience till the persecution\r\nended. The King of Bohemia, Uladislaus II., died {March 13th, 1516.}.\r\nHis successor was only a boy. The Utraquists and Catholics began to\r\nquarrel with each other. The robber, von Suda, set Luke at liberty. The\r\ngreat Bishop became chief Elder of the Church. The whole land was soon\r\nin a state of disorder. The barons and knights were fighting each other,\r\nand, in the general stress and storm, the quiet Brethren were almost\r\nforgotten and allowed to live in peace.\r\n\r\nAnd just at this juncture came news from afar that seemed to the\r\nBrethren like glad tidings from Heaven {1517.}. No longer were the\r\nBrethren to be alone, no longer to be a solitary voice crying in the\r\nwilderness. As the Brethren returned from the woods and mountains, and\r\nworshipped once again by the light of day, they heard, with amazement\r\nand joy, how Martin Luther, on Hallows Eve, had pinned his famous\r\nninety-five Theses to the Church door at Wittenberg. The excitement in\r\nBohemia was intense. For a while it seemed as though Martin Luther would\r\nwield as great an influence there as ever he had in Germany. For a while\r\nthe Utraquist priests themselves, like Rockycana of yore, thundered in\r\na hundred pulpits against the Church of Rome; and Luther, taking the\r\nkeenest interest in the growing movement, wrote a letter to the Bohemian\r\nDiet, and urged the ecclesiastical leaders in Prague to break the last\r\nfetters that bound them to Rome.\r\n\r\nFor a while his agent, Gallus Cahera, a butcher's son, who had studied\r\nat Wittenberg, was actually pastor of the Thein Church {1523-9.},\r\nreferred in his sermons to the \"celebrated Dr. Martin Luther,\" and\r\nopenly urged the people to pray for that \"great man of God.\" For a while\r\neven a preacher of the Brethren, named Martin, was allowed to stand\r\nwhere Hus had stood, and preach in the Bethlehem Church. For a while, in\r\na word, it seemed to the Brethren that the Reformation now spreading in\r\nGermany would conquer Bohemia at a rush. The great Luther was loved by\r\nmany classes. He was loved by the Utraquists because he had burned the\r\nPope's Bull. He was loved by the young because he favoured learning. He\r\nwas loved by the Brethren because he upheld the Bible as the standard\r\nof faith {1522.}. As soon as Luther had left the Wartburg, the Brethren\r\nboldly held out to him the right hand of fellowship; sent two German\r\nBrethren, John Horn and Michael Weiss, to see him; presented him with a\r\ncopy of their Confession and Catechism; began a friendly correspondence\r\non various points of doctrine and discipline, and thus opened their\r\nhearts to hear with respect what the great Reformer had to say.\r\n\r\nAmid these bright prospects Luke of Prague breathed his last {Dec. 11th,\r\n1528.}. As Gregory the Patriarch had gone to his rest when a new party\r\nwas rising among the Brethren, so Luke of Prague crossed the cold river\r\nof death when new ideas from Germany were stirring the hearts of his\r\nfriends. He was never quite easy in his mind about Martin Luther.\r\nHe still believed in the Seven Sacraments. He still believed in the\r\nBrethren's system of stern moral discipline. He still believed, for\r\npractical reasons, in the celibacy of the clergy. \"This eating,\" he\r\nwrote, \"this drinking, this self-indulgence, this marrying, this living\r\nto the world--what a poor preparation it is for men who are leaving\r\nBabylon. If a man does this he is yoking himself with strangers.\r\nMarriage never made anyone holy yet. It is a hindrance to the higher\r\nlife, and causes endless trouble.\" Above all, he objected to Luther's\r\nway of teaching the great doctrine of justification by faith.\r\n\r\n\"Never, never,\" he said, in a letter to Luther, \"can you ascribe a man's\r\nsalvation to faith alone. The Scriptures are against you. You think that\r\nin this you are doing a good work, but you are really fighting against\r\nChrist Himself and clinging to an error.\" He regarded Luther's teaching\r\nas extreme and one-sided. He was shocked by what he heard of the jovial\r\nlife led by Luther's students at Wittenberg, and could never understand\r\nhow a rollicking youth could be a preparation for a holy ministry.\r\nAs Gregory the Patriarch had warned Matthias against \"the learned\r\nBrethren,\" so Luke, in his turn, now warned the Brethren against\r\nthe loose lives of Luther's merry-hearted students; and, in order\r\nto preserve the Brethren's discipline, he now issued a comprehensive\r\ntreatise, divided into two parts--the first entitled \"Instructions\r\nfor Priests,\" and the second \"Instructions and Admonitions for all\r\noccupations, all ages in life, all ranks and all sorts of characters.\"\r\nAs he lay on his death-bed at Jungbunzlau, his heart was stirred by\r\nmingled feelings. There was land in sight--ah, yes!--but what grew upon\r\nthe enchanting island? He would rather see his Church alone and pure\r\nthan swept away in the Protestant current. Happy was he in the day of\r\nhis death. So far he had steered the Church safely. He must now resign\r\nhis post to another pilot who knew well the coming waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. -- THE BRETHREN AT HOME.\r\n\r\nAs we have now arrived at that bend in the lane, when the Brethren, no\r\nlonger marching alone, became a regiment in the conquering Protestant\r\narmy, it will be convenient to halt in our story and look at the\r\nBrethren a little more closely--at their homes, their trades, their\r\nprinciples, their doctrines, their forms of service, and their life from\r\nday to day. After all, what were these Brethren, and how did they live?\r\n\r\nThey called themselves Jednota Bratrska--i.e., the Church of the\r\nBrethren. As this word \"Jednota\" means union, and is used in this sense\r\nin Bohemia at the present day, it is possible that the reader may think\r\nthat instead of calling the Brethren a Church, we ought rather to call\r\nthem the Union or Unity of the Brethren. If he does, however, he will\r\nbe mistaken. We have no right to call the Brethren a mere Brotherhood\r\nor Unity. They regarded themselves as a true apostolic Church. They\r\nbelieved that their episcopal orders were valid. They called the Church\r\nof Rome a Jednota;[24] they called the Lutheran Church a Jednota;[25] they\r\ncalled themselves a Jednota; and, therefore, if the word Jednota means\r\nChurch when applied to Lutherans and Roman Catholics, it must also mean\r\nChurch when applied to the Bohemian Brethren. It is not correct to\r\ncall them the Unitas Fratrum. The term is misleading. It suggests a\r\nBrotherhood rather than an organized Church. We have no right to call\r\nthem a sect; the term is a needless insult to their memory.[26] As the\r\nBrethren settled in the Valley of Kunwald, the great object which they\r\nset before them was to recall to vigorous life the true Catholic Church\r\nof the Apostles; and as soon as they were challenged by their enemies to\r\njustify their existence, they replied in good set terms.\r\n\r\n\"Above all things,\" declared the Brethren, at a Synod held in 1464, \"we\r\nare one in this purpose. We hold fast the faith of the Lord Christ. We\r\nwill abide in the righteousness and love of God. We will trust in the\r\nliving God. We will do good works. We will serve each other in the\r\nspirit of love. We will lead a virtuous, humble, gentle, sober, patient\r\nand pure life; and thereby shall we know that we hold the faith in\r\ntruth, and that a home is prepared for us in heaven. We will show\r\nobedience to one another, as the Holy Scriptures command. We will take\r\nfrom each other instruction, reproof and punishment, and thus shall we\r\nkeep the covenant established by God through the Lord Christ.\"[27] To\r\nthis purpose the Brethren held firm. In every detail of their lives--in\r\nbusiness, in pleasure, in civil duties--they took the Sermon on the\r\nMount as the lamp unto their feet. From the child to the old man, from\r\nthe serf to the lord, from the acoluth to the bishop, the same strict\r\nlaw held good. What made the Brethren's Church shine so brightly in\r\nBohemia before Luther's days was not their doctrine, but their lives;\r\nnot their theory, but their practice; not their opinions, but their\r\ndiscipline. Without that discipline they would have been a shell without\r\na kernel. It called forth the admiration of Calvin, and drove Luther to\r\ndespair. It was, in truth, the jewel of the Church, her charm against\r\nfoes within and without; and so great a part did it play in their lives\r\nthat in later years they were known to some as \"Brethren of the Law of\r\nChrist.\"\r\n\r\nNo portion of the Church was more carefully watched than the ministers.\r\nAs the chief object which the Brethren set before them was obedience\r\nto the Law of Christ, it followed, as the night the day, that the\r\nchief quality required in a minister was not theological learning,\r\nbut personal character. When a man came forward as a candidate for\r\nthe ministry he knew that he would have to stand a most searching\r\nexamination. His character and conduct were thoroughly sifted. He must\r\nhave a working knowledge of the Bible, a blameless record, and a\r\nliving faith in God. For classical learning the Brethren had an honest\r\ncontempt. It smacked too much of Rome and monkery. As long as the\r\ncandidate was a holy man, and could teach the people the plain truths of\r\nthe Christian faith, they felt that nothing more was required, and did\r\nnot expect him to know Greek and Hebrew. In vain Luther, in a friendly\r\nletter, urged them to cultivate more knowledge. \"We have no need,\" they\r\nreplied, \"of teachers who understand other tongues, such as Greek and\r\nHebrew. It is not our custom to appoint ministers who have been trained\r\nat advanced schools in languages and fine arts. We prefer Bohemians\r\nand Germans who have come to a knowledge of the truth through personal\r\nexperience and practical service, and who are therefore qualified to\r\nimpart to others the piety they have first acquired themselves. And here\r\nwe are true to the law of God and the practice of the early Church.\"[28] Instead of regarding learning as an aid to faith, they regarded it as\r\nan hindrance and a snare. It led, they declared, to wordy battles, to\r\nquarrels, to splits, to uncertainties, to doubts, to corruptions. As\r\nlong, they said, as the ministers of the Church of Christ were simple\r\nand unlettered men, so long was the Church a united body of believers;\r\nbut as soon as the parsons began to be scholars, all sorts of evils\r\narose. What good, they argued, had learning done in the past? It had\r\ncaused the translation of the Bible into Latin, and had thus hidden\r\nits truths from the common people. \"And therefore,\" they insisted, \"we\r\ndespise the learning of tongues.\"\r\n\r\nFor this narrow attitude they had also another reason. In order to be\r\ntrue to the practice of the early Christian Church, they laid down\r\nthe strict rule that all ministers should earn their living by manual\r\nlabour; and the result was that even if a minister wished to study\r\nhe could not find time to do so. For his work as a minister he never\r\nreceived a penny. If a man among the Brethren entered the ministry, he\r\ndid so for the pure love of the work. He had no chance of becoming\r\nrich. He was not allowed to engage in a business that brought in large\r\nprofits. If he earned any more in the sweat of his brow than he needed\r\nto make ends meet, he was compelled to hand the surplus over to the\r\ngeneral funds of the Church; and if some one kindly left him some money,\r\nthat money was treated in the same way. He was to be as moderate as\r\npossible in eating and drinking; he was to avoid all gaudy show in dress\r\nand house; he was not to go to fairs and banquets; and, above all, he\r\nwas not to marry except with the consent and approval of the Elders. Of\r\nmarriage the Brethren had rather a poor opinion. They clung still to\r\nthe old Catholic view that it was less holy than celibacy. \"It is,\" they\r\nsaid, \"a good thing if two people find that they cannot live continent\r\nwithout it.\" If a minister married he was not regarded with favour; he\r\nwas supposed to have been guilty of a fleshly weakness; and it is rather\r\nsarcastically recorded in the old \"Book of the Dead\" that in every\r\ncase in which a minister failed in his duties, or was convicted of\r\nimmorality, the culprit was a married man.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, for all his humble style, the minister was held in honour.\r\nAs the solemn time of ordination drew near there were consultations of\r\nministers with closed doors, and days set apart for fasting and prayer\r\nthroughout the whole Church. His duties were many and various. He was\r\ncommonly spoken of, not as a priest, but as the \"servant\" of the\r\nChurch. He was not a priest in the Romish sense of the word. He had no\r\ndistinctive sacerdotal powers. He had no more power to consecrate the\r\nSacrament than any godly layman. Of priests as a separate class the\r\nBrethren knew nothing. All true believers in Christ, said they, were\r\npriests. We can see this from one of their regulations. As the times\r\nwere stormy, and persecution might break out at any moment, the Brethren\r\n(at a Synod in 1504) laid down the rule that when their meetings at\r\nChurch were forbidden they should be held in private houses, and then,\r\nif a minister was not available, any godly layman was authorised to\r\nconduct the Holy Communion.[29] And thus the minister was simply a\r\nuseful \"servant.\" He gave instruction in Christian doctrine. He heard\r\nconfessions. He expelled sinners. He welcomed penitents. He administered\r\nthe Sacraments. He trained theological students. If he had the needful\r\ngift, he preached; if not, he read printed sermons. He was not a ruler\r\nlording it over the flock; he was rather a \"servant\" bound by rigid\r\nrules. He was not allowed to select his own topics for sermons; he had\r\nto preach from the Scripture lesson appointed for the day. He was bound\r\nto visit every member of his congregation at least once a quarter; he\r\nwas bound to undertake any journey or mission, however dangerous, at the\r\ncommand of the Elders; and he was bound, for a fairly obvious reason, to\r\ntake a companion with him when he called at the houses of the sick. If\r\nhe went alone he might practise as a doctor, and give dangerous medical\r\nadvice; and that, said the Brethren, was not his proper business. He was\r\nnot allowed to visit single women or widows. If he did, there might be\r\nscandals about him, as there were about the Catholic priests. For\r\nthe spiritual needs of all unmarried women the Brethren made special\r\nprovision. They were visited by a special \"Committee of Women,\" and the\r\nminister was not allowed to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe good man did not even possess a home of his own. Instead of living\r\nin a private manse he occupied a set of rooms in a large building known\r\nas the Brethren's House; and the minister, as the name implies, was\r\nnot the only Brother in it. \"As Eli had trained Samuel, as Elijah had\r\ntrained Elisha, as Christ had trained His disciples, as St. Paul trained\r\nTimothy and Titus,\" so a minister of the Brethren had young men under\r\nhis charge. There, under the minister's eye, the candidates for service\r\nin the Church were trained. Neither now nor at any period of their\r\nhistory had the Bohemian Brethren any theological colleges. If a boy\r\ndesired to become a minister he entered the Brethren's House at an early\r\nage, and was there taught a useful trade. Let us look at the inmates of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nFirst in order, next to the Priest himself, were the Deacons. They\r\noccupied a double position. They were in the first stage of priesthood,\r\nand in the last stage of preparation for it. Their duties were manifold.\r\nThey supplied the out-preaching places. They repeated the pastor's\r\nsermon to those who had not been able to attend the Sunday service.\r\nThey assisted at the Holy Communion in the distribution of the bread\r\nand wine. They preached now and then in the village Church to give their\r\nsuperior an opportunity for criticism and correction. They managed\r\nthe domestic affairs of the house. They acted as sacristans or\r\nchurchwardens. They assisted in the distribution of alms, and took their\r\nshare with the minister in manual labour; and then, in the intervals\r\nbetween these trifling duties, they devoted their time to Bible study\r\nand preparation for the ministry proper. No wonder they never became\r\nvery scholarly pundits; and no wonder that when they went off to preach\r\ntheir sermons had first to be submitted to the head of the house for\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nNext to the Deacons came the Acoluths, young men or boys living in the\r\nsame building and preparing to be Deacons. They were trained by the\r\nminister, very often from childhood upwards. They rang the bell and\r\nlighted the candles in the Church, helped the Deacons in household\r\narrangements, and took turns in conducting the household worship.\r\nOccasionally they were allowed to deliver a short address in the Church,\r\nand the congregation \"listened with kindly forbearance.\" When they were\r\naccepted by the Synod as Acoluths they generally received some Biblical\r\nname, which was intended to express some feature in the character. It is\r\nthus that we account for such names as Jacob Bilek and Amos Comenius.\r\n\r\nInside this busy industrial hive the rules were rigid. The whole place\r\nwas like a boarding-school or college. At the sound of a bell all rose,\r\nand then came united prayer and Scripture reading; an hour later a\r\nservice, and then morning study. As the afternoon was not considered\r\na good time for brain work, the Brethren employed it in manual labour,\r\nsuch as weaving, gardening and tailoring. In the evening there was\r\nsacred music and singing. At meal times the Acoluths recited passages of\r\nScripture, or read discourses, or took part in theological discussions.\r\n\r\nNo one could leave the house without the pastor's permission, and\r\nthe pastor himself could not leave his parish without the Bishop's\r\npermission. If he travelled at all he did so on official business, and\r\nthen he lodged at other Brethren's Houses, when the Acoluths washed his\r\nfeet and attended to his personal comforts.\r\n\r\nThe Brethren's rules struck deeper still. As the Brethren despised\r\nUniversity education, it is natural to draw the plain conclusion that\r\namong them the common people were the most benighted and ignorant in the\r\nland. The very opposite was the case. Among them the common people were\r\nthe most enlightened in the country. Of the Bohemian people, in those\r\ndays, there were few who could read or write; of the Brethren there was\r\nscarcely one who could not. If the Brethren taught the people nothing\r\nelse, they at least taught them to read their native tongue; and their\r\nobject in this was to spread the knowledge of the Bible, and thus make\r\nthe people good Protestants. But in those days a man who could read was\r\nregarded as a prodigy of learning. The result was widespread alarm. As\r\nthe report gained ground that among the Brethren the humblest people\r\ncould read as well as the priest, the good folk in Bohemia felt\r\ncompelled to concoct some explanation, and the only explanation they\r\ncould imagine was that the Brethren had the special assistance of the\r\ndevil.[30] If a man, said they, joined the ranks of the Brethren, the\r\ndevil immediately taught him the art of reading, and if, on the other\r\nhand, he deserted the Brethren, the devil promptly robbed him of the\r\npower, and reduced him again to a wholesome benighted condition. \"Is\r\nit really true,\" said Baron Rosenberg to his dependant George Wolinsky,\r\n\"that the devil teaches all who become Picards to read, and that if a\r\npeasant leaves the Brethren he is able to read no longer?\"\r\n\r\nIn this instance, however, the devil was innocent. The real culprit was\r\nBishop Luke of Prague. Of all the services rendered by Luke to the cause\r\nof popular education and moral and spiritual instruction, the greatest\r\nwas his publication of his \"Catechism for Children,\" commonly known\r\nas \"The Children's Questions.\" It was a masterly and comprehensive\r\ntreatise. It was published first, of course, in the Bohemian language\r\n{1502.}. It was published again in a German edition for the benefit of\r\nthe German members of the Church {1522.}. It was published again, with\r\nsome alterations, by a Lutheran at Magdeburg {1524.}. It was published\r\nagain, with more alterations, by another Lutheran, at Wittenberg\r\n{1525.}. It was published again, in abridged form, at Zürich, and was\r\nrecommended as a manual of instruction for the children at St. Gallen\r\n{1527.}. And thus it exercised a profound influence on the whole course\r\nof the Reformation, both in Germany and in Switzerland. For us, however,\r\nthe point of interest is its influence in Bohemia and Moravia. It was\r\nnot a book for the priests. It was a book for the fathers of families.\r\nIt was a book found in every Brother's home. It was the children's\r\n\"Reader.\" As the boys and girls grew up in the Brethren's Church, they\r\nlearned to read, not in national schools, but in their own homes; and\r\nthus the Brethren did for the children what ought to have been done by\r\nthe State. Among them the duties of a father were clearly defined. He\r\nwas both a schoolmaster and a religious instructor. He was the priest in\r\nhis own family. He was to bring his children up in the Christian faith.\r\nHe was not to allow them to roam at pleasure, or play with the wicked\r\nchildren of the world. He was to see that they were devout at prayers,\r\nrespectful in speech, and noble and upright in conduct. He was not to\r\nallow brothers and sisters to sleep in the same room, or boys and girls\r\nto roam the daisied fields together. He was not to strike his children\r\nwith a stick or with his fists. If he struck them at all, he must do so\r\nwith a cane. Above all, he had to teach his children the Catechism. They\r\nwere taught by their parents until they were twelve years old; they were\r\nthen taken in hand by their sponsors; and thus they were prepared for\r\nConfirmation, not as in the Anglican Church, by a clergyman only, but\r\npartly by their own parents and friends.\r\n\r\nThe Brethren's rules struck deeper still. For law and order the Brethren\r\nhad a passion. Each congregation was divided into three classes:\r\nthe Beginners, those who were learning the \"Questions\" and the first\r\nelements of religion; the Proficients, the steady members of the Church;\r\nand the Perfect, those so established in faith, hope and love as to\r\nbe able to enlighten others. For each class a separate Catechism was\r\nprepared. At the head, too, of each congregation was a body of civil\r\nElders. They were elected by the congregation from the Perfect. They\r\nassisted the pastor in his parochial duties. They looked after his\r\nsupport in case he were in special need. They acted as poor-law\r\nguardians, lawyers, magistrates and umpires, and thus they tried to\r\nkeep the people at peace and prevent them from going to law. Every three\r\nmonths they visited the houses of the Brethren, and inquired whether\r\nbusiness were honestly conducted, whether family worship were held,\r\nwhether the children were properly trained. For example, it was one\r\nof the duties of a father to talk with his children at the Sunday\r\ndinner-table on what they had heard at the morning service; and when\r\nthe Elder paid his quarterly visit he soon discovered, by examining the\r\nchildren, how far this duty had been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe Brethren's rules struck deeper still. For the labourer in the field,\r\nfor the artizan in the workshop, for the tradesman with his wares, for\r\nthe baron and his tenants, for the master and his servants, there were\r\nlaws and codes to suit each case, and make every trade and walk in life\r\nserve in some way to the glory of God. Among the Brethren all work was\r\nsacred. If a man was not able to show that his trade was according to\r\nthe law of Christ and of direct service to His holy cause, he was not\r\nallowed to carry it on at all. He must either change his calling or\r\nleave the Church. In the Brethren's Church there were no dice makers, no\r\nactors, no painters, no professional musicians, no wizards or seers, no\r\nalchemists, no astrologers, no courtezans or panderers. The whole\r\ntone was stern and puritanic. For art, for music, for letters and for\r\npleasure the Brethren had only contempt, and the fathers were warned\r\nagainst staying out at night and frequenting the card-room and the\r\nliquor-saloon. And yet, withal, these stern Brethren were kind and\r\ntender-hearted. If the accounts handed down are to be believed, the\r\nvillages where the Brethren settled were the homes of happiness and\r\npeace. As the Brethren had no definite social policy, they did not, of\r\ncourse, make any attempt to break down the distinctions of rank; and\r\nyet, in their own way, they endeavoured to teach all classes to respect\r\neach other. They enjoined the barons to allow their servants to worship\r\nwith them round the family altar. They urged the rich to spend their\r\nmoney on the poor instead of on dainties and fine clothes. They\r\nforbade the poor to wear silk, urged them to be patient, cheerful and\r\nindustrious, and reminded them that in the better land their troubles\r\nwould vanish like dew before the rising sun. For the poorest of all,\r\nthose in actual need, they had special collections several times a year.\r\nThe fund was called the Korbona, and was managed by three officials. The\r\nfirst kept the box, the second the key, the third the accounts. And the\r\nrich and poor had all to bow to the same system of discipline. There\r\nwere three degrees of punishment. For the first offence the sinner was\r\nprivately admonished. For the second he was rebuked before the Elders,\r\nand excluded from the Holy Communion until he repented. For the third he\r\nwas denounced in the Church before the whole congregation, and the\r\nloud \"Amen\" of the assembled members proclaimed his banishment from the\r\nBrethren's Church.\r\n\r\nThe system of government was Presbyterian. At the head of the whole\r\nBrethren's Church was a board, called the \"Inner Council,\" elected by\r\nthe Synod. Next came the Bishops, elected also by the Synod. The supreme\r\nauthority was this General Synod. It consisted of all the ministers. As\r\nlong as the Inner Council held office they were, of course, empowered to\r\nenforce their will; but the final court of appeal was the Synod, and by\r\nthe Synod all questions of doctrine and policy were settled.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine was simple and broad. As the Brethren never had a formal\r\ncreed, and never used their \"Confessions of Faith\" as tests, it may seem\r\na rather vain endeavour to inquire too closely into their theological\r\nbeliefs. And yet, on the other hand, we know enough to enable the\r\nhistorian to paint a life-like picture. For us the important question\r\nis, what did the Brethren teach their children? If we know what the\r\nBrethren taught their children we know what they valued most; and this\r\nwe have set before us in the Catechism drawn up by Luke of Prague and\r\nused as an authorised manual of instruction in the private homes of the\r\nBrethren. It contained no fewer than seventy-six questions. The answers\r\nare remarkably full, and therefore we may safely conclude that, though\r\nit was not an exhaustive treatise, it gives us a wonderfully clear idea\r\nof the doctrines which the Brethren prized most highly. It is remarkable\r\nboth for what it contains and for what it does not contain. It has no\r\ndistinct and definite reference to St. Paul's doctrine of justification\r\nby faith. It is Johannine rather than Pauline in its tone. It contains\r\na great deal of the teaching of Christ and a very little of the teaching\r\nof St. Paul. It has more to say about the Sermon on the Mount than about\r\nany system of dogmatic theology. For one sentence out of St. Paul's\r\nEpistles it has ten out of the Gospel of St. Matthew. As we read the\r\nanswers in this popular treatise, we are able to see in what way\r\nthe Brethren differed from the Lutheran Protestants in Germany. They\r\napproached the whole subject of Christian life from a different point\r\nof view. They were less dogmatic, less theological, less concerned about\r\naccurate definition, and they used their theological terms in a broader\r\nand freer way. For example, take their definition of faith. We all know\r\nthe definition given by Luther. \"There are,\" said Luther, \"two kinds of\r\nbelieving: first, a believing about God which means that I believe that\r\nwhat is said of God is true. This faith is rather a form of knowledge\r\nthan a faith. There is, secondly, a believing in God which means that I\r\nput my trust in Him, give myself up to thinking that I can have dealings\r\nwith Him, and believe without any doubt that He will be and do to me\r\naccording to the things said of Him. Such faith, which throws itself\r\nupon God, whether in life or in death, alone makes a Christian man.\" But\r\nthe Brethren gave the word faith a richer meaning. They made it signify\r\nmore than trust in God. They made it include both hope and love. They\r\nmade it include obedience to the Law of Christ.\r\n\r\n\"What is faith in the Lord God?\" was one question in the Catechism.\r\n\r\n\"It is to know God, to know His word; above all, to love Him, to do His\r\ncommandments, and to submit to His will.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is faith in Christ?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to listen to His word, to know Him, to honour Him, to love Him\r\nand to join the company of His followers.\"[31]\r\nAnd this is the tone all through the Catechism and in all the early\r\nwritings of the Brethren. As a ship, said Luke, is not made of one\r\nplank, so a Christian cannot live on one religious doctrine. The\r\nBrethren had no pet doctrines whatever. They had none of the distinctive\r\nmarks of a sect. They taught their children the Apostles' Creed, the\r\nTen Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Eight Beatitudes, and the\r\n\"Six Commandments\" of the Sermon on the Mount. They taught the orthodox\r\nCatholic doctrines of the Holy Trinity and the Virgin Birth. They held,\r\nthey said, the universal Christian faith. They enjoined the children to\r\nhonour, but not worship, the Virgin Mary and the Saints, and they\r\nwarned them against the adoration of pictures. If the Brethren had any\r\npeculiarity at all, it was not any distinctive doctrine, but rather\r\ntheir insistence on the practical duties of the believer. With Luther,\r\nSt. Paul's theology was foremost; with the Brethren (though not denied)\r\nit fell into the background. With Luther the favourite court of appeal\r\nwas St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians; with the Brethren it was rather\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount and the tender Epistles of St. John.\r\n\r\nAgain the Brethren differed from Luther in their doctrine of the Lord's\r\nSupper. As this subject was then the fruitful source of much discussion\r\nand bloodshed, the Brethren at first endeavoured to avoid the issue at\r\nstake by siding with neither of the two great parties and falling back\r\non the simple words of Scripture. \"Some say,\" they said, \"it is only a\r\nmemorial feast, that Christ simply gave the bread as a memorial. Others\r\nsay that the bread is really the body of Christ, who is seated at the\r\nright hand of God. We reject both these views; they were not taught\r\nby Christ Himself. And if anyone asks us to say in what way Christ is\r\npresent in the sacrament, we reply that we have nothing to say on the\r\nsubject. We simply believe what He Himself said, and enjoy what He has\r\ngiven.\"[32]\r\nBut this attitude could not last for ever. As the storms of persecution\r\nraged against them, the Brethren grew more and more radical in their\r\nviews. They denied the doctrine of Transubstantiation; they denied also\r\nthe Lutheran doctrine of Consubstantiation; they denied that the words\r\nin St. John's Gospel about eating the flesh and drinking the blood\r\nof Christ had any reference to the Lord's Supper. They took the whole\r\npassage in a purely spiritual sense. If those words, said Bishop Luke,\r\nreferred to the Sacrament, then all Catholics, except the priests, would\r\nbe lost; for Catholics only ate the flesh and did not drink the blood,\r\nand could, therefore, not possess eternal life. They denied, in a\r\nword, that the Holy Communion had any value apart from the faith of the\r\nbeliever; they denounced the adoration of the host as idolatry; and thus\r\nthey adopted much the same position as Wycliffe in England nearly two\r\nhundred years before. The Lord Christ, they said, had three modes\r\nof existence. He was present bodily at the right hand of God; He was\r\npresent spiritually in the heart of every believer; He was present\r\nsacramentally, but not personally, in the bread and wine; and,\r\ntherefore, when the believer knelt in prayer, he must kneel, not to the\r\nbread and wine, but only to the exalted Lord in Heaven.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Brethren differed from Luther in their doctrine of Infant\r\nBaptism. If a child, said Luther, was prayed for by the Church, he was\r\nthereby cleansed from his unbelief, delivered from the power of the\r\ndevil, and endowed with faith; and therefore the child was baptised as a\r\nbeliever.[33] The Brethren rejected this teaching. They called it Romish.\r\nThey held that no child could be a believer until he had been instructed\r\nin the faith. They had no belief in baptismal regeneration. With them\r\nInfant Baptism had quite a different meaning. It was simply the outward\r\nand visible sign of admission to the Church. As soon as the child had\r\nbeen baptised, he belonged to the class of the Beginners, and then, when\r\nhe was twelve years old, he was taken by his godfather to the minister,\r\nexamined in his \"Questions,\" and asked if he would hold true to the\r\nfaith he had been taught. If he said \"Yes!\" the minister struck him\r\nin the face, to teach him that he would have to suffer for Christ;\r\nand then, after further instruction, he was confirmed by the minister,\r\nadmitted to the communion, and entered the ranks of the Proficient.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the life, and such were the views, of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren. What sort of picture does all this bring before us? It is the\r\npicture of a body of earnest men, united, not by a common creed, but\r\nrather by a common devotion to Christ, a common reverence for Holy\r\nScripture, and a common desire to revive the customs of the early\r\nChristian Church.[34] In some of their views they were narrow, in others\r\nremarkably broad. In some points they had still much to learn; in others\r\nthey were far in advance of their times, and anticipated the charitable\r\nteaching of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. -- JOHN AUGUSTA AND HIS POLICY, 1531-1548.\r\n\r\nAs the great Bishop Luke lay dying at Jungbunzlau, there was rising to\r\nfame among the Brethren the most brilliant and powerful leader they had\r\never known. Again we turn to the old Thein Church; again the preacher is\r\ndenouncing the priests; and again in the pew is an eager listener with\r\nsoul aflame with zeal. His name was John Augusta. He was born, in 1500,\r\nat Prague. His father was a hatter, and in all probability he learned\r\nthe trade himself. He was brought up in the Utraquist Faith; he took\r\nthe sacrament every Sunday in the famous old Thein Church; and there he\r\nheard the preacher declare that the priests in Prague cared for nothing\r\nbut comfort, and that the average Christians of the day were no better\r\nthan crack-brained heathen sprinkled with holy water. The young man was\r\nstaggered; he consulted other priests, and the others told him the same\r\ndismal tale. One lent him a pamphlet, entitled \"The Antichrist\"; another\r\nlent him a treatise by Hus; and a third said solemnly: \"My son, I see\r\nthat God has more in store for you than I can understand.\" But the\r\nstrangest event of all was still to come. As he rode one day in a\r\ncovered waggon with two priests of high rank, it so happened that one of\r\nthem turned to Augusta and urged him to leave the Utraquist Church and\r\njoin the ranks of the Brethren at Jungbunzlau. Augusta was horrified.\r\n\r\nAgain he consulted the learned priest; again he received the same\r\nstrange counsel; and one day the priest ran after him, called him back,\r\nand said: \"Listen, dear brother! I beseech you, leave us. You will get\r\nno good among us. Go to the Brethren at Bunzlau, and there your soul\r\nwill find rest.\" Augusta was shocked beyond measure. He hated the\r\nBrethren, regarded them as beasts, and had often warned others against\r\nthem. But now he went to see them himself, and found to his joy that\r\nthey followed the Scriptures, obeyed the Gospel and enforced their\r\nrules without respect of persons. For a while he was in a quandary.\r\nHis conscience drew him to the Brethren, his honour held him to the\r\nUtraquists, and finally his own father confessor settled the question\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend,\" said the holy man, \"entrust your soul to the Brethren.\r\nNever mind if some of them are hypocrites, who do not obey their own\r\nrules. It is your business to obey the rules yourself. What more do you\r\nwant? If you return to us in Prague, you will meet with none but sinners\r\nand sodomites.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, by the advice of Utraquist priests, this ardent young man joined\r\nthe ranks of the Brethren, was probably trained in the Brethren's House\r\nat Jungbunzlau, and was soon ordained as a minister. Forthwith he rose\r\nto fame and power in the pulpit. His manner was dignified and noble.\r\nHis brow was lofty, his eye flashing, his bearing the bearing of a\r\ncommanding king. He was a splendid speaker, a ready debater, a ruler\r\nof men, an inspirer of action; he was known ere long as the Bohemian\r\nLuther; and he spread the fame of the Brethren's Church throughout the\r\nProtestant world. Full soon, in truth, he began his great campaign. As\r\nhe entered on his work as a preacher of the Gospel, he found that among\r\nthe younger Brethren there were quite a number who did not feel at all\r\ndisposed to be bound by the warning words of Luke of Prague. They had\r\nbeen to the great Wittenberg University; they had mingled with Luther's\r\nstudents; they had listened to the talk of Michael Weiss, who had been\r\na monk at Breslau, and had brought Lutheran opinions with him; they\r\nadmired both Luther and Melancthon; and they now resolved, with one\r\nconsent, that if the candlestick of the Brethren's Church was not to\r\nbe moved from out its place, they must step shoulder to shoulder with\r\nLuther, become a regiment in the conquering Protestant army, and march\r\nwith him to the goodly land where the flower of the glad free Gospel\r\nbloomed in purity and sweet perfume. At the first opportunity\r\nAugusta, their leader, brought forward their views. At a Synod held\r\nat Brandeis-on-the-Adler, summoned by Augusta's friend, John Horn,\r\nthe senior Bishop of the Church, for the purpose of electing some new\r\nBishops, Augusta rose to address the assembly. He spoke in the name of\r\nthe younger clergy, and immediately commenced an attack upon the old\r\nExecutive Council. He accused them of listlessness and sloth; he said\r\nthat they could not understand the spirit of the age, and he ended his\r\nspeech by proposing himself and four other broad-minded men as members\r\nof the Council. The old men were shocked; the young were entranced; and\r\nAugusta was elected and consecrated a Bishop, and thus, at the age of\r\nthirty-two, became the leader of the Brethren's Church. He had three\r\ngreat schemes in view; first, friendly relations with Protestants in\r\nother countries; second, legal recognition of the Brethren in Bohemia;\r\nthird, the union of all Bohemian Protestants.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, with Augusta to lead them on, the Brethren enlisted in the\r\nProtestant army, and held the banner of their faith aloft that all the\r\nworld might see. As the Protestants in Germany had issued the Confession\r\nof Augsburg, and had it read in solemn style before the face of\r\nthe Emperor, Charles V., so now the Brethren issued a new and full\r\n\"Confession of Faith,\" to be sent first to George, Margrave of\r\nBrandenburg, and then laid in due time before Ferdinand, King of\r\nBohemia. It was a characteristic Brethren's production.[35] It is\r\nperfectly clear from this Confession that the Brethren had separated\r\nfrom Rome for practical rather than dogmatic reasons. It is true\r\nthe Brethren realised the value of faith; it is true the Confession\r\ncontained the sentence, \"He is the Lamb that taketh away the sins of the\r\nworld; and whosoever believeth in Him and calleth on His name shall be\r\nsaved\"; but even now the Brethren did not, like Luther, lay stress on\r\nthe doctrine of justification by faith alone. And yet Luther had no\r\nfault to find with this Confession. It was addressed to him, was printed\r\nat Wittenberg, was issued with his consent and approval, and was praised\r\nby him in a preface. It was read and approved by John Calvin, by\r\nMartin Bucer, by Philip Melancthon, by pious old George, Margrave of\r\nBrandenburg, and by John Frederick, Elector of Saxony. Again and again\r\nthe Brethren sent deputies to see the great Protestant leaders. At\r\nWittenberg, Augusta discussed good morals with Luther and Melancthon;\r\nand at Strasburg, Cerwenka, the Brethren's historian, held friendly\r\ncounsel with Martin Bucer and Calvin. Never had the Brethren been so\r\nwidely known, and never had they received so many compliments. Formerly\r\nLuther, who liked plain speech, had called the Brethren \"sour-looking\r\nhypocrites and self-grown saints, who believe in nothing but what they\r\nthemselves teach.\" But now he was all good humour. \"There never have\r\nbeen any Christians,\" he said, in a lecture to his students, \"so like\r\nthe apostles in doctrine and constitution as these Bohemian Brethren.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell your Brethren,\" he said to their deputies, \"to hold fast what God\r\nhas given them, and never give up their constitution and discipline. Let\r\nthem take no heed of revilements. The world will behave foolishly. If\r\nyou in Bohemia were to live as we do, what is said of us would be said\r\nof you, and if we were to live as you do, what is said of you would be\r\nsaid of us.\" \"We have never,\" he added, in a letter to the Brethren,\r\n\"attained to such a discipline and holy life as is found among you, but\r\nin the future we shall make it our aim to attain it.\"\r\n\r\nThe other great Reformers were just as enthusiastic. \"How shall I,\" said\r\nBucer, \"instruct those whom God Himself has instructed! You alone, in\r\nall the world, combine a wholesome discipline with a pure faith.\" \"We,\"\r\nsaid Calvin, \"have long since recognised the value of such a system,\r\nbut cannot, in any way, attain to it.\" \"I am pleased,\" said Melancthon,\r\n\"with the strict discipline enforced in your congregations. I wish we\r\ncould have a stricter discipline in ours.\" It is clear what all this\r\nmeans. It means that the Brethren, in their humble way, had taught the\r\nfamous Protestant leaders the value of a system of Church discipline and\r\nthe need of good works as the proper fruit of faith.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Augusta pushed his second plan. The task before him was\r\ngigantic. A great event had taken place in Bohemia. At the battle of\r\nMohacz, in a war with the Turks, Louis, King of Bohemia, fell from his\r\nhorse when crossing a stream, and was drowned {1526.}. The old line of\r\nBohemian Kings had come to an end. The crown fell into the hands of the\r\nHapsburgs; the Hapsburgs were the mightiest supporters of the Church\r\nof Rome; and the King of Bohemia, Ferdinand I., was likewise King of\r\nHungary, Archduke of Austria, King of the Romans, and brother of the\r\nEmperor Charles V., the head of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nFor the Brethren the situation was momentous. As Augusta scanned the\r\nwidening view, he saw that the time was coming fast when the Brethren,\r\nwhether they would or no, would be called to play their part like men in\r\na vast European conflict. Already the Emperor Charles V. had threatened\r\nto crush the Reformation by force; already (1530) the Protestant princes\r\nin Germany had formed the Smalkald League; and Augusta, scenting the\r\nbattle from afar, resolved to build a fortress for the Brethren. His\r\npolicy was clear and simple. If the King of Bohemia joined forces with\r\nthe Emperor, the days of the Brethren's Church would soon be over. He\r\nwould make the King of Bohemia their friend, and thus save the Brethren\r\nfrom the horrors of war. For this purpose Augusta now instructed the\r\npowerful Baron, Conrad Krajek, the richest member of the Brethren's\r\nChurch, to present the Brethren's Confession of Faith to King Ferdinand.\r\nThe Baron undertook the task. He was the leader of a group of Barons\r\nwho had recently joined the Church; he had built the great Zbor of the\r\nBrethren in Jungbunzlau, known as \"Mount Carmel\"; he had been the first\r\nto suggest a Confession of Faith, and now, having signed the Confession\r\nhimself, he sought out the King at Vienna, and was admitted to a private\r\ninterview {Nov. 11th, 1535.}. The scene was stormy. \"We would like to\r\nknow,\" said the King, \"how you Brethren came to adopt this faith. The\r\ndevil has persuaded you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the devil, gracious liege,\" replied the Baron, \"but Christ the Lord\r\nthrough the Holy Scriptures. If Christ was a Picard, then I am one too.\"\r\n\r\nThe King was beside himself with rage.\r\n\r\n\"What business,\" he shouted, \"have you to meddle with such things? You\r\nare neither Pope, nor Emperor, nor King. Believe what you will! We shall\r\nnot prevent you! If you really want to go to hell, go by all means!\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron was silent. The King paused.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he continued, \"you may believe what you like and we shall\r\nnot prevent you; but all the same, I give you warning that we shall put\r\na stop to your meetings, where you carry on your hocus-pocus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron was almost weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty,\" he protested, \"should not be so hard on me and my noble\r\nfriends. We are the most loyal subjects in your kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe King softened, spoke more gently, but still held to his point.\r\n\r\n\"I swore,\" he said, \"at my coronation to give justice to the Utraquists\r\nand Catholics, and I know what the statute says.\"\r\n\r\nAs the King spoke those ominous words, he was referring, as the Baron\r\nknew full well, to the terrible Edict of St. James. The interview ended;\r\nthe Baron withdrew; the issue still hung doubtful.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Baron had not spoken in vain. For three days the King was\r\nleft undisturbed; and then two other Barons appeared and presented the\r\nConfession, signed by twelve nobles and thirty-three knights, in due\r\nform {Nov. 14th}.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think,\" they humbly said, \"that it helps the unity of the\r\nkingdom when priests are allowed to say in the pulpit that it is less\r\nsinful to kill a Picard than it is to kill a dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe King was touched; his anger was gone, and a week later he promised\r\nthe Barons that as long as the Brethren were loyal subjects he would\r\nallow them to worship as they pleased. For some years the new policy\r\nworked very well, and the King kept his promise. The Brethren were\r\nextending on every hand. They had now at least four hundred churches and\r\ntwo hundred thousand members. They printed and published translations\r\nof Luther's works. They had a church in the city of Prague itself. They\r\nenjoyed the favour of the leading nobles in the land; and Augusta, in a\r\nfamous sermon, expressed the hope that before very long the Brethren and\r\nUtraquists would be united and form one National Protestant Church.[36]\r\nAt this point a beautiful incident occurred. As the Brethren were now so\r\nfriendly with Luther, there was a danger that they would abandon their\r\ndiscipline, become ashamed of their own little Church, and try to\r\nimitate the teaching and practice of their powerful Protestant friends.\r\nFor some years after Luke's death they actually gave way to this\r\ntemptation, and Luke's last treatise, \"Regulations for Priests,\" was\r\nscornfully cast aside. But the Brethren soon returned to their senses.\r\nAs John Augusta and John Horn travelled in Germany, they made the\r\nstrange and startling discovery that, after all, the Brethren's Church\r\nwas the best Church they knew. For a while they were dazzled by the\r\nbrilliance of the Lutheran preachers; but in the end they came to the\r\nconclusion that though these preachers were clever men they had not\r\nso firm a grip on Divine truth as the Brethren. At last, in 1546, the\r\nBrethren met in a Synod at Jungbunzlau to discuss the whole situation.\r\nWith tears in his eyes John Horn addressed the assembly. \"I have never\r\nunderstood till now,\" he said, \"what a costly treasure our Church is. I\r\nhave been blinded by the reading of German books! I have never found any\r\nthing so good in those books as we have in the books of the Brethren.\r\nYou have no need, beloved Brethren, to seek for instruction from others.\r\nYou have enough at home. I exhort you to study what you have already;\r\nyou will find there all you need.\" Again the discipline was revived in\r\nall its vigour; again, by Augusta's advice, the Catechism of Luke was\r\nput into common use, and the Brethren began to open schools and teach\r\ntheir principles to others.\r\n\r\nBut now their fondest hopes were doomed to be blasted. For the last\r\ntime Augusta went to Wittenberg to discuss the value of discipline with\r\nLuther, and as his stay drew to a close he warned the great man that if\r\nthe German theologians spent so much time in spinning doctrines and\r\nso little time in teaching morals, there was danger brewing ahead.\r\nThe warning soon came true. The Reformer died. The gathering clouds in\r\nGermany burst, and the Smalkald War broke out. The storm swept on to\r\nBohemia. As the Emperor gathered his forces in Germany to crush the\r\nProtestant Princes to powder, so Ferdinand in Bohemia summoned his\r\nsubjects to rally round his standard at Leitmeritz and defend the\r\nkingdom and the throne against the Protestant rebels. For the first time\r\nin their history the Bohemian Brethren were ordered to take sides in a\r\ncivil war. The situation was delicate. If they fought for Ferdinand they\r\nwould be untrue to their faith; if they fought against him they would be\r\ndisloyal to their country. In this dilemma they did the best they could.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they could possibly do so, the Elders issued a form of prayer\r\nto be used in all their churches. It was a prayer for the kingdom\r\nand the throne.[37] But meanwhile others were taking definite sides. At\r\nLeitmeritz the Catholics and old-fashioned Utraquists mustered to fight\r\nfor the King; and at Prague the Protestant nobles met to defend the\r\ncause of religious liberty. They met in secret at a Brother's House;\r\nthey formed a Committee of Safety of eight, and of those eight four were\r\nBrethren; and they passed a resolution to defy the King, and send help\r\nto the German Protestant leader, John Frederick, Elector of Saxony.\r\n\r\nAnd then the retribution fell like a bolt from the blue. The great\r\nbattle of Mühlberg was fought {April 24th, 1547.}; the Protestant troops\r\nwere routed; the Elector of Saxony was captured; the Emperor was master\r\nof Germany, and Ferdinand returned to Prague with vengeance written on\r\nhis brow. He called a council at Prague Castle, summoned the nobles and\r\nknights before him, ordered them to deliver up their treasonable papers,\r\ncame down on many with heavy fines, and condemned the ringleaders to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning, August 22nd, four Barons were led out to\r\nexecution in Prague, and the scaffold was erected in a public place that\r\nall the people might see and learn a lesson. Among the Barons was Wenzel\r\nPetipesky, a member of the Brethren's Church. He was to be the first to\r\ndie. As he was led from his cell by the executioner, he called out in a\r\nloud voice, which could be heard far and wide: \"My dear Brethren, we go\r\nhappy in the name of the Lord, for we go in the narrow way.\" He walked\r\nto the scaffold with his hands bound before him, and two boys played his\r\ndead march on drums. As he reached the scaffold the drums ceased, and\r\nthe executioner announced that the prisoner was dying because he had\r\ntried to dethrone King Ferdinand and put another King in his place.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Petipesky, \"was never the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, my Lord,\" roared the executioner, \"it will not help you\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God,\" said Petipesky, \"I leave all to Thee;\" and his head rolled on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nBut the worst was still to come. As Ferdinand came out of the castle\r\nchurch on Sunday morning, September 18th, he was met by a deputation of\r\nUtraquists and Catholics, who besought him to protect them against the\r\ncruelties inflicted on them by the Picards. The King soon eased their\r\nminds. He had heard a rumour that John Augusta was the real leader of\r\nthe revolt; he regarded the Brethren as traitors; he no longer felt\r\nbound by his promise to spare them; and, therefore, reviving the Edict\r\nof St. James, he issued an order that all their meetings should be\r\nsuppressed, all their property be confiscated, all their churches be\r\npurified and transformed into Romanist Chapels, and all their priests\r\nbe captured and brought to the castle in Prague {Oct. 8th, 1547.}. The\r\nBrethren pleaded not guilty.[38] They had not, as a body, taken any part\r\nin the conspiracy against the King. Instead of plotting against him, in\r\nfact, they had prayed and fasted in every parish for the kingdom and the\r\nthrone. If the King, they protested, desired to punish the few guilty\r\nBrethren, by all means let him do so; but let him not crush the innocent\r\nmany for the sake of a guilty few. \"My word,\" replied the King, \"is\r\nfinal.\" The Brethren continued to protest. And the King retorted by\r\nissuing an order that all Brethren who lived on Royal estates must\r\neither accept the Catholic Faith or leave the country before six weeks\r\nwere over {May, 1548.}.\r\n\r\nAnd never was King more astounded and staggered than Ferdinand at the\r\nresult of this decree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. -- THE BRETHREN IN POLAND, 1548-1570.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see what Ferdinand expected. He had no desire to shed more\r\nblood; he wished to see Bohemia at peace; he knew that the Brethren,\r\nwith all their skill, could never sell out in six weeks; and therefore\r\nhe hoped that, like sensible men, they would abandon their Satanic\r\nfollies, consider the comfort of their wives and children, and nestle\r\nsnugly in the bosom of the Church of Rome. But the Brethren had never\r\nlearned the art of dancing to Ferdinand's piping. As the King would not\r\nextend the time, they took him at his word. The rich came to the help\r\nof the poor,[39] and before the six weeks had flown away a large band\r\nof Brethren had bidden a sad farewell to their old familiar haunts and\r\nhomes, and started on their journey north across the pine-clad hills.\r\nFrom Leitomischl, Chlumitz and Solnic, by way of Frankenstein and\r\nBreslau, and from Turnau and Brandeis-on-the-Adler across the Giant\r\nMountains, they marched in two main bodies from Bohemia to Poland. The\r\ntime was the leafy month of June, and the first part of the journey was\r\npleasant. \"We were borne,\" says one, \"on eagles' wings.\" As they\r\ntramped along the country roads, with wagons for the women, old men\r\nand children, they made the air ring with the gladsome music of old\r\nBrethren's hymns and their march was more like a triumphal procession\r\nthan the flight of persecuted refugees. They were nearly two thousand\r\nin number. They had hundreds with them, both Catholic and Protestant, to\r\nprotect them against the mountain brigands. They had guards of infantry\r\nand cavalry. They were freed from toll at the turn-pikes. They were\r\nsupplied with meat, bread, milk and eggs by the simple country peasants.\r\nThey were publicly welcomed and entertained by the Mayor and Council of\r\nGlatz. As the news of their approach ran on before, the good folk in the\r\nvarious towns and villages would sweep the streets and clear the road to\r\nlet them pass with speed and safety to their desired haven far away.\r\nFor two months they enjoyed themselves at Posen, and the Polish nobles\r\nwelcomed them as Brothers; but the Bishop regarded them as wolves in\r\nthe flock, and had them ordered away. From Posen they marched to Polish\r\nPrussia, and were ordered away again; and not till the autumn leaves\r\nhad fallen and the dark long nights had come did they find a home in the\r\ntown of Königsberg, in the Lutheran Duchy of East Prussia.\r\n\r\nAnd even there they were almost worried to death. As they settled down\r\nas peaceful citizens in this Protestant land of light and liberty, they\r\nfound, to their horror and dismay, that Lutherans, when it suited their\r\npurpose, could be as bigoted as Catholics. They were forced to accept\r\nthe Confession of Augsburg. They were forbidden to ordain their own\r\npriests or practise their own peculiar customs. They were treated,\r\nnot as Protestant brothers, but as highly suspicious foreigners; and a\r\npriest of the Brethren was not allowed to visit a member of his flock\r\nunless he took a Lutheran pastor with him. \"If you stay with us,\" said\r\nSperatus, the Superintendent of the East Prussian Lutheran Church, \"you\r\nmust accommodate yourselves to our ways. Nobody sent for you; nobody\r\nasked you to come.\" If the Brethren, in a word, were to stay in East\r\nPrussia, they must cease to be Brethren at all, and allow themselves to\r\nbe absorbed by the conquering Lutherans of the land.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, they had a Moses to lead them out of the desert.\r\nGeorge Israel is a type of the ancient Brethren. He was the son of\r\na blacksmith, was a close friend of Augusta, had been with him at\r\nWittenberg, and was now the second great leader of the Brethren.\r\nWhen Ferdinand issued his decree, Israel, like many of the Brethren's\r\nMinisters, was summoned to Prague to answer for his faith and conduct\r\non pain of a fine of one thousand ducats; and when some of his friends\r\nadvised him to disobey the summons, and even offered to pay the money,\r\nhe gave one of those sublime answers which light up the gloom of the\r\ntime. \"No,\" he replied, \"I have been purchased once and for all with the\r\nblood of Christ, and will not consent to be ransomed with the gold and\r\nsilver of my people. Keep what you have, for you will need it in your\r\nflight, and pray for me that I may be steadfast in suffering for Jesus.\"\r\nHe went to Prague, confessed his faith, and was thrown into the White\r\nTower. But he was loosely guarded, and one day, disguised as a clerk,\r\nwith a pen behind his ear, and paper and ink-horn in his hand, he walked\r\nout of the Tower in broad daylight through the midst of his guards,\r\nand joined the Brethren in Prussia. He was just the man to guide the\r\nwandering band, and the Council appointed him leader of the emigrants.\r\nHe was energetic and brave. He could speak the Polish tongue. He had a\r\nclear head and strong limbs. For him a cold lodging in Prussia was\r\nnot enough. He would lead his Brethren to a better land, and give them\r\nnobler work to do.\r\n\r\nAs the Brethren had already been driven from Poland, the task which\r\nIsrael now undertook appeared an act of folly. But George Israel knew\r\nbetter. For a hundred years the people of Poland had sympathised to some\r\nextent with the reforming movement in Bohemia. There Jerome of Prague\r\nhad taught. There the teaching of Hus had spread. There the people hated\r\nthe Church of Rome. There the nobles sent their sons to study under\r\nLuther at Wittenberg. There the works of Luther and Calvin had been\r\nprinted and spread in secret. There, above all, the Queen herself had\r\nbeen privately taught the Protestant faith by her own father-confessor.\r\nAnd there, thought Israel, the Brethren in time would find a hearty\r\nwelcome. And so, while still retaining the oversight of a few parishes\r\nin East Prussia, George Israel, by commission of the Council, set out\r\nto conduct a mission in Poland {1551.}. Alone and on horseback, by bad\r\nroads and swollen streams, he went on his dangerous journey; and on the\r\nfourth Sunday in Lent arrived at the town of Thorn, and rested for the\r\nday. Here occurred the famous incident on the ice which made his name\r\nremembered in Thorn for many a year to come. As he was walking on the\r\nfrozen river to try whether the ice was strong enough to bear his horse,\r\nthe ice broke up with a crash. George Israel was left on a solitary\r\nlump, and was swept whirling down the river; and then, as the ice blocks\r\ncracked and banged and splintered into thousands of fragments, he sprang\r\nlike a deer from block to block, and sang with loud exulting voice:\r\n\"Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps; fire and\r\nhail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling his word.\" There was a\r\ngreat crowd on the bank. The people watched the thrilling sight with\r\nawe, and when at last he reached firm ground they welcomed him with\r\nshouts of joy. We marvel not that such a man was like the sword of\r\nGideon in the conflict. He rode on to Posen, the capital of Great\r\nPoland, began holding secret meetings, and established the first\r\nevangelical church in the country. The Roman Catholic Bishop heard of\r\nhis arrival, and put forty assassins on his track. But Israel was a man\r\nof many wiles as well as a man of God. He assumed disguises, and changed\r\nhis clothes so as to baffle pursuit, appearing now as an officer, now\r\nas a coachman, now as a cook. He presented himself at the castle of the\r\nnoble family of the Ostrorogs, was warmly welcomed by the Countess, and\r\nheld a service in her rooms. The Count was absent, heard the news, and\r\ncame in a state of fury. He seized a whip. \"I will drag my wife out\r\nof this conventicle,\" he exclaimed; and burst into the room while the\r\nservice was proceeding, his eyes flashing fire and the whip swinging in\r\nhis hand. The preacher, Cerwenka, calmly went on preaching. \"Sir,\" said\r\nGeorge Israel, pointing to an empty seat \"sit down there.\" The Count\r\nof Ostrorog meekly obeyed, listened quietly to the discourse, became\r\na convert that very day, turned out his own Lutheran Court Chaplain,\r\ninstalled George Israel in his place, and made a present to the Brethren\r\nof his great estate on the outskirts of the town.\r\n\r\nFor the Brethren the gain was enormous. As the news of the Count's\r\nconversion spread, other nobles quickly followed suit. The town of\r\nOstrorog became the centre of a swiftly growing movement; the poor\r\nBrethren in Prussia returned to Poland, and found churches ready for\r\ntheir use; and before seven years had passed away the Brethren had\r\nfounded forty congregations in this their first land of exile.\r\n\r\nThey had, however, another great mission to fulfil. As the Brethren\r\nspread from town to town, they discovered that the other Protestant\r\nbodies--the Lutherans, Zwinglians and Calvinists--were almost as fond\r\nof fighting with each other as of denouncing the Church of Rome; and\r\ntherefore the people, longing for peace, were disgusted more or less\r\nwith them all. But the Brethren stood on a rather different footing.\r\nThey were cousins to the Poles in blood; they had no fixed and definite\r\ncreed; they thought far more of brotherly love than of orthodoxy in\r\ndoctrine; and therefore the idea was early broached that the Church of\r\nthe Brethren should be established as the National Church of Poland.\r\nThe idea grew. The Lutherans, Zwinglians, Calvinists and Brethren drew\r\ncloser and closer together. They exchanged confessions, discussed each\r\nother's doctrines, met in learned consultations, and held united synods\r\nagain and again. For fifteen years the glorious vision of a union of all\r\nthe Protestants in Poland hung like glittering fruit just out of reach.\r\nThere were many walls in the way. Each church wanted to be the leading\r\nchurch in Poland; each wanted its own confession to be the bond of\r\nunion; each wanted its own form of service, its own form of government,\r\nto be accepted by all. But soon one and all began to see that the time\r\nhad come for wranglings to cease. The Jesuits were gaining ground in\r\nPoland. The Protestant Kingdom must no longer be divided against itself.\r\n\r\nAt last the Brethren, the real movers of the scheme, persuaded all to\r\nassemble in the great United Synod of Sendomir, and all Protestants in\r\nPoland felt that the fate of the country depended on the issue of the\r\nmeeting {1570.}. It was the greatest Synod that had ever been held in\r\nPoland. It was an attempt to start a new movement in the history of the\r\nReformation, an attempt to fling out the apple of discord and unite all\r\nProtestants in one grand army which should carry the enemy's forts by\r\nstorm. At first the goal seemed further off than ever. As the Calvinists\r\nwere the strongest body, they confidently demanded that their Confession\r\nshould be accepted, and put forward the telling argument that it was\r\nalready in use in the country. As the Lutherans were the next strongest\r\nbody, they offered the Augsburg Confession, and both parties turned\r\nround upon the Brethren, and accused them of having so many Confessions\r\nthat no one knew which to take. And then young Turnovius, the\r\nrepresentative of the Brethren, rose to speak. The Brethren, he said,\r\nhad only one Confession in Poland. They had presented that Confession to\r\nthe King; they believed that it was suited best to the special needs\r\nof the country, and yet they would accept the Calvinists' Confession as\r\nlong as they might keep their own as well.\r\n\r\nThere was a deadlock. What was to be done? The Brethren's work seemed\r\nabout to come to nought. Debates and speeches were in vain. Each party\r\nremained firm as a rock. And then, in wondrous mystic wise, the tone of\r\nthe gathering softened.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, for God's sake,\" said the Palatine of Sendomir in his\r\nspeech, \"remember what depends upon the result of our deliberations,\r\nand incline your hearts to that harmony and love which the Lord has\r\ncommanded us to follow above all things.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Palatine ended his speech he burst into tears. His friend, the\r\nPalatine of Cracow, sobbed aloud. Forthwith the angry clouds disparted\r\nand revealed the bow of peace, the obstacles to union vanished, and the\r\nmembers of the Synod agreed to draw up a new Confession, which should\r\ngive expression to the united faith of all. The Confession was prepared\r\n{April 14th.}. It is needless to trouble about the doctrinal details.\r\nFor us the important point to notice is the spirit of union displayed.\r\nFor the first, but not for the last, time in the history of Poland the\r\nEvangelical Protestants agreed to sink their differences on points of\r\ndispute, and unite their forces in common action against alike the power\r\nof Rome and the Unitarian[40] sects of the day. The joy was universal. The\r\nscene in the hall at Sendomir was inspiring. When the Committee laid the\r\nConfession before the Synod all the members arose and sang the Ambrosian\r\nTe Deum. With outstretched hands the Lutherans advanced to meet the\r\nBrethren, and with outstretched hands the Brethren advanced to meet the\r\nLutherans. The next step was to make the union public. For this purpose\r\nthe Brethren, a few weeks later, formed a procession one Sunday morning\r\nand attended service at the Lutheran Church; and then, in the afternoon,\r\nthe Lutherans attended service in the Church of the Brethren {May 28th,\r\n1570.}. It is hard to believe that all this was empty show. And yet the\r\ntruth must be confessed that this \"Union of Sendomir\" was by no means\r\nthe beautiful thing that some writers have imagined. It was the result,\r\nto a very large extent, not of any true desire for unity, but rather of\r\nan attempt on the part of the Polish nobles to undermine the influence\r\nand power of the clergy. It led to no permanent union of the Protestants\r\nin Poland. Its interest is sentimental rather than historic. For the\r\ntime--but for a very short time only--the Brethren had succeeded in\r\nteaching others a little charity of spirit, and had thus shown their\r\ndesire to hasten the day when the Churches of Christ, no longer asunder,\r\nshall know \"how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell\r\ntogether in unity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all this--this attempt at unity, this second home for the Brethren,\r\nthis new Evangelical movement in Poland--was the strange result of the\r\nedict issued by Ferdinand, King of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. -- THE MARTYR-BISHOP, 1548-1560.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, John Augusta, the great leader of the Brethren, was passing\r\nthrough the furnace of affliction.\r\n\r\nOf all the tools employed by Ferdinand, the most crafty, active and\r\nambitious was a certain officer named Sebastian Schöneich, who, in the\r\nwords of the great historian, Gindely, was one of those men fitted by\r\nnature for the post of hangman.\r\n\r\nFor some months this man had distinguished himself by his zeal in the\r\ncause of the King. He had seized sixteen heads of families for singing\r\nhymns at a baker's funeral, had thrown them into the drain-vaults of the\r\nWhite Tower at Prague, and had left them there to mend their ways in\r\nthe midst of filth and horrible stenches. And now he occupied the proud\r\nposition of town-captain of Leitomischl. Never yet had he known such a\r\ngolden chance of covering himself with glory. For some time Augusta, who\r\nwas now First Senior of the Church, had been hiding in the neighbouring\r\nwoods, and only two or three Brethren knew his exact abode. But already\r\npersecution had done her work, and treachery now did hers.\r\n\r\nAmong the inhabitants of Leitomischl were certain renegade Brethren,\r\nand these now said to the Royal Commissioners: \"If the King could only\r\ncapture and torture Augusta, he could unearth the whole conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Augusta?\" asked the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\"He is not at home,\" replied the traitors, \"but if you will ask his\r\nfriend, Jacob Bilek, he will tell you all you want to know.\"\r\n\r\nThe wily Schöneich laid his plot. If only he could capture Augusta, he\r\nwould win the favour of the King and fill his own pockets with money. As\r\nhe strolled one day through the streets of Leitomischl he met a certain\r\ninnocent Brother Henry, and there and then began his deadly work.\r\n\r\n\"If you know,\" he said, \"where Augusta is, tell him I desire an\r\ninterview with him. I will meet him wherever he likes. I have something\r\nspecial to say to him, something good, not only for him, but for the\r\nwhole Brethren's Church. But breathe not a word of this to anyone else.\r\nNot a soul--not even yourself--must know about the matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe message to Augusta was sent. He replied that he would grant the\r\ninterview on condition that Schöneich would guarantee his personal\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied Schöneich, \"is quite impossible. I cannot give any\r\nsecurity whatever. The whole business must be perfectly secret. Not a\r\nsoul must be present but Augusta and myself. I wouldn't have the King\r\nknow about this for a thousand groschen. Tell Augusta not to be afraid\r\nof me. I have no instructions concerning him. He can come with an easy\r\nmind to Leitomischl. If he will not trust me as far as that, let him\r\nname the place himself, and I will go though it be a dozen miles away.\"\r\n\r\nBut Augusta still returned the same answer, and Schöneich had to\r\nstrengthen his plea. Again he met the guileless Brother Henry, and again\r\nhe stormed him with his eloquent tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no better answer from Augusta?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Brother Henry.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, my only Henry,\" pleaded Schöneich, \"I do so long for a little\r\nchat with Augusta. My heart bleeds with sympathy for you. I am expecting\r\nthe King's Commissioners. They may be here any moment. It will go hard\r\nwith you poor folk when they come. If only I could have a talk with\r\nAugusta, it would be so much better for you all. But do tell him not to\r\nbe afraid of me. I have no instructions concerning him. I will wager my\r\nneck for that,\" he said, putting his finger to his throat. \"I am willing\r\nto give my life for you poor Brethren.\"\r\n\r\nThe shot went home. As Augusta lay in his safe retreat he had written\r\nstirring letters to the Brethren urging them to be true to their\r\ncolours; and now, he heard from his friends in Leitomischl that\r\nSchöneich was an evangelical saint, and that if he would only confer\r\nwith the saint he might render his Brethren signal service, and deliver\r\nthem from their distresses. He responded nobly to the appeal. For the\r\nsake of the Church he had led so long, he would risk his liberty and his\r\nlife. In vain the voice of prudence said \"Stay!\"; the voice of love said\r\n\"Go!\"; and Augusta agreed to meet the Captain in a wood three miles\r\nfrom the town. The Captain chuckled. The time was fixed, and, the night\r\nbefore, the artful plotter sent three of his trusty friends to lie\r\nin wait. As the morning broke of the fateful day {April 25th, 1548.},\r\nAugusta, still suspecting a trap, sent his secretary, Jacob Bilek, in\r\nadvance to spy the land; and the three brave men sprang out upon him and\r\ncarried him off to Schöneich. And then, at the appointed hour, came John\r\nAugusta himself. He had dressed himself as a country peasant, carried a\r\nhoe in is hand, and strolled in the woodland whistling a merry tune. For\r\nthe moment the hirelings were baffled. They seized him and let him go;\r\nthey seized him again and let him go again; they seized him, for the\r\nthird time, searched him, and found a fine handkerchief in his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said one of them, \"a country peasant does not use a handkerchief\r\nlike this.\"\r\n\r\nThe game was up. Augusta stood revealed, and Schöneich, hearing the\r\nglorious news, came prancing up on his horse.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Augusta, \"is this what you call faith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never hear,\" said Schöneich, \"that promises made in the night\r\nare never binding? Did you never hear of a certain Jew with his red\r\nbeard and yellow bag? Did you never hear of the mighty power of money?\r\nAnd where have you come from this morning? I hear you have plenty of\r\nmoney in your possession. Where is that money now?\"\r\n\r\nAs they rode next day in a covered waggon on their way to the city of\r\nPrague, the Captain pestered Augusta with many questions.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Johannes,\" said the jovial wag, \"where have you been? With\r\nwhom? Where are your letters and your clothes? Whose is this cap? Where\r\ndid you get it? Who lent it to you? What do they call him? Where does\r\nhe live? Where is your horse? Where is your money? Where are your\r\ncompanions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you ask so many questions?\" asked Augusta.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied Schöneich, letting out the murder, \"I want to be able\r\nto give information about you. I don't want to be called a donkey or a\r\ncalf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now began for John Augusta a time of terrible testing. As the\r\nCaptain rapped his questions out he was playing his part in a deadly\r\ngame that involved the fate, not only of the Brethren's Church, but of\r\nall evangelicals in the land.\r\n\r\nFor months King Ferdinand had longed to capture Augusta. He regarded him\r\nas the author of the Smalkald League; he regarded him as the deadliest\r\nfoe of the Catholic faith in Europe; he regarded the peaceful Brethren\r\nas rebels of the vilest kind; and now that he had Augusta in his power\r\nhe determined to make him confess the plot, and then, with the proof he\r\ndesired in his hands, he would stamp out the Brethren's Church for once\r\nand all.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Augusta was now imprisoned in the White Tower at\r\nPrague. He was placed in the wine vaults below the castle, had heavy\r\nfetters on his hands and feet, and sat for days in a crunched position.\r\nThe historic contest began. For two hours at a stretch the King's\r\nexaminers riddled Augusta with questions. \"Who sent the letter to the\r\nKing?\"[41] they asked. \"Where do the Brethren keep their papers and money?\r\nTo whom did the Brethren turn for help when the King called on his\r\nsubjects to support him? Who went with you to Wittenberg? For what and\r\nfor whom did the Brethren pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"They prayed,\" said Augusta, \"that God would incline the heart of the\r\nKing to be gracious to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"By what means did the Brethren defend themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"By patience,\" replied Augusta.\r\n\r\n\"To whom did they apply for help?\"\r\n\r\nAugusta pointed to heaven.\r\n\r\nAs Augusta's answers to all these questions were not considered\r\nsatisfactory, they next endeavoured to sharpen his wits by torturing a\r\nGerman coiner in his presence; and when this mode of persuasion failed,\r\nthey tortured Augusta himself. They stripped him naked. They stretched\r\nhim face downwards on a ladder. They smeared his hips with boiling\r\npitch. They set the spluttering mess on fire, and drew it off, skin and\r\nall, with a pair of tongs. They screwed him tightly in the stocks. They\r\nhung him up to the ceiling by a hook, with the point run through his\r\nflesh. They laid him flat upon his back and pressed great stones on his\r\nstomach. It was all in vain. Again they urged him to confess the part\r\nthat he and the Brethren had played in the great revolt, and again\r\nAugusta bravely replied that the Brethren had taken no such part at all.\r\n\r\nAt this the King himself intervened. For some months he had been busy\r\nenough at Augsburg, assisting the Emperor in his work; but now he sent\r\na letter to Prague, with full instructions how to deal with Augusta. If\r\ngentle measures did not succeed, then sterner measures, said he, must\r\nbe employed. He had three new tortures to suggest. First, he said, let\r\nAugusta be watched and deprived of sleep for five or six days. Next, he\r\nmust be strapped to a shutter, with his head hanging over one end;\r\nhe must have vinegar rubbed into his nostrils; he must have a beetle\r\nfastened on to his stomach; and in this position, with his neck aching,\r\nhis nostrils smarting, and the beetle working its way to his vitals, he\r\nmust be kept for two days and two nights. And, third, if these measures\r\ndid not act, he must be fed with highly seasoned food and allowed\r\nnothing to drink.\r\n\r\nBut these suggestions were never carried out. As the messenger hastened\r\nwith the King's billet-doux, and the Brethren on the northern frontier\r\nwere setting out for Poland, Augusta and Bilek were on their way to the\r\nfamous old castle of Pürglitz. For ages that castle, built on a rock,\r\nand hidden away in darkling woods, had been renowned in Bohemian lore.\r\nThere the mother of Charles IV. had heard the nightingales sing; there\r\nthe faithful, ran the story, had held John Ziska at bay; there had many\r\na rebel suffered in the terrible \"torture-tower\"; and there Augusta and\r\nhis faithful friend were to lie for many a long and weary day.\r\n\r\nThey were taken to Pürglitz in two separate waggons. They travelled by\r\nnight and arrived about mid-day; they were placed in two separate\r\ncells, and for sixteen years the fortunes of the Brethren centred round\r\nPürglitz Castle.\r\n\r\nIf the Bishop had been the vilest criminal, he could not have been more\r\ngrossly insulted. For two years he had to share his cell with a vulgar\r\nGerman coiner; and the coiner, in facetious pastime, often smote him on\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nHis cell was almost pitch-dark. The window was shuttered within and\r\nwithout, and the merest glimmer from the cell next door struggled in\r\nthrough a chink four inches broad. At meals alone he was permitted half\r\na candle. For bedding he had a leather bolster, a coverlet and what\r\nGermans call a \"bed-sack.\" For food he was allowed two rations of meat,\r\ntwo hunches of bread, and two jugs of barley-beer a day. His shirt was\r\nwashed about once a fortnight, his face and hands twice a week, his head\r\ntwice a year, and the rest of his body never. He was not allowed the\r\nuse of a knife and fork. He was not allowed to speak to the prison\r\nattendants. He had no books, no papers, no ink, no news of the world\r\nwithout; and there for three years he sat in the dark, as lonely as\r\nthe famous prisoner of Chillon. Again, by the King's command, he was\r\ntortured, with a gag in his mouth to stifle his screams and a threat\r\nthat if he would not confess he should have an interview with the\r\nhangman; and again he refused to deny his Brethren, and was flung back\r\ninto his corner.\r\n\r\nThe delivering angel came in humble guise. Among the warders who guarded\r\nhis cell was a daring youth who had lived at Leitomischl. He had been\r\nbrought up among the Brethren. He regarded the Bishop as a martyr. His\r\nwife lived in a cottage near the castle; and now, drunken rascal though\r\nhe was, he risked his life for Augusta's sake, used his cottage as\r\na secret post office, and handed in to the suffering Bishop letters,\r\nbooks, ink, paper, pens, money and candles.\r\n\r\nThe Brethren stationed a priest in Pürglitz village. The great Bishop\r\nwas soon as bright and active as ever. By day he buried his tools in the\r\nground; by night he plugged every chink and cranny, and applied himself\r\nto his labours. Not yet was his spirit broken; not yet was his mind\r\nunhinged. As his candle burned in that gloomy dungeon in the silent\r\nwatches of the night, so the fire of his genius shone anew in those\r\ndarksome days of trial and persecution; and still he urged his afflicted\r\nBrethren to be true to the faith of their fathers, to hold fast the\r\nApostles' Creed, and to look onward to the brighter day when once again\r\ntheir pathway would shine as the wings of a dove that are covered with\r\nsilver and her feathers with yellow gold. He comforted Bilek in his\r\naffliction; he published a volume of sermons for the elders to read in\r\nsecret; he composed a number of stirring and triumphant hymns; and there\r\nhe penned the noble words still sung in the Brethren's Church:--\r\n\r\n   Praise God for ever.\r\n   Boundless is his favour,\r\n   To his Church and chosen flock,\r\n   Founded on Christ the Rock.\r\n\r\nAs he lay in his cell he pondered much on the sad fate of his Brethren.\r\nAt one time he heard a rumour that the Church was almost extinct. Some,\r\nhe knew, had fled to Poland. Some had settled in Moravia. Some, robbed\r\nof lands and houses, were roaming the country as pedlars or earning a\r\nscanty living as farm labourers. And some, alas! had lowered the flag\r\nand joined the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Augusta had never abandoned hope. For ten years, despite a few\r\ninterruptions, he kept in almost constant touch, not only with his own\r\nBrethren, but also with the Protestant world at large. He was still,\r\nhe thought, the loved and honoured leader; he was still the mightiest\r\nreligious force in the land; and now, in his dungeon, he sketched a plan\r\nto heal his country's woes and form the true disciples of Christ into\r\none grand national Protestant army against which both Pope and Emperor\r\nwould for ever contend in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. -- THE LAST DAYS OF AUGUSTA, 1560-1572.\r\n\r\nTo Augusta the prospect seemed hopeful. Great changes had taken place\r\nin the Protestant world. The Lutherans in Germany had triumphed. The\r\nreligious peace of Augsburg had been consummated, The German Protestants\r\nhad now a legal standing. The great Emperor, Charles V., had resigned\r\nhis throne. His successor was his brother Ferdinand, the late King of\r\nBohemia. The new King of Bohemia was Ferdinand's eldest son, Maximilian\r\nI. Maximilian was well disposed towards Protestants, and persecution in\r\nBohemia died away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Brethren plucked up heart again. They rebuilt their chapel\r\nat their headquarters, Jungbunzlau. They presented a copy of\r\ntheir Hymn-book to the King. They divided the Church into three\r\nprovinces--Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. They appointed George Israel\r\nFirst Senior in Poland, John Czerny First Senior in Bohemia and Moravia,\r\nand Cerwenka secretary to the whole Church.\r\n\r\nBut the Brethren had gone further still. As Augusta was the sole\r\nsurviving Bishop in the Church, the Brethren were in a difficulty. They\r\nmust not be without Bishops. But what were they to do? Were they to\r\nwait till Augusta was set at liberty, or were they to elect new Bishops\r\nwithout his authority? They chose the latter course, and Augusta was\r\ndeeply offended. They elected Czerny and Cerwenka to the office of\r\nBishops; they had them consecrated as Bishops by two Brethren in\r\npriests' orders; and they actually allowed the two new Bishops to\r\nconsecrate two further Bishops, George Israel and Blahoslaw, the Church\r\nHistorian.\r\n\r\nAnd even this was not the worst of the story. As he lay in his dungeon\r\nforming plans for the Church he loved so well, it slowly dawned upon\r\nAugusta that his Brethren were ceasing to trust him, and that the sun\r\nof his power, which had shone so brightly, was now sloping slowly to its\r\nsetting. He heard of one change after another taking place without his\r\nconsent. He heard that the Council had condemned his sermons as too\r\nlearned and dry for the common people, and that they had altered them to\r\nsuit their own opinions. He heard that his hymns, which he had desired\r\nto see in the new Hymn-book, had been mangled in a similar manner. His\r\nBrethren did not even tell him what they were doing. They simply left\r\nhim out in the cold. What he himself heard he heard by chance, and that\r\nwas the \"most unkind cut of all.\" His authority was gone; his\r\nposition was lost; his hopes were blasted; and his early guidance, his\r\nentreaties, his services, his sufferings were all, he thought, forgotten\r\nby an ungrateful Church.\r\n\r\nAs Augusta heard of all these changes, a glorious vision rose before\r\nhis mind. At first he was offended, quarrelled with the Brethren, and\r\ndeclared the new Bishops invalid. But at last his better feelings gained\r\nthe mastery. He would not sulk like a petted child; he would render his\r\nBrethren the greatest service in his power. He would fight his way to\r\nliberty; he would resume his place on the bridge, and before long he\r\nwould make the Church the national Church of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a duke. The Archduke Ferdinand, brother of the\r\nKing, came to reside at Pürglitz {1560.}. Augusta appealed for liberty\r\nto Ferdinand; the Archduke referred the matter to the King; the King\r\nreferred the matter to the clergy; and the clergy drew up for Augusta's\r\nbenefit a form of recantation. The issue before him was now perfectly\r\nclear. There was one road to freedom and one only. He must sign the form\r\nof recantation in full. The form was drastic. He must renounce all\r\nhis previous religious opinions. He must acknowledge the Holy Catholic\r\nChurch and submit to her in all things. He must eschew the gatherings of\r\nWaldenses, Picards and all other apostates, denounce their teaching as\r\ndepraved, and recognise the Church of Rome as the one true Church of\r\nChrist. He must labour for the unity of the Church and endeavour to\r\nbring his Brethren into the fold. He must never again interpret the\r\nScriptures according to his own understanding, but submit rather to the\r\nexposition and authority of the Holy Roman Church, which alone was fit\r\nto decide on questions of doctrine. He must do his duty by the King,\r\nobey him and serve him with zeal as a loyal subject. And finally he must\r\nwrite out the whole recantation with his own hand, take a public oath\r\nto keep it, and have it signed and sealed by witnesses. Augusta refused\r\npoint blank. His hopes of liberty vanished. His heart sank in despair.\r\n\"They might as well,\" said Bilek, his friend, \"have asked him to walk on\r\nhis head.\"\r\n\r\nBut here Lord Sternberg, Governor of the Castle, suggested another path.\r\nIf Augusta, said he, would not join the Church of Rome, perhaps he would\r\nat least join the Utraquists. He had been a Utraquist in his youth; the\r\nBrethren were Utraquists under another name; and all that Augusta had to\r\ndo was to give himself his proper name, and his dungeon door would fly\r\nopen. Of all the devices to entrap Augusta, this well-meant trick was\r\nthe most enticing. The argument was a shameless logical juggle.\r\nThe Utraquists celebrated the communion in both kinds; the Brethren\r\ncelebrated the communion in both kinds; therefore the Brethren were\r\nUtraquists.[42] At first Augusta himself appeared to be caught.\r\n\r\n\"I, John Augusta,\" he wrote, \"confess myself a member of the whole\r\nEvangelical Church, which, wherever it may be, receives the body and\r\nblood of the Lord Jesus Christ in both kinds. I swear that, along with\r\nthe Holy Catholic Church, I will maintain true submission and obedience\r\nto her chief Head, Jesus Christ. I will order my life according to God's\r\nholy word and the truth of his pure Gospel. I will be led by Him, obey\r\nHim alone, and by no other human thoughts and inventions. I renounce\r\nall erroneous and wicked opinions against the holy universal Christian\r\napostolic faith. I will never take any part in the meetings of Picards\r\nor other heretics.\"\r\n\r\nIf Augusta thought that by language like this he would catch his\r\nexaminers napping, he was falling into a very grievous error. He\r\nhad chosen his words with care. He never said what he meant by the\r\nUtraquists. He never said whether he would include the Brethren among\r\nthe Utraquists or among the Picards and heretics. And he had never made\r\nany reference to the Pope.\r\n\r\nHis examiners were far too clever to be deceived. Instead of\r\nrecommending that Augusta be now set at liberty, they contended that his\r\nrecantation was no recantation at all. He had shown no inclination, they\r\nsaid, towards either Rome or Utraquism. His principles were remarkably\r\nlike those of Martin Luther. He had not acknowledged the supremacy of\r\nthe Pope, and when he said he would not be led by any human inventions\r\nhe was plainly repudiating the Church of Rome. What is the good, they\r\nasked, of Augusta's promising to resist heretics when he does not\r\nacknowledge the Brethren to be heretics? \"It is,\" they said, \"as\r\nclear as day that John Augusta has no real intention of renouncing his\r\nerrors.\" Let the man say straight out to which party he belonged.\r\n\r\nAgain Augusta tried to fence, and again he met his match. Instead of\r\nsaying in plain language to which party he belonged, he persisted in\r\nhis first assertion that he belonged to the Catholic Evangelical Church,\r\nwhich was now split into various sects. But as the old man warmed to his\r\nwork he threw caution aside.\r\n\r\n\"I have never,\" he said, \"had anything to do with Waldenses or Picards.\r\nI belong to the general Evangelical Church, which enjoys the Communion\r\nin both kinds. I renounce entirely the Popish sect known as the Holy\r\nRoman Church. I deny that the Pope is the Vicar of Christ. I deny that\r\nthe Church of Rome alone has authority to interpret the Scriptures. If\r\nthe Church of Rome claims such authority, she must first show that\r\nshe is free from the spirit of the world, and possesses the spirit of\r\ncharity, and until that is done I refuse to bow to her decrees.\"\r\n\r\nHe defended the Church of the Brethren with all his might. It was,\r\nhe said, truly evangelical. It was Catholic. It was apostolic. It was\r\nrecognised and praised by Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Bucer, Bullinger\r\nand other saints. As long as the moral life of the Church of Rome\r\nremained at such a low ebb, so long would there be need for the\r\nBrethren's Church.\r\n\r\n\"If the Church of Rome will mend her ways, the Brethren,\" said he, \"will\r\nreturn to her fold; but till that blessed change takes place they will\r\nremain where they are.\"\r\n\r\nHe denied being a traitor. \"If any one says that I have been disloyal to\r\nthe Emperor, I denounce that person as a liar. If his Majesty knew how\r\nloyal I have been, he would not keep me here another hour. I know why I\r\nam suffering. I am suffering, not as an evil-doer, but as a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nThe first skirmish was over. The clergy were firm, and Augusta sank back\r\nexhausted in his cell. But the kindly Governor was still resolved to\r\nsmooth the way for his prisoners. \"I will not rest,\" he said, \"till I\r\nsee them at liberty.\" He suggested that Augusta should have an interview\r\nwith the Jesuits!\r\n\r\n\"What would be the good of that?\" said Augusta. \"I should be like\r\na little dog in the midst of a pack of lions. I pray you, let these\r\nnegotiations cease. I would rather stay where I am. It is clear there\r\nis no escape for me unless I am false to my honour and my conscience. I\r\nwill never recant nor act against my conscience. May God help me to keep\r\ntrue till death.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Augusta gave way, attended Mass, with Bilek, in\r\nthe castle chapel, and consented to an interview with the Jesuits, on\r\ncondition that Bilek should go with him, and that he should also be\r\nallowed another interview with the Utraquists {1561.}. The day for the\r\nduel arrived. The chosen spot was the new Jesuit College at Prague. As\r\nthey drove to the city both Augusta and Bilek were allowed to stretch\r\ntheir limbs and even get out of sight of their guards. At Prague they\r\nwere allowed a dip in the Royal Bath. It was the first bath they had had\r\nfor fourteen years, and the people came from far and near to gaze upon\r\ntheir scars.\r\n\r\nAnd now, being fresh and clean in body, Augusta, the stubborn heretical\r\nPicard, was to be made clean in soul. As the Jesuits were determined to\r\ndo their work well, they laid down the strict condition that no one but\r\nthemselves must be allowed to speak with the prisoners. For the rest the\r\nprisoners were treated kindly. The bedroom was neat; the food was\r\ngood; the large, bright dining-room had seven windows. They had wine to\r\ndinner, and were waited on by a discreet and silent butler. Not a word\r\ndid that solemn functionary utter. If the Brethren made a remark to him,\r\nhe laid his fingers on his lips like the witches in Macbeth.\r\n\r\nThe great debate began. The Jesuit spokesman was Dr. Henry Blissem. He\r\nopened by making a clean breast of the whole purpose of the interview.\r\n\r\n\"It is well known to you both,\" said he, \"for what purpose you have been\r\nhanded over to our care, that we, if possible, may help you to a right\r\nunderstanding of the Christian faith.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Jesuits could have had their way, they would have had Augusta's\r\nanswers set down in writing. But here Augusta stood firm as a rock. He\r\nknew the game the Jesuits were playing. The interview was of national\r\nimportance. If his answers were considered satisfactory, the Jesuits\r\nwould have them printed, sow them broadcast, and boast of his\r\nconversion; and if, on the other hand, they were unsatisfactory, they\r\nwould send them to the Emperor as proof that Augusta was a rebel, demand\r\nhis instant execution, and start another persecution of the Brethren.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry, made the first pass.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy Universal Church,\" he said, \"is the true bride of Christ and\r\nthe true mother of all Christians.\"\r\n\r\nAugusta politely agreed.\r\n\r\n\"On this is question,\" he said, \"our own party thinks and believes\r\nexactly as you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" continued the doctor suavely, \"can believe in God who does not\r\nthink correctly of the Holy Church, and regard her as his mother; and\r\nwithout the Church there is no salvation.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Augusta politely agreed, and again the learned Jesuit beamed with\r\npleasure. Now came the tug of war.\r\n\r\n\"This Holy Christian Church,\" said Blissem, \"has never erred and cannot\r\nerr.\"\r\n\r\nAugusta met this with a flat denial. If he surrendered here he\r\nsurrendered all, and would be untrue to his Brethren. If he once agreed\r\nthat the Church was infallible he was swallowing the whole Roman pill.\r\nIn vain the doctor argued. Augusta held his ground. The Jesuits reported\r\nhim hard in the head, and had him sent back to his cell.\r\n\r\nFor two more years he waited in despair, and then he was brought to the\r\nWhite Tower again, and visited by two Utraquist Priests, Mystopol and\r\nMartin. His last chance, they told him, had now arrived. They had come\r\nas messengers from the Archduke Ferdinand and from the Emperor himself.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said one of them, \"on what you are relying and how you console\r\nyourself, but I warn you it will avail you nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know no secrets,\" said Augusta.\r\n\r\n\"What secrets?\" queried Mystopol.\r\n\r\n\"Neither divine nor mine. My dear administrators, your visit is quite a\r\nsurprise! With regard to the recantation, however, let me say at once,\r\nI shall not sign it! I have never been guilty of any errors, and have\r\nnothing to recant. I made my public confession of faith before the\r\nlords and knights of Bohemia twenty-eight years ago. It was shown to the\r\nEmperor at Vienna, and no one has ever found anything wrong with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it,\" said Mystopol, \"you cannot see your error? You know it says\r\nin our confession, 'I believe in the Holy Catholic Church.' You Brethren\r\nhave fallen away from that Church. You are not true members of the\r\nbody. You are an ulcer. You are a scab. You have no sacraments. You have\r\nwritten bloodthirsty pamphlets against us. We have a whole box full of\r\nyour productions.\"\r\n\r\n\"We never wrote any tracts,\" said Augusta, \"except to show why we\r\nseparated from you, but you urged on the Government against us. You\r\nlikened me to a bastard and to Goliath the Philistine. Your petition\r\nread as if it had been written in a brothel.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the character of John Augusta shone forth in all its grandeur.\r\nThe old man was on his mettle.\r\n\r\n\"Of all Christians known to me,\" he said, \"the Brethren stick closest\r\nto Holy Writ. Next to them come the Lutherans; next to the Lutherans the\r\nUtraquists; and next to the Utraquists the---!\"\r\n\r\nBut there in common honesty he had to stop. And then he turned the\r\ntables on Mystopol, and came out boldly with his scheme. It was no new\r\nidea of his. He had already, in 1547, advocated a National Protestant\r\nChurch composed of Utraquists and Brethren. Instead of the Brethren\r\njoining the Utraquists, it was, said Augusta, the plain duty of the\r\nUtraquists to break from the Church of Rome and join the Brethren. For\r\nthe last forty years the Utraquists had been really Lutherans at heart.\r\nHe wanted them now to be true to their own convictions. He wanted them\r\nto carry out in practice the teaching of most of their preachers. He\r\nwanted them to run the risk of offending the Emperor and the Pope. He\r\nwanted them to ally themselves with the Brethren; and he believed that\r\nif they would only do so nearly every soul in Bohemia would join the\r\nnew Evangelical movement. De Schweinitz says that Augusta betrayed his\r\nBrethren, and that when he called himself a Utraquist he was playing\r\nwith words. I cannot accept this verdict. He explained clearly and\r\nprecisely what he meant; he was a Utraquist in the same sense as Luther;\r\nand the castle he had built in the air was nothing less than a grand\r\ninternational union of all the Evangelical Christians in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"My lords,\" he pleaded in golden words, \"let us cease this mutual\r\naccusation of each other. Let us cease our destructive quarrelling. Let\r\nus join in seeking those higher objects which we both have in common,\r\nand let us remember that we are both of one origin, one nation, one\r\nblood and one spirit. Think of it, dear lords, and try to find some way\r\nto union.\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal was pathetic and sincere. It fell on adders' ears. His scheme\r\nfound favour neither with Brethren nor with Utraquists. To the Brethren\r\nAugusta was a Jesuitical juggler. To the Utraquists he was a supple\r\nathlete trying to dodge his way out of prison.\r\n\r\n\"You shift about,\" wrote the Brethren, \"in a most remarkable manner. You\r\nmake out the Utraquist Church to be different from what it really is, in\r\norder to keep a door open through which you may go.\" In their judgment\r\nhe was nothing less than an ambitious schemer. If his scheme were\r\ncarried out, they said, he would not only be First Elder of the\r\nBrethren's Church, but administrator of the whole united Church.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, King Maximilian interceded with the Emperor in his\r\nfavour, and Augusta was set free on the one condition that he would not\r\npreach in public {1564.}. His hair was white; his beard was long; his\r\nbrow was furrowed; his health was shattered; and he spent his last days\r\namongst the Brethren, a defeated and broken-hearted man. He was\r\nrestored to his old position as First Elder; he settled down again at\r\nJungbunzlau; and yet somehow the old confidence was never completely\r\nrestored. In vain he upheld his daring scheme of union. John Blahoslaw\r\nopposed him to the teeth. For the time, at least, John Blahoslaw was\r\nin the right. Augusta throughout had made one fatal blunder. As the\r\nUtraquists were now more Protestant in doctrine he thought that they\r\nhad begun to love the Brethren. The very contrary was the case. If two\r\npeople agree in nine points out of ten, and only differ in one, they\r\nwill often quarrel more fiercely with each other than if they disagreed\r\nin all the ten. And that was just what happened in Bohemia. The more\r\nProtestant the Utraquists became in doctrine, the more jealous they\r\nwere of the Brethren. And thus Augusta was honoured by neither party.\r\nDespised by friend and foe alike, the old white-haired Bishop tottered\r\nto the silent tomb. \"He kept out of our way,\" says the sad old record,\r\n\"as long as he could; he had been among us long enough.\" As we think\r\nof the noble life he lived, and the bitter gall of his eventide, we may\r\nliken him to one of those majestic mountains which tower in grandeur\r\nunder the noontide sun, but round whose brows the vapours gather as\r\nnight settles down on the earth. In the whole gallery of Bohemian\r\nportraits there is none, says Gindely, so noble in expression as his;\r\nand as we gaze on those grand features we see dignity blended with\r\nsorrow, and pride with heroic fire.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. -- THE GOLDEN AGE, 1572-1603.\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor Maximilian II. set out from the Royal Castle in Prague\r\nfor a drive he met a baron famous in all the land {1575.}. The baron was\r\nJohn von Zerotin, the richest member of the Brethren's Church. He had\r\ncome to Prague on very important business. His home lay at Namiest,\r\nin Moravia. He lived in a stately castle, built on two huge crags, and\r\nsurrounded by the houses of his retainers and domestics. His estate was\r\ntwenty-five miles square. He had a lovely park of beeches, pines and old\r\noaks. He held his court in kingly style. He had gentlemen of the chamber\r\nof noble birth. He had pages and secretaries, equerries and masters\r\nof the chase. He had valets, lackeys, grooms, stable-boys, huntsmen,\r\nbarbers, watchmen, cooks, tailors, shoemakers, and saddlers. He had sat\r\nat the feet of Blahoslaw, the learned Church historian: he kept a Court\r\nChaplain, who was, of course, a pastor of the Brethren's Church; and now\r\nhe had come to talk things over with the head of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor offered the Baron a seat in his carriage. The Brother and\r\nthe Emperor drove on side by side.\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" said the Emperor, \"that the Picards are giving up their\r\nreligion and going over to the Utraquists.\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron was astounded. He had never, he said, heard the slightest\r\nwhisper that the Brethren intended to abandon their own Confessions.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard it,\" said the Emperor, \"as positive fact from Baron\r\nHassenstein himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not true,\" replied Zerotin.\r\n\r\n\"What, then,\" said the Emperor, \"do the Utraquists mean when they say\r\nthat they are the true Hussites, and wish me to protect them in their\r\nreligion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your gracious Majesty,\" replied Zerotin, \"the Brethren, called Picards,\r\nare the true Hussites: they have kept their faith unsullied, as you may\r\nsee yourself from the Confession they presented to you.\"[44]\r\nThe Emperor looked puzzled. He was waxing old and feeble, and his memory\r\nwas failing.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he said, \"have the Picards got a Confession?\"\r\n\r\nHe was soon to hear the real truth of the matter. For some months there\r\nhad sat in Prague a committee of learned divines, who had met for the\r\npurpose of drawing up a National Protestant Bohemian Confession. The\r\ndream of Augusta seemed to be coming true. The Brethren took their\r\npart in the proceedings. \"We are striving,\" said Slawata, one of their\r\ndeputies, \"for peace, love and unity. We have no desire to be censors of\r\ndogmas. We leave such matters to theological experts.\" The Confession[45] was prepared, read out at the Diet, and presented to the Emperor. It\r\nwas a compromise between the teaching of Luther and the teaching of\r\nthe Brethren. In its doctrine of justification by faith it followed the\r\nteaching of Luther: in its doctrine of the Lord's Supper it inclined to\r\nthe broader evangelical view of the Brethren. The Emperor attended the\r\nDiet in person, and made a notable speech.\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" he said, \"on my honour as an Emperor, that I will never\r\noppress or hinder you in the exercise of your religion; and I pledge my\r\nword in my own name and also in the name of my successors.\"\r\n\r\nLet us try to grasp the meaning of this performance. As the Edict of\r\nSt. James was still in force, the Brethren, in the eyes of the law, were\r\nstill heretics and rebels; they had no legal standing in the country;\r\nand at any moment the King in his fury might order them to quit the\r\nland once more. But the truth is that the King of Bohemia was now a mere\r\nfigurehead. The real power lay in the hands of the barons. The barons\r\nwere Protestant almost to a man.\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor lay dying a few months later in the castle of Regensburg,\r\nhe was heard to murmur the words, \"The happy time is come.\" For the\r\nBrethren the happy time had come indeed. They knew that the so-called\r\nUtraquist Church was Utraquist only in name; they knew that the Bible\r\nwas read in every village; they knew that Lutheran doctrines were\r\npreached in hundreds of Utraquist Churches; they knew that in their own\r\ncountry they had now more friends than foes; and thus, free from the\r\nterrors of the law they trod the primrose path of peace and power. We\r\nhave come to the golden age of the Brethren's Church.\r\n\r\nIt was the age of material prosperity. As the sun of freedom shone\r\nupon their way, the Brethren drifted further still from the old Puritan\r\nascetic ideas of Peter and Gregory the Patriarch. They had now all\r\nclasses in their ranks. They had seventeen rich and powerful barons, of\r\nthe stamp of John Zerotin; they had over a hundred and forty knights;\r\nthey had capitalists, flourishing tradesmen, mayors, and even generals\r\nin the Army, and the Lord High Chamberlain now complained that\r\ntwo-thirds of the people in Bohemia were Brethren.[46] Nor was this all.\r\nFor many years the Brethren had been renowned as the most industrious\r\nand prosperous people in the country; and were specially famous for\r\ntheir manufacture of knives. They were noted for their integrity of\r\ncharacter, and were able to obtain good situations as managers of\r\nestates, houses, wine cellars and mills; and in many of the large\r\nsettlements, such as Jungbunzlau and Leitomischl, they conducted\r\nflourishing business concerns for the benefit of the Church at large.\r\nThey made their settlements the most prosperous places in the country;\r\nthey built hospitals; they had a fund for the poor called the Korbona;\r\nand on many estates they made themselves so useful that the barons, in\r\ntheir gratitude, set them free from the usual tolls and taxes. To the\r\nBrethren business was now a sacred duty. They had seen the evils of\r\npoverty, and they did their best to end them. They made no hard and fast\r\ndistinction between secular and sacred; and the cooks and housemaids in\r\nthe Brethren's Houses were appointed by the Church, and called from\r\none sphere of service to another, just as much as the presbyters and\r\ndeacons. The clergy, though still doing manual labour, were now rather\r\nbetter off: the gardens and fields attached to the manses helped to\r\nswell their income; and, therefore, we are not surprised to hear that\r\nsome of them were married.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Brethren were champions of education. They had seen the evil\r\nof their ways. As the exiles banished by Ferdinand I. came into contact\r\nwith Lutherans in Prussia they heard, rather to their disgust, that they\r\nwere commonly regarded by the German Protestants as a narrow-minded and\r\nbenighted set of men; and, therefore, at the special invitation of the\r\nLutheran Bishop Speratus, they began the practice of sending some of\r\ntheir students to foreign universities. It is pathetic to read how\r\nthe first two students were sent {1549.}. \"We granted them,\" says the\r\nrecord, \"their means of support. We gave them £7 10s. a-piece, and sent\r\nthem off to Basle.\" We are not informed how long the money was to last.\r\nFor some years the new policy was fiercely opposed; and the leader\r\nof the opposition was John Augusta. He regarded this new policy with\r\nhorror, condemned it as a falling away from the old simplicity\r\nand piety, and predicted that it would bring about the ruin of the\r\nBrethren's Church. At the head of the progressive party was John\r\nBlahoslaw, the historian. He had been to Wittenberg and Basle himself;\r\nhe was a master of Greek and Latin; and now he wrote a brilliant\r\nphilippic, pouring scorn on the fears of the conservative party. \"For\r\nmy part,\" he said, \"I have no fear that learned and pious men will ever\r\nruin the Church. I am far more afraid of the action of those high-minded\r\nand stupid schemers, who think more highly of themselves than they ought\r\nto think.\" It is clear to whom these stinging words refer. They are a\r\nplain hit at Augusta. \"It is absurd,\" he continued, \"to be afraid of\r\nlearning and culture. As long as our leaders are guided by the Spirit\r\nof Christ, all will be well; but when craft and cunning, and worldly\r\nprudence creep in, then woe to the Brethren's Church! Let us rather be\r\ncareful whom we admit to the ministry, and then the Lord will preserve\r\nus from destruction.\" As we read these biting words, we can understand\r\nhow it came to pass that Augusta, during his last few years, was held\r\nin such little honour. The old man was behind the times. The progressive\r\nparty triumphed. Before long there were forty students at foreign\r\nUniversities. The whole attitude of the Brethren changed. As the\r\nHumanist movement spread in Bohemia, the Brethren began to take an\r\ninterest in popular education; and now, aided by friendly nobles, they\r\nopened a number of free elementary schools. At Eibenschütz, in Moravia,\r\nthey had a school for the sons of the nobility, with Esrom Rüdinger as\r\nheadmaster; both Hebrew and Greek were taught; and the school became\r\nso famous that many of the pupils came from Germany. At Holleschau,\r\nLeitomischl, Landskron, Gross-Bitesch, Austerlitz, Fulneck, Meseretoch,\r\nChropin, Leipnik, Kaunic, Trebitzch, Paskau, Ungarisch-Brod,\r\nJungbunzlau, and Prerau, they had free schools supported by Protestant\r\nnobles and manned with Brethren's teachers. As there is no direct\r\nevidence to the contrary, we may take it for granted that in these\r\nschools the syllabus was much the same as in the other schools of the\r\ncountry. In most the Latin language was taught, and in some dialectics,\r\nrhetoric, physics, astronomy and geometry. The education was largely\r\npractical. At most of the Bohemian schools in those days the children\r\nwere taught, by means of conversation books, how to look after a horse,\r\nhow to reckon with a landlord, how to buy cloth, how to sell a garment,\r\nhow to write a letter, how to make terms with a pedlar, how, in a\r\nword, to get on in the world. But the Brethren laid the chief stress\r\non religion. Instead of separating the secular and the sacred, they\r\ncombined the two in a wonderful way, and taught both at the same time.\r\nFor this purpose, they published, in the first place, a school edition\r\nof their Catechism in three languages, Bohemian, German, and Latin; and\r\nthus the Catechism became the scholar's chief means of instruction. He\r\nlearned to read from his Catechism; he learned Latin from his Catechism;\r\nhe learned German from his Catechism; and thus, while mastering foreign\r\ntongues, he was being grounded at the same time in the articles of\r\nthe Christian faith. He lived, in a word, from morning to night in a\r\nChristian atmosphere. For the same purpose a Brother named Matthias\r\nMartinus prepared a book containing extracts from the Gospels and\r\nEpistles. It was printed in six parallel columns. In the first were\r\ngrammatical notes; in the second the text in Greek; in the third a\r\ntranslation in Bohemian; in the fourth in German; in the fifth in Latin;\r\nand in the sixth a brief exposition.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Brethren used another text-book called the \"Book of Morals.\"\r\nIt was based, apparently, on Erasmus's \"Civilitas Morum.\" It was a\r\nsimple, practical guide to daily conduct. It was written in rhyme, and\r\nthe children learned it by heart. It was divided into three parts. In\r\nthe first, the child was taught how to behave from morning to night; in\r\nthe second, how to treat his elders and masters; in the third, how to be\r\npolite at table.\r\n\r\nThird, the Brethren, in all their schools, made regular use of\r\nhymn-books; and the scholar learnt to sing by singing hymns. Sometimes\r\nthe hymns were in a separate volume; sometimes a selection was bound up\r\nwith the Catechism. But in either case the grand result was the same.\r\nAs we follow the later fortunes of the Brethren we shall find ourselves\r\nface to face with a difficult problem. How was it, we ask, that in later\r\nyears, when their little Church was crushed to powder, these Brethren\r\nheld the faith for a hundred years? How was it that the \"Hidden Seed\"\r\nhad such vitality? How was it that, though forbidden by law, they held\r\nthe fort till the times of revival came? For answer we turn to their\r\nCatechism. They had learned it first in their own homes; they had\r\nlearned it later at school; they had made it the very marrow of their\r\nlife; they taught it in turn to their children; and thus in the darkest\r\nhours of trial they handed on the torch of faith from one generation to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWe come now to another secret of their strength. Of all the Protestants\r\nin Europe the Bohemian Brethren were the first to publish a Hymn-book;\r\nand by this time they had published ten editions. The first three were\r\nin Bohemian, and were edited by Luke of Prague, 1501, 1505, 1519; the\r\nfourth in German, edited by Michael Weiss, 1531; the fifth in Bohemian,\r\nedited by John Horn, 1541; the sixth in German, edited by John Horn,\r\n1544; the seventh in Polish, edited by George Israel, 1554; the eighth\r\nin Bohemian, edited by John Blahoslaw, 1561; the ninth in German, 1566;\r\nthe tenth in Polish, 1569. As they wished here to appeal to all classes,\r\nthey published hymns both ancient and modern, and tunes both grave and\r\ngay. Among the hymn-writers were John Hus, Rockycana, Luke of Prague,\r\nAugusta, and Martin Luther; and among the tunes were Gregorian Chants\r\nand popular rondels of the day. The hymns and tunes were published\r\nin one volume. The chief purpose of the hymns was clear religious\r\ninstruction. The Brethren had nothing to conceal. They had no mysterious\r\nsecret doctrines; and no mysterious secret practices. They published\r\ntheir hymn-books, not for themselves only, but for all the people in the\r\ncountry, and for Evangelical Christians in other lands. \"It has been\r\nour chief aim,\" they said, \"to let everyone fully and clearly understand\r\nwhat our views are with regard to the articles of the Christian faith.\"\r\nAnd here the hymns were powerful preachers of the faith. They spread\r\nthe Brethren's creed in all directions. They were clear, orderly,\r\nsystematic, and Scriptural; and thus they were sung in the family\r\ncircle, by bands of young men in the Brethren's Houses, by shepherds\r\nwatching their flocks by night, by sturdy peasants as they trudged to\r\nmarket. And then, on Sunday, in an age when congregational singing was\r\nas yet but little known, the Brethren made the rafters ring with\r\nthe sound of united praise. \"Your churches,\" wrote the learned Esrom\r\nRüdinger, \"surpass all others in singing. For where else are songs of\r\npraise, of thanksgiving, of prayer and instruction so often heard? Where\r\nis there better singing? The newest edition of the Bohemian Hymn-book,\r\nwith its seven hundred and forty-three hymns, is an evidence of\r\nthe multitude of your songs. Three hundred and forty-six have been\r\ntranslated into German. In your churches the people can all sing and\r\ntake part in the worship of God.\"\r\n\r\nBut of all the services rendered by the Brethren to the cause of the\r\nevangelical faith in Bohemia the noblest and the most enduring was their\r\ntranslation of the Bible into the Bohemian tongue. In the archives of\r\nthe Brethren's Church at Herrnhut are now to be seen six musty\r\nvolumes known as the Kralitz Bible (1579-93). The idea was broached by\r\nBlahoslaw, the Church historian. The expense was born by Baron John\r\nvon Zerotin. The actual printing was executed at Zerotin's Castle at\r\nKralitz. The translation was based, not on the Vulgate, but on the\r\noriginal Hebrew and Greek. The work of translating the Old Testament\r\nwas entrusted to six Hebrew scholars, Aeneas, Cepollo, Streic, Ephraim,\r\nJessen, and Capito. The New Testament was translated by Blahoslaw\r\nhimself (1565). The work was of national interest. For the first time\r\nthe Bohemian people possessed the Bible in a translation from the\r\noriginal tongue, with the chapters subdivided into verses, and the\r\nApocrypha separated from the Canonical Books. The work appeared at first\r\nin cumbersome form. It was issued in six bulky volumes, with only eight\r\nor nine verses to a page, and a running commentary in the margin. The\r\npaper was strong, the binding dark brown, the page quarto, the type\r\nLatin, the style chaste and idiomatic, and the commentary fairly rich in\r\nbroad practical theology. But all this was no use to the poor. For the\r\nbenefit, therefore, of the common people the Brethren published a small\r\nthin paper edition in a plain calf binding. It contained an index of\r\nquotations from the Old Testament in the New, an index of proper names\r\nwith their meanings, a lectionary for the Christian Year, references\r\nin the margin, and a vignette including the famous Brethren's episcopal\r\nseal, \"The Lamb and the Flag.\" The size of the page was only five inches\r\nby seven and a half; the number of pages was eleven hundred and sixty;\r\nthe paper was so remarkably thin that the book was only an inch and a\r\nquarter thick;[47] and thus it was suited in every way to hold the same\r\nplace in the affections of the people that the Geneva Bible held in\r\nEngland in the days of our Puritan fathers. The Kralitz Bible was\r\na masterpiece. It helped to fix and purify the language, and thus\r\ncompleted what Stitny and Hus had begun. It became the model of a chaste\r\nand simple style; and its beauty of language was praised by the Jesuits.\r\nIt is a relic that can never be forgotten, a treasure that can never\r\nlose its value. It is issued now, word for word, by the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society; it is read by the people in their own homes,\r\nand is used in the Protestant Churches of the country; and thus, as the\r\nCatholic, Gindely, says, it will probably endure as long as the Bohemian\r\ntongue is spoken.\r\n\r\nBut even this was not the end of the Brethren's labours. We come to\r\nthe most amazing fact in their history. On the one hand they were the\r\ngreatest literary force in the country;[48] on the other they took the\r\nsmallest part in her theological controversies. For example, take the\r\ncase of John Blahoslaw. He was one of the most brilliant scholars of his\r\nday. He was master of a beautiful literary style. He was a member of\r\nthe Brethren's Inner Council. He wrote a \"History of the Brethren.\"\r\nHe translated the New Testament into Bohemian. He prepared a standard\r\nBohemian Grammar. He wrote also a treatise on Music, and other works too\r\nmany to mention here. And yet, learned Bishop though he was, he wrote\r\nonly one theological treatise, \"Election through Grace,\" and even here\r\nhe handled his subject from a practical rather than a theological point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the case of Jacob Bilek, Augusta's companion in prison. If\r\never a man had just cause to hate the Church of Rome it was surely this\r\nhumble friend of the great Augusta; and yet he wrote a full account of\r\ntheir dreary years in prison without saying one bitter word against\r\nhis persecutors and tormentors.[49] From this point of view his book is\r\ndelightful. It is full of piety, of trust in God, of vivid dramatic\r\ndescription; it has not a bitter word from cover to cover; and thus it\r\nis a beautiful and precious example of the broad and charitable spirit\r\nof the Brethren.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is surely instructive to note what subject most attracted the\r\nBrethren's attention. For religious debate they cared but little; for\r\nhistory they had a consuming passion; and now their leading scholars\r\nproduced the greatest historical works in the language. Brother Jaffet\r\nwrote a work on the Brethren's Episcopal Orders, entitled, \"The Sword\r\nof Goliath.\" Wenzel Brezan wrote a history of the \"House of Rosenberg,\"\r\ncontaining much interesting information about Bohemian social life.\r\nBaron Charles von Zerotin wrote several volumes of memoirs. The whole\r\ninterest of the Brethren now was broad and national in character. The\r\nmore learned they grew the less part they took in theological disputes.\r\nThey regarded such disputes as waste of time; they had no pet doctrines\r\nto defend; they were now in line with the other Protestants of the\r\ncountry; and they held that the soul was greater than the mind and good\r\nconduct best of all. No longer did they issue \"Confessions of Faith\"\r\nof their own; no longer did they lay much stress on their points of\r\ndifference with Luther. We come here to a point of great importance. It\r\nhas been asserted by some historians that the Brethren never taught the\r\ndoctrine of Justification by Faith. For answer we turn to their later\r\nCatechism prepared (1554) by Jirek Gyrck.\r\n\r\n\"In what way,\" ran one question, \"can a sinful man obtain salvation?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the pure Grace of God alone, through Faith in Jesus Christ our Lord\r\nwho of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification\r\nand redemption.\"\r\n\r\nWhat sort of picture does all this bring before us? It is the picture\r\nof a body of men who had made remarkable progress. No longer did they\r\ndespise education; they fostered it more than any men in the country. No\r\nlonger did they speak with contempt of marriage; they spoke of it as\r\na symbol of holier things. It was time, thought some, for these\r\nbroad-minded men to have their due reward. It was time to amend the\r\ninsulting law, and tear the musty Edict of St. James to tatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. -- THE LETTER OF MAJESTY, 1603-1609.\r\n\r\nOf all the members of the Brethren's Church, the most powerful and the\r\nmost discontented was Baron Wenzel von Budowa. He was now fifty-six\r\nyears of age. He had travelled in Germany, Denmark, Holland, England,\r\nFrance and Italy. He had studied at several famous universities. He had\r\nmade the acquaintance of many learned men. He had entered the Imperial\r\nservice, and served as ambassador at Constantinople. He had mastered\r\nTurkish and Arabic, had studied the Mohammedan religion, had published\r\nthe Alcoran in Bohemian, and had written a treatise denouncing the creed\r\nand practice of Islam as Satanic in origin and character. He belonged to\r\nthe Emperor's Privy Council, and also to the Imperial Court of Appeal.\r\nHe took part in theological controversies, and preached sermons to\r\nhis tenants. He was the bosom friend of Baron Charles von Zerotin, the\r\nleading Brother of Moravia. He corresponded, from time to time, with\r\nthe struggling Protestants in Hungary, and had now become the recognised\r\nleader, not only of the Brethren, but of all evangelicals in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nHe had one great purpose to attain. As the Brethren had rendered such\r\nsignal service to the moral welfare of the land, it seemed to him absurd\r\nand unfair that they should still be under the ban of the law and still\r\nbe denounced in Catholic pulpits as children of the devil. He resolved\r\nto remedy the evil. The Emperor, Rudolph II., paved the way. He was just\r\nthe man that Budowa required. He was weak in body and in mind. He had\r\nruined his health, said popular scandal, by indulging in dissolute\r\npleasures. His face was shrivelled, his hair bleached, his back bent,\r\nhis step tottering. He was too much interested in astrology, gems,\r\npictures, horses, antique relics and similar curiosities to take much\r\ninterest in government; he suffered from religious mania, and was\r\nconstantly afraid of being murdered; and his daily hope and prayer was\r\nthat he might be spared all needless trouble in this vexatious world and\r\nhave absolutely nothing to do. And now he committed an act of astounding\r\nfolly. He first revived the Edict of St. James, ordered the nobles\r\nthroughout the land to turn out all Protestant pastors {1602-3.}, and\r\nsent a body of armed men to close the Brethren's Houses at Jungbunzlau;\r\nand then, having disgusted two-thirds of his loyal subjects, he summoned\r\na Diet, and asked for money for a crusade against the Turks. But this\r\nwas more than Wenzel could endure. He attended the Diet, and made a\r\nbrilliant speech. He had nothing, he said, to say against the Emperor.\r\nHe would not blame him for reviving the musty Edict. For that he blamed\r\nsome secret disturbers of the peace. If the Emperor needed money and\r\nmen, the loyal knights and nobles of Bohemia would support him. But that\r\nsupport would be given on certain conditions. If the Emperor wished his\r\nsubjects to be loyal, he must first obey the law of the land himself.\r\n\"We stand,\" he said, \"one and all by the Confession of 1575, and we do\r\nnot know a single person who is prepared to submit to the Consistory at\r\nPrague.\" He finished, wept, prepared a petition, and sent it in to the\r\npoor invisible Rudolph. And Rudolph replied as Emperors sometimes do. He\r\nreplied by closing the Diet.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, six years later, Budowa returned to the attack {1609.}.\r\nHe was acting, not merely on behalf of the Brethren, but on behalf\r\nof all Protestants in the country. And this fact is the key to the\r\nsituation. As we follow the dramatic story to its sad and tragic close,\r\nwe must remember that from this time onward the Brethren, for all\r\nintents and purposes, had almost abandoned their position as a separate\r\nChurch, and had cast in their lot, for good or evil, with the other\r\nProtestants in Bohemia. They were striving now for the recognition, not\r\nof their own Confession of Faith, but of the general Bohemian Protestant\r\nConfession presented to the Emperor, Maximilian II. And thus Budowa\r\nbecame a national hero. He called a meeting of Lutherans and Brethren\r\nin the historic \"Green Saloon,\" prepared a resolution demanding that the\r\nProtestant Confession be inscribed in the Statute Book, and, followed\r\nby a crowd of nobles and knights, was admitted to the sacred presence of\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nAgain the Diet was summoned. The hall was crammed, and knights and\r\nnobles jostled each other in the corridors and in the square outside\r\n{Jan. 28th, 1609.}. For some weeks the Emperor, secluded in his cabinet,\r\nheld to his point like a hero. The debate was conducted in somewhat\r\nmarvellous fashion. There, in the Green Saloon, sat the Protestants,\r\npreparing proposals and petitions. There, in the Archbishop's palace,\r\nsat the Catholics, rather few in number, and wondering what to do.\r\nAnd there, in his chamber, sat the grizzly, rickety, imperial Lion,\r\nconsulting with his councillors, Martinic and Slawata, and dictating his\r\nreplies. And then, when the king had his answer ready, the Diet met in\r\nthe Council Chamber to hear it read aloud. His first reply was now as\r\nsharp as ever. He declared that the faith of the Church of Rome was\r\nthe only lawful faith in Bohemia. \"And as for these Brethren,\" he\r\nsaid, \"whose teaching has been so often forbidden by royal decrees and\r\ndecisions of the Diet, I order them, like my predecessors, to fall in\r\nwith the Utraquists or Catholics, and declare that their meetings shall\r\nnot be permitted on any pretence whatever.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the Protestants, by way of reply, drew up a monster petition,\r\nand set forth their grievances in detail. They suffered, they said, not\r\nfrom actual persecution, but from nasty insults and petty annoyances.\r\nThey were still described in Catholic pulpits as heretics and children\r\nof the devil. They were still forbidden to honour the memory of Hus.\r\nThey were still forbidden to print books without the consent of the\r\nArchbishop. But the King snapped them short. He told the estates to end\r\ntheir babble, and again closed the Diet {March 31st.}.\r\n\r\nThe blood of Budowa was up. The debate, thought he, was fast becoming\r\na farce. The King was fooling his subjects. The King must be taught a\r\nlesson. As the Diet broke up, he stood at the door, and shouted out in\r\nringing tones: \"Let all who love the King and the land, let all who care\r\nfor unity and love, let all who remember the zeal of our fathers, meet\r\nhere at six to-morrow morn.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent the night with some trusty allies, prepared another\r\ndeclaration, met his friends in the morning, and informed the King, in\r\nlanguage clear, that the Protestants had now determined to win their\r\nrights by force. And Budowa was soon true to his word. He sent envoys\r\nasking for help to the King's brother Matthias, to the Elector of\r\nSaxony, to the Duke of Brunswick, and to other Protestant leaders. He\r\ncalled a meeting of nobles and knights in the courtyard of the castle,\r\nand there, with heads bared and right hands upraised, they swore to be\r\ntrue to each other and to win their liberty at any price, even at the\r\nprice of blood. He arranged for an independent meeting in the town\r\nhall of the New Town. The King forbade the meeting. What better place,\r\nreplied Budowa, would His Majesty like to suggest? As he led his\r\nmen across the long Prague bridge, he was followed by thousands of\r\nsupporters. He arrived in due time at the square in front of the hall.\r\nThe Royal Captain appeared and ordered him off. The crowd jeered and\r\nwhistled the Captain away.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Budowa was no vulgar rebel. He insisted that every session in\r\nthe hall should be begun and ended with prayer. He informed the\r\nKing, again and again, that all he wished was liberty of worship for\r\nProtestants. He did his best to put an end to the street rows, the\r\ndrunken brawls, that now disgraced the city.\r\n\r\nFor the third time the King summoned the Diet {May 25th.}. The last\r\nround in the terrible combat now began. He ordered the estates to appear\r\nin civilian's dress. They arrived armed to the teeth. He ordered them to\r\nopen the proceedings by attending Mass in the Cathedral. The Catholics\r\nalone obeyed; the Protestants held a service of their own; and yet,\r\ndespite these danger signals, the King was as stubborn as ever, and\r\nagain he sent a message to say that he held to his first decision. The\r\nDiet was thunderstruck, furious, desperate.\r\n\r\n\"We have had enough of useless talk,\" said Count Matthias Thurn; \"it is\r\ntime to take to arms.\" The long fight was drawing to a finish. As the\r\nKing refused to listen to reason, the members of the Diet, one and all,\r\nProtestants and Catholics alike, prepared an ultimatum demanding that\r\nall evangelical nobles, knights, citizens and peasants should have\r\nfull and perfect liberty to worship God in their own way, and to build\r\nschools and churches on all Royal estates; and, in order that the King\r\nmight realise the facts of the case, Budowa formed a Board of thirty\r\ndirectors, of whom fourteen were Brethren, raised an army in Prague, and\r\nsent the nobles flying through the land to levy money and troops. The\r\ncountry, in fact, was now in open revolt. And thus, at length compelled\r\nby brute force, the poor old King gave way, and made his name famous\r\nin history by signing the Letter of Majesty and granting full religious\r\nliberty to all adherents of the Bohemian National Protestant Confession.\r\nAll adherents of the Confession could worship as they pleased, and all\r\nclasses, except the peasantry, could build schools and churches on Royal\r\nestates {July 9th.}. \"No decree of any kind,\" ran one sweeping clause,\r\n\"shall be issued either by us or by our heirs and succeeding kings\r\nagainst the above established religious peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe delight in Prague was boundless. The Letter of Majesty was carried\r\nthrough the streets in grand triumphal procession. The walls were\r\nadorned with flaming posters. The bells of the churches were rung. The\r\npeople met in the Church of the Holy Cross, and there sang jubilant\r\npsalms of thanksgiving and praise. The King's couriers posted through\r\nthe land to tell the gladsome news; the letter was hailed as the\r\nheavenly herald of peace and goodwill to men; and Budowa was adored as a\r\nnational hero, and the redresser of his people's wrongs.\r\n\r\nBut the work of the Diet was not yet complete. As the Brethren, led by\r\nthe brave Budowa, had borne the brunt of the battle, we naturally expect\r\nto find that now the victory was won, they would have the lion's share\r\nof the spoils. But they really occupied a rather modest position. The\r\nnext duty of the Diet was to make quite sure that the Letter of\r\nMajesty would not be broken. For this purpose they elected a Board of\r\nTwenty-four Defenders, and of these Defenders only eight were Brethren.\r\nAgain, the Brethren had now to submit to the rule of a New National\r\nProtestant Consistory. Of that Consistory the Administrator was a\r\nUtraquist Priest; the next in rank was a Brethren's Bishop; the total\r\nnumber of members was twelve; and of these twelve only three were\r\nBrethren. If the Brethren, therefore, were fairly represented, they\r\nmust have constituted at this time about one-quarter or one-third of the\r\nProtestants in Bohemia.[50] They were now a part, in the eyes of the\r\nlaw, of the National Protestant Church. They were known as Utraquist\r\nChristians. They accepted the National Confession as their own standard\r\nof faith, and though they could still ordain their own priests, their\r\ncandidates for the priesthood had first to be examined by the national\r\nAdministrator.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, the Brethren had now weakened their union with the\r\nMoravian and Polish branches. No longer did the three parts of the\r\nChurch stand upon the same footing. In Poland the Brethren were still\r\nthe leading body; in Moravia they were still independent; in Bohemia\r\nalone they bowed to the rule of others. And yet, in some important\r\nrespects, they were still as independent as ever. They could still hold\r\ntheir own Synods and practise their own ceremonies; they still retained\r\ntheir own Confession of faith; they could still conduct their own\r\nschools and teach their Catechism; and they could still, above all,\r\nenforce as of old their system of moral discipline. And this they\r\nguarded as the apple of their eye.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the above arrangements were complete they addressed\r\nthemselves to the important task of defining their own position. And\r\nfor this purpose they met at a General Synod at Zerawic, and prepared\r\na comprehensive descriptive work, entitled \"Ratio Disciplinæ\"--i.e.,\r\nAccount of Discipline.[51] It was a thorough, exhaustive, orderly code\r\nof rules and regulations. It was meant as a guide and a manifesto. It\r\nproved to be an epitaph. In the second place, the Brethren now issued\r\n(1615) a new edition of their Catechism, with the questions and answers\r\nin four parallel columns--Greek, Bohemian, German and Latin;[52] and\r\nthus, once more, they shewed their desire to play their part in national\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThus, at last, had the Brethren gained their freedom. They had crossed\r\nthe Red Sea, had traversed the wilderness, had smitten the Midianites\r\nhip and thigh, and could now settle down in the land of freedom flowing\r\nwith milk and honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. -- THE DOWNFALL, 1616-1621.\r\n\r\nThe dream of bliss became a nightmare. As the tide of Protestantism\r\nebbed and flowed in various parts of the Holy Roman Empire, so the\r\nfortunes of the Brethren ebbed and flowed in the old home of their\r\nfathers. We have seen how the Brethren rose to prosperity and power.\r\nWe have now to see what brought about their ruin. It was nothing in the\r\nmoral character of the Brethren themselves. It was purely and simply\r\ntheir geographical position. If Bohemia had only been an island, as\r\nShakespeare seems to have thought it was, it is more than likely that\r\nthe Church of the Brethren would have flourished there down to the\r\npresent day. But Bohemia lay in the very heart of European politics; the\r\nKing was always a member of the House of Austria; the House of Austria\r\nwas the champion of the Catholic faith, and the Brethren now were\r\ncrushed to powder in the midst of that mighty European conflict known as\r\nthe Thirty Years' War. We note briefly the main stages of the process.\r\n\r\nThe first cause was the rising power of the Jesuits. For the last fifty\r\nyears these zealous men had been quietly extending their influence in\r\nthe country. They had built a magnificent college in Prague. They had\r\nestablished a number of schools for the common people. They had obtained\r\npositions as tutors in noble families. They went about from village to\r\nvillage, preaching, sometimes in the village churches and sometimes\r\nin the open air; and one of their number, Wenzel Sturm, had written an\r\nexhaustive treatise denouncing the doctrines of the Brethren. But now\r\nthese Jesuits used more violent measures. They attacked the Brethren\r\nin hot, abusive language. They declared that the wives of Protestant\r\nministers were whores. They denounced their children as bastards.\r\nThey declared that it was better to have the devil in the house than a\r\nProtestant woman. And the more they preached, and the more they wrote,\r\nthe keener the party feeling in Bohemia grew.\r\n\r\nThe next cause was the Letter of Majesty itself. As soon as that Letter\r\nwas closely examined, a flaw was found in the crystal. We come to\r\nwhat has been called the \"Church Building Difficulty.\" It was clearly\r\nprovided in one clause of the Letter of Majesty that the Protestants\r\nshould have perfect liberty to build churches on all Royal estates. But\r\nnow arose the difficult question, what were Royal estates? What about\r\nRoman Catholic Church estates? What about estates held by Catholic\r\nofficials as tenants of the King? Were these Royal estates or were\r\nthey not? There were two opinions on the subject. According to the\r\nProtestants they were; according to the Jesuits they were not; and now\r\nthe Jesuits used this argument to influence the action of Matthias, the\r\nnext King of Bohemia. The dispute soon came to blows. At Klostergrab\r\nthe land belonged to the Catholic Archbishop of Prague; at Brunau it\r\nbelonged to the Abbot of Brunau; and yet, on each of these estates, the\r\nProtestants had churches. They believed, of course, that they were in\r\nthe right. They regarded those estates as Royal estates. They had no\r\ndesire to break the law of the land. But now the Catholics began\r\nto force the pace. At Brunau the Abbot interfered and turned the\r\nProtestants out of the church. At Klostergrab the church was pulled\r\ndown, and the wood of which it was built was used as firewood; and in\r\neach case the new King, Matthias, took the Catholic side. The truth\r\nis, Matthias openly broke the Letter. He broke it on unquestioned Royal\r\nestates. He expelled Protestant ministers from their pulpits, and put\r\nCatholics in their place. His officers burst into Protestant churches\r\nand interrupted the services; and, in open defiance of the law of the\r\nland, the priests drove Protestants with dogs and scourges to the\r\nMass, and thrust the wafer down their mouths. What right, said the\r\nProtestants, had the Catholics to do these things? The Jesuits had an\r\namazing answer ready. For two reasons, they held, the Letter of Majesty\r\nwas invalid. It was invalid because it had been obtained by force, and\r\ninvalid because it had not been sanctioned by the Pope. What peace could\r\nthere be with these conflicting views? It is clear that a storm was\r\nbrewing.\r\n\r\nThe third cause was the famous dispute about the Kingship. As Matthias\r\nwas growing old and feeble, it was time to choose his successor; and\r\nMatthias, therefore, summoned a Diet, and informed the Estates, to their\r\ngreat surprise, that all they had to do now was to accept as King\r\nhis adopted son, Ferdinand Archduke of Styria. At first the Diet was\r\nthunderstruck. They had met to choose their own King. They intended\r\nto choose a Protestant, and now they were commanded to choose this\r\nFerdinand, the most zealous Catholic in Europe. And yet, for some\r\nmysterious reason, the Diet actually yielded. They surrendered their\r\nelective rights; they accepted Ferdinand as King, and thus, at the most\r\ncritical and dangerous point in the whole history of the country, they\r\nallowed a Catholic devotee to become the ruler of a Protestant people.\r\nFor that fatal mistake they had soon to pay in full. Some say they were\r\nfrightened by threats; some say that the Diet was summoned in a hurry,\r\nand that only a few attended. The truth is, they were completely\r\noutwitted. At this point the Protestant nobles of Bohemia showed that\r\nfatal lack of prompt and united action which was soon to fill the whole\r\nland with all the horrors of war. In vain Budowa raised a vehement\r\nprotest. He found but few to support him. If the Protestants desired\r\npeace and good order in Bohemia, they ought to have insisted upon their\r\nrights and elected a Protestant King; and now, in Ferdinand, they had\r\naccepted a man who was pledged to fight for the Church of Rome with\r\nevery breath of his body. He was a man of fervent piety. He was a pupil\r\nof the Jesuits. He regarded himself as the divinely appointed champion\r\nof the Catholic faith. He had already stamped out the Protestants in\r\nStyria. He had a strong will and a clear conception of what he regarded\r\nas his duty. He would rather, he declared, beg his bread from door to\r\ndoor, with his family clinging affectionately around him, than allow\r\na single Protestant in his dominions. \"I would rather,\" he said, \"rule\r\nover a wilderness than over heretics.\" But what about his oath to\r\nobserve the Letter of Majesty? Should he take the oath or not? If he\r\ntook it he would be untrue to his conscience; if he refused he could\r\nnever be crowned King of Bohemia. He consulted his friends the Jesuits.\r\nThey soon eased his conscience. It was wicked, they said, of Rudolph\r\nII. to sign such a monstrous document; but it was not wicked for the\r\nnew King to take the oath to keep it. And, therefore, Ferdinand took the\r\noath, and was crowned King of Bohemia. \"We shall now see,\" said a lady\r\nat the ceremony, \"whether the Protestants are to rule the Catholics or\r\nthe Catholics the Protestants.\"\r\n\r\nShe was right. Forthwith the Protestants realised their blunder, and\r\nmade desperate efforts to recover the ground they had lost. Now was the\r\ntime for the Twenty-four Defenders to arise and do their duty; now was\r\nthe time, now or never, to make the Letter no longer a grinning mockery.\r\nThey began by acting strictly according to law. They had been empowered\r\nto summon representatives of the Protestant Estates. They summoned their\r\nassembly, prepared a petition, and sent it off to Matthias. He replied\r\nthat their assembly was illegal. He refused to remedy their grievances.\r\nThe Defenders were goaded to fury. At their head was a violent man,\r\nHenry Thurn. He resolved on open rebellion. He would have the new King\r\nFerdinand dethroned and have his two councillors, Martinic and Slawata,\r\nput to death. It was the 23rd of May, 1618. At an early hour on that\r\nfatal day, the Protestant Convention met in the Hradschin, and then,\r\na little later, the fiery Thurn sallied out with a body of armed\r\nsupporters, arrived at the Royal Castle, and forced his way into the\r\nRegent's Chamber, where the King's Councillors were assembled. There, in\r\na corner, by the stove sat Martinic and Slawata. There, in that Regent's\r\nChamber, began the cause of all the woe that followed. There was struck\r\nthe first blow of the Thirty Years' War. As Thurn and his henchmen stood\r\nin the presence of the two men, who, in their opinion, had done the most\r\nto poison the mind of Matthias, they felt that the decisive moment\r\nhad come. The interview was stormy. Voices rang in wild confusion. The\r\nProtestant spokesman was Paul von Rican. He accused Martinic and Slawata\r\nof two great crimes. They had openly broken the Letter of Majesty, and\r\nhad dictated King Matthias's last reply. He appealed to his supporters\r\ncrowded into the corridor outside.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye,\" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Into the Black Tower with them,\" said some.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Rupow, a member of the Brethren's Church, \"out of the\r\nwindow with them, in the good old Bohemian fashion.\"\r\n\r\nAt this signal, agreed upon before, Martinic was dragged to the window.\r\nHe begged for a father confessor.\r\n\r\n\"Commend thy soul to God,\" said someone. \"Are we to allow any Jesuit\r\nscoundrels here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus! Mary!\" he screamed.\r\n\r\nHe was flung headlong from the window. He clutched at the window-sill.\r\nA blow came down on his hands. He had to leave go, and down he fell,\r\nseventy feet, into the moat below.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" said someone, \"whether his Mary will help him.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell on a heap of soft rubbish. He scrambled away with only a wound\r\nin the head.\r\n\r\n\"By God,\" said one of the speakers, \"his Mary has helped him.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point the conspirators appear to have lost their heads. As\r\nMartinic had not been killed by his fall, it was absurd to treat Slawata\r\nin the same way; and yet they now flung him out of the window, and his\r\nsecretary Fabricius after him. Not one of the three was killed, not one\r\nwas even maimed for life, and through the country the rumour spread that\r\nall three had been delivered by the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n>From that moment war was inevitable. As the details of the struggle do\r\nnot concern us, it will be enough to state here that the Defenders now,\r\nin slipshod fashion, began to take a variety of measures to maintain the\r\nProtestant cause. They formed a national Board of Thirty Directors. They\r\nassessed new taxes to maintain the war, but never took the trouble to\r\ncollect them. They relied more on outside help than on their own united\r\naction. They deposed Ferdinand II.; they elected Frederick, Elector\r\nPalatine, and son-in-law of James I. of England, as King of Bohemia; and\r\nthey ordered the Jesuits out of the kingdom. There was a strange scene\r\nin Prague when these Jesuits departed. They formed in procession in\r\nthe streets, and, clad in black, marched off with bowed heads and loud\r\nwailings; and when their houses were examined they were found full of\r\ngunpowder and arms. For the moment the Protestants of Prague were wild\r\nwith joy. In the great Cathedral they pulled off the ornaments and\r\ndestroyed costly pictures. What part did the Brethren play in these\r\nabominations? We do not know. At this tragic point in their fateful\r\nstory our evidence is so lamentably scanty that it is absolutely\r\nimpossible to say what part they played in the revolution. But one thing\r\nat least we know without a doubt. We know that the Catholics were now\r\nunited and the Protestants quarrelling with each other; we know that\r\nFerdinand was prompt and vigorous, and the new King Frederick stupid and\r\nslack; and we know, finally, that the Catholic army, commanded by the\r\nfamous general Tilly, was far superior to the Protestant army under\r\nChristian of Anhalt. At last the Catholic army appeared before the walls\r\nof Prague. The battle of the White Hill was fought (November 8th, 1620).\r\nThe new King, in the city, was entertaining some ambassadors to dinner.\r\nThe Protestant army was routed, the new King fled from the country, and\r\nonce again Bohemia lay crushed under the heel of the conqueror.\r\n\r\nAt this time the heel of the conqueror consisted in a certain Prince\r\nLichtenstein. He was made regent of Prague, and was entrusted with the\r\nduty of restoring the country to order. He set about his work in a cool\r\nand methodical manner. He cleared the rabble out of the streets. He\r\nrecalled the Jesuits. He ordered the Brethren out of the kingdom. He put\r\na Roman Catholic Priest into every church in Prague; and then he made\r\nthe strange announcement that all the rebels, as they were called, would\r\nbe freely pardoned, and invited the leading Protestant nobles to appear\r\nbefore him at Prague. They walked into the trap like flies into a\r\ncobweb. If the nobles had only cared to do so, they might all have\r\nescaped after the battle of the White Hill; for Tilly, the victorious\r\ngeneral, had purposely given them time to do so. But for some reason\r\nthey nearly all preferred to stay. And now Lichtenstein had them in his\r\ngrasp. He had forty-seven leaders arrested in one night. He imprisoned\r\nthem in the castle tower, had them tried and condemned, obtained the\r\napproval of Ferdinand, and then, while some were pardoned, informed the\r\nremaining twenty-seven that they had two days in which to prepare for\r\ndeath. They were to die on June 21st. Among those leaders about a dozen\r\nwere Brethren. We have arrived at the last act of the tragedy. We have\r\nseen the grim drama develop, and when the curtain falls the stage will\r\nbe covered with corpses and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. -- THE DAY OF BLOOD AT PRAGUE.\r\n\r\nThe City of Prague was divided into two parts, the Old Town and the New\r\nTown. In the middle of the Old Town was a large open space, called the\r\nGreat Square. On the west side of the Great Square stood the Council\r\nHouse, on the east the old Thein Church. The condemned prisoners, half\r\nof whom were Brethren, were in the Council House: in front of their\r\nwindow was the scaffold, draped in black cloth, twenty feet high,\r\nand twenty-two yards square; from the window they stepped out on to\r\na balcony, and from the balcony to the scaffold ran a short flight of\r\nsteps. In that Great Square, and on that scaffold, we find the scene of\r\nour story.\r\n\r\nWhen early in the morning of Monday, June 21st, the assembled prisoners\r\nlooked out of the windows of their rooms to take their last view of\r\nearth, they saw a splendid, a brilliant, a gorgeous, but to them a\r\nterrible scene {1621.}. They saw God's sun just rising in the east and\r\nreddening the sky and shining in each other's faces; they saw the dark\r\nblack scaffold bathed in light, and the squares of infantry and cavalry\r\nranged around it; they saw the eager, excited throng, surging and\r\nswaying in the Square below and crowding on the house-tops to right and\r\nleft; and they saw on the further side of the square the lovely twin\r\ntowers of the old Thein Church, where Gregory had knelt and Rockycana\r\nhad preached in the brave days of old. As the church clocks chimed\r\nthe hour of five a gun was fired from the castle; the prisoners were\r\ninformed that their hour had come, and were ordered to prepare for\r\ntheir doom; and Lichtenstein and the magistrates stepped out on to the\r\nbalcony, an awning above them to screen them from the rising sun. The\r\nlast act of the tragedy opened.\r\n\r\nAs there was now a long morning's work to be done, that work was begun\r\nat once; and as the heads of the martyrs fell off the block in quick\r\nsuccession the trumpets brayed and the drums beat an accompaniment. Grim\r\nand ghastly was the scene in that Great Square in Prague, on that bright\r\nJune morning well nigh three hundred years ago. There fell the flower of\r\nthe Bohemian nobility; and there was heard the swan song of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren. As the sun rose higher in the eastern sky and shone on the\r\nwindows of the Council House, the sun of the Brethren's pride and power\r\nwas setting in a sea of blood; and clear athwart the lingering light\r\nstood out, for all mankind to see, the figures of the last defenders of\r\ntheir freedom and their faith. Among the number not one had shown the\r\nwhite feather in prospect of death. Not a cheek was blanched, not\r\na voice faltered as the dread hour drew near. One and all they had\r\nfortified themselves to look the waiting angel of death in the face.\r\nAs they sat in their rooms the evening before--a sabbath evening it\r\nwas--they had all, in one way or another, drawn nigh to God in prayer.\r\nIn one room the prisoners had taken the Communion together, in another\r\nthey joined in singing psalms and hymns; in another they had feasted\r\nin a last feast of love. Among these were various shades of\r\nfaith--Lutherans, Calvinists, Utraquists, Brethren; but now all\r\ndifferences were laid aside, for all was nearly over now. One laid the\r\ncloth, and another the plates; a third brought water and a fourth said\r\nthe simple grace. As the night wore on they lay down on tables and\r\nbenches to snatch a few hours of that troubled sleep which gives no\r\nrest. At two they were all broad awake again, and again the sound of\r\npsalms and hymns was heard; and as the first gleams of light appeared\r\neach dressed himself as though for a wedding, and carefully turned down\r\nthe ruffle of his collar so as to give the executioner no extra trouble.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, in order, and without much cruelty the gory work was done. The\r\nmorning's programme had all been carefully arranged. At each corner of\r\nthe square was a squad of soldiers to hold the people in awe, and\r\nto prevent an attempt at rescue. One man, named Mydlar, was the\r\nexecutioner; and, being a Protestant, he performed his duties with as\r\nmuch decency and humanity as possible. He used four different swords,\r\nand was paid about £100 for his morning's work. With his first sword he\r\nbeheaded eleven; with his second, five; with his two last, eight. The\r\nfirst of these swords is still to be seen at Prague, and has the names\r\nof its eleven victims engraven upon it. Among these names is the name of\r\nWenzel von Budowa. In every instance Mydlar seems to have done his\r\nduty at one blow. At his side stood an assistant, and six masked men in\r\nblack. As soon as Mydlar had severed the neck, the assistant placed\r\nthe dead man's right hand on the block; the sword fell again; the hand\r\ndropped at the wrist; and the men in black, as silent as night, gathered\r\nup the bleeding members, wrapped them in clean black cloth, and swiftly\r\nbore them away.\r\n\r\nThe name of Budowa was second on the list. As many of the records of the\r\ntime were destroyed by fire, we are not able to tell in full what part\r\nBudowa had played in the great revolt. He had, however, been a leader\r\non the conquered side. He had fought, as we know, for the Letter of\r\nMajesty; he had bearded Rudolph II. in his den; he had openly opposed\r\nthe election of Ferdinand II.; he had welcomed Frederick, the Protestant\r\nWinter King, at the city gates; and, therefore, he was justly regarded\r\nby Ferdinand as a champion of the Protestant national faith and an enemy\r\nof the Catholic Church and throne. As he was now over seventy years of\r\nage it is hardly likely that he had fought on the field of battle. After\r\nthe battle of the White Mountain he had retired with his family to his\r\ncountry estate. He had then, strange to say, been one of those entrapped\r\ninto Prague by Lichtenstein, and had been imprisoned in the White Tower.\r\nThere he was tried and condemned as a rebel, and there, as even Gindely\r\nadmits, he bore himself like a hero to the last. At first, along with\r\nsome other nobles, he signed a petition to the Elector of Saxony,\r\nimploring him to intercede with the Emperor on their behalf. The\r\npetition received no answer. He resigned himself to his fate. He was\r\nasked why he had walked into the lion's den. For some reason that I fail\r\nto understand Gindely says that what we are told about the conduct of\r\nthe prisoners has only a literary interest. To my mind the last words of\r\nWenzel of Budowa are of the highest historical importance. They show how\r\nthe fate of the Brethren's Church was involved in the fate of Bohemia.\r\nHe had come to Prague as a patriot and as a Brother. He was dying both\r\nfor his country and for his Church.\r\n\r\n\"My heart impelled me to come,\" he said; \"to forsake my country and its\r\ncause would have been sinning against my conscience. Here am I, my God,\r\ndo unto Thy servant as seemeth good unto Thee. I would rather die myself\r\nthan see my country die.\"\r\n\r\nAs he sat in his room on the Saturday evening--two days before the\r\nexecution--he was visited by two Capuchin monks. He was amazed at their\r\nboldness. As they did not understand Bohemian, the conversation was\r\nconducted in Latin. They informed him that their visit was one of pity.\r\n\r\n\"Of pity?\" asked the white-haired old Baron, \"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"We wish to show your lordship the way to heaven.\" He assured them that\r\nhe knew the way and stood on firm ground.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord only imagines,\" they rejoined, \"that he knows the way of\r\nsalvation. He is mistaken. Not being a member of the Holy Church, he has\r\nno share in the Church's salvation.\"\r\n\r\nBut Budowa placed his trust in Christ alone.\r\n\r\n\"I have this excellent promise,\" he said, \"Whosoever believeth in Him\r\nshall not perish but have everlasting life. Therefore, until my last\r\nmoment, will I abide by our true Church.\"\r\n\r\nThus did Budowa declare the faith of the Brethren. The Capuchin monks\r\nwere horrified. They smote their breasts, declared that so hardened a\r\nheretic they had never seen, crossed themselves repeatedly, and left him\r\nsadly to his fate.\r\n\r\nFor the last time, on the Monday morning, he was given another chance to\r\ndeny his faith. Two Jesuits came to see him.\r\n\r\n\"We have come to save my lord's soul,\" they said, \"and to perform a work\r\nof mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear fathers,\" replied Budowa, \"I thank my God that His Holy Spirit\r\nhas given me the assurance that I will be saved through the blood of\r\nthe Lamb.\" He appealed to the words of St. Paul: \"I know whom I have\r\nbelieved: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,\r\nwhich the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Jesuits, \"Paul there speaks of himself, not of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie,\" said Budowa, \"for does he not expressly add: 'and not to me\r\nonly, but unto all them also that love his appearing.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a little more argumentation, the Jesuits left in disgust.\r\n\r\nThe last moment in Budowa's life now arrived. The messenger came and\r\ntold him it was his turn to die. He bade his friends farewell.\r\n\r\n\"I go,\" he declared, \"in the garment of righteousness; thus arrayed\r\nshall I appear before God.\"\r\n\r\nAlone, with firm step he strode to the scaffold, stroking proudly his\r\nsilver hair and beard.\r\n\r\n\"Thou old grey head of mine,\" said he, \"thou art highly honoured; thou\r\nshalt be adorned with the Martyr-Crown.\"\r\n\r\nAs he knelt and prayed he was watched by the pitying eyes of the two\r\nkind-hearted Jesuits who had come to see him that morning. He prayed for\r\nhis country, for his Church, for his enemies, and committed his soul\r\nto Christ; the sword flashed brightly in the sun; and one strong\r\nblow closed the restless life of Wenzel von Budowa, the \"Last of the\r\nBohemians.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with his death there came the death of the Ancient Church of the\r\nBrethren. From the moment when Budowa's hoary head fell from the block\r\nthe destruction of the Church was only a question of time. As Budowa\r\ndied, so died the others after him. We have no space to tell here in\r\ndetail how his bright example was followed; how nearly all departed with\r\nthe words upon their lips, \"Into Thy hands I commend my spirit\"; how the\r\ndrums beat louder each time before the sword fell, that the people might\r\nnot hear the last words of triumphant confidence in God; how Caspar\r\nKaplir, an old man of eighty-six, staggered up to the scaffold arrayed\r\nin a white robe, which he called his wedding garment, but was so weak\r\nthat he could not hold his head to the block; how Otto von Los looked\r\nup and said, \"Behold I see the heavens opened\"; how Dr. Jessen, the\r\ntheologian, had his tongue seized with a pair of tongs, cut off at the\r\nroots with a knife, and died with the blood gushing from his mouth; how\r\nthree others were hanged on a gallows in the Square; how the fearful\r\nwork went steadily on till the last head had fallen, and the black\r\nscaffold sweated blood; and how the bodies of the chiefs were flung\r\ninto unconsecrated ground, and their heads spitted on poles in the\r\ncity, there to grin for full ten years as a warning to all who held the\r\nProtestant faith. In all the story of the Brethren's Church there has\r\nbeen no other day like that. It was the day when the furies seemed to\r\nride triumphant in the air, when the God of their fathers seemed to\r\nmock at the trial of the innocent, and when the little Church that had\r\nbattled so bravely and so long was at last stamped down by the heel of\r\nthe conqueror, till the life-blood flowed no longer in her veins.\r\n\r\nNot, indeed, till the last breath of Church life had gone did the\r\nfearful stamping cease. The zeal of Ferdinand knew no bounds. He was\r\ndetermined, not only to crush the Brethren, but to wipe their memory\r\nfrom off the face of the earth. He regarded the Brethren as a noisome\r\npest. Not a stone did he and his servants leave unturned to destroy\r\nthem. They began with the churches. Instead of razing them to the\r\nground, which would, of course, have been wanton waste, they turned them\r\ninto Roman Catholic Chapels by the customary methods of purification and\r\nrededication. They rubbed out the inscriptions on the walls, and put\r\nnew ones in their places, lashed the pulpits with whips, beat the altars\r\nwith sticks, sprinkled holy water to cleanse the buildings of heresy,\r\nopened the graves and dishonoured the bones of the dead. Where once was\r\nthe cup for Communion was now the image of the Virgin. Where once\r\nthe Brethren had sung their hymns and read their Bibles were now the\r\nConfessional and the Mass.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Brethren had been expelled from Bohemia. It is a striking\r\nproof of the influence of the Brethren that Ferdinand turned his\r\nattention to them before he troubled about the other Protestants. They\r\nhad been the first in moral power; they had done the most to spread the\r\nknowledge of the Bible; they had produced the greatest literary men\r\nof the country; and, therefore, now they must be the first to go. What\r\nactually happened to many of the Brethren during the next few years\r\nno tongue can tell. But we know enough. We know that Ferdinand cut the\r\nLetter of Majesty in two with his scissors. We know that thirty-six\r\nthousand families left Bohemia and Moravia, and that the population of\r\nBohemia dwindled from three millions to one. We know that about one-half\r\nof the property--lands, houses, castles, churches--passed over into the\r\nhands of the King. We know that the University of Prague was handed over\r\nto the Jesuits. We know that the scandalous order was issued that all\r\nProtestant married ministers who consented to join the Church of Rome\r\nmight keep their wives by passing them off as cooks. We know that\r\nvillages were sacked; that Kralitz Bibles, Hymn-books, Confessions,\r\nCatechisms, and historical works of priceless value--among others\r\nBlahoslaw's \"History of the Brethren\"--were burned in thousand; and that\r\nthus nearly every trace of the Brethren was swept out of the land. We\r\nknow that some of the Brethren were hacked in pieces, that some were\r\ntortured, that some were burned alive, that some swung on gibbets at the\r\ncity gates and at the country cross-roads among the carrion crows. For\r\nsix years Bohemia was a field of blood, and Spanish soldiers, drunk and\r\nraging, slashed and pillaged on every hand. \"Oh, to what torments,\" says\r\na clergyman of that day, \"were the promoters of the Gospel exposed!\r\nHow they were tortured and massacred! How many virgins were violated to\r\ndeath! How many respectable women abused! How many children torn from\r\ntheir mothers' breasts and cut in pieces in their presence! How many\r\ndragged from their beds and thrown naked from the windows! Good God!\r\nWhat cries of woe we were forced to hear from those who lay upon the\r\nrack, and what groans and terrible outcries from those who besought the\r\nrobbers to spare them for God's sake.\" It was thus that the Brethren, at\r\nthe point of the sword, were driven from hearth and home: thus that\r\nthey fled before the blast and took refuge in foreign lands; thus,\r\namid bloodshed, and crime, and cruelty, and nameless torture, that the\r\nAncient Church of the Bohemian Brethren bade a sad farewell to the land\r\nof its birth, and disappeared from the eyes of mankind.\r\n\r\nLet us review the story of that wonderful Church. What a marvellous\r\nchange had come upon it! It began in the quiet little valley of Kunwald:\r\nit ended in the noisy streets of Prague. It began in peace and brotherly\r\nlove: it ended amid the tramp of horses, the clank of armour, the swish\r\nof swords, the growl of artillery, the whistle of bullets, the blare of\r\ntrumpets, the roll of drums, and the moans of the wounded and the dying.\r\nIt began in the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount: it ended amid the\r\nghastly horrors of war. What was it that caused the destruction of\r\nthat Church? At this point some historians, being short of facts, have\r\nthought fit to indulge in philosophical reflections; and, following\r\nthe stale philosophy of Bildad--that all suffering is the punishment of\r\nsin--have informed us that the Brethren were now the victims of internal\r\nmoral decay. They had lost, we are told, their sense of unity; they had\r\nrelaxed their discipline; they had become morally weak; and the day of\r\ntheir external prosperity was the day of their internal decline. For\r\nthis pious and utterly unfounded opinion the evidence usually summoned\r\nis the fact that Bishop Amos Comenius, in a sermon entitled \"Haggai\r\nRedivivus,\" had some rather severe remarks to make about the sins of his\r\nBrethren. But Bishops' sermons are dangerous historical evidence. It is\r\nnot the business of a preacher to tell the whole truth in one discourse.\r\nHe is not a witness in the box; he is a prophet aiming at some special\r\nmoral reform. If a Bishop is lecturing his Brethren for their failings\r\nhe is sure to indulge, not exactly in exaggeration, but in one-sided\r\nstatements of the facts. He will talk at length about the sins, and\r\nsay nothing about the virtues. It is, of course, within the bounds of\r\npossibility that when the Brethren became more prosperous they were not\r\nso strict in some of their rules as they had been in earlier days; and\r\nit is also true that when Wenzel von Budowa summoned his followers to\r\narms, the deed was enough, as one writer remarks, to make Gregory the\r\nPatriarch groan in his grave. But of any serious moral decline there\r\nis no solid proof. It is absurd to blame the Brethren for mixing in\r\npolitics, and absurd to say that this mixing was the cause of their\r\nruin. At that time in Bohemia religion and politics were inseparable. If\r\na man took a definite stand in religion he took thereby a definite stand\r\nin politics. To be a Protestant was to be a rebel. If Budowa had never\r\nlifted a finger, the destruction of the Brethren would have been no less\r\ncomplete. The case of Baron Charles von Zerotin proves the point. He\r\ntook no part in the rebellion; he sided, in the war, with the House of\r\nHapsburg; he endeavoured, that is, to remain a Protestant and yet at\r\nthe same time a staunch supporter of Ferdinand; and yet, loyal subject\r\nthough he was, he was not allowed, except for a few years, to shelter\r\nProtestant ministers in his castle, and had finally to sell his estates\r\nand to leave the country. At heart, Comenius had a high opinion of his\r\nBrethren. For nearly fifty weary years--as we shall see in the next\r\nchapter--this genius and scholar longed and strove for the revival\r\nof the Brethren's Church, and in many of his books he described the\r\nBrethren, not as men who had disgraced their profession, but as heroes\r\nholding the faith in purity. He described his Brethren as broad-minded\r\nmen, who took no part in religious quarrels, but looked towards heaven,\r\nand bore themselves affably to all; he said to the exiles in one of his\r\nletters, \"You have endured to the end\"; he described them again, in\r\na touching appeal addressed to the Church of England, as a model of\r\nChristian simplicity; and he attributed their downfall in Bohemia,\r\nnot to any moral weakness, but to their neglect of education. If the\r\nBrethren, he argued, had paid more attention to learning, they would\r\nhave gained the support of powerful friends, who would not have allowed\r\nthem to perish. I admit, of course, that Comenius was naturally partial,\r\nand that when he speaks in praise of the Brethren we must receive his\r\nevidence with caution; but, on the other hand, I hold that the theory of\r\na serious moral decline, so popular with certain German historians,\r\nis not supported by evidence. If the Brethren had shown much sign\r\nof corruption we should expect to find full proof of the fact in the\r\nCatholic writers of the day. But such proof is not to hand. Not even\r\nthe Jesuit historian, Balbin, had anything serious to say against the\r\nBrethren. The only Catholic writer, as far as I know, who attacked their\r\ncharacter was the famous Papal Nuncio, Carlo Caraffa. He says that the\r\nBrethren in Moravia had become a little ambitious and avaricious, \"with\r\nsome degree of luxury in their habits of life\";[53] but he has no remarks\r\nof a similar nature to make about the Brethren in Bohemia. The real\r\ncause of the fall of the Brethren was utterly different. They fell,\r\nnot because they were morally weak, but because they were killed by the\r\nsword or forcibly robbed of their property. They fell because Bohemia\r\nfell; and Bohemia fell for a variety of reasons; partly because her\r\npeasants were serfs and had no fight left in them; partly because\r\nher nobles blundered in their choice of a Protestant King; and partly\r\nbecause, when all is said, she was only a little country in the grip\r\nof a mightier power. In some countries the Catholic reaction was due\r\nto genuine religious fervour; in Bohemia it was brought about by brute\r\nforce; and even with all his money and his men King Ferdinand found\r\nthe destruction of the Brethren no easy task. He had the whole house of\r\nHapsburg on his side; he had thousands of mercenary soldiers from Spain;\r\nhe was restrained by no scruples of conscience; and yet it took him six\r\nfull years to drive the Brethren from the country. And even then he had\r\nnot completed his work. In spite of his efforts, many thousands of\r\nthe people still remained Brethren at heart; and as late as 1781,\r\nwhen Joseph II. issued his Edict of Toleration, 100,000 in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia declared themselves Brethren. We have here a genuine proof of\r\nthe Brethren's vigour. It had been handed on from father to son through\r\nfive generations. For the Brethren there was still no legal recognition\r\nin Bohemia and Moravia; the Edict applied to Lutherans and Calvinists\r\nonly; and if the Brethren had been weak men they might now have called\r\nthemselves Lutherans or Calvinists. But this, of course, carries us\r\nbeyond the limits of this chapter. For the present King Ferdinand had\r\ntriumphed; and word was sent to the Pope at Rome that the Church of the\r\nBrethren was no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. -- COMENIUS AND THE HIDDEN SEED, 1627-1672.\r\n\r\nBut the cause of the Brethren's Church was not yet lost. As the Brethren\r\nfled before the blast, it befell, in the wonderful providence of God,\r\nthat all their best and noblest qualities--their broadness of view,\r\ntheir care for the young, their patience in suffering, their undaunted\r\nfaith--shone forth in undying splendour in the life and character of one\r\ngreat man; and that man was the famous John Amos Comenius, the pioneer\r\nof modern education and the last Bishop of the Bohemian Brethren. He was\r\nborn on March 18th, 1592, at Trivnitz, a little market town in Moravia.\r\nHe was only six years old when he lost his parents through the plague.\r\nHe was taken in hand by his sister, and was educated at the Brethren's\r\nSchool at Ungarisch-Brod. As he soon resolved to become a minister,\r\nhe was sent by the Brethren to study theology, first at the Calvinist\r\nUniversity of Herborn in Nassau, and then at the Calvinist University\r\nof Heidelberg. For two years (1614-1616) he then acted as master in\r\nthe Brethren's Higher School at Prerau, and then became minister of\r\nthe congregation at Fulneck. There, too, the Brethren had a school; and\r\nthere, both as minister and teacher, Comenius, with his young wife and\r\nfamily, was as happy as the livelong day. But his happiness was speedily\r\nturned to misery. The Thirty Years' War broke out. What part he took\r\nin the Bohemian Revolution we have no means of knowing. He certainly\r\nfavoured the election of Frederick, and helped his cause in some way. \"I\r\ncontributed a nail or two,\" he says,[54] \"to strengthen the new throne.\"\r\nWhat sort of nail he means we do not know. The new throne did not stand\r\nvery long. The troops of Ferdinand appeared at Fulneck. The village was\r\nsacked. Comenius reeled with horror. He saw the weapons for stabbing,\r\nfor chopping, for cutting, for pricking, for hacking, for tearing and\r\nfor burning. He saw the savage hacking of limbs, the spurting of blood,\r\nthe flash of fire.\r\n\r\n\"Almighty God,\" he wrote in one of his books, \"what is happening? Must\r\nthe whole world perish?\"\r\n\r\nHis house was pillaged and gutted; his books and his manuscripts were\r\nburned; and he himself, with his wife and children, had now to flee in\r\nhot haste from Fulneck and to take refuge for a while on the estate\r\nof Baron Charles von Zerotin at Brandeis-on-the-Adler. To the Brethren\r\nBrandeis had long been a sacred spot. There Gregory the Patriarch\r\nhad breathed his last, and there his bones lay buried; there many an\r\nhistoric Brethren's Synod had been held; and there Comenius took up his\r\nabode in a little wood cottage outside the town which tradition said\r\nhad been built by Gregory himself. He had lost his wife and one of his\r\nchildren on the way from Fulneck; he had lost his post as teacher and\r\nminister; and now, for the sake of his suffering Brethren, he wrote\r\nhis beautiful classical allegory, \"The Labyrinth of the World and\r\nthe Paradise of the Heart.\"[55] For historical purposes this book is\r\nof surpassing value. It is a revelation. It is a picture both of the\r\nhorrors of the time and of the deep religious life of the Brethren. As\r\nComenius fled from Fulneck to Brandeis he saw sights that harrowed his\r\nsoul, and now in his cottage at the foot of the hills he described\r\nwhat he had seen. The whole land, said Comenius, was now in a state\r\nof disorder. The reign of justice had ended. The reign of pillage had\r\nbegun. The plot of the book is simple. From scene to scene the pilgrim\r\ngoes, and everything fills him with disgust. The pilgrim, of course, is\r\nComenius himself; the \"Labyrinth\" is Bohemia; and the time is the early\r\nyears of the Thirty Years' War. He had studied the social conditions of\r\nBohemia; he had seen men of all ranks and all occupations; and now, in\r\nwitty, satirical language, he held the mirror up to nature. What sort\r\nof men were employed by Ferdinand to administer justice in Bohemia?\r\nComenius gave them fine sarcastic names. He called the judges Nogod,\r\nLovestrife, Hearsay, Partial, Loveself, Lovegold, Takegift, Ignorant,\r\nKnowlittle, Hasty and Slovenly; he called the witnesses Calumny, Lie and\r\nSuspicion; and, in obvious allusion to Ferdinand's seizure of property,\r\nhe named the statute-book \"The Rapacious Defraudment of the Land.\" He\r\nsaw the lords oppressing the poor, sitting long at table, and discussing\r\nlewd and obscene matters. He saw the rich idlers with bloated faces,\r\nwith bleary eyes, with swollen limbs, with bodies covered with sores.\r\nHe saw the moral world turned upside down. No longer, said Comenius,\r\ndid men in Bohemia call things by their right names. They called\r\ndrunkenness, merriment; greed, economy; usury, interest; lust, love;\r\npride, dignity; cruelty, severity; and laziness, good nature. He saw his\r\nBrethren maltreated in the vilest fashion. Some were cast into the fire;\r\nsome were hanged, beheaded, crucified;[56] some were pierced, chopped,\r\ntortured with pincers, and roasted to death on grid-irons. He studied\r\nthe lives of professing Christians, and found that those who claimed the\r\ngreatest piety were the sorriest scoundrels in the land. \"They drink\r\nand vomit,\" he said, \"quarrel and fight, rob and pillage one another\r\nby cunning and by violence, neigh and skip from wantonness, shout and\r\nwhistle, and commit fornication and adultery worse than any of the\r\nothers.\" He watched the priests, and found them no better than the\r\npeople. Some snored, wallowing in feather beds; some feasted till they\r\nbecame speechless; some performed dances and leaps; some passed their\r\ntime in love-making and wantonness.\r\n\r\nFor these evils Comenius saw one remedy only, and that remedy was the\r\ncultivation of the simple and beautiful religion of the Brethren. The\r\nlast part of his book, \"The Paradise of the Heart,\" is delightful.\r\nComenius was a marvellous writer. He combined the biting satire of Swift\r\nwith the devotional tenderness of Thomas à Kempis. As we linger over\r\nthe closing sections of his book, we can see that he then regarded the\r\nBrethren as almost ideal Christians. Among them he found no priests\r\nin gaudy attire, no flaunting wealth, no grinding poverty; and passing\r\ntheir time in peace and quietness, they cherished Christ in their\r\nhearts. \"All,\" he says, \"were in simple attire, and their ways were\r\ngentle and kind. I approached one of their preachers, wishing to speak\r\nto him. When, as is our custom, I wished to address him according to his\r\nrank, he permitted it not, calling such things worldly fooling.\" To them\r\nceremonies were matters of little importance. \"Thy religion,\" said the\r\nMaster to the Pilgrim--i.e., to the Brethren's Church--\"shall be to\r\nserve me in quiet, and not to bind thyself to any ceremonies, for I do\r\nnot bind thee by them.\"\r\n\r\nBut Comenius did not stay long at Brandeis-on-the-Adler {1628.}. As\r\nZerotin had sided with the House of Hapsburg, he had been allowed, for a\r\nfew years, to give shelter to about forty Brethren's ministers; but\r\nnow commissioners appeared at his Castle, and ordered him to send these\r\nministers away. The last band of exiles now set out for Poland. The\r\nleader was Comenius himself. As they bade farewell to their native land\r\nthey did so in the firm conviction that they themselves should see\r\nthe day when the Church of the Brethren should stand once more in her\r\nancient home; and as they stood on a spur of the Giant Mountains, and\r\nsaw the old loved hills and dales, the towns and hamlets, the nestling\r\nchurches, Comenius raised his eyes to heaven and uttered that historic\r\nprayer which was to have so marvellous an answer. He prayed that in the\r\nold home God would preserve a \"Hidden Seed,\" which would one day grow to\r\na tree; and then the whole band struck up a hymn and set out for Poland.\r\nPathetic was the marching song they sang:--\r\n\r\n   Nought have we taken with us,\r\n   All to destruction is hurled,\r\n   We have only our Kralitz Bibles,\r\n   And our Labyrinth of the World.\r\n\r\nComenius led the Brethren to Lissa, in Poland, and Lissa became the\r\nmetropolis of the exiles.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to many of the exiles no tongue can tell. We know that\r\nsome Brethren went to Hungary and held together for thirty or forty\r\nyears; that some were welcomed by the Elector of Saxony and became\r\nLutherans; that some found their way to Holland and became Reformed\r\nProtestants; that some settled in Lusatia, Saxony; that a few, such as\r\nthe Cennicks, crossed the silver streak and found a home in England; and\r\nthat, finally, a number remained in Bohemia and Moravia, and gathered in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Landskron, Leitomischl, Kunewalde and Fulneck. What\r\nbecame of these last, the \"Hidden Seed,\" we shall see before very long.\r\nFor the present they buried their Bibles in their gardens, held midnight\r\nmeetings in garrets and stables, preserved their records in dovecotes\r\nand in the thatched roofs of their cottages, and, feasting on the\r\nglorious promises of the Book of Revelation--a book which many of them\r\nknew by heart--awaited the time when their troubles should blow by and\r\nthe call to arise should sound.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Comenius had never abandoned hope. He was sure that the\r\nBrethren's Church would revive, and equally sure of the means of her\r\nrevival. For some years there had flourished in the town of Lissa a\r\nfamous Grammar School. It was founded by Count Raphael IV. Leszczynski;\r\nit had recently become a Higher School, or what Germans call a\r\ngymnasium, and now it was entirely in the hands of the Brethren. The\r\npatron, Count Raphael V. Leszczynski, was a Brother;[57] the director\r\nwas John Rybinski, a Brethren's minister; the co-director was another\r\nBrethren's minister, Michael Henrici; and Comenius accepted the post\r\nof teacher, and entered on the greatest task of his life. He had two\r\nobjects before him. He designed to revive the Church of the Brethren\r\nand to uplift the whole human race; and for each of these purposes\r\nhe employed the very same method. The method was education. If the\r\nBrethren, said Comenius, were to flourish again, they must pay more\r\nattention to the training of the young than ever they had done in days\r\ngone by. He issued detailed instructions to his Brethren. They must\r\nbegin, he said, by teaching the children the pure word of God in their\r\nhomes. They must bring their children up in habits of piety. They must\r\nmaintain the ancient discipline of the Brethren. They must live in\r\npeace with other Christians, and avoid theological bickerings. They must\r\npublish good books in the Bohemian language. They must build new schools\r\nwherever possible, and endeavour to obtain the assistance of godly\r\nnobles. We have here the key to the whole of Comenius's career. It is\r\nthe fashion now with many scholars to divide his life into two distinct\r\nparts. On the one hand, they say, he was a Bishop of the Brethren's\r\nChurch; on the other hand he was an educational reformer. The\r\ndistinction is false and artificial. His whole life was of a piece.\r\nHe never distinguished between his work as a Bishop and his work as\r\nan educational reformer. He drew no line between the secular and the\r\nsacred. He loved the Brethren's Church to the end of his days; he\r\nregarded her teaching as ideal; he laboured and longed for her revival;\r\nand he believed with all the sincerity of his noble and beautiful soul\r\nthat God would surely enable him to revive that Church by means of\r\neducation and uplift the world by means of that regenerated Church.\r\n\r\nAnd now for thirteen years, in the Grammar School at Lissa, Comenius\r\ndevoted the powers of his mind to this tremendous task. What was it,\r\nhe asked, that had caused the downfall of the Brethren in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia? It was their cruel and senseless system of education. He had\r\nbeen to a Brethren's School himself, and had come to the conclusion that\r\nin point of method the schools of the Brethren were no better than the\r\nother schools of Europe. \"They are,\" he declared, \"the terror of boys\r\nand the slaughter-houses of minds; places where a hatred of literature\r\nand books is contracted, where two or more years are spent in learning\r\nwhat might be acquired in one, where what ought to be poured in gently\r\nis violently forced and beaten in, and where what ought to be put\r\nclearly is presented in a confused and intricate way as if it were\r\na collection of puzzles.\" The poor boys, he declared, were almost\r\nfrightened to death. They needed skins of tin; they were beaten with\r\nfists, with canes and with birch-rods till the blood streamed forth;\r\nthey were covered with scars, stripes, spots and weals; and thus they\r\nhad learned to hate the schools and all that was taught therein.\r\n\r\nHe had already tried to introduce a reform. He had learned his new\r\nideas about education, not from the Brethren, but at the University of\r\nHerborn. He had studied there the theories of Wolfgang Ratich; he had\r\ntried to carry out these theories in the Brethren's schools at Prerau\r\nand Fulneck; and now at Lissa, where he soon became director, he\r\nintroduced reforms which spread his fame throughout the civilized world.\r\nHis scheme was grand and comprehensive. He held that if only right\r\nmethods were employed all things might be taught to all men. \"There is,\"\r\nhe said, \"nothing in heaven or earth or in the waters, nothing in the\r\nabyss under the earth, nothing in the human body, nothing in the soul,\r\nnothing in Holy Writ, nothing in the arts, nothing in politics, nothing\r\nin the Church, of which the little candidates for wisdom shall be wholly\r\nignorant.\" His faith in the power of education was enormous. It was the\r\nroad, he said, to knowledge, to character, to fellowship with God, to\r\neternal life. He divided the educational course into four stages--the\r\n\"mother school,\" the popular school, the Latin school and the\r\nUniversity; and on each of these stages he had something original to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nFor mothers Comenius wrote a book, entitled the \"School of Infancy.\" In\r\nEngland this book is scarcely known at all: in Bohemia it is a household\r\ntreasure. Comenius regarded it as a work of first-rate importance. What\r\nuse, he asked, were schemes of education if a good foundation were not\r\nfirst laid by the mother? For the first six years of his life, said\r\nComenius, the child must be taught by his mother. If she did her work\r\nproperly she could teach him many marvellous things. He would learn some\r\nphysics by handling things; some optics by naming colours, light and\r\ndarkness; some astronomy by studying the twinkling stars; some geography\r\nby trudging the neighbouring streets and hills; some chronology by\r\nlearning the hours, the days and the months; some history by a chat\r\non local events; some geometry by measuring things for himself; some\r\nstatics by trying to balance his top; some mechanics by building his\r\nlittle toy-house; some dialectics by asking questions; some economics by\r\nobserving his mother's skill as a housekeeper; and some music and\r\npoetry by singing psalms and hymns. As Comenius penned these ideal\r\ninstructions, he must surely have known that nine mothers out of ten\r\nhad neither the patience nor the skill to follow his method; and yet he\r\ninsisted that, in some things, the mother had a clear course before her.\r\nHis advice was remarkably sound. At what age, ask mothers, should the\r\neducation of a child begin? It should begin, said Comenius, before the\r\nchild is born. At that period in her life the expectant mother must be\r\nbusy and cheerful, be moderate in her food, avoid all worry, and keep in\r\nconstant touch with God by prayer; and thus the child will come into the\r\nworld well equipped for the battle of life. She must, of course, nurse\r\nthe child herself. She must feed him, when weaned, on plain and simple\r\nfood. She must provide him with picture books; and, above all, she\r\nmust teach him to be clean in his habits, to obey his superiors, to be\r\ntruthful and polite, to bend the knee and fold his hands in prayer, and\r\nto remember that the God revealed in Christ was ever near at hand.\r\n\r\nAgain, Comenius has been justly called the \"Father of the Elementary\r\nSchool.\" It was here that his ideas had the greatest practical value.\r\nHis first fundamental principle was that in all elementary schools\r\nthe scholars must learn in their native language only. He called these\r\nschools \"Mother tongue schools.\" For six or eight years, said Comenius,\r\nthe scholar must hear no language but his own; and his whole attention\r\nmust be concentrated, not on learning words like a parrot, but on\r\nthe direct study of nature. Comenius has been called the great\r\nSense-Realist. He had no belief in learning second-hand. He illustrated\r\nhis books with pictures. He gave his scholars object lessons. He taught\r\nthem, not about words, but about things. \"The foundation of all learning\r\nconsists,\" he said, \"in representing clearly to the senses sensible\r\nobjects.\" He insisted that no boy or girl should ever have to learn\r\nby heart anything which he did not understand. He insisted that nature\r\nshould be studied, not out of books, but by direct contact with nature\r\nherself. \"Do we not dwell in the garden of nature,\" he asked, \"as well\r\nas the ancients? Why should we not use our eyes, ears and noses as\r\nwell as they? Why should we not lay open the living book of nature?\" He\r\napplied these ideas to the teaching of religion and morals. In order\r\nto show his scholars the meaning of faith, he wrote a play entitled\r\n\"Abraham the Patriarch,\" and then taught them to act it; and, in order\r\nto warn them against shallow views of life, he wrote a comedy, \"Diogenes\r\nthe Cynic, Revived.\" He was no vulgar materialist. His whole object was\r\nmoral and religious. If Comenius had lived in the twentieth century, he\r\nwould certainly have been disgusted and shocked by the modern demand for\r\na purely secular education. He would have regarded the suggestion as an\r\ninsult to human nature. All men, he said, were made in the image of God;\r\nall men had in them the roots of eternal wisdom; all men were capable of\r\nunderstanding something of the nature of God; and, therefore, the\r\nwhole object of education was to develop, not only the physical and\r\nintellectual, but also the moral and spiritual powers, and thus fit men\r\nand women to be, first, useful citizens in the State, and then saints in\r\nthe Kingdom of Heaven beyond the tomb. From court to court he would lead\r\nthe students onward, from the first court dealing with nature to the\r\nlast court dealing with God. \"It is,\" he said, \"our bounden duty to\r\nconsider the means whereby the whole body of Christian youth may be\r\nstirred to vigour of mind and the love of heavenly things.\" He believed\r\nin caring for the body, because the body was the temple of the Holy\r\nGhost; and, in order to keep the body fit, he laid down the rule that\r\nfour hours of study a day was as much as any boy or girl could stand.\r\nFor the same reason he objected to corporal punishment; it was a\r\ndegrading insult to God's fair abode. For the same reason he held that\r\nat all severe punishment should be reserved for moral offences only.\r\n\"The whole object of discipline,\" he said, \"is to form in those\r\ncommitted to our charge a disposition worthy of the children of God.\"\r\nHe believed, in a word, in the teaching of religion in day-schools; he\r\nbelieved in opening school with morning prayers, and he held that all\r\nscholars should be taught to say passages of Scripture by heart, to sing\r\npsalms, to learn a Catechism and to place their trust in the salvation\r\noffered through Jesus Christ. And yet Comenius did not insist on the\r\nteaching of any definite religious creed. He belonged himself to a\r\nChurch that had no creed; he took a broader view of religion than either\r\nthe Lutherans or the Calvinists; he believed that Christianity could be\r\ntaught without a formal dogmatic statement; and thus, if I understand\r\nhim aright, he suggested a solution of a difficult problem which baffles\r\nour cleverest politicians to-day.\r\n\r\nAgain Comenius introduced a new way of learning languages. His great\r\nwork on this subject was entitled \"Janua Linguarum Reserata\"--i.e., The\r\nGate of Languages Unlocked. Of all his works this was the most popular.\r\nIt spread his fame all over Europe. It was translated into fifteen\r\ndifferent languages. It became, next to the Bible, the most widely\r\nknown book on the Continent. For one person who read his delightful\r\n\"Labyrinth,\" there were thousands who nearly knew the \"Janua\" by heart.\r\nThe reason was obvious. The \"Labyrinth\" was a religious book, and was\r\nsuppressed as dangerous by Catholic authorities; but the \"Janua\" was\r\nonly a harmless grammar, and could be admitted with safety anywhere. It\r\nis not the works of richest genius that have the largest sale; it is\r\nthe books that enable men to get on in life; and the \"Janua\" was popular\r\nbecause, in truth, \"it supplied a long-felt want.\" It was a Latin\r\ngrammar of a novel and original kind. For all boys desiring to enter a\r\nprofession a thorough knowledge of Latin was then an absolute necessity.\r\nIt was the language in which the learned conversed, the language spoken\r\nat all Universities, the language of diplomatists and statesmen, the\r\nlanguage of scientific treatises. If a man could make the learning of\r\nLatin easier, he was adored as a public benefactor. Comenius's Grammar\r\nwas hailed with delight, as a boon and a blessing to men. For years\r\nall patient students of Latin had writhed in agonies untold. They\r\nhad learned long lists of Latin words, with their meanings; they had\r\nwrestled in their teens with gerunds, supines, ablative absolutes and\r\ndistracting rules about the subjunctive mood, and they had tried in vain\r\nto take an interest in stately authors far above their understanding.\r\nComenius reversed the whole process. What is the use, he asked, of\r\nlearning lists of words that have no connection with each other? What is\r\nthe use of teaching a lad grammar before he has a working knowledge of\r\nthe language? What is the use of expecting a boy to take an interest in\r\nthe political arguments of Cicero or the dinner table wisdom of\r\nHorace? His method was the conversational. For beginners he prepared an\r\nelementary Latin Grammar, containing, besides a few necessary rules, a\r\nnumber of sentences dealing with events and scenes of everyday life.\r\nIt was divided into seven parts. In the first were nouns and adjectives\r\ntogether; in the second nouns and verbs; in the third adverbs, pronouns,\r\nnumerals and prepositions; in the fourth remarks about things in the\r\nschool; in the fifth about things in the house; in the sixth about\r\nthings in the town; in the seventh some moral maxims. And the scholar\r\nwent through this book ten times before he passed on to the \"Janua\"\r\nproper. The result can be imagined. At the end of a year the boy's\r\nknowledge of Latin would be of a peculiar kind. Of grammar he would know\r\nbut little; of words and phrases he would have a goodly store; and thus\r\nhe was learning to talk the language before he had even heard of its\r\nperplexing rules. One example must suffice to illustrate the method. The\r\nbeginner did not even learn the names of the cases. In a modern English\r\nLatin Grammar, the charming sight that meets our gaze is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Nom. Mensa.--A table.\r\n   Voc. Mensa.--Oh, table!\r\n   Acc. Mensam.--A table.\r\n   Gen. Mensæ.--Of a table.\r\n   Dat. Mensæ.--To or for a table.\r\n   Abl. Mensa.--By, with or from a table.\r\n\r\nThe method of Comenius was different. Instead of mentioning the names of\r\nthe cases, he showed how the cases were actually used, as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Ecce, tabula nigra.--Look there, a black board.\r\n   O tu tabula nigra.--Oh, you black board!\r\n   Video tabulam nigram.--I see a black board.\r\n   Pars tabulæ nigræ.--Part of a black board.\r\n   Addo partem tabulæ nigræ.--I add a part to a black board.\r\n   Vides aliquid in tabula nigra.--I see something on a black board.\r\n\r\nWith us the method is theory first, practice afterwards; with Comenius\r\nthe method was practice first, theory afterwards; and the method of\r\nComenius, with modifications, is likely to be the method of the future.\r\n\r\nBut Comenius's greatest educational work was undoubtedly his \"Great\r\nDidactic,\" or the \"Art of Teaching All Things to All Men.\" It was a\r\nthorough and comprehensive treatise on the whole science, method, scope\r\nand purpose of universal education. As this book has been recently\r\ntranslated into English, I need not here attempt the task of giving an\r\noutline of its contents. His ideas were far too grand and noble to put\r\nin summary form. For us the point of interest is the fact that while the\r\nThirty Years' War was raging, and warriors like Wallenstein and Gustavus\r\nAdolphus were turning Europe into a desert, this scholar, banished from\r\nhis native land, was devising sublime and broad-minded schemes for the\r\nelevation of the whole human race. It is this that makes Comenius great.\r\nHe played no part in the disgraceful quarrels of the age; he breathed no\r\ncomplaint against his persecutors. \"Comenius,\" said the Jesuit historian\r\nBalbin, \"wrote many works, but none that were directed against the\r\nCatholic Church.\" As he looked around upon the learned world he saw the\r\ngreat monster Confusion still unslain, and intended to found a Grand\r\nUniversal College, which would consist of all the learned in Europe,\r\nwould devote its attention to the pursuit of knowledge in every\r\nconceivable branch, and would arrange that knowledge in beautiful order\r\nand make the garden of wisdom a trim parterre. He was so sure that his\r\nsystem was right that he compared it to a great clock or mill, which had\r\nonly to be set going to bring about the desired result. If his scheme\r\ncould only be carried out, what a change there would be in this dreary\r\nearth! What a speedy end to wars and rumours of wars! What a blessed\r\ncessation of religious disputes! What a glorious union of all men of all\r\nnations about the feet of God!\r\n\r\nAt last Comenius became so famous that his friend, Samuel Hartlib,\r\ninvited him to England; and Comenius found upon his arrival that our\r\nEnglish Parliament was interested in his scheme {1641.}. His hopes now\r\nrose higher than ever. At last, he thought, he had found a spot where\r\nhe could actually carry out his grand designs. He had a high opinion of\r\nEnglish piety. \"The ardour,\" he wrote, \"with which the people crowd to\r\nthe Churches is incredible. Almost all bring a copy of the Bible with\r\nthem. Of the youths and men a large number take down the sermons word by\r\nword with their pens. Their thirst for the word of God is so great that\r\nmany of the nobles, citizens also, and matrons study Greek and Hebrew\r\nto be able more safely and more sweetly to drink from the very spring\r\nof life.\" Of all countries England seemed to him the best suited for the\r\naccomplishment of his designs. He discussed the project with John Dury,\r\nwith Samuel Hartlib, with John Evelyn, with the Bishop of Lincoln,\r\nand probably with John Milton. He wanted to establish an \"Academy of\r\nPansophy\" at Chelsea; and there all the wisest men in the world would\r\nmeet, draw up a new universal language, like the framers of Esperanto\r\nto-day, and devise a scheme to keep all the nations at peace. His castle\r\nin the air collapsed. At the very time when Comenius was resident in\r\nLondon this country was on the eve of a revolution. The Irish Rebellion\r\nbroke out, the Civil War trod on its heels, and Comenius left England\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment his life was a series of bitter and cruel\r\ndisappointments. As the Thirty Years' War flickered out to its close,\r\nComenius began to look forward to the day when the Brethren would be\r\nallowed to return to Bohemia and Moravia {1648.}. But the Peace of\r\nWestphalia broke his heart. What provision was made in that famous Peace\r\nfor the poor exiled Brethren? Absolutely none. Comenius was angry and\r\ndisgusted. He had spent his life in the service of humanity; he had\r\nspent six years preparing school books for the Swedish Government; and\r\nnow he complained-- perhaps unjustly--that Oxenstierna, the Swedish\r\nChancellor, had never lifted a finger on behalf of the Brethren.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Comenius continued to hope against hope. The more basely the\r\nBrethren were deserted by men, the more certain he was that they would\r\nbe defended by God. He wrote to Oxenstierna on the subject. \"If there is\r\nno help from man,\" he said, \"there will be from God, whose aid is wont\r\nto commence when that of man ceases.\"\r\n\r\nFor eight years the Brethren, undaunted still, held on together as best\r\nthey could at Lissa; and Comenius, now their chosen leader, made a brave\r\nattempt to revive their schools in Hungary. And then came the final,\r\nawful crash. The flames of war burst out afresh. When Charles X. became\r\nKing of Sweden, John Casimir, King of Poland, set up a claim to the\r\nSwedish throne. The two monarchs went to war. Charles X. invaded Poland;\r\nJohn Casimir fled from Lissa; Charles X. occupied the town. What part,\r\nit may be asked, did the Brethren play in this war? We do not know. As\r\nCharles X. was, of course, a Protestant, it is natural to assume that\r\nthe Brethren sympathised with his cause and hailed him as a deliverer\r\nsent by God; but it is one of the strangest features of their history\r\nthat we never can tell what part they took in these political conflicts.\r\nComenius was now in Lissa. It is said that he openly sided with Charles\r\nX., and urged the Brethren to hold out to the bitter end. I doubt it.\r\nFor a while the Swedish army triumphed. In that army was an old Bohemian\r\ngeneral, who swore to avenge the \"Day of Blood\"; and the churches and\r\nconvents were plundered, and monks and priests were murdered. For a\r\nmoment the Day of Blood was avenged, but for a moment only. As the arm\r\nof flesh had failed the Brethren in the days of Budowa, so the arm of\r\nflesh failed them now.\r\n\r\nThe Polish army surrounded the walls of Lissa {1656.}. A panic broke out\r\namong the citizens. The Swedish garrison gave way. The Polish soldiers\r\npressed in. Again Comenius's library was burned, and the grammar school\r\nwhere he had taught was reduced to ashes. The whole town was soon in\r\nflames. The fire spread for miles in the surrounding country. As the\r\nBrethren fled from their last fond home, with the women and children\r\nhuddled in waggons, they saw barns and windmills flaring around them,\r\nand heard the tramp of the Polish army in hot pursuit. As Pastor John\r\nJacobides and two Acoluths were on their way to Karmin, they were\r\nseized, cut down with spades and thrown into a pit to perish. For Samuel\r\nKardus, the last martyr of the fluttering fragment, a more ingenious\r\ntorture was reserved. He was placed with his head between a door and the\r\ndoor-post, and as the door was gently but firmly closed, his head was\r\nslowly crushed to pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd so the hopes of Comenius were blasted. As the aged Bishop drew near\r\nto his end, he witnessed the failure of all his schemes. Where now was\r\nhis beloved Church of the Brethren? It was scattered like autumn leaves\r\nbefore the blast. And yet Comenius hoped on to the bitter end. The news\r\nof his sufferings reached the ears of Oliver Cromwell. He offered to\r\nfind a home for the Brethren in Ireland. If Comenius had only accepted\r\nthat offer it is certain that Oliver would have been as good as his\r\nword. He longed to make Ireland a Protestant country; and the whole\r\nmodern history of Ireland might have been altered. But Comenius had\r\nnow become an unpractical dreamer. For all his learning he was\r\nvery simple-minded; and for all his piety he had a weak side to his\r\ncharacter. He had listened in his youth to the prophecies of Christopher\r\nKotter; he had listened also to the ravings of Christina Poniatowski;\r\nand now he fell completely under the influence of the vile impostor,\r\nDrabik, who pretended to have a revelation from heaven, and predicted\r\nthat before very long the House of Austria would be destroyed and the\r\nBrethren be enabled to return to their native home. Instead, therefore,\r\nof accepting Cromwell's offer, Comenius spent his last few years in\r\ncollecting money for the Brethren; and pleasant it is to record the\r\nfact that much of that money came from England. Some was sent by Prince\r\nRupert, and some by officials of the Church of England; and Comenius was\r\nable to spend the money in printing helpful, devotional works for the\r\nBrethren. His loyalty now to the Brethren was beautiful. It is easy to\r\nbe faithful to a prosperous Church; Comenius was faithful when the whirl\r\nwas at the worst. Faster than ever the ship was sinking, but still\r\nthe brave old white-haired Captain held to his post on the bridge.\r\nFew things are more pathetic in history than the way in which Comenius\r\ncommended the Brethren to the care of the Church of England. \"To you,\r\ndear friends,\" he wrote in hope, \"we commit our dear mother, the Church\r\nherself. Even in her death, which seems approaching, you ought to love\r\nher, because in her life she has gone before you for more than two\r\ncenturies with examples of faith and patience.\" Of all the links between\r\nthe old Church of the Brethren and the new, Comenius was the strongest.\r\nHe handed on the Brethren's Episcopal Orders. He consecrated his\r\nson-in-law, Peter Jablonsky; this Peter consecrated his own son, Daniel\r\nErnest; and this Daniel Ernest Jablonsky consecrated David Nitschmann,\r\nthe first Bishop of the Renewed Church of the Brethren.\r\n\r\nHe handed on, secondly, the Brethren's system of discipline. He\r\npublished an edition of the \"Ratio Disciplinæ,\" and this it was that\r\nfired Zinzendorf's soul with love for the Brethren's Church.\r\n\r\nBut, thirdly, and most important of all, Comenius kept the old faith\r\nburning in the hearts of the \"Hidden Seed.\" For the benefit of those\r\nstill worshipping in secret in Bohemia and Moravia, he prepared a\r\nCatechism, entitled \"The Old Catholic Christian Religion in Short\r\nQuestions and Answers\"; and by this Catholic Religion he meant the\r\nbroad and simple faith of the Bohemian Brethren. \"Perish sects,\" said\r\nComenius; \"perish the founders of sects. I have consecrated myself to\r\nChrist alone.\" But the purpose of the Catechism had to be kept a secret.\r\n\"It is meant,\" said Comenius, in the preface, \"for all the pious and\r\nscattered sheep of Christ, especially those at F., G., G., K., K., S.,\r\nS. and Z.\" These letters can be easily explained. They stood for\r\nthe villages of Fulneck, Gersdorf, Gestersdorf, Kunewalde, Klandorf,\r\nStechwalde, Seitendorf and Zauchtenthal; and these are the places from\r\nwhich the first exiles came to renew the Brethren's Church at Herrnhut.\r\n\r\nFifty years before his prayers were answered, Comenius lay silent in\r\nthe grave (1672). Yet never did bread cast upon the waters more richly\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.\r\n\r\nTHE BOHEMIAN BRETHREN AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nAs the relations of the Brethren with England were only of a very\r\noccasional nature, it is not easy to weave them into the narrative. But\r\nthe following particulars will be of special interest; they show the\r\nopinion held of the Brethren by officials of the Church of England:--\r\n\r\n1. The case of John Bernard.--At some period in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth a number of scholarships were founded at Oxford for the\r\nbenefit of Bohemian students; and in 1583 John Bernard, a Moravian\r\nstudent, took his B.D. degree at Oxford. The record in the University\r\nRegister is as follows: \"Bernardus, John, a Moravian, was allowed\r\nto supply B.D. He had studied theology for ten years at German\r\nUniversities, and was now going to the Universities of Scotland.\" This\r\nproves that the University of Oxford recognised Bernard as a man in holy\r\norders; for none but men in holy orders could take the B.D. degree.\r\n\r\n2. The case of Paul Hartmann.--In 1652 (October 15th) Paul Hartmann was\r\nordained a Deacon at a Synod of the Moravian Church at Lissa. In 1657 he\r\ncame to England, along with his brother, Adam Samuel Hartmann, to raise\r\nfunds for the exiles. In 1660 he was ordained a Presbyter by Bishop\r\nRobert Skinner, of Oxford, in Christ Church; in 1671 he was admitted\r\nChaplain or Petty Canon of Oxford Cathedral; and in 1676 he became\r\nRector of Shillingford, Berkshire. This proves that Bishop Skinner,\r\nof Oxford, recognised Paul Hartmann's status as a Deacon; and that\r\nrecognition, so far as we know, was never questioned by any Anglican\r\nauthorities. But that is not the end of the story. At this period\r\na considerable number of Brethren had found a home in England; the\r\nContinental Brethren wished to provide for their spiritual needs,\r\nand, therefore, in 1675 they wrote a letter to the Anglican Bishops\r\nrequesting them to consecrate Hartmann a Bishop. Of that letter a\r\ncopy has been preserved in the Johannis-Kirche at Lissa. \"It is no\r\nsuperstition,\" they wrote, \"that fills us with this desire. It is simply\r\nour love of order and piety; and the Church of England is the only\r\nProtestant Church beside our own that possesses this treasure, and can,\r\ntherefore, come to our help.\" For some reason, however, this pathetic\r\nrequest was not carried out. What answer did the Anglican Bishops give?\r\nWe do not know; no answer has been discovered; and Hartmann remained a\r\nPresbyter to the end.\r\n\r\n3. The case of Adam Samuel Hartmann.--He was first a minister of the\r\nMoravian Church at Lissa (1652-56). In 1657 he came to England to\r\ncollect money; in 1673 he was consecrated a Moravian Bishop at Lissa;\r\nand in 1680 he received the degree of D.D. at Oxford. His diploma refers\r\nto him as a Bishop. This suggests, if it does not actually prove, that\r\nthe University of Oxford recognised him as a valid Bishop.\r\n\r\n4. The case of Bishop Amos Comenius.--Of all the Bishops of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren Comenius did most to stir up sympathy on their behalf in\r\nEngland. In 1657 he sent the two Hartmanns and Paul Cyrill to the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury with a MS. entitled, \"Ultimus in Protestantes\r\nBohemiæ confessionis ecclesias Antichristi furor\"; in 1660 he dedicated\r\nhis \"Ratio Disciplinæ\" to the Church of England; and in 1661 he\r\npublished his \"Exhortation of the Churches of Bohemia to the Church of\r\nEngland.\" In this book Comenius took a remarkable stand. He declared\r\nthat the Slavonian Churches had been planted by the Apostles; that\r\nthese Churches had \"run up to a head and ripened\" in the Unity of the\r\nBrethren; and that he himself was now the only surviving Bishop of the\r\nremnants of these Churches. In other words, he represented himself\r\nas the Bishop of a Church of Apostolic origin. In what way, it may be\r\nasked, was this claim received by Anglican authorities? The next case\r\nwill supply the answer.\r\n\r\n5. The case of Archbishop Sancroft.--In 1683 King Charles II. issued a\r\nCabinet Order on behalf of the Brethren; the order was accompanied by\r\nan account of their distresses; the account was \"recommended under the\r\nhands\" of William Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry Compton,\r\nBishop of London; and in that account the statement was deliberately\r\nmade that the Brethren deserved the assistance of Anglicans, not only\r\nbecause they had \"renounced the growing errors of Popery,\" but also\r\nbecause they had \"preserved the Succession of Episcopal Orders.\" The\r\nlast words can only bear one meaning; and that meaning obviously is that\r\nboth the Primate and the Bishop of London regarded Moravian Episcopal\r\nOrders as valid. The next case tells a similar story.\r\n\r\n6. The case of Archbishop Wake.--We have now to step over a period\r\nof thirty-three years. As soon as James II. came to the throne, the\r\ninterest of English Churchmen in the Brethren appears to have waned, and\r\nneither William III. nor Queen Anne took any steps on their behalf. And\r\nyet the connection of the Brethren with England was not entirely broken.\r\nThe bond of union was Daniel Ernest Jablonsky. He was Amos Comenius's\r\ngrandson. In 1680 he came to England; he studied three years at Oxford,\r\nand finally received the degree of D.D. In 1693 he was appointed Court\r\nPreacher at Berlin; in 1699 he was consecrated a Moravian Bishop; and in\r\n1709 he was elected corresponding secretary of the S.P.C.K. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, fresh disasters had overtaken the Brethren. As the sun was\r\nrising on July 29th, 1707, a troop of Russians rode into the town of\r\nLissa, and threw around them balls of burning pitch. The town went up\r\nin flames; the last home of the Brethren was destroyed, and the Brethren\r\nwere in greater distress than ever. At this point Jablonsky nobly came\r\nto their aid. He began by publishing an account of their distresses; he\r\ntried to raise a fund on their behalf; and finally (1715) he sent\r\nhis friend, Bishop Sitkovius, to England, to lay their case before\r\nArchbishop Wake. Again, as in the case of Archbishop Sancroft, this\r\nappeal to the Church of England was successful. The Archbishop brought\r\nthe case before George I., the King consulted the Privy Council, the\r\nPrivy Council gave consent; the King issued Letters Patent to all\r\nthe Archbishops and Bishops of England and Wales, and Wake and John\r\nRobinson, Bishop of London, issued a special appeal, which was read in\r\nall the London churches. The result was twofold. On the one hand money\r\nwas collected for the Brethren; on the other, some person or persons\r\nunknown denounced them as Hussites, declared that their Bishops\r\ncould not be distinguished from Presbyters, and contended that, being\r\nfollowers of Wycliffe, they must surely, like Wycliffe, be enemies of\r\nall episcopal government. Again Jablonsky came to the Brethren's rescue.\r\nHe believed, himself, in the Brethren's Episcopal Orders; he prepared a\r\ntreatise on the subject, entitled, \"De Ordine et Successione Episcopali\r\nin Unitate Fratrum Bohemorum conservato\"; he sent a copy of that\r\ntreatise to Wake, and Wake, in reply, declared himself perfectly\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nTo what conclusion do the foregoing details point? It is needful here\r\nto speak with caution and precision. As the claims of the Brethren were\r\nnever brought before Convocation, we cannot say that the Anglican Church\r\nas a body officially recognised the Brethren as a sister Episcopal\r\nChurch. But, on the other hand, we can also say that the Brethren's\r\norders were never doubted by any Anglican authorities. They were\r\nrecognised by two Archbishops of Canterbury; they were recognised by\r\nBishop Skinner, of Oxford; they were recognised by the University of\r\nOxford. They were recognised, in a word, by every Anglican authority\r\nbefore whose notice they happened to be brought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TWO. -- THE REVIVAL UNDER ZINZENDORF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. -- THE YOUTH OF COUNT ZINZENDORF, 1700-1722.\r\n\r\nIf the kindly reader will take the trouble to consult a map of Europe he\r\nwill see that that part of the Kingdom of Saxony known as Upper Lusatia\r\nruns down to the Bohemian frontier. About ten miles from the frontier\r\nline there stand to-day the mouldering remains of the old castle of\r\nGross-Hennersdorf. The grey old walls are streaked with slime. The\r\nwooden floors are rotten, shaky and unsafe. The rafters are worm-eaten.\r\nThe windows are broken. The damp wall-papers are running to a sickly\r\ngreen. Of roof there is almost none. For the lover of beauty or the\r\nlandscape painter these ruins have little charm. But to us these\r\ntottering walls are of matchless interest, for within these walls Count\r\nZinzendorf, the Renewer of the Brethren's Church, spent the years of his\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nHe was born at six o'clock in the evening, Wednesday, May 26th, 1700, in\r\nthe picturesque city of Dresden {1700.}; the house is pointed out to the\r\nvisitor; and \"Zinzendorf Street\" reminds us still of the noble family\r\nthat has now died out. He was only six weeks old when his father burst\r\na blood-vessel and died; he was only four years when his mother married\r\nagain; and the young Count--Nicholas Lewis, Count of Zinzendorf and\r\nPottendorf--was handed over to the tender care of his grandmother,\r\nCatherine von Gersdorf, who lived at Gross-Hennersdorf Castle. And now,\r\neven in childhood's days, little Lutz, as his grandmother loved to call\r\nhim, began to show signs of his coming greatness. As his father lay on\r\nhis dying bed, he had taken the child in his feeble arm, and consecrated\r\nhim to the service of Christ; and now in his grandmother's noble home he\r\nsat at the feet of the learned, the pious, and the refined. Never was a\r\nchild less petted and pampered; never was a child more strictly trained;\r\nnever was a child made more familiar with the person and teaching of\r\nJesus Christ. Dr. Spener,[58] the famous Pietist leader, watched his\r\ngrowth with fatherly interest. The old lady was a leader in Pietist\r\ncircles, was a writer of beautiful religious poetry, and guarded him as\r\nthe apple of her eye. He read the Bible every day. He doted on Luther's\r\nCatechism. He had the Gospel story at his finger-ends. His aunt\r\nHenrietta, who was rather an oddity, prayed with him morning and night.\r\nHis tutor, Edeling, was an earnest young Pietist from Franke's school at\r\nHalle; and the story of Zinzendorf's early days reads like a mediaeval\r\ntale. \"Already in my childhood,\" he says, {1704.} \"I loved the Saviour,\r\nand had abundant communion with Him. In my fourth year I began to seek\r\nGod earnestly, and determined to become a true servant of Jesus Christ.\"\r\nAt the age of six he regarded Christ as his Brother, would talk with Him\r\nfor hours together as with a familiar friend and was often found rapt in\r\nthought {1706.}, like Socrates in the market-place at Athens. As other\r\nchildren love and trust their parents, so this bright lad with the\r\ngolden hair loved and trusted Christ. \"A thousand times,\" he said, \"I\r\nheard Him speak in my heart, and saw Him with the eye of faith.\" Already\r\nthe keynote of his life was struck; already the fire of zeal burned in\r\nhis bosom. \"Of all the qualities of Christ,\" said He, \"the greatest is\r\nHis nobility; and of all the noble ideas in the world, the noblest is\r\nthe idea that the Creator should die for His children. If the Lord were\r\nforsaken by all the world, I still would cling to Him and love Him.\"\r\nHe held prayer-meetings in his private room. He was sure that Christ\r\nHimself was present there. He preached sermons to companies of friends.\r\nIf hearers failed, he arranged the chairs as an audience; and still is\r\nshown the little window from which he threw letters addressed to Christ,\r\nnot doubting that Christ would receive them. As the child was engaged\r\none day in prayer, the rude soldiers of Charles XII. burst into his\r\nroom. Forthwith the lad began to speak of Christ; and away the soldiers\r\nfled in awe and terror. At the age of eight he lay awake at night\r\ntormented with atheistic doubts {1708.}. But the doubts did not last\r\nlong. However much he doubted with the head he never doubted with the\r\nheart; and the charm that drove the doubts away was the figure of the\r\nliving Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd here we touch the springs of the boy's religion. It is easy to call\r\nall this a hot-house process; it is easy to dub the child a precocious\r\nprig. But at bottom his religion was healthy and sound. It was not\r\nmorbid; it was joyful. It was not based on dreamy imagination; it was\r\nbased on the historic person of Christ. It was not the result of mystic\r\nexaltation; it was the result of a study of the Gospels. It was not,\r\nabove all, self-centred; it led him to seek for fellowship with others.\r\nAs the boy devoured the Gospel story, he was impressed first by the\r\ndrama of the Crucifixion; and often pondered on the words of Gerhardt's\r\nhymn:--\r\n\r\n   O Head so full of bruises,\r\n   So full of pain and scorn,\r\n   'Midst other sore abuses,\r\n   Mocked with a crown of thorn.\r\n\r\nFor this his tutor, Edeling, was partly responsible. \"He spoke to me,\"\r\nsays Zinzendorf, \"of Jesus and His wounds.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy did not linger in Holy Week for ever. He began by laying\r\nstress on the suffering Christ; he went on to lay stress on the whole\r\nlife of Christ; and on that life, from the cradle to the grave, his own\r\nstrong faith was based. \"I was,\" he said, \"as certain that the Son of\r\nGod was my Lord as of the existence of my five fingers.\" To him the\r\nexistence of Jesus was a proof of the existence of God; and he felt all\r\nhis limbs ablaze, to use his own expression, with the desire to preach\r\nthe eternal Godhead of Christ. \"If it were possible,\" he said, \"that\r\nthere should be another God than Christ I would rather be damned\r\nwith Christ than happy with another. I have,\" he exclaimed, \"but one\r\npassion--'tis He, 'tis only He.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next stage in his journey was not so pleasing {1710.}. At the\r\nage of ten he was taken by his mother to Professor Franke's school at\r\nHalle; and by mistake he overheard a conversation between her and the\r\npious professor. She described him as a lad of parts, but full of pride,\r\nand in need of the curbing rein. He was soon to find how much these\r\nwords implied. If a boy has been trained by gentle ladies he is\r\nhardly well equipped, as a rule, to stand the rough horseplay of a\r\nboarding-school; and if, in addition, he boasts blue blood, he is sure\r\nto come in for blows. And the Count was a delicate aristocrat, with\r\nweak legs and a cough. He was proud of his noble birth; he was rather\r\nofficious in his manner; he had his meals at Franke's private table; he\r\nhad private lodgings a few minutes' walk from the school; he had plenty\r\nof money in his purse; and, therefore, on the whole, he was as well\r\ndetested as the son of a lord can be. \"With a few exceptions,\" he sadly\r\nsays, \"my schoolfellows hated me throughout.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was not the bitterest part of the pill. If there was any\r\nwholesome feeling missing in his heart hitherto, it was what theologians\r\ncall the sense of sin. He had no sense of sin whatever, and no sense of\r\nany need of pardon. His masters soon proceeded to humble his pride.\r\nHe was introduced as a smug little Pharisee, and they treated him as a\r\nviper. Of all systems of school discipline, the most revolting is the\r\nsystem of employing spies; and that was the system used by the staff\r\nat Halle. They placed the young Count under boyish police supervision,\r\nencouraged the lads to tell tales about him, rebuked him for his\r\nmisconduct in the measles, lectured him before the whole school on his\r\nrank disgusting offences, and treated him as half a rogue and half an\r\nidiot. If he pleaded not guilty, they called him a liar, and gave him\r\nan extra thrashing. The thrashing was a public school entertainment, and\r\nwas advertised on the school notice-board. \"Next week,\" ran the notice\r\non one occasion, \"the Count is to have the stick.\" For two years he\r\nlived in a moral purgatory. The masters gave him the fire of their\r\nwrath, and the boys the cold shoulder of contempt. The masters called\r\nhim a malicious rebel, and the boys called him a snob. As the little\r\nfellow set off for morning school, with his pile of books upon his arm,\r\nthe others waylaid him, jostled him to and fro, knocked him into the\r\ngutter, scattered his books on the street, and then officiously reported\r\nhim late for school. He was clever, and, therefore, the masters called\r\nhim idle; and when he did not know his lesson they made him stand in the\r\nstreet, with a pair of ass's ears on his head, and a placard on his back\r\nproclaiming to the public that the culprit was a \"lazy donkey.\"\r\n\r\nHis private tutor, Daniel Crisenius, was a bully, who had made his\r\nway into Franke's school by varnishing himself with a shiny coating of\r\npiety. If the Count's relations came to see him, Crisenius made him beg\r\nfor money, and then took the money himself. If his grandmother sent\r\nhim a ducat Crisenius pocketed a florin. If he wrote a letter home,\r\nCrisenius read it. If he drank a cup of coffee, Crisenius would\r\nsay, \"You have me to thank for that, let me hear you sing a song of\r\nthanksgiving.\" If he tried to pour out his soul in prayer, Crisenius\r\nmocked him, interrupted him, and introduced disgusting topics of\r\nconversation. He even made the lad appear a sneak. \"My tutor,\" says\r\nZinzendorf, \"often persuaded me to write letters to my guardian\r\ncomplaining of my hard treatment, and then showed the letters to the\r\ninspector.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain little Lutz laid his case before his mother. Crisenius thrashed\r\nhim to such good purpose that he never dared to complain again; and his\r\nmother still held that he needed drastic medicine. \"I beseech you,\" she\r\nwrote to Franke, \"be severe with the lad; if talking will not cure him\r\nof lying, then let him feel it.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the muddy lane broadened into a highway. One day Crisenius\r\npestered Franke with one of his whining complaints. The headmaster\r\nsnapped him short.\r\n\r\n\"I am sick,\" he said, \"of your growlings; you must manage the matter\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nAs the months rolled on, the Count breathed purer air. He became more\r\nmanly and bold. He astonished the masters by his progress. He was\r\nlearning Greek, could speak in French and dash off letters in Latin.\r\nHe was confirmed, attended the Communion, and wrote a beautiful hymn[59] recording his feelings; and already in his modest way he launched out on\r\nthat ocean of evangelical toil on which he was to sail all the days of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nAs the child grew up in Hennersdorf Castle he saw and heard a good\r\ndeal of those drawing-room meetings[60] which Philip Spener, the Pietist\r\nleader, had established in the houses of several noble Lutheran\r\nfamilies, and which came in time to be known in Germany as \"Churches\r\nwithin the Church.\"[61] He knew that Spener had been his father's friend.\r\nHe had met the great leader at the Castle. He sympathised with the\r\npurpose of his meetings. He had often longed for fellowship himself, and\r\nhad chatted freely on religious topics with his Aunt Henrietta. He had\r\nalways maintained his private habit of personal communion with Christ;\r\nand now he wished to share his religion with others. The time was ripe.\r\nThe moral state of Franke's school was low; the boys were given to\r\nvicious habits, and tried to corrupt his soul; and the Count, who was a\r\nhealthy minded boy, and shrank with disgust from fleshly sins, retorted\r\nby forming a number of religious clubs for mutual encouragement and\r\nhelp. \"I established little societies,\" he says, \"in which we spoke of\r\nthe grace of Christ, and encouraged each other in diligence and good\r\nworks.\" He became a healthy moral force in the school. He rescued his\r\nfriend, Count Frederick de Watteville, from the hands of fifty seducers;\r\nhe persuaded three others to join in the work of rescue; and the five\r\nlads established a club which became a \"Church within the Church\" for\r\nboys. They called themselves first \"The Slaves of Virtue,\" next the\r\n\"Confessors of Christ,\" and finally the \"Honourable Order of the Mustard\r\nSeed\"; and they took a pledge to be true to Christ, to be upright and\r\nmoral, and to do good to their fellow-men. Of all the school clubs\r\nestablished by Zinzendorf this \"Order of the Mustard Seed\" was the most\r\nfamous and the most enduring. As the boys grew up to man's estate they\r\ninvited others to join their ranks; the doctrinal basis was broad;\r\nand among the members in later years were John Potter, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, Cardinal Noailles,\r\nthe broad-minded Catholic, and General Oglethorpe, Governor of Georgia.\r\nFor an emblem they had a small shield, with an \"Ecce Homo,\" and the\r\nmotto, \"His wounds our healing\"; and each member of the Order wore a\r\ngold ring, inscribed with the words, \"No man liveth unto himself.\"\r\nThe Grand Master of the Order was Zinzendorf himself. He wore a golden\r\ncross; the cross had an oval green front; and on that front was painted\r\na mustard tree, with the words beneath, \"Quod fuit ante nihil,\" i.e.,\r\nwhat was formerly nothing.[62]\r\nBut already the boy had wider conceptions still. As he sat at Franke's\r\ndinner table, he listened one day to the conversation of the Danish\r\nmissionary, Ziegenbalg, who was now home on furlough, and he even\r\nsaw some dusky converts whom the missionary had brought from Malabar\r\n{1715.}. His missionary zeal was aroused. As his guardian had already\r\nsettled that Zinzendorf should enter the service of the State, he had,\r\nof course, no idea of becoming a missionary himself;[63] but, as that was\r\nout of the question, he formed a solemn league and covenant with his\r\nyoung friend Watteville that when God would show them suitable men they\r\nwould send them out to heathen tribes for whom no one else seemed to\r\ncare. Nor was this mere playing at religion. As the Count looked back\r\non his Halle days he saw in these early clubs and covenants the germs\r\nof his later work; and when he left for the University the delighted\r\nProfessor Franke said, \"This youth will some day become a great light in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Count, however, in his uncle's opinion was growing rather too\r\nPietistic, he was now sent to the University at Wittenberg, to study\r\nthe science of jurisprudence, and prepare for high service in the State\r\n{April, 1716.}. His father had been a Secretary of State, and the son\r\nwas to follow in his footsteps. His uncle had a contempt for Pietist\r\nreligion; and sent the lad to Wittenberg \"to drive the nonsense out of\r\nhim.\" He had certainly chosen the right place. For two hundred years\r\nthe great University had been regarded as the stronghold of the orthodox\r\nLutheran faith; the bi-centenary Luther Jubilee was fast approaching;\r\nthe theological professors were models of orthodox belief; and the Count\r\nwas enjoined to be regular at church, and to listen with due attention\r\nand reverence to the sermons of those infallible divines. It was like\r\nsending a boy to Oxford to cure him of a taste for dissent. His tutor,\r\nCrisenius, went with him, to guard his morals, read his letters, and rob\r\nhim of money at cards. He had also to master the useful arts of riding,\r\nfencing, and dancing. The cards gave him twinges of conscience. If he\r\ntook a hand, he laid down the condition that any money he might win\r\nshould be given to the poor. He prayed for skill in his dancing lessons,\r\nbecause he wanted to have more time for more serious studies. He was\r\nmore devout in his daily life than ever, prayed to Christ with the foil\r\nin his hand, studied the Bible in Hebrew and Greek, spent whole nights\r\nin prayer, fasted the livelong day on Sundays, and was, in a word, so\r\nMethodistic in his habits that he could truly describe himself as a\r\n\"rigid Pietist.\" He interfered in many a duel, and rebuked his fellow\r\nstudents for drinking hard; and for this he was not beloved. As he\r\nhad come to Wittenberg to study law, he was not, of course, allowed to\r\nattend the regular theological lectures; but, all the same, he spent his\r\nleisure in studying the works of Luther and Spener, and cultivated the\r\npersonal friendship of many of the theological professors. And here he\r\nmade a most delightful discovery. As he came to know these professors\r\nbetter, he found that a man could be orthodox without being\r\nnarrow-minded; and they, for their part, also found that a man could be\r\na rigid Pietist without being a sectarian prig. It was time, he thought,\r\nto put an end to the quarrel. He would make peace between Wittenberg and\r\nHalle. He would reconcile the Lutherans and Pietists. He consulted with\r\nleading professors on both sides; he convinced them of the need for\r\npeace; and the rival teachers actually agreed to accept this student of\r\nnineteen summers as the agent of the longed-for truce. But here Count\r\nZinzendorf's mother intervened. \"You must not meddle,\" she wrote,\r\n\"in such weighty matters; they are above your understanding and your\r\npowers.\" And Zinzendorf, being a dutiful son, obeyed. \"I think,\" he\r\nsaid, \"a visit to Halle might have been of use, but, of course, I must\r\nobey the fourth commandment.\"[64]\r\nAnd now, as befitted a nobleman born, he was sent on the grand tour, to\r\ngive the final polish to his education {1719.}. He regarded the prospect\r\nwith horror. He had heard of more than one fine lord whose virtues had\r\nbeen polished away. For him the dazzling sights of Utrecht and Paris had\r\nno bewitching charm. He feared the glitter, the glamour, and the glare.\r\nThe one passion, love to Christ, still ruled his heart. \"Ah!\" he wrote\r\nto a friend, \"What a poor, miserable thing is the grandeur of the\r\ngreat ones of the earth! What splendid misery!\" As John Milton, on\r\nhis continental tour, had sought the company of musicians and men of\r\nletters, so this young budding Christian poet, with the figure of the\r\nDivine Redeemer ever present to his mind, sought out the company of men\r\nand women who, whatever their sect or creed, maintained communion with\r\nthe living Son of God. He went first to Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where\r\nSpener had toiled so long, came down the Rhine to Düsseldorf, spent half\r\na year at Utrecht, was introduced to William, Prince of Orange, paid\r\nflying calls at Brussels, Antwerp, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and ended\r\nthe tour by a six months' stay amid the gaieties of Paris. At Düsseldorf\r\na famous incident occurred. There, in the picture gallery, he saw and\r\nadmired the beautiful Ecce Homo of Domenico Feti; there, beneath the\r\npicture he read the thrilling appeal: \"All this I did for thee; what\r\ndoest thou for Me?\"; and there, in response to that appeal, he resolved\r\nanew to live for Him who had worn the cruel crown of thorns for all.[65]\r\nAt Paris he attended the Court levée, and was presented to the Duke of\r\nOrleans, the Regent, and his mother, the Dowager Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Count,\" said the Duchess, \"have you been to the opera to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness,\" he replied, \"I have no time for the opera.\" He would\r\nnot spend a golden moment except for the golden crown.\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" said the Duchess, \"that you know the Bible by heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I only wish I did.\"\r\n\r\nAt Paris, too, he made the acquaintance of the Catholic Archbishop,\r\nCardinal Noailles. It is marvellous how broad in his views the young man\r\nwas. As he discussed the nature of true religion with the Cardinal,\r\nwho tried in vain to win him for the Church of Rome, he came to the\r\nconclusion that the true Church of Jesus Christ consisted of many sects\r\nand many forms of belief. He held that the Church was still an invisible\r\nbody; he held that it transcended the bounds of all denominations; he\r\nhad found good Christians among Protestants and Catholics alike; and he\r\nbelieved, with all his heart and soul, that God had called him to\r\nthe holy task of enlisting the faithful in all the sects in one grand\r\nChristian army, and thus realizing, in visible form, the promise of\r\nChrist that all His disciples should be one. He was no bigoted Lutheran.\r\nFor him the cloak of creed or sect was only of minor moment. He desired\r\nto break down all sectarian barriers. He desired to draw men from\r\nall the churches into one grand fellowship with Christ. He saw, and\r\nlamented, the bigotry of all the sects. \"We Protestants,\" he said, \"are\r\nvery fond of the word liberty; but in practice we often try to throttle\r\nthe conscience.\" He was asked if he thought a Catholic could be saved.\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"and the man who doubts that, cannot have looked far\r\nbeyond his own small cottage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then,\" asked the Duchess of Luynes, \"is the real difference\r\nbetween a Lutheran and a Catholic?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" he replied, \"the false idea that the Bible is so hard to\r\nunderstand that only the Church can explain it.\" He had, in a word,\r\ndiscovered his vocation.\r\n\r\nHis religion purified his love. As he made his way home, at the close\r\nof the tour, he called to see his aunt, the Countess of Castell, and her\r\ndaughter Theodora {1720.}; and during his stay he fell ill of a fever,\r\nand so remained much longer than he had at first intended. He helped the\r\nCountess to put in order the affairs of her estate, took a leading part\r\nin the religious services of the castle, and was soon regarded as almost\r\none of the family. At first, according to his usual custom, he would\r\ntalk about nothing but religion. But gradually his manner changed. He\r\nopened out, grew less reserved, and would gossip and chat like a woman.\r\nHe asked himself the reason of this alteration. He discovered it. He was\r\nin love with his young cousin, Theodora. For a while the gentle stream\r\nof love ran smooth. His mother and the Countess Castell smiled approval;\r\nTheodora, though rather icy in manner, presented him with her portrait;\r\nand the Count, who accepted the dainty gift as a pledge of blossoming\r\nlove, was rejoicing at finding so sweet a wife and so charming a helper\r\nin his work, when an unforeseen event turned the current of the stream.\r\nBeing belated one evening on a journey, he paid a visit to his friend\r\nCount Reuss, and during conversation made the disquieting discovery that\r\nhis friend wished to marry Theodora. A beautiful contest followed. Each\r\nof the claimants to the hand of Theodora expressed his desire to retire\r\nin favour of the other; and, not being able to settle the dispute, the\r\ntwo young men set out for Castell to see what Theodora herself would\r\nsay. Young Zinzendorf's mode of reasoning was certainly original. If his\r\nown love for Theodora was pure--i.e., if it was a pure desire to do\r\nher good, and not a vulgar sensual passion like that with which many\r\nlove-sick swains were afflicted--he could, he said, fulfil his purpose\r\njust as well by handing her over to the care of his Christian friend.\r\n\"Even if it cost me my life to surrender her,\" he said, \"if it is more\r\nacceptable to my Saviour, I ought to sacrifice the dearest object in the\r\nworld.\" The two friends arrived at Castell and soon saw which way the\r\nwind was blowing; and Zinzendorf found, to his great relief, that what\r\nhad been a painful struggle to him was as easy as changing a dress\r\nto Theodora. The young lady gave Count Reuss her heart and hand. The\r\nrejected suitor bore the blow like a stoic. He would conquer, he said,\r\nsuch disturbing earthly emotions; why should they be a thicket in the\r\nway of his work for Christ? The betrothal was sealed in a religious\r\nceremony. Young Zinzendorf composed a cantata for the occasion {March\r\n9th, 1721.}; the cantata was sung, with orchestral accompaniment, in\r\nthe presence of the whole house of Castell; and at the conclusion of\r\nthe festive scene the young composer offered up on behalf of the happy\r\ncouple a prayer so tender that all were moved to tears. His self-denial\r\nwas well rewarded. If the Count had married Theodora, he would only\r\nhave had a graceful drawing-room queen. About eighteen months later he\r\nmarried Count Reuss's sister, Erdmuth Dorothea {Sept. 7th, 1722.}; and\r\nin her he found a friend so true that the good folk at Herrnhut called\r\nher a princess of God, and the \"foster-mother of the Brethren's Church\r\nin the eighteenth century.\"[66]\r\nIf the Count could now have had his way he would have entered the\r\nservice of the State Church; but in those days the clerical calling was\r\nconsidered to be beneath the dignity of a noble, and his grandmother,\r\npious though she was, insisted that he should stick to jurisprudence. He\r\nyielded, and took a post as King's Councillor at Dresden, at the Court\r\nof Augustus the Strong, King of Saxony. But no man can fly from his\r\nshadow, and Zinzendorf could not fly from his hopes of becoming a\r\npreacher of the Gospel. If he could not preach in the orthodox pulpit,\r\nhe would teach in some other way; and, therefore, he invited the public\r\nto a weekly meeting in his own rooms on Sunday afternoons from three to\r\nseven. He had no desire to found a sect, and no desire to interfere\r\nwith the regular work of the Church. He was acting, he said, in strict\r\naccordance with ecclesiastical law; and he justified his bold conduct by\r\nappealing to a clause in Luther's Smalkald Articles.[67] He contended that\r\nthere provision was made for the kind of meeting that he was conducting;\r\nand, therefore, he invited men of all classes to meet him on Sunday\r\nafternoons, read a passage of Scripture together, and talk in a\r\nfree-and-easy fashion on spiritual topics. He became known as rather\r\na curiosity; and Valentine Löscher, the popular Lutheran preacher,\r\nmentioned him by name in his sermons, and held him up before the people\r\nas an example they would all do well to follow.\r\n\r\nBut Zinzendorf had not yet reached his goal. He was not content with the\r\nwork accomplished by Spener, Franke, and other leading Pietists. He was\r\nnot content with drawing-room meetings for people of rank and money.\r\nIf fellowship, said he, was good for lords, it must also be good for\r\npeasants. He wished to apply the ideas of Spener to folk in humbler\r\nlife. For this purpose he now bought from his grandmother the little\r\nestate of Berthelsdorf, which lay about three miles from Hennersdorf\r\n{April, 1722.}; installed his friend, John Andrew Rothe, as pastor of\r\nthe village church; and resolved that he and the pastor together would\r\nendeavour to convert the village into a pleasant garden of God. \"I\r\nbought this estate,\" he said, \"because I wanted to spend my life among\r\npeasants, and win their souls for Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, Rothe,\" he said, \"to the vineyard of the Lord. You will find in me\r\na brother and helper rather than a patron.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here let us note precisely the aim this pious Count had in view. He\r\nwas a loyal and devoted member of the national Lutheran Church; he was\r\nwell versed in Luther's theology and in Luther's practical schemes;\r\nand now at Berthelsdorf he was making an effort to carry into practical\r\neffect the fondest dreams of Luther himself. For this, the fellowship\r\nof true believers, the great Reformer had sighed in vain;[68] and to this\r\ngreat purpose the Count would now devote his money and his life.\r\n\r\nHe introduced the new pastor to the people; the induction sermon was\r\npreached by Schäfer, the Pietist pastor at Görlitz; and the preacher\r\nused the prophetic words, \"God will light a candle on these hills which\r\nwill illuminate the whole land.\"\r\n\r\nWe have now to see how far these words came true. We have now to see\r\nhow the Lutheran Count applied his ideas to the needs of exiles from a\r\nforeign land, and learned to take a vital interest in a Church of which\r\nas yet he had never heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. -- CHRISTIAN DAVID, 1690-1722.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in John Wesley's \"Journal,\"[69] that when he paid his\r\nmemorable visit to Herrnhut he was much impressed by the powerful\r\nsermons of a certain godly carpenter, who had preached in his day to the\r\nEskimos in Greenland, and who showed a remarkable knowledge of divinity.\r\nIt was Christian David, known to his friends as the \"Servant of the\r\nLord.\"\r\n\r\nHe was born on December 31st, 1690, at Senftleben, in Moravia; he was\r\nbrought up in that old home of the Brethren; and yet, as far as records\r\ntell, he never heard in his youthful days of the Brethren who still held\r\nthe fort in the old home of their fathers. He came of a Roman Catholic\r\nfamily, and was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. He sat at the\r\nfeet of the parish priest, was devout at Mass, invoked his patron saint,\r\nSt. Anthony, knelt down in awe before every image and picture of the\r\nVirgin, regarded Protestants as children of the devil, and grew up to\r\nman's estate burning with Romish zeal, as he says, \"like a baking oven.\"\r\nHe began life as a shepherd; and his religion was tender and deep. As he\r\ntended his sheep in the lonesome fields, and rescued one from the jaws\r\nof a wolf, he thought how Christ, the Good Shepherd, had given His life\r\nfor men; and as he sought his wandering sheep in the woods by night he\r\nthought how Christ sought sinners till he found them. And yet somehow\r\nhe was not quite easy in his mind. For all his zeal and all his piety\r\nhe was not sure that he himself had escaped the snare of the fowler.\r\nHe turned first for guidance to some quiet Protestants, and was told by\r\nthem, to his horror, that the Pope was Antichrist, that the worship of\r\nsaints was a delusion, and that only through faith in Christ could his\r\nsins be forgiven. He was puzzled. As these Protestants were ready to\r\nsuffer for their faith, he felt they must be sincere; and when some of\r\nthem were cast into prison, he crept to the window of their cell and\r\nheard them sing in the gloaming. He read Lutheran books against the\r\nPapists, and Papist books against the Lutherans. He was now dissatisfied\r\nwith both. He could see, he said, that the Papists were wrong, but that\r\ndid not prove that the Lutherans were right; he could not understand\r\nwhat the Lutherans meant when they said that a man was justified\r\nby faith alone; and at last he lost his way so far in this famous\r\ntheological fog that he hated and loathed the very name of Christ.\r\nHe turned next for instruction to some Jews; and the Jews, of course,\r\nconfirmed his doubts, threw scorn upon the whole New Testament, and\r\nendeavoured to convince him that they alone were the true Israel of God.\r\n\r\nHe turned next to the Bible, and the fog lifted a little {1710.}. He\r\nread the Old Testament carefully through, to see if the prophecies there\r\nhad been fulfilled; and, thereby, he arrived at the firm belief that\r\nJesus was the promised Messiah. He then mastered the New Testament, and\r\ncame to the equally firm conclusion that the Bible was the Word of God.\r\n\r\nAnd even yet he was not content. As long as he stayed in Catholic\r\nMoravia he would have to keep his new convictions a secret; and, longing\r\nto renounce the Church of Rome in public, he left Moravia, passed\r\nthrough Hungary and Silesia, and finally became a member of a Lutheran\r\ncongregation at Berlin.\r\n\r\nBut the Lutherans seemed to him very stiff and cold. He was seeking\r\nfor a pearl of great price, and so far he had failed to find it. He\r\nhad failed to find it in the Church of Rome, failed to find it in the\r\nScriptures, and failed to find it in the orthodox Protestants of Berlin.\r\nHe had hoped to find himself in a goodly land, where men were godly and\r\ntrue; and he found that even the orthodox Protestants made mock of\r\nhis pious endeavours. He left Berlin in disgust, and enlisted in the\r\nPrussian Army. He did not find much piety there. He served in the war\r\nagainst Charles XII. of Sweden {1715.}, was present at the siege of\r\nStralsund, thought soldiers no better than civilians, accepted his\r\ndischarge with joy, and wandered around from town to town, like the old\r\nphilosopher seeking an honest man. At last, however, he made his way to\r\nthe town of Görlitz, in Silesia {1717.}; and there he came into personal\r\ncontact with two Pietist clergymen, Schäfer and Schwedler. For the first\r\ntime in his weary pilgrimage he met a pastor who was also a man. He fell\r\nill of a dangerous disease; he could not stir hand or foot for twenty\r\nweeks; he was visited by Schwedler every day; and thus, through the\r\ngateway of human sympathy, he entered the kingdom of peace, and\r\nfelt assured that all his sins were forgiven. He married a member of\r\nSchwedler's Church, was admitted to the Church himself, and thus found,\r\nin Pietist circles, that very spirit of fellowship and help which\r\nZinzendorf himself regarded as the greatest need of the Church.\r\n\r\nBut now Christian David must show to others the treasure he had found\r\nfor himself. For the next five years he made his home at Görlitz; but,\r\nevery now and then, at the risk of his life, he would take a trip to\r\nMoravia, and there tell his old Protestant friends the story of his\r\nnew-found joy. He preached in a homely style; he had a great command of\r\nScriptural language; he was addressing men who for many years had conned\r\ntheir Bibles in secret; and thus his preaching was like unto oil on\r\na smouldering fire, and stirred to vigorous life once more what had\r\nslumbered for a hundred years since the fatal Day of Blood. He tramped\r\nthe valleys of Moravia; he was known as the Bush Preacher, and was\r\ntalked of in every market-place; the shepherds sang old Brethren's hymns\r\non the mountains; a new spirit breathed upon the old dead bones; and\r\nthus, through the message of this simple man, there began in Moravia\r\na hot revival of Protestant zeal and hope. It was soon to lead to\r\nmarvellous results.\r\n\r\nFor the last three hundred and forty years there had been established\r\nin the neighbourhood of Fulneck, in Moravia, a colony of Germans.[70] They\r\nstill spoke the German language; they lived in places bearing German\r\nnames and bore German names themselves; they had used a German version\r\nof the Bible and a German edition of the Brethren's Hymns; and thus,\r\nwhen David's trumpet sounded, they were able to quit their long-loved\r\nhomes and settle down in comfort on German soil. At Kunewalde[71] dwelt the Schneiders and Nitschmanns; at Zauchtenthal the Stachs and\r\nZeisbergers; at Sehlen the Jaeschkes and Neissers; and at Senftleben,\r\nDavid's old home, the Grassmanns. For such men there was now no peace in\r\ntheir ancient home. Some were imprisoned; some were loaded with chains;\r\nsome were yoked to the plough and made to work like horses; and some\r\nhad to stand in wells of water until nearly frozen to death. And yet the\r\nstar of hope still shone upon them. As the grand old patriarch, George\r\nJaeschke, saw the angel of death draw near, he gathered his son and\r\ngrandsons round his bed, and spoke in thrilling, prophetic words of the\r\nremnant that should yet be saved.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said he, \"that our liberties are gone, and that our\r\ndescendants are giving way to a worldly spirit, so that the Papacy is\r\ndevouring them. It may seem as though the final end of the Brethren's\r\nChurch had come. But, my beloved children, you will see a great\r\ndeliverance. The remnant will be saved. How, I cannot say; but something\r\ntells me that an exodus will take place; and that a refuge will be\r\noffered in a country and on a spot where you will be able, without fear,\r\nto serve the Lord according to His holy Word.\"\r\n\r\nThe time of deliverance had come. As Christian David heard of the\r\nsufferings which these men had now to endure, his blood boiled with\r\nanger. He resolved to go to their rescue. The path lay open. He had\r\nmade many friends in Saxony. His friend Schäfer introduced him to Rothe;\r\nRothe introduced him to Zinzendorf; and Christian David asked the Count\r\nfor permission to bring some persecuted Protestants from Moravia to find\r\na refuge in Berthelsdorf. The conversation was momentous. The heart of\r\nthe Count was touched. If these men, said he, were genuine martyrs, he\r\nwould do his best to help them; and he promised David that if they came\r\nhe would find them a place of abode. The joyful carpenter returned to\r\nMoravia, and told the news to the Neisser family at Sehlen. \"This,\" said\r\nthey, \"is God's doing; this is a call from the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, at ten o'clock one night, there met at the house of Jacob\r\nNeisser, in Sehlen, a small band of emigrants {May 27th, 1722.}. At the\r\nhead of the band was Christian David; and the rest of the little group\r\nconsisted of Augustin and Jacob Neisser, their wives and children,\r\nMartha Neisser, and Michael Jaeschke, a cousin of the family.[72] We know\r\nbut little about these humble folk; and we cannot be sure that they were\r\nall descendants of the old Church of the Brethren. Across the mountains\r\nthey came, by winding and unknown paths. For the sake of their faith\r\nthey left their goods and chattels behind; long and weary was the march;\r\nand at length, worn out and footsore, they arrived, with Christian David\r\nat their head, at Zinzendorf's estate at Berthelsdorf {June 8th, 1722.}.\r\n\r\nThe streams had met: the new river was formed; and thus the course of\r\nRenewed Brethren's History had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. -- THE FOUNDING OF HERRNHUT, 1722-1727.\r\n\r\nAs these wanderers from a foreign land had not been able to bring\r\nin their pockets certificates of orthodoxy, and might, after all, be\r\ndangerous heretics, it occurred to Zinzendorf's canny steward, Heitz,\r\nthat on the whole it would be more fitting if they settled, not in the\r\nvillage itself, but at a safe and convenient distance. The Count was\r\naway; the steward was in charge; and the orthodox parish must not be\r\nexposed to infection. As the Neissers, further, were cutlers by trade,\r\nthere was no need for them in the quiet village. If they wished to earn\r\nan honest living they could do it better upon the broad high road.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, therefore, he led the exiles to a dismal, swampy\r\nstretch of ground about a mile from the village; and told them for the\r\npresent to rest their bones in an old unfinished farmhouse {June 8th,\r\n1722.}. The spot itself was dreary and bleak, but the neighbouring woods\r\nof pines and beeches relieved the bareness of the scene. It was part of\r\nZinzendorf's estate, and lay at the top of a gentle slope, up which a\r\nlong avenue now leads. It was a piece of common pasture ground, and was\r\ntherefore known as the Hutberg,[73] or Watch-Hill. It was on the high road\r\nfrom Löbau to Zittau; it was often used as a camping ground by gypsies\r\nand other pedlars; and the road was in such a disgusting state that\r\nwagons sometimes sank axle deep in the mud. For the moment the refugees\r\nwere sick at heart.\r\n\r\n\"Where,\" said Mrs. Augustin Neisser, \"shall we find bread in this\r\nwilderness?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you believe,\" said Godfrey Marche, tutor to Lady Gersdorf's\r\ngranddaughters, \"you shall see the glory of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe steward was quite concerned for the refugees. As he strolled around\r\ninspecting the land he noticed one particular spot where a thick mist\r\nwas rising; and concluding that there a spring was sure to be found, he\r\noffered a prayer on their behalf, and registered the solemn vow, \"Upon\r\nthis spot, in Thy name, I will build for them the first house.\" He laid\r\ntheir needs before Lady Gersdorf, and the good old poetess kindly sent\r\nthem a cow; he inspected the site with Christian David, and marked the\r\ntrees he might fell; and thus encouraged, Christian David seized his\r\naxe, struck it into a tree, and, as he did so, exclaimed, \"Yea, the\r\nsparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself.\"[74] {June\r\n17th, 1722.}\r\n\r\nThe first step in the building of Herrnhut had been taken. For some\r\nweeks the settlers had still to eat the bread of bitterness and scorn.\r\nIt was long before they could find a spring of water. The food was poor,\r\nthe children fell ill; the folk in the neighbourhood laughed; and\r\neven when the first house was built they remarked that it would not be\r\nstanding long.\r\n\r\nBut already Christian David had wider plans. Already in vivid\r\nimagination he saw a goodly city rise, mapped out the courts and streets\r\nin his mind, and explained his glowing schemes to the friendly Heitz.\r\nThe steward himself was carried away with zeal. The very name of the\r\nhill was hailed as a promising omen. \"May God grant,\" wrote Heitz to the\r\nCount, \"that your excellency may be able to build on the hill called the\r\nHutberg a town which may not only itself abide under the Lord's Watch\r\n(Herrnhut), but all the inhabitants of which may also continue on the\r\nLord's Watch, so that no silence may be there by day or night.\" It was\r\nthus that Herrnhut received the name which was soon to be famous in\r\nthe land; and thus that the exiles, cheered anew, resolved to build a\r\nglorious City of God.\r\n\r\n\"We fear,\" they wrote to the Count himself, \"that our settling here may\r\nbe a burden to you; and therefore we most humbly entreat you to grant\r\nus your protection, to continue to help us further still, and to show\r\nkindness and love to us poor distressed and simple-minded petitioners.\"\r\n\r\nAs the building of the first house proceeded the pious Heitz grew more\r\nand more excited. He drove in the first nail; he helped to fix the first\r\npillar; and, finally, when the house was ready, he opened it in solemn\r\nreligious style, and preached a sort of prophetic sermon about the holy\r\ncity, the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven. The Count\r\nhimself soon blessed the undertaking. As he drove along, one winter\r\nnight, on the road from Strahwalde to Hennersdorf, he saw a strange\r\nlight shining through the trees {Dec. 2nd.}. He asked what the light\r\ncould mean. There, he was told, the Moravian refugees had built the\r\nfirst house on his estate. He stopped the carriage, entered the house,\r\nassured the inmates of his hearty goodwill, fell down on his knees, and\r\ncommended the enterprise to the care of God.\r\n\r\nAgain the restless David was on the move. As he knelt one day to fix\r\na plank in the new manor-house which Zinzendorf was building in the\r\nvillage, it suddenly flashed on his busy brain that he ought to do\r\nsomething out of the common to show his gratitude to God {1723.}. His\r\nwife had just passed through a dangerous illness; he had vowed to God\r\nthat if she recovered he would go to Moravia again; and, throwing down\r\nhis tools on the spot, he darted off in his working clothes, and without\r\na hat on his head, and made his way once more to Sehlen, the old home\r\nof the Neissers. He brought a letter from the Neissers in his pocket;\r\nhe urged the rest of the family to cross the border; and the result was\r\nthat before many days were gone a band of eighteen more emigrants were\r\non their way to Herrnhut.\r\n\r\nHis next step had still more momentous results. As he made his way from\r\ntown to town, and urged his friends to come to \"David's City,\" he had\r\nno further aim than to find a home where Protestants could live in peace\r\nand comfort. He knew but little, if anything at all, of the old Church\r\nof the Brethren; he had never been a member of that Church himself; he\r\nhad no special interest in her welfare; and the emigrants whom he had\r\nbrought to Herrnhut were mostly evangelical folk who had been awakened\r\nby the preaching of the Pietist pastor, Steinmetz, of Teschen. But now,\r\nin the village of Zauchtenthal, he found a band of five young men\r\nwhose bosoms glowed with zeal for the ancient Church. They were David\r\nNitschmann I., the Martyr; David Nitschmann II., the first Bishop of the\r\nRenewed Church; David Nitschmann III., the Syndic; Melchior Zeisberger,\r\nthe father of the apostle to the Indians; and John Toeltschig, one of\r\nthe first Moravian preachers in Yorkshire. They were genuine sons of the\r\nBrethren; they used the Catechism of Comenius; they sang the Brethren's\r\nhymns in their homes; and now they were looking wistfully forward to the\r\ntime when the Church would renew her strength like the eagle's. For some\r\nmonths they had made their native village the centre of an evangelical\r\nrevival. At last events in the village came to a crisis; the young men\r\nwere summoned before the village judge; and the judge, no other than\r\nToeltschig's father, commanded them to close their meetings, and to take\r\ntheir share, like decent fellows, in the drunken jollifications at the\r\npublic-house. For the brave \"Five Churchmen\" there was now no way\r\nbut one. Forthwith they resolved to quit Moravia, and seek for other\r\nBrethren at Lissa, in Poland {May 2nd, 1724.}; and the very next night\r\nthey set out on their journey, singing the Moravian Emigrants' song:--\r\n\r\n   Blessed be the day when I must roam,\r\n   Far from my country, friends and home,\r\n     An exile poor and mean;\r\n   My father's God will be my guide,\r\n   Will angel guards for me provide,\r\n     My soul in dangers screen.\r\n   Himself will lead me to a spot\r\n   Where, all my cares and griefs forgot,\r\n     I shall enjoy sweet rest.\r\n   As pants for cooling streams the hart,\r\n   I languish for my heavenly part,\r\n     For God, my refuge blest.\r\n\r\nFor them the chosen haven of rest was Lissa. There the great Comenius\r\nhad taught; and there, they imagined, Brethren lingered still. As they\r\nhad, however, heard a good deal from David of the \"town\" being built\r\nat Herrnhut, they resolved to pay a passing call on their way. At Lower\r\nWiese they called on Pastor Schwedler. He renewed their zeal for the\r\nChurch in glowing terms.\r\n\r\n\"My children,\" he said, \"do you know whose descendants you are? It is a\r\nhundred years since the persecutions began against your fathers. You are\r\nnow to enjoy among us that liberty of conscience for the sake of which\r\nthey shed their blood. We shall see you blossom and flourish in our\r\nmidst.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a memorable day when they arrived at Herrnhut {May 12th, 1724.}.\r\nThe first sight of the holy city did not impress them. The excited David\r\nhad painted a rosy picture. They expected to find a flourishing town,\r\nand all they saw was three small houses, of which only one was finished.\r\n\r\n\"If three houses make a city,\" said David Nitschmann, \"there are worse\r\nplaces than Herrnhut.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was something to look at after all. At a little distance\r\nfrom the three small houses, sat Friedrich de Watteville on a log of\r\nwood; Christian David was working away at another building; in the\r\nafternoon the Count and Countess appeared; and the Count then laid the\r\nfoundation stone of a college for noblemen's sons. They stayed to see\r\nthe ceremony. They heard the Count deliver an impressive speech. They\r\nheard de Watteville offer a touching prayer. They saw him place his\r\njewels under the stone. They were touched; they stayed; and became the\r\nfirmest pillars of the rising temple.\r\n\r\nAnd now the stream from Moravia increased in force and volume. Again and\r\nagain, ten times in all, did the roving David journey to the Moravian\r\ndales; and again and again did the loud blast of the trombones in the\r\nsquare announce that yet another band of refugees had arrived. Full\r\nmany a stirring and thrilling tale had the refugees to tell; how another\r\nDavid Nitschmann, imprisoned in a castle, found a rope at his window and\r\nescaped; how David Schneider and another David Nitschmann found their\r\nprison doors open; how David Hickel, who had been nearly starved in a\r\ndungeon, walked out between his guards in broad daylight, when their\r\nbacks were turned; how Andrew Beier and David Fritsch had stumbled\r\nagainst their prison door and found that the bolt was loose; how Hans\r\nNitschmann, concealed in a ditch, heard his pursuers, a foot off, say,\r\n\"This is the place, here he must be,\" and yet was not discovered after\r\nall. No wonder these wanderers felt that angels had screened them on\r\ntheir way. For the sake of their faith they had been imprisoned, beaten,\r\nthrust into filthy dungeons. For the sake of their faith they had left\r\nbehind their goods, their friends, their worldly prospects, had tramped\r\nthe unknown mountain paths, had slept under hedges, had been attacked\r\nby robbers. And now, for the sake of this same faith, these men, though\r\nsons of well-to-do people, settled down to lives of manual toil in\r\nHerrnhut. And the numbers swelled; the houses rose; and Herrnhut assumed\r\nthe shape of a hollow square.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, a difficulty arose. As the rumour spread in the\r\nsurrounding country that the Count had offered his estate as an asylum\r\nfor persecuted Protestants all sorts of religious malcontents came to\r\nmake Herrnhut their home. Some had a touch of Calvinism, and were fond\r\nof discussing free will and predestination; some were disciples of the\r\nsixteenth century Anabaptist mystic, Casper Schwenkfeld; some were vague\r\nevangelicals from Swabia; some were Lutheran Pietists from near at\r\nhand; and some, such as the \"Five Churchmen,\" were descendants of the\r\nBrethren's Church, and wished to see her revived on German soil. The\r\nresult was dissension in the camp. As the settlement grew larger things\r\ngrew worse. As the settlers learned to know each other better they\r\nlearned to love each other less. As poverty crept in at the door love\r\nflew out of the window. Instead of trying to help each other, men\r\nactually tried to cut each other out in business, just like the rest\r\nof the world. As the first flush of joy died away, men pointed out each\r\nother's motes, and sarcasm pushed charity from her throne; and, worse\r\nthan all, there now appeared that demon of discord, theological dispute.\r\nThe chief leader was a religious crank, named Krüger. He was, of\r\ncourse, no descendant of the Brethren's Church. He had quarrelled with a\r\nLutheran minister at Ebersdorf, had been promptly excluded from the Holy\r\nCommunion, and now came whimpering to Herrnhut, and lifted up his\r\nvoice against the Lutheran Church. He did not possess the garment of\r\nrighteousness, he decked himself out with sham excitement and rhetoric;\r\nand, as these are cheap ribbons and make a fine show, he soon gained a\r\nreputation as a saint. He announced that he had been commissioned by God\r\nwith the special task of reforming Count Zinzendorf; described Rothe as\r\nthe \"False Prophet\" and Zinzendorf as \"The Beast\"; denounced the whole\r\nLutheran Church as a Babylon, and summoned all in Herrnhut to leave it;\r\nand altogether made such a show of piety and holy devotion to God that\r\nhis freaks and crotchets and fancies and vagaries were welcomed by the\r\nbest of men, and poisoned the purest blood. His success was marvellous.\r\nAs the simple settlers listened to his rapt orations they became\r\nconvinced that the Lutheran Church was no better than a den of thieves;\r\nand the greater number now refused to attend the Parish Church, and\r\nprepared to form a new sect. Christian David himself was led away. He\r\nwalked about like a shadow; he was sure that Krüger had a special Divine\r\nrevelation; he dug a private well for himself, and built himself a new\r\nhouse a few yards from the settlement, so that he might not be smirched\r\nby the pitch of Lutheran Christianity. Worse and ever worse waxed the\r\nconfusion. More \"horrible\"[75] became the new notions. The eloquent Krüger\r\nwent out of his mind; and was removed to the lunatic asylum at Berlin.\r\nBut the evil that he had done lived after him. The whole city on the\r\nhill was now a nest of fanatics. It was time for the Count himself to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nFor the last five years, while Herrnhut was growing, the Count had\r\nalmost ignored the refugees; and had quietly devoted his leisure time to\r\nhis darling scheme of establishing a village \"Church within the Church\"\r\nat Berthelsdorf. He had still his official State duties to perform. He\r\nwas still a King's Councillor at Dresden. He spent the winter months in\r\nthe city and the summer at his country-seat; and as long as the settlers\r\nbehaved themselves as loyal sons of the Lutheran Church he saw no\r\nreason to meddle in their affairs. He had, moreover, taken two wise\r\nprecautions. He had first issued a public notice that no refugee should\r\nsettle at Herrnhut unless compelled by persecution; and secondly, he\r\nhad called a meeting of the refugees themselves, and persuaded them\r\nto promise that in all their gatherings they would remain loyal to the\r\nAugsburg Confession.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the village itself, he had pushed his scheme with vigour.\r\nHe named his house Bethel; his estate was his parish; and his tenants\r\nwere his congregation. He had never forgotten his boyish vow to do all\r\nin his power to extend the Kingdom of Christ; and now he formed another\r\nsociety like the old Order of the Mustard Seed. It was called the\r\n\"League of the Four Brethren\"; it consisted of Zinzendorf, Friedrich\r\nde Watteville, and Pastors Rothe and Schäfer; and its object was to\r\nproclaim to the world, by means of a league of men devoted to\r\nChrist, \"that mystery and charm of the Incarnation which was not yet\r\nsufficiently recognized in the Church.\" He had several methods of work.\r\nAs he wished to reach the young folk of noble rank, he had a school\r\nfor noblemen's sons built on the Hutberg, and a school for noblemen's\r\ndaughters down in the village; and the members of the League all signed\r\nan agreement to subscribe the needful funds for the undertaking. As he\r\nwished, further, to appeal to men in various parts of the country, he\r\nestablished a printing-office at Ebersdorf, and from that office sent\r\nbooks, pamphlets, letters, and cheap editions of the Bible in all\r\ndirections. As he longed, thirdly, for personal contact with leading\r\nmen in the Church, he instituted a system of journeys to Halle and\r\nother centres of learning and piety. But his best work was done in\r\nBerthelsdorf. His steward, Heitz, gave the rustics Bible lessons; Pastor\r\nRothe preached awakening sermons in the parish church, and his preaching\r\nwas, as the Count declared, \"as though it rained flames from heaven\";\r\nand he himself, in the summer season, held daily singing meetings and\r\nprayer meetings in his own house. Hand in hand did he and Rothe work\r\nhard for the flock at Berthelsdorf. On a Sunday morning the pastor would\r\npreach a telling sermon in a crowded church; in the afternoon the squire\r\nwould gather his tenants in his house and expound to them the morning's\r\ndiscourse. The whole village was stirred; the Church was enlarged; and\r\nthe Count himself was so in earnest that if the slightest hitch occurred\r\nin a service he would burst into tears. While things in Herrnhut were\r\ngrowing worse things in Berthelsdorf were growing better; while stormy\r\nwinds blew on the hill there was peace and fellowship down in the\r\nvalley. How closely the Count and the pastor were linked may be seen\r\nfrom the following fact. The Count's family pew in the Church was a\r\nsmall gallery or raised box over the vestry; the box had a trap-door\r\nin the floor; the pastor, according to Lutheran custom, retired to the\r\nvestry at certain points in the service; and the Count, by opening the\r\naforesaid door, could communicate his wishes to the pastor.\r\n\r\nHe had now to apply his principles to Herrnhut. As long as the settlers\r\nhad behaved themselves well, and kept their promise to be loyal to the\r\nNational Church, he had left them alone to follow their own devices;\r\nand even if they sang old Brethren's hymns at their meetings, he had no\r\ninsuperable objection. But now the time had come to take stern measures.\r\nHe had taken them in out of charity; he had invited them to the meetings\r\nin his house; and now they had turned the place into a nest of scheming\r\ndissenters. There was war in the camp. On the one hand, Christian\r\nDavid called Rothe a narrow-minded churchman. On the other hand, Rothe\r\nthundered from his pulpit against the \"mad fanatics\" on the hill. As Jew\r\nand Samaritan in days of old, so now were Berthelsdorf and Herrnhut.\r\n\r\nAt this critical point the Count intervened, and changed the duel into\r\na duet {1727.}. He would have no makers of sects on his estate. With all\r\ntheir faults, he believed that the settlers were at bottom broad-minded\r\npeople. Only clear away the rubbish and the gold would be found\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n\"Although our dear Christian David,\" he said, \"was calling me the\r\nBeast and Mr. Rothe the False Prophet, we could see his honest heart\r\nnevertheless, and knew we could lead him right. It is not a bad maxim,\"\r\nhe added, \"when honest men are going wrong to put them into office,\r\nand they will learn from experience what they will never learn from\r\nspeculation.\"\r\n\r\nHe acted on that maxim now. He would teach the exiles to obey the law of\r\nthe land, to bow to his authority as lord of the manor, and to live in\r\nChristian fellowship with each other. For this purpose, he summoned them\r\nall to a mass meeting in the Great House on the Hutberg {May 12th.},\r\nlectured them for over three hours on the sin of schism, read out the\r\n\"Manorial Injunctions and Prohibitions,\"[76] which all inhabitants of\r\nHerrnhut must promise to obey, and then submitted a number of \"Statutes\"\r\nas the basis of a voluntary religious society. The effect was sudden\r\nand swift. At one bound the settlers changed from a group of quarrelling\r\nschismatics to an organized body of orderly Christian tenants; and\r\nforthwith the assembled settlers shook hands, and promised to obey the\r\nInjunctions and Prohibitions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Count had secured good law and order he obtained leave of\r\nabsence from Dresden, took up his residence at Herrnhut, and proceeded\r\nto organize all who wished into a systematic Church within the Church.\r\nFor this purpose he prepared another agreement {July 4th.}, entitled\r\nthe \"Brotherly Union and Compact,\" signed the agreement first himself,\r\npersuaded Christian David, Pastor Schäfer and another neighbouring\r\nclergyman to do the same, and then invited all the rest to follow suit.\r\nAgain, the goodwill was practically universal. As the settlers had\r\npromised on May 12th to obey the Manorial Injunctions and Prohibitions,\r\nso now, of their own free will, they signed a promise to end their\r\nsectarian quarrels, to obey the \"Statutes,\" and to live in fellowship\r\nwith Christians of all beliefs and denominations. Thus had the Count\r\naccomplished a double purpose. As lord of the manor he had crushed\r\nthe design to form a separate sect; and as Spener's disciple he had\r\npersuaded the descendants of the Bohemian Brethren to form another\r\n\"Church within the Church.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this all. As the Brethren looked back in later years to those\r\nmemorable days in Herrnhut, they came to regard the summer months of\r\n1727 as a holy, calm, sabbatic season, when one and all were quickened\r\nand stirred by the power of the Spirit Divine. \"The whole place,\" said\r\nZinzendorf himself, \"represented a visible tabernacle of God among men.\"\r\nFor the next four months the city on the hill was the home of ineffable\r\njoy; and the very men who had lately quarrelled with each other now\r\nformed little groups for prayer and praise. As the evening shadows\r\nlengthened across the square the whole settlement met to pray and\r\npraise, and talk with each other, like brothers and sisters of one home.\r\nThe fancies and vagaries fled. The Count held meetings every day. The\r\nChurch at Berthelsdorf was crowded out. The good David, now appointed\r\nChief Elder, persuaded all to study the art of love Divine by going\r\nthrough the First Epistle of St. John. The very children were stirred\r\nand awakened. The whole movement was calm, strong, deep and abiding.\r\nOf vulgar excitement there was none; no noisy meetings, no extravagant\r\nbabble, no religious tricks to work on the emotions. For mawkish,\r\nsentimental religion the Count had an honest contempt. \"It is,\" he said,\r\n\"as easy to create religious excitement as it is to stir up the sensual\r\npassions; and the former often leads to the latter.\" As the Brethren met\r\nin each other's homes, or on the Hutberg when the stars were shining,\r\nthey listened, with reverence and holy awe, to the still voice of that\r\nGood Shepherd who was leading them gently, step by step, to the green\r\npastures of peace.\r\n\r\nAmid the fervour the Count made an announcement which caused every cheek\r\nto flush with new delight. He had made a strange discovery. At Zittau,\r\nnot far away, was a reference library; and there, one day, he found\r\na copy of Comenius's Latin version of the old Brethren's \"Account of\r\nDiscipline.\" {July.} His eyes were opened at last. For the first time in\r\nhis busy life he read authentic information about the old Church of the\r\nBrethren; and discovered, to his amazement and joy, that so far from\r\nbeing disturbers of the peace, with a Unitarian taint in their blood,\r\nthey were pure upholders of the very faith so dear to his own heart.\r\n\r\nHis soul was stirred to its depths. \"I could not,\" he said, \"read\r\nthe lamentations of old Comenius, addressed to the Church of England,\r\nlamentations called forth by the idea that the Church of the Brethren\r\nhad come to an end, and that he was locking its door--I could not read\r\nhis mournful prayer, 'Turn Thou us unto Thee, O Lord, and we shall be\r\nturned; renew our days as of old,' without resolving there and then:\r\nI, as far as I can, will help to bring about this renewal. And though\r\nI have to sacrifice my earthly possessions, my honours and my life, as\r\nlong as I live I will do my utmost to see to it that this little flock\r\nof the Lord shall be preserved for Him until He come.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even this was not the strangest part of the story. As the Count\r\ndevoured the ancient treatise, he noticed that the rules laid down\r\ntherein were almost the same as the rules which he had just drawn up for\r\nthe refugees at Herrnhut. He returned to Herrnhut, reported his find,\r\nand read the good people extracts from the book {Aug. 4th.}. The\r\nsensation was profound. If this was like new milk to the Count it was\r\nlike old wine to the Brethren; and again the fire of their fathers\r\nburned in their veins.\r\n\r\nAnd now the coping stone was set on the temple {Aug. 13th.}. As the\r\nBrethren were learning, step by step, to love each other in true\r\nsincerity, Pastor Rothe now invited them all to set the seal to the work\r\nby coming in a body to Berthelsdorf Church, and there joining, with one\r\naccord, in the celebration of the Holy Communion. The Brethren accepted\r\nthe invitation with joy. The date fixed was Monday, August 13th. The\r\nsense of awe was overpowering. As the Brethren walked down the slope to\r\nthe church all felt that the supreme occasion had arrived; and all who\r\nhad quarrelled in the days gone by made a covenant of loyalty and love.\r\nAt the door of the church the strange sense of awe was thrilling. They\r\nentered the building; the service began; the \"Confession\" was offered\r\nby the Count; and then, at one and the same moment, all present, rapt\r\nin deep devotion, were stirred by the mystic wondrous touch of a power\r\nwhich none could define or understand. There, in Berthelsdorf Parish\r\nChurch, they attained at last the firm conviction that they were one in\r\nChrist; and there, above all, they believed and felt that on them, as on\r\nthe twelve disciples on the Day of Pentecost, had rested the purifying\r\nfire of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"We learned,\" said the Brethren, \"to love.\" \"From that time onward,\"\r\nsaid David Nitschmann, \"Herrnhut was a living Church of Jesus Christ. We\r\nthank the Lord that we ever came to Herrnhut, instead of pressing on, as\r\nwe intended, to Poland.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there the humble Brother spoke the truth. As the Brethren returned\r\nthat evening to Herrnhut, they felt within them a strength and joy they\r\nhad never known before. They had realised their calling in Christ. They\r\nhad won the Divine gift of Christian union. They had won that spirit of\r\nbrotherly love which only the great Good Spirit could give. They had won\r\nthat sense of fellowship with Christ, and fellowship with one another,\r\nwhich had been the costliest gem in the days of their fathers; and\r\ntherefore, in future, they honoured the day as the true spiritual\r\nbirthday of the Renewed Church of the Brethren. It is useless trying to\r\nexpress their feelings in prose. Let us listen to the moving words of\r\nthe Moravian poet, James Montgomery:--\r\n\r\n   They walked with God in peace and love,\r\n     But failed with one another;\r\n   While sternly for the faith they strove,\r\n     Brother fell out with brother;\r\n   But He in Whom they put their trust,\r\n   Who knew their frames, that they were dust,\r\n     Pitied and healed their weakness.\r\n\r\n   He found them in His house of prayer,\r\n     With one accord assembled,\r\n   And so revealed His presence there,\r\n     They wept for joy and trembled;\r\n   One cup they drank, one bread they brake,\r\n   One baptism shared, one language spake,\r\n     Forgiving and forgiven.\r\n\r\n   Then forth they went, with tongues of flame,\r\n     In one blest theme delighting,\r\n   The love of Jesus and His Name,\r\n     God's children all uniting!\r\n   That love, our theme and watchword still;\r\n   That law of love may we fulfil,\r\n     And love as we are loved.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to see that the blessing was not lost {Aug. 27th.}.\r\nFor this purpose the Brethren, a few days later, arranged a system of\r\nHourly Intercession. As the fire on the altar in the Jewish Temple\r\nwas never allowed to go out, so the Brethren resolved that in this\r\nnew temple of the Lord the incense of intercessory prayer should rise\r\ncontinually day and night. Henceforth, Herrnhut in very truth should\r\nbe the \"Watch of the Lord.\" The whole day was carefully mapped out, and\r\neach Brother or Sister took his or her turn. Of all the prayer unions\r\never organized surely this was one of the most remarkable. It is said to\r\nhave lasted without interruption for over a hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. -- LIFE AT HERRNHUT.\r\n\r\nAs we study the social and religious system which now developed at\r\nHerrnhut, it is well to bear in mind the fact that when the Count, as\r\nlord of the manor, first issued his \"Injunctions and Prohibitions,\" he\r\nwas not aware that, in so doing, he was calling back to life once more\r\nthe discipline of the old Bohemian Brethren. He had not yet read the\r\nhistory of the Brethren, and he had not yet studied Comenius's \"Account\r\nof Discipline.\" He knew but little of the Brethren's past, and the\r\nlittle that he knew was wrong; and, having no other plan to guide him,\r\nhe took as his model the constitution lying ready to hand in the average\r\nGerman village of the day, and adapted that simple constitution to\r\nthe special needs of the exiles.[77] He had no desire to make Herrnhut\r\nindependent. It was still to be a part of his estate, and conform to\r\nthe laws of the land; and still to be the home of a \"Church within the\r\nChurch,\" as planned by Luther long ago in his famous German Mass.\r\n\r\nFirst, then the Count laid down the rule that all male adults in\r\nHerrnhut, no matter to what sect they might belong, should have a voice\r\nin the election of twelve Elders; and henceforward these twelve Elders,\r\nlike those in the neighbouring estates of Silesia, had control over\r\nevery department of life, and enforced the Injunctions and Prohibitions\r\nwith an iron hand. They levied the usual rates and taxes to keep the\r\nstreets and wells in order. They undertook the care of widows and\r\norphans. They watched the relations of single young men and women. They\r\nkept a sharp eye on the doings at the inn. They called to order the\r\ntellers of evil tales; and they banished from Herrnhut all who disobeyed\r\nthe laws, or conducted themselves in an unbecoming, frivolous or\r\noffensive manner.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Elders was enormous. If a new refugee desired to settle\r\nin Herrnhut, he must first obtain permission from the Elders. If a\r\nsettler desired to go on a journey, he must first obtain permission from\r\nthe Elders. If a man desired to build a house; if a trader desired to\r\nchange his calling; if an apprentice desired to leave his master; if a\r\nvisitor desired to stay the night, he must first obtain permission from\r\nthe Elders. If a man fell in love and desired to marry, he must first\r\nobtain the approval of the Elders; and until that approval had been\r\nobtained, he was not allowed to propose to the choice of his heart. Let\r\nus see the reason for this remarkable strictness.\r\n\r\nAs the Brethren settled down in Herrnhut, they endeavoured, under the\r\nCount's direction, to realize the dignity of labour. For rich and poor,\r\nfor Catholic and Protestant, for all able-bodied men and women, the same\r\nstern rule held good. If a man desired to settle at Herrnhut, the one\r\nsupreme condition was that he earned his bread by honest toil, and lived\r\na godly, righteous and sober life. For industrious Catholics there was a\r\nhearty welcome; for vagabonds, tramps and whining beggars there was\r\nnot a bed to spare. If a man would work he might stay, and worship God\r\naccording to his conscience; but if he was lazy, he was ordered off the\r\npremises. As the Brethren met on Sunday morning for early worship in the\r\npublic hall, they joined with one accord in the prayer, \"Bless the sweat\r\nof the brow and faithfulness in business\"; and the only business they\r\nallowed was business which they could ask the Lord to bless. To them\r\nwork was a sacred duty, a delight and a means for the common good. If\r\na man is blessed who has found his work, then blessed were the folk at\r\nHerrnhut. \"We do not work to live,\" said the Count; \"we live to work.\"\r\nThe whole aim was the good of each and the good of all. As the grocer\r\nstood behind his counter, or the weaver plied his flying shuttle, he was\r\ntoiling, not for himself alone, but for all his Brethren and Sisters.\r\nIf a man desired to set up in business, he had first to obtain the\r\npermission of the Elders; and the Elders refused to grant the permission\r\nunless they thought that the business in question was needed by the rest\r\nof the people. \"No brother,\" ran the law at Herrnhut, \"shall compete\r\nwith his brother in trade.\" No man was allowed to lend money on interest\r\nwithout the consent of the Elders. If two men had any dispute in\r\nbusiness, they must come to terms within a week; and if they did not,\r\nor went to law, they were expelled. If a man could buy an article in\r\nHerrnhut, he was not allowed to buy it anywhere else.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see the purpose of these regulations. They were an\r\nattempt to solve the social problem, to banish competition, and to put\r\nco-operation in its place. For some years the scheme was crowned with\r\nglorious success. The settlement grew; the trade flourished; the great\r\nfirm of Dürninger obtained a world-wide reputation; the women were\r\nskilled in weaving and spinning; and the whole system worked so well\r\nthat in 1747 the Saxon Government besought the Count to establish a\r\nsimilar settlement at Barby. At Herrnhut, in a word, if nowhere else,\r\nthe social problem was solved. There, at least, the aged and ill could\r\nlive in peace and comfort; there grim poverty was unknown; there the\r\nwidow and orphan were free from carking care; and there men and women of\r\nhumble rank had learned the truth that when men toil for the common good\r\nthere is a perennial nobleness in work.[78]\r\nFor pleasure the Brethren had neither time nor taste. They worked, on\r\nthe average, sixteen hours a day, allowed only five hours for sleep,\r\nand spent the remaining three at meals and meetings. The Count was as\r\nPuritanic as Oliver Cromwell himself. For some reason he had come to the\r\nconclusion that the less the settlers knew of pleasure the better, and\r\ntherefore he laid down the law that all strolling popular entertainers\r\nshould be forbidden to enter the holy city. No public buffoon ever\r\ncracked his jokes at Herrnhut. No tight-rope dancer poised on giddy\r\nheight. No barrel-dancer rolled his empty barrel. No tout for lotteries\r\nswindled the simple. No juggler mystified the children. No cheap-jack\r\ncheated the innocent maidens. No quack-doctor sold his nasty pills. No\r\nmelancholy bear made his feeble attempt to dance. For the social joys\r\nof private life the laws were stricter still. At Herrnhut, ran one\r\ncomprehensive clause, there were to be no dances whatever, no wedding\r\nbreakfasts, no christening bumpers, no drinking parties, no funeral\r\nfeasts, and no games like those played in the surrounding villages. No\r\nbride at Herrnhut ever carried a bouquet. No sponsor ever gave the new\r\narrival a mug or a silver spoon.\r\n\r\nFor sins of the coarse and vulgar kind there was no mercy. If a man got\r\ndrunk, or cursed, or stole, or used his fists, or committed adultery or\r\nfornication, he was expelled, and not permitted to return till he\r\nhad given infallible proofs of true repentance. No guilty couple were\r\nallowed to \"cheat the parson.\" No man was allowed to strike his wife,\r\nand no wife was allowed to henpeck her husband; and any woman found\r\nguilty of the latter crime was summoned before the board of Elders and\r\nreprimanded in public.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Count insisted on civil order. He appointed a number of other\r\nofficials. Some, called servants, had to clean the wells, to sweep the\r\nstreets, to repair the houses, and to trim the gardens. For the sick\r\nthere was a board of sick waiters; for the poor a board of almoners;\r\nfor the wicked a board of monitors; for the ignorant a board of\r\nschoolmasters; and each board held a conference every week. Once a week,\r\non Saturday nights, the Elders met in Council; once a week, on Monday\r\nmornings, they announced any new decrees; and all inhabitants vowed\r\nobedience to them as Elders, to the Count as Warden, and finally to the\r\nlaw of the land. Thus had the Count, as lord of the manor, drawn up a\r\ncode of civil laws to be binding on all. We have finished the Manorial\r\nInjunctions and Prohibitions. We come to the free religious life of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nLet us first clear a difficulty out of the way. As the Count was a loyal\r\nson of the Lutheran Church, and regarded the Augsburg Confession as\r\ninspired,[79] it seems, at first sight, a marvellous fact that here at\r\nHerrnhut he allowed the Brethren to take steps which led ere long to the\r\nrenewal of their Church. He allowed them to sing Brethren's Hymns; he\r\nallowed them to revive old Brethren's customs; he allowed them to hold\r\nindependent meetings; and he even resolved to do his best to revive the\r\nold Church himself. His conduct certainly looked very inconsistent. If\r\na man in England were to call himself a loyal member of the Anglican\r\nChurch, and yet at the same time do his very best to found an\r\nindependent denomination, he would soon be denounced as a traitor to the\r\nChurch and a breeder of schism and dissent. But the Count's conduct can\r\nbe easily explained. It was all due to his ignorance of history. He had\r\nno idea that the Bohemian Brethren had ever been an independent Church.\r\nHe regarded them as a branch of the Reformed persuasion. He regarded\r\nthem as a \"Church within the Church,\" of the kind for which Luther had\r\nlonged, and which Spener had already established. He held his delusion\r\ndown to the end of his days; and, therefore, as Lutheran and Pietist\r\nalike, he felt at liberty to help the Brethren in all their religious\r\nendeavours.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, therefore, he asked the settlers at Herrnhut to sign\r\ntheir names to a voluntary \"Brotherly Union\"; and the chief condition of\r\nthe \"Union\" was that all the members agreed to live in friendship with\r\nChristians of other denominations, and also to regard themselves as\r\nmembers of the Lutheran Church. They attended the regular service at the\r\nParish Church. There they took the Holy Communion; there they had their\r\nchildren baptized; and there the young people were confirmed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the movement at Herrnhut was growing fast. The great point was\r\nto guard against religious poison. As the Count had a healthy horror of\r\nworks of darkness, he insisted that no meetings should be held without\r\na light; and the Brethren set their faces against superstition. They\r\nforbade ghost-stories; they condemned the popular old-wives' tales about\r\ntokens, omens and death-birds; they insisted that, in case of illness,\r\nno meddling busybody should interfere with the doctor; and thus, as\r\nhomely, practical folk, they aimed at health of body and of mind.\r\n\r\nBut the chief object of their ambition was health of soul. As the\r\nrevival deepened, the number of meetings increased. Not a day passed\r\nwithout three meetings for the whole congregation. At five in the\r\nmorning they met in the hall, and joined in a chorus of praise. At the\r\ndinner hour they met again, and then, about nine o'clock, after supper,\r\nthey sang themselves to rest. At an early period the whole congregation\r\nwas divided into ninety unions for prayer, and each band met two\r\nor three times a week. The night was as sacred as the day. As the\r\nnight-watchman went his rounds, he sang a verse at the hour, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n   The clock is eight! to Herrnhut all is told,\r\n   How Noah and his seven were saved of old,\r\n   Hear, Brethren, hear! the hour of nine is come!\r\n   Keep pure each heart, and chasten every home!\r\n   Hear, Brethren, hear! now ten the hour-hand shows;\r\n   They only rest who long for night's repose.\r\n   The clock's eleven, and ye have heard it all,\r\n   How in that hour the mighty God did call.\r\n   It's midnight now, and at that hour you know,\r\n   With lamp to meet the bridegroom we must go.\r\n   The hour is one; through darkness steals the day;\r\n   Shines in your hearts the morning star's first ray?\r\n   The clock is two! who comes to meet the day,\r\n   And to the Lord of days his homage pay?\r\n   The clock is three! the Three in One above\r\n   Let body, soul and spirit truly love.\r\n   The clock is four! where'er on earth are three,\r\n   The Lord has promised He the fourth will be.\r\n   The clock is five! while five away were sent,\r\n   Five other virgins to the marriage went!\r\n   The clock is six, and from the watch I'm free,\r\n   And every one may his own watchman be!\r\n\r\nAt this task all male inhabitants, over sixteen and under sixty, took\r\ntheir turn. The watchman, in the intervals between the hours, sang other\r\nsnatches of sacred song; and thus anyone who happened to be lying awake\r\nwas continually reminded of the presence of God.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday nearly every hour of the day was occupied by services. At five\r\nthere was a short meeting, known as the \"morning blessing.\" From six\r\nto nine there were meetings for the several \"choirs.\" At ten there was a\r\nspecial service for children. At eleven there was morning worship in\r\nthe Parish Church. At one the Chief Elder gave a general exhortation.\r\nAt three, or thereabouts, there was a meeting, called the \"strangers'\r\nservice,\" for those who had not been able to go to Church; and then the\r\nCount or some other layman repeated the morning sermon. At four there\r\nwas another service at Berthelsdorf; at eight another service at\r\nHerrnhut; at nine the young men marched round the settlement singing\r\nhymns; and on Monday morning these wonderful folk returned to their\r\nlabour like giants refreshed with new wine. Their powers of endurance\r\nwere miraculous. The more meetings they had the more they seemed able to\r\nstand. Sometimes the good Pastor Schwedler, of Görlitz, would give\r\nthem a sermon three hours long; and sometimes, commencing at six in\r\nthe morning, he held his congregation enthralled till three in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Brethren listened day by day to a special message from God.\r\nWe come now to the origin of the Moravian Text-book. As the Count was\r\na great believer in variety, he very soon started the practice, at the\r\nregular evening singing meeting, of giving the people a short address on\r\nsome Scriptural text or some verse from a hymn. As soon as the singing\r\nmeeting was over he read out to the company the chosen passage,\r\nrecommended it as a suitable subject for meditation the following day,\r\nand next morning had the text passed round by the Elders to every house\r\nin Herrnhut. Next year (1728) the practice was better organized. Instead\r\nof waiting for the Count to choose, the Elders selected in advance a\r\nnumber of texts and verses, and put them all together into a box; and\r\nthen, each evening, one of the Elders put his hand into the box and\r\ndrew the text for the following day. The idea was that of a special\r\nProvidence. If Christ, said the Count, took a special interest in every\r\none of His children, He would also take the same kindly interest in\r\nevery company of believers; and, therefore, He might be safely trusted\r\nto guide the hand of the Elder aright and provide the \"watchword\" needed\r\nfor the day. Again and again he exhorted the Brethren to regard the text\r\nfor the day as God's special message to them; and finally, in 1731, he\r\nhad the texts for the whole year printed, and thus began that Brethren's\r\nText-book which now appears regularly every year, is issued in several\r\ntongues, and circulates, in every quarter of the globe, among Christians\r\nof all denominations.[80]\r\nIn order, next, to keep in touch with their fellow-Christians the\r\nBrethren instituted a monthly Saturday meeting, and that Saturday came\r\nto be known as \"Congregation Day.\" {Feb. 10th, 1728.} At this meeting\r\nthe Brethren listened to reports of evangelical work in other districts.\r\nSometimes there would be a letter from a travelling Brother; sometimes a\r\nvisitor from some far-distant strand. The meeting was a genuine sign of\r\nmoral health. It fostered broadness of mind, and put an end to spiritual\r\npride. Instead of regarding themselves as Pietists, superior to the\r\naverage professing Christians, the Brethren now rejoiced to hear of the\r\ngood done by others. They prayed not for their own narrow circle alone,\r\nbut for all rulers, all churches, and all people that on earth do dwell;\r\nand delighted to sing old Brethren's hymns, treating of the Church\r\nUniversal, such as John Augusta's \"Praise God for ever\" and \"How amiable\r\nThy tabernacles are.\" At this monthly meeting the Count was in his\r\nelement. He would keep his audience enthralled for hours together. He\r\nwould read them first a piece of news in vivid, dramatic style; then he\r\nwould suddenly strike up a missionary hymn; then he would give them a\r\nlittle more information; and thus he taught them to take an interest in\r\nlands beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of moral health was the \"Love-feast.\" As the Brethren met\r\nin each other's houses, they attempted, in quite an unofficial way, to\r\nrevive the Agape of Apostolic times; and to this end they provided a\r\nsimple meal of rye-bread and water, wished each other the wish, \"Long\r\nlive the Lord Jesus in our hearts,\" and talked in a free-and-easy\r\nfashion about the Kingdom of God. And here the Brethren were on their\r\nguard. In the days of the Apostles there had been scandals. The rich\r\nhad brought their costly food, and the poor had been left to pine. At\r\nHerrnhut this scandal was avoided. For rich and poor the diet was the\r\nsame, and came from a common fund; in later years it was white bread and\r\ntea; and in due time the Love-feast took the form of a meeting for the\r\nwhole congregation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Brethren were wonderfully simple-minded. As we read about\r\ntheir various meetings, it is clear that in their childlike way they\r\nwere trying to revive the institutions of Apostolic times. For this\r\npurpose they even practised the ceremony of foot-washing, as described\r\nin the Gospel of St. John. To the Count the clear command of Christ was\r\ndecisive. \"If I then, your Lord and Master,\" said Jesus, \"have washed\r\nyour feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.\" What words, said\r\nthe Count, could be more binding than these? \"No man,\" he declared, \"can\r\nread John xiii. without being convinced that this should be done.\" He\r\nrevived the custom, and made it both popular and useful. The ceremony\r\nwas generally performed by the young, before some special festival. It\r\nspread in time to England and Ireland, and was not abandoned till the\r\nearly years of the nineteenth century[81] (1818).\r\n\r\nWe come now to the origin of the \"choirs.\" As Zinzendorf studied the\r\nGospel story, he came to the conclusion that in the life of Jesus Christ\r\nthere was something specially suitable to each estate in life. For\r\nthe married people there was Christ, the Bridegroom of His Bride, the\r\nChurch; for the single Brethren, the \"man about thirty years of age\";\r\nfor the single Sisters, the Virgin Mary; for the children, the boy in\r\nthe temple asking questions. The idea took root. The more rapidly the\r\nsettlement grew, the more need there was for division and organization.\r\nFor each class the Master had a special message, and, therefore, each\r\nclass must have its special meetings and study its special duties. For\r\nthis purpose a band of single men--led by the ascetic Martin Linner, who\r\nslept on bare boards--agreed to live in one house, spent the evenings\r\nin united study, and thus laid the basis of the Single Brethren's Choir\r\n{Aug. 29th, 1728.}. For the same purpose the single young women, led by\r\nAnna Nitschmann, agreed to live in a \"Single Sisters' House,\" and made\r\na covenant with one another that henceforward they would not make\r\nmatrimony the highest aim in life, but would rather, like Mary of\r\nBethany, sit at the feet of Christ and learn of Him {May 4th, 1730.}.\r\nFor the same purpose the married people met at a love-feast, formed the\r\n\"married choir,\" and promised to lead a pure and holy life {Sept. 7th,\r\n1733.}, \"so that their children might be plants of righteousness.\"\r\nFor the same purpose the children, in due time, were formed into a\r\n\"children's choir.\" The whole aim was efficiency and order. At first the\r\nunions were voluntary; in time they became official.\r\n\r\nAs the years rolled on the whole congregation was systematically divided\r\ninto ten \"choirs,\" as follows:--The married choir, the widowers, the\r\nwidows, the Single Brethren, the Single Sisters, the youths, the great\r\ngirls, the little boys, the little girls, the infants in arms. Each\r\nchoir had its own president, its own special services, its own festival\r\nday, its own love-feasts. Of these choirs the most important were those\r\nof the Single Brethren and Single Sisters. As the Brethren at Herrnhut\r\nwere soon to be busy in evangelistic labours, they found it convenient\r\nto have in their ranks a number of men and women who were not bound down\r\nby family ties; and though the young people took no celibate vows, they\r\noften kept single through life for the sake of the growing cause.\r\n\r\nThe system invaded the sanctity of family life. As the Count was a\r\nfamily man himself, he very properly took the deepest interest in\r\nthe training of little children; and, in season and out of season, he\r\ninsisted that the children of Christian parents should be screened from\r\nthe seductions of the world, the flesh and the devil. \"It is nothing\r\nless than a scandal,\" he said, \"that people think so little of the\r\nfact that their children are dedicated to the Lord. Children are little\r\nkings; their baptism is their anointing; and as kings they ought to be\r\ntreated from the first.\" For this purpose he laid down the rule that\r\nall infants should be baptized in the hall, in the presence of the whole\r\ncongregation; and as soon as the children were old enough to learn, he\r\nhad them taken from their homes, and put the little boys in one school\r\nand the little girls in another. And thus the burden of their education\r\nfell not on the parents, but on the congregation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Count carried out his ideas in the \"vasty halls of death.\"\r\nOf all the sacred spots in Herrnhut there were none more sacred and more\r\nawe-inspiring than the \"God's Acre\" which the Brethren laid out on the\r\nHutberg. There, in the bosom of Mother Earth, the same division into\r\nchoirs was preserved. To the Count the tomb was a holy place. If a\r\nvisitor ever came to Herrnhut, he was sure to take him to the\r\nGod's Acre, and tell him the story of those whose bones awaited\r\nthe resurrection of the just. The God's Acre became the scene of an\r\nimpressive service {1733.}. At an early hour on Easter Sunday the\r\nBrethren assembled in the sacred presence of the dead, and waited for\r\nthe sun to rise. As the golden rim appeared on the horizon, the minister\r\nspoke the first words of the service. \"The Lord is risen,\" said the\r\nminister. \"He is risen indeed!\" responded the waiting throng. And then,\r\nin the beautiful language of Scripture, the Brethren joined in a solemn\r\nconfession of faith. The trombones that woke the morning echoes led the\r\nanthem of praise, and one and all, in simple faith, looked onward to\r\nthe glorious time when those who lay in the silent tomb should hear the\r\nvoice of the Son of God, and be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord\r\nin the air. To the Brethren the tomb was no abode of dread. In a tomb\r\nthe Lord Himself had lain; in a tomb His humble disciples lay \"asleep\";\r\nand therefore, when a brother departed this life, the mourners never\r\nspoke of him as dead. \"He is gone home,\" they said; and so death lost\r\nhis sting.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Brethren had a strong belief in direct answers to prayer.\r\nIt was this that led them to make such use of the \"Lot.\" As soon as\r\nthe first twelve Elders were elected, the Brethren chose from among the\r\ntwelve a committee of four by Lot; and in course of time the Lot was\r\nused for a great variety of purposes. By the Lot, as we shall see later\r\non, the most serious ecclesiastical problems were settled. By the Lot a\r\nsister determined her answer to an offer of marriage. By the Lot a call\r\nto service was given, and by the Lot it was accepted or rejected. If\r\nonce the Lot had been consulted, the decision was absolute and binding.\r\nThe prayer had been answered, the Lord had spoken, and the servant must\r\nnow obey.[82]\r\nWe have now to mention but one more custom, dating from those great\r\ndays. It is one peculiar to the Brethren's Church, and is known as the\r\n\"Cup of Covenant.\" It was established by the Single Brethren, {1729.}\r\nand was based on the act of Christ Himself, as recorded in the Gospel of\r\nSt. Luke. As the Master sat with His twelve disciples in the Upper Room\r\nat Jerusalem, we are told that just before the institution of the Lord's\r\nSupper,[83] \"He took the Cup and gave thanks, and said, 'Take this and\r\ndivide it among yourselves'\"; and now, in obedience to this command,\r\nthis ardent band of young disciples made a covenant to be true to\r\nChrist, and passed the Cup from hand to hand. Whenever a young brother\r\nwas called out to the mission field, the whole choir would meet and\r\nentrust him to Christ in this simple and scriptural way. It was the\r\npledge at once of united service and united trust. It spread, in course\r\nof time, to the other choirs; it is practised still at the annual\r\nchoir festivals; and its meaning is best expressed in the words of the\r\nBrethren's Covenant Hymn:--\r\n\r\n   Assembling here, a humble band,\r\n     Our covenantal pledge to take,\r\n   We pass the cup from hand to hand,\r\n     From heart to heart, for His dear sake.\r\n\r\nIt remains to answer two important questions. As we study the life of\r\nthe Herrnhut Brethren, we cannot possibly fail to notice how closely\r\ntheir institutions resembled the old institutions of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren. We have the same care for the poor, the same ascetic ideal of\r\nlife, the same adherence to the word of Scripture, the same endeavour to\r\nrevive Apostolic practice, the same semi-socialistic tendency, the\r\nsame aspiration after brotherly unity, the same title, \"Elder,\" for the\r\nleading officials, and the same, or almost the same, method of electing\r\nsome of these officials by Lot. And, therefore, we naturally ask the\r\nquestion, how far were these Brethren guided by the example of their\r\nfathers? The reply is, not at all. At this early stage in their history\r\nthe Moravian refugees at Herrnhut knew absolutely nothing of the\r\ninstitutions of the Bohemian Brethren.[84] They had no historical records\r\nin their possession; they had not preserved any copies of the ancient\r\nlaws; they brought no books but hymn-books across the border; and they\r\nframed their rules and organized their society before they had even\r\nheard of the existence of Comenius's \"Account of Discipline.\" The whole\r\nmovement at Herrnhut was free, spontaneous, original. It was not an\r\nimitation of the past. It was not an attempt to revive the Church of the\r\nBrethren. It was simply the result of Zinzendorf's attempt to apply the\r\nideals of the Pietist Spener to the needs of the settlers on his estate.\r\n\r\nThe second question is, what was the ecclesiastical standing of the\r\nBrethren at this time? They were not a new church or sect. They had\r\nno separate ministry of their own. They were members of the Lutheran\r\nChurch, regarded Rothe still as their Pastor, attended the Parish\r\nChurch on Sundays, and took the Communion there once a month; and what\r\ndistinguished them from the average orthodox Lutheran of the day was,\r\nnot any peculiarity of doctrine, but rather their vivid perception of a\r\ndoctrine common to all the Churches. As the Methodists in England a few\r\nyears later exalted the doctrine of \"conversion,\" so these Brethren at\r\nHerrnhut exalted the doctrine of the spiritual presence of Christ. To\r\nthem the ascended Christ was all in all. He had preserved the \"Hidden\r\nSeed.\" He had led them out from Moravia. He had brought them to a\r\nwatch-tower. He had delivered them from the secret foe. He had banished\r\nthe devouring demon of discord, had poured out His Holy Spirit upon them\r\nat their memorable service in the Parish Church, and had taught them\r\nto maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. He was the\r\n\"Bridegroom of the Soul,\" the \"Blood Relation of His People,\" the\r\n\"King's Son seeking for His Bride, the Church,\" the \"Chief Elder\r\npleading for the Church before God.\" And this thought of the living and\r\nreigning Christ was, therefore, the ruling thought among the Brethren.\r\nHe had done three marvellous things for the sons of men. He had given\r\nHis life as a \"ransom\" for sin, and had thereby reconciled them to God;\r\nHe had set the perfect example for them to follow; He was present with\r\nthem now as Head of the Church; and thus, when the Brethren went out to\r\npreach, they made His Sacrificial Death, His Holy Life, and His abiding\r\npresence the main substance of their Gospel message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. -- THE EDICT OF BANISHMENT, 1729-1736.\r\n\r\nBut Zinzendorf was not long allowed to tread the primrose path of\r\npeace. As the news of his proceedings spread in Germany, many orthodox\r\nLutherans began to regard him as a nuisance, a heretic, and a disturber\r\nof the peace; and one critic made the elegant remark: \"When Count\r\nZinzendorf flies up into the air, anyone who pulls him down by the legs\r\nwill do him a great service.\" He was accused of many crimes, and had\r\nmany charges to answer. He was accused of founding a new sect, a society\r\nfor laziness; he was accused of holding strange opinions, opposed to\r\nthe teaching of the Lutheran Church; he was accused of being a sham\r\nChristian, a sort of religious freak; and now he undertook the task\r\nof proving that these accusations were false, and of showing all\r\nfair-minded men in Germany that the Brethren at Herrnhut were as\r\northodox as Luther, as respected as the King, and as pious as good old\r\nDr. Spener himself. His methods were bold and straightforward.\r\n\r\nHe began by issuing a manifesto {Aug. 12th, 1729.}, entitled the\r\n\"Notariats-Instrument.\" As this document was signed by all the Herrnhut\r\nBrethren, they must have agreed to its statements; but, on the other\r\nhand, it is fairly certain that it was drawn up by Zinzendorf himself.\r\nIt throws a flood of light on his state of mind. He had begun to think\r\nmore highly of the Moravian Church. He regarded the Moravians as the\r\nkernel of the Herrnhut colony, and now he deliberately informed\r\nthe public that, so far from being a new sect, these Moravians were\r\ndescendants of an ancient Church. They were, he declared, true heirs of\r\nthe Church of the Brethren; and that Church, in days gone by, had been\r\nrecognized by Luther, Calvin and others as a true Church of Christ. In\r\ndoctrine that Church was as orthodox as the Lutheran; in discipline it\r\nwas far superior. As long, therefore, as the Brethren were allowed to do\r\nso, they would maintain their old constitution and discipline; and yet,\r\non the other hand, they would not be Dissenters. They were not Hussites;\r\nthey were not Waldenses; they were not Fraticelli; they honoured the\r\nAugsburg Confession; they would still attend the Berthelsdorf\r\nParish Church; and, desirous of cultivating fellowship with all true\r\nChristians, they announced their broad position in the sentence: \"We\r\nacknowledge no public Church of God except where the pure Word of God\r\nis preached, and where the members live as holy children of God.\" Thus\r\nZinzendorf made his policy fairly clear. He wanted to preserve the\r\nMoravian Church inside the Lutheran Church![85]\r\nHis next move was still more daring. He was a man of fine missionary\r\nzeal. As the woman who found the lost piece of silver invited her\r\nfriends and neighbours to share in her joy, so Zinzendorf wished all\r\nChristians to share in the treasure which he had discovered at Herrnhut.\r\nHe believed that the Brethren there were called to a world-wide mission.\r\nHe wanted Herrnhut to be a city set on a hill. \"I have no sympathy,\" he\r\nsaid, \"with those comfortable people who sit warming themselves before\r\nthe fire of the future life.\" He did not sit long before the fire\r\nhimself. He visited the University of Jena, founded a society among\r\nthe students, and so impressed the learned Spangenberg that that great\r\ntheological scholar soon became a Brother at Herrnhut himself. He\r\nvisited the University of Halle, and founded another society of students\r\nthere. He visited Elmsdorf in Vogtland, and founded a society consisting\r\nof members of the family of Count Reuss. He visited Berleburg in\r\nWestphalia, made the acquaintance of John Conrad Dippel, and tried to\r\nlead that straying sheep back to the Lutheran fold. He visited Budingen\r\nin Hesse, discoursed on Christian fellowship to the \"French Prophets,\"\r\nor \"Inspired Ones,\" and tried to teach their hysterical leader, Rock,\r\na little wisdom, sobriety and charity. He attended the coronation of\r\nChristian VI., King of Denmark, at Copenhagen, was warmly welcomed\r\nby His Majesty, received the Order of the Danebrog, saw Eskimos from\r\nGreenland and a negro from St. Thomas, and thus opened the door, as we\r\nshall see later on, for the great work of foreign missions. Meanwhile,\r\nhe was sending messengers in all directions. He sent two Brethren to\r\nCopenhagen, with a short historical account of Herrnhut. He sent two\r\nothers to London to see the Queen, and to open up negotiations with the\r\nSociety for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He sent another to Sweden;\r\nothers to Hungary and Austria; others to Switzerland; others to Moravia;\r\nothers to the Baltic Provinces, Livonia and Esthonia. And everywhere his\r\nobject was the same--the formation of societies for Christian fellowship\r\nwithin the National Church.\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, he acted like a fanatic, and manifested the\r\nfirst symptoms of that weak trait in his character which nearly wrecked\r\nhis career. As he pondered one day on the state of affairs at Herrnhut,\r\nit suddenly flashed upon his mind that the Brethren would do far better\r\nwithout their ancient constitution. He first consulted the Elders and\r\nHelpers {Jan. 7th, 1731.}; he then summoned the whole congregation; and\r\nthere and then he deliberately proposed that the Brethren should abolish\r\ntheir regulations, abandon their constitution, cease to be Moravians and\r\nbecome pure Lutherans. At that moment Zinzendorf was calmly attempting\r\nto destroy the Moravian Church. He did not want to see that Church\r\nrevive. For some reason of his own, which he never explained in print,\r\nhe had come to the conclusion that the Brethren would serve Christ far\r\nbetter without any special regulations of their own. But the Brethren\r\nwere not disposed to meek surrender. The question was keenly debated. At\r\nlength, however, both sides agreed to appeal to a strange tribunal. For\r\nthe first time in the history of Herrnhut a critical question of Church\r\npolicy was submitted to the Lot.[86] The Brethren took two slips of paper\r\nand put them into a box. On the first were the words, \"To them that are\r\nwithout law, as without law, that I might gain them that are without\r\nlaw,\" 1 Cor. ix. 21; on the second the words, \"Therefore, Brethren,\r\nstand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught,\" 2 Thess.\r\nii. 15. At that moment the fate of the Church hung in the balance; the\r\nquestion at issue was one of life and death; and the Brethren spent a\r\nlong time in anxious prayer. If the first slip of paper was drawn, the\r\nChurch would cease to exist; if the second, she might still live by the\r\nblessing of God. Young Christel, Zinzendorf's son, now entered the room.\r\nHe drew the second slip of paper, and the Moravian Church was saved. To\r\nZinzendorf this was an event of momentous importance. As soon as\r\nthat second slip of paper was drawn, he felt convinced that God had\r\nsanctioned the renewal of the Moravian Church.\r\n\r\nNext year an event occurred to strengthen his convictions. A body of\r\ncommissioners from Dresden appeared at Herrnhut {Jan. 19-22, 1732.}.\r\nThey attended all the Sunday services, had private interviews with the\r\nBrethren, and sent in their report to the Saxon Government. The Count's\r\nconduct had excited public alarm. He had welcomed not only Moravians at\r\nHerrnhut, but Schwenkfelders at Berthelsdorf; and, therefore, he was now\r\nsuspected of harbouring dangerous fanatics. For a long time the issue\r\nhung doubtful; but finally the Government issued a decree that while the\r\nSchwenkfelders must quit the land, the Moravians should be allowed to\r\nstay as long as they behaved themselves quietly {April 4th, 1733.}.\r\n\r\nBut Zinzendorf was not yet satisfied. He regarded the edict as an\r\ninsult. The words about \"behaving quietly\" looked like a threat. As long\r\nas the Brethren were merely \"tolerated,\" their peace was in constant\r\ndanger; and a King who had driven out the Schwenkfelders might soon\r\ndrive out the Herrnhuters. He was disgusted. At the time when the edict\r\nwas issued, he himself was returning from a visit to Tübingen. He had\r\nlaid the whole case of the Brethren before the Tübingen Theological\r\nFaculty. He had asked these theological experts to say whether the\r\nBrethren could keep their discipline and yet be considered good\r\nLutherans; and the experts, in reply, had declared their opinion that\r\nthe Herrnhut Brethren were as loyal Lutherans as any in the land.\r\nThus the Brethren were standing now on a shaky floor. According to the\r\nTübingen Theological Faculty they were good members of the National\r\nChurch; according to the Government they were a \"sect\" to be tolerated!\r\n\r\nNext year he adopted three defensive measures {1734.}. First, he divided\r\nthe congregation at Herrnhut into two parts, the Moravian and the purely\r\nLutheran; next, he had himself ordained as a Lutheran clergyman; and\r\nthird, he despatched a few Moravians to found a colony in Georgia. He\r\nwas now, he imagined, prepared for the worst. If the King commanded the\r\nMoravians to go, the Count had his answer ready. As he himself was\r\na Lutheran clergyman, he would stay at Herrnhut and minister to the\r\nHerrnhut Lutherans; and the Moravians could all sail away to Georgia,\r\nand live in perfect peace in the land of the free.\r\n\r\nNext year he made his position stronger still {1735.}. As the Moravians\r\nin Georgia would require their own ministers, he now had David\r\nNitschmann consecrated a Bishop by Bishop Daniel Ernest Jablonsky (March\r\n13th). The new Bishop was not to exercise his functions in Germany. He\r\nwas a Bishop for the foreign field only; he sailed with the second batch\r\nof colonists for Georgia; and thus Zinzendorf maintained the Moravian\r\nEpiscopal Succession, not from any sectarian motives, but because he\r\nwished to help the Brethren when the storm burst over their heads.\r\n\r\nFor what really happened, however, Zinzendorf was unprepared {1736.}.\r\nAs he made these various arrangements for the Brethren, he entirely\r\noverlooked the fact that he himself was in greater danger than they.\r\nHe was far more widely hated than he imagined. He was condemned by the\r\nPietists because he had never experienced their sudden and spasmodic\r\nmethod of conversion. He offended his own relatives when he became a\r\nclergyman; he was accused of having disgraced his rank as a Count; he\r\ndisgusted a number of other noblemen at Dresden; and the result of this\r\nstrong feeling was that Augustus III., King of Saxony, issued an edict\r\nbanishing Zinzendorf from his kingdom. He was accused in this Royal\r\nedict of three great crimes. He had introduced religious novelties;\r\nhe had founded conventicles; and he had taught false doctrine. Thus\r\nZinzendorf was banished from Saxony as a heretic. As soon, however, as\r\nthe Government had dealt with Zinzendorf, they sent a second Commission\r\nto Herrnhut; and the second Commission came to the conclusion that the\r\nBrethren were most desirable Lutherans, and might be allowed to\r\nstay. Dr. Löscher, one of the commissioners, burst into tears. \"Your\r\ndoctrine,\" he said, \"is as pure as ours, but we do not possess your\r\ndiscipline.\" At first sight this certainly looks like a contradiction,\r\nbut the explanation is not far to seek. We find it in the report issued\r\nby the Commission. It was a shameless confession of mercenary motives.\r\nIn that report the commissioners deliberately stated that if good\r\nworkmen like the Brethren were banished from Herrnhut the Government\r\nwould lose so much in taxes; and, therefore, the Brethren were allowed\r\nto stay because they brought grist to the mill. At the same time, they\r\nwere forbidden to make any proselytes; and thus it was hoped that the\r\nHerrnhut heresy would die a natural death.\r\n\r\nWhen Zinzendorf heard of his banishment, he was not amazed. \"What\r\nmatter!\" he said. \"Even had I been allowed by law, I could not have\r\nremained in Herrnhut at all during the next ten years.\" He had plans\r\nfurther afield. \"We must now,\" he added, \"gather together the Pilgrim\r\nCongregation and proclaim the Saviour to the World.\" It is true that the\r\nedict of banishment was repealed {1737.}; it is true that he was allowed\r\nto return to Herrnhut; but a year later a new edict was issued, and the\r\nCount was sternly expelled from his native land {1738.}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. -- THE FOREIGN MISSIONS AND THEIR INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\nAs young Leonard Dober lay tossing on his couch, his soul was disquieted\r\nwithin him {1731.}. He had heard strange news that afternoon, and sleep\r\nforsook his eyes. As Count Zinzendorf was on a visit to the court of\r\nChristian VI., King of Denmark, he met a West Indian negro slave, by\r\nname Antony Ulrich. And Antony was an interesting man. He had been\r\nbaptized; he had been taught the rudiments of the Christian faith; he\r\nhad met two other Brethren at the court; his tongue was glib and\r\nhis imagination lively; and now he poured into Zinzendorf's ears a\r\nheartrending tale of the benighted condition of the slaves on the Danish\r\nisland of St. Thomas. He spoke pathetically of his sister Anna, of his\r\nbrother Abraham, and of their fervent desire to hear the Gospel.\r\n\r\n\"If only some missionaries would come,\" said he, \"they would certainly\r\nbe heartily welcomed. Many an evening have I sat on the shore and sighed\r\nmy soul toward Christian Europe; and I have a brother and sister in\r\nbondage who long to know the living God.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect on Zinzendorf was electric. His mind was full of missionary\r\nvisions. The story of Antony fired his zeal. The door to the heathen\r\nworld stood open. The golden day had dawned. He returned to the Brethren\r\nat Herrnhut, arrived at two o'clock in the morning, and found that the\r\nSingle Brethren were still on their knees in prayer. Nothing could be\r\nmore encouraging. At the first opportunity he told the Brethren Antony's\r\ntouching tale.\r\n\r\nAgain the effect was electric. As the Brethren met for their monthly\r\nservice on \"Congregation Day\" they had often listened to reports of\r\nwork in various parts of the Continent; already the Count had suggested\r\nforeign work; and already a band of Single Brethren (Feb. 11th, 1728)\r\nhad made a covenant with each other to respond to the first clear sound\r\nof the trumpet call. As soon as their daily work was over, these men\r\nplunged deep into the study of medicine, geography, and languages. They\r\nwished to be ready \"when the blessed time should come\"; they were on the\r\ntiptoe of expectation; and now they were looking forward to the day when\r\nthey should be summoned to cross the seas to heathen lands. The summons\r\nhad sounded at last. To Leonard Dober the crisis of his life had come.\r\nAs he tossed to and fro that summer night he could think about nothing\r\nbut the poor neglected negroes, and seemed to hear a voice Divine urging\r\nhim to arise and preach deliverance to the captives. Whence came, he\r\nasked, that still, small voice? Was it his own excited fancy, or was it\r\nthe voice of God? As the morning broke, he was still unsettled in his\r\nmind. But already the Count had taught the Brethren to regard the daily\r\nWatch-Word as a special message from God. He consulted his text-book.\r\nThe very answer he sought was there. \"It is not a vain thing for you,\"\r\nran the message, \"because it is your life; and through this thing ye\r\nshall prolong your days.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet Dober was not quite convinced. If God desired him to go abroad\r\nHe would give a still clearer call. He determined to consult his friend\r\nTobias Leupold, and abide the issue of the colloquy; and in the evening\r\nthe two young men took their usual stroll together among the brushwood\r\nclustering round the settlement. And then Leonard Dober laid bare his\r\nheart, and learned to his amazement that all the while Tobias had been\r\nin the same perplexing pass. What Dober had been longing to tell him,\r\nhe had been longing to tell Dober. Each had heard the same still small\r\nvoice; each had fought the same doubts; each had feared to speak his\r\nmind; and now, in the summer gloaming, they knelt down side by side\r\nand prayed to be guided aright. Forthwith the answer was ready. As they\r\njoined the other Single Brethren, and marched in solemn procession past\r\nZinzendorf's house, they heard the Count remark to a friend, \"Sir,\r\namong these young men there are missionaries to St. Thomas, Greenland,\r\nLapland, and many other countries.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were inspiring. Forthwith the young fellows wrote to the Count\r\nand offered to serve in St. Thomas. The Count read the letter to the\r\ncongregation, but kept their names a secret. The Brethren were critical\r\nand cold. As the settlers were mostly simple people, with little\r\nknowledge of the world beyond the seas, it was natural that they should\r\nshrink from a task which the powerful Protestant Churches of Europe had\r\nnot yet dared to attempt. Some held the offer reckless; some dubbed it\r\na youthful bid for fame and the pretty imagination of young officious\r\nminds. Antony Ulrich came to Herrnhut, addressed the congregation in\r\nDutch, and told them that no one could be a missionary in St. Thomas\r\nwithout first becoming a slave. As the people knew no better they\r\nbelieved him. For a year the issue hung in the scales of doubt. The\r\nyoung men were resolute, confident and undismayed. If they had to be\r\nslaves to preach the Gospel, then slaves they would willingly be![87] At\r\nlast Dober wrote in person to the congregation and repeated his resolve.\r\nThe Brethren yielded. The Count still doubted. For the second time a\r\nmomentous issue was submitted to the decision of the Lot.\r\n\r\n\"Are you willing,\" he asked Dober, \"to consult the Saviour by means of\r\nthe Lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself,\" replied Dober, \"I am already sure enough; but I will do so\r\nfor the sake of the Brethren.\"\r\n\r\nA meeting was held; a box of mottoes was brought in; and Dober drew a\r\nslip of paper bearing the words: \"Let the lad go, for the Lord is with\r\nhim.\" The voice of the Lot was decisive. Of all the meetings held\r\nin Herrnhut, this meeting to hear the voice of the Lot was the most\r\nmomentous in its world-wide importance. The young men were all on fire.\r\nIf the Lot had only given the word they would now have gone to the\r\nforeign field in dozens. For the first time in the history of Protestant\r\nEurope a congregation of orthodox Christians had deliberately resolved\r\nto undertake the task of preaching the Gospel to the heathen. As the\r\nLot which decided that Dober should go had also decided that his friend\r\nLeupold should stay, he now chose as his travelling companion the\r\ncarpenter, David Nitschmann. The birthday of Moravian Missions now drew\r\nnear. At three o'clock on the morning of August 21st, 1732, the two men\r\nstood waiting in front of Zinzendorf's house. The Count had spent the\r\nwhole night in prayer. He drove them in his carriage as far as Bautzen.\r\nThey alighted outside the little town, knelt down on the quiet roadside,\r\nengaged in prayer, received the Count's blessing by imposition of hands,\r\nbade him farewell, and set out Westward Ho!\r\n\r\nAs they trudged on foot on their way to Copenhagen, they had no idea\r\nthat in so doing they were clearing the way for the great modern\r\nmissionary movement; and, on the whole, they looked more like pedlars\r\nthan pioneers of a new campaign. They wore brown coats and quaint\r\nthree-cornered hats. They carried bundles on their backs. They had only\r\nabout thirty shillings in their pockets. They had received no clear\r\ninstructions from the Count, except \"to do all in the Spirit of Jesus\r\nChrist.\" They knew but little of the social condition of St. Thomas.\r\nThey had no example to follow; they had no \"Society\" to supply their\r\nneeds; and now they were going to a part of the world where, as yet, a\r\nmissionary's foot had never trod.\r\n\r\nAt Copenhagen, where they called at the court, they created quite a\r\nsensation. For some years there had existed there a National Missionary\r\nCollege. It was the first Reformed Missionary College in Europe. Founded\r\nby King Frederick IV., it was regarded as a regular department of the\r\nState. It had already sent Hans Egede to Greenland and Ziegenbalg\r\nto Tranquebar, on the Coromandel Coast; and it sent its men as State\r\nofficials, to undertake the work of evangelisation as a useful part\r\nof the national colonial policy. But Dober and Nitschmann were on a\r\ndifferent footing. If they had been the paid agents of the State they\r\nwould have been regarded with favour; but as they were only the heralds\r\nof a Church they were laughed at as a brace of fools. For a while they\r\nmet with violent opposition. Von Plesz, the King's Chamberlain, asked\r\nthem how they would live.\r\n\r\n\"We shall work,\" replied Nitschmann, \"as slaves among the slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Von Plesz, \"that is impossible. It will not be allowed. No\r\nwhite man ever works as a slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Nitschmann, \"I am a carpenter, and will ply my\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will the potter do?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will help me in my work.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go on like that,\" exclaimed the Chamberlain, \"you will stand\r\nyour ground the wide world over.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to stand their ground at Copenhagen. As the\r\ndirectors of the Danish West Indian Company refused to grant them a\r\npassage out they had now to wait for any vessel that might be sailing.\r\nThe whole Court was soon on their side. The Queen expressed her good\r\nwishes. The Princess Amalie gave them some money and a Dutch Bible.\r\nThe Chamberlain slipped some coins into Nitschmann's pocket. The Court\r\nPhysician gave them a spring lancet, and showed them how to open a vein.\r\nThe Court Chaplain espoused their cause, and the Royal Cupbearer found\r\nthem a ship on the point of sailing for St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nAs the ship cast anchor in St. Thomas Harbour the Brethren realized for\r\nthe first time the greatness of their task. There lay the quaint little\r\ntown of Tappus, its scarlet roofs agleam in the noontide sun; there,\r\nalong the silver beach, they saw the yellowing rocks; and there, beyond,\r\nthe soft green hills were limned against the azure sky. There, in a\r\nword, lay the favoured isle, the \"First Love of Moravian Missions.\"\r\nAgain the text for the day was prophetic: \"The Lord of Hosts,\" ran\r\nthe gladdening watchword, \"mustereth the host of the battle.\" As the\r\nBrethren stepped ashore next day they opened a new chapter in the\r\nhistory of modern Christianity. They were the founders of Christian work\r\namong the slaves. For fifty years the Moravian Brethren laboured in the\r\nWest Indies without any aid from any other religious denomination. They\r\nestablished churches in St. Thomas, in St. Croix, in St. John's, in\r\nJamaica, in Antigua, in Barbados, and in St. Kitts. They had 13,000\r\nbaptized converts before a missionary from any other Church arrived on\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nWe pass to another field. As the Count was on his visit to the Court in\r\nCopenhagen, he saw two little Greenland boys who had been baptized by\r\nthe Danish missionary, Hans Egede; and as the story of Antony Ulrich\r\nfired the zeal of Leonard Dober, so the story of Egede's patient labours\r\naroused the zeal of Matthew Stach and the redoubtable Christian David\r\n{1733.}. In Greenland Egede had failed. In Greenland the Brethren\r\nsucceeded. As they settled down among the people they resolved at first\r\nto be very systematic in their method of preaching the Gospel; and to\r\nthis end, like Egede before them, they expounded to the simple Eskimo\r\nfolk the whole scheme of dogmatic theology, from the fall of man to the\r\nglorification of the saint. The result was dismal failure. At last the\r\nBrethren struck the golden trail. The story is a classic in the history\r\nof missions. As John Beck, one balmy evening in June, was discoursing on\r\nthings Divine to a group of Eskimos, it suddenly flashed upon his mind\r\nthat, instead of preaching dogmatic theology he would read them an\r\nextract from the translation of the Gospels he was now preparing. He\r\nseized his manuscript. \"And being in an agony,\" read John Beck, \"He\r\nprayed more earnestly, and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood\r\nfalling down to the ground.\" At this Kajarnak, the brightest in the\r\ngroup, sprang forward to the table and exclaimed, \"How was that? Tell me\r\nthat again, for I, too, would be saved.\" The first Eskimo was touched.\r\nThe power was the story of the Cross. From that moment the Brethren\r\naltered the whole style of their preaching. Instead of expounding\r\ndogmatic theology, they told the vivid human story of the Via Dolorosa,\r\nthe Crown of Thorns, the Scourging, and the Wounded Side. The result was\r\nbrilliant success. The more the Brethren spoke of Christ the more eager\r\nthe Eskimos were to listen.\r\n\r\nIn this good work the leader was Matthew Stach. He was ordained a\r\nPresbyter of the Brethren's Church. He was officially appointed leader\r\nof the Greenland Mission. He was recognized by the Danish College\r\nof Missions. He was authorized by the King of Denmark to baptize and\r\nperform all sacerdotal functions. His work was methodical and thorough.\r\nIn order to teach the roving Eskimos the virtues of a settled life, he\r\nactually took a number of them on a Continental tour, brought them to\r\nLondon, presented them, at Leicester House, to King George II., the\r\nPrince of Wales, and the rest of the Royal Family, and thus imbued them\r\nwith a love of civilisation. At New Herrnhut, in Greenland, he founded\r\na settlement, as thoroughly organised as Herrnhut in Saxony. He built\r\na church, adorned with pictures depicting the sufferings of Christ. He\r\ntaught the people to play the violin. He divided the congregation into\r\n\"choirs.\" He showed them how to cultivate a garden of cabbages, leeks,\r\nlettuces, radishes and turnips. He taught them to care for all widows\r\nand orphans. He erected a \"Brethren's House\" for the \"Single Brethren\"\r\nand a \"Sisters' House\" for the \"Single Sisters.\" He taught them to join\r\nin worship every day. At six o'clock every morning there was a meeting\r\nfor the baptized; at eight a public service for all the settlers; at\r\nnine the children repeated their catechism and then proceeded to morning\r\nschool; and then, in the evening, when the men had returned with their\r\nbag of seals, there was a public preaching service in the church. And at\r\nLichtenfels and Lichtenau the same sort of work was done.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to other scenes, to Dutch Guinea or Surinam. As the Dutch\r\nwere still a great colonial power, they had plenty of opportunity to\r\nspread the Gospel; and yet, except in India, they had hitherto not\r\nlifted a finger in the cause of foreign missions. For the most part the\r\nDutch clergy took not the slightest interest in the subject. They held\r\nbigoted views about predestination. They thought that Christ had died\r\nfor them, but not for Indians and negroes. As the Brethren, however,\r\nwere good workmen, it was thought that they might prove useful in the\r\nColonies; and so Bishop Spangenberg found it easy to make an arrangement\r\nwith the Dutch Trading Company, whereby the Brethren were granted a\r\nfree passage, full liberty in religion, and exemption from the oath and\r\nmilitary service {1734.}. But all this was little more than pious talk.\r\nAs soon as the Brethren set to work the Dutch pastors opposed them to\r\nthe teeth. At home and abroad it was just the same. At Amsterdam\r\nthe clergy met in Synod, and prepared a cutting \"Pastoral Letter,\"\r\ncondemning the Brethren's theology; and at Paramaribo the Brethren were\r\nforbidden to hold any meetings at all. But the Brethren did not stay\r\nvery long in Paramaribo. Through three hundred miles of jungle and swamp\r\nthey pressed their way, and came to the homes of the Indian tribes; to\r\nthe Accawois, who earned their living as professional assassins; to the\r\nWarrows, who wallowed in the marshes; to the Arawaks, or \"Flour People,\"\r\nwho prepared tapioca; to the Caribs, who sought them that had familiar\r\nspirits and wizards that peep and mutter. \"It seems very dark,\" they\r\nwrote to the Count, \"but we will testify of the grace of the Saviour\r\ntill He lets the light shine in this dark waste.\" For twenty years they\r\nlaboured among these Indian tribes; and Salomo Schumann, the leader of\r\nthe band, prepared an Indian dictionary and grammar. One story flashes\r\nlight upon their labours. As Christopher Dähne, who had built himself\r\na hut in the forest, was retiring to rest a snake suddenly glided down\r\nupon him from the roof, bit him twice or thrice, and coiled itself round\r\nhis body. At that moment, the gallant herald of the Cross, with death\r\nstaring him in the face, thought, not of himself, but of the people whom\r\nhe had come to serve. If he died as he lay the rumour might spread that\r\nsome of the natives had killed him; and, therefore, he seized a piece\r\nof chalk and wrote on the table, \"A serpent has killed me.\" But lo! the\r\ntext flashed suddenly upon him: \"They shall take up serpents; and if\r\nthey drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them.\" He seized the\r\nserpent, flung it from him, lay down to sleep in perfect peace, and next\r\nmorning went about his labours.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to South Africa, the land of the Boers. For the last hundred\r\nyears South Africa had been under the rule of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany; and the result was that the Hottentots and Kaffirs were\r\nstill as heathen as ever. For their spiritual welfare the Boers cared\r\nabsolutely nothing. They were strong believers in predestination; they\r\nbelieved that they were elected to grace and the Hottentots elected to\r\ndamnation; and, therefore, they held it to be their duty to wipe the\r\nHottentots off the face of the earth. \"The Hottentots,\" they said, \"have\r\nno souls; they belong to the race of baboons.\" They called them children\r\nof the devil; they called them \"black wares,\" \"black beasts,\" and \"black\r\ncattle\"; and over one church door they painted the notice \"Dogs and\r\nHottentots not admitted.\" They ruined them, body and soul, with rum and\r\nbrandy; they first made them merry with drink, and then cajoled them\r\ninto unjust bargains; they shot them down in hundreds, and then boasted\r\nover their liquor how many Hottentots they had \"potted.\" \"With one\r\nhundred and fifty men,\" wrote the Governor, Van Ruibeck, in his journal,\r\n\"11,000 head of black cattle might be obtained without danger of losing\r\none man; and many savages might be taken without resistance to be\r\nsent as slaves to India, as they will always come to us unarmed. If no\r\nfurther trade is to be expected with them, what should it matter much to\r\ntake six or eight thousand beasts from them.\" But the most delightful\r\nof all Boer customs was the custom of flogging by pipes. If a Hottentot\r\nproved a trifle unruly, he was thrashed, while his master, looking on\r\nwith a gluttonous eye, smoked a fixed number of pipes; and the wreathing\r\nsmoke and the writhing Hottentot brought balm unto his soul.\r\n\r\nAnd now to this hell of hypocrisy and villainy came the first apostle to\r\nthe natives. As the famous Halle missionary, Ziegenbalg, was on his way\r\nto the Malabar Coast he touched at Cape Town, heard something of the\r\nabominations practised, was stirred to pity, and wrote laying the case\r\nbefore two pastors in Holland. The two pastors wrote to Herrnhut; the\r\nHerrnhut Brethren chose their man; and in less than a week the man was\r\non his way. George Schmidt was a typical Herrnhut brother. He had come\r\nfrom Kunewalde, in Moravia, had lain six years in prison, had seen his\r\nfriend, Melchior Nitschmann, die in his arms, and watched his own flesh\r\nfall away in flakes from his bones. For twelve months he had now to stay\r\nin Amsterdam, first to learn the Dutch language, and secondly to pass an\r\nexamination in orthodox theology. He passed the examination with flying\r\ncolours. He received permission from the \"Chamber of Seventeen\" to sail\r\nin one of the Dutch East India Company's ships. He landed at Cape Town.\r\nHis arrival created a sensation. As he sat in the public room of an inn\r\nhe listened to the conversation of the assembled farmers {1737.}.\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" said one, \"that a parson has come here to convert the\r\nHottentots.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! a parson!\" quoth another. \"Why, the poor fool must have lost his\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThey argued the case; they mocked; they laughed; they found the subject\r\nintensely amusing.\r\n\r\n\"And what, sir, do you think?\" said a waiter to Schmidt, who was sitting\r\nquietly in the corner.\r\n\r\n\"I am the very man,\" replied Schmidt; and the farmers began to talk\r\nabout their crops.\r\n\r\nFor six years George Schmidt laboured all alone among the benighted\r\nHottentots. He began his labours at a military outpost in the Sweet-Milk\r\nValley, about fifty miles east of Cape Town; but finding the company\r\nof soldiers dangerous to the morals of his congregation, he moved to a\r\nplace called Bavian's Kloof, where the town of Genadendal stands to-day.\r\nHe planted the pear-tree so famous in missionary annals, taught the\r\nHottentots the art of gardening, held public service every evening, had\r\nfifty pupils in his day-school, and began to baptize his converts. As he\r\nand William, one of his scholars, were returning one day from a visit to\r\nCape Town, they came upon a brook, and Schmidt asked William if he had a\r\nmind to be baptized there and then. He answered \"Yes.\" And there, by\r\nthe stream in a quiet spot, the first fruit of African Missions made his\r\nconfession of faith in Christ.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou believe,\" asked Schmidt solemnly, \"that the Son of God died\r\non the cross for the sins of all mankind? Dost thou believe that thou\r\nart by nature a lost and undone creature? Wilt thou renounce the devil\r\nand all his works? Art thou willing, in dependence on God's grace, to\r\nendure reproach and persecution, to confess Christ before all men, and\r\nto remain faithful to him unto death?\"\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as Schmidt began to baptize his converts the Cape Town\r\nclergy denounced him as a heretic, and summoned him to answer for his\r\nsins. The great charge against him was that he had not been properly\r\nordained. He had been ordained, not by actual imposition of hands, but\r\nby a certificate of ordination, sent out to him by Zinzendorf. To the\r\nDutch clergy this was no ordination at all. What right, said they, had\r\na man to baptize who had been ordained in this irregular manner? He\r\nreturned to Holland to fight his battle there. And he never set foot on\r\nAfrican soil again! The whole argument about the irregular ordination\r\nturned out to be a mere excuse. If that argument had been genuine the\r\nDutch clergy could now have had Schimdt ordained in the usual way. But\r\nthe truth is they had no faith in his mission; they had begun to regard\r\nthe Brethren as dangerous heretics; and, therefore, for another fifty\r\nyears they forbade all further mission work in the Dutch Colony of South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to other scenes. We go to the Gold Coast in the Dutch Colony\r\nof Guinea, where Huckoff, another German Moravian, and Protten, a\r\nmulatto theological scholar, attempted to found a school for slaves\r\n{1737.}, and where, again, the work was opposed by the Governor. We pass\r\nto another Dutch Colony in Ceylon; and there find David Nitschmann III.\r\nand Dr. Eller establishing a society in Colombo, and labouring further\r\ninland for the conversion of the Cingalese; and again we find that the\r\nDutch clergy, inflamed by the \"Pastoral Letter,\" were bitterly opposed\r\nto the Brethren and compelled them to return to Herrnhut. We take our\r\njourney to Constantinople, and find Arvid Gradin, the learned Swede,\r\nengaged in an attempt to come to terms with the Greek Church {1740.},\r\nand thus open the way for the Brethren's Gospel to Asia. We step north\r\nto Wallachia, and find two Brethren consulting about a settlement there\r\nwith the Haspodar of Bucharest. We arrive at St. Petersburg, and find\r\nthree Brethren there before us, commissioned to preach the Gospel to the\r\nheathen Calmucks. We pass on to Persia and find two doctors, Hocker and\r\nRüffer, stripped naked by robbers on the highway, and then starting a\r\npractice at Ispahan (1747). We cross the sandy plains to the city of\r\nBagdad, and find two Brethren in its narrow streets; we find Hocker\r\nexpounding the Gospel to the Copts in Cairo!\r\n\r\nAnd even this was not the end of the Brethren's missionary labours\r\n{1738-42.}. For some years the Brethren conducted a mission to the Jews.\r\nFor Jews the Count had special sympathy. He had vowed in his youth to\r\ndo all he could for their conversion; he had met a good many Jews at\r\nHerrnhut and at Frankfurt-on-the-Main; he made a practice of speaking\r\nabout them in public on the Great Day of Atonement; and in their Sunday\r\nmorning litany the Brethren uttered the prayer, \"Deliver Thy people\r\nIsrael from their blindness; bring many of them to know Thee, till the\r\nfulness of the Gentiles is come and all Israel is saved.\" The chief\r\nseat of this work was Amsterdam, and the chief workers Leonard Dober and\r\nSamuel Leiberkühn. The last man was a model missionary. He had studied\r\ntheology at Jena and Halle; he was a master of the Hebrew tongue; he\r\nwas expert in all customs of the Jews; he was offered a professorship\r\nat Königsberg; and yet, instead of winning his laurels as an Oriental\r\nscholar, he preferred to settle down in humble style in the Jewish\r\nquarter of Amsterdam, and there talk to his friends the Jews about the\r\nChrist he loved so deeply. His method of work was instructive. He never\r\ndazed his Jewish friends with dogmatic theology. He never tried to prove\r\nthat Christ was the Messiah of the prophecies. He simply told them, in\r\na kindly way, how Jesus had risen from the dead, and how much this\r\nrisen Jesus had done in the world; he shared their hope of a national\r\ngathering in Palestine; and, though he could never boast of making\r\nconverts, he was so beloved by his Jewish friends that they called him\r\n\"Rabbi Schmuel.\"\r\n\r\nLet us try to estimate the value of all this work. Of all the\r\nenterprises undertaken by the Brethren this heroic advance on heathen\r\nsoil had the greatest influence on other Protestant Churches; and some\r\nwriters have called the Moravians the pioneers of Protestant Foreign\r\nMissions. But this statement is only true in a special sense. They\r\nwere not the first to preach the Gospel to the heathen. If the reader\r\nconsults any history of Christian Missions[88] he will see that long\r\nbefore Leonard Dober set out for St. Thomas other men had preached the\r\nGospel in heathen lands.\r\n\r\nBut in all these efforts there is one feature missing. There is no sign\r\nof any united Church action. At the time when Leonard Dober set out from\r\nHerrnhut not a single other Protestant Church in the world had attacked\r\nthe task of foreign missions, or even regarded that task as a Divinely\r\nappointed duty. In England the work was undertaken, not by the Church as\r\nsuch, but by two voluntary associations, the S.P.C.K. and the S.P.G.; in\r\nGermany, not by the Lutheran Church, but by a few earnest Pietists; in\r\nDenmark, not by the Church, but by the State; in Holland, not by the\r\nChurch, but by one or two pious Colonial Governors; and in Scotland,\r\nneither by the Church nor by anyone else. At that time the whole work of\r\nforeign missions was regarded as the duty, not of the Churches, but of\r\n\"Kings, Princes, and States.\" In England, Anglicans, Independents and\r\nBaptists were all more or less indifferent. In Scotland the subject was\r\nnever mentioned; and even sixty years later a resolution to inquire into\r\nthe matter was rejected by the General Assembly {1796.}. In Germany the\r\nLutherans were either indifferent or hostile. In Denmark and Holland the\r\nwhole subject was treated with contempt. And the only Protestant Church\r\nto recognize the duty was this little, struggling Renewed Church of the\r\nBrethren. In this sense, therefore, and in this sense only, can we\r\ncall the Moravians the pioneers of modern missions. They were the first\r\nProtestant Church in Christendom to undertake the conversion of the\r\nheathen. They sent out their missionaries as authorised agents of the\r\nChurch. They prayed for the cause of missions in their Sunday Litany.\r\nThey had several missionary hymns in their Hymn-Book. They had regular\r\nmeetings to listen to the reading of missionaries' diaries and letters.\r\nThey discussed missionary problems at their Synods. They appointed\r\na Church Financial Committee to see to ways and means. They sent\r\nout officially appointed \"visitors\" to inspect the work in various\r\ncountries. They were, in a word, the first Protestant Missionary Church\r\nin history; and thus they set an inspiring example to all their stronger\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nAgain, this work of the Brethren was important because it was thorough\r\nand systematic. At first the missionaries were compelled to go out with\r\nvery vague ideas of their duties. But in 1734 the Brethren published\r\n\"Instructions for the Colony in Georgia\"; in 1737 \"Instructions for\r\nMissionaries to the East\"; in 1738 \"Instructions for all Missionaries\";\r\nand in 1740 \"The Right Way to Convert the Heathen.\" Thus even during\r\nthose early years the Moravian missionaries were trained in missionary\r\nwork. They were told what Gospel to preach and how to preach it. \"You\r\nare not,\" said Zinzendorf, in his \"Instructions,\" \"to allow yourselves\r\nto be blinded by the notion that the heathen must be taught first to\r\nbelieve in God, and then afterwards in Jesus Christ. It is false. They\r\nknow already that there is a God. You must preach to them about the Son.\r\nYou must be like Paul, who knew nothing but Jesus and Him crucified. You\r\nmust speak constantly, in season, and out of season, of Jesus, the Lamb,\r\nthe Saviour; and you must tell them that the way to salvation is belief\r\nin this Jesus, the Eternal Son of God.\" Instead of discussing doctrinal\r\nquestions the missionaries laid the whole stress on the person and\r\nsacrifice of Christ. They avoided dogmatic language. They used the\r\nlanguage, not of the theological world, but of the Gospels. They\r\npreached, not a theory of the Atonement, but the story of the Cross. \"We\r\nmust,\" said Spangenberg, \"hold to the fact that the blood and death of\r\nJesus are the diamond in the golden ring of the Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nBut alongside this Gospel message the Brethren introduced as far as\r\npossible the stern system of moral discipline which already existed\r\nat Herrnhut. They lived in daily personal touch with the people. They\r\ntaught them to be honest, obedient, industrious, and loyal to the\r\nGovernment. They opened schools, taught reading and writing, and\r\ninstructed the girls in sewing and needlework. They divided their\r\ncongregations, not only into \"Choirs,\" but also into \"Classes.\" They\r\nlaid the stress, not on public preaching, but on the individual \"cure of\r\nsouls.\" For this purpose they practised what was called \"The Speaking.\"\r\nAt certain fixed seasons, i.e., the missionary, or one of his helpers,\r\nhad a private interview with each member of the congregation. The old\r\nsystem of the Bohemian Brethren was here revived.[89] At these private\r\ninterviews there was no possibility of any moral danger. At the head of\r\nthe men was the missionary, at the head of the women his wife; for the\r\nmen there were male \"Helpers,\" for the women female \"Helpers\"; and thus\r\nall \"speakings\" took place between persons of the same sex only. There\r\nwere three degrees of discipline. For the first offence the punishment\r\nwas reproof; for the second, suspension from the Communion; for the\r\nthird, expulsion from the congregation. And thus the Brethren proved up\r\nto the hilt that Christian work among the heathen was not mere waste of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAgain, this work was important because it was public. It was not done in\r\na corner. It was acted on the open stage of history. As these Brethren\r\nlaboured among the heathen, they were constantly coming into close\r\ncontact with Governors, with trading companies, and with Boards of\r\nControl. In Greenland they were under Danish rule; in Surinam, under\r\nDutch; in North America, under English; in the West Indies, under\r\nEnglish, French, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese; and thus\r\nthey were teaching a moral lesson to the whole Western European world.\r\nAt that time the West Indian Islands were the gathering ground for all\r\nthe powers on the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. There, and there alone\r\nin the world, they all had possessions; and there, in the midst of all\r\nthese nationalities, the Brethren accomplished their most successful\r\nwork. And the striking fact is that in each of these islands they gained\r\nthe approval of the Governor. They were the agents of an international\r\nChurch; they were free from all political complications; they could\r\nnever be suspected of treachery; they were law-abiding citizens\r\nthemselves, and taught their converts to be the same; and thus they\r\nenjoyed the esteem and support of every great Power in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd this in turn had another grand result. It prepared the way for\r\nNegro Emancipation. We must not, however, give the missionaries too much\r\ncredit. As Zinzendorf himself was a firm believer in slavery, we\r\nneed not be surprised to find that the Brethren never came forward as\r\nchampions of liberty. They never pleaded for emancipation. They never\r\nencouraged their converts to expect it. They never talked about\r\nthe horrors of slavery. They never appealed, like Wilberforce, to\r\nParliament. And yet it was just these modest Brethren who did the\r\nmost to make emancipation possible. Instead of delivering inflamatory\r\nspeeches, and stirring up the hot-blooded negroes to rebellion, they\r\ntaught them rather to be industrious, orderly, and loyal, and thus show\r\nthat they were fit for liberty. If a slave disobeyed his master\r\nthey punished him. They acted wisely. If the Brethren had preached\r\nemancipation they would simply have made their converts restive; and\r\nthese converts, by rebelling, would only have cut their own throats.\r\nAgain and again, in Jamaica and Antigua, the negroes rose in revolt; and\r\nagain and again the Governors noticed that the Moravian converts took no\r\npart in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nAt last the news of these triumphs arrived in England; and the Privy\r\nCouncil appointed a Committee to inquire into the state of the slave\r\ntrade in our West Indian possessions {1787.}. The Committee appealed\r\nto the Brethren for information. The reply was drafted by Christian\r\nIgnatius La Trobe. As La Trobe was then the English Secretary for\r\nthe Brethren's missions, he was well qualified to give the required\r\ninformation. He described the Brethren's methods of work, pointed out\r\nits results in the conduct of the negroes, and declared that all the\r\nBrethren desired was liberty to preach the Gospel. \"The Brethren,\" he\r\nsaid, \"never wish to interfere between masters and slaves.\" The ball\r\nwas now set fairly rolling. Dr. Porteous, Bishop of London, replied on\r\nbehalf of the Committee. He was an ardent champion of emancipation. He\r\nthanked the Brethren for their information. He informed them how pleased\r\nthe Committee were with the Brethren's methods of work. At this very\r\ntime Wilberforce formed his resolution to devote his life to the\r\nemancipation of the slaves. He opened his campaign in Parliament two\r\nyears later. He was a personal friend of La Trobe; he read his report;\r\nand he backed up his arguments in Parliament by describing the good\r\nresults of Moravian work among the slaves. And thus the part played by\r\nthe Brethren was alike modest and effective. They taught the slaves to\r\nbe good; they taught them to be genuine lovers of law and order; they\r\nmade them fit for the great gift of liberty; and thus, by destroying\r\nthe stale old argument that emancipation was dangerous they removed the\r\ngreatest obstacle in Wilberforce's way.[90]\r\nAgain, this work of the Brethren was important in its influence on\r\nseveral great English missionary pioneers. At missionary gatherings held\r\nin England the statement is often made to-day that the first Englishman\r\nto go out as a foreign missionary was William Carey, the leader of the\r\nimmortal \"Serampore Three.\" It is time to explode that fiction. For some\r\nyears before William Carey was heard of a number of English Moravian\r\nBrethren had gone out from these shores as foreign missionaries. In\r\nAntigua laboured Samuel Isles, Joseph Newby, and Samuel Watson; in\r\nJamaica, George Caries and John Bowen; in St. Kitts and St. Croix, James\r\nBirkby; in Barbados, Benjamin Brookshaw; in Labrador, William Turner,\r\nJames Rhodes, and Lister; and in Tobago, John Montgomery, the father of\r\nJames Montgomery, the well-known Moravian hymn-writer and poet. With\r\nthe single exception of George Caries, who seems to have had some Irish\r\nblood in his veins, these early missionaries were as English as Carey\r\nhimself; and the greater number, as we can see from the names, were\r\nnatives of Yorkshire. Moreover, William Carey knew of their work. He\r\nowed his inspiration partly to them; he referred to their work in his\r\nfamous pamphlet, \"Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use\r\nMeans for the Conversion of the Heathens\"; and finally, at the house\r\nof Mrs. Beely Wallis, in Kettering, he threw down upon the table some\r\nnumbers of the first English missionary magazine,[91] \"Periodical Accounts\r\nrelating to the Missions of the Church of the United Brethren,\" and,\r\naddressing his fellow Baptist ministers, exclaimed: \"See what the\r\nMoravians have done! Can we not follow their example, and in obedience\r\nto our heavenly Master go out into the world and preach the Gospel to\r\nthe heathen.\" The result was the foundation of the Baptist Missionary\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Marshman, also confessed his obligations to the Brethren\r\n{1792.}.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you! Moravians,\" he said, \"you have done me good. If I am ever a\r\nmissionary worth a straw I shall, under our Saviour, owe it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWe have next the case of the London Missionary Society. Of that Society\r\none of the founders was Rowland Hill. He was well informed about the\r\nlabours of the Moravians; he corresponded with Peter Braun, the Moravian\r\nmissionary in Antigua; and to that correspondence he owed in part his\r\ninterest in missionary work. But that was not the end of the Brethren's\r\ninfluence. At all meetings addressed by the founders of the proposed\r\nSociety, the speaker repeatedly enforced his arguments by quotations\r\nfrom the Periodical Accounts; and finally, when the Society was\r\nestablished, the founders submitted to La Trobe, the editor, the\r\nfollowing series of questions:--\"1. How do you obtain your missionaries?\r\n2. What is the true calling of a missionary? 3. What qualifications do\r\nyou demand in a missionary? 4. Do you demand scientific and theological\r\nlearning? 5. Do you consider previous instruction in Divine things an\r\nessential? 6. How do you employ your missionaries from the time when\r\nthey are first called to the time when they set out? 7. Have you found\r\nby experience that the cleverest and best educated men make the best\r\nmissionaries? 8. What do you do when you establish a missionary station?\r\nDo you send men with their wives, or single people, or both? 9. What\r\nhave you found the most effective way of accomplishing the conversion of\r\nthe heathen? 10. Can you tell us the easiest way of learning a language?\r\n11. How much does your missionary ship[92] cost you?\" In reply, La Trobe\r\nanswered in detail, and gave a full description of the Brethren's\r\nmethods; and the first heralds of the London Missionary Society went out\r\nwith Moravian instructions in their pockets and Moravian experience to\r\nguide them on their way.\r\n\r\nWe have next the case of Robert Moffatt, the missionary to Bechuanaland.\r\nWhat was it that first aroused his missionary zeal? It was, he tells us,\r\nthe stories told him by his mother about the exploits of the Moravians!\r\n\r\nIn Germany the influence of the Brethren was equally great. At the\r\npresent time the greatest missionary forces in Germany are the Basel\r\nand Leipzig Societies; and the interesting point to notice is that if\r\nwe only go far enough back in the story we find that each of these\r\nsocieties owed its origin to Moravian influence.[93] From what did the\r\nBasel Missionary Society spring? (1819). It sprang from an earlier\r\n\"Society for Christian Fellowship (1780),\" and one object of that\r\nearlier society was the support of Moravian Missions. But the influence\r\ndid not end here. At the meeting when the Basel Missionary Society was\r\nformed, three Moravians--Burghardt, Götze, and Lörschke--were present,\r\nthe influence of the Brethren was specially mentioned, the work of\r\nthe Brethren was described, and the text for the day from the Moravian\r\ntextbook was read. In a similar way the Leipzig Missionary Society\r\nsprang from a series of meetings held in Dresden, and in those\r\nmeetings several Moravians took a prominent part. By whom was the first\r\nmissionary college in history established? It was established at Berlin\r\nby Jänicke {1800.}, and Jänicke had first been a teacher in the Moravian\r\nPædagogium at Niesky. By whom was the first Norwegian Missionary\r\nMagazine--the Norsk Missionsblad--edited? By the Moravian minister,\r\nHolm. From such facts as these we may draw one broad conclusion; and\r\nthat broad conclusion is that the Brethren's labours paved the way for\r\nsome of the greatest missionary institutions of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. -- THE PILGRIM BAND, 1736-1743.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Zinzendorf was banished from Saxony, he sought another sphere\r\nof work. About thirty miles northeast of Frankfurt-on-the-Main there lay\r\na quaint and charming district known as the Wetterau, wherein stood two\r\nold ruined castles, called Ronneburg and Marienborn. The owners of the\r\nestate, the Counts of Isenberg, had fallen on hard times. They were deep\r\nin debt; their estates were running to decay; the Ronneburg walls were\r\ncrumbling to pieces, and the out-houses, farms and stables were let out\r\nto fifty-six dirty families of Jews, tramps, vagabonds and a mongrel\r\nthrong of scoundrels of the lowest class. As soon as the Counts heard\r\nthat Zinzendorf had been banished from Saxony, they kindly offered him\r\ntheir estates on lease. They had two objects in view. As the Brethren\r\nwere pious, they would improve the people's morals; and as they were\r\ngood workers, they would raise the value of the land. The Count sent\r\nChristian David to reconnoitre. Christian David brought back an evil\r\nreport. It was a filthy place, he said, unfit for respectable people.\r\nBut Zinzendorf felt that, filthy or not, it was the very spot which God\r\nhad chosen for his new work. It suited his high ideas. The more squalid\r\nthe people, the more reason there was for going.\r\n\r\n\"I will make this nest of vagabonds,\" he said, \"the centre for the\r\nuniversal religion of the Saviour. Christian,\" he asked, \"haven't you\r\nbeen in Greenland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" replied Christian, who had been with the two Stachs, \"if it\r\nwere only as good as it was in Greenland! But at Ronneburg Castle we\r\nshall only die.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Count would not hear another word, went to see the place for\r\nhimself, closed with the terms of the Counts of Isenberg, and thus\r\ncommenced that romantic chapter in the Brethren's History called by some\r\nGerman historians the Wetterau Time.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of many adventures. As the Count took up his quarters in\r\nRonneburg Castle, he brought with him a body of Brethren and Sisters\r\nwhom he called the \"Pilgrim Band\"; and there, on June 17th, 1736, he\r\npreached his first sermon in the castle. It was now exactly fourteen\r\nyears since Christian David had felled the first tree at Herrnhut; and\r\nnow for another fourteen years these crumbling walls were to be the home\r\nof Moravian life. What the members of the Pilgrim Band were we may know\r\nfrom the very name. They were a travelling Church. They were a body of\r\nChristians called to the task, in Zinzendorf's own words, \"to proclaim\r\nthe Saviour to the world\"; and the Count's noble motto was: \"The earth\r\nis the Lord's; all souls are His; I am debtor to all.\" There was a dash\r\nof romance in that Pilgrim Band, and more than a dash of heroism. They\r\nlived in a wild and eerie district. They slept on straw. They heard the\r\nrats and mice hold revels on the worm-eaten staircases, and heard the\r\nnight wind howl and sough between the broken windows; and from those\r\nruined walls they went out to preach the tidings of the love of Christ\r\nin the wigwams of the Indians and the snow-made huts of the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nAs charity, however, begins at home, the Count and his Brethren began\r\ntheir new labours among the degraded rabble that lived in filth and\r\npoverty round the castle. They conducted free schools for the children.\r\nThey held meetings for men and women in the vaults of the castle. They\r\nvisited the miserable gipsies in their dirty homes. They invited the\r\ndirty little ragamuffins to tea, and the gipsies' children sat down at\r\ntable with the sons and daughters of the Count. They issued an order\r\nforbidding begging, and twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, they\r\ndistributed food and clothing to the poor. One picture will illustrate\r\nthis strange campaign. Among the motley medley that lived about the\r\ncastle was an old grey-haired Jew, named Rabbi Abraham. One bright June\r\nevening, Zinzendorf met him, stretched out his hand, and said: \"Grey\r\nhairs are a crown of glory. I can see from your head and the expression\r\nof your eyes that you have had much experience both of heart and life.\r\nIn the name of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, let us be friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was struck dumb with wonder. Such a greeting from a\r\nChristian he had never heard before. He had usually been saluted with\r\nthe words, \"Begone, Jew!\" \"His lips trembled; his voice failed; and big\r\ntears rolled down his wrinkled cheeks upon his flowing beard.\r\n\r\n\"Enough, father,\" said the Count; \"we understand each other.\" And from\r\nthat moment the two were friends. The Count went to see him in his dirty\r\nhome, and ate black bread at his table. One morning, before dawn, as the\r\ntwo walked out, the old patriarch opened his heart.\r\n\r\n\"My heart,\" said he, \"is longing for the dawn. I am sick, yet know not\r\nwhat is the matter with me. I am looking for something, yet know not\r\nwhat I seek. I am like one who is chased, yet I see no enemy, except the\r\none within me, my old evil heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count opened his lips, and preached the Gospel of Christ. He painted\r\nLove on the Cross. He described that Love coming down from holiness\r\nand heaven. He told the old Jew, in burning words, how Christ had met\r\ncorrupted mankind, that man might become like God. As the old man wept\r\nand wrung his hands, the two ascended a hill, whereon stood a lonely\r\nchurch. And the sun rose, and its rays fell on the golden cross on the\r\nchurch spire, and the cross glittered brightly in the light of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"See there, Abraham,\" said Zinzendorf, \"a sign from heaven for you.\r\nThe God of your fathers has placed the cross in your sight, and now the\r\nrising sun from on high has tinged it with heavenly splendour. Believe\r\non Him whose blood was shed by your fathers, that God's purpose of mercy\r\nmight be fulfilled, that you might be free from all sin, and find in Him\r\nall your salvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said the Jew, as a new light flashed on his soul. \"Blessed\r\nbe the Lord who has had mercy upon me.\"\r\n\r\nWe have now to notice, step by step, how Zinzendorf, despite his\r\ntheories, restored the Moravian Church to vigorous life. His first move\r\nwas dramatic. As he strolled one day on the shore of the Baltic Sea, he\r\nbethought him that the time had come to revive the Brethren's Episcopal\r\nOrders in Germany. He wished to give his Brethren a legal standing.\r\nIn Saxony he had been condemned as a heretic; in Prussia he would be\r\nrecognized as orthodox; and to this intent he wrote to the King of\r\nPrussia, Frederick William I., and asked to be examined in doctrine by\r\nqualified Divines of the State Church. The King responded gladly. He had\r\nbeen informed that the Count was a fool, and was, therefore, anxious to\r\nsee him; and now he sent him a messenger to say that he would be highly\r\npleased if Zinzendorf would come and dine with him at Wusterhausen.\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\" asked His Majesty of the messenger when that\r\nfunctionary returned.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied the messenger.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the King, \"he is no fool.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count arrived, and stayed three days. The first day the King was\r\ncold; the second he was friendly; the third he was enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n\"The devil himself,\" he said to his courtiers, \"could not have told\r\nme more lies than I have been told about this Count. He is neither\r\na heretic nor a disturber of the peace. His only sin is that he, a\r\nwell-to-do Count, has devoted himself to the spread of the Gospel. I\r\nwill not believe another word against him. I will do all I can to help\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time Frederick William I. was Zinzendorf's fast friend. He\r\nencouraged him to become a Bishop of the Brethren. The Count was still\r\nin doubt. For some months he was terribly puzzled by the question\r\nwhether he could become a Moravian Bishop, and yet at the same time\r\nbe loyal to the Lutheran Church; and, in order to come to a right\r\nconclusion, he actually came over to England and discussed the whole\r\nthorny subject of Moravian Episcopal Orders with John Potter, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury. The Archbishop soon relieved his mind. He informed the\r\nCount, first, that in his judgment the Moravian Episcopal Orders were\r\napostolic; and he informed him, secondly, that as the Brethren were\r\ntrue to the teaching of the Augsburg Confession in Germany and the\r\nThirty-nine Articles in England, the Count could honestly become a\r\nBishop without being guilty of founding a new sect. The Count returned\r\nto Germany. He was examined in the faith, by the King's command, by\r\ntwo Berlin Divines. He came through the ordeal with flying colours, and\r\nfinally, on May 20th, he was ordained a Bishop of the Brethren's Church\r\nby Bishop Daniel Ernest Jablonsky, Court Preacher at Berlin, and Bishop\r\nDavid Nitschmann {1737.}.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now remarkable. As soon as Zinzendorf became a Bishop,\r\nhe occupied, in theory, a double position. He was a \"Lutheran Bishop of\r\nthe Brethren's Church.\" On the one hand, like Jablonsky himself, he was\r\nstill a clergyman of the Lutheran Church; on the other, he was qualified\r\nto ordain ministers in the Church of the Brethren. And the Brethren, of\r\ncourse, laid stress on the latter point. They had now episcopal orders\r\nof their own; they realized their standing as an independent church;\r\nthey objected to mere toleration as a sect; they demanded recognition as\r\nan orthodox church. \"We design,\" they wrote to the Counts of Isenberg,\r\n\"to establish a home for thirty or forty families from Herrnhut. We\r\ndemand full liberty in all our meetings; we demand full liberty\r\nto practise our discipline and to have the sacraments, baptism and\r\ncommunion administered by our own ministers, ordained by our own\r\nBohemo-Moravian Bishops.\" As the Counts agreed to these conditions the\r\nBrethren now laid out near the castle a settlement after the Herrnhut\r\nmodel, named it Herrnhaag, and made it a regular training-ground for the\r\nfuture ministers of the Church. At Herrnhut the Brethren were under a\r\nLutheran Pastor; at Herrnhaag they were independent, and ordained their\r\nown men for the work. They erected a theological training college,\r\nwith Spangenberg as head. They had a pædagogium for boys, with Polycarp\r\nMüller as Rector. They had also a flourishing school for girls. For\r\nten years this new settlement at Herrnhaag was the busiest centre of\r\nevangelistic zeal in the world. At the theological college there were\r\nstudents from every university in Germany. At the schools there were\r\nover 600 children, and the Brethren had to issue a notice that they\r\nhad no room for more. The whole place was a smithy. There the spiritual\r\nweapons were forged for service in the foreign field. \"Up, up,\"\r\nSpangenberg would say to the young men at sunrise, \"we have no time for\r\ndawdling. Why sleep ye still? Arise, young lions!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the Count had a strange adventure, which spurred him to another\r\nstep forward. As there were certain sarcastic people in Germany who\r\nsaid that Zinzendorf, though willing enough to send out others to die\r\nof fever in foreign climes, was content to bask in comfort at home, he\r\ndetermined now to give the charge the lie. He had travelled already\r\non many a Gospel journey. He had preached to crowds in Berlin; he\r\nhad preached in the Cathedral at Reval, in Livonia, and had made\r\narrangements for the publication of an Esthonian Bible; and now he\r\nthought he must go to St. Thomas, where Friedrich Martin, the apostle\r\nto the negroes, had built up the strongest congregation in the Mission\r\nField. He consulted the Lot; the Lot said \"Yes,\" and off he set on his\r\njourney. The ship flew as though on eagle's wings. As they neared the\r\nisland, the Count turned to his companion, and said: \"What if we find no\r\none there? What if the missionaries are all dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we are there,\" replied Weber.\r\n\r\n\"Gens aeterna, these Moravians,\" exclaimed the Count.\r\n\r\nHe landed on the island {Jan. 29th, 1739.}.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the Brethren?\" said he to a negro.\r\n\r\n\"They are all in prison,\" was the startling answer.\r\n\r\n\"How long?\" asked the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Over three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the negroes doing in the meantime?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are making good progress, and a great revival is going on. The\r\nvery imprisonment of the teachers is a sermon.\"\r\n\r\nFor three months the Count was busy in St. Thomas. He burst into the\r\nGovernor's castle \"like thunder,\" and nearly frightened him out of his\r\nwits. He had brought with him a document signed by the King of Denmark,\r\nin which the Brethren were authorized to preach in the Danish West\r\nIndies. He had the prisoners released. He had the whole work in the\r\nDanish West Indies placed on a legal basis. He made the acquaintance\r\nof six hundred and seventy negroes. He was amazed and charmed by all he\r\nsaw. \"St. Thomas,\" he wrote, \"is a greater marvel than Herrnhut.\" For\r\nthe last three years that master missionary, Friedrich Martin, the\r\n\"Apostle to the Negroes,\" had been continuing the noble work begun by\r\nLeonard Dober; and, in spite of the fierce opposition of the planters\r\nand also of the Dutch Reformed Church, had established a number of\r\nnative congregations. He had opened a school for negro boys, and had\r\nthus taken the first step in the education of West Indian slaves. He had\r\ntaught his people to form societies for Bible study and prayer; and\r\nnow the Count put the finishing touch to the work. He introduced the\r\nHerrnhut system of discipline. He appointed one \"Peter\" chief Elder of\r\nthe Brethren, and \"Magdalene\" chief Elder of the Sisters. He gave some\r\nto be helpers, some to be advisers, and some to be distributors of alms;\r\nand he even introduced the system of incessant hourly prayer. And then,\r\nbefore he took his leave, he made a notable speech. He had no such\r\nconception as \"Negro emancipation.\" He regarded slavery as a Divinely\r\nappointed system. \"Do your work for your masters,\" he said, \"as though\r\nyou were working for yourselves. Remember that Christ has given every\r\nman his work. The Lord has made kings, masters, servants and slaves. It\r\nis the duty of each of us to be content with the station in which God\r\nhas placed him. God punished the first negroes by making them slaves.\"\r\n\r\nFor the work in St. Thomas this visit was important; for the work at\r\nhome it was still more so. As the Count returned from his visit in St.\r\nThomas, he saw more clearly than ever that if the Brethren were to do\r\ntheir work aright, they must justify their conduct and position in the\r\neyes of the law. His views had broadened; he had grander conceptions of\r\ntheir mission; he began the practice of summoning them to Synods, and\r\nthus laid the foundations of modern Moravian Church life.\r\n\r\nAt the first Synod, held at Ebersdorf (June, 1739), the Count expounded\r\nhis views at length {1739.}. He informed the Brethren, in a series of\r\nbrilliant and rather mystifying speeches, that there were now three\r\n\"religions\" in Germany--the Lutheran, the Reformed and the Moravian;\r\nbut that their duty and mission in the world was, not to restore the old\r\nChurch of the Brethren, but rather to gather the children of God into a\r\nmystical, visionary, ideal fellowship which he called the \"Community of\r\nJesus.\" For the present, he said, the home of this ideal \"Gemeine\" would\r\nbe the Moravian Church. At Herrnhut and other places in Saxony it would\r\nbe a home for Lutherans; at Herrnhaag it would be a home for Calvinists;\r\nand then, when it had done its work and united all the children of God,\r\nit could be conveniently exploded. He gave the Moravian Church a rather\r\nshort life. \"For the present,\" he said, \"the Saviour is manifesting His\r\nGemeine to the world in the outward form of the Moravian Church; but in\r\nfifty years that Church will be forgotten.\" It is doubtful how far his\r\nBrethren understood him. They listened, admired, wondered, gasped and\r\nquietly went their own way.\r\n\r\nAt the second Synod, held at the Moor Hotel in Gotha, the Count\r\nexplained his projects still more clearly {1740.}, and made the most\r\nastounding speech that had yet fallen from his lips. \"It is,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"the duty of our Bishops to defend the rights of the\r\nProtestant Moravian Church, and the duty of all the congregation to\r\nbe loyal to that Church. It is absolutely necessary, for the sake of\r\nChrist's work, that our Church be recognized as a true Church. She is a\r\ntrue Church of God; she is in the world to further the Saviour's cause;\r\nand people can belong to her just as much as to any other.\" If these\r\nwords meant anything at all, they meant, of course, that Zinzendorf,\r\nlike the Moravians themselves, insisted on the independent existence of\r\nthe Moravian Church; and, to prove that he really did mean this, he had\r\nPolycarp Müller consecrated a Bishop. And yet, at the same time, the\r\nCount insisted that the Brethren were not to value their Church for her\r\nown sake. They were not to try to extend the Church as such; they were\r\nnot to proselytize from other Churches; they were to regard her rather\r\nas a house of call for the \"scattered\" in all the churches;[94] and, above\r\nall, they must ever remember that as soon as they had done their work\r\ntheir Church would cease to exist. If this puzzles the reader he must\r\nnot be distressed. It was equally puzzling to some of Zinzendorf's\r\nfollowers. Bishop Polycarp Müller confessed that he could never\r\nunderstand it. At bottom, however, the Count's idea was clear. He\r\nstill had a healthy horror of sects and splits; he still regarded the\r\nBrethren's Church as a \"Church within the Church\"; he still insisted,\r\nwith perfect truth, that as they had no distinctive doctrine they could\r\nnot be condemned as a nonconforming sect; and the goal for which he was\r\nstraining was that wheresoever the Brethren went they should endeavour\r\nnot to extend their own borders, but rather to serve as a bond of union\r\nevangelical Christians of all denominations.\r\n\r\nNext year, at a Synod at Marienborn, the Count explained how this\r\nwonderful work was to be done {1740.}. What was the bond of union to be?\r\nIt was certainly not a doctrine. Instead of making the bond of union a\r\ndoctrine, as so many Churches have done, the Brethren made it personal\r\nexperience. Where creeds had failed experience would succeed. If men,\r\nthey said, were to be united in one grand evangelical Church, it would\r\nbe, not by a common creed, but by a common threefold experience--a\r\ncommon experience of their own misery and sin; a common experience of\r\nthe redeeming grace of Christ; and a common experience of the religious\r\nvalue of the Bible. To them this personal experience was the one\r\nessential. They had no rigid doctrine to impose. They did not regard any\r\nof the standard creeds as final. They did not demand subscription to a\r\ncreed as a test. They had no rigid doctrine of the Atonement or of the\r\nDivinity of Christ; they had no special process of conversion; and, most\r\nstriking of all, they had no rigid doctrine of the inspiration of the\r\nBible. They did not believe either in verbal inspiration or in Biblical\r\ninfallibility. They declared that the famous words, \"all Scripture is\r\ngiven by inspiration of God,\" must be taken in a free and broad way.\r\nThey held that, though the Bible was inspired, it contained mistakes in\r\ndetail; that the teaching of St. James was in flat contradiction to the\r\nteaching of St. Paul; and that even the Apostles sometimes made a wrong\r\napplication of the prophecies. To them the value of the Bible consisted,\r\nnot in its supposed infallibility, but in its appeal to their hearts.\r\n\"The Bible,\" they declared, \"is a never-failing spring for the heart;\r\nand the one thing that authenticates the truth of its message is the\r\nfact that what is said in the book is confirmed by the experience of the\r\nheart.\" How modern this sounds.\r\n\r\nBut how was this universal experience to be attained? The Count had\r\nhis answer ready. He had studied the philosophical works of Spinoza and\r\nBayle. He was familiar with the trend of the rationalistic movement. He\r\nwas aware that to thousands, both inside and outside the Church, the\r\nGod whom Jesus called \"Our Father\" was no more than a cold philosophical\r\nabstraction; and that many pastors in the Lutheran Church, instead\r\nof trying to make God a reality, were wasting their time in spinning\r\nabstruse speculations, and discussing how many legions of angels could\r\nstand on the point of a needle. As this sort of philosophy rather\r\ndisgusted Zinzendorf, he determined to frame a theology of his own; and\r\nthereby he arrived at the conclusion that the only way to teach men to\r\nlove God was \"to preach the Creator of the World under no other shape\r\nthan that of a wounded and dying Lamb.\" He held that the Suffering\r\nChrist on the Cross was the one perfect expression and revelation of the\r\nlove of God; he held that the title \"Lamb of God\" was the favourite name\r\nfor Christ in the New Testament; he held that the central doctrine of\r\nthe faith was the \"Ransom\" paid by Christ in His sufferings and death;\r\nand, therefore, he began to preach himself, and taught his Brethren to\r\npreach as well, the famous \"Blood and Wounds Theology.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, at a Synod held in London, the Brethren cleared the decks\r\nfor action, and took their stand on the stage of history as a free,\r\nindependent Church of Christ {1741.}. The situation was alarming. Of all\r\nthe Protestant Churches in Europe, the Church of the Brethren was the\r\nbroadest in doctrine and the most independent in action; and yet, during\r\nthe last few years, the Brethren were actually in danger of bending the\r\nknee to a Pope. The Pope in question was Leonard Dober. At the time\r\nwhen Herrnhut was founded, the Brethren had elected a governing board of\r\ntwelve Elders. Of these twelve Elders, four Over-Elders were set apart\r\nfor spiritual purposes; and of these four Over-Elders, one was specially\r\nchosen as Chief Elder. The first Chief Elder was Augustin Neisser, and\r\nthe second Martin Linner. As long as the office lay in Linner's hands,\r\nthere was no danger of the Chief Elder becoming a Pope. He was poor; he\r\nwas humble; he was weak in health; and he spent his time in praying for\r\nthe Church and attending to the spiritual needs of the Single Brethren.\r\nBut gradually the situation altered. For the last six years the office\r\nhad been held by Leonard Dober. He had been elected by Lot, and was,\r\ntherefore, supposed to possess Divine authority. He was General Elder\r\nof the whole Brethren's Church. He had become the supreme authority in\r\nspiritual matters. He had authority over Zinzendorf himself, over all\r\nthe Bishops, over all the members of the Pilgrim Band, over all Moravian\r\nBrethren at Herrnhut, over the pioneers in England and North America,\r\nover the missionaries in Greenland, the West Indies, South Africa and\r\nSurinam. He had become a spiritual referee. As the work extended, his\r\nduties and powers increased. He was Elder, not merely of the Brethren's\r\nChurch, but of that ideal \"Community of Jesus\" which ever swam before\r\nthe vision of the Count. He was becoming a court of appeal in cases\r\nof dispute. Already disagreements were rising among the Brethren. At\r\nHerrnhut dwelt the old-fashioned, sober, strict Moravians. At Herrnhaag\r\nthe Brethren, with their freer notions, were already showing dangerous\r\nsigns of fanaticism. At Pilgerruh, in Holstein, another body were being\r\ntempted to break from the Count altogether. And above these disagreeing\r\nparties the General Elder sat supreme. His position had become\r\nimpossible. He was supposed to be above all party disputes; he was the\r\nfriend of all, the intercessor for all, the broad-minded ideal Brother;\r\nand yet, if an actual dispute arose, he would be expected to give a\r\nbinding decision. For these manifold duties Dober felt unfit; he had no\r\ndesire to become a Protestant Pope; and, therefore, being a modest man,\r\nhe wrote to the Conference at Marienborn, and asked for leave to lay\r\ndown his office. The question was submitted to the Lot. The Lot allowed\r\nDober to resign. The situation was now more dangerous than ever. The\r\nBrethren were in a quandary. They could never do without a General\r\nElder. If they did they would cease to be a true \"Community of Jesus,\"\r\nand degenerate into a mere party-sect. At last, at a house in Red Lion\r\nStreet, London, they met to thrash out the question. For the third time\r\na critical question was submitted to the decision of the Lot {Sept.\r\n16th, 1741.}. \"As we began to think about the Eldership,\" says\r\nZinzendorf himself, in telling the story, \"it occurred to us to accept\r\nthe Saviour as Elder. At the beginning of our deliberations we opened\r\nthe Textbook. On the one page stood the words, 'Let us open the door to\r\nChrist'; on the other, 'Thus saith the Lord, etc.; your Master, etc.;\r\nshow me to my children and to the work of my hands. Away to Jesus! Away!\r\netc.' Forthwith and with one consent we resolved to have no other than\r\nHim as our General Elder. He sanctioned it.[95] It was just Congregation\r\nDay. We looked at the Watchword for the day. It ran: 'The glory of the\r\nLord filled the house. We bow before the Lamb's face, etc.' We asked\r\npermission.[96] We obtained it. We sang with unequalled emotion: 'Come,\r\nthen, for we belong to Thee, and bless us inexpressibly.'\" As the story\r\njust quoted was written by the poetic Count, it has been supposed that\r\nin recording this famous event he added a spiritual flavour of his own.\r\nBut in this case he was telling the literal truth. At that Conference\r\nthe Brethren deliberately resolved to ask Christ to undertake the office\r\nwhich had hitherto been held by Leonard Dober; and, to put the matter\r\nbeyond all doubt, they inscribed on their minutes the resolution: \"That\r\nthe office of General Elder be abolished, and be transferred to the\r\nSaviour.\"[97] At first sight that resolution savours both of blasphemy and\r\nof pride; and Ritschl, the great theologian, declares that the Brethren\r\nput themselves on a pedestal above all other Churches. For that judgment\r\nMoravian writers have largely been to blame. It has been asserted\r\nagain and again that on that famous \"Memorial Day\" the Brethren made a\r\n\"special covenant\" with Christ. For that legend Bishop Spangenberg was\r\npartly responsible. As that godly writer, some thirty years later,\r\nwas writing the story of these transactions, he allowed his pious\r\nimagination to cast a halo over the facts; and, therefore, he penned\r\nthe misleading sentence that the chief concern of the Brethren was that\r\nChrist \"would condescend to enter into a special covenant with His\r\npoor Brethren's people, and take us as his peculiar property.\" For that\r\nstatement there is not a shadow of evidence. The whole story of the\r\n\"special covenant\" is a myth. In consulting the Lot the Brethren showed\r\ntheir faith; in passing their resolution they showed their wisdom; and\r\nthe meaning of the resolution was that henceforth the Brethren rejected\r\nall human authority in spiritual matters, recognized Christ alone as the\r\nHead of the Church, and thereby became the first free Church in Europe.\r\nInstead of bowing to any human authority they proceeded now to manage\r\ntheir own affairs; they elected by Lot a Conference of Twelve, and\r\nthus laid the foundations of that democratic system of government which\r\nexists at the present day. They were thrilled with the joy of their\r\nexperience; they felt that now, at length, they were free indeed;\r\nthey resolved that the joyful news should be published in all the\r\ncongregations on the same day (November 13th); and henceforward that day\r\nwas held in honour as the day when the Brethren gained their freedom and\r\nbowed to the will and law of Christ alone.\r\n\r\nAnd now there was only one more step to take. As soon as the Synod in\r\nLondon was over, Count Zinzendorf set off for America in pursuit of a\r\nscheme to be mentioned in its proper place; and as soon as he was safely\r\nout of the way, the Brethren at home set about the task of obtaining\r\nrecognition by the State. They had an easy task before them. For the\r\nlast ninety-four years--ever since the Peace of Westphalia (1648)--the\r\nruling principle in German had been that each little king and each\r\nlittle prince should settle what the religion should be in his own\r\nparticular dominions. If the King was a Lutheran, his people must be\r\nLutheran; if the King was Catholic, his people must be Catholic. But now\r\nthis principle was suddenly thrown overboard. The new King of Prussia,\r\nFrederick the Great, was a scoffer. For religion Frederick the Great\r\ncared nothing; for the material welfare of his people he cared a good\r\ndeal. He had recently conquered Silesia; he desired to see his land\r\nwell tilled, and his people happy and good; and, therefore, he readily\r\ngranted the Brethren a \"Concession,\" allowing them to settle in Prussia\r\nand Silesia {Dec. 25th, 1742.}. His attitude was that of the practical\r\nbusiness man. As long as the Brethren obeyed the law, and fostered\r\ntrade, they could worship as they pleased. For all he cared, they might\r\nhave prayed to Beelzebub. He granted them perfect liberty of conscience;\r\nhe allowed them to ordain their own ministers; he informed them that\r\nthey would not be subject to the Lutheran consistory; and thus, though\r\nnot in so many words, he practically recognized the Brethren as a free\r\nand independent Church. For the future history of the Brethren's Church,\r\nthis \"Concession\" was of vast importance. In one sense it aided their\r\nprogress; in another it was a fatal barrier. As the Brethren came to\r\nbe known as good workmen, other magnates speedily followed the king's\r\nexample; for particular places particular \"concessions\" were prepared;\r\nand thus the Brethren were encouraged to extend their \"settlement\r\nsystem.\" Instead, therefore, of advancing from town to town, the\r\nBrethren concentrated their attention on the cultivation of settlement\r\nlife; and before many years had passed away they had founded settlements\r\nat Niesky, Gnadenberg, Gnadenfrei, and Neusalz-on-the-Oder.\r\n\r\nThus, then, had the Brethren sketched the plan of all their future work.\r\nThey had regained their episcopal orders. They had defined their mission\r\nin the world. They had chosen their Gospel message. They had asserted\r\ntheir freedom of thought. They had won the goodwill of the State. They\r\nhad adopted the \"settlement system.\" They had begun their Diaspora work\r\nfor the scattered, and their mission work for the heathen; and thus\r\nthey had revived the old Church of the Brethren, and laid down those\r\nfundamental principles which have been maintained down to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile their patriotic instincts had been confirmed. As Christian\r\nDavid had brought Brethren from Moravia, so Jan Gilek brought Brethren\r\nfrom Bohemia; and the story of his romantic adventures aroused fresh\r\nzeal for the ancient Church. He had fled from Bohemia to Saxony, and had\r\noften returned, like Christian David, to fetch bands of Brethren. He had\r\nbeen captured in a hay-loft by Jesuits. He had been imprisoned for two\r\nyears at Leitomischl. He had been kept in a dungeon swarming with frogs,\r\nmice and other vermin. He had been fed with hot bread that he\r\nmight suffer from colic. He had been employed as street sweeper in\r\nLeitomischl, with his left hand chained to his right foot. At length,\r\nhowever, he made his escape (1735), fled to Gerlachseim, in Silesia,\r\nand finally, along with other Bohemian exiles, helped to form a new\r\ncongregation at Rixdorf, near Berlin. As the Brethren listened to\r\nGilek's story their zeal for the Church of their fathers was greater\r\nthan ever; and now the critical question was, what would Zinzendorf say\r\nto all this when he returned from America?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. -- THE SIFTING TIME, 1743-1750.\r\n\r\nAs the Count advanced towards middle age, he grew more domineering in\r\ntone, more noble in his dreams, and more foolish in much of his conduct.\r\nHe was soon to shine in each of these three lights. He returned from\r\nAmerica in a fury. For two years he had been busy in Pennsylvania in\r\na brave, but not very successful, attempt to establish a grand\r\n\"Congregation of God in the Spirit\"; and now he heard, to his deep\r\ndisgust, that his Brethren in Europe had lowered the ideal of the\r\nChurch, and made vulgar business bargains with worldly powers. What\r\nright, he asked, had the Brethren to make terms with an Atheist King?\r\nWhat right had they to obtain these degrading \"concessions?\" The whole\r\nbusiness, he argued, smacked of simony. If the Brethren made terms\r\nwith kings at all, they should take their stand, not, forsooth, as good\r\nworkmen who would help to fatten the soil, but rather as loyal adherents\r\nof the Augsburg Confession. At Herrnhaag they had turned the Church into\r\na business concern! Instead of paying rent to the Counts of Isenburg,\r\nthey now had the Counts in their power. They had lent them large sums of\r\nmoney; they held their estates as security; and now, in return for these\r\nfinancial favours, the Counts had kindly recognized the Brethren as \"the\r\northodox Episcopal Moravian Church.\" The more Zinzendorf heard of these\r\nbusiness transactions, the more disgusted he was. He stormed and rated\r\nlike an absolute monarch, and an absolute monarch he soon became. He\r\nforgot that before he went away he had entrusted the management of\r\nhome affairs to a Board of Twelve. He now promptly dissolved the Board,\r\nsummoned the Brethren to a Synod at Hirschberg, lectured them angrily\r\nfor their sins, reduced them to a state of meek submission, and was ere\r\nlong officially appointed to the office of \"Advocate and Steward of\r\nall the Brethren's Churches.\" He had now the reins of government in his\r\nhands {1743.}. \"Without your foreknowledge,\" ran this document, \"nothing\r\nnew respecting the foundation shall come up in our congregations, nor\r\nany conclusion of importance to the whole shall be valid; and no further\r\nstory shall be built upon your fundamental plan of the Protestant\r\ndoctrine of the Augsburg Confession, and that truthing(sp.)it in love\r\nwith all Christians, without consulting you.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeded now to use these kingly powers. He accused the Brethren of\r\ntwo fundamental errors. Instead of trying to gather Christians into one\r\nideal \"Community of Jesus,\" they had aimed at the recognition of the\r\nindependent Moravian Church; and instead of following the guidance of\r\nGod, they had followed the dictates of vulgar worldly wisdom. He would\r\ncure them of each of these complaints. He would cure them of their\r\nnarrow sectarian views, and cure them of their reliance on worldly\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nFor the first complaint he offered the remedy known as his \"Tropus\r\nIdea.\" The whole policy of Zinzendorf lies in those two words. He\r\nexpounded it fully at a Synod in Marienborn. The more he studied Church\r\nhistory in general, the more convinced he became that over and above all\r\nthe Christian Churches there was one ideal universal Christian Church;\r\nthat that ideal Church represented the original religion of Christ; and\r\nthat now the true mission of the Brethren was to make that ideal Church\r\na reality on God's fair earth. He did not regard any of the Churches of\r\nChrist as Churches in this higher sense of the term. He regarded them\r\nrather as religious training grounds. He called them, not Churches,\r\nbut tropuses. He called the Lutheran Church a tropus; he called the\r\nCalvinistic Church a tropus; he called the Moravian Church a tropus; he\r\ncalled the Pilgrim Band a tropus; he called the Memnonites a tropus; and\r\nby this word \"tropus\" he meant a religious school in which Christians\r\nwere trained for membership in the one true Church of Christ. He would\r\nnot have one of these tropuses destroyed. He regarded them all as\r\nessential. He honoured them all as means to a higher end. He would never\r\ntry to draw a man from his tropus. And now he set a grand task before\r\nthe Brethren. As the Brethren had no distinctive creed, and taught the\r\noriginal religion of Christ, they must now, he said, regard it as their\r\nDivine mission to find room within their broad bosom for men from all\r\nthe tropuses. They were not merely to restore the Moravian Church; they\r\nwere to establish a broader, comprehensive Church, to be known as the\r\n\"Church of the Brethren\"; and that Church would be composed of men from\r\nevery tropus under heaven. Some would be Lutherans, some Reformed, some\r\nAnglicans, some Moravians, some Memnonites, some Pilgrims in the foreign\r\nfield. For this purpose, and for this purpose only, he now revived the\r\nold Brethren's ministerial orders of Presbyter, Deacon and Acoluth; and\r\nwhen these men entered on their duties he informed them that they\r\nwere the servants, not merely of the Moravian Church, but of the wider\r\n\"Church of the Brethren.\" If the Count could now have carried out his\r\nscheme, he would have had men from various Churches at the head of each\r\ntropus in the Church of the Brethren. For the present he did the best he\r\ncould, and divided the Brethren into three leading tropuses. At the head\r\nof the Moravian tropus was Bishop Polycarp Müller; at the head of the\r\nLutheran, first he himself, and then, later, Dr. Hermann, Court Preacher\r\nat Dresden; and finally, at the head of the Reformed, first his old\r\nfriend Bishop Friedrich de Watteville, and then, later, Thomas Wilson,\r\nBishop of Sodor and Man.[98] His scheme was now fairly clear. \"In future,\"\r\nhe said, \"we are all to be Brethren, and our Bishops must be Brethren's\r\nBishops; and, therefore, in this Church of the Brethren there will\r\nhenceforth be, not only Moravians, but also Lutherans and Calvinists,\r\nwho cannot find peace in their own Churches on account of brutal\r\ntheologians.\"\r\n\r\nHis second remedy was worse than the disease. The great fault in\r\nZinzendorf's character was lack of ballast. For the last few years\r\nhe had given way to the habit of despising his own common sense; and\r\ninstead of using his own judgment he now used the Lot. He had probably\r\nlearned this habit from the Halle Pietists. He carried his Lot apparatus\r\nin his pocket;[99] he consulted it on all sorts of topics; he regarded\r\nit as the infallible voice of God. \"To me,\" said he, in a letter to\r\nSpangenberg, \"the Lot and the Will of God are simply one and the same\r\nthing. I am not wise enough to seek God's will by my own mental efforts.\r\nI would rather trust an innocent piece of paper than my own feelings.\"\r\nHe now endeavoured to teach this faith to his Brethren. He founded a\r\nsociety called \"The Order of the Little Fools,\" {June 2nd, 1743.} and\r\nbefore very long they were nearly all \"little fools.\" His argument\r\nhere was astounding. He appealed to the well-known words of Christ\r\nHimself.[100] As God, he contended, had revealed His will, not to wise\r\nmen, but to babes, it followed that the more like babes the Brethren\r\nbecame, the more clearly they would understand the mysteries of grace.\r\nThey were not to use their own brains; they were to wish that they had\r\nno brains; they were to be like children in arms; and thus they would\r\novercome all their doubts and banish all their cares. The result was\r\ndisastrous. It led to the period known as the \"Sifting Time.\" It is the\r\nsaddest period in the history of the Brethren's Church. For seven years\r\nthese Brethren took leave of their senses, and allowed their feelings\r\nto lead them on in the paths of insensate folly. They began by taking\r\nZinzendorf at his word. They used diminutives for nearly everything.\r\nThey addressed the Count as \"Papa\" and \"Little Papa\"; they spoke of\r\nChrist as \"Brother Lambkin\";[101] and they described themselves as\r\nlittle wound-parsons, cross-wood little splinters, a blessed troop of\r\ncross-air[102] birds, cross-air little atoms, cross-air little sponges,\r\nand cross-air little pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe chief sinner was the Count himself. Having thrown his common\r\nsense overboard, he gave free rein to his fancy, and came out with an\r\nexposition of the Holy Trinity which offended the rules of good taste.\r\nHe compared the Holy Trinity to a family. The father, said he, was God;\r\nthe mother was the Holy Ghost; their son was Jesus; and the Church of\r\nChrist, the Son's fair bride, was born in the Saviour's Side-wound,\r\nwas betrothed to Christ on the Cross, was married to Christ in the Holy\r\nCommunion, and was thus the daughter-in-law of the Father and the Holy\r\nGhost. We can all see the dangers of this. As soon as human images\r\nof spiritual truths are pressed beyond decent limits, they lead to\r\nfrivolity and folly; and that was just the effect at Herrnhaag. The more\r\nfreely the Brethren used these phrases, the more childish they became.\r\nThey called the Communion the \"Embracing of the Man\"; and thus they lost\r\ntheir reverence for things Divine.\r\n\r\nBut the next move of the Count was even worse. For its origin we must go\r\nback a few years in his story. As the Count one day was burning a pile\r\nof papers he saw one slip flutter down to the ground untouched by the\r\nfire {1734.}. He picked it up, looked at it, and found that it contained\r\nthe words:--\r\n\r\n   \"Oh, let us in Thy nail-prints see\r\n   Our pardon and election free.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the effect on Zinzendorf was healthy enough. He regarded the\r\nwords as a direct message from God. He began to think more of the value\r\nof the death of Christ. He altered the style of his preaching; he became\r\nmore definitely evangelical; and henceforth he taught the doctrine that\r\nall happiness and all virtue must centre in the atoning death of Christ.\r\n\"Since the year 1734,\" he said, \"the atoning sacrifice of Jesus became\r\nour only testimony and our one means of salvation.\" But now he carried\r\nthis doctrine to excess. Again the cause was his use of the Lot. As long\r\nas Zinzendorf used his own mental powers, he was able to make his \"Blood\r\nand Wounds Theology\" a power for good; but as soon as he bade good-bye\r\nto his intellect he made his doctrine a laughing-stock and a scandal.\r\nInstead of concentrating his attention on the moral and spiritual value\r\nof the cross, he now began to lay all the stress on the mere physical\r\ndetails. He composed a \"Litany of the Wounds\"; and the Brethren could\r\nnow talk and sing of nothing else {1743.}. \"We stick,\" they said, \"to\r\nthe Blood and Wounds Theology. We will preach nothing but Jesus the\r\nCrucified. We will look for nothing else in the Bible but the Lamb and\r\nHis Wounds, and again Wounds, and Blood and Blood.\" Above all they began\r\nto worship the Side-wound. \"We stick,\" they declared, \"to the Lambkin\r\nand His little Side-wound. It is useless to call this folly. We dote\r\nupon it. We are in love with it. We shall stay for ever in the little\r\nside-hole, where we are so unspeakably blessed.\"\r\n\r\nStill worse, these men now forgot the main moral principle of the\r\nChristian religion. Instead of living for others they lived for\r\nthemselves. Instead of working hard for their living they were now\r\nenjoying themselves at the Count's expense; instead of plain living\r\nand high thinking they had high living and low thinking; and instead\r\nof spending their money on the poor they spent it now on grand\r\nilluminations, transparent pictures, and gorgeous musical festivals.\r\nNo longer was their religion a discipline. It was a luxury, an orgy,\r\na pastime. At Herrnhut the ruling principle was law; at Herrnhaag the\r\nruling principle was liberty. At Herrnhut their religion was legal;\r\nat Herrnhaag it was supposed to be evangelical. The walls of their\r\nmeeting-house were daubed with flaming pictures. In the centre of the\r\nceiling was a picture of the Ascension; in one corner, Mary Magdalene\r\nmeeting Jesus on the Resurrection morning; in another, our Lord\r\nmaking himself known to the two disciples at Emmaus; in a third Thomas\r\nthrusting his hand in the Saviour's side; in a fourth, Peter leaping\r\nfrom a boat to greet the Risen Master on the shores of the Lake of\r\nTiberias. The four walls were equally gorgeous. At one end of the hall\r\nwas a picture of the Jew's Passover, some Hebrews sprinkling blood on\r\nthe door-posts, and the destroying angel passing. At the opposite end\r\nwas a picture of the Last Supper; on another wall Moses lifting up the\r\nbrazen serpent; on the fourth the Crucifixion. We can easily see the\r\npurpose of these pictures. They were all meant to teach the same great\r\nlesson. They were appeals through the eye to the heart. They were\r\nsermons in paint. If the Brethren had halted here they had done well.\r\nBut again they rode their horse to death. For them pictures and hymns\r\nwere not enough. At Marienborn Castle they now held a series of birthday\r\nfestivals in honour of Zinzendorf, Anna Nitschmann and other Moravian\r\nworthies; and these festivals must have cost thousands of pounds. At\r\nsuch times the old castle gleamed with a thousand lights. At night,\r\nsays a visitor, the building seemed on fire. The walls were hung with\r\nfestoons. The hall was ornamented with boughs. The pillars were decked\r\nwith lights, spirally disposed, and the seats were covered with fine\r\nlinen, set off with sightly ribbons.\r\n\r\nBut the worst feature of this riotous life is still to be mentioned.\r\nIf there is any topic requiring delicate treatment, it is surely the\r\nquestion of sexual morality; and now the Count made the great mistake\r\nof throwing aside the cloak of modesty and speaking out on sins of\r\nthe flesh in the plainest possible language. He delivered a series of\r\ndiscourses on moral purity; and in those discourses he used expressions\r\nwhich would hardly be permitted now except in a medical treatise. His\r\npurpose was certainly good. He contended that he had the Bible on his\r\nside; that the morals of the age were bad; and that the time for\r\nplain speaking had come. \"At that time,\" he said, \"when the Brethren's\r\ncongregations appeared afresh on the horizon of the Church, he found,\r\non the one hand, the lust of concupiscence carried to the utmost pitch\r\npossible, and the youth almost totally ruined; and on the other hand\r\nsome few thoughtful persons who proposed a spirituality like the\r\nangels.\" But again the Brethren rode their horse to death. They were\r\nnot immoral, they were only silly. They talked too freely about these\r\ndelicate topics; they sang about them in their hymns; they had these\r\nhymns published in a volume known as the \"Twelfth Appendix\" to their\r\nHymn-book; and thus they innocently gave the public the impression that\r\nthey revelled, for its own sake, in coarse and filthy language.\r\n\r\nWhat judgment are we to pass on all these follies? For the Brethren\r\nwe may fairly enter the plea that most of them were humble and\r\nsimple-minded men; that, on the whole, they meant well; and that, in\r\ntheir zeal for the Gospel of Christ, they allowed their feelings to\r\ncarry them away. And further, let us bear in mind that, despite their\r\nfoolish style of speech, they were still heroes of the Cross. They\r\nhad still a burning love for Christ; they were still willing to serve\r\nabroad; and they still went out to foreign lands, and laid down their\r\nlives for the sake of Him who had laid down His for them. As John\r\nCennick was on his visit to Herrnhaag (1746), he was amazed by the\r\nsplendid spirit of devotion shown. He found himself at the hub of the\r\nmissionary world. He saw portraits of missionaries on every hand. He\r\nheard a hymn sung in twenty-two different languages. He heard sermons in\r\nGerman, Esthonian, French, Spanish, Swedish, Lettish, Bohemian, Dutch,\r\nHebrew, Danish, and Eskimo. He heard letters read from missionaries in\r\nevery quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready,\" said Zinzendorf to John Soerensen, \"to serve the\r\nSaviour in Greenland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here am I, send me,\" said Soerensen. He had never thought of such a\r\nthing before.\r\n\r\n\"But the matter is pressing; we want someone to go at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Soerensen, \"that's no difficulty. If you will only get\r\nme a new pair of boots I will set off this very day. My old ones are\r\nquite worn out, and I have not another pair to call my own.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next day the man was off, and served in Greenland forty-six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut the grandest case is that of Bishop Cammerhof. He was a fanatic\r\nof the fanatics. He revelled in sickly sentimental language. He called\r\nhimself a \"Little Fool\" and a \"Little Cross-air Bird.\" He addressed the\r\nCount as his \"heart's Papa,\" and Anna Nitschmann as his \"Motherkin.\"\r\nHe said he would kiss them a thousand times, and vowed he could never\r\nfondle them enough! And yet this man had the soul of a hero, and killed\r\nhimself by overwork among the North American Indians![103] It is easy to\r\nsneer at saints like this as fools; but if fools they were, they were\r\nfools for their Master's sake.\r\n\r\nBut for Zinzendorf it is hard to find any excuse. He had received a\r\nsplendid education, had moved in refined and cultured circles, and had\r\nenjoyed the friendship of learned bishops, of eloquent preachers, of\r\nuniversity professors, of philosophers, of men of letters. He had read\r\nthe history of the Christian Church, knew the dangers of excess, and had\r\nspoken against excess in his earlier years.[104] He knew that the Wetterau\r\nswarmed with mad fanatics; had read the works of Dippel, of Rock, and of\r\nother unhealthy writers; and had, therefore, every reason to be on his\r\nguard. He knew the weak points in his own character. \"I have,\" he said,\r\n\"a genius for extravagance.\" He had deliberately, of his own free will,\r\naccepted the office of \"Advocate and Steward\" of the Brethren's Church.\r\nHe was the head of an ancient episcopal Church, with a high reputation\r\nto sustain. He had set the Brethren a high and holy task. He was a\r\npublic and well-known character. As he travelled about from country to\r\ncountry he spread the fame of the Brethren's labours in every great city\r\nin Germany, in England, in Switzerland, in North America, and in the\r\nWest Indies; and by this time he was known personally to the King\r\nof Denmark, to Potter, Archbishop of Canterbury, to John and Charles\r\nWesley, to Bengel, the famous commentator, and to many other leaders in\r\nthe Lutheran Church. And, therefore, by all the laws of honour, he was\r\nbound to lead the Brethren upward and keep their record clean. But his\r\nconduct now was unworthy of a trusted leader. It is the darkest blot on\r\nhis saintly character, and the chief reason why his brilliant schemes\r\nmet with so little favour. At the very time when he placed before the\r\nBrethren the noblest and loftiest ideals, he himself had done the most\r\nto cause the enemy to blaspheme. No wonder his Tropus idea was laughed\r\nto scorn. What sort of home was this, said his critics, that he had\r\nprepared for all the Tropuses? What grand ideal \"Church of the Brethren\"\r\nwas this, with its childish nonsense, its blasphemous language, its\r\nobjectionable hymns? As the rumours of the Brethren's excesses spread,\r\nall sorts of wild tales were told about them. Some said they were\r\nworshippers of the devil; some said they were conspirators against the\r\nState; some accused them falsely of immorality, of gluttony, of robbing\r\nthe poor; and the chief cause of all the trouble was this beautiful\r\npoet, this original thinker, this eloquent preacher, this noble\r\ndescendant of a noble line, this learned Bishop of the Brethren's\r\nChurch. There is only one explanation of his conduct. He had committed\r\nmental suicide, and he paid the penalty.[105]\r\nHe had now to retrieve his fallen honour, and to make amends for his\r\nguilt. At last he awoke to the stern facts of the case. His position now\r\nwas terrible. What right had he to lecture the Brethren for sins which\r\nhe himself had taught them to commit? He shrank from the dreadful task.\r\nBut the voice of duty was not to be silenced. He had not altogether\r\nneglected the Brethren's cause. At the very time when the excesses were\r\nat their height he had been endeavouring to obtain for the Brethren full\r\nlegal recognition in Germany, England, and North America. He won his\r\nfirst victory in Germany. He was allowed (Oct., 1747) to return to\r\nSaxony, summoned the Brethren to a Synod at Gross-Krausche in Silesia\r\n(1748), and persuaded them to promise fidelity to the Augsburg\r\nConfession. He had the Brethren's doctrine and practice examined by a\r\nSaxon Royal Commission, and the King of Saxony issued a decree (1749) by\r\nwhich the Brethren were granted religious liberty in his kingdom. Thus\r\nthe Brethren were now fully recognized by law in Prussia, Silesia, and\r\nSaxony. He had obtained these legal privileges just in time, and could\r\nnow deal with the poor fanatics at Herrnhaag. The situation there\r\nhad come to a crisis. The old Count of Isenberg died. His successor,\r\nGustavus Friedrich, was a weak-minded man; the agent, Brauer, detested\r\nthe Brethren; and now Brauer laid down the condition that the settlers\r\nat Herrnhaag must either break off their connection with Zinzendorf or\r\nelse abandon the premises. They chose the latter course. At one blow the\r\ngorgeous settlement was shivered to atoms. It had cost many thousands\r\nof pounds to build, and now the money was gone for ever. As the Brethren\r\nscattered in all directions, the Count saw at last the damage he had\r\ndone {Feb., 1750.}. He had led them on in reckless expense, and now he\r\nmust rush to their rescue. He addressed them all in a solemn circular\r\nletter. He visited the various congregations, and urged them to true\r\nrepentance. He suppressed the disgraceful \"Twelfth Appendix,\" and cut\r\nout the offensive passages in his own discourses. He issued treatise\r\nafter treatise defending the Brethren against the coarse libels of their\r\nenemies. And, best of all, and noblest of all, he not only took upon his\r\nown shoulders the burden of their financial troubles, but confessed like\r\na man that he himself had steered them on to the rocks. He summoned his\r\nBrethren to a Synod. He rose to address the assembly. His eyes were red,\r\nhis cheeks stained with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my beloved Brethren,\" he said, \"I am guilty! I am the cause of all\r\nthese troubles!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus at length this \"Sifting-Time\" came to a happy end. The whole\r\nepisode was like an attack of pneumonia. The attack was sudden; the\r\ncrisis dangerous; the recovery swift; and the lesson wholesome. For some\r\nyears after this the Brethren continued to show some signs of weakness;\r\nand even in the next edition of their Hymn-book they still made use of\r\nsome rather crude expressions. But on the whole they had learned some\r\nuseful lessons. On this subject the historians have mostly been in the\r\nwrong. Some have suppressed the facts. This is dishonest. Others have\r\nexaggerated, and spoken as if the excesses lasted for two or three\r\ngenerations. This is wicked.[106] The sober truth is exactly as described\r\nin these pages. The best judgment was passed by the godly Bishop\r\nSpangenherg. \"At that time,\" he said, \"the spirit of Christ did not rule\r\nin our hearts; and that was the real cause of all our foolery.\" Full\r\nwell the Brethren realized their mistake, and honestly they took its\r\nlessons to heart. They learned to place more trust in the Bible, and\r\nless in their own unbridled feelings. They learned afresh the value of\r\ndiscipline, and of an organised system of government. They became more\r\nguarded in their language, more Scriptural in their doctrine, and more\r\npractical in their preaching. Nor was this all. Meanwhile the same\r\nbattle had been fought and won in England and North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. -- MORAVIANS AND METHODISTS, 1735-1742.\r\n\r\nFor the origin of the Moravian Church in England we turn our eyes to\r\na bookseller's shop in London. It was known as \"The Bible and Sun\"; it\r\nstood a few yards west of Temple Bar; and James Hutton, the man behind\r\nthe counter, became in time the first English member of the Brethren's\r\nChurch. But James Hutton was a man of high importance for the whole\r\ncourse of English history. He was the connecting link between Moravians\r\nand Methodists; and thus he played a vital part, entirely ignored by our\r\ngreat historians, in the whole Evangelical Revival.\r\n\r\nHe was born on September 14th, 1715. He was the son of a High-Church\r\nclergyman. His father was a non-juror. He had refused, that is, to take\r\nthe oath of loyalty to the Hanoverian succession, had been compelled\r\nto resign his living, and now kept a boarding-house in College Street,\r\nWestminster, for boys attending the famous Westminster School. At that\r\nschool little James himself was educated; and one of his teachers was\r\nSamuel Wesley, the elder brother of John and Charles. He had no idea to\r\nwhat this would lead. As the lad grew up in his father's home he had, of\r\ncourse, not the least suspicion that such a body as the Moravian Church\r\nexisted. He had never heard of Zinzendorf or of Herrnhut. He was brought\r\nup a son of the Church of England; he loved her services and doctrine;\r\nand all that he desired to see was a revival within her borders of true\r\nspiritual life.\r\n\r\nThe revival was close at hand. For some years a number of pious\r\npeople--some clergy, and others laymen--had been endeavouring to rouse\r\nthe Church to new and vigorous life; and to this end they established\r\na number of \"Religious Societies.\" There were thirty or forty of these\r\nSocieties in London. They consisted of members of the Church of\r\nEngland. They met, once a week, in private houses to pray, to read\r\nthe Scriptures, and to edify each other. They drew up rules for their\r\nspiritual guidance, had special days for fasting and prayer, and\r\nattended early Communion once a month. At church they kept a sharp\r\nlook-out for others \"religiously disposed,\" and invited such to join\r\ntheir Societies. In the morning they would go to their own parish\r\nchurch; in the afternoon they would go where they could hear a\r\n\"spiritual sermon.\" Of these Societies one met at the house of Hutton's\r\nfather. If James, however, is to be believed, the Societies had now lost\r\na good deal of their moral power. He was not content with the one in his\r\nown home. He was not pleased with the members of it. They were, he\r\ntells us, slumbering or dead souls; they cared for nothing but their own\r\ncomfort in this world; and all they did when they met on Sunday evenings\r\nwas to enjoy themselves at small expense, and fancy themselves more holy\r\nthan other people. He was soon to meet with men of greater zeal.\r\n\r\nAs James was now apprenticed to a bookseller he thought he could do a\r\ngood stroke of business by visiting some of his old school-mates at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford. He went to Oxford to see them; they introduced him\r\nto John and Charles Wesley; and thus he formed an acquaintance that was\r\nsoon to change the current of his life. What had happened at Oxford is\r\nfamous in English history. For the last six years both John and Charles\r\nhad been conducting a noble work. They met, with others, on Sunday\r\nevenings, to read the classics and the Greek Testament; they attended\r\nCommunion at St. Mary's every Sunday. They visited the poor and the\r\nprisoners in the gaol. They fasted at regular intervals. For all this\r\nthey were openly laughed to scorn, and were considered mad fanatics.\r\nThey were called the Reforming Club, the Holy Club, the Godly Club,\r\nthe Sacramentarians, the Bible Moths, the Supererogation Men, the\r\nEnthusiasts, and, finally, the Methodists.\r\n\r\nBut Hutton was stirred to the very depths of his soul. He was still\r\nliving in College Street with his father; next door lived Samuel Wesley,\r\nhis old schoolmaster; and Hutton, therefore, asked John and Charles to\r\ncall and see him when next they came up to town. The invitation led to\r\ngreat results. At this time John Wesley received a request from\r\nGeneral Oglethorpe, Governor of Georgia, to go out to that colony as\r\na missionary. He accepted the offer with joy; his brother Charles was\r\nappointed the Governor's Secretary; and the two young men came up\r\nto London and spent a couple of days at Hutton's house. The plot was\r\nthickening. Young James was more in love with the Wesleys than ever.\r\nIf he had not been a bound apprentice he would have sailed with them to\r\nGeorgia himself {1735.}. He went down with them to Gravesend; he spent\r\nsome time with them on board the ship; and there, on that sailing\r\nvessel, the Simmonds, he saw, for the first time in his life, a number\r\nof Moravian Brethren. They, too, were on their way to Georgia. For the\r\nfuture history of religion in England that meeting on the Simmonds was\r\nmomentous. Among the passengers were General Oglethorpe, Bishop David\r\nNitschmann, and twenty-three other Brethren, and thus Moravians and\r\nMethodists were brought together by their common interest in missionary\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nJames Hutton was thrilled. As soon as his apprenticeship was over he set\r\nup in business for himself at the \"Bible and Sun,\" founded a new\r\nSociety in his own back parlour, and made that parlour the centre of the\r\nEvangelical Revival {1736.}. There he conducted weekly meetings; there\r\nhe established a Poor-box Society, the members paying in a penny a week;\r\nthere met the men who before long were to turn England upside down; and\r\nthere he and others were to hear still more of the life and work of the\r\nBrethren.\r\n\r\nFor this he had to thank his friend John Wesley. As John Wesley set out\r\non his voyage to Georgia he began to keep that delightful Journal which\r\nhas now become an English classic; and before having his Journal printed\r\nhe sent private copies to Hutton, and Hutton read them out at his\r\nweekly meetings. John Wesley had a stirring tale to tell. He admired the\r\nBrethren from the first. They were, he wrote, the gentlest, bravest folk\r\nhe had ever met. They helped without pay in the working of the ship;\r\nthey could take a blow without losing their tempers; and when the ship\r\nwas tossed in the storm they were braver than the sailors themselves.\r\nOne Sunday the gale was terrific. The sea poured in between the decks.\r\nThe main sail was torn to tatters. The English passengers screamed with\r\nterror. The Brethren calmly sang a hymn.\r\n\r\n\"Was not you afraid?\" said Wesley.\r\n\r\n\"I thank God, no,\" replied the Brother.\r\n\r\n\"But were not your women and children afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; our women and children are not afraid to die.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley was deeply stirred. For all his piety he still lacked\r\nsomething which these Brethren possessed. He lacked their triumphant\r\nconfidence in God. He was still afraid to die. \"How is it thou hast no\r\nfaith?\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nFor the present his question remained unanswered; but before he had been\r\nvery long in Georgia he laid his spiritual troubles before the learned\r\nMoravian teacher, Spangenberg. He could hardly have gone to a better\r\nspiritual guide. Of all the Brethren this modest Spangenberg was in many\r\nways the best. He was the son of a Lutheran minister. He was Wesley's\r\nequal in learning and practical piety. He had been assistant lecturer in\r\ntheology at Halle University. He was a man of deep spiritual experience;\r\nhe was only one year younger than Wesley himself; and, therefore, he\r\nwas thoroughly qualified to help the young English pilgrim over the\r\nstile.[107]\r\n\"My brother,\" he said, \"I must first ask you one or two questions. Have\r\nyou the witness within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness\r\nwith your spirit that you are a child of God?\"\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley was so staggered that he could not answer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know Jesus Christ?\" continued Spangenberg.\r\n\r\n\"I know he is the Saviour of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but do you know he has saved you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" replied Wesley, \"he has died to save me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Wesley; but he only half meant what he said.\r\n\r\nAgain, three weeks later, Wesley was present at a Moravian ordination\r\nservice. For the moment he forgot the seventeen centuries that had\r\nrolled by since the great days of the apostles; and almost thought that\r\nPaul the tentmaker or Peter the fisherman was presiding at the ceremony.\r\n\"God,\" he said, \"has opened me a door into a whole Church.\"\r\n\r\nAs James Hutton read these glowing reports to his little Society at\r\nthe \"Bible and Sun\" he began to take a still deeper interest in the\r\nBrethren. He had made the acquaintance, not only of the Wesleys, but of\r\nBenjamin Ingham, of William Delamotte, and of George Whitefield. He was\r\nthe first to welcome Whitefield to London. He found him openings in\r\nthe churches. He supplied him with money for the poor. He published his\r\nsermons. He founded another Society in Aldersgate Street. He was now to\r\nmeet with Zinzendorf himself. Once more the connecting link was foreign\r\nmissionary work. For some years the Count had been making attempts to\r\nobtain the goodwill of English Churchmen for the Brethren's labours in\r\nNorth America. He had first sent three Brethren--Wenzel Neisser, John\r\nToeltschig, and David Nitschmann, the Syndic--to open up negotiations\r\nwith the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; and very\r\ndisappointed he was when these negotiations came to nothing. He had then\r\nsent Spangenberg to London to make arrangements for the first batch of\r\ncolonists for Georgia. He had then sent the second batch under Bishop\r\nDavid Nitschmann. And now he came to London himself, took rooms at\r\nLindsey House {1737.}, Chelsea, and stayed about six weeks. He had two\r\npurposes to serve. He wished first to talk with Archbishop Potter about\r\nMoravian Episcopal Orders. He was just thinking of becoming a Bishop\r\nhimself. He wanted Potter's opinion on the subject. What position, he\r\nasked, would a Moravian Bishop occupy in an English colony? Would it be\r\nright for a Moravian Bishop to exercise his functions in Georgia? At the\r\nsame time, however, he wished to consult with the Board of Trustees\r\nfor Georgia. He had several talks with the Secretary. The Secretary was\r\nCharles Wesley. Charles Wesley was lodging now at old John Hutton's in\r\nCollege Street. He attended a service in Zinzendorf's rooms; he thought\r\nhimself in a choir of angels; he introduced James Hutton to the Count;\r\nand thus another link in the chain was forged.\r\n\r\nAnd now there arrived in England a man who was destined to give a\r\nnew tone to the rising revival {Jan. 27th, 1738.}. His name was Peter\r\nBoehler; he had just been ordained by Zinzendorf; he was on his way to\r\nSouth Carolina; and he happened to arrive in London five days before\r\nJohn Wesley landed from his visit to America. We have come to a critical\r\npoint in English history. At the house of Weinantz, a Dutch merchant,\r\nJohn Wesley and Peter Boehler met (Feb. 7th); John Wesley then found\r\nBoehler lodgings, and introduced him to Hutton; and ten days later\r\nWesley and Boehler set out together for Oxford {Feb. 17th.}. The\r\nimmortal discourse began.\r\n\r\nAs John Wesley returned to England from his three years' stay in\r\nAmerica, he found himself in a sorrowful state of mind. He had gone\r\nwith all the ardour of youth; he returned a spiritual bankrupt. On this\r\nsubject the historians have differed. According to High-Church Anglican\r\nwriters, John Wesley was a Christian saint before he ever set eyes on\r\nBoehler's face;[108] according to Methodists he had only a legal religion\r\nand was lacking in genuine, saving faith in Christ. His own evidence on\r\nthe questions seems conflicting. At the time he was sure he was not yet\r\nconverted; in later years he inclined to think he was. At the time he\r\nsadly wrote in his Journal, \"I who went to America to convert others\r\nwas never myself converted to God\"; and then, years later, he added the\r\nfootnote, \"I am not sure of this.\" It is easy, however, to explain\r\nthis contradiction. The question turns on the meaning of the word\r\n\"converted.\" If a man is truly converted to God when his heart throbs\r\nwith love for his fellows, with a zeal for souls, and with a desire to\r\ndo God's holy will, then John Wesley, when he returned from America,\r\nwas just as truly a \"converted\" man as ever he was in later life. He was\r\ndevout in prayer; he loved the Scriptures; he longed to be holy; he was\r\npure in thought, in deed, and in speech; he was self-denying; he had\r\nfed his soul on the noble teaching of Law's \"Serious Call\"; and thus, in\r\nmany ways, he was a beautiful model of what a Christian should be. And\r\nyet, after all, he lacked one thing which Peter Boehler possessed. If\r\nJohn Wesley was converted then he did not know it himself. He had no\r\nfirm, unflinching trust in God. He was not sure that his sins were\r\nforgiven. He lacked what Methodists call \"assurance,\" and what St. Paul\r\ncalled \"peace with God.\" He had the faith, to use his own distinction,\r\nnot of a son, but only of a servant. He was good but he was not happy;\r\nhe feared God, but he did not dare to love Him; he had not yet attained\r\nthe conviction that he himself had been redeemed by Christ; and if this\r\nconviction is essential to conversion, then John Wesley, before he met\r\nBoehler, was not yet a converted man. For practical purposes the matter\r\nwas of first importance. As long as Wesley was racked by doubts he could\r\nnever be a persuasive preacher of the Gospel. He was so distracted about\r\nhimself that he could not yet, with an easy mind, rush out to the rescue\r\nof others. He had not \"a heart at leisure from itself to soothe and\r\nsympathize.\" The influence of Boehler was enormous. He saw where\r\nWesley's trouble lay, and led him into the calm waters of rest.\r\n\r\n\"My brother, my brother,\" he said, \"that philosophy of yours must be\r\npurged away.\"[109]\r\nJohn Wesley did not understand. For three weeks the two men discussed\r\nthe fateful question; and the more Wesley examined himself the more sure\r\nhe was he did not possess \"the faith whereby we are saved.\" One day he\r\nfelt certain of his salvation; the next the doubts besieged his door\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"If what stands in the Bible is true,\" he said, \"then I am saved\"; but\r\nthat was as far as he could go.\r\n\r\n\"He knew,\" said Boehler in a letter to Zinzendorf, \"that he did not\r\nproperly believe in the Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Boehler made a fine practical suggestion {March 5th.}. He urged\r\nWesley to preach the Gospel to others. John Wesley was thunderstruck. He\r\nthought it rather his duty to leave off preaching. What right had he to\r\npreach to others a faith he did not yet possess himself? Should he leave\r\noff preaching or not?\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied Boehler.\r\n\r\n\"But what can I preach?\" asked Wesley.\r\n\r\n\"Preach faith till you have it,\" was the classic answer, \"and then,\r\nbecause you have it, you will preach faith.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he consulted Boehler on the point; and again Boehler, broad-minded\r\nman, gave the same wholesome advice.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he insisted, \"do not hide in the earth the talent God has given\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe advice was sound. If John Wesley had left off preaching now, he\r\nmight never have preached again; and if Boehler had been a narrow-minded\r\nbigot, he would certainly have informed his pupil that unless he\r\npossessed full assurance of faith he was unfit to remain in holy orders.\r\nBut Boehler was a scholar and a gentleman, and acted throughout with\r\ntact. For some weeks John Wesley continued to be puzzled by Boehler's\r\ndoctrine of the holiness and happiness which spring from living faith;\r\nbut at last he came to the firm conclusion that what Boehler said on the\r\nsubject was precisely what was taught in the Church of England. He had\r\nread already in his own Church homilies that faith \"is a sure trust and\r\nconfidence which a man hath in God that through the merits of Christ\r\nhis sins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God\"; and\r\nyet, clergyman though he was, he had not yet that trust and confidence\r\nhimself. Instead, therefore, of teaching Wesley new doctrine, Peter\r\nBoehler simply informed him that some men, though of course not all,\r\nwere suddenly converted, that faith might be given in a moment, and that\r\nthus a man might pass at once from darkness to light and from sin and\r\nmisery to righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost. He had had that very\r\nexperience himself at Jena; he had known it as a solid fact in the case\r\nof others; and, therefore, speaking from his own personal knowledge,\r\nhe informed Wesley that when a man obtained true faith he acquired\r\nforthwith \"dominion over sin and constant peace from a sense of\r\nforgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Wesley was staggered. He called it a new Gospel. He would not\r\nbelieve that the sense of forgiveness could be given in a moment.\r\n\r\nFor answer Boehler appealed to the New Testament; and Wesley, looking to\r\nsee for himself, found that nearly all the cases of conversion mentioned\r\nthere were instantaneous. He contended, however, that such miracles did\r\nnot happen in the eighteenth century. Boehler brought four friends to\r\nprove that they did. Four examples, said Wesley, were not enough to\r\nprove a principle. Boehler promised to bring eight more. For some days\r\nWesley continued to wander in the valley of indecision, and consulted\r\nBoehler at every turn of the road. He persuaded Boehler to pray with\r\nhim; he joined him in singing Richter's hymn, \"My soul before Thee\r\nprostrate lies\"; and finally, he preached a sermon to four thousand\r\nhearers in London, enforcing that very faith in Christ which he himself\r\ndid not yet possess. But Boehler had now to leave for South Carolina.\r\nFrom Southampton he wrote a farewell letter to Wesley. \"Beware of the\r\nsin of unbelief,\" he wrote, \"and if you have not conquered it yet, see\r\nthat you conquer it this very day, through the blood of Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter produced its effect. The turning-point in John Wesley's\r\ncareer arrived. He was able to give, not only the day, but the hour,\r\nand almost the minute. As he was still under the influence of Boehler's\r\nteaching, many writers have here assumed that his conversion took place\r\nin a Moravian society.[110] The assumption is false. \"In the evening,\"\r\nsays Wesley, \"I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street\r\n{May 24th.}, where one was reading Luther's preface to the Epistle to\r\nthe Romans.\" At that time the society in Aldersgate Street had no more\r\nconnection with the Moravian Church than any other religious society in\r\nEngland. It was founded by James Hutton; it was an ordinary religious\r\nsociety; it consisted entirely of members of the Anglican Church; and\r\nthere, in an Anglican religious society, Wesley's conversion took place.\r\n\"About a quarter to nine,\" he says, \"while he was describing the change\r\nwhich God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart\r\nstrangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for\r\nsalvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins,\r\neven mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, despite some recurring doubts, John Wesley was a\r\nchanged man. If he had not exactly learned any new doctrine, he had\r\ncertainly passed through a new experience. He had peace in his heart; he\r\nwas sure of his salvation; and henceforth, as all readers know, he was\r\nable to forget himself, to leave his soul in the hands of God, and to\r\nspend his life in the salvation of his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Peter Boehler had done another good work. If his influence\r\nover John Wesley was great, his influence over Charles Wesley was\r\nalmost greater. For some weeks the two men appear to have been in daily\r\ncommunication; Charles Wesley taught Boehler English; and when Wesley\r\nwas taken ill Boehler on several occasions, both at Oxford and at James\r\nHutton's house in London, sat up with him during the night, prayed for\r\nhis recovery, and impressed upon him the value of faith and prayer.\r\nThe faith of Boehler was amazing. As soon as he had prayed for Wesley's\r\nrecovery, he turned to the sufferer and calmly said, \"You will not die\r\nnow.\" The patient felt he could not endure the pain much longer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hope to be saved?\" said Boehler.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what reason do you hope it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have used my best endeavours to serve God.\"\r\n\r\nBoehler shook his head, and said no more. As soon as Charles was\r\nrestored to health, he passed through the same experience as his brother\r\nJohn; and gladly ascribed both recovery and conversion to the faith and\r\nprayer of Boehler.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of Boehler's influence. As soon as he was able\r\nto speak English intelligibly, he began to give addresses on saving\r\nfaith to the good folk who met at James Hutton's house; and before long\r\nhe changed the whole character of the Society. It had been a society of\r\nseekers; it became a society of believers. It had been a group of\r\nHigh Churchmen; it became a group of Evangelicals. It had been a\r\nfree-and-easy gathering; it became a society with definite regulations.\r\nFor two years the Society was nothing less than the headquarters of the\r\ngrowing evangelical revival; and the rules drawn up by Peter Boehler\r\n(May 1st, 1738), just before he left for America, were the means of\r\nmaking it a vital power. In these rules the members were introducing,\r\nthough they knew it not, a new principle into English Church life.\r\nIt was the principle of democratic government. The Society was now a\r\nself-governing body; and all the members, lay and clerical, stood upon\r\nthe same footing. They met once a week to confess their faults to each\r\nother and to pray for each other; they divided the Society into \"bands,\"\r\nwith a leader at the head of each; and they laid down the definite rule\r\nthat \"every one, without distinction, submit to the determination of his\r\nBrethren.\"[111] The Society increased; the room at Hutton's house became\r\ntoo small; and Hutton therefore hired first a large room, and then a\r\nBaptist Hall, known as the Great Meeting House, in Fetter Lane.[112]\r\nFrom this time the Society was known as the Fetter Lane Society, and\r\nthe leading spirits were James Hutton and Charles Wesley. For a while\r\nthe hall was the home of happiness and peace. As the months rolled\r\non, various Moravians paid passing calls on their way to America; and\r\nHutton, the Wesleys, Delamotte and others became still more impressed\r\nwith the Brethren's teaching. Charles Wesley was delighted. As he walked\r\nacross the fields from his house at Islington to the Sunday evening\r\nlove-feast in Fetter Lane, he would sing for very joy. John Wesley was\r\nequally charmed. He had visited the Brethren at Marienborn and Herrnhut\r\n(August, 1738). He had listened with delight to the preaching of\r\nChristian David. He had had long chats about spiritual matters with\r\nMartin Linner, the Chief Elder, with David Nitschmann, with Albin Feder,\r\nwith Augustin Neisser, with Wenzel Neisser, with Hans Neisser, with\r\nDavid Schneider, and with Arvid Gradin, the historian; he felt he would\r\nlike to spend his life at Herrnhut; and in his Journal he wrote the\r\nwords, \"Oh, when shall this Christianity cover the earth as the waters\r\ncover the sea.\" At a Watch-Night service in Fetter Lane (Dec. 31st,\r\n1738) the fervour reached its height. At that service both the Wesleys,\r\nGeorge Whitefield, Benjamin Ingham, Kinchin and other Oxford Methodists\r\nwere present, and the meeting lasted till the small hours of the\r\nmorning. \"About three in the morning,\" says John Wesley, \"as we were\r\ncontinuing instant in prayer, the power of God came mightily upon us,\r\ninsomuch that many cried out for exceeding joy, and many fell to the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the while there was a worm within the bud. John Wesley soon\r\nfound serious faults in the Brethren. As he journeyed to Herrnhut, he\r\nhad called at Marienborn, and there they had given him what seemed to\r\nhim an unnecessary snub. For some reason which has never been fully\r\nexplained, they refused to admit him to the Holy Communion; and the\r\nonly reason they gave him was that he was a \"homo perturbatus,\" i.e., a\r\nrestless man.[113] For the life of him Wesley could not understand why\r\na \"restless man\" of good Christian character should not kneel at the\r\nLord's Table with the Brethren; and to make the insult more stinging\r\nstill, they actually admitted his companion, Benjamin Ingham. But the\r\nreal trouble lay at Fetter Lane. It is easy to put our finger on the\r\ncause. As long as people hold true to the faith and practice of their\r\nfathers they find it easy to live at peace with each other; but as soon\r\nas they begin to think for themselves they are sure to differ sooner or\r\nlater. And that was exactly what happened at Fetter Lane. The members\r\ncame from various stations in life. Some, like the Wesleys, were\r\nuniversity men; some, like Hutton, were middle-class tradesmen, of\r\nmoderate education; some, like Bray, the brazier, were artizans; and\r\nall stood on the same footing, and discussed theology with the zeal of\r\nnovices and the confidence of experts. John Wesley found himself in a\r\nstrange country. He had been brought up in the realm of authority; he\r\nfound himself in the realm of free discussion. Some said that saying\r\nfaith was one thing, and some said that it was another. Some said that\r\na man could receive the forgiveness of his sins without knowing it, and\r\nsome argued that if a man had any doubts he was not a true Christian\r\nat all. As Wesley listened to these discussions he grew impatient and\r\ndisgusted. The whole tone of the Society was distasteful to his mind.\r\nIf ever a man was born to rule it was Wesley; and here, at Fetter Lane,\r\ninstead of being captain, he was merely one of the crew, and could not\r\neven undertake a journey without the consent of the Society. The fetters\r\nwere beginning to gall.\r\n\r\nAt this point there arrived from Germany a strange young man on his way\r\nto America, who soon added fuel to the fire {Oct. 18th, 1739.}. His\r\nname was Philip Henry Molther. He was only twenty-five years old; he had\r\nbelonged to the Brethren's Church about a year; he had spent some months\r\nas tutor in Zinzendorf's family; he had picked up only the weak side\r\nof the Brethren's teaching; and now, with all the zeal of youth, he set\r\nforth his views in extravagant language, which soon filled Wesley with\r\nhorror. His power in the Society was immense, and four times a week, in\r\nbroken English, he preached to growing crowds. At first he was utterly\r\nshocked by what he saw. \"The first time I entered the meeting,\" he says,\r\n\"I was alarmed and almost terror-stricken at hearing their sighing and\r\ngroaning, their whining and howling, which strange proceeding they call\r\nthe demonstration of the Spirit and of power.\" For these follies Molther\r\nhad a cure of his own. He called it \"stillness.\" As long as men were\r\nsinners, he said, they were not to try to obtain saving faith by any\r\nefforts of their own. They were not to go to church. They were not to\r\ncommunicate. They were not to fast. They were not to use so much private\r\nprayer. They were not to read the Scriptures. They were not to do either\r\ntemporal or spiritual good. Instead of seeking Christ in these ways,\r\nsaid Molther, the sinner should rather sit still and wait for Christ to\r\ngive him the Divine revelation. If this doctrine had no other merit\r\nit had at least the charm of novelty. The dispute at Fetter Lane grew\r\nkeener than ever. On the one hand Hutton, James Bell, John Bray, and\r\nother simple-minded men regarded Molther as a preacher of the\r\npure Gospel. He had, said Hutton, drawn men away from many a false\r\nfoundation, and had led them to the only true foundation, Christ. \"No\r\nsoul,\" said another, \"can be washed in the blood of Christ unless it\r\nfirst be brought to one in whom Christ is fully formed. But there are\r\nonly two such men in London, Bell and Molther.\" John Bray, the brazier,\r\nwent further.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" he said, \"for anyone to be a true Christian outside\r\nthe Moravian Church.\"\r\n\r\nAs the man was outside that Church himself, and remained outside it all\r\nhis life, his statement is rather bewildering.[114]\r\nJohn Wesley was disgusted. He regarded Molther as a teacher of\r\ndangerous errors. The two men were poles asunder. The one was a quietist\r\nevangelical; the other a staunch High Churchman. According to Molther\r\nthe correct order was, through Christ to the ordinances of the Church;\r\naccording to Wesley, through the ordinances to Christ. According to\r\nMolther, a man ought to be a believer in Christ before he reads the\r\nBible, or attends Communion, or even does good works; according to\r\nWesley, a man should read his Bible, go to Communion, and do good works\r\nin order to become a believer. According to Molther the Sacrament was a\r\nprivilege, meant for believers only; according to Wesley it was a duty,\r\nand a means of grace for all men. According to Molther, the only means\r\nof grace was Christ; according to Wesley, there were many means of\r\ngrace, all leading the soul to Christ. According to Molther there were\r\nno degrees in faith; according to Wesley there were. No longer was the\r\nFetter Lane Society a calm abode of peace. Instead of trying to help\r\neach other the members would sometimes sit for an hour without speaking\r\na word; and sometimes they only reported themselves without having a\r\nproper meeting at all. John Wesley spoke his mind. He declared that\r\nSatan was beginning to rule in the Society. He heard that Molther was\r\ntaken ill, and regarded the illness as a judgment from heaven. At last\r\nthe wranglings came to an open rupture. At an evening meeting in Fetter\r\nLane {July 16th, 1740.}, John Wesley, resolved to clear the air, read\r\nout from a book supposed to be prized by the Brethren the following\r\nastounding doctrine: \"The Scriptures are good; prayer is good;\r\ncommunicating is good; relieving our neighbour is good; but to one who\r\nis not born of God, none of these is good, but all very evil. For him to\r\nread the Scriptures, or to pray, or to communicate, or to do any outward\r\nwork is deadly poison. First, let him be born of God. Till then, let him\r\nnot do any of these things. For if he does, he destroys himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe read the passage aloud two or three times. \"My brethren,\" he asked,\r\n\"is this right, or is this wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is right,\" said Richard Bell, the watchcase maker, \"it is all right.\r\nIt is the truth. To this we must all come, or we never can come to\r\nChrist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" broke in Bray, the brazier, \"our brother Bell did not hear\r\nwhat you read, or did not rightly understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I heard every word,\" said Bell, \"and I understand it well. I say\r\nit is the truth; it is the very truth; it is the inward truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used the ordinances twenty years,\" said George Bowers, the Dissenter,\r\nof George Yard, Little Britain, \"yet I found not Christ. But I left them\r\noff for only a few weeks and I found Him then. And I am now as close\r\nunited to Him as my arm is to my body.\"\r\n\r\nThe dispute was coming to a crisis. The discussion lasted till eleven\r\no'clock. Some said that Wesley might preach in Fetter Lane.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said others, \"this place is taken for the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nSome argued that Wesley had often put an end to confusions in the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\"Confusion!\" snapped others, \"What do you mean? We never were in any\r\nconfusion at all.\"\r\n\r\nNext Sunday evening Wesley appeared again {July 20th, 1740.}. He was\r\nresolved what to do.\r\n\r\n\"I find you,\" he said, \"more and more confirmed in the error of your\r\nways. Nothing now remains but that I should give you up to God. You that\r\nare of the same opinion follow me.\"\r\n\r\nAs some wicked joker had hidden his hat, he was not able to leave the\r\nroom with the dignity befitting the occasion; but eighteen supporters\r\nanswered to his call; and the face of John Wesley was seen in the Fetter\r\nLane Society no more. The breach was final; the wound remained open;\r\nand Moravians and Methodists went their several ways. For some years the\r\ndispute continued to rage with unabated fury. The causes were various.\r\nThe damage done by Molther was immense. The more Wesley studied the\r\nwritings of the Brethren the more convinced he became that in many ways\r\nthey were dangerous teachers. They thought, he said, too highly of their\r\nown Church. They would never acknowledge themselves to be in the wrong.\r\nThey submitted too much to the authority of Zinzendorf, and actually\r\naddressed him as Rabbi. They were dark and secret in their behaviour,\r\nand practised guile and dissimulation. They taught the doctrine of\r\nuniversal salvation. Above all, however, John Wesley held that the\r\nBrethren, like Molther, laid a one-sided stress on the doctrine of\r\njustification by faith alone. They were, he contended, Antinomians; they\r\nfollowed too closely the teaching of Luther; they despised the law, the\r\ncommandments, good works, and all forms of self-denial.\r\n\r\n\"You have lost your first joy,\" said one, \"therefore you pray: that is\r\nthe devil. You read the Bible: that is the devil. You communicate: that\r\nis the devil.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain Count Zinzendorf, longing for peace, endeavoured to pour oil on\r\nthe raging waters. The two leaders met in Gray's Inn Gardens and made\r\nan attempt to come to a common understanding {Sept. 3rd, 1741.}. The\r\nattempt was useless. The more keenly they argued the question out the\r\nfurther they drifted from each other. For Zinzendorf Wesley had never\r\nmuch respect, and he certainly never managed to understand him. If\r\na poet and a botanist talk about roses they are hardly likely to\r\nunderstand each other; and that was just how the matter stood between\r\nZinzendorf and Wesley. The Count was a poet, and used poetic, language.\r\nJohn Wesley was a level-headed Briton, with a mind as exact as a\r\ncalculating machine.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you left the Church of England?\"[115] began the Count.\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware that I had left the Church of England,\" replied Wesley.\r\n\r\nAnd then the two men began to discuss theology.\r\n\r\n\"I acknowledge no inherent perfection in this life,\" said the Count.\r\n\"This is the error of errors. I pursue it through the world with fire\r\nand sword. I trample it under foot. I exterminate it. Christ is our only\r\nperfection. Whoever follows after inherent perfection denies Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I believe,\" replied Wesley, \"that the Spirit of Christ works\r\nperfection in true Christians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied Zinzendorf, \"All our perfection is in Christ. The\r\nwhole of Christian perfection is imputed, not inherent. We are perfect\r\nin Christ--in ourselves, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" asked Wesley, in blank amazement, after Zinzendorf had hammered\r\nout his point. \"Does not a believer, while he increases in love,\r\nincrease equally in holiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" said the Count; \"the moment he is justified he is\r\nsanctified wholly. From that time, even unto death, he is neither more\r\nnor less holy. A babe in Christ is as pure in heart as a father in\r\nChrist. There is no difference.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the discussion the Count spoke a sentence which seemed\r\nto Wesley as bad as the teaching of Molther.\r\n\r\n\"We spurn all self-denial,\" he said, \"we trample it under foot. Being\r\nbelievers, we do whatever we will and nothing more. We ridicule all\r\nmortification. No purification precedes perfect love.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Count, by extravagant language, drove Wesley further away\r\nfrom the Brethren than ever.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Fetter Lane events were moving fast. As soon as Wesley\r\nwas out of the way, James Hutton came to the front; a good many\r\nMoravians--Bishop Nitschmann, Anna Nitschmann, John Toeltschig,\r\nGussenbauer, and others--began to arrive on the scene; and step by step\r\nthe Society became more Moravian in character. For this Hutton himself\r\nwas chiefly responsible. He maintained a correspondence with Zinzendorf,\r\nand was the first to introduce Moravian literature to English readers.\r\nHe published a collection of Moravian hymns, a Moravian Manual of\r\nDoctrine, and a volume in English of Zinzendorf's Berlin discourses.\r\nHe was fond of the Moravian type of teaching, and asked for Moravian\r\nteachers. His wish was speedily gratified. The foolish Molther departed.\r\nThe sober Spangenberg arrived. The whole movement now was raised to a\r\nhigher level. As soon as Spangenberg had hold of the reins the members,\r\ninstead of quarrelling with each other, began to apply themselves to the\r\nspread of the Gospel; and to this end they now established the \"Society\r\nfor the Furtherance of the Gospel.\" Its object was the support of\r\nforeign missions {1741.}. At its head was a committee of four, of whom\r\nJames Hutton was one. For many years the \"Society\" supported the foreign\r\nwork of the Brethren in English colonies; and in later years it supplied\r\nthe funds for the work in Labrador. The next step was to license the\r\nChapel in Fetter Lane. The need was pressing. As long as the members met\r\nwithout a licence they might be accused, at any time, of breaking the\r\nConventicle Act. They wished now to have the law on their side. Already\r\nthe windows had been broken by a mob. The services now were open to the\r\npublic. The chapel was becoming an evangelistic hall. The licence was\r\ntaken (Sept.). The members took upon themselves the name \"Moravian\r\nBrethren, formerly of the Anglican Communion.\" But the members at Fetter\r\nLane were not yet satisfied. For all their loyalty to the Church\r\nof England, they longed for closer communion with the Church of the\r\nBrethren; and William Holland openly asked the question, \"Can a man join\r\nthe Moravian Church and yet remain a member of the Anglican Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the answer, \"for they are sister Churches.\"\r\n\r\nFor this reason, therefore, and without any desire to become Dissenters,\r\na number of the members of the Fetter Lane Society applied to\r\nSpangenberg to establish a congregation of the Moravian Church in\r\nEngland. The cautious Spangenberg paused. For the fourth time a\r\nmomentous question was put to the decision of the Lot. The Lot\r\nsanctioned the move. The London congregation was established (November\r\n10th, 1742). It consisted of seventy-two members of the Fetter Lane\r\nSociety. Of those members the greater number were Anglicans, and\r\nconsidered themselves Anglicans still. And yet they were Brethren in the\r\nfullest sense and at least half of them took office. The congregation\r\nwas organized on the Herrnhut model. It was divided into \"Choirs.\"\r\nAt the head of each choir was an Elder; and further there were two\r\nCongregation Elders, two Wardens, two Admonitors, two Censors,\r\nfive Servants, and eight Sick-Waiters. Thus was the first Moravian\r\ncongregation established in England. For many years this Church in\r\nFetter Lane was the headquarters of Moravian work in Great Britain.\r\nAlready a new campaign had been started in Yorkshire; and a few years\r\nlater Boehler declared that this one congregation alone had sent out two\r\nhundred preachers of the Gospel.[116]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. -- YORKSHIRE AND THE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nAs we follow the strange and eventful story of the renewal of the\r\nBrethren's Church, we can hardly fail to be struck by the fact that\r\nwherever new congregations were planted the way was first prepared by\r\na man who did not originally belong to that Church himself. At Herrnhut\r\nthe leader was the Lutheran, Christian David; at Fetter Lane, James\r\nHutton, the Anglican clergyman's son; and in Yorkshire, the clergyman,\r\nBenjamin Ingham, who never joined the Moravian Church at all. He had,\r\nlike the Wesleys and Whitefield, taken part in the Evangelical Revival.\r\nHe was one of the Oxford Methodists, and had belonged to the Holy Club.\r\nHe had sailed with John Wesley on his voyage to America, had met the\r\nBrethren on board the Simmonds, and had learned to know them more\r\nthoroughly in Georgia. He had been with John Wesley to Marienborn, had\r\nbeen admitted to the Communion there, had then travelled on to Herrnhut,\r\nand had been \"exceedingly strengthened and comforted by the Christian\r\nconversation of the Brethren.\" He had often been at James Hutton's\r\nhouse, had attended services in Fetter Lane, was present at the famous\r\nWatch-Night Love-feast, and had thus learned to know the Brethren as\r\nthoroughly as Wesley himself. From first to last he held them in high\r\nesteem. \"They are,\" he wrote, \"more like the Primitive Christians than\r\nany other Church now in the world, for they retain both the faith,\r\npractice and discipline delivered by the Apostles. They live together\r\nin perfect love and peace. They are more ready to serve their neighbours\r\nthan themselves. In their business they are diligent and industrious, in\r\nall their dealings strictly just and conscientious. In everything they\r\nbehave themselves with great meekness, sweetness and simplicity.\"\r\n\r\nHis good opinion stood the test of time. He contradicted Wesley's\r\nevidence flatly. \"I cannot but observe,\" he wrote to his friend Jacob\r\nRogers, curate at St. Paul's, Bedford, \"what a slur you cast upon the\r\nMoravians about stillness. Do you think, my brother, that they don't\r\npray? I wish you prayed as much, and as well. They do not neglect\r\nprayers, either in public or in private; but they do not perform them\r\nmerely as things that must be done; they are inwardly moved to pray\r\nby the Spirit. What they have said about stillness has either been\r\nstrangely misunderstood or strangely misrepresented. They mean by it\r\nthat we should endeavour to keep our minds calm, composed and collected,\r\nfree from hurry and dissipation. And is not this right? They are neither\r\ndespisers nor neglecters of ordinances.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of Ingham was peculiar. He was a clergyman without a\r\ncharge; he resided at Aberford, in Yorkshire; he appears to have been\r\na man of considerable means; and now he devoted all his powers to the\r\nmoral and spiritual upliftment of the working-classes in the West Riding\r\nof Yorkshire. His sphere was the district between Leeds and Halifax. For\r\nignorance and brutality these Yorkshire people were then supposed to be\r\nunmatched in England. The parish churches were few and far between. The\r\npeople were sunk in heathen darkness. Young Ingham began pure missionary\r\nwork. He visited the people in their homes; he formed societies for\r\nBible Reading and Prayer; he preached the doctrine of saving faith in\r\nChrist; and before long he was able to say that he had fifty societies\r\nunder his care, two thousand hearers, three hundred inquirers, and a\r\nhundred genuine converts. For numbers, however, Ingham cared but little.\r\nHis object was to bring men into personal touch with Christ. \"I had\r\nrather,\" he said, \"see ten souls truly converted than ten thousand\r\nonly stirred up to follow.\" His work was opposed both by clergy and by\r\nlaymen. At Colne, in Lancashire, he was attacked by a raging mob. At the\r\nhead of the mob was the Vicar of Colne himself. The Vicar took Ingham\r\ninto a house and asked him to sign a paper promising not to preach\r\nagain. Ingham tore the paper in pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Bring him out and we'll make him,\" yelled the mob.\r\n\r\nThe Vicar went out; the mob pressed in; and clubs were flourished in the\r\nair \"as thick as a man's leg.\"\r\n\r\nSome wanted to kill him on the spot; others wished to throw him into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay,\" said others, \"we will heave him into the bog, then he will\r\nbe glad to go into the river and wash and sweeten himself.\"\r\n\r\nA stone \"as big as a man's fist,\" hit him in the hollow of the neck. His\r\ncoat-tails were bespattered with mud.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said a wit, \"he has got wings.\" At last the Vicar relented, took\r\nhim into the Vicarage, and thus saved him from an early death.\r\n\r\nBut Ingham had soon more irons in the fire than he could conveniently\r\nmanage. If these Yorkshire folk whom he had formed into societies were\r\nto make true progress in the spiritual life they must, he held, be\r\nplaced under the care of evangelical teachers. He could not look\r\nafter them himself; he was beginning new work further north, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Settle; and the best men he knew for his purpose were\r\nthe Moravians whom he had learned to admire in Georgia, London and\r\nHerrnhut. For one Brother, John Toeltschig, Ingham had a special\r\naffection, and while he was on his visit to Herrnhut he begged that\r\nToeltschig might be allowed to come with him to England. \"B. Ingham,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"sends greeting, and bids grace and peace to the most Reverend\r\nBishops, Lord Count Zinzendorf and David Nitschmann, and to the other\r\nesteemed Brethren in Christ. I shall be greatly pleased if, with your\r\nconsent, my beloved brother, John Toeltschig, be permitted to stay with\r\nme in England as long as our Lord and Saviour shall so approve. I am\r\nheartily united with you all in the bonds of love. Farewell. Herrnhut,\r\nSept. 29, 1738.\"[117] For our purpose this letter is surely of the deepest\r\ninterest. It proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the Moravians\r\nstarted their evangelistic campaign in England, not from sectarian\r\nmotives, but because they were invited by English Churchmen who valued\r\nthe Gospel message they had to deliver. As Hutton had begged for\r\nBoehler, so Ingham begged for Toeltschig; and Toeltschig paid a brief\r\nvisit to Yorkshire (November, 1739), helped Ingham in his work, and so\r\ndelighted the simple people that they begged that he might come to them\r\nagain. For a while the request was refused. At last Ingham took resolute\r\naction himself, called a mass meeting of Society members, and put to\r\nthem the critical question: \"Will you have the Moravians to work among\r\nyou?\" Loud shouts of approval rang out from every part of the building.\r\nAs Spangenberg was now in London the request was forwarded to him;\r\nhe laid it before the Fetter Lane Society; the members organized the\r\n\"Yorkshire Congregation\"; and the \"Yorkshire Congregation\" set out to\r\ncommence evangelistic work in earnest {May 26th, 1742.}. At the head of\r\nthe band was Spangenberg himself. As soon as he arrived in Yorkshire he\r\nhad a business interview with Ingham. For Spangenberg shouts of approval\r\nwere not enough. He wanted everything down in black and white. A\r\ndocument was prepared; the Societies were summoned again; the document\r\nwas laid before them; and twelve hundred Yorkshire Britons signed their\r\nnames to a request that the Brethren should work among them. From that\r\nmoment Moravian work in Yorkshire began. At one stroke--by a written\r\nagreement--the Societies founded by Benjamin Ingham were handed over to\r\nthe care of the Moravian Church. The Brethren entered upon the task with\r\nzeal. For some months, with Spangenberg as general manager, they made\r\ntheir head-quarters at Smith House, a farm building near Halifax {July,\r\n1742.}; and there, on Saturday afternoons, they met for united prayer,\r\nand had their meals together in one large room. At first they had a\r\nmixed reception. On the one hand a mob smashed the windows of Smith\r\nHouse; on the other, the serious Society members \"flocked to Smith House\r\nlike hungry bees.\" The whole neighbourhood was soon mapped out, and the\r\nworkers stationed at their posts. At Pudsey were Gussenbauer and his\r\nwife; at Great Horton, near Bradford, Toeltschig and Piesch; at Holbeck,\r\nnear Leeds, the Browns; and other workers were busy soon at Lightcliffe,\r\nWyke, Halifax, Mirfield, Hightown, Dewsbury, Wakefield, Leeds, Wortley,\r\nFarnley, Cleckheaton, Great Gomersal, and Baildon. The Moravian\r\nsystem of discipline was introduced. At the head of the men were John\r\nToeltschig and Richard Viney; at the head of the women Mrs. Pietch\r\nand Mrs. Gussenbauer; and Monitors, Servants, and Sick Waiters were\r\nappointed just as in Herrnhut. Here was a glorious field of labour; here\r\nwas a chance of Church extension; and the interesting question was, what\r\nuse the Brethren would make of it.\r\n\r\nAt this point Count Zinzendorf arrived in Yorkshire {Feb., 1743.}, went\r\nto see Ingham at Aberford, and soon organized the work in a way of\r\nhis own which effectually prevented it from spreading. His method was\r\ncentralization. At that time he held firmly to his pet idea that the\r\nBrethren, instead of forming new congregations, should rather be content\r\nwith \"diaspora\" work, and at the same time, whenever possible, build a\r\nsettlement on the Herrnhut or Herrnhaag model, for the cultivation\r\nof social religious life. At this time it so happened that the\r\nGussenbauers, stationed at Pudsey, were in trouble; their child was\r\nseriously ill; the Count rode over to see them; and while there he\r\nnoticed the splendid site on which Fulneck stands to-day. If the visitor\r\ngoes to Fulneck now he can hardly fail to be struck by its beauty. He is\r\nsure to admire its long gravel terrace, its neat parterres, its orchards\r\nand gardens, and, above all, its long line of plain stately buildings\r\nfacing the southern sun. But then the slope was wild and unkempt,\r\ncovered over with briars and brambles. Along the crown were a few small\r\ncottages. At one end, called Bankhouse, resided the Gussenbauers. From\r\nthere the view across the valley was splendid. The estate was known as\r\nFalneck. The idea of a settlement rose before Zinzendorf's mind. The\r\nspirit of prophecy came upon him, and he named the place \"Lamb's Hill.\"\r\nFor the next few days the Count and his friends enjoyed the hospitality\r\nof Ingham at Aberford; and a few months later Ingham heard that the\r\nland and houses at Falneck were on the market. He showed himself a true\r\nfriend of the Brethren. He bought the estate, gave them part of it for\r\nbuilding, let out the cottages to them as tenants, and thus paved the\r\nway for the introduction of the Moravian settlement system into England.\r\n\r\nFor good or for evil that settlement system was soon the leading feature\r\nof the English work. The building of Fulneck began. First the Brethren\r\ncalled the place Lamb's Hill, then Gracehall, and then Fulneck, in\r\nmemory of Fulneck in Moravia. From friends in Germany they received\r\ngifts in money, from friends in Norway a load of timber. The Single\r\nBrethren were all aglow with zeal; and on one occasion they spent the\r\nwhole night in saying prayers and singing hymns upon the chosen sites.\r\nFirst rose the Chapel (1746), then the Minister's House and the rooms\r\nbeneath and just to the east of the Chapel (1748), then the Brethren's\r\nand Sisters' Houses (1752), then the Widows' House (1763), then the\r\nShop and Inn (1771), then the Cupola (1779), and then the Boys' Boarding\r\nSchool (1784-5). Thus, step by step, the long line of buildings arose, a\r\nsight unlike any other in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs the Brethren settled down in that rough Yorkshire country, they had\r\na noble purpose, which was a rebuke to the godless and cynical spirit\r\nof the age. \"Is a Christian republic possible?\" asked the French\r\nphilosopher, Bayle. According to the world it was not; according to the\r\nBrethren it was; and here at Fulneck they bravely resolved to put the\r\nmatter to the proof. As long as that settlement existed, said they,\r\nthere would be a kingdom where the law of Christ would reign supreme,\r\nwhere Single Brethren, Single Sisters, and Widows, would be screened\r\nfrom the temptations of the wicked world, where candidates would\r\nbe trained for the service of the Church and her Master, where\r\nmissionaries, on their way to British Colonies, could rest awhile, and\r\nlearn the English language, where children, in an age when schools were\r\nscarce, could be brought up in the fear of God, and where trade would\r\nbe conducted, not for private profit, but for the benefit of all. At\r\nFulneck, in a word, the principles of Christ would be applied to the\r\nwhole round of Moravian life. There dishonesty would be unknown; cruel\r\noppression would be impossible; doubtful amusements would be forbidden;\r\nand thus, like their German Brethren in Herrnhut, these keen and hardy\r\nYorkshire folk were to learn by practical experience that it is more\r\nblessed to give than to receive, and more delightful to work for a\r\ncommon cause than for a private balance at the bank.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the Brethren established what were then known as\r\ndiaconies; and a diacony was simply an ordinary business conducted,\r\nnot by a private individual for his own personal profit, but by some\r\nofficial of the congregation for the benefit of the congregation as a\r\nwhole. For example, James Charlesworth, a Single Brother, was appointed\r\nmanager of a cloth-weaving factory, which for some years did a splendid\r\ntrade with Portugal and Russia, kept the Single Brethren in regular\r\nemployment, and supplied funds for general Church objects. As the\r\nyears rolled on, the Brethren established a whole series of\r\ncongregation-diaconies: a congregation general dealer's shop, a\r\ncongregation farm, a congregation bakery, a congregation glove factory,\r\nand, finally, a congregation boarding-house or inn. At each diacony the\r\nmanager and his assistants received a fixed salary, and the profits of\r\nthe business helped to swell the congregation funds. The ideal was\r\nas noble as possible. At Fulneck daily labour was sanctified, and men\r\ntoiled in the sweat of their brows, not because they wanted to line\r\ntheir pockets, but because they wanted to help the cause of Christ. For\r\nthe sake of the Church the baker kneaded, the weaver plied his shuttle,\r\nthe Single Sisters did needlework of marvellous beauty and manufactured\r\ntheir famous marble-paper. For many years, too, these Brethren\r\nat Fulneck employed a congregation doctor; and the object of this\r\ngentleman's existence was not to build up a flourishing practice, but to\r\npreserve the good health of his beloved Brethren and Sisters.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, regard the Brethren as communists. James Hutton\r\nwas questioned on this by the Earl of Shelburne.\r\n\r\n\"Does everything which is earned among you,\" said the Earl, \"belong to\r\nthe community?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Hutton, \"but people contribute occasionally out of what\r\nthey earn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet this system, so beautiful to look at, was beset by serious\r\ndangers. It required more skill than the Brethren possessed, and more\r\nsupervision than was humanly possible. As long as a business flourished\r\nand paid the congregation reaped the benefit; but if, on the other hand,\r\nthe business failed, the congregation suffered, not only in money, but\r\nin reputation. At one time James Charlesworth, in an excess of zeal,\r\nmortgaged the manufacturing business, speculated with the money, and\r\nlost it; and thus caused others to accuse the Brethren of wholesale\r\nrobbery and fraud. Again, the system was opposed in a measure to the\r\nEnglish spirit of self-help and independence. As long as a man was\r\nengaged in a diacony, he was in the service of the Church; he did not\r\nreceive a sufficient salary to enable him to provide for old age; he\r\nlooked to the Church to provide his pension and to take care of him when\r\nhe was ill; and thus he lost that self-reliance which is said to be the\r\nbackbone of English character. But the most disastrous effect of\r\nthese diaconies was on the settlement as a whole. They interfered with\r\nvoluntary giving; they came to be regarded as Church endowments; and\r\nthe people, instead of opening their purses, relied on the diaconies\r\nto supply a large proportion of the funds for the current expenses of\r\ncongregation life. And here we cannot help but notice the difference\r\nbetween the Moravian diacony system and the well-known system of\r\nfree-will offerings enforced by John Wesley in his Methodist societies.\r\nAt first sight, the Moravian system might look more Christian; at\r\nbottom, Wesley's system proved the sounder; and thus, while Methodism\r\nspread, the Moravian river was choked at the fountain head.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of settlement life was its tendency to encourage\r\nisolation. For many years the rule was enforced at Fulneck that none but\r\nMoravians should be allowed to live in that sacred spot; and the laws\r\nwere so strict that the wonder is that Britons submitted at all. For\r\nexample, there was actually a rule that no member should spend a night\r\noutside the settlement without the consent of the Elders' Conference.\r\nIf this rule had been confined to young men and maidens, there would\r\nnot have been very much to say against it; but when it was enforced on\r\nbusiness men, who might often want to travel at a moment's notice, it\r\nbecame an absurdity, and occasioned some vehement kicking against the\r\npricks. The Choir-houses, too, were homes of the strictest discipline.\r\nAt the west end stood the Single Brethren's House, where the young men\r\nlived together. They all slept in one large dormitory; they all rose\r\nat the same hour, and met for prayers before breakfast; they were all\r\nexpected to attend certain services, designed for their special benefit;\r\nand they had all to turn in at a comparatively early hour. At the east\r\nend--two hundred yards away--stood the Single Sisters' House; and there\r\nsimilar rules were in full force. For all Sisters there were dress\r\nregulations, which many must have felt as a grievous burden. At Fulneck\r\nthere was nothing in the ladies' dress to show who was rich and who was\r\npoor. They all wore the same kind of material; they had all to submit\r\nto black, grey, or brown; they all wore the same kind of three-cornered\r\nwhite shawl; and the only dress distinction was the ribbon in the cap,\r\nwhich showed to which estate in life the wearer belonged. For married\r\nwomen the colour was blue; for widows, white; for young women, pink; and\r\nfor girls under eighteen, red. At the services in church the audience\r\nsat in Choirs, the women and girls on one side, the men and boys on the\r\nother. The relations between the sexes were strictly guarded. If a young\r\nman desired to marry, he was not even allowed to speak to his choice\r\nwithout the consent of the Elders' Conference; the Conference generally\r\nsubmitted the question to the Lot; and if the Lot gave a stern refusal,\r\nhe was told that his choice was disapproved by God, and enjoined to fix\r\nhis affections on someone else. The system had a twofold effect. It led,\r\non the one hand, to purity and peace; on the other, to spiritual pride.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this settlement life was the presence of officials.\r\nAt Fulneck the number of Church officials was enormous. The place of\r\nhonour was held by the Elders' Conference. It consisted of all the\r\nministers of the Yorkshire District, the Fulneck Single Brethren's\r\nLabourer, the Single Sisters' Labouress, and the Widows' Labouress. It\r\nmet at Fulneck once a month, had the general oversight of the Yorkshire\r\nwork, and was supposed to watch the personal conduct of every individual\r\nmember. Next came the Choir Elders' Conference. It consisted of a number\r\nof lay assistants, called Choir Helpers, had no independent powers of\r\naction, and acted as advisory board to the Elders' Conference. Next came\r\nthe Congregation Committee. It was elected by the voting members of the\r\ncongregation, had charge of the premises and finances, and acted as\r\na board of arbitration in cases of legal dispute. Next came the\r\nLarge Helpers' Conference. It consisted of the Committee, the Elders'\r\nConference, and certain others elected by the congregation. Next\r\ncame the Congregation Council, a still larger body elected by the\r\nCongregation. At first sight these institutions look democratic enough.\r\nIn reality, they were not democratic at all. The mode of election was\r\npeculiar. As soon as the votes had been collected the names of those at\r\nthe top of the poll were submitted to the Lot; and only those confirmed\r\nby the Lot were held to be duly elected. The real power lay in the hands\r\nof the Elders' Conference. They were the supreme court of appeal; they\r\nwere members, by virtue of their office, of the Committee; and they\r\nalone had the final decision as to who should be received as members\r\nand who should not. The whole system was German rather than English\r\nin conception. It was the system, not of popular control, but of\r\necclesiastical official authority.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking feature of the settlement system is still to\r\nbe mentioned. It was the road, not to Church extension, but to Church\r\nextinction. If the chief object which the Brethren set before them was\r\nto keep that Church as small as possible, they could hardly have adopted\r\na more successful method. We may express that method in the one word\r\n\"centralization.\" For years the centre of the Yorkshire work was\r\nFulneck. At Fulneck met the Elders' Conference. At Fulneck all Choir\r\nFestivals were held; at these Festivals the members from the other\r\ncongregations were expected to be present; and when John de Watteville\r\narrived upon the scene (1754) he laid down the regulation that although\r\nin future there were to be \"as many congregations as chapels in\r\nYorkshire,\" yet all were still to be one body, and all members must\r\nappear at Fulneck at least once a quarter! At Fulneck alone--in these\r\nearlier years--did the Brethren lay out a cemetery; and in that cemetery\r\nall funerals were to be conducted. The result was inevitable. As long as\r\nthe other congregations were tied to the apron strings of Fulneck they\r\ncould never attain to independent growth. I give one instance to show\r\nhow the system worked. At Mirfield a young Moravian couple lost a child\r\nby death. As the season was winter, and the snow lay two feet deep, they\r\ncould not possibly convey the coffin to Fulneck; and therefore they had\r\nthe funeral conducted by the Vicar at Mirfield. For this sin they were\r\nboth expelled from the Moravian Church. At heart, in fact, these early\r\nBrethren had no desire for Moravian Church extension whatever. They\r\nnever asked anyone to attend their meetings, and never asked anyone to\r\njoin their ranks. If any person expressed a desire to become a member\r\nof the Moravian Church, he was generally told in the first instance \"to\r\nabide in the Church of England\"; and only when he persisted and begged\r\nwas his application even considered. And even then they threw obstacles\r\nin his way. They first submitted his application to the Lot. If the Lot\r\nsaid \"No,\" he was rejected, and informed that the Lord did not wish him\r\nto join the Brethren's Church. If the Lot said \"Yes,\" he had still a\r\ndeep river to cross. The \"Yes\" did not mean that he was admitted; it\r\nonly meant that his case would be considered. He was now presented with\r\na document called a \"testimonial,\" informing him that his application\r\nwas receiving attention. He had then to wait two years; his name was\r\nsubmitted to the Elders' Conference; the Conference inquired into all\r\nhis motives, and put him through a searching examination; and at the end\r\nof the two years he was as likely to be rejected as accepted. For these\r\nrules the Brethren had one powerful reason of their own. They had no\r\ndesire to steal sheep from the Church of England. At the very outset\r\nof their campaign they did their best to make their position clear. \"We\r\nwish for nothing more,\" they declared, in a public notice in the Daily\r\nAdvertiser, August 2nd, 1745, \"than that some time or other there might\r\nbe some bishop or parish minister found of the English Church, to whom,\r\nwith convenience and to the good liking of all sides, we could\r\ndeliver the care of those persons of the English Church who have given\r\nthemselves to our care.\"\r\n\r\nThus did the Brethren, with Fulneck as a centre, commence their work in\r\nYorkshire. At three other villages--Wyke, Gomersal, and Mirfield--they\r\nestablished so-called \"country congregations\" with chapel and minister's\r\nhouse. The work caused a great sensation. At one time a mob came out\r\nfrom Leeds threatening to burn Fulneck to the ground. At another time a\r\nneighbouring landlord sent his men to destroy all the linen hung out\r\nto dry. At the first Easter Morning Service in Fulneck four thousand\r\nspectators assembled to witness the solemn service. And the result of\r\nthe Brethren's labours was that while their own numbers were always\r\nsmall they contributed richly to the revival of evangelical piety in the\r\nWest Riding of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIn the Midlands the system had just the same results. At the village of\r\nOckbrook, five miles from Derby, the Brethren built another beautiful\r\nsettlement. For some years, with Ockbrook as a centre, they had a clear\r\nfield for work in the surrounding district; they had preaching places\r\nat Eaton, Belper, Codnor, Matlock, Wolverhampton, Sheffield, Dale, and\r\nother towns and villages; and yet not a single one of these places ever\r\ndeveloped into a congregation.\r\n\r\nIn Bedfordshire the result was equally fatal. At first the Brethren\r\nhad a golden chance in Bedford. There, in 1738, there was a terrible\r\nepidemic of small-pox; in one week sixty or seventy persons died; nearly\r\nall the clergy had fled from the town in terror; and then Jacob Rogers,\r\nthe curate of St. Paul's, sent for Ingham and Delamotte to come to the\r\nrescue. The two clergymen came; some Moravians followed; a Moravian\r\ncongregation at Bedford was organized; and before long the Brethren had\r\ntwenty societies round Bunyan's charming home. And yet not one of these\r\nsocieties became a new congregation. As Fulneck was the centre for\r\nYorkshire, so Bedford was the centre for Bedfordshire; and the system\r\nthat checked expansion in the North strangled it at its birth in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. -- THE LABOURS OF JOHN CENNICK, 1739-1755.\r\n\r\nOnce more an Anglican paved the way for the Brethren. At the terrible\r\nperiod of the Day of Blood one Brother, named Cennick, fled from Bohemia\r\nto England; and now, about a hundred years later, his descendant, John\r\nCennick, was to play a great part in the revival of the Brethren's\r\nChurch. For all that, John Cennick, in the days of his youth, does not\r\nappear to have known very much about his ecclesiastical descent. He was\r\nborn (1718) and brought up at Reading, and was nursed from first to last\r\nin the Anglican fold. He was baptized at St. Lawrence Church; attended\r\nservice twice a day with his mother; was confirmed and took the\r\nCommunion; and, finally, at a service in the Church, while the psalms\r\nwere being read, he passed through that critical experience in life to\r\nwhich we commonly give the name \"conversion.\" For us, therefore, the\r\npoint to notice is that John Cennick was truly converted to God, and was\r\nfully assured of his own salvation before he had met either Moravians\r\nor Methodists, and before he even knew, in all probability, that such\r\npeople as the Moravians existed. We must not ascribe his conversion to\r\nMoravian influence. If we seek for human influence at all let us give\r\nthe honour to his mother; but the real truth appears to be that what\r\nJohn Wesley learned from Boehler, John Cennick learned by direct\r\ncommunion with God. His spiritual experience was as deep and true as\r\nWesley's. He had been, like Wesley, in the castle of Giant Despair, and\r\nhad sought, like Wesley, to attain salvation by attending the ordinances\r\nof the Church. He had knelt in prayer nine times a day; he had watched;\r\nhe had fasted; he had given money to the poor; he had almost gone mad in\r\nhis terror of death and of the judgment day; and, finally, without any\r\nhuman aid, in his pew at St. Lawrence Church, he heard, he tells us,\r\nthe voice of Jesus saying, \"I am thy salvation,\" and there and then his\r\nheart danced for joy and his dying soul revived.\r\n\r\nAt that time, as far as I can discover, he had not even heard of the\r\nOxford Methodists; but a few months later he heard strange news of\r\nWesley's Oxford comrade, Charles Kinchin. The occasion was a private\r\ncard party at Reading. John Cennick was asked to take a hand, and\r\nrefused. For this he was regarded as a prig, and a young fellow in\r\nthe company remarked, \"There is just such a stupid religious fellow\r\nat Oxford, one Kinchin.\" Forthwith, at the earliest opportunity, John\r\nCennick set off on foot for Oxford, to seek out the \"stupid religious\r\nfellow\"; found him sallying out of his room to breakfast; was introduced\r\nby Kinchin to the Wesleys; ran up to London, called at James Hutton's,\r\nand there met George Whitefield; fell on the great preacher's neck\r\nand kissed him; and was thus drawn into the stream of the Evangelical\r\nRevival at the very period in English history when Wesley and Whitefield\r\nfirst began preaching in the open air. He was soon a Methodist preacher\r\nhimself {1739.}. At Kingswood, near Bristol, John Wesley opened a\r\ncharity school for the children of colliers; and now he gave Cennick the\r\npost of head master, and authorized him also to visit the sick and to\r\nexpound the Scriptures in public. The preacher's mantle soon fell\r\non Cennick's shoulders. At a service held under a sycamore tree, the\r\nappointed preacher, Sammy Wather, was late; the crowd asked Cennick\r\nto take his place; and Cennick, after consulting the Lot, preached his\r\nfirst sermon in the open air. For the next eighteen months he now acted,\r\nlike Maxfield and Humphreys, as one of Wesley's first lay assistant\r\npreachers; and as long as he was under Wesley's influence he preached\r\nin Wesley's sensational style, with strange sensational results. At the\r\nservices the people conducted themselves like maniacs. Some foamed at\r\nthe mouth and tore themselves in hellish agonies. Some suffered from\r\nswollen tongues and swollen necks. Some sweated enormously, and broke\r\nout in blasphemous language. At one service, held in the Kingswood\r\nschoolroom, the place became a pandemonium; and Cennick himself\r\nconfessed with horror that the room was like the habitation of lost\r\nspirits. Outside a thunderstorm was raging; inside a storm of yells\r\nand roars. One woman declared that her name was Satan; another was\r\nBeelzebub; and a third was Legion. And certainly they were all behaving\r\nnow like folk possessed with demons. From end to end of the room they\r\nraced, bawling and roaring at the top of their voices.\r\n\r\n\"The devil will have me,\" shrieked one. \"I am his servant. I am damned.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sins can never be pardoned,\" said another. \"I am gone, gone for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\n\"That fearful thunder,\" moaned a third, \"is raised by the devil; in this\r\nstorm he will bear me to hell.\"\r\n\r\nA young man, named Sommers, roared like a dragon, and seven strong men\r\ncould hardly hold him down.\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand devils,\" he roared, \"millions, millions of devils are\r\nabout me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring Mr. Cennick! Bring Mr. Cennick!\" was heard on every side; and\r\nwhen Mr. Cennick was brought they wanted to tear him in pieces.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage in the great Revival exhibitions of this frantic\r\nnature were fairly common in England; and John Wesley, so far from being\r\nshocked, regarded the kicks and groans of the people as signs that\r\nthe Holy Spirit was convicting sinners of their sin. At first Cennick\r\nhimself had the same opinion; but before very long his common sense came\r\nto his rescue. He differed with Wesley on the point; he differed with\r\nhim also on the doctrine of predestination; he differed with him,\r\nthirdly, on the doctrine of Christian perfection; and the upshot of the\r\nquarrel that Wesley dismissed John Cennick from his service.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as Cennick was free, he joined forces, first\r\nwith Howell Harris, and then with Whitefield; and entered on that\r\nevangelistic campaign which was soon to bring him into close touch\r\nwith the Brethren. For five years he was now engaged in preaching\r\nin Gloucestershire and Wiltshire {1740-5.}; and wherever he went he\r\naddressed great crowds and was attacked by furious mobs. At Upton-Cheyny\r\nthe villagers armed themselves with a horn, a drum, and a few brass\r\npans, made the echoes ring with their horrible din, and knocked the\r\npreachers on the head with the pans; a genius put a cat in a cage, and\r\nbrought some dogs to bark at it; and others hit Cennick on the nose\r\nand hurled dead dogs at his head. At Swindon--where Cennick and Harris\r\npreached in a place called the Grove--some rascals fired muskets over\r\ntheir heads, held the muzzles close up to their faces, and made them as\r\nblack as tinkers; and others brought the local fire-engine and drenched\r\nthem with dirty water from the ditches. At Exeter a huge mob stormed\r\nthe building, stripped some of the women of their clothing, stamped upon\r\nthem in the open street, and rolled them naked in the gutters.[118] At\r\nStratton, a village not far from Swindon, the mob--an army two miles in\r\nlength--hacked at the horses' legs, trampled the Cennickers under their\r\nfeet, and battered Cennick till his shoulders were black and blue. At\r\nLangley the farmers ducked him in the village pond. At Foxham, Farmer\r\nLee opposed him; and immediately, so the story ran, a mad dog bit all\r\nthe farmer's pigs. At Broadstock Abbey an ingenious shepherd dressed\r\nup his dog as a preacher, called it Cennick, and speedily sickened and\r\ndied; and the Squire of Broadstock, who had sworn in his wrath to cut\r\noff the legs of all Cennickers who walked through his fields of green\r\npeas, fell down and broke his neck. If these vulgar incidents did not\r\nteach a lesson they would hardly be worth recording; but the real lesson\r\nthey teach us is that in those days the people of Wiltshire were in a\r\nbenighted condition, and that Cennick was the man who led the revival\r\nthere. As he rode on his mission from village to village, and from town\r\nto town, he was acting, not as a wild free-lance, but as the assistant\r\nof George Whitefield; and if it is fair to judge of his style by the\r\nsermons that have been preserved, he never said a word in those sermons\r\nthat would not pass muster in most evangelical pulpits to-day. He never\r\nattacked the doctrines of the Church of England; he spoke of the Church\r\nas \"our Church\"; and he constantly backed up his arguments by appeals\r\nto passages in the Book of Common Prayer. In spite of his lack of\r\nUniversity training he was no illiterate ignoramus. The more he knew\r\nof the Wiltshire villagers the more convinced he became that what they\r\nrequired was religious education. For their benefit, therefore, he now\r\nprepared some simple manuals of instruction: a \"Treatise on the Holy\r\nGhost,\" an \"Exhortation to Steadfastness,\" a \"Short Catechism for the\r\nInstruction of Youth,\" a volume of hymns entitled \"A New Hymnbook,\"\r\na second entitled \"Sacred Hymns for the Children of God in the Day of\r\ntheir Pilgrimage,\" and a third entitled \"Sacred Hymns for the Use of\r\nReligious Societies.\" What sort of manuals, it may be asked, did Cennick\r\nprovide? I have read them carefully; and have come to the conclusion\r\nthat though Cennick was neither a learned theologian nor an original\r\nreligious thinker, he was fairly well up in his subject. For example,\r\nin his \"Short Catechism\" he shows a ready knowledge of the Bible and a\r\nclear understanding of the evangelical position; and in his \"Treatise\r\non the Holy Ghost\" he quotes at length, not only from the Scriptures\r\nand the Prayer-book, but also from Augustine, Athanasius, Tertullian,\r\nChrysostom, Calvin, Luther, Ridley, Hooper, and other Church Fathers\r\nand Protestant Divines. He was more than a popular preacher. He was a\r\nthorough and competent teacher. He made his head-quarters at the\r\nvillage of Tytherton, near Chippenham (Oct. 25, 1742); there, along with\r\nWhitefield, Howell Harris and others, he met his exhorters and stewards\r\nin conference; and meanwhile he established also religious societies at\r\nBath, Brinkworth, Foxham, Malmesbury, and many other villages.\r\n\r\nAt last, exactly like Ingham in Yorkshire, he found that he had too many\r\nirons in the fire, and determined to hand his societies over to the\r\ncare of the Moravian Church. He had met James Hutton, Zinzendorf,\r\nSpangenberg, Boehler, and other Moravians in London, and the more he\r\nknew of these men the more profoundly convinced he became that the\r\npicture of the Brethren painted by John Wesley in his Journal was no\r\nbetter than a malicious falsehood. At every point in his evidence, which\r\nlies before me in his private diary and letters, John Cennick, to\r\nput the matter bluntly, gives John Wesley the lie. He denied that the\r\nBrethren practised guile; he found them uncommonly open and sincere.\r\nHe denied that they were Antinomians, who despised good works; he\r\nfound them excellent characters. He denied that they were narrow-minded\r\nbigots, who would never acknowledge themselves to be in the wrong; he\r\nfound them remarkably tolerant and broad-minded. At this period, in\r\nfact, he had so high an opinion of the Brethren that he thought they\r\nalone were fitted to reconcile Wesley and Whitefield; and on one\r\noccasion he persuaded some Moravians, Wesleyans and Calvinists to join\r\nin a united love-feast at Whitefield's Tabernacle, and sing a common\r\nconfession of faith {Nov. 4th, 1744.}.[119] John Cennick was a man of the\r\nMoravian type. The very qualities in the Brethren that offended Wesley\r\nwon the love of Cennick. He loved the way they spoke of Christ; he loved\r\ntheir \"Blood and Wounds Theology\"; and when he read the \"Litany of the\r\nWounds of Jesus,\" he actually, instead of being disgusted, shed tears of\r\njoy. For these reasons, therefore, Cennick went to London, consulted the\r\nBrethren in Fetter Lane, and besought them to undertake the care of his\r\nWiltshire societies. The result was the same as in Yorkshire. As long as\r\nthe request came from Cennick alone the Brethren turned a deaf ear. But\r\nthe need in Wiltshire was increasing. The spirit of disorder was growing\r\nrampant. At Bath and Bristol his converts were quarrelling; at Swindon a\r\nyoung woman went into fits and described them as signs of the New Birth;\r\nand a young man named Jonathan Wildboar, who had been burned in the hand\r\nfor stealing linen, paraded the country showing his wound as a proof of\r\nhis devotion to Christ. For these follies Cennick knew only one cure;\r\nand that cure was the \"apostolic discipline\" of the Brethren. He called\r\nhis stewards together to a conference at Tytherton; the stewards drew\r\nup a petition; the Brethren yielded; some workers came down {Dec. 18th,\r\n1745.}; and thus, at the request of the people themselves, the Moravians\r\nbegan their work in the West of England.\r\n\r\nIf the Brethren had now been desirous of Church extension, they would,\r\nof course, have turned Cennick's societies into Moravian congregations.\r\nBut the policy they now pursued in the West was a repetition of their\r\nsuicidal policy in Yorkshire. Instead of forming a number of independent\r\ncongregations, they centralized the work at Tytherton, and compelled the\r\nother societies to wait in patience. At Bristol, then the second town in\r\nthe kingdom, the good people had to wait ten years (1755); at Kingswood,\r\ntwelve years (1757); at Bath, twenty years (1765); at Malmesbury,\r\ntwenty-five years (1770); at Devonport, twenty-six years (1771); and\r\nthe other societies had to wait so long that finally they lost their\r\npatience, and died of exhaustion and neglect.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cennick, however, had left his societies in the care of the\r\nBrethren {1746.}, he set off on a tour to Germany, spent three months\r\nat Herrnhaag, was received as a member, returned a Moravian, and then\r\nentered on his great campaign in Ireland. He began in Dublin, and took\r\nthe city by storm. For a year or so some pious people, led by Benjamin\r\nLa Trobe, a Baptist student, had been in the habit of meeting for\r\nsinging and prayer; and now, with these as a nucleus, Cennick began\r\npreaching in a Baptist Hall at Skinner's Alley. It was John Cennick, and\r\nnot John Wesley, who began the Evangelical Revival in Ireland. He was\r\nworking in Dublin for more than a year before Wesley arrived on the\r\nscene. The city was the hunting ground for many sects; the Bradilonians\r\nand Muggletonians were in full force; the Unitarians exerted a\r\nwidespread influence; and the bold way in which Cennick exalted the\r\nDivinity of Christ was welcomed like a pulse of fresh air. The first\r\nSunday the people were turned away in hundreds. The hall in Skinner's\r\nAlley was crowded out. The majority of his hearers were Catholics. The\r\nwindows of the hall had to be removed, and the people were in their\r\nplaces day after day three hours before the time. On Sundays the roofs\r\nof the surrounding houses were black with the waiting throng; every\r\nwindow and wall became a sitting; and Cennick himself had to climb\r\nthrough a window and crawl on the heads of the people to the pulpit. \"If\r\nyou make any stay in this town,\" wrote a Carmelite priest, in his Irish\r\nzeal, \"you will make as many conversions as St. Francis Xavier among the\r\nwild Pagans. God preserve you!\" At Christmas Cennick forgot his manners,\r\nattacked the Church of Rome in offensive language, and aroused the just\r\nindignation of the Catholic priests.\r\n\r\n\"I curse and blaspheme,\" he said, \"all the gods in heaven, but the Babe\r\nthat lay in Mary's lap, the Babe that lay in swaddling clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThe quick-witted Irish jumped with joy at the phrase. From that moment\r\nCennick was known as \"Swaddling John\";[120] and his name was introduced\r\ninto comic songs at the music-halls. As he walked through the streets\r\nhe had now to be guarded by an escort of friendly soldiers; and the\r\nmob, ten or fifteen thousand in number, pelted him with dirt, stones and\r\nbricks. At one service, says the local diary, \"near 2,000 stones were\r\nthrown against Brothers Cennick and La Trobe, of which, however, not one\r\ndid hit them.\" Father Duggan denounced him in a pamphlet entitled \"The\r\nLady's Letter to Mr. Cennick\"; Father Lyons assured his flock that\r\nCennick was the devil in human form; and others passed from hand to\r\nhand a pamphlet, written by Gilbert Tennent, denouncing the Moravians as\r\ndangerous and immoral teachers.\r\n\r\nAt this interesting point, when Cennick's name was on every lip, John\r\nWesley paid his first visit to Dublin {August, 1747.}. For Cennick\r\nWesley entertained a thorough contempt. He called him in his Journal\r\n\"that weak man, John Cennick\"; he accused him of having ruined the\r\nsociety at Kingswood; he was disgusted when he heard that he had become\r\na Moravian; and now he turned him out of Skinner's Alley by the simple\r\nprocess of negotiating privately with the owner of the property, and\r\nbuying the building over Cennick's head. At one stroke the cause in\r\nSkinner's Alley passed over into Methodist hands; and the pulpit in\r\nwhich Cennick had preached to thousands was now occupied by John Wesley\r\nand his assistants. From that blow the Brethren's cause in Dublin\r\nnever fully recovered. For a long time they were unable to find another\r\nbuilding, and had to content themselves with meetings in private houses;\r\nbut at last they hired a smaller building in Big Booter Lane,[121] near\r\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral; two German Brethren, John Toeltschig and\r\nBryzelius, came over to organize the work; Peter Boehler, two years\r\nlater, \"settled\" the congregation; and thus was established, in a modest\r\nway, that small community of Moravians whose descendants worship there\r\nto the present day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile John Cennick was ploughing another field. For some years he\r\nwas busily engaged--first as an authorized lay evangelist and then as\r\nan ordained Moravian minister--in preaching and founding religious\r\nsocieties in Cos. Antrim, Down, Derry, Armagh, Tyrone, Cavan, Monaghan,\r\nand Donegal {1748-55.}; and his influence in Ulster was just as great as\r\nthe influence of Whitefield in England. He opened his Ulster campaign\r\nat Ballymena. At first he was fiercely opposed. As the rebellion of the\r\nyoung Pretender had been only recently quashed, the people were rather\r\nsuspicious of new comers. The Pretender himself was supposed to be\r\nstill at large, and the orthodox Presbyterians denounced Cennick as a\r\nCovenanter, a rebel, a spy, a rogue, a Jesuit, a plotter, a supporter\r\nof the Pretender, and a paid agent of the Pope. Again and again he was\r\naccused of Popery; and one Doffin, \"a vagabond and wicked fellow,\" swore\r\nbefore the Ballymena magistrates that, seven years before, he had seen\r\nCennick in the Isle of Man, and that there the preacher had fled from\r\nthe arm of the law. As Cennick was pronouncing the benediction at the\r\nclose of a service in the market-place at Ballymena, he was publicly\r\nassaulted by Captain Adair, the Lord of the Manor; and the Captain,\r\nwhose blood was inflamed with whisky, struck the preacher with his whip,\r\nattempted to run him through with his sword, and then instructed\r\nhis footman to knock him down. At another service, in a field near\r\nBallymena, two captains of militia had provided a band of drummers,\r\nand the drummers drummed as only Irishmen can. The young preacher was\r\nsummoned to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration. But Cennick,\r\nlike many Moravians, objected to taking an oath. The scene was the\r\nbar-parlour of a Ballymena hotel. There sat the justices, Captain Adair\r\nand O'Neil of Shane's Castle; and there sat Cennick, the meek Moravian,\r\nwith a few friends to support him. The more punch the two gentlemen put\r\naway the more pious and patriotic they became. For the second time\r\nAdair lost his self-control. He called Cennick a rascal, a rogue, and\r\na Jesuit; he drank damnation to all his principles; he asked him why\r\nhe would not swear and then get absolution from the Pope; and both\r\ngentlemen informed our hero that if he refused to take the oath they\r\nwould clap him in Carrickfergus Gaol that very night. As Cennick,\r\nhowever, still held to his point, they were compelled at last to let\r\nhim out on bail; and Cennick soon after appealed for protection to Dr.\r\nRider, Bishop of Down and Connor. The good Bishop was a broad-minded\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cennick,\" he said, \"you shall have fair play in my diocese.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the clergy complained to the Bishop that Cennick was emptying\r\ntheir pulpits. The Bishop had a stinging answer ready.\r\n\r\n\"Preach what Cennick preaches,\" he said, \"preach Christ crucified, and\r\nthen the people will not have to go to Cennick to hear the Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Bishop's words are instructive. At that time the Gospel which\r\nCennick preached was still a strange thing in Ulster; and Cennick\r\nwas welcomed as a true revival preacher. At Ballee and Ballynahone he\r\naddressed a crowd of ten thousand. At Moneymore the Presbyterians begged\r\nhim to be their minister. At Ballynahone the Catholics promised that if\r\nhe would only pitch his tent there they would never go to Mass again. At\r\nLisnamara, the rector invited him to preach in the parish church. At New\r\nMills the people rushed out from their cabins, barred his way, offered\r\nhim milk, and besought him, saying, \"If you cannot stop to preach, at\r\nleast come into our houses to pray.\" At Glenavy the road was lined with\r\na cheering multitude for full two miles. At Castle Dawson, Mr. Justice\r\nDowney, the local clergyman, and some other gentry, kissed him in public\r\nin the barrack yard. As he galloped along the country roads, the farm\r\nlabourers in the fields would call out after him, \"There goes Swaddling\r\nJack\"; he was known all over Ulster as \"the preacher\"; his fame ran on\r\nbefore him like a herald; Count Zinzendorf called him \"Paul Revived\";\r\nand his memory lingers down to the present day.\r\n\r\nFor Cennick, of course, was more than a popular orator. As he was now a\r\nminister of the Brethren's Church, he considered it his duty, wherever\r\npossible, to build chapels, to organize congregations, and to introduce\r\nMoravian books and customs; and in this work he had the assistance of\r\nLa Trobe, Symms, Caries, Cooke, Wade, Knight, Brampton, Pugh, Brown,\r\nThorne, Hill, Watson, and a host of other Brethren whose names need not\r\nbe mentioned. I have not mentioned the foregoing list for nothing. It\r\nshows that most of Cennick's assistants were not Germans, but Englishmen\r\nor Irishmen; and the people could not raise the objection that the\r\nBrethren were suspicious foreigners. At this time, in fact, the strength\r\nof the Brethren was enormous. At the close of his work, John Cennick\r\nhimself had built ten chapels, and established two hundred and twenty\r\nreligious societies. Around Lough Neagh the Brethren lay like locusts;\r\nand the work here was divided into four districts. At the north-east\r\ncorner they had four societies, with chapels at Ballymena, Gloonen,\r\nand Grogan, and a growing cause at Doagh; at the north-west corner, a\r\nsociety at Lisnamara, established later as a congregation at Gracefield;\r\nat the south-west corner, in Co. Armagh, three chapels were being built;\r\nand at the south-east corner, they had several societies, and had built,\r\nor were building, chapels at Ballinderry, Glenavy, and Kilwarlin.\r\n\r\nAt this distance of time the Brethren's work in Ulster has about it a\r\ncertain glamour of romance. But in reality the conditions were far from\r\nattractive. It is hard for us to realize now how poor those Irish people\r\nwere. They lived in hovels made of loose sods, with no chimneys; they\r\nshared their wretched rooms with hens and pigs; and toiling all day in\r\na damp atmosphere, they earned their bread by weaving and spinning. The\r\nBrethren themselves were little better off. At Gloonen, a small village\r\nnear Gracehill, the Brethren of the first Lough Neagh district made\r\ntheir headquarters in a cottage consisting of two rooms and two\r\nsmall \"closets\"; and this modest abode of one story was known in the\r\nneighbourhood as \"The Great House at Gloonen.\" Again, at a Conference\r\nheld in Gracehill, the Brethren, being pinched for money, solemnly\r\npassed a resolution never to drink tea more than once a day.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is little to show to-day for these heroic labours. If\r\nthe visitor goes to Ulster now and endeavours to trace the footsteps\r\nof Cennick, he will find it almost impossible to realize how great\r\nthe power of the Brethren was in those palmy days. At Gracehill, near\r\nBallymena, he will find the remains of a settlement. At Ballymena\r\nitself, now a growing town, he will find to his surprise that the\r\nBrethren's cause has ceased to exist. At Gracefield, Ballinderry, and\r\nKilwarlin--where once Cennick preached to thousands--he will find but\r\nfeeble, struggling congregations. At Gloonen the people will show him\r\n\"Cennick's Well\"; at Kilwarlin he may stand under \"Cennick's Tree\"; and\r\nat Portmore, near Lough Beg, he will see the ruins of the old church,\r\nwhere Jeremy Taylor wrote his \"Holy Living and Holy Dying,\" and where\r\nCennick slept many a night. At Drumargan (Armagh), he will find a barn\r\nthat was once a Moravian Chapel, and a small farmhouse that was once\r\na Sisters' House; and at Arva (Co. Cavan), he may stand on a hillock,\r\nstill called \"Mount Waugh,\" in memory of Joseph Waugh, a Moravian\r\nminister. For the rest, however, the work has collapsed; and Cennick's\r\ntwo hundred and twenty societies have left not a rack behind.\r\n\r\nFor this decline there were three causes. The first was financial. At\r\nthe very time when the Brethren in Ulster had obtained a firm hold upon\r\nthe affections of the people the Moravian Church was passing through\r\na financial crisis; and thus, when money would have been most useful,\r\nmoney was not to be had. The second was the bad system of management.\r\nAgain, as in Yorkshire and Wiltshire, the Brethren pursued the system\r\nof centralization; built a settlement at Gracehill, and made the\r\nother congregations dependent on Gracehill, just as the Yorkshire\r\ncongregations were dependent on Fulneck. The third cause was the early\r\ndeath of Cennick himself. At the height of his powers he broke down in\r\nbody and in mind; and, worn out with many labours, he became the victim\r\nof mental depression. For some time the conviction had been stealing\r\nupon him that his work in this world was over; and in a letter to John\r\nde Watteville, who had twice inspected the Irish work, he said, \"I think\r\nI have finished with the North of Ireland. If I stay here much longer\r\nI fear I shall damage His work.\" At length, as he rode from Holyhead\r\nto London, he was taken seriously ill; and arrived at Fetter Lane in\r\na state of high fever and exhaustion. For a week he lay delirious and\r\nrambling, in the room which is now used as the Vestry of the Moravian\r\nChapel; and there, at the early age of thirty-six, he died {July 4th,\r\n1755.}. If the true success is to labour, Cennick was successful; but if\r\nsuccess is measured by visible results, he ended his brief and brilliant\r\ncareer in tragedy, failure and gloom. Of all the great preachers of the\r\neighteenth century, not one was superior to him in beauty of character.\r\nBy the poor in Ireland he was almost worshipped. He was often attacked\r\nand unjustly accused; but he never attacked in return. We search his\r\ndiary and letters in vain for one single trace of bitter feeling. He was\r\ninferior to John Wesley in organizing skill, and inferior to Whitefield\r\nin dramatic power; but in devotion, in simplicity, and in command over\r\nhis audience he was equal to either. At the present time he is chiefly\r\nknown in this country as the author of the well-known grace before\r\nmeat, \"Be present at our table, Lord\"; and some of his hymns, such as\r\n\"Children of the Heavenly King,\" and \"Ere I sleep, for every favour,\"\r\nare now regarded as classics. His position in the Moravian Church was\r\npeculiar. Of all the English Brethren he did the most to extend the\r\ncause of the Moravian Church in the United Kingdom, and no fewer than\r\nfifteen congregations owed their existence, directly or indirectly, to\r\nhis efforts; and yet, despite his shining gifts, he was never promoted\r\nto any position of special responsibility or honour. He was never placed\r\nin sole charge of a congregation; and he was not made superintendent of\r\nthe work in Ireland. As a soldier in the ranks he began; as a soldier in\r\nthe ranks he died. He had one blemish in his character. He was far too\r\nfond, like most of the Brethren, of overdrawn sentimental language. If\r\na man could read Zinzendorf's \"Litany of the Wounds of Jesus,\" and then\r\nshed tears of joy, as Cennick tells us he did himself, there must have\r\nbeen an unhealthy taint in his blood. He was present at Herrnhaag at\r\nthe Sifting-Time, and does not appear to have been shocked. In time\r\nhis sentimentalism made him morbid. As he had a wife and two children\r\ndependent on him, he had no right to long for an early death; and yet he\r\nwrote the words in his pocket-book:--\r\n\r\n   Now, Lord, at peace with Thee and all below,\r\n   Let me depart, and to Thy Kingdom go.\r\n\r\nFor this blemish, however, he was more to be pitied than blamed. It was\r\npartly the result of ill-health and overwork; and, on the whole, it was\r\nmerely a trifle when set beside that winsome grace, that unselfish zeal,\r\nthat modest devotion, and that sunny piety, which charmed alike the\r\nWiltshire peasants, the Papist boys of Dublin, and the humble weavers\r\nand spinners of the North of Ireland.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. -- THE APPEAL TO PARLIAMENT, 1742-1749.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the Brethren in England had been bitterly opposed.\r\nFor this there were several reasons. First, the leading Brethren in\r\nEngland were Germans; and that fact alone was quite enough to prejudice\r\nthe multitude against them {1742-3.}. For Germans our fathers had then\r\nbut little liking; they had a German King on the throne, and they did\r\nnot love him; and the general feeling in the country was that if a man\r\nwas a foreigner he was almost sure to be a conspirator or a traitor. Who\r\nwere these mysterious foreigners? asked the patriotic Briton. Who were\r\nthese \"Moravians,\" these \"Herrnhuters,\" these \"Germans,\" these \"Quiet in\r\nthe Land,\" these \"Antinomians\"? The very names of the Brethren aroused\r\nthe popular suspicion. If a man could prove that his name was John\r\nSmith, the presumption was that John Smith was a loyal citizen; but if\r\nhe was known as Gussenbauer or Ockershausen, he was probably another Guy\r\nFawkes, and was forming a plot to blow up the House of Commons. At\r\nthe outset therefore the Brethren were accused of treachery. At Pudsey\r\nGussenbauer was arrested, tried at Wakefield, and imprisoned in York\r\nCastle. At Broadoaks, in Essex, the Brethren had opened a school, and\r\nwere soon accused of being agents of the Young Pretender. They had, it\r\nwas said, stored up barrels of gunpowder; they had undermined the whole\r\nneighbourhood, and intended to set the town of Thaxted on fire. At three\r\no'clock one afternoon a mob surrounded the building, and tried in vain\r\nto force their way in. Among them were a sergeant and a corporal. The\r\nwarden, Metcalfe, admitted the officers, showed them round the house,\r\nand finally led them to a room where a Bible and Prayer-book were lying\r\non the table. At this sight the officers collapsed in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" said the corporal, \"this is proof enough that you are no Papists;\r\nif you were, this book would not have lain here.\"\r\n\r\nAnother cause of opposition was the Brethren's quiet mode of work. In\r\nNorth America lived a certain Gilbert Tennent; he had met Zinzendorf at\r\nNew Brunswick; he had read his Berlin discourses; and now, in order to\r\nshow the public what a dangerous teacher Zinzendorf was, he published\r\na book, entitled, \"Some Account of the Principles of the Moravians.\"\r\n{1743.} As this book was published at Boston, it did not at first do\r\nmuch harm to the English Brethren; but, after a time, a copy found\r\nits way to England; an English edition was published; and the English\r\neditor, in a preface, accused the Brethren of many marvellous crimes.\r\nThey persistently refused, he declared, to reveal their real opinions.\r\nThey crept into houses and led captive silly women. They claimed that\r\nall Moravians were perfect, and taught that the Moravian Church was\r\ninfallible. They practised an adventurous use of the Lot, had a curious\r\nmethod of discovering and purging out the accursed thing, pledged each\r\nother in liquor at their love-feasts, and had an \"artful regulation\r\nof their convents.\" Above all, said this writer, the Moravians were\r\ntyrannical. As soon as any person joined the Moravian Church, he was\r\ncompelled to place himself, his family, and his estates entirely at the\r\nChurch's disposal; he was bound to believe what the Church believed,\r\nand to do what the Church commanded; he handed his children over to the\r\nChurch's care; he could not enter into any civil contract without the\r\nChurch's consent; and his sons and daughters were given in marriage just\r\nas the Church decreed.[123] Gilbert Tennent himself was equally severe.\r\nHe began by criticizing Zinzendorf's theology; and after remarking that\r\nZinzendorf was a liar, he said that the Brethren kept their disgusting\r\nprinciples secret, that they despised good books, that they slighted\r\nlearning and reason, that they spoke lightly of Confessions of Faith,\r\nthat they insinuated themselves into people's affections by smiles and\r\nsoft discourses about the love of Christ, that they took special care to\r\napply to young persons, females and ignorant people. From all this the\r\nconclusion was obvious. At heart the Brethren were Roman Catholics. \"The\r\nMoravians,\" said Gilbert, \"by this method of proceeding, are propagating\r\nanother damnable doctrine of the Church of Rome, namely, that Ignorance\r\nis the Mother of Devotion.\" We can imagine the effect of this in\r\nProtestant England. At one time Zinzendorf was openly accused in\r\nthe columns of the Universal Spectator of kidnapping young women for\r\nMoravian convents; and the alarming rumour spread on all sides that the\r\nBrethren were Papists in disguise.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of trouble was the Moravian religious language. If the\r\nBrethren did not preach novel doctrines they certainly preached old\r\ndoctrines in a novel way. They called Jesus the Man of Smart; talked a\r\ngreat deal about Blood and Wounds; spoke of themselves as Poor Sinners;\r\nand described their own condition as Sinnership and Sinnerlikeness. To\r\nthe orthodox Churchman this language seemed absurd. He did not know what\r\nit meant; he did not find it in the Bible; and, therefore, he concluded\r\nthat the Brethren's doctrine was unscriptural and unsound.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of trouble was the Brethren's doctrine of justification\r\nby faith alone. Of all the charges brought against them the most serious\r\nand the most persistent was the charge that they despised good works.\r\nThey were denounced as Antinomians. Again and again, by the best of men,\r\nthis insulting term was thrown at their heads. They taught, it was said,\r\nthe immoral doctrine that Christ had done everything for the salvation\r\nof mankind; that the believer had only to believe; that he need not\r\nobey the commandments; and that such things as duties did not exist.\r\nAt Windsor lived a gentleman named Sir John Thorold. He was one of the\r\nearliest friends of the Moravians; he had often attended meetings at\r\nHutton's house; he was an upright, conscientious, intelligent Christian;\r\nand yet he accused the Brethren of teaching \"that there were no duties\r\nin the New Testament.\" Gilbert Tennent brought the very same accusation.\r\n\"The Moravian notion about the law,\" he said, \"is a mystery of\r\ndetestable iniquity; and, indeed, this seems to be the mainspring of\r\ntheir unreasonable, anti-evangelical, and licentious religion.\" But the\r\nseverest critic of the Brethren was John Wesley. He attacked them in\r\na \"Letter to the Moravian Church,\" and had that letter printed in his\r\nJournal. He attacked them again in his \"Short View of the Difference\r\nbetween the Moravian Brethren, lately in England, and the Rev. Mr. John\r\nand Charles Wesley.\" He attacked them again in his \"A Dialogue between\r\nan Antinomian and his Friend\"; and in each of these clever and\r\nbiting productions his chief charge against them was that they taught\r\nAntinomian principles, despised good works, and taught that Christians\r\nhad nothing to do but believe.\r\n\r\n\"Do you coolly affirm,\" he asked, \"that this is only imputed to a\r\nBeliever, and that he has none at all of this holiness in him? Is\r\ntemperance imputed only to him that is a drunkard still? or chastity to\r\nher that goes on in whoredom?\"\r\n\r\nHe accused the Brethren of carrying out their principles; he attacked\r\ntheir personal character; and, boiling with righteous indignation, he\r\ndenounced them as \"licentious spirits and men of careless lives.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Brethren, therefore, were now being fiercely attacked, the\r\nquestion arose, what measures, if any, they should take in self-defence.\r\nAt first they contented themselves with gentle protests. As they had\r\nbeen accused of disloyalty to the throne, James Hutton, Benjamin Ingham,\r\nand William Bell, in the name of all the English societies connected\r\nwith the Brethren's Church, drew up an address to the King, went to see\r\nhim in person, and assured him that they were loyal subjects and hated\r\nPopery and popish pretenders {April 27th, 1744.}. As they had been\r\naccused of attacking the Anglican Church, two Brethren called on Gibson,\r\nBishop of London, and assured him that they had committed no such crime.\r\nFor the rest, however, the Brethren held their tongues. At a Conference\r\nin London they consulted the Lot; and the Lot decided that they should\r\nnot reply to Gilbert Tennent. For the same reason, probably, they also\r\ndecided to give no reply to John Wesley.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, an event occurred which roused the Brethren to\r\naction. At Shekomeko, in Dutchess County, New York, they had established\r\na flourishing Indian congregation; and now, the Assembly of New York,\r\nstirred up by some liquor sellers who were losing their business, passed\r\nan insulting Act, declaring that \"all vagrant preachers, Moravians,\r\nand disguised Papists,\" should not be allowed to preach to the Indians\r\nunless they first took the oaths of allegiance and abjuration {1744.}.\r\nJames Hutton was boiling with fury. If this Act had applied to all\r\npreachers of the Gospel he would not have minded so much; but the\r\nother denominations--Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists and\r\nQuakers--were all specially exempted; and the loyal Moravians were\r\nbracketed together with vagrant preachers and Papists in disguise. He\r\nregarded the Act as an insult. He wrote to Zinzendorf on the subject.\r\n\"This,\" he said, \"is the work of Presbyterian firebrands.\" If an Act\r\nlike this could be passed in America, who knew what might not happen\r\nsoon in England? \"We ought,\" he continued, \"to utilize this or some\r\nother favourable opportunity for bringing our cause publicly before\r\nParliament.\"\r\n\r\nNow was the time, thought the fiery Hutton, to define the position\r\nof the Brethren's Church in England. He went to Marienborn to see the\r\nCount; a Synod met {1745.}; his proposal was discussed; and the Synod\r\nappointed Abraham von Gersdorf, the official \"Delegate to Kings,\" to\r\nappeal to Lord Granville, and the Board of Trade and Plantations, for\r\nprotection in the Colonies. Lord Granville was gracious. He informed the\r\ndeputation that though the Act could not be repealed at once the Board\r\nof Trade would recommend the repeal as soon as legally possible; and the\r\nupshot of the matter was that the Act became a dead letter.\r\n\r\nNext year Zinzendorf came to England, and began to do the best he could\r\nto destroy the separate Moravian Church in this country {1746.}. If the\r\nCount could only have had his way, he would now have made every Moravian\r\nin England return to the Anglican Church. He was full of his \"Tropus\"\r\nidea. He wished to work his idea out in England; he called the English\r\nBrethren to a Synod (Sept. 13-16), and persuaded them to pass a scheme\r\nwhereby the English branch of the Brethren's Church would be taken\r\nover entirely by the Church of England. It was one of the most\r\ncurious schemes he ever devised. At their Sunday services the Brethren\r\nhenceforward were to use the Book of Common Prayer; their ministers were\r\nto be ordained by Anglican and Moravian Bishops conjointly; he himself\r\nwas to be the head of this Anglican-Moravian Church; and thus the\r\nEnglish Moravians would be grafted on to the Church of England. For the\r\nsecond time, therefore, the Count was trying to destroy the Moravian\r\nChurch. But here, to his surprise, he met an unexpected obstacle. He had\r\nforgotten that it takes two to make a marriage. He proposed the union in\r\nform to Archbishop Potter; he pleaded the case with all the skill at\r\nhis command; and the Archbishop promptly rejected the proposal, and the\r\nmarriage never came off.\r\n\r\nAs Zinzendorf, therefore, was baffled in this endeavour, he had now to\r\ncome down from his pedestal and try a more practical plan {1747.}; and,\r\nacting on the sage advice of Thomas Penn, proprietor of Pennsylvania,\r\nand General Oglethorpe, Governor of Georgia, he resolved to appeal\r\ndirect to Parliament for protection in the Colonies. As Oglethorpe\r\nhimself was a member of the House of Commons, he was able to render the\r\nBrethren signal service. He had no objection to fighting himself, and\r\neven defended duelling,[124] but he championed the cause of the Brethren.\r\nAlready, by an Act in 1740, the Quakers had been freed from taking the\r\noath in all our American Colonies; already, further, by another Act\r\n(1743), the privilege of affirming had been granted in Pennsylvania,\r\nnot only to Quakers, but to all foreign Protestants; and now Oglethorpe\r\nmoved in the House of Commons that the rule existing in Pennsylvania\r\nshould henceforth apply to all American Colonies. If the Moravians, he\r\nargued, were only given a little more encouragement, instead of being\r\nworried about oaths and military service, they would settle in larger\r\nnumbers in America and increase the prosperity of the colonies. He wrote\r\nto the Board of Trade and Plantations; his friend, Thomas Penn, endorsed\r\nhis statements; and the result was that the new clause was passed,\r\nand all foreign Protestants in American Colonies--the Moravians being\r\nspecially mentioned--were free to affirm instead of taking the oath.\r\n\r\nBut this Act was of no use to the English Brethren. The great question\r\nat issue was, what standing were the Brethren to hold in England? On the\r\none hand, as members of a foreign Protestant Church they were entitled\r\nto religious liberty; and yet, on the other hand, they were practically\r\ntreated as Dissenters, and had been compelled to have all their\r\nbuildings licensed. As they were still accused of holding secret\r\ndangerous principles, they now drew up another \"Declaration,\" had it\r\nprinted, sent it to the offices of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the\r\nLord Chancellor, and the Master of the Rolls, and inserted it in the\r\nleading newspapers. At all costs, pleaded the Brethren, let us have a\r\npublic inquiry. \"If any man of undoubted sense and candour,\" they said,\r\n\"will take the pains upon himself to fix the accusations against us\r\nin their real point of view, hitherto unattainable by the Brethren and\r\nperhaps the public too, then we will answer to the expectations of the\r\npublic, as free and directly as may be expected from honest subjects of\r\nthe constitution of these realms.\" The appeal led to nothing; the man\r\nof sense and candour never appeared; and still the suffering Brethren\r\ngroaned under all sorts of vague accusation.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Zinzendorf himself came to the rescue of his Brethren,\r\nrented Northampton House in Bloomsbury Square,[125] and brought the whole\r\nmatter to a head. For the second time he took the advice of Oglethorpe\r\nand Thomas Penn; and a deputation was now appointed to frame a petition\r\nto Parliament that the Brethren in America be exempted, not merely from\r\nthe oath, but also from military service.\r\n\r\nAs General Oglethorpe was now in England, he gladly championed the\r\nBrethren's cause, presented the petition in the House of Commons, and\r\nopened the campaign by giving an account of the past history of the\r\nBrethren {Feb. 20th, 1749.}. For practical purposes this information\r\nwas important. If the House knew nothing else about the Brethren it knew\r\nthat they were no sect of mushroom growth. And then Oglethorpe informed\r\nthe House how the Brethren, already, in bygone days had been kindly\r\ntreated by England; how Amos Comenius had appealed to the Anglican\r\nChurch; how Archbishop Sancroft and Bishop Compton had published a\r\npathetic account of their sufferings; and how George I., by the advice\r\nof Archbishop Wake, had issued letters patent for their relief. But the\r\nmost effective part of his speech was the part in which he spoke from\r\npersonal knowledge. \"In the year 1735,\" he said \"they were disquieted\r\nin Germany, and about twenty families went over with me to Georgia. They\r\nwere industrious, patient under the difficulties of a new settlement,\r\nlaborious beyond what could have been expected. They gave much of their\r\ntime to prayer, but that hindered not their industry. Prayer was to them\r\na diversion after labour. I mention this because a vulgar notion has\r\nprevailed that they neglected labour for prayer.\" They had spent, he\r\nsaid, £100,000 in various industries; they had withdrawn already in\r\nlarge numbers from Georgia because they were compelled to bear arms; and\r\nif that colony was to prosper again the Brethren should be granted the\r\nprivilege they requested, and thus be encouraged to return. For what\r\nprivilege, after all, did the Brethren ask? For the noble privilege of\r\npaying money instead of fighting in battle. The more these Brethren were\r\nencouraged, said he, the more the Colonies would prosper; he proposed\r\nthat the petition be referred to a Committee, and Velters Cornwall,\r\nmember for Herefordshire, seconded the motion.\r\n\r\nAs Zinzendorf listened to this speech, some curious feelings must have\r\nsurged in his bosom. At the Synod of Hirschberg, only six years\r\nbefore, he had lectured the Brethren for making business bargains with\r\nGovernments; and now he was consenting to such a bargain himself.\r\nThe debate in the Commons was conducted on business lines; the whole\r\nquestion at issue was, not whether the Moravians were orthodox, but\r\nwhether it would pay the Government to encourage them; and the British\r\nGovernment took exactly the same attitude towards the Brethren that\r\nFrederick the Great had done seven years before. The next speaker made\r\nthis point clearer than ever. We are not quite sure who it was. It was\r\nprobably Henry Pelham, the Prime Minister. At any rate, whoever it was,\r\nhe objected to the petition on practical grounds. He declared that the\r\nMoravians were a very dangerous body; that they were really a new sect;\r\nthat, like the Papists, they had a Pope, and submitted to their Pope in\r\nall things; that they made their Church supreme in temporal matters; and\r\nthat thus they destroyed the power of the civil magistrate. He suspected\r\nthat the Brethren were Papists in disguise.\r\n\r\n\"I am at a loss,\" he said, \"whether I shall style the petitioners\r\nJesuits, Papists, or Moravians.\"\r\n\r\nHe intended, he declared, to move an amendment that the Moravians be\r\nrestrained from making converts, and that all who joined their ranks be\r\npunished. The fate of England was at stake. If the Moravians converted\r\nthe whole nation to their superstition, and everyone objected to bearing\r\narms, what then would become of our Army and Navy, and how could we\r\nresist invasion? The next speakers, however, soon toned down the alarm.\r\nIf Pelham's objections applied to the Moravians, they would apply, it\r\nwas argued, equally to the Quakers; and yet it was a notorious fact that\r\nthe Colonies where the Quakers settled were the most prosperous places\r\nin the Empire. \"What place,\" asked one, \"is more flourishing than\r\nPennsylvania?\" And if the Moravians objected to bearing arms, what did\r\nthat matter, so long as they were willing to pay?\r\n\r\nFor these practical reasons, therefore, the motion was easily carried;\r\na Parliamentary Committee was formed; General Oglethorpe was elected\r\nchairman; and the whole history, doctrine and practice of the Brethren\r\nwere submitted to a thorough investigation. For this purpose Zinzendorf\r\nhad prepared a number of documents; the documents were laid before the\r\nCommittee; and, on the evidence of those documents, the Committee based\r\nits report. From that evidence three conclusions followed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Brethren were able to show, by documents of\r\nincontestable authenticity, that they really were the true descendants\r\nof the old Church of the Brethren. They could prove that Daniel Ernest\r\nJablonsky had been consecrated a Bishop at the Synod of Lissa (March\r\n10th, 1699), that Jablonsky in turn had consecrated Zinzendorf a Bishop,\r\nand that thus the Brethren had preserved the old Moravian episcopal\r\nsuccession. They could prove, further, and prove they did, that\r\nArchbishops Wake and Potter had both declared that the Moravian\r\nepiscopacy was genuine; that Potter had described the Moravian Brethren\r\nas apostolical and episcopal; and that when Zinzendorf was made a\r\nBishop, Potter himself had written him a letter of congratulation.\r\nWith such evidence, therefore, as this before them, the Committee were\r\nconvinced of the genuineness of the Moravian episcopal succession; and\r\nwhen they issued their report they gave due weight to the point.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Brethren were able to show that they had\r\nno sectarian motives, and that though they believed in their own\r\nepiscopacy, they had no desire to compete with the Church of England.\r\n\"There are,\" they said, \"no more than two episcopal Churches among\r\nProtestants: the one known through all the world under the name of\r\nEcclesia Anglicana; the other characterised for at least three ages as\r\nthe Unitas Fratrum, comprehending generally all other Protestants who\r\nchoose episcopal constitution. The first is the only one which may\r\njustly claim the title of a national church, because she has at her\r\nhead a Christian King of the same rite, which circumstance is absolutely\r\nrequired to constitute a national church. The other episcopal one, known\r\nby the name of Unitas Fratrum, is far from pretending to that title.\" In\r\nthat manifesto the Brethren assumed that their episcopal orders were\r\non a par with those of the Church of England; and that assumption was\r\naccepted, without the slightest demur, not only by the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, but by the bench of Bishops.\r\n\r\nIn the third place--and this was the crucial point--the Brethren were\r\nable to show, by the written evidence of local residents, that wherever\r\nthey went they made honest, industrious citizens. They had settled\r\ndown in Pennsylvania; they had done good work at Bethlehem, Nazareth,\r\nGnadenhütten, Frederick's Town, German Town and Oley; they had won the\r\nwarm approval of Thomas Penn; and, so far from being traitors, they had\r\ndone their best to teach the Indians to be loyal to the British throne.\r\nThey had doubled the value of an estate in Lusatia, and had built two\r\nflourishing settlements in Silesia; they had taught the negroes in the\r\nWest Indies to be sober, industrious and law-abiding; they had tried to\r\nuplift the poor Hottentots in South Africa; they had begun a mission in\r\nCeylon, had toiled in plague-stricken Algiers, and had built settlements\r\nfor the Eskimos in Greenland. If these statements had been made by\r\nMoravians, the Committee might have doubted their truth, but in every\r\ninstance the evidence came, not from Brethren themselves, but from\r\ngovernors, kings and trading officials. The proof was overwhelming.\r\nWherever the Brethren went, they did good work. They promoted trade;\r\nthey enriched the soul; they taught the people to be both good and\r\nloyal; and, therefore, the sooner they were encouraged in America, the\r\nbetter for the British Empire.\r\n\r\nAs the Committee, therefore, were compelled by the evidence to bring\r\nin a good report, the desired leave was granted to bring in a bill\r\n\"for encouraging the people known by the name of the Unitas Fratrum, or\r\nUnited Brethren, to settle in His Majesty's Colonies in America.\" Its\r\nreal purpose, however, was to recognize the Brethren's Church as an\r\nancient Protestant Episcopal Church, not only in the American Colonies,\r\nbut also in the United Kingdom; and its provisions were to be in force\r\nwherever the British flag might fly. The provisions were generous.\r\nFirst, in the preamble, the Brethren were described as \"an ancient\r\nProtestant Episcopal Church and a sober and quiet industrious people,\"\r\nand, being such, were hereby encouraged to settle in the American\r\nColonies. Next, in response to their own request, they were allowed\r\nto affirm instead of taking the oath. The form of affirmation was as\r\nfollows: \"I, A. B., do declare in the presence of Almighty God the\r\nwitness of the truth of what I say.\" Next, they were allowed to pay a\r\nfixed sum instead of rendering military service, and were also exempted\r\nfrom serving on juries in criminal cases. Next, all members of the\r\nBrethren's Church were to prove their claims by producing a certificate,\r\nsigned by a Moravian Bishop or pastor. Next, the advocate of the\r\nBrethren was to supply the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations with\r\na complete list of Moravian bishops and pastors, together with their\r\nhandwriting and seal; and, finally, anyone who falsely claimed to belong\r\nto the Brethren's Church was to be punished as a wilful perjurer.\r\n\r\nThe first reading was on March 28th, and the passage through the House\r\nof Commons was smooth. At the second reading, on April 1st, General\r\nOglethorpe was asked to explain why the privilege of affirming should be\r\nextended to Moravians in Great Britain and Ireland. Why not confine it\r\nto the American colonies? His answer was convincing. If the privilege,\r\nhe said, were confined to America, it would be no privilege at all. At\r\nthat time all cases tried in America could be referred to an English\r\nCourt of Appeal. If the privilege, therefore, were confined to America,\r\nthe Brethren would be constantly hampered by vexatious appeals to\r\nEngland; and an English Court might at any moment upset the decision of\r\nan American Court. The explanation was accepted; the third reading came\r\non; and the Bill passed the House of Commons unaltered.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords there was a little more opposition. As the\r\nBrethren were described as an \"Episcopal Church,\" it was feared that the\r\nBishops might raise an objection; but the Bishops met at Lambeth Palace,\r\nand resolved not to oppose. At first Dr. Sherlock, Bishop of London,\r\nobjected; but even he gave way in the end, and when the Bill came before\r\nthe Lords not a single Bishop raised his voice against it. The only\r\nBishop who spoke was Maddox, of Worcester, and he spoke in the name of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\"Our Moravian Brethren,\" he said, \"are an ancient Episcopal Church. Of\r\nall Protestants, they come the nearest to the Established Church in this\r\nkingdom in their doctrine and constitution. And though the enemy has\r\npersecuted them from several quarters, the soundness of their faith and\r\nthe purity of their morals have defended them from any imputation of\r\nPopery and immorality.\"\r\n\r\nThe one dangerous opponent was Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. He objected\r\nto the clause about the certificate. If a man wished to prove himself a\r\nMoravian, let him do so by bringing witnesses. What use was a Bishop's\r\ncertificate? It would not be accepted by any judge in the country.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lord Granville, in a genial speech, spoke highly of\r\nthe Brethren. As some members were still afraid that the whole country\r\nmight become Moravians, and refuse to defend our land against her foes,\r\nhe dismissed their fears by an anecdote about a Quaker. At one time,\r\nhe said, in the days of his youth, the late famous admiral, Sir Charles\r\nWager, had been mate on a ship commanded by a Quaker; and on one\r\noccasion the ship was attacked by a French privateer. What, then, did\r\nthe Quaker captain do? Instead of fighting the privateer himself, he\r\ngave over the command to Wager, captured the privateer, and made his\r\nfortune. But the Brethren, he held, were even broader minded than the\r\nQuakers.\r\n\r\n\"I may compare them,\" he said, \"to a casting-net over all Christendom,\r\nto enclose all denominations of Christians. If you like episcopacy, they\r\nhave it; if you choose the Presbytery of Luther or Calvin, they have\r\nthat also; and if you are pleased with Quakerism, they have something of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nWith this speech Zinzendorf was delighted. As the little difficulty\r\nabout the certificate had not yet been cleared away, he suggested that\r\nthe person bringing the certificate should bring witnesses as well; and\r\nwith this trifling amendment the Bill at last--on May 12th, the Moravian\r\nMemorial Day--was carried without a division.\r\n\r\nIn one sense this Act was a triumph for the Brethren, and yet it\r\nscarcely affected their fortunes in England. Its interest is national\r\nrather than Moravian. It was a step in the history of religious\r\ntoleration, and the great principle it embodied was that a religious\r\nbody is entitled to freedom on the ground of its usefulness to the\r\nState. The principle is one of the deepest importance. It is the\r\nfundamental principle to-day of religious liberty in England. But the\r\nBrethren themselves reaped very little benefit. With the exception\r\nof their freedom from the oath and from military service, they still\r\noccupied the same position as before the Act was passed. We come here to\r\none of those contradictions which are the glory of all legal systems.\r\nOn the one hand, by Act of Parliament, they were declared an Episcopal\r\nChurch, and could hardly, therefore, be regarded as Dissenters; on\r\nthe other, they were treated as Dissenters still, and still had their\r\nchurches licensed as \"places of worship for the use of Protestant\r\nDissenters.\"[126]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. -- THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS, 1749-1755.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Act of Parliament was passed, and the settlement at\r\nHerrnhaag had been broken up, the Count resolved that the headquarters\r\nof the Brethren's Church should henceforward be in London; and to this\r\nintent he now leased a block of buildings at Chelsea, known as Lindsey\r\nHouse. The great house, in altered form, is standing still. It is at the\r\ncorner of Cheyne Walk and Beaufort Street, and is close to the Thames\r\nEmbankment. It had once belonged to Sir Thomas More, and also to the\r\nducal family of Ancaster. The designs of Zinzendorf were ambitious. He\r\nleased the adjoining Beaufort grounds and gardens, spent £12,000 on the\r\nproperty, had the house remodelled in grandiose style, erected, close\r\nby, the \"Clock\" chapel and a minister's house, laid out a cemetery,\r\nknown to this day as \"Sharon,\" and thus made preliminary arrangements\r\nfor the establishment in Chelsea of a Moravian settlement in full\r\nworking order. In those days Chelsea was a charming London suburb. From\r\nthe house to the river side lay a terrace, used as a grand parade; from\r\nthe bank to the water there ran a short flight of steps; and from there\r\nthe pleasure-boats, with banners flying, took trippers up and down the\r\nshining river. For five years this Paradise was the headquarters of the\r\nBrethren's Church. There, in grand style, lived the Count himself, with\r\nthe members of his Pilgrim Band; there the Brethren met in conference;\r\nthere the archives of the Church were preserved; and there letters and\r\nreports were received from all parts of the rapidly extending mission\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Count led a new campaign in England. As debates in\r\nParliament were not then published in full, it was always open for an\r\nenemy to say that the Brethren had obtained their privileges by means\r\nof some underhand trick; and in order to give this charge the lie, the\r\nCount now published a folio volume, entitled, \"Acta Fratrum Unitatis in\r\nAnglia.\" In this volume he took the bull by the horns. He issued it by\r\nthe advice of Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man. It was a thorough and\r\ncomprehensive treatise, and contained all about the Moravians that an\r\nhonest and inquiring Briton would need to know. The first part consisted\r\nof the principal vouchers that had been examined by the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee. The next was an article, \"The Whole System of the Twenty-one\r\nDoctrinal Articles of the Confession of Augsburg\"; and here the Brethren\r\nset forth their doctrinal beliefs in detail. The next article was \"The\r\nBrethren's Method of Preaching the Gospel, according to the Synod of\r\nBern, 1532\"; and here they explained why they preached so much about\r\nthe Person and sufferings of Christ. The next article was a series of\r\nextracts from the minutes of German Synods; and here the Brethren showed\r\nwhat they meant by such phrases as \"Sinnership\" and \"Blood and Wounds\r\nTheology.\" But the cream of the volume was Zinzendorf's treatise, \"The\r\nRationale of the Brethren's Liturgies.\" He explained why the Brethren\r\nspoke so freely on certain moral matters, and contended that while\r\nthey had sometimes used language which prudish people might condemn as\r\nindecent, they had done so from the loftiest motives, and had always\r\nmaintained among themselves a high standard of purity. At the close\r\nof the volume was the Brethren's \"Church Litany,\" revised by Sherlock,\r\nBishop of London, a glossary of their religious terms, and a pathetic\r\nrequest that if the reader was not satisfied yet he should ask for\r\nfurther information. The volume was a challenge to the public. It was an\r\nhonest manifesto of the Brethren's principles, a declaration that they\r\nhad nothing to conceal, and a challenge to their enemies to do their\r\nworst.\r\n\r\nThe next task of Zinzendorf was to comfort the Brethren's friends. At\r\nthis period, while Zinzendorf was resident in London, the whole cause\r\nof the Brethren in England was growing at an amazing pace; and\r\nin Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Bedfordshire, Cheshire, Wiltshire,\r\nGloucestershire, Dublin, and the North of Ireland, the members of\r\nthe numerous societies and preaching places were clamouring for full\r\nadmission to the Moravian Church. They assumed a very natural attitude.\r\nOn the one hand, they wanted to become Moravians; on the other, they\r\nobjected to the system of discipline enforced so strictly in the\r\nsettlements, and contended that though it might suit in Germany, it\r\nwas not fit for independent Britons. But Zinzendorf gave a clear and\r\ncrushing answer. For the benefit of all good Britons who wished to join\r\nthe Moravian Church without accepting the Moravian discipline, he issued\r\nwhat he called a \"Consolatory Letter\";[127] and the consolation that he\r\ngave them was that he could not consider their arguments for a\r\nmoment. He informed them that the Brethren's rules were so strict that\r\ncandidates could only be received with caution; that the Brethren had\r\nno desire to disturb those whose outward mode of religion was already\r\nfixed; that they lived in a mystical communion with Christ which others\r\nmight not understand; and, finally, that they refused point-blank to\r\nrob the other Churches of their members, and preferred to act \"as a\r\nseasonable assistant in an irreligious age, and as a most faithful\r\nservant to the other Protestant Churches.\" Thus were the society members\r\nblackballed; and thus did Zinzendorf prove in England that, with all his\r\nfaults, he was never a schismatic or a poacher on others' preserves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the battle of the books had begun. The first blow was struck\r\nby John Wesley. For the last seven years--as his Journal shows--he had\r\nseen but little of the Brethren, and was, therefore, not in a position\r\nto pass a fair judgment on their conduct; but, on the other hand, he\r\nhad seen no reason to alter his old opinion, and still regarded them as\r\nwicked Antinomians. The Act of Parliament aroused his anger. He obtained\r\na copy of Zinzendorf's Acta Fratrum, and published a pamphlet[128] summarizing its contents, with characteristic comments of his own\r\n{1750.}. He signed himself \"A Lover of the Light.\" His pamphlet was a\r\nfierce attack upon the Brethren. The very evidence that had convinced\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee was a proof to Wesley that the Brethren\r\nwere heretics and deceivers. He accused them of having deceived the\r\nGovernment and of having obtained their privileges by false pretences.\r\nHe asserted that they had brought forward documents which gave\r\nan erroneous view of their principles and conduct. He hinted that\r\nZinzendorf, in one document, claimed for himself the power, which\r\nbelonged by right to the King and Parliament only, to transport his\r\nBrethren beyond the seas, and that he had deceived the Committee\r\nby using the milder word \"transfer.\" He accused the Brethren of\r\nhypocritical pretence, threw doubts upon their assumed reluctance to\r\nsteal sheep from other churches, and hinted that while they rejected the\r\npoor they welcomed the rich with open arms. At the close of his pamphlet\r\nhe declared his conviction that the chief effect of the Brethren's\r\nreligion was to fill the mind with absurd ideas about the Side-Wound\r\nof Christ, and rivers and seas of blood; and, therefore, he earnestly\r\nbesought all Methodists who had joined the Church of the Brethren to\r\nquit their diabolical delusions, to flee from the borders of Sodom,\r\nand to leave these Brethren, loved the darkness and rejected the Holy\r\nScriptures.\r\n\r\nThe next attack was of a milder nature. At Melbourne, in Derbyshire,\r\nthe Brethren had a small society; and George Baddeley, the local curate,\r\nbeing naturally shocked that so many of his parishioners had ceased to\r\nattend the Parish Church, appealed to them in a pamphlet entitled, \"A\r\nKind and Friendly Letter to the People called Moravians at Melbourne, in\r\nDerbyshire.\" And kind and friendly the pamphlet certainly was. For the\r\nBrethren, as he knew them by personal contact, George Baddeley professed\r\nthe highest respect; and all that he had to say against them was that\r\nthey had helped to empty the Parish Church, and had ignorantly taught\r\nthe people doctrines contrary to Holy Scripture. They made a sing-song,\r\nhe complained, of the doctrine of the cleansing blood of Christ; they\r\nhad driven the doctrine of imputation too far, and had spoken of Christ\r\nas a personal sinner; they had taught that Christians were as holy as\r\nGod, and co-equal with Christ, that believers were not to pray, that\r\nthere were no degrees in faith, and that all who had not full assurance\r\nof faith were children of the devil. The pamphlet is instructive. It was\r\nnot an accurate account of the Brethren's teaching; but it shows what\r\nimpression their teaching made on the mind of an evangelical country\r\ncurate.\r\n\r\nAnother writer, whose name is unknown, denounced the Brethren in his\r\npamphlet \"Some Observations.\" He had read Zinzendorf's Acta Fratrum, was\r\nconvinced that the Brethren were Papists, and feared that now the Act\r\nwas passed they would spread their Popish doctrines in the colonies. For\r\nthis judgment the chief evidence he summoned was a passage in the volume\r\nexpounding the Brethren's doctrine of the Sacrament; and in his\r\nopinion their doctrine was so close to Transubstantiation that ordinary\r\nProtestants could not tell the difference between the two.\r\n\r\nAt Spondon, near Derby, lived Gregory Oldknow; and Gregory published a\r\npamphlet entitled, \"Serious Objections to the Pernicious Doctrines of\r\nthe Moravians and Methodists.\" {1751.} As he did not explain his point\r\nvery clearly, it is hard to see what objection he had to the Brethren;\r\nbut as he called them cannibals and German pickpockets, he cannot have\r\nhad much respect for their personal character. At their love-feasts, he\r\nsaid, their chief object was to squeeze money from the poor. At some of\r\ntheir services they played the bass viol, and at others they did not,\r\nwhich plainly showed that they were unsteady in their minds. And,\r\ntherefore, they were a danger to Church and State.\r\n\r\nAt Dublin, John Roche, a Churchman, published his treatise {1751.}, the\r\n\"Moravian Heresy.\" His book was published by private subscription, and\r\namong the subscribers were the Archbishop of Armagh, the Bishops of\r\nMeath, Raphoe, Waterford, Clogher, Kilmore, Kildare, Derry, and Down\r\nand Connor, and several deans, archdeacons and other Irish clergymen. He\r\ndenounced the Brethren as Antinomians. It is worth while noting what he\r\nmeant by this term. \"The moral acts of a believer,\" said the Brethren,\r\n\"are not acts of duty that are necessary to give him a share in the\r\nmerits of Christ, but acts of love which he is excited to pay the Lamb\r\nfor the salvation already secured to him, if he will but unfeignedly\r\nbelieve it to be so. Thus every good act of a Moravian is not from a\r\nsense of duty, but from a sense of gratitude.\" Thus Roche denounced as\r\nAntinomian the very doctrine now commonly regarded as evangelical.\r\nHe said, further, that the Moravians suffered from hideous diseases\r\ninflicted on them by the devil; but the chief interest of his book is\r\nthe proof it offers of the strength of the Brethren at that time. He\r\nwrote when both Cennick and Wesley had been in Dublin; but Cennick to\r\nhim seemed the really dangerous man. At first he intended to expose both\r\nMoravians and Methodists. \"But,\" he added, \"the Moravians being the\r\nmore dangerous, subtle and powerful sect, and I fear will be the more\r\nobstinate, I shall treat of them first.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next attack the Brethren were themselves to blame. As the\r\nBrethren had sunk some thousands of pounds at Herrnhaag, they should now\r\nhave endeavoured to husband their resources; and yet, at a Synod held in\r\nLondon, 1749, they resolved to erect choir-houses in England. At Lindsey\r\nHouse they sunk £12,000; at Fulneck, in Yorkshire they sunk thousands\r\nmore; at Bedford they sunk thousands more; and meanwhile they were\r\nspending thousands more in the purchase and lease of building land,\r\nand in the support of many preachers in the rapidly increasing country\r\ncongregations. And here they made an amazing business blunder. Instead\r\nof cutting their coat according to their cloth, they relied on a\r\nfictitious capital supposed to exist on the Continent. At one time John\r\nWesley paid a visit to Fulneck, saw the buildings in course of erection,\r\nasked how the cost would be met, and received, he says, the astounding\r\nanswer that the money \"would come from beyond the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, to make matters worse, Mrs. Stonehouse, a wealthy\r\nMoravian, died; and one clause in her will was that, when her husband\r\nfollowed her to the grave, her property should then be devoted to the\r\nsupport of the Church Diaconies. Again the English Brethren made a\r\nbusiness blunder. Instead of waiting till Mr. Stonehouse died, and the\r\nmoney was actually theirs, they relied upon it as prospective capital,\r\nand indulged in speculations beyond their means; and, to cut a long\r\nstory short, the sad fact has to be recorded that, by the close of 1752,\r\nthe Moravian Church in England was about £30,000 in debt. As soon as\r\nZinzendorf heard the news, he rushed heroically to the rescue, gave\r\nsecurity for £10,000, dismissed the managers of the Diaconies, and\r\nformed a new board of administration.\r\n\r\nBut the financial disease was too deep-seated to be so easily cured. The\r\nmanagers of the English Diaconies had been extremely foolish. They had\r\ninvested £67,000 with one Gomez Serra, a Portuguese Jew. Gomez Serra\r\nsuddenly stopped payment, the £67,000 was lost, and thus the Brethren's\r\nliabilities were now nearly £100,000 {1752.}. Again Zinzendorf, in\r\ngenerous fashion, came to the rescue of his Brethren. He acted in\r\nEngland exactly as he had acted at Herrnhaag. He discovered before long,\r\nto his dismay, that many of the English Brethren had invested money\r\nin the Diaconies, and that now they ran the serious danger of being\r\nimprisoned for debt. He called a meeting of the creditors, pledged\r\nhimself for the whole sum, and suggested a plan whereby the debt\r\ncould be paid off in four years. We must not, of course, suppose that\r\nZinzendorf himself proposed to pay the whole £100,000 out of his own\r\nestates. For the present he made himself responsible, but he confidently\r\nrelied on the Brethren to repay their debt to him as soon as possible.\r\nAt all events, the creditors accepted his offer; and all that the\r\nBrethren needed now was time to weather the storm.\r\n\r\nAt this point George Whitefield interfered, and nearly sent the Moravian\r\nship to the bottom {1753.}. He appealed to the example of Moses and\r\nPaul. As Moses, he said, had rebuked the Israelites when they made the\r\ngolden calf, and as Paul had resisted Peter and Barnabas when carried\r\naway with the dissimulation of the Jews, so he, as a champion of the\r\nChurch of Christ, could hold his peace no longer. He attacked the\r\nCount in a fiery pamphlet, entitled, \"An Expostulatory Letter to Count\r\nZinzendorf.\" The pamphlet ran to a second edition, and was circulated in\r\nGermany. He began by condemning Moravian customs as unscriptural. \"Pray,\r\nmy lord,\" he said, \"what instances have we of the first Christians\r\nwalking round the graves of their deceased friends on Easter-Day,\r\nattended with haut-boys, trumpets, French horns, violins and other\r\nkinds of musical instruments? Or where have we the least mention made\r\nof pictures of particular persons being brought into the first Christian\r\nassemblies, and of candles being placed behind them, in order to give\r\na transparent view of the figures? Where was it ever known that the\r\npicture of the apostle Paul, representing him handing a gentleman\r\nand lady up to the side of Jesus Christ, was ever introduced into the\r\nprimitive love-feasts? Again, my lord, I beg leave to inquire whether\r\nwe hear anything of eldresses or deaconesses of the apostolical churches\r\nseating themselves before a table covered with artificial flowers,\r\nagainst that a little altar surrounded with wax tapers, on which stood\r\na cross, composed either of mock or real diamonds, or other glittering\r\nstones?\" As the Brethren, therefore, practised customs which had no\r\nsanction in the New Testament, George Whitefield concluded that they\r\nwere encouraging Popery. At this period the Brethren were certainly\r\nfond of symbols; and on one occasion, as the London Diary records, Peter\r\nBoehler entered Fetter Lane Chapel, arrayed in a white robe to symbolize\r\npurity, and a red sash tied at the waist to symbolize the cleansing\r\nblood of Christ. But the next point in Whitefield's \"letter\" was cruel.\r\nAt the very time when Zinzendorf was giving his money to save his\r\nEnglish Brethren from a debtor's prison, Whitefield accused him and his\r\nBrethren alike of robbery and fraud. He declared that Zinzendorf was\r\n£40,000 in debt; that there was little hope that he would ever pay; that\r\nhis allies were not much better; and that the Brethren had deceived the\r\nParliamentary Committee by representing themselves as men of means. At\r\nthe very time, said Whitefield, when the Moravian leaders were boasting\r\nin Parliament of their great possessions, they were really binding down\r\ntheir English members for thousands more than they could pay. They drew\r\nbills on tradesmen without their consent; they compelled simple folk to\r\nsell their estates, seized the money, and then sent the penniless owners\r\nabroad; and they claimed authority to say to the rich, \"Either give\r\nus all thou hast, or get thee gone.\" For these falsehoods Whitefield\r\nclaimed, no doubt quite honestly, to have good evidence; and to prove\r\nhis point he quoted the case of a certain Thomas Rhodes. Poor Rhodes,\r\nsaid Whitefield, was one of the Brethren's victims. They had first\r\npersuaded him to sell a valuable estate; they had then seized part of\r\nhis money to pay their debts; and at last they drained his stores so dry\r\nthat he had to sell them his watch, bureau, horse and saddle, to fly to\r\nFrance, and to leave his old mother to die of starvation in England.\r\nFor a while this ridiculous story was believed; and the Brethren's\r\ncreditors, in a state of panic, pressed hard for their money. The little\r\nChurch of the Brethren was now on the brink of ruin. At one moment\r\nZinzendorf himself expected to be thrown into prison, and was only\r\nsaved in the nick of time by the arrival of money from Germany. But the\r\nEnglish Brethren now showed their manhood. The very men whom Zinzendorf\r\nwas supposed to have robbed now rose in his defence. Instead of thanking\r\nWhitefield for defending them in their supposed distresses, they formed\r\na committee, drew up a statement,[129] dedicated that statement to the\r\nArchbishop of York, and declared that there was not a word of truth\r\nin Whitefield's charges. They had not, they declared, been robbed by\r\nZinzendorf and the Moravian leaders; on the contrary, they had received\r\nsubstantial benefits from them. Thomas Rhodes himself proved Whitefield\r\nin the wrong. He wrote a letter to his own lawyer; James Hutton\r\npublished extracts from the letter, and in that letter Rhodes declared\r\nthat he had sold his estate of his own free will, that the Brethren had\r\npaid a good price, and that he and his mother were living in perfect\r\ncomfort. Thus was Whitefield's fiction exploded, and the Brethren's\r\ncredit restored.\r\n\r\nBut the next attack was still more deadly. At the time when Whitefield\r\nwrote his pamphlet there had already appeared a book entitled \"A Candid\r\nNarrative of the Rise and Progress of the Herrnhuters\"; and Whitefield\r\nhimself had read the book and had allowed it to poison his mind {1753.}.\r\nThe author was Henry Rimius.[130] He had been Aulic Councillor to the\r\nKing of Prussia, had met Moravians in Germany, and now lived in Oxenden\r\nStreet, London. For two years this scribbler devoted his energies to\r\nan attempt to paint the Brethren in such revolting colours that\r\nthe Government would expel them from the country. His method was\r\nunscrupulous and immoral. He admitted, as he had to admit, that such\r\nEnglish Brethren as he knew were excellent people; and yet he gave the\r\nimpression in his books that the whole Moravian Church was a sink of\r\niniquity. He directed his main attack against Zinzendorf and the old\r\nfanatics at Herrnhaag; and thus he made the English Brethren suffer\r\nfor the past sins of their German cousins. He accused the Brethren of\r\ndeceiving the House of Commons. He would now show them up in their true\r\ncolours. \"No Government,\" he said, \"that harbours them can be secure\r\nwhilst their leaders go on at the rate they have done hitherto.\" He\r\naccused them of holding immoral principles dangerous to Church and\r\nState. They held, he said, that Christ could make the most villainous\r\nact to be virtue, and the most exalted virtue to be vice. They spoke\r\nwith contempt of the Bible, and condemned Bible reading as dangerous.\r\nThey denounced the orthodox theology as fit only for dogs and swine, and\r\ndescribed the priests of other Churches as professors of the devil.\r\nThey called themselves the only true Church, the Church of the Lamb, the\r\nChurch of Blood and Wounds; and claimed that, on the Judgment Day, they\r\nwould shine forth in all their splendour and be the angels coming in\r\nglory. At heart, however, they were not Protestants at all, but Atheists\r\nin disguise; and the real object of all their plotting was to set up\r\na godless empire of their own. They claimed to be independent of\r\ngovernment. They employed a secret gang of informers. They had their own\r\nmagistrates, their own courts of justice, and their own secret laws. At\r\ntheir head was Zinzendorf, their Lord Advocate, with the authority of a\r\nPope. As no one could join the Moravian Church without first promising\r\nto abandon the use of his reason, and submit in all things to his\r\nleaders, those leaders could guide them like little children into the\r\nmost horrid enterprizes. At Herrnhaag the Brethren had established an\r\nindependent state, and had robbed the Counts of Büdingen of vast sums\r\nof money; and, if they were allowed to do so, they would commit similar\r\ncrimes in England. They had a fund called the Lamb's Chest, to which all\r\ntheir members were bound to contribute. The power of their Elders was\r\nenormous. At any moment they could marry a couple against their will,\r\ndivorce them when they thought fit, tear children from their parents,\r\nand dispatch them to distant corners of the earth. But the great object\r\nof the Moravians, said Rimius, was to secure liberty for themselves to\r\npractise their sensual abominations. He supported his case by quoting\r\nfreely, not only from Zinzendorf's sermons, but also from certain German\r\nhymn-books which had been published at Herrnhaag during the \"Sifting\r\nTime\"; and as he gave chapter and verse for his statements, he succeeded\r\nin covering the Brethren with ridicule. He accused them of blasphemy and\r\nindecency. They spoke of Christ as a Tyburn bird, as digging for roots,\r\nas vexed by an aunt, and as sitting in the beer-house among the scum of\r\nsociety. They sang hymns to the devil. They revelled in the most hideous\r\nand filthy expressions, chanted the praises of lust and sensuality,\r\nand practised a number of sensual abominations too loathsome to be\r\ndescribed. At one service held in Fetter Lane, Count Zinzendorf, said\r\nRimius, had declared that the seventh commandment was not binding on\r\nChristians, and had recommended immorality to his congregation.[131] It is\r\nimpossible to give the modern reader a true idea of the shocking picture\r\nof the Brethren painted by Rimius. For malice, spite, indecency\r\nand unfairness, his works would be hard to match even in the vilest\r\nliterature of the eighteenth century. As his books came out in rapid\r\nsuccession, the picture he drew grew more and more disgusting. He wrote\r\nin a racy, sometimes jocular style; and, knowing the dirty taste of the\r\nage, he pleased his public by retailing anecdotes as coarse as any in\r\nthe \"Decameron.\" His chief object was probably to line his own pockets.\r\nHis first book, \"The Candid Narrative,\" sold well. But his attack was\r\nmean and unjust. It is true that he quoted quite correctly from the\r\nsilly literature of the Sifting-Time; but he carefully omitted to state\r\nthe fact that that literature had now been condemned by the Brethren\r\nthemselves, and that only a few absurd stanzas had appeared in English.\r\nAt the same time, in the approved fashion of all scandal-mongers,\r\nhe constantly gave a false impression by tearing passages from their\r\noriginal connection. As an attack on the English Brethren, his work was\r\ndishonest. He had no solid evidence to bring against them. From first to\r\nlast he wrote almost entirely of the fanatics at Herrnhaag, and fathered\r\ntheir sins upon the innocent Brethren in England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, a genuine eye-witness was telling a terrible tale.\r\nHe named his book {1753.}, \"The True and Authentic Account of Andrew\r\nFrey.\" For four years, he said, he lived among the Brethren in\r\nGermany, travelled about helping to form societies, and settled down at\r\nMarienborn, when the fanaticism there was in full bloom. He was known\r\namong the Brethren as Andrew the Great. As he wore a long beard, he was\r\nconsidered rather eccentric. At Marienborn he saw strange sights and\r\nheard strange doctrine. At their feasts the Brethren ate like gluttons\r\nand drank till they were tipsy. \"All godliness, all devotion, all\r\npiety,\" said Rubusch, the general Elder of all the Single Brethren on\r\nthe Continent, \"are no more than so many snares of the devil. Things\r\nmust be brought to this pass in the community, that nothing shall be\r\nspoken of but wounds, wounds, wounds. All other discourse, however\r\nScriptural and pious, must be spued out and trampled under foot.\"\r\nAnother, Vieroth, a preacher in high repute among the Brethren, said, in\r\na sermon at Marienborn castle church: \"Nothing gives the devil greater\r\njoy than to decoy into good works, departing from evil, shalling and\r\nwilling, trying, watching and examining those souls who have experienced\r\nanything of the Saviour's Grace in their hearts.\" Another, Calic, had\r\ndefended self-indulgence. \"Anyone,\" he said, \"having found lodging, bed\r\nand board in the Lamb's wounds cannot but be merry and live according to\r\nnature; so that when such a one plays any pranks that the godly ones cry\r\nout against them as sins, the Saviour is so far from being displeased\r\ntherewith that he rejoices the more.\" In vain Frey endeavoured to\r\ncorrect these cross-air birds; they denounced him as a rogue. He\r\nappealed to Zinzendorf, and found to his dismay that the Count was as\r\ndepraved as the rest. \"Do not suffer yourselves to be molested in your\r\nmerriment,\" said that trumpet of Satan; and others declared that the\r\nBible was dung, and only fit to be trampled under foot. At last Andrew,\r\ndisgusted beyond all measure, could restrain his soul no longer; and\r\ntelling the Brethren they were the wickedest sect that had appeared\r\nsince the days of the Apostles, and profoundly thankful that their\r\ngilded poison had not killed his soul, he turned his back on them for\r\never.[132]\r\nThe next smiter of the Brethren was Lavington, Bishop of Exeter. He\r\ncalled his book \"The Moravians Compared and Detected.\" He had already\r\ndenounced the Methodists in his \"Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists\r\nCompared\" {1754.}; and now he described the Brethren as immoral\r\ncharacters, fitted to enter a herd of swine. In a pompous introduction\r\nhe explained his purpose, and that purpose was the suppression of the\r\n\"Brethren's Church in England.\" \"With respect to the settlement of\r\nthe Moravians in these kingdoms,\" he said, \"it seems to have been\r\nsurreptitiously obtained, under the pretence of their being a peaceable\r\nand innocent sort of people. And peaceable probably they will remain\r\nwhile they are permitted, without control, to ruin families and riot in\r\ntheir debaucheries.\" Of all the attacks upon the Brethren, this book\r\nby Lavington was the most offensive and scurrilous; and the Brethren\r\nthemselves could hardly believe that it was written by a Bishop. It was\r\nunfit for a decent person to read. The good Bishop knew nothing of his\r\nsubject. As he could not read the German language, he had to rely for\r\nhis information on the English editions of the works of Rimius and Frey;\r\nand all he did was to collect in one volume the nastiest passages in\r\ntheir indictments, compare the Brethren with certain queer sects of the\r\nMiddle Ages, and thus hold them up before the public as filthy dreamers\r\nand debauchees of the vilest order.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to give a finishing touch to the picture, John Wesley arose\r\nonce more {1755.}. He, too, had swallowed the poison of Rimius and Frey,\r\nand a good deal of other poison as well. At Bedford a scandal-monger\r\ninformed him that the Brethren were the worst paymasters in the town;\r\nand at Holbeck another avowed that the Brethren whom he had met in\r\nYorkshire were quite as bad as Rimius had stated. As Wesley printed\r\nthese statements in his journal they were soon read in every county in\r\nEngland. But Wesley himself did not assert that these statements were\r\ntrue. He wished, he said, to be quite fair to the Brethren; he wished\r\nto give them a chance of clearing themselves; and, therefore, he now\r\npublished his pamphlet entitled \"Queries to Count Zinzendorf.\" It\r\ncontained the whole case in a nutshell. For the sum of sixpence the\r\nordinary reader had now the case against the Brethren in a popular and\r\nhandy form.\r\n\r\nThus the Brethren, attacked from so many sides, were bound to bestir\r\nthemselves in self-defence. The burden of reply fell on Zinzendorf.\r\nHis life and conversation were described as scandalous; his hymns\r\nwere denounced as filthy abominations, and his discourses as pleas\r\nfor immorality; and the Brethren for whose sake he had sacrificed\r\nhis fortune were held up before the British public as political\r\nconspirators, atheists, robbers of the poor, kidnappers of children,\r\nruiners of families, and lascivious lovers of pleasure. But the Count\r\nwas a busy man. James Hutton says that he worked on the average eighteen\r\nhours a day. He was constantly preaching, writing, relieving the\r\ndistressed, paying other people's debts, and providing the necessaries\r\nof life for a hundred ministers of the Gospel. He had dealt with similar\r\naccusations in Germany, had published a volume containing a thousand\r\nanswers to a thousand questions, and was loth to go over the whole\r\nground again. For some time he clung to the hope that the verdict\r\nof Parliament and the common sense of Englishmen would be sufficient\r\nprotection against abuse; and he gallantly defended the character of\r\nRimius, and spoke with generous enthusiasm of Whitefield. The best\r\nfriends of the Brethren, such as Lord Granville and the Bishops of\r\nLondon and Worcester, advised them to treat Rimius with contemptuous\r\nsilence. But a reply became a necessity. As long as the Brethren\r\nremained silent, their enemies asserted that this very silence was a\r\nconfession of guilt; and some mischievous scoundrel, in the name, but\r\nwithout the consent, of the Brethren, inserted a notice in the General\r\nAdvertiser that they intended to reply to Rimius in detail. For these\r\nreasons, therefore, Zinzendorf, James Hutton, Frederick Neisser, and\r\nothers who preferred to write anonymously, now issued a series of\r\ndefensive pamphlets.[133] The Count offered to lay before the public a\r\nfull statement of his financial affairs; and James Hutton, in a notice\r\nin several newspapers, promised to answer any reasonable questions. It\r\nis needless to give the Brethren's defence in detail. The plain facts of\r\nthe case were beyond all dispute. In two ways the accusations of Rimius\r\nand Frey were out of court. First they accused the whole Church of the\r\nBrethren of sins which had only been committed by a few fanatics at\r\nMarienborn and Herrnhaag; and, secondly, that fanaticism had practically\r\nceased before the Act of Parliament was passed. The Count here stood\r\nupon firm ground. He pointed out that the accusers of the Brethren had\r\nnearly always taken care to go to the Wetterau for their material; and\r\nhe contended that it was a shame to blame innocent Englishmen for the\r\npast sins, long ago abandoned, of a few foreign fanatics. He appealed\r\nconfidently to the public. \"We are so well known to our neighbours,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that all our clearing ourselves of accusations appears to them\r\nquite needless.\" In reply to the charge of using indecent language, he\r\ncontended that his purpose was good, and justified by the results; and\r\nthat, as soon as he found himself misunderstood, he had cut out all\r\ndoubtful phrases from his discourses.\r\n\r\nJames Hutton explained their use of childish language. At this period\r\nthe Brethren, in some of their hymns, used a number of endearing\r\nepithets which would strike the modern reader as absurd. For example,\r\nthey spoke of the little Lamb, the little Jesus, the little Cross-air\r\nBird. But even here they were not so childish as their critics imagined.\r\nThe truth was, these phrases were Bohemian in origin. In the Bohemian\r\nlanguage diminutives abound. In Bohemia a servant girl is addressed as\r\n\"demercko\"--i.e., little, little maid; and the literal translation of\r\n\"mug mily Bozicko\"--a phrase often used in public worship--is \"my dear,\r\nlittle, little God.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Brethren had a better defence than writing pamphlets. Instead of\r\ntaking too much notice of their enemies, they began to set their English\r\nhouse in order. For the first time they now published an authorized\r\ncollection of English Moravian hymns {1754.}; and in the preface they\r\nclearly declared their purpose. The purpose was twofold: first,\r\nthe proclamation of the Gospel; second, the cultivation of personal\r\nholiness. If we judge this book by modern standards, we shall certainly\r\nfind it faulty; but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that it\r\nrendered a very noble service to the Christianity of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The chief burden of the hymns was Ecce Homo. If the Brethren\r\nhad never done anything else, they had at least placed the sufferings of\r\nChrist in the forefront of their message. With rapturous enthusiasm the\r\nBrethren depicted every detail of the Passion History; and thus they\r\nreminded their hearers of events which ordinary Christians had almost\r\nforgotten. At times the language they used was gruesome; and, lost in\r\nmystic adoration, the Brethren, in imagination, trod the Via Dolorosa.\r\nThey nestled in the nail-prints; they kissed the spear; they gazed\r\nwith rapt and holy awe on the golden head, the raven locks, the pallid\r\ncheeks, the foaming lips, the melting eyes, the green wreath of thorns,\r\nthe torn sinews, the great blue wounds, and the pierced palms, like\r\nrings of gold, beset with rubies red. In one stanza they abhorred\r\nthemselves as worms; in the next they rejoiced as alabaster doves; and,\r\nglorying in the constant presence of the Well-Beloved, they feared not\r\nthe King of Terrors, and calmly sang of death as \"the last magnetic\r\nkiss, to consummate their bliss.\" But, despite its crude and extravagant\r\nlanguage, this hymn-book was of historic importance. At that time\r\nthe number of hymn-books in England was small; the Anglicans had no\r\nhymn-book at all, and never sang anything but Psalms; and thus the\r\nBrethren were among the first to make the adoration of Christ in song\r\nan essential part of public worship. It was here that the Brethren\r\nexcelled, and here that they helped to free English Christianity from\r\nthe chilling influence of Deism. The whole point was quaintly expressed\r\nby Bishop John Gambold:--\r\n\r\n   The Doctrine of the Unitas\r\n     By Providence was meant,\r\n   In Christendom's degenerate days,\r\n     That cold lump to ferment,\r\n   From Scripture Pearls to wipe the dust,\r\n   Give blood-bought grace its compass just,\r\n     In praxis, truth from shew to part,\r\n      God's Power from Ethic Art.\r\n\r\nBut the last line must not be misunderstood. It did not mean that the\r\nBrethren despised ethics. Of all the charges brought against them, the\r\ncharge that they were Antinomians was the most malicious and absurd.\r\nAt the very time when their enemies were accusing them of teaching that\r\ngood works were of no importance, they inserted in their Litany for\r\nSunday morning worship a number of petitions which were alone enough to\r\ngive that charge the lie. The petitions were as follows:--\r\n\r\n   O! that we might never see a necessitous person go unrelieved!\r\n   O! that we might see none suffer for want of clothing!\r\n   O! that we might be eyes to the blind and feet to the lame!\r\n   O! that we could refresh the heart of the Fatherless!\r\n   O! that we could mitigate the burden of the labouring man, and be\r\n   ourselves not ministered unto but minister!\r\n   Feed its with that princely repast of solacing others!\r\n   O! that the blessing of him who was ready to perish might come\r\n   upon us!\r\n   Yea! may our hearts rejoice to see it go well with our enemies.\r\n\r\nAgain, therefore, as in their hymns, the Brethren laid stress on the\r\nhumane element in Christianity.[134]\r\nBut their next retort to their enemies was the grandest of all. At a\r\nSynod held in Lindsey House, they resolved that a Book of Statutes was\r\nneeded, and requested Zinzendorf to prepare one {1754.}. The Count was\r\nin a quandary. He could see that a Book of Statutes was required, but he\r\ncould not decide what form it should take. If he framed the laws in\r\nhis own language, his critics would accuse him of departing from the\r\nScriptures; and if he used the language of Scripture, the same critics\r\nwould accuse him of hedging and of having some private interpretation of\r\nthe Bible. At length he decided to use the language of Scripture. He was\r\nso afraid of causing offence that, Greek scholar though he was, he felt\r\nbound to adhere to the Authorised Version. If Zinzendorf had used his\r\nown translation his enemies would have accused him of tampering with\r\nthe Word of God. The book appeared. It was entitled, Statutes: or the\r\nGeneral Principles of Practical Christianity, extracted out of the New\r\nTestament. It was designed for the use of all English Moravians, and was\r\nsanctioned and adopted by the Synod on May 12th, 1755. It was thorough\r\nand systematic. For fathers and mothers, for sons and daughters, for\r\nmasters and servants, for governors and governed, for business men, for\r\nbishops and pastors, the appropriate commandments were selected from\r\nthe New Testament. In a printed notice on the title page, the Brethren\r\nexplained their own interpretation of those commandments. \"Lest it\r\nshould be thought,\" they said, \"that they seek, perhaps, some subterfuge\r\nin the pretended indeterminate nature of Scripture-style, they know very\r\nwell that it becomes them to understand every precept and obligation in\r\nthe same manner as the generality of serious Christians understand the\r\nsame (and this is a thing, God be praised, pretty well fixed), or, if\r\nat all differently, then always stricter.\" The purpose of the book was\r\nclear. It was a handy guide to daily conduct. It was meant to be learned\r\nby heart, and was issued in such size and form that it could be carried\r\nabout in the pocket. It was \"a faithful monitor to souls who, having\r\nbeen first washed through the blood of Jesus, do now live in the Spirit,\r\nto walk also in the Spirit.\" To the Brethren this little Christian guide\r\nwas a treasure. As long as they ordered their daily conduct by these\r\n\"convenient rules for the house of their pilgrimage,\" they could smile\r\nat the sneers of Rimius and his supporters. The Moravian influence in\r\nEngland was now at high tide. At the very time when their enemies were\r\ndenouncing them as immoral Antinomians, they established their strongest\r\ncongregations at Fulneck, Gomersal, Wyke, Mirfield, Dukinfield, Bristol,\r\nand Gracehill {1755.}; and in all their congregations the \"Statutes\"\r\nwere enforced with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nThus did the Brethren repel the attacks of their assailants. From this\r\nchapter one certain conclusion follows. The very fact that the Brethren\r\nwere so fiercely attacked is a proof how strong they were. As the reader\r\nwanders over England, he may see, if he knows where to look, memorials\r\nof their bygone labours. In Northampton is an auction room that was once\r\na Moravian chapel. In Bullock Smithy is a row of cottages named \"Chapel\r\nHouses,\" where now the Brethren are forgotten. In a private house at\r\nBolton, Lancashire, will be found a cupboard that was once a Moravian\r\nPulpit. In Wiltshire stands the \"two o'clock chapel,\" where Cennick used\r\nto preach. We may learn much from such memorials as these. We may learn\r\nthat the Brethren played a far greater part in the Evangelical Revival\r\nthan most historians have recognised; that they worked more like the\r\nunseen leaven than like the spreading mustard tree; that they hankered\r\nnot after earthly pomp, and despised what the world calls success; and\r\nthat, reviled, insulted, and misrepresented, they pursued their quiet\r\nway, content with the reward which man cannot give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. -- THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENTS, 1734-1762.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a clear view of the events recorded in this chapter, we\r\nmust bear in mind that the Brethren worked according to a definite Plan;\r\nthey generally formed their \"Plan\" by means of the Lot; and this \"Plan,\"\r\nspeaking broadly, was of a threefold nature. The Brethren had three\r\nideals: First, they were not sectarians. Instead of trying to extend the\r\nMoravian Church at the expense of other denominations, they consistently\r\nendeavoured, wherever they went, to preach a broad and comprehensive\r\nGospel, to avoid theological disputes, to make peace between the sects,\r\nand to unite Christians of all shades of belief in common devotion to a\r\ncommon Lord. Secondly, by establishing settlements, they endeavoured to\r\nunite the secular and the sacred. At these settlements they deliberately\r\nadopted, for purely religious purposes, a form of voluntary religious\r\nsocialism. They were not, however, socialists or communists by\r\nconviction; they had no desire to alter the laws of property; and they\r\nestablished their communistic organization, not from any political\r\nmotives, but because they felt that, for the time at least, it would be\r\nthe most economical, would foster Christian fellowship, would sanctify\r\ndaily labour, and would enable them, poor men though they were, to find\r\nways and means for the spread of the Gospel. And thirdly, the Brethren\r\nwould preach that Gospel to all men, civilized or savage, who had not\r\nheard it before. With these three ideals before us, we trace their\r\nfootsteps in North America.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse sprang from the kindness of Zinzendorf's heart. At\r\nGörlitz, a town a few miles from Herrnhut, there dwelt a small body of\r\nSchwenkfelders; and the King of Saxony issued an edict banishing\r\nthem from his dominions {1733.}. As soon as Zinzendorf heard of their\r\ntroubles he longed to find them a home. He opened negotiations with the\r\ntrustees of the Colony of Georgia. The negotiations were successful.\r\nThe Governor of Georgia, General Oglethorpe, was glad to welcome good\r\nworkmen; a parcel of land was offered, and the poor Schwenkfelders,\r\naccompanied by Böhnisch, a Moravian Brother, set off for their American\r\nhome. For some reason, however, they changed their minds on the way,\r\nand, instead of settling down in Georgia, went on to Pennsylvania. The\r\nland in Georgia was now crying out for settlers. At Herrnhut trouble\r\nwas brewing. If the spirit of persecution continued raging, the Brethren\r\nthemselves might soon be in need of a home. The Count took time by the\r\nforelock. As soon as the storm burst over Herrnhut, the Brethren might\r\nhave to fly; and, therefore, he now sent Spangenberg to arrange terms\r\nwith General Oglethorpe. Again the negotiations were successful; the\r\nGeneral offered the Brethren a hundred acres; and a few weeks later, led\r\nby Spangenberg, the first batch of Moravian colonists arrived in Georgia\r\n{1734.}. The next batch was the famous company on the Simmonds. The new\r\nsettlement was on the banks of the Savannah River. For some years,\r\nwith Spangenberg as general manager, the Brethren tried to found a\r\nflourishing farm colony. The learned Spangenberg was a practical man. In\r\nspite of the fact that he had been a University lecturer, he now put\r\nhis hand to the plough like a labourer to the manner born. He was the\r\nbusiness agent; he was the cashier; he was the spiritual leader; he was\r\nthe architect; and he was the medical adviser. As the climate of Georgia\r\nwas utterly different from the climate of Saxony, he perceived at once\r\nthat the Brethren would have to be careful in matters of diet, and\r\nrather astonished the Sisters by giving them detailed instructions about\r\nthe cooking of rice and beef. The difference between him and Zinzendorf\r\nwas enormous. At St. Croix, a couple of years before, a band of Moravian\r\nMissionaries had died of fever; and while Zinzendorf immortalized their\r\nexploits in a hymn, the practical Spangenberg calmly considered how such\r\nheroic tragedies could be prevented in the future. In political matters\r\nhe was equally far-seeing. As the Brethren were now in an English\r\ncolony, it was, he said, their plain duty to be naturalized as\r\nEnglishmen as soon as possible; and, therefore, in a letter to\r\nZinzendorf, he implored him to become a British subject himself, to\r\nsecure for the Brethren the rights of English citizens, and, above all,\r\nif possible to obtain letters patent relieving the Brethren from the\r\nobligation to render military service. But on Zinzendorf all this wisdom\r\nwas thrown away. Already the ruin of the colony was in sight. At the\r\nvery time when the Brethren's labours should have been crowned with\r\nsuccess, Captain Jenkins, at the bar of the House of Commons, was\r\ntelling how his ear had been cut off by Spaniards {1738.}. The great\r\nwar between England and Spain broke out. The chief aim of Spain was to\r\ndestroy our colonial supremacy in America. Spanish soldiers threatened\r\nGeorgia. The Brethren were summoned to take to arms and help to defend\r\nthe colony against the foe. But the Brethren objected to taking arms\r\nat all. The farm colony was abandoned; and the scene shifts to\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the good Spangenberg had been busy in Pennsylvania, looking\r\nafter the interests of the Schwenkfelders. He attended their meetings,\r\nwore their clothing--a green coat, without buttons or pockets--studied\r\nthe works of Schwenkfeld, and organized them into what he called an\r\n\"Economy.\" In other words, he taught them to help each other by joining\r\nin common work on a communist basis. At the same time, he tried to teach\r\nthem to be a little more broad-minded, and not to quarrel so much with\r\nother Christians. But the more he talked of brotherly love the more\r\nbigoted the poor Schwenkfelders became. At this time the colony had\r\nbecome a nest of fanatics. For some years, in response to the generous\r\noffers of Thomas Penn, all sorts of persecuted refugees had fled\r\nto Pennsylvania; and now the land was infested by a motley group of\r\nEpiscopalians, Quakers, Baptists, Separatists, Sabbatarians, Unitarians,\r\nLutherans, Calvinists, Memnonites, Presbyterians, Independents, Inspired\r\nProphets, Hermits, Newborn Ones, Dunckers, and Protestant Monks and\r\nNuns. Thus the land was filled with \"religions\" and almost empty of\r\nreligion. Instead of attending to the spiritual needs of the people,\r\neach Church or sect was trying to prove itself in the right and all the\r\nothers in the wrong; and the only principle on which they agreed was the\r\nprinciple of disagreeing with each other. The result was heathendom and\r\nbabel. Most of the people attended neither church nor chapel; most of\r\nthe parents were unbaptized, and brought up their children in ignorance;\r\nand, according to a popular proverb of the day, to say that a man\r\nprofessed the Pennsylvania religion was a polite way of calling him an\r\ninfidel.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as Zinzendorf heard from Spangenberg of these\r\ndisgraceful quarrels a glorious vision rose before his mind; and the\r\nconviction flashed upon him that Pennsylvania was the spot where the\r\nBrethren's broad evangel was needed most. There, in the midst of the\r\nquarrelling sects he would plant the lily of peace; there, where the\r\ncause of unity seemed hopeless, he would realize the prayer of Christ,\r\n\"that they all may be one.\" For two reason, America seemed to him the\r\ntrue home of the ideal Church of the Brethren. First, there was no State\r\nChurch; and, therefore, whatever line he took, he could not be accused\r\nof causing a schism. Secondly, there was religious liberty; and,\r\ntherefore, he could work out his ideas without fear of being checked by\r\nedicts. For these reasons he first sent out another batch of colonists,\r\nled by Bishop Nitschmann; and then, in due time, he arrived on the scene\r\nhimself. The first move had the promise of good. At the spot the Lehigh\r\nand the Monocany meet the Brethren had purchased a plot of ground\r\n{1741}; they all lived together in one log-house; they proposed to build\r\na settlement like Herrnhut; and there, one immortal Christmas Eve, Count\r\nZinzendorf conducted a consecration service. Above them shone the keen,\r\ncold stars, God's messengers of peace; around them ranged the babel of\r\nstrife; and the Count, remembering how the Prince of Peace had been born\r\nin a humble wayside lodging, named the future settlement Bethlehem. The\r\nname had a twofold meaning. It was a token of the Brethren's mission\r\nof peace; and it reminded them that the future settlement was to be a\r\n\"House of Bread\" for their evangelists.\r\n\r\nThe Count was now in his element. For two years he did his best to teach\r\nthe quarrelling sects in Pennsylvania to help and esteem each other;\r\nand the bond of union he set before them was a common experience of the\r\nredeeming grace of Christ. He had come to America, not as a Moravian\r\nBishop, but as a Lutheran clergyman; and he was so afraid of being\r\nsuspected of sectarian motives that, before he set out from London,\r\nhe had purposely laid his episcopal office aside. For some months,\r\ntherefore, he now acted as Lutheran clergyman to a Lutheran congregation\r\nin Philadelphia; and meanwhile he issued a circular, inviting German\r\nChristians of all denominations to meet in Conference. His purpose, to\r\nuse his own phrase, was to establish a grand \"Congregation of God in the\r\nSpirit.\" At first the outlook was hopeful. From all sects deputies came,\r\nand a series of \"Pennsylvanian Synods\" was held. Again, however, the\r\nCount was misled by his own ignorance of history. At this time he held\r\nthe erroneous view that the Union of Sendomir in Poland (1570) was\r\na beautiful union of churches brought about by the efforts of the\r\nBrethren; he imagined also that the Bohemian Confession (1575) had been\r\ndrawn up by the Brethren; and, therefore, he very naturally concluded\r\nthat what the Brethren had accomplished in Poland and Bohemia they could\r\naccomplish again in Pennsylvania. But the stern facts of the case were\r\nall against him. At the very time when he was endeavouring to establish\r\na \"Congregation of God in the Spirit\" in Pennsylvania, he heard that his\r\nown Brethren in Germany were departing from his ideals; and, therefore,\r\nhe had to return to Germany, and hand on his American work to\r\nSpangenberg {1743.}.\r\n\r\nFor that task the broad-minded Spangenberg was admirably fitted, and now\r\nhe held a number of titles supposed to define his mission. First, he\r\nwas officially appointed \"General Elder\" in America; second, he was\r\nconsecrated a Bishop, and was thus head of the American Moravian Church;\r\nand third, he was \"Vicarius generalis episcoporum\"; i.e., General Vicar\r\nof the Bishops. For the next four years the Pennsylvania Synods, with\r\nthe broad-minded Spangenberg as President, continued to meet with more\r\nor less regularity. In 1744 they met twice; in 1745 three times; in 1746\r\nfour times; in 1747 three times; and in 1748 twice. But gradually the\r\nSynods altered in character. At first representatives attended from a\r\ndozen different bodies; then only Lutherans, Calvinists and Moravians;\r\nthen only Moravians; and at length, when John de Watteville arrived upon\r\nthe scene, he found that for all intents and purposes the Pennsylvanian\r\nSynod had become a Synod of the Moravian Church. He recognized the facts\r\nof the case, abolished the \"Congregation of the Spirit,\" and laid the\r\nconstitutional foundations of the Brethren's Church in North America\r\n(1748). Thus Zinzendorf's scheme of union collapsed, and the first\r\nAmerican experiment was a failure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bishop Spangenberg had been busy with the second. If this man\r\nwas inferior to Zinzendorf in genius he was far above him as a practical\r\npolitician. He now accomplished his \"Masterpiece.\"[135] The task before\r\nhim was twofold. He had to find both men and money; and from the first\r\nhe bravely resolved to do without one penny of assistance from Germany.\r\nHe called his plan the \"Economy,\" and an economical plan it certainly\r\nwas. His great principle was subdivision of labour. As the work in\r\nAmerica was mostly among poor people--some immigrants, others Red\r\nIndians--he perceived that special measures must be taken to cover\r\nexpenses; and, therefore, he divided his army into two main bodies. The\r\none was the commissariat department; the other was the fighting line.\r\nThe one was engaged in manual labour; the other was preaching the\r\ngospel. The one was stationed chiefly at Bethlehem; the other was\r\nscattered in different parts of North America. About ten miles\r\nnorth-west of Bethlehem the Brethren purchased a tract of land from\r\nGeorge Whitefield, gave it the name of Nazareth, and proposed to build\r\nanother settlement there. At first the two settlements were practically\r\nworked as one. For eighteen years they bore between them almost the\r\nwhole financial burden of the Brethren's work in North America. There,\r\nat the joint settlement of Bethlehem-Nazareth, the \"Economy\" was\r\nestablished. There lay the general \"camp\"; there stood the home of \"the\r\nPilgrim Band\"; there was built the \"School of the Prophets\"; there, to\r\nuse Spangenberg's vivid phrase, was the \"Saviour's Armoury.\" The great\r\npurpose which the Brethren set before them was to preach the Gospel in\r\nAmerica without making the American people pay. Instead of having their\r\npreachers supported by contributions from their congregations, they\r\nwould support these preachers themselves. For this task the only capital\r\nthat Spangenberg possessed was two uncultivated tracts of land, three\r\nroomy dwelling-houses, two or three outhouses and barns, his own fertile\r\ngenius, and a body of Brethren and Sisters willing to work. His method\r\nof work was remarkable. In order, first, to cut down the expenses of\r\nliving, he asked his workers then and there to surrender the comforts of\r\nfamily life. At Bethlehem stood two large houses. In one lived all the\r\nSingle Brethren; in the other the families, all the husbands in one\r\npart, all the wives in another, all the children (under guardians) in\r\nthe third. At Nazareth there was only one house; and there lived all the\r\nSingle Sisters. As the Sisters set off through the forest to their home\r\nin Nazareth, they carried their spinning-wheels on their shoulders;\r\nand two hours after their arrival in the house they were driving their\r\nwheels with zeal. At Bethlehem the energy of all was amazing. Bishop\r\nSpangenberg was commonly known as Brother Joseph; and Brother Joseph, in\r\na letter to Zinzendorf, explained the purpose of his scheme. \"As Paul,\"\r\nhe said, \"worked with his own hands, so as to be able to preach the\r\nGospel without pay, so we, according to our ability, will do the same;\r\nand thus even a child of four will be able, by plucking wool, to serve\r\nthe Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nFor patient devotion and heroic self-sacrifice these humble toilers at\r\nthe Bethlehem-Nazareth \"Economy\" are unsurpassed in the history of the\r\nBrethren's Church. They built their own houses; they made their own\r\nclothes and boots; they tilled the soil and provided their own meat,\r\nvegetables, bread, milk, and eggs; they sawed their own wood, spun their\r\nown yarn, and wove their own cloth; and then, selling at the regular\r\nmarket price what was not required for their personal use, they spent\r\nthe profits in the support of preachers, teachers, and missionaries in\r\nvarious parts of North America. For a motto they took the words: \"In\r\ncommune oramus, in commune laboramus, in commune patimur, in commune\r\ngaudeamus\"; i.e., together we pray, together we labour, together we\r\nsuffer, together we rejoice. The motive, however, was not social, but\r\nreligious. \"It is nothing,\" said Spangenberg himself, \"but love to the\r\nLamb and His Church.\" For this cause the ploughman tilled the soil, the\r\nwomen sewed, the joiner sawed, the blacksmith plied his hammer; for\r\nthis cause the fond mothers, with tears in their eyes, handed over their\r\nchildren to the care of guardians, so that they themselves might be free\r\nto toil for the Master. Thus every trade was sanctified; and thus did\r\nall, both old and young, spend all their powers for the Gospel's sake.\r\nIf there is any distinction between secular and sacred, that distinction\r\nwas unknown at Bethlehem and Nazareth. At Bethlehem the Brethren\r\naccounted it an honour to chop wood for the Master's sake; and the\r\nfireman, said Spangenberg, felt his post as important \"as if he were\r\nguarding the Ark of the Covenant.\" For the members of each trade or\r\ncalling a special series of services was arranged; and thus every toiler\r\nwas constantly reminded that he was working not for himself but for God.\r\nThe number of lovefeasts was enormous. At the opening of the harvest\r\nseason the farm labourers held an early morning lovefeast; the discourse\r\nwas partly on spiritual topics and partly on rules of diet; then the\r\nsickles were handed out; and the whole band, with hymns of praise on\r\ntheir lips, set off for the harvest field. For days at a time the Single\r\nBrethren would be in the forest felling trees; but before they set off\r\nthey had a lovefeast, and when they returned they had another. As soon\r\nas the joiners had the oil-mill ready they celebrated the event in a\r\nlovefeast. The spinners had a lovefeast once a week. The joiners, the\r\nweavers, the cartwrights, the smiths, the hewers of wood, the milkers\r\nof cows, the knitters, the sewers, the cooks, the washerwomen--all had\r\ntheir special lovefeasts. At one time the joyful discovery was made\r\nthat a Brother had served a year in the kitchen, and was ready to serve\r\nanother; and thereupon the whole settlement held a general lovefeast\r\nin his honour. For the mothers a special meeting was held, at which an\r\nexpert gave instructions on the art of bringing up children; and at this\r\nmeeting, while the lecturer discoursed or occasional hymns were sung,\r\nthe women were busy with their hands. One made shoes, another tailored,\r\nanother ground powder for the chemist's shop, another copied invoices\r\nand letters, another sliced turnips, another knitted socks. For each\r\ncalling special hymns were composed and sung. If these hymns had been\r\npublished in a volume we should have had a Working-man's Hymnbook. Thus\r\nevery man and woman at Bethlehem-Nazareth had enlisted in the missionary\r\narmy. Never, surely, in the history of Protestant Christianity were\r\nthe secular and the sacred more happily wedded. \"In our Economy,\" said\r\nSpangenberg, \"the spiritual and physical are as closely united as a\r\nman's body and soul; and each has a marked effect upon the other.\" If\r\na man lost his touch with Christ it was noticed that he was careless in\r\nhis work; but as long as his heart was right with God his eye was clear\r\nand his hand steady and firm. At the head of the whole concern stood\r\nSpangenberg, a business man to the finger tips. If genius is a capacity\r\nfor taking pains, then Spangenberg was a genius of the finest order. He\r\ndrew up regulations dealing with every detail of the business, and at\r\nhis office he kept a strict account of every penny expended, every yard\r\nof linen woven, every pound of butter made, and every egg consumed.\r\nAs long as Spangenberg was on the spot the business arrangements were\r\nperfect; he was assisted by a Board of Directors, known as the Aufseher\r\nCollegium; and so great was the enterprise shown that before the close\r\nof his first period of administration the Brethren had several farms and\r\nthirty-two industries in full working order. It was this which impressed\r\nour House of Commons, and enabled them, in the Act of 1749, to recognize\r\nthe Brethren \"as a sober and industrious people.\" For that Act the\r\ncredit must be given, not to the airy dreams of Zinzendorf, but to\r\nthe solid labours of Spangenberg. At the time when the Bill was under\r\ndiscussion the chief stress was laid, in both Houses, on the results of\r\nSpangenberg's labours; and so deeply was Earl Granville impressed that\r\nhe offered the Brethren a hundred thousand acres in North Carolina. At\r\nlength, accompanied by five other Brethren, Spangenberg himself set\r\noff to view the land, selected a site, organized another \"Economy,\"\r\nestablished two congregations, named Bethabara and Bethany, and thus\r\nbecame the founder of the Southern Province of the Brethren's Church in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBut his greatest success was in the Northern Province. For many years\r\nthe Brethren at Bethlehem-Nazareth maintained nearly all the preachers\r\nin North America. In Pennsylvania they had preachers at Germantown,\r\nPhiladelphia, Lancaster, York, Donegal, Heidelberg, Lebanon, Lititz,\r\nOley, Allemaengel, Emmaus, Salisbury, Falkner's Swamp, the Trappe,\r\nMahanatawny, Neshaminy, and Dansbury. In Maryland they had a station at\r\nGraceham. In Jersey they had stations at Maurice River, Racoon, Penn's\r\nNeck, Oldman's Creek, Pawlin's Hill, Walpack, and Brunswick; in Rhode\r\nIsland, at Newport; in Maine, at Broadbay; in New York, at Canajoharie;\r\nand other stations at Staten Island and Long Island. They opened\r\nfifteen schools for poor children; they paid the travelling expenses of\r\nmissionaries to Surinam and the West Indies; they maintained a number of\r\nmissionaries to the Red Indians. Thus did Spangenberg, by means of his\r\n\"Economy,\" establish the Moravian Church in North America. We must not\r\nmisunderstand his motives. He never made his system compulsory, and he\r\nnever intended it to last. If any Brother objected to working for the\r\n\"Economy,\" and preferred to trade on his own account, he was free to do\r\nso; and as soon as the \"Economy\" had served its purpose it was abolished\r\nby Spangenberg himself (1762). It is easy to object that his system\r\ninterfered with family life. It is easy to say that this Moravian Bishop\r\nhad no right to split families into sections, to herd the husbands in\r\none abode and the wives in another, to tear children from their mothers'\r\narms and place them under guardians. But Brother Joseph had his answer\r\nto this objection. At Bethlehem, he declared, the members of the\r\n\"Economy\" were as happy as birds in the sunshine; and, rejoicing in\r\ntheir voluntary sacrifice, they vowed that they would rather die than\r\nresign this chance of service. The whole arrangement was voluntary.\r\nNot a man or woman was pressed into the service. If a man joins the\r\nvolunteers he is generally prepared, for the time being, to forego the\r\ncomforts of family life, and these gallant toilers of the \"Economy\" were\r\nvolunteers for God.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of Spangenberg's work was his loyalty as a British\r\ncitizen. As long as he was resident in a British Colony he considered it\r\nhis duty, German though he was, to stand by the British flag; and while\r\nthat famous war was raging which ended in the brilliant capture of\r\nQuebec, and the conquest of Canada, Brother Joseph and the Moravian\r\nBrethren upheld the British cause from first to last. The Red Indians\r\nwere nearly all on the side of France. As the Brethren, therefore,\r\npreached to the Indians, they were at first suspected of treachery, and\r\nwere even accused of inciting the Indians to rebellion; but Spangenberg\r\nproved their loyalty to the hilt. At Gnadenhütten, on the Mahony River,\r\nthe Brethren had established a Mission Station {1755.}; and there, one\r\nnight, as they sat at supper, they heard the farm dogs set up a warning\r\nbarking.\r\n\r\n\"It occurs to me,\" said Brother Senseman, \"that the Congregation House\r\nis still open; I will go and lock it; there may be stragglers from the\r\nmilitia in the neighbourhood.\" And out he went.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, while Senseman was about his duty, the sound of\r\nfootsteps was heard; the Brethren opened the door; and there stood a\r\nband of painted Indians, with rifles in their hands. The war-whoop was\r\nraised. The first volley was fired. John Nitschmann fell dead on the\r\nspot. As the firing continued, the Brethren and Sisters endeavoured\r\nto take refuge in the attic; but before they could all clamber up\r\nthe stairs five others had fallen dead. The Indians set fire to the\r\nbuilding. The fate of the missionaries was sealed. As the flames arose,\r\none Brother managed to escape by a back door, another let himself down\r\nfrom the window, another was captured, scalped alive, and left to die;\r\nand the rest, huddled in the blazing garret, were roasted to death.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Saviour, it is well,\" said Mrs. Senseman, as the cruel flames\r\nlapped round her; \"it is well! It is what I expected.\"\r\n\r\nNo longer could the Brethren's loyalty be doubted; and Spangenberg\r\nacted, on behalf of the British, with the skill of a military expert. As\r\nhe went about in his regimentals his critics remarked that he looked\r\nfar more like an army officer than an apostle of the Lord. For him the\r\nproblem to solve was, how to keep the Indians at bay; and he actually\r\nadvised the British authorities to construct a line of forts, pointed\r\nout the strategic importance of Gnadenhütten, and offered the land for\r\nmilitary purposes. At Bethlehem and the other Brethren's settlements\r\nhe had sentinels appointed and barricades constructed; at all specially\r\nvulnerable points he had blockhouses erected; and the result was that\r\nthe Brethren's settlements were among the safest places in the country.\r\nAt Bethlehem the Brethren sheltered six hundred fugitives. The plans of\r\nSpangenberg were successful. Not a single settlement was attacked.\r\nIn spite of the war and the general unsettlement, the business of the\r\n\"Economy\" went on as usual; the Brethren labouring in the harvest field\r\nwere protected by loyal Indians; and amid the panic the Brethren founded\r\nanother settlement at Lititz. Thus did Spangenberg, in a difficult\r\nsituation, act with consummate wisdom; and thus did he set an example of\r\nloyalty for Moravian missionaries to follow in days to come.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite his wisdom and zeal, the Moravian Church at this period\r\ndid not spread rapidly in America. For this, Zinzendorf was largely to\r\nblame. If the Count had been a good business man, and if he had realized\r\nthe importance of the American work, he would have left the management\r\nof that work entirely in Spangenberg's hands. But his treatment of\r\nSpangenberg was peculiar. At first he almost ignored his existence, and\r\nbroke his heart by not answering his letters (1744-48); and then, when\r\nhe found himself in trouble, and affairs at Herrnhaag were coming to a\r\ncrisis, he sent John de Watteville in hot haste to Bethlehem, summoned\r\nSpangenberg home, and kept him busy writing ponderous apologies. As\r\nsoon as Spangenberg had completed his task, and done his best to clear\r\nZinzendorf's character, he set off for Bethlehem again, and established\r\nthe Brethren's cause in North Carolina; but before he had been two years\r\nat work the Count was in financial difficulties, and summoned him home\r\nonce more (1753). His last stay in America was his longest (1754-1762).\r\nHe was still there when Zinzendorf died. As soon as Zinzendorf was laid\r\nin his grave the Brethren in Germany formed a Board of Management; but,\r\nbefore long, they discovered that they could not do without Spangenberg.\r\nHe left America for ever. And thus Brother Joseph was lost to America\r\nbecause he was indispensable in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of failure was the system of management. For the most\r\npart the men who took Spangenberg's place in America--such as John de\r\nWatteville and John Nitschmann--were obsessed with Zinzendorf's ideas\r\nabout settlements; and, instead of turning the numerous preaching places\r\ninto independent congregations they centralized the work round the four\r\nchief settlements of Bethlehem, Nazareth, Lititz and Salem. We have seen\r\nhow the settlement system worked in England. It had precisely the same\r\nresult in America.\r\n\r\nThe third cause of failure was financial complications. As long as\r\nSpangenberg was on the spot he kept the American finances independent;\r\nbut when he left for the last time the American Province was placed\r\nunder the direct control of the General Directing Board in Germany, the\r\nAmerican and German finances were mixed, the accounts became hopelessly\r\nconfused, and American affairs were mismanaged. It is obvious, on\r\nthe face of it, that a Directing Board with its seat in Germany was\r\nincapable of managing efficiently a difficult work four thousand miles\r\naway; and yet that was the system pursued for nearly a hundred years\r\n(1762-1857).\r\n\r\nWe come now to the brightest part of our American story--the work among\r\nthe Red Indians. At this period almost the whole of North America\r\nwas the home of numerous Indian tribes. Along the upper valley of the\r\nTennessee River, and among the grand hills of Georgia, Alabama, and\r\nWestern Alabama were the Cherokees. In Mississippi were the Natchez;\r\nnear the town of Augusta the Uchies; between the Tennessee and the Ohio,\r\nthe Mobilians; in Central Carolina, the Catawbas; to the west of\r\nthe Mississippi the Dahcotas; in New England, New Jersey, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, and the region stretching to the great lakes, the Delawares;\r\nand finally, in New York, Pennsylvania, and the region enclosed by Lakes\r\nHuron, Erie, and Ontario, the Iroquois. Thus, the Brethren in America\r\nwere surrounded by Indian tribes; and to those Indian tribes they\r\nundertook to preach the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe first step was taken by Christian Henry Rauch. As soon as he arrived\r\nin Pennsylvania he offered himself for the Indian Mission, went to the\r\nIndian town of Shekomeko {1740.}, and began to preach the Gospel in a\r\nmanner which became famous in Moravian history. First, at a Conference\r\nin Bethlehem, the story was told by Tschoop, one of his earliest\r\nconverts; and then it was officially quoted by Spangenberg, as a typical\r\nexample of the Brethren's method of preaching. \"Brethren,\" said Tschoop,\r\n\"I have been a heathen, and grown old among the heathen; therefore I\r\nknow how the heathen think. Once a preacher came and began to explain\r\nthat there was a God. We answered, 'Dost thou think us so ignorant as\r\nnot to know that? Go to the place whence thou camest!' Then, again,\r\nanother preacher came, and began to teach us, and to say, 'You must not\r\nsteal, nor lie, nor get drunk, and so forth.' We answered, 'Thou fool,\r\ndost thou think that we do not know that? Learn first thyself, and then\r\nteach the people to whom thou belongest to leave off these things. For\r\nwho steal, or lie, or who are more drunken than thine own people?' And\r\nthen we dismissed him.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rauch came with a very different message.\r\n\r\nHe told us of a Mighty One, the Lord of earth and sky, Who left His\r\nglory in the Heavens, for men to bleed and die; Who loved poor Indian\r\nsinners still, and longed to gain their love, And be their Saviour here\r\nand in His Father's house above.\r\n\r\nAnd when his tale was ended--\"My friends,\" he gently said, \"I am weary\r\nwith my journey, and would fain lay down my head; So beside our spears\r\nand arrows he laid him down to rest, And slept as sweetly as the babe\r\nupon its mother's breast.\r\n\r\nThen we looked upon each other, and I whispered, \"This is new; Yes, we\r\nhave heard glad tidings, and that sleeper knows them true; He knows he\r\nhas a Friend above, or would he slumber here, With men of war around\r\nhim, and the war-whoop in his ear.?\"\r\n\r\nSo we told him on the morrow that he need not journey on, But stay and\r\ntell us further of that loving, dying One; And thus we heard of Jesus\r\nfirst, and felt the wondrous power, Which makes His people willing, in\r\nHis own accepted hour.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" added Tschoop, \"through the grace of God an awakening took place\r\namong us. I say, therefore, Brethren, preach Christ our Saviour, and His\r\nsufferings and death, if you will have your words to gain entrance among\r\nthe heathen.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as Rauch had struck this note, the Brethren boldly\r\nundertook the task of preaching to all the Red Indians in North America.\r\nThe Count himself set off to spy the land, and undertook three dangerous\r\nmissionary journeys. First, accompanied by his daughter Benigna, and\r\nan escort of fourteen, he visited the Long Valley beyond the Blue\r\nMountains, met a delegation of the League of the Iroquois, and received\r\nfrom them, in solemn style, a fathom made of one hundred and sixty-eight\r\nstrings of wampum {1742.}. The fathom was a sign of goodwill. If a\r\nmissionary could only show the fathom he was sure of a kindly welcome.\r\nIn his second journey Zinzendorf went to Shekomeko, organised the first\r\nIndian Mission Church, and baptized three converts as Abraham, Isaac\r\nand Jacob. In his third journey he visited the Wyoming Valley, and\r\ninterviewed the chiefs of the Shawanese and Mohicans. He was here in\r\ndeadly peril. As he sat one afternoon in his tent two hissing adders\r\ndarted across his body; and a few days later some suspicious Indians\r\nplotted to take his life. But a government agent arrived on the scene,\r\nand Zinzendorf's scalp was saved.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Brethren began the campaign in earnest. At Bethlehem\r\nSpangenberg had a Mission Conference and a Mission College. The great\r\nhero of the work was David Zeisberger. He was, like most of these early\r\nmissionaries, a German. He was born at Zauchtenthal, in Moravia; had\r\ncome with his parents to Herrnhut; had followed them later to Georgia;\r\nand was now a student at Spangenberg's College at Bethlehem. For\r\nsixty-three years he lived among the Indians, and his life was one\r\ncontinual series of thrilling adventures and escapes. He became almost\r\nan Indian. He was admitted a member of the Six Nations, received an\r\nIndian name, and became a member of an Indian family. He was an Iroquois\r\nto the Iroquois, a Delaware to the Delawares. He understood the\r\nhidden science of belts and strings of wampum; he could unriddle their\r\nmysterious messages and make speeches in their bombastic style; and he\r\nspoke in their speech and thought in their thoughts, and lived their\r\nlife in their wigwams. He loved their majestic prairies, stretching\r\nbeyond the Blue Mountains. He loved their mighty rivers and their deep\r\nclear lakes. Above all, he loved the red-brown Indians themselves.\r\nFull well he knew what trials awaited him. If the reader has formed\r\nhis conception of the Indians from Fenimore Cooper's novels, he will\r\nprobably think that Zeisberger spent his life among a race of gallant\r\nheroes. The reality was rather different. For the most part the Indians\r\nof North America were the reverse of heroic. They were bloodthirsty,\r\ndrunken, lewd and treacherous. They spent their time in hunting\r\nbuffaloes, smoking pipes, lolling in the sun, and scalping each other's\r\nheads. They wasted their nights in tipsy revels and dances by the light\r\nof the moon. They cowered in terror of evil spirits and vicious and\r\nangry gods. But Zeisberger never feared and never despaired. As long as\r\nhe had such a grand Gospel to preach, he felt sure that he could make\r\nthese savages sober, pure, wise, kind and brave, and that God would\r\never shield him with His wing. He has been called \"The Apostle to the\r\nIndians.\" As the missionaries of the early Christian Church came to our\r\nrude fathers in England, and made us a Christian people, so Zeisberger\r\ndesired to be an Augustine to the Indians, and found a Christian Indian\r\nkingdom stretching from Lake Michigan to the Ohio.\r\n\r\nHe began his work with the League of the Iroquois, commonly called\r\nthe Six Nations {1745.}. At Onondaga, their headquarters, where he and\r\nBishop Cammerhof had arranged to meet the Great Council, the meeting\r\nhad to be postponed till the members had recovered from a state of\r\nintoxication. But Cammerhof addressed the chiefs, brought out the\r\nsoothing pipe of tobacco, watched it pass from mouth to mouth, and\r\nreceived permission for two missionaries to come and settle down.\r\nFrom there, still accompanied by Cammerhof, Zeisberger went on to the\r\nSenecas. He was welcomed to a Pandemonium of revelry. The whole village\r\nwas drunk. As he lay in his tent he could hear fiendish yells rend the\r\nair; he went out with a kettle, to get some water for Cammerhof, and the\r\nsavages knocked the kettle out of his hand; and later, when the shades\r\nof evening fell, he had to defend himself with his fists against a bevy\r\nof lascivious women, whose long hair streamed in the night wind, and\r\nwhose lips swelled with passion. For Cammerhof the journey was too much;\r\nin the bloom of youth he died (1751).\r\n\r\nBut Zeisberger had a frame of steel. Passing on from tribe to tribe, he\r\nstrode through darkling woods, through tangled thickets, through miry\r\nsloughs, through swarms of mosquitoes; and anon, plying his swift canoe,\r\nhe sped through primeval forests, by flowers of the tulip tree,\r\nthrough roaring rapids, round beetling bluffs, past groups of mottled\r\nrattlesnakes that lay basking in the sun. At the present time, in many\r\nMoravian manses, may be seen an engraving of a picture by Schüssele,\r\nof Philadelphia, representing Zeisberger preaching to the Indians. The\r\nincident occurred at Goschgoschünk, on the Alleghany River (1767). In\r\nthe picture the service is represented as being held in the open air; in\r\nreality it was held in the Council House. In the centre of the house was\r\nthe watch-fire. Around it squatted the Indians--the men on one side, the\r\nwomen on the other; and among those men were murderers who had played\r\ntheir part, twelve years before, in the massacre on the Mahony River.\r\nAs soon as Zeisberger rose to speak, every eye was fixed upon him; and\r\nwhile he delivered his Gospel message, he knew that at any moment a\r\ntomahawk might cleave his skull, and his scalp hang bleeding at the\r\nmurderer's girdle. \"Never yet,\" he wrote, \"did I see so clearly\r\npainted on the faces of the Indians both the darkness of hell and the\r\nworld-subduing power of the Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nAs the years rolled on, this dauntless hero won completely the\r\nconfidence of these suspicious savages. He was known as \"Friend of the\r\nIndians,\" and was allowed to move among them at his ease. In vain the\r\nsorcerers plotted against him. \"Beware,\" they said to the simple people,\r\n\"of the man in the black coat.\" At times, in order to bring down the\r\nvengeance of the spirits on Zeisberger's head, they sat up through the\r\nnight and gorged themselves with swine's flesh; and, when this mode of\r\nenchantment failed, they baked themselves in hot ovens till they became\r\nunconscious. Zeisberger still went boldly on. Wherever the Indians were\r\nmost debauched, there was he in the midst of them. Both the Six Nations\r\nand the Delawares passed laws that he was to be uninterrupted in\r\nhis work. Before him the haughtiest chieftains bowed in awe. At\r\nLavunakhannek, on the Alleghany River, he met the great Delaware orator,\r\nGlikkikan, who had baffled Jesuits and statesmen, and had prepared a\r\ncomplicated speech with which he meant to crush Zeisberger for ever;\r\nbut when the two men came face to face, the orator fell an easy victim,\r\nforgot his carefully prepared oration, murmured meekly: \"I have nothing\r\nto say; I believe your words,\" submitted to Zeisberger like a child,\r\nand became one of his warmest friends and supporters. In like manner\r\nZeisberger won over White Eyes, the famous Delaware captain; and, hand\r\nin hand, Zeisberger and White Eyes worked for the same great cause. \"I\r\nwant my people,\" said White Eyes, \"now that peace is established in the\r\ncountry, to turn their attention to peace in their hearts. I want them\r\nto embrace that religion which is taught by the white teachers. We shall\r\nnever be happy until we are Christians.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though that time were drawing nigh {1765-81.}. Zeisberger\r\nwas a splendid organizer. As soon as the \"Indian War\" was over, he\r\nfounded a number of Christian settlements, and taught the Indians the\r\narts of industry and peace. For the Iroquois he founded the settlements\r\nof Friedenshütten (Tents of Peace), on the Susquehanna, Goschgoschünk,\r\non the Alleghany, and Lavunakhannek and Friedenstadt (Town of Peace),\r\non the Beaver River; and for the Delawares he founded the settlements of\r\nSchönbrunn (Beautiful Spring), Gnadenhütten (Tents of Grace), Lichtenau\r\n(Meadow of Light), on the Tuscawaras, and Salem, on the Muskinghum. His\r\nsettlements were like diamonds flashing in the darkness. Instead of the\r\nwildness of the desert were nut trees, plums, cherries, mulberries and\r\nall manner of fruits; instead of scattered wigwams, orderly streets of\r\nhuts; instead of filth, neatness and cleanliness; instead of drunken\r\nbrawls and orgies, the voice of children at the village school, and the\r\nvoice of morning and evening prayer.\r\n\r\nNo longer were the Indians in these settlements wild hunters. They were\r\nnow steady business men. They conducted farms, cultivated gardens, grew\r\ncorn and sugar, made butter, and learned to manage their local affairs\r\nas well as an English Urban District Council. At the head of each\r\nsettlement was a Governing Board, consisting of the Missionaries and the\r\nnative \"helpers\"; and all affairs of special importance were referred\r\nto a general meeting of the inhabitants. The system filled the minds of\r\nvisitors with wonder. \"The Indians in Zeisberger's settlements,\" said\r\nColonel Morgan, \"are an example to civilized whites.\"\r\n\r\nNo longer, further, were the Indians ignorant savages. Zeisberger was a\r\ngreat linguist. He mastered the Delaware and Iroquois languages. For the\r\nbenefit of the converts in his setlements, and with the assistance of\r\nIndian sachems, he prepared and had printed a number of useful books:\r\nfirst (1776), \"A Delaware Indian and English Spelling-book,\" with\r\nan appendix containing the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, some\r\nScripture passages and a Litany; next (1803), in the Delaware language,\r\n\"A Collection of Hymns for the use of the Christian Indians,\" translated\r\nfrom the English and German Moravian Hymn-books, and including the\r\nEaster, Baptismal and Burial Litanies; next, a volume of \"Sermons\r\nto Children,\" translated from the German; next, a translation of\r\nSpangenberg's \"Bodily Care of Children\"; next, \"A Harmony of the Four\r\nGospels,\" translated from the Harmony prepared by Samuel Leiberkühn;\r\nand last, a grammatical treatise on the Delaware conjugations. Of\r\nhis services to philology, I need not speak in detail. He prepared a\r\nlexicon, in seven volumes, of the German and Onondaga languages, an\r\nOnondaga Grammar, a Delaware Grammar, a German-Delaware Dictionary, and\r\nother works of a similar nature. As these contributions to science\r\nwere never published, they may not seem of much importance; but his\r\nmanuscripts have been carefully preserved, some in the library of the\r\nPhilosophical Society at Philadelphia, others at Harvard University.\r\n\r\nThus did Zeisberger, explorer and scholar, devote his powers to the\r\nphysical, moral and spiritual improvement of the Indians. For some\r\nyears his success was brilliant; and when, on Easter Sunday morning, his\r\nconverts gathered for the early service, they presented a scene unlike\r\nany other in the world. As the sun rose red beyond the great Blue\r\nMountains, as the morning mists broke gently away, as the gemmed trees\r\nwhispered with the breath of spring, the Indians repeated in their\r\nlonely cemetery the same solemn Easter Litany that the Brethren repeated\r\nat Herrnhut, Zeisberger read the Confession of Faith, a trained choir\r\nled the responses, the Easter hymn swelled out, and the final \"Amen\"\r\nrang over the plateau and aroused the hosts of the woodland.\r\n\r\n   Away in the forest, how fair to the sight\r\n   Was the clear, placid lake as it sparkled in light,\r\n   And kissed with low murmur the green shady shore,\r\n   Whence a tribe had departed, whose traces it bore.\r\n   Where the lone Indian hastened, and wondering hushed\r\n   His awe as he trod o'er the mouldering dust!\r\n   How bright were the waters--how cheerful the song,\r\n   Which the wood-bird was chirping all the day long,\r\n   And how welcome the refuge those solitudes gave\r\n   To the pilgrims who toiled over mountain and wave;\r\n   Here they rested--here gushed forth, salvation to bring,\r\n   The fount of the Cross, by the \"Beautiful Spring.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet the name of this wonderful man is almost unknown in England. We\r\nare just coming to the reason. At the very time when his influence was\r\nat its height the American War of Independence broke out, and Zeisberger\r\nand his converts, as an Indian orator put it, were between two exceeding\r\nmighty and wrathful gods, who stood opposed with extended jaws. Each\r\nparty wished the Indians to take up arms on its side. But Zeisberger\r\nurged them to be neutral. When the English sent the hatchet of war to\r\nthe Delawares, the Delawares politely sent it back. When a letter came\r\nto Zeisberger, requesting him to arouse his converts, to put himself\r\nat their head, and to bring the scalps of all the rebels he could\r\nslaughter, he threw the sheet into the flames. For this policy he was\r\nsuspected by both sides. At one time he was accused before an English\r\ncourt of being in league with the Americans. At another time he was\r\naccused by the Americans of being in league with the English. At length\r\nthe thunderbolt fell. As the Christian Indians of Gnadenhütten were\r\nengaged one day in tilling the soil, the American troops of Colonel\r\nWilliamson appeared upon the scene, asked for quarters, were\r\ncomfortably, lodged, and then, disarming the innocent victims, accused\r\nthem of having sided with the British. For that accusation the only\r\nground was that the Indians had shown hospitality to all who demanded\r\nit; but this defence was not accepted, and Colonel Williamson decided\r\nto put the whole congregation to death {March 28th, 1782.}. The log huts\r\nwere turned into shambles; the settlers were allowed a few minutes for\r\nprayer; then, in couples, they were summoned to their doom; and in cold\r\nblood the soldiers, with tomahawks, mallets, clubs, spears and scalping\r\nknives, began the work of butchery. At the end of the performance ninety\r\ncorpses lay dabbled with blood on the ground. Among the victims were\r\nsix National Assistants, a lady who could speak English and German,\r\ntwenty-four other women, eleven boys and eleven girls. The Blood-Bath of\r\nGnadenhütten was a hideous crime. It shattered the Indian Mission. The\r\ngrand plans of Zeisberger collapsed in ruin. As the war raged on, and\r\nwhite men encroached more and more on Indian soil, he found himself and\r\nhis converts driven by brute force from one settlement after another.\r\nAlready, before the war broke out, this brutal process had commenced;\r\nand altogether it continued for twenty years. In 1769 he had to abandon\r\nGoschgoschünk; in 1770, Lavunakhannek; in 1772, Friedenshütten; in\r\n1773, Friedenstadt; in 1780, Lichtenau; in 1781, Gnadenhütten, Salem\r\nand Schönbrunn; in 1782, Sandusky; in 1786, New Gnadenhütten; in 1787,\r\nPilgerruh; in 1791, New Salem. As the old man drew near his end, he\r\nendeavoured to stem the torrent of destruction by founding two new\r\nsettlements--Fairfield, in Canada, and Goshen, on the Tuscawaras; but\r\neven these had to be abandoned a few years after his death. Amid\r\nthe Indians he had lived; amid the Indians, at Goshen, he lay on his\r\ndeath-bed {1808.}. As the news of his approaching dissolution spread,\r\nthe chapel bell was tolled: his converts, knowing the signal, entered\r\nthe room; and then, uniting their voices in song, they sang him home in\r\ntriumphant hymns which he himself had translated from the hymns of the\r\nAncient Brethren's Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. -- THE LAST DAYS OF ZINZENDORF, 1755-1760.\r\n\r\nAs Zinzendorf drew near to his end, he saw that his efforts in the cause\r\nof Christ had not ended as he had hoped. His design was the union of\r\nChristendom, his achievement the revival of the Church of the Brethren.\r\nHe had given the \"Hidden Seed\" a home at Herrnhut. He had discovered the\r\nancient laws of the Bohemian Brethren. He had maintained, first, for the\r\nsake of the Missions, and, secondly, for the sake of his Brethren, the\r\nBrethren's Episcopal Succession. He had founded the Pilgrim Band at\r\nMarienborn, had begun the Diaspora work in the Baltic Provinces, had\r\ngained for the Brethren legal recognition in Germany, England and North\r\nAmerica, and had given the stimulus to the work of foreign missions. At\r\nthe same time, he had continually impressed his own religious ideas upon\r\nhis followers; and thus the Renewed Church of the Brethren was a Church\r\nof a twofold nature. The past and the present were dove-tailed. From\r\nthe Bohemian Brethren came the strict discipline, the ministerial\r\nsuccession, and the martyr-spirit; from Zinzendorf the idea of\r\n\"Church within the Church,\" the stress laid on the great doctrine of\r\nreconciliation through the blood of Christ, and the fiery missionary\r\nenthusiasm. Without Zinzendorf the Bohemian Brethren would probably have\r\nnever returned to life; and without the fibre of the Bohemian Brethren,\r\nGerman Pietism would have died a natural death.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, keep clear of one misconception. Whatever else the\r\nRenewed Church of the Brethren was, it did not spring from a union of\r\nraces. It was not a fusion of German and Czech elements. As the first\r\nsettlers at Herrnhut came from Moravia, it is natural to regard them as\r\nMoravian Czechs; but the truth is that they were Germans in blood, and\r\nspoke the German language. It was, therefore, the German element of the\r\nold Brethren's Church that formed the backbone of the Renewed Church. It\r\nwas Germans, not Czechs, who began the foreign missionary work; Germans\r\nwho came to England, and Germans who renewed the Brethren's Church\r\nin America. In due time pure Czechs from Bohemia came and settled at\r\nRixdorf and Niesky; but, speaking broadly, the Renewed Church of the\r\nBrethren was revived by German men with German ideas.\r\n\r\nAs the Church, therefore, was now established in the three provinces of\r\nGermany, Great Britain and North America, one problem only still awaited\r\nsolution. The problem was the welding of the provinces. That welding was\r\nbrought about in a simple way. If the reader is of a thoughtful turn of\r\nmind, he must have wondered more than once where the Brethren found\r\nthe money to carry on their enterprises. They had relied chiefly on\r\ntwo sources of income: first, Zinzendorf's estates; second, a number\r\nof business concerns known as Diaconies. As long as these Diaconies\r\nprospered, the Brethren were able to keep their heads above water; but\r\nthe truth is, they had been mismanaged. The Church was now on the verge\r\nof bankruptcy; and, therefore, the Brethren held at Taubenheim the\r\nso-called \"Economical Conference.\" {1755.}\r\n\r\nIn the time of need came the deliverer, Frederick Köber. His five\r\nmeasures proved the salvation of the Church. First, he separated\r\nthe property of Zinzendorf from the general property of the Church.\r\nSecondly, he put this general property under the care of a \"College\r\nof Directors.\" Thirdly, he made an arrangement whereby this \"College\"\r\nshould pay off all debts in fixed yearly sums. Fourthly, he proposed\r\nthat all members of the Church should pay a fixed annual sum to general\r\nChurch funds. And fifthly, on the sound principle that those who pay\r\nare entitled to a vote, he suggested that in future all members of the\r\nChurch should have the right to send representatives to the General\r\nDirecting Board or Conference. In this way he drew the outlines of the\r\nMoravian Church Constitution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Count Zinzendorf's end was drawing near. The evening of his\r\nlife he spent at Herrnhut, for where more fitly could he die?\r\n\r\n\"It will be better,\" he said, \"when I go home; the Conferences will last\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe employed his last days in revising the Text-book, which was to be\r\ndaily food for the Pilgrim Church {1760.}; and when he wrote down the\r\nfinal words, \"And the King turned His face about, and blessed all the\r\ncongregation of Israel,\" his last message to the Brethren was delivered.\r\nAs his illness--a violent catarrhal fever--gained the mastery over him,\r\nhe was cheered by the sight of the numerous friends who gathered round\r\nhim. His band of workers watched by his couch in turn. On the last night\r\nabout a hundred Brethren and Sisters assembled in the death chamber.\r\nJohn de Watteville sat by the bedside.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear friend,\" said the dying Count, \"I am going to the Saviour.\r\nI am ready. I bow to His will. He is satisfied with me. If He does not\r\nwant me here any more, I am ready to go to Him. There is nothing to\r\nhinder me now.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked around upon his friends. \"I cannot say,\" he said, \"how much I\r\nlove you all. Who would have believed that the prayer of Christ, 'That\r\nthey may be one,' could have been so strikingly fulfilled among us. I\r\nonly asked for first-fruits among the heathen, and thousands have been\r\ngiven me...Are we not as in Heaven? Do we not live together like the\r\nangels? The Lord and His servants understand one another...I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on towards morning, the scene, says one who was\r\npresent, was noble, charming, liturgical. At ten o'clock, his breathing\r\ngrew feebler {May 9th, 1760.}; and John de Watteville pronounced the Old\r\nTestament Benediction, \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make\r\nHis face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up His\r\ncountenance upon thee and give thee peace.\" As de Watteville spoke the\r\nlast words of the blessing, the Count lay back on his pillow and closed\r\nhis eyes; and a few seconds later he breathed no more.\r\n\r\nAt Herrnhut it is still the custom to announce the death of any member\r\nof the congregation by a chorale played on trombones; and when the\r\ntrombones sounded that morning all knew that Zinzendorf's earthly\r\ncareer had closed. The air was thick with mist. \"It seemed,\" said John\r\nNitschmann, then minister at Herrnhut, \"as though nature herself were\r\nweeping.\" As the Count's body lay next day in the coffin, arrayed in the\r\nrobe he had worn so often when conducting the Holy Communion, the whole\r\ncongregation, choir by choir, came to gaze for the last time upon his\r\nface. For a week after this the coffin remained closed; but on the\r\nfuneral day it was opened again, and hundreds from the neighbouring\r\ntowns and villages came crowding into the chamber. At the funeral all\r\nthe Sisters were dressed in white; and the number of mourners was over\r\nfour thousand. At this time there were present in Herrnhut Moravian\r\nministers from Holland, England, Ireland, North America and Greenland;\r\nand these, along with the German ministers, took turns as pall-bearers.\r\nThe trombones sounded. John Nitschmann, as precentor, started the hymn;\r\nthe procession to the Hutberg began. As the coffin was lowered into the\r\ngrave some verses were sung, and then John Nitschmann spoke the words:\r\n\"With tears we sow this seed in the earth; but He, in his own good time,\r\nwill bring it to life, and will gather in His harvest with thanks and\r\npraise! Let all who wish for this say, 'Amen.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" responded the vast, weeping throng. The inscription on the\r\ngrave-stone is as follows: \"Here lie the remains of that immortal man of\r\nGod, Nicholas Lewis, Count and Lord of Zinzendorf and Pottendorf; who,\r\nthrough the grace of God and his own unwearied service, became the\r\nhonoured Ordinary of the Brethren's Church, renewed in this eighteenth\r\ncentury. He was born at Dresden on May 26th, 1700, and entered into the\r\njoy of his Lord at Herrnhut on May 9th, 1760. He was appointed to bring\r\nforth fruit, and that his fruit should remain.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in a halo of tearful glory, the Count-Bishop was laid to rest. For\r\nmany years the Brethren cherished his memory, not only with affection,\r\nbut with veneration; and even the sober Spangenberg described him as\r\n\"the great treasure of our times, a lovely diamond in the ring on the\r\nhand of our Lord, a servant of the Lord without an equal, a pillar in\r\nthe house of the Lord, God's message to His people.\" But history hardly\r\njustifies this generous eulogy; and Spangenberg afterwards admitted\r\nhimself that Zinzendorf had two sides to his character. \"It may seem a\r\nparadox,\" he wrote, \"but it really does seem a fact that a man cannot\r\nhave great virtues without also having great faults.\" The case of\r\nZinzendorf is a case in point. At a Synod held a few years later (1764),\r\nthe Brethren commissioned Spangenberg to write a \"Life of Zinzendorf.\"\r\nAs the Count, however, had been far from perfect, they had to face the\r\nserious question whether Spangenberg should be allowed to expose his\r\nfaults to public gaze. They consulted the Lot: the Lot said \"No\"; and,\r\ntherefore, they solemnly warned Spangenberg that, in order to avoid\r\ncreating a false impression, he was \"to leave out everything which\r\nwould not edify the public.\" The loyal Spangenberg obeyed. His \"Life of\r\nZinzendorf\" appeared in eight large volumes. He desired, of course, to\r\nbe honest; he was convinced, to use his own words, that \"an historian is\r\nresponsible to God and men for the truth\"; and yet, though he told\r\nthe truth, he did not tell the whole truth. The result was lamentable.\r\nInstead of a life-like picture of Zinzendorf, the reader had only\r\na shaded portrait, in which both the beauties and the defects were\r\ncarefully toned down. The English abridged edition was still more\r\ncolourless.[136] For a hundred years the character of Zinzendorf lay\r\nhidden beneath a pile of pious phrases, and only the recent researches\r\nof scholars have enabled us to see him as he was. He was no mere\r\ncommonplace Pietist. He was no mere pious German nobleman, converted by\r\nlooking at a picture. His faults and his virtues stood out in glaring\r\nrelief. His very appearance told the dual tale. As he strolled the\r\nstreets of Berlin or London, the wayfarers instinctively moved to let\r\nhim pass, and all men admired his noble bearing, his lofty brow, his\r\nfiery dark blue eye, and his firm set lips; and yet, on the other hand,\r\nthey could not fail to notice that he was untidy in his dress, that\r\nhe strode on, gazing at the stars, and that often, in his\r\nabsent-mindedness, he stumbled and staggered in his gait. In his\r\nportraits we can read the same double story. In some the prevailing\r\ntone is dignity; in others there is the faint suggestion of a smirk. His\r\nfaults were those often found in men of genius. He was nearly always in\r\na hurry, and was never in time for dinner. He was unsystematic in his\r\nhabits, and incompetent in money matters. He was rather imperious in\r\ndisposition, and sometimes overbearing in his conduct. He was impatient\r\nat any opposition, and disposed to treat with contempt the advice of\r\nothers. For example, when the financial crisis arose at Herrnhaag,\r\nSpangenberg advised him to raise funds by weekly collections; but\r\nZinzendorf brushed the advice aside, and retorted, \"It is my affair.\" He\r\nwas rather short-tempered, and would stamp his foot like an angry child\r\nif a bench in the church was not placed exactly as he desired. He\r\nwas superstitious in his use of the Lot, and damaged the cause of the\r\nBrethren immensely by teaching them to trust implicitly to its guidance.\r\nHe was reckless in his use of extravagant language; and he forgot that\r\npublic men should consider, not only what they mean themselves, but also\r\nwhat impression their words are likely to make upon others. He was\r\nnot always strictly truthful; and in one of his pamphlets he actually\r\nasserted that he himself was in no way responsible for the scandals\r\nat Herrnhaag. For these reasons the Count made many enemies. He was\r\ncriticized severely, and sometimes justly, by men of such exalted\r\ncharacter as Bengel, the famous German commentator, and honest John\r\nWesley in England; he was reviled by vulgar scribblers like Rimius; and\r\nthus, like his great contemporary, Whitefield, he\r\n\r\n   Stood pilloried on Infamy's high stage,\r\n   And bore the pelting scorn of half an age;\r\n   The very butt of slander and the blot\r\n   For every dart that malice ever shot.\r\n\r\nBut serious though his failings were, they were far outshone by his\r\nvirtues. Of all the religious leaders of the eighteenth century, he\r\nwas the most original in genius and the most varied in talent; and,\r\ntherefore, he was the most misunderstood, the most fiercely hated, the\r\nmost foully libelled, the most shamefully attacked, and the most fondly\r\nadored. In his love for Christ he was like St. Bernard, in his mystic\r\ndevotion like Madame Guyon; and Herder, the German poet, described him\r\nas \"a conqueror in the spiritual world.\" It was those who knew him best\r\nwho admired him most. By the world at large he was despised, by orthodox\r\ncritics abused, by the Brethren honoured, by his intimate friends almost\r\nworshipped. According to many orthodox Lutherans he was an atheist;\r\nbut the Brethren commonly called him \"the Lord's disciple.\" He was\r\nabstemious in diet, cared little for wine, and drank chiefly tea and\r\nlemonade. He was broad and Catholic in his views, refused to speak of\r\nthe Pope as Antichrist, and referred to members of the Church of Rome as\r\n\"Brethren\"; and, while he remained a Lutheran to the end, he had friends\r\nin every branch of the Church of Christ. He had not a drop of malice in\r\nhis blood. He never learned the art of bearing a grudge, and when he was\r\nreviled, he never reviled again. He was free with his money, and could\r\nnever refuse a beggar. He was a thoughtful and suggestive theological\r\nwriter, and holds a high place in the history of dogma; and no thinker\r\nexpounded more beautifully than he the grand doctrine that the innermost\r\nnature of God is revealed in all its glory to man in the Person of the\r\nsuffering Man Christ Jesus. He was a beautiful Christian poet; his\r\nhymns are found to-day in every collection; his \"Jesus, Thy blood and\r\nrighteousness\" was translated into English by John Wesley; and his noble\r\n\"Jesus, still lead on!\" is as popular in the cottage homes of Germany as\r\nNewman's \"Lead, kindly light\" in England. Of the three great qualities\r\nrequired in a poet, Zinzendorf, however, possessed only two. He had the\r\nsensibility; he had the imagination; but he rarely had the patience to\r\ntake pains; and, therefore, nearly all his poetry is lacking in finish\r\nand artistic beauty. He was an earnest social reformer; he endeavoured,\r\nby means of his settlement system, to solve the social problem; and his\r\nefforts to uplift the working classes were praised by the famous German\r\ncritic, Lessing. The historian and theologian, Albrecht Ritschl, has\r\naccused him of sectarian motives and of wilfully creating a split in the\r\nLutheran Church. The accusation is absolutely false. There is nothing\r\nmore attractive in the character of Zinzendorf than his unselfish\r\ndevotion to one grand ideal. On one occasion, after preaching at Berlin,\r\nhe met a young lieutenant. The lieutenant was in spiritual trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Let me ask you,\" said Zinzendorf, \"one question: Are you alone in your\r\nreligious troubles, or do you share them with others?\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant replied that some friends and he were accustomed to pray\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"That is right,\" said Zinzendorf. \"I acknowledge no Christianity without\r\nfellowship.\"\r\n\r\nIn those words he pointed to the loadstar of his life. For that holy\r\ncause of Christian fellowship he spent every breath in his body and\r\nevery ducat in his possession. For that cause he laboured among the\r\npeasants of Berthelsdorf, in the streets of Berlin, in the smiling\r\nWetterau, in the Baltic Provinces, on the shores of Lake Geneva, in the\r\nwilds of Yorkshire, by the silver Thames, on West Indian plantations,\r\nand in the wigwams of the Iroquois and the Delaware. It is not always\r\nfair to judge of men by their conduct. We must try, when possible, to\r\nfind the ruling motive; and in motive Zinzendorf was always unselfish.\r\nSometimes he was guilty of reckless driving; but his wagon was hitched\r\nto a star. No man did more to revive the Moravian Church, and no man did\r\nmore, by his very ideals, to retard her later expansion. It is here that\r\nwe can see most clearly the contrast between Zinzendorf and John Wesley.\r\nIn genius Zinzendorf easily bore the palm; in practical wisdom the\r\nEnglishman far excelled him. The one was a poet, a dreamer, a thinker, a\r\nmystic; the other a practical statesman, who added nothing to religious\r\nthought, and yet uplifted millions of his fellow men. At a Synod of the\r\nBrethren held at Herrnhut (1818), John Albertini, the eloquent preacher,\r\ndescribed the key-note of Zinzendorf's life. \"It was love to Christ,\"\r\nsaid Albertini, \"that glowed in the heart of the child; the same\r\nlove that burned in the young man; the same love that thrilled his\r\nmiddle-age; the same love that inspired his every endeavour.\" In action\r\nfaulty, in motive pure; in judgment erring, in ideals divine; in policy\r\nwayward, in purpose unselfish and true; such was Zinzendorf, the Renewer\r\nof the Church of the Brethren.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THREE. -- THE RULE OF THE GERMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. -- THE CHURCH AND HER MISSION, OR THE THREE CONSTITUTIONAL SYNODS, 1760-1775.\r\n\r\nAs we enter on the closing stages of our journey, the character of the\r\nlandscape changes; and, leaving behind the wild land of romance and\r\nadventure, we come out on the broad, high road of slow but steady\r\nprogress. The death of Zinzendorf was no crushing blow. At first some\r\nenemies of the Brethren rejoiced, and one prophet triumphantly remarked:\r\n\"We shall now see an end of these Moravians.\" But that time the prophet\r\nspoke without his mantle. Already the Brethren were sufficiently strong\r\nto realize their calling in the world. In Saxony they had established\r\npowerful congregations at Herrnhut and Kleinwelke; in Silesia, at\r\nNiesky, Gnadenberg, Gnadenfrei and Neusalz; in Central Germany, at\r\nEbersdorf, Neudietendorf and Barby; in North Germany, at Rixdorf and\r\nBerlin; in West Germany, at Neuwied-on-the-Rhine; in Holland, at Zeist,\r\nnear Utrecht. At first sight this list does not look very impressive;\r\nbut we must, of course, bear in mind that most of these congregations\r\nwere powerful settlements, that each settlement was engaged in Diaspora\r\nwork, and that the branches of that work had extended to Denmark,\r\nSwitzerland and Norway. In Great Britain a similar principle held good.\r\nIn England the Brethren had flourishing causes at Fulneck, Gomersal,\r\nMirfield, Wyke, Ockbrook, Bedford, Fetter Lane, Tytherton, Dukinfield,\r\nLeominster; in Ireland, at Dublin, Gracehill, Gracefield, Ballinderry\r\nand Kilwarlin; and around each of these congregations were numerous\r\nsocieties and preaching places. In North America they had congregations\r\nat Bethlehem, Emmaus, Graceham, Lancaster, Lititz, Nazareth, New Dorp,\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, Schoeneck and York (York Co.); and in\r\naddition, a number of preaching places. In Greenland they had built the\r\nsettlements of New Herrnhut and Lichtenau. In the West Indies they had\r\nestablished congregations in St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. Jan, Jamaica\r\nand Antigua. In Berbice and Surinam they had three main centres of\r\nwork. Among the Red Indians Zeisberger was busily engaged. As accurate\r\nstatistics are not available, I am not able to state exactly how\r\nmany Moravians there were then in the world; but we know that in the\r\nmission-field alone they had over a thousand communicant members and\r\nseven thousand adherents under their special care.\r\n\r\nAs soon, then, as the leading Brethren in Herrnhut--such as John de\r\nWatteville, Leonard Dober, David Nitschmann, the Syndic, Frederick\r\nKöber, and others--had recovered from the shock occasioned by\r\nZinzendorf's death, they set about the difficult task of organizing\r\nthe work of the whole Moravian Church. First, they formed a provisional\r\nBoard of Directors, known as the Inner Council; next, they despatched\r\ntwo messengers to America, to summon the practical Spangenberg home\r\nto take his place on the board; and then, at the earliest convenient\r\nopportunity, they summoned their colleagues to Marienborn for the first\r\nGeneral Representative Synod of the Renewed Church of the Brethren.\r\nAs the Count had left the affairs of the Church in confusion, the\r\ntask before the Brethren was enormous {1764.}. They had their Church\r\nconstitution to frame; they had their finances to straighten out; they\r\nhad their mission in the world to define; they had, in a word, to bring\r\norder out of chaos; and so difficult did they find the task that eleven\r\nyears passed away before it was accomplished to any satisfaction. For\r\nthirty years they had been half blinded by the dazzling brilliance of\r\nZinzendorf; but now they began to see a little more clearly. As long\r\nas Zinzendorf was in their midst, an orderly system of government was\r\nimpossible. It was now an absolute necessity. The reign of one man was\r\nover; the period of constitutional government began. At all costs, said\r\nthe sensible Frederick Köber, the Count must have no successor. For the\r\nfirst time the Synod was attended by duly elected congregation deputies:\r\nthose deputies came not only from Germany, but from Great Britain,\r\nAmerica and the mission-field; and thus the voice of the Synod was the\r\nvoice, not of one commanding genius, but of the whole Moravian Church.\r\n\r\nThe first question to settle was the Church's Mission. For what purpose\r\ndid the Moravian Church exist? To that question the Brethren gave a\r\nthreefold answer. First, they said, they must labour in the whole\r\nworld; second, their fundamental doctrine must be the doctrine of\r\nreconciliation through the merits of the life and sufferings of Christ\r\nas set forth in the Holy Scriptures and in the Augsburg Confession; and,\r\nthird, in their settlements they would continue to enforce that strict\r\ndiscipline--including the separation of the sexes--without which the\r\nGospel message would be a mockery. Thus the world was their parish, the\r\ncross their message, the system of discipline their method.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Brethren framed their constitution. Of all the laws ever\r\npassed by the Brethren, those passed at the first General Synod had,\r\nfor nearly a hundred years (1764-1857), the greatest influence on the\r\nprogress of the Moravian Church. The keyword is \"centralization.\" If\r\nthe Church was to be a united body, that Church, held the Brethren, must\r\nhave a central court of appeal, a central administrative board, and\r\na central legislative authority. At this first Constitutional\r\nSynod, therefore, the Brethren laid down the following principles of\r\ngovernment: That all power to make rules and regulations touching the\r\nfaith and practice of the Church should be vested in the General Synod;\r\nthat this General Synod should consist of all bishops and ministers of\r\nthe Church and of duly elected congregation deputies; that no deputy\r\nshould be considered duly elected unless his election had been confirmed\r\nby the Lot; and that during an inter-synodal period the supreme\r\nmanagement of Church affairs should be in the hands of three directing\r\nboards, which should all be elected by the Synod, and be responsible to\r\nthe next Synod. The first board was the Supreme Board of Management. It\r\nwas called the Directory, and consisted of nine Brethren. The second was\r\nthe Brethren's ministry of foreign affairs. It was called the Board of\r\nSyndics, and managed the Church's relations with governments. The third\r\nwas the Brethren's treasury. It was called the Unity's Warden's Board,\r\nand managed the Church finances. For us English readers, however, the\r\nchief point to notice is that, although these boards were elected by\r\nthe General Synod, and although, in theory, they were international\r\nin character, in actual fact they consisted entirely of Germans;\r\nand, therefore, we have the astounding situation that during the next\r\nninety-three years the whole work of the Moravian Church--in Germany,\r\nin Holland, in Denmark, in Great Britain, in North America, and in\r\nthe rapidly extending mission-field--was managed by a board or boards\r\nconsisting of Germans and resident in Germany. There all General Synods\r\nwere held; there lay all supreme administrative and legislative power.\r\n\r\nOf local self-government there was practically none. It is true that\r\nso-called \"Provincial Synods\" were held; but these Synods had no power\r\nto make laws. At this period the Moravian Church was divided, roughly,\r\ninto the six Provinces of Upper Lusatia, Silesia, Holland, England,\r\nIreland, and America; and in each of these Provinces Synods might be\r\nheld. But a Provincial Synod was a Synod only in name. \"A Provincial\r\nSynod,\" ran the law, \"is an assembly of the ministers and deputies of\r\nthe congregations of a whole province or land who lay to heart the weal\r\nor woe of their congregations, and lay the results of their conferences\r\nbefore the General Synod or the Directory, which is constituted from one\r\nGeneral Synod to another. In other places and districts, indeed, that\r\nname does not suit; but yet in every congregation and district a solemn\r\nconference of that sort may every year be holden, and report be made out\r\nof it to the Directory and General Synod.\"\r\n\r\nIn individual congregations the same principle applied. There, too,\r\nself-government was almost unknown. At the head of each congregation\r\nwas a board known as the Elders' Conference; and that Elders' Conference\r\nconsisted, not of Brethren elected by the Church members, but of the\r\nminister, the minister's wife, and the choir-labourers, all appointed\r\nby the supreme Directing Board. It is true that the members of the\r\ncongregation had power to elect a committee, but the powers of that\r\ncommittee were strictly limited. It dealt with business matters only,\r\nand all members of the Elders' Conference were ex officio members of the\r\nCommittee. We can see, then, what this curious system meant. It meant\r\nthat a body of Moravian members in London, Dublin or Philadelphia were\r\nunder the authority of a Conference appointed by a Directing Board of\r\nGermans resident in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe next question to settle was finance; and here again the word\r\n\"centralization\" must be our guide through the jungle. At that time the\r\nfinances had sunk so low that at this first General Synod most of the\r\nministers and deputies had to sleep on straw, and now the great problem\r\nto settle was, how to deal with Zinzendorf's property. As long as\r\nZinzendorf was in the flesh he had generously used the income from his\r\nestates for all sorts of Church purposes. But now the situation was\r\nrather delicate. On the one hand, Zinzendorf's landed property belonged\r\nby law to his heirs, i.e., his three daughters, and his wife's nephew,\r\nCount Reuss; on the other hand, he had verbally pledged it to the\r\nBrethren to help them out of their financial troubles. The problem was\r\nsolved by purchase. In exchange for Zinzendorf's estates at Berthelsdorf\r\nand Gross-Hennersdorf, the Brethren offered the heirs the sum of\r\n£25,000. The heirs accepted the offer; the deeds of sale were prepared;\r\nand thus Zinzendorf's landed property became the property of the\r\nMoravian Church. We must not call this a smart business transaction.\r\nWhen the Brethren purchased Zinzendorf's estates, they purchased his\r\ndebts as well; and those debts amounted now to over £150,000. The one\r\nthing the Brethren gained was independence. They were no longer under an\r\nobligation to the Zinzendorf family.\r\n\r\nAt the next General Synod, held again at Marienborn {1769.}, the\r\ncentralizing principle was still more emphatically enforced. As the\r\nthree separate boards of management had not worked very smoothly\r\ntogether, the Brethren now abolished them, and resolved that henceforth\r\nall supreme administrative authority should be vested in one grand\r\ncomprehensive board, to be known as the Unity's Elders' Conference.[138] The Conference was divided into three departments--the College of\r\nOverseers, the College of Helpers, and the College of Servants. It is\r\nhard for English readers to realize what absolute powers this board\r\npossessed. The secret lies in the Brethren's use of the Lot. Hitherto\r\nthe use of the Lot had been haphazard; henceforth it was a recognized\r\nprinciple of Church government. At this Synod the Brethren laid down the\r\nlaw that all elections,[139] appointments and important decisions should\r\nbe ratified by the Lot. It was used, not only to confirm elections, but\r\noften, though not always, to settle questions of Church policy. It\r\nwas often appealed to at Synods. If a difficult question came up for\r\ndiscussion, the Brethren frequently consulted the Lot. The method was to\r\nplace three papers in a box, and then appoint someone to draw one out.\r\nIf the paper was positive, the resolution was carried; if the paper\r\nwas negative, the resolution was lost; if the paper was blank, the\r\nresolution was laid on the table. The weightiest matters were settled in\r\nthis way. At one Synod the Lot decided that George Waiblinger should\r\nbe entrusted with the task of preparing an \"Exposition of Christian\r\nDoctrine\"; and yet when Waiblinger fulfilled his duty, the Brethren\r\nwere not satisfied with his work. At another Synod the Lot decided that\r\nSpangenberg should not be entrusted with that task, and yet the Brethren\r\nwere quite convinced that Spangenberg was the best man for the purpose.\r\nBut perhaps the greatest effect of the Lot was the power and dignity\r\nwhich it conferred on officials. No man could be a member of the\r\nU.E.C. unless his election had been confirmed by the Lot; and when that\r\nconfirmation had been obtained, he felt that he had been appointed, not\r\nonly by his Brethren, but also by God. Thus the U.E.C., appointed by\r\nthe Lot, employed the Lot to settle the most delicate questions. For\r\nexample, no Moravian minister might marry without the consent of the\r\nU.E.C. The U.E.C. submitted his choice to the Lot; and if the Lot\r\ndecided in the negative, he accepted the decision as the voice of God.\r\nIn the congregations the same practice prevailed. All applications for\r\nchurch membership and all proposals of marriage were submitted to the\r\nLocal Elders' Conference; and in each case the Conference arrived at its\r\ndecision by consulting the Lot. To some critics this practice appeared a\r\nsymptom of lunacy. It was not so regarded by the Brethren. It was their\r\nway of seeking the guidance of God; and when they were challenged\r\nto justify their conduct, they appealed to the example of the eleven\r\nApostles as recorded in Acts i. 26, and also to the promise of Christ,\r\n\"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, I will do it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Synod the financial problem came up afresh. The Brethren tried a\r\nbold experiment. As the Church's debts could not be extinguished in any\r\nother way, they determined to appeal to the generosity of the members;\r\nand to this end they now resolved that the property of the Church should\r\nbe divided into as many sections as there were congregations, that each\r\ncongregation should have its own property and bear its own burden, and\r\nthat each congregation-committee should supply the needs of its own\r\nminister. Of course, money for general Church purposes would still be\r\nrequired: but the Brethren trusted that this would come readily from the\r\npockets of loving members.\r\n\r\nBut love, though a beautiful silken bond, is sometimes apt to snap. The\r\nnew arrangement was violently opposed. What right, asked grumblers, had\r\nthe Synod to saddle individual congregations with the debts of the whole\r\nChurch? The local managers of diaconies proved incompetent. At Neuwied\r\none Brother lost £6,000 of Church money in a lottery. The financial\r\npressure became harder than ever. James Skinner, a member of the London\r\ncongregation, suggested that the needful money should be raised by\r\nweekly subscriptions. In England this proposal might have found favour;\r\nin Germany it was rejected with contempt. The relief came from an\r\nunexpected quarter. At Herrnhut the members were celebrating the\r\ncongregation Jubilee {1772.}; and twenty poor Single Sisters there,\r\ninspired with patriotic zeal, concocted the following letter to the\r\nU.E.C.: \"After maturely weighing how we might be able, in proportion\r\nto our slender means, to contribute something to lessen the debt on the\r\nUnity--i.e., our own debt--we have cheerfully agreed to sacrifice and\r\ndispose of all unnecessary articles, such as gold and silver plate,\r\nwatches, snuff-boxes, rings, trinkets and jewellery of every kind for\r\nthe purpose of establishing a Sinking Fund, on condition that not\r\nonly the congregation at Herrnhut, but all the members of the Church\r\neverywhere, rich and poor, old and young, agree to this proposal. But\r\nthis agreement is not to be binding on those who can contribute in\r\nother ways.\" The brave letter caused an immense sensation. The spirit\r\nof generosity swept over the Church like a freshening breeze. For very\r\nshame the other members felt compelled to dive into their pockets; and\r\nthe young men, not being possessed of trinkets, offered free labour in\r\ntheir leisure hours. The good folk at Herrnhut vied with each other\r\nin giving; and the Brethren at Philadelphia vied with the Brethren at\r\nHerrnhut. The Sinking Fund was established. In less than twelve months\r\nthe Single Sisters at Herrnhut raised £1,300; the total contributions at\r\nHerrnhut amounted to £3,500; and in three years the Sinking Fund had a\r\ncapital of £25,000. Thus did twenty Single Sisters earn a high place on\r\nthe Moravian roll of honour. At the same time, the U.E.C. were able to\r\nsell the three estates of Marienborn, Herrnhaag and Lindsey House; and\r\nin these ways the debt on the Church was gradually wiped off.\r\n\r\nThe third constitutional Synod was held at Barby, on the Elbe,\r\nnear Magdeburg {1775.}. At this Synod the power of the U.E.C. was\r\nstrengthened. In order to prevent financial crises in future, the\r\nBrethren now laid down the law that each congregation, though having\r\nits own property, should contribute a fixed annual quota to the\r\ngeneral fund; that all managers of local diaconies should be directly\r\nresponsible to the U.E.C.; and that each congregation should send in to\r\nthe U.E.C. an annual financial statement. In this way, therefore, all\r\nChurch property was, directly or indirectly, under the control of the\r\nU.E.C. The weakness of this arrangement is manifest. As long as the\r\nU.E.C. was resident in Germany, and as long as it consisted almost\r\nexclusively of Germans, it could not be expected to understand financial\r\nquestions arising in England and America, or to fathom the mysteries of\r\nEnglish and American law; and yet this was the system in force for the\r\nnext eighty-two years. It is true that the Brethren devised a method\r\nto overcome this difficulty. The method was the method of official\r\nvisitations. At certain periods a member of the U.E.C. would pay\r\nofficial visitations to the chief congregations in Germany, England,\r\nAmerica and the Mission Field. For example, Bishop John Frederick\r\nReichel visited North America (1778-1781) and the East Indies; Bishop\r\nJohn de Watteville (1778-1779) visited in England, Ireland, Scotland\r\nand Wales; and John Henry Quandt (1798) visited Neuwied-on-the-Rhine.\r\nIn some ways the method was good, in others bad. It was good because it\r\nfostered the unity of the Church, and emphasized its broad international\r\ncharacter. It was bad because it was cumbrous and expensive, because it\r\nexalted too highly the official element, and because it checked local\r\nindependent growth.\r\n\r\nFinally, at this third constitutional Synod, the Brethren struck a\r\nclear note on doctrinal questions. The main doctrines of the Church were\r\ndefined as follows: (1) The doctrine of the universal depravity of man;\r\nthat there is no health in man, and that since the fall he has no power\r\nwhatever left to help himself. (2) The doctrine of the Divinity of\r\nChrist; that God, the Creator of all things, was manifest in the flesh,\r\nand reconciled us unto Himself; that He is before all things, and that\r\nby Him all things consist. (3) The doctrine of the atonement and the\r\nsatisfaction made for us by Jesus Christ; that He was delivered for our\r\noffences, and raised again for our justification; and that by His merits\r\nalone we receive freely the forgiveness of sin and sanctification in\r\nsoul and body. (4) The doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the operations of\r\nHis grace; that it is He who worketh in us conviction of sin, faith in\r\nJesus, and pureness of heart. (5) The doctrine of the fruits of faith;\r\nthat faith must evidence itself by willing obedience to the commandments\r\nof God, from love and gratitude to Him. In those doctrines there\r\nwas nothing striking or peculiar. They were the orthodox Protestant\r\ndoctrines of the day; they were the doctrines of the Lutheran Church,\r\nof the Church of England, and the Church of Scotland; and they were,\r\nand are, all to be found in the Augsburg Confession, in the Thirty-nine\r\nArticles, and in the Westminster Confession.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the methods and doctrines laid down by the three\r\nconstitutional Synods. In methods the Brethren were distinctive; in\r\ndoctrine they were \"orthodox evangelical.\" We may now sum up the results\r\nof this chapter. We have a semi-democratic Church constitution. We\r\nhave a governing board, consisting mostly of Germans, and resident\r\nin Germany. We have the systematic use of the Lot. We have a broad\r\nevangelical doctrinal standpoint. We are now to see how these principles\r\nand methods worked out in Germany, Great Britain and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. -- THE FIGHT FOR THE GOSPEL; OR, MORAVIANS AND RATIONALISTS, 1775-1800.\r\n\r\nIf a man stands up for the old theology when new theology is in the\r\nair, he is sure to be praised by some for his loyalty, and condemned\r\nby others for his stupidity; and that was the fate of the Brethren\r\nin Germany during the closing years of the eighteenth century. The\r\nsituation in Germany was swiftly changing. The whole country was in\r\na theological upheaval. As soon as the Brethren had framed their\r\nconstitution, they were summoned to the open field of battle. For fifty\r\nyears they had held their ground against a cold and lifeless orthodoxy,\r\nand had, therefore, been regarded as heretics; and now, as though by\r\na sudden miracle, they became the boldest champions in Germany of the\r\northodox Lutheran faith. Already a powerful enemy had entered the field.\r\nThe name of the enemy was Rationalism. As we enter the last quarter of\r\nthe eighteenth century, we hear the sound of tramping armies and the\r\nfirst mutterings of a mighty storm. The spirit of free inquiry spread\r\nlike wildfire. In America it led to the War of Independence; in England\r\nit led to Deism; in France it led to open atheism and all the horrors\r\nof the French Revolution. In Germany, however, its effect was rather\r\ndifferent. If the reader knows anything of Germany history, he will\r\nprobably be aware of the fact that Germany is a land of many famous\r\nuniversities, and that these universities have always played a leading\r\npart in the national life. It is so to-day; it was so in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In England a Professor may easily become a fossil; in Germany\r\nhe often guides the thought of the age. For some years that scoffing\r\nwriter, Voltaire, had been openly petted at the court of Frederick the\r\nGreat; his sceptical spirit was rapidly becoming fashionable; and now\r\nthe professors at the Lutheran Universities, and many of the leading\r\nLutheran preachers, were expounding certain radical views, not only on\r\nsuch vexed questions as Biblical inspiration and the credibility of the\r\nGospel narratives, but even on some of the orthodox doctrines set forth\r\nin the Augsburg Confession. At Halle University, John Semler propounded\r\nnew views about the origin of the Bible; at Jena, Griesbach expounded\r\ntextual criticism; at Göttingen, Eichhorn was lecturing on Higher\r\nCriticism; and the more the views of these scholars spread, the more the\r\naverage Church members feared that the old foundations were giving way.\r\n\r\nAmid the alarm, the Brethren came to the rescue. It is needful to state\r\ntheir position with some exactness. We must not regard them as blind\r\nsupporters of tradition, or as bigoted enemies of science and research.\r\nIn spite of their love of the Holy Scriptures, they never entered into\r\nany controversy on mere questions of Biblical criticism. They had no\r\nspecial theory of Biblical inspiration. At this time the official Church\r\ntheologian was Spangenberg. He was appointed to the position by the\r\nU.E.C.; he was commissioned to prepare an Exposition of Doctrine; and,\r\ntherefore, the attitude adopted by Spangenberg may be taken as the\r\nattitude of the Brethren. But Spangenberg himself did not believe that\r\nthe whole Bible was inspired by God. \"I cannot assert,\" he wrote in one\r\npassage, \"that every word in the Holy Scriptures has been inspired by\r\nthe Holy Ghost and given thus to the writers. For example, the speeches\r\nat the end of the book of Job, ascribed there to God, are of such a\r\nnature that they cannot possibly have proceeded from the Holy Ghost.\"\r\nHe believed, of course, in the public reading of Scripture; but when the\r\nBrethren were planning a lectionary, he urged them to make a distinction\r\nbetween the Old and New Testaments. \"Otherwise,\" he declared, \"the\r\nreading of the Old Testament may do more harm than good.\" He objected to\r\nthe public reading of Job and the Song of Songs.\r\n\r\nBut advanced views about the Bible were not the main feature of the\r\nrationalistic movement. A large number of the German theologians were\r\nteaching what we should call \"New Theology.\" Instead of adhering to\r\nthe Augsburg Confession, a great many of the Lutheran professors and\r\npreachers were attacking some of its leading doctrines. First, they\r\ndenied the doctrine of the Fall, whittled away the total depravity of\r\nman, and asserted that God had created men, not with a natural bias to\r\nsin, but perfectly free to choose between good and evil. Secondly,\r\nthey rejected the doctrine of reconciliation through the meritorious\r\nsufferings of Christ. Thirdly, they suggested that the doctrine of the\r\nHoly Trinity was an offence to reason. Around these three doctrines\r\nthe great battle was fought. To the Brethren those doctrines were all\r\nfundamental, all essential to salvation, and all precious parts of\r\nChristian experience; and, therefore, they defended them against the\r\nRationalists, not on intellectual, but on moral and spiritual grounds.\r\nThe whole question at issue, in their judgment, was a question of\r\nChristian experience. The case of Spangenberg will make this clear. To\r\nunderstand Spangenberg is to understand his Brethren. He defended the\r\ndoctrine of total depravity, not merely because he found it in the\r\nScriptures, but because he was as certain as a man can be that he had\r\nonce been totally depraved himself; and he defended the doctrine\r\nof reconciliation because, as he wrote to that drinking old sinner,\r\nProfessor Basedow, he had found all grace and freedom from sin in the\r\natoning sacrifice of Jesus. He often spoke of himself in contemptuous\r\nlanguage; he called himself a mass of sins, a disgusting creature, an\r\noffence to his own nostrils; and he recorded his own experience when\r\nhe said: \"It has pleased Him to make out of me--a revolting creature--a\r\nchild of God, a temple of the Holy Ghost, a member of the body of\r\nChrist, all heir of eternal life.\" There we have Spangenberg's theology\r\nin a sentence; there shines the Brethren's experimental religion. The\r\ndoctrine of the Trinity stood upon the same basis. In God the Father\r\nthey had a protector; in God the Son an ever present friend; in God the\r\nHoly Ghost a spiritual guide; and, therefore, they defended the doctrine\r\nof the Trinity, not because it was in the Augsburg Confession, but\r\nbecause, in their judgment, it fitted their personal experience.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Brethren were not controversialists. Instead of arguing with\r\nthe rationalist preachers, they employed more pleasing methods of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe first method was the publication of useful literature. The most\r\nstriking book, and the most influential, was Spangenberg's Idea Fidei\r\nFratrum; i.e., Exposition of the Brethren's Doctrine {1778.}. For\r\nmany years this treatise was prized by the Brethren as a body of sound\r\ndivinity; and although it can no longer be regarded as a text-book for\r\ntheological students, it is still used and highly valued at some of the\r\nMoravian Mission stations.[140] From the first the book sold well, and its\r\ninfluence in Germany was great. It was translated into English, Danish,\r\nFrench, Swedish, Dutch, Bohemian and Polish. Its strength was its\r\nloyalty to Holy Scripture; its weakness its lack of original thought. If\r\nevery difficult theological question is to be solved by simply appealing\r\nto passages of Scripture, it is obvious that little room is left for\r\nprofound and original reflection; and that, speaking broadly, was the\r\nmethod adopted by Spangenberg in this volume. His object was twofold.\r\nOn the one hand, he wished to be true to the Augsburg Confession; on the\r\nother hand, he would admit no doctrine that was not clearly supported\r\nby Scripture. The book was almost entirely in Scriptural language. The\r\nconventional phrases of theology were purposely omitted. In spite of his\r\nadherence to the orthodox faith, the writer never used such phrases as\r\nTrinity, Original Sin, Person, or Sacrament. He deliberately abandoned\r\nthe language of the creeds for the freer language of Scripture. It was\r\nthis that helped to make the book so popular. The more fiercely the\r\ntheological controversy raged, the more ready was the average working\r\npastor to flee from the dust and din of battle by appealing to the\r\ntestimony of the Bible.\r\n\r\n\"How evangelical! How purely Biblical!\" wrote Spangenberg's friend,\r\nCourt Councillor Frederick Falke (June 10th, 1787). Christian David\r\nLenz, the Lutheran Superintendent at Riga, was charmed. \"Nothing,\" he\r\nwrote, \"has so convinced me of the purity of the Brethren's evangelical\r\nteaching as your Idea Fidei Fratrum. It appeared just when it was\r\nneeded. In the midst of the universal corruption, the Brethren are a\r\npillar of the truth.\" The Danish Minister of Religion, Adam Struensee,\r\nwho had been a fellow-student with Spangenberg at Jena, was eloquent\r\nin his praises. \"A great philosopher at our University,\" he wrote to\r\nSpangenberg, \"complained to me about our modern theologians; and then\r\nadded: 'I am just reading Spangenberg's Idea. It is certain that our\r\nsuccessors will have to recover their Christian theology from the\r\nMoravian Brethren.'\" But the keenest criticism was passed by Caspar\r\nLavater. His mixture of praise and blame was highly instructive. He\r\ncontrasted Spangenberg with Zinzendorf. In reading Zinzendorf, we\r\nconstantly need the lead pencil. One sentence we wish to cross out; the\r\nnext we wish to underline. In reading Spangenberg we do neither. \"In\r\nthese recent works of the Brethren,\" said Lavater, \"I find much less\r\nto strike out as unscriptural, but also much less to underline as deep,\r\nthan in the soaring writings of Zinzendorf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Brethren, under Spangenberg's guidance, entered on a new\r\nphase. In originality they had lost; in sobriety they had gained; and\r\nnow they were honoured by the orthodox party in Germany as trusted\r\nchampions of the faith delivered once for all unto the saints.\r\n\r\nThe same lesson was taught by the new edition of the Hymn-book {1778.}.\r\nIt was prepared by Christian Gregor. The first Hymn-book, issued by the\r\nRenewed Church of the Brethren, appeared in 1735. It consisted chiefly\r\nof Brethren's hymns, written mostly by Zinzendorf; and during the\r\nnext fifteen years it was steadily enlarged by the addition of twelve\r\nappendices. But in two ways these appendices were faulty. They were\r\nfar too bulky, and they contained some objectionable hymns. As\r\nsoon, however, as the Brethren had recovered from the errors of the\r\nSifting-Time, Count Zinzendorf published a revised Hymn-book in London\r\n(1753-4); and then, a little later, an extract, entitled \"Hymns of\r\nSharon.\" But even these editions were unsatisfactory. They contained too\r\nmany hymns by Brethren, too many relics of the Sifting-Time, and too few\r\nhymns by writers of other Churches. But the edition published by Gregor\r\nwas a masterpiece. It contained the finest hymns of Christendom from\r\nnearly every source. It was absolutely free from extravagant language;\r\nand, therefore, it has not only been used by the Brethren from that day\r\nto this, but is highly valued by Christians of other Churches. In\r\n1784 Christian Gregor brought out a volume of \"Chorales,\" where noble\r\nthoughts and stately music were wedded.\r\n\r\nThe next class of literature issued was historical. The more fiercely\r\nthe orthodox Gospel was attacked, the more zealously the Brethren\r\nbrought out books to show the effect of that Gospel on the lives of\r\nmen. In 1765, David Cranz, the historian, published his \"History of\r\nGreenland.\" He had been for fourteen months in Greenland himself. He\r\nhad studied his subject at first hand; he was a careful, accurate,\r\nconscientious writer; his book soon appeared in a second edition (1770),\r\nand was translated into English, Dutch, Swedish and Danish; and\r\nwhatever objections philosophers might raise against the Gospel of\r\nreconciliation, David Cranz was able to show that by the preaching\r\nof that Gospel the Brethren in Greenland had taught the natives to\r\nbe sober, industrious and pure. In 1777 the Brethren published G.\r\nA. Oldendorp's elaborate \"History of the Mission in the Danish West\r\nIndies,\" and, in 1789, G. H. Loskiel's \"History of the Mission Among the\r\nNorth American Indians.\" In each case the author had been on the spot\r\nhimself; and in each case the book was welcomed as a proof of the power\r\nof the Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe second method was correspondence and visitation. In spite of their\r\nopposition to rationalistic doctrine the Brethren kept in friendly touch\r\nwith the leading rationalist preachers. Above all, they kept in touch\r\nwith the Universities. The leader of this good work was Spangenberg.\r\nWhere Zinzendorf had failed, Spangenberg succeeded. It is a curious\r\nfeature of Zinzendorf's life that while he won the favour of kings and\r\ngovernments, he could rarely win the favour of learned Churchmen. As\r\nlong as Zinzendorf reigned supreme, the Brethren were rather despised at\r\nthe Universities; but now they were treated with marked respect. At one\r\ntime the U.E.C. suggested that regular annual visits should be paid\r\nto the Universities of Halle, Wittenberg and Leipzig; and in one\r\nyear Bishop Layritz, a member of the U.E.C., visited the Lutheran\r\nUniversities of Halle, Erlangen, Tübingen, Strasburg, Erfurt and\r\nLeipzig, and the Calvinist Universities of Bern, Geneva and Basle. In\r\nresponse to a request from Walch of Göttingen, Spangenberg wrote his\r\n\"Brief Historical Account of the Brethren\" and his \"Account of the\r\nBrethren's Work Among the Heathen\"; and, in response to a request from\r\nKöster of Gieszen, he wrote a series of theological articles for that\r\nscholar's \"Encyclopædia.\" Meanwhile, he was in constant correspondence\r\nwith Schneider at Eisenach, Lenz at Riga, Reinhard at Dresden, Roos at\r\nAnhausen, Tittman at Dresden, and other well-known Lutheran preachers.\r\nFor thirteen years (1771-1784) the seat of the U.E.C. was Barby; and\r\nthere they often received visits from leading German scholars. At one\r\ntime the notorious Professor Basedow begged, almost with tears in his\r\neyes, to be admitted to the Moravian Church; but the Brethren could\r\nnot admit a man, however learned he might be, who sought consolation\r\nin drink and gambling. On other occasions the Brethren were visited\r\nby Campe, the Minister of Education; by Salzmann, the founder of\r\nSchnepfenthal; and by Becker, the future editor of the German Times.\r\nBut the most distinguished visitor at Barby was Semler, the famous\r\nrationalist Professor at Halle. \"He spent many hours with us,\" said\r\nSpangenberg {1773.}. \"He expounded his views, and we heard him to the\r\nend. In reply we told him our convictions, and then we parted in\r\npeace from each other.\" When Semler published his \"Abstract of Church\r\nHistory,\" he sent a copy to Spangenberg; and Spangenberg returned the\r\ncompliment by sending him the latest volume of his \"Life of Zinzendorf.\"\r\nAt these friendly meetings with learned men the Brethren never argued.\r\nTheir method was different. It was the method of personal testimony. \"It\r\nis, I imagine, no small thing,\" said Spangenberg, in a letter to Dr. J.\r\nG. Rosenmüller, \"that a people exists among us who can testify both by\r\nword and life that in the sacrifice of Jesus they have found all\r\ngrace and deliverance from sin.\" And thus the Brethren replied to the\r\nRationalists by appealing to personal experience.\r\n\r\nThe third method was the education of the young. For its origin we turn\r\nto the case of Susannah Kühnel. At the time of the great revival in\r\nHerrnhut {1727.}, the children had not been neglected; Susannah Kühnel,\r\na girl of eleven, became the leader of a revival. \"We had then for our\r\nmaster,\" said Jacob Liebich, \"an upright and serious man, who had the\r\ngood of his pupils much at heart.\" The name of the master was Krumpe.\r\n\"He never failed,\" continued Liebich, \"at the close of the school to\r\npray with us, and to commend us to the Lord Jesus and His Spirit during\r\nthe time of our amusements. At that time Susannah Kühnel was awakened,\r\nand frequently withdrew into her father's garden, especially in the\r\nevenings, to ask the grace of the Lord and to seek the salvation of her\r\nsoul with strong crying and tears. As this was next door to the house\r\nwhere we lived (there was only a boarded partition between us), we could\r\nhear her prayers as we were going to rest and as we lay upon our beds.\r\nWe were so much impressed that we could not fall asleep as carelessly as\r\nformerly, and asked our teachers to go with us to pray. Instead of going\r\nto sleep as usual, we went to the boundaries which separated the fields,\r\nor among the bushes, to throw ourselves before the Lord and beg Him to\r\nturn us to Himself. Our teachers often went with us, and when we had\r\ndone praying, and had to return, we went again, one to this place and\r\nanother to that, or in pairs, to cast ourselves upon our knees and pray\r\nin secret.\" Amid the fervour occurred the events of August 13th. The\r\nchildren at Herrnhut were stirred. For three days Susannah Kühnel was\r\nso absorbed in thought and prayer that she forgot to take her food; and\r\nthen, on August 17th, having passed through a severe spiritual struggle,\r\nshe was able to say to her father: \"Now I am become a child of God; now\r\nI know how my mother felt and feels.\" We are not to pass this story\r\nover as a mere pious anecdote. It illustrates an important Moravian\r\nprinciple. For the next forty-two years the Brethren practised\r\nthe system of training the children of Church members in separate\r\ninstitutions; the children, therefore, were boarded and educated by the\r\nChurch and at the Church's expense;[141] and the principle underlying\r\nthe system was that children from their earliest years should receive\r\nsystematic religious training. If the child, they held, was properly\r\ntrained and taught to love and obey Jesus Christ, he would not need\r\nafterwards to be converted. He would be brought up as a member of the\r\nKingdom of God. As long as the Brethren could find the money, they\r\nmaintained this \"Children's Economy.\" The date of Susannah's conversion\r\nwas remembered, and became the date of the annual Children's Festival;\r\nand in every settlement and congregation special meetings for children\r\nwere regularly held. But the system was found too expensive. At the\r\nSynod of 1769 it was abandoned. No longer could the Brethren maintain\r\nand educate the children of all their members; thencefoward they could\r\nmaintain and educate only the children of those in church service.\r\n\r\nFor the sons of ministers they established a Pædagogium; for the\r\ndaughters of ministers a Girls' School at Kleinwelke, in Saxony; and\r\nfor candidates for ministerial service a Theological Seminary, situated\r\nfirst at Barby, then at Niesky, and finally at Gnadenfeld, in Silesia.\r\nAt the same time, the Brethren laid down the rule that each congregation\r\nshould have its own elementary day school. At first these schools were\r\nmeant for Moravians only; but before long they were thrown open to the\r\npublic. The principle of serving the public steadily grew. It began in\r\nthe elementary schools; it led to the establishment of boarding-schools.\r\nThe first step was taken in Denmark. At Christiansfeld, in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, the Brethren had established a congregation by\r\nthe special request of the Danish Government; and there, in 1774, they\r\nopened two boarding-schools for boys and girls. From that time the\r\nBrethren became more practical in their methods. Instead of attempting\r\nthe hopeless task of providing free education, they now built a number\r\nof boarding-schools; and at the Synod of 1782 they officially recognized\r\neducation as a definite part of their Church work. The chief schools\r\nwere those at Neuwied-on-the-Rhine; Gnadenfrei, in Silesia; Ebersdorf,\r\nin Vogt-land; and Montmirail, in Switzerland. The style of architecture\r\nadopted was the Mansard. As the standard of education was high, the\r\nschools soon became famous; and as the religion taught was broad, the\r\npupils came from all Protestant denominations. On this subject the\r\nwell-known historian, Kurtz, has almost told the truth. He informs us\r\nthat during the dreary period of Rationalism, the schools established\r\nby the Brethren were a \"sanctuary for the old Gospel, with its blessed\r\npromises and glorious hopes.\" It would be better, however, to speak\r\nof these schools as barracks. If we think of the Brethren as retiring\r\nhermits, we shall entirely misunderstand their character. They fought\r\nthe Rationalists with their own weapons; they gave a splendid classical,\r\nliterary and scientific education; they enforced their discipline on\r\nthe sons of barons and nobles; they staffed their schools with men of\r\nlearning and piety; and these men, by taking a personal interest in the\r\nreligious life of their pupils, trained up a band of fearless warriors\r\nfor the holy cause of the Gospel. It was this force of personal\r\ninfluence and example that made the schools so famous; this that won\r\nthe confidence of the public; and this that caused the Brethren to be\r\nso widely trusted as defenders of the faith and life of the Lutheran\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe fourth method employed by the Brethren was the Diaspora. Here\r\nagain, as in the public schools, the Brethren never attempted to\r\nmake proselytes. At the Synod of 1782, and again at a Conference of\r\nDiaspora-workers, held at Herrnhut (1785), the Brethren emphatically\r\nlaid down the rule that no worker in the Diaspora should ever attempt to\r\nwin converts for the Moravian Church. The Diaspora work was now at the\r\nheight of its glory. In Lusatia the Brethren had centres of work at\r\nHerrnhut, Niesky and Kleinwelke; in Silesia, at Gnadenfrei, Gnadenberg,\r\nGnadenfeld and Neusalz; in Pomerania, at Rügen and Mecklenburg; in\r\nEast Prussia, at Danzig, Königsberg and Elbing; in Thuringia, at\r\nNeudietendorf; in the Palatinate and the Wetterau; at Neuwied; in\r\nBrandenburg, at Berlin and Potsdam; in Denmark, at Christiansfeld,\r\nSchleswig, Fühnen, and Copenhagen; in Norway, at Christiana, Drammen\r\nand Bergen; in Sweden, at Stockholm and Gothenburg; in Switzerland,\r\nat Basel, Bern, Zürich and Montmirail; and finally, in Livonia and\r\nEsthonia, they employed about a hundred preachers and ministered\r\nto about six thousand souls. At this rate it would appear that the\r\nMoravians in Germany were increasing by leaps and bounds; but in reality\r\nthey were doing nothing of the kind. At this time the Moravian influence\r\nwas felt in every part of Germany; and yet during this very period\r\nthey founded only the three congregations of Gnadenfeld, Gnadau, and\r\nKönigsfeld.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest proof of the Brethren's power was their influence over\r\nSchleiermacher. Of all the religious leaders in Germany Schleiermacher\r\nwas the greatest since Luther; and Schleiermacher learned his religion,\r\nboth directly and indirectly, from the Brethren. It is sometimes stated\r\nin lives of Schleiermacher that he received his earliest religious\r\nimpressions from his parents; but, on the other hand, it should be\r\nremembered that both his parents, in their turn, had come under Moravian\r\ninfluence. His father was a Calvinistic army chaplain, who had made\r\nthe acquaintance of Brethren at Gnadenfrei (1778). He there adopted the\r\nBrethren's conception of religion; he became a Moravian in everything\r\nbut the name; his wife passed through the same spiritual experience;\r\nhe then settled down as Calvinist pastor in the colony of Anhalt; and\r\nfinally, for the sake of his children, he visited the Brethren again at\r\nGnadenfrei (1783). His famous son was now a lad of fifteen; and here,\r\namong the Brethren at Gnadenfrei, the young seeker first saw the\r\nheavenly vision. \"It was here,\" he said, \"that I first became aware of\r\nman's connection with a higher world. It was here that I developed that\r\nmystic faculty which I regard as essential, and which has often upheld\r\nand saved me amid the storms of doubt.\"\r\n\r\nBut Schleiermacher's father was not content. He had visited the Brethren\r\nboth at Herrnhut and Niesky; he admired the Moravian type of teaching;\r\nand now he requested the U.E.C. to admit both his sons as pupils to\r\nthe Pædagogium at Niesky. But the U.E.C. objected. The Pædagogium, they\r\nsaid, was meant for Moravian students only. As the old man, however,\r\nwould take no refusal, the question was put to the Lot; the Lot gave\r\nconsent; and to Niesky Schleiermacher and his brother came. For two\r\nyears, therefore, Schleiermacher studied at the Brethren's Pædagogium at\r\nNiesky; and here he learned some valuable lessons {1783-5.}. He learned\r\nthe value of hard work; he formed a friendship with Albertini, and\r\nplunged with him into a passionate study of Greek and Latin literature;\r\nand he learned by personal contact with bright young souls that\r\nreligion, when based on personal experience, is a thing of beauty and\r\njoy. Above all, he learned from the Brethren the value of the historical\r\nChrist. The great object of Schleiermacher's life was to reconcile\r\nscience and religion. He attempted for the Germans of the eighteenth\r\ncentury what many theologians are attempting for us to-day. He\r\nendeavoured to make a \"lasting treaty between living Christian faith and\r\nthe spirit of free inquiry.\" He found that treaty existing already at\r\nNiesky. As the solemn time of confirmation drew near, the young lad was\r\ncarried away by his feelings, and expected his spiritual instructor to\r\nfan the flame. \"But no!\" says Schleiermacher, \"he led me back to the\r\nfield of history. He urged me to inquire into the facts and quietly\r\nthink out conclusions for myself.\" Thus Schleiermacher acquired at\r\nNiesky that scientific frame of mind, and also that passionate devotion\r\nto Christ, which are seen in every line he wrote.\r\n\r\nFrom Niesksy he passed to the Theological Seminary at Barby {1785-87.}.\r\nBut here the influence was of a different kind. Of the three theological\r\nprofessors at Barby--Baumeister, Bossart, and Thomas Moore--not one was\r\nintellectually fitted to deal with the religious difficulties of young\r\nmen. Instead of talking frankly with the students about the burning\r\nproblems of the day, they simply lectured on the old orthodox lines,\r\nasserted that certain doctrines were true, informed the young seekers\r\nthat doubting was sinful, and closed every door and window of the\r\ncollege against the entrance of modern ideas. But modern ideas streamed\r\nin through the chinks. Young Schleiermacher was now like a golden eagle\r\nin a cage. At Niesky he had learned to think for himself; at Barby he\r\nwas told that thinking for himself was wrong. He called the doctrines\r\ntaught by the professors \"stupid orthodoxy.\" He rejected, on\r\nintellectual grounds, their doctrine of the eternal Godhead of Christ;\r\nand he rejected on moral and spiritual grounds their doctrines of\r\nthe total depravity of man, of eternal punishment, and of the\r\nsubstitutionary sufferings of Christ. He wrote a pathetic letter to his\r\nfather. \"I cannot accept these doctrines,\" he said. He begged his father\r\nto allow him to leave the college; the old man reluctantly granted the\r\nrequest; and Schleiermacher, therefore, left the Brethren and pursued\r\nhis independent career.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, though he differed from the Brethren in theology, he felt\r\nhimself at one with them in religion. In one sense, he remained a\r\nMoravian to the end. He called himself a \"Moravian of the higher order\";\r\nand by that phrase he probably meant that he had the Brethren's faith\r\nin Christ, but rejected their orthodox theology. He read their monthly\r\nmagazine, \"Nachrichten.\" He maintained his friendship with Bishop\r\nAlbertini, and studied his sermons and poems. He kept in touch with the\r\nBrethren at Berlin, where his sister, Charlotte, lived in one of\r\ntheir establishments. He frequently stayed at Gnadenfrei, Barby, and\r\nEbersdorf. He chatted with Albertini at Berthelsdorf. He described\r\nthe Brethren's singing meetings as models. \"They make a deep religious\r\nimpression,\" he said, \"which is often of greater value than many\r\nsermons.\" He loved their celebration of Passion Week, their triumphant\r\nEaster Morning service, and their beautiful Holy Communion. \"There is no\r\nCommunion to compare with theirs,\" he said; and many a non-Moravian has\r\nsaid the same. He admired the Moravian Church because she was free; and\r\nin one of his later writings he declared that if that Church could only\r\nbe reformed according to the spirit of the age, she would be one of\r\nthe grandest Churches in the world. \"In fundamentals,\" he said, \"the\r\nBrethren are right; it is only their Christology and theology that are\r\nbad, and these are only externals. What a pity they cannot separate the\r\nsurface from the solid rock beneath.\" To him the fundamental truth of\r\ntheology was the revelation of God in Jesus Christ; and that also was\r\nthe fundamental element in the teaching of Zinzendorf.[142]\r\nMeanwhile the great leader of the Brethren had passed away from\r\nearth. At the advanced age of eighty-eight, Bishop Spangenberg died\r\nat Berthelsdorf {1792.}. In history Spangenberg has not received his\r\ndeserts. We have allowed him to be overshadowed by Zinzendorf. In\r\ngenius, he was Zinzendorf's inferior; in energy, his equal; in practical\r\nwisdom, his superior. He had organized the first Moravian congregation\r\nin England, i.e., the one at Fetter Lane; he superintended the first\r\ncampaign in Yorkshire; he led the vanguard in North America; he defended\r\nthe Brethren in many a pamphlet just after the Sifting-Time; he gave\r\ntheir broad theology literary form; and for thirty years, by his wisdom,\r\nhis skill, and his patience, he guided them through many a dangerous\r\nfinancial crisis. Amid all his labours he was modest, urbane and\r\ncheerful. In appearance his admirers called him apostolic. \"He looked,\"\r\nsaid one, \"as Peter must have looked when he stood before Ananias, or\r\nJohn, when he said, Little children, love each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"See there, Lavater,\" said another enthusiast, \"that is what a Christian\r\nlooks like.\"\r\n\r\nBut the noblest testimony was given by Becker, the editor of the German\r\nTimes. In an article in that paper, Becker related how once he had an\r\ninterview with Spangenberg, and how Spangenberg recounted some of his\r\nexperiences during the War in North America. The face of the Bishop was\r\naglow. The great editor was struck with amazement. At length he stepped\r\nnearer to the white-haired veteran, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Happy man! reveal to me your secret! What is it that makes you so\r\nstrong and calm? What light is this that illumines your soul? What power\r\nis this that makes you so content? Tell me, and make me happy for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"For this,\" replied the simple Spangenberg, his eyes shining with joy,\r\n\"for this I must thank my Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nThere lay the secret of Spangenberg's power; and there the secret of\r\nthe services rendered by the Brethren when pious evangelicals in Germany\r\ntrembled at the onslaught of the new theologians. For these services the\r\nBrethren have been both blamed and praised. According to that eminent\r\nhistorian, Ritschl, such men as Spangenberg were the bane of the\r\nLutheran Church. According to Dorner, the evangelical theologian, the\r\nBrethren helped to save the Protestant faith from ruin. \"When other\r\nChurches,\" says Dorner, \"were sunk in sleep, when darkness was almost\r\neverywhere, it was she, the humble priestess of the sanctuary, who fed\r\nthe sacred flame.\" Between two such doctors of divinity who shall judge?\r\nBut perhaps the philosopher, Kant, will be able to help us. He was\r\nin the thick of the rationalist movement; and he lived in the town\r\nof Königsberg, where the Brethren had a Society. One day a student\r\ncomplained to Kant that his philosophy did not bring peace to the heart.\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" replied the great philosopher, \"peace of heart you will never\r\nfind in my lecture room. If you want peace, you must go to that little\r\nMoravian Church over the way. That is the place to find peace.\"[143]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. -- A FALL AND A RECOVERY, 1800-1857.\r\n\r\nAs the Rationalist movement spread in Germany, it had two distinct\r\neffects upon the Brethren. The first was wholesome; the second was\r\nmorbid. At first it aroused them to a sense of their duty, and made\r\nthem gallant soldiers of the Cross; and then, towards the close of the\r\neighteenth century, it filled them with a horror of all changes and\r\nreforms and of all independence in thought and action. The chief cause\r\nof this sad change was the French Revolution. At first sight it may seem\r\nthat the French Revolution has little to do with our story; and Carlyle\r\ndoes not discuss this part of his subject. But no nation lives to\r\nitself; and Robespierre, Mirabeau and Marat shook the civilized world.\r\nIn England the French Revolution caused a general panic. At first, of\r\ncourse, it produced a few revolutionaries, of the stamp of Tom Paine;\r\nbut, on the whole, its general effect was to make our politicians afraid\r\nof changes, to strengthen the forces of conservatism, and thus to\r\nblock the path of the social and political reformer. Its effect on the\r\nBrethren was similar. As the news of its horrors spread through Europe,\r\ngood Christian people could not help feeling that all free thought\r\nled straight to atheism, and all change to revolution and murder; and,\r\ntherefore, the leading Brethren in Germany opposed liberty because\r\nthey were afraid of license, and reform because they were afraid of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nFor the long period, therefore of eighteen years, the Moravian Church\r\nin Germany remained at a standstill {1800-18.}. At Herrnhut the Brethren\r\nmet in a General Synod, and there the Conservatives won a signal\r\nvictory. Already the first shots in the battle had been fired, and\r\nalready the U.E.C. had taken stern measures. Instead of facing the\r\nsituation frankly, they first shut their own eyes and then tried to make\r\nothers as blind as themselves. At this Synod the deputy for Herrnhut\r\nwas a lawyer named Riegelmann; and, being desirous to do his duty\r\nefficiently, he had asked for a copy of the \"Synodal Results\" of\r\n1764 and 1769. His request was moderate and sensible. No deputy could\r\npossibly do his duty unless he knew the existing laws of the Church.\r\nBut his request was sternly refused. He was informed that no private\r\nindividual was entitled to a copy of the \"Results.\" Thus, at the opening\r\nof the nineteenth century, a false note was struck; and the Synod\r\ndeliberately prevented honest inquiry. Of the members, all but two\r\nwere church officials. For all practical purposes the laymen were\r\nunrepresented. At the head of the conservative party was Godfrey Cunow.\r\nIn vain some English ministers requested that the use of the Lot should\r\nno longer be enforced in marriages. The arguments of Cunow prevailed.\r\n\"Our entire constitution demands,\" he said, \"that in our settlements\r\nno marriage shall be contracted without the Lot.\" But the Brethren laid\r\ndown a still more depressing principle. For some years the older\r\nleaders had noticed, with feelings of mingled pain and horror, that\r\nrevolutionary ideas had found a home even in quiet Moravian settlements;\r\nand in order to keep such ideas in check, the Synod now adopted the\r\nprinciple that the true kernel of the Moravian Church consisted, not of\r\nall the communicant members, but only of a \"Faithful Few.\" We can hardly\r\ncall this encouraging. It tempted the \"Faithful Few\" to be Pharisees,\r\nand banned the rest as black sheep. And the Pastoral Letter, drawn up\r\nby the Synod, and addressed to all the congregations, was still more\r\ndisheartening. \"It will be better,\" ran one fatal sentence, \"for us to\r\ndecrease in numbers and increase in piety than to be a large multitude,\r\nlike a body without a spirit.\" We call easily see what such a sentence\r\nmeans. It means that the Brethren were afraid of new ideas, and resolved\r\nto stifle them in their birth.\r\n\r\nThe new policy produced strange results. At the Theological Seminary in\r\nNiesky the professors found themselves in a strange position. If they\r\ntaught the old theology of Spangenberg, they would be untrue to their\r\nconvictions; if they taught their convictions, they would be untrue\r\nto the Church; and, therefore, they solved the problem by teaching no\r\ntheology at all. Instead of lecturing on the Bible, they lectured now\r\non philosophy; instead of expounding the teaching of Christ and His\r\nApostles, they expounded the teaching of Kant, Fichte and Jacobi; and\r\nwhen the students became ministers, they had little but philosophy to\r\noffer the people. For ordinary people philosophy is as tasteless as\r\nthe white of an egg. As the preachers spoke far above the heads of the\r\npeople, they soon lost touch with their flocks; the hungry sheep looked\r\nup, and were not fed; the sermons were tinkling brass and clanging\r\ncymbal; and the ministers, instead of attending to their pastoral\r\nduties, were hidden away in their studies in clouds of philosophical and\r\ntheological smoke, and employed their time composing discourses, which\r\nneither they nor the people could understand. Thus the shepherds lived\r\nin one world, and the wandering sheep in another; and thus the bond\r\nof sympathy between pastor and people was broken. For this reason the\r\nMoravian Church in Germany began now to show signs of decay in moral\r\nand spiritual power; and the only encouraging signs of progress were the\r\nestablishment of the new settlement of Königsfeld in the Black Forest,\r\nthe Diaspora work in the Baltic Provinces, officially recognized by the\r\nCzar, the growth of the boarding-schools, and the extension of foreign\r\nmissions. In the boarding-schools the Brethren were at their best. At\r\nmost of them the pupils were prepared for confirmation, and the children\r\nof Catholics were admitted. But the life in the congregations was at\r\na low ebb. No longer were the Brethren's Houses homes of Christian\r\nfellowship; they were now little better than lodging-houses, and\r\nthe young men had become sleepy, frivolous, and even in some cases\r\nlicentious. For a short time the U.E.C. tried to remedy this evil by\r\nenforcing stricter rules; and when this vain proceeding failed, they\r\nthought of abolishing Brethren's Houses altogether. At the services in\r\nChurch the Bible was little read, and the people were content to feed\r\ntheir souls on the Hymn-book and the Catechism. The Diacony managers\r\nwere slothful in business, and the Diaconies ceased to pay. The\r\nsubscriptions to central funds dwindled. The fine property at Barby was\r\nabandoned. The Diaspora work was curtailed.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of decay was the growing use of the Lot. For that growth\r\nthe obvious reason was that, when the Brethren saw men adrift on every\r\nside, they felt that they themselves must have an anchor that would\r\nhold. It was even used in the boarding-schools. No pupil could be\r\nadmitted to a school unless his application had been confirmed by the\r\nLot.[144] No man could be a member of a Conference, no election was valid,\r\nno law was carried, no important business step was taken, without the\r\nconsent of the Lot. For example, it was by the decision of the Lot\r\nthat the Brethren abandoned their cause at Barby; and thus, afraid\r\nof intellectual progress, they submitted affairs of importance to an\r\nexternal artificial authority. Again and again the U.E.C. desired to\r\nsummon a Synod; and again and again the Lot rejected the proposal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another destructive force was working. Napoleon Buonaparte was\r\nscouring Europe, and the German settlements were constantly invaded by\r\nsoldiers. At Barby, Generals Murat and Bernadotte were lodged in the\r\ncastle, and entertained by the Warden. At Gnadau the French made the\r\nchapel their headquarters, killed and ate the live stock, ransacked the\r\nkitchens and cellars, cleared out the stores, and made barricades of the\r\ncasks, wheelbarrows and carts. At Neudietendorf the Prussians lay like\r\nlocusts. At Ebersdorf, Napoleon lodged in the Brethren's House, and\r\nquartered twenty or thirty of his men in every private dwelling. At\r\nKleinwelke, where Napoleon settled with the whole staff of the Grand\r\nArmy, the Single Sisters had to nurse two thousand wounded warriors;\r\nand the pupils in the boarding-school had to be removed to Uhyst. At\r\nGnadenberg the settlement was almost ruined. The furniture was smashed,\r\nthe beds were cut up, the tools of the tradesmen were spoiled, and the\r\nsoldiers took possession of the Sisters' House. But Napoleon afterwards\r\nvisited the settlement, declared that he knew the Brethren to be a quiet\r\nand peaceable people, and promised to protect them in future. He did\r\nnot, however, offer them any compensation; his promise of protection was\r\nnot fulfilled; and a few months later his own soldiers gutted the place\r\nagain. At Herrnhut, on one occasion, when the French were there, the\r\nchapel was illuminated, and a service was held to celebrate Napoleon's\r\nbirthday; and then a little later Blücher arrived on the scene, and\r\nsummoned the people to give thanks to God for a victory over the French.\r\nAt Niesky the whole settlement became a general infirmary. Amid scenes\r\nsuch as this Church progress was impossible. The cost in money was\r\nenormous. At Herrnhut alone the levies amounted to £3,000; to this must\r\nbe added the destruction of property and the feeding of thousands of\r\ntroops of both sides; and thus the Brethren's expenses were increased by\r\nmany thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, at Waterloo Napoleon met his conqueror; the great\r\ncriminal was captured and sent to St. Helena; and then, while he was\r\nplaying chess and grumbling at the weather, the Brethren met again at\r\nHerrnhut in another General Synod {1818.}. At this Synod some curious\r\nregulations were made. For the purpose of cultivating personal holiness,\r\nBishop Cunow proposed that henceforward the members of the Moravian\r\nChurch should be divided into two classes. In the first class he placed\r\nthe ordinary members--i.e., those who had been confirmed or who had\r\nbeen received from other Churches; and all belonging to this class\r\nwere allowed to attend Communion once a quarter. His second class was a\r\nsacred \"Inner Circle.\" It consisted of those, and only those, who made\r\na special religious profession. No one could be admitted to this \"Inner\r\nCircle\" without the sanction of the Lot; and none but those belonging to\r\nthe \"Circle\" could be members of the Congregation Council or Committee.\r\nAll members belonging to this class attended the Communion once a month.\r\nFor a wonder this strange resolution was carried, and remained in force\r\nfor seven years; and at bottom its ruling principle was that only those\r\nelected by the Lot had any real share in Church government. But the\r\nquestion of the Lot was still causing trouble. Again there came a\r\nrequest from abroad--this time from America--that it should no longer be\r\nenforced in marriages. For seven years the question was keenly debated,\r\nand the radicals had to fight very hard for victory. First the Synod\r\npassed a resolution that the Lot need not be used for marriages\r\nexcept in the regular settlements; then the members in the settlements\r\ngrumbled, and were granted the same privilege (1819), and only ministers\r\nand missionaries were compelled to marry by Lot; then the ministers\r\nbegged for liberty, and received the same privilege as the laymen\r\n(1825); and, finally, the missionaries found release (1836), and thus\r\nthe enforced use of the Lot in marriages passed out of Moravian history.\r\n\r\nBut the Brethren had better work on hand than to tinker with their\r\nconstitution. At the root of their troubles had been the neglect of the\r\nBible. In order, therefore, to restore the Bible to its proper position\r\nin Church esteem, the Brethren now established the Theological College\r\nat Gnadenfeld (1818). There John Plitt took the training of the students\r\nin hand; there systematic lectures were given on Exegesis, Dogmatics,\r\nOld Testament Introduction, Church History, and Brethren's History;\r\nthere, in a word, John Plitt succeeded in training a band of ministers\r\nwho combined a love for the Bible with love for the Brethren's Church.\r\nAt the same time, the Synod appointed an \"Educational Department\" in the\r\nU.E.C.; the boarding-schools were now more efficiently managed; and the\r\nnumber of pupils ran up to thirteen hundred.\r\n\r\nAmid this new life the sun rose on the morning of the 17th of June,\r\n1722, a hundred years after Christian David had felled the first tree\r\nat Herrnhut. The Brethren glanced at the past. The blood of the martyrs\r\nseemed dancing in their veins. At Herrnhut the archives of the Church\r\nhad been stored; Frederick Kölbing had ransacked the records; and only\r\na few months before he had produced his book, \"Memorial Days of the\r\nRenewed Brethren's Church.\" From hand to hand the volume passed, and was\r\nread with eager delight. The spirit of patriotic zeal was revived. Never\r\nsurely was there such a gathering in Herrnhut as on that Centenary Day.\r\nFrom all the congregations in Germany, from Denmark, from Sweden, from\r\nHolland, from Switzerland, from England, the Brethren streamed to thank\r\nthe Great Shepherd for His never-failing kindnesses. There were Brethren\r\nand friends of the Brethren, clergymen and laymen, poor peasants in\r\nsimple garb from the old homeland in Moravia, and high officials from\r\nthe Court of Saxony in purple and scarlet and gold. As the vast assembly\r\npressed into the Church, the trombones sounded forth, and the choir sang\r\nthe words of the Psalmist, so rich in historic associations: \"Here the\r\nsparrow hath found a home, and the swallow a nest for her young, even\r\nthine altars, oh, Lord of Hosts!\" It was a day of high jubilation and a\r\nday of penitent mourning; a day of festive robes and a day of sack-cloth\r\nand ashes. As the great throng, some thousands in number, and arranged\r\nin choirs, four and four, stood round the spot on the roadside where\r\nChristian David had raised his axe, and where a new memorial-stone now\r\nstood, they rejoiced because during those hundred years the seed had\r\nbecome a great tree, and they mourned because the branches had begun to\r\nwither and the leaves begun to fall. The chief speaker was John Baptist\r\nAlbertini, the old friend of Schleiermacher. Stern and clear was the\r\nmessage he gave; deep and full was the note it sounded. \"We have lost\r\nthe old love,\" he said; \"let us repent. Let us take a warning from\r\nthe past; let us return unto the Lord.\" With faces abashed, with heads\r\nbowed, with hearts renewed, with tears of sorrow and of joy in their\r\neyes, the Brethren went thoughtfully homewards.\r\n\r\nAt the next General Synod (1825), however, they made an alarming\r\ndiscovery. In spite of the revival of Church enthusiasm, they found that\r\nduring the last seven years they had lost no fewer than one thousand two\r\nhundred members; and, searching about to find the cause, they found it\r\nin Bishop Cunow's \"Inner Circle.\" It was time to abolish that \"Circle\";\r\nand abolished it therefore was.\r\n\r\nAt the next General Synod (1836), the Brethren took another step\r\nforward. In order to encourage the general study of the Bible, they\r\narranged that in every congregation regular Bible readings should be\r\nheld; and, in order to deepen the interest in evangelistic work, they\r\ndecreed that a prayer meeting should be held the first Monday of every\r\nmonth. At this meeting the topic of intercession was to be, not the mere\r\nprosperity of the Brethren, but the cultivation of good relations with\r\nother Churches and the extension of the Kingdom of God throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe next sign of progress was the wonderful revival in the Pædagogium\r\nat Niesky {1841.}. For nine years that important institution, where\r\nministerial candidates were trained before they entered the Theological\r\nSeminary, had been under the management of Frederick Immanuel\r\nKleinschmidt; and yet, despite his sternness and piety, the boys had\r\nshown but a meagre spirit of religion. If Kleinschmidt rebuked them,\r\nthey hated him; if he tried to admonish them privately, they told him\r\nfibs. There, at the very heart of the young Church life, religion was\r\nopenly despised; and the Pædagogium had now become little better than\r\nan ordinary private school. If a boy, for example, wished to read his\r\nBible, he had to do so in French, pretend that his purpose was simply\r\nto learn a new language, and thus escape the mockery of his schoolmates.\r\nThe case was alarming. If piety was despised in the school of the\r\nprophets, what pastors was Israel likely to have in the future?\r\n\r\nThe revival began very quietly. One boy, Prince Reuss, was summoned home\r\nto be present at his father's death-bed; and when he returned to the\r\nschool a few days later found himself met by an amount of sympathy which\r\nboys are not accustomed to show. A change of some kind had taken place\r\nduring his absence. The nightwatchman, Hager, had been heard praying in\r\nhis attic for the boys. A boy, in great trouble with a trigonometrical\r\nproblem which would not come right, had solved the difficulty by\r\nlinking work with prayer. The boys in the \"First Room\"--i.e., the elder\r\nboys--made an agreement to speak with one another openly before the Holy\r\nCommunion.\r\n\r\nAt length, on November 13th, when the Brethren in the other\r\ncongregations were celebrating the centenary of the Headship of Christ,\r\nthere occurred, at the evening Communion at Niesky, \"something new,\r\nsomething unusual, something mightily surprising.\" With shake of hand\r\nand without a word those elder boys made a solemn covenant to serve\r\nChrist. Among them were two who, fifty years later, were still famous\r\nMoravian preachers; and when they recalled the events of that evening\r\nthey could give no explanation to each other. \"It was,\" they said, in\r\nfond recollection, \"something unusual, but something great and holy,\r\nthat overcame us and moved us. It must have been the Spirit of Christ.\"\r\nFor those boys that wonderful Communion service had ever sacred\r\nassociations; and Bishop Wunderling, in telling the story, declared\r\nhis own convictions. \"The Lord took possession of the house,\" he said,\r\n\"bound all to one another and to Himself, and over all was poured the\r\nspirit of love and forgiveness, and a power from above was distributed\r\nfrom the enjoyment of the Communion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wonder was it,\" wrote one boy home, \"that when we brothers united\r\nto praise the Lord, He did not put to shame our longings and our faith,\r\nbut kindled others from our fire.\"\r\n\r\nIn this work the chief leaders were Kleinschmidt the headmaster, Gustave\r\nTietzen, Ferdinand Geller, and Ernest Reichel. At first, of course,\r\nthere was some danger that the boys would lose their balance; but the\r\nmasters, in true Moravian style, checked all signs of fanaticism. It is\r\nhardly correct to call the movement a revival. It is better to call it\r\nan awakening. It was fanned by historic memories, was very similar to\r\nthe first awakening at Herrnhut, and soon led to very similar results.\r\nNo groans, or tears, or morbid fancies marred the scene. In the\r\nplayground the games continued as usual. On every hand were radiant\r\nfaces, and groups in earnest chat. No one ever asked, \"Is so-and-so\r\nconverted?\" For those lads the burning question was, \"In what way can\r\nI be like Christ?\" As the boys retired to rest at night, they would ask\r\nthe masters to remember them in prayer, and the masters asked the\r\nsame in return of the boys. The rule of force was over. Before, old\r\nKleinschmidt, like our English Dr. Temple, had been feared as a \"just\r\nbeast.\" Now he was the lovable father. At revivals in schools it has\r\nsometimes happened that while the boys have looked more pious, they have\r\nnot always been more diligent and truthful; but at Niesky the boys now\r\nbecame fine models of industry, honesty and good manners. They confessed\r\ntheir faults to one another, gave each other friendly warnings, formed\r\nunions for prayer, applied the Bible to daily life, were conscientious\r\nin the class-room and in the playground; and then, when these golden\r\ndays were over, went out with tongues of flame to spread the news\r\nthrough the Church. The real test of a revival is its lasting effect on\r\ncharacter. If it leads to selfish dreaming, it is clay; if it leads to\r\nlife-long sacrifice, it is gold; and well the awakening at Niesky stood\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\nAt the next General Synod all present could see that the Moravian Church\r\nwas now restored to full life, and the American deputies, who had\r\ncome to see her decently interrred, were amazed at her hopefulness and\r\nvigour. At that Synod the signs of vigorous life were many {1848.}. For\r\nthe first time the Brethren opened their meetings to the public, allowed\r\nreporters to be present, and had the results of their proceedings\r\nprinted and sold. For the first time they now resolved that, instead of\r\nshutting themselves up in settlements, they would try, where possible,\r\nto establish town and country congregations. For the first time they\r\nnow agreed that, in the English and American congregations, new members\r\nmight be received without the sanction of the Lot. Meanwhile, the boys\r\nawakened at Niesky were already in harness. Some had continued their\r\nstudies at Gnadenfeld, and were now powerful preachers. Some had become\r\nteachers at Königsfeld, Kleinwelke, and Neuwied. Some were preaching the\r\nGospel in foreign lands. Along the Rhine, in South and West Germany, in\r\nMetz and the Wartebruch, and in Russian Poland, the Brethren opened new\r\nfields of Diaspora work; and away in the broadening mission field the\r\nenergy was greater than ever. In Greenland a new station was founded at\r\nFriedrichstal; in Labrador, at Hebron; in Surinam, at Bambey; in South\r\nAfrica, at Siloh and Goshen; on the Moskito Coast, at Bluefields; in\r\nAustralia, at Ebenezer; and in British India, near Tibet, at Kyelang.\r\n\r\nAnd thus our narrative brings us down to 1857. We may pause to sum\r\nup results. If a church is described as making progress, most readers\r\ngenerally wish to know how many new congregations she has founded, and\r\nhow many members she has gained. But progress of that kind was not what\r\nthe Brethren desired; and during the period covered by this chapter\r\nthey founded only one new congregation. They had still only seventeen\r\ncongregations in Germany, in the proper sense of that word; but, on the\r\nother hand, they had fifty-nine Diaspora centres, and about one hundred\r\nand fifty Diaspora workers. At the heart, therefore, of all their\r\nendeavours we see the design, not to extend the Moravian Church, but to\r\nhold true to the old ideals of Zinzendorf. In that sense, at least, they\r\nhad made good progress. They showed to the world a spirit of brotherly\r\nunion; they were on good terms with other Churches; they made their\r\nschools and their Diaspora centres homes of Christian influence; and,\r\nabove all, like a diamond set in gold, there flashed still with its\r\nancient lustre the missionary spirit of the fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. -- THE BRITISH COLLAPSE, 1760-1801.\r\n\r\nOf all the problems raised by the history of the Brethren, the most\r\ndifficult to solve is the one we have now to face. In the days of John\r\nWesley, the Moravians in England were famous; in the days of Robertson,\r\nof Brighton, they were almost unknown. For a hundred years the Moravians\r\nin England played so obscure and modest a part in our national life that\r\nour great historians, such as Green and Lecky, do not even notice their\r\nexistence, and the problem now before us is, what caused this swift and\r\nmysterious decline?\r\n\r\nAs the companions of Zinzendorf--Boehler, Cennick, Rogers and\r\nOkeley--passed one by one from the scenes of their labours, there\r\ntowered above the other English Brethren a figure of no small grandeur.\r\nIt was Benjamin La Trobe, once a famous preacher in England. He sprang\r\nfrom a Huguenot family, and had first come forward in Dublin. He had\r\nbeen among the first there to give a welcome to John Cennick, had held\r\nto Cennick when others left him, had helped to form a number of his\r\nhearers into the Dublin congregation, and had been with Cennick on his\r\nromantic journey's among the bogs and cockpits of Ulster. As the years\r\nrolled on, he came more and more to the front. At Dublin he had met a\r\nteacher of music named Worthington, and a few years later La Trobe and\r\nWorthington were famous men at Fulneck. When Fulneck chapel was being\r\nbuilt, La Trobe stood upon the roof of a house to preach. When the\r\nchapel was finished, La Trobe became Brethren's labourer, and his friend\r\nWorthington played the organ. In those days Fulneck Chapel was not large\r\nenough to hold the crowds that came, and La Trobe had actually to stand\r\nupon the roof to harangue the vast waiting throng. As Cennick had been\r\nbefore in Ireland, so La Trobe was now in England. He was far above most\r\npreachers of his day. \"He enraptured his audience,\" says an old account,\r\n\"by his resistless eloquence. His language flowed like rippling streams,\r\nand his ideas sparkled like diamonds. His taste was perfect, and his\r\nillustrations were dazzling; and when he painted the blackness of the\r\nhuman heart, when he depicted the matchless grace of Christ, when\r\nhe described the beauty of holiness, he spoke with an energy, with\r\na passion, with a dignified sweep of majestic power which probed the\r\nheart, and pricked the conscience, and charmed the troubled breast.\" It\r\nwas he of whom it is so quaintly recorded in a congregation diary: \"Br.\r\nLa Trobe spoke much on many things.\"\r\n\r\nFor twenty-one years this brilliant preacher was the chief manager of\r\nthe Brethren's work in England; and yet, though he was not a German\r\nhimself, his influence was entirely German in character {1765-86.}. He\r\nwas manager of the Brethren's English finances; he was appointed to\r\nhis office by the German U.E.C.; and thus, along with James Hutton as\r\nSecretary, he acted as official representative of the Directing Board in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn many ways his influence was all for good. He helped to restore to\r\nvigorous life the \"Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel\" (1768)\r\nremained its President till his death, and did much to further its\r\nwork in Labrador. He was a diligent writer and translator. He wrote a\r\n\"Succinct View of the Missions\" of the Brethren (1771), and thus brought\r\nthe subject of foreign missions before the Christian public; and in\r\norder to let inquirers know what sort of people the Moravians really\r\nwere, he translated and published Spangenberg's \"Idea of Faith,\"\r\nSpangenberg's \"Concise Account of the Present Constitution of the Unitas\r\nFratrum,\" and David Cranz's \"History of the Brethren.\" The result\r\nwas good. The more people read these works by La Trobe, the more they\r\nrespected the Brethren. \"In a variety of publications,\" said the London\r\nChronicle, \"he removed every aspersion against the Brethren, and firmly\r\nestablished their reputation.\" He was well known in higher circles,\r\nwas the friend of Dr. Johnson, and worked in union with such well-known\r\nEvangelical leaders as Rowland Hill, William Romaine, John Newton,\r\nCharles Wesley, Hannah More, Howell Harris, and Bishop Porteous, the\r\nfamous advocate of negro emancipation. Above all, he cleansed the\r\nBrethren's reputation from the last stains of the mud thrown by such men\r\nas Rimius and Frey. He was a friend of the Bishop of Chester; he was a\r\npopular preacher in Dissenting and Wesleyan Chapels; he addressed Howell\r\nHarris's students at Trevecca; he explained the Brethren's doctrines\r\nand customs to Lord Hillsborough, the First Commissioner of the Board\r\nof Trade and Plantations; and thus by his pen, by his wisdom and by his\r\neloquence, he caused the Brethren to be honoured both by Anglicans and\r\nby Dissenters. At this period James Hutton--now a deaf old man--was\r\na favourite at the Court of George III. No longer were the Brethren\r\ndenounced as immoral fanatics; no longer did John Wesley feel it his\r\nduty to expose their errors. As John Wesley grew older and wiser, he\r\nbegan to think more kindly of the Brethren. He renewed his friendship\r\nwith James Hutton, whom he had not seen for twenty-five years (Dec. 21,\r\n1771); he visited Bishop John Gambold in London, and recorded the event\r\nin his Journal with the characteristic remark, \"Who but Count Zinzendorf\r\ncould have separated such friends as we are?\" He called, along with his\r\nbrother Charles, on John de Watteville at Lindsey House; and, above all,\r\nwhen Lord Lyttleton, in his book \"Dialogues of the Dead,\" attacked the\r\ncharacter of the Brethren, John Wesley himself spoke out nobly in their\r\ndefence. \"Could his lordship,\" he wrote in his Journal (August 30th,\r\n1770), \"show me in England many more sensible men than Mr. Gambold and\r\nMr. Okeley? And yet both of these were called Moravians...What sensible\r\nMoravian, Methodist or Hutchinsonian did he ever calmly converse with?\r\nWhat does he know of them but from the caricatures drawn by Bishop\r\nLavington or Bishop Warburton? And did he ever give himself the\r\ntrouble of reading the answers to these warm, lively men? Why should a\r\ngood-natured and a thinking man thus condemn whole bodies by the lump?\"\r\nBut the pleasantest proof of Wesley's good feeling was still to come.\r\nAt the age of eighty he went over to Holland, visited the Brethren's\r\nbeautiful settlement at Zeist, met there his old friend, Bishop Anthony\r\nSeifferth, and asked to hear some Moravian music and singing. The\r\nday was Wesley's birthday. As it happened, however, to be \"Children's\r\nPrayer-Day\" as well, the minister, being busy with many meetings, was\r\nnot able to ask Wesley to dinner; and, therefore, he invited him instead\r\nto come to the children's love-feast. John Wesley went to the chapel,\r\ntook part in the love-feast, and heard the little children sing a\r\n\"Birth-Day Ode\" in his honour {June 28th, 1783.}. The old feud between\r\nMoravians and Methodists was over. It ended in the children's song.[145]\r\nOne instance will show La Trobe's reputation in England {1777.}. At that\r\ntime there lived in London a famous preacher, Dr. Dodd; and now, to\r\nthe horror of all pious people, Dr. Dodd was accused and convicted of\r\nembezzlement, and condemned to death. Never was London more excited.\r\nA petition with twenty-three thousand signatures was sent up in Dodd's\r\nbehalf. Frantic plots were made to rescue the criminal from prison. But\r\nDodd, in his trouble, was in need of spiritual aid; and the two men for\r\nwhom he sent were John Wesley and La Trobe. By Wesley he was visited\r\nthrice; by La Trobe, at his own request, repeatedly; and La Trobe was\r\nthe one who brought comfort to his soul, stayed with him till the end,\r\nand afterwards wrote an official account of his death.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, on the other hand, the policy now pursued by La Trobe was\r\nthe very worst policy possible for the Moravians in England. For that\r\npolicy, however, we must lay the blame, not on the man, but on the\r\nsystem under which he worked. As long as the Brethren's Church in\r\nEngland was under the control of the U.E.C., it followed, as a matter\r\nof course, that German ideas would be enforced on British soil; and\r\nalready, at the second General Synod, the Brethren had resolved that the\r\nBritish work must be conducted on German lines. Never did the Brethren\r\nmake a greater blunder in tactics. In Germany the system had a measure\r\nof success, and has flourished till the present day; in England it was\r\ndoomed to failure at the outset. La Trobe gave the system a beautiful\r\nname. He called it the system of \"United Flocks.\" On paper it was lovely\r\nto behold; in practice it was the direct road to consumption. In name it\r\nwas English enough; in nature it was Zinzendorf's Diaspora. At no period\r\nhad the Brethren a grander opportunity of extending their borders in\r\nEngland than during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\nIn Yorkshire, with Fulneck as a centre, they had four flourishing\r\ncongregations, societies in Bradford and Leeds, and preaching places\r\nas far away as Doncaster and Kirby Lonsdale, in Westmoreland. In\r\nLancashire, with Fairfield as a centre, they were opening work in\r\nManchester and Chowbent. In Cheshire, with Dukinfield as a centre, they\r\nhad a number of societies on the \"Cheshire Plan,\" including a rising\r\ncause at Bullock-Smithy, near Stockport. In the Midlands, with Ockbrook\r\nas a centre, they had preaching places in a dozen surrounding villages.\r\nIn Bedfordshire, with Bedford as a centre, they had societies at\r\nRiseley, Northampton, Eydon, Culworth and other places. In Wales, with\r\nHaverfordwest as a centre, they had societies at Laughharne, Fishguard,\r\nCarmarthen and Carnarvon. In Scotland, with Ayre[146] as a centre, they\r\nhad societies at Irvine and Tarbolton, and preaching-places at Annan,\r\nBlackhall, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kilsyth, Kilmarnock, Ladyburn,\r\nPrestwick, Westtown, and twenty smaller places. In the West of England,\r\nwith Bristol and Tytherton as centres, they had preaching-places at\r\nApperley, in Gloucestershire; Fome and Bideford, in Somerset; Plymouth\r\nand Exeter, in Devon; and many villages in Wiitshire. In the North\r\nof Ireland, with Gracehill as a centre, they had preaching-places at\r\nDrumargan, Billies, Arva (Cavan), and many other places.\r\n\r\nFor the Brethren, therefore, the critical question was, what to do with\r\nthe societies and preaching-places? There lay the secret of success or\r\nfailure; and there they committed their great strategic blunder. They\r\nhad two alternatives before them. The one was to treat each society or\r\npreaching-place as the nucleus of a future congregation; the other was\r\nto keep it as a mere society. And the Brethren, in obedience to orders\r\nfrom Germany, chose the latter course. At the Moravian congregations\r\nproper the strictest rules were enforced; in most congregations there\r\nwere Brethren's and Sisters' Houses; and all full members of the\r\nMoravian Church had to sign a document known as the \"Brotherly\r\nAgreement.\" {1771.} In that document the Brethren gave some remarkable\r\npledges. They swore fidelity to the Augsburg Confession. They promised\r\nto do all in their power to help the Anglican Church, and to encourage\r\nall her members to be loyal to her. They declared that they would never\r\nproselytize from any other denomination. They promised that no marriage\r\nshould take place without the consent of the Elders; that all children\r\nmust be educated in one of the Brethren's schools; that they would help\r\nto support the widows, old people and orphans; that no member should set\r\nup in business without the consent of the Elders; that they would\r\nnever read any books of a harmful nature. At each congregation these\r\nrules--and others too many to mention here--were read in public once\r\na year; each member had a printed copy, and any member who broke the\r\n\"Agreement\" was liable to be expelled. Thus the English Brethren signed\r\ntheir names to an \"Agreement\" made in Germany, and expressing German\r\nideals of religious life. If it never became very popular, we need\r\nnot wonder. But this \"Agreement\" was not binding on the societies and\r\npreaching-places. As the Brethren in Germany founded societies without\r\nturning them into settlements, so the Brethren in England conducted\r\npreaching-places without turning them into congregations and without\r\nasking their hearers to become members of the Moravian Church; and a\r\nstrict rule was laid down that only such hearers as had a \"distinct call\r\nto the Brethren's Church\" should be allowed to join it. The\r\ndistinct call came through the Lot. At nearly all the societies and\r\npreaching-places, therefore, the bulk of the members were flatly refused\r\nadmission to the Moravian Church; they remained, for the most part,\r\nmembers of the Church of England; and once a quarter, with a Moravian\r\nminister at their head, they marched in procession to the Communion in\r\nthe parish church. For unselfishness this policy was unmatched; but\r\nit nearly ruined the Moravian Church in England. At three\r\nplaces--Woodford,[147] Baildon and Devonport--the Brethren turned\r\nsocieties into congregations; but most of the others were sooner or\r\nlater abandoned. In Yorkshire the Brethren closed their chapel at\r\nPudsey, and abandoned their societies at Holbeck, Halifax, Wibsey and\r\nDoncaster. At Manchester they gave up their chapel in Fetter Lane.\r\nIn Cheshire they retreated from Bullock Smithy; in the Midlands from\r\nNorthampton; in London from Chelsea; in Somerset from Bideford and\r\nFrome; in Devon from Exeter and Plymouth; in Gloucestershire from\r\nApperley; in Scotland from Irvine, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dumfries and\r\nthirty or forty other places;[148] in Wales from Fishguard, Laugharn,\r\nCarmarthen and Carnarvon; in Ireland from Arva, Billies, Drumargan,\r\nBallymena, Gloonen, Antrim, Dromore, Crosshill, Artrea, Armagh, and so\r\non. And the net result of this policy was that when Bishop Holmes, the\r\nBrethren's Historian, published his \"History of the Brethren\" (1825),\r\nhe had to record the distressing fact that in England the Moravians\r\nhad only twenty congregations, in Ireland only six, and that the total\r\nnumber of members was only four thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven.\r\nThe question is sometimes asked to-day: How is it that the Moravian\r\nChurch is so small? For that smallness more reasons than one may be\r\ngiven; but one reason was certainly the singular policy expounded in the\r\npresent chapter.[149]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. -- THE BRITISH ADVANCE, 1801-1856.\r\n\r\nBut our problem is not yet solved. As soon as the nineteenth century\r\nopened, the Brethren began to look forward with hope to the future; and\r\ntheir leading preachers still believed in the divine and holy calling\r\nof the Moravian Church. Of those preachers the most famous was Christian\r\nFrederick Ramftler. He was a typical Moravian minister. He was a type in\r\nhis character, in his doctrine, and in his fortunes. He came of an old\r\nMoravian family, and had martyr's blood in his veins. He was born at\r\nthe Moravian settlement at Barby (1780). At the age of six he attended\r\na Good Friday service, and was deeply impressed by the words, \"He bowed\r\nhis head and gave up the ghost\"; and although he could never name the\r\ndate of his conversion, he was able to say that his religion was based\r\non the love of Christ and on the obligation to love Christ in return.\r\nAt the age of seven he was sent to the Moravian school at Kleinwelke;\r\nhe then entered the Pædagogium at Barby, and completed his education by\r\nstudying theology at Niesky. At that place he was so anxious to\r\npreach the Gospel that, as he had no opportunity of preaching in the\r\ncongregation, he determined to preach to the neighbouring Wends; and,\r\nas he knew not a word of their language, he borrowed one of their\r\nminister's sermons, learned it by heart, ascended the pulpit, and\r\ndelivered the discourse with such telling energy that the delighted\r\npeople exclaimed: \"Oh, that this young man might always preach to us\r\ninstead of our sleepy parson.\" For that freak he was gravely rebuked by\r\nthe U.E.C., and he behaved with more discretion in the future. For\r\ntwo years he served the Church as a schoolmaster, first at\r\nNeusalz-on-the-Oder, and then at Uhyst; and then, to his surprise,\r\nhe received a call to England. For the moment he was staggered. He\r\nconsulted the Lot; the Lot gave consent; and, therefore, to England\r\nhe came. For six years he now served as master in the Brethren's\r\nboarding-school at Fairfield; and then, in due course, he was called as\r\nminister to the Brethren's congregation at Bedford. As soon, however, as\r\nhe accepted the call, he was informed that he would have to marry; his\r\nwife was found for him by the Church; the marriage turned out a happy\r\none; and thus, with her as an official helpmate, he commenced\r\nhis ministerial career (1810). At Bedford he joined with other\r\nministers--such as Legh Richmond and S. Hillyard--in founding Bible\r\nassociations. At Fulneck--where he was stationed twelve years--he was so\r\nbeloved by his congregation that one member actually said: \"During seven\r\nyears your name has not once been omitted in our family prayers.\" At\r\nBristol he was noted for his missionary zeal, took an interest in the\r\nconversion of the Jews, and often spoke at public meetings on behalf of\r\nthe Church Missionary Society; and in one year he travelled a thousand\r\nmiles on behalf of the \"London Association in aid of Moravian Missions.\"\r\nIn manner he was rough and abrupt; at heart he was gentle as a woman.\r\nHe was a strict disciplinarian, a keen questioner, and an unflinching\r\ndemander of a Christian walk. Not one jot or tittle would he allow his\r\npeople to yield to the loose ways of the world. In his sermons he dealt\r\nhard blows at cant; and in his private conversation he generally managed\r\nto put his finger upon the sore spot. One day a collier came to see him,\r\nand complained, in a rather whining tone, that the path of his life was\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n\"H'm,\" growled Ramftler, who hated sniffling, \"is it darker than it was\r\nin the coal-pit?\"\r\n\r\nThe words proved the collier's salvation.\r\n\r\nIn all his habits Ramftler was strictly methodical. He always rose\r\nbefore six; he always finished his writing by eleven; and he kept a list\r\nof the texts from which he preached. As that list has been preserved, we\r\nare able to form some notion of his style; and the chief point to notice\r\nis that his preaching was almost entirely from the New Testament.\r\nAt times, of course, he gave his people systematic lectures on the\r\nPatriarchs, the Prophets and the Psalms; but, speaking, broadly, his\r\nfavourite topic was the Passion History. Above all, like most Moravian\r\nministers, he was an adept in dealing with children. At the close of the\r\nSunday morning service, he came down from the pulpit, took his seat at\r\nthe Communion table, put the children through their catechism, and then\r\nasked all who wished to be Christians to come and take his hand.\r\n\r\nAt length, towards the close of his life, he was able to take some part\r\nin pioneer work. Among his numerous friends at Bristol was a certain\r\nLouis West.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never thought,\" said Ramftler, \"of becoming a preacher of the\r\nGospel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" replied West, \"I shall die a Moravian minister yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Die as a minister!\" snapped Ramftler. \"You ought to live as one!\"\r\n\r\nThe words soon came true. In response to an invitation from some pious\r\npeople, Ramftler paid a visit to Brockweir, a little village on the\r\nWye, a few miles above Tintern. The village was a hell on earth. It was\r\nwithout a church, and possessed seven public-houses. There was a field\r\nof labour for the Brethren. As soon as Ramftler could collect the money,\r\nhe had a small church erected, laid the corner-stone himself, and had\r\nthe pleasure of seeing West the first minister of the new congregation.\r\n\r\nAnd like Ramftler was many another of kindred blood. At Wyke, John\r\nSteinhauer (1773-76), the children's friend, had a printing press,\r\nwherewith he printed hymns and passages of Scripture in days when\r\nchildren's books were almost unknown. At Fulneck the famous teacher, Job\r\nBradley, served for forty-five years (1765-1810), devoted his life to\r\nthe spiritual good of boys, and summed up the passion of his life in the\r\nwords he was often heard to sing:--\r\n\r\n   Saviour, Saviour, love the children;\r\n   Children, children, love the Saviour.\r\n\r\nAt Kimbolton, Bishop John King Martyn founded a new congregation. At\r\nKilwarlin, Basil Patras Zula revived a flagging cause. If the Moravian\r\nChurch was small in England, it was not because her ministers were idle,\r\nor because they were lacking in moral and spiritual power.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, fine characters though they were, these men could do little\r\nfor Church extension. They were still tied down by the \"Brotherly\r\nAgreement.\" They aimed at quality rather than quantity. As long as\r\nthe Brethren's work in England remained under German management, that\r\n\"Brotherly Agreement\" remained their charter of faith and practice.\r\nFor power and place they had not the slightest desire. At their public\r\nservice on Sunday mornings they systematically joined in the prayer,\r\n\"From the unhappy desire of becoming great, preserve us, gracious Lord\r\nand God.\" As long as they were true to the Agreement and the Bible, they\r\ndo not appear to have cared very much whether they increased in numbers\r\nor not. For them the only thing that mattered was the cultivation of\r\npersonal holiness. As the preaching-places fell away they devoted their\r\nattention more and more to the care of the individual. They had a deep\r\nreverence for the authority of Scripture. No man could be a member\r\nof the Moravian Church unless he promised to read his Bible and hold\r\nregular family worship. \"The Bible,\" ran one clause of the Agreement,\r\n\"shall be our constant study; we will read it daily in our families,\r\nwith prayer for the influence of the Holy Spirit of God.\" If that duty\r\nwas broken, the member was liable to expulsion. And the same held\r\ngood with the other clauses of the \"Agreement.\" We often read in the\r\ncongregation diaries of members being struck off the rolls for various\r\nsins. For cursing, for lying, for slandering, for evil-speaking, for\r\nfraud, for deceit, for drunkenness, for sabbath breaking, for gambling\r\nor any other immorality--for all these offences the member, if he\r\npersisted in his sin, was summarily expelled. In some of their ideals\r\nthe Brethren were like the Puritans; in others like the Quakers. They\r\nwere modest in dress, never played cards, and condemned theatres and\r\ndancing as worldly follies. As they still entertained a horror of war,\r\nthey preferred not to serve as soldiers; and any Moravian could obtain\r\na certificate from the magistrates exempting him from personal military\r\nservice.[150] At the same time, they were loyal to Church and State, had\r\na great love for the Church of England, regarded that Church as the\r\nbulwark of Protestantism, detested Popery, and sometimes spoke of the\r\nPope as the Man of Sin. And yet, sturdy Protestants though they were,\r\nthey had a horror of religious strife. \"We will abstain from religious\r\ncontroversy,\" was another clause in the Agreement; and, therefore, they\r\nnever took any part in the religious squabbles of the age. For example,\r\nthe Brethren took no part in the fight for Catholic emancipation. As\r\nthey did not regard themselves as Dissenters, they declined to join the\r\nrising movement for the separation of Church and State; and yet, on the\r\nother hand, they lived on good terms with all Evangelical Christians,\r\nand willingly exchanged pulpits with Methodists and Dissenters. At this\r\nperiod their chief doctrine was redemption through the blood of Christ.\r\nI have noticed, in reading the memoirs of the time, that although the\r\nauthors differed in character, they were all alike in their spiritual\r\nexperiences. They all spoke of themselves as \"poor sinners\"; they all\r\ncondemned their own self-righteousness; and they all traced what virtues\r\nthey possessed to the meritorious sufferings of the Redeemer. Thus the\r\nBrethren stood for a Puritan standard, a Bible religion and a broad\r\nEvangelical Faith. \"Yon man,\" said Robert Burns's father in Ayr, \"prays\r\nto Christ as though he were God.\" But the best illustration of the\r\nBrethren's attitude is the story of the poet himself. As Robert and\r\nhis brother Gilbert were on their way one Sunday morning to the parish\r\nchurch at Tarbolton, they fell in with an old Moravian named William\r\nKirkland; and before long the poet and Kirkland began discussing\r\ntheology. Burns defended the New Lights, the Moravian the Old Lights.\r\nAt length Burns, finding his arguments of no avail, exclaimed: \"Oh, I\r\nsuppose I've met with the Apostle Paul this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" retorted the Moravian Evangelical, \"you have not met the Apostle\r\nPaul; but I think I have met one of those wild beasts which he says he\r\nfought with at Ephesus.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Brethren showed other signs of vigour. The first, and one\r\nof the most influential, was their system of public school education.\r\nAt the General Synod in 1782 a resolution had been passed that education\r\nshould be a recognized branch of Church work; and, therefore, following\r\nthe example set in Germany, the English Brethren now opened a number of\r\npublic boarding-schools. In 1782-1785 they began to admit non-Moravians\r\nto the two schools already established at Fulneck. In 1792 they opened\r\ngirls' schools at Dukinfield and Gomersal; in 1794 a girls' school at\r\nWyke; in 1796 a girls' school at Fairfield; in 1798 a girls' school at\r\nGracehill; in 1799 a girls' school at Ockbrook; in 1801 a boys' school\r\nat Fairfield, and a girls' school at Bedford; in 1805 a boys' school at\r\nGracehill; and, in 1813, a boys' school at Ockbrook. At these schools\r\nthe chief object of the Brethren was the formation of Christian\r\ncharacter. They were all established at settlements or at flourishing\r\ncongregations, and the pupils lived in the midst of Moravian life. For\r\nsome years the religion taught was unhealthy and mawkish, and both boys\r\nand girls were far too strictly treated. They were not allowed to play\r\ncompetitive games; they were under the constant supervision of teachers;\r\nthey had scarcely any exercise but walks; and they were often rather\r\nencouraged in the notion that it was desirable to die young. At one time\r\nthe girls at Fulneck complained that not one of their number had died\r\nfor six months; and one of the Fulneck records runs: \"By occasion of\r\nthe smallpox our Saviour held a rich harvest among the children, many of\r\nwhom departed in a very blessed manner.\" As long as such morbid ideas as\r\nthese were taught, both boys and girls became rather maudlin characters.\r\nThe case of the boys at Fulneck illustrates the point. They attended\r\nservices every night in the week; they heard a great deal of the\r\nphysical sufferings of Christ; they were encouraged to talk about their\r\nspiritual experiences; and yet they were often found guilty of lying, of\r\nstealing, and of other more serious offences. At first, too, a good many\r\nof the masters were unlearned and ignorant men. They were drafted in\r\nfrom the Brethren's Houses; they taught only the elementary subjects;\r\nthey had narrow ideas of life; and, instead of teaching the boys to be\r\nmanly and fight their own battles, they endeavoured rather to shield\r\nthem from the world. But as time went on this coddling system was\r\nmodified. The standard of education was raised; the masters were often\r\nlearned men preparing for the ministry; the laws against competitive\r\ngames were repealed; and the religious instruction became more sensible\r\nand practical. If the parents desired it, their children, at a suitable\r\nage, were prepared for confirmation, confirmed by the local Moravian\r\nminister, and admitted to the Moravian Communion service. The pupils\r\ncame from all denominations. Sometimes even Catholics sent their\r\nchildren, and allowed them to receive religious instruction.[151] But no\r\nattempt was ever made to make proselytes. For many years these schools\r\nenjoyed a high reputation as centres of high-class education and of\r\nstrict moral discipline. At all these schools the Brethren made much of\r\nmusic; and the music was all of a solemn devotional character.\r\n\r\n\"The music taught,\" said Christian Ignatuis La Trobe, \"is both vocal and\r\ninstrumental; the former is, however, confined to sacred compositions,\r\ncongregational, choral, and orchestral, the great object being to turn\r\nthis divine art to the best account for the service and edification of\r\nthe Church.\" At that time (about 1768) the dormitory of Fulneck Boys'\r\nSchool was over the chapel; and La Trobe tells us how he would keep\r\nhimself awake at night to hear the congregation sing one of the\r\nLiturgies to the Father, Son and Spirit.[152] Thus the Brethren, true to\r\ntheir old ideal, endeavoured to teach the Christian religion without\r\nadding to the numbers of the Moravian Church. It is hardly possible to\r\nover-estimate the influence of these schools. In Ireland the schools\r\nat Gracehill were famous. The pupils came from the highest ranks of\r\nsociety. At one time it used to be said that the mere fact that a boy or\r\ngirl had been educated at Gracehill was a passport to the best society.\r\nIn Yorkshire the Brethren were educational pioneers. The most famous\r\npupil of the Brethren was Richard Oastler. At the age of eight (1797)\r\nthat great reformer--the Factory King--was sent by his parents to\r\nFulneck School; and years later, in an address to the boys, he reminded\r\nthem how great their privileges were. \"Ah, boys,\" he said, \"let me\r\nexhort you to value your privileges. I know that the privileges of a\r\nFulneck schoolboy are rare.\"\r\n\r\nBut the greatest influence exercised by the Brethren was in the cause\r\nof foreign missions. For that blessing we may partly thank Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte. As that eminent philanthropist scoured the continent of\r\nEurope, he had no intention of aiding the missionary cause; but one\r\nresult of his exploits was that when Christian people in England heard\r\nhow grievously the German Brethren had suffered at his hands their\r\nhearts were filled with sympathy and the desire to help. At Edinburgh\r\na number of gentlemen founded the \"Edinburgh Association in Aid of\r\nMoravian Missions\"; at Glasgow others founded the \"Glasgow Auxiliary\r\nSociety\"; at Bristol and London some ladies formed the \"Ladies'\r\nAssociation\" (1813); in Yorkshire the Brethren themselves formed the\r\n\"Yorkshire Society for the Spread of the Gospel among the Heathen\"\r\n(1827); at Sheffield James Montgomery, the Moravian poet, appealed to\r\nthe public through his paper, the Iris; and the result was that in\r\none year subscriptions to Moravian Missions came in from the Church\r\nMissionary Society, and from other missionary and Bible societies. In\r\nScotland money was collected annually at Edinburgh, Elgin, Dumfries,\r\nHorndean, Haddington, Kincardine, Perth, Falkirk, Jedwater,\r\nCalton, Bridgetown, Denny, Greenock, Stirling, Paisley, Anstruther,\r\nInverkeithing, Aberdeen, Lochwinnoch, Leith, Tranent, St. Ninian's,\r\nBrechin, Montrose; in England at Bath, Bristol, Birmingham, Henley,\r\nBerwick, St. Neots, Bedford, Northampton, Colchester, York, Cambridge;\r\nin Ireland at Ballymena, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Lurgan, Cookstown,\r\nDublin. As the interest of Englishmen in Foreign Missions was still in\r\nits infancy, a long list like this is remarkable. But the greatest proof\r\nof the rising interest in missions was the foundation of the \"London\r\nAssociation in Aid of Moravian Missions\" (1817). It was not a Moravian\r\nSociety. The founders were mostly Churchmen; but the basis was\r\nundenominational, and membership was open to all who were willing to\r\nsubscribe. At first the amount raised by the Association was a little\r\nover £1,000 a year; but as time went on the annual income increased,\r\nand in recent years it has sometimes amounted to £17,000. It is hard to\r\nmention a nobler instance of broad-minded charity. For some years the\r\nsecretary of this Association has generally been an Anglican clergyman;\r\nhe pleads for Moravian Missions in parish churches; the annual sermon is\r\npreached in St. Paul's Cathedral; and thus the Brethren are indebted to\r\nAnglican friends for many thousands of pounds. Another proof of interest\r\nin Moravian Missions was the publication of books on the subject by\r\nnon-Moravian writers. At Edinburgh an anonymous writer published \"The\r\nMoravians in Greenland\" (1830) and \"The Moravians in Labrador\" (1833).\r\nThus the Brethren had quickened missionary enthusiasm in every part of\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt home, meanwhile, the Brethren moved more slowly. As they did not wish\r\nto interfere with the Church of England, they purposely confined their\r\nforward movement almost entirely to villages and neglected country\r\ndistricts. In 1806 they built a chapel in the little village of Priors\r\nMarston, near Woodford; in 1808 they founded the congregation at\r\nBaildon, Yorkshire; in 1818 they began holding services at Stow, near\r\nBedford; in 1823 they founded the congregation at Kimbolton; in\r\n1827 they founded the congregation at Pertenhall; in 1833 at\r\nBrockweir-on-the-Wye; in 1834 they started a cause at Stratford-on-Avon,\r\nbut abandoned it in 1839; in 1836 at Salem, Oldham. In 1829 they founded\r\nthe Society for Propagating the Gospel in Ireland; in 1839 they\r\nbegan holding services at Tillbrook, near Bedford; and in 1839 they\r\nendeavoured, though in vain, to establish a new congregation at Horton,\r\nBradford. In comparison with the number of societies abandoned, the\r\nnumber of new congregations was infinitesimal. The same tale is told by\r\ntheir statistical returns. In 1824 they had 2,596 communicant members;\r\nin 1834, 2,698; in 1850, 2,838; and, in 1857, 2,978; and thus we have\r\nthe startling fact that, in spite of their efforts at church extension,\r\nthey had not gained four hundred members in thirty-three years. For\r\nthis slowness, however, the reasons were purely mechanical; and all the\r\nobstacles sprang from the Brethren's connection with Germany.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have the persistent use of the Lot. For some years the English\r\nBrethren adhered to the custom of enforcing its use in marriages;\r\nand even when it was abolished in marriages they still used it in\r\napplications for membership. No man could be a member of the Moravian\r\nChurch without the consent of the Lot; and this rule was still enforced\r\nat the Provincial Synod held at Fairfield in 1847. Sometimes this rule\r\nworked out in a curious way. A man and his wife applied for admission to\r\nthe Church; the case of each was put separately to the Lot; the one was\r\naccepted, the other was rejected; and both were disgusted and pained.\r\n\r\nAnother barrier to progress was the system of ministerial education. For\r\na few years (1809-27) there existed at Fulneck a high-class Theological\r\nSeminary; but it speedily sickened and died; and henceforward all\r\ncandidates for the ministry who desired a good education were compelled\r\nto go to Germany. Thus the Brethren now had two classes of ministers.\r\nIf the candidate was not able to go to Germany, he received but a poor\r\neducation; and if, on the other hand, he went to Germany, he stayed\r\nthere so long--first as a student, and then as a master--that when he\r\nreturned to England, he was full of German ideas of authority, and often\r\nspoke with a German accent. And thus Englishmen naturally obtained the\r\nimpression that the Church was not only German in origin, but meant\r\nchiefly for Germans.\r\n\r\nAnother cruel barrier was the poverty of the ministers. They were\r\noverworked and underpaid. They had generally five or six services to\r\nhold every Sunday; they had several meetings during the week; they were\r\nexpected to interview every member at least once in two months;\r\nthey were entirely without lay assistants; their wives held official\r\npositions, and were expected to share in the work; and yet, despite his\r\nmanifold duties, there was scarcely a minister in the Province whose\r\nsalary was enough to enable him to make ends meet. At one time the\r\nsalary of the minister in London was only £50 a year; at Fulneck it was\r\nonly 8s. a week; in other places it was about the same. There was\r\nno proper sustentation fund; and the result was that nearly all the\r\nministers had to add to their incomes in other ways. In most cases they\r\nkept little schools for the sons and daughters of gentry in the country\r\ndistricts; but as they were teaching five days a week, they could\r\nnot possibly pay proper attention to their ministerial duties. If the\r\nminister had been a single man, he might easily have risen above his\r\ntroubles; but as he was compelled by church law to marry, his case\r\nwas often a hard one; and at the Provincial Synod held at Fulneck, the\r\nBrethren openly confessed the fact that one of the chief hindrances to\r\nprogress was lack of time on the part of the ministers {1835.}.\r\n\r\nAnother barrier was the absolute power of officials and the limited\r\npower of the laity. No Church can expect to make much progress unless\r\nits institutions are in tune with the institutions of the country. For\r\ngood or for evil, England was growing democratic; and, therefore, the\r\nMoravian Church should have been democratic too. But in those days\r\nthe Moravian Church was the reverse of democratic. In theory each\r\ncongregation had the power to elect its own committee; in fact,\r\nno election was valid unless ratified by the Lot. In theory each\r\ncongregation had the power to send a deputy to the Provincial Synod; in\r\nfact, only a few ever used the privilege. At the first Provincial Synod\r\nof the nineteenth century (1824), only four deputies were present; at\r\nthe second (1835), only seven; at the third (1847), only nine; at the\r\nfourth (1853), only twelve; at the fifth (1856), only sixteen; and thus,\r\nwhen the deputies did appear, they could always be easily outvoted by\r\nthe ministers.\r\n\r\nAnother hindrance was the Brethren's peculiar conception of their duty\r\nto their fellow-men in this country. In spite of their enthusiasm for\r\nForeign Missions, they had little enthusiasm for Home Missions; and\r\nclinging still to the old Pietist notion of a \"Church within the\r\nChurch,\" they had not yet opened their eyes to the fact that godless\r\nEnglishmen were quite as plentiful as godless Red Indians or Hottentots.\r\nFor proof let us turn to the \"Pastoral Letter\" drawn up by commission\r\nof the Synod at Fulneck {1835.}. At that Synod, the Brethren prepared a\r\nrevised edition of the \"Brotherly Agreement\"; and then, to enforce\r\nthe principles of the \"Agreement,\" they commissioned the P.E.C.[153] to\r\naddress the whole Church in a \"Pastoral Letter.\" But neither in the\r\nAgreement nor in the Letter did the Brethren recommend Home Mission\r\nwork. They urged their flocks to hold prayer meetings, to distribute\r\ntracts, to visit the sick, to invite outsiders to the House of God;\r\nthey warned them against the corruption of business life; and they even\r\nbesought them not to meddle in politics or to wear party colours. In\r\nIreland they were not to join Orange Lodges; and in England they were\r\nnot to join trade unions. Thus the Brethren distinctly recommended their\r\npeople not to take too prominent a part in the social and political life\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nAgain, twelve years later, at the next Synod, held at Fairfield {1847.},\r\nthe Brethren issued another \"Pastoral Letter.\" In this letter the\r\nmembers of the P.E.C. complained that some were denying the doctrine\r\nof eternal punishment, that the parents were neglecting the religious\r\neducation of their children, that the Bible was not systematically read,\r\nthat the \"speaking\" before the Holy Communion was neglected, that the\r\nold custom of shaking hands at the close of the Sacrament was dying\r\nout, that the members' contributions were not regularly paid, and that\r\nprivate prayer meetings were not held as of old; and, therefore, the\r\nBrethren pleaded earnestly for the revival of all these good customs.\r\nAnd yet, even at this late stage, there was no definite reference in the\r\n\"Letter\" to Home Mission Work.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of paralysis was the lack of periodical literature.\r\nWe come here to an astounding fact. For one hundred and eight years\r\n(1742-1850), the Moravians struggled on in England without either an\r\nofficial or an unofficial Church magazine; and the only periodical\r\nliterature they possessed was the quarterly missionary report,\r\n\"Periodical Accounts.\" Thus the Church members had no means of airing\r\ntheir opinions. If a member conceived some scheme of reform, and wished\r\nto expound it in public, he had to wait till the next Provincial Synod;\r\nand as only five Synods were held in fifty years, his opportunity did\r\nnot come very often. Further, the Brethren were bound by a rule that\r\nno member should publish a book or pamphlet dealing with Church affairs\r\nwithout the consent of the U.E.C. or of a Synod.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, this muzzling order was repealed; and the first\r\nBriton to speak his mind in print was an Irishman, John Carey. For some\r\ntime this man, after first reviving a dying cause at Cootehill, in Co.\r\nCavan, had been making vain endeavours to arouse the Irish Moravians\r\nto a sense of their duty {1850.}; but all he had received in return was\r\nofficial rebukes. He had tried to start a new cause in Belfast; he had\r\ngathered together a hundred and fifty hearers; he had rented a hall for\r\nworship in King Street; and then the Irish Elders' Conference, in solemn\r\nassembly at Gracehill, strangled the movement at its birth. Instead\r\nof encouraging and helping Carey, they informed him that his work was\r\nirregular, forbade him to form a Society, and even issued a notice\r\nin the Guardian disowning his meetings. But Carey was not to be\r\ndisheartened; and now, at his own risk, he issued his monthly magazine,\r\nThe Fraternal Messenger. The magazine was a racy production. As John\r\nCarey held no official position, he was able to aim his bullets wherever\r\nhe pleased; and, glowing with patriotic zeal, he first gave a concise\r\nepitome of the \"History of the Brethren,\" and then dealt with burning\r\nproblems of the day. If the magazine did nothing else, it at least\r\ncaused men to think. Among the contributors was Bishop Alexander\r\nHassé. He had visited certain places in Ireland--Arva, Billies, and\r\nDrumargan--where once the Brethren had been strong; he gave an account\r\nof these visits; and thus those who read the magazine could not fail to\r\nsee what glorious opportunities had been thrown away in the past.\r\n\r\nAt the next Synod, held in Fulneck, all present could see that a\r\nnew influence was at work {1853.}. For the first time the Brethren\r\ndeliberately resolved that, in their efforts for the Kingdom of God,\r\nthey should \"aim at the enlargement of the Brethren's Church.\" They\r\nsanctioned the employment of lay preachers; they established the\r\nMoravian Magazine, edited by John England; and they even encouraged a\r\nmodest attempt to rekindle the dying embers at such places as Arva and\r\nDrumargan.\r\n\r\nAt the next Synod, held again at Fulneck, the Brethren showed a still\r\nclearer conception of their duties {1856.}. The Synodal sermon was\r\npreached by William Edwards. He was a member of the Directing Board, and\r\nmust have spoken with a sense of responsibility; and in that sermon\r\nhe deliberately declared that, instead of following the German plan of\r\nconcentrating their energy on settlements, the Brethren ought to pay\r\nmore attention to town and country congregations. \"It is here,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that we lie most open to the charge of omitting opportunities of\r\nusefulness.\" And the members of the Synod were equally emphatic.\r\nThey made arrangements for a Training Institution; they rejected the\r\nprinciple, which had ruled so long, of a \"Church within the Church\";\r\nand, thirdly,--most important point of all--they resolved that a society\r\nbe formed, called the Moravian Home Mission, and that the object of\r\nthat society should be, not only to evangelize in dark and neglected\r\ndistricts, but also to establish, wherever possible, Moravian\r\ncongregations. The chief leader in this new movement was Charles E.\r\nSutcliffe. He had pleaded the cause of Home Missions for years; and now\r\nhe was made the general secretary of the new Home Mission society.\r\n\r\nIn one way, however, the conduct of the Brethren was surprising. As we\r\nhave now arrived at that point in our story when the Moravian Church,\r\nno longer under the rule of the U.E.C., was to be divided into three\r\nindependent provinces, it is natural to ask what part the British\r\nMoravians played in this Home Rule movement; what part they played,\r\ni.e., in the agitation that each Province should have its own property,\r\nhold its own Provincial Synods, and manage its own local affairs. They\r\nplayed a very modest part, indeed! At this Synod they passed three\r\nresolutions: first, that the British P.E.C. should be empowered to\r\nsummon a Provincial Synod with the consent of the U.E.C.; second, that\r\nthe Synod should be empowered to elect its own P.E.C.; and third, that\r\n\"any measure affecting our own province, carried by a satisfactory\r\nmajority, shall at once pass into law for the province, with the\r\nsanction of the Unity's Elders' Conference, without waiting for a\r\nGeneral Synod.\" But in other respects the British Moravians were in\r\nfavour of the old constitution. They were not the true leaders of the\r\nHome Rule movement. They made no demand for a separation of property;\r\nthey were still willing to bow to the authority of the German Directing\r\nBoard; they still declared their belief in the use of the Lot in\r\nappointments to office; and the agitation in favour of Home Rule came,\r\nnot from Great Britain, but from North America. To North America,\r\ntherefore, we must now turn our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. -- THE STRUGGLE IN AMERICA, 1762-1857.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century the Moravians in America had felt as uncomfortable\r\nas David in Saul's armour; and the armour in this particular instance\r\nwas made of certain iron rules forged at the General Synods held in\r\nGermany. As soon as Spangenberg had left his American friends, the work\r\nwas placed, for the time being, under the able management of Bishop\r\nSeidal, Bishop Hehl, and Frederick William von Marschall; and then, in\r\ndue course, the American Brethren were informed that a General Synod had\r\nbeen held at Marienborn (1764), that certain Church principles had there\r\nbeen laid down, and that henceforward their duty, as loyal Moravians,\r\nwas to obey the laws enacted at the General Synods, and also to submit,\r\nwithout asking questions, to the ruling of the German Directing Board.\r\nThe Americans meekly obeyed. The system of Government adopted was\r\npeculiar. At all costs, said the Brethren in Germany, the unity of the\r\nMoravian Church must be maintained; and, therefore, in order to maintain\r\nthat unity the Directing Board, from time to time, sent high officials\r\nacross the Atlantic on visitations to America. In 1765 they sent old\r\nDavid Nitschmann; in 1770 they sent Christian Gregor, John Lorentz,\r\nand Alexander von Schweinitz; in 1779 they sent Bishop John Frederick\r\nReichel; in 1783 they sent Bishop John de Watteville; in 1806 they\r\nsent John Verbeck and John Charles Forester; and thus they respectfully\r\nreminded the American Brethren that although they lived some thousands\r\nof miles away, they were still under the fatherly eye of the German\r\nDirecting Board. For this policy the German Brethren had a noble reason.\r\nAs the resolutions passed at the General Synods were nearly always\r\nconfirmed by the Lot, they could not help feeling that those resolutions\r\nhad some Divine authority; and, therefore, what God called good in\r\nGermany must be equally good in America. For this reason they enforced\r\nthe settlement system in America just as strictly as in Germany. Instead\r\nof aiming at church extension they centralized the work round the four\r\nsettlements of Bethlehem, Nazareth, Salem and Lititz. There, in the\r\nsettlements, they enforced the Brotherly Agreement; there they insisted\r\non the use of the Lot; there they fostered diaconies, choirs, Brethren's\r\nHouses and Sisters' Houses, and all the features of settlement life; and\r\nthere alone they endeavoured to cultivate the Moravian Quietist type\r\nof gentle piety. Thus the Brethren in America were soon in a queer\r\nposition. As there was no State Church in America, and as, therefore, no\r\none could accuse them of being schismatics, they had just as much right\r\nto push their cause as any other denomination; and yet they were just as\r\nmuch restricted as if they had been dangerous heretics. Around them lay\r\nan open country, with a fair field and no favour; within their bosoms\r\nglowed a fine missionary zeal; and behind them, far away at Herrnhut,\r\nsat the Directing Board, with their hands upon the curbing rein.\r\n\r\nIf this system of government favoured unity, it also prevented growth.\r\nIt was opposed to American principles, and out of place on American\r\nsoil. What those American principles were we all know. At that famous\r\nperiod in American history, when the War of Independence broke out, and\r\nthe Declaration of Independence was framed, nearly all the people were\r\nresolute champions of democratic government. They had revolted against\r\nthe rule of King George III.; they stood for the principle, \"no taxation\r\nwithout representation\"; they erected democratic institutions in every\r\nState and County; they believed in the rights of free speech and free\r\nassembly; and, therefore, being democratic in politics, they naturally\r\nwished to be democratic in religion. But the Moravians were on the horns\r\nof a dilemma. As they were not supposed to meddle with politics, they\r\ndid not at first take definite sides in the war. They objected to\r\nbearing arms; they objected to taking oaths; and, therefore, of course,\r\nthey objected also to swearing allegiance to the Test Act (1777).\r\nBut this attitude could not last for ever. As the war continued, the\r\nAmerican Moravians became genuine patriotic American citizens. For\r\nsome months the General Hospital of the American Army was stationed at\r\nBethlehem; at another time it was stationed at Lititz; and some of\r\nthe young Brethren joined the American Army, and fought under General\r\nWashington's banner for the cause of Independence. For this natural\r\nconduct they were, of course, rebuked; and in some cases they were even\r\nexpelled from the Church.\r\n\r\nAt this point, when national excitement was at its height, Bishop\r\nReichel arrived upon the scene from Germany, and soon instructed the\r\nAmerican Brethren how to manage their affairs {1779.}. He acted in\r\nopposition to American ideals. Instead of summoning a Conference of\r\nministers and deputies, he summoned a Conference consisting of ministers\r\nonly; the American laymen had no chance of expressing their opinions;\r\nand, therefore, acting under Reichel's influence, the Conference passed\r\nthe astounding resolution that \"in no sense shall the societies of\r\nawakened, affiliated as the fruit of the former extensive itinerations,\r\nbe regarded as preparatory to the organisation of congregations,\r\nand that membership in these societies does not at all carry with it\r\ncommunicant membership or preparation for it.\" There lay the cause\r\nof the Brethren's failure in America. In spite of its rather stilted\r\nlanguage, we can easily see in that sentence the form of an old familiar\r\nfriend. It is really our German friend the Diaspora, and our English\r\nfriend the system of United Flocks. For the next sixty-four years that\r\none sentence in italics was as great a barrier to progress in America\r\nas the system of United Flocks in England. As long as that resolution\r\nremained in force, the American Moravians had no fair chance of\r\nextending; and all the congregations except the four settlements were\r\ntreated, not as hopeful centres of work, but as mere societies and\r\npreaching-places. Thus again, precisely as in Great Britain, did the\r\nBrethren clip their own wings; thus again did they sternly refuse\r\nadmission to hundreds of applicants for Church membership. A few figures\r\nwill make this clear. At Graceham the Brethren had 90 adherents,\r\nbut only 60 members {1790.}; at Lancaster 258 adherents, but only\r\n72 members; at Philadelphia 138 adherents, but only 38 members; at\r\nOldmanscreek 131 adherents, but only 37 members; at Staten Island 100\r\nadherents, but only 20 members; at Gnadenhütten 41 adherents, but only\r\n31 members; at Emmaus 93 adherents, but only 51 members; at Schoeneck\r\n78 adherents, but only 66 members; at Hebron 72 adherents, but only 24\r\nmembers; at York 117 adherents, but only 38 members; and at Bethel 87\r\nadherents, but only 23 members. If these figures are dry, they are at\r\nleast instructive; and the grand point they prove is that the American\r\nMoravians, still dazzled by Zinzendorf's \"Church within the Church\"\r\nidea, compelled hundreds who longed to join their ranks as members to\r\nremain outside the Church. In Germany this policy succeeded; in England,\r\nwhere a State Church existed, it may have been excusable; but in\r\nAmerica, where a State Church was unknown, it was senseless and\r\nsuicidal.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the American Moravians did not live entirely in vain. Amid the\r\nfury of American politics, they cultivated the three Moravian fruits of\r\npiety, education and missionary zeal. At Bethlehem they opened a Girls'\r\nSchool; and so popular did that school become that one of the directors,\r\nJacob Van Vleck, had to issue a circular, stating that during the next\r\neighteen months no more applications from parents could be received.\r\nIt was one of the finest institutions in North America; and among the\r\nthousands of scholars we find relatives of such famous American leaders\r\nas Washington, Addison, Sumpter, Bayard, Livingstone and Roosevelt. At\r\nNazareth the Brethren had a school for boys, known as \"Nazareth Hall.\"\r\nIf this school never served any other purpose, it certainly taught some\r\nrising Americans the value of order and discipline. At meals the boys\r\nhad to sit in perfect silence; and when they wished to indicate their\r\nwants, they did so, not by using their tongues, but by holding up the\r\nhand or so many fingers. The school was divided into \"rooms\"; each\r\n\"room\" contained only fifteen or eighteen pupils; these pupils were\r\nunder the constant supervision of a master; and this master, who was\r\ngenerally a theological scholar, was the companion and spiritual adviser\r\nof his charges. He joined in all their games, heard them sing their\r\nhymns, and was with them when they swam in the \"Deep Hole\" in the\r\nBushkill River on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons, when they gathered\r\nnuts in the forests, and when they sledged in winter in the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor foreign missions these American Brethren were equally enthusiastic.\r\nThey established a missionary society known as the \"Society for\r\nPropagating the Gospel Among the Brethren\" (1787); they had that society\r\nenrolled as a corporate body; they were granted by Congress a tract\r\nof 4,000 acres in the Tuscawaras Valley; and they conducted a splendid\r\nmission to the Indians in Georgia, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Canada, Kansas and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nBut work of this kind was not enough to satisfy the American Brethren.\r\nAs the population increased around them they could not help feeling\r\nthat they ought to do more in their native land; and the yoke of German\r\nauthority galled them more and more. In their case there was some\r\nexcuse for rebellious feelings. If there is anything a genuine American\r\ndetests, it is being compelled to obey laws which he himself has not\r\nhelped to make; and that was the very position of the American Brethren.\r\nIn theory they were able to attend the General Synods; in fact, very\r\nfew could undertake so long a journey. At one Synod (1782) not a single\r\nAmerican Brother was present; and yet the decisions of the Synod were of\r\nfull force in America.\r\n\r\nAt length the Americans took the first step in the direction of Home\r\nRule. For forty-eight years their Provincial Synods had been attended\r\nby ministers only; but now by special permission of the U.E.C., they\r\nsummoned a Provincial Synod at Lititz consisting of ministers and\r\ndeputies {1817.}. At this Synod they framed a number of petitions to be\r\nlaid before the next General Synod in Germany. They requested that the\r\nmonthly \"speaking\" should be abolished; that Brethren should be allowed\r\nto serve in the army; that the American Provincial Helpers' Conference\r\nshould be allowed to make appointments without consulting the German\r\nU.E.C.; that the congregations should be allowed to elect their own\r\ncommittees without using the Lot; that all adult communicant members\r\nshould be entitled to a vote; that the use of the Lot should be\r\nabolished in marriages, in applications for membership, and in the\r\nelection of deputies to the General Synod; and, finally, that at least\r\none member of the U.E.C. should know something about American affairs.\r\nThus did the Americans clear the way for Church reform. In Germany they\r\nwere regarded as dangerous radicals. They were accused of an unwholesome\r\ndesire for change. They designed, it was said, to pull down everything\r\nold and set up something new. At the General Synod (1818) most of their\r\nrequests were refused; and the only point they gained was that the Lot\r\nneed not be used in marriages in town and country congregations. At the\r\nvery time when the Americans were growing more radical, the Germans, as\r\nwe have seen already, were growing more conservative.[154]\r\nBut the American Brethren were not disheartened. In addition to being\r\nleaders in the cause of reform, they now became the leaders in the Home\r\nMission movement; and here they were twenty years before their British\r\nBrethren. In 1835, in North Carolina, they founded a \"Home Missionary\r\nSociety\"; in 1844 they abolished the settlement system; in 1849 they\r\nfounded a general \"Home Missionary Society\"; in 1850 they founded a\r\nmonthly magazine, the Moravian Church Miscellany; in 1855 they founded\r\ntheir weekly paper the Moravian, and placed all their Home Mission work\r\nunder a general Home Mission Board. Meanwhile, they had established\r\nnew congregations at Colored Church, in North Carolina (1822); Hope, in\r\nIndiana (1830); Hopedale, in Pennsylvania (1837); Canal Dover, in Ohio\r\n(1840); West Salem, in Illinois 1844; Enon, in Indiana (1846); West\r\nSalem for Germans, in Edwards County (1848); Green Bay, in Wisconsin\r\n(1850); Mount Bethell, in Caroll County (1851); New York (1851);\r\nEbenezer, in Wisconsin (1853); Brooklyn (1854); Utica, in Oneida County\r\n(1854); Watertown, in Wisconsin (1854); and Lake Mills, in Wisconsin\r\n(1856). At the very time when the British Moravians were forming their\r\nfirst Home Mission Society, the Americans had founded fourteen new\r\ncongregations; and thus they had become the pioneers in every Moravian\r\nonward movement.\r\n\r\nBut their greatest contribution to progress is still to be mentioned. Of\r\nall the Provincial Synods held in America, the most important was that\r\nwhich met at Bethlehem on May 2nd, 1855. As their Home Mission work had\r\nextended so rapidly they now felt more keenly than ever how absurd it\r\nwas the American work should still be managed by a Directing Board in\r\nGermany; and, therefore, they now laid down the proposal that American\r\naffairs should be managed by an American Board, elected by an American\r\nProvincial Synod {1855.}. In other words, the Americans demanded\r\nindependence in all American affairs. They wished, in future, to manage\r\ntheir own concerns; they wished to make their own regulations at their\r\nown Provincial Synods; they established an independent \"Sustentation\r\nFund,\" and desired to have their own property; and therefore they\r\nrequested the U.E.C. to summon a General Synod at the first convenient\r\nopportunity to consider their resolutions. Thus, step by step, the\r\nAmerican Moravians prepared the way for great changes. If these changes\r\nare to be regarded as reforms, the American Moravians must have the\r\nchief praise and glory. They were the pioneers in the Home Mission\r\nmovement; they were the staunchest advocates of democratic government;\r\nthey had long been the stoutest opponents of the Lot; and now they led\r\nthe way in the movement which ended in the separation of the Provinces.\r\nIn England their demand for Home Rule awakened a partial response; in\r\nGermany it excited anger and alarm; and now Moravians all over the world\r\nwere waiting with some anxiety to see what verdict would be passed by\r\nthe next General Synod.[155]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. -- THE SEPARATION OF THE PROVINCES, 1857-1899.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the American demands became known in Germany, the German\r\nBrethren were much disturbed in their minds; they feared that if\r\nthese demands were granted the unity of the Moravian Church would\r\nbe destroyed; and next year they met in a German Provincial Synod,\r\ncondemned the American proposals as unsound, and pathetically requested\r\nthe American Brethren to reconsider their position {1856.}. And now,\r\nto make the excitement still keener, an anonymous writer, who called\r\nhimself \"Forscher\" (Inquirer), issued a pamphlet hotly attacking some\r\nof the time-honoured institutions of the Church. He called his pamphlet,\r\n\"Die Brüderkirche: Was ist Wahrheit?\" i.e., The Truth about the\r\nBrethren's Church, and in his endeavour to tell the truth he penned some\r\nstinging words. He asserted that far too much stress had been laid on\r\nthe \"Chief Eldership of Christ\"; he denounced the abuse of the Lot;\r\nhe declared that the Brethren's settlements were too exclusive; he\r\ncriticized Zinzendorf's \"Church within the Church\" idea; he condemned\r\nthe old \"Diacony\" system as an unholy alliance of the secular and the\r\nsacred; and thus he described as sources of evil the very customs which\r\nmany Germans regarded as precious treasures. As this man was really John\r\nHenry Buchner, he was, of course, a German in blood; but Buchner was\r\nthen a missionary in Jamaica, and thus his attack, like the American\r\ndemands, came from across the Atlantic. No wonder the German Brethren\r\nwere excited. No wonder they felt that a crisis in the Church had\r\narrived. For all loyal Moravians the question now was whether the\r\nMoravian Church could stand the strain; and, in order to preserve the\r\ntrue spirit of unity, some Brethren at Gnadenfeld prepared and issued\r\nan \"Appeal for United Prayer.\" \"At this very time,\" they declared, \"when\r\nthe Church is favoured with an unusual degree of outward prosperity,\r\nthe enemy of souls is striving to deal a blow at our spiritual union by\r\nsowing among us the seeds of discord and confusion\"; and therefore they\r\nbesought their Brethren--German, English and American alike--to banish\r\nall feelings of irritation, and to join in prayer every Wednesday\r\nevening for the unity and prosperity of the Brethren's Church.\r\n\r\nAt length, June 8th, 1857, the General Synod met at Herrnhut {1857.}.\r\nIn his opening sermon Bishop John Nitschmann struck the right note. He\r\nreminded his Brethren of the rock from which they were hewn; he appealed\r\nto the testimony of history; and he asserted that the testimony of\r\nhistory was that the Moravian Church had been created, not by man, but\r\nby God. \"A word,\" he said, \"never uttered before at a Brethren's Synod\r\nhas lately been heard among us--the word 'separation.' Separation\r\namong Brethren! The very sound sends a pang to the heart of every true\r\nBrother!\" With that appeal ringing in their ears, the Brethren addressed\r\nthemselves to their difficult task; a committee was formed to examine\r\nthe American proposals; the spirit of love triumphed over the spirit of\r\ndiscord; and finally, after much discussion, the new constitution was\r\nframed.\r\n\r\nIf the unity of the Church was to be maintained, there must, of course,\r\nstill be one supreme authority; and, therefore the Brethren now decided\r\nthat henceforward the General Synod should be the supreme legislative,\r\nand the U.E.C. the supreme administrative, body. But the constitution of\r\nthe General Synod was changed. It was partly an official and partly an\r\nelected body. On the one hand, there were still a number of ex-officio\r\nmembers; on the other a large majority of elected deputies. Thus the\r\nGeneral Synod was now composed of: (1) Ex-officio members: i.e., the\r\ntwelve members of the U.E.C.; all Bishops of the Church; one member of\r\nthe English and one of the American P.E.C.; the Secretarius Unitatis\r\nFratrum in Anglia; the administrators of the Church's estates\r\nin Pennsylvania and North Carolina; the Director of the Warden's\r\nDepartment; the Director of the Missions Department; the Unity's\r\nLibrarian. (2) Elected members: i.e., nine deputies from each of the\r\nthree Provinces, elected by the Synods of these Provinces. As these\r\ntwenty-seven deputies could be either ministers or laymen, it is clear\r\nthat the democratic principle was now given some encouragement; but, on\r\nthe other hand, the number of officials was still nearly as great as the\r\nnumber of deputies. The functions of the General Synod were defined as\r\nfollows: (a) To determine the doctrines of the Church, i.e., to decide\r\nall questions which may arise upon this subject. (b) To decide as to all\r\nessential points of Liturgy. (c) To prescribe the fundamental rules of\r\norder and discipline. (d) To determine what is required for membership\r\nin the Church. (e) To nominate and appoint Bishops. (f) To manage the\r\nChurch's Foreign Missions and Educational Work. (g) To inspect the\r\nChurch's general finances. (h) To elect the U.E.C. (i) To form and\r\nconstitute General Synods, to fix the time and place of their meetings,\r\nand establish the basis of their representation. (j) To settle\r\neverything concerning the interests of the Moravian Church as a whole.\r\n\r\nAs the U.E.C. were elected by the General Synod, it was natural that\r\nthey should still possess a large share of administrative power; and\r\ntherefore they were now authorized to manage all concerns of a general\r\nnature, to represent the Church in her dealings with the State, and with\r\nother religious bodies, and to see that the principles and regulations\r\nestablished by the General Synod were carried out in every department\r\nof Church work. For the sake of efficiency the U.E.C. were divided into\r\nthree boards, the Educational, Financial, and Missionary; they managed,\r\nin this way, the schools in Germany, the general finances, and the whole\r\nof the foreign missions; and meanwhile, for legal reasons, they also\r\nacted as P.E.C. for the German Province of the Church. Thus the first\r\npart of the problem was solved, and the unity of the Moravian Church was\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe next task was to satisfy the American demand for Home Rule. For\r\nthis purpose the Brethren now resolved that each Province of the Church\r\nshould have its own property; that each Province should hold its own\r\nProvincial Synod; and that each of the three Provincial Synods should\r\nhave power to make laws, provided these laws did not conflict with the\r\nlaws laid down by a General Synod. As the U.E.C. superintended the work\r\nin Germany, there was no further need for a new arrangement there; but\r\nin Great Britain and North America the Provincial Synod in each case was\r\nempowered to elect its own P.E.C., and the P.E.C., when duly elected,\r\nmanaged the affairs of the Province. They had the control of all\r\nprovincial property. They appointed ministers to their several posts;\r\nthey summoned Provincial Synods when they thought needful; and thus each\r\nProvince possessed Home Rule in all local affairs.\r\n\r\nFor the next twenty-two years this constitution--so skilfully\r\ndrawn--remained unimpaired. At best, however, it was only a compromise;\r\nand in 1879 an alteration was made {1879.}. As Mission work was the only\r\nwork in which the whole Church took part as such, it was decided that\r\nonly the Mission Department of the U.E.C. should be elected by the\r\nGeneral Synod; the two other departments, the Educational and Financial,\r\nwere to be nominated by the German Provincial Synod; and in order that\r\nthe British and American Provinces should have a court of appeal, a new\r\nboard, called the Unity Department, was created. It consisted of six\r\nmembers, i.e., the four members of the Missions Department, one from the\r\nEducational Department, and one from the Finance Department. At the same\r\ntime the U.E.C., divided still into its three departments, remained the\r\nsupreme Board of Management.\r\n\r\nBut this arrangement was obviously doomed to failure {1890.}. In the\r\nfirst place it was so complex that few could understand it, and only\r\na person of subtle intellect could define the difference between the\r\nfunctions of the U.E.C. and the functions of the Unity Department; and,\r\nin the second place, it was quite unfair to the German Brethren. In\r\nGermany the U.E.C. still acted as German P.E.C.; of its twelve members\r\nfour were elected, not by a German Provincial Synod, but by the General\r\nSynod; and, therefore, the Germans were ruled by a board of whom only\r\neight members were elected by the Germans themselves. At the next\r\nGeneral Synod, therefore (1889), the U.E.C. was divided into two\r\ndepartments: first, the Foreign Mission Department, consisting of\r\nfour members, elected by the General Synod; second, the German P.E.C.,\r\nconsisting of eight members, elected by the German Provincial Synod.\r\nThus, at last, thirty-two years after the British and American\r\nProvinces, did the German Province attain Provincial independence.\r\n\r\nBut even this arrangement proved unsatisfactory. As we thread our\r\nway through these constitutional changes, we can easily see where the\r\ntrouble lay. At each General Synod the problem was, how to reconcile the\r\nunity of the Church with the rights of its respective Provinces; and so\r\nfar the problem had not been solved. The flaw in the last arrangement is\r\nfairly obvious. If the U.E.C. was still the supreme managing board, it\r\nwas unfair to the Americans and Britons that eight of its twelve members\r\nshould be really the German P.E.C., elected by the German Provincial\r\nSynod.\r\n\r\nThe last change in the constitution was of British origin {1898.}. At a\r\nProvincial Synod held in Mirfield, the British Moravians sketched a plan\r\nwhereby the U.E.C. and the Unity Department would both cease to\r\nexist; and when the next General Synod met at Herrnhut, this plan was\r\npractically carried into effect. At present, therefore, the Moravian\r\nChurch is constituted as follows {1899.}: First, the supreme legislative\r\nbody is still the General Synod; second, the Church is divided into four\r\nProvinces, the German, the British, the American North, and the American\r\nSouth; third, each of these four Provinces holds its own Provincial\r\nSynods, makes its own laws, and elects its own P.E.C.; fourth, the\r\nforeign mission work is managed by a Mission Board, elected by the\r\nGeneral Synod; and last, the supreme U.E.C., no longer a body seated in\r\nGermany and capable of holding frequent meetings, is now composed of\r\nthe Mission Board and the four governing boards of the four independent\r\nProvinces. In one sense, the old U.E.C. is abolished; in another, it\r\nstill exists. It is abolished as a constantly active Directing Board;\r\nit exists as the manager of certain Church property,[156] as the Church's\r\nrepresentative in the eyes of the law, and as the supreme court of\r\nappeal during the period between General Synods. As some of the members\r\nof this composite board live thousands of miles from each other, they\r\nare never able to meet all together. And yet the Board is no mere\r\nfiction. In theory, its seat is still at Berthelsdorf; and, in fact, it\r\nis still the supreme administrative authority, and as such is empowered\r\nto see that the principles laid down at a General Synod are carried out\r\nin every branch of the Moravian Church.[157]\r\nAnd yet, though the Moravian Church is still one united ecclesiastical\r\nbody, each Province is independent in the management of its own\r\naffairs. For example, let us take the case of the British Province. The\r\nlegislative body is the Provincial Synod. It is composed of, first, all\r\nordained ministers of the Church in active congregation service; second,\r\nthe Advocatus Fratrum in Angliâ and the Secretarius Fratrum in Angliâ;\r\nthird, lay deputies elected by the congregations. At a recent British\r\nProvincial Synod (1907) the rule was laid down that every congregation\r\npossessing more than one hundred and fifty members shall be entitled\r\nto send two deputies to the Synod; and thus there is a tendency in the\r\nBritish Province for the lay element to increase in power. In all local\r\nBritish matters the power of the Provincial Synod is supreme. It has\r\npower to settle the time and place of its own meetings, to supervise\r\nthe administration of finances, to establish new congregations, to\r\nsuperintend all official Church publications, to nominate Bishops, and\r\nto elect the Provincial Elders' Conference. As the U.E.C. act in the\r\nname and by the authority of a General Synod, so the P.E.C. act in\r\nthe name and by the authority of a Provincial Synod. They see to\r\nthe execution of the laws of the Church, appoint and superintend all\r\nministers, pay official visits once in three years to inspect the state\r\nof the congregations, examine candidates for the ministry, administer\r\nthe finances of the Province, and act as a Court of Appeal in cases of\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply in individual congregations.\r\n\r\nAs each Province manages its own affairs subject to the general laws of\r\nthe Church, so each congregation manages its own affairs subject to the\r\ngeneral laws of the Province. As far as its own affairs are concerned,\r\neach congregation is self-ruling. All members over eighteen years who\r\nhave paid their dues are entitled to a vote. They are empowered to elect\r\na deputy for the Provincial Synod; they elect also, once in three years,\r\nthe congregation committee; and the committee, in co-operation with the\r\nminister, is expected to maintain good conduct, honesty and propriety\r\namong the members of the congregation, to administer due discipline and\r\nreproof, to consider applications for membership, to keep in order\r\nthe church, Sunday-school, minister's house, and other congregation\r\nproperty, and to be responsible for all temporal and financial concerns.\r\n\r\nThus the constitution of the Moravian Church may be described as\r\ndemocratic. It is ruled by committees, conferences and synods; and these\r\ncommittees, conferences and synods all consist, to a large extent, of\r\nelected deputies. As the Moravians have Bishops, the question may be\r\nasked, what special part the Bishops play in the government of the\r\nChurch? The reply may be given in the words of the Moravians themselves.\r\nAt the last General Synod the old principle was reasserted, that \"the\r\noffice of a Bishop imparts in and by itself no manner of claim to the\r\ncontrol of the whole Church or of any part of it; the administration\r\nof particular dioceses does therefore not belong to the Bishops.\" Thus\r\nMoravian Bishops are far from being prelates. They are authorized to\r\nordain the presbyters and deacons; they examine the spiritual\r\ncondition of the ordinands; and, above all, they are called to act as\r\n\"intercessors in the Church of God.\" But they have no more ruling power\r\nas such than any other minister of the Church.\r\n\r\nFinally, a word must be said about the use of the Lot. As long as the\r\nLot was used at all, it interfered to some extent with the democratic\r\nprinciple; but during the last twenty or thirty years it had gradually\r\nfallen into disuse, and in 1889 all reference to the Lot was struck out\r\nof the Church regulations; and while the Brethren still acknowledge the\r\nliving Christ as the only Lord and Elder of the Church, they seek His\r\nguidance, not in any mechanical way, but through prayer, and reliance on\r\nthe illumination of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FOUR. -- THE MODERN MORAVIANS, 1857-1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Brethren made their maiden speech in the Valley of Kunwald four\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, they little thought that they were founding\r\na Church that would spread into every quarter of the civilized globe. If\r\nthis narrative, however, has been written to any purpose, it has surely\r\ntaught a lesson of great moral value; and that lesson is that the\r\nsmallest bodies sometimes accomplish the greatest results. At no period\r\nhave the Brethren been very strong in numbers; and yet, at every stage\r\nof their story, we find them in the forefront of the battle. Of all the\r\nProtestant Churches in England, the Moravian Church is the oldest; and\r\nwherever the Brethren have raised their standard, they have acted as\r\npioneers. They were Reformers sixty years before Martin Luther. They\r\nwere the first to adopt the principle that the Bible is the only\r\nstandard of faith and practice. They were among the first to issue a\r\ntranslation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek into the\r\nlanguage of the people. They led the way, in the Protestant movement, in\r\nthe catechetical instruction of children. They published the first Hymn\r\nBook known to history. They produced in Comenius the great pioneer of\r\nmodern education. They saved the Pietist movement in Germany from an\r\nearly grave; they prepared the way for the English Evangelical Revival;\r\nand, above all, by example rather than by precept, they aroused in the\r\nProtestant Churches of Christendom that zeal for the cause of foreign\r\nmissions which some writers have described as the crowning glory of the\r\nnineteenth century. And now we have only one further land to explore. As\r\nthe Moravians are still among the least of the tribes of Israel, it\r\nis natural to ask why, despite their smallness, they maintain their\r\nseparate existence, what part they are playing in the world, what share\r\nthey are taking in the fight against the Canaanite, for what principles\r\nthey stand, what methods they employ, what attitude they adopt towards\r\nother Churches, and what solution they offer of the social and religious\r\nproblems that confront us at the opening of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nSection I.--MORAVIAN PRINCIPLES--If the Moravians have any\r\ndistinguishing principle at all, that principle is one which goes\r\nback to the beginnings of their history. For some years they have been\r\naccustomed to use as a motto the famous words of Rupertus Meldenius:\r\n\"In necessariis unitas; in non-necessariis libertas; in utrisque\r\ncaritas\"--in essentials unity; in non-essentials liberty; in both,\r\ncharity. But the distinction between essentials and non-essentials goes\r\nfar behind Rupertus Meldenius. If he was the first to pen the saying, he\r\nwas certainly not the first to lay down the principle. For four hundred\r\nand fifty years this distinction between essentials and non-essentials\r\nhas been a fundamental principle of the Brethren. From whom, if from any\r\none, they learned it we do not know. It is found in no mediæval writer,\r\nand was taught neither by Wycliffe nor by Hus. But the Brethren held it\r\nat the outset, and hold it still. It is found in the works of Peter\r\nof Chelcic;[158] it was fully expounded by Gregory the Patriarch; it was\r\ntaught by the Bohemian Brethren in their catechisms; it is implied in\r\nall Moravian teaching to-day. To Moravians this word \"essentials\" has a\r\ndefinite meaning. At every stage in their history we find that in their\r\njudgment the essentials on which all Christians should agree to unite\r\nare certain spiritual truths. It was so with the Bohemian Brethren; it\r\nis so with the modern Moravians. In the early writings of Gregory\r\nthe Patriarch, and in the catechisms of the Bohemian Brethren, the\r\n\"essentials\" are such things, and such things only, as faith, hope,\r\nlove and the doctrines taught in the Apostles' Creed; and the\r\n\"non-essentials,\" on the other hand, are such visible and concrete\r\nthings as the church on earth, the ministry, the sacraments, and the\r\nother means of grace. In essentials they could allow no compromise; in\r\nnon-essentials they gladly agreed to differ. For essentials they often\r\nshed their blood; but non-essentials they described as merely \"useful\"\r\nor \"accidental.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern Moravians hold very similar views. For them the only\r\n\"essentials\" in religion are the fundamental truths of the Gospel as\r\nrevealed in Holy Scripture. In these days the question is sometimes\r\nasked, What is the Moravian creed? The answer is, that they have no\r\ncreed, apart from Holy Scripture. For the creeds of other churches\r\nthey have the deepest respect. Thy have declared their adherence to the\r\nApostles' Creed. They confess that in the Augsburg Confession the chief\r\ndoctrines of Scripture are plainly and simply set forth; they have never\r\nattacked the Westminster Confession or the Articles of the Church of\r\nEngland; and yet they have never had a creed of their own, and have\r\nalways declined to bind the consciences of their ministers and members\r\nby any creed whatever. Instead of binding men by a creed, they are\r\ncontent with the broader language of Holy Scripture. At the General\r\nSynod of 1857 they laid down the principle that the \"Holy Scriptures of\r\nthe Old and New Testament are, and shall remain, the only rule of our\r\nfaith and practice\"; and that principle has been repeatedly reaffirmed.\r\nThey revere the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God; they acknowledge\r\nno other canon or rule of doctrine; they regard every human system\r\nof doctrine as imperfect; and, therefore, they stand to-day for the\r\nposition that Christians should agree to unite on a broad Scriptural\r\nbasis. Thus the Moravians claim to be an Union Church. At the Synod of\r\n1744 they declared that they had room within their borders for three\r\nleading tropuses, the Moravian, the Lutheran and the Reformed; and\r\nnow, within their own ranks, they allow great difference of opinion on\r\ndoctrinal questions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, of course, they agree on certain points. If the reader\r\nconsults their own official statements--e.g., those laid down in the\r\n\"Moravian Church Book\"--he will notice two features of importance.\r\nFirst, he will observe that (speaking broadly) the Moravians are\r\nEvangelicals; second, he will notice that they state their doctrines in\r\nvery general terms. In that volume it is stated that the Brethren hold\r\nthe doctrines of the Fall and the total depravity of human nature, of\r\nthe love of God the Father, of the real Godhead and the real Humanity\r\nof Jesus Christ, of justification by faith, of the Holy Ghost and the\r\noperations of His grace, of good works as the fruit of faith, of the\r\nfellowship of all believers with Christ and with each other, and,\r\nfinally, of the second coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead\r\nto condemnation or to life. But none of these doctrines are defined in\r\ndogmatic language, and none of them are imposed as creeds. As long as a\r\nman holds true to the broad principles of the Christian faith, he may,\r\nwhether he is a minister or a layman, think much as he pleases on many\r\nother vexed questions. He may be either a Calvinist or an Arminian,\r\neither a Higher Critic or a defender of plenary inspiration, and either\r\nHigh Church or Methodistic in his tastes. He may have his own theory of\r\nthe Atonement, his own conception of the meaning of the Sacraments,\r\nhis own views on Apostolical Succession, and his own belief about\r\nthe infallibility of the Gospel records. In their judgment, the main\r\nessential in a minister is not his orthodox adherence to a creed, but\r\nhis personal relationship to Jesus Christ. For this reason they are not\r\nafraid to allow their candidates for the ministry to sit at the feet of\r\nprofessors belonging to other denominations. At their German Theological\r\nCollege in Gnadenfeld, the professors systematically instruct the\r\nstudents in the most advanced results of critical research; sometimes\r\nthe students are sent to German Universities; and the German quarterly\r\nmagazine--Religion und Geisteskultur--a periodical similar to our\r\nEnglish \"Hibbert Journal,\" is edited by a Moravian theological\r\nprofessor. At one time an alarming rumour arose that the Gnadenfeld\r\nprofessors were leading the students astray; the case was tried at a\r\nGerman Provincial Synod, and the professors proved their innocence by\r\nshowing that, although they held advanced views on critical questions,\r\nthey still taught the Moravian central doctrine of redemption through\r\nJesus Christ. In England a similar spirit of liberty prevails. For some\r\nyears the British Moravians have had their own Theological College; it\r\nis situated at Fairfield, near Manchester; and although the students\r\nattend lectures delivered by a Moravian teacher, they receive the\r\ngreater part of their education, first at Manchester University, and\r\nthen either at the Manchester University Divinity School, or at the Free\r\nChurch College in Glasgow or Edinburgh, or at any other suitable home\r\nof learning. Thus do the Moravians of the twentieth century tread in the\r\nfootsteps of the later Bohemian Brethren; and thus do they uphold the\r\nprinciple that when the heart is right with Christ, the reasoning powers\r\nmay be allowed free play.\r\n\r\nIn all other \"non-essentials\" they are equally broad. As they have never\r\nquarrelled with the Church of England, they rather resent being called\r\nDissenters; as they happen to possess Episcopal Orders, they regard\r\nthemselves as a true Episcopal Church; and yet, at the same time, they\r\nlive on good terms with all Evangelical Dissenters, exchange pulpits\r\nwith Nonconformist ministers, and admit to their Communion service\r\nmembers of all Evangelical denominations. They celebrate the Holy\r\nCommunion once a month; they sing hymns describing the bread and wine as\r\nthe Body and Blood of Christ; and yet they have no definite doctrine of\r\nthe presence of Christ in the Eucharist. They practise Infant Baptism;\r\nbut they do not hold any rigid view about Baptismal Regeneration. They\r\npractise Confirmation;[159] and yet they do not insist on confirmation\r\nas an absolute condition, in all cases, of church membership. If the\r\ncandidate, for example, is advanced in years, and shrinks from the\r\nordeal of confirmation, he may be admitted to the Moravian Church by\r\nreception; and members coming from other churches are admitted in the\r\nsame way. They practise episcopal ordination, but do not condemn all\r\nother ordinations as invalid; and a minister of another Protestant\r\nChurch may be accepted as a Moravian minister without being episcopally\r\nordained. At the Sacraments, at weddings and at ordinations, the\r\nMoravian minister generally wears a surplice; and yet there is no\r\nreference to vestments in the regulations of the Church. In some\r\ncongregations they use the wafer at the Sacrament, in others ordinary\r\nbread; and this fact alone is enough to show that they have no ruling\r\non the subject. Again, the Moravians observe what is called the Church\r\nyear. They observe, that is, the seasons of Advent, Lent, Easter,\r\nWhitsuntide, and Trinity; and yet they do not condemn as heretics those\r\nwho differ from them on this point. If there is any season specially\r\nsacred to Moravians, it is Holy Week. To them it is generally known\r\nas Passion Week. On Palm Sunday they sing a \"Hosannah\" composed by\r\nChristian Gregor; at other services during the week they read the\r\nPassion History together, from a Harmony of the Four Gospels; on\r\nthe Wednesday evening there is generally a \"Confirmation\"; on Maundy\r\nThursday they celebrate the Holy Communion; on Good Friday, where\r\npossible, they have a series of special services; and on Easter Sunday\r\nthey celebrate the Resurrection by an early morning service, held in\r\nEngland about six o'clock, but on the Continent at sunrise. Thus the\r\nBrethren are like High Churchmen in some of their observances, and very\r\nunlike them in their ecclesiastical principles. As the customs they\r\npractise are hallowed by tradition, and have often been found helpful to\r\nthe spiritual life, they do not lightly toss them overboard; but, on\r\nthe other hand, they do not regard those customs as \"essential.\" In\r\nspiritual \"essentials\" they are one united body; in \"non-essentials,\"\r\nsuch as ceremony and orders, they gladly agree to differ; and, small\r\nthough they are in numbers, they believe that here they stand for a\r\nnoble principle, and that some day that principle will be adopted by\r\nevery branch of the militant Church of Christ. According to Romanists\r\nthe true bond of union among Christians is obedience to the Pope as Head\r\nof the Church; according to some Anglicans, the \"Historic Episcopate\";\r\naccording to Moravians, a common loyalty to Scripture and a common faith\r\nin Christ; and only the future can show which, if any, of these bases of\r\nunion will be accepted by the whole visible Church of Christ. Meanwhile,\r\nthe Brethren are spreading their principles in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nSection II.--THE MORAVIANS IN GERMANY.--In Germany, and on the Continent\r\ngenerally, they still adhere in the main to the ideal set up by\r\nZinzendorf. We may divide their work into five departments.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the ordinary pastoral work in the settlements and\r\ncongregations. In Germany the settlement system still flourishes. Of the\r\ntwenty-six Moravian congregations on the Continent, no fewer than\r\ntwelve are settlements. In most cases these settlements are quiet\r\nlittle Moravian towns, inhabited almost exclusively by Moravians; the\r\nBrethren's Houses and Sisters' Houses are still in full working order;\r\nthe very hotel is under direct church control; and the settlements,\r\ntherefore, are models of order, sobriety, industry and piety. There the\r\nvisitor will still find neither poverty nor wealth; there, far from\r\nthe madding crowd, the angel of peace reigns supreme. We all know how\r\nCarlyle once visited Herrnhut, and how deeply impressed he was. At all\r\nthe settlements and congregations the chief object of the Brethren is\r\nthe cultivation of personal piety and Christian fellowship. We can see\r\nthis from the number of services held. At the settlements there are more\r\nservices in a week than many a pious Briton would attend in a month.\r\nIn addition to the public worship on Sunday, there is a meeting of some\r\nkind every week-night. One evening there will be a Bible exposition;\r\nthe next, reports of church work; the next, a prayer meeting; the next\r\na liturgy meeting; the next, another Bible exposition; the next, an\r\nextract from the autobiography of some famous Moravian; the next, a\r\nsinging meeting. At these meetings the chief thing that strikes an\r\nEnglish visitor is the fact that no one but the minister takes any\r\nprominent part. The minister gives the Bible exposition; the minister\r\nreads the report or the autobiography; the minister offers the prayer;\r\nand the only way in which the people take part is by singing\r\nthe liturgies and hymns. Thus the German Moravians have nothing\r\ncorresponding to the \"prayer meetings\" held in England in Nonconformist\r\nchurches. In some congregations there are \"prayer unions,\" in which\r\nlaymen take part; but these are of a private and unofficial character.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a good many of the old stern rules are still strictly\r\nenforced, and the Brethren are still cautious in welcoming new recruits.\r\nIf a person not born in a Moravian family desires to join the Moravian\r\nChurch, he has generally to exercise a considerable amount of patience.\r\nHe must first have lived some time in the congregation; he must have a\r\ngood knowledge of Moravian doctrines and customs; he must then submit to\r\nan examination on the part of the congregation-committee; he must\r\nthen, if he passes, wait about six months; his name is announced to the\r\ncongregation, and all the members know that he is on probation; and,\r\ntherefore, when he is finally admitted, he is a Moravian in the fullest\r\nsense of the term. He becomes not only a member of the congregation, but\r\na member of his particular \"choir.\" The choir system is still in force;\r\nfor each choir there are special services and special labourers; and\r\nthough the Single Brethren and Single Sisters are now allowed to live in\r\ntheir own homes, the choir houses are still occupied, and still serve a\r\nuseful purpose.\r\n\r\nSecond, there is the \"Inner Mission.\" In this way each congregation\r\ncares for the poor and neglected living near at hand. There are Bible\r\nand tract distributors, free day schools, Sunday schools, work schools,\r\ntechnical schools, rescue homes, reformatories, orphanages and young\r\nmen's and young women's Christian associations. In spite of the\r\nexclusiveness of settlement life, it is utterly untrue to say that\r\nthe members of the settlements live for themselves alone. They form\r\nevangelistic societies; they take a special interest in navvies, road\r\nmenders, pedlars, railwaymen and others cut off from regular church\r\nconnection; they open lodging-houses and temperance restaurants; and\r\nthus they endeavour to rescue the fallen, to fight the drink evil, and\r\nto care for the bodies and souls of beggars and tramps, of unemployed\r\nworkmen, and of starving and ragged children.\r\n\r\nThird, there is the work of Christian education. In every Moravian\r\ncongregation there are two kinds of day schools. For those children who\r\nare not yet old enough to attend the elementary schools, the Brethren\r\nprovide an \"Infant School\"; and here, having a free hand, they are able\r\nto instil the first principles of Christianity; and, secondly, for the\r\nolder children, they have what we should call Voluntary Schools, manned\r\nby Moravian teachers, but under Government inspection and control.\r\nAt these schools the Brethren give Bible teaching three hours a week;\r\nspecial services for the scholars are held; and as the schools are\r\nopen to the public, the scholars are instructed to be loyal to whatever\r\nChurch they happen to belong. In England such broadness would be\r\nregarded as a miracle; to the German Moravians it is second nature. In\r\ntheir boarding-schools they pursue the same broad principle. At present\r\nthey have nine girls' schools and five boys' boarding-schools; the\r\nheadmaster is always a Moravian minister; the teachers in the boys'\r\nschools are generally candidates for the ministry; and, although in\r\nconsequence of Government requirements the Brethren have now to\r\ndevote most of their energy to purely secular subjects, they are still\r\npermitted and still endeavour to keep the religious influence to the\r\nfore. For more advanced students they have a Pædagogium at Niesky;\r\nand the classical education there corresponds to that imparted at our\r\nUniversities. At Gnadenfeld they have a Theological Seminary, open to\r\nstudents from other churches.\r\n\r\nFourth, there is the Brethren's medical work, conducted by a\r\nDiakonissen-Verband, or Nurses' Union. It was begun in 1866 by Dr.\r\nHermann Plitt. At Gnadenfeld the Brethren have a small hospital, known\r\nas the Heinrichstift; at Emmaus, near Niesky, are the headquarters of\r\nthe Union; the work is managed by a special committee, and is supported\r\nby Church funds; and on the average about fifty nurses are employed in\r\nministering to the poor in twenty-five different places. Some act as\r\nmanagers of small sick-houses; others are engaged in teaching poor\r\nchildren; and others have gone to tend the lepers in Jerusalem and\r\nSurinam.\r\n\r\nFifth, there is the Brethren's Diaspora work, which now extends all over\r\nGermany. There is nothing to be compared to this work in England. It is\r\nnot only peculiar to the Moravians, but peculiar to the Moravians on the\r\nContinent; and the whole principle on which it is based is one which\r\nthe average clear-headed Briton finds it hard to understand. If the\r\nMoravians in England held services in parish churches--supposing such\r\nan arrangement possible--formed their hearers into little societies,\r\nvisited them in their homes, and then urged them to become good members\r\nof the Anglican Church, their conduct would probably arouse considerable\r\namazement. And yet that is exactly the kind of work done by the\r\nMoravians in Germany to-day. In this work the Brethren in Germany make\r\nno attempt to extend their own borders. The Moravians supply the men;\r\nthe Moravians supply the money; and the National Lutheran Church\r\nreaps the benefit. Sometimes the Brethren preach in Lutheran Churches;\r\nsometimes, by permission of the Lutheran authorities, they even\r\nadminister the Communion; and wherever they go they urge their hearers\r\nto be true to the National Church. In England Zinzendorf's \"Church\r\nwithin the Church\" idea has never found much favour; in Germany it is\r\nvalued both by Moravians and by Lutherans. At present the Brethren have\r\nDiaspora centres in Austrian Silesia, in Wartebruch, in Neumark, in\r\nMoravia, in Pomerania, in the Bavarian Palatinate, in Würtemburg, along\r\nthe Rhine from Karlsruhe to Düsseldorf, in Switzerland, in Norway and\r\nSweden, in Russian Poland, and in the Baltic Provinces. We are not, of\r\ncourse, to imagine for a moment that all ecclesiastical authorities on\r\nthe Continent regard this Diaspora work with favour. In spite of its\r\nunselfish purpose, the Brethren have occasionally been suspected of\r\nsectarian motives. At one time the Russian General Consistory forbade\r\nthe Brethren's Diaspora work in Livonia {1859.}; at another time the\r\nRussian Government forbade the Brethren's work in Volhynia; and the\r\nresult of this intolerance was that some of the Brethren fled to South\r\nAmerica, and founded the colony of Brüderthal in Brazil (1885), while\r\nothers made their way to Canada, appealed for aid to the American\r\nP.E.C., and thus founded in Alberta the congregations of Brüderfeld and\r\nBrüderheim. Thus, even in recent years, persecution has favoured the\r\nextension of the Moravian Church; but, generally speaking, the Brethren\r\npursue their Diaspora work in peace and quietness. They have now about\r\nsixty or seventy stations; they employ about 120 Diaspora workers, and\r\nminister thus to about 70,000 souls; and yet, during the last fifty\r\nyears, they have founded only six new congregations--Goldberg (1858),\r\nHansdorf (1873), Breslau (1892), and Locle and Montmirail in Switzerland\r\n(1873). Thus do the German Moravians uphold the Pietist ideals of\r\nZinzendorf.\r\n\r\nSection III.--THE MORAVIANS IN GREAT BRITAIN.--For the last fifty years\r\nthe most striking feature about the British Moravians is the fact that\r\nthey have steadily become more British in all their ways, and more\r\npractical and enthusiastic in their work in this country. We can see it\r\nin every department of their work.\r\n\r\nThey began with the training of their ministers. As soon as the British\r\nMoravians became independent, they opened their own Theological Training\r\nInstitution; and then step by step they allowed their students to\r\ncome more and more under English influences. At first the home of the\r\nTraining College was Fulneck; and, as long as the students lived in that\r\nplacid abode, they saw but little of the outside world. But in 1874\r\nthe College was removed to Fairfield; then the junior students began to\r\nattend lectures at the Owens College; then (1886) they began to study\r\nfor a degree in the Victoria University; then (1890) the theological\r\nstudents were allowed to study at Edinburgh or Glasgow; and the final\r\nresult of this broadening process is that the average modern Moravian\r\nminister is as typical an Englishman as any one would care to meet. He\r\nhas English blood in his veins; he bears an English name; he has been\r\ntrained at an English University; he has learned his theology from\r\nEnglish or Scotch Professors; he has English practical ideas of\r\nChristianity; and even when he has spent a few years in Germany--as\r\nstill happens in exceptional cases--he has no more foreign flavour about\r\nhim than the Lord Mayor of London.\r\n\r\nAgain, the influence of English ideas has affected their public worship.\r\nAt the Provincial Synods of 1878 and 1883, the Brethren appointed\r\nCommittees to revise their Hymn-book; and the result was that when the\r\nnext edition of the Hymn-book appeared (1886), it was found to contain\r\na large number of hymns by popular English writers. And this, of course,\r\ninvolved another change. As these popular English hymns were wedded to\r\npopular English tunes, those tunes had perforce to be admitted into the\r\nnext edition of the Tune-book (1887); and thus the Moravians, like other\r\nEnglishmen, began now to sing hymns by Toplady, Charles Wesley, George\r\nRawson and Henry Francis Lyte to such well-known melodies as Sir Arthur\r\nSullivan's \"Coena Domini,\" Sebastian Wesley's \"Aurelia,\" and Hopkins's\r\n\"Ellers.\" But the change in this respect was only partial. In music the\r\nMoravians have always maintained a high standard. With them the popular\r\ntype of tune was the chorale; and here they refused to give way to\r\npopular clamour. At this period the objection was raised by some that\r\nthe old chorales were too difficult for Englishmen to sing; but to this\r\nobjection Peter La Trobe had given a crushing answer.[160] At St. Thomas,\r\nhe said, Zinzendorf had heard the negroes sing Luther's fine \"Gelobet\r\nseiest\"; at Gnadenthal, in South Africa, Ignatius La Trobe had heard\r\nthe Hottentots sing Grummer's \"Jesu, der du meine Seele\"; in Antigua the\r\nnegroes could sing Hassler's \"O Head so full of bruises\"; and therefore,\r\nhe said, he naturally concluded that chorales which were not above\r\nthe level of Negroes and Hottentots could easily be sung, if they only\r\ntried, by Englishmen, Scotchmen and Irishmen of the nineteenth century.\r\nAnd yet, despite this official attitude, certain standard chorales fell\r\ninto disuse, and were replaced by flimsier English airs.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the influence of English ideas is found in the decline\r\nof peculiar Moravian customs. At present the British congregations\r\nmay be roughly divided into two classes. In some, such as Fulneck,\r\nFairfield, Ockbrook, Bristol, and other older congregations, the old\r\ncustoms are retained; in others they are quite unknown. In some we still\r\nfind such things as Love-feasts, the division into choirs, the regular\r\nchoir festivals, the observance of Moravian Memorial Days; in others,\r\nespecially in those only recently established, these things are absent;\r\nand the consequence is that in the new congregations the visitor of\r\nto-day will find but little of a specific Moravian stamp. At the morning\r\nservice he will hear the Moravian Litany; in the Hymn-book he will find\r\nsome hymns not found in other collections; but in other respects he\r\nwould see nothing specially distinctive.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Brethren have adopted new institutions. As the old\r\nmethods of church-work fell into disuse, new methods gradually took\r\ntheir place; and here the Brethren followed the example of their\r\nAnglican and Nonconformist friends. Instead of the special meetings for\r\nSingle Brethren and Single Sisters, we now find the Christian Endeavour,\r\nand Men's and Women's Guilds; instead of the Boys' Economy, the Boys'\r\nBrigade; instead of the Brethren's House, the Men's Institute; instead\r\nof the Diacony, the weekly offering, the sale of work, and the bazaar;\r\nand instead of the old Memorial Days, the Harvest Festival and the\r\nChurch and Sunday-school Anniversary.\r\n\r\nBut the most important change of all is the altered conception of the\r\nChurch's mission. At the Provincial Synod held in Bedford the Brethren\r\ndevoted much of their time to the Home Mission problem {1863.}; and\r\nJohn England, who had been commissioned to write a paper on \"Our Aim and\r\nCalling,\" defined the Church's mission in the words: \"Such, then, I\r\ntake to be our peculiar calling. As a Church to preach Christ and Him\r\ncrucified, every minister and every member. As a Church to evangelize,\r\nevery minister and every member.\" From that moment those words were\r\naccepted as a kind of motto; and soon a great change was seen in the\r\ncharacter of the Home Mission Work. In the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury nearly all the new causes begun were in quiet country villages;\r\nin the second half, with two exceptions, they were all in growing\r\ntowns and populous districts. In 1859 new work was commenced at\r\nBaltonsborough, in Somerset, and Crook, in Durham; in 1862 at Priors\r\nMarston, Northamptonshire; in 1867 at Horton, Bradford; in 1869 at\r\nWestwood, in Oldham; in 1871 at University Road, Belfast; in 1874 at\r\nHeckmondwike, Yorkshire; in 1888 at Wellfield, near Shipley; in 1890\r\nat Perth Street, Belfast; in 1896 at Queen's Park, Bedford; in 1899 at\r\nOpenshaw, near Manchester, and at Swindon, the home of the Great Western\r\nRailway Works; in 1907 at Twerton, a growing suburb of Bath; and in\r\n1908 in Hornsey, London. Of the places in this list, all except\r\nBaltonsborough and Priors Marston are in thickly populated districts;\r\nand thus during the last fifty years the Moravians have been brought\r\nmore into touch with the British working man.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there has been a growing freedom of speech. The new movement\r\nbegan in the College at Fairfield. For the first time in the history of\r\nthe British Province a number of radical Moravians combined to express\r\ntheir opinions in print; and, led and inspired by Maurice O'Connor,\r\nthey now (1890) issued a breezy pamphlet, entitled Defects of Modern\r\nMoravianism. In this pamphlet they were both critical and constructive.\r\nAmong other reforms, they suggested: (a) That the Theological Students\r\nshould be allowed to study at some other Theological College; (b) that\r\na Moravian Educational Profession be created; (c) that all British\r\nMoravian Boarding Schools be systematically inspected; (d) that the\r\nmonthly magazine, The Messenger, be improved, enlarged, and changed into\r\na weekly paper; (e) that in the future the energies of the Church be\r\nconcentrated on work in large towns and cities; (f) and that all defects\r\nin the work of the Church be openly stated and discussed.\r\n\r\nThe success of the pamphlet was both immediate and lasting. Of all the\r\nProvincial Synods held in England the most important in many ways was\r\nthat which met at Ockbrook a few months after the publication of this\r\npamphlet. It marks the beginning of a new and brighter era in the\r\nhistory of the Moravian Church in England. For thirty years the Brethren\r\nhad been content to hold Provincial Synods every four or five years\r\n{1890.}; but now, in accordance with a fine suggestion brought forward\r\nat Bedford two years before, and ardently supported by John Taylor, the\r\nAdvocatus Fratrum in Angliâ, they began the practice of holding Annual\r\nSynods. In the second place, the Brethren altered the character of their\r\nofficial church magazine. For twenty-seven years it had been a monthly\r\nof very modest dimensions. It was known as The Messenger; it was founded\r\nat the Bedford Synod (1863); and for some years it was well edited by\r\nBishop Sutcliffe. But now this magazine became a fortnightly, known\r\nas The Moravian Messenger. As soon as the magazine changed its form it\r\nincreased both in influence and in circulation. It was less official,\r\nand more democratic, in tone; it became the recognised vehicle for the\r\nexpression of public opinion; and its columns have often been filled\r\nwith articles of the most outspoken nature. And thirdly, the Brethren\r\nnow resolved that henceforth their Theological Students should be\r\nallowed to study at some other Theological College.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the pamphlet did not end here. At the Horton\r\nSynod (1904) arrangements were made for the establishment of a teaching\r\nprofession, and at Baildon (1906) for the inspection of the Boarding\r\nSchools; and thus nearly all the suggestions of the pamphlet have now\r\nbeen carried out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the various changes mentioned have all contributed, more or\r\nless, to alter the tone of the Moravian pulpit. As long as the work was\r\nmostly in country villages the preaching was naturally of the Pietistic\r\ntype. But the Moravian preachers of the present day are more in touch\r\nwith the problems of city life. They belong to a democratic Church; they\r\nare brought into constant contact with the working classes; they are\r\ninterested in modern social problems; they believe that at bottom all\r\nsocial problems are religious; and, therefore, they not only foster such\r\ninstitutions as touch the daily life of the masses, but also in their\r\nsermons speak out more freely on the great questions of the day. In\r\nother words, the Moravian Church in Great Britain is now as British as\r\nBritain herself.\r\n\r\nSection IV.--THE MORAVIANS IN AMERICA.--In America the progress was of\r\na similar kind. As soon as the American Brethren had gained Home Rule,\r\nthey organized their forces in a masterly manner; arranged that their\r\nProvincial Synod should meet once in three years; set apart £5,000 for\r\ntheir Theological College at Bethlehem; and, casting aside the Diaspora\r\nideas of Zinzendorf, devoted their powers to the systematic extension\r\nof their Home Mission work. It is well to note the exact nature of their\r\npolicy. With them Home Mission work meant systematic Church extension.\r\nAt each new Home Mission station they generally placed a fully ordained\r\nminister; that minister was granted the same privileges as the minister\r\nof any other congregation; the new cause was encouraged to strive for\r\nself support; and, as soon as possible, it was allowed to send a deputy\r\nto the Synod. At Synod after Synod Church extension was the main topic\r\nof discussion; and the discussion nearly always ended in some practical\r\nproposal. For example, at the Synod of 1876 the Brethren formed a Church\r\nExtension Board; and that Board was entrusted with the task of raising\r\n£10,000 in the next three years. Again, in 1885, they resolved to build\r\na new Theological College, elected a Building Committee to collect the\r\nmoney, and raised the sum required so rapidly that in 1892 they were\r\nable to open Comenius Hall at Bethlehem, free of debt. Meanwhile the\r\nnumber of new congregations was increasing with some rapidity. At the\r\nend of fifty years of Home Rule the Moravians in North America had one\r\nhundred and two congregations; and of these no fewer than sixty-four\r\nwere established since the separation of the Provinces. The moral is\r\nobvious. As soon as the Americans obtained Home Rule they more than\r\ndoubled their speed; and in fifty years they founded more congregations\r\nthan they had founded during the previous century. In 1857 they began\r\nnew work at Fry's Valley, in Ohio; in 1859 at Egg Harbour City; in 1862\r\nat South Bethlehem; in 1863 at Palmyra; in 1865 at Riverside; in 1866\r\nat Elizabeth, Freedom, Gracehill, and Bethany; in 1867 at Hebron and\r\nKernersville; in 1869 at Northfield, Philadelphia and Harmony; in 1870\r\nat Mamre and Unionville; in 1871 at Philadelphia; in 1872 at\r\nSturgeon Bay; in 1873 at Zoar and Gerah; in 1874 at Berea; in 1877 at\r\nPhiladelphia and East Salem; in 1880 at Providence; in 1881 at Canaan\r\nand Goshen; in 1882 at Port Washington, Oakland, and Elim; in 1886 at\r\nHector and Windsor; in 1887 at Macedonia, Centre Ville, and Oakgrove;\r\nin 1888 at Grand Rapids and London; in 1889 at Stapleton and Calvary; in\r\n1890 at Spring Grove and Clemmons; in 1891 at Bethel, Eden and Bethesda;\r\nin 1893 at Fulp and Wachovia Harbour; in 1894 at Moravia and Alpha; in\r\n1895 at Bruederfeld and Bruederheim; in 1896 at Heimthal, Mayodon and\r\nChrist Church; in 1898 at Willow Hill; in 1901 at New York; in 1902 at\r\nYork; in 1904 at New Sarepta; and in 1905 at Strathcona. For Moravians\r\nthis was an exhilarating speed; and the list, though forbidding in\r\nappearance, is highly instructive. In Germany Church extension is\r\nalmost unknown; in England it is still in its infancy; in America it is\r\npractically an annual event; and thus there are now more Moravians in\r\nAmerica than in England and Germany combined. In Germany the number of\r\nMoravians is about 8,000; in Great Britain about 6,000; in North America\r\nabout 20,000.\r\n\r\nFrom this fact a curious conclusion has been drawn. As the American\r\nMoravians have spread so rapidly, the suspicion has arisen in certain\r\nquarters that they are not so loyal as the Germans and British to the\r\nbest ideals of the Moravian Church; and one German Moravian writer\r\nhas asserted, in a standard work, that the American congregations are\r\nlacking in cohesion, in brotherly character, and in sympathy with true\r\nMoravian principles.[161] But to this criticism several answers may be\r\ngiven. In the first place, it is well to note what we mean by Moravian\r\nideals. If Moravian ideals are Zinzendorf's ideals, the criticism is\r\ntrue. In Germany, the Brethren still pursue Zinzendorf's policy; in\r\nEngland and America that policy has been rejected. In Germany the\r\nMoravians still act as a \"Church within the Church\"; in England and\r\nAmerica such work has been found impossible. But Zinzendorf's \"Church\r\nwithin the Church\" idea is no Moravian \"essential.\" It was never one of\r\nthe ideals of the Bohemian Brethren; it sprang, not from the Moravian\r\nChurch, but from German Pietism; and, therefore, if the American\r\nBrethren reject it they cannot justly be accused of disloyalty to\r\noriginal Moravian principles.\r\n\r\nFor those principles they are as zealous as any other Moravians. They\r\nhave a deep reverence for the past. At their Theological Seminary in\r\nBethlehem systematic instruction in Moravian history is given; and the\r\nAmerican Brethren have their own Historical Society. For twenty years\r\nBishop Edmund de Schweinitz lectured to the students on Moravian\r\nhistory; and, finally, in his \"History of the Unitas Fratrum,\" he\r\ngave to the public the fullest account of the Bohemian Brethren in the\r\nEnglish language; and in recent years Dr. Hamilton, his succesor, has\r\nnarrated in detail the history of the Renewed Church of the Brethren.\r\nSecond, the Americans, when put to the test, showed practical sympathy\r\nwith German Brethren in distress. As soon as the German refugees\r\narrived from Volhynia, the American Moravians took up their cause with\r\nenthusiasm, provided them with ministers, helped them with money, and\r\nthus founded the new Moravian congregations in Alberta. And third,\r\nthe Americans have their share of Missionary zeal. They have their own\r\n\"Society for Propagating the Gospel\"; they have their own Missionary\r\nmagazines; and during the last quarter of a century they have borne\r\nnearly the whole burden, both in money and in men, of the new mission\r\nin Alaska. And thus the three branches of the Moravian Church, though\r\ndiffering from each other in methods, are all united in their loyalty to\r\nthe great essentials.\r\n\r\nSection V.--BONDS OF UNION.--But these essentials are not the only bonds\r\nof union. At present Moravians all over the world are united in three\r\ngreat tasks.\r\n\r\nFirst, they are united in their noble work among the lepers at\r\nJerusalem. It is one of the scandals of modern Christianity that leprosy\r\nis still the curse of Palestine; and the only Christians who are trying\r\nto remove that curse are the Moravians. At the request of a kind-hearted\r\nGerman lady, Baroness von Keffenbrink-Ascheraden, the first Moravian\r\nMissionary went out to Palestine forty years ago (1867). There, outside\r\nthe walls of Jerusalem, the first hospital for lepers, named Jesus\r\nHilfe, was built; there, for some years, Mr. and Mrs. Tappe laboured\r\nalmost alone; and then, when the old hospital became too small, the new\r\nhospital, which is standing still, was built, at a cost of £4,000,\r\non the Jaffa Road. In this work, the Moravians have a twofold object.\r\nFirst, they desire to exterminate leprosy in Palestine; second, as\r\nopportunity offers, they speak of Christ to the patients. But the\r\nhospital, of course, is managed on the broadest lines. It is open to\r\nmen of all creeds; there is no religious test of any kind; and if the\r\npatient objects to the Gospel it is not forced upon him. At present the\r\nhospital has accommodation for about fifty patients; the annual\r\nexpense is about £4,000; the Managing Committee has its headquarters in\r\nBerthelsdorf; each Province of the Moravian Church has a Secretary and\r\nTreasurer; the staff consists of a Moravian Missionary, his wife, and\r\nfive assistant nurses; and all true Moravians are expected to support\r\nthis holy cause. At this hospital, of course, the Missionary and his\r\nassistants come into the closest personal contact with the lepers.\r\nThey dress their sores; they wash their clothes; they run every risk\r\nof infection; and yet not one of the attendants has ever contracted the\r\ndisease. When Father Damien took the leprosy all England thrilled at the\r\nnews; and yet if England rose to her duty the black plague of leprosy\r\nmight soon be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Moravian Church is united in her work in Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nAt the General Synod of 1869 a strange coincidence occurred; and that\r\nstrange coincidence was that both from Great Britain and from North\r\nAmerica memorials were handed in suggesting that an attempt be made to\r\nrevive the Moravian Church in her ancient home. In England the leader of\r\nthe movement was Bishop Seifferth. In North America the enthusiasm was\r\nuniversal, and the petition was signed by every one of the ministers.\r\nAnd thus, once more, the Americans were the leaders in a forward\r\nmovement. The Brethren agreed to the proposal. At Pottenstein (1870),\r\nnot far from Reichenau, the first new congregation in Bohemia was\r\nfounded. For ten years the Brethren in Bohemia were treated by the\r\nAustrian Government as heretics; but in 1880, by an Imperial edict, they\r\nwere officially recognized as the \"Brethren's Church in Austria.\" Thus\r\nis the prayer of Comenius being answered at last; thus has the Hidden\r\nSeed begun to grow; thus are the Brethren preaching once more within the\r\nwalls of Prague; and now, in the land where in days of old their fathers\r\nwere slain by the sword, they have a dozen growing congregations, a\r\nmonthly Moravian magazine (\"Bratrske Litsz\"), and a thousand adherents\r\nof the Church of the Brethren. Again, as in the case of the Leper\r\nHome, the Managing Committee meets at Herrnhut; each Province has its\r\ncorresponding members; and all Moravians are expected to share in the\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the Moravian Church is united in the work of Foreign\r\nMissions. For their missions to the heathen the Moravians have long been\r\nfamous; and, in proportion to their resources, they are ten times as\r\nactive as any other Protestant Church. But in this book the story of\r\nMoravian foreign missions has not been told. It is a story of romance\r\nand thrilling adventure, of dauntless heroism and marvellous patience;\r\nit is a theme worthy of a Froude or a Macaulay; and some day a master of\r\nEnglish prose may arise to do it justice. If that master historian ever\r\nappears, he will have an inspiring task. He will tell of some of the\r\nfinest heroes that the Christian Church has ever produced. He will\r\ntell of Matthew Stach, the Greenland pioneer, of Friedrich Martin,\r\nthe \"Apostle to the Negroes,\" of David Zeisberger, the \"Apostle to\r\nthe Indians,\" of Erasmus Schmidt, in Surinam, of Jaeschke, the famous\r\nTibetan linguist, of Leitner and the lepers on Robben Island, of Henry\r\nSchmidt in South Africa, of James Ward in North Queensland, of Meyer and\r\nRichard in German East Africa, and of many another grand herald of the\r\nCross whose name is emblazoned in letters of gold upon the Moravian\r\nroll of honour. In no part of their work have the Brethren made grander\r\nprogress. In 1760 they had eight fields of labour, 1,000 communicants,\r\nand 7,000 heathen under their care; in 1834, thirteen fields of labour,\r\n15,000 communicants, and 46,000 under their care; in 1901, twenty fields\r\nof labour, 32,000 communicants, and 96,000 under their care. As the\r\nhistorian traces the history of the Moravian Church, he often finds\r\nmuch to criticize and sometimes much to blame; but here, on the foreign\r\nmission field, the voice of the critic is dumb. Here the Moravians have\r\never been at their best; here they have done their finest redemptive\r\nwork; here they have shown the noblest self-sacrifice; and here, as the\r\nsternest critic must admit, they have always raised from degradation to\r\nglory the social, moral, and spiritual condition of the people. In\r\nthese days the remark is sometimes made by superior critics that foreign\r\nmissionaries in the olden days had a narrow view of the Gospel, that\r\ntheir only object was to save the heathen from hell, and that they\r\nnever made any attempt to establish the Kingdom of God on earth. If that\r\nstatement refers to other missionaries, it may or may not be true;\r\nbut if it refers to Moravians it is false. At all their stations the\r\nMoravian Missionaries looked after the social welfare of the people.\r\nThey built schools, founded settlements, encouraged industry, fought\r\nthe drink traffic, healed the sick, and cast out the devils of robbery,\r\nadultery and murder; and the same principles and methods are still in\r\nforce to-day.\r\n\r\nAt the last General Synod held in Herrnhut the foreign mission work was\r\nplaced under the management of a General Mission Board; the Board was\r\nelected by the Synod; and thus every voting member of the Church has\r\nhis share in the control of the work. In each Province there are\r\nseveral societies for raising funds. In the German Province are the\r\nNorth-Scheswig Mission Association, the Zeist Mission Society, and the\r\nFünf-pfennig Verein or Halfpenny Union. In the British Province are\r\nthe Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel, which owns that famous\r\nmissionary ship, the \"Harmony\"; the Juvenile Missionary Association,\r\nchiefly supported by pupils of the boarding schools; the Mite\r\nAssociation; and that powerful non-Moravian Society, the London\r\nAssociation in aid of Moravian Missions. In North America is the Society\r\nfor Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen. In each Province, too,\r\nwe find periodical missionary literature: in Germany two monthlies, the\r\nMissions-Blatt and Aus Nord und Süd; in Holland the Berichten uit de\r\nHeidenwereld; in Denmark the Evangelisk Missionstidende; in England the\r\nquarterly Periodical Accounts and the monthly Moravian Missions; and\r\nin North America two monthlies, Der Missions Freund and the Little\r\nMissionary. In Germany the missionary training College is situated at\r\nNiesky; in England at Bristol. In England there is also a special fund\r\nfor the training of medical missionaries. Of the communicant members\r\nof the Moravian Church one in every sixty goes out as a missionary; and\r\nfrom this fact the conclusion has often been drawn that if the members\r\nof other churches went out in the same proportion the heathen world\r\nmight be won for Christ in ten years. At present the Mission field\r\ncontains about 100,000 members; the number of missionaries employed is\r\nabout 300; the annual expenses of the work are about £90,000; and of\r\nthat sum two-thirds is raised by the native converts.\r\n\r\nThere are now fourteen Provinces in the Mission field, and attractive is\r\nthe scene that lies before us. We sail on the \"Harmony\" to Labrador,\r\nand see the neatly built settlements, the fur-clad Missionary in his\r\ndog-drawn sledge, the hardy Eskimos, the squat little children at the\r\nvillage schools, the fathers and mothers at worship in the pointed\r\nchurch, the patients waiting their turn in the surgery in the hospital\r\nat Okak. We pass on to Alaska, and steam with the Brethren up the\r\nKuskokwim River. We visit the islands of the West Indies, where\r\nFroude, the historian, admired the Moravian Schools, and where his only\r\ncomplaint about these schools was that there were not enough of them.\r\nWe pass on to California, where the Brethren have a modern Mission among\r\nthe Red Indians; to the Moskito Coast, once the scene of a wonderful\r\nrevival; to Paramaribo in Surinam, the city where the proportion of\r\nChristians is probably greater than in any other city in the world; to\r\nSouth Africa, where it is commonly reported that a Hottentot or Kaffir\r\nMoravian convert can always be trusted to be honest; to German East\r\nAfrica, where the Brethren took over the work at Urambo at the request\r\nof the London Missionary Society; to North Queensland, where the natives\r\nwere once so degraded that Anthony Trollope declared that the \"game\r\nwas not worth the candle,\" where Moravians now supply the men and\r\nPresbyterians the money, and where the visitor gazes in amazement at\r\nthe \"Miracle of Mapoon\"; and last to British India, near Tibet, where,\r\nperched among the Himalaya Mountains, the Brethren in the city of Leh\r\nhave the highest Missionary station in the world.\r\n\r\nAs the Moravians, therefore, review the wonderful past, they see the\r\nguiding hand of God at every stage of the story. They believe that their\r\nChurch was born of God in Bohemia, that God restored her to the light\r\nof day when only the stars were shining, that God has opened the door\r\nin the past to many a field of labour, and that God has preserved her to\r\nthe present day for some great purpose of his own. Among her ranks are\r\nmen of many races and many shades of opinion; and yet, from Tibet to\r\nSan Francisco, they are still one united body. As long as Christendom is\r\nstill divided, they stand for the great essentials as the bond of union.\r\nAs long as lepers in Palestine cry \"unclean,\" they have still their\r\nmission in the land where the Master taught. As long as Bohemia sighs\r\nfor their Gospel, and the heathen know not the Son of Man, they feel\r\nthat they must obey the Missionary mandate; and, convinced that in\r\nfollowing these ideals they are not disobedient to the heavenly vision,\r\nthey emblazon still upon their banner the motto encircling their old\r\nepiscopal seal:--\r\n\r\n     \"Vicit Agnus noster: Eum sequamur.\"\r\n   (Our Lamb has conquered: Him let its follow.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE BOHEMIAN BRETHREN.\r\n\r\nA.

Some of his sermons\r\nhave been preserved, and they have the ring of sincerity. Perhaps, like\r\nErasmus in later years, he wished to avoid a schism, and thought that\r\nthe Church could be reformed from within.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: These settled, not at Kunwald, but close by.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For many years there has been a tradition that the Moravian Church was\r\nfounded on March 1st, 1457; but this date is only a pious imagination.\r\nWe are not quite sure of the year, not to speak of the day of the month.\r\nIf the Moravian Church must have a birthday, March 1st, 1457, will do as\r\nwell as any other; but the truth is that on this point precise evidence\r\nhas not yet been discovered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This division into three classes is first found in a letter to\r\nRockycana, written in 1464.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: De Schweinitz (p. 107) says that the Brethren now took the title of\r\n\"Fratres Legis Christi,\" i.e., Brethren of the Law of Christ. This is a\r\nmistake. This title is not found till towards the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and was never in general use; see Müller's \"Böhmische-Brueder\"\r\nin Hauck's Real-Encyclopædie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The best way to understand the Brethren's attitude is to string\r\ntogether their favourite passages of Scripture. I note, in particular,\r\nthe following: Matthew xviii. 19, 20; Jeremiah iii. 15; John xx. 23;\r\nRevelation xviii. 4, 5; Luke vi. 12-16; Acts iv. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: And this raises an interesting question: If the lot had decided\r\nagainst the Brethren, what would they have done? They have given us the\r\nanswer themselves. If the inscribed slips had remained in the vase, the\r\nBrethren would have waited a year and then tried again. The final issue,\r\nin fact, did not depend on the use of the lot at all. They used it, not\r\nto find out God's will, but simply to confirm that faith in their cause\r\nwhich had already been gained in prayer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: It is here stated by De Schweinitz (p. 137), on Gindely's authority,\r\nthat the members of the Synod were now re-baptized. The statement is\r\nnot correct. It is based on a letter written by Rockycana; but it is\r\nunsupported by any other evidence, and must, therefore be rejected. As\r\nthe Brethren have often been confounded with Anabaptists (especially by\r\nRitschl, in his Geschichte des Pietismus), I will here give the plain\r\nfacts of the case. For a number of years the Brethren held that all who\r\njoined their ranks from the Church of Rome should be re-baptized; and\r\nthe reason why they did so was that in their judgment the Romanist\r\nbaptism had been administered by men of bad moral character, and was,\r\ntherefore, invalid. But in 1534 they abandoned this position, recognised\r\nthe Catholic Baptism as valid, and henceforth showed not a trace of\r\nAnabaptist views either in theory or in practice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: 1. The \"Six Commandments\" are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Matthew v. 22: Thou shalt not be angry with thy brother.\r\n  (2) Matthew v. 28: Thou shalt not look upon a woman to lust after\r\n      her.\r\n  (3) Matthew v. 32: Thou shalt not commit adultery, or divorce thy\r\n      wife.\r\n  (4) Matthew v. 34: Thou shalt not take an oath.\r\n  (5) Matthew v. 39, 40: Thou shalt not go to law.\r\n  (6) Matthew v. 44: Thou shalt love thine enemy.\r\n\r\n2. Moravian Episcopal Orders.--For the benefit of those, if such there\r\nbe, who like a abstruse historical problems, and who, therefore, are\r\nhungering for further information about the origin, maintenance and\r\nvalidity of Moravian Episcopal Orders, I here append a brief statement\r\nof the case:--\r\n\r\n(1) Origin.--On this point three opinions have been held: (a) For\r\nmany years it was stoutly maintained by Palacky, the famous Bohemian\r\nhistorian, by Anton Gindely, the Roman Catholic author of the\r\n\"Geschichte der Böhmischen Brüder,\" and also Bishop Edmund de Schweinitz\r\nin his \"History of the Unitas Fratrum,\" that Stephen, the Waldensian,\r\nwas made a Bishop at the Catholic Council of Basle, and that thus\r\nMoravian Episcopal Orders have a Roman Catholic origin. But this view is\r\nnow generally abandoned. It is not supported by adequate evidence,\r\nand is, on the face of it, entirely improbable. If Stephen had been a\r\nRomanist or Utraquist Bishop the Brethren would never have gone near\r\nhim. (b) In recent years it has been contended by J. Müller and J.\r\nKoestlin that Stephen was consecrated by the Taborite Bishop, Nicholas\r\nvon Pilgram. But this view is as improbable as the first. For Nicholas\r\nvon Pilgram and his rough disciples the Brethren had little more respect\r\nthan they had for the Church of Rome. Is it likely that they would take\r\ntheir orders from a source which they regarded as corrupt? (c) The\r\nthird view--the oldest and the latest--is that held by the Brethren\r\nthemselves. They did not believe that Bishop Stephen had any connection,\r\ndirect or indirect, with the Church of Rome. They believed that he\r\nrepresented an episcopate which had come down as an office of the Church\r\nfrom the earliest Christian days. They could not prove, of course, up\r\nto the hilt, that the Waldensian succession was unbroken; but, as far\r\nas they understood such questions, they believed the succession to be at\r\nleast as good as that which came through Rome. And to that extent they\r\nwere probably right. There is no such thing on the field of history as\r\na proved Apostolic succession; but if any line of mediæval Bishops has\r\nhigh claims to historical validity it is, as Dr. Döllinger has shown (in\r\nhis Beiträge zur Sektengeschichte des Mittelalters), the line to which\r\nWaldensian Stephen belonged.\r\n\r\n(2) Maintenance.--We now come to another question: Has the Church of\r\nthe Brethren maintained the succession from the time of Stephen to the\r\npresent day? Here again the historian has a very tight knot to untie. At\r\none point (if not two) in the history of the Brethren's Church, 1500 and\r\n1554, there is certainly the possibility that her Episcopal succession\r\nwas broken. For the long period of eleven years the Brethren had only\r\none Bishop, John Augusta; and Augusta was a prisoner in Purglitz Castle,\r\nand could not, therefore, consecrate a successor. What, then, were\r\nthe Brethren to do? If John Augusta were to die in prison the line of\r\nBishops would end. Meanwhile the Brethren did the best they could. As\r\nthey did not wish the office to cease, they elected Bishops to perform\r\nEpiscopal functions for the time being. Now comes the critical question:\r\nDid John August, some years later, consecrate these elected Bishops or\r\ndid he not? There is no direct evidence either way. But we know enough\r\nto show us the probabilities. It is certain that in 1564 John Augusta\r\ncame out of prison; it is certain that in 1571 two Bishops-elect, Israel\r\nand Blahoslav, consecrated three successors; it is certain that Augusta\r\nwas a stickler for his own authority as a Bishop; it is not certain\r\nthat he raised an objection to the conduct of Israel and Blahoslav; and,\r\ntherefore, it is possible that he had consecrated them himself. If\r\nhe did, the Moravian succession is unbroken; and, at any rate, it is\r\nwithout a flaw from that day to this.\r\n\r\n(3) Validity.--Is the Moravian Episcopacy valid? The answer depends on\r\nthe meaning of the word \"Validity.\" If the only valid Bishops in the\r\nChurch of Christ are those who can prove an unbroken descent from the\r\nApostles, then the Brethren's Bishops are no more valid than the Bishops\r\nof any other Church; and all historians must honestly admit that, in\r\nthis sense of the word \"Valid,\" there is no such thing as a valid Bishop\r\nin existence. But the word \"Validity\" may have a broader meaning. It may\r\nmean the desire to adhere to New Testament sanctions; it may mean the\r\nhonest and loyal endeavour to preserve the \"intention\" of the Christian\r\nministry as instituted by Christ; and if this is what \"Validity\" means\r\nthe Moravian Episcopate is just as valid as that of any other communion.\r\nMeanwhile, at any rate, the reader may rest content with the following\r\nconclusions:--\r\n\r\n  (1) That Gregory the Patriarch and his fellow Brethren were\r\n      satisfied with Bishop Stephen's statement.\r\n  (2) That they acted honestly according to their light, and desired\r\n      to be true successors of the Primitive Church.\r\n  (3) That the Waldensian Episcopate was of ancient order.\r\n  (4) That no break in the Brethren's Episcopal succession has ever\r\n      been absolutely proved.\r\n  (5) That, during the whole course of their history the Brethren\r\n      have always endeavoured to preserve the Episcopal office\r\n      intact.\r\n\r\nFor a further discussion of the whole question see \"The Report of the\r\nCommittee appointed by the Synod of the Moravian Church in Great Britain\r\nfor the purpose of inquiring into the possibility of more friendly\r\nrelations on the part of this Church with the Anglican Church\"; see\r\nalso, in German, Müller's \"Bischoftum,\" where the whole evidence is\r\ncritically handled.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: For the later history of the Brethren's Church this entrance of\r\nGerman-speaking Waldenses was of fundamental importance; of far\r\ngreater importance, in fact, than is recognised either by Gindely or\r\nde Schweinitz. As these men spoke the German language, the Brethren,\r\nnaturally, for their benefit, prepared German editions of their\r\nConfessions, Catechisms, and Hymn-books; and through these German\r\neditions of their works they were able, a few years later, to enter into\r\ncloser contact with the Reformation in Germany. But that is not the end\r\nof the story. It was descendants of this German branch of the Church\r\nthat first made their way to Herrnhut in 1722, and thus laid the\r\nfoundations of the Renewed Church of the Brethren.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: A Brother, e.g., might take the oath to save another Brother's life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: We are, therefore, justified in regarding the year 1495 as a\r\nturning-point in the history of the Brethren. The revolution was\r\nthorough and complete. It is a striking fact that Luke of Prague,\r\nwhose busy pen was hardly ever dry, did not back up a single passage by\r\nappealing to Peter's authority; and, in one passage, he even attacked\r\nhis character and accused him of not forgiving an enemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: And here I beseech the reader to be on his guard. It is utterly\r\nincorrect to state, with de Schweinitz, that at this period the Brethren\r\nheld the famous doctrine of justification by faith, as expounded\r\nby Martin Luther. Of Luther's doctrine, Luke himself was a vigorous\r\nopponent (see p. 69).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Taine, History of English Literature, Book II. cap. V. For a good\r\ndefence of Alexander's character, see Cambridge Modern History, Vol I.\r\np. 241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: This tract, however, was probably a later Waldensian production.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: So called because the Diet opened on St. James's day (July 25th,\r\n1508).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: A corruption of Beghard. The term, however, appears to have been\r\nused very loosely. It was simply a vulgar term of abuse for all who had\r\nquarrelled with the Church of Rome. John Wycliffe was called a Picard.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Jednota Rimska.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Jednota Lutherianska. For the Church Universal they used another\r\nword: Cirkey, meaning thereby all those elected by God.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: I desire to be explicit on this point. It is, of course, true enough\r\nthat when the Brethren in later years began to use the Latin language\r\nthey used the term \"Unitas Fratrum\" as the equivalent of Jednota\r\nBratrska, but in so doing they made an excusable blunder. The\r\ntranslation \"Unitas Fratrum\" is misleading. It is etymologically\r\ncorrect, and historically false. If a Latin term is to be used at all,\r\nit would be better to say, as J. Müller suggests, \"Societas Fratrum,\"\r\nor, better still, in my judgment, \"Ecclesia Fratrum.\" But of all\r\nterms to describe the Brethren the most offensive is \"sect.\" It is\r\ninconsistent for the same writer to speak of the \"sect\" of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren and of the \"Church\" of Rome. If the Roman Communion is to be\r\ndescribed as a \"Church,\" the same term, in common courtesy, should be\r\napplied to the Brethren.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: De Schweinitz. (p. 126) actually sees in this passage the doctrine of\r\njustification by faith. I confess that I do not.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: This letter was probably written by Luke of Prague.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Müller's Katechismen, page 231.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: This was actually reported to the Pope as a fact by his agent, Henry\r\nInstitoris. See Müller's Katechismen, p. 319.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: From the German edition of 1522; printed in full in Müller's \"Die\r\ndeutschen Katechismen der Böhmischen Brüder.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Compare our Queen Elizabeth's view:--\r\n\r\n     Christ was the Word that spake it,\r\n     He took the bread and brake it,\r\n     And what that Word did make it,\r\n     That I believe, and take it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Letter to the Brethren, 1523.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: There is no doubt whatever on this last point. If the student will\r\nconsult any standard work on the history of the early Christian Church,\r\nhe will see how closely the institutions of the Brethren were modelled\r\non the institutions of the first three centuries as pourtrayed, not only\r\nin the New Testament, but also in such documents as the Didache, the\r\nCanons of Hippolytus, and the Apostolic Constitutions. For English\r\nreaders the best guide is T. M.

It shows that the scheme which Augusta afterwards\r\nsketched in prison was a long-cherished design, and not a new trick to\r\nregain his liberty.

For no reason whatever\r\nhe endeavours to make out that the Brethren were the chief authors of\r\nthe conspiracy against Ferdinand. For this statement there is not a\r\nscrap of evidence, and Gindely produces none. It is not often that\r\nGindely romances, but he certainly romances here, and his biting remarks\r\nabout the Brethren are unworthy of so great an historian! (See Vol I.,\r\np. 293.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Gindely's naïve remark here is too delightful to be lost. He says\r\nthat the rich Brethren had not been corrupted by their contact with\r\nLuther's teaching, and that, therefore, they still possessed a little of\r\nthe milk of human kindness for the refreshment of the poor. (See Vol. I.\r\np. 330.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The Unitarians were specially strong in Poland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The letter, that is, in which the Brethren had pleaded not guilty to\r\nthe charge of treason.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The fallacy underlying this argument is well known to logicians, and\r\na simple illustration will make it clear to the reader:--\r\n\r\n   All Hottentots have black hair.\r\n   Mr. Jones has black hair.\r\n   Therefore, Mr. Jones is a Hottentot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: I must add a brief word in honour of Jacob Bilek. As that faithful\r\nsecretary was thirteen years in prison (1548-61), and endured many\r\ntortures rather than deny his faith, it is rather a pity that two\r\nhistorians have branded him as a traitor. It is asserted both by Gindely\r\n(Vol. I., p. 452) and by de Schweinitz (p. 327) that Bilek obtained his\r\nliberty by promising, in a written bond, to renounce the Brethren\r\nand adhere to the Utraquist Church. But how Gindely could make such\r\na statement is more than I can understand. He professes to base his\r\nstatement on Bilek's narrative; and Bilek himself flatly denies the\r\ncharge. He admits that a bond was prepared, but says that it was handed\r\nto the authorities without his knowledge and consent. For my part, I see\r\nno reason to doubt Bilek's statement; and he certainly spent his last\r\ndays among the Brethren as minister of the congregation at Napajedl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: It had been presented in 1564.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Confessio Bohemica; there is a copy in the archives at 32 Fetter\r\nLane, E.C.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: This was doubtless an exaggeration, but it shows that the Brethren\r\nwere more powerful than the reader would gather from most histories of\r\nthe Reformation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: A copy of this may be seen in the College at Fairfield.

There\r\nis one point in this treatise to which special attention may be\r\ndrawn. It contains no allusion to the fact that among the Brethren\r\nthe ministers had to earn their living by manual labour. The reason\r\nis obvious. The practice ceased in 1609, as soon as the Charter was\r\ngranted, and from that time the Brethren's ministers in Bohemia (though\r\nnot in Moravia and Poland) stood on the same footing as the other\r\nevangelical clergy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Printed in full in J.

And this, I imagine, should\r\nsettle the question.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Hymn No. 851 in the present German Hymn-book.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Collegia pietatis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Ecclesiolæ in ecclesia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Ante is to be construed as an adverb.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: In his classic Geschichte des Pietismus (Vol. III. p. 203), Albrecht\r\nRitschl says that Zinzendorf's unwillingness to be a missionary was due\r\nto his pride of rank. The statement has not a shadow of foundation. In\r\nfact, it is contradicted by Zinzendorf himself, who says: \"ihre Idee war\r\neigentlich nicht, dieses und dergleichen selbst zu bewerkstelligen,\r\ndenn sie waren beide von den Ihrigen in die grosse Welt destiniert und\r\nwussten von nichts als gehorsam sein.\" I should like here to warn\r\nthe student against paying much attention to what Ritschl says about\r\nZinzendorf's theology and ecclesiastical policy. His statements are\r\nbased on ignorance and theological prejudice: and his blunders have been\r\namply corrected, first by Bernhard Becker in his Zinzendorf und sein\r\nChristentum im Verhältnis zum kirchlichen und religiösen Leben seiner\r\nZeit, and secondly by Joseph Müller in his Zinzendorf als Erneuerer der\r\nalten Brüderkirche (1900).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: For further details of Zinzendorf's stay at Wittenberg I must refer\r\nto his interesting Diary, which is now in course of publication in the\r\nZeitschrift für Brüdergeschichte. It is written in an alarming mixture\r\nof Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German, and French; but the editors have kindly\r\nadded full explanatory notes, and all the student requires to understand\r\nit is a working knowledge of German.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: This picture is now in the Pinakothek at Münich. It is wonderful how\r\nthis well-known incident has been misrepresented and misapplied. It is\r\nconstantly referred to now in tracts, sermons, and popular religious\r\nmagazines as if it was the means of Zinzendorf's \"conversion\"; and even\r\na scholar like the late Canon Liddon tells us how this German nobleman\r\nwas now \"converted from a life of careless indifference.\" (Vide\r\nPassiontide Sermons. No. VII., pp. 117, 118.) But all that the picture\r\nreally accomplished was to strengthen convictions already held and plans\r\nalready formed. It is absurd to talk about the \"conversion\" of a youth\r\nwho had loved and followed Christ for years.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The phrase inscribed upon her tombstone at Herrnhut.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The Smalkald Articles were drawn up in 1537; and the clause to which\r\nZinzendorf appealed runs as follows: \"In many ways the Gospel offers\r\ncounsel and help to the sinner; first through the preaching of the\r\nWord, second, through Baptism, third, through the Holy Communion, fourth\r\nthrough the power of the keys, and, lastly, through brotherly discussion\r\nand mutual encouragement, according to Matthew xviii., 'Where two or\r\nthree are gathered together.'\" The Count, of course, appealed to the\r\nlast of these methods. For some reason, however, unknown to me, this\r\nparticular clause in the Articles was always printed in Latin, and was,\r\ntherefore, unknown to the general public.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: In his treatise, \"The German Mass,\" published in 1526 (see Köstlin's\r\n\"Life of Luther,\" p. 295; Longmans' Silver Library).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: August, 1738.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: See page 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Not to be confounded with Kunwald in Bohemia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: It is probable that the Neissers were descendants of the Brethren's\r\nChurch, but we cannot be quite certain about it.

I agree with the latter writer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: It is not clear from the evidence who suggested the use of the Lot.\r\nAccording to Zinzendorf's diary it was the Brethren; but I suspect\r\nthat he himself was the first to suggest it. There is no proof that the\r\nBrethren were already fond of the Lot; but there is plenty of proof that\r\nthe Pietists were, and Zinzendorf had probably learned it from them.\r\n(See Ritschl II., 434, etc.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: And here I correct a popular misconception. It has often been stated\r\nin recent years that the first Moravian missionaries actually became\r\nslaves. The statement is incorrect.

In America Bishop Spangenberg was\r\nstill Chief Elder; and Christ was not recognized as Chief Elder there\r\ntill 1748. What caused this strange incongruity? How could the Brethren\r\nrecognize a man as Chief Elder in America and the Lord Christ as Chief\r\nElder in Europe? The explanation is that in each case the question was\r\nsettled by the Lot; and the Brethren themselves asked in bewilderment\r\nwhy our Lord would not at first consent to be Chief Elder in America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: See Benham's Memoirs of James Hutton, p. 245, where the papers\r\nreferring to Bishop Wilson's appointment are printed in full.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: It was a little green book, with detachable leaves; each leaf\r\ncontained some motto or text; and when the Count was in a difficulty, he\r\npulled out one of these leaves at random.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Matthew xi. 25. \"Little Fools\" (Närrchen) was Zinzendorf's rendering\r\nof naypeeoee {spelled in greek: nu, eta, pi, iota (stressed), omicron,\r\niota}.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: For want of a better, I use this word to translate the German\r\n\"Lämmlein\"; but, in common justice, it must be explained that \"Lämmlein\"\r\nin German does not sound so foolish as \"Lambkin\" in English.

He says (Life of John Wesley, p. 55) that Spangenberg subjected\r\nWesley to \"a cross-examination which, considering the position and\r\nattainments of the respective parties, seems to an outsider, in\r\nplain words, rather impertinent.\" I should like to know where this\r\nimpertinence comes in. What were \"the position and attainments of the\r\nrespective parties?\" Was Spangenberg Wesley's intellectual inferior? No.\r\nDid Spangenberg seek the conversation? No. \"I asked his advice,\" says\r\nWesley, \"with regard to my own conduct.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Thus Overton, e.g., writes: \"If John Wesley was not a true Christian\r\nin Georgia, God help millions of those who profess and call themselves\r\nChristians.\" Life of John Wesley, p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: \"And forthwith commenced the process of purging,\" adds Overton.\r\nWitty, but untrue.

My own personal impression is, however, that the Brethren\r\nfeared that if Wesley took Communion with them he might be tempted to\r\nleave the Church of England and join the Moravian Church.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Mr. Lecky's narrative here (History of England, Vol. II., p. 67,\r\nCabinet Edition) is incorrect. He attributes the above two speeches\r\nto Moravian \"teachers.\" No Moravian \"teacher,\" so far as I know, ever\r\ntalked such nonsense. John Bray was not a Moravian at all. I\r\nhave carefully examined the list of members of the first Moravian\r\ncongregation in London; and Bray's name does not occur in the list.\r\nHe was an Anglican and an intimate friend of Charles Wesley, and is\r\nfrequently mentioned in the latter's Journal. It is easy to see how\r\nLecky went wrong. Instead of consulting the evidence for himself, he\r\nfollowed the guidance of Tyerman's Life of John Wesley, Vol. I., p.\r\n302-5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Cur religionem tuam mutasti?

As such\r\nservices were held already at Herrnhut, where the first took place in\r\n1733, it was probably a Moravian who suggested the service at Fetter\r\nLane; and thus Moravians have the honour of introducing Watch-Night\r\nServices in this country.

Only a few children were\r\neducated at Broadoaks, Buttermere, and Fulneck; and the parents of the\r\nchildren at Fulneck were expected to pay for them if they could. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. W. T. Waugh for this information.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: For a fuller discussion of this fascinating subject see Bernhard\r\nBecker's article in the Monatshefte der Comenius Gesellschaft, 1894,\r\np. 45; Prof. H.

He\r\nmakes no mention of the Love-feast, and says it was not the Moravian\r\ncustom to invite friends to eat and drink. The facts are given by Hegner\r\nin his Fortsetzung of Cranz's Brüdergeschichte, part III., p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: The cause in Ayr was started in 1765 by the preaching of John\r\nCaldwell, one of John Cennick's converts. It was not till 1778 that Ayr\r\nwas organized as a congregation; and no attempt was ever made to convert\r\nthe other societies into congregations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: At the special invitation of William Hunt, a farmer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: For complete list of the Brethren's societies in Scotland, see the\r\nlittle pamphlet, The Moravian Church in Ayrshire, reprinted from the\r\nKilmarnock Standard, June 27th, 1903; and for further details about\r\nabandoned Societies, see Moravian Chapels and Preaching Places (J.\r\nEngland, 2, Edith Road, Seacombe, near Liverpool).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: In all this, the object of the Brethren was to be true to the Church\r\nof England, and, to place their motives beyond all doubt, I add a minute\r\nfrom the London Congregation Council. It refers to United Flocks, and\r\nruns as follows: \"April 11th, 1774. Our Society Brethren and Sisters\r\nmust not expect to have their children baptized by us. It would be\r\nagainst all good order to baptize their children. The increase of this\r\nUnited Flock is to be promoted by all proper means, that the members of\r\nit may be a good salt to the Church of England.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: The certificate was as follows: \"This is to certify, that the\r\nBearer, ----, of ----, in the Parish of ----, in the County of ----, is\r\na Member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, known by the name of Unitas\r\nFratrum or United Brethren, and such is entitled to the Privileges\r\ngranted by an Act of Parliament [22 Geo. II. cap. 120: in the year 1749;\r\nand also by an Act of Parliament [43 Geo. III. cap 120: in the year\r\n1803, exempting the members of the said Church from personal Military\r\nServices.

It is,\r\ntherefore, quite misleading to call the Moravians the \"United Brethren.\"\r\nThe term is not only historically false, but also leads to confusion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: This is necessary in order to fulfil the requirements of German Law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: It was also settled in 1899 that the Advocatus Fratrum in Angliâ and\r\nthe Secretarius Fratrum in Angliâ should no longer be ex-officio members\r\nof the General Synod.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: See Goll, Quellen und Untersuchungen, II., pp. 78 and 85, and\r\nMüller, Die deutschen Katechismen der Böhmischen Brüder, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: In the Moravian Church the rite of Confirmation is generally\r\nperformed, not by a Bishop, but by the resident minister; and herein, I\r\nbelieve, they are true to the practice of the early Christian Church.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: See preface to Moravian Tune Book, large edition.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Burkhardt: Die Brüdergemeine, Erster Theil, p. 189.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's History of the Moravian Church, by J.
