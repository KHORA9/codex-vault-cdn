In\r\ndiscussing it, we shall commence with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USE OF INFANTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject will be considered under the following heads:--\r\n\r\n   I.--ITS ATTACK, GENERALLY.\r\n  II.--FORMATIONS FOR ATTACK.\r\n III.--THE ATTACK, HOW MADE.\r\n  IV.--BAYONET CHARGES.\r\n   V.--DEFENCE AGAINST INFANTRY.\r\n  VI.--DEFENCE AGAINST ARTILLERY.\r\n VII.--DEFENCE AGAINST CAVALRY.\r\nVIII.--SQUARES.\r\n  IX.--SKIRMISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Its Attack, generally.\r\n\r\nInfantry attacks with its fire, or with the bayonet. Which of these is\r\nthe more effective?\r\n\r\n1. The _object_ of an attack is to destroy or capture the hostile force,\r\nor, at least, to drive it from the field.\r\n\r\nCapturing the enemy, or driving him from the field, cannot usually be\r\neffected by merely firing upon him.\r\n\r\nTrue, a mere fire at a distance may finally destroy him. But an\r\ninsuperable objection to this mode of attack is, that while we are\r\nkilling or disabling his men, he is killing or disabling as many of our\r\nown.\r\n\r\n2. If we fire from _behind cover_, our loss may be comparatively small.\r\nBut, in that case, the enemy will never remain for any length of time\r\nexposed to our fire. He will either attack and rout us from our cover,\r\nor retire. And even if he did neither, his actual and complete\r\ndestruction, capture, or rout, would still require an attack with the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\n3. It follows that the proper mode of attack by infantry on infantry is\r\nwith the _bayonet_.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Suwarrow's victories and reputation were won chiefly by his\r\nfierce bayonet attacks, which often effected great results, in spite of\r\nhis ignorance of the art of war.\r\n\r\n4. But there are _exceptional cases_ where infantry may properly use\r\nonly its fire; as--\r\n\r\n(1.) When acting as a support to artillery, it should rarely, if ever,\r\nleave its position to use the bayonet; thereby endangering the safety of\r\nthe guns which it is its first duty to guard. Its function, in this\r\ncase, being purely defensive, it should act by its fire alone.\r\n\r\n(2.) Against a line of skirmishers deployed, a well-directed fire will\r\nusually be sufficiently effective.\r\n\r\n(3.) In mountain warfare, its only practicable mode of attack will\r\nsometimes be by its fire.\r\n\r\n5. When both sides are _equally exposed_, the actual attack with the\r\nbayonet should not be preceded by a distant musketry fire; for, as in\r\nthat case, our loss will generally be equal to the enemy's, this fire\r\nwill give us no superiority in the charge, and the loss we have\r\nsustained will be therefore entirely thrown away.\r\n\r\n6. Nevertheless, our actual attack should be _prepared_, when possible,\r\nby the infliction of such a loss on the enemy as will make him inferior\r\nto us at the decisive moment. In war, the object is not to test the\r\ncomparative courage of the combatants, but to beat the enemy. We must\r\nnever, therefore, when it can be avoided, fight him on equal terms; and\r\nso, never close with him without such a superiority in numbers,\r\nposition, or spirit, as will make the chances decidedly in our favor.\r\nIf, without exposing ourselves to much loss, we can inflict a\r\nconsiderable loss upon him, we shall render him inferior to us, both by\r\nthe number of his men we have disabled, and by the demoralization\r\nthereby caused in his ranks.\r\n\r\n7. This preparatory loss can be most effectually inflicted by the _fire\r\nof artillery_; as, from its great superiority of range, it can suffer\r\nbut little, meanwhile, from the enemy's infantry fire. Our attacking\r\ninfantry are thus enabled to keep out of the range of the fire of the\r\ninfantry they are to attack, till the moment of advancing to close.\r\n\r\n8. When we have no artillery disposable for the purpose, the preparatory\r\neffect may be produced by a _well-sustained fire of infantry_, provided\r\nit can find a sheltered position to deliver it from; or, by the fire of\r\na heavy line of skirmishers.\r\n\r\n9. If we can make the infantry we wish to attack _engage in a prolonged\r\nfire_, this will exhaust them, and thus render them inferior to us in\r\nstrength and in spirit, even if we inflict on them but little loss. But\r\nas our attacking infantry should, in the mean time, be kept fresh, the\r\npreparatory fire, in such case, should not devolve on the troops that\r\nare to close with the enemy.\r\n\r\n10. One cause of the _indecisiveness of the results_ obtained in many of\r\nthe battles of the late war, as compared with the great loss of life on\r\nboth sides, has been, that the opposing battalions were too often kept\r\nfiring at each other at a distance, both sustaining nearly equal loss,\r\nuntil the ranks were so weakened as to disable either party from making\r\na vigorous and decisive charge. Or else, charges were made on the\r\nenemy's battalions before they had been shattered by artillery; so that\r\nthe attacking troops were easily repulsed, sometimes with great\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Formations for Attack.\r\n\r\n1. Infantry may advance to attack in either of _three ways_: in column;\r\nin line, marching by the front; and by the flank; that is, in line, but\r\nfaced to a flank.\r\n\r\n2. Of these three formations, the last is undoubtedly the _worst\r\npossible_; for--\r\n\r\n(1.) On arriving at the enemy, the troops are not concentrated at the\r\npoint where the struggle is to be. As they must come up successively,\r\nthey will be crushed in detail by superior numbers.\r\n\r\n(2.) Advancing in such a formation, they would be exposed to a\r\ndestructive raking fire from the enemy's guns; especially since the\r\nadoption of the new flank march by fours, which gives to rifled\r\nartillery a tolerable mark.\r\n\r\n3. The question is, then, between an attack in column and an attack in\r\nline. _Which is the better_ of the two?\r\n\r\nThe decisive effect of infantry is produced by a rush on the enemy with\r\nthe bayonet. The chief elements of success in this attack at close\r\nquarters are, the physical momentum of the charge, and the powerful\r\nmoral effect caused by the swift approach of a compact and orderly\r\nhostile mass. A charge in line does not admit of both these elements.\r\nThe advance of a line of one or more battalions, to be united and\r\norderly, cannot be rapid, and thus has no impetus. Such a line,\r\nadvancing swiftly, especially over uneven ground, would soon become so\r\nbroken and disunited as to destroy, in a great measure, the effect, both\r\nmoral and physical, of its charge, and, at the same time, to deprive the\r\nattacking troops of that confidence which is inspired by the\r\nconsciousness of moving together in one compact, formidable mass, in\r\nwhich every soldier feels himself fortified by the support of his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n4. On the other hand, _a column_ can move rapidly without losing its\r\ncompactness and order.\r\n\r\nIn attacking the enemy's line, a close column concentrates successively,\r\nbut rapidly, a force superior to the enemy at the decisive point, and\r\ncan hardly fail to pierce the line attacked, if it arrive with its\r\nmomentum unchecked.\r\n\r\nIn a close column, there is a real force created by the pressure of the\r\nmass behind on the leading subdivision, pushing it on the enemy, and\r\npreventing it from drawing back or stopping; thus imparting to it\r\nsomewhat of the actual physical momentum of a mechanical engine.\r\n\r\nA close column shelters raw troops, and carries them irresistibly along\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nA close column, in case of need, can rapidly extend its front by\r\ndeploying.\r\n\r\nIt can promptly make itself impenetrable to cavalry.\r\n\r\nFinally, in a column, the officers being seen by the men, the benefit of\r\ntheir example is not lost.\r\n\r\nThe close column would, therefore, seem to be the best formation for\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n5. Movements in line requiring that high degree of perfection in drill\r\nwhich can rarely be attained by any but regular troops, they were\r\naccordingly abandoned by the raw and undisciplined masses of French\r\nsoldiers that so successfully defended the French Republic from invasion\r\nagainst the veteran armies of Europe; some of which were led by generals\r\nwho had served under Frederick the Great. Conscious of their military\r\ninferiority to the enemy, they instinctively clustered together in\r\nclose and heavy columns; then rushed down on the enemy's line with the\r\nforce of an avalanche, often carrying every thing before them. Thus was\r\ninaugurated that system of attack in _deep and solid columns_, which was\r\nafterwards so successfully used by Napoleon.\r\n\r\n6. Close columns have two defects. One is, that they are _oppressive and\r\nexhausting_ to the men, especially in hot weather.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a very serious objection; for they are, or should be,\r\nformed only when about to be used, and then their work is generally soon\r\nover.\r\n\r\n7. The other defect, however, is of so grave a nature as, in the opinion\r\nof some, to more than outweigh their advantages; and this is, the\r\n_terribly destructive effect_ upon them of the enemy's artillery fire,\r\nor of that of his sharpshooters; for the solid mass is an easy target,\r\ninto which every shot is sure to penetrate. Many of the missiles which\r\nwould fly over an advancing line, are sure to fall, somewhere or other,\r\nin a deep column.\r\n\r\nThis destructive effect was strikingly illustrated in Macdonald's charge\r\non the Allied centre at Wagram. The eleven thousand men (some accounts\r\nsay fifteen thousand) composing that famous column, advanced under the\r\nfire of one hundred and eighty hostile guns. After being driven back\r\ntwice, they succeeded, in a third attack, in breaking the enemy's\r\ncentre. But of the entire column, only eleven hundred men, it is said,\r\nwere left standing.\r\n\r\n8. The recent improvements in fire-arms must render the fire on a close\r\ncolumn of infantry, both by artillery and sharpshooters, still more\r\ndestructive than it was before. But this sacrifice of life can be\r\nprevented, to a great extent, by using the columns at a proper time and\r\nin a proper manner. They should, like storming parties (which they\r\nreally are), never be launched against the enemy's line till the fire by\r\nwhich they would suffer has been _quite or nearly silenced_ by our\r\nbatteries. Sometimes this may be impracticable; but this precaution has\r\noften been neglected when it was perfectly feasible, thus causing a\r\ngreat and useless slaughter.\r\n\r\n9. But destructive as may be artillery fire on close columns, on troops\r\nadvancing in line grape and canister _begin to be equally so_ on their\r\narriving within four hundred yards of the enemy's batteries; and are\r\ncertainly quite as destructive, and more so, at the distance of two\r\nhundred yards. So that, within this distance, at least, the superiority\r\nof lines over columns ceases; and, probably, much sooner.\r\n\r\n10. The _desideratum_ is to preserve the advantages of the column, while\r\nsaving the attacking troops from the almost total destruction which\r\nwould now seem to threaten them, when marching in such a formation, from\r\nthe new rifled artillery, which is said to fire with accuracy at two\r\nthousand yards, and from the new infantry rifles, said to be reliable,\r\nin the hands of sharpshooters, at five hundred yards.\r\n\r\n11. Perhaps this object might be attained by the advance of the\r\nattacking troops in line, but _in loose order_, and at double quick, to\r\nabout two hundred paces from the enemy, a halt, a prompt alignment on\r\nthe colors, a rapid ployment into close column doubled on the centre,\r\nfollowed by a swift and resolute charge with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nThis method, while giving the rapid clearing of the intervening ground,\r\nto within two hundred paces of the enemy, and afterwards the impetus,\r\nand other advantages of the column, would, at the same time, afford that\r\ncomparative immunity from a destructive fire which is the chief\r\nadvantage of an advance in line.\r\n\r\nTo guard against the danger, in the use of this method, of the troops\r\nstopping to fire, instead of ploying into a column of attack, they\r\nshould commence their advance with pieces unloaded. Their boxes might\r\neven be previously emptied of their ammunition. Why should not a battle,\r\nas well as an assault on a fortress, have its \"forlorn hope?\"\r\n\r\n12. This mode of attack would be open, it is true, to _two\r\nobjections_:--\r\n\r\nFirst. It would require for its successful execution under fire great\r\ncoolness, and much previous instruction in the manoeuvre, to enable\r\nthe troops to perform it promptly and accurately.\r\n\r\nSecondly. In presence of a bold and active enemy, it would expose the\r\nattacking troops to the danger of being charged and routed while\r\nmanoeuvring.\r\n\r\n13. In the late War of the Rebellion, in lieu of close columns, attacks\r\nhave been sometimes made in _several lines_, following each other at\r\ndistances of three hundred paces or more. Although these attacks have\r\nsometimes succeeded, they are objectionable in principle; for each line\r\nis in danger of being repulsed successively, before the arrival of the\r\none in its rear; and there is wanting that great superiority of force at\r\nthe decisive point which is the most important element of success in a\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nSuch formations are essentially defensive in their nature, and not\r\nsuitable for attack. A line in position, against which the enemy is\r\nadvancing, is strong in its fire, which will usually preserve it from\r\nabsolute defeat till a second line, posted at one hundred and fifty, or\r\neven three hundred paces in its rear, has had time to come up in\r\nsupport. But even these distances Napoleon's experience appears to have\r\ntaught him to be much too great; for in his last battle, at Waterloo, he\r\nposted his second line, both infantry and cavalry, at only sixty paces\r\nbehind the first; thus sacrificing, to a great extent, the advantage of\r\nkeeping the second line out of fire, in order to secure the more\r\nimportant one of concentration of force. But this was only his formation\r\nfor defence; for, in the same battle, his formations for attack were\r\nalways in close columns.\r\n\r\n14. Our present Infantry Tactics have adopted two new expedients to\r\naccelerate the advance of battalions, and diminish the loss to which\r\ncolumns of attack are liable--Division Columns and Advancing by the\r\nFlank of Subdivisions.\r\n\r\nAs _Division Columns_ break the battalion line into several columns,\r\neach of two or three subdivisions deep, as a substitute for a single\r\ncolumn four or five subdivisions deep, they undoubtedly diminish the\r\nloss from the enemy's artillery fire in corresponding proportion. But in\r\ncompensation for this partial advantage, they have three defects:--\r\n\r\n(1.) In moving rapidly for any distance, especially over broken or\r\nobstructed ground, both the alignment and the proper intervals between\r\nthe columns will usually be lost; thus causing, in the deployment, a\r\ndangerous loss of time in re-establishing the alignment and the correct\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n(2.) In advancing in line of division columns, there is no means of\r\nforming square, except by passing through an intermediate formation.\r\n\r\n(3.) The intervals between the columns are so many gaps, through which\r\ncavalry could easily penetrate, and take the columns in rear.\r\n\r\nThe line of division columns appears to have been first suggested by\r\nMarshal Marmont, who was a good artillery commander, but not\r\nnecessarily, for that reason, a weighty authority on a point of\r\nInfantry Tactics.\r\n\r\n15. The manoeuvre of _Advancing by the Flank of Subdivisions_ is\r\nobnoxious to all the objections just pointed out in regard to Division\r\nColumns. On being threatened by cavalry, though the troops would have no\r\nintermediate formation to pass through to prepare for forming square,\r\nthey would have to face into column and close to half distance, which\r\nthere would often not be time to do.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the flank march being habitually by fours, the\r\nsubdivisions would offer a tolerable mark for the enemy's artillery, and\r\nthus be exposed to a destructive enfilade.\r\n\r\nAnd in forming into line, where the leading guides have not accurately\r\npreserved both their alignment and their intervals, which must be the\r\nusual case in the field, there must be more or less delay and confusion,\r\nof which a prompt and active enemy would not fail to take fatal\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe mode prescribed by the Tactics (Par. 150, School of the Battalion),\r\nfor executing the manoeuvre of forming line while advancing by\r\nsubdivision flanks, seems also to call for remark; it being \"by company\r\n(or division) into line.\" In other words, each individual soldier\r\nbrings a shoulder forward, breaks off from his comrades, and hurries up,\r\nnot on a line with them, but detached from them, and moving\r\nindependently, to find his proper place. This destroys for the time\r\nbeing, and at a critical moment, the unity of the subdivisions, and so\r\nimpairs the confidence soldiers derive from realizing that they form\r\npart of a compact mass. In thus executing this manoeuvre under fire,\r\nand near the enemy, there is danger of the men becoming confused and\r\nbewildered. For this reason, a better method of forming line would seem\r\nto be to re-form the column by a simple facing, and then to _wheel_ into\r\nline by subdivisions.\r\n\r\n16. The worst possible _order of marching_ in battle, for any\r\nconsiderable number of men, as a battalion, for instance, is by the\r\nflank. Such a line, advancing in what is really a column of fours, would\r\nbe rolled up and crushed, on the enemy's attacking its head; and would,\r\nmeanwhile, be exposed to enfilade. Marching _to_ a flank, it would be\r\nrunning the gauntlet of the enemy's batteries and musketry fire. In\r\nforming into line in either case, much time would be lost; as in flank\r\nmarching in the field, especially when the ground is ragged or\r\nobstructed, distances cannot be preserved.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked, that marching to a flank in column also,\r\nwhether by division, company, or platoon, is highly objectionable, as it\r\nconstantly exposes the column to an enfilading fire, as well as to be\r\nsuddenly charged in flank by cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Attack, how made.\r\n\r\n1. The speed of a column of attack must _never be checked_ for a moment,\r\nto enable it to reply to the enemy's fire. The fire of the column will\r\nbe ineffective, for it will be the fire of excited men, and very limited\r\nin extent, as it can proceed from the leading division only; and the\r\nfire once begun, it will be hard to stop it. If, in order to fire, we\r\nhalt the column, re-forming it under the excitement of the fire will be\r\nvery difficult; and the enemy's least forward movement may then cause a\r\nrout.\r\n\r\nAt Maida, in Calabria, in 1806, the French columns attacked the English\r\nunder General Stuart. When within thirty paces, the English gave them a\r\nvolley. The French, stunned, as it were, began, at once, to deploy. The\r\nEnglish fired again, and the French retreated.\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo, in the last grand attack by the French, the advance column\r\nof the Imperial Guard was decisively repulsed by the British Guards.\r\nThese had been lying on the ground behind the crest of the slope until\r\nthe French appeared, when they suddenly rose up and poured in a\r\nmurderous volley at short range. Instead of instantly charging with the\r\nbayonet, the French hesitated, then began to deploy. The British charged\r\nat once, and drove them down the hill.\r\n\r\n2. This dangerous halt and deployment is apt also to occur when the\r\ncolumn finds _sheltering objects by the way_. Therefore, hurry by these,\r\nand hasten the step.\r\n\r\n3. It will also tend to prevent such an untoward accident, if we furnish\r\nthe columns of attack, where several are employed, with _skirmishers_ in\r\ntheir intervals, as well as on their outer flanks, to draw the enemy's\r\nfire. Otherwise, the column fired into will be apt, in order to return\r\nthe fire, to halt instinctively and deploy into line, which breaks up\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\n4. From this it appears that the limited fire of a column of attack is,\r\nin fact, _no defect_, the highest offensive power of infantry being in\r\nthe bayonet. Fire, in the attack, is generally ineffective, and\r\nsometimes injurious. It should rarely be used till the enemy has turned\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\n5. As to attacking _cavalry_:\r\n\r\nInfantry may advance in line and attack cavalry safely, provided its\r\nflanks are protected. Before a long line of infantry, cavalry must\r\nretreat, or be destroyed by its fire. In the Austrian service it is said\r\nto be a received maxim, that horses will not stand before the steady\r\napproach of a mass of infantry, with bayonets at the charge, but will\r\nalways retire before the infantry closes on them.\r\n\r\n6. So, infantry _in column_, either closed in mass, or at half distance,\r\nmay attack cavalry successfully; taking care to be ready to form square,\r\nor \"column against cavalry,\" at the first symptom of their preparing to\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n7. As to attacking _artillery_:\r\n\r\nBefore charging, the infantry sometimes first seeks the shelter of\r\nground, using its sharpshooters to annoy it, and, if possible, to\r\nsilence its fire.\r\n\r\nOr, when circumstances are favorable, as when it can get a position near\r\nits flank, it attacks it vigorously, at once, with fire and bayonet.\r\n\r\nBut when infantry has to advance to the attack of a battery in front, it\r\nshould never be in any compact formation, but always deployed as\r\nskirmishers. Otherwise, it would usually meet with a bloody repulse;\r\nespecially where any considerable space of ground is to be cleared.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Malvern Hill, the rebel General Magruder's division was\r\nsent, either in column or in line, to charge a powerful Union battery\r\njust beyond an open field a mile and three-quarters in length. The\r\nrebels rushed into the field at a full run, but encountered a murderous\r\nfire from the guns they were sent to attack, which mowed them down by\r\nhundreds. By the time they had cleared two-thirds of the ground, the\r\ncarnage was so dreadful as to drive them back to the woods from which\r\nthey had started. Twice more they were sent forward in the same manner,\r\nbut with the same result; when the undertaking was abandoned.\r\n\r\n8. In attacking a battery, we may often secure its capture by a volley\r\n_aimed at the horses_; the effect of which may prevent the enemy from\r\ncarrying it off. But this should be avoided when there is a good\r\nprospect of capturing the battery without disabling the horses; since\r\nthen, if we succeed, we shall be able to immediately use the battery\r\nagainst the enemy ourselves.\r\n\r\n9. In the French Revolution, the Chouans of La Vendée attacked the\r\nRepublican batteries in _several single files_, of one or two hundred\r\nmen each, at intervals of fifty paces. Such a formation protects the\r\nattacking columns, to a great extent, from the enemy's fire, but exposes\r\nthem to destruction by a charge from the battery supports. In the\r\nabsence of these, it would often be very advantageous; since, by proper\r\ndrilling, these columns in one rank could be made, on arriving near the\r\nenemy, to rapidly double in two or four ranks, without halting, and\r\nthen, by filing to a flank and facing, to advance by the front in a\r\ncompact line.\r\n\r\nThe same formation would be useful for troops advancing to assault an\r\nintrenchment; but, as in the case of a battery, subject to the risk of\r\nbeing destroyed by a sudden sortie from the work.\r\n\r\n10. Artillery is never without _supports_. One part of the infantry,\r\ntherefore, deployed as skirmishers, should attack the guns, circling\r\nround them, and opening fire on the men and horses; while the other part\r\nattacks the support in flank. On getting sufficiently near, the\r\nassailants should try to draw the fire of the guns, and then rush on\r\nthem before they have time to reload.\r\n\r\nIf a battery gets into confusion, or there is any delay in unlimbering\r\nor limbering up, then is the most favorable time to capture it by a\r\nvigorous charge with the bayonet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Bayonet Charges.\r\n\r\n1. When made resolutely, and _without slackening the gait_, bayonet\r\ncharges have succeeded in nine cases out of ten.\r\n\r\n2. The bayonet is usually more effective than _grape_, _canister_, or\r\n_bullets_.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Leipsic, in 1813, Kleist's Prussian division was sent\r\nto carry the position of Probstheyda. For this purpose it was necessary\r\nto advance up a long slope, the crest of which was occupied by Drouot's\r\nartillery. The French allowed the Prussians to approach to within a\r\nshort distance, and then poured into them a most destructive shower of\r\ngrape, which drove them back for a moment in confusion. But they\r\nimmediately rallied, and rushed desperately on again. Marshal Victor\r\nthen charged them with the bayonet, and completely repulsed them.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, having been re-enforced by Wittgenstein's Russian division,\r\nthey again advanced, under a constant shower of grape from Drouot. They,\r\nnevertheless, kept advancing; and, in spite of the great loss they\r\nsuffered, were about carrying the position, when the French again\r\ncharged with the bayonet, forcing them down to the very foot of the\r\ndeclivity; where, being once more covered with grape, their repulse was\r\ncomplete and final.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Mill Springs, in January, 1862, after the\r\ncombatants had been exchanging musketry fires for several hours without\r\nany decisive result, the rebels' left was vigorously charged by the\r\nNinth Ohio with the bayonet. This charge broke the enemy's flank. His\r\nwhole line gave way in confusion, and the battle was won.\r\n\r\nSo, at Malvern Hill, in 1862, in several instances, columns of rebels\r\nwhom a storm of canister and shell had failed to repulse, were driven\r\nback and routed by a dash with the bayonet, after a volley poured in at\r\na few yards from the muzzles of the guns.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Seven Pines, according to General Heintzelman's\r\nreport, whenever our troops used the bayonet, their loss was\r\ncomparatively light, and the enemy was driven back, suffering heavily.\r\n\r\n3. The bayonet charge, when made from any considerable distance, should\r\nbe _in column_; the only formation in which order can be combined with\r\nsufficient speed. But, at a short distance, a bayonet charge by a line,\r\ninstantly after firing a volley to repel an attack, will be very\r\neffective, and usually successful.\r\n\r\n4. In ordinary cases, the charge should be _prepared_ by first\r\nshattering the hostile masses, or, at least, wearying and demoralizing\r\nthem by artillery, or by skirmishers' fire.\r\n\r\n5. The more _vigorous and resolute_ the charge, the greater the chance\r\nof success. The enemy never retires before a moderate advance.\r\n\r\n6. Where the enemy is _forced into a defile_, a charge with the bayonet,\r\npreceded by a few rounds of grape, will complete his destruction.\r\n\r\n7. When the enemy is _behind cover_, the best way to drive him from it\r\nis with the bayonet. This will cause less loss of life than to attempt\r\nto return his fire. But, in such case, the charge should be prepared,\r\nwhen possible, by a few shells, or rounds of canister.\r\n\r\n8. Shots up or down a declivity usually miss. A _height_ should,\r\ntherefore, be carried with the bayonet, without firing.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect, moreover, of a steady charge of infantry up a hill,\r\nwithout stopping to fire, is very great; and such a charge is usually\r\nsuccessful. Prince Czartoryski, Alexander's most experienced general at\r\nAusterlitz, admitted that he lost all confidence in the result on seeing\r\nthe French infantry ascending the plateau of Pratzen, the key to the\r\nAllies' position, with a firm and decided step, without once stopping to\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nSo, at Chattanooga, in November, 1863, Thomas's troops carried the\r\nheight of Missionary Ridge by a similar steady and determined ascent, in\r\nspite of the volleys of grape and canister from nearly thirty pieces of\r\nartillery, and of musketry from the rebels' rifle-pits at the summit.\r\nGeneral Grant attributed the small number of casualties our troops\r\nsustained in the attack to the rebels' surprise at its audacity, causing\r\n\"confusion and purposeless aiming of their pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Defence against Infantry.\r\n\r\n1. The defence of infantry is by its fire, and therefore its proper\r\ndefensive formation is in _deployed lines_.\r\n\r\n2. Avoid a _premature commencement_ of the fire. Long firing exhausts\r\nthe men's energy, expends the ammunition, fouls the pieces, destroys the\r\nsoldier's confidence in his weapon, and emboldens the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. So, a fire upon an enemy while _under cover_, as in a wood, would be\r\nvirtually thrown away. If his fire from such a position causes us any\r\nloss, he had better be shelled, or driven away by skirmishers, according\r\nto circumstances.\r\n\r\n4. The practice of hostile regiments exchanging for a considerable time\r\na _musketry fire at a distance_, is highly objectionable, as it causes a\r\ngreat sacrifice of life without corresponding results. Instead of\r\nstanding in line for ten minutes, receiving and returning fire at a\r\ndistance of three hundred yards, it would be much better to clear this\r\nspace at double quick in two or three minutes, and close with the enemy;\r\nfor, in returning his fire, we can do him no more harm than we receive,\r\nwhile nothing decisive is accomplished. The case is, of course,\r\ndifferent where our own troops are behind cover, while the enemy's are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n5. But in _special cases_, as where we have to cover a flank movement of\r\nour second line, or of the reserve, or to await a force coming to our\r\nsupport, it may be necessary to keep up an incessant fusillade, without\r\nregard to losses received.\r\n\r\n6. Fire in action is of two kinds: the fire at will, and the fire by\r\nvolleys; the former kind being the rule, the latter the exception.\r\nAlthough the fire at will is the one principally used, there are _very\r\nstrong objections_ to it.\r\n\r\n(1.) The men load and fire as individuals, and generally with great\r\nrapidity, and under more or less excitement, rarely stopping to take a\r\ndeliberate aim. The consequence is, that very few shots take effect, and\r\nthe fire is, for the greater part, wasted, as is shown by the\r\nwell-established fact that, in every engagement, for every man killed or\r\ndisabled, there have been from three to ten thousand musket or rifle\r\nbullets fired.\r\n\r\n(2.) Except on windy days, a cloud of smoke soon collects in front of a\r\nline firing at will, hiding, more or less completely, the enemy from\r\nview. The fire being then at random, it is, of course, unreliable.\r\n\r\n(3.) The fire at will leads to a rapid and enormous consumption of\r\nammunition. To show how serious is this objection also, it is only\r\nnecessary to consider in how many instances victory has been turned into\r\ndefeat by the premature exhaustion, by one or more regiments, of their\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n(4.) As a necessary consequence of this rapid consumption of ammunition,\r\nthe pieces soon become fouled, and thus, to a great extent, useless.\r\n\r\n(5.) Troops under a musketry fire at will, soon become accustomed to it,\r\nand its incessant din produces on them a stunning effect, which deadens,\r\nin no small degree, their sensibility to danger.\r\n\r\n7. On the other hand, _volley firing_ has often been attended with\r\ndecisive results, especially when it has been reserved to the proper\r\nmoment, and delivered at short range. Instances of this have occurred in\r\nalmost every great battle we read of in history, as also in the late War\r\nof the Rebellion. For example: at the battle of South Mountain,\r\nDoubleday's brigade was engaged with a heavy force of rebels at some\r\nthirty or forty paces in its front. Our men were behind a fence, firing\r\nat will; but their fire made little or no impression on the enemy, who\r\nattempted to charge at the least cessation of the fire. Our troops were\r\nthen made to cease firing, to lie down behind the fence, and, on the\r\nenemy's approach to within fifteen paces, to spring up and pour in a\r\nvolley. This was so deadly, that the rebels fled in disorder, leaving\r\ntheir dead and wounded, and could not be rallied again.\r\n\r\nAt Chickamauga, in 1863, the regiments of Hazen's brigade fired only by\r\nvolleys; every one of which, it is officially reported, was powerfully\r\neffective in checking the enemy's attacks.\r\n\r\n8. Nevertheless, it has been a common military saying, and supported\r\neven by high authority, that the fire at will is _the only one possible\r\nin action_. This assertion implies that the rank and file are not\r\nsufficiently cool to reserve their fire, and that they must be kept\r\nconstantly occupied by the excitement, noise, and smoke of their own\r\nfire, in order to make them remain steady in their ranks under that of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nAs applied to raw, undisciplined, or demoralized troops, the proposition\r\nmay be, to a great extent, true. But in reference to disciplined or\r\nveteran troops, whose _morale_ has not been impaired, it will be found\r\ndisproved on almost every page of military history; from which a few\r\nexamples will be cited hereafter. For the present, one instance will\r\nsuffice; that of Colonel Willich's regiment of Thirty-second Indiana\r\nVolunteers, at the battle of Shiloh, in April, 1862. While under fire,\r\ntheir commander, perceiving their own fire to have become \"a little\r\nwild,\" caused them to cease firing, and then drilled them in the manual\r\nof arms, which they went through as if on parade; after which, they\r\nagain opened on the enemy a fire, which is reported to have been\r\n\"deliberate, steady, and effective.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be here observed that, whenever troops lose their presence of\r\nmind, there is no surer way of restoring it than by the repetition, by\r\ntheir officers, in their usual tone, of any words of command they have\r\nlearned instinctively to obey on the drill-ground.\r\n\r\n9. Infantry, when charged in position, should reserve its fire till it\r\ncan be made _with deadly effect_, as at the distance of fifty paces; and\r\nthe volleys should be instantly followed up by a countercharge with the\r\nbayonet on the charging enemy. For, if our fire has staggered him, a\r\nvigorous charge will complete his repulse; and if it has not, our only\r\nchance of success is in suddenly taking the offensive ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhilst awaiting his charge, we shall incur but little, if any, loss\r\nfrom the enemy's fire; for the fire of troops advancing to attack is\r\nusually of very little account.\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage attending a volley just before we charge is, that,\r\nas the smoke veils us from the enemy's view, it will rob us, to some\r\nextent, of the moral effect of our swift advance.\r\n\r\nBut, in many cases, if the enemy see us awaiting his bayonet attack, and\r\nreserving our fire to the very last, he loses resolution, relaxes his\r\nspeed, and then stops short, or retires.\r\n\r\nAt Cowpens, Colonel Howard broke and routed the British line which was\r\nadvancing to attack him, by reserving his fire to within thirty yards,\r\nand then charging with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Friedland, the Russian Imperial Guard charged on\r\nDupont's division with the bayonet. The French did not wait for them to\r\nclose, but rushed on with the bayonet themselves, and completely routed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n10. A volley concentrated upon the enemy's _regimental colors_ will\r\nusually disable the color-guard and the men near it; and, if promptly\r\nfollowed up by a charge, may enable us to capture the colors. This is\r\nalways an important advantage; for, by the loss of its colors, a\r\nregiment is not only dispirited, but in danger of disorganization;\r\nthese being its proper rallying-point.\r\n\r\n11. When infantry is acting as a _support to artillery_ which is\r\nattacked, it should throw out sharpshooters to reply to the enemy's\r\nskirmishers that are firing at the gunners and horses, whilst it engages\r\nthe compact mass by which it is itself attacked.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy should commit the blunder of attacking the battery with his\r\nentire force, without detaching to engage the support, we should profit\r\nby it by instantly charging him in flank; but taking care not to be led\r\naway to any distance from the battery we are protecting.\r\n\r\n12. Infantry, surrounded by the enemy, will often be able to _cut its\r\nway through_ and escape. For this purpose, as the highest degree of\r\nconcentration is required, its formation should be in close column.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Defence against Artillery.\r\n\r\n1. The best defence of infantry against artillery is by the fire of\r\n_sharpshooters_ deployed as skirmishers, to pick off the gunners and the\r\nhorses; the main body, meanwhile, occupying the most sheltered locality\r\nit can find.\r\n\r\n2. Where no shelter is afforded by any natural obstacles, or by\r\nirregularities of ground, it may be sometimes necessary to make the men\r\n_lie down_.\r\n\r\nBut this expedient should be used as rarely as possible, on account of\r\nits demoralizing tendency. Troops that have become accustomed to it\r\ncannot be expected to bravely face the enemy; and the habit is very\r\nrapidly formed. At Bull Run, in July, 1861, a whole company was seen to\r\ngrovel in the dust at the mere snapping of a percussion-cap of one of\r\ntheir own muskets.\r\n\r\nThis demoralizing tendency does not exist, however, where troops lie\r\ndown only to enable their own artillery to fire over them. This was\r\nshown at the battle of Pea Ridge, where several of our regiments lay on\r\nthe ground for two hours or more, while thirty of our guns were firing\r\nover them. When, at last, this fire had silenced the enemy's guns, our\r\ninfantry then rose, charged him in a compact line, and drove him from\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n3. A line of infantry may _avoid_ cannon-shot by advancing or retiring\r\nfifty paces. A column or a square would have to move this distance, or\r\nmore, according to its depth.\r\n\r\nRicochet shots may be avoided by moving fifty paces to the right or\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThis shifting of position is but a temporary expedient, it is true, for\r\nthe enemy's guns will soon obtain the exact range again. But for this,\r\nseveral trial-shots will be requisite, thus making the enemy lose time;\r\nand, in battle, a few minutes lost or gained have often decided between\r\nvictory and defeat.\r\n\r\n4. When the enemy opens an artillery fire on a square, _preparatory to a\r\ncavalry charge_, his fire must cease when his cavalry approaches the\r\nsquare; say, on its arriving within one hundred and fifty yards. To\r\navoid the artillery fire, the square may safely remain lying down until\r\nthe hostile cavalry has reached this point. For, as they will require\r\nabout half a minute to clear the intervening ground, the square will\r\nstill have time enough left to rise, align its ranks, and deliver a\r\nvolley before the cavalry reaches it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Defence against Cavalry.\r\n\r\n1. The discipline of infantry is never put to a severer test than when\r\nit is required to resist a _charge of cavalry_, properly made. The moral\r\neffect of a charge of a body of horse at full speed, on the troops\r\nwaiting to receive it, is like that caused by the swift approach of a\r\nlocomotive under full steam, seeming quite as irresistible. It would be\r\nso in reality, but for the counter effect produced both on the horses\r\nand their riders by the sight of the infantry standing firm and\r\nreserving its fire. I have been told by an old cuirassier officer, who\r\nserved through the campaigns of Napoleon with distinguished bravery,\r\nthat there was no operation that his regiment so much dreaded as a\r\ncharge upon well-disciplined infantry.\r\n\r\n2. This counter moral effect on the charging cavalry is the greater,\r\n_the longer the infantry reserve their fire_; since, the less the\r\ndistance at which it is delivered, the more fatal will be its effects. A\r\nvolley at long range is not destructive enough to check the cavalry's\r\nadvance; while this effect has often been produced by the infantry\r\nmerely withholding its fire till the cavalry has approached very near;\r\nand a volley delivered at the very last moment has, in by far the\r\ngreater number of instances, effectually repulsed the charge.\r\n\r\nInfantry should, therefore, let cavalry approach to within forty paces,\r\nor nearer still, and then give them a general volley.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Neerwinden, in 1793, the Austrian cavalry was repulsed\r\nby the French infantry under Dumouriez, by a volley poured in at the\r\nvery muzzles of the pieces.\r\n\r\nAt Austerlitz, a Russian cavalry charge on French infantry in line was\r\nrepulsed by a volley delivered so near, that it stretched four hundred\r\ntroopers on the ground. The rest dispersed in disorder to the right and\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n3. The armor of cuirassiers is bullet-proof. To repel a charge of these\r\ntroops, therefore, it will be necessary to _aim at the horses_. Their\r\narmor is so heavy, that the mere fall of the riders on the ground is\r\nusually sufficient to disable them, as was the case with the French\r\ncuirassiers at Waterloo.\r\n\r\n4. Infantry in line, in two ranks even, may withstand cavalry, if in\r\ncompact order, and attacked _in front_. But the slightest cavalry charge\r\non the flank of a line will rout it.\r\n\r\nAt Quatre Bras, a French infantry line, advancing, repulsed a charge of\r\nthe Brunswicker Lancers under the Duke of Brunswick, by receiving it in\r\nsteadiness and good order, and then pouring in a destructive fire.\r\n\r\nBut, in the same battle, the Sixty-ninth British Regiment was instantly\r\nrolled up and destroyed by a charge of French cuirassiers on its flank.\r\n\r\n5. Where infantry is well disciplined, and its commander is cool and\r\nprompt, it may sometimes _avoid the effect_ of a cavalry charge by other\r\nmeans than its fire, or formation in square. At Talavera, a French\r\ninfantry division, drawn up in close column, seeing an English cavalry\r\nregiment charging down upon them, avoided the shock by simply stepping\r\naside, thus allowing the cavalry to pass by them. A portion of the\r\ncharging troops wheeled round to follow them; but, by the cross-fire of\r\nanother division, and the charge of other cavalry, which fell upon it in\r\nits confusion, it was completely annihilated.\r\n\r\n6. A line of infantry charged by cavalry in flank, and so suddenly as to\r\nallow no time to form square, could hardly escape destruction. It would\r\nseem that the best course to be adopted in such a case would be to _open\r\nthe ranks_ by a rapid and simultaneous movement of both of them, thus\r\ncompelling the charging cavalry to ride between them. If the front rank\r\nshould then face about, this would bring the cavalry between two fires,\r\nwhich might be poured in with most destructive effect.\r\n\r\nBut where the cavalry charges with a very wide front, or in line, this\r\nmanoeuvre might be difficult, or impossible.\r\n\r\n7. Whenever an infantry line is charged by cavalry in front, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether it will stand the shock, the wisest course would seem\r\nto be to make the men lie down, and let the charging cavalry _leap over\r\nthem_. This the horses will instinctively do, with but little risk of\r\ninjury to the men, provided they lie in a position parallel to the line\r\nof battle, thus presenting the least possible depth. It is said that the\r\nBritish infantry has sometimes done this, and risen up again immediately\r\nafter the cavalry had passed. The cavalry could thus be promptly taken\r\nin rear.\r\n\r\n8. In retreating, when threatened by cavalry, if there be a _long plain_\r\nin our rear, we must retire slowly. But if cover, or ground unfavorable\r\nto cavalry, be near, we must reach it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Squares.\r\n\r\n1. In 1813, France was nearly exhausted of soldiers, so that Napoleon,\r\non hastily preparing for his campaign of that year, was obliged to\r\nincorporate into his army a large number of raw conscripts, who had\r\nscarcely begun their elementary drill. On the route to their respective\r\npoints of concentration, he accordingly ordered his columns to halt each\r\nday, to practise _the three movements_ which he considered to be the\r\nmost important for infantry to be familiar with. These were, forming\r\nbattalions in square, deploying in line, and re-forming in column of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n2. In the Austrian service, squares formed by a _column in mass_ are\r\nconsidered preferable to hollow ones, on the supposition that though\r\nhorses will recoil from a dense mass, they may be easily brought to\r\nbreak through a shallow formation, over which they can see the open\r\nground. But this theory seems to be refuted by numerous facts. A large\r\nproportion of the formations that have successfully repulsed cavalry,\r\nsince the beginning of this century, have been hollow squares.\r\n\r\n3. The rule laid down in the Tactics (Par. 143, Skirmishers), directing\r\nthe skirmishers, in rallying on the square, to \"come to a ready without\r\ncommand, and fire upon the enemy; which will also be done by the\r\nreserve, as soon as it is unmasked by the skirmishers,\" is an unsound\r\none, for a compliance with it would be dangerous. A square cannot expect\r\nto repulse cavalry by an irregular fire at will, but only by\r\nwell-directed _volleys_. If cavalry charge a square firing irregularly,\r\nit will probably rout it. On the other hand, if a square wait coolly\r\ntill the cavalry is at twenty paces, its volley will be murderous. At\r\nWaterloo, the Allied squares that reserved their fire till the French\r\ncavalry had arrived at from twenty to forty paces, invariably repulsed\r\nit. At that battle, Ney led eleven cavalry charges against the British\r\nsquares, every one of which failed.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the campaign of 1813, Napoleon had, comparatively, but\r\na handful of cavalry; so few, that they had to keep close to their\r\ninfantry for protection. In crossing the plains of Lutzen, a large and\r\nsplendid cavalry force of the Allies, supported by infantry and by\r\nhorse-artillery, made an attack on Ney's corps, which consisted chiefly\r\nof young and raw recruits, who saw an enemy for the first time. The\r\nsituation was extremely dangerous, and Ney and his principal generals\r\nthrew themselves into the squares to encourage them. By volleys\r\ndelivered at a signal, the enemy's charges were all repulsed, and the\r\nconscripts acquired great confidence from the ease with which this was\r\ndone. Ney then broke up his squares, and, pursuing the enemy in columns,\r\ncompleted their repulse.\r\n\r\nAt Auerstadt, in 1806, Davoust's French squares had to sustain a long\r\nsuccession of charges from ten thousand Prussian horse. By reserving\r\ntheir fire, each time, to within thirty or forty paces, its effect was\r\nso deadly, that a rampart of dead and disabled men and horses was soon\r\nformed around the squares, and the charges were all repulsed.\r\n\r\nSo, at Jena, on the same day, Ney, posted in a square, allowed the\r\nPrussian cuirassiers to charge up to within fifteen or twenty paces,\r\nwhen the front attacked, at his word of command, poured in a fire which\r\ncompletely repulsed the charge, strewing the whole ground with dead and\r\nwounded. The Prussian cavalry, in that battle, are said to have been\r\n\"terrified at the sight of a motionless infantry reserving its fire.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at Mount Tabor, in 1798, General Kleber, marching with an\r\ninfantry division of only three thousand men, over an immense sandy\r\nplain, was attacked by twelve thousand Turkish horse. The French squares\r\nresisted their successive charges for six hours, by means of volleys\r\nreserved till the enemy were at the very muzzles of their guns; which\r\nsoon built up a rampart around them of men and horses. Bonaparte then\r\narrived with another division. Dividing it into two squares, he rapidly\r\nadvanced them in such a manner as to enclose the Turks in a kind of\r\ntriangle; when, by a sudden fire upon them from three points at once, he\r\ndrove them upon each other in confusion, making them flee in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that advancing or manoeuvring in squares is\r\npracticable only on open and level plains, like the sandy deserts of\r\nEgypt and Syria.\r\n\r\n4. The best reliance of an infantry square being, therefore, on its fire\r\nby volleys, the men should be instructed to come to a _charge bayonet_,\r\ninstead of a \"ready,\" immediately on forming square. From this latter\r\nposition, there would be much greater danger of the volley being\r\nprematurely delivered. The fire of a single excited man will usually be\r\nfollowed by a general discharge.\r\n\r\n5. It may be often advisable that the volley should be delivered by\r\n_both ranks_ at once, and not by a single one. Par. 1191, School of the\r\nBattalion, directing that \"a battalion, in square, will never use any\r\nother than the fire by file, or by rank,\" should therefore be amended.\r\n\r\n6. Moreover, in view of what has been said as to volley-firing, and of\r\nthe examples that have been cited in confirmation, there is reason to\r\ndoubt the wisdom of the direction contained in Par. 67, School of the\r\nCompany: \"The fire by file being that which is most frequently used\r\nagainst an enemy, it is highly important that it be rendered perfectly\r\nfamiliar to the troops. The instructor will, therefore, give it _almost\r\nexclusive preference_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire by file, after its commencement, becomes a mere individual fire\r\nat will. Independently of the general ineffectiveness of this kind of\r\nfire, one would have supposed that the instructor's attention should be\r\nrather directed to accustoming the men to the more difficult reserved\r\nfire by volleys, instead of practising them almost exclusively in a fire\r\nwhich, once learned, they will use instinctively, and without any\r\npractice at all.\r\n\r\n7. Infantry _breech-loading weapons_ would be very useful to troops in\r\nsquare, when charged by cavalry; since, being rapidly reloaded, they\r\nwould enable the square to repulse, with a volley, each subdivision\r\nsuccessively, where the charging column is formed at the usual\r\ndistances. But it is doubtful whether, on the whole, these weapons are\r\npreferable to muzzle-loaders. Certain it is, that they exhaust the\r\nammunition much more rapidly, and so cause a suspension of fire, and a\r\nwithdrawal from the line of battle, till a new supply can arrive. And,\r\nto obtain this new supply, a long time is generally required; infantry\r\nammunition being usually carried in the second, or more distant\r\nammunition train, instead of the first, or nearest one, as it ought to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n8. Although a reserved fire is much the most reliable in repulsing\r\ncavalry, the men may sometimes be ordered to commence the fire at a\r\n_considerable distance_. In such case, they should be instructed to aim\r\nat the horses, instead of their riders, as affording a better mark.\r\n\r\n9. European cavalry is often practised, on arriving within four hundred\r\nyards, or effective grape-shot distance, of an infantry square, to halt,\r\nand then open at the centre, unmasking a battery of horse-artillery,\r\nwhich plays for a certain time on the square, when the cavalry closes\r\nagain, and charges.\r\n\r\nA square, however, attacked in this manner, is _not in so much danger_\r\nof being broken as might be imagined. The enemy's guns, after being\r\nunmasked, would usually require several trial rounds to get the exact\r\nrange; and our sharpshooters, who could safely be thrown forward one\r\nhundred yards, with the new rifled arms, ought, in the mean time, to\r\ninflict such loss on the cavalry, as well as on the battery, as to cause\r\nit either to retire, or to charge feebly, and, therefore, ineffectively.\r\nAt the very worst, the square would have ample time to re-form its\r\nranks, and deliver a deadly volley before the cavalry could reach it, as\r\nit also would if this operation were attempted much nearer, say at two\r\nhundred yards. In this last case, a few volleys from the square itself,\r\nwith the new arms, would probably be destructive enough to prevent the\r\ncharge altogether.\r\n\r\n10. It is hardly necessary to observe, that troops formed in square,\r\nwhen charged by cavalry, can secure their safety only by _standing\r\nfirm_. A single opening will suffice to let in the enemy, who will then\r\neasily ride over the square, and cut it in pieces. Whereas, if the\r\nsquare remain unbroken, cavalry can inflict upon it no loss, or but a\r\ntrifling one.\r\n\r\n11. In repulsing a cavalry charge, coolness and presence of mind will\r\nsometimes enable troops to accomplish _extraordinary results_.\r\n\r\nAt Quatre Bras, the square of the Forty-second Highlanders was not\r\ncompleted, the companies still running in to form the rear face, when\r\nthe enemy's leading troop entered. But the square, nevertheless,\r\nfinished its formation; and the French cavalry, caught, as it were, in a\r\nnet, was soon destroyed by the concentrated fire of all the fronts,\r\nwhich had faced inward.\r\n\r\nIn the same battle, the Forty-fourth British Regiment, standing in line\r\nin two ranks, was suddenly charged in rear by the French Lancers, who\r\nhad dashed round one of their flanks for that purpose. The rear rank\r\nsuddenly faced about, and, at a very short distance, poured in a deadly\r\nfire, which put them into confusion. On their way back to re-form, the\r\nfront rank, in its turn, gave them a volley, which destroyed great\r\nnumbers of them, and completed their rout.\r\n\r\n12. Even when a square has been actually broken, it is _not necessarily\r\nlost_. If the troops are brave and well disciplined, it may sometimes be\r\nrallied again, re-formed, and made to repulse the attacking cavalry, as\r\nwas the case with some of the Allied squares at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Pultusk, in 1806, a French battalion that had been\r\nbroken and overthrown by Russian cavalry, immediately rallied, fell on\r\nthe troopers floundering in the mud, and dispatched them.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Krasnoe, in 1812, a large Russian square was\r\nretreating before the French cavalry masses. Occasionally, in order to\r\npass a narrow defile, it was obliged, temporarily, to break the square.\r\nAt these times the French made furious charges, penetrated into the\r\ncolumn, and captured men and guns. But as soon as the defile was passed,\r\nthe Russians instantly re-formed the square, and continued their\r\nretreat. They finally succeeded in reaching Korytnia, after killing and\r\nwounding some four hundred or five hundred of the French; though with\r\nthe loss of eight guns, one thousand prisoners, and seven hundred or\r\neight hundred _hors de combat_, out of five thousand or six thousand\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--Skirmishers.\r\n\r\nWe shall consider--\r\n\r\nFirst, THEIR USE.\r\n\r\nSecondly, HOW THEY ARE POSTED.\r\n\r\nThirdly, HOW THEY ARE HANDLED.\r\n\r\nFourthly, RULES FOR INDIVIDUAL SKIRMISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THEIR USE.\r\n\r\n1. In approaching the enemy through a wooded or broken country,\r\nskirmishers thrown out in advance, and on the flanks of the leading\r\ncolumn, are absolutely indispensable, in order to _reconnoitre the\r\nground_, and prevent a surprise.\r\n\r\n2. Skirmishers _protect_ the main body, or any particular portion of it,\r\nfrom attack while manoeuvring.\r\n\r\nA regiment, or a brigade, in covered ground, whether the enemy be\r\nvisible or not, should never change its position in battle, or\r\nmanoeuvre, without the protection of a skirmishing line.\r\n\r\n3. They furnish a screen, behind which the main body may _hide its\r\nmovements_, and be enabled to attack at an unexpected point.\r\n\r\n4. Where a ravine, a wood, or other similar obstacle causes _a break in\r\nour line of battle_, by occupying it with skirmishers we guard it\r\nagainst penetration by the enemy, and connect the separated corps with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n5. Skirmishers may be used to alarm the enemy at a point where he\r\nexpected no attack, and thus _create a diversion_.\r\n\r\n6. By their attack at various points, they serve to _unmask the enemy's\r\nposition_.\r\n\r\n7. They may be employed to _open the way for a charge_ with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Stone River, the rebels, on one occasion, advanced in\r\nline, with a double column in rear of each wing, preceded by a double\r\nline of skirmishers, who reserved their fire till close to our line,\r\nwhen they halted, poured in a murderous fire, and fell back on their\r\nmain body, which then rushed forward. Both our first and second lines,\r\nstaggered by this sudden and destructive fire, were swept from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n8. Skirmishers have been sometimes thrown forward to _test the spirit\r\nand disposition_ of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt Biberach, in 1800, the French general St. Cyr, after having carried\r\nthe place, and driven the Austrians through the defile in rear of it\r\nback upon their main body, posted on the heights of Wittenburg, sent\r\nforward a strong line of skirmishers to open fire on them, with the view\r\nof ascertaining their temper and disposition after their vanguard had\r\nbeen defeated and driven in. This drew forth a general and continued\r\ndischarge, like that which demoralized troops are apt to indulge in to\r\nkeep up their spirits by their own noise. Seeing this, St. Cyr instantly\r\nprepared to charge, although he had with him but twenty thousand men,\r\nand the Austrians numbered sixty thousand, and were in a strong\r\nposition. The result justified his decision; for, on the near approach\r\nof the French, the Austrians fired a volley or two and then retreated in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n9. Skirmishers should _accompany columns of attack_; for--\r\n\r\n(1.) They increase the confidence of the troops they accompany. Placed\r\nbetween the columns, they advance boldly because the columns advance,\r\nand the columns advance boldly because the skirmishers do.\r\n\r\n(2.) Preceding the columns, by driving back the enemy's skirmishers, and\r\ndiverting his fire to themselves, they keep the attacking columns as\r\nfree from loss as possible till the shock.\r\n\r\nThey, moreover, serve to annoy the troops we are about to attack, by the\r\nincessant sharp buzzing of their deadly bullets among them, like so many\r\nbees, killing some and disabling others; and this, sometimes, to such a\r\ndegree as to demoralize them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, at Waterloo, the swarms of skirmishers that covered the\r\nFrench attacking columns so galled and excited the stationary columns\r\nand squares of some of the Allies, as to nearly drive them from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n(3.) On the flanks of a column, they cover them from attack.\r\n\r\n(4.) They draw the enemy's fire prematurely, and thus render it\r\ncomparatively ineffective.\r\n\r\n(5.) They prevent the columns from halting to deploy and fire.\r\n\r\n(6.) They may sometimes conceal the direction of the march of the\r\nattacking column, and even seize the guns that have been playing on it.\r\n\r\n10. In defence, if they can _encircle the enemy's advancing column_,\r\nthey may destroy it by their concentric fire.\r\n\r\n11. In a retreat, skirmishers _cover the rear_, so long as the enemy\r\nattacks without cavalry.\r\n\r\n12. The NEW RIFLED ARMS have obviously much increased the effectiveness\r\nof skirmishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. HOW POSTED.\r\n\r\n1. They should be always _near enough to the main body to be supported\r\nby it_, if hard pressed, and also to enable the main body to profit at\r\nonce of any advantage that may have been gained by them.\r\n\r\n2. They should _cover the main body_, both in front and in flank, except\r\nwhere the ground may render this impracticable or unnecessary; and, in\r\ndefensive positions, they should occupy every point from which the\r\nenemy's skirmishers might annoy us.\r\n\r\n3. In a defensive combat, they should be so posted as to take the\r\nenemy's attack _in flank_:\r\n\r\n(1.) Because their fire will be thus the more destructive; and--\r\n\r\n(2.) They will not be exposed to be driven back by the enemy's fire, or\r\nby his advance.\r\n\r\n4. If thrown into an enclosure, they must have _an easy exit_.\r\nSkirmishers feeling themselves in danger of being cut off, will lose\r\nsomewhat of that coolness which is so essential to their efficiency.\r\n\r\n5. They should not be kept stationary _behind a straight line_, as a\r\nwall, a fence, or a hedge; for this would expose them to enfilade.\r\n\r\n6. Skirmishers are only auxiliary to the main force, and are not\r\ncapable, by themselves, of effecting any decisive result. Therefore, in\r\norder not to exhaust the men, _heavy_ skirmishing lines should not be\r\nused, except to lead a decided advance, or to repel one.\r\n\r\n7. The principle is, to post skirmishers so as to give them the _maximum\r\nof shelter_, whilst inflicting the _maximum of loss_ on the enemy. This\r\napplies to the placing of the whole line, and to the separate groups.\r\nThe way skirmishers produce their effect is by sharpshooting, which\r\nrequires calmness; and the more completely sheltered they are, the\r\ncalmer they will be, and the more deadly will be their aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. HOW HANDLED.\r\n\r\n1. Deploy them _before coming within range of musketry_; for infantry in\r\ncompact order is a good target for the enemy.\r\n\r\n2. They should be kept _well in hand_; especially at the moment of\r\nsuccess, when they are in danger of rushing headlong to destruction.\r\n\r\n3. Coming upon the enemy's main body, they should _occupy him in front\r\nand flank_ till our own main body gets up.\r\n\r\n4. Except in urgent cases, never deploy a line of skirmishers _on a\r\nrun_; for this makes them lose breath and calmness, and, with their\r\ncalmness, their accuracy of aim.\r\n\r\nSo, after deployment, avoid all rapid and violent movements.\r\n\r\n5. Skirmishers become exhausted after long firing. The longer they\r\ncontinue out, the worse they shoot. Therefore, _relieve them often_.\r\n\r\n6. Skirmishers should be accustomed to _lie down_ at a given signal; as\r\nit is sometimes very important that both our artillery and infantry\r\nshould be able to fire over them.\r\n\r\n7. In retreat, skirmishers occupy every favorable point for _holding the\r\nenemy in check_.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. RULES FOR INDIVIDUAL SKIRMISHERS.\r\n\r\n1. In advancing, in retreat, or at a halt, use _every cover_ that\r\npresents itself.\r\n\r\n2. Preserve _the alignment and the intervals_, so far as possible. On\r\nopen ground, this may be done perfectly. In woods, skirmishers should\r\nnever, for a moment, lose sight of each other.\r\n\r\n3. The security of the _flanks_ should be looked out for by the men near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4. Run over _exposed ground_ as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n5. Approach the _crest of a hill_ with great caution.\r\n\r\n6. If threatened by _artillery alone_, advance and kill off the men and\r\nhorses before they get into battery. When the pieces have got into\r\nbattery, lie down, if on exposed ground, till they limber up again, and\r\nthen recommence the fire.\r\n\r\n7. A skirmisher, with the new rifled arms, ought, at five hundred yards,\r\nto be _more than a match for a gun_; for, in men and horses, he has a\r\nmuch larger target than the gun has in him.\r\n\r\nAgain, with the new rifle shells, he may be able to blow up a caisson.\r\n\r\n8. Neither should a skirmisher have much to fear from a _single\r\nhorseman_. With his bayonet fixed, he would usually be able to defend\r\nhimself successfully against the trooper, whose sabre is the shorter\r\nweapon of the two; more especially, if he will take care to keep on the\r\ntrooper's left, which is his exposed side.\r\n\r\n9. Never lose your calmness. Your power consists, not in rapid firing,\r\nbut in the _accuracy of your aim_. Avoid all hurried and violent\r\nmovements; and never raise your gun till sure of a shot.\r\n\r\n10. The aim, according to the Tactics, is made by bringing the gun down,\r\ninstead of raising it up. However little the soldier may be excited, he\r\nwill be apt to pull the trigger more or less too soon; that is, while\r\nthe muzzle is yet too elevated. This is the reason why infantry missiles\r\nusually _fly too high_. The difficulty would not be obviated by causing\r\nthe aim to be made by raising the piece; for then the same disturbing\r\ncause already mentioned, the soldier's excitement, would make the shots\r\nfly as much too low, as they now fly too high.\r\n\r\nRapid firing is another cause of this incompleteness of aim. Infantry\r\nfiring is already too rapid to be effective; so that what is claimed for\r\nthe new breech-loading weapons as an advantage, that they increase the\r\nrapidity of fire, furnishes, on the contrary, a strong objection to\r\nthem. The effectiveness of the fire of a sharp-shooter, especially, will\r\nbe usually in inverse, instead of direct proportion to the number of\r\nshots he delivers in a given time.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, and of the tendency to pull the trigger before the\r\nmuzzle is sufficiently depressed, it has become an established maxim, to\r\n\r\n   \"Aim low,\r\n   Fire slow\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USE OF ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject will be treated under the following heads:--\r\n\r\n    I.--HOW POSTED WITH RESPECT TO THE GROUND.\r\n   II.--HOW POSTED WITH RESPECT TO OUR OWN TROOPS.\r\n  III.--HOW POSTED WITH RESPECT TO THE ENEMY.\r\n   IV.--POSTING OF BATTERIES AND PIECES AS BETWEEN THEMSELVES.\r\n    V.--HOW USED.\r\n   VI.--ITS FIRE.\r\n  VII.--ITS SUPPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--How posted with respect to the Ground.\r\n\r\n1. Artillery has a much longer range than musketry. In order to avail\r\nourselves of this advantage, we must so post it as to overlook all the\r\nground to which its utmost range extends. It therefore requires _an\r\nelevated position_.\r\n\r\n2. It has been considered an additional advantage of a commanding\r\nposition for artillery, that it enables our guns to cover our infantry,\r\nattacking or attacked, by _firing over their heads_.\r\n\r\nThis was done by the French at Waterloo, apparently with great effect.\r\nBut the advantage is a doubtful one; for firing over our own troops,\r\nespecially with cast-shot or shell, is very dangerous to them, and is\r\napt to intimidate them. It moreover furnishes to the enemy a double\r\ntarget. The shot which miss our troops will be apt to fall among the\r\nguns behind them; and some of those which do not reach the guns, will\r\nprobably take effect among the troops in front of them.\r\n\r\n3. But _very high_ points are unfavorable positions for batteries.\r\nBatteries so placed would not command the ground immediately below them;\r\nas guns cannot be depressed to fire below a certain angle without soon\r\ndestroying their carriages. And this would facilitate their capture;\r\nfor, once arrived on the ground near them, the assailants could not be\r\ninjured by their fire. It has been estimated that the slope in front of\r\na battery should not exceed one perpendicular to fifteen base.\r\n\r\n4. When guns have to be used as a support to other parts of the line,\r\nwhich is often the case, their capture might lead to serious\r\nconsequences. They should therefore have the ground clear of all\r\nobstacles which may _mask their fire_, not only in front, but to their\r\nright and left.\r\n\r\n5. Although the most favorable position for guns is an eminence sloping\r\ngradually towards the enemy, an _open and level plain_ is by no means an\r\nunfavorable one; for, on such ground, the enemy will be visible at a\r\ngreat distance, and our shot may act by ricochet, which causes more\r\ndestruction than ordinary point-blank firing.\r\n\r\nFor ricochet, firm and even ground is requisite; on soft or rough ground\r\nit is not attainable.\r\n\r\n6. In enfilading the enemy's position, or in raking his advancing\r\ncolumns from head to rear, a _grazing fire_ is the most destructive that\r\ncan be used. This consists of a long succession of ricochets at low\r\nheights. Where the ground is level and firm, we can obtain this fire at\r\na short distance from the enemy; as, on such ground, ricochet shots do\r\nnot rise much. But where the ground is uneven, to obtain such a fire, a\r\nmore distant position will be requisite.\r\n\r\n7. _Muddy_ ground is unfavorable for artillery. Over such ground, its\r\ncarriages move slowly, and its fire is less effective. Balls cannot\r\nricochet; and shells often sink into the mud, and thus are either\r\nextinguished or explode with but little effect.\r\n\r\nNapoleon depended so much on his artillery at Waterloo that, although\r\nevery moment was precious, he delayed commencing the battle till his\r\nchief of artillery had reported the ground, which had been covered by a\r\nsoaking rain, to be sufficiently dry for the movements and effectiveness\r\nof that arm. The three hours' delay thus caused, would have sufficed him\r\nto crush Wellington's army before the arrival of the Prussians.\r\n\r\n8. _Stony_ ground is a bad location for a battery; for the enemy's shot\r\nwill scatter the stones around it with more or less fatal effect.\r\n\r\n9. _Rough_ or _uneven_ ground immediately in front of a battery is not\r\nobjectionable, as it will stop the enemy's shot.\r\n\r\n10. A battery, when it is possible to avoid it, should not be posted\r\nwithin musket range of _woods_, _bushes_, _ravines_, _hedges_,\r\n_ditches_, or other cover from which the enemy's sharpshooters might\r\nkill off the gunners, or, by a sudden dash, capture the guns.\r\n\r\n11. To prevent the enemy from approaching a battery under cover, it\r\nshould be so placed as to be able to sweep all _villages_, _hollows_,\r\nand _woods_, in front and in flank.\r\n\r\n12. In taking up a position, a battery should avail itself of all\r\n_inequalities of the ground_, for the shelter of its pieces and gunners,\r\nor of its limbers and caissons, at least.\r\n\r\nFor the same purpose, a battery posted on an eminence should have its\r\npieces some ten paces behind its crest.\r\n\r\n13. Where the ground affords no shelter, and where the position of the\r\nguns is not likely to be changed, it may be worth while to cover them by\r\nan _épaulement_ or breastwork, some three feet, or more, high.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--How posted with respect to our own Troops.\r\n\r\n1. In order to be ready to support the flanks of our attacking columns,\r\nand to aid in the defence in every part of the field, batteries should\r\nbe placed at _several different points_ in the line of battle.\r\n\r\n2. In a defensive battle especially, as it is uncertain on what point\r\nthe enemy will mass his principal attack, the artillery should usually\r\nbe distributed _through the whole line_.\r\n\r\n3. A line of battle has been compared to the _front of a fortification_,\r\nof which the infantry is the curtain, and the artillery batteries the\r\nbastions.\r\n\r\n4. The _lighter_ guns should be placed on the _salient_ points of our\r\nline, from which they can be more easily withdrawn; the heavier guns,\r\nconstituting the stationary batteries, on the more retired points.\r\n\r\n5. Pieces should not be placed _in prolongation with troops_; for this\r\nwould be giving the enemy a double mark. Artillery posted in front of\r\nother troops will draw a fire on them. When a battery must be placed in\r\nfront of the line, let the infantry in rear of it clear the ground by\r\nploying into double columns.\r\n\r\n6. Never place artillery so as to _impede the movements of the other two\r\narms_. A battery posted in front of the centre would often hamper the\r\nmovements of the infantry; besides being peculiarly exposed to a\r\nconverging fire from the enemy's batteries.\r\n\r\n7. The safest position for a battery is on that wing which is most\r\nsecure from a flank attack.\r\n\r\nBut guns should re-enforce the weaker points, thus making the enemy\r\nattack the strongest ones.\r\n\r\nTherefore, _where a wing is weak_, place the largest number of guns\r\nthere, to support it. If we have one wing entirely uncovered, of four\r\nbatteries, for instance, we should give three to the uncovered wing.\r\n\r\n8. Of the heavy batteries, one, at least, should be placed in the first\r\nline, so that we may be able to open an effective fire on the enemy at\r\nthe _earliest possible moment_.\r\n\r\n9. The prompt use, at the proper moment, of the reserve, may decide the\r\nbattle. The movements of heavy artillery, therefore, are too slow for\r\nthe reserve, which should have most of the light pieces. _Horse\r\nartillery_ is especially suitable for it.\r\n\r\n10. Guns near an infantry square should be posted at its _angles_. If\r\nthe square is charged by cavalry, the gunners run into the square, after\r\nfilling their ammunition pouches, which they take in with them, as well\r\nas their sponges and other equipments. The limbers and caissons are sent\r\nto the rear; or, if there is no time to do this, they may be brought\r\ninto the square. If this is impossible, they may be formed into a\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo, on the French cavalry's retiring from their charges on the\r\nenemy's squares, the British gunners rushed out from the squares in\r\nwhich they had taken refuge, and plied their guns on the retiring\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--How posted with respect to the Enemy.\r\n\r\n1. If the enemy's batteries are concentrated in one position, by placing\r\nour own batteries properly we may obtain a powerful _cross-fire_ on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. It is always advantageous to so dispose our batteries as to take\r\nthose of the enemy _in enfilade_, or obliquely (_en écharpe_, as it is\r\ncalled).\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Murfreesboro', in December, 1862, a rebel battery,\r\nbeing taken in enfilade by one of our own, was silenced in about five\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n3. So, also, if we can obtain an oblique or enfilading fire _on his\r\ntroops_, it will be very destructive. A flanking battery, raking the\r\nenemy's position, is often enough, of itself, to decide a battle.\r\n\r\nThus, the battle of Chippewa was finally decided by our getting a gun or\r\ntwo in a flanking position, enabling us to enfilade the British line.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Shiloh, the rebels' triumphant advance on the\r\nevening of the first day was effectually checked by the fire of our\r\ngun-boats Tyler and Lexington, which had taken an enfilading position\r\nopposite their right flank.\r\n\r\n4. For this reason, we must never post one of our own batteries so that\r\nthe enemy's guns will take it _obliquely_, or _in flank_; unless,\r\nindeed, by doing so, we may probably obtain some important and decisive\r\neffect before it can be destroyed, or made unserviceable.\r\n\r\n5. Batteries should be so placed as to _command the whole ground in our\r\nfront_, even almost up to our bayonets, and so as to be able to direct\r\ntheir fire towards every point; at all events, so that a fire can be\r\nkept up on the enemy till he is within short musket-range.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the best position for a battery, to enable it to\r\neffectually cover the entire ground in our front, would not be in our\r\nline of battle, but in advance of one of its flanks, from which it could\r\ntake the enemy's troops advancing over it, in enfilade.\r\n\r\n6. Artillery fire from _an unexpected quarter_ always has a powerful\r\nmoral effect. Two guns, even, hoisted up to a place where the enemy does\r\nnot dream of there being any, may have a decisive effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Posting of Batteries and of Pieces as between themselves.\r\n\r\n1. The best mode of posting batteries is in the form of a crescent, its\r\nhorns pointing towards the enemy, or forming the sides of a re-entering\r\nangle; for this gives a _convergent fire_ to the enemy's divergent one.\r\n\r\nIts inconvenience is, the exposure of its flanks to attack, or to\r\nenfilade. Therefore, when such a position is adopted, its flanks must be\r\nprotected by natural obstacles or by artificial defences.\r\n\r\n2. Batteries, or parts of batteries, should be at _supporting distances_\r\nfrom each other; that is, not over six hundred yards apart, so as to\r\neffectually cover the whole ground between them, in case of need, with\r\ngrape and canister. When rifled guns are used, this distance may be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n3. _A long line of guns_ in our line of battle is objectionable; for, if\r\nit should become necessary to withdraw them, they would leave a\r\ndangerous interval.\r\n\r\n4. It is dangerous to collect _a great many pieces in one battery_,\r\nespecially in the beginning of an action, when the enemy is fresh, for\r\nit strongly tempts him to capture it. When used, such a battery should\r\nhave powerful supports to protect it, or should be sheltered by a\r\nvillage, a defile, or other cover, occupied beforehand.\r\n\r\n5. Although, to be used offensively, guns should be in strong masses, in\r\norder to strike a decisive blow on some single point; this is by no\r\nmeans the case when _used defensively_; for,\r\n\r\n(1.) It is only when guns are more or less scattered over different\r\nparts of the field, that they can be made to give a cross-fire on the\r\nenemy's advancing columns, or on any part of his line.\r\n\r\n(2.) If the position where they are massed does not happen to be\r\nattacked, they become useless, while stripping the rest of the line.\r\n\r\n(3.) If they are captured, all the artillery is lost at once, as\r\nhappened to the Austrians at the battle of Leuthen, causing their\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n6. A certain number of pieces of horse-artillery must always be _kept in\r\nreserve_, so that, if an artillery fire at any point should be suddenly\r\nwanted, it may be furnished with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\n7. Guns of _various calibres_ should never be in the same battery, to\r\nprevent confusion as to the respective ranges, and in the supply of\r\ntheir ammunition.\r\n\r\n8. An independent section or battery should never consist of _howitzers\r\nalone_, for the proper fire of these pieces is too slow to be effective\r\nin repulsing an attack on them.\r\n\r\n9. There should always be _wide intervals_ between the pieces; otherwise\r\nthe battery would offer too good a mark to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--How used.\r\n\r\nFirst, GENERALLY.\r\nSecondly, IN OFFENSIVE COMBAT.\r\nThirdly, IN DEFENSIVE COMBAT.\r\nFourthly, AGAINST INFANTRY.\r\nFifthly, AGAINST CAVALRY.\r\nLastly, AGAINST ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n1. So far as is possible, guns should be kept _hidden from the enemy_\r\ntill the moment of opening on him. They may be masked by the ground, or\r\nother cover, natural or artificial, or by troops placed in front of\r\nthem. The surprise will add much to their effect. Moreover, concealed,\r\nthey will be less exposed to be taken. Nothing discourages troops more\r\nthan the loss of a battery at the beginning of an action.\r\n\r\n2. A desultory and indiscriminate artillery fire will accomplish\r\nnothing. To effect any thing important, it must be _concentrated on some\r\nobject_; and the fire must be persevered in till the desired effect has\r\nbeen produced.\r\n\r\n3. It is a general principle that artillery should not reply to the\r\nenemy's batteries, unless compelled to by their effect on our own\r\ntroops. To obtain the most decisive effects from artillery fire, it\r\nshould be directed _on the enemy's troops_, instead of his guns.\r\n\r\n4. If it should become advisable to silence one of his batteries, it\r\nwill be done more promptly and effectually by the employment, for this\r\npurpose, of _two_ of our own batteries, than of a single one.\r\n\r\n5. There is usually great advantage in keeping our batteries constantly\r\n_shifting their position_; for then--\r\n\r\n(1.) They have the effect of a surprise, by opening on the enemy at\r\nsome unexpected point.\r\n\r\n(2.) They make the enemy believe our guns to be more numerous than they\r\nreally are.\r\n\r\n(3.) They are in less danger of being captured.\r\n\r\nBut these changes of position are attended with this inconvenience, that\r\nthey expose the horses to be taken in flank by the enemy's batteries and\r\nsharpshooters.\r\n\r\n6. The movements of a battery in the field should be _as rapid as\r\npossible_; for, while moving, it is helpless and exposed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, celerity of movement and accuracy of fire will often more than\r\ncompensate for inferiority in the number of guns; as was the case at the\r\nbattle of Palo Alto, in the Mexican War, where the enemy's guns\r\noutnumbered ours two to one.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. IN OFFENSIVE COMBAT.\r\n\r\n1. When used to _prepare for an attack_ of infantry or cavalry,\r\nartillery concentrates as much fire as possible on the point where the\r\nattack is to be made, in order to overcome the resistance there, and\r\nthus make success easy.\r\n\r\n2. When there are several points on which our fire should be directed,\r\nwe must not batter them all at once, but concentrate our whole fire on\r\nthem _in succession_.\r\n\r\n3. In attack, artillery should _not be split up_ among different\r\nbrigades or divisions; else no decisive result can be expected from it.\r\nWhole batteries, used together, will have a more telling effect than if\r\nscattered over the field in separate sections.\r\n\r\nIn no case should less than two pieces be used together; for, while one\r\npiece is being loaded, the piece and its gunners need the protection of\r\nanother one ready to be discharged.\r\n\r\n4. Pieces in support of an infantry column of attack should never be in\r\nits rear, but _on its flanks_, near its head, in which position it will\r\nbest encourage the infantry. But if a battery have already a position\r\nfrom which it can afford to the attack effective assistance, it should\r\nremain in it; sending a few pieces to accompany the infantry, which\r\nalways greatly values artillery support.\r\n\r\n5. Powerful effects may be produced by the _sudden assemblage of a great\r\nnumber of guns_ on some particular point. This was a favorite\r\nmanoeuvre of Napoleon; who, by his rapid concentration of immense\r\nbatteries of light artillery on the important point, usually obtained\r\nthe most decisive results. At Wagram, for instance, when Macdonald's\r\ncolumn was ready to make its great charge on the Austrian centre,\r\nNapoleon suddenly massed one hundred guns in front of his own centre,\r\nand made it advance in double column at a trot, then deploy into line on\r\nthe leading section, and concentrate its fire on the villages forming\r\nthe keys to the enemy's position, in front of his right and left wings\r\nrespectively; each battery opening its fire on arriving at half-range\r\ndistance. The effect was overwhelming.\r\n\r\n6. The _nearer_ artillery delivers its fire, the more powerful, of\r\ncourse, are its effects. Horse artillery, in sufficient strength,\r\nattacking the enemy at short grape-shot distance, say within three\r\nhundred or four hundred yards, may lose half its pieces, but with the\r\nother half it will probably decide the battle at that point.\r\n\r\nAt Palo Alto, Duncan's rapid closing with his guns to less than half\r\nrange, drove back the Mexican right wing, which could not stand the\r\ndestructive fire.\r\n\r\n7. _Horse artillery_ does not usually attempt to follow up cavalry in\r\nits attack; but takes a position to cover its retreat, if repulsed, or\r\nto push forward in support, in case of success.\r\n\r\n8. When cavalry has to _debouch from a defile_, horse artillery may\r\nrender it most effectual assistance, by taking a position that will\r\nenable the cavalry to form without fear of being charged and destroyed\r\nwhile forming.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. IN DEFENSIVE COMBAT.\r\n\r\n1. Artillery should always reserve its fire till the enemy's _real\r\nattack_.\r\n\r\n2. It should play on that portion of the hostile force that _threatens\r\nus most_.\r\n\r\n3. It should wait till the enemy has come within _destructive distance_,\r\nand then open on his columns with a concentrated fire.\r\n\r\n4. It should protect our troops _while manoeuvring_, and accompany\r\nthem in retreat.\r\n\r\n5. We must _subdivide our batteries_ whenever we wish to obtain\r\ncross-fires on a _débouché_, or on the head of an advancing column, or\r\non the ground in front of a weak part of our line. By so doing, we\r\ncompel the enemy to divide his own artillery in order to reply to our\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n6. A _sudden concentration_ of a great number of guns at some particular\r\npoint may be used with the same decisive effect in a defensive, as in\r\nan offensive battle; though in this case, artillery plays, for the time\r\nbeing, a part strictly offensive.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Friedland, where the French were attacked by the\r\nRussians in overwhelming numbers, Ney's corps was driven back by a\r\nterrific concentrated fire, in front and in flank, from the Russian\r\nbatteries on the opposite side of the river; its own artillery being too\r\nfeeble to stand before them. Seeing this, Napoleon instantly ordered all\r\nthe guns of the different divisions of the corps next to Ney's, on the\r\nleft, to be united and thrown in one mass in front of Ney's corps.\r\nTaking post at some hundred paces in front, these batteries, by their\r\npowerful fire, soon silenced the Russian batteries; then advancing on\r\nthe Russian troops that had crossed the river to within grape-shot\r\nrange, they made frightful havoc in their deep masses. The French\r\ninfantry, profiting by this, rushed forward and captured the village of\r\nFriedland, driving the enemy in their front over the bridges, which they\r\nthen burned. This was decisive of the battle; for the whole Russian army\r\nwas then driven into the river.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Kunersdorff, in 1759, after Frederick's left and\r\ncentre had driven the Russians, and captured seventy guns and many\r\nprisoners, Soltikoff promptly massed the whole artillery of his right\r\nwing at a single point behind a ravine, which, by its concentrated fire,\r\nswept away the flower of the Prussian army in their efforts to force its\r\npassage; and Frederick was badly defeated.\r\n\r\n7. When compelled to retreat, guns should _retire successively_, in\r\nechelons of batteries, half-batteries, or sections, in order that the\r\nfire of one may cover the limbering up and retreat of another.\r\n\r\nBesides the mutual support thereby afforded, these successive\r\nface-abouts of artillery have a powerful moral effect on the pursuing\r\nenemy, already more or less disorganized by success.\r\n\r\nIt would be well for some pieces in each echelon to be kept loaded with\r\ncanister, so as to drive the enemy back if he should press very close.\r\n\r\n8. The protection afforded by artillery in retreat is very powerful, as\r\nit keeps the enemy constantly _at a distance_.\r\n\r\nA fine example of the use of it for this purpose occurred just before\r\nthe battle of Pea Ridge, in March, 1862. A rear-guard of six hundred\r\nmen, under General Sigel, was retreating before a force of four\r\nregiments of infantry and cavalry, that followed and attacked it on\r\nevery side. Sigel disposed his guns in echelons, the one of which\r\nnearest the enemy played on his attacking squadrons with grape and\r\nshell, which suddenly checked them. Instantly profiting by their\r\ntemporary hesitation, the echelon limbered up and galloped away to\r\nanother position, while the next echelon, again checking the enemy by\r\nits fire, followed its example. By this means, Sigel, cutting his way\r\nthrough a vastly superior force, succeeded, after a retreat of ten\r\nmiles, in rejoining the main body with but trifling loss.\r\n\r\n9. If driven to the last extremity, the gunners should try, at least, to\r\n_save the horses_, and to blow up the caissons they have to abandon.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of La Rothière, in 1814, where Napoleon, with thirty-two\r\nthousand men, was overwhelmed by one hundred thousand Allies, and was\r\nobliged to leave fifty guns on the field, he succeeded in bringing off\r\nall his gunners and horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. AGAINST INFANTRY.\r\n\r\n1. It is an important rule that artillery should play on the enemy's\r\n_troops_, without attending to his batteries, except in urgent cases.\r\n\r\n2. Against a _deployed line_, whether marching by the front or by a\r\nflank, case-shot, that is, grape, canister, and spherical case\r\n(sometimes called _shrapnel_), are most suitable; as these all scatter,\r\nright and left, to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe best effect of canister is within two hundred yards. Beyond three\r\nhundred and fifty yards, it should not be used.\r\n\r\nThe best effect of grape is within four hundred yards. Over six hundred\r\nyards, it is not very effective.\r\n\r\nSpherical case is effective at much greater distances, its range being\r\nnearly equal to that of solid shot.\r\n\r\nAgainst a line of infantry at a greater distance than six hundred yards,\r\nspherical case should be used, chiefly, if not exclusively; as being\r\nmore likely to be effective than ball.\r\n\r\n3. But case-shot are _unsuitable against a column_, as they consist of a\r\nnumber of small balls which have not momentum enough to penetrate into\r\nit to any depth. When the enemy advances in columns, solid shot should\r\nplough through them from head to rear, a cross-fire being obtained upon\r\nthem when possible.\r\n\r\n4. Especially should _round-shot_ be used against a close column rushing\r\nto attack us through a defile. Grape and canister might sweep down the\r\nleading ranks, but the mass of the column sees not the destructive\r\neffect; and being carried forward by the pressure of the ranks behind,\r\ncontinues to rush on till the battery is carried, though with more or\r\nless loss.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Seven Pines, on one occasion, when the rebels were\r\nadvancing in close columns, they were plied with grape and canister from\r\ntwo of our batteries with but little effect. Every discharge made wide\r\ngaps in their leading ranks, but these were instantly filled again, and\r\nthe columns pressed on.\r\n\r\nA round-shot, on the other hand, comes shrieking and tearing its way\r\nthrough the entire column, carrying destruction to the very rear-most\r\nranks. The hesitation produced is not limited to the leading ranks, but\r\nextends throughout the column. Thus both the actual and the moral effect\r\nof ball on a close column is much superior to that of grape or canister.\r\n\r\nAt the bridge of Lodi, the Austrian gunners plied the French column\r\nwith grape. If they had used round-shot instead, it is doubtful whether\r\nBonaparte would have succeeded in carrying the bridge.\r\n\r\n5. But a direct fire with ball on the head of a column of attack would\r\nbe much assisted by the fire of a few light pieces taking it _in flank_.\r\nAnd, for this fire in flank, case-shot would be powerfully effective;\r\nfor, from their wide scattering, both their actual and their moral\r\neffects would extend through the whole column, from front to rear.\r\n\r\n6. A battery with _guns enough to keep up a continuous fire_ has little\r\nto fear from an open attack on it by infantry alone. Napoleon observed\r\nthat no infantry, without artillery, can march one thousand yards on a\r\nbattery of sixteen guns, well directed and served; for, before clearing\r\ntwo-thirds of the way, they will have been all killed, wounded, or\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nThis remark was made in reference to smooth-bore guns; the new rifled\r\nguns should be still more destructive.\r\n\r\n7. _Against skirmishers_, as they offer but a poor mark for ball, grape\r\nand canister should alone be used.\r\n\r\nE. AGAINST CAVALRY.\r\n\r\n1. The ground round a battery should be so obstructed as to _prevent the\r\nenemy's cavalry from closing on it_; but in the case of a light battery,\r\nintended for manoeuvre, so far only as this can be done without\r\nimpeding the movements of the battery itself.\r\n\r\n2. On being threatened by cavalry, a light battery may sometimes\r\npromptly change its position to one where the cavalry would attack it\r\n_at great disadvantage_. For instance, if posted on an eminence, and\r\ncavalry should attempt to carry it by charging up the slope, instead of\r\nawaiting the charge in a position which would allow the cavalry to\r\nrecover breath, and form on the height, it might run its pieces forward\r\nto the very brow of the slope, where the cavalry, having lost their\r\nimpetus, and with their horses blown, would be nearly helpless and\r\neasily repulsed.\r\n\r\n3. At a distance, the most effective fire on cavalry is with\r\n_howitzers_, on account of the terror and confusion caused among the\r\nhorses by the bursting of the shells.\r\n\r\nOn the cavalry's flanks, when within four hundred or five hundred\r\nyards, the fire with grape would be most effective.\r\n\r\n4. The _last discharge_ should be of canister alone, and made by all the\r\npieces at once, when the battery should be swiftly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n5. If the cavalry succeed in reaching the pieces before their\r\nwithdrawal, the gunners may find temporary refuge _under the carriages_.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. AGAINST ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n1. As guns in the field should generally play on troops instead of\r\nbatteries, there should be a _reserve of horse artillery_ to take the\r\nenemy's batteries in flank, in case of need, as well as for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n2. Though the ordinary use of artillery is against infantry and cavalry\r\nonly, special circumstances may render it expedient that a certain\r\nportion of it should _respond to the enemy's batteries_. In this case,\r\nnot over one-third should be used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n3. When we have _guns in abundance_, it might be sometimes advisable, by\r\nusing several batteries at once, to silence the enemy's guns, before\r\nbeginning to play on his troops.\r\n\r\n4. Artillery properly plays on the enemy's _guns_--\r\n\r\n(1.) At the moment of their coming into action, for then they are so\r\nexposed that our fire will be peculiarly effective, and perhaps to such\r\na degree as to prevent their opening on us.\r\n\r\n(2.) When our troops move forward to attack, in order to draw away from\r\nthem the fire of the enemy's batteries, or, at least, to render it\r\nunsteady, inaccurate, and ineffective; and\r\n\r\n(3.) Generally, when his guns are causing us very great damage.\r\n\r\n5. _Against guns_, solid shot or shells only should be used, since they\r\nalone are capable of inflicting any serious injury on either guns or\r\ntheir carriages: solid shot, by their great weight and momentum; shells,\r\nby their bursting.\r\n\r\nBut within three hundred or four hundred yards, grape and canister would\r\nsoon destroy the gunners and the horses.\r\n\r\n6. Our fire on a hostile battery would not only be very effective when\r\nit is coming into action, but at all other times _when its flanks are\r\nexposed_; as in limbering up to move off, or in a flank march. On these\r\noccasions we should use grape, if near enough; otherwise, spherical case\r\nwould be generally the best.\r\n\r\n7. When possible to avoid it, _a field battery should not be opposed to\r\na battery of position_, or, generally, a battery of light guns to one\r\nof heavy guns. For even when the numbers of pieces on the two sides are\r\nequal, the enemy's superiority in range and in weight of metal would\r\ngive him such advantage in the duel that our own battery would soon be\r\ndestroyed or silenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Its Fire.\r\n\r\n1. It is important not to commence the fire till our guns are in _sure\r\nrange_--\r\n\r\n(1.) Because a harmless fire serves but to embolden the enemy and\r\ndiscourage our own troops.\r\n\r\n(2.) Because artillery ammunition should never be wasted. The fate of a\r\nbattle will sometimes depend on there being a sufficient supply of it at\r\na particular moment.\r\n\r\n2. The usual maximum distances at which smooth-bore field guns may open\r\nfire _with any considerable effect_, are--\r\n\r\n   For 12-pounders     1100 yards.\r\n   For 6    \"           750   \"\r\n\r\nWhat these distances are in respect to rifled guns, it does not appear\r\nto be yet definitively settled. The extreme range of the new rifled\r\nsix-pounders is said to be three thousand yards; of the twelve-pounders,\r\nfour thousand five hundred yards.\r\n\r\n3. Guns are usually fired _by order_, and not by salvos, or volleys; and\r\nnever as soon as loaded, unless delay be dangerous. Artillery fire is\r\nformidable only in proportion to its accuracy; and this is attainable\r\nonly by a cool and calculated aim.\r\n\r\n4. Artillery fire should never cease _through the whole line at once_.\r\nThis would have a discouraging effect on our own troops, and an\r\ninspiriting one on the enemy's. Especially must this not be done when we\r\nare about to execute any manoeuvre; for it would be sure to call the\r\nenemy's attention to it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if a particular battery has to change its position, it must\r\nnot cease the fire of all its pieces at once; for, besides its\r\ndisquieting effect on our troops, it would notify the enemy of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n5. In _covering an attack_, our guns should keep up their fire till the\r\nmoment it would begin to endanger our advancing columns.\r\n\r\n6. By a _ricochet_ fire, artillery is said to increase its effect, from\r\none-fourth to one-half. It is especially effective in enfilading a line\r\nof troops, a battery, or the face of a work taken in flank.\r\n\r\nRicochet shots have also great moral effect.\r\n\r\n7. When used against _breastworks of rails or logs of wood_, guns should\r\nbe fired with moderate or shattering charges; so as more surely to\r\ndemolish them, and, at the same time, to increase the destructive effect\r\nof the fire by scattering the splinters.\r\n\r\nIn view of the frequent necessity of battering such defences, and of\r\nusing a ricochet fire, which also requires small charges of powder, it\r\nwould be an improvement in our artillery service to make a certain\r\nproportion of the ammunition in each gun limber to consist of cartridges\r\nof half the usual size.\r\n\r\n8. In _bombarding a village_ during a battle, if our object be to set\r\nfire to and destroy it, this will be best accomplished with shells. If\r\nwe wish merely to drive the enemy from it, solid shot from heavy\r\ncalibres will be necessary, which will more surely reach and destroy his\r\ntroops, wherever they may show themselves.\r\n\r\n9. The _moral effect_, both of solid shot and of shells, is much greater\r\nthan that of grape or other case-shot, from their more fearful effects\r\non the human frame, and from the great number of men that a single ball\r\nor shell will kill or fatally wound. One twelve-pound solid shot has\r\nbeen known to kill forty-two men, who happened to be exactly in its\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n10. _Ball and shell_ should be used--\r\n\r\n(1.) When the enemy is at a distance.\r\n(2.) When he is in mass.\r\n(3.) When he is in several lines.\r\n(4.) When his line may be enfiladed.\r\n\r\n11. In _silencing a battery_, our fire should be concentrated on one\r\npiece at a time, while some of our guns throw spherical case, from a\r\nraking position, if possible, on the gunners.\r\n\r\n12. Though grape has a much less range than ball, yet _within four\r\nhundred yards_, on account of its scattering, its effect is superior to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe fire of guns double shotted with ball and a stand of grape, is\r\nfearfully destructive when used at a short distance to repel a charge.\r\n\r\n13. It is artillerymen's point of honor _not to abandon their pieces\r\ntill the last extremity_. They should always remember that when the\r\nenemy is closing on them, the last discharge will be the most\r\ndestructive of all, and may suffice to repulse the attack and turn the\r\ntide of battle.\r\n\r\nIn our attack on Quebec, in our War of Independence, on the near\r\napproach of our assaulting column, the British gunners fled from their\r\npieces; but the one who fled last, before leaving, discharged his gun,\r\nwhich was loaded with grape. The discharge killed and wounded several of\r\nour men; among them the brave General Montgomery, who was leading the\r\ncolumn in person. The effect was decisive. The assailants fell back,\r\npanic-struck at the loss of their commander; and our attack failed.\r\n\r\n14. To prevent our own captured pieces from being turned on us by the\r\nenemy, it is the artillerymen's last duty, when it has become evident\r\nthat the guns cannot be saved, to _spike_ them. The operation requiring\r\nbut a few moments, it can rarely be omitted without disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Its Supports.\r\n\r\n1. Artillery must always be protected from the _mêlée_, in which it is\r\nhelpless whether against infantry or cavalry; and should therefore have\r\na strong _support_.\r\n\r\n2. A portion, at least, of every artillery support, should consist of\r\n_sharpshooters_, whose fire will be the most effective in driving off\r\nskirmishers sent forward to threaten or attack the guns, or to pick off\r\nthe gunners.\r\n\r\n3. Batteries must be secured _on both flanks_, and their supports will\r\nbe posted with that view; on one or on both flanks, according to\r\ncircumstances, and more or less retired.\r\n\r\n4. A support should never be directly _in rear_ of the battery, where it\r\nwould be in danger, not only of receiving the shots aimed at the\r\nbattery, but also of killing the gunners belonging to it, as has\r\nrepeatedly happened during the late war.\r\n\r\n5. A battery and its support owe each other _mutual protection_.\r\nTherefore, when an infantry support, after holding the enemy in check,\r\nto enable the battery to limber up and retire, is obliged, in its turn,\r\nto retreat, the battery should take such a position as will enable it to\r\ncover the retreat by its fire.\r\n\r\n6. A battery consisting of any considerable number of pieces may be\r\nable, sometimes, to _dispense with a support_.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of Uclès, in Spain, in 1809, the French artillery,\r\nunder General Senarmont, had been left behind, owing to the badness of\r\nthe roads. The Spaniards came down upon it in large force. On their\r\napproach, the guns were formed in square, and, by their fire on every\r\nside, defended themselves successfully, and finally repulsed the enemy.\r\n\r\nSo, at Leipsic, in 1813, when the grand battery of the Guard, which had\r\nbeen left temporarily without a support, was charged by the Russian\r\nhussars and Cossacks, Drouot, its commander, rapidly drew back its\r\nflanks till they nearly met; and the cavalry were soon repulsed by its\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n7. At the battle of Hanau, in 1813, Drouot's eighty guns were charged by\r\nthe Allied cavalry. Having no supports, he placed his gunners in front\r\nof them with their carbines. This checked the cavalry, who were then\r\ncovered with grape, which drove them back to their lines.\r\n\r\nOught not our gunners also to have _carbines slung on their backs_ for\r\nsuch emergencies? Against infantry, our guns would often need no other\r\nsupport. The carbines could be used to reply to the enemy's skirmishers;\r\nand the example just cited shows that, thus equipped, artillerymen may\r\nsometimes successfully defend their pieces even against cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USE OF CAVALRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall consider--\r\n\r\n   I.--ITS FORMATIONS.\r\n  II.--ITS STRONG AND ITS WEAK POINTS.\r\n III.--HOW IT IS POSTED.\r\n  IV.--ITS SUPPORTS.\r\n   V.--HOW IT IS USED.\r\n  VI.--HOW IT FIGHTS.\r\n VII.--ITS CHARGE.\r\nVIII.--ITS ATTACK ON INFANTRY.\r\n\r\nAnd shall conclude with some--\r\n\r\nIX.--GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Its Formations.\r\n\r\n1. The _formations_ of cavalry for battle are either--\r\n\r\n(1.) In deployed lines.\r\n(2.) Lines of regiments, in columns of attack doubled on the centre.\r\n(3.) A mixed formation of lines and columns.\r\n(4.) Echelons of lines or columns; or--\r\n(5.) Deep columns.\r\n\r\n2. _Deployed lines_ are not objectionable in principle. They are often\r\nnot advisable; but are sometimes necessary.\r\n\r\nBut long, continuous lines should always be avoided; being unfavorable\r\nto rapid manoeuvring, which cavalry is constantly called upon to\r\nexecute in the field.\r\n\r\n3. Cavalry has, in its horses, an unreasoning element, which is not\r\ncontrollable, like men; and is therefore much more easily thrown into\r\ndisorder than infantry. For this reason, when deployed, it should always\r\nbe _in two lines_; the second behind the first; the first line deployed,\r\nand the second in columns of squadrons by platoons. There should be also\r\na reserve at a few hundred paces behind the second line.\r\n\r\nThe second line should be near enough to the first to be able to support\r\nit, if checked; but not so near as to partake in its disorder, if\r\nrepulsed.\r\n\r\n4. Cavalry should be always _in column_ when expecting to manoeuvre,\r\nor to be called on to make any rapid movement; this being the formation\r\nbest adapted for celerity.\r\n\r\n5. Cavalry deploys _in lines_--\r\n\r\n(1.) When preparing for a charge in line.\r\n\r\n(2.) When preparing for any attack requiring the utmost possible width\r\nof front; as where the enemy is to be suddenly surrounded.\r\n\r\n(3.) When it becomes necessary in order to prevent our troops from being\r\noutflanked by the enemy's.\r\n\r\n(4.) When exposed to continued artillery fire, which is much less\r\ndestructive on a line than on a column.\r\n\r\n6. Cavalry should always present _a front at least equal to the\r\nenemy's_; otherwise, its flank, which is cavalry's weak point, will be\r\nexposed to attack. When inferior in numbers, we may extend our line by\r\nleaving intervals, more or less wide, between its different corps. Any\r\nhostile squadrons that may attempt to pass through these intervals to\r\ntake the line in rear, could be taken care of by the second line.\r\n\r\n7. The best formation in respect to _mobility_ is a line of regiments in\r\ncolumns by squadrons, doubled on the centre; corresponding to infantry\r\ndouble columns.\r\n\r\n8. The _mixed formation_ of lines and columns is more manageable than\r\nsimple lines. Which of these two is preferable depends upon the ground,\r\nand upon all the other circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n9. The order _in echelons_ is as good in attack as in retreat; since the\r\nechelons mutually support each other.\r\n\r\n10. Decidedly the most objectionable of all cavalry formations is that\r\nin _deep columns_:\r\n\r\n(1.) From the almost entire loss which it involves of its sabres, which\r\nare cavalry's peculiar and most effective weapon.\r\n\r\n(2.) From the long flanks which it exposes to attack.\r\n\r\n11. The formation in _one rank_, instead of two, has been introduced by\r\nthe new Cavalry Tactics, though it has been as yet but partially adopted\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nThis innovation has two advantages. It doubles the number of sabres to\r\nbe used against the enemy; and it enables the cavalry to cover double\r\nthe ground; thus doubling, also, its power to outflank, which is a\r\nvaluable advantage, especially when opposed to cavalry.\r\n\r\nIts disadvantage is, that it must, more or less seriously, impair the\r\nsolidity and vigor of the cavalry charge proper; in which a whole line,\r\nwith \"boot to boot\" compactness, comes at once to the shock, like some\r\nterrific mechanical engine; and in which the riders in the front rank\r\nare compelled to dash on with full speed to the last; knowing that if\r\nthey slacken rein, even for a moment, they would be ridden over by the\r\nrear-rank men one yard behind them. From there being no rear-rank to\r\nfill up the gaps caused, during the charge, by the enemy's missiles, or\r\nby casualties occasioned by obstacles of the ground, the charging line\r\nmust generally arrive on the enemy broken and disunited, or as foragers.\r\nThe moral effect of such a charge on our own men will be unfavorable, as\r\nthey will not realize the certainty of mutual support at the critical\r\nmoment; and its moral effect on the enemy must be decidedly inferior to\r\nthat produced by a charge that is at once swift, solid, and compact.\r\n\r\nBut the force of this objection is somewhat weakened, by the\r\nconsideration that the compact charge of \"cavalry of the line\" must\r\nhereafter be comparatively rare, in consequence of the introduction of\r\nrifled artillery and infantry weapons, with their greatly increased\r\naccuracy and range; which ought to cause such slaughter in a line or\r\ncolumn of charging cavalry, that, if it arrive at all to the shock, it\r\nwould generally be only in scattered groups.\r\n\r\n12. In advancing over wooded, or other obstructed ground, it may be\r\nnecessary to break the line into _company columns of fours_, as in the\r\ninfantry manoeuvre of advancing by the flanks of companies.\r\n\r\nAs the cavalry column of fours corresponds to the march of infantry by\r\nthe flank, the use of this formation in action is open to the same\r\nobjections that have been already pointed out as applying to flank\r\nmarches by infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Its Strong and its Weak Points.\r\n\r\n1. The value of cavalry on the battle-field consists chiefly in its\r\nvelocity and mobility. Its strength is in the _sabre-point and spurs_.\r\n\r\n2. Its charge is accompanied with a _powerful moral effect_, especially\r\nupon inexperienced troops. But,\r\n\r\n3. Cavalry has but _little solidity_, and cannot defend a position\r\nagainst good infantry. For, if it remain passive on the ground it is to\r\nhold, the infantry will soon destroy it by its fire, to which it cannot,\r\nwith any effect, reply; and if it attack at close quarters, the\r\ninfantry, by means of its defensive formations, will be able, at least,\r\nto hold its ground, and probably repulse its charges by a reserved\r\nfire. So that the cavalry will finally have no alternative but to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n4. It is exposed and helpless _during a change of formation_; like\r\nartillery limbering up, or coming into action.\r\n\r\n5. _On its flanks_, it is the weakest of all arms. A single squadron\r\nattacking it suddenly in flank, will break and rout cavalry of ten times\r\nits number.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of the Pyramids, Napoleon kept a few squadrons in rear of\r\neither flank, which, on his line being charged by a formidable body of\r\nMamelukes, vastly superior to his own cavalry in numbers, horses, and\r\nequipments, nevertheless suddenly fell on their flanks and destroyed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6. Cavalry is never so weak as directly _after a successful charge_;\r\nbeing then exhausted, and in more or less disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--How Posted.\r\n\r\n1. A part of our cavalry must be so posted as to _secure our flanks_;\r\nremaining in column behind the wings, till the enemy's movements require\r\nits deployment.\r\n\r\nIf one wing is covered by natural obstacles, give the cavalry to the\r\nuncovered wing; posting it in rear of the flank battalion of the second\r\nline.\r\n\r\n2. When cavalry is posted on the flanks, it should _not usually be on\r\nthe first line of infantry_. If it is to be used for attack, it is\r\nbetter to keep it retired from view till the last moment, in order to\r\nstrengthen its attack by the powerful moral effect of a surprise. And,\r\nused defensively, it will be best posted on the flanks of the second\r\nline; since, in advancing to charge, it must have a clear space in its\r\nfront of at least two hundred or three hundred yards, to enable it to\r\nact with freedom and vigor.\r\n\r\n3. But if a position can be found for cavalry in front, where it would\r\nnot be too much exposed, this may sometimes enable it to exercise an\r\nimportant moral effect, by _threatening the flank_ of such of the\r\nenemy's troops as may be sent forward to attack.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Leipsic, in 1813, the Wurtemburg cavalry was launched\r\nagainst Blucher's Prussian cavalry. But, seeing the Prussians drawn up\r\nnot only in front, but opposite their flank, they lost confidence,\r\ncharged feebly, and too late. They were consequently repulsed and\r\ndriven back on the Marine Battalion, which they threw into confusion.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Prairie Grove, in December, 1862, the First Iowa\r\nCavalry, which was held in reserve, by its mere presence, caused every\r\nattempt of the rebels' flanking regiments to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n4. In order not to impede the manoeuvres of the infantry, cavalry\r\nshould not _fill intervals_ in the lines, or be placed between the\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous when the ground is such as to require the cavalry in the\r\ncentre of the first line; for, if it is beaten, a gap is left through\r\nwhich the enemy may penetrate. At the battle of Blenheim, in 1704,\r\nMarlborough owed his victory, in great measure, to the Allies' forcing\r\nback the cavalry forming the centre of the French army; thus turning the\r\nwhole of its right wing, and compelling the infantry posted at Blenheim\r\nto surrender.\r\n\r\n5. Yet cavalry should always be near enough to the infantry to take\r\nimmediate part in the combat; and although it should not be posted in\r\nthe intervals between infantry corps, it may _debouch through them_, in\r\norder to attack more promptly.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Friedland, the Russian cavalry charged a French\r\ninfantry division. Latour Maubourg's dragoons and the Dutch cuirassiers,\r\nriding through the battalion intervals, charged the Russians in turn,\r\nand drove them back on their infantry, throwing many of them into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n6. When _both wings are uncovered_, the best place for the cavalry will\r\nusually be in rear of the centre of the second line; whence it can be\r\nsent in the shortest time to either wing.\r\n\r\n7. Cavalry should not be _scattered over the field_ in small\r\ndetachments, but be kept massed at one or more suitable points; as\r\nbehind the centre, or behind one wing, or both wings. A small cavalry\r\nforce should be kept entire; or it will have very little chance of\r\neffecting any thing whatever.\r\n\r\nCavalry of the line, to produce its decisive effects, must be used in\r\nheavy masses. In the beginning of the Napoleonic wars, the French\r\ncavalry was distributed among the divisions. Napoleon's subsequent\r\nexperience led him to give it more concentration, by uniting in one mass\r\nall the cavalry belonging to each army corps; and, finally, these masses\r\nwere again concentrated into independent cavalry corps; leaving to each\r\narmy corps only cavalry enough to guard it.\r\n\r\n8. For tactical operations in the field, cavalry insufficient in number\r\nis _scarcely better than none at all_, as it can never show itself in\r\npresence of the enemy's cavalry, which would immediately outflank and\r\ndestroy it, and must keep close behind its infantry.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Napoleon's campaign of 1813, he had but very little\r\ncavalry to oppose to the overwhelming masses of this arm possessed by\r\nthe Allies. In consequence of this, he could make no use of it whatever;\r\nand the tactical results of the battles of Lutzen and Bautzen were far\r\ninferior to those habitually obtained in his former victories, and were\r\npurchased with much greater loss.\r\n\r\n9. Small bodies of cavalry threatened by the enemy's cavalry in greatly\r\nsuperior force, may sometimes be saved by taking refuge _in an infantry\r\nsquare_, as practised by Napoleon at the battle of the Pyramids.\r\n\r\n10. Cavalry should _remain masked_ as long as possible; for it produces\r\nmost effect when its position and movements are hidden, so that a strong\r\nforce may suddenly be brought upon a weak point.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, a flat, open country is less favorable for this arm\r\nthan plains with undulations, hills with gentle slopes, woods,\r\nvillages, and farms; all these being so many facilities for screening\r\ncavalry from view.\r\n\r\n11. Cavalry should never be brought to the front, _except to engage_. It\r\nis unfortunate when the ground is such as to prevent this; for cavalry,\r\ncompelled to remain inactive under fire, is in great danger of becoming\r\ndemoralized.\r\n\r\n12. As to the _ground_:\r\n\r\n(1.) Cavalry must not rest its flank on a wood, a village, or other\r\ncover for an enemy, till it has been occupied by our own troops. If\r\ncompelled to do so, it should send out patrols to reconnoitre and\r\nobserve. Its position is no longer tenable from the moment the enemy\r\nappears within striking distance on its flank.\r\n\r\n(2.) It must not be posted on the very ground it is to defend, but in\r\nrear of it; as it acts effectively only by its charge.\r\n\r\nAttacking cavalry must have favorable ground in front; defending\r\ncavalry, in rear. An obstacle in either case may be fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Its Supports.\r\n\r\n1. The flanks of cavalry lines or columns are always exposed. They\r\nshould, therefore, be protected by _supports_ of light cavalry, which\r\ncan act promptly and swiftly. When behind a line, these supports should\r\nbe usually in open column, so as to be able to wheel, without a moment's\r\ndelay, into line.\r\n\r\n2. The _most effectual_ mode of protecting the flank of a line or column\r\nof cavalry is by means of squadrons in rear, formed in echelons\r\nextending outwards; as this exposes the enemy's cavalry that may attempt\r\nto charge the main body in flank to be immediately charged in flank\r\nthemselves; which would be destruction. For this purpose, irregular\r\ncavalry may be as effective as any other.\r\n\r\n3. This cavalry support or reserve behind the flanks may sometimes play\r\n_an important offensive_ part. The enemy's first line, the instant after\r\neither making or receiving a charge, is always in greater or less\r\ndisorder; and a vigorous charge then made on it in flank by our own\r\nflank reserve, would have a decisive effect.\r\n\r\n4. Cavalry should never engage without a support or _reserve in rear_,\r\nnot only to guard its flanks, but also to support it when disorganized\r\nby a successful charge.\r\n\r\n5. So, when engaged in _skirmishing order_, being then very much\r\nexposed, it must always be protected, like infantry skirmishers, by\r\nsupports in close order.\r\n\r\n6. It has been already seen that, although cavalry may carry a position,\r\nit cannot hold it, if attacked by infantry. When used for such a\r\npurpose, therefore, it should always be accompanied by _an infantry\r\nsupport_.\r\n\r\nThe French cavalry succeeded in carrying the plateau of Quatre Bras;\r\nbut, having no infantry with it to reply to the terrible fire of the\r\nAllied infantry from the surrounding houses, it was compelled to retire,\r\nand yield it again to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wellington, Napoleon frequently used his cavalry in seizing\r\npositions, which were then immediately occupied by infantry or\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--How Used.\r\n\r\n1. Cavalry generally manoeuvres _at a trot_. At a gallop, disorder is\r\napt to take place, and exhaustion of strength that will be needed in the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n2. The ordinary use of cavalry is to follow up infantry attacks and\r\ncomplete their success. It should never be sent _against fresh\r\ninfantry_; and should generally, therefore, be reserved until towards\r\nthe last of the action.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who, by concentrating his cavalry into considerable masses,\r\nhad enabled himself to use it on the battle-field as a principal arm,\r\nsometimes produced great effects by heavy cavalry charges at the very\r\nbeginning of the action.\r\n\r\nBut, though Napoleon's splendidly trained heavy cavalry might sometimes\r\nbreak a well-disciplined infantry without any preparatory artillery\r\nfire, it would be dangerous to attempt this with cavalry inferior to it\r\nin solidity; and the new rifled weapons would seem to render the cavalry\r\ncharges of his day no longer practicable.\r\n\r\n3. Cavalry _may_ be hurled against the enemy's infantry--\r\n\r\n(1.) When it has been a long time engaged, and therefore exhausted.\r\n\r\n(2.) When it has been shattered by artillery.\r\n\r\nAnd _always should_ be--\r\n\r\n(1.) When it is manoeuvring.\r\n\r\n(2.) When the attack would be a surprise.\r\n\r\n(3.) When its ranks begin to waver, or when it manifests any unequivocal\r\nsymptom of hesitation or intimidation.\r\n\r\nIn the three latter cases, success will usually be certain; in the two\r\nformer ones, quite probable: but, in most other cases, a cavalry charge\r\nwill succeed, perhaps, only one time in ten.\r\n\r\n4. The chief duties of cavalry in a _defensive_ battle are--\r\n\r\n(1.) To watch the enemy's cavalry, to prevent its surprising our\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\n(2.) To guard our troops from being outflanked.\r\n\r\n(3.) To defend our infantry and artillery while manoeuvring.\r\n\r\n(4.) To be ready to charge the enemy the instant his attack on our\r\ntroops is repulsed.\r\n\r\n5. _Used offensively_, it must promptly attack--\r\n\r\n(1.) The enemy's flanks, if uncovered.\r\n\r\n(2.) His infantry, when, from any cause, its attack would probably\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n(3.) All detachments thrown forward without support.\r\n\r\n6. When cavalry has routed cavalry, the victorious squadrons should at\r\nonce charge in flank _the infantry protected by the cavalry just\r\nbeaten_. The great Condé, when only twenty-two years of age, by this\r\nmeans, won the victory of Rocroi.\r\n\r\n7. Deployed as skirmishers, by their noise, dust, and smoke, cavalry may\r\nfurnish a good _screen_ for our movements.\r\n\r\n8. Cavalry skirmishers _scout their corps_, to prevent the enemy\r\nreconnoitring it too closely.\r\n\r\n9. When a cavalry rear-guard has to defend, temporarily, a defile, a\r\nbridge, or a barricade, a part should _dismount_, and use their carbines\r\ntill the rest are safe.\r\n\r\nSo, a cavalry vanguard, by its fire, dismounted, may prevent the enemy\r\nfrom destroying a bridge.\r\n\r\nIn these, and in similar cases, the cavalrymen should habitually\r\ndismount, in order to render their fire effective; acting and\r\nmanoeuvring as skirmishers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--How it Fights.\r\n\r\n1. The success of cavalry in battle depends on the _impetuosity of its\r\ncharge_, and its _use of the sabre_. When deployed as skirmishers,\r\nmounted or dismounted, its proper weapon is the carbine or pistol; and\r\nin individual combats, these weapons may occasionally be very useful.\r\nBut when acting as cavalry proper, in any compact formation, it must\r\nrely on the sabre. The aim with a pistol or carbine in the hands of a\r\nmounted man is so unsteady, that the fire of a line of cavalry is\r\ngenerally ineffective; and there are few occasions where it should be\r\nresorted to. When cavalry has learned to realize that these are not its\r\ntrue arms, and that it is never really formidable but when it closes\r\nwith the enemy at full speed and with uplifted sabre, it has acquired\r\nthe most important element of its efficiency.\r\n\r\n2. Cavalry should, therefore, not fight _in columns_, as most of its\r\nsabres would thereby become useless. But if a facing about to retreat is\r\nfeared, an attack in column would prevent it. It is said, also, that a\r\ncolumn is more imposing than a line. If so, it might have a greater\r\nmoral effect on the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. When cavalry are deployed as skirmishers, as a curtain to hide our\r\nmovements, they should be _in considerable number_, with small\r\nintervals, and should make as much noise, and smoke, and dust as\r\npossible. When the charge is sounded, the skirmishers wait and fall in\r\nwith the rest.\r\n\r\n4. The great rule in cavalry combats is to _cover our own flanks_, and\r\n_gain the enemy's_; for these are his and our weakest points.\r\n\r\n5. When the enemy's cavalry is already in full charge on our infantry,\r\nit is too late for our cavalry to charge it with much prospect of\r\nsuccess. In such a case, it would be better to defer our own charge till\r\nthe moment that the enemy's _is completed_; for our success then would\r\nbe certain.\r\n\r\n6. Cavalry attacks cavalry _in line_, in order to have the more sabres,\r\nand, if possible, to outflank the enemy.\r\n\r\n7. If we can manoeuvre so as to attack the enemy's cavalry _in flank_,\r\nour success will be certain.\r\n\r\nMilitary history affords hundreds of instances in proof of this\r\nproposition. At one of the battles in Spain, for example, in 1809,\r\nfifteen hundred French horse, by charging four thousand Spanish cavalry\r\nin flank, completely cut it in pieces.\r\n\r\n8. Cavalry _never waits in position_ to be charged by cavalry. Its only\r\nsafety is in meeting the charge with a violent gallop; it would\r\notherwise be sure to be overthrown.\r\n\r\nWhen hostile cavalries thus meet each other, there is usually but small\r\nloss on either side. A certain number of troopers are usually\r\ndismounted; but the colliding masses somehow ride through each other,\r\nallowing but little time for the exchange of points and cuts.\r\n\r\nThus cavalry can defend itself against cavalry only by attacking; which\r\nit must do even when inferior to the enemy in number.\r\n\r\n9. To attack artillery, cavalry should be in _three detachments_;\r\none-fourth to seize the guns; one-half to charge the supports; and the\r\nother fourth as a reserve.\r\n\r\nThe first party attacks in dispersed order, as foragers, trying to gain\r\nthe flanks of the battery. The second party should manoeuvre to gain\r\nthe flanks of the supports.\r\n\r\n10. Where a cavalry attack can be masked, so as to operate _as a\r\nsurprise_, a battery may be taken by charging it in front. The\r\nformidable Spanish battery in the Pass of Somosierra, was finally\r\ncarried by a dash of Napoleon's Polish Lancers upon it, suddenly\r\nprofiting of a temporary fog or mist. But, in ordinary cases, when\r\ncavalry has to charge a battery in front, its fire should be drawn by\r\nour own guns or infantry, immediately before the charge begins.\r\n\r\n11. In an attack on an _intrenchment_, the office of cavalry can rarely\r\nbe any thing else than to repulse sorties from the work, and to cut off\r\nthe enemy's retreat from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Its Charge.\r\n\r\n1. As cavalry acts effectively on the field of battle only by its\r\ncharge, good cavalry of the line can be formed in no other way than by\r\nbeing _exercised in this_, its special and peculiar function.\r\n\r\nOn taking command of the Army of Italy in 1796, Bonaparte found the\r\nFrench cavalry to be entirely worthless. They had never been accustomed\r\nto charge, and he had the greatest difficulty in making them engage.\r\nSeeing the great importance of this arm, he determined to make good\r\ncavalry of them by compelling them to fight. So, in his attack on\r\nBorghetto, he sent his cavalry forward, with his grenadiers on their\r\nflanks, and his artillery close behind them. Thus enclosed, and led on\r\nby Murat to the charge, they attacked and routed that famous Austrian\r\ncavalry whose superiority they had so much dreaded. This was the first\r\nstep in the formation of the splendid French cavalry to which Napoleon\r\nafterwards owed so many of his victories. And, at the battle of\r\nHochstedt, on the Danube, in 1801, its superiority over the Austrian\r\ncavalry was, at last, completely established.\r\n\r\n2. Cavalry _charges_--\r\n\r\n(1.) In line; but this only on even ground, and at short distances;\r\n\r\n(2.) In column; and\r\n\r\n(3.) As foragers, or in dispersed order. But this kind of charge is\r\nexceptional. It can rarely be used with safety against any but an\r\nuncivilized or an undisciplined foe.\r\n\r\n3. A charge in _one long continuous line_ should never be attempted.\r\nSuch a charge will be usually indecisive, as it cannot be made with the\r\nnecessary _ensemble_ or unity. The success of a charge in line depends\r\non the preservation of a well-regulated speed and of a perfect\r\nalignment; by means of which the whole line reaches the enemy at once.\r\nAt the charging gait, this is rarely attainable; so that the charge in\r\nline, except at short distances, and over very even ground, usually\r\ndegenerates into a charge by groups, or individual troopers, arriving\r\nsuccessively. The most dashing riders, or those mounted on the swiftest\r\nhorses, will naturally arrive first, and be overpowered by numbers.\r\n\r\n4. A charge _in deep column_ is also objectionable; its long flank\r\nexposing it too much to artillery fire and to the enemy's cavalry.\r\n\r\nBut when cavalry is surprised, it must charge at once, in whatever order\r\nit happens to be, rather than hesitate or attempt to manoeuvre, for\r\nthis would expose it to destruction.\r\n\r\n5. A prompt and unhesitating obedience to the command to charge, without\r\nregard to the circumstances under which it is given, may sometimes lead\r\nto results _unexpected even to the charging troops themselves_.\r\n\r\nOne instance of this was related to me by an old officer of Napoleon's\r\nfavorite Fifth Cuirassiers. The regiment was on the left of the line of\r\nbattle. Directly in front of it was an extensive marsh; beyond which\r\nrose an eminence, abrupt in front, but sloping gently towards the rear,\r\nthe crest of which was crowned by formidable Austrian batteries. For two\r\nhours the cuirassiers had been standing in line, listening to the roar\r\nof battle on the right, and eagerly expecting a summons to go\r\n_somewhere_ to engage the enemy. The very horses were neighing and\r\npawing the ground, in their impatience to be off. Just then galloped up\r\none of the Emperor's aids, saying, \"Colonel, the Emperor desires you to\r\ncharge directly on the enemy's batteries opposite your position.\" The\r\nbrave colonel, who was one of Napoleon's personal favorites, though\r\nchafing at the prolonged inaction of his command, pointed to the marsh,\r\nand requested the officer to inform the Emperor of the obstacle in his\r\nfront, with the existence of which his majesty, he said, was probably\r\nunacquainted. In a few minutes the officer came riding furiously back\r\nwith a message to the colonel, that \"if he did not immediately charge,\r\nthe Emperor would come and lead the regiment himself.\" Stung by this\r\nreproof, the colonel plunged his spurs into his horse's flanks, and\r\ngiving the command \"Forward,\" led his regiment, at full gallop, directly\r\nthrough the marsh upon the point that had been indicated.\r\n\r\nThe charge itself was, of course, a failure. The regiment finally\r\nstruggled its way through the marsh to the opposite side, but leaving\r\nbehind it a large number of gallant officers and men, who had sunk to\r\nrise no more; my informant being of the number who escaped.\r\n\r\nBut the result of this demonstration was most decisive. Seeing that the\r\nheight on which the Austrians had planted their heavy batteries, and\r\nwhich commanded the entire ground, was the key of the battle, Napoleon\r\nhad determined to wrest it from them, together with the batteries which\r\ncrowned it. Accordingly, the evening before, he had dispatched a body of\r\nlight infantry by a very circuitous route, to turn the position and\r\nattack the batteries in rear. He had accurately calculated the time the\r\ndetachment would require to reach its destination; and when the moment\r\narrived at which it should be ready to commence its attack, he ordered\r\nthe cuirassiers to charge directly upon the position in front. The\r\nAustrian artillery, suddenly attacked in rear, and, at the same time,\r\nthreatened with a cavalry charge in front, where it had deemed itself\r\nperfectly secure, tried to change the position of its pieces, so as to\r\nget a fire on its assailants from both directions. But it was too late;\r\nthe temporary confusion into which it was thrown enabled the French\r\ninfantry to carry all before it, and the height was won, with all its\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nSo, at Waterloo, Sir Hussey Vivian's brigade of Light Cavalry, which was\r\nmarching in column by half squadrons, left in front, had begun to form\r\nup into line on the leading half squadron, when an order arrived from\r\nWellington to charge. Instantly the charge was made, and, of course, in\r\nechelons of half squadrons, extending to the right. The effect of this\r\nwas that a body of French cavalry on its right, then attacking the\r\nBritish line, was suddenly taken in flank and completely routed.\r\n\r\n6. A charge in deep column may sometimes be made necessary by _the\r\nnature of the ground_, which, at the same time, protects its long\r\nflanks: as where, in our pursuit of the rebels after the battle of\r\nNashville, in 1864, the Fourth United States Cavalry, approaching them\r\nover a narrow turnpike, made a vigorous charge in column of fours, which\r\nbroke their centre, and, with the help of infantry skirmishers on the\r\nflanks, drove them from the ground.\r\n\r\n7. When the ground is rugged, in order to lessen the number of falls,\r\nthe rear-rank, in the charge, should _open out six paces_, closing up\r\nagain at the last moment.\r\n\r\n8. Cavalry advances to charge at a _trot_, or at a _gallop_. A fast trot\r\nis better than a gallop, as alignments are not easily kept at great\r\nspeed. Experience has shown that the best distance from the enemy to\r\nbegin the gallop, is about two hundred and sixty yards; thence steadily\r\nincreasing to the maximum of speed. This gradual increase of speed is\r\nvery important, to prevent the horses from being completely blown on\r\nreaching the enemy.\r\n\r\n9. Cavalry should not charge by _a wood_, till it has been carried by\r\nour own infantry, if it can possibly be avoided.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Kollin, in 1756, Frederick's cavalry, pursuing the\r\nAustrians, was taken in flank by some Austrian infantry posted in a\r\nwood, and made to retire with great loss.\r\n\r\n10. When cavalry is required to charge over unknown ground, it should be\r\npreceded by a few men thrown out to the front as skirmishers, in order\r\nto _scout the ground_ to be passed over. The neglect of this precaution\r\nhas sometimes led to great disaster.\r\n\r\nAt Talavera, two cavalry regiments, the First German Hussars and the\r\nTwenty-third Light Dragoons, were ordered to charge the head of some\r\nFrench infantry columns. When near the top of their speed they came\r\nsuddenly upon a deep ravine, with steep sides. Colonel Arentschild\r\ncommanding the Hussars, who was in front, at once reined up, and halted\r\nhis regiment, saying: \"I vill not kill my young mensch!\" But the other\r\nregiment, commanded by Colonel Seymour, which was on its left, not\r\nseeing the obstacle in time, plunged down it, men and horses rolling\r\nover on each other in frightful confusion. Of the survivors, who\r\narrived on the other side by twos and threes, many were killed or\r\ntaken; and only one-half of the regiment ever returned.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Courtrai, in 1302, from the French cavalry's\r\nomitting to scout the ground they charged over, the Flemings won a great\r\nvictory. All the _élite_ of the French nobility and chivalry was\r\ndestroyed, and gold spurs were collected by bushels on the field. It was\r\nthe French Cannæ. The Flemings were drawn up behind a canal, flowing\r\nbetween high banks, and hidden from view. The French rushing on at full\r\ngallop, all the leading ranks were plunged into the canal. The entire\r\ncavalry was thereby checked and thrown into irretrievable disorder,\r\nwhich extended to the infantry, in their rear. The Flemings, profiting\r\nby their confusion, crossed the canal at two points simultaneously,\r\nattacked them in flank, and completed their rout.\r\n\r\nSo, at the battle of Leipsic, in 1813, Murat, in his great cavalry\r\ncharge on the Allied centre, had captured twenty-six guns, and was\r\ncarrying all before him, when he pushed on to the village of Gulden\r\nGossa, where the ground had not been reconnoitred, and could not be\r\ndistinctly seen from a distance. Here the French found their career\r\nsuddenly checked by a great hollow, full of buildings, pools of water,\r\nand clusters of trees; while the Allied infantry, from behind the\r\nvarious covers afforded by the ground, opened upon them a destructive\r\nfire. Being then suddenly charged in flank by the Russian cavalry, they\r\nwere driven back with heavy loss; the Allies recapturing twenty of the\r\ntwenty-six guns they had lost.\r\n\r\nThe troopers employed to scout the ground before a charge would not be\r\nin much danger from the enemy, who would hardly fire on a horseman or\r\ntwo, especially when expecting a charge.\r\n\r\n11. Cavalry must never pursue, unless its supports are _close at hand_.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing, it must be circumspect, and not go too far. Union and order\r\nare indispensable; for, without them, a slight resistance may suffice to\r\ncause a repulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Its Attack on Infantry.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to its ATTACK GENERALLY.\r\nSecondly, its attack ON SQUARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n1. Cavalry must avoid _distant engagements_ with infantry; in which the\r\nlatter must always have the advantage.\r\n\r\n2. The slightest cavalry charge on the _flank_ of infantry will rout it.\r\n\r\n3. As to a cavalry attack _in front_: If the infantry stand firm, the\r\nchances are against its success. If the infantry cannot be attacked in\r\nflank, the cavalry should therefore wait till it has been shattered by\r\nartillery, or has become exhausted, or demoralized, or till it begins to\r\nmanoeuvre.\r\n\r\n4. If the infantry be _in line_, or _in column_, cavalry should attack\r\nit in flank; if _in square_, at one of its angles; if _in several\r\nsquares_, at one of its flank ones, so as to avoid a cross-fire from the\r\nother squares. If a flank square be broken, the next one to it, being no\r\nlonger protected by the fire of any other square, may be attacked with\r\nthe same prospect of success; and so on successively.\r\n\r\n5. But if the hostile infantry have _supporting cavalry_, we must not\r\ncharge in such a manner as to enable it to take us in flank.\r\n\r\n6. To _test the infantry_ about to be attacked, cavalry may pass a few\r\nhundred paces in its front, to threaten it, sending forward a few\r\nhorsemen to fire, gallop forward, and raise a dust. If the infantry,\r\ninstead of disregarding these movements, begin to fire, it will probably\r\nbe broken, on the cavalry's charging it at once and vigorously, whether\r\nin column or in line. But otherwise, if the infantry reserve its fire,\r\nand only sends out a few sharpshooters.\r\n\r\n7. _Ascending slopes_, if not too steep, are not unfavorable to attacks\r\non infantry; for their shots, as experience shows, will then mostly fly\r\ntoo high.\r\n\r\n8. On a _descending slope_, cavalry charges down on infantry with\r\nterrible effect; as it then arrives with an impetus which nothing can\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo, a column of French infantry was ascending a steep slope.\r\nSuddenly the Scotch Greys cavalry regiment dashed down upon it from\r\nabove, rode over, and destroyed it.\r\n\r\nB. ON SQUARES.\r\n\r\n1. Infantry squares are usually charged in _open column_; the distance\r\nbetween the subdivisions being a subdivision front and a few yards over;\r\nin order that each subdivision may have time to break into the square,\r\nor, if unsuccessful, to disengage itself and retire.\r\n\r\nBut the distances should never be so great as to allow the square to\r\nreload after firing a volley at the next preceding subdivision.\r\n\r\n2. The leading subdivision will usually _draw the fire_ of the square.\r\nIf this is delivered at very short range, say at twenty paces, it will\r\nraise up a rampart of dead and wounded men and horses which will\r\nprobably suffice to check the following subdivisions, and so repulse the\r\ncharge. But an infantry square rarely reserves its fire so long; and if\r\nthe fire is delivered at any considerable distance, no such effect will\r\nbe produced.\r\n\r\n3. A _good formation_ to attack a square is said to be a column of three\r\nsquadrons, with squadron front, at double distance; followed by a fourth\r\nsquadron, in column of divisions or platoons, to surround the square,\r\nand make prisoners, if it is broken.\r\n\r\n4. Before cavalry charges a square, it should be first shattered or\r\ndemoralized by _artillery fire_, when this is practicable. In the\r\nabsence of artillery, sharpshooting infantry skirmishers may, to a\r\ncertain extent, supply its place.\r\n\r\n5. A square should be attacked at one of its angles, which are obviously\r\nits weakest and most vulnerable points. But to cover a real attack on an\r\nangle, cavalry sometimes makes a _false attack_ on the front of a\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n6. When squares are formed checkerwise, cavalry must attack _a flank\r\nsquare_, and not expose itself to a cross-fire by charging an interior\r\none.\r\n\r\n7. Cavalry charging a square firing irregularly will usually break it.\r\nBut when the square reserves its fire, and pours in well-aimed volleys\r\nat short range, the charge will rarely succeed. The cavalry should,\r\ntherefore, before charging, use every effort to _draw the fire_ of the\r\nsquare, or of the fronts which threaten it. This is sometimes\r\naccomplished by sending forward a few skirmishers to fire on the square.\r\n\r\n8. When one square fires to assist another, the firing square should be\r\n_instantly charged_, before it has time to reload.\r\n\r\n9. To succeed, a cavalry charge should be made with a _desperate,\r\nforlorn-hope recklessness_, and with reiterated attacks on one point. If\r\nthe fire has been delivered at very close range, though its effect has\r\nprobably been destructive, the smoke will momentarily shut out the line\r\nof infantry from the horses' view, thus removing the chief obstacle to\r\ntheir breaking through it. The survivors of the fire should therefore\r\nrush desperately on.\r\n\r\nIf the French attacks on the British squares at Quatre Bras had been\r\nmade in this manner, instead of opening to the right and left, and\r\ndiverging to a flank at the moment of closing, they would probably have\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nBut this sudden divergence is often the fault of the horses, which\r\ninstinctively recoil before a serried line of infantry, with bayonets at\r\nthe charge. Cavalry should, therefore, never be practised on the\r\ndrill-ground in charging a square, as the horses would thereby acquire\r\nthe habit of suddenly checking their course, or of diverging to a flank,\r\non arriving at the enemy. This would so strengthen their natural\r\ninstinct that they could never be got to break a square. Or, at least,\r\nwhen this manoeuvre is practised for the purpose of instruction, the\r\nhorses used should never afterwards be taken into the field.\r\n\r\n10. The cavalry most formidable to an infantry square are _Lancers_.\r\nTheir lances, which are from eleven to sixteen feet long, easily reach\r\nand transfix the infantry soldier, while the sabres of the other cavalry\r\nare too short to reach him over the horse's neck, and over the musket,\r\nlengthened by the bayonet. But Lancers are usually no match against\r\nother cavalry, who can parry and ripost before the lance can resume the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n11. When cavalry has succeeded in completely breaking a body of\r\ninfantry, it may often inflict _fearful slaughter_ upon them.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Rio Seco, in Spain, after Lasalle's twelve hundred\r\nhorse had broken the Spanish infantry, they galloped at will among\r\ntwenty-five thousand soldiers, some five thousand of whom they slew.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--General Remarks.\r\n\r\n1. Besides its uses on the field of battle, cavalry may render most\r\nimportant service in completing the destruction of beaten corps, or\r\ncompelling their surrender, and so enable us to secure the great\r\nstrategic objects of the campaign. Thus, after the battle of Waterloo,\r\nit was the Prussian cavalry that completed the dispersion of the French\r\narmy, and prevented it from rallying. And, but for Napoleon's ill\r\nfortune in respect to Grouchy, in that battle, he would, to all\r\nappearance, have succeeded in accomplishing his plan of campaign, which\r\nwas, to separate the English from the Prussians, beat them in detail,\r\nand complete their destruction with his twenty thousand cavalry.\r\n\r\n2. The battles of the late War of the Rebellion, the earlier ones, at\r\nleast, were mostly indecisive. One chief cause of this was, that neither\r\nside had a sufficient force of true cavalry to enable it to complete a\r\nvictory, to turn a defeat into a rout, and drive the enemy effectually\r\nfrom the field. The cavalry charges were generally such as mounted\r\ninfantry could have just as well made; charges in which the pistol and\r\ncarbine played the principal part, instead of the spur and sabre. It was\r\nnot until the fight at Brandy Station, in June, 1863, that sabres were\r\nused, to any extent, at close quarters. Thus, neither of the contending\r\narmies was able to break up and disperse, destroy, or capture its\r\nenemy's infantry masses, in the manner practised in Napoleon's great\r\nwars, not having, to any considerable extent, that description of force\r\ncalled Cavalry of the Line, which alone is capable of effecting these\r\nresults by its solid and compact formations, its skilful, yet rapid\r\nmanoeuvring, and its crashing charges.\r\n\r\n3. European cavalry of the line is divided into Heavy and Light. Heavy\r\ncavalry is heavily armed; that is, their weapons are larger and heavier\r\nthan those of light cavalry, and to these weapons, carbines, in most of\r\nthe corps, are added. Some of the corps wear steel or brass cuirasses;\r\nand the men and horses are of the largest size.\r\n\r\nIn Light cavalry, the only weapons are the sabre and pistol; and the men\r\nand horses are light and active, rather than strong and large.\r\n\r\nLancers are considered a medium between Heavy and Light cavalry.\r\n\r\n4. Great as may be the advantages of a large force of regular cavalry of\r\nthe line, there were serious objections to its being raised at the\r\nopening of the late war.\r\n\r\n(1.) The theatre of war presented nowhere any of those wide and level\r\nplains so common in Europe, and on which cavalry masses are able to\r\nproduce such decisive effects in battle. On the contrary, the ground was\r\nalmost everywhere so rugged and mountainous, or else so densely wooded,\r\nas to be extremely unfavorable to the movements of cavalry of this\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n(2.) Since the introduction of the new rifled arms, exposing cavalry\r\nmasses to a deadly fire at far greater distances than ever before known,\r\na fire often reaching to the reserves, it seemed doubtful whether the\r\nmanoeuvring and charging in heavy, compact masses, which formerly\r\nrendered cavalry of the line so formidable, would any longer be\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n(3.) The comparative cost of this kind of force is so great, that, if it\r\nhad been raised and kept up on the scale required, the expense of this\r\nwar, enormous as it has been, would have been vastly augmented. Three\r\nyears are required for the thorough training and instruction of the men\r\nand horses; so that it would not have been until the fourth year of the\r\nwar that we could begin, even, to reap the fruits of so enormous an\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\n5. But to carry on any war successfully, what is needed, and is, in\r\nfact, indispensable, is an ample force of light cavalry, of a kind\r\nrequiring comparatively but little time and training to fit it for the\r\nvarious and important duties devolving upon it in the field, and\r\ntherefore far less expensive than cavalry of the line; and having all\r\nthe discipline of this latter kind of force, though wanting its\r\nperfection of manoeuvre. Every army, or considerable detachment, must\r\nhave enough of this kind of force with it to furnish what is requisite\r\nfor Outpost duty, Patrols offensive and defensive, Escorts to trains,\r\nForaging parties, Reconnoissances, and the various other purposes\r\nnecessarily incidental to operations in the field; and in marches, all\r\nAdvanced, Rear, and Flank guards should consist, in part, at least, of\r\ncavalry. Finally, this description of force is needed for the\r\nperformance of those arduous, but most valuable, services often rendered\r\nby the quasi-independent bodies called Partisan Corps; services usually\r\nrequiring great celerity of movement.\r\n\r\n6. This kind of force being \"the eyes and ears of an army,\" it often\r\ncontributes powerfully to the success of strategic operations.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1813, Napoleon complained that, for want of light\r\ncavalry, he could get no intelligence of the enemy's movements.\r\n\r\nSo, in the rebel campaign of 1863, culminating at Gettysburg, General\r\nLee attributed his ignorance of our position and movements, which led to\r\nthe failure of his operations, to his being destitute of this arm;\r\nStuart's cavalry, on which he depended for information, having got too\r\nfar away from him.\r\n\r\nIn Pope's campaign in 1862, the rebels, by their cavalry raid on\r\nCatlett's Station, obtained possession of the commanding general's\r\ncorrespondence, plans, and orders from Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, whilst keeping us informed of the enemy's movements,\r\nan abundant light cavalry, active and well commanded, may be so used as\r\nto constitute an impenetrable screen of our own movements from the\r\nenemy, as effectual as would be a lofty and impassable mountain range.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we are greatly inferior to the enemy in cavalry, our own\r\ncavalry will have to keep itself within our infantry lines; and the\r\nconsequence will be that the enemy will obtain control of the entire\r\ncountry around us, and so deprive us of all the supplies it contains.\r\n\r\nAs, besides this, cavalry is absolutely necessary for the protection of\r\nconvoys, and, from its celerity of movement, is the kind of force best\r\nfitted for guarding our communications, it is evident that the\r\nsubsistence of an army is dependent, to a great extent, upon this arm.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in relation to the three arms, it is evident--\r\n\r\n1. That ARTILLERY, within the range of its fire, is powerful in\r\npreventing the enemy's approach to it; but, only to a limited extent,\r\ncan pursue and drive the enemy from his position; and that its function\r\nis, therefore, mainly DEFENSIVE.\r\n\r\n2. That CAVALRY, by the impetuosity of its charge, is peculiarly fit for\r\ndriving the enemy from his position; but, remaining in position itself,\r\nhas but feeble power to prevent the enemy's approaching it; and this,\r\nonly by its carbine and pistol fire, which is far from effective; and\r\nthat its function is, therefore, mainly OFFENSIVE.\r\n\r\n3. That INFANTRY has great power, both in keeping the enemy at a\r\ndistance by its fire and in driving him from his position with the\r\nbayonet; and that this arm is, therefore, both OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE.\r\n\r\n4. That although artillery is mainly a defensive arm, it plays an\r\nimportant offensive part in the powerful assistance it renders to\r\ninfantry, in shattering and disorganizing the enemy's masses; thereby\r\nopening the way for our attacking columns.\r\n\r\n5. That although cavalry is mainly an offensive arm, its defensive value\r\nis also very great in the protection it affords, in various emergencies,\r\nto the other arms, by its actual charge, or by its threatening position.\r\n\r\nThe special parts usually played in battle by the three arms\r\nrespectively, may be briefly stated thus:--\r\n\r\nArtillery prepares the victory; Infantry achieves it; Cavalry completes\r\nit, and secures its fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
