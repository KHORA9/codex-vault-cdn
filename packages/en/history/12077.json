Possibly I have become partially Latinized as the result\r\nof some eighteen years of residence in the Philippines. At all events\r\nit is my purpose to state at the outset facts which will tend to\r\nmake clear my view point and at the same time briefly to outline the\r\nsubject-matter which I hereinafter discuss.\r\n\r\nAs a boy I went through several of the successive stages of collector's\r\nfever from which the young commonly suffer. First it was postage\r\nstamps; then birds' nests, obtained during the winter season when no\r\nlonger of use to their builders. Later I was allowed to collect eggs,\r\nand finally the birds themselves. At one time my great ambition was to\r\nbecome a taxidermist. My family did not actively oppose this desire\r\nbut suggested that a few preliminary years in school and college\r\nmight prove useful.\r\n\r\nI eventually lost my ambition to be a taxidermist but did not lose my\r\ninterest in zoölogy and botany. While a student at the University of\r\nMichigan I specialized in these subjects. I was fortunate in having\r\nas one of my instructors Professor Joseph B. Steere, then at the\r\nhead of the Department of Zoölogy. Professor Steere, who had been a\r\ngreat traveller, at times entertained his classes with wonderfully\r\ninteresting tales of adventure on the Amazon and in the Andes, Peru,\r\nFormosa, the Philippines and the Dutch Moluccas. My ambition was\r\nfired by his stories and when in the spring of 1886 he announced his\r\nintention of returning to the Philippines the following year to take\r\nup and prosecute anew zoölogical work which he had begun there in\r\n1874, offering to take with him a limited number of his students who\r\nwere to have the benefit of his knowledge of Spanish and of his wide\r\nexperience as a traveller and collector, and were in turn to allow him\r\nto work up their collections after their return to the United States,\r\nI made up my mind to go.\r\n\r\nI was then endeavouring to get through the University on an allowance\r\nof $375 per year and was in consequence not overburdened with surplus\r\nfunds. I however managed to get my life insured for $1500 and to\r\nborrow $1200 on the policy, and with this rather limited sum upon\r\nwhich to draw purchased an outfit for a year's collecting and sailed\r\nwith Doctor Steere for Manila. Two other young Americans accompanied\r\nhim. One of these, Doctor Frank S. Bourns, was like myself afterwards\r\ndestined to play a part in Philippine affairs which was not then\r\ndreamed of by either of us.\r\n\r\nWe spent approximately a year in the islands. Unfortunately we had\r\nneglected to provide ourselves with proper official credentials and\r\nas a result we had some embarrassing experiences. We were arrested by\r\nsuspicious Spanish officials shortly after our arrival and were tried\r\non trumped-up charges. On several subsequent occasions we narrowly\r\nescaped arrest and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe unfriendly attitude of certain of our Spanish acquaintances\r\nwas hardly to be wondered at. They could not believe that sensible,\r\ncivilized human beings would shoot tiny birds, pay for eggs the size\r\nof the tip of one's little finger more than hens' eggs were worth,\r\nundergo not a few hardships and run many risks while living in the\r\nsimplest of native houses on very inadequate food, unless actuated by\r\nsome hidden purpose. At different times they suspected us of looking\r\nfor gold deposits, of designing to stir up trouble among the natives,\r\nor of being political spies.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Bourns came back with the American troops in 1908 and\r\nI returned as a member of the first Philippine Commission in 1909,\r\nthis last supposition became a fixed belief with many of our former\r\nSpanish acquaintances who still remained in the islands, and they\r\nfrankly expressed their regret that they had not shot us while they\r\nhad the chance.\r\n\r\nOver against certain unpleasant experiences with those who could\r\nnot understand us or our work I must set much kind and invaluable\r\nassistance rendered by others who could, and did.\r\n\r\nAll in all we spent a most interesting year, visiting eighteen of\r\nthe more important islands. [1]\r\n\r\nThroughout this trip we lived in very close contact with the Filipinos,\r\neither occupying the _tribunales_, the municipal buildings of their\r\ntowns, where they felt at liberty to call and observe us at all hours\r\nof the day and night, or actually living in their houses, which in\r\nsome instances were not vacated by the owners during our occupancy.\r\n\r\nIncidentally we saw something of several of the wild tribes, including\r\nthe Tagbanuas of Palawan, the Moros of Joló, Basilan and Mindanao,\r\nand the Mangyans of Mindoro.\r\n\r\nWe experienced many very real hardships, ran not a few serious risks\r\nand ended our sojourn with six weeks of fever and starvation in the\r\ninterior of Mindoro. While we would not have cut short our appointed\r\nstay by a day, we were nevertheless delighted when we could turn our\r\nfaces homeward, and Doctor Bourns and I agreed that we had had quite\r\nenough of life in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nUpon my arrival at my home in Vermont a competent physician told my\r\nfamily that I might not live a week. I however recuperated so rapidly\r\nthat I was able to return to the University of Michigan that fall\r\nand to complete the work of my senior year. I became a member of the\r\nteaching staff of the institution before my graduation.\r\n\r\nLittle as I suspected it at the time, the tropics had fixed their\r\nstrangely firm grip on me during that fateful first trip to the Far\r\nEast which was destined to modify my whole subsequent life. I had\r\nfirmly believed that if fortunate enough to get home I should have\r\nsense enough to stay there, but before six months had elapsed I was\r\nfinding life at Ann Arbor, Michigan, decidedly prosaic, and longing\r\nto return to the Philippines and finish a piece of zoölogical work\r\nwhich I knew was as yet only begun.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bourns, like myself, was eager to go back, and we set out to\r\nraise $10,000 to pay the expenses of a two-years collecting tour, in\r\nthe course of which we hoped to visit regions not hitherto penetrated\r\nby any zoölogist.\r\n\r\nTimes were then getting hard, and good Doctor Angell, the president\r\nof the university, thought it a great joke that two young fellows\r\nlike ourselves should attempt to raise so considerable a sum to be\r\nspent largely for our own benefit. Whenever he met me on the street he\r\nused to ask whether we had obtained that $10,000 yet, and then shake\r\nwith laughter. One of the great satisfactions of my life came when,\r\non a beautiful May morning in 1890, I was able to answer his inquiry\r\nin the affirmative.\r\n\r\nHe fairly staggered with amazement, but promptly recovering himself\r\nwarmly congratulated me, and with that kindly interest which he has\r\nalways shown in the affairs of young men, asked how he could help\r\nus. Through his kindly offices and the intervention of the State\r\nDepartment we were able to obtain a royal order from the Spanish\r\ngovernment which assured us a very different reception on our return\r\nto the Philippines in August from that which had been accorded us on\r\nthe occasion of our first visit to the islands.\r\n\r\nThere was now revealed to us a pleasing side of Spanish character\r\nwhich we had largely missed during our first visit. Satisfied\r\nas to our identity and as to the motives which actuated us, the\r\nSpanish officials, practically without exception, did everything\r\nin their power to assist us and to render our sojourn pleasant and\r\nprofitable. Our mail was delivered to us at points fifty miles distant\r\nfrom provincial capitals. When our remittances failed to reach us\r\non time, as they not infrequently did, money was loaned to us freely\r\nwithout security. Troops were urged upon us for our protection when we\r\ndesired to penetrate regions considered to be dangerous. Our Spanish\r\nfriends constantly offered us the hospitality of their homes and\r\nwith many of them the offer was more than _pro forma_. Indeed, in\r\nseveral instances it was insisted upon so strongly that we accepted\r\nit, to our great pleasure and profit.\r\n\r\nOfficials were quite frank in discussing before us the affairs of\r\ntheir several provinces, and we gained a very clear insight into\r\nexisting political methods and conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring this trip we lived in even closer contact with the Filipino\r\n[2] population than on the occasion of our first visit. Our rapidly\r\ngrowing knowledge of Spanish, and of Visayan, one of the more important\r\nnative dialects, rendered it increasingly easy for us to communicate\r\nwith them, gain their confidence and learn to look at things from\r\ntheir view point. They talked with us most frankly and fully about\r\ntheir political troubles.\r\n\r\nDuring this our second sojourn in the Philippines, which lengthened to\r\ntwo years and six months, we revisited the islands with which we had\r\nbecome more or less familiar on our first trip and added six others\r\nto the list. [3] We lived for a time among the wild Bukidnons and\r\nNegritos of the Negros mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter my companion had gone to Borneo I had the misfortune to contract\r\ntyphoid fever when alone in Busuanga, and being ignorant of the nature\r\nof the malady from which I was suffering, kept on my feet until I\r\ncould no longer stand, with the natural result that I came uncommonly\r\nnear paying for my foolishness with my life, and have ever since\r\nsuffered from resulting physical disabilities. When able to travel,\r\nI left the islands upon the urgent recommendation of my physician,\r\nfeeling that the task which had led me to return there was almost\r\naccomplished and sure that my wanderings in the Far East were over.\r\n\r\nShortly after my return to the United States I was offered a position\r\nas a member of the zoölogical staff of the University of Michigan,\r\naccepted it, received speedy promotion, and hoped and expected to\r\nend my days as a college professor.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the prospect of war with Spain awakened old memories. I fancy\r\nthat the knowledge then possessed by the average American citizen\r\nrelative to the Philippines was fairly well typified by that of a\r\ngood old lady at my Vermont birthplace who had spanked me when I was a\r\nsmall boy, and who, after my first return from the Philippine Islands,\r\nsaid to me, \"Deanie, are them Philippians you have been a visitin'\r\nthe people that Paul wrote the Epistle to?\"\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to do my part toward dispelling this ignorance. My\r\nknowledge of Philippine affairs led me strongly to favour armed\r\nintervention in Cuba, where similar political conditions seemed to\r\nprevail to a considerable extent, and I fear that I was considered\r\nby many of my university colleagues something of a \"jingo.\" Indeed,\r\na member of the University Board of Regents said that I ought to be\r\ncompelled to enlist. As a matter of fact, compulsion would have been\r\nquite unnecessary had it not been for physical disability.\r\n\r\nMy life-long friend and former travelling companion, Doctor Bourns,\r\nwas not similarly hampered. He promptly joined the army as a medical\r\nofficer with the rank of major, and sailed for the islands on the\r\nsecond steamer which carried United States troops there. As a natural\r\nresult of his familiarity with Spanish and his wide acquaintanceship\r\namong the Filipinos, he was ordered from the outset to devote his\r\ntime more largely to political matters than to the practice of his\r\nprofession. He did all that he could to prevent misunderstandings\r\nbetween Filipinos and Americans. He assisted as an interpreter at\r\nthe negotiations for the surrender of Manila on August 13, 1898,\r\nafter taking part in the attack on the city. Later he was given\r\nthe rather difficult task of suppressing a bad outbreak of smallpox\r\namong the Spanish prisoners of war, which he performed with great\r\nsuccess. He was finally made chief health officer of Manila, although\r\nhe continued to devote himself largely to political matters, got\r\nnumberless deserving Filipinos out of trouble, and rapidly increased\r\nhis already wide circle of Filipino friends. Through his letters I\r\nwas kept quite closely in touch with the situation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I decided that the Philippines were not for me, asked for\r\nand obtained leave for study in Europe, and in December 1898 set\r\nout for New York to engage passage for myself and my family. I went\r\nby way of Washington in order to communicate to President McKinley\r\ncertain facts relative to the Philippine situation which it seemed\r\nto me ought to be brought to his attention.\r\n\r\nI believed that there was serious danger of an outbreak of hostilities\r\nbetween Filipinos and Americans, and that such a catastrophe, resulting\r\nfrom mutual misunderstanding, might be avoided if seasonable action\r\nwere taken. I have since learned how wrong was this latter belief. My\r\nprevious experience had been almost exclusively with the Visayans and\r\nthe wild tribes, and the revolution against the United States was at\r\nthe outset a strictly Tagálog affair, and hence beyond my ken.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley very kindly gave me all the time I wanted, displayed\r\na most earnest desire to learn the truth, and showed the deepest and\r\nmost friendly interest in the Filipinos. Let no man believe that then\r\nor later he had the slightest idea of bringing about the exploitation\r\nof their country. On the contrary, he evinced a most earnest desire\r\nto learn what was best for them and then to do it if it lay within\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement, at the end of our interview he asked me whether I\r\nwould be willing to go to the islands as his personal representative.\r\n\r\nI could not immediately decide to make such a radical change in my\r\nplans as this would involve, and asked for a week's time to think\r\nthe matter over, which was granted. I decided to go.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the President had evolved the idea of sending out a\r\ncommission and asked me if I would serve on it. I told him that I would\r\nand left for my home to make preparations for an early departure. A\r\nfew days later he announced the names of the commissioners. They were\r\nJacob Gould Schurman, President of Cornell University; Major-General\r\nElwell S. Otis, then the ranking army officer in the Philippines;\r\nRear-Admiral George Dewey, then in command of the United States fleet\r\nin Philippine waters; Colonel Charles Denby, who had for fourteen\r\nyears served as United States Minister to China, and myself.\r\n\r\nColonel Denby was delayed in Washington by public\r\nbusiness. Mr. Schurman and I reached Yokohama on the morning of\r\nFebruary 13, and on arrival there learned, to our deep regret, that\r\nhostilities had broken out on the fourth instant. We reached Manila on\r\nthe evening of March 4, but Colonel Denby was unable to join us until\r\nApril 2. Meanwhile, as we could not begin our work in his absence,\r\nI had an exceptional opportunity to observe conditions in the field,\r\nof which I availed myself.\r\n\r\nI served with the first Philippine Commission until it had completed\r\nits work, and was then appointed to the second Philippine Commission\r\nwithout a day's break in my period of service.\r\n\r\nThe members of this latter body were William H. Taft of Ohio; Luke\r\nE. Wright of Tennessee; Henry C. Ide of Vermont; Bernard Moses of\r\nCalifornia, and myself. Briefly stated, the task before us was to\r\nestablish civil government in the Philippine Islands. After a period\r\nof ninety days, to be spent in observation, the commission was to\r\nbecome the legislative body, while executive power continued to be\r\nvested for a time in the military.\r\n\r\nThis condition endured until the 4th of July, 1901, on which\r\nday Mr. Taft was appointed civil governor. On September 1, 1901,\r\neach of the remaining original members of the commission became\r\nan executive officer as well. Mr. Wright was appointed secretary\r\nof commerce and police; Mr. Ide, secretary of finance and justice;\r\nMr. Moses, secretary of public instruction, and I myself, Secretary\r\nof the Interior. On the same day three Filipino members were added\r\nto the commission: Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera, Sr. Benito Legarda and\r\nSr. José R. de Luzuriaga.\r\n\r\nUntil the 16th of October, 1907, the Commission continued to serve as\r\nthe sole legislative body. It is at the present time the upper house\r\nof the Philippine Legislature, the Philippine Assembly, composed of\r\neighty-one elective members, constituting the lower house.\r\n\r\nI have therefore had a hand in the enactment of all legislation put\r\nin force in the Philippine Islands since the American occupation, with\r\nthe exception of certain laws passed during my few and brief absences.\r\n\r\nAs secretary of the interior it fell to my lot to organize and\r\ndirect the operations of a Bureau of Health, a Bureau of Govermnent\r\nLaboratories, a Bureau of Forestry, a Bureau of Public Lands, a Bureau\r\nof Agriculture, a Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, a Mining Bureau\r\nand a Weather Bureau. Ultimately, the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes\r\nand the Mining Bureau were incorporated with the Bureau of Government\r\nLaboratories to form the Bureau of Science, which continued under my\r\nexecutive control. The Bureau of Agriculture was transferred to the\r\nDepartment of Public Instruction in 1909.\r\n\r\nI was at the outset given administrative control of all matters\r\npertaining to the non-Christian tribes, which constitute, roughly\r\nspeaking, an eighth of the population of the Philippines, and until\r\nmy resignation retained such control throughout the islands, except\r\nin the Moro Province, which at an early day was put directly under\r\nthe governor-general.\r\n\r\nI participated in the organization of civil government in the several\r\nprovinces of the archipelago, and myself drafted the Municipal Code\r\nfor the government of the towns inhabited by Filipinos, as well as\r\nthe Special Provincial Government Act and the Township Government\r\nAct for that of the provinces and settlements inhabited chiefly by\r\nthe non-Christian tribes.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we did not so much as know with certainty the names\r\nof the several wild and savage tribes inhabiting the more remote and\r\ninaccessible portions of the archipelago. As I was unable to obtain\r\nreliable information concerning them on which to base legislation\r\nfor their control and uplifting, I proceeded to get such information\r\nfor myself by visiting their territory, much of which was then quite\r\nunexplored.\r\n\r\nAfter this territory was organized into five so-called \"Special\r\nGovernment Provinces,\" some of my Filipino friends, I fear not\r\nmoved solely by anxiety for the public good, favoured and secured a\r\nlegislative enactment which made it my official duty to visit and\r\ninspect these provinces at least once during each fiscal year. I\r\nshall always feel indebted to them for giving me this opportunity to\r\nbecome intimately acquainted with some of the most interesting, most\r\nprogressive, and potentially most important peoples of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1901 I received the news that a central government was soon to\r\nbe established, I was in the Sub-province of Lepanto on my first trip\r\nthrough the wilder and less-known portions of northern Luzon. During\r\neach succeeding year I have spent from two to four months in travel\r\nthrough the archipelago, familiarizing myself at first hand with\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\nI have frequently taken with me on these inspection trips\r\nrepresentatives of the Bureaus of Forestry, Agriculture, Science\r\nand Health to carry on practical investigations, and have made it my\r\nbusiness to visit and explore little known and unknown regions. There\r\nare very few islands worthy of the name which it has not been my\r\nprivilege to visit.\r\n\r\nThe organization of an effective campaign against diseases like bubonic\r\nplague, smallpox, Asiatic cholera and leprosy in a country where no\r\nsimilar work had ever previously been undertaken, inhabited by people\r\nprofoundly ignorant of the benefits to be derived from modern methods\r\nof sanitation, and superstitious to a degree, promptly brought me\r\ninto violent conflict with the beliefs and prejudices of a large\r\nportion of the Filipino population.\r\n\r\nA similar result followed the inauguration of an active campaign for\r\nthe suppression of surra, foot and mouth disease, and rinderpest,\r\nwhich were rapidly destroying the horses and cattle.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset I was held responsible for the enforcement of marine\r\nand land quarantine regulations, which were at first very obnoxious\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pure Food and Drugs Act adopted by Congress for the United\r\nStates was made applicable to the Philippines without any provision for\r\nits enforcement, this not altogether pleasant duty was assigned to me.\r\n\r\nI did not seek appointment to the Philippine service in the first\r\ninstance. The political influence at my command has never extended\r\nbeyond my own vote. During a period of twelve years my removal was\r\nloudly and frequently demanded, yet I saw President Schurman, Colonel\r\nDenby, General Otis, Admiral Dewey, Commissioner Moses, Governor Taft,\r\nGovernor Wright, Governor Ide, Governor Smith, Secretary Shuster,\r\nCommissioner Tavera, Commissioner Legarda and Governor Forbes, all my\r\ncolleagues on one or the other of the Philippine commissions, leave\r\nthe service, before my own voluntary retirement on September 15, 1913.\r\n\r\nI had long expected a request for my resignation at any time, and\r\nhad often wished that it might come. Indeed I once before tendered\r\nit voluntarily, only to have President Taft say that he thought I\r\nshould withdraw it, which I did. I am absolutely without political\r\nambition save an earnest desire to earn the political epitaph,\r\n\"He did what he could.\"\r\n\r\nDuring my brief and infrequent visits to the United States I have\r\ndiscovered there widespread and radical misapprehension as to\r\nconditions in the Philippines, but have failed to find that lack of\r\ninterest in them which is commonly said to exist. On the contrary,\r\nI have found the American public keenly desirous of getting at the\r\nreal facts whenever there was an opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary extent to which untrue statements have been accepted\r\nat their face value has surprised and deeply disturbed me. I have\r\nconversed with three college presidents, each of whom believed that\r\nthe current expenses of the Philippine government were paid from the\r\nUnited States Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of false and misleading statements about the\r\nPhilippines is due, it seems to me, primarily to the fact that it is\r\nthose persons with whom the climate disagrees and who in consequence\r\nare invalided home, and those who are separated from the service in\r\nthe interest of the public good, who return to the United States and\r\nget an audience there; while those who successfully adapt themselves to\r\nlocal conditions, display interest in their work and become proficient\r\nin it, remain in the islands for long periods during which they are\r\ntoo busy, and too far from home, to make themselves heard.\r\n\r\nIncidentally it must be remembered that if such persons do attempt to\r\nset forth facts which years of practical experience have taught them,\r\nthey are promptly accused of endeavouring to save their own bread and\r\nbutter by seeking to perpetuate conditions which insure them fat jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the splendid men who have uncomplainingly laid down\r\ntheir lives in the military and in the civil service of their country\r\nin these islands, and of the larger number who have given freely of\r\ntheir best years to unselfish, efficient work for others, this charge\r\nfills me with indignation.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that kept me in the Philippine service for so long\r\na time was my interest in the work for the non-Christian tribes and\r\nmy fear that while my successor was gaining knowledge concerning it\r\nwhich can be had only through experience, matters might temporarily\r\ngo to the bad. It has been my ambition to bring this work to such a\r\npoint that it would move on, for a time at least, by its own momentum.\r\n\r\nI am now setting forth my views relative to the past and present\r\nsituation in the islands because I believe that their inhabitants\r\nare confronted by a danger graver than any which they have before\r\nfaced since the time when their fate wavered in the balance, while the\r\nquestion whether the United States should acquire sovereignty over them\r\nor should allow Spain to continue to rule them was under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to tell the plain, hard truth regardless of the effect\r\nof such conduct upon my future career. It has been alleged that my\r\nviews on Philippine problems were coloured by a desire to retain my\r\nofficial position. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed,\r\nno man who has not served for long and sometimes very weary years\r\nas a public official, and has not been a target for numerous more\r\nor less irresponsible individuals whose hands were filled with mud\r\nand who were actuated by a fixed desire to throw it at something,\r\ncan appreciate as keenly as I do the manifold blessings which attend\r\nthe life of a private citizen.\r\n\r\nI trust that I have said enough to make clear my view point, and\r\nnow a word as to subject-matter. It is my intention to correct some\r\nof the very numerous misstatements which have been made concerning\r\npast and present conditions in the Philippines. I shall quote, from\r\ntime to time, such statements, both verbal and written, and more\r\nespecially some of those which have recently appeared in a book\r\nentitled \"The American Occupation of the Philippines, 1898-1912,\"\r\nby James H. Blount, who signs himself \"Officer of the United States\r\nVolunteers in the Philippines, 1899-1901; United States District\r\nJudge in the Philippines, 1901-1905.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Blount has indulged so freely in obvious hyperbole, and has made\r\nso very evident the bitter personal animosities which inspire many\r\nof his statements, that it has been a genuine surprise to his former\r\nassociates and acquaintances that his book has been taken seriously.\r\n\r\nIt should be sufficiently evident to any unprejudiced reader that in\r\nwriting it he has played the part of the special pleader rather than\r\nthat of the historian. He has used government records freely, and as\r\nis usually the case when a special pleader quotes from such records,\r\nthe nature of the matter which he has omitted is worthy of more than\r\npassing attention. I shall hope to be able to fill some of the gaps\r\nthat he has left in the documentary history of the events which he\r\ndiscusses and by so doing, very materially to change its purport.\r\n\r\nAs public documents have been so misused, and as a new administration\r\nis bestowing on Filipinos political offices, and giving them\r\nopportunities, for which they are as yet utterly unprepared, thus\r\nendangering the results of years of hard, patient, self-sacrificing\r\nwork performed by experienced and competent men, it becomes necessary\r\nto strike home by revealing unpleasant facts which are of record\r\nbut have not heretofore been disclosed because of the injury to\r\nreputations and the wounding of feelings which would result from their\r\npublication. In doing this I feel that I am only discharging a duty to\r\nthe people of the United States, who are entitled to know the truth if\r\nthe present possibility of Philippine independence is to be seriously\r\nconsidered, and to the several Filipino peoples who are to-day in\r\ndanger of rushing headlong to their own utter and final destruction.\r\n\r\nAt the outset I shall discuss the oft-asserted claim that the Filipino\r\nleaders were deceived and betrayed by American officials whom they\r\nassisted, and that this unpardonable conduct led to the outbreak of\r\nactive hostilities which occurred just prior to the arrival at Manila\r\nof the first Philippine Commission.\r\n\r\nI shall then show that these leaders never established a\r\ngovernment which adequately protected life and property, or gave\r\nto their people peace, happiness or justice, but on the contrary\r\ninaugurated a veritable reign of terror under which murder became a\r\ngovernmental institution, while rape, inhuman torture, burying alive\r\nand other ghastly crimes were of common occurrence, and usually went\r\nunpunished. The data which I use in establishing these contentions\r\nare for the most part taken directly from the Insurgent records,\r\nin referring to which I employ the war department abbreviation\r\n\"P.I.R.\" followed by a number.\r\n\r\nI next take up some of the more important subsequent historical events,\r\ndescribing the work of the first Philippine Commission, and showing\r\nin what manner the government established by the second Philippine\r\nCommission has discharged its stewardship, subsequently discussing\r\ncertain as yet unsolved problems which confront the present government,\r\nsuch as that presented by the existence of slavery and peonage, and\r\nthat of the non-Christian tribes. For the benefit of those who, like\r\nJudge Blount, consider the Philippines \"a vast straggly archipelago of\r\njungle-covered islands in the south seas which have been a nuisance to\r\nevery government that ever owned them,\" I give some facts as to the\r\nislands, their climate, their natural resources and their commercial\r\npossibilities, and close by setting forth my views as to the present\r\nability of the civilized Cagayans, Ilocanos, Pampangans, Zambals,\r\nPangasináns, Tagálogs, Bicols and Visayans, commonly and correctly\r\ncalled _Filipinos_, to establish, or to maintain when established,\r\na stable government throughout Filipino territory, to say nothing\r\nof bringing under just and effective control, and of protecting and\r\ncivilizing, the people of some twenty-seven non-Christian tribes which\r\nconstitute an eighth of the population, and occupy approximately half\r\nof the territory, of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nI wish here to acknowledge my very great indebtedness to Major\r\nJ. R. M. Taylor, who has translated and compiled the Insurgent [4]\r\nrecords, thereby making available a very large mass of reliable\r\nand most valuable information without which a number of chapters of\r\nthis book would have remained unwritten. Surely no man who bases his\r\nstatements concerning Filipino rule on the facts set forth in these\r\nrecords can be accused of deriving his information from hostile or\r\nprejudiced sources.\r\n\r\nOf them, Major Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"No one reading the Insurgent records can fail to be\r\n    impressed with the difference between the Spanish and\r\n    the Tagálog documents. Many of the former are doubtless\r\n    written with a view to their coming into the hands of the\r\n    Americans, or with deliberate purpose to have them do so,\r\n    and are framed accordingly. All Tagálog documents, intended\r\n    only for Filipinos, say much that is not said in the Spanish\r\n    documents. The orders of the Dictator [5] to his subjects\r\n    were conveyed in the latter series of documents.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWas Independence Promised?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been the fashion in certain quarters to allege, or to\r\ninsinuate, that American consuls and naval officers promised the\r\nInsurgent leaders that the independence of the Philippines would be\r\nrecognized by the United States. It has been claimed by some that\r\nthe coöperation of the Insurgents in the military operations against\r\nManila was sought for and secured. Others say that they were at least\r\n_de facto_ allies of the United States, and that they were in the\r\nend shamelessly betrayed and wantonly attacked.\r\n\r\nThese are very serious charges. I shall prove, chiefly by the Insurgent\r\nrecords, that each of them is false. I ask the forbearance of my\r\nreaders if, in the three chapters which I devote to these matters,\r\nI quote documentary evidence at length. When original documents\r\nor extracts from them tell a clear and reasonably concise story,\r\nI sometimes insert them bodily in the text. In other cases I give my\r\nown version of the facts which they set forth, but give the full text\r\nin foot-notes. In nearly all instances references are given to sources\r\nof documentary information. I greatly regret that Taylor's narrative,\r\nwith its very numerous supporting documents, is not readily accessible\r\nto the student of history. It ought to have been published, but never\r\ngot beyond the galley-proof stage. In referring to it, I am therefore\r\nobliged to use the word Taylor followed by the letters and figures\r\ndesignating the page of this galley proof on which the passage referred\r\nto is found. Whenever possible I give the War Department numbers [6]\r\nof Insurgent documents, but in a few cases can give only the exhibit\r\nnumbers assigned by Taylor in printing the documents.\r\n\r\nAs his exhibits are serially arranged it is easy to find any one of\r\nthem. Copies of his work may be found in the War Department and in\r\nthe office of the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary.\r\n\r\nReferring to the charge that the Insurgents were deceived, even had\r\ndeceit been practised as claimed, Aguinaldo would have had no just\r\nground for complaint, for he himself not only frankly advocated its\r\nuse, but deliberately employed it in his dealings with the Americans,\r\nas clearly appears in records hereinafter cited. [7] However, most\r\nAmericans hold to a standard very different from his. Was it departed\r\nfrom in this instance?\r\n\r\nAguinaldo has specifically and repeatedly charged that Pratt and Dewey\r\npromised him the recognition of the independence of the Philippines\r\nby the United States. [8]\r\n\r\nJudge Blount has referred to the \"_de facto_ alliance between the\r\nAmericans and Aguinaldo,\" and has dwelt at length on \"promises,\r\nboth expressed and implied,\" which were subsequently repudiated\r\nby Consul Pratt, Admiral Dewey and Generals Anderson and Merritt,\r\nconstantly suggesting, even when he does not specifically charge,\r\nbad faith on the part of these officers of the United States. [9]\r\n\r\nOn analyzing his statements we find that he is discreetly non-committal\r\nas to exactly what were the expressed promises, nor does he make it so\r\nplain as might be desired what legitimate inferences were deducible\r\nfrom the acts of the Americans in question. He quotes an alleged\r\nstatement of General Anderson to the effect that:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whether Admiral Dewey and Consuls Pratt, Wildman, [10] and\r\n    Williams [11] did or did not give Aguinaldo assurances that a\r\n    Philippino government would be recognized, the Phillippinos\r\n    certainly thought so, judging from their acts rather than\r\n    from their words. Admiral Dewey gave them arms and ammunition,\r\n    as I did subsequently at his request.\" [12]\r\n\r\nBefore discussing these charges I will briefly review certain\r\nhistorical facts, knowledge of which will be useful in considering\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1896, an insurrection against Spain had broken out in the\r\nPhilippines under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo, a resident of\r\nCavite Viejo, who had been a school teacher, and was, at that time,\r\n_gobernadorcillo_ [13] of his town.\r\n\r\nIt had been terminated by the so-called \"Treaty of Biacnabató,\"\r\nsigned in Manila on December 15, 1897.\r\n\r\nThis document provided for the surrender of \"Don Emilio Aguinaldo,\r\nSupreme Chief of the Insurgents in arms,\" and Don Marciano Llanera\r\nand Don Baldomero Aguinaldo, his subordinates, together with their\r\nsoldiers and arms.\r\n\r\n\"The Excellent Señor General in Chief\" of the Spanish forces was to\r\n\"provide the necessary means for supporting the lives\" of those who\r\nsurrendered before a certain fixed date.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice what was done was to agree to pay them $800,000\r\n[14] in three instalments, the first of $400,000, the second and\r\nthird of $200,000 each.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo and certain other leaders were to take up their residence\r\noutside the islands. Their deportation was duly provided for, and\r\nAguinaldo and twenty-six of his companions were taken to Hongkong,\r\non the Spanish steamer _Uranus_; arriving there on December 31, 1897.\r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1898, $400,000 were deposited in the Hongkong Bank,\r\nto the credit of Aguinaldo and Co.\r\n\r\nThe Insurgent leaders remaining at Biacnabató had a meeting under the\r\npresidency of Isabelo Artacho, an Ilocano [15] who was the ranking\r\nofficer in the absence of Aguinaldo, and requested that the second\r\ninstalment, of $200,000, be paid to them. The Spanish governor-general,\r\nPrimo de Rivera, acceded to their request, and they divided the money,\r\nalthough Aguinaldo denied their right to do so, claiming that it\r\nshould have been sent to Hongkong.\r\n\r\nThe third payment of $200,000 was apparently never made. Primo de\r\nRivera says that he turned over a check for $200,000 to his successor,\r\nGeneral Augustin, in April, 1898; giving as his reason for refusing to\r\npay it to the Insurgents that there seemed to him to be no prospect of\r\nits being equitably divided among those who were entitled to receive\r\nit under the agreement.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo and his associates claimed that certain reforms were promised\r\nby the Spanish government at the time the treaty of Biacnabató\r\nwas negotiated, and as these measures were not put into effect,\r\nthey organized a junta or revolutionary committee at Hongkong. It\r\nincluded in its membership a number of Filipino political exiles,\r\nthen residing at that place.\r\n\r\nThe men who composed this organization soon fell to quarrelling and\r\nit became necessary to come to a definite understanding as to its\r\naims. Under the arrangement finally reached, the junta, as a whole,\r\nwas charged with the work of propaganda outside of the archipelago;\r\nwith all diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments; and\r\nwith the preparation and shipment of such articles as were needed\r\nto carry on the revolution in the Philippines. It was to be allowed\r\nvoice by Aguinaldo's government in any serious question which might\r\narise abroad, and would aid that government in bringing the civil\r\nadministration of the Philippines to the level of that of the most\r\nadvanced nations.\r\n\r\nTrouble soon arose among the former Insurgent leaders over the division\r\nof the funds deposited at Hongkong.\r\n\r\nTaylor gives a trustworthy and concise account of the events of this\r\nperiod, and as it is of historic interest, and makes clear just\r\nhow Aguinaldo came to go to Singapore, meet Pratt, and enter into\r\nnegotiations with him, I quote extensive extracts from it. [16]\r\n\r\n    \"From January 4 to April 4, Aguinaldo withdrew from the\r\n    banks 5786.46 pesos in part interest on the money he had\r\n    deposited. This was used to pay the expenses of himself and his\r\n    companions in Hongkong. These expenses were kept at a minimum;\r\n    the money was drawn and spent by him. If one of the men with\r\n    him needed a new pair of shoes, Aguinaldo paid for them;\r\n    if another wanted a new coat, Aguinaldo bought it. Minute\r\n    accounts were kept, which are on file among his papers,\r\n    and it is seen from them that his expenses were exceeding\r\n    his income, which could only be 12,000 pesos a year, while he\r\n    was living at the rate of 22,000, with constant demands being\r\n    made upon him by men who came from the Philippines. Life was\r\n    not easy under these conditions. Aguinaldo's companions were\r\n    entirely dependent upon him. Their most trivial expenses had\r\n    to be approved by him, and he held them down with a strong\r\n    hand. They were men living in a strange land, among a people\r\n    whose language they did not speak, having nothing to do but\r\n    quarrel among themselves, exiles waiting for a chance to\r\n    return to their own country, which they watched with weary\r\n    eyes while they guarded the embers by which they hoped to\r\n    light the fires of a new insurrection.\r\n\r\n    \"The men who had accompanied Aguinaldo to Hongkong were\r\n    not the only Filipinos domiciled there; a number of men had\r\n    taken refuge in that British colony after the events of 1872,\r\n    and some of them at least had prospered. Some of them, like\r\n    the members of the Cortes family, seem to have had almost\r\n    no relations with the followers of Aguinaldo; some, like\r\n    J. M. Basa, knew them and took part in some of the meetings of\r\n    the governing groups, but were probably not admitted to their\r\n    full confidence, as Aguinaldo and his immediate following\r\n    wanted and were working for independence and independence\r\n    alone, while the Filipinos who had long lived in Hongkong\r\n    wanted to see the archipelago lost to Spain, but had no\r\n    confidence in the ability of the country to stand alone or\r\n    in the fitness of Aguinaldo and his following to direct the\r\n    councils of a state. The character of the new refugees did\r\n    not inspire confidence in these older men, who hoped for a\r\n    protectorate by or annexation to the United States.\r\n\r\n    \"On May 6, 1898, the consul-general of the United States there\r\n    informed the State Department that D. Cortés, M. Cortés,\r\n    A. Rosario, Gracio Gonzaga, and José Maria Basa (50), all\r\n    very wealthy land-owners, bankers, and lawyers of Manila,\r\n    desired to tender their allegiance and the allegiance of\r\n    their powerful families in Manila to the United States,\r\n    and that they had instructed all their connections to render\r\n    every aid to the United States forces in Manila. On May 14 he\r\n    forwarded statements of other Filipinos domiciled in Hongkong,\r\n    not members of the junta, that they desired to submit their\r\n    allegiance and the allegiance of their families in the\r\n    Philippine Islands to the United States. One of Aguinaldo's\r\n    followers, writing somewhat later, spoke with bitterness\r\n    of the rich old men who went about calling their companions\r\n    'beggarly rebels,' but these men were rich, and their names and\r\n    their apparent adhesion to the cause represented by Aguinaldo\r\n    would inspire confidence in him among men of property in\r\n    the Philippines. They were, accordingly, not to be lightly\r\n    alienated; therefore, at first, at least, no open break took\r\n    place with them, but their attitude toward the leaders of\r\n    the insurrection is shown by the fact that after the early\r\n    summer of 1898 they took no, or very little, part in the\r\n    insurgent movement, although they were living in Hongkong,\r\n    the seat of the junta, which conducted the propaganda for\r\n    the insurgent government of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"But, in fact, Aguinaldo had no just conception of the\r\n    conditions and of the opportunities which were about to open\r\n    before the Hongkong junta, for although war between Spain and\r\n    the United States was imminent and a United States squadron\r\n    was in Hongkong threatening Manila, Aguinaldo was chiefly\r\n    concerned in finding how to avoid losing the money which\r\n    had been received from the Spanish government as the price\r\n    of his surrender. The importance of his presence near the\r\n    Philippines in case of war did not occur to him, or if it did\r\n    occur to him anything which he could obtain there from the\r\n    aid of the United States probably seemed for the moment of\r\n    little consequence compared with escaping from his wrangling\r\n    companions with enough money to live on in Paris.\r\n\r\n    \"Artacho, who had received 5000 pesos as his share of the\r\n    second payment, arrived in Hongkong and on April 5 demanded\r\n    200,000 pesos of the insurgent funds, probably under the\r\n    agreement that he should establish a company in Hongkong\r\n    for the benefit of the former leaders and not merely of\r\n    those who had accompanied Aguinaldo. But the leaders in\r\n    Hongkong had denounced that agreement, and refused to pay. He\r\n    then entered suit before the supreme court of Hongkong,\r\n    calling upon Aguinaldo for an accounting of the trust funds\r\n    deposited in his hands for the benefit of Artacho and others,\r\n    and asked for an injunction restraining Aguinaldo or any\r\n    member of the junta from handling or disposing of any part\r\n    of said funds. He filed as evidence copies of the Biacnabató\r\n    agreement and of the agreement made by the leaders on December\r\n    19. This suit was brought not merely in the name of Artacho,\r\n    but in that of all the exiles who were described as living\r\n    in exile in Hongkong in accordance with an agreement made\r\n    with the Spanish Government. Artacho probably had adherents\r\n    among these men, some at least of whom were utterly weary\r\n    of waiting in Hongkong and of living upon what was doled out\r\n    to them. Some at least saw no chance of any other fate than\r\n    indefinite exile spent in dependence upon the inner group\r\n    for even the means of existence.\r\n\r\n    \"The suit was in equity, and called for an accounting for the\r\n    trust funds which the complainant recognized were legally\r\n    in the hands of Aguinaldo. It could be carried on only\r\n    with great difficulty without his presence and without his\r\n    account books. Meetings were held, and Artacho was denounced\r\n    as attempting to extort blackmail, but he refused to yield,\r\n    and Aguinaldo, rather than explain the inner workings of the\r\n    Hongkong junta before a British court, prepared for flight. A\r\n    summons was issued for his appearance before the supreme court\r\n    of Hongkong on April 13, 1898, but he was by that time beyond\r\n    its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n    \"He drew out the 50,000 pesos from the Chartered Bank,\r\n    which had become due according to the terms of the deposit,\r\n    and perhaps such other sums as could be drawn upon by check,\r\n    engaged passage for Europe by way of Singapore for G. H. del\r\n    Pilar, J. M. Leyba, and himself under assumed names, appointed\r\n    V. Belarmino to succeed to his functions, and gave him checks\r\n    signed in blank to draw the interest of the sums on deposit to\r\n    provide for the support of the exiles. He gave as his reason\r\n    for departure that he was going to remain under cover until\r\n    Artacho could be bought off, but he intended to go far afield\r\n    for this purpose, as he gave his destination as Europe and\r\n    the United States.\r\n\r\n    \"Aguinaldo and his companions probably sailed from Hongkong\r\n    on April 8, 1898, and arrived in Singapore on April 21, after\r\n    stopping in Saigon. War between the United States and Spain\r\n    had been rendered inevitable by the resolution of Congress\r\n    demanding that Spain should withdraw her forces from Cuba,\r\n    and was declared on April 21. Although Aguinaldo and his\r\n    followers did not appreciate the influence which conditions on\r\n    the other side of the world might have upon the future of the\r\n    Philippines, it happened that in Singapore at that time there\r\n    was an Englishman named Bray who did. He had been a member of\r\n    the civil service in India, and had lived for some years in the\r\n    Philippines, but he had fallen upon evil days and was engaged\r\n    in writing letters to the Singapore _Free Press_ upon the\r\n    Philippines, and in retailing such information as was in his\r\n    possession concerning them to the United States consul-general\r\n    in Singapore, Mr. E. Spencer Pratt, for transmittal to\r\n    Commodore Dewey. Bray heard of the arrival of Aguinaldo and\r\n    realized what could be done with him, and that if the matter\r\n    were well handled it might be to his own advantage. He went\r\n    at once to see Aguinaldo and informed him that the United\r\n    States consul-general was anxious to see him. He went to the\r\n    consul-general and informed him of the importance of Aguinaldo,\r\n    and that he was in Singapore. Aguinaldo had to be persuaded\r\n    to agree to a meeting. The consul-general was anxious for it,\r\n    and it took place, according to Aguinaldo, on the night of\r\n    April 22 (according to Pratt, on the morning of April 24). The\r\n    statement made by Aguinaldo is probably correct. According\r\n    to his account book, he paid $11 on April 23, 1898, for a\r\n    telegram to the Hongkong junta concerning the negotiations\r\n    'with America.'\r\n\r\n    \"Aguinaldo knew but little English, Pratt knew no Spanish, so\r\n    in their interview Bray acted as interpreter. An interpreter\r\n    who is interested in the subject of the discussion may\r\n    be a dangerous man. It is impossible to say what he told\r\n    Aguinaldo. Certainly Pratt did not know; but whatever was\r\n    said during these conversations it is within the limits\r\n    of possibility that Pratt may have been made to say by the\r\n    interpreter more than he intended, and that his statements of\r\n    what would probably be granted by the United States Government\r\n    and his expression of good wishes for the cause of Filipino\r\n    independence may have been translated as assurances and as\r\n    promises. Bray, who, according to his Filipino former friends,\r\n    was apt to talk too much, may have talked too much on this\r\n    occasion, and so the myth of the formal agreement between\r\n    Aguinaldo on behalf of the Filipino insurgents and Pratt on\r\n    behalf of the United States grew up, a fiction which Bray\r\n    himself, with a natural desire to add to his own importance,\r\n    did his best to circulate.\r\n\r\n    \"Bray did not ask for his reward at the time, but probably\r\n    reckoned upon making himself indispensable as an adviser,\r\n    so that later he could make his own terms. For a time he\r\n    wrote letters of advice to Aguinaldo, which may have had\r\n    some influence upon the line of conduct which he adopted, and\r\n    later was employed in furnishing from Hongkong news to various\r\n    newspapers of events and conditions in the Philippines. His\r\n    cablegrams shortly before the outbreak of hostilities between\r\n    the United States and the insurgents were more picturesque\r\n    than veracious, but they were apparently considered effective,\r\n    as Aguinaldo ordered that he should be given $5000. He wanted\r\n    more, but the Hongkong junta did not trust him, and he ceased\r\n    to be in their employment.\" [17]\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, Bray did not do all of the interpreting at Singapore,\r\nand we shall be able to determine with some accuracy what actually\r\ntranspired there.\r\n\r\nWe can now consider understandingly the charges made against Pratt\r\nand Dewey.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed over and over again, that Pratt promised Aguinaldo\r\nrecognition of tile independence of the Philippines if he and his\r\npeople would cooperate with the United States forces against Spain.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo himself made the charge in his \"Reseña Verídica\" [18]\r\nin the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"In this interview Consul Pratt told me that because the\r\n    Spaniards had not complied with the agreement of Biac-na-bató,\r\n    the Filipinos had a right to renew their interrupted revolution\r\n    and advised me to take up arms anew against Spain, assuring me\r\n    that America would give the Filipinos the greatest advantages\r\n    (mayores ventajas). Then I asked the Consul what advantages the\r\n    United States would concede to the Philippines, suggesting,\r\n    when I had the proper opening, the propriety of making an\r\n    agreement in writing, to which the Consul answered that he\r\n    would report, by telegraph, on the subject to Mr. Dewey,\r\n    who was the chief of the expedition against the Philippines,\r\n    and who had ample powers from President McKinley.\r\n\r\n    \"On the following day, between 10 and 12 in the morning, we\r\n    again took up the matter, Consul Pratt saying that the admiral\r\n    had answered my inquiry by saying that the United States\r\n    would at least recognize the independence of the Philippine\r\n    government under a naval protectorate, but that there was no\r\n    necessity to put it in writing, as the words of the admiral\r\n    and the American consul were sacred and would be fulfilled,\r\n    not being like those of the Spaniards, and finally, that the\r\n    Government of North America was a very honourable Government,\r\n    a very just and very powerful one.\" [19]\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1908, Pratt telegraphed the Secretary of State as\r\nfollows: --\r\n\r\n    \"General Aguinaldo gone my instance Hongkong arrange with\r\n    Dewey coöperation insurgents Manila.\r\n\r\n    \"_Pratt_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th he wrote the Secretary, explaining how he had come to\r\nmeet Aguinaldo, and stating just what he had done. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"At this interview, after learning from General Aguinaldo\r\n    the state of an object sought to be obtained by the present\r\n    insurrectionary movement, which, though absent from the\r\n    Philippines, he was still directing, I took it upon myself,\r\n    whilst explaining that I had no authority to speak for the\r\n    Government, to point out the danger of continuing independent\r\n    action at this stage; and, having convinced him of the\r\n    expediency of cooperating with our fleet, then at Hongkong,\r\n    and obtained the assurance of his willingness to proceed\r\n    thither and confer with Commodore Dewey to that end, should\r\n    the latter so desire, I telegraphed the Commodore the same\r\n    day as follows, through our consul-general at Hongkong:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Aguinaldo, insurgent leader, here. Will come Hongkong\r\n    arrange with Commodore for general cooperation insurgents\r\n    Manila if desired. Telegraph.\r\n\r\n    \"'_Pratt_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Commodore's reply read thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tell Aguinaldo come soon as possible.\r\n\r\n    \"'_Dewey_.'\"\r\n\r\nPratt adds:--\r\n\r\n    \"I received it late at night, and at once communicated to\r\n    General Aguinaldo, who, with his aide-de-camp and private\r\n    secretary, all under assumed names, I succeeded in getting\r\n    off by the British Steamer _Malacca_, which left here on\r\n    Tuesday the 26th.\r\n\r\n    \"Just previous to his departure, I had a second and last\r\n    interview with General Aguinaldo, the particulars of which\r\n    I shall give you by next mail.\r\n\r\n    \"The general impressed me as a man of intelligence, ability,\r\n    and courage, and worthy the confidence that had been placed\r\n    in him.\r\n\r\n    \"I think that in arranging for his direct cooperation with the\r\n    commander of our forces, I have prevented possible conflict of\r\n    action and facilitated the work of occupying and administering\r\n    the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"If this course of mine meets with the Government's approval,\r\n    as I trust it may, I shall be fully satisfied; to Mr. Bray,\r\n    however, I consider there is due some special recognition\r\n    for most valuable services rendered.\r\n\r\n    \"How that recognition can best be made I leave to you to\r\n    decide.\r\n\r\n    \"I have, etc.\" [20]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Pratt explained to Aguinaldo that he had no\r\nauthority to speak for the government; that there was no mention in\r\nthe cablegrams between Pratt and Dewey of independence or indeed of\r\nany conditions on which Aguinaldo was to coöperate, these details\r\nbeing left for future arrangement with Dewey; and that Pratt thought\r\nthat he had prevented possible conflict of action and facilitated\r\nthe work of occupying and administering the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe particulars as to the second and last interview between Aguinaldo\r\nand Pratt were embodied in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n    \"No. 213. _Consulate-General of the United States._\r\n\r\n    \"_Singapore_, April 30, 1898.\r\n\r\n    \"_Sir_: Referring to my dispatch No. 212, of the 28th instant,\r\n    I have the honor to report that in the second and last\r\n    interview I had with Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo on the eve of his\r\n    departure for Hongkong, I enjoined upon him the necessity,\r\n    under Commodore Dewey's direction, of exerting absolute\r\n    control over his forces in the Philippines, as no excesses\r\n    on their part would be tolerated by the American Government,\r\n    the President having declared that the present hostilities\r\n    with Spain were to be carried on in strict accord with modern\r\n    principles of civilized warfare.\r\n\r\n    \"To this General Aguinaldo fully assented, assuring me that\r\n    he intended and was perfectly able, once on the field, to\r\n    hold his followers, the insurgents, in check and lead them\r\n    as our commander should direct.\r\n\r\n    \"The general stated that he hoped the United States would\r\n    assume protection of the Philippines for at least long enough\r\n    to allow the inhabitants to establish a government of their\r\n    own, in the organization of which he would desire American\r\n    advice and assistance.\r\n\r\n    \"These questions I told him I had no authority to discuss.\r\n\r\n    \"I have, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"_E. Spencer Pratt_,\r\n\r\n    \"_United States Consul-General_.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent communication written on July 28, 1898, Pratt made\r\nthe following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"I declined even to discuss with General Aguinaldo the\r\n    question of the future policy of the United States with\r\n    regard to the Philippines, that I held out no hopes to him\r\n    of any kind, committed the government in no way whatever,\r\n    and, in the course of our confidences, never acted upon\r\n    the assumption that the Government would cooperate with\r\n    him--General Aguinaldo--for the furtherance of any plans\r\n    of his own, nor that, in accepting his said cooperation,\r\n    it would consider itself pledged to recognize any political\r\n    claims which he might put forward.\" [21]\r\n\r\nWhat reason if any is there for denying the truth of this allegation?\r\n\r\nI will give in full Blount's statement as to what occurred at a\r\nmeeting held at Singapore, to celebrate the early successes of Dewey\r\nand Aguinaldo, as it constitutes his nearest approach to a direct\r\nclaim, that any one at any time promised independence:--\r\n\r\n    \"First there was music by the band. Then followed the formal\r\n    reading and presentation of the address by a Dr. Santos,\r\n    representing the Filipino community of Singapore. The address\r\n    pledged the 'eternal gratitude' of the Filipino people to\r\n    Admiral Dewey and the honored addressee; alluded to the glories\r\n    of independence, and to how Aguinaldo had been enabled; by the\r\n    arrangement so happily effected with Admiral Dewey by Consul\r\n    Pratt, to arouse eight millions of Filipinos to take up arms\r\n    'in defence of those principles of justice and liberty of\r\n    which your country is the foremost champion' and trusted\r\n    'that the United States... will efficaciously second the\r\n    programme arranged between you, sir, and General Aguinaldo\r\n    in this port of Singapore, and secure to us our independence\r\n    under the protection of the United States.'\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Pratt arose and 'proceeded, speaking in French,'\r\n    says the newspaper--it does not say Alabama French, but\r\n    that is doubtless what it was--'to state his belief that the\r\n    Filipinos would prove and were now proving themselves fit for\r\n    self-government.' The gentleman from Alabama then went on to\r\n    review the mighty events and developments of the preceding six\r\n    weeks, Dewey's victory of May 1st, 'the brilliant achievements\r\n    of your own distinguished leader, General Emilio Aguinaldo,\r\n    _cooperating on land with the Americans at sea_,' etc. 'You\r\n    have just reason to be proud of what has been and is being\r\n    accomplished by General Aguinaldo and your fellow-countrymen\r\n    under his command. When, six weeks ago, I learned that General\r\n    Aguinaldo had arrived _incognito_ in Singapore, I immediately\r\n    _sought him out_. An hour's interview convinced me that he\r\n    _was the man for the occasion_; and, having communicated\r\n    with Admiral Dewey, I accordingly arranged for him to join\r\n    the latter, which he did at Cavite. The rest you know.'\" [22]\r\n\r\nNow, it happens that Dr. Santos himself forwarded his speech, and\r\nhis version of Pratt's reply thereto, in a letter to Aguinaldo, dated\r\nSingapore, June 9, 1898. As he served as interpreter, he, if any one,\r\nshould know what Pratt said. After describing the change in tone of\r\nthe Singapore _Free Press_, with which strained relations had formerly\r\nexisted, and the subsequent friendliness of the editor of this paper\r\nand that of the _Straits Times_, he says that on the previous afternoon\r\nhe went with the other Filipinos to greet Pratt. He continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"This occasion was unusually opportune by reason of ours having\r\n    been victorious and immediately after the cry of our worthy\r\n    chief which found an echo in this colony. For this purpose 30\r\n    or more Filipinos--9 of the higher class, 15 musicians and the\r\n    remainder of the middle class--went to greet Consul A., here,\r\n    and on the invitation of Mr. Bray we ascended. He received us\r\n    in his private office, and it was imposing to see that the only\r\n    decoration was the American flag which covered the desk, and in\r\n    its centre, a carved wooden frame holding the portrait of our\r\n    worthy chief. He shook hands with all of us, and I introduced\r\n    them all. We found there also, and were introduced to, the\r\n    Editor of the _Straits Times_ and the _Free Press_ of here,\r\n    and after being thus assembled, after a musical selection,\r\n    I read the following speech in French:--\r\n\r\n        \"'_His Excellency, The Consul General of the United\r\n        States of America in Singapore_:\r\n\r\n        \"'_Your Excellency_: The Filipinos of all social\r\n        classes residing in this port, have come to greet\r\n        Your Excellency as the genuine representative of\r\n        the great and powerful American Republic in order to\r\n        express to you our eternal gratitude for the moral\r\n        and material support given by Admiral Dewey to our\r\n        General Aguinaldo in his campaign for the liberty of\r\n        eight million Filipinos. The latter and we ourselves\r\n        hope that the United States, your nation, persevering\r\n        in its humanitarian policy, will without cessation and\r\n        (with) decided energy continue to support the programme\r\n        agreed upon in Singapore between Your Excellency and\r\n        General Aguinaldo, that is to say, the Independence\r\n        of the Philippine Islands, under an American\r\n        protectorate. Accept our cordial acknowledgments and\r\n        congratulations on being the first one in accepting\r\n        and supporting this idea which time and events have\r\n        well developed to the great satisfaction of our\r\n        nation. Finally, we request you, Most Excellent Sir,\r\n        to express to your worthy President and the American\r\n        Republic, our sincere acknowledgments and our fervent\r\n        wishes for their prosperity. I have concluded.'\r\n\r\n    \"The Consul replied hereto in French, in more or less the\r\n    following terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"'You have nothing to thank me for, because I have only\r\n    faithfully followed the instructions received from my\r\n    Government; the fact of the sudden departure of your General\r\n    will permit you to infer that I have done so. I shall in any\r\n    case inform my Government of your good wishes and I thank you\r\n    in its name. You know that your wishes are mine also, and for\r\n    this reason at the last interview I had with Mr. Aguinaldo,\r\n    I repeated to him that he should observe the greatest humanity\r\n    possible in the war, in order that our army, our soldiers,\r\n    our nation and all the other nations may see that you are\r\n    humane and not savages, as has erroneously been believed.'\r\n\r\n    \"After this there was enthusiastic applause for the Consul;\r\n    he offered us all cigars, glasses of very fine sherry, and\r\n    lemonade for the musicians and the majority. The toasts were\r\n    offered with the sherry by your humble servant, Sres. Cannon,\r\n    Enríquez, Celio, Reyes, the Consul, the editors of the _Free\r\n    Press_, _Straits Times_ and Mr. Bray. We drank to America\r\n    and her humanitarian work of redemption; to the Philippines\r\n    with America; we gave thanks to the Consul, to Mr. Bray as an\r\n    important defender; we drank to the _Free Press_ for taking\r\n    such an interest in our affairs, and to the _Straits Times_\r\n    (sarcastically); but I was very careful not to propose a toast\r\n    to our general, which was done at the proper time by 'Flaco'\r\n    [23] when we gave three cheers; for the sake of courtesy we\r\n    cheered for England, which had been so hospitable to us, and\r\n    when everybody had become quiet, the Editor of the _Straits\r\n    Times_ took his glass in his hand and cried in a loud voice,\r\n    'The Philippine Republic,' to which we all responded. 'Flaco'\r\n    disappeared a moment, and when he returned he brought with\r\n    him the American flag, and formally presented it to us in\r\n    French, which I interpreted to all in Spanish, as follows:\r\n    'Gentlemen: The American Consul, with his deep affection for\r\n    us, presents us this flag as the greatest and most expressive\r\n    remembrance which he can give us. The red stripes stand for\r\n    the generous blood of her sons, shed to obtain her liberty;\r\n    the white stripes stand for her virginity and purity as our\r\n    country; the blue background indicates the sky and each star\r\n    represents a free and independent State; this is America, and\r\n    the Consul is desirous that we also should have so glorious\r\n    a history as hers and that it may be as brilliant as could\r\n    be wished, securing peace with respect, and may God be our\r\n    help and guide in securing liberty. Viva and with it our\r\n    most sincere thanks for so signal a courtesy.' Hereupon, to\r\n    the surprise of everybody as no one expected it, the Consul\r\n    requested that some Filipino airs be played which seemed to\r\n    please him very much. Finally, about 6.15, we left, very well\r\n    satisfied with the reception accorded us and the kindness\r\n    of the Consul. Mr. Bray asked me for the text of my speech,\r\n    which I insert above and I secured from the Consul his French\r\n    text, which I enclose in my letter to Naning. Without anything\r\n    further for the present, awaiting your reply and your opinion\r\n    as to the above, as also orders and instructions for the\r\n    future, I am,\r\n\r\n    \"Yours, etc.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"_Isidoro de los Santos_.\"\r\n\r\nTo this letter Major Taylor has appended the following note:--\r\n\r\n    \"(_Note by Compiler._--In a letter written in Tagalog to\r\n    Aguinaldo on June 6 by Santos he describes the American consul\r\n    general as having cried out 'Hurrah for General Aguinaldo,\r\n    hurrah for the Republic of the Philippines' and then, having\r\n    apparently taken several drinks, he passed up and down the\r\n    room waving the American flag before giving it to the assembled\r\n    Filipinos (P.I.R., 406.7).)\" [24]\r\n\r\nThis final statement does not present the representative of the United\r\nStates government at Singapore in a very favourable light, but I take\r\nthe facts as I find them. If now we compare the speech actually made\r\nby Dr. Santos with Blount's version of it, we shall find that with\r\nthe exception of the words \"eternal gratitude\" the passages which\r\nhe encloses in quotation marks are not in the original at all. The\r\nglories of independence are not alluded to, nor is there so much as\r\na suggestion that Aguinaldo had been enabled to arouse eight millions\r\nof Filipinos to take up arms, which he certainly had not done.\r\n\r\nDr. Santos in his speech did resort to a stereotyped Filipino procedure\r\nso very commonly employed that those of us who have dealt much with\r\nhis people have learned to meet it almost automatically. It consists\r\nin referring to one's having said just exactly what one did not say,\r\nand then if one fails to note the trap and avoid it, in claiming that\r\nbecause one did not deny the allegation one has admitted its truth.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo himself later repeatedly resorted to this procedure in his\r\ndealings with Dewey and others.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance Santos employed it rather cleverly when he\r\nexpressed the hope that the United States would \"continue to support\r\nthe programme agreed upon in Singapore, between your Excellency and\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo, that is to say, the independence of the Philippine\r\nIslands under an American protectorate.\"\r\n\r\nNow if this was agreed to, Aguinaldo later constantly violated his\r\npart of the agreement, for we shall see that he stated over and\r\nover again, in correspondence with members of the junta and others,\r\nthat a protectorate would be considered only if absolute independence\r\nfinally proved unattainable, but there is no reason to believe that\r\nany such agreement was made.\r\n\r\nDr. Santos read his speech to Mr. Pratt in French. Blount implies,\r\nwhether rightly or wrongly I do not know, that Pratt's knowledge\r\nof French was poor. At all events Pratt in his reply made not the\r\nslightest reference to the hope expressed by Santos that the United\r\nStates would continue to support the programme which Santos said\r\nhad been agreed upon between Pratt and Aguinaldo, and claim of a\r\npromise of independence based on these speeches must obviously be\r\nabandoned. There is no doubt that Pratt personally sympathized with\r\nthe ambitions of the Filipino leaders, and openly expressed his\r\nsympathy on this and other occasions, but to do this was one thing\r\nand to have attempted to compromise his government would have been\r\nanother and very different one. The shrewd Filipinos with whom he\r\nwas dealing understood this difference perfectly well.\r\n\r\nIt is a regrettable fact that there exists some reason to believe that\r\nhis sympathy was not purely disinterested. Aguinaldo claims that Pratt\r\nwished to be appointed \"representative of the Philippines in the United\r\nStates to promptly secure the official recognition of our independence\"\r\nand that he promised him \"a high post in the customs service.\" [25]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that several sentences and phrases in Blount's\r\nstatement are enclosed in quotation marks. From what were they\r\nquoted? The next paragraph in his book tells us:--\r\n\r\n    \"Says the newspaper clipping which has preserved the Pratt\r\n    oration: At the conclusion of Mr. Pratt's speech, refreshments\r\n    were served, and as the Filipinos, _being Christians,\r\n    drink alcohol_, there was no difficulty in arranging as to\r\n    refreshments.\" [26]\r\n\r\nThe use of this clipping from the Singapore _Free Press_ illustrates\r\nadmirably Blount's methods. The _Free Press_ had at first displayed\r\na marked coldness toward the insurgent cause, but its editor,\r\nMr. St. Clair, was opportunely \"seen\" by Bray, who reported that as a\r\nresult of his visit, both the editor and the paper would thereafter be\r\nfriendly, and they were. In other words, the _Free Press_ became the\r\nSingapore organ of the insurrection, and its editor, according to Bray,\r\n\"a true and loyal friend\" of Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nBlount claims to have made \"an exhaustive examination of the records\r\nof that period.\" [27] Why then did he use as evidence a newspaper\r\nclipping from an Insurgent organ, instead of Santos's letter?\r\n\r\nBlount endeavours to make capital out of the fact that Pratt forwarded\r\nto the State Department a proclamation which he says was gotten up\r\nby the Insurgent leaders at Hongkong and sent to the Philippines in\r\nadvance of Aguinaldo's coming. He says that it was headed \"America's\r\nAllies\" and quotes from it as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Compatriots: Divine Providence is about to place independence\r\n    within our reach.... The Americans, not from mercenary\r\n    motives, but for the sake of humanity and the lamentations\r\n    of so many persecuted people, have considered it opportune,\r\n    etc. [Here follows a reference to Cuba.] At the present\r\n    moment an American squadron is preparing to sail for the\r\n    Philippines.... The Americans will attack by sea and prevent\r\n    any reënforcements coming from Spain; ... we insurgents must\r\n    attack by land. Probably you will have more than sufficient\r\n    arms, because the Americans have arms and will find means\r\n    to assist us. _There where you see the American flag flying,\r\n    assemble in numbers; they are our redeemers!_\" [28]\r\n\r\nThe translation that he used is that given in Senate Document No. 62,\r\nL. 60, and is none too accurate. He allows it to be inferred that\r\nthis proclamation was actually issued. It was not. Its history is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1898, J. M. Basa, a Filipino, who had lived in Hongkong\r\nsince 1872, on account of his connection with the troubles of that\r\nyear, wrote letters [29] to a number of friends recommending the\r\nwidest possible circulation of a proclamation enclosed therewith, as\r\nan aid to the American policy in the Philippines \"in the war against\r\nthe tyrannical friars and the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nWith these letters there were sent two different proclamations,\r\neach beginning with the words \"Fellow Countrymen.\" The first, which\r\nis the one referred to by Blount, continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"Divine Providence places us in a position to secure our\r\n    independence, and this under the freest form to which all\r\n    individuals, all people, all countries, may aspire.\r\n\r\n    \"The Americans, more for humanity than for self-interest,\r\n    attentive to the complaints of so many persecuted Filipinos,\r\n    find it opportune to extend to our Philippines their protective\r\n    mantle, now that they find themselves obliged to break their\r\n    friendship with the Spanish people, because of the tyranny\r\n    they have exercised in Cuba, causing all Americans, with whom\r\n    they have great commercial relations, enormous damages.\r\n\r\n    \"At this moment an American fleet is prepared to go to the\r\n    Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"We, your fellow-countrymen, fear that you will make use of\r\n    your arms to fire upon the Americans. No, brothers; do not\r\n    make such a mistake; rather (shoot) kill yourselves than\r\n    treat our liberators as enemies.\r\n\r\n    \"Do not pay attention to the decree of Primo de Rivera,\r\n    calling on you to enlist for the war, for that will cost\r\n    you your lives: rather die than act as ingrates toward our\r\n    redeemers, the Americans.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Note well that the Americans have to attack by sea, at the\r\n    same time avoiding reinforcements which may come from Spain;\r\n    therefore the insurrection must attack by land. Perhaps you\r\n    will have more than sufficient arms, as the Americans have\r\n    arms, and will find the means to aid you.\r\n\r\n    \"Whenever you see the American flag, bear in mind that they\r\n    are our redeemers.\" [30]\r\n\r\nOn the margin is written: \"Viva, for America with the Philippines!\"\r\n\r\nApparently what Basa here means by independence is independence from\r\nSpain, for it is known that he was in favour of annexation to the\r\nUnited States, and in the second proclamation we find the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"This is the best opportunity which we have ever had for\r\n    contriving that our country (all the Philippine Archipelago)\r\n    may be counted as another Star in the Great Republic of\r\n    the United States, great because of its wisdom, its wealth,\r\n    and its constitutional laws.\r\n\r\n    \"Now is the time to offer ourselves to that great nation. With\r\n    America we shall have development in the broadest sense\r\n    (of advancement) in civilization.\r\n\r\n    \"With America we shall be rich, civilized and happy.\r\n\r\n    \"Fellow patriots, add your signatures to those which have\r\n    already been given. Explain to all our fellow countrymen the\r\n    benefits of this change, which will be blessed by Heaven,\r\n    by men and by our children.\r\n\r\n    \"Viva America with the Philippines!!!\" [31]\r\n\r\nThe letters were undoubtedly given to Aguinaldo for delivery on his\r\narrival. They were never delivered, and it is reasonable to suppose,\r\nespecially as Basa, who was a man of importance and means, was a\r\nmember of the group who desired annexation to the United States, that\r\nAguinaldo took the letters along in order to avoid a rupture with him\r\nand then quietly suppressed them. Obviously, however, he sent or gave\r\na copy of the first one to Pratt, presumably without the written words:\r\n\"Viva, for America with the Philippines!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now comes a bit of evidence as to what occurred at Singapore\r\nwhich I consider incontrovertible.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo returned promptly to Hongkong and on May 4, 1898, a meeting\r\nof the junta was held. The minutes of this meeting, [32] signed by\r\neach of the several Filipinos present, form a part of the Insurgent\r\nrecords which have come into the possession of the United States\r\nGovernment. They state among other things that:--\r\n\r\n    \"The temporary Secretary read the minutes of the preceding\r\n    meeting, which were approved. The temporary President reported\r\n    that D. Emilio Aguinaldo had just arrived from Singapore and\r\n    it became necessary for him to take possession of the office\r\n    to which he has been elected.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the transaction of some further business Aguinaldo was summoned,\r\nappeared at the meeting, and was duly installed as President. Then:--\r\n\r\n    \"The President described the negotiations which took place\r\n    during his absence in Singapore with the American Consul of\r\n    that English colony. Both agreed that the President should\r\n    confer with the Admiral commanding the American squadron in\r\n    Mirs Bay, and if the latter should accept his propositions,\r\n    advantageous, in his judgment, to the Philippines, he would go\r\n    to said country in one of the cruisers which form the fleet\r\n    for the purpose of taking part in the present events. And\r\n    as he did not find the Admiral, he thought it well to have\r\n    an interview with the American Consul of this colony on the\r\n    day of his arrival, but was not satisfied with such interview.\r\n\r\n    \"Considering the critical conditions in the Philippines at\r\n    present, he begged the committee to discuss the advisability of\r\n    his going to said islands with all the leaders of prominence\r\n    in the last rebellion residing in this colony, in case the\r\n    Admiral gave them an opportunity to do so.\"\r\n\r\nNote that there is here absolutely not one word of any promise\r\nof independence made to Aguinaldo by Pratt or any one else. Is it\r\nconceivable that Aguinaldo in describing \"the negotiations which\r\ntook place during his absence in Singapore with the American Consul\r\nof the English Colony\" would, by any chance, have failed to inform\r\nhis associates in Hongkong of such an extraordinary and fortunate\r\noccurrence as the promising by Mr. Pratt and Admiral Dewey that the\r\nUnited States would recognize Philippine independence?\r\n\r\nSandico [33] thought that Aguinaldo ought to go, for--\r\n\r\n    \"From conferences which he had with the Admiral of the\r\n    American fleet and with the American Consul in this colony,\r\n    he believed that under present conditions it was absolutely\r\n    necessary for the President to go to the Philippines, since,\r\n    according to the American Consul, Manila had been taken by\r\n    said fleet, and a provisional government was now being formed\r\n    in that capital. The intervention of the President in the\r\n    formation of that government is undoubtedly essential, since\r\n    his prestige, which everybody recognizes, would evidently\r\n    prevent dissensions among the sons of the country, and it\r\n    would be possible thereby to obtain a perfect organization\r\n    both for the military and civil evolution of that country.\r\n\r\n    \"Srs. Garchitorena [34] and Apacible [35] expressed themselves\r\n    in similar terms. Notwithstanding the previous remarks,\r\n    the President insisted that he considered it reckless for\r\n    him to go to the Philippines without first making a written\r\n    agreement with the Admiral, as it might happen, if he placed\r\n    himself at his orders, that he might make him subscribe to\r\n    or sign a document containing proposals highly prejudicial\r\n    to the interests of the country, from which might arise the\r\n    following two very grave contingencies:\r\n\r\n    \"1st. If he should accept them, he would undoubtedly commit\r\n    an unpatriotic act, and his name would justly be eternally\r\n    cursed by the Filipinos.\r\n\r\n    \"2d. If he should refuse, then the break between the two\r\n    would be evident.\r\n\r\n    \"And to avoid this sad dilemma, he proposed to the committee\r\n    that the four parties (?) of the insurgents now here, under\r\n    charge of the competent chiefs authorized in writing by him,\r\n    should go to the Philippines to intervene, after a conference\r\n    with the Admiral, in these important questions; such means,\r\n    in his opinion, should be first employed to ascertain in an\r\n    authentic manner what the intentions of the United States\r\n    in regard to that country are; and if his intervention is\r\n    absolutely necessary, he would not object to go at once to\r\n    the Philippines, endeavouring by all the means in his power\r\n    to remedy the critical condition of the country, to which he\r\n    had offered, and always would willingly offer, to sacrifice\r\n    his life.\"\r\n\r\nWhy adopt means to learn from the admiral what the intentions of the\r\nUnited States were in regard to the Philippines if both he and Pratt\r\nhad already promised recognition of independence?\r\n\r\n    \"Srs. Sandico, Garchitorena, Gonzaga [36] and Apacible\r\n    replied that they were fully convinced the Admiral of the\r\n    American squadron would furnish the President all the arms\r\n    which he might desire, since the former was convinced that\r\n    the fleet could do nothing in the Philippines unless it were\r\n    used in conjunction  with the insurgents in the development\r\n    of their plans of war against the Spanish government.... The\r\n    authority to treat which the President desired to give to the\r\n    other chiefs, without reflecting at all upon their personal\r\n    qualifications, they did not believe would be as efficacious\r\n    as his personal intervention which is necessary in grave\r\n    affairs, such as those the subject of discussion; there would\r\n    be no better occasion than that afforded them to insure the\r\n    landing of the expeditionary forces on those islands and to\r\n    arm themselves at the expense of the Americans and to assure\r\n    the situation of the Philippines in regard to our legitimate\r\n    aspirations against those very people. The Filipino people,\r\n    unprovided with arms, would be the victims of the demands\r\n    and exactions of the United States; but, provided with arms,\r\n    would be able to oppose themselves to them, struggling for\r\n    independence, in which consists the true happiness of the\r\n    Philippines. And they finished by saying that it made no\r\n    difference if the Spanish government did demand the return\r\n    of the P400,000, and if the demand were allowed in an action,\r\n    since the object of the sum would be obtained by the Admiral\r\n    furnishing the Filipinos the arms which they required for\r\n    the struggle for their legitimate aspirations.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a definite plan to obtain arms from the Americans to\r\nbe used if necessary \"against those very people\" later.\r\n\r\n    \"The President, with his prestige in the Philippines, would be\r\n    able to arouse those masses to combat the demands of the United\r\n    States, if they colonized that country, and would drive them,\r\n    if circumstances rendered it necessary, to a Titanic struggle\r\n    for their independence, even if they should succumb in shaking\r\n    off the yoke of a new oppressor. If Washington proposed to\r\n    carry out the fundamental principles of its constitution,\r\n    there was no doubt that it would not attempt to colonize the\r\n    Philippines, or even to annex them. It was probable then that\r\n    it would give them independence and guarantee it; in such\r\n    case the presence of the President was necessary, as he would\r\n    prevent dissensions among the sons of the country who sought\r\n    office, who might cause the intervention of European powers, an\r\n    intervention which there was no reason to doubt would be highly\r\n    prejudicial to the interests of the country.... What injury\r\n    could come to the Philippines, even if we admitted that the\r\n    Admiral would not give arms to the President on account of his\r\n    refusal to sign a document prejudicial to the country, after\r\n    he had taken all means to provide for her defence? None. Such\r\n    an act of the President could not be censured, but, on the\r\n    other hand, would be most meritorious, because it would be\r\n    one proof more of his undoubted patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nNot one word of any promise of independence do we find in this\r\nremarkable document. On the contrary it furnishes conclusive proof\r\nthat no such promise had been made and that the future relations\r\nbetween Filipinos and Americans were still completely uncertain.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes some direct evidence. Bray and St. Clair, the latter\r\nthe editor of the Insurgent organ in Singapore, were present on\r\nthe occasion when independence was said to have been promised by\r\nPratt. Bray subsequently declared in the most positive terms that it\r\nwas promised. St. Clair wrote him a letter taking him roundly to task\r\nfor this claim, in the following very interesting terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"I felt it to be my duty to let Pratt know that you still hold\r\n    that you and Santos have evidence that will controvert his,\r\n    (and) he was, of course, extremely disappointed, because he\r\n    (is) quite aware of what took place in Spanish, and as to\r\n    turning of his conversation into a pretense of agreement\r\n    he knows nothing. He says very truly: 'My own party, the\r\n    Democrats, will say if they read this book--If this man takes\r\n    it upon himself to be a Plenipotentiary without authority, we\r\n    had better not employ him any more--I frankly cannot understand\r\n    your action, as to its unwisdom I have no doubt at all.'\r\n\r\n    \"Admiral Dewey goes home, it is believed, to advise the\r\n    President on Naval and Colonial Affairs, he knows exactly\r\n    what did take place and what did not, and I should know if\r\n    he had any ground to think that the slightest promise was\r\n    made by Pratt to Aguinaldo he would declare it unauthorized\r\n    and decline to sanction it. I am certain Pratt reported what\r\n    he supposed took place accurately; he had no surety on what\r\n    you might have said, naturally.\r\n\r\n    \"And, curiously, you never mentioned to me anything of\r\n    the agreement as having taken place then, nor in the paper\r\n    you communicated to me was there any mention of one, nor\r\n    did Pratt know of any. It is only more recently that the\r\n    fiction took shape. 'The wish father to the thought,' or\r\n    the statement repeated till it has become believed by the--,\r\n    [37] this is common.\r\n\r\n    \"Now I would like to urge you, from the practical point\r\n    of view, to drop any such foolishness. The vital thing,\r\n    and nothing else counts, is what Dewey said and did when\r\n    he at last met Aguinaldo. That, that, that, is the thing,\r\n    all else is empty wind.\r\n\r\n    \"Supposing that Pratt and Wildman had covered inches of\r\n    paper with 'Clauses' and put on a ton of sealing wax as\r\n    consular seals, what, pray, to any common sense mind would\r\n    all that have been worth? Nothing!! Nothing!! And yet,\r\n    where is the agreement, where is the seal? Where are there\r\n    any signatures? And if you had them--waste paper--believe\r\n    me, that all this potter about Pratt and Wildman is energy\r\n    misdirected. The sole thing to have impressed upon the\r\n    public in America would be the chaining of Dewey and\r\n    Aguinaldo together as participants in common action; you\r\n    surely comprehend this means! Think and think again; it\r\n    means success as far as it is possible. The other work is\r\n    not only lost, but does not gain much sympathy, especially\r\n    this criticism of the conduct of American troops; things may\r\n    be true that are not expedient to say. Sink everything into\r\n    Dewey-Aguinaldo coöperation, that was on both sides honest\r\n    even if it did not imply any actual arrangement, which, of\r\n    course, Dewey himself could not make. That here you have the\r\n    facts,--undenied--incontrovertible.\" [38]\r\n\r\nThe following letter of Bray to Aguinaldo, dated January 12, 1899,\r\nseems to me to throw much light on the question of how these claims\r\nrelative to the promised recognition of Filipino independence sometimes\r\noriginated and were bolstered up:--\r\n\r\n    \"With regard to your proclamation, there is still a trump card\r\n    to be played. Did you not say that the basis of any negotiation\r\n    in Singapore was the Independence of the Philippines under an\r\n    American protectorate? This is what Consul Pratt telegraphed\r\n    and to which Dewey and Washington agreed; as I figured up\r\n    the 'price' of the telegram, I know very well what occurred,\r\n    and I am ready to state it and to swear to it when the proper\r\n    time comes. There are five of us against one in the event of\r\n    Consul Pratt receiving instructions to deny it. Furthermore,\r\n    Mr. St. Clair knows what happened and I am certain that he\r\n    also would testify. St. Clair still has the rough draft as\r\n    an historical relic, and St. Clair is a true and loyal friend\r\n    of yours, as is your humble servant.\" [39]\r\n\r\nThe utter unscrupulousness of Bray is shown by his claim that St. Clair\r\nwould confirm his false statements, made as it was after receiving\r\nSt. Clair's letter above quoted.\r\n\r\nBut Bray did not wait for Aguinaldo to play this trump card. He tried\r\nto play it himself by cabling Senator Hoar, on the same day, that as\r\nthe man who introduced General Aguinaldo to the American government\r\nthrough the consul at Singapore he was prepared to swear that the\r\nconditions under which Aguinaldo promised to cooperate with Dewey\r\nwere independence under a protectorate. [40]\r\n\r\nLet us now trace Aguinaldo's subsequent movements, and see what\r\npromises, if any, were made to him by Wildman and Dewey. He had\r\nreturned to Hongkong with two companions, all travelling under assumed\r\nnames. Only his most trusted friends among the members of the junta\r\nwere at first allowed to know where he was living.\r\n\r\nHis situation was a difficult one. It was necessary for him to come\r\nto some sort of a temporary arrangement with Artacho, if he was to\r\navoid legal difficulties, and to reëstablish himself with some of\r\nhis companions, who had accused him of deserting with the intention\r\nof going to Europe to live on money which belonged to them. When\r\nharmony had been temporarily restored through the good offices of\r\nSandico, Aguinaldo had an interview with Consul General Wildman. He\r\nhas since claimed that Wildman, too, promised him independence, but\r\nthe truth seems to be that he himself said he was anxious to become\r\nan American citizen. This being impossible, he wanted to return to\r\nthe Philippines and place himself under Dewey's orders. He wanted to\r\nhelp throw off the yoke of Spain, and this done, would abide by the\r\ndecision of the United States as to the fate of the Philippines. [41]\r\n\r\nAny claim that Aguinaldo had been promised independence by Wildman, or,\r\nindeed, that the latter had been allowed to know that the Filipinos\r\ndesired it, seems to me to be negatived, not only by Wildman's own\r\nstatements, but by a letter from Agoncillo to Aguinaldo written on\r\nAugust 5, 1908, in which he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The American consul left my house to-day at 3 o'clock, as I\r\n    had requested an interview with him before his departure, and\r\n    I was unable to go to the Consulate on account of the swelling\r\n    of my feet. From our conversation I infer that independence\r\n    will be given to us. I did not, however, disclose to him\r\n    our true desires.... Said consul approved my telegram to\r\n    McKinley, which has been sent to-day through him, a copy of\r\n    which is herewith enclosed. If they accept our representative\r\n    in the commission, we may arrive at a friendly understanding,\r\n    and it will enable us to prepare for the fight in case they\r\n    refuse to listen to our request. On the other hand, if at\r\n    the very beginning they refuse to admit our representative,\r\n    we will at once be in a position to know what should be done,\r\n    _i.e._ to prepare for war.\" [42]\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 1898, the Hongkong junta voted that Aguinaldo ought to go\r\nto the Philippines, and go he did. It would seem that he at first gave\r\nup the idea of joining Dewey, for on May 11 he wrote a cipher letter,\r\ngiving minute directions for the preparation of signals to assist\r\nhis ship in making land, by day or by night, at Dingalan Bay on the\r\neast coast of Luzon; directing the capture of the town of San Antonio,\r\njust back of Capones Islands, in Zambales, and ending with the words:\r\n\"We will surely arrive at one of the two places above mentioned,\r\nso you must be prepared.\"\r\n\r\nSomething led him again to change his mind, and he finally sailed on\r\nthe _McCulloch_.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Reseña Verídica\" written later for political purposes,\r\nAguinaldo has definitely claimed that Dewey promised him that\r\nthe United States would recognize the independence of the Filipino\r\npeople. I will let him tell his own story, confronting his statements\r\nwith those of the admiral.\r\n\r\n    \"May 19, 1898.\r\n\r\n    \"The _McCulloch_ started at eleven o'clock on the morning of\r\n    the 17th of May for the Philippines; we anchored, between\r\n    twelve and one o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th, in\r\n    the waters of Cavite, and immediately the launch of the\r\n    Admiral--with his aid and private secretary--came to convey\r\n    me to the _Olympia_, where I was received, with my aid,\r\n    Sr. Leyva, with the honors of a general, by a section of\r\n    marine guards.\" [43]\r\n\r\nRelative to this matter, Admiral Dewey has testified: [44]\r\n\r\n    \"_The Chairman_. You, of course, never saluted the flag?\r\n\r\n    _Admiral Dewey_. Certainly not; and I do not think I ever\r\n    called Aguinaldo anything but Don Emilio; I don't think I\r\n    ever called him 'General.'\r\n\r\n    _The Chairman_. And when he came on board ship was he received\r\n    with any special honors at the side?\r\n\r\n    _Admiral Dewey_. Never.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Reseña Verídica\" continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Admiral received me in a salon, and after greetings of\r\n    courtesy I asked him 'if all the telegrams relative to myself\r\n    which he had addressed to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt,\r\n    were true.' He replied in the affirmative, and added, 'that\r\n    the United States had come to the Philippines to protect its\r\n    natives and free them from the yoke of Spain.'\r\n\r\n    He said, moreover, that 'America was rich in territory and\r\n    money, and needed no colonies,' concluding by assuring me,\r\n    'to have no doubt whatever about the recognition of Philippine\r\n    independence by the United States.' Thereupon he asked me\r\n    if I could get the people to arise against the Spaniards and\r\n    carry on a rapid campaign.\" [45]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Dewey sent only one telegram to Pratt about\r\nAguinaldo. It merely directed that the latter be sent.\r\n\r\n    \"I then expressed to him my profound acknowledgment for the\r\n    generous help which the United States was giving the Filipino\r\n    people, as well as my admiration for the magnificence and\r\n    goodness of the American people. I also stated to him that\r\n    'before leaving Hongkong, the Filipino Colony had held a\r\n    meeting, at which was discussed and considered the possibility\r\n    that--after defeating the Spaniards--the Filipinos might have a\r\n    war with the Americans, if they should refuse to recognize our\r\n    independence, who were sure to defeat us because they should\r\n    find us tired out, poor in ammunitions and worn out in the war\r\n    against the Spaniards,' requesting that he pardon my frankness.\r\n\r\n    \"The Admiral replied that he 'was delighted at my sincerity,\r\n    and believed that both Filipinos and Americans should treat\r\n    each other as allies and friends, clearly explaining all\r\n    doubts for the better understanding between both parties,' and\r\n    added that, 'so he had been informed, the United States would\r\n    recognize the independence of the Filipino people, guaranteed\r\n    by the word of honor of the Americans,--more binding than\r\n    documents which may remain unfulfilled when it is desired\r\n    to fail in them as happened with the compacts signed by the\r\n    Spaniards, advising me to form at once a Filipino national\r\n    flag, offering in virtue thereof to recognize and protect\r\n    it before the other nations, which were represented by the\r\n    various squadrons then in the Bay; although he said we should\r\n    conquer the power from the Spaniards before floating said\r\n    flag, so that the act should be more honourable in the sight\r\n    of the whole world, and, above all, before the United States,\r\n    in order that when the Filipino ships with their national\r\n    flag would pass before the foreign squadrons they should\r\n    inspire respect and esteem.'\r\n\r\n    \"Again I thanked the Admiral for his good advice and generous\r\n    offers, informing him that if the sacrifice of my life was\r\n    necessary to honor the Admiral before the United States,\r\n    I was then ready to sacrifice it.\r\n\r\n    \"I added that under such conditions I could assure him that\r\n    all the Filipino people would unite in the revolution to\r\n    shake off the yoke of Spain; that it was not strange that\r\n    some few were not yet on his side on account of lack of arms\r\n    or because of personal expediency.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus ended this first conference with Admiral Dewey, to whom\r\n    I announced that I would take up my residence at the Naval\r\n    Headquarters in the Cavite Arsenal.\" [46]\r\n\r\nFurther on, in the same document, Aguinaldo advances the claim that\r\non the occasion of the visit of General Anderson and Admiral Dewey\r\nthe latter again promised him independence.\r\n\r\nHe says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the same month of July, the Admiral, accompanied by General\r\n    Anderson, presented himself, and after greetings of courtesy\r\n    said to me: 'You have seen confirmed all of what I promised\r\n    and said to you. How pretty your flag is. It has a triangle,\r\n    and it looks like Cuba's. Will you give me one as a reminder\r\n    when I return to America?'\r\n\r\n    \"I replied to him that I was convinced of his word of\r\n    honour and that there was no necessity whatever to draw up\r\n    in documentary form his agreements, and as for the flag,\r\n    that he could count on it, even at that very moment.\r\n\r\n    \"Dewey continued: 'Documents are not complied with when\r\n    there is no honour, as has happened with your agreement\r\n    with the Spaniards, who have failed in what was written\r\n    and signed. Trust in my word for I hold myself responsible\r\n    that the United States will recognize the independence of\r\n    the country. But I recommend to you [plural.--TR.] to keep\r\n    everything which we have talked about and agreed upon with\r\n    a great deal of secrecy for the present. And, moreover,\r\n    I entreat you [plural.--TR.] to be patient if our soldiers\r\n    should insult some Filipino, because, as volunteers, they\r\n    are yet lacking in discipline.'\" [47]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey has testified as follows, concerning the recognition\r\nof Philippine independence by him:--\r\n\r\n    \"_The Chairman_. You remember the question of your recognizing\r\n    his republic was a good deal discussed and you wrote me a\r\n    letter, which I read in the senate. Of course, I am only\r\n    asking now about what you said in the letter. There was no\r\n    recognition of the republic?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Never. I did not think I had any authority to\r\n    do it and it never occurred to me to do it. There was a sort\r\n    of a reign of terror; there was no government. These people\r\n    had got power for the first time in their lives and they\r\n    were riding roughshod over the community. The acts of cruelty\r\n    which were brought to my notice were hardly credible. I sent\r\n    word to Aguinaldo that he must treat his prisoners kindly,\r\n    and he said he would.\"\r\n\r\nHe has further testified that he never as much as heard of independence\r\nuntil the appearance of Aguinaldo's proclamation of June 15, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_.... Then when I heard that our troops were\r\n    coming I asked him to withdraw his troops from Cavite and make\r\n    room for our men. He demurred at this, but finally withdrew\r\n    and established headquarters across the bay at a place called\r\n    Bacoor, from which place on the 15th of June he sent me a\r\n    proclamation declaring the independence of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"_The Chairman_. Was that the first?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. That was the first intimation; the first\r\n    I had ever heard of independence of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"_The Chairman_. He had said something to you--\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Not a word. He had done what I told him. He\r\n    was most obedient; whatever I told him to do he did. I attached\r\n    so little importance to this proclamation that I did not even\r\n    cable its contents to Washington, but forwarded it through\r\n    the mails. I never dreamed that they wanted independence.\"\r\n\r\nRemembering that Admiral Dewey was not being interrogated as to the\r\nstatements of the \"Reseña Veridica,\" it will be seen that he has,\r\nnevertheless, covered them fully.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to be long and intimately associated with\r\nAdmiral Dewey while serving on the first Philippine commission. He\r\nalways grew indignant when the subject of any promises relative to\r\nindependence said to have been made by him was so much as mentioned,\r\nand gave to the commission in writing the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"The statement of Emilio Aguinaldo, under date of Sept. 23,\r\n    published in the _Springfield Republican_, so far as it\r\n    relates to reported conversations with me, or actions of mine,\r\n    is a tissue of falsehood. I never, directly or indirectly,\r\n    promised the Filipinos independence. I never received Aguinaldo\r\n    with military honors, or recognized or saluted the so-called\r\n    Filipino flag. I never considered him as an ally, although\r\n    I did make use of him and the natives to assist me in my\r\n    operations against the Spaniards.\" [48]\r\n\r\nAs Dewey's allegations flatly contradict those of Aguinaldo, we\r\nmust choose between the two. While I have no doubt as to where\r\nthe choice will fall, I will now submit some additional matter of\r\ninterest. Let us first consider the history of the \"Reseña Verídica\"\r\nin which Aguinaldo makes the charges above quoted. On September 12,\r\n1899, Buencamino wrote of it to Apacible in Hongkong, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"This work is entitled 'Reseña Verídica de la Revolución\r\n    Filipina' in which Don Emilio relates in detail his acts with\r\n    Admiral Dewey. It has been distributed to the Consuls and\r\n    you are ordered to reprint it there translated into English\r\n    and send some copies to the United States, even though only\r\n    a thousand, if you deem it advisable. Send copies also to\r\n    Europe, Señor Agoncillo taking charge of the publication. If\r\n    the Agent you may have selected for the United States should\r\n    still be there, it would be advisable for him to take a copy\r\n    of the pamphlet with him for its publication.\r\n\r\n    \"This is an order of the Government which I take pleasure in\r\n    transmitting to you for due execution.\" [49]\r\n\r\nBut there was a change of heart about giving the pamphlet to the\r\nconsuls, for under date of September 30 Buencamino wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have not distributed them here in order that Otis may\r\n    not counteract the effects that we desire to produce with\r\n    this publication, through his usual machinations. Nor do we\r\n    believe it advisable to make this pamphlet public in those\r\n    colonies before your arrival in the United States.\" [50]\r\n\r\nTo this letter he added in cipher the following postscript to Pablo\r\nOcampo, in charge of Aguinaldo's correspondence in Manila:--\r\n\r\n    \"At last moment--Nota bene:\r\n\r\n    \"Don't deliver any copy of the 'Reseña Verídica' to the\r\n    Consuls, even though it was so directed in the beginning of\r\n    the letter. All except one, which is for you, will be sent\r\n    to Hong-kong, Don Pedro de la Viña being bearer of the same,\r\n    as also of the other documents. The copy intended for you\r\n    is neither to be divulged nor published, for strict reserve\r\n    is required until those which are being sent arrive at their\r\n    destination.\" [51]\r\n\r\nThe reason for preserving such secrecy relative to this document\r\nuntil it could reach its destination and work its harm is of course\r\nobvious. Its statements were so outrageously false that they would\r\nhave been instantly and authoritatively contradicted had it been\r\nissued seasonably at Manila.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Aguinaldo's claim that he had been promised\r\nindependence was a gradual growth. Let us trace it.\r\n\r\nOn May 21, he wrote a circular letter to \"My dear brother,\" inviting\r\nthe recipients and their companions to meet him at once, and arrange\r\nthe best way to entrap all the enemy in their homes.\r\n\r\nIn this he says that he has promised the American admiral that they\r\nwill \"carry on modern war\" and adds: \"Even if a Spaniard surrenders,\r\nhe must be pardoned and treated well, and then you will see that\r\nour reputation will be very good in all Europe, which will declare\r\nfor our independence; but if we do not conduct ourselves thus, the\r\nAmericans will decide to sell us or else divide up our territory. As\r\nthey will hold us incapable of governing our land, we shall not secure\r\nour liberty, rather the contrary; our own soil will be delivered over\r\nto other hands.\" [52]\r\n\r\nIn this letter, written on the very day of the interview at which he\r\nsubsequently claimed that Admiral Dewey had promised independence,\r\ndoes he make any claim that this had occurred? No, he very distinctly\r\nimplies the contrary. Is it believable that if he could truly have\r\nsaid \"The United States, through its representatives Dewey and Pratt,\r\nhas promised to recognize our independence\" he would have failed to\r\ndo so when this would instantly have secured him the vigorous support\r\nwhich he was then uncertain of obtaining? I think not.\r\n\r\nIn this letter Aguinaldo specifically directs that deceit be employed\r\nand that Spanish officers be treacherously attacked. The practising of\r\ndeceit was a carefully considered part of the insurgent policy. In a\r\nletter from Hongkong dated July 21, 1898, Agoncillo writes as follows\r\nto Mabini: [53]--\r\n\r\n    \"the time will come when disguises must be set aside and\r\n    we will see who is deceiving whom. The statements made by\r\n    some of the commanders of the fleet here to Don Emilio and\r\n    myself were to the effect that the exclusive purpose of the\r\n    Government at Washington with regard to the Filipinos, is to\r\n    grant this country independence, without any conditions,\r\n    although I said to myself that such a purpose was too\r\n    philanthropical. Don Emilio knew what I thought then, and\r\n    I still think the same; that is to say that we are the ones\r\n    who must secure the independence of our country by means of\r\n    unheard of sacrifices and thus work out its happiness.\" [54]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo himself frankly advocated the use of deceit. He practised\r\nwhat he preached. Simeon Villa, one of his companions on his\r\nsubsequent flight through Northern Luzon, before he finally took\r\nrefuge at Palanan, kept a diary, which constitutes an official record\r\nof this long journey. In it he has inserted some bits of history of\r\nother days, of which none is more interesting than his account of the\r\nbeginning of hostilities against the Spaniards, in August, 1896. From\r\nit we learn that Aguinaldo, who was known to the friar of his town to\r\nbe both a mason and a chief of the Katipúnan, was in danger during\r\nAugust, and on the night of the 29th of that month called a meeting\r\nof all the compromised persons of the place, who agreed that on the\r\nfollowing day he should \"make representations to the governor of the\r\nprovince.\" Villa says that he was greatly beloved by the governor and\r\nhis wife. Early on the following morning, he \"presented himself to the\r\ngovernor, and in the name of the people of Cavite Viejo, offered him\r\ntheir respects and their loyalty to Spain,\" at the same time asking\r\na garrison of a hundred men for his town, which the governor promised\r\nto send at once if the captain-general approved.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon he reported the results of his efforts to his\r\nfellow-conspirators, \"and told them that then was the opportune moment\r\nfor rising against the Spaniards.\" He initiated the uprising himself\r\nthe next morning. [55]\r\n\r\nCould deceit be more deliberately practised or treachery more frankly\r\nemployed?\r\n\r\nI have indulged in this digression to show that Aguinaldo could\r\nhardly have complained had the methods which he used against others\r\nbeen employed against him. He was never deceived by the Americans,\r\nbut his claims relative to independence grew rapidly, and he was soon\r\ndeceiving his own people.\r\n\r\nOn May 24th, he issued no less than four proclamations. One of\r\nthese, doubtless intended to be seen by Americans, made no mention\r\nof Independence, but said: [56]--\r\n\r\n\"The great powerful North American nation has offered its disinterested\r\nprotection to secure the liberty of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn another proclamation, doubtless intended for a different use,\r\nhe made the statement that the great North American nation had come\r\nto give decisive and disinterested protection, \"considering us as\r\nsufficiently civilized and capable of governing ourselves.\" [57]\r\n\r\nOn June 5, having practically gained control of Cavite Province, he\r\nfelt strong enough to announce that independence would be proclaimed\r\non June 12, and on that date he did proclaim it in a decree.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral of the American Squadron, with the commanders and officers\r\nof his command, was invited to the ceremonies, but none of them\r\nwent. As it was important for Aguinaldo to have some one there to\r\npose as a representative of the United States, he utilized for this\r\npurpose a certain \"Colonel\" Johnson, an ex-hotel keeper of Shanghai,\r\nwho was running a cinematograph show. He appeared as Aguinaldo's chief\r\nof artillery and the representative of the North American nation. [58]\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven as late as October 3, 1898, Agoncillo in a memorandum addressed to\r\nPresident McKinley did not claim that independence had been promised,\r\nbut said:--\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as the Spanish-American war began, the American\r\n    representatives and officials in Singapore, Hongkong and\r\n    Manila, invited the natives of the Philippines to assist\r\n    the American arms, which they did gladly and loyally, as\r\n    allies, with the conviction that their personality would\r\n    be recognized, as well as their political, autonomous and\r\n    sovereign rights.\" [59]\r\n\r\nIn it he does, however, claim that the organization of a government\r\nindependent of America and Spain was accomplished with the tacit\r\nconsent of the admiral commanding the fleet and with that of the\r\ngeneral and military and political commanders of the United States\r\nof North America in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"Who, knowing these facts, not only did not object but accepted\r\n    them as a consummated legal act, and maintained official\r\n    relations with the new organization, making use thereof in\r\n    its subsequent actions and for the subsequent development of\r\n    the campaign, which was consequently brought to such a happy\r\n    end.\" [60]\r\n\r\nThis is a second illustration of the stereotyped insurgent procedure\r\nof announcing a policy and then claiming that failure to attack it\r\nmeant acquiescence in it. Admiral Dewey says that he did not even read\r\nthis proclamation. There was no reason why he should have done so,\r\nas it did not deal with matters which he was authorized to settle. He\r\nhad no instructions relative to the recognition of new governments,\r\nand he sent this document to Washington without comment, as he should\r\nhave done. [61]\r\n\r\nApropos of this claim that American officers tacitly recognized\r\nthe Insurgent government, certain passages from an unsigned\r\ndocument in the handwriting of Mabini, prepared about July 15,\r\n1898, are of interest. Mabini, speaking of the attitude of the\r\nAmericans, says, \"Notwithstanding all this and in spite of their\r\nprotestations of friendship, they have always refused to recognize\r\nthat government.\" Also, \"If they persist in refusing to recognize our\r\ngovernment, we shall see ourselves compelled to come to an agreement\r\nwith any other government that will consent to recognize us on friendly\r\nterms.\" [62]\r\n\r\nThis statement is certainly sufficiently specific as to whether\r\nAmericans had recognized the Insurgent government on or before the\r\ndate when it was written.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the relations between Aguinaldo and General\r\nAnderson.\r\n\r\nBlount attempts to make much of a cablegram, sent by the latter, in\r\nwhich, after describing the Filipinos, he adds, \"The people expect\r\nindependence.\" Blount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"That cablegram of July 22nd, above quoted, in which the\r\n    commanding general of our forces in the Philippines advises\r\n    the Washington Government, 'The people expect independence'\r\n    is the hardest thing in the public archives of our government\r\n    covering that momentous period for those who love the memory of\r\n    Mr. McKinley to get around. After the war with the Filipinos\r\n    broke out, McKinley said repeatedly in public speeches,\r\n    'I never dreamed they would turn against us.'\" [63]\r\n\r\nIf there is nothing harder than this to get around the memory of\r\nPresident McKinley will not suffer, as the important thing is not\r\nwhat Aguinaldo had led his people to expect, but what the American\r\nofficials had promised him. The President was certainly not bound to\r\nbelieve that the Filipinos would turn against us even if they did\r\nthen expect independence. Blount has seen fit to leave unmentioned\r\ncertain other facts which are very pertinent in this connection.\r\n\r\nApparently sometime during September, 1898, Sandico made the following\r\nstatement in a letter to Aguinaldo:--\r\n\r\n    \"I also have to inform you that Señores Basa, Cortés and\r\n    Co. have congratulated the Government of the United States\r\n    upon the capture of Manila, stating at the same time that now\r\n    that Filipino soil had been soaked with American blood, the\r\n    Islands must remain American. I believe that a telegram should\r\n    be sent immediately, to counteract that sent by them.\" [64]\r\n\r\nProbably Sandico did not know that on August 15, 1898, Agoncillo\r\nhad transmitted another telegram to President McKinley through\r\nConsul-General Wildman, reading as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Agoncillo, my Commissioner and Ambassador-Extraordinary,\r\n    representing the provisional government of the Philippine\r\n    Islands, in its name and the name of its President, Emilio\r\n    Aguinaldo, congratulates you on the successful termination of\r\n    the war, and commends the occupancy of Manila. I assure the\r\n    United States of the allegiance and unquestioning support\r\n    of our people, and petition that we be granted one or more\r\n    representatives on the commission that is to decide the future\r\n    of our Islands.\" [65]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that the President had more information\r\non this subject than was transmitted by General Anderson!\r\n\r\nNot only did the latter passively refrain from recognizing Aguinaldo's\r\npretensions, but on July 22, 1898, he wrote to him as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I observe that your Excellency has announced yourself\r\n    Dictator and proclaimed martial law. As I am here simply in\r\n    a military capacity, I have no authority to recognize such\r\n    an assumption. I have no orders from my government on the\r\n    subject.\" [66]\r\n\r\nThe effort to keep Americans in ignorance of the true state of affairs\r\nwas kept up until further deception was useless. Consul Williams,\r\nfor instance, wrote on June 16, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"For future advantage, I am maintaining cordial relations\r\n    with General Aguinaldo, having stipulated submissiveness to\r\n    our forces when treating for their return here. Last Sunday,\r\n    12th, they held a council to form provisional government. I\r\n    was urged to attend, but thought best to decline. A form of\r\n    government was adopted, but General Aguinaldo told me today\r\n    that his friends all hoped that the Philippines would be held\r\n    as a colony of the United States of America.\" [67]\r\n\r\nYet on Sunday, June 12, Aguinaldo had in reality proclaimed the\r\nindependence of the Philippines. Few Americans at this time knew any\r\nSpanish and none understood Tagalog, so that it was comparatively\r\neasy to deceive them. What Consul Williams reported was what Aguinaldo\r\nconsidered it expedient to have him believe.\r\n\r\nThe following undated letter from Aguinaldo to Mabini, supposed to have\r\nbeen sent at this time, is of especial interest in this connection:--\r\n\r\n    \"My dear Brother: I do not want to go there [where the\r\n    addressee is] until after the visit of the American Consul,\r\n    because I do not wish the negotiations to end in an ultimatum,\r\n    and in order that you may tell him all that is favourable for\r\n    the cause of our Nation. I charge you with the task of giving\r\n    him a reply, and if he should ask about me tell him that\r\n    since the time of his last visit there I have not recovered\r\n    from my illness. If anything important should happen we can\r\n    communicate with each other by telegraph, using a code in\r\n    matters that require secrecy.\" [68]\r\n\r\nIn a letter supposed to have been written during November, 1898,\r\nprepared for Aguinaldo's signature and addressed to Señor McKinley,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the United States of North America, but\r\napparently never sent, Aguinaldo renews the charge [69] previously\r\nmade in his \"Reseñia Verídica,\" that Pratt and Dewey promised\r\nindependence. It need not be further discussed.\r\n\r\nThe climax was finally reached in an official protest against the\r\nParis Treaty written by Agoncillo in Paris on the 12th of December,\r\n1898, in which occurs the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"The United States of America, on their part, cannot allege\r\n    a better right to constitute themselves as arbitrators as to\r\n    the future of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"On the contrary, the demands of honour and good faith impose\r\n    on them the explicit recognition of the political status of\r\n    the people, who, loyal to their conventions, were a devoted\r\n    ally of their forces in the moments of danger and strife. The\r\n    noble general Emilio Aguinaldo and the other Filipino chiefs\r\n    were solicited to place themselves at the head of the suffering\r\n    and heroic sons of that country, to fight against Spain and\r\n    to second the action of the brave and skilful Admiral Dewey.\r\n\r\n    \"At the time of employing their armed coöperation, both the\r\n    Commander of the _Petrel_ and Captain Wood in Hongkong, before\r\n    the declaration of war, the American Consuls-General Mr. Pratt\r\n    in Singapore, Mr. Wildman, in Hongkong, and Mr. Williams in\r\n    Cavite, acting as international agents of the great American\r\n    nation, at a moment of great anxiety offered to recognize\r\n    the independence of the Filipino nation, as soon as triumph\r\n    was obtained.\r\n\r\n    \"Under the faith of such promises, an American man-of-war,\r\n    the _McCulloch_ was placed at the disposal of the said leaders\r\n    and which took them to their native shores; and Admiral Dewey\r\n    himself, by sending the man-of-war; by not denying to General\r\n    Aguinaldo and his companions the exacting of his promises,\r\n    when they were presented to him on board his flag-ship in\r\n    the Bay of Manila; by receiving the said General Aguinaldo\r\n    before and after his victories and notable deeds of arms,\r\n    with the honours due the Commander-in-Chief of an allied\r\n    army, and chief of an independent state; by accepting the\r\n    efficacious coöperation of that Army and of those Generals;\r\n    by recognizing the Filipino flag, and permitting it to be\r\n    hoisted on sea and land, consenting that their ships should\r\n    sail with the said flag within the places which were blockaded;\r\n    by receiving a solemn notification of the formal proclamation\r\n    of the Philippine nation, without protesting against it,\r\n    nor opposing in any way its existence; by entering into\r\n    relations with those Generals and with the national Filipino\r\n    authorities recently established, recognized without question\r\n    the corporated body and autonomous sovereignty of the people\r\n    who had just succeeded in breaking their fetters and freeing\r\n    themselves by the impulse of their own force.\" [70]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the claim constantly grows. The commander of\r\nthe _Petrel_ Captain Wood, Consul Wildman and Consul Williams are\r\nnow included among those alleged to have promised independence, and\r\nit is claimed that Aguinaldo was received with the honours due the\r\nchief of an independent state when he visited Admiral Dewey, whereas\r\nhis own original claim was that he was received with the honours due\r\na general, which is quite a different matter.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, American officers usually addressed and treated\r\nAguinaldo as a general. The extent to which they were able to use\r\nhis organization to further the ends of their government will be set\r\nforth later.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Wildman, dated August 7, 1898, Aguinaldo admits that\r\nthere is no agreement, but says that he cannot tell the peoples that\r\nit does not exist, \"fearing that I may not be able to restrain the\r\npopular excitement.\" [71] He begs Wildman to use his influence on his\r\ngovernment so that it will realize the inadvisability of deciding the\r\nfate of the people \"without considering their will duly represented by\r\nmy government.\" Is it conceivable that, if there had been any ground\r\nfor claiming a promise of independence, Aguinaldo would have failed\r\nto mention it at this time?\r\n\r\nWe may summarize the well-established facts as follows:--\r\n\r\nConsul-General Pratt was, or professed to be, in hearty sympathy\r\nwith the ambition of the Filipino leaders to obtain independence, and\r\nwould personally have profited from such a result, but he refrained\r\nfrom compromising his government and made no promises in its behalf.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey never even discussed with Aguinaldo the possibility\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that any subordinate of the Admiral\r\never discussed independence with any Filipino,  much less made any\r\npromise concerning it.\r\n\r\nNeither Consul Wildman nor Consul Williams promised it, and both\r\nwere kept in ignorance of the fact that it was desired up to the last\r\npossible moment.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that either General Anderson or General Merritt\r\nmade any promise concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that no such promise was ever made by any of these\r\nmen is fully justified by well-established facts.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo himself carefully refrained at the outset from saying,\r\nin any document which Americans could read, that independence\r\nhad been promised, and advanced this claim only when the growing\r\nstrength of his land force had given him confidence. He repeated it,\r\nwith increasing emphasis, as his army increased in size, ultimately\r\nopenly threatening war if his pretensions were not recognized. In\r\ndoing this, he was merely carrying out a carefully prearranged plan,\r\nagreed upon by the Hongkong junta.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us examine the claim that the insurgents were our \"faithful\r\nallies\" and \"coöperated\" with us in the taking of Manila. We shall\r\nfind that this subject richly repays investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nInsurgent \"Coöperation\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have previously [72] called attention to the minutes of a session\r\nof the Hongkong junta held on May 4, 1898, from which it indirectly\r\nappears that the Filipino leaders at that time hoped to secure arms\r\nat the expense of the Americans and purposed to attack them later if\r\nit seemed advisable.\r\n\r\nThe treacherous policy then outlined was never departed from by\r\nAguinaldo and his associates, who sailed for Manila with their eyes\r\nwide open, knowing full well that they had been promised nothing;\r\nprepared to match their wits against those of Admiral Dewey, and\r\nintent on deceiving him and on securing from him arms to be used\r\nfirst against the Spaniards and later against the Americans, after\r\nthey had been employed to help bring about the downfall of Spain.\r\n\r\nThere exists a significant circular signed \"J.M.B.\" [73] believed\r\nto have been an outright forgery, both from its tenor and from the\r\nfact that the signature \"J.M.B.\" is not in the handwriting of Basa's\r\nletter hereinbefore quoted.\r\n\r\nIt contains the following statements:--\r\n\r\n    \"The true patriots have organized a committee to which\r\n    I belong, naming Aguinaldo as President and Agoncillo as\r\n    Vice-President. The latter and three others have commenced\r\n    diplomatic negotiations with the Admiral and American Consul,\r\n    and we infer that they are trying to make colonies of us,\r\n    although they said they would give us independence. The\r\n    Committee deemed it advisable to simulate belief, at the same\r\n    time equipping ourselves with arms.\r\n\r\n    \"We have accepted arms offered by the Admiral which will be\r\n    disembarked in the Philippines by the squadron.\r\n\r\n    \"A part of our forces will aid the Americans by fighting with\r\n    them in order to conceal our real intentions, and part will\r\n    be held in reserve. If America triumphs and proposes a colony,\r\n    we shall reject such offer and rise in arms.\r\n\r\n    \"A separate expedition will disembark at whatever point may\r\n    be considered suitable.\r\n\r\n    \"José Alejandrino embarked with the American squadron in\r\n    order to give secret instructions to the Chiefs.\r\n\r\n    \"Be very cautious about this exceedingly delicate point;\r\n    you will communicate with prudent and intelligent chiefs who\r\n    will recognize the gravity of the subject.\" [74]\r\n\r\nHere, then, in a faked-up letter on which Basa's initials were forged\r\nin order to gain the prestige of his name for this treacherous plan,\r\nwe have definitely set forth the purpose of the Filipinos to deceive\r\nthe Americans by allowing a part of the Insurgent force to fight with\r\nthem, and then to attack them.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Agoncillo's advice to Aguinaldo,\r\ngiven under date of August 26, 1898, to the effect that friendly\r\nrelations should be maintained with the Americans until the diplomatic\r\nnegotiations at Paris should end; that an effort should be made\r\nto find out the future status of the islands \"by deceitful means,\"\r\nand that confidence should never be put in the Americans.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo put the whole matter in a nutshell in a postscript  to this\r\nletter, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"You should issue an order commanding that all our chiefs\r\n    should employ a policy of friendship toward the Americans until\r\n    our status is defined; but said order should be confidentially\r\n    given. Try to mislead them.\" [75]\r\n\r\nBray also very strongly advised awaiting the results of the Paris\r\nconference. [76]\r\n\r\nBlount claims that the Filipinos hoped that the Treaty of Paris\r\nwould leave their country to them as it left Cuba to the Cubans,\r\n[77] and adds that having helped us take the city of Manila, they\r\n\"felt that they had been 'given the double cross,'\" \"believed that\r\nthe Americans had been guilty of a duplicity rankly Machiavellian,\r\nand that was the cause of the war.\" [78]\r\n\r\nThe quotations already given from Insurgent records show plainly\r\nthat the principal thing for which the Filipinos were waiting was\r\nthe ousting of Spain from the Philippines by the United States; those\r\nwhich follow show that war was by no means inevitable as a result of\r\na a decision at Paris adverse to Filipino hopes, for the question of\r\nwhether a United States protectorate, or even annexation to the United\r\nStates, might be considered, was left open to a very late date. [79]\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed not only that the Insurgents whipped the Spaniards\r\nwithout our assistance, but whipped them so thoroughly that Spanish\r\nsovereignty had practically disappeared from the islands at the time\r\nManila surrendered. It has further been alleged that \"decrepit\"\r\nSpain \"could not possibly have sent any reinforcements to the\r\nPhilippines. Besides, the Filipinos would have 'eaten them up.'\" [80]\r\n\r\nBut the Filipinos had fought Spain before and were by no means\r\nsanguine. Their more intelligent and reasonable men clearly foresaw\r\nthat they could not win unaided. Señor Antonio Regidor was at the\r\ntime residing in London. He was a Filipino of unusual intelligence and\r\nexceptionally good education. He took a keen interest in the situation,\r\nand on July 28, 1898, telegraphed Agoncillo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the name of the Filipinos, you should immediately send\r\n    a telegraphic message to MacKinley, requesting him not to\r\n    abandon the islands, after having fought as brothers for a\r\n    common cause. Pledge him our unconditional adhesion, especially\r\n    of well-to-do people. To return to Spain, in whatever form,\r\n    would mean annihilation, perpetual anarchy. Filipinos en\r\n    masse should visit the consuls at Hongkong, Singapore. London\r\n    commerce support it. Influence Aguinaldo to accept American\r\n    flag, flying it everywhere, thus obliging them to remain.\" [81]\r\n\r\nThis leaves no room for doubt as to Regidor's views, but Agoncillo\r\ndid not share them. He replied on July 29:--\r\n\r\n    \"Provisional government's aspiration is independence. Make\r\n    this campaign.\" [82]\r\n\r\nRegidor was not to be persuaded. On July 30 he replied as follows,\r\naddressing his communication to Basa:\r\n\r\n    \"America vacillating as to remaining fears conflicts later with\r\n    natives international question other difficulties necessary to\r\n    encourage her all of you submit united unconditionally raising\r\n    American flag great demonstrations necessary to influence\r\n    outside opinion show islands resolved united America high\r\n    circles advise in view present circumstances only feasible\r\n    programme is protectorate.\" [83]\r\n\r\nObviously, Agoncillo was somewhat impressed by this cablegram, for\r\non August 1 in a letter to Aguinaldo he made the following statements\r\nand inquiries:--\r\n\r\n    \"If the American troops leave us alone there, the questions\r\n    which will arise are these: Have we sufficient arms to maintain\r\n    the war against Spain in order to secure our independence? If\r\n    the other nations are opposed to our independence and wish\r\n    that we should continue under the Spanish sovereignty,\r\n    have we sufficient strength to wage a war and obtain victory\r\n    over Spain and over them in the future? If you think that we\r\n    have not sufficient strength to fight against them, should\r\n    we accept independence under the American protectorate? And\r\n    if so, what conditions or advantages should we give to the\r\n    United States? You should carefully consider the preceding\r\n    questions, and I suggest that you should, in a confidential\r\n    manner, consult them with your cabinet-in-banc, as well as\r\n    with your private secretary and military chiefs of rank;\r\n    and your decision be notified to our representatives abroad\r\n    in order that they may know what they must do in their\r\n    negotiations. You will see from the telegram addressed to\r\n    me by Regidor that he suggests to me to send a message to\r\n    MacKinley requesting him not to abandon us, and to submit\r\n    to them [the U. S.] unconditionally. As I do not agree with\r\n    him and as I cannot take any action which is against the\r\n    instructions of the government, I replied to him that the\r\n    only desire of our government is independence. This may be\r\n    seen from the enclosed telegram. On account of this reply,\r\n    he was, I think, somewhat offended, as he afterwards sent a\r\n    telegram to Joviales [Basa] instead of to me. The latter,\r\n    upon receiving the telegram, convened all the boastful\r\n    patriots, and they adopted a resolution to send a message\r\n    to MacKinley requesting annexation. Fortunately, in the\r\n    meeting there was present Dr. Justo Lucban, who protested\r\n    against such measure. In view of this protest, they again\r\n    agreed that I should be present in the meeting, since I am\r\n    the representative of our government. At the meeting where\r\n    I was present, I pointed out the inadvisability of their\r\n    resolution, stating, as one of the reasons, that we should\r\n    await your instructions in regard to the matter before sending\r\n    any message of that character. So the message was not sent;\r\n    but I was later informed that Basa had, after all, sent it\r\n    yesterday, because he believed that it would not injure our\r\n    cause. Upon learning this, I was carried away by passion and\r\n    went so far as to say to Basa the following: 'Many of us,\r\n    especially myself, think ourselves to be wise, without being\r\n    so; politicians for what we hear from others; we claim to be\r\n    patriots, but we are only so in words; we wish to be chiefs,\r\n    but none of us act in a way worthy of a chief.' To this he\r\n    did not reply. Perhaps his conscience accused him of an act\r\n    of treachery, since we agreed in the meeting to await your\r\n    letter. What union can you expect from this people?\" [84]\r\n\r\nNote that the Basa here referred to is the man whose initials were\r\nforged on the letter quoted on page 67.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the above-mentioned letter Agoncillo came back once\r\nmore to the question of independence under a protectorate and made\r\nit very clear that at this late day he did not know whether this was\r\nor was not what the Filipinos desired. [85]\r\n\r\nOn August 21, Apacible obviously did not think that it would be an\r\neasy matter to escape from Spanish domination, much less that the\r\nislands were already rid of it, for he wrote to Mabini that the United\r\nStates were likely again to deliver the Filipinos into the hands of\r\nSpain. He said that \"if events will be what their telegrams indicate,\r\nwe have a dark and bloody future before us. To be again in the hands\r\nof Spain will mean a long and bloody war, and it is doubtful whether\r\nthe end will be favourable to us... Spain free from Cuba and her\r\nother colonies will employ her energy to crush us and will send here\r\nthe 150,000 men she has in Cuba.\" [86] Apacible thought that the best\r\nthing was independence under an American protectorate.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1898, Aguinaldo warned Agoncillo that in the United States\r\nhe should \"not accept any contracts or give any promises respecting\r\nprotection or annexation, because we will see first if we can obtain\r\nindependence.\" [87]\r\n\r\nEven annexation to the United States was not excluded by Aguinaldo\r\nfrom the possible accepted solutions, for in outlining the policy of\r\nthe Philippine government to Sandico on August 10, 1898, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"The policy of the government is as follows: 1st. To struggle\r\n    for the independence of 'the Philippines' as far as our\r\n    strength and our means will permit. Protection or annexation\r\n    will be acceptable only when it can be clearly seen that the\r\n    recognition of our Independence, either by force of arms or\r\n    diplomacy, is impossible.\" [88]\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1898, Aguinaldo was still ready to consider annexation\r\nif necessary. [89] He was apparently not sanguine at this time as\r\nto the result of a continued struggle with Spain. At all events,\r\nhe wanted the help of the Americans if such a struggle was to come,\r\nand desired to know on what terms it could be had. [90]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Filipinos in Hongkong who favoured annexation made\r\nthemselves heard.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 1898, Consul-General Wildman wrote from that place:--\r\n\r\n    \"I believe I know the sentiments of the political leaders\r\n    and of the moneyed men among the insurgents, and, in spite\r\n    of all statements to the contrary, I know that they are\r\n    fighting for annexation to the United States first, and\r\n    for independence secondly, if the United States decides to\r\n    decline the sovereignty of the Islands. In fact, I have had\r\n    the most prominent leaders call on me and say they would not\r\n    raise one finger unless I could assure them that the United\r\n    States intended to give them United States citizenship if\r\n    they wished it.\" [91]\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the action of Basa and the Cortez family who\r\ninsisted that the Islands must remain American, [92] and that of\r\nAgoncillo, who cabled President McKinley in Aguinaldo's name and his\r\nown, congratulating him on the outcome of the war, commending the\r\noccupation of Manila, and assuring the people of the United States\r\nof the allegiance and unquestioning support of the Filipinos, [93]\r\nbut it is to be feared that the sending of this cablegram was only\r\none more move in the Insurgent game of deceit.\r\n\r\nThere were annexationists in Manila as well as in Hongkong. [94]\r\nIndeed we know that some of the strongest and best of the Filipinos\r\nthere were in favour of it.\r\n\r\nFelipe Buencamino, writing in 1901, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In June of 1898, Don Cayetano Arellano [95] addressed to\r\n    Don Felipe Buencamino and Don Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista a\r\n    letter written from the town of Pagsanján, province of Laguna,\r\n    in reply to one addressed to him by those two gentlemen. In\r\n    this letter Don Cayetano outlined the idea of union with the\r\n    United States and said: 'Avoid all doing and undoing, and\r\n    when America has established a stable order of affairs, then\r\n    it will be time enough to make laws.' Mabini, whose influence\r\n    at that time was in the ascendant in Aguinaldo's government,\r\n    paid no heed to this wise advice. In October of 1898, while\r\n    the Philippine government was established in Malolos, and\r\n    before congress had promulgated a Philippine constitution,\r\n    Messrs. Arellano and Pardo [96] still more earnestly advocated\r\n    union with America, the first as secretary of foreign affairs\r\n    and the latter as chief diplomat. Their plan consisted in\r\n    asking the United States to acknowledge the independence\r\n    of the country under a protectorate through the mediation\r\n    of General Otis, and this plan was accepted at a cabinet\r\n    meeting by Don Emilio Aguinaldo. But on the following day\r\n    Sandico came and told Aguinaldo that he had had a conference\r\n    with the Japanese consul and had been told by him: 'that if\r\n    Aguinaldo would support absolute independence the Japanese\r\n    Government would help.' Aguinaldo believed Sandico's story\r\n    (which turned out to be absolutely false) and did not carry\r\n    out the resolution adopted by the cabinet. Messrs. Arellano\r\n    and Pardo, after this affront, separated themselves from\r\n    the Malolos government. Aguinaldo told me afterwards that\r\n    he had received a letter from Agoncillo, dated Washington,\r\n    assuring him that a majority of the American people were\r\n    inclined to acknowledge the independence of the Philippines\r\n    and of Cuba.\" [97]\r\n\r\nBut annexationists were not confined, in the Philippines, to the\r\nvicinity of Manila.\r\n\r\nAs late as September 6 Consul Williams reported that a delegation from\r\nfour thousand Visayan soldiers, a delegation which also represented\r\nsouthern business interests, had come to him and pledged loyalty to\r\nannexation. [98]\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the situation early in September was as follows: All\r\nwere agreed that the assistance of the United States was necessary\r\nin getting rid of Spanish sovereignty.\r\n\r\nUnder the plan of Aguinaldo and his followers friendly relations were\r\nto be maintained with the United States, if possible, until Spain\r\nwas ousted from her Philippine territory, and then they were to \"show\r\ntheir teeth,\" and see \"who was deceiving whom,\" resorting to \"force of\r\narms\" if necessary. Protection or annexation would be accepted only\r\nwhen it could be clearly seen that the recognition of independence,\r\nwon either by force of arms or by diplomacy, was impossible.\r\n\r\nOther influential and patriotic Filipinos favored annexation to the\r\nUnited States or a United States protectorate, but their views were\r\nin the end ignored by Aguinaldo and his following, and as the latter\r\nhad the guns their ideas prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Paris, which terminated Spanish sovereignty in the\r\nPhilippines, was signed on December 10, 1898. It is important to\r\nbear this date in mind later, when considering the Insurgent records\r\nrelative to the preparations which were so carefully made for attacking\r\nthe American troops.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us consider the actual facts as to the coöperation alleged\r\nto have been asked by Americans and given by Filipinos. The following\r\npoints are not in dispute:--\r\n\r\nPratt asked Aguinaldo to coöperate with Dewey.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo was taken to Manila with the understanding that he would\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nDewey assisted Aguinaldo by destroying the main Spanish fleet; by\r\nbringing him and his associates back to the Philippines; by furnishing\r\nthem arms and ammunition; by blockading Manila and by keeping at a safe\r\ndistance the Spanish mosquito fleet, which would have made dangerous,\r\nor impossible, the landing of the arms subsequently imported by\r\nthe Insurgents.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo successfully attacked the Spanish garrisons in the provinces\r\nand used the arms and ammunition captured, or brought in by deserters,\r\nto equip a force which surrounded and attacked Manila, drove large\r\nnumbers of people into the walled city, thus rendering the position\r\nof the Spanish garrison very difficult in the face of a possible\r\nbombardment, and prevented this garrison from betaking itself to the\r\nprovinces, as it might otherwise have done, leaving Manila to shift\r\nfor itself.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo was powerless to take the place by assault.\r\n\r\nIt lay at the mercy of Dewey's guns, and it would have been possible\r\nfor the Admiral to take it at any time, but he could not at first\r\nhave garrisoned it with United States forces, and never thought of\r\nattempting to use Insurgent forces for this purpose.\r\n\r\nDid Dewey really want or need Aguinaldo's help? Let us consider his\r\ntestimony on the subject:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. You did want a man there who could organize\r\n    and rouse the people?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I didn't want anybody. I would like to say\r\n    now that Aguinaldo and his people were forced on me by Consul\r\n    Pratt and Consul Wildman; I didn't do anything--\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. Did they have any power to force him\r\n    upon you?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; they had in a way. They had not the\r\n    official power, but one will yield after a while to constant\r\n    pressure. I did not expect anything of them; I did not\r\n    think they would do anything. I would not have taken them;\r\n    I did not want them; I did not believe in them; because,\r\n    when I left Hongkong, I was led to suppose that the country\r\n    was in a state of insurrection, and that at my first gun,\r\n    as Mr. Williams put it, there would be a general uprising,\r\n    and I thought these half dozen or dozen refugees at Hongkong\r\n    would play a very small part in it.\" [99]\r\n\r\nThe picture of the poor admiral, busy getting his fleet ready\r\nfor battle, pestered by officious consuls on the one hand and by\r\nirresponsible Filipinos on the other, is pathetic; but it had its\r\nhumorous features, which were not lost on the Admiral himself. I\r\nquote the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Was there any communication between\r\n    you and Pratt in which the matter of a written pledge or\r\n    agreement with Aguinaldo was discussed with reference to the\r\n    Philippine Islands?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. What became of the correspondence,\r\n    Admiral, if you know?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. It is all in the Navy Department. When I\r\n    turned over my command my official correspondence was all\r\n    sent to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. You retained all of your letters from\r\n    any United States officials?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No; they went to the Department.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. I mean you did not destroy them.\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No; I did not destroy them.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. And you turned them over to the Navy\r\n    Department?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; our regulations require that. I may say\r\n    that for my own information I kept copies of certain telegrams\r\n    and cablegrams. I don't think I kept copies of Mr. Pratt's\r\n    letters, as I did not consider them of much value. He seemed to\r\n    be a sort of busybody there and interfering in other people's\r\n    business and I don't think his letters impressed me.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. He was the consul-general?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; but he had nothing to do with the\r\n    attack on Manila, you know.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. I understand that.\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I received lots of advice, you understand,\r\n    from many irresponsible people.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. But Pratt was the consul-general of\r\n    the Government there?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; he was consul-general.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. And he communicated with you, giving you\r\n    such information as he thought you might be interested in,\r\n    and among other information he gave you was this concerning\r\n    Aguinaldo?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I don't remember; no, I really don't\r\n    remember his telling me anything about Aguinaldo more than\r\n    that cablegram there, and I said he might come. And you see\r\n    how much importance I attached to him; I did not wait for him.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. What you said was: 'Tell Aguinaldo to\r\n    come as soon as possible.'\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; but I did not wait a moment for him.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Yes; but there was a reason for that.\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I think more to get rid of him than\r\n    anything else.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. Rid of whom?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Of Aguinaldo and the Filipinos. They were\r\n    bothering me. I was very busy getting my squadron ready for\r\n    battle, and these little men were coming on board my ship at\r\n    Hongkong and taking a good deal of my time, and I did not\r\n    attach the slightest importance to anything they could do,\r\n    and they did nothing; that is, none of them went with me\r\n    when I went to Mirs Bay. There had been a good deal of talk,\r\n    but when the time came they did not go. One of them didn't\r\n    go because he didn't have any toothbrush.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Burrows_. Did he give that as a reason?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; he said, 'I have no toothbrush.'\" [100]\r\n\r\nHowever, Dewey ultimately yielded to the pressure exercised on him by\r\nPratt and Wildman, and allowed Aguinaldo and some of his associates to\r\nbe brought to Manila. Having them there he proposed to get assistance\r\nfrom them, not as allies, but as a friendly force attacking a common\r\nenemy, in its own way.\r\n\r\nLet us continue with his testimony as to cooperation between Aguinaldo\r\nand the naval forces of the United States:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Then, Admiral, until you knew that\r\n    they were going to send land forces to your assistance you\r\n    thought there was a necessity to organize the Filipinos into\r\n    land forces, did you?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No; not a necessity.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. You thought it might prove of value\r\n    to you?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I testified here, I think, in a way that\r\n    answers  that. I said to Aguinaldo, 'There is our enemy;\r\n    now, you go your way and I will go mine; we had better act\r\n    independently.' That was the wisest thing I ever said.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. But you stated that you were using\r\n    these people and they were permitted to organize, that you\r\n    might use them.\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. They were assisting us.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Very well, they were to assist you. Did\r\n    you not either permit them or encourage them--I do not care\r\n    which term you use--to organize into an army, such as it was,\r\n    that they might render you such assistance as you needed?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. They were assisting us, but incidentally\r\n    they were fighting their enemy; they were fighting an enemy\r\n    which had been their enemy for three hundred years.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. I understand that, Admiral.\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. While assisting us they were fighting their\r\n    own battles, too.\r\n\r\n    \"_The Chairman_. You were encouraging insurrection against\r\n    a common enemy with which you were at war?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I think so. I had in my mind an illustration\r\n    furnished by the civil war. I was in the South in the civil\r\n    war, and the only friends we had in the South were the negroes,\r\n    and we made use of them; they assisted us on many occasions. I\r\n    had that in mind; I said these people were our friends, and\r\n    'we have come here and they will help us just exactly as the\r\n    negroes helped us in the civil war.'\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. The negroes were expecting their\r\n    freedom--\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. The Filipinos were slaves, too.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. What were the Filipinos expecting?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. They wanted to get rid of the Spaniards;\r\n    I do not think they looked much beyond that. I cannot recall\r\n    but I have in mind that the one thing they had in their minds\r\n    was to get rid of the Spaniards and then to accept us, and\r\n    that would have occurred--I have thought that many times--if\r\n    we had had troops to occupy Manila on the 1st day of May\r\n    before the insurrection got started; these people would have\r\n    accepted us as their friends, and they would have been our\r\n    loyal friends--I don't know for how long, but they would have\r\n    been our friends then.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. You learned from Pratt, or Wildman,\r\n    or Williams, very early, did you not, that the Filipinos\r\n    wanted their own country and to rule their own country;\r\n    that that is what they were expecting?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I heard from Williams that there was an\r\n    insurrection there against the Spaniards. The Spaniards were\r\n    very cruel to them, and I think they did not look much beyond\r\n    getting rid of them. There was one, Dr. Rizal, who had the\r\n    idea of independence, but I don't think that Aguinaldo had\r\n    much idea of it.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. Then what useful purpose did the Filipino\r\n    army serve; why did you want the Filipino army at all?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I did not want them.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. Did you not want the Filipino forces?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No, not really. It was their own idea coming\r\n    over there. We could have taken the city at any moment we\r\n    had the troops to occupy it.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey has made the following statements relative to the\r\nimportance of Aguinaldo's military operations:--\r\n\r\n    \"Then he began operations toward Manila, and he did wonderfully\r\n    well. He whipped the Spaniards battle after battle, and finally\r\n    put one of those old smoothbore guns on a barge, and he wanted\r\n    to take this up--wanted me to tow it up so he could attack the\r\n    city with it. I said, 'Oh, no, no; we can do nothing until\r\n    our troops come.' I knew he could not take the city without\r\n    the assistance of the navy, without my assistance, and I knew\r\n    that what he was doing--driving the Spaniards in--was saving\r\n    our own troops, because our own men perhaps would have had to\r\n    do that same thing. He and I were always on the most friendly\r\n    terms; we had never had any differences. He considered me\r\n    as his liberator, as his friend. I think he had the highest\r\n    admiration for us because we had whipped the Spaniards who\r\n    had been riding them down for three hundred years.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_ (continuing). You sent this short dispatch\r\n    to the Secretary of the Navy:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Aguinaldo, the revolutionary leader, visited the _Olympia_\r\n    yesterday. He expects to make general attack on May 31. Doubt\r\n    his ability to succeed. Situation remains unchanged.'\r\n\r\n    \"Do you recall that visit?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. He came to tell you, did he, that he\r\n    was going to make a general attack, and you--\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. And you doubted his ability to succeed?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. And he wanted me to assist him. He wanted\r\n    me to tow one of his guns up into position. I knew he could\r\n    not take the city; of course he could not.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Did you urge that he should not make\r\n    the attack?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I do not remember that; very likely I did.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. And was he not persuaded or restrained\r\n    by you from doing so?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I do not remember; but it is very likely. I\r\n    did not want to see a lot of them killed unnecessarily,\r\n    because I knew they could not take that walled city. They had\r\n    no artillery, and they could not take it, I knew very well,\r\n    and I wanted the situation to remain as it was until our\r\n    troops came to occupy it.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. But you found that whenever you expressed\r\n    a strong objection to anything being done at that time that\r\n    Aguinaldo yielded to your request?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Up to the time the army came he did\r\n    everything I requested. I had not much to do with him after\r\n    the army came.\" [101]\r\n\r\nBut Dewey's influence over Aguinaldo was not sufficient to prevent\r\nhis looting, as the following extracts from his testimony show:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Is that what you mean when you say he\r\n    looted--that he made reprisals for his army, took provisions\r\n    and whatever was necessary? That is what you meant?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. That is one part of it.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. This was taking provisions for the use\r\n    of the army?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. That is one thing he did.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. You said you did not object to that at\r\n    the time?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. No. It would have been useless; he got\r\n    beyond me very soon--he got out of my hands very soon. [102]\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Carmack_. You said yesterday you suspected that\r\n    Aguinaldo took the lion's share of the provisions that were\r\n    gathered for the army. What was the ground upon which you\r\n    made that accusation?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Because he was living in Malolos like a\r\n    prince, like a king, in a way that could only have come about\r\n    by his taking the lion's share. Then, in regard to his looting,\r\n    I repeat what I said yesterday. He began within forty-eight\r\n    hours after he landed in Cavite to capture and take everything\r\n    he wanted. I know these things of my own knowledge, because\r\n    I saw the loot brought in; and I know that every dollar that\r\n    was taken from the workingmen at the navy-yard was taken at\r\n    the threat of death. [103]\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Do you believe in this proclamation he\r\n    was uttering falsehoods to the Filipino people?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes; I do absolutely. I think he was there\r\n    for gain--for money--that independence had never up to that\r\n    time entered his head. He was there for loot and money. That\r\n    is what I believe, since you ask me my belief; I believe that\r\n    implicitly. [104]\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. And you found nothing to cause any\r\n    doubt as to his loyalty up to the time until after Manila\r\n    surrendered?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. His loyalty to whom?\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. To you and to the cause for which he\r\n    was fighting?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I began to suspect he was not loyal to us\r\n    about the time our troops arrived, when he demurred at moving\r\n    out of Cavite to make room for our troops.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. Do you mean by that that you feared\r\n    that he was commencing to think more of independence than\r\n    the success of the American cause?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Yes.\" [105]\r\n\r\nWe have seen to what extent Aguinaldo coöperated with the marine\r\nforces of the United States. Now let us examine the claim that he\r\ncooperated with the land forces after their arrival.\r\n\r\nOne of the things which the Insurgents are said to have accomplished\r\nwas the maintenance of an effective land blockade which prevented the\r\nentrance of provisions, and produced a very serious food shortage. Both\r\nOtis and Dewey have stated that they did this, but we learn from the\r\nInsurgent records how erroneous was this conclusion. [106]\r\n\r\nThe landing of the American troops for the attack on Manila was\r\nnot actively opposed by the Filipinos, but it was narrowly and\r\ndistrustfully watched.\r\n\r\nNecessary transportation requested by General Anderson was ultimately\r\nfurnished by Aguinaldo, but only grudgingly after a three weeks'\r\ndelay, and as a result of threats that it would be seized if not\r\nvoluntarily supplied.\r\n\r\nThe necessary positions in the trenches around Manila from which to\r\nmake the attack on that city were, in part at least, yielded to the\r\nAmericans by the Filipinos upon the request of the former.\r\n\r\nThe Insurgents twice informed the Spaniards in advance of projected\r\nAmerican attacks.\r\n\r\nThey carried out their own attack on the city without regard to the\r\nplans, or the requests, of the Americans. They secretly treated with\r\nthe Spaniards in the endeavour to secure the surrender of the city\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter the capitulation to the Americans had been agreed upon, and\r\non the very morning of the day of the surrender, they endeavoured\r\nto push home an attack. Disregarding the request that they keep out\r\nof the final assault, they crowded into the city with, and after,\r\nthe American troops. They fired on Spanish soldiers on the city wall\r\nwhile a flag of truce was flying, provoking a return fire which killed\r\nand wounded American soldiers.\r\n\r\nThey demanded for themselves Malacañang palace and other buildings\r\nand a share in \"the war booty.\" They promptly looted the parts of the\r\ncity which they occupied, and ultimately retired from their positions\r\nwithin the city limits on the evening of their last day of grace\r\nafter being warned by General Otis that if they did not do so they\r\nwould be driven out.\r\n\r\nI will now quote from the records in support of these statements.\r\n\r\nThe following is the programme of  \"coöperation\" outlined to Aguinaldo\r\nby Bray in a letter dated June 30, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am very anxious to receive the news of the capitulation of\r\n    Manila and I hope that General Augustín will be obliged to turn\r\n    over his sword to you in person and not to the Americans. You\r\n    are by right entitled to it and I should like to see it so from\r\n    a political standpoint, as I am of the opinion that you should\r\n    declare the independence of the Philippines before the arrival\r\n    of General Merritt, appointed by the President to be Governor\r\n    with full powers to establish a provisional government.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Any attempt on the part of the Americans to garrison the\r\n    interior towns with their troops or any other act which might\r\n    be construed as a conquest, should meet with resistance.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"After having written these lines, I had another conference\r\n    with Mr. St. Clair of the Free Press, who sent for me regarding\r\n    the question of independence. He has had a consultation with\r\n    the Supreme Judge of this place, and he is of opinion that you\r\n    should proclaim independence at once, notwithstanding what\r\n    Admiral Dewey and Consul Williams say against it, and this\r\n    should be done before General Merritt can arrive. A Government\r\n    having been thus constituted in due form, the Americans would\r\n    have no right to invade the Philippines without committing a\r\n    violation of international law. They are no longer fighting\r\n    against the Spaniards against whom they declared war. The\r\n    advice of Consul Williams to delay this, is a diplomatic play\r\n    to gain time until the arrival of General Merritt, because he\r\n    is well aware of the false position said General would find\r\n    himself in. The key to the situation is now in your hands;\r\n    do not permit any one to take it away from you. The Americans\r\n    have done nothing but bombard and destroy the Spanish fleet\r\n    on the high seas; they have not conquered any land, but in\r\n    the meantime the control of the Philippines has passed by\r\n    conquest from the hands of the Spaniards and the Americans\r\n    have no right to enter further. Under certain conditions and\r\n    guarantees, permit the landing of American troops; but be\r\n    very careful, they must not be permitted to land until they\r\n    execute an agreement with the duly constituted government of\r\n    the Philippines, respecting all its institutions, and they must\r\n    under no pretext whatever be permitted to garrison any place\r\n    except the municipal limits of Manila, Cebú, and Iloílo, and\r\n    even therein care should be observed ... You must not permit a\r\n    single soldier to land without having these guarantees.\" [107]\r\n\r\nWhen General Anderson, with the first United States troops of\r\noccupation, arrived at Manila Bay, Aguinaldo did not call on him,\r\nas an \"ally\" might have been expected to do. Later, however, Admiral\r\nDewey and General Anderson went to see Aguinaldo, but without any\r\nof the ceremony of an official military call, the Admiral saying to\r\nGeneral Anderson:--\r\n\r\n    \"Do not take your sword or put on your uniform, but just put\r\n    on your blouse. Do not go with any ceremony.\" [108]\r\n\r\nAnd they went in that way.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1898, General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo definitely requesting\r\nhis coöperation in the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"For these reasons I desire to have the most amicable relations\r\n    with you, and to have you and your force coöperate with us\r\n    in the military operations against the Spanish forces.\" [109]\r\n\r\nOn July 5 Aguinaldo replied, thanking General Anderson for the\r\n\r\n    \"amicable sentiments which the natives of these islands\r\n    inspire in the Great North American nation,\" [110]\r\n\r\nand also for his desire to have friendly relations with the Filipinos\r\nand treat them with justice, courtesy and kindness. There is,\r\nhowever, not a word relative to coöperation in his reply, and\r\nAnderson apparently never renewed his request for coöperation in\r\nmilitary operations.\r\n\r\nOn July 6 he wrote to Aguinaldo again, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am encouraged by the friendly sentiment expressed by\r\n    Your Excellency in your welcome letter received on the 5th\r\n    instant, to endeavour to come to a definite understanding,\r\n    which I hope will be advantageous to both. Very soon we expect\r\n    large additional land forces, and it must be apparent to you\r\n    as a military officer that we will require much more room to\r\n    camp our soldiers and also store room for our supplies. For\r\n    this I would like to have Your Excellency's advice and\r\n    coöperation, as you are best acquainted with the resources\r\n    of the country.\" [111]\r\n\r\nTo this letter there was no reply. However, in a letter dated July\r\n9, 1898, to the Adjutant-General of the United States Army, General\r\nAnderson says of Aguinaldo:--\r\n\r\n    \"When we first landed he seemed very suspicious, and not at\r\n    all friendly, but I have now come to a better understanding\r\n    with him and he is much more friendly and seems willing to\r\n    coöperate. But he has declared himself Dictator and President,\r\n    and is trying to take Manila without our assistance. This\r\n    is not probable, but if he can effect his purpose he will,\r\n    I apprehend, antagonize any attempt on our part to establish\r\n    a provisional government.\" [112]\r\n\r\nEvidently, however, coöperation, even in the matter of getting\r\nnecessary transportation, did not materialize, for on July 17\r\nS. R. Jones, Chief Quartermaster, wrote Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"We will want horses, buffaloes, carts, etc., for\r\n    transportation, bamboo for shelter, wood to cook with, etc. For\r\n    all this we are willing to pay a fair price, but no more. We\r\n    find so far that the native population are not willing to give\r\n    us this assistance as promptly as required. But we must have\r\n    it, and if it becomes necessary we will be compelled to send\r\n    out parties to seize what we may need. We would regret very\r\n    much to do this, as we are here to befriend the Filipinos. Our\r\n    nation has spent millions in money to send forces here to\r\n    expel the Spaniards and to give good government to the whole\r\n    people, and the return we are asking is comparatively slight.\r\n\r\n    \"General Anderson wishes you to inform your people that we are\r\n    here for their good, and that they must supply us with labor\r\n    and material at the current market prices. We are prepared\r\n    to purchase five hundred horses at a fair price, but cannot\r\n    undertake to bargain for horses with each individual owner.\"\r\n\r\nAguinaldo sent this letter by a staff officer to General Anderson\r\ninquiring whether it was sent by authority of the latter, who then\r\nindorsed on it in a statement that it was. Nevertheless, Major Jones\r\nreported on July 20 that it was impossible to secure transportation\r\nexcept upon Aguinaldo's order and that the natives had removed their\r\ncart wheels and hidden them, from which it is to be inferred that\r\nthe transportation requested had not been furnished.\r\n\r\nObviously General Anderson was informed that Aguinaldo had given\r\norders against furnishing the transportation desired, for on July 21\r\nhe wrote the Adjutant-General of the Army as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Since I wrote last, Aguinaldo has put in operation an\r\n    elaborate system of military government, under his assumed\r\n    authority as Dictator, and has prohibited any supplies being\r\n    given us, except by his order. As Go this last, I have written\r\n    to him that our requisitions on the country for horses, ox\r\n    carts, fuel, and bamboo (to make scaling ladders) must be\r\n    filled, and that he must aid in having them filled.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 23 General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"_General_: When I came here three weeks ago I requested Your\r\n    Excellency to give what assistance you could to procure means\r\n    of transportation for the American Army, as it was to fight\r\n    the cause of your people. So far we have received no response.\r\n\r\n    \"As you represent your people, I now have the honor to make\r\n    requisition on you for five hundred horses and fifty oxen and\r\n    ox carts. If you cannot secure these I will have to pass you\r\n    and make requisition directly on the people.\r\n\r\n    \"I beg leave to request an answer at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n    \"I remain with great respect, etc.\" [113]\r\n\r\nTo this letter, Aguinaldo replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Replying to your letter of yesterday, I have the honor to\r\n    manifest to Your Excellency that I am surprised beyond measure\r\n    at that which you say to me in it, lamenting the non-receipt\r\n    of any response relative to the assistance that you have asked\r\n    of me in the way of horses, carabaos, and carts, because I\r\n    did reply through the bearer that I was disposed to issue\r\n    proper orders whenever you advised me of the number of these,\r\n    giving me notice in advance.\r\n\r\n    \"I have sent orders to the nearest provinces in order that\r\n    within the shortest time possible horses be brought for sale,\r\n    but I cannot assure Your Excellency that we will have the\r\n    number of 500 that you need, because there are not many horses\r\n    in this vicinity, owing to deaths from epizoötic diseases in\r\n    January, February, and March last.\r\n\r\n    \"Whenever we have them collected, I shall have the pleasure\r\n    to advise Your Excellency.\r\n\r\n    \"I have also ordered to be placed at my disposal 50 carts that\r\n    I shall place at your disposition when you need them, provided\r\n    you give me previous notice four days in advance.\" [114]\r\n\r\nGeneral Anderson replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your favour of the 26th ultimo in relation to requisitions\r\n    for cattle, horses, etc., is satisfactory I regret that\r\n    there should have been any misunderstanding about it. The\r\n    people to whom we applied even for the hiring of carromatas,\r\n    etc., told our people that they had orders to supply nothing\r\n    except by your orders. I am pleased to think that this was\r\n    a misapprehension on their part.\" [115]\r\n\r\nFrom this series of communications it appears that it took three\r\nweeks, and a very direct threat to seize transportation, to bring\r\nabout Aguinaldo's promise of assistance in securing it. What help\r\nhad he given, meanwhile, in other matters?\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1899, General Anderson wrote asking him to assist American\r\nofficers in making reconnaissance of the approaches to Manila, and\r\nto favor them with his advice. [116]\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1899, he again wrote Aguinaldo asking him to allow Major\r\nJ. F. Bell, [117] who was gathering information for General Merritt,\r\nto see maps, and further requesting him to place at Bell's disposal any\r\navailable information about the force of the enemy and the topography\r\nof the country. [118]\r\n\r\nOn July 21 he wrote again asking for passes for a Lieutenant\r\nE. I. Bryan and party, who were making a reconnaissance. [119]\r\n\r\nSuch records as I have been able to find do not show what response,\r\nif any, Aguinaldo made to these several requests, but General\r\nAnderson's original views as to the willingness of the Insurgents to\r\ncoöperate with him underwent an early change, for on July 18, 1898,\r\nin a letter to the Adjutant-General of the United States Army he\r\nmakes the following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Insurgent chief, Aguinaldo, has declared himself Dictator\r\n    and self-appointed President. He has declared martial law\r\n    and promulgated a minute method of rule and administration\r\n    under it.\r\n\r\n    \"We have observed all official military courtesies, and he\r\n    and his followers express great admiration and gratitude to\r\n    the great American republic of the north, yet in many ways\r\n    they obstruct our purposes and are using every effort to take\r\n    Manila without us.\r\n\r\n    \"I suspect also that Aguinaldo is secretly negotiating with\r\n    the Spanish authorities, as his confidential aide is in\r\n    Manila.\" [120]\r\n\r\nThis suspicion was entirely justified, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nOn July 24 Aguinaldo wrote a letter to General Anderson in effect\r\nwarning him not to disembark American troops in places conquered by\r\nthe Filipinos from the Spaniards without first communicating in writing\r\nthe places to be occupied and the object of the occupation. [121]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's assumption of civil authority on July 15, 1899, did not\r\npass unnoticed. On July 21 General Anderson wrote the Adjutant-General\r\nof the army concerning it:--\r\n\r\n    \"His assumption of civil authority I have ignored, and let\r\n    him know verbally that I could, and would, not recognize it,\r\n    while I did not recognize him as a military leader. It may\r\n    seem strange that I have made no formal protest against\r\n    his proclamation as Dictator, his declaration of martial\r\n    law, and publication and execution of a despotic form of\r\n    government. I wrote such a protest, but did not publish it,\r\n    at Admiral Dewey's request, and also for fear of wounding\r\n    the susceptibilities of Major-General Merritt, but I have let\r\n    it be known in every other way that we do not recognize the\r\n    Dictatorship. These people only respect force and firmness. I\r\n    submit, with all deference, that we have heretofore underrated\r\n    the natives. They are not ignorant, savage tribes, but have\r\n    a civilization of their own; and although insignificant in\r\n    appearance, are fierce fighters, and for a tropical people\r\n    they are industrious. A small detail of natives will do more\r\n    work in a given time than a regiment of volunteers.\"\r\n\r\nBecause he was invited as general rather than as president, Aguinaldo\r\nrefused to attend a parade and review on the 4th of July. This fact\r\nis, in itself, an answer to his claim that the Americans were tacitly\r\nrecognizing his pretensions.\r\n\r\nAfter referring to this incident, Blount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"On subsequent anniversaries of the day in the Philippines\r\n    it was deemed wise simply to prohibit the reading of our\r\n    declaration before gatherings of the Filipino people. It\r\n    saved discussion.\" [122]\r\n\r\nThis statement is incorrect. I myself was present the following\r\nyear when the declaration was read on the Luneta to a considerable\r\ngathering of Filipinos among whom were many school children, and it\r\nhas often been read since.\r\n\r\nThe landing of American troops at Parañaque and their going into\r\ncamp near that town on July 15 caused much excitement, and a lively\r\ninterchange of telegrams between Insurgent officers followed. [123]\r\n\r\nThey were suspicious of the intentions of the Americans, [124] and\r\ntrouble soon began.\r\n\r\nOn July 16 General Noriel telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"An American has come here who says that he is a Colonel of\r\n    the Army whom we should obey; and that it is your desire. We\r\n    did not listen to him, awaiting your order.\"\r\n\r\nOn the back of the telegram is written the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"Reply.--You should not obey. What this American Colonel says\r\n    is a lie. Be cautious so as not to be deceived. You should\r\n    require from him proof. Be always vigilant, but upright,\r\n    also all of the officers and soldiers must be strict and not\r\n    timid.\" [125]\r\n\r\nObviously there was no real coöperation between American and Filipino\r\ntroops at this time. General Anderson ignored General Aguinaldo's\r\nrequest for information as to places where American troops were to\r\nland in Filipino territory and the objects of disembarking them.\r\n\r\nThe Americans proceeded with their plans for the attack upon Manila,\r\nand it became desirable to occupy some of the Insurgent trenches. On\r\nJuly 29 Arévalo telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In conference with General Greene I asked for an official\r\n    letter, a copy of which I send you: 'Headquarters 2nd Brigade,\r\n    U. S. Expeditionary Forces, Camp Dewey, near Manila, July 29th,\r\n    1898. _El Señor Noriel, General de Brigade_. Sir: In pursuance\r\n    of our conversation of yesterday and the message which Captain\r\n    Arévalo brought to me during the night, I beg to inform you\r\n    that my troops will occupy the intrenchments between the Camino\r\n    Real and the beach, leaving camp for that purpose at 8.00\r\n    o'clock this morning. I will be obliged if you will give the\r\n    necessary orders for the withdrawal of your men. Thanking you\r\n    for your courtesy, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient\r\n    servant, _F. V. Greene, Brigadier General_, commanding.'\" [126]\r\n\r\nThis clear direct declaration of intention by General Greene is the\r\nactual transaction referred to by Blount as \"Jockeying the Insurgents\r\nout of their trenches.\" He bases his statements concerning the matter\r\non a newspaper report.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the army officers in the matter of obtaining permission\r\nto occupy the trenches needed in preparing for the assault on the\r\ncity could not have been more correct.\r\n\r\nOn August 10 General Merritt gave the following emphatic instructions\r\nrelative to the matter:--\r\n\r\n    \"No rupture with Insurgents. This is imperative. Can ask\r\n    Insurgent generals or Aguinaldo for permission to occupy\r\n    their trenches, but if refused not to use force.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day General Anderson wrote to Aguinaldo, asking\r\npermission to occupy a trench facing blockhouse No. 14, in order\r\nto place artillery to destroy it. The permission was granted on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of August, Aguinaldo seems to have avoided\r\nconferences with American officers. On the second of the month Mabini\r\nwrote him how he had put off Admiral Dewey's aid with a false statement\r\nthat he did not know Aguinaldo's whereabouts. [127]\r\n\r\nThe landing of American troops at Parañaque for the assault on Manila\r\nled to the concentration of Insurgent troops at the neighbouring town\r\nof Bacoor. [128]\r\n\r\nOn August 8 Fernando Acevedo [129] wrote to General Pío del Pilar\r\nthat the Americans were going to attack the next day and that,--\r\n\r\n    \"It is requisite and necessary before their attack takes place\r\n    to-morrow, that you to-morrow or to-night annihilate them,\r\n    sparing none, for the way they have deceived us, and will\r\n    again without fail, in the contract signed by Sr. Emilio;\r\n    and convince yourself, my friend, that it is necessary to do\r\n    this; and when it is done the whole world will wonder and say\r\n    that we have done well, and will not be able to give out that\r\n    the people here are fools spending the time sucking their\r\n    fingers.\" [130]\r\n\r\nWorse yet, information was sent to the Spaniards of the proposed\r\nAmerican attack on the 13th instant, as is shown by the following\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n    \"(Battalion of Cazadores, No. 2. Expeditionary. Office of\r\n    the Lieutenant-Colonel. Private.)\r\n\r\n    \"_Señor Don Artemio Ricarte_: [131]\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Sir: I have received to-day your kind letter giving\r\n    warning of the attack on Manila, and I thank you for your\r\n    personal interest in me, which, on my part, I reciprocate. I\r\n    assure you that I am yours, most truly and sincerely,\r\n\r\n    \"_Luis Martinez Alcobendas_.\r\n\r\n    \"_Singalon_, August 10, 1898.\" [132]\r\n\r\nAccording to Taylor, this was not the first occurrence of this\r\nsort. He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The officers of the United States Army who believed that\r\n    the insurgents were informing the Spaniards of the American\r\n    movements were right. Sastrón has printed a letter from Pío\r\n    del Pilar, dated July 30, to the Spanish officer commanding\r\n    at Santa Ana, in which Pilar said that Aguinaldo had told him\r\n    that the Americans would attack the Spanish lines on August 2\r\n    and advised that the Spaniards should not give way, but hold\r\n    their positions. Pilar added, however, that if the Spaniards\r\n    should fall back on the walled city and surrender Santa Ana\r\n    to himself, he would hold it with his own men. Aguinaldo's\r\n    information was correct, and on August 2 eight American\r\n    soldiers were killed or wounded by the Spanish fire.\" [133]\r\n\r\nTaylor continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"And yet Aguinaldo claimed to be an ally of the Americans. It\r\n    is not probable that these were the only two such letters\r\n    written. Aguinaldo had by this time found out that although he\r\n    could defeat the scattered Spanish detachments, he could not\r\n    defeat the Spanish force holding the lines of Manila. He did\r\n    not want the Americans in the Philippines. They were in his\r\n    way, and he had already made up his mind that if they did not\r\n    give him what he wanted, he would drive them out by force. He\r\n    saw very early that it was extremely improbable that he should\r\n    obtain from them what he wanted; accordingly all losses both\r\n    among Spaniards and Americans would, from Aguinaldo's point\r\n    of view, inure to his benefit. The best possible thing for\r\n    him would be to hold his own force intact while they wore\r\n    each other out. The Spanish losses, small as they were,\r\n    occurred in front of the American lines, not in front of the\r\n    Filipinos. There is no reason, accordingly, for believing\r\n    that the Filipinos suffered heavily. To arrange that the\r\n    Spaniards should inflict losses upon the Americans, while he\r\n    saved his own men, showed ingenuity on the part of Aguinaldo;\r\n    but it was decidedly not the conduct of an ally.\" [134]\r\n\r\nThe feeling toward the American troops at this time is further shown\r\nby a telegram from General Pío del Pilar, sent from San Pedro Macati\r\non August 10, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"Commandant Acebedo writes that the Spaniards are about\r\n    to surrender because they want to turn over the place; the\r\n    Americans want them to leave only the batteries and say that\r\n    they will station themselves in said batteries. It appears\r\n    that they want to deceive us; they do not want to give us\r\n    arms, and if they do not give us arms, we shall attack them\r\n    and drive them out. I await your reply.\" [135]\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps not quite the kind of coöperation that Admiral Dewey\r\nand Generals Anderson and Merritt had expected.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Insurgents were determined to capture Manila for\r\nthemselves, not only because of the \"war booty,\" for which they were\r\nhungry, but because of the status which they felt that the taking of\r\nthe capital of the Philippines would assure them. The great importance\r\nwhich they attached to this plan is shown in communications written\r\nby Agoncillo, Aguinaldo and others. [136]\r\n\r\nOf conditions at this time, Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"On July 7, Aguinaldo appointed Artemio Ricarte and Pantaleón\r\n    García to negotiate the surrender of Manila by the Spaniards\r\n    to him (Exhibit 155). On July 5 Pantaleón García was planning\r\n    to enter Manila by way of Tondo or of Santa Cruz (P.I.R.,\r\n    243.7). On the 9th Aguinaldo ordered that rice should be\r\n    gathered from the towns of Manila Province for the use of his\r\n    troops in the decisive attack upon Manila which he intended\r\n    making in a few days (P.I.R., 1087. 5).\r\n\r\n\"Aguinaldo, finding that his chance of obtaining Manila for himself was\r\ngrowing steadily less, now determined to force himself into the city\r\nwith the Americans and demand a consideration for the assistance he\r\nhad rendered them during the siege. It is true he had assisted them,\r\nbut his assistance had not been intentional. It was the result of\r\nthe operations he was carrying on for his own ends. The operations of\r\nthe Filipinos and the Americans were against Spain as a common enemy\r\nof both; but the operations were not joint operations, and although\r\ntheir purpose was a common purpose, it was not a mutual one. On August\r\n8 Aguinaldo appointed General Ricarte commander in the operations\r\nabout Manila, ordered him to respect the property of all foreigners,\r\nand told him that in case his troops succeeded in entering Manila they\r\nwere to carry their flag and plant it there (P.I.R., 703. 2). Judging\r\nfrom an unsigned draft of a letter, he must have warned the foreign\r\nconsuls in Manila about the same time to gather under the protection\r\nof their flags all of their fellow-citizens who had not taken refuge\r\non the vessels in the bay, so that when his troops entered the city\r\nno foreign lives would be taken, and no foreign property would be\r\ninjured. The earnestness with which he urged that all foreigners not\r\nSpaniards should take steps to identify themselves and their property\r\nshows that he considered the persons and property of Spanish civilians\r\nas fair booty of war.\" [137]\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no need of Insurgent assistance in the assault\r\non Manila.\r\n\r\nThe reports which reached Aguinaldo that the surrender of Manila had\r\nbeen agreed upon in advance were correct, as is shown by the following\r\ntestimony of Admiral Dewey:\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. When did you reach an understanding\r\n    with the Spanish commander upon the subject, [138]--how long\r\n    before the 12th or 13th of August?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. Several days before.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. To whom did you communicate the\r\n    arrangement that you had?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. General Merritt and, of course, all of my own\r\n    captains--General Merritt, and I think a council of officers on\r\n    board of one of the steamers. I think there were several army\r\n    officers present when I told the General that; and I may say\r\n    here that I do not think General Merritt took much stock in it.\r\n\r\n    \"_Senator Patterson_. What statement did you make to them,\r\n    Admiral, in substance?\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. That the Spaniards were ready to surrender,\r\n    but before doing so I must engage one of the outlying forts. I\r\n    selected one at Malate, away from the city. [139] They said I\r\n    must engage that and fire for a while, and then I was to make\r\n    a signal by the international code, 'Do you surrender?' Then\r\n    they were to hoist a white flag at a certain bastion; and I\r\n    may say now that I was the first one to discover the white\r\n    flag. We had 50 people looking for that white flag, but I\r\n    happened to be the first one who saw it. I fired for a while,\r\n    and then made the signal according to the programme. We could\r\n    not see the white flag--it was rather a thick day--but finally\r\n    I discovered it on the south bastion; I don't know how long\r\n    it had been flying there when I first saw it.\" [140]\r\n\r\nOn August 12, the day before Manila surrendered, Buencamino telegraphed\r\nAguinaldo, urging him in the strongest terms to attack that night so\r\nthat Americans might be obliged to ask him to stop, with the result\r\nthat the Insurgents would be included in the official negotiations. He\r\nfurther advised Aguinaldo that he must not suspend his attack because\r\nthe Americans suspended theirs. [141]\r\n\r\nGeneral Anderson tells us that, on the evening of August 12,\r\nhe received an order from General Merritt to notify Aguinaldo to\r\nforbid the Insurgents under his command from entering Manila. This\r\nnotification was delivered to Aguinaldo that night, and was received\r\nby him with anger. [142]\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Insurgents actually made an independent\r\nattack of their own, as planned. [143] It promptly led to trouble\r\nwith the Americans, and at 8 A.M. Aguinaldo received a telegram from\r\nGeneral Anderson sternly warning him not to let his troops enter\r\nManila without the consent of the American commander on the south\r\nside of the Pasig River. [144]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo apparently took no action in response to this request,\r\nexcept to direct General Riego de Dios, who was at Cavite, to go\r\nwith Buencamino without losing a moment and ask for an explanation,\r\nin writing if possible. [145]\r\n\r\nAt 10.50 A.M. he telegraphed General Anderson saying that his troops\r\nwere being forced, by threats of violence, to retire from positions\r\nwhich they had taken, and asking Anderson to order his troops to\r\navoid difficulty with the Insurgent forces. Aguinaldo said that he\r\nhad directed his men to aid the American forces if the latter are\r\nattacked by a common enemy, but was discreetly silent on the subject\r\nof their entering Manila. [146]\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, at 11.05, he received a reply to his telegram\r\nto General Riego de Dios, in which that officer communicated the\r\nviews of Araneta [147] and Buencamino, who had been unable to find\r\nGeneral Anderson. This important communication follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. Araneta and Buencamino having been consulted in\r\n    regard to your telegram of to-day, they confirm capitulation,\r\n    and in regard to the telegraphic note of General Anderson\r\n    they are of the opinion, first that we should continue\r\n    hostilities while we ask for an explanation; second, that\r\n    explanation should be in the following terms: Inquire reason\r\n    for note and ask why our troops are not to enter Manila without\r\n    permission of the American commander; third, in case the (terms\r\n    of?) capitulation is given as the reason, to answer that we\r\n    do not suspend our attempt to enter Manila. Its capitulation\r\n    is not favourable to our independence. General Anderson is not\r\n    here. General Merritt is probably in Manila. Only Admiral Dewey\r\n    is in the Bay. We ask authorization to express our explanation\r\n    in the proposed terms and to have a conference with Admiral\r\n    Dewey in order to have our claims reach General Merritt.\" [148]\r\n\r\nAn endorsement written by Mabini and signed by Aguinaldo on the above\r\npaper reads:--\r\n\r\n    \"I authorize every assertion of right, but state that we\r\n    believe that we have the right to enter Manila without\r\n    permission as we have a part in the surrender of the\r\n    Spaniards. They would not have surrendered if our troops had\r\n    not cut off their retreat to the interior. Besides but for us\r\n    the landing of troops would have cost them much blood. Obtain\r\n    an answer as soon as possible in order to lay a protest before\r\n    the consuls in case it is necessary.\" [149]\r\n\r\nNaturally, trouble followed. At 1.30 P.M. General Ricarte telegraphed\r\nto Aguinaldo:--\r\n\r\n    \"Americans wish to put us out. Give directions.\" [150]\r\n\r\nApparently about the same hour he wired more at length, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. American troops rearguard our trenches. Mabolo\r\n    and San José warn us that they will fire on us when the time\r\n    comes. Impossible to remain there without disagreeing with\r\n    them. Since 5 o'clock this morning we have been furiously\r\n    attacking. Americans firing incessantly, Spaniards silent. No\r\n    losses yet.\" [151]\r\n\r\nAt 3.52 he wired again:--\r\n\r\n    \"General Pío del Pilar informs me of the following: 'Come here,\r\n    if possible, as our soldiers at the barrio of Concepción\r\n    are not allowed to go out and we are prohibited to move\r\n    on any farther. We it was who succeeded in capturing that\r\n    place. Come here or there will be trouble, since they are\r\n    driving me away, and refusing to listen to what I say.' I am\r\n    at this very moment going to aforesaid place.\" [152]\r\n\r\nAt 5 P.M. another was sent by Ricarte to Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel San Miguel arrived here from Ermita. Regional\r\n    Exposition, Agricultural College and other buildings are\r\n    ours. Our flag flies already at Ermita. Colonel Agapito Donzón\r\n    with his troops is in the Pérez building, Paco. Colonels Julian\r\n    Ocampo and Isidoro Tolentino are in the convent of Ermita. All\r\n    houses without flag are guarded by our soldiers.\" [153]\r\n\r\nAt 6.15 P.M. he telegraphed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I inform you that the chiefs of our troops have reported to\r\n    me that our flag at Singalong church (_visita_) was removed by\r\n    the Americans and they hoisted theirs instead, not allowing\r\n    us to approach thereto. General Pío del Pilar is at present\r\n    at the barrio of Concepción. Americans prohibited him to move\r\n    on any farther. How can he enter Manila?\" [154]\r\n\r\nNo attention was paid to General Anderson's request that the Insurgent\r\ntroops should not enter Manila without permission. They crowded forward\r\nwith and after the American forces. Coming out on Bagumbayan drive,\r\nthey found American and Spanish troops confronting each other but not\r\nfiring, the former on the drive, the latter on the neighbouring city\r\nwall. A flag of truce was waving from the south bastion, nevertheless\r\nthe Insurgents fired on the Spanish forces, provoking a return fire\r\nwhich killed and wounded American soldiers. Of this incident General\r\nGreene has said:--\r\n\r\n    \"At this point the California regiment a short time before\r\n    had met some insurgents who had fired at the Spaniards on the\r\n    walls, and the latter, in returning the fire, had caused a loss\r\n    in the California regiment of 1 killed and 2 wounded.\" [155]\r\n\r\nSome of these matters must have come to the attention of General\r\nAnderson, for he sent Aguinaldo a telegram, received by the latter\r\nat 6.35 P.M., as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dated Ermita Headquarters 2nd Division 13 to\r\n    Gen. Aguinaldo. Commanding Filipino Forces.--Manila,\r\n    taken. Serious trouble threatened between our forces. Try\r\n    and prevent it. Your troops should not force themselves in\r\n    the city until we have received the full surrender then we\r\n    will negotiate with you.\r\n\r\n    \"_Anderson_, commanding.\" [156]\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Insurgent troops took the suburb of Santa Ana,\r\nand captured Spanish and Filipino officers and men. [157]\r\n\r\nIn view of the known facts, how absurd becomes the following contention\r\nof Aguinaldo, advanced in his \"Reseña Verídica:--\r\n\r\n    \"Our own forces could see the American forces land on the beach\r\n    of the Luneta and of the Paseo de Santa Lucía. The Spanish\r\n    soldiers, who were on the walls of the city, drew the attention\r\n    of every one because they did not fire on the former, a mystery\r\n    which was explained at nightfall of that day, by the news of\r\n    the capitulation of the place by General Señor Jáudenes [158]\r\n    to the American General, Mr. Merritt, a capitulation which\r\n    the American Generals claimed for themselves, an infraction of\r\n    what had been agreed upon with Admiral Dewey, in regard to the\r\n    formation of plans for the attack and taking of Manila by the\r\n    two armies, American and Filipino, together and in combination.\r\n\r\n    \"This inexplicable line of conduct on the part of the American\r\n    officers was made clearer by the telegrams, which General\r\n    Anderson addressed to me, from Maytubig on the said 13th day,\r\n    requesting that I should order our troops not to enter Manila,\r\n    which request was refused, inasmuch as it was contrary to what\r\n    was agreed upon, and to the high ends of the Revolutionary\r\n    Government, which, on taking upon itself the immense work of\r\n    besieging Manila, during the two months and a half, sacrificing\r\n    thousands of lives and millions in material interests, could\r\n    not surely have done so with any object other than that of\r\n    capturing Manila and the Spanish garrison which with firmness\r\n    and tenacity defended that place.\" [159]\r\n\r\nOn August 14 Aguinaldo telegraphed General Anderson as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"My troops, who have been for so long besieging Manila,\r\n    have always been promised that they could appear in it,\r\n    as you know and cannot deny, and for this reason, and on\r\n    account of the many sacrifices made of money, and lives, I\r\n    do not consider it prudent to issue orders to the contrary,\r\n    as they might be disobeyed against my authority. Besides, I\r\n    hope that you will allow the troops to enter because we have\r\n    given proofs many times of our friendship, ceding our positions\r\n    at Parañaque, Pasay, Singálon and Maytubig. Nevertheless,\r\n    if it seems best to you, and in order to enter into a frank\r\n    and friendly understanding and avoid any disagreeable conflict\r\n    before the eyes of the Spaniards, I will commission Don Felipe\r\n    Buencamino and others, who will to-day go out from our lines\r\n    and hold a conference with you, and that they will be safe\r\n    during the conference.\" [160]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo and his associates pressed the demand for joint\r\noccupation. On August 13 Admiral Dewey and General Merritt informed\r\nthe government that since the occupation of Manila and its suburbs\r\nthe Insurgents outside had been insisting on this, and asked how far\r\nthey might proceed in enforcing obedience in the matter.\r\n\r\nThey were informed by a telegram dated August 17 that the President\r\nof the United States had directed:--\r\n\r\n    \"That there must be no joint occupation with the\r\n    Insurgents. The United States in the possession of Manila city,\r\n    Manila bay and harbor must preserve the peace and protect\r\n    persons and property within the territory occupied by their\r\n    military and naval forces. The insurgents and all others\r\n    must recognize the military occupation and authority of the\r\n    United States and the cessation of hostilities proclaimed\r\n    by the President. Use whatever means in your judgment are\r\n    necessary to this end.\" [161]\r\n\r\nThis left the military and naval commanders no option in the premises,\r\nand in any event dual occupation was out of the question because of\r\nthe lawlessness of the Insurgent troops.\r\n\r\nAt this very time they were looting the portions of the city which\r\nthey occupied, and as is abundantly shown by their own records were\r\nnot confining their attacks to Spaniards, but were assaulting their\r\nown people and raiding the property of foreigners as well. [162] The\r\ncontinuation of such a condition of affairs was manifestly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Insurgents promptly demanded their share in the \"war booty,\"\r\nand asked certain other extraordinary concessions as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"(4) Our sacrifices in coöperating in the siege and taking\r\n    of Manila being well known, it is just that we should share\r\n    in the war booty.\r\n\r\n    \"(5) We demand for our use the palace of Malacañang and the\r\n    Convents of Malate, Ermita and Paco or San Fernando de Dilao.\r\n\r\n    \"(6) We demand that the civil offices of Manila be filled\r\n    by North Americans and never by Spaniards; but if General\r\n    Merritt should require some Filipinos we should be pleased if\r\n    he will grant our President, Don Emilio Aguinaldo, the favour\r\n    of recommending select and skilled Filipinos. The jurisdiction\r\n    of the authorities of Manila shall not be recognized beyond\r\n    the municipal radius.\r\n\r\n    \"(7) The American forces shall not approach nor penetrate\r\n    our military positions without permission of the respective\r\n    commanders thereof and shall evacuate all the positions\r\n    which they occupy at the present time beyond the municipal\r\n    radius; Spaniards who pass our lines without permission of\r\n    the commander will be considered as spies.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"(10) Lastly we state clearly that our concessions and\r\n    petitions do not signify on our part that we recognize the\r\n    sovereignty of North America in these islands, as they are\r\n    made necessary by the present war.\" [163]\r\n\r\nUnder the instructions of the President these demands could not be\r\nacceded to. Nor could they have been acceded to had there been no\r\nsuch instructions. In this connection the following extract from\r\nGeneral Jáudenes's cablegram for June 8th to his home government is\r\nhighly significant:--\r\n\r\n    \"Population of suburbs have taken refuge in walled city from\r\n    fear of outrages of insurgents, preferring to run risks of\r\n    bombardment, which has not yet begun.\" [164]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the population of the suburbs did not have a high\r\nidea of Insurgent discipline.\r\n\r\nThat their apprehensions were not groundless is shown by a passage\r\nin a letter sent the following day to Governor-General Augustin\r\nby Buencamino:--\r\n\r\n    \"Manila being surrounded by land and by sea, without hope of\r\n    assistance from anywhere, and Señor Aguinaldo being disposed to\r\n    make use of the fleet in order to bombard, if Your Excellency\r\n    should prolong the struggle with tenacity, I do not know,\r\n    frankly, what else to do other than to succumb dying, but\r\n    Your Excellency knows that the entrance of 100,000 Indians,\r\n    [165] inflamed with battle, drunk with triumph and with\r\n    blood, will produce the hecatomb from which there will not\r\n    be allowed to escape either women, children, or Peninsular\r\n    friars,--especially the friars; and, I believe that the rights\r\n    of humanity, imperilled in such a serious way, should be well\r\n    considered by Your Excellency, for however dear glory and\r\n    military duty may be, although worth as much or more than\r\n    existence itself there is no right by which they should be\r\n    won at the cost of the rights of humanity, and the latter\r\n    outweigh every consideration and all duty.\" [166]\r\n\r\nDon Felipe knew his own people. He also knew, none better, what they\r\nhad in mind at this time.\r\n\r\nAs it was the Insurgent forces made the most of such opportunity as\r\nthey had, and their own records show it.\r\n\r\nIn the suburbs of Manila they sacked and committed outrages,\r\nthreatening people with their arms, and this was still going on a\r\nweek after the fall of Manila. [167]\r\n\r\nGeneral Pío del Pilar was believed to be responsible for much of this\r\nmisconduct, and Mabini proposed that as it was necessary for him to\r\nleave the vicinity of Manila, and they could not remove him by force,\r\nhe be promoted. [168]\r\n\r\nSome time during this month Sandico wrote Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Americans have already heard of the frequent cases\r\n    of kidnapping (_dukut_) occurring in Tondo, San Sebastián\r\n    and San Miguel. Last night some of ours were surprised in\r\n    the act of kidnapping a person. I have also heard that many\r\n    persons are asking for contributions of war. I tell them [169]\r\n    that you know nothing of all this and that if some persons\r\n    are kidnapped it is due to the hate of the natives for the\r\n    Spanish spies and secret police, which is great.\" [170]\r\n\r\nEvidently Sandico continued to interest himself in the matter of\r\npreventing disorder, for on September 24, 1898, he wrote Aguinaldo\r\nfrom Manila as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"By authority of General Don Pío del Pilar and accompanied\r\n    by the War Auditor, Señor Urbano, we entered a prison where\r\n    the individuals Mariano de la Cruz and Mariano Crisóstomo\r\n    were kept. They were almost prostrated. They had lately\r\n    been released from Bilibid where they had been confined\r\n    for political crimes. On being asked the reason for their\r\n    imprisonment they began by showing us their bodies from which\r\n    blood still issued as the result of the barbarous treatment\r\n    received from Major Carmona who, by the way, is the same\r\n    person of whom I spoke to you in one of my previous letters;\r\n    I declared to you then that he had assaulted, revolver in hand,\r\n    a man in the middle of one of the most frequented streets of\r\n    the suburb of Paco on pure suspicion.\r\n\r\n    \"The prisoners in question stated that if they admitted the\r\n    accusations made against them it was for fear of greater\r\n    punishments promised by said Major. The officer of the guard\r\n    took the liberty of striking with his fist the one who dared\r\n    to express himself so.\r\n\r\n    \"Before such a spectacle Major Bell found himself forced to\r\n    tell them that brutal acts are not precisely a recommendation\r\n    for a country that wished to be free and that they, the\r\n    Americans, do not arrest any one without just cause. [171]\r\n\r\n    \"I take the liberty of calling your attention to the matter\r\n    in question and other abuses in order that the measures you\r\n    may think fit be adopted to remedy this evil. In fact, we are\r\n    making a target of ourselves in the sight of all nations,\r\n    especially so in that of the Americans who note any act of\r\n    ours and judge us secretly now in order to do so later in\r\n    public. To make light of this is to plant a seed of future\r\n    injury to us, because many will desire to place themselves\r\n    under the protection of the American flag, seeing that ours\r\n    refuses to defend the citizens' individual rights.\r\n\r\n    \"I, for my part, ask that Major Carmona be arrested together\r\n    with his accomplices in the matter so that it may serve as\r\n    a lesson not only for him but also for those who think like\r\n    him.\" [172]\r\n\r\nObviously Sandico's protest of September 24 did not produce the\r\ndesired result, for on September 28 he wrote Aguinaldo a long letter\r\ncomplaining that in Manila personal security did not exist, people\r\nwere being tortured and murdered, kidnapping and theft were very\r\nfrequent, and these abuses were being committed by Filipino officers\r\nand men. Some of the things which had come to his knowledge were of\r\nsuch a nature that he preferred to speak to Aguinaldo privately about\r\nthem. [173]\r\n\r\nMurder, pillaging, torture of prisoners, kidnapping, theft--these\r\nare not pleasant things, but they continued to occur, and Aguinaldo,\r\nwho apparently desired to prevent them, was powerless to do so. He\r\ndid not dare discipline General Pío del Pilar, nor remove him from\r\nthe vicinity of Manila, and the soldiers of that officer continued\r\nto work their will on their own unfortunate and helpless people.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo at first flatly refused to direct the disorderly Insurgent\r\nforces to leave Manila. The American commander showed great forbearance\r\nand negotiations continued.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1898, the Diplomatic Commission (Buencamino and Gregorio\r\nAraneta) telegraphed Aguinaldo that a clause in a proposed agreement\r\nrequiring prior permission of Insurgent officers before American\r\ntroops could pass or approach their lines had greatly displeased\r\nGeneral Anderson who declined to treat until after the withdrawal of\r\nNoriel's troops from Manila. [174]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's reply, sent on August 17, 1898, shows that he had already\r\nmade up his mind to fight the Americans, for it contains the following\r\nsignificant words: \"The conflict is coming sooner or later and we\r\nshall gain nothing by asking as favours of them what are really our\r\nrights.\" [175]\r\n\r\nWhile negotiations were pending General Merritt sent Major J. F. Bell\r\nto Aguinaldo with a letter and also with a memorandum in which were\r\nthe words:--\r\n\r\n    \"In case you find Aguinaldo inclined to be generous in his\r\n    arrangements with us, you may communicate to him as follows:\r\n    ...\"\r\n\r\nThere follow six paragraphs, of which the third is of special\r\nimportance. It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"(3) That I have every disposition to represent liberally\r\n    the Government at Washington, which I know is inclined to\r\n    deal fairly with him and his people; but not knowing what the\r\n    policy of that Government will be, I am not prepared to make\r\n    any promises, except that in the event of the United States\r\n    withdrawing from these islands care will be taken to leave\r\n    him _in as good condition as he was found by the forces of\r\n    the Government_. [176]\r\n\r\nRelative to the italicized portion of this statement Major Bell says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I was pressed to explain further just what meaning General\r\n    M. meant to convey by the underscored portion of this remark,\r\n    but I replied that I had repeated the language General M. had\r\n    used to me, and I preferred they should seek any further\r\n    explanation from him, lest I might unwittingly fall into error\r\n    if I undertook to explain his meaning myself. Their lack of\r\n    definiteness and my unwillingness to comment upon the language\r\n    seemed to arouse their apprehensions and suspicions. They\r\n    have been trying ever since to obtain in writing some definite\r\n    promise on this subject.\" [177]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo ordered that the machinery of the water works be started up\r\nat once, a thing which was very necessary as Manila was suffering from\r\nlack of water. I should be glad if I could leave this matter here,\r\nbut I cannot, for Major Bell elsewhere makes the further statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"Attention is invited to General Merritt's promise made known\r\n    to Aguinaldo by me verbally, namely, that in the event of the\r\n    United States withdrawing from these islands, care would be\r\n    taken to leave Aguinaldo in as good condition as he was found\r\n    by the forces of the Government. From a remark the General\r\n    made to me I inferred he intended to interpret the expression\r\n    'forces of the Government' to mean the naval forces, should\r\n    future contingencies necessitate such an interpretation.\" [178]\r\n\r\nLet us hope that Major Bell misunderstood General Merritt's\r\nintention. If this is not the case, I must say in all frankness that\r\nin my opinion it was General Merritt's intention to indulge in sharp\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nObviously, the American naval forces did not find Aguinaldo in any\r\n\"condition,\" in the sense in which General Merritt uses the term. On\r\nthe contrary, they brought him from Hongkong and assisted him in\r\nstarting a revolution. The negotiations in question were relative\r\nto the positions held by the Insurgents at the time the negotiations\r\ntook place, and General Merritt's promise could not legitimately be\r\ninterpreted to refer to anything else.\r\n\r\nHad Aguinaldo accepted his offer, a most embarrassing situation would\r\nhave resulted. General Merritt was obviously not authorized to make\r\nsuch a proposition in the first instance, and the only honourable\r\ncourse left open to him would have been to advise Washington of his\r\nimproper action and beg the Government to support him in it and thus\r\nsave the honour of the country.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Aguinaldo did not act upon the promise nor accept the\r\noffer. On the contrary, he promptly and indignantly denied that he\r\nwas committed to anything, and sought to impose new conditions which\r\nwere not acceded to.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some one doubtless got hold of General Merritt and called\r\nhis attention to the fact that in making this offer he had grossly\r\nexceeded his authority, for in his reply to Aguinaldo's protest\r\nGeneral Merritt says:--\r\n\r\n    \"So far as any promises as to what should be done in the event\r\n    of a conclusion of a treaty between the United States and Spain\r\n    are concerned, it is utterly impossible for me as the military\r\n    representative only of the United States to make any promises\r\n    such as you request. As you have already been informed, you\r\n    may depend upon the good will of the Americans out here and\r\n    the Government, of which you already know the beneficence,\r\n    to determine these matters in the future.\" [179]\r\n\r\nComing, as this statement did, after the offer made in the memorandum\r\nhereinbefore referred to, it must have aroused the suspicions of\r\nAguinaldo and his associates, and in my opinion Merritt's conduct in\r\nmaking such a proposal in the first instance was inexcusable.\r\n\r\nBefore he could terminate the negotiations which followed he was called\r\naway, and turned this matter, together with other unfinished business,\r\nover to his successor, General E. S. Otis.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 1898, the latter official wrote to Aguinaldo as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"_General Aguinaldo, Bacoor_:\r\n\r\n    \"Referring to promise made by General Merritt to reply to\r\n    your letter of August 27 within four days, I desire to state\r\n    that he was unexpectedly ordered away and had not opportunity\r\n    to reply. Being unacquainted with the situation, I must take\r\n    time to inform myself before answering, which I will do at\r\n    the earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\n    \"_Otis_.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 8 General Otis wrote Aguinaldo a long letter fully\r\ndiscussing the whole situation in the light of the complete information\r\nwhich he had meanwhile obtained. Since so much has been made of this\r\nincident by Blount and others, I invite attention to the following\r\nextracts from General Otis's letter, which embody a fair and judicial\r\nstatement of the conditions which existed:--\r\n\r\n    \"You designate certain lines within the suburbs of the\r\n    city of Manila, to which you promise to retire your troops,\r\n    and name as conditions precedent: First, protection to your\r\n    shipping by the United States Navy, and the free navigation of\r\n    your vessels within the waters in United States occupation;\r\n    second, restitution to your forces of all positions which\r\n    are now occupied by your troops, in the event that treaty\r\n    stipulations between the United States and Spain surrender to\r\n    the last-named government the territory occupied by the former;\r\n    and thirdly, that United States troops now occupying positions\r\n    beyond the lines you name shall retire within the same.\r\n\r\n    \"A discussion of your proposition to hold, jointly, with\r\n    the United States Government, the city of Manila, involves\r\n    consideration of some of the other concessions you desire to\r\n    be made, and to that I will at once refer. I wish to present\r\n    the matter, in the first instance, in its legal aspect,\r\n    although, from remarks contained in former correspondence,\r\n    I am of the opinion that you are fully aware how untenable\r\n    the proposition is. The United States and Spain were and\r\n    are belligerent parties to a war, and were so recognized\r\n    by the civilized world. In the course of events the entire\r\n    city of Manila, then in full possession of Spanish forces,\r\n    was surrendered to the first-named belligerent power. The\r\n    articles of agreement and capitulation gave the United States\r\n    Government full occupancy of the city and defences of Manila,\r\n    and that Government obligated itself to insure the safety\r\n    of the lives and property of the inhabitants of the city\r\n    to the best of its ability. By all the laws of war and all\r\n    international precedents the United States authority over\r\n    Manila and its defences is full and supreme, and it cannot\r\n    escape the obligations which it has assumed.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"But conceding, as you do, the strictly legal right of my\r\n    Government to hold and administer the affairs of the city\r\n    of Manila and its suburbs (I thus conclude from expressions\r\n    contained in former correspondence and from my appreciation of\r\n    your intellectual attainments), you base your proposition--a\r\n    joint occupation--upon supposed equitable grounds, referring\r\n    to the sacrifices your troops have made and the assistance they\r\n    have rendered the American forces in the capture of Manila. It\r\n    is well known they have made personal sacrifices, endured\r\n    great hardships, and have rendered aid. But is it forgotten\r\n    that my Government has swept the Spanish navy from the seas\r\n    of both hemispheres; sent back to Spain the Spanish army and\r\n    navy forces, recently embarked for your destruction, and the\r\n    secure holding of the Philippine possessions; that since May\r\n    1 last its navy has held the city of Manila at its mercy,\r\n    but out of consideration of humanity refused to bombard it,\r\n    preferring to send troops to demand surrender, and thereby\r\n    preserve the lives and property of the inhabitants? Is it\r\n    forgotten that the destruction of the Spanish navy and the\r\n    retention of Spanish armed men in its European possessions\r\n    has opened up to you the ports of the Island of Luzon and\r\n    held Spain helpless to meet its refractory subjects?\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Apart from all legal and equitable considerations, and\r\n    those having their origin in personally conceived ideas of\r\n    justice, I wish respectfully to call your attention to the\r\n    impracticability of maintaining a joint occupation of Manila\r\n    and its suburbs, and in this I know that I shall have the\r\n    approval of your excellent judgment. It would be extremely\r\n    difficult to prevent friction between our respective forces,\r\n    which might result in unfortunate consequences, labor as we may\r\n    for continued harmonious relations. Located in close proximity,\r\n    irresponsible members of our organizations, by careless or\r\n    impertinent action, might be the means of inciting grave\r\n    disturbances; and in this connection I call to your attention\r\n    the recent shooting affair at Cavite, which still requires\r\n    investigation. There might also arise conflict of authority\r\n    between our subordinate officers. Even now, within precincts\r\n    in entire actual possession of our troops, I find that permits\r\n    are given to citizens, who are styled local presidents, to make\r\n    arrests, to carry arms, etc., in violation of our instructions\r\n    and authority, and that several cases of kidnapping have\r\n    taken place. In pursuance of our obligations to maintain,\r\n    in so far as we can, domestic tranquillity, our officers have\r\n    arrested suspected parties, and they have asserted (with what\r\n    element of truth I know not) that the insurgent forces are the\r\n    offenders. I have declined to accept their statements, as I\r\n    prefer to believe the contrary, although it would appear that\r\n    officers connected with those forces have issued the permits\r\n    to which I allude. Such interference with our administration\r\n    of civil affairs must eventually result in conflict.\r\n\r\n    \"... And here permit me to remark upon a view of the subject\r\n    you have advocated in support of the plea for dual occupation\r\n    of the city's suburbs. Your forces, you say in substance,\r\n    should have a share in the booty resulting from the conquest\r\n    of the city, on account of hardships endured and assistance\r\n    rendered. The facts on which you base your conclusion granted,\r\n    your conclusion, under the rules of war which are binding on my\r\n    Government, does not follow, for it has never recognized the\r\n    existence of spoils of war, denominated 'booty,' as have many\r\n    European governments. No enemy's property of any kind, public\r\n    or private, can be seized, claimed by, or awarded to, any of\r\n    its officers or men, and should they attempt to appropriate\r\n    any of it for their individual benefit, they would be very\r\n    severely punished through military tribunals, on which have\r\n    been conferred by law very sweeping jurisdiction. The enemy's\r\n    money and property (all that is not necessary to be expended in\r\n    administering local affairs in the enemy's territory) must be\r\n    preserved for final arbitrament or settlement by and between\r\n    the supreme authorities of the nations concerned. My troops\r\n    cannot acquire booty nor any individual benefit by reason of\r\n    the capture of an enemy's territory. I make this comment,\r\n    believing that you hold erroneous opinions in respect to\r\n    individual advantages which occupation bestows.\r\n\r\n    \"I request your indulgence while I briefly consider the\r\n    concessions you ask us to make as conditions precedent to the\r\n    retirement of your forces to the lines indicated by your note\r\n    of the 27th ultimo.\r\n\r\n    \"The first is: Protection to your shipping and free navigation\r\n    to your vessels. Neither the extent of protection nor the limit\r\n    of free navigation you request is understood. Certainly you\r\n    could not mean protection on the high seas, or in the ports\r\n    not in the rightful possession of the United States. That,\r\n    as you are fully aware, could only be effected by treaty,\r\n    or guarantee, following international recognition of\r\n    the belligerent rights of the Philippine revolutionary\r\n    government. While the existing armistice continues, the\r\n    United States are in rightful possession, in so far as the\r\n    navigable waters of the Philippine Islands are concerned, only\r\n    of the bay of Manila and its navigable tributaries. Within the\r\n    same all vessels of trade and commerce and the war vessels\r\n    of recognized national powers sail freely as long as the\r\n    sovereignty of my Government is not assailed nor the peace of\r\n    the locality threatened. In this respect, whatever concessions\r\n    are extended by way of relaxation of trade restrictions,\r\n    incident to war, to the citizens of these islands will be\r\n    extended to all alike, and discrimination in this regard\r\n    is neither intended nor permitted. Admiral Dewey exercises\r\n    supervision over all naval matters, and they are in no way\r\n    related to the duties conferred upon me by law. Nor would\r\n    it avail should I seek his consent for greater latitude of\r\n    action, for even if disposed to grant special concessions he\r\n    could not do so, and I doubt if the supreme authority of my\r\n    Government could now, under the prevailing truce with Spain,\r\n    invest him with the requisite powers to do so and at the same\r\n    time preserve its international obligations.\r\n\r\n    \"The second concession named by you is restitution of positions\r\n    in the city of Manila to your forces, in case the treaty\r\n    of peace remands to Spain the territory surrendered under\r\n    the late capitulatory articles; and the third and last is a\r\n    promise to retire our troops within the lines indicated by\r\n    you, as the lines on which you desire your troops to remain\r\n    permanently. These propositions, having a kindred nature,\r\n    may be considered together, and, indeed, have already been\r\n    impliedly answered. From previous statements of facts and\r\n    logical conclusions made and stated in this communication,\r\n    concerning the nature of the obligations resting on the United\r\n    States with regard to the territory to which they have the\r\n    legal right of possession under contracting articles with\r\n    Spain, it is evident that neither in law or morals can the\r\n    concessions be made. I would be powerless to grant them in any\r\n    aspect of the case, being nothing more than an agent to carry\r\n    out the instructions of the executive head of my Government and\r\n    not being vested with discretionary power to determine matters\r\n    of such moment. In the present instance I am not only powerless\r\n    to accede to your request, but have been strictly enjoined\r\n    by my Government, mindful of its international promises and\r\n    national honour, which it has never broken nor sacrificed,\r\n    not to accede joint occupation of the city and suburbs of\r\n    Manila and am directed specially to preserve the peace and\r\n    protect persons and property within the territory surrendered\r\n    under the terms of the Spanish capitulation. These mandates\r\n    must be obeyed.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus have I endeavoured with all candor and sincerity,\r\n    holding nothing in reserve, to place before you the situation\r\n    as understood by me, and I doubt not by the Republic\r\n    which I represent. I have not been instructed as to what\r\n    policy the United States intends to pursue in regard to its\r\n    legitimate holdings here, and hence I am unable to give you\r\n    any information on the subject. That it will have a care\r\n    and labor conscientiously for the welfare of your people I\r\n    sincerely believe. It remains for you, beneficiaries of its\r\n    sacrifices, to adopt a course of action which will manifest\r\n    your good intentions and show to the world the principles\r\n    which actuate your proceedings.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"It only remains for me to respectfully notify you that I am\r\n    compelled by my instructions to direct that your armed forces\r\n    evacuate the entire city of Manila, including its suburbs\r\n    and defences, and that I shall be obliged to take action with\r\n    that end in view within a very short space of time should you\r\n    decline to comply with my Government's demands; and I hereby\r\n    serve notice on you that unless your troops are withdrawn\r\n    beyond the line of the city's defences before Thursday,\r\n    the 15th instant, I shall be obliged to resort to forcible\r\n    action, and that my Government will hold you responsible for\r\n    any unfortunate consequences which may ensue.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"In conclusion, I beg to inform you that I have conferred\r\n    freely with Admiral Dewey upon the contents of this\r\n    communication and am delegated by him to state that he fully\r\n    approves of the same in all respects; that the commands of\r\n    our Government compel us to act as herein indicated, and\r\n    that between our respective forces there will be unanimity\r\n    and complete concert of action.\"\r\n\r\nThis calm and temperate discussion of the situation, coupled with\r\nthe firm statement of intention with which it closed, produced a\r\ndecided effect on Aguinaldo. Concerning the events to which it led,\r\nGeneral Otis has made this statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"On September 13, a commission sent by Aguinaldo and consisting\r\n    of three members, one of whom was the treasurer and another\r\n    the attorney-general of the insurgent government, called\r\n    for the purpose of discussing the subject of my letter of\r\n    the 8th. They asked me to withdraw it and simply request\r\n    in writing that the insurgent troops retire to the line\r\n    designated by General Merritt, which I refused to do, stating\r\n    that unless they withdrew as directed we would be obliged to\r\n    resort to force. They then asked that I withdraw the letter\r\n    and issue a request unaccompanied by any threat to use force,\r\n    as Aguinaldo was fearful that he would be unable to remove\r\n    his troops upon a demand. To which I replied that the letter\r\n    of the 8th instant would stand. They then said that as the\r\n    demands of that letter must remain unchanged, the insurgents\r\n    would withdraw as directed therein, but that if I would express\r\n    in writing a simple request to Aguinaldo to withdraw to the\r\n    lines which I designated--something which he could show to the\r\n    troops and induce them to think that he was simply acting upon\r\n    a request from these headquarters--he would probably be able to\r\n    retire his men without much difficulty; that, of course, they\r\n    themselves understood the direction to withdraw, which would\r\n    be obeyed, and thereupon repeated their desire to obtain a note\r\n    of request, whereupon I furnished them with the following:--\r\n\r\n        \"'_Office U. S. Military Governor in the_\r\n\r\n        \"'_Philippine Islands_,\r\n\r\n        \"'_Manila_, P.

We have discussed\r\n        at length the complications now existing, which will\r\n        exist, and will doubtless increase, while our troops\r\n        continue to occupy jointly certain districts of the\r\n        city of Manila. I have urged upon them the necessity\r\n        of the withdrawal of your troops in order that the\r\n        friendly relations which have always been maintained\r\n        by and between them and the forces of the United\r\n        States Government may be perpetuated.

This certain agents of Aguinaldo asked\r\n    on the previous day to be permitted to retain for a short\r\n    time, on the plea that the general officer in command [180]\r\n    would not obey instructions, and they proposed to remove his\r\n    men gradually by organizations and thereafter to punish him\r\n    for his disobedience. The withdrawal was effected adroitly,\r\n    as the insurgents marched out in excellent spirits, cheering\r\n    the American troops.\" [181]\r\n\r\nI have given the facts thus fully for the reason that this is the one\r\ninstance I have found in which a promise was made, fortunately in the\r\nform of an offer which was not accepted, and then withdrawn. It has\r\nseemed to me that the reasons why General Merritt should never have\r\nmade it, and why General Otis could not possibly have renewed it,\r\nshould be fully set forth.\r\n\r\nOn September 7, 1898, General Otis had cabled to Washington that\r\nAdmiral Dewey and he considered conditions critical, and that\r\nthe number of armed Insurgents in the city was large and rapidly\r\nincreasing. He stated that on the 8th he would send a notification\r\nto Aguinaldo that unless the latter's troops were withdrawn beyond\r\nthe line of the suburbs of the cry before September 15 he would be\r\nobliged to resort to forcible action and that the United States would\r\nhold Aguinaldo responsible for any unfortunate consequences which\r\nmight ensue.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo still hoped to obtain recognition of his government by the\r\nUnited States, but did not consider such recognition probable, and\r\npushed preparations to attack if a favorable opportunity should offer.\r\n\r\nBefore occupying ourselves with these preparations, let us briefly\r\nreview the results of our investigations as to Insurgent coöperation\r\nwith the American forces up to this time.\r\n\r\nTaylor has made the following excellent summary of the case:--\r\n\r\n    \"Up to this time Aguinaldo had continued a desultory\r\n    warfare with the Spanish troops in Manila. That none of his\r\n    attacks were very serious is shown from the Spanish reports\r\n    of casualties; but although he had failed to secure the\r\n    surrender of the city to himself, he had kept its garrison\r\n    occupied and within their works. The American force on land\r\n    was now strong enough to begin offensive operations. So\r\n    far the relations between the Americans and Aguinaldo had\r\n    not been really friendly. They were in his way, and yet he\r\n    could not break with them, for he hoped to use them for the\r\n    attainment of the designs which he had by this time frankly\r\n    declared. The Americans had listened to these declarations,\r\n    and had not answered them, nor was it possible to answer\r\n    them. The American forces were there under the instructions\r\n    of the President to make war on Spain and to establish a\r\n    military government in the Philippines. Aguinaldo had declared\r\n    himself a dictator and the Philippines independent. To have\r\n    recognized him in his civil capacity, to have dealt with him\r\n    in his civil capacity, would have meant a recognition of his\r\n    government by the military commander in the field--a thing\r\n    impossible and unlawful. Officers of the United States forces\r\n    are not empowered to recognize governments; that function is\r\n    reserved to the President of the United States; and in this\r\n    case he, in his orders to the Secretary of War, dated May 19,\r\n    copies of which were forwarded to General Merritt for his\r\n    guidance, informed him that the army of occupation was sent\r\n    to the Philippines 'for the twofold purpose of completing the\r\n    reduction of the Spanish power in that quarter and of giving\r\n    order and security to the islands while in the possession\r\n    of the United States.' These instructions contemplated the\r\n    establishment of a military government in the archipelago by\r\n    military officials of the United States.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"it is true that in spite of the date of these instructions\r\n    General Merritt in San Francisco had received no copy of\r\n    them on August 28, three days after the departure of General\r\n    Anderson, and what that officer knew of them could only have\r\n    been what General Merritt remembered of the contents of an\r\n    unsigned copy of them shown him at the White House, but they\r\n    were in accordance with the practice of the United States\r\n    Government in occupying conquered territory, that practice\r\n    General Anderson well knew, and his relations with Aguinaldo\r\n    were guided by it.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"It has been claimed that Aguinaldo and his followers received\r\n    the impression at this time from their conversation with\r\n    American officers that the United States would undoubtedly\r\n    recognize the independence of the Philippines, and that the\r\n    cooperation of the insurgents was due to this impression. There\r\n    was no cooperation. That he attempted in vain to secure the\r\n    surrender of Manila to himself was not cooperation. That\r\n    he refrained from attacking the Americans and occasionally\r\n    permitted them to be furnished supplies, for which they paid,\r\n    was not cooperation. The fact that for a time their plans and\r\n    his plans were parallel does not mean cooperation. Aguinaldo\r\n    was forced by the exigencies of the situation, by the necessity\r\n    of strengthening his hold upon the people, by the necessities\r\n    of his operations against the Spaniards, to make Spaniards\r\n    and natives alike believe that all that he did was with\r\n    the aid of the Americans by whom he would be supported in\r\n    all his acts. He needed their support, and if he could not\r\n    obtain that he needed the appearance of their support for the\r\n    attainment of his ends; and this he was forced to purchase by\r\n    compliance, or apparent compliance, with their demands. But\r\n    his compliance with them, as all American officers serving\r\n    there well knew, was never willing, was never complete,\r\n    and was never given except under pressure. It is true that\r\n    writers upon the subject, speaking with the confidence which is\r\n    born of insufficient and incomplete information, assure their\r\n    readers that any government but that of the United States, any\r\n    colonial administrators but Americans, would have been able to\r\n    obtain the hearty cooperation of Aguinaldo and his followers by\r\n    judicious concessions to them at this time. The only concession\r\n    which would have obtained that hearty cooperation would have\r\n    been the recognition of the independence of the Philippines\r\n    under a United States protectorate, of Aguinaldo clothed with\r\n    the plenitude of the powers of the Katipúnan as dictator, and\r\n    a promise to promptly withdraw from the islands. This promise\r\n    the Government of the United States could not make. Until the\r\n    ratification of a treaty of peace with Spain the insurgents of\r\n    the Philippine Islands were rebellious subjects of Spain, and\r\n    with them, except as fighting men, no relations could be had.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"No report of operations or returns of strength were rendered\r\n    by Aguinaldo at this or any other time to any American\r\n    commander, and no American commander ever rendered such\r\n    returns to him. At the time of General Merritt's arrival, and\r\n    until Manila was occupied by the Americans, the insurgents and\r\n    United States troops were united solely by the fact that they\r\n    had Manila as a common objective. Conditions were such that\r\n    the Americans, in order to obtain its surrender, had to avoid\r\n    doing anything which might cause the insurgents to attack them\r\n    and perhaps make terms with Spain; while Aguinaldo and his\r\n    followers, in order to accomplish the surrender of Manila to\r\n    themselves, had to maintain such relations with the Americans\r\n    as would induce the Spaniards to believe that their fleet\r\n    was at his disposal, [182] and also such apparent harmony\r\n    and cooperation with them in the execution of their plans\r\n    that the recalcitrant among the Filipinos would be forced to\r\n    believe that the Americans would in all ways use their forces\r\n    to support Aguinaldo in the attainment of his desires.\r\n\r\n    \"General Merritt saw this and the necessity for immediately\r\n    taking such steps as would lead to his occupation of\r\n    Manila. With the arrival of the third expedition he was able\r\n    to pass through the insurgent lines between Camp Dewey and\r\n    Manila, for he had sufficient force to accept no refusal\r\n    from Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\n    \"In his report he said that the insurgents had obtained\r\n    positions of investment opposite the Spanish lines along\r\n    their full extent, and that on the bay front their lines ran\r\n    within 800 yards of San Antonio Abad. The approaches to the\r\n    beach and village of Pasay were in their possession.\r\n\r\n    \"'This anomalous state of affairs, namely, having a line\r\n    of quasi-hostile native troops between our forces and the\r\n    Spanish position, was, of course, very objectionable, but it\r\n    was difficult to deal with owing to the peculiar conditions\r\n    of our relations with the insurgents.... As General Aguinaldo\r\n    did not visit me on my arrival nor offer his services as a\r\n    subordinate military leader, and as my instructions from the\r\n    President fully contemplated the occupation of the islands by\r\n    the American land forces, and stated that \"the powers of the\r\n    military occupant are absolute and supreme and immediately\r\n    operate upon the political condition of the inhabitants,\"\r\n    I did not consider it wise to hold any direct communication\r\n    with the insurgent leader until I should be in possession\r\n    of the city of Manila, especially as I would not until\r\n    then be in a position to issue a proclamation and enforce\r\n    my authority in the event that his pretensions should clash\r\n    with my designs. For these reasons the preparations for the\r\n    attack on the city were pressed and the military operations\r\n    conducted without reference to the situation of the insurgent\r\n    forces. The wisdom of this course was subsequently fully\r\n    established by the fact that when the troops at my command\r\n    carried the Spanish entrenchments, extending from the sea to\r\n    the Pasay road on the extreme Spanish right, we were under\r\n    no obligation, by prearranged plans of the mutual attack,\r\n    to turn to the right and clear the front still held by the\r\n    insurgents, but were able to move forward at once and occupy\r\n    the city and the suburbs.'\" [183]\r\n\r\nAll that the Insurgents and the Americans ever had in common was an\r\nenemy. They each fought that enemy in their own way. There was no\r\ncoöperation. On the part of the Insurgents there was treachery. I\r\nwill submit further evidence of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Premeditated Insurgent Attack\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the minutes of the session of the Hong\r\nKong junta at which Aguinaldo reported the result of his negotiations\r\nwith Pratt and received his instructions relative to the trip to\r\nManila, recorded the fact that there would be no better occasion for\r\nthe expeditionary forces \"to arm themselves at the expense of the\r\nAmericans,\" and that provided with arms the Filipino people would\r\nbe able to oppose themselves to the United States and combat their\r\ndemands if they attempted to colonize the country. [184]\r\n\r\nThe possible, if not the probable, desirability of attacking the\r\nUnited States troops was, it is evident, clearly foreseen from the\r\nbeginning. Active preparations for doing this now soon began.\r\n\r\nAlthough Insurgent officers in full uniform freely visited Manila at\r\nall times, Aguinaldo wrote on October 1 to his commander in Laguna\r\nProvince that he must not permit Americans there without passes. He\r\nwas to get rid of them civilly, but he was to keep them out and inform\r\nall authorities there of his instructions.\r\n\r\nOn August 24 an American soldier was killed and others were wounded in\r\nCavite by Insurgent troops who fired from behind. An Insurgent officer\r\nin Cavite at the time reported on his record of services that he--\r\n\r\n    \"took part in the movement against the Americans on the\r\n    afternoon of the 24th of August, under the orders of the\r\n    commander of the troops and the adjutant of the post.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows that the movement was ordered, but the Insurgents promptly\r\nrealized that it was ill advised.\r\n\r\nOn August 28 General Llanera was reported to be preparing for\r\noperations against the Americans. He was ordered to suspend his\r\npreparations. The same day General P. Mercado Rizal, commanding in\r\nLaguna Province, wrote Mabini asking whether they were to consider\r\nthe Americans as their allies or their enemies. He wanted to know\r\nwhether the war was to stop or continue becoming more furious. This\r\nnot because he desired to ask questions about the secrets of the\r\ngovernment, but because he wished to prepare the minds of the people\r\nfor the future. Mabini's answer has not been found.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted that on August 8 Fernando Acevedo wrote General\r\nPío del Pilar recommending that he attack and annihilate the American\r\ntroops; that on August 10 Pilar wrote Aguinaldo suggesting that\r\nthe Americans be attacked, and that on August 17 Aguinaldo stated\"\r\n\"The conflict is coming sooner or later.\" [185]\r\n\r\nAt this time Sandico entered the service of the Americans as an\r\ninterpreter and acted as a spy, endeavouring to keep his people fully\r\ninformed relative to the plans and acts of his employers. Incidentally\r\nhe endeavoured to convince the latter that the barbarities really\r\ncommitted by Insurgent officers and troops in Manila were perpetrated\r\nby enemies of the Insurgent cause who wished to discredit it.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated September 21, 1898, Apacible says that the conflict\r\nwill come sooner or later and asks Aguinaldo if it would not be\r\nbetter for them to provoke it before the Americans concentrate their\r\ntroops. [186]\r\n\r\nOn September 10 General Garcia reported to Aguinaldo that on the\r\nprevious night the Americans had attempted to push back his line\r\nat San Lazaro, and that morning had concentrated and penetrated the\r\nInsurgent territory, making a reconnaissance through the fields about\r\nSampaloc. Aguinaldo put an endorsement on this communication saying\r\nthat he had long since ordered that the Insurgent line should not\r\nbe passed. He instructed Garcia to throw troops in front of the\r\nAmericans at Sampaloc, and order them to leave, and to warn the\r\nbolo men. Obviously, little more was needed to provoke an Insurgent\r\nattack. [187]\r\n\r\nAn unsigned draft of an order in Aguinaldo's handwriting dated Malolos,\r\nSeptember 13 (?), 1898, [188] shows how tense was the situation\r\nwhile the question of withdrawal of the Insurgent forces from the\r\ncity of Manila was under consideration. It contains instructions\r\nfor General Pío del Pilar, General P. Garcia and General Noriel or\r\nColonel Cailles. Their purpose is hardly open to doubt.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pío del Pilar was directed:--\r\n\r\n    \"To have a detachment posted in the interval from the branch\r\n    of the river of Paco in a northerly direction to the bridge\r\n    and so on up to the Pasig river in the direction of Pandacan,\r\n    the river serving as a line until the suburb of Panque is\r\n    reached which will be under our jurisdiction. Proceed to\r\n    execute this order on its receipt, posting detachments where\r\n    they are necessary and trenches will be made without loss\r\n    of time working day and night. Do not rest for by doing so\r\n    we may lose the opportunity; beg of the troops to assist in\r\n    the formation of intrenchments. Matters have a bad aspect,\r\n    we especially expect something Wednesday and Thursday, the\r\n    15th and 16th of this month. The danger is imminent on the\r\n    mentioned days, also in the time that follows.\r\n\r\n    \"Keep strict vigilance at all hours. In case you receive orders\r\n    to leave that place, do not do so on any account without my\r\n    orders, happen what may....\r\n\r\n    \"Concentrate all your forces in Santa Ana before the day\r\n    arrives.\r\n\r\n    \"Warn your soldiers against firing at random as the Spaniards\r\n    did, if possible have them calculate the number of their\r\n    antagonists and how much ammunition there is in comparison\r\n    with the number of the attacking force, in fact, there are\r\n    occasions when each shot fired kills as many as four men.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope you will see to the execution of these instructions\r\n    and that you will maintain the honour of the Philippines by\r\n    your courage and in no way permit your rights to be trampled\r\n    underfoot.\" [189]\r\n\r\nGeneral Garcia was instructed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"On Wednesday, the 14th of this month, you will post\r\n    detachments in the points indicated by lines on the enclosed\r\n    plan. On receipt of this and as soon as you learn its contents,\r\n    proceed secretly to determine the most suitable places to\r\n    post detachments and immediately post our troops and have\r\n    intrenchments made employing day and night in this work. Beg\r\n    this of our soldiers.\" [190]\r\n\r\nThe instructions to Noriel or Cailles read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"At eight o'clock in the morning of Wednesday, the 14th,\r\n    withdraw your command from the town of Malate as indicated\r\n    on the enclosed plan, from the bridge in Singalong and in a\r\n    straight line from there to the branch of the river in Paco\r\n    will be the line of our jurisdiction even though we may not\r\n    be of one mind in the matter. On receipt of this proceed to\r\n    determine the most suitable places to post our troops even\r\n    if they are not supplied with batteries; on posting the\r\n    detachments give instructions to have intrenchments made\r\n    immediately without resting, especially on the days of the\r\n    15th and 16th. Since affairs have a serious aspect, do not\r\n    lose vigilance and be on the alert at all times....\r\n\r\n    \"Concentrate all the forces and have a call to arms in Cavite\r\n    so that all the troops may be in Pasay on Wednesday night.\r\n\r\n    \"In case the Americans attempt to order you out do not leave\r\n    your posts, happen what may, but exercise prudence and be\r\n    prepared leaving them to give the provocation. Answer them\r\n    that you have no instructions given you with regard to what\r\n    they ask.\" [191]\r\n\r\nObviously the maintenance of peace at this time hung by a very slender\r\nthread. On September 14 the governor of Cavite telegraphed Aguinaldo\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. I desire to know from you the result of the\r\n    ultimatum. Advise me if we must prepare our troops for action\r\n    to-morrow. I await a reply.\" [192]\r\n\r\nBut war was not to begin at this time. On September 23 Bray wrote\r\nto Aguinaldo advising him to maintain a defensive attitude until\r\nthe result of the negotiations at Paris should become known, giving\r\nway to the Americans and not showing his teeth. He could take the\r\noffensive later if advisable and should have little difficulty in\r\nsettling accounts with the American soldiers. [193]\r\n\r\nBray suggested the possibility of an alliance between the American and\r\nthe Spanish soldiers if a conflict should arise before the departure\r\nof the latter. [194]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile preparations for the attack progressed. During September,\r\nSandico wrote Aguinaldo suggesting the urgent necessity of reorganizing\r\nthe \"masons\" and the Katipúnan, [195] and that all be furnished with\r\nknives, to be kept hidden so that they might be \"ready for any event.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of efforts to keep the Insurgent soldiers in hand, feeling\r\namong them ran high, and they wanted to fight. [196] On November 30,\r\n1898, General Mascardo telegraphed from San Fernando to Aguinaldo\r\nasking if he might begin firing in order to prevent the American\r\ntroops from disembarking, and Aguinaldo promptly answered in the\r\naffirmative. [197]\r\n\r\nOn December 5 Malvar telegraphed from Lipa that according to a despatch\r\nfrom Batangas, American divers were working unceasingly and that a\r\nsubordinate had ordered that they be fired on if they attempted to\r\nland. Aguinaldo replied that he did not mind their working at sea, but\r\nthat they must not be allowed to land under any circumstances. [198]\r\n\r\nOn December 6 Sandico telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The difficulty of last night at the San Juan picket with\r\n    the American troops has been adjusted without prejudice. Our\r\n    preparations ought to continue. Awaiting orders.\" [199]\r\n\r\nSan Juan was where the firing commenced on February 4, 1899.\r\n\r\nOn December 9 Cailles wired Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Report to you that there are 3000 Americans in front of\r\n    our position at Singalong. I do not know what they wish;\r\n    if they enter Pineda I open fire.\" [200]\r\n\r\nBy this time the Insurgents had made up their minds that the\r\nAmericans, who had been bearing their insults in silence, were\r\ncowards. Aguinaldo's indorsement on this telegram reads:--\r\n\r\n    \"Answered: Nevertheless the 3000 American soldiers are few\r\n    against my Colonel and his 300 soldiers, and I believe you\r\n    have more than that number. E.A., Dec. 12, 1898.\" [201]\r\n\r\nRelative to the insults which were at this time showered upon\r\nAmericans, Taylor has made the following statement: [202]--\r\n\r\n    \"Fortune had been good to Aguinaldo and his associates in the\r\n    eight months during which the United States had prevented Spain\r\n    from relieving her beleaguered garrisons in the Philippines,\r\n    and she might still be kind. The men about Aguinaldo who had\r\n    risen farthest and fastest could not endure the thought of\r\n    having to accept subordinate positions in a government not\r\n    directed by themselves. The halberdiers at the door of the\r\n    palace of the president saluted them as the halberdiers at\r\n    the doorway of his lordship the governor-general in Manila\r\n    had struck the marble steps with their halberds at the\r\n    coming of the Spanish generals. They swaggered down the\r\n    streets of Malolos, clashing their swords behind them,\r\n    and they knew that if they won, the Philippines would\r\n    be divided into fiefs which they, as dukes and marquises,\r\n    would hold in feudal tenure from a Malay potentate. They were\r\n    confident. They held Luzón. They held the people. They had\r\n    no intention of returning to office stools or to the life of\r\n    outlaws and hunted men. The United States force in Manila\r\n    was small and America was far. It was true that they might\r\n    have to fight for the prize which they had seized, but the\r\n    military leaders about Aguinaldo were confident of winning in\r\n    case they fought. They believed the Americans were afraid of\r\n    them and would be easily beaten. American soldiers had been\r\n    seized and had been insulted by the followers of Aguinaldo\r\n    and no resort had been made to force. The Americans had been\r\n    ordered to avoid bringing on an engagement and had obeyed. It\r\n    is also probable that many of the insults to which they had\r\n    been subjected were not appreciated by them. A tall soldier\r\n    from western America paid no attention to the insults hurled\r\n    at him in a language which he did not understand. And yet\r\n    the small excited Filipinos might retire feeling that the\r\n    American had tamely submitted to insult worse than a blow.\"\r\n\r\nBy the middle of December, Aguinaldo had placed in position in the\r\nvicinity of Manila all of the field guns in his possession.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10. It provided for the\r\ntermination of Spanish sovereignty in the Philippines. This was what\r\nthe Insurgents had been waiting for, and thereafter things moved\r\nrapidly. It is obvious that an attack was definitely planned for\r\nat this time, for on December 21, Commandant F. E. Rey telegraphed\r\nAguinaldo that the second chief of the second zone of Manila had\r\ndirected him to assist by entering that city as soon as they opened\r\nfire against the American troops. [203]\r\n\r\nOn the following day Cailles reported that he had occupied blockhouse\r\nNo. 12, which was within the American lines, and added the following\r\nsignificant statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"The order of yesterday was, on hearing the first shots\r\n    from Santa Ana, for my whole force to hurl themselves on\r\n    the American line of trenches, and to follow the living to\r\n    Manila. The dead can lie with the dead. Yesterday we were\r\n    content waiting for the arming of the San Quintin.\" [204]\r\n\r\nSan Quintin's Day was the anniversary of the Sicilian vespers, the\r\nmassacre of the French in Sicily in 1268. Obviously the Insurgents\r\nwere planning something similar for Manila.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the attack was not made as planned, but there was\r\nno intention of abandoning it. Within fifteen days of January 1 some\r\n40,000 Filipinos left Manila. Why? On January 7, Aguinaldo wrote to\r\nSeñor Benito Legarda at Manila, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you to leave Manila with your family and come here to\r\n    Malolos, but not because I wish to frighten you--I merely\r\n    wish to warn you for your satisfaction, although it is not\r\n    yet the day or the week.\" [205]\r\n\r\nMany details of the plan of attack have come into our\r\npossession. Doctor Manuel Xeres Burgos wrote Aguinaldo during January\r\nrelative to a plan for an uprising of the prisoners in Bilibid Prison,\r\nsaying that it should by all means come \"before the movement is begun\r\nanywhere else,\" and calling attention to the necessity of stationing\r\nmen to prevent the American soldiers near by in the Zorilla theatre\r\nfrom coming to the rescue. On the back of this letter there is a\r\nsketch plan showing where bolo men were to be stationed, ready to\r\nattack these soldiers. [206]\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress dated January 1, 1899, Aguinaldo said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I consider arguments unnecessary in support of the proposed\r\n    amendments, every one knows that our newborn Republic now has\r\n    to fight for its existence against giants in ambition and in\r\n    power.\" [207]\r\n\r\nAn unsigned letter addressed to Apacible on January 4, 1899, contains\r\nthe following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"It appears that conflict with the Americans is imminent\r\nand inevitable. Several of their vessels with thousands of\r\nsoldiers commanded by General Miller were sent to Iloilo on\r\nDecember 20th last to take that port together with the whole\r\nof Visayas and Mindanao.\" [208]\r\n\r\nOn January 4 the following significant telegram was sent out:--\r\n\r\n    \"Circular Telegram from the Secretary of the Interior to\r\n    Provincial Presidents, wherever there may be Telegraphic\r\n    Service, to be communicated to the Local Chiefs of each Town.\r\n\r\n    \"_Malolos_, January 4, 1899, 9.35 A.M.\r\n\r\n    \"To the Provincial President of the Province of Pangasinán:\r\n\r\n    \"Hasten the preparation of all the towns in order to oppose the\r\n    American invasion. See that all the inhabitants prepare their\r\n    bolos and daggers; also that in each street and barrio national\r\n    militia is organized, each six of whom should be commanded by\r\n    a corporal, each thirteen by a sergeant, each twenty-six by\r\n    a second lieutenant, each fifty-two by a first lieutenant,\r\n    and each one hundred and four by a captain, directing that\r\n    the soldiers of the national militia elect their own officers,\r\n    informing all that upon our attitude depends our salvation.\r\n\r\n    _Lingayen_, January 4, 1899.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a note thereon which reads:--\r\n\r\n    \"Communicate this to all of the local chiefs, and to the\r\n    commanding general.\"\r\n\r\n    (Signed by initials which are illegible, but evidently those\r\n    of the Provincial President.) [209]\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1899, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation which contains\r\nthe following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"The said generals accepted my concessions in favor of\r\n    peace and friendship as indications of weakness. Thus it is,\r\n    that with rising ambition, they ordered forces to Iloilo on\r\n    December 26, with the purpose of acquiring for themselves\r\n    the title of conquerors of that portion of the Philippine\r\n    Islands occupied by my govermnent.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"My government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a\r\n    violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by\r\n    a nation which has arrogated to itself the title, 'champion\r\n    of oppressed nations.' Thus it is that my government is\r\n    ready to open hostilities if the American troops attempt to\r\n    take forcible possession of the Visayan Islands. I announce\r\n    these rights before the world, in order that the conscience of\r\n    mankind may pronounce its infallible verdict as to who are the\r\n    true oppressors of nations and the tormentors of human kind.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon their heads be all the blood which may be shed.\" [210]\r\n\r\nThree days later this proclamation, which was rather dangerously like\r\na declaration of war, was reissued with a significant change in the\r\nlast one of the passages quoted, the words \"attempt to take forcible\r\npossession of any part of the territory submitted to its jurisdiction\"\r\nbeing substituted for the words \"attempt to take forcible possession\r\nof the Visayan Islands.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1899, at 9.40 P.M., Sandico telegraphed Aguinaldo\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Note_.--In consequence of the orders of General Rios to his\r\n    officers, as soon as the Filipino attack begins the Americans\r\n    should be driven into the Intramuros district and the Walled\r\n    city should be set on fire.\" [211]\r\n\r\nPreparations for the attack, which was to begin inside the city\r\nof Manila, were now rapidly pushed to conclusion. I quote Taylor's\r\nexcellent summary of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"After Aguinaldo's proclamation of January 5 the number of\r\n    organizations charged with an attack within the city increased\r\n    rapidly and it is possible that those which had been formed\r\n    during Spanish rule had never been disbanded. Sandico's\r\n    clubs for athletic exercises and mutual improvement formed\r\n    a nucleus for these bodies and the directing boards of\r\n    the popular committees took up the work of recruiting,\r\n    while some of the members became officers of the militia or\r\n    sandatahan. On January 6 the commander of militia in Trozo,\r\n    Manila, reported that 1130 soldiers had been enrolled by the\r\n    popular committee. On January 7 Bonifacio Arévalo forwarded\r\n    to the head of the central committee a list of the officers\r\n    of the battalion which had just been organized in Sampaloc\r\n    for the defence of their liberties. Apparently about the\r\n    same time J. Limjap submitted to Sandico a project for\r\n    arming the prisoners in Bilibid Prison with the arms of the\r\n    American soldiers quartered in the Zorrilla Theatre across\r\n    the street. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Jacinto Limjap having been proclaimed commander of the\r\n    volunteers of the penitentiary, I ask you to authorize the\r\n    creation of a disciplinary battalion and the provisional\r\n    appointments of officers for 600 sandatahan, or militia,\r\n    ready to provide themselves by force with the American rifles\r\n    in the Zorrilla Theatre.'\r\n\r\n    \"He followed by a statement of the officers desired. It was\r\n    not difficult for him to obtain volunteers there to rob,\r\n    to burn, to rape and to murder. These were the crimes for\r\n    which they were serving sentences. The political prisoners\r\n    had been released....\r\n\r\n    \"On January 18 Sandico approved of the officers for the first\r\n    battalion organized by the committees of Sampaloc; on January\r\n    27 he approved those of the second battalion. By January 22 two\r\n    battalions had been organized in Quiapo. At least one regiment\r\n    of eight companies was raised in Binondo, for on January 23\r\n    its commander forwarded a roll of the officers to Aguinaldo\r\n    for his approval.... On January 25 T. Sandico, at Malolos,\r\n    submitted for approval the names of a number of officers of the\r\n    territorial militia in the city of Manila. On January 30, 1899,\r\n    a roll of four companies just organized in Malate was forwarded\r\n    approved by T. Sandico, and on the same day the committee\r\n    of Trozo, Manila, applied to T. Sandico for permission to\r\n    recruit a body for the defence of the country. The regiment\r\n    of 'Armas Blancas' had already been raised in Tondo and\r\n    Binondo. It was in existence there in December, 1898, and\r\n    may have been originally organized to act against Spain. On\r\n    February 2 all officers of the territorial militia in Manila\r\n    reported at Caloocan, in accordance with orders of Sandico,\r\n    for the purpose of receiving their commissions and taking the\r\n    oath to the flag. A man who took part in this ceremony wrote\r\n    that a multitude of men were present in uniform, and that\r\n    the oath was administered by Gen. Pantaleón García. There is\r\n    no reason for believing that this is a complete statement of\r\n    sandatahan organized in Manila by the end of January, and yet\r\n    this statement gives a force of at least 6330 men. General\r\n    Otis said that this force had been reported to him as being\r\n    10,000 men. It is probably true that only a small number of\r\n    them had rifles; but armed with long knives and daggers they\r\n    could have inflicted much damage in a sudden night attack in\r\n    the narrow and badly lighted streets of Manila. On January 9,\r\n    1899, Aguinaldo wrote his instructions for the sandatahan\r\n    of Manila. Members of this body were to enter the houses\r\n    of the American officers on the pretext of bringing them\r\n    presents. Once in they were to kill. The sentinels at the\r\n    gates of the barracks were to be approached by men dressed as\r\n    women and killed. The gates of the barracks held and as many\r\n    officers as possible treacherously murdered, the sandatahan\r\n    were to rise throughout the city, and by attacking in the\r\n    rear the United States troops on the outer line were to aid\r\n    in opening a way for Aguinaldo's force. To further increase\r\n    the confusion and perhaps to punish the natives who had not\r\n    joined them, the sandatahan were to fire the city.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"It is a fair deduction from Luna's orders for an uprising\r\n    in Manila, from Aguinaldo's instructions for the sandatahan,\r\n    from other documents among the papers of the insurgents and\r\n    from what was done in Manila on February 22 that Aguinaldo\r\n    and his advisers about the middle of January, 1899, drew up a\r\n    plan of attack upon Manila which would, if carried out, have\r\n    inflicted a severe blow upon the Americans. It was not carried\r\n    out, but that was not the fault of Aguinaldo or of Luna.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true that the instructions were general; but that\r\n    particular instructions were given by Aguinaldo himself for\r\n    the murder of General Otis is shown by his note on the back\r\n    of a document presented to him. [212]\r\n\r\n    \"... And then there was nothing abhorrent to Aguinaldo and\r\n    the men about him in beginning a war by the murder of the\r\n    commanding general on the other side.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"... Aguinaldo and all his followers have declared that on\r\n    February 4 the Americans attacked the unsuspecting Filipinos\r\n    who were using their utmost efforts to avoid a war. And yet\r\n    here in Aguinaldo's own handwriting is the record of the\r\n    fact that on January 10, 1899, he ordered the murder of the\r\n    American commander.\r\n\r\n    \"The attack which Aguinaldo was preparing to deliver upon\r\n    and in Manila was not to be a mere raid such as the bandits\r\n    of Cavite were in the habit of making upon the defenceless\r\n    towns. The plan was a piece of calculated savagery in which\r\n    murder and outrage were considered means to accomplish a\r\n    purpose. The servants were to kill their employers; organized\r\n    bands, dressed in the dress of civilians, living in the city\r\n    of Manila under the government of the Americans, in many cases\r\n    employed by the Americans, were to suddenly fall upon the\r\n    barracks of the American soldiers and massacre the inmates;\r\n    all Americans in the streets were to be killed, the city was\r\n    to be fired and its loot was to be the reward of loyalty to\r\n    Aguinaldo. If this plan had been carried out no white man and\r\n    no white woman would have escaped. The reinforcements from\r\n    the United States would have arrived to find only the smoking\r\n    ruins of Manila. Buencamino had warned General Augustín what\r\n    the fate of Manila would be if taken by a horde of Indians\r\n    drunk with victory. That fate was now deliberately planned\r\n    for the city. Aguinaldo planned to occupy the capital not as\r\n    it had been occupied by the Americans. He planned to take it\r\n    as Count Tilly took Magdeburg.\r\n\r\n    \"The authors of this plan were not savages. Mabini,\r\n    Sandico, and Luna, Asiatics educated in European schools,\r\n    were men of trained and subtle minds. With them cruelty\r\n    and assassination was not a matter of savage impulse but of\r\n    deliberate calculation; with them assassination was employed\r\n    as an effective addition to political propaganda, and murder\r\n    as an ultimate resource in political manoeuvres.\" [213]\r\n\r\nSome portions of Aguinaldo's instructions to the _sandatahan_ are\r\nparticularly worthy of perpetuation, as they illustrate his ideas\r\nas to the conduct which should be observed by cultured, patriotic,\r\nhonourable and very humane men, who were not cruel:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 3. The chief of those who go to attack the barracks\r\n    should send in first four men with a good present for the\r\n    American commander. Immediately after will follow four others\r\n    who will make a pretence of looking for the same officer\r\n    for some reason and a larger group shall be concealed in the\r\n    corners or houses in order to aid the other groups at the first\r\n    signal. This wherever it is possible at the moment of attack.\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 4. They should not, prior to the attack, look at\r\n    the Americans in a threatening manner. To the contrary,\r\n    the attack on the barracks by the sandatahan should be a\r\n    complete surprise and with decision and courage. One should\r\n    go alone in advance in order to kill the sentinel. In order\r\n    to deceive the sentinel one of them should dress as a woman\r\n    and must take great care that the sentinel is not able to\r\n    discharge his piece, thus calling the attention of those\r\n    in the barracks. This will enable his companions who are\r\n    approaching to assist in the general attack.\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 5. At the moment of the attack the sandatahan should\r\n    not attempt to secure rifles from their dead enemies, but\r\n    shall pursue, slashing right and left with bolos until the\r\n    Americans surrender, and after there remains no enemy who\r\n    can injure them, they may take the rifles in one hand and\r\n    the ammunition in the other.\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 6. The officers shall take care that on the\r\n    tops of the houses along the streets where the American\r\n    forces shall pass there will be placed four to six men,\r\n    who shall be prepared with stones, timbers, red-hot iron,\r\n    heavy furniture, as well as boiling water, oil and molasses,\r\n    rags soaked in coal oil ready to be lighted and thrown down,\r\n    and any other hard and heavy objects that they can throw on\r\n    the passing American troops. At the same time in the lower\r\n    parts of the houses will be concealed the sandatahan, who will\r\n    attack immediately. Great care should be taken not to throw\r\n    glass in the streets, as the greater part of our soldiers\r\n    go barefooted. On these houses there will, if possible,\r\n    be arranged, in addition to the objects to be thrown down,\r\n    a number of the sandatahan, in order to cover a retreat or\r\n    to follow up a rout of the enemy's column, so that we may be\r\n    sure of the destruction of all the opposing forces.\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 7. All Filipinos, real defenders of their country,\r\n    should live on the alert to assist simultaneously the inside\r\n    attack at the very moment that they note the first movement\r\n    in whatever barrio or suburb, having assurance that all\r\n    the troops that surround Manila will proceed without delay\r\n    to force the enemy's line and unite themselves with their\r\n    brothers in the city. With such a general movement, so firm\r\n    and decided against the Americans, the combat is sure to be a\r\n    short one, and I charge and order that the persons and goods\r\n    of all foreigners shall be respected and that the American\r\n    prisoners shall be treated well.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 9. In addition to the instructions given in paragraph\r\n    6, there shall be in the houses vessels filled with boiling\r\n    water, tallow, molasses and other liquids, which shall be\r\n    thrown as bombs on the Americans who pass in front of their\r\n    houses, or they can make use of syringes or tubes of bamboo. In\r\n    these houses shall be the sandatahan who shall hurl the\r\n    liquids that shall be passed to them by the women and children.\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 10. In place of bolos or daggers, if they do not\r\n    possess the same, the sandatahan can provide themselves with\r\n    lances and arrows with long sharp heads, and these should be\r\n    shot with great force in order that they may penetrate well\r\n    into the bodies of the enemy, and these should be so made that\r\n    in withdrawal from the body the head will remain in the flesh.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Art_. 12.... Neither will you forget your sacred oath and\r\n    immaculate banner; nor will you forget the promises made\r\n    by me to the civilized nations, whom I have assured that\r\n    we Filipinos are not savages, nor thieves, nor assassins,\r\n    nor are we cruel, but on the contrary, that we are men of\r\n    culture and patriotism, honourable and very humane.\" [214]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo enjoined order on his subordinates. [215]\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos were now ready to assume the offensive, but desired, if\r\npossible, to provoke the Americans into firing the first shot. They\r\nmade no secret of their desire for conflict, but increased their\r\nhostile demonstrations and pushed their lines forward into forbidden\r\nterritory. Their attitude is well illustrated by the following extract\r\nfrom a telegram sent by Colonel Cailles to Aguinaldo on January 10,\r\n1899:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. An American interpreter has come to tell me to\r\n    withdraw our forces in Maytubig fifty paces. I shall not draw\r\n    back a step, and in place of withdrawing, I shall advance a\r\n    little farther. He brings a letter from his general, in which\r\n    he speaks to me as a friend. I said that from the day I knew\r\n    that Maquinley (McKinley) opposed our independence I did not\r\n    want any dealings with any American. War, war, is what we\r\n    want. The Americans after this speech went off pale.\" [216]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo approved the hostile attitude of Cailles, for there is a\r\nreply in his handwriting which reads:--\r\n\r\n    \"I approve and applaud what you have done with the Americans,\r\n    and zeal and valour always, also my beloved officers and\r\n    soldiers there. I believe that they are playing us until the\r\n    arrival of their reinforcements, but I shall send an ultimatum\r\n    and remain always on the alert.--E. A. Jan. 10, 1899.\" [217]\r\n\r\nOn this same day Aguinaldo commissioned Feliciano Cruz and Severino\r\nQuitiongco to assassinate General Otis. [218]\r\n\r\nOn January 13 Noriel and Cailles telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"We desire to know results of ultimatum which you mention\r\n    in your telegram, and we also wish to know what reward our\r\n    Government is arranging for the forces that will be able\r\n    first to enter Manila.\"\r\n\r\nThis telegram is endorsed in Aguinaldo's handwriting:\r\n\r\n    \"As to the contents of your telegram, those who will be the\r\n    heroes will have as their rewards a large quantity of money,\r\n    extraordinary rewards, promotions, crosses of Biak-na-bató,\r\n    Marquis of Malate, Ermita, Count of Manila, etc., besides the\r\n    congratulations of our idolizing country on account of their\r\n    being patriotic, and more, if they capture the regiments with\r\n    their generals, and, if possible, the chief of them all who\r\n    represents our future enemies in Manila, which (lot?) falls\r\n    to you, or, better said, to General Noriel and Colonel Cailles.\r\n\r\n    \"The ultimatum has not been sent, but it will be within a\r\n    few days.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"E. A.\r\n\r\n    \"_Malolos_, Jan. 14, 1899.\" [219]\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1899, the people at Aparri shouted: \"Death to the\r\nAmericans,\" and held a review to celebrate the rupture of friendly\r\nrelations with the United States. [220]\r\n\r\nAt this time Aguinaldo had a dream about a victorious attack upon\r\nManila and telegraphed it to some of his officers. General García\r\nreplied from Caloocan on January 17 that the dream would come true\r\nas soon as the conflict with the Americans began. [221]\r\n\r\nIn January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo was still not quite ready, and ordered\r\nthat the Filipino soldiers in the walled city keep on good terms with\r\nthe Americans, in order to deceive them, \"since the hoped-for moment\r\nhas not yet arrived.\" [222]\r\n\r\nThe Insurgents grew surer and surer that the Americans were cowards,\r\n[223] and openly boasted that when the attack began they would drive\r\nthem into the sea.\r\n\r\nOn January 21 General Otis wrote to Admiral Dewey that:--\r\n\r\n    \"The insurgents will not now permit us to cross their lines and\r\n    have been very insulting to our officers, calling to them that\r\n    very shortly they will give us battle. My best information\r\n    is that they have fully determined to attack both outside\r\n    and within the city before our additional troops arrive,\r\n    and the least spark may start a conflagration.\" [224]\r\n\r\nAs the date of the proposed attack drew near, the work of strengthening\r\nthe Insurgent positions around Manila was pushed with all possible\r\nspeed. [225]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January General Otis stationed the First Nebraska\r\nRegiment upon the high ground at Santa Mesa for sanitary reasons. Of\r\nconditions at this time, and of the circumstances leading to the\r\nactual outbreak of hostilities Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"During the latter part of January General Otis was informed\r\n    on good insurgent authority that the insurgents meditated an\r\n    attack upon those troops, and he was advised to remove them,\r\n    as in their exposed position they would kill them all. General\r\n    MacArthur, under whose command the regiment was, placed\r\n    two guns in position there, as it was fully expected that\r\n    the insurgents would direct their attack upon that point,\r\n    as in fact they did. On February 4, 1899, the tents of the\r\n    regiment covered the ridge, and its outposts extended along\r\n    the San Juan River, a small stream which formed part of the\r\n    line of delimitation between the Americans and the insurgents.\r\n\r\n    \"For some days before the outbreak of hostilities the pressure\r\n    of the insurgents was constant along this position, so constant\r\n    indeed that in the light of subsequent events it indicated a\r\n    premeditated purpose on the part of some one in the insurgent\r\n    army to force a collision at that point. On February 2 General\r\n    MacArthur, commanding the Second Division of the Eighth Army\r\n    Corps, wrote to the commanding general of the Filipino troops\r\n    in the third zone in front of him that--\r\n\r\n    \"'An armed party from your command now occupies the village in\r\n    front of blockhouse No. 7, at a point considerably more than\r\n    a hundred yards on my side of the line, and is very active in\r\n    exhibiting hostile intentions. This party must be withdrawn\r\n    to your side of the line at once. From this date if the line\r\n    is crossed by your men with arms in their hands they must be\r\n    regarded as subject to such action as I may deem necessary.'\r\n\r\n    \"Colonel San Miguel, who commanded at San Juan del Monte,\r\n    replied upon the receipt of this communication that the action\r\n    of his troops was foreign to his wishes and that he would\r\n    give immediate orders for them to retire. At about half past\r\n    8 on the night of February 4 a small insurgent patrol entered\r\n    the territory within the American lines at blockhouse No. 7\r\n    and advanced to the little village of Santol in front of an\r\n    outpost of the Nebraska regiment. This was the same point from\r\n    which the insurgents had been compelled to retire on February\r\n    2. An American outpost challenged, and then as the insurgent\r\n    patrol continued to advance the sentinel fired, whereupon the\r\n    insurgent patrol retired to blockhouse No. 7, from which fire\r\n    was immediately opened upon the Americans. This fire spread\r\n    rapidly down the American and insurgent lines and both forces\r\n    at once sprang to arms.\" [226]\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's account of the opening of active hostilities follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the night of February 2 they sent in a strong detachment\r\n    to draw the fire of our outposts, which took up a position\r\n    immediately in front and within a few yards of the same. The\r\n    outpost was strengthened by a few of our men, who silently bore\r\n    their taunts and abuse the entire night. This was reported to\r\n    me by General MacArthur, whom I directed to communicate with\r\n    the officer in command of the insurgent troops concerned. His\r\n    prepared letter was shown me and approved, and the reply\r\n    received was all that could be desired. However, the agreement\r\n    was ignored by the insurgents and on the evening of February 4\r\n    another demonstration was made on one of our small outposts,\r\n    which occupied a retired position at least 150 yards within\r\n    the line which had been mutually agreed upon, an insurgent\r\n    approaching the picket and refusing to halt or answer when\r\n    challenged. The result was that our picket discharged his\r\n    piece, when the insurgent troops near Santa Mesa opened a\r\n    spirited fire on our troops there stationed.\r\n\r\n    \"The insurgents had thus succeeded in drawing the fire of\r\n    a small outpost, which they had evidently labored with all\r\n    their ingenuity to accomplish, in order to justify in some\r\n    way their premeditated attack. It is not believed that the\r\n    chief insurgent leaders wished to open hostilities at this\r\n    time, as they were not completely prepared to assume the\r\n    initiative. They desired two or three days more to perfect\r\n    their arrangements, but the zeal of their army brought on\r\n    the crisis which anticipated their premeditated action. They\r\n    could not have delayed long, however, for it was their object\r\n    to force an issue before American troops, then en route,\r\n    could arrive in Manila.\" [227]\r\n\r\nThus began the Insurgent attack, so long and so carefully planned\r\nfor. We learn from the Insurgent records that the shot of the American\r\nsentry missed its mark. There was no reason why it should have provoked\r\na hot return fire, but it did.\r\n\r\nThe result of the ensuing combat was not at all what the Insurgents\r\nhad anticipated. The Americans did not drive very well. It was but a\r\nshort time before they themselves were routed and driven from their\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo of course promptly advanced the claim that his troops had\r\nbeen wantonly attacked. The plain fact is that the Insurgent patrol in\r\nquestion deliberately drew the fire of the American sentry, and this\r\nwas just as much an act of war as was the firing of the shot. Whether\r\nthe patrol was acting under proper orders from higher authority is\r\nnot definitely known.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following telegram sent by Captain Zialcita\r\nfrom Santa Ana on February 4, 1899, at 9.55 P.M., to Major Gray,\r\nSan Juan del Monte, is highly interesting:\r\n\r\n    \"I received the telegram forwarded from Malolos. General\r\n    Ricarte is not here. I believe (that if the) Americans\r\n    open fire we shall attack. Will ask instructions (of)\r\n    Malolos.\" [228]\r\n\r\nThis looks as if Zialcita at least knew that something was to be done\r\nto draw the American fire.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's first statement relative to the opening of hostilities\r\nis embodied in a general order dated Malolos, February 4, 1899,\r\nand reads in part as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nine o'clock P.M., this date, I received from Caloocan\r\n    station a message communicated to me that the American forces,\r\n    without prior notification or any just motive, attacked our\r\n    camp at San Juan del Monte and our forces garrisoning the\r\n    blockhouses around the outskirts of Manila, causing losses\r\n    among our soldiers, who in view of this unexpected aggression\r\n    and of the decided attack of the aggressors, were obliged to\r\n    defend themselves until the firing became general all along\r\n    the line.\r\n\r\n    \"No one can deplore more than I this rupture of hostilities. I\r\n    have a clear conscience that I have endeavoured to avoid it\r\n    at all costs, using all my efforts to preserve friendship\r\n    with the army of occupation, even at the cost of not a few\r\n    humiliations and many sacrificed rights.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"... I order and command:--\r\n\r\n    \"1. Peace and friendly relations between the Philippine\r\n    forces and the American forces of occupation are broken,\r\n    and the latter will be treated as enemies, with the limits\r\n    prescribed by the laws of war.\r\n\r\n    \"2. American soldiers who may be captured by the Philippine\r\n    forces will be treated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n    \"3. This proclamation shall be communicated to the accredited\r\n    consuls of Manila, and to congress, in order that it may\r\n    accord the suspension of the constitutional guarantees and\r\n    the resulting declaration of war.\" [229]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's protestations relative to his efforts to avoid hostilities\r\nare absurd, in view of his own instructions concerning the attack to\r\nbe made simultaneously within and without the city of Manila.\r\n\r\nThere is other correspondence which throws light on the situation which\r\nexisted immediately prior to the outbreak of hostilities. On January\r\n25, 1899, Agoncillo cabled from Washington to Apacible in Hongkong:\r\n\"Recommend you await beginning American aggression, justifying our\r\nconduct nations.\" [230]\r\n\r\nApacible apparently did not take this view of the matter, for on\r\nJanuary 31 he wrote to Aguinaldo that the Senate in Washington would\r\ntake final vote upon the treaty of peace between the United States\r\nand Spain on February 6, and said:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is urgently necessary for America to answer us immediately\r\n    before the ratification of the treaty. A conflict after the\r\n    ratification of the treaty would be unfavorable to us in\r\n    public opinion.\" [231]\r\n\r\nObviously this letter might be interpreted as a recommendation\r\nthat hostilities begin before February 6 if America did not answer\r\nmeanwhile. It was evidently well understood in Hongkong that\r\nAguinaldo's receipt of Apacible's letter might cause war to begin,\r\nfor on February 3, 1899, Bray, anticipating the outbreak of hostilities\r\nof the following day, cabled Senator Hoar at Washington as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Receive caution news hostilities Manila discredited here\r\n    denied Filipino circles supposed political move influence vote\r\n    Senate to-day any ease insignificant skirmish due intentional\r\n    provocation.\r\n\r\n    \"_Bray_.\" [232]\r\n\r\nThe extracts from the Insurgent records above quoted leave no escape\r\nfrom the conclusion that the outbreak of hostilities which occurred on\r\nFebruary 4, 1899, had been carefully prepared for and was deliberately\r\nprecipitated by the Filipinos themselves.\r\n\r\nBlount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"It would be simply wooden-headed to affirm that they ever\r\n    expected to succeed in a war with us.\" [233]\r\n\r\nIt may have been wooden-headed for the Filipinos to expect this, but\r\nexpect it they certainly did. We have seen how they held their soldiers\r\nin check until after Spain had been ousted from the Philippines by\r\nthe Treaty of Paris as they had originally planned to do. It now only\r\nremained to carry out the balance of their original plan to get rid\r\nof the Americans in one way or another.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis states that \"when Aguinaldo had completed his preparations\r\nfor attack he prepared the outlines of his declaration of war, the\r\nfull text of which was published at Malolos on the evening, and very\r\nshortly after, hostilities began. This declaration was circulated in\r\nManila on the morning of February 5.\" [234]\r\n\r\nThe Insurgents brought down upon themselves the punishment which they\r\nreceived on February 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nBlount has stated [235] that if the resolutions of Senator Bacon\r\nintroduced on January 11, 1899, had passed, we never should have had\r\nany war with the Filipinos. The resolutions in question concluded\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    \"That the United States hereby disclaim any disposition or\r\n    intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control\r\n    over said islands except for the pacification thereof, and\r\n    assert their determination when an independent government\r\n    shall have been duly erected therein entitled to recognition\r\n    as such, to transfer to said government, upon terms which\r\n    shall be reasonable and just, all rights secured under the\r\n    cession by Spain, and to thereupon leave the government and\r\n    control of the islands to their people.\"\r\n\r\nI must take issue with Blount as to the effect which these resolutions\r\nmight have had if passed. The Insurgents felt themselves to be fully\r\ncompetent to bring about such pacification of the islands as they\r\ndeemed necessary. At the time the resolutions were presented in the\r\nSenate their soldiers were straining at the leash, ready to attack\r\ntheir American opponents upon the most slender excuse. Aguinaldo\r\nhimself could not have held them much longer, and it is not impossible\r\nthat they got away from him as it was. They would have interpreted the\r\npassage of the Bacon resolutions as a further evidence of weakness,\r\nand hastened their attack. As we have seen, \"war, war, war\" was what\r\nthey wanted.\r\n\r\nBlount has endeavoured to shift the responsibility for the outbreak\r\nof hostilities to the United States by claiming that certain words\r\nitalicized by him in what he calls the \"Benevolent Assimilation\r\nProclamation\" were necessarily, to the Insurgents, \"fighting\r\nwords.\" The expressions referred to have to do with the establishment\r\nof United States sovereignty and the exercise of governmental control\r\nin the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThese words were not \"fighting words,\" the Insurgent policy being,\r\nas I have shown by the records, to consider the acceptance of a\r\nprotectorate or of annexation in the event that it did not prove\r\npossible to negotiate absolute independence, or probable that the\r\nAmerican troops could be driven from the islands.\r\n\r\nThe growing confidence of the Insurgents in their ability to whip\r\nthe cowardly Americans, rather than any fixed determination on their\r\npart to push a struggle for independence to the bitter end, led to\r\ntheir attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nInsurgent Rule and the Wilcox-Sargent Report\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Good Book says, \"By their fruits ye shall know them, whether\r\nthey be good or evil,\" and it seems proper to apply this test to the\r\nInsurgents and their government.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary claim has been advanced that the United States\r\ndestroyed a republic in the Philippines and erected an oligarchy on\r\nits ruins. Various writers and speakers who have not gone so far as\r\nthis have yet maintained that Aguinaldo and his associates established\r\na real, effective government throughout the archipelago during the\r\ninterim between his return and the outbreak of hostilities with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing conditions on September 15, 1898, Judge Blount says:\r\n[236]--\r\n\r\n    \"Absolute master of all Luzon outside Manila at this time,\r\n    with complete machinery of government in each province\r\n    for all matters of justice, taxes, and police, an army of\r\n    some 30,000 men at his beck, and his whole people a unit\r\n    at his back, Aguinaldo formally inaugurated his permanent\r\n    government--permanent as opposed to the previous provisional\r\n    government--with a Constitution, Congress, and Cabinet,\r\n    patterned after our own, [237] just as the South American\r\n    republics had done before him when they were freed from Spain,\r\n    at Malolos, the new capital.\"\r\n\r\nHe refers to our utter failure to understand \"what a wonderfully\r\ncomplete 'going concern' Aguinaldo's government had become\r\nthroughout the Philippine Archipelago before the Treaty of Paris was\r\nsigned.\" [238]\r\n\r\nHe bases his claim as to the excellent state of public order in the\r\nInsurgent territory at this time on a report of Paymaster W. E. Wilcox\r\nand Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent of the United States Navy, who between\r\nOctober 8 and November 20, 1898, made a long, rapid trip through\r\nnorthern Luzon, traversing the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga,\r\nTarlac, Pangasinán, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Cagayan,\r\nSouth Ilocos and Union, in the order named, thence proceeding to\r\nDagupan and down the railroad through Pangasinán, Tarlac, Pampanga\r\nand Bulacan to Manila.\r\n\r\nHe says that these gentlemen found the authority of Aguinaldo's\r\ngovernment universally acknowledged, the country in a state of perfect\r\ntranquillity and public order, [239] with profound peace and freedom\r\nfrom brigandage and the like. [240]\r\n\r\nNow if it be true that Aguinaldo established complete machinery of\r\ngovernment throughout all of Luzon outside of Manila for all matters\r\nof justice, taxes and police, so that life and property were safe\r\nand peace, tranquillity and justice assured, we may well dispense\r\nwith quibbling as to whether the proper name was applied to such\r\ngovernment. But did he?\r\n\r\nLet us examine with some care the history of the Wilcox-Sargent trip,\r\nand see if we can gain further light from other sources relative to\r\nthe condition of public order in the territory which they traversed.\r\n\r\nI propose, for the most part, to let the captured Insurgent records\r\nspeak for themselves, as it is fair to assume that Insurgent officers\r\nwere at no pains to represent conditions as worse than they really\r\nwere. In view of the fragmentary character of these records, we may\r\nalso assume that the complete story would be still more interesting\r\nand instructive than the one which I have been able to reconstruct.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Sargent and Wilcox were almost everywhere hospitably received,\r\nand were entertained with dinners and dances after the inimitable\r\nfashion of the hospitable Filipino everywhere. They gained a very\r\nfavourable impression of the state of public order in the provinces\r\nthrough which they passed for the reason that from the very start\r\ntheir trip was strictly personally conducted. They saw exactly what\r\nit was intended that they should see and very little more. Their\r\nprogress was several times interrupted for longer or shorter periods\r\nwithout adequate explanation. We now know that on these occasions the\r\nscenery so carefully prepared in advance for them had become a little\r\ndisarranged and needed to be straightened up. Facts which I will cite\r\nshow that most shocking and horrible events, of which they learned\r\nnothing, were occurring in the territory through which they passed.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time before their departure American visitors\r\nhad been carefully excluded from the Insurgent territory, but the\r\nFilipino leaders decided to let these two men go through it to the\r\nend that they might make as favourable a report as possible. How\r\ncarefully the way was prepared for American visitors is shown by the\r\nfollowing telegram:--\r\n\r\n    \"_San Pedro, Macati_,\r\n\r\n    \"July 30, 1898.\r\n\r\n    \"To the Local Presidente of Pasig:\r\n\r\n    \"You are hereby informed that the Americans are going to\r\n    your town and they will ask your opinion [of what the people\r\n    desire.--Tr.] You should answer them that we want a republican\r\n    government. The same answer must be given throughout your\r\n    jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"Pío Del Pilar,\r\n\r\n    \"General of the Second Zone.\" [241]\r\n\r\nNow General Pilar had an uncomfortable way of killing people who did\r\nnot obey his orders, and under the rules of the Insurgent government\r\nhe was abundantly justified in so doing. His suggestions as to what\r\nvisiting Americans should be told or shown would be likely to be\r\nacceded to. Certainly this seems to have been the case in the present\r\ninstance, for on the same day General Noriel reported as follows: [242]\r\n\r\n    \"President R. G., Bacoor, from Gen. Noriel, Pineda, July 30,\r\n    12.10 P.M.: I inform your excellency that some commissioners of\r\n    the American admiral are making investigations in the region\r\n    around Pasay as to the wishes and opinion of the people as to\r\n    the government. To-day I received a statement from some, giving\r\n    the answer: 'Free government under American protectorate [copy\r\n    mutilated, two or three words missing here] the President.'\"\r\n\r\nBlount quotes with approval Admiral Dewey's statement made shortly\r\nafter the return of Wilcox and Sargent that in his opinion their report\r\n\"contains the most complete and reliable information obtainable\r\nin regard to the present state of the northern part of Luzon\r\nIsland.\" [243] This was true.\r\n\r\nThe admiral might have gone further and said that it contained\r\npractically the only information then obtainable in regard to\r\nconditions in the territory in question, but as I shall conclusively\r\nshow it was neither complete nor reliable.\r\n\r\nJudge Blount in describing the experiences of Messrs. Wilcox and\r\nSargent naïvely makes the statement that:\r\n\r\n    \"The tourists were provided at Rosales by order of Aguinaldo\r\n    with a military escort, 'which was continued by relays all\r\n    the way to Aparri.'\" [244]\r\n\r\nIt certainly was!\r\n\r\nVery little Spanish was then spoken in Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela or\r\nCagayan. What opportunity had these two men, ignorant as they were\r\nof the native dialects, to learn the sinister facts as to what had\r\nbeen and was occurring in the territory which they visited?\r\n\r\nNo one can fail to be delighted with Filipino hospitality, which\r\nwas lavishly bestowed upon them everywhere, and it is only natural\r\nthat they should have reported favourably upon what they saw. It\r\nwas about this time that an order was issued [245] that fronts of\r\nbuildings should be whitewashed, streets cleaned and fences repaired\r\nwith a view to showing every one, and especially travellers through\r\nthe territory of the Insurgents, that they were \"not opposed to a\r\ngood such as a refined and civilized people should have.\" Doubtless\r\nthe report of the two men from Dewey's fleet was made in the best\r\nof faith. I will now endeavour to show what were some of the actual\r\nconditions in the territory through which they passed.\r\n\r\n_Bulacan_\r\n\r\nThey first visited Bulacan. They do not mention hearing of the\r\nactivities of a Chinaman named Ignacio Paua, who had been given\r\nthe rank of colonel by Aguinaldo and assigned the task of extorting\r\ncontributions for the revolution from his countrymen. In a letter to\r\nAguinaldo written on July 6, 1898, Paua states that he has collected\r\nmore than $1,000 from the Chinese of these small towns, but asks\r\nfor an order \"prohibiting the outrages that are being committed\r\nagainst such merchants as are not our enemies.\" He further says,\r\n\"When the contributions from the Chinamen of all the pueblos shall\r\nhave been completed I wish to publish a proclamation forbidding any\r\ninjury to the Chinamen and any interference with their small business\r\nenterprises,\" and adds that \"the natives hereabouts themselves are\r\nthe people who are committing said abuses.\" [246]\r\n\r\nApparently Paua had no objection to the committing of outrages against\r\nmerchants that were the enemies of the cause, nor does he seem to have\r\nobjected to injury to Chinamen before contributions were completed. His\r\nown methods were none too mild. On August 27, 1898, General Pío del\r\nPilar telegraphed Aguinaldo that five Insurgent soldiers, under a\r\nleader supposed to be Paua, had entered the store of a Chinaman,\r\nand tried to kidnap his wife, but had left on the payment of $10 and\r\na promise to pay $50 later, saying that they would return and hang\r\ntheir fellow countryman if the latter amount was not forthcoming. [247]\r\n\r\nPaua was later made a general in consideration of his valuable\r\nservices!\r\n\r\n_Pampanga_\r\n\r\nOur travellers next visited Pampanga. Here they apparently overlooked\r\nthe fact that Aguinaldo did not have \"his whole people a unit at\r\nhis back.\" The citizens of Macabebe seem not to have approved of the\r\nAguinaldo regime, for the Insurgent records show that:--\r\n\r\n    \"Representatives of the towns of Pampanga assembled in San\r\n    Fernando on June 26, 1898, and under the presidency of General\r\n    Maximino Hizon agreed to yield him complete 'obedience as\r\n    military governor of the province and representative of\r\n    the illustrious dictator of these Philippine Islands.' The\r\n    town of Macabebe refused to send any delegates to this\r\n    gathering.\" [248]\r\n\r\nIt may be incidentally mentioned that Blount has passed somewhat\r\nlightly over the fact that he himself during his army days commanded\r\nan aggregation of sturdy citizens from this town, known as Macabebe\r\nscouts, who diligently shot the Insurgents full of holes whenever they\r\ngot a chance. He incorrectly refers to them as a \"tribe or clan.\" [249]\r\nIt is absurd to call them a tribe. They are merely the inhabitants\r\nof a town which has long been at odds with the neighbouring towns of\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\nThings had come to a bad pass in Pampanga when its head wrote that\r\nthe punishment of beating people in the plaza and tying them up so\r\nthat they would be exposed to the full rays of the sun should be\r\nstopped. He argued that such methods would not lead the people of\r\nother nations to believe that the reign of liberty, equality and\r\nfraternity had begun in the Philippines. [250]\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that persons tied up and exposed to the full rays\r\nof the sun in the Philippine lowlands soon die, in a most uncomfortable\r\nmanner, we shall agree with the head of this province that this custom\r\nhas its objectionable features!\r\n\r\n_Tarlac_\r\n\r\nWhile the failure of Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent to learn of the\r\nrelations between the Tagalogs of Macabebe and their neighbours,\r\nor of the fact that people were being publicly tortured in Pampanga,\r\nis perhaps not to be wondered at under the circumstances, it is hard\r\nto see how they could have failed to hear something of the seriously\r\ndisturbed conditions in Tarlac if they so much as got off the train\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn August 24 the commissioner in charge of elections in that province\r\nasked for troops to protect him, in holding them in the town of\r\nUrdaneta, against a party of two thousand men of the place, who were\r\ngoing to prevent them.\r\n\r\nOn September 22 the secretary of the interior ordered that the\r\nrequirements of the decree of June 18, establishing municipal\r\ngovernments, should be strictly complied with, as in many of the towns\r\n\"the inhabitants continue to follow the ancient methods by which the\r\nfriars exploited us at their pleasure and which showed their great\r\ncontempt for the law.\" [251]\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Aguinaldo, from Juan Nepomuceno, Representative\r\nfrom Tarlac, speaks for itself as to conditions in that province\r\non December 27, 1898, shortly after the American travellers passed\r\nthrough it on their return:--\r\n\r\n    \"I regret exceedingly being compelled to report to you that\r\n    since Sunday the 25th instant scandalous acts have been\r\n    going on in the Province of Tarlac, which I represent. On the\r\n    night of the Sunday mentioned the entire family of the Local\r\n    Chief of Bamban was murdered, and his house and warehouse\r\n    were burned. Also the Tax Commissioner and the Secretary,\r\n    Fabian Ignacio, have been murdered. Last night Señor Jacinto\r\n    Vega was kidnapped at the town of Gerona; and seven travellers\r\n    were murdered at O'Donnel, which town was pillaged, as well as\r\n    the barrio of Matayumtayum of the town of La Paz. On that day\r\n    various suspicious parties were seen in the town of Pañique\r\n    and in the same barrio, according to reliable reports which\r\n    I have just received.\r\n\r\n    \"All this general demoralization of the province, according\r\n    to the information which I have obtained, is due to the fact\r\n    that the province is dissatisfied with the Provincial Chief,\r\n    Señor Alfonso Ramos, and with Major Manuel de León; for this\r\n    is substantiated by the fact that all the events described\r\n    occurred since last Sunday, when Señor Alfonso Ramos returned,\r\n    to take charge of the Office of Provincial President, after\r\n    having been detained for several days in this town. Wherefore,\r\n    I believe that in order to restore tranquillity in the\r\n    province, consideration be given to various documents that\r\n    have been presented to the Government and to the standing\r\n    Committee of Justice; and that there be removed from office\r\n    Señor Alfonso Ramos, as well as said Señor Manuel de León,\r\n    who has no prestige whatever in this province. Moreover on\r\n    the day when fifty-four soldiers of the command deserted,\r\n    he himself left for San Fernando, Pampanga.\" [252]\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 1898, General Macabulos sent Aguinaldo a telegram [253]\r\nfrom which it evidently appears that there was an armed uprising in\r\nTarlac which he was endeavouring to quell and that he hoped for early\r\nsuccess. Apparently, however, his efforts to secure tranquillity were\r\nnot entirely successful, for on December 18 he telegraphed Aguinaldo\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In a telegram dated to-day Lieut. Paraso, commanding\r\n    a detachment at Camilin, informs me that last night his\r\n    detachment was attacked by Tulisanes (robbers). The fire\r\n    lasted four hours without any casualties among our men. This\r\n    afternoon received another from the captain commanding said\r\n    detachment, informing me of the same, and that nothing new\r\n    has occurred. The people of the town await with anxiety the\r\n    result of the charges they have made, especially against the\r\n    local president and the justice of the peace, the original\r\n    of which I sent to your high authority.\" [254]\r\n\r\nObviously the police machinery was not working quite smoothly when\r\na detachment of Insurgent troops could be kept under fire for four\r\nhours by a robber band, and perhaps the attacking party were not all\r\n\"robbers.\" Soldiers do not ordinarily carry much to steal.\r\n\r\nWe obtain some further information from the following telegram of\r\nDecember 27, 1898, sent by the secretary of the interior to the\r\nPresident of the Revolutionary Government:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. According to reports no excitement except in\r\n    Bangbang, Tarlac, which at 12 A.M., 25th, was attacked by\r\n    Tulisanes [bandits or robbers,--D.C.W.]. The local presidente\r\n    with his patrols arrested six of them. On continuing the\r\n    pursuit he met in Talacon a party too large to attack. At 7\r\n    A.M. of the 26th the town was again attacked by criminals,\r\n    who killed the tax collector, and others who burnt some\r\n    houses, among them that of the local presidente, and his\r\n    stables, in which he lost two horses. I report this for your\r\n    information.\" [255]\r\n\r\nEvidently tax collectors were not popular in Tarlac.\r\n\r\nStill further light is shed on the situation by a telegram from the\r\nsecretary of the interior to Aguinaldo, dated December 28, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"According to my information the excitement in Tarlac\r\n    increases. I do not think that the people of the province\r\n    would have committed such barbarities by themselves. For\r\n    this reason the silence of General Macabulos is suspicious;\r\n    to speak frankly, it encourages the rebels. Some seven hundred\r\n    of them, with one hundred and fifty rifles, entered Pañique,\r\n    seized the arms of the police, the town funds, and attacked the\r\n    houses of the people. I report this for your information. All\r\n    necessary measures will be taken.\" [256]\r\n\r\nNote also the following from the secretary of the interior, under\r\ndate of December 27, 1898, to Aguinaldo:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have just learned that not only in Bangbang, but also\r\n    in Gerona, Onell, and other places in Tarlac, men have been\r\n    assaulted by numerous Tulisanes, armed with rifles and bolos,\r\n    who are killing and capturing the inhabitants and attacking\r\n    travellers, robbing them of everything they have. The President\r\n    should declare at once that that province is in state of\r\n    siege, applying martial law to the criminals. That--(remainder\r\n    missing).\" [257]\r\n\r\nThe secretary of agriculture took a more cheerful view of the\r\nsituation. Under date of December 28 he telegraphed Aguinaldo as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The events in Bangbang, Tarlac Province, according to a\r\n    witness here worthy of credit, have arisen from an attempt\r\n    to procure vengeance on the local presidente, and robbery of\r\n    Chinese shops. Hence they are without political importance. The\r\n    tax collector killed, and a countryman servant of the local\r\n    presidente wounded. They burnt two houses of the local\r\n    presidente, a stable, and a warehouse for sugar-cane.\" [258]\r\n\r\nObviously the robbery of Chinese shops and the killing of a few\r\nindividuals was at first considered by the secretary of agriculture\r\nto be without political importance. Evidently he changed his mind,\r\nhowever, for on the same day, December 28, 1898, he telegraphed\r\nAguinaldo as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I think it necessary to send Aglipay [259] to quiet\r\n    Tarlac. Send for him. If you desire, I will go to Tarlac to\r\n    investigate the causes of the disorders, in order to find a\r\n    remedy for them.\" [260]\r\n\r\nAt this stage of events Aguinaldo was summoned to Malolos by a telegram\r\nfrom Mabini under date of December 29, which reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. You must come here immediately. Trías is sick. We\r\n    can come to no decision in regard to the Tarlac matter. Cannot\r\n    constitute a government without you.\" [261]\r\n\r\nThe measures which were actually taken are set forth in another\r\ntelegram of the same date from the secretaries of war and interior\r\nto Aguinaldo, which reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have sent civil and military commissioners to Tarlac;\r\n    among them the Director of War and persons of much moral\r\n    influence, in order to stifle the disturbances. The necessary\r\n    instructions have been given them and full powers for the\r\n    purpose, and as far as possible to satisfy the people. Have\r\n    also sent there six companies of soldiers with explicit\r\n    instructions to their commander to guard only the towns, and\r\n    make the people return to a peaceful life, using a policy of\r\n    attraction for the purpose.\" [262]\r\n\r\nLet us hope that the commander was able to attract the people with\r\nhis six companies of soldiers, and make them return to a peaceful life.\r\n\r\nStill further light is thrown on the situation in Tarlac by the\r\nfollowing extract from \"Episodios de la Revolucion Filipina\" by Padre\r\nJoaquin D. Duran, an Augustinian priest, Manila, 1901, page 71:--\r\n\r\n    \"At that period the Filipinos, loving order, having been\r\n    deceived of the emancipation promise, changed by the Katipúnan\r\n    into crimes and attacks on the municipality of the pueblos,\r\n    discontent broke out in all parts, and, although latent in some\r\n    provinces, in that of Tarlac was materialized in an ex-sergeant\r\n    of the late Spanish civil guard. A valorous and determined\r\n    man, he lifted up his flag against that of Aguinaldo. One\r\n    hundred rifles were sufficient to terrorize the inhabitants\r\n    of said province, crushing the enthusiastic members of the\r\n    revolutionary party.... Having taken possession of four towns,\r\n    Pecheche would have been everywhere successful if ambition\r\n    and pride had not directed his footsteps. In January, 1899,\r\n    the Aguinaldista commander of Tarlac province, afraid that\r\n    his whole province would espouse the cause of the sergeant,\r\n    attempted by every means in his power to interrupt his\r\n    career, not hesitating to avail himself of crime to destroy\r\n    the influence of Pecheche with the many people who had been\r\n    incensed by the Katipúnan and had in turn become firm partisans\r\n    of the Guards of Honour.\r\n\r\n    \"The Ilocano Tranquilino Pagarigan, local presidente at\r\n    that time of Camiling, served as an admirable instrument for\r\n    this purpose.... Pecheche was invited to a solemn festivity\r\n    organized by Tranquilino, who pretended to recognize him as\r\n    his chief, and rendering himself a vassal by taking an oath\r\n    to his flag. He accepted the invitation, and after the mass\r\n    which was celebrated went to a meal at the convent, where,\r\n    after the meal was over, the members of the K.K.K. surrounded\r\n    Pecheche and 10 of his officers and killed them with bolos\r\n    or tied them and threw them out of the windows and down the\r\n    staircase. Some priests were held captive in the building\r\n    where this took place and were informed of what had taken\r\n    place immediately afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract shows how easy it then was for any man of determination\r\nto acquire a following, especially if he could dispose of a few\r\nrifles. It also gives an excellent idea of the methods employed by\r\nthe Insurgents in dealing with those who opposed their rule.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fred D. Grant once told me, with much amusement, of an\r\ninteresting experience during a fight on Mt. Arayat in Pampanga. His\r\nmen took a trench and captured some of its occupants. Several of these\r\nwere impressed as guides and required to show the attacking forces\r\nthe locations of other trenches. At first they served unwillingly,\r\nbut presently became enthusiastic and rushed the works of their\r\nquondam fellow-soldiers in the van of the American attack. Finally\r\nthey begged for guns. Grant added that he could start from Bacolor\r\nfor San Fernando any morning with a supply of rifles and pick up\r\nvolunteers enough to capture the place, and that on the return trip\r\nhe could get enough more to attack Bacolor!\r\n\r\n_Pangasinán_\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to Pangasinán, the most populous province of Luzon,\r\nand the third in the Philippines in number of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    \"In July, 1898, the officer in Dagupan wrote to the commanding\r\n    general of Tarlac Province that he would like to know whom\r\n    he was required to obey, as there were so many officials of\r\n    all ranks who gave him orders that it was impossible for him\r\n    to know where he stood.\" [263]\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated August 17, 1898, to Aguinaldo, Benito Legarda\r\ncomplained that a bad impression had been produced by the news from\r\nDagupan that when the Insurgents entered there, after many outrages\r\ncommitted upon the inmates of a girls' school, every officer had\r\ncarried off those who suited him. [264]\r\n\r\nWhat should we say if United States troops entered the town of\r\nWellesley and raped numerous students at the college, the officers\r\nsubsequently taking away with them the young ladies who happened\r\nto suit them? Yet things of this sort hardly caused a ripple in the\r\ncountry then under the Insurgent flag, and I learned of this particular\r\nincident by accident, although I have known Legarda for years.\r\n\r\nI quote the following general description of conditions in Pangasinán\r\nfrom a letter addressed by Cecilio Apóstol to General Aguinaldo on\r\nJuly 6, 1898:--\r\n\r\n    \"You probably know that in the Province of Pangasinán, of\r\n    one of the towns in which your humble servant is a resident,\r\n    the Spanish flag through our good fortune has not flown here\r\n    for the past few months, since the few Spaniards who lived\r\n    here have concentrated in Dagupan, a place not difficult of\r\n    attack, as is said.\r\n\r\n    \"But this is what is going on in this Province\" There exist\r\n    here two Departmental Governments, one calling itself that\r\n    of Northern Luzón and of which Don Vicente del Prado is\r\n    the President, and the other which calls itself that of\r\n    Northern and Central Luzón, presided over by Don Juliano\r\n    Paraiso. Besides these two gentlemen, there are two governors\r\n    in the province(!) one Civil Political Military, living in\r\n    Lingayen, named Don Felipe J. Bartolomé, and another living in\r\n    Real Guerrero, a town of Tayug, named Don Vicente Estrella. And\r\n    in addition there are a large number of Administrators,\r\n    Inspectors, Military Judges, Generals, ... they cannot be\r\n    counted. It is a pandemonium of which even Christ, who\r\n    permits it, cannot make anything. Indeed, the situation is\r\n    insupportable. It reminds me of the schism in the middle\r\n    ages when there were two Popes, both legitimate, neither\r\n    true. Things are as clear as thick chocolate, as the\r\n    Spaniards say. In my poor opinion, good administration is\r\n    the mother-in-law of disorder, since disorder is chaos and\r\n    chaos produces nothing but confusion, that is to say, death.\r\n\r\n    \"I have had an opportunity, through the kindness of a friend,\r\n    to read the decree of that Government, dated June 18th, of\r\n    the present year, and the accompanying 'Instructions for\r\n    the government of towns and provinces.' Article 9 of the\r\n    said decree says that the Superior Government will name\r\n    a commissioner for each province with the special duty\r\n    of establishing there the organization set forth in the\r\n    decree. Very well so far: which of the so-called Presidents of\r\n    Northern or of Northern and Central Luzón is the commissioner\r\n    appointed by that government to establish the new organization\r\n    in that province? Are military commanders named by you for\r\n    Pangasinán? I would be very much surprised if either of them\r\n    could show his credentials. Aside from these, the fact remains\r\n    that in those instructions no mention is made of Presidents\r\n    of Departments, there is a manifest contradiction in their\r\n    jurisdictions, since while one calls himself president of a\r\n    Departmental Government, of Northern Luzón, the other governs\r\n    the Northern and Central portion of the Island, according to\r\n    the seals which they use.\r\n\r\n    \"And, nevertheless, a person calling himself the General\r\n    Administrator of the Treasury and the said Governor of the\r\n    Province, both of whom live in Tayug, came to this town when\r\n    the Spaniards voluntarily abandoned it and gathered all the\r\n    people of means, and drew up an act of election, a copy of\r\n    which is attached. From it you will see how this organization\r\n    violates the provisions of the decree of the 18th of June.\r\n\r\n    \"Another item: They got up a contract with the people of means\r\n    of this town, and did the same thing in the other towns,\r\n    in which contract they exact from us $1250 which they call\r\n    contributions of war (see document No. 2 attached). Among\r\n    the doubtful powers of these gentlemen is the one to exact\r\n    these sums included?\r\n\r\n    \"Have they express orders from that Government?\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps these blessed gentlemen--they are high flyers there is\r\n    no doubt about that,--have struck the clever idea of calling\r\n    themselves generals, governors, etc., in order to enjoy a\r\n    certain prestige and to give a certain color of legality to\r\n    their acts--this, although they don't know an iota of what\r\n    they are doing. But what I am sure of, and many other men\r\n    also, is that there is no order, that here there is not a\r\n    single person in authority whom to obey. This superfluity of\r\n    rulers will finally lead to strained relations between them\r\n    and the towns of this province will end by paying the piper.\r\n\r\n    \"But we poor ignorant creatures in so far as the republican\r\n    form of government is concerned, in order to avoid worse\r\n    evils took them at their word, obeyed them like automatons,\r\n    hypnotized by the title of 'Insurgents' which they applied to\r\n    themselves. But when I had an opportunity to read the said\r\n    decree, doubts were forced upon me, I began to suspect--may\r\n    God and they pardon me--that they were trying to impose upon\r\n    us nicely, that, shielded by the motto, 'have faith in and\r\n    submit to the will of the country' they came to these towns\r\n    'for business.'\r\n\r\n    \"In order to dissipate this doubt, in order to do away with\r\n    abuses, if there are abuses, I made up my mind to send you this\r\n    account of the condition of things here. I flatter myself that\r\n    when you learn of the lamentable situation of this province,\r\n    you will soon deign to take steps to establish order, because\r\n    thereon depends the tranquillity of Pangasinan and in the\r\n    end a strict compliance with your superior orders.\r\n\r\n    \"There will be no limit to the thanks of the people of this\r\n    province if their petitions secure favourable consideration and\r\n    an immediate response from the high patriotism and honourable\r\n    standpoint of the Supreme Dictator of the Philippines.\" [265]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the picture thus drawn by Señor Apóstol differs\r\nin certain important particulars from that painted in such engaging\r\ncolours by Judge Blount.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, the civil governor of Pangasinán had to have an\r\nescort of troops in passing through his province. [266]\r\n\r\nOn November 20, 1898, the head of the town of San Manuel wrote the\r\nprovincial governor that his people could no longer support the troops\r\nquartered on them, as the adherents of the Katipúnan had burned or\r\nstolen all of their property. [267]\r\n\r\nThe sum total of Blount's description of affairs in this, the\r\nmost populous province of Luzón, is derived from the narrative of\r\nMessrs. Wilcox and Sargent and reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In Pangasinán 'the people were all very respectful and polite\r\n    and offered the hospitality of their homes.'\" [268]\r\n\r\nDoubtless true, but as a summary of conditions perhaps a trifle\r\nsketchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nueva Ecija_\r\n\r\nNueva Ecija was the next province visited by Wilcox and Sargent. They\r\nhave failed to inform us that:--\r\n\r\n    \"In December, 1899, certain men charged with being members\r\n    of this society [Guards of Honour] were interrogated in Nueva\r\n    Ecija as to their purposes. One of those questioned said:--\r\n\r\n    \"'That their purpose was one day, the date being unknown to\r\n    the deponent, when the Ilocanos of Batac came, to rise up\r\n    in arms and kill the Tagálos, both private individuals and\r\n    public employees, excepting those who agreed to the former,\r\n    for the reason that honours were granted only to the Tagálos,\r\n    and but few to the Ilocanos.'\" [269]\r\n\r\nBlount has assured us that the Filipinos were a unit at Aguinaldo's\r\nback and were and are an united people, and here are the Ilocanos of\r\nNueva Ecija spoiling his theory by remembering that they are Ilocanos\r\nand proposing to kill whom? Not certain individual Filipinos, who\r\nmight have offended them, but the Tagálogs!\r\n\r\nThat there were other troubles in Nueva Ecija is shown by the following\r\nstatement:--\r\n\r\n    \"On January 7, 1899, the commissioner of Aguinaldo's treasury\r\n    sent to collect contributions of war in Nueva Ecija Province\r\n    reported that the company stationed in San Isidro had become\r\n    guerillas under command of its officers and opposed his\r\n    collections, stating that they were acting in compliance with\r\n    orders from higher authority.\" [270]\r\n\r\nAnd now, in following the route taken by our tourist friends, we\r\nreach Nueva Vizcaya and the Cagayan valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nInsurgent Rule in the Cagayan Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nNueva Vizcaya is drained by the Magát River, a branch of the\r\nCagayan. While the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan constitute the\r\nCagayan valley proper, Blount includes Nueva Vizcaya in the territory\r\ncovered by this designation, and for the purpose of this discussion\r\nI will follow his example.\r\n\r\nEspecial interest attaches to the history of Insurgent rule, in the\r\nCagayan valley, as above defined, for the reason that Blount himself\r\nserved there as a judge of the court of first instance. He says:\r\n[271]--\r\n\r\n    \"The writer is perhaps as familiar with the history of that\r\n    Cagayan valley as almost any other American.\"\r\n\r\nHe was. For his action in concealing the horrible conditions which\r\narose there under Insurgent rule, with which he was perfectly familiar,\r\nand in foisting on the public the account of Messrs. Wilcox and\r\nSargent, as portraying the conditions which actually existed there,\r\nI propose to arraign him before the bar of public opinion. In so\r\ndoing I shall consider these conditions at some length. We have much\r\ndocumentary evidence concerning them in addition to that furnished\r\nby the Insurgent records, although the latter quite sufficiently\r\ndemonstrate many of the more essential facts.\r\n\r\nIn describing the adventures of Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent in this\r\nregion, Judge Blount says: [272]--\r\n\r\n    \"There [273] they were met by Simeon Villa, military commander\r\n    of Isabela province, the man who was chief of staff to\r\n    Aguinaldo afterwards, and was captured by General Funston\r\n    along with Aguinaldo in the spring of 1901.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts as to Villa's career in the Cagayan valley are especially\r\nworthy of note as they seem to have entitled him, in the opinion of\r\nhis superiors, to the promotion which was afterward accorded him. He\r\nwas an intimate friend of Aguinaldo and later accompanied him on his\r\nlong flight through northern Luzon.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1898, Colonel Daniel Tirona, a native of Cavite Province\r\nand one of the intimates of Aguinaldo, was ordered to proceed to Aparri\r\nin the Insurgent steamer _Filipinas_ and establish the revolutionary\r\ngovernment in northern Luzon. In doing this he was to hold elections\r\nfor office-holders under Aguinaldo's government and was authorized\r\nto approve or disapprove the results, his action being subject to\r\nsubsequent revision by Aguinaldo. His forces were composed of four\r\ncompanies armed with rifles.\r\n\r\nTirona reached Aparri on August 25 and promptly secured the surrender\r\nof the Spaniards there.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by Simeon Villa, the man under discussion, and by\r\nColonel Leyba, who was also very close to Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nAbuse of the Spanish prisoners began at once. It is claimed that the\r\ngovernor of North Ilocos, who was among those captured, was grossly\r\nmistreated.\r\n\r\nTaylor briefly summarizes subsequent events as follows: [274]--\r\n\r\n    \"Whatever the treatment of the Spanish governor of Ilocos\r\n    may really have been, there is testimony to show that some\r\n    of the other prisoners, especially the priests, were abused\r\n    and outraged under the direction of S. Villa and Colonel\r\n    Leyba, both of whom were very close to Aguinaldo. Some of\r\n    the Spanish civil officials were put in stocks and beaten,\r\n    and one of the officers who had surrendered at Aparri was\r\n    tortured to death. This was done with the purpose of extorting\r\n    money from them, for it was believed that they had hidden\r\n    funds in place of turning them over. All the Spaniards were\r\n    immediately stripped of everything they had. The priests were\r\n    subjected to a systematic series of insults and abuse under\r\n    the direction of Villa in order to destroy their influence\r\n    over the people by degrading them in their eyes. It was for\r\n    this that they were beaten and exposed naked in the sun; and\r\n    other torture, such as pouring tile wax of burning candles\r\n    into their eyes, was used to make them disclose where they\r\n    had hidden church vessels and church funds. The testimony of\r\n    a friar who suffered these outrages is that the great mass\r\n    of the people saw such treatment of their parish priests\r\n    with horror, and were present at it only through fear of the\r\n    organized force of the Katipúnan.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's statement is mildness itself in view of the well-established\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe question of killing the Spanish prisoners, including the friars,\r\nhad previously been seriously considered, [275] but it was deemed wiser\r\nto keep most of the friars alive, extort money from them by torture,\r\nand offer to liberate them in return for a large cash indemnity, or for\r\npolitical concessions. Day after day and week after week Villa presided\r\nat, or himself conducted, the torture of ill-fated priests and other\r\nSpaniards who fell into his hands. Even Filipinos whom he suspected\r\nof knowing the where-abouts of hidden friar money did not escape.\r\n\r\nThe following information relative to the conduct of the Insurgents in\r\nthe Cagayan valley is chiefly taken from manuscript copy of _\"Historia\r\nde la Conquista de Cagayan por los Tagalos Revolucionarios,\"_ in\r\nwhich the narratives of certain captured friars are transcribed and\r\ncompiled by Father Julian Malumbres of the Dominican Order.\r\n\r\nThe formal surrender of Aparri occurred on August 26. Tirona, his\r\nofficers and his soldiers, promptly pillaged the _convento_. [276]\r\nThe officers left the Bishop of Vigan ten pesos, but the soldiers\r\nsubsequently took them away from him. Wardrobes and trunks were\r\nbroken open; clocks, shoes, money, everything was carried off. Even\r\npersonal papers and prayer-books were taken from some of the priests,\r\nmany of whom were left with absolutely nothing save the few remaining\r\nclothes in which they stood.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Villa, accompanied by Victa and Rafael Perea, [277]\r\nwent to the _convento_ and told the priests who were imprisoned\r\nthere that their last hour had come. He shut all of them except the\r\nbishop and five priests in a room near the church, then separated\r\nthe Augustinians, Juan Zallo, Gabino Olaso, Fidel Franco, Mariano\r\nRodriguez, and Clemente Hidalgo, from the others and took them into\r\nthe lower part of the _convento_ where he told them that he intended\r\nto kill them if they did not give him more money. The priests told\r\nhim that they had given all they had, whereupon he had their arms\r\ntied behind their backs, kicked them, struck them and whipped them\r\nwith rattans.\r\n\r\nFather Zallo was thrown on his face and savagely beaten. Meanwhile\r\ntwo shots were fired over the heads of the others and a soldier called\r\nout \"One has fallen,\" badly frightening the priests who had remained\r\nshut in the room. Villa then returned with soldiers to this room,\r\nordered his men to load, and directed that one priest step forward\r\nto be shot. Father Mariano Ortiz complied with this request, asking\r\nthat he be the first victim. Villa, however, contented himself with\r\nthreatening him with a revolver and kicking and striking him until\r\nhe fell to the floor. He was then beaten with the butts of guns.\r\n\r\nFather José Vazquez, an old man of sixty years, who had thrown some\r\nmoney into a privy to keep it from falling into the hands of the\r\nInsurgents, was stripped and compelled to recover it with his bare\r\nhands, after which he was kicked, and beaten with rattans.\r\n\r\nFather Aquilino García was unmercifully kicked and beaten to make\r\nhim give up money, and this sort of thing continued until Villa,\r\ntired out with the physical exertion involved in assaulting these\r\ndefenceless men, departed, leaving his uncompleted task to others,\r\nwho continued it for some time.\r\n\r\nThe net result to the Insurgents of the sacking of the _convento_\r\nand of the tortures thus inflicted was approximately $20,000 gold in\r\naddition to the silver, bank notes, letters of credit, jewels, etc.,\r\nwhich they obtained.\r\n\r\nOn September 5 Villa had Fathers Juan Recio and Buenaventura Macia\r\ngiven fifty blows each, although Father Juan was ill.\r\n\r\nVilla then went to Lalloc, where other priests were imprisoned. On\r\nSeptember 6 he demanded money of them, causing them to be kicked and\r\nbeaten. Father Angel was beaten in an especially cruel manner for\r\nthe apparent purpose of killing him, after which he was thrust into\r\na privy. Father Isidro Fernandez was also fearfully abused. Stripped\r\nof his habit, and stretched face down on the floor, he was horribly\r\nbeaten, and was then kicked, and struck with the butt of a revolver\r\non the forehead.\r\n\r\nA little later the priests were offered their liberty for a million\r\ndollars, which they were of course unable to furnish. Meanwhile the\r\ntorture continued from time to time.\r\n\r\nOn August 30 Tuguegarao was taken by the Insurgents without\r\nresistance. Colonel Leyba promptly proceeded to the _convento_\r\nand demanded the money of the friars as spoil of war. He found only\r\neight hundred pesos in the safe. Father Corujedo was threatened with\r\ndeath if he did not give more. Other priests were threatened but not\r\ntortured at this time. The prisoners in the jail were liberated,\r\nbut many of them had promptly to be put back again because of the\r\ndisorder which resulted, and that same evening Leyba was obliged to\r\npublish a notice threatening robbers with death.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on September 3 Father Corujedo was taken from the\r\n_convento_ by Captain Diego and was again asked for money. Replying\r\nthat he had no more to give, he was beaten with the hilt of a sabre\r\nand stripped of his habit, preparatory to being executed. A mock\r\nsentence of death was pronounced on him and he was placed facing to\r\nthe west to be shot in the back. Diego ordered his soldiers to load,\r\nadding, \"When I count three all fire,\" but the fatal count was not\r\ncompleted. Three priests from Alcala were given similar treatment.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the priests imprisoned at Tuguegarao were sufficiently\r\ngreat, but they were augmented a thousand fold when Villa arrived on\r\nSeptember 11. He came to the building where they were imprisoned,\r\nbearing a revolver, a sabre and a great quantity of rattans. He\r\nordered the priests into the corner of the room in which they were\r\nconfined, and beat those who did not move quickly enough to suit\r\nhim. He threatened them with a very rigorous examination, at the same\r\ntime assuring them that at Aparri he had hung up the bishop until\r\nblood flowed from his mouth and his ears, and that he would do the\r\nsame with them if they did not tell him where they had their money\r\nhidden. There followed the usual rain of kicks and blows, a number\r\nof the priests being obliged to take off their habits in order that\r\nthey might be punished more effectively.\r\n\r\nFathers Calixto Prieto and Daniel Gonzales, professors in educational\r\ninstitutions, he ordered beaten because they were friars.\r\n\r\nFathers Corujedo and Caddedila were beaten, kicked and insulted. Both\r\nwere gray-haired old men and the latter was at the time very weak,\r\nand suffering from a severe attack of asthma. Father Pedro Vincente\r\nwas also brutally beaten.\r\n\r\nThe following is the description given by an eye-witness of conditions\r\nat Tuguegarao:--\r\n\r\n    \"Even the Indios of Cagayan complained and were the victims of\r\n    looting and robbery on the part of the soldiery. So lacking in\r\n    discipline and so demoralized was that army that according to\r\n    the confession of a prominent Filipino it was of imperative\r\n    necessity to disarm them. [278] On the other hand we saw\r\n    with real astonishment that instead of warlike soldiers\r\n    accustomed to battle they were nearly all raw recruits and\r\n    apprentices. From an army lacking in discipline, and lawless,\r\n    only outrages, looting and all sorts of savagery and injustice\r\n    were to be expected. Witnesses to their demoralization are,\r\n    aside from the natives themselves who were the first to\r\n    acknowledge it, the Chinese merchants whose losses were\r\n    incalculable; not a single store or commercial establishment\r\n    remained that was not looted repeatedly. As to the Spaniards\r\n    it goes without saying because it is publicly known, that\r\n    between soldiers and officers they despoiled them to their\r\n    heart's content, without any right except that of brute force,\r\n    of everything that struck their fancy, and it was of no avail\r\n    to complain to the officers and ask for justice, as they turned\r\n    a deaf ear to such complaints. At Tuguegarao they looted in a\r\n    manner never seen before, like Vandals, and it was not without\r\n    reason that a prominent Filipino said, in speaking to a priest:\r\n    'Vandalism has taken possession of the place.' These acts of\r\n    robbery were generally accompanied by the most savage insults;\r\n    it was anarchy, as we heard an eye-witness affirm, who also\r\n    stated that no law was recognized except that of danger,\r\n    and the vanquished were granted nothing but the inevitable\r\n    duty of bowing with resignation to the iniquitous demands of\r\n    that soulless rabble, skilled in crime.\"\r\n\r\nVilla now set forth for Isabela. Meanwhile the jailer of the priests\r\nproceeded to steal their clothes, including shirts, shoes and even\r\nhandkerchiefs. Isabela was taken without resistance on September\r\n12. Dimas Guzman [279] swore to the priests on his life that he would\r\nwork without rest to the end that all friars and all Spaniards might\r\nbe respected, but he perjured himself.\r\n\r\nOn September 12 Villa and others entered the town of Cabagan Viejo,\r\nwhere Villa promptly assaulted Father Segundo Rodriguez, threatening\r\nhim with a revolver, beating him unmercifully, insulting him in every\r\npossible way and robbing him of his last cent. After the bloody scene\r\nwas over he sacked the _convento_, even taking away the priests'\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nVilla also cruelly beat a Filipino, Quintin Agansi, who was taking\r\ncare of money for masses which the priests wished to save from the\r\nInsurgents.\r\n\r\nAfter Father Segundo had suffered torture and abuse for two hours he\r\nwas obliged to start at once on a journey to Auitan. The suffering\r\npriest, after being compelled to march through the street shouting\r\n\"Vivas!\" for the Republic and Aguinaldo, spent the night without a\r\nmouthful of food or a drink of water.\r\n\r\nFather Deogracias García, a priest of Cabagan Nuevo, was subjected to\r\ntorture because he had sent to Hongkong during May a letter of credit\r\nfor $5000 which belonged to the Church. Villa and Leyba entered his\r\n_convento_ and after beating him ordered his hands and feet to be\r\ntied together, then passed a pole between them and had him lifted\r\nfrom the ground, after which two great jars of water were poured down\r\nhis nose and throat without interruption. [280] In order to make the\r\nwater flow through his nose better, they thrust a piece of wood into\r\nthe nasal passages until it came out in his throat. From time to time\r\nthe torture was suspended while they asked him whether he would tell\r\nthe truth as to where he had concealed his money. This unfortunate\r\npriest was so sure he was going to die that while the torture was\r\nin progress he received absolution from a fellow priest. After the\r\ntorture with water there followed a long and cruel beating, and the\r\nunhappy victim was finally thrust into a filthy privy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Father Calzada was assaulted by a group of soldiers and\r\nbadly beaten, after which he was let down into the filth of a privy,\r\nfirst by the feet and afterwards by the head.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th a lieutenant with soldiers entered the _convento_ of\r\nTumauini and as usual demanded money of the occupants, who gave him\r\n$80, all they had at the time. This quantity not being satisfactory,\r\na rope was sent for and the hands of the two priests were tied while\r\nthey were whipped, kicked and beaten. They were, however, released\r\nwhen Father Bonet promised to get additional money. They had a short\r\nrespite until the arrival of Villa, who still demanded more money of\r\nFather Blanco, and failing to get it for the reason that the father\r\nhad no more, leaped upon him and gave him a dreadful beating, his\r\ncompanions joining in with whips, rattans and the butts of guns. They\r\nat last left their victim stretched on the ground almost dead. This\r\npriest showed the marks of his ill treatment six months afterward. Not\r\nsatisfied with this, Villa gave him the so-called \"water cure.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his followers had also beaten Father Bonet. Villa started to\r\ndo likewise but was too tired, having exhausted his energies on Father\r\nBlanco. While the tortures were going on, the _convento_ was completely\r\nsacked. Father Blanco's library was thrown out of the window.\r\n\r\nVilla entered Ilagan on the 15th of September at 8 o'clock at\r\nnight. Hastening to the _convento_, with a company of well-armed\r\nsoldiers, he had his men surround the three priests who awaited him\r\nthere, then summoned the local priest to a separate room and demanded\r\nmoney. The priest gave him all he had. Not satisfied, Villa leaped\r\nupon him, kicking him, beating him and pounding him with the butt of\r\na gun. Many of his associates joined in the disgraceful attack. The\r\nunfortunate victim was then stripped of his habit, obliged to lie down\r\nand received more than a hundred lashes. When he was nearly senseless\r\nhe was subjected to torture by water, being repeatedly lifted up when\r\nfilled with water, and allowed to fall on the floor. While some were\r\npouring water down his nose and throat, others spilled hot wax on his\r\nface and head. The torment repeatedly rendered the priest senseless,\r\nbut he was allowed to recover from time to time so that he might\r\nsuffer when it was renewed.\r\n\r\nThe torturing of this unhappy man lasted for three hours, and\r\nthe horrible scene was immediately succeeded by another quite as\r\nbad. Villa called Father Domingo Campo and, after taking from him\r\nthe little money that he had, ordered him stripped. He was then given\r\nnumberless kicks and blows from the butts of rifles and 150 lashes,\r\nafter which he was unable to rise. There followed the torture with\r\nwater, on the pretext that he had money hidden away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the houses of Spaniards and the shops of the Chinese were\r\ncompletely sacked, and the men who objected were knocked down or cut\r\ndown with bolos. Numerous girls and women were raped.\r\n\r\nOn September 15 Leyba received notice of the surrender of Nueva\r\nVizcaya. I quote the following from the narrative above referred to:--\r\n\r\n    \"Delfin's soldiers [281] were the most depraved ever seen:\r\n    their thieving instincts had no bounds; so they had hardly\r\n    entered Nueva Vizcaya when they started to give themselves\r\n    up furiously to robbery, looking upon all things as loot;\r\n    in the very shadow of these soldiers the province was invaded\r\n    by a mob of adventurous and ragged persons from Nueva Ecija;\r\n    between the two they picked Nueva Vizcaya clean. When they had\r\n    grown tired of completely shearing the unfortunate Vizcayan\r\n    people, leaving them poverty-stricken, they flew in small\r\n    bands to the pueblos of Isabela, going as far as Angadanan,\r\n    giving themselves up to unbridled pillage of the most unjust\r\n    and disorderly kind. Some of these highwaymen demanded money\r\n    and arms from the priest of Angadanan, but Father Marciano\r\n    informed them 'that it could not be, as Leyba already knew\r\n    what he had and would be angry.'\r\n\r\n    \"To this very day the people of Nueva Vizcaya have been\r\n    unable to recover from the stupendous losses suffered by\r\n    them as regards their wealth and industries. How many curses\r\n    did they pour forth and still continue to level against the\r\n    Katipúnan that brought them naught but tribulations!\"\r\n\r\nConfirmation of these statements is found in the following brief but\r\nsignificant passage from the Insurgent records:--\r\n\r\n    \"At the end of December, 1898, when the military commander\r\n    of Nueva Vizcaya called upon the Governor of that province to\r\n    order the police of the towns to report to him as volunteers to\r\n    be incorporated in the army which was being prepared for the\r\n    defence of the country, the Governor protested against it and\r\n    informed the government that his attempt to obtain volunteers\r\n    was in fact only a means of disarming the towns and leaving\r\n    them without protection against the soldiers who did what\r\n    they wanted and took what they wished and committed every\r\n    outrage without being punished for it by their officers.\" [282]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the surrender of Nueva Vizcaya on Leyba and Villa is\r\nthus described by Father Malumbres:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mad with joy and swollen with pride Leyba and company were\r\n    like men who travelled flower-strewn paths, crowned with\r\n    laurels, and were acclaimed as victors in all the towns on\r\n    their road, their intoxication of joy taking a sudden rise when\r\n    they came to believe themselves kings of the valley. It was\r\n    then that their delirium reached its brimful measure and their\r\n    treatment of those whom they had vanquished began to be daily\r\n    more cruel and inhuman. In Cagayan their fear of the forces\r\n    in Nueva Vizcaya kept them from showing such unqualifiable\r\n    excesses of cruelty and nameless barbarities, but the triumph\r\n    of the Katipúnan arms in Nueva Vizcaya completely broke\r\n    down the wall of restraint which somewhat repressed those\r\n    sanguinary executioners thirsting to fatten untrammelled on\r\n    the innocent blood of unarmed and defenceless men. From that\r\n    melancholy time there began an era of unheard of outrages and\r\n    barbarous scenes, unbelievable were they not proved by evidence\r\n    of every description. The savage acts committed in Isabela by\r\n    the inhuman Leyba and Villa cannot possibly be painted true\r\n    to life and in all their tragic details. The blackest hues,\r\n    the most heartrending accents, the most vigorous language\r\n    and the most fulminating anathemas would be a pale image of\r\n    the truth, and our pen cannot express with true ardour the\r\n    terrifying scenes and cruel torments brought about by such\r\n    fierce chieftains on such indefensive religious. It seems\r\n    impossible that a fleshly heart could hold so much wickedness,\r\n    for these petty chiefs were veritable monsters of cruelty who\r\n    surpassed a Nero; men who were entire strangers to noble and\r\n    humane sentiments and who in appearance having the figure of\r\n    a man were in reality tigers roaring in desperation, or mad\r\n    dogs who gnashed their teeth in fury.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 18 Leyba continued his march, while Villa remained\r\nbehind at Ilagan to torture the prisoners who might be brought in\r\nfrom Isabela.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Gamut, Leyba at once entered the _convento_ and as usual\r\nimmediately demanded money from the priests. Father Venancio gave\r\nhim all he had. He was nevertheless given a frightful whipping, six\r\npersons holding him while others rained blows upon him. A determined\r\neffort was made to force the priest to recant, and when this failed\r\nLeyba leaped upon him, kicking and beating him. He then ordered him\r\nthrown down face uppermost, and asked for a knife with the apparent\r\nintention of mutilating him. He did not use the knife, however, but\r\ninstead, assisted by his followers, gave the unhappy priest another\r\nterrific beating, even standing upon him and leaping up and down. The\r\npriest was left unable to speak, and did not recover for months.\r\n\r\nLater Leyba had torture by water applied to Father Gregorio Cabrero\r\nand lay brother Venancio Aguinaco, while Father Sabanda was savagely\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of September Father Miguel Garcia of Reina Mercedes was\r\nhorribly beaten in his _convento_ by a captain sent there to get what\r\nmoney he had.\r\n\r\nIn Cauayan, on September 20, Fathers Perez and Aguirrezabal were\r\nbeaten and compelled to give up money by five emissaries of Leyba,\r\nand the latter priest was cut in the face with a sabre. The _convento_\r\nwas sacked. On the 25th Leyba arrived and after kicking and beating\r\nFather Garcia compelled him to give up $1700. He then informed the\r\npriests that if it were not for Aguinaldo's orders he would kill all\r\nthe Spaniards.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 24th three priests and a Spaniard named Soto\r\narrived at Ilagan. The following is the statement of an eye-witness\r\nas to what happened:--\r\n\r\n    \"They led the priests to the headquarters of the commanding\r\n    officer where the tyrant Villa, always eager to inflict\r\n    suffering on humanity, awaited them. The scene witnessed\r\n    by the priests obeisant to the cruel judge was horrifying\r\n    in the extreme. Four lions whose thirst for vengeance was\r\n    extreme in all, threw themselves, blind with fury, without\r\n    a word and with the look of a basilisk, upon poor Señor Soto\r\n    giving him such innumerable and furious blows on head and face\r\n    that weary as he was from his past journey, the ill-treatment\r\n    received at Angadanan and weighted down by years, he was soon\r\n    thrown down by his executioners under the lintel of the door\r\n    getting a terrible blow on the head as he fell; even this did\r\n    not satisfy nor tame down those fierce-hearted men, who on\r\n    the contrary continued with their infamous work more furious\r\n    than before, and their cruelty did not flag on seeing their\r\n    victim at their feet. They could have done no worse had they\r\n    been Silípan savages dancing in triumph around the palpitating\r\n    head cut from the body of some enemy.\r\n\r\n    \"The priests who witnessed this blood-curdling scene trembled\r\n    like the weak reed before the gale, waiting their turn to be\r\n    tortured, but God willed that cruel Villa should be content\r\n    with the butchery perpetrated upon unhappy Sr. Soto. Villa\r\n    dismissed the priests after despoiling them of their bags and\r\n    clothes telling them, to torment them: 'Go to the _convento_\r\n    until the missing ones turn up so that I may shoot you all\r\n    together.'\"\r\n\r\nLeyba entered Echague on September 22, promptly going to the _convento_\r\nas usual and demanding money of the priest, Father Mata. When the\r\nlatter had given him all he had, he received three terrific beatings\r\nat the hands of some twelve men armed with whips and sticks, after\r\nwhich Leyba himself struck him with his fist and his sabre. He was\r\nfinally knocked down by a blow with the sabre and left disabled. It\r\ntook six months for him to recover.\r\n\r\nShortly after Leyba's arrival in Nueva Vizcaya on the afternoon of\r\nthe 25th, five priests were summoned to Solano and there abused in\r\nthe usual fashion in an effort to extort money from them. Only one\r\nescaped ill treatment and one was nearly killed.\r\n\r\nLeyba now went to Bayombong to carry out the established programme\r\nwith the priests. There he found Governor Perez of Isabela, who had\r\ntaken with him certain government moneys and employed them to pay\r\nsalaries of soldiers and other employees. He insisted on the return\r\nof the total amount and threatened to shoot Perez if it was not\r\nforthcoming. The Spaniards of the vicinity subscribed $700 which they\r\nthemselves badly needed and saved him from being shot. The priests\r\nof the place were then summoned to Leyba's quarters and were beaten\r\nand tortured. One of them was thrown on the floor and beaten nearly\r\nto death, Leyba standing meanwhile with his foot on the unfortunate\r\nman's neck. Another was given six hundred lashes and countless blows\r\nand kicks. Leyba stood on this man's neck also. When the victim's back\r\nceased to have any feeling, his legs were beaten. Leyba terminated\r\nthis period of diversion by kicking Father Diez in the solar plexus\r\nand then mocking him as he lay gasping on the floor. That afternoon\r\none of the priests, so badly injured that he could not rise unaided,\r\nwas put on a horse and compelled to ride in the hot sun to Solano.\r\n\r\nVilla and Leyba had their able imitators, as is shown by the following\r\ndescription of the torturing of Father Ceferino by Major Delfin at\r\nSolano, Nueva Vizcaya, on September 27:--\r\n\r\n    \"They wished to give brave evidence of their hate for the friar\r\n    before Leyba left, and show him that they were as brave as\r\n    he when it came to oppressing and torturing the friar. This\r\n    tragedy began by Jimenez again asking Father Ceferino for\r\n    the money. The priest answered as he had done before. Then\r\n    Jimenez started to talk in Tagalog to the commanding officer\r\n    and surely it was nothing good that he told him, for suddenly\r\n    Delfin left the bench and darting fire from his eyes, fell\r\n    in blind fury upon the defenceless priest; what harsh words\r\n    he uttered in Tagalog while he vented his fury on his victim,\r\n    striking him with his clenched fist, slapping him and kicking\r\n    him, I do not know, but the religious man fell at the feet of\r\n    his furious executioner who, being now the prey of the most\r\n    stupendous rage, could scarcely get his tongue to stutter and\r\n    continued to kick the priest, without seeing where he kicked\r\n    him. Getting deeper and deeper in the abyss and perhaps not\r\n    knowing what he was about, this petty chief made straight for\r\n    a sabre lying on a table to continue his bloody work. In the\r\n    meantime the priest had risen to his feet and awaited with\r\n    resignation new torments which certainly were even worse than\r\n    the first, for he gave him so many and such hard blows with\r\n    the sabre that the blade was broken close to the hilt. This\r\n    accident so infuriated Delfin that he again threw himself upon\r\n    the priest, kicking him furiously and striking him repeatedly\r\n    until he again threw him to the ground, and not yet satisfied,\r\n    his vengefulness led him to throw himself upon his victim with\r\n    the fury of a tiger after his prey, beating him on the head\r\n    with the hilt of the saber until the blood ran in streams\r\n    and formed pools upon the pavement. The priest, more dead\r\n    than alive, shuddered from head to foot, and appeared to be\r\n    struggling in a tremendous fight between life and death; he\r\n    had hardly enough strength to get his tongue to ask for God's\r\n    mercy. At this most critical juncture, and when it seemed as\r\n    if death were inevitable, the martyr received absolution from\r\n    Father Diez, who witnessed the blood-curdling picture with\r\n    his heart pierced with grief at the sight of the sufferings\r\n    of his innocent brother, feeling as must the condemned man\r\n    preparing for death who sees the hours fly by with vertiginous\r\n    rapidity. The blood flowing from the wounds on the priest's\r\n    head appeared to infuriate and blind the heart of Delfin who,\r\n    rising from his victim's body, sped away to the armory in the\r\n    court house, seized a rifle, and came back furious to brain\r\n    him with the butt and finish killing the priest; but God\r\n    willed to free his servant from death at the hands of those\r\n    cannibals, so that generous Lieutenant Navarro interfered,\r\n    took the rifle away from him and caught Delfin by the arm,\r\n    threatening him with some words spoken in Tagalog. Then\r\n    Navarro, to appease Delfin's anger, turned the priest over\r\n    with his face to the ground and gave him a few strokes with the\r\n    bamboo, and feigning anger and indignation, ordered him away.\r\n\r\n    \"Those who witnessed the horrible tragedy, the brutality of the\r\n    tyrant and the prostration of the friar were persuaded that\r\n    the latter would never survive his martyrdom. The religious\r\n    man himself holds it as a veritable portent that he outlived\r\n    such a terrible trial; but even this did not satisfy them as\r\n    subsequently the Secretary again called Father Ceferino to\r\n    subject him to a further scrutiny, as ridiculous as it was\r\n    malicious, though it did not go beyond words or insults.\"\r\n\r\nSeñor Perez, the governor of Isabela, and Father Diez were compelled\r\nto go to Ilagan. After they had arrived there on October 2d, Villa\r\nproceeded to torture them. At the outset ten soldiers, undoubtedly\r\ninstructed beforehand, beat the governor down to the earth, with the\r\nbutts of their guns. Villa himself struck him three times in the chest\r\nwith the butt of a gun and Father Diez gave him absolution, thinking\r\nhe was dying. Father Diez was then knocked down repeatedly with the\r\nbutts of guns, being made to stand up promptly each time in order\r\nthat he might be knocked down again. Not satisfied with this, Villa\r\ncompelled the suffering priest to kneel before him and kicked him in\r\nthe nose, repeating the operation until he left him stretched on the\r\nfloor half-senseless with his nose broken. He next had both victims\r\nput in stocks with their weight supported by their feet alone. While\r\nin this position soldiers beat them and jumped onto them and one set\r\nthe governor's beard on fire with matches. Father Diez was kept in\r\nthe stocks four days. He was then sent to Tuguegarao in order that\r\npersonal enemies there might take vengeance on him, Villa bidding\r\nhim good-by with the following words: \"Go now to Tuguegarao and see\r\nif they will finish killing you there.\" Señor Perez was kept in the\r\nstocks eight days and it is a wonder that he did not die.\r\n\r\nUpon the 25th of September Villa went to the _convento_ in Ilagan\r\nprepared to torture the priests, but he succeeded in compelling a\r\nnumber of them to sign indorsements in his favour on various letters\r\nof credit payable by the Tabacalera Company and departed again in\r\nfairly good humour, having done nothing worse than strike one of them.\r\n\r\nLater, however, on the pretext that Fathers Aguado and Labanda had\r\nmoney hidden away, he determined to torture them with water. The first\r\nto be tortured was Father Labanda. Villa had him taken to the prison\r\nwhere the priest found his two faithful Filipino servants who had\r\nbeen beaten cruelly and were then hanging from a beam, this having\r\nbeen done in order to make them tell where his money was.\r\n\r\nHe was tied after the usual fashion and water poured down his nose\r\nand throat. During the brief respites necessary in order to prevent\r\nhis dying outright he was cruelly beaten. They finally dragged him\r\nout of the prison by the feet, his head leaving a bloody trail on\r\nthe stones. After he had been taken back to his companions, one of\r\nthe men who had tortured him came to beg his pardon, saying that he\r\nhad been compelled to do it by Villa.\r\n\r\nFather Aguado was next tortured in one of the rooms of the\r\n_convento_. Villa finished the day's work by announcing to the band\r\nof priests that he would have them all shot the next day on the plaza,\r\nand ordering them to get ready.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th the barbarities practised by this inhuman fiend reached\r\ntheir climax in the torturing to death of Lieutenant Piera. The\r\nfollowing description gives some faint idea of one of the most\r\ndiabolical crimes ever committed in the Philippines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Villa's cruelty and sanguinary jeering grew without let\r\n    or hindrance from day to day; it seemed that this hyena\r\n    continually cudgelled his brains to invent new kinds of\r\n    torture and to jeer at the friars. On the night of the 29th of\r\n    September the diabolical idea occurred to him of giving the\r\n    _coup de grace_ to the prestige of the friars by making them\r\n    pass through the streets of Ilagan conducting and playing\r\n    a band of music. He carried out his nonsensical purpose by\r\n    calling upon Father Diogracias to play the big drum, and when\r\n    this priest had started playing Villa learned that Father\r\n    Primo was a musician and could therefore play the drum and\r\n    lead the band with all skill, so he called upon Father Primo\r\n    to come forward, and with one thing and another this ridiculous\r\n    function was carried on until the late hours of the night.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"While these two priests were serenading Villa and his\r\n    gang, the most dreadful shrieks were heard from the jail,\r\n    accompanied by pitiful cries that would melt the coldest\r\n    heart. The priests hearing these echoes of sorrow and pain,\r\n    and who did not know for what purpose Fathers Deogracias and\r\n    Primo had been separated from them, seemed to recognize the\r\n    voices of these two priests among the groans, believing them\r\n    to be cruelly tortured; for this reason they began to say\r\n    the rosary in order that the Most Holy Virgin might imbue\r\n    them with patience and fortitude in their martyrdom. Great\r\n    was their surprise when these priests returned saying that\r\n    they had contented themselves with merely making fun of them\r\n    by obliging them to play the big drum and lead the band.\r\n\r\n    \"Although this somewhat tempered their sorrow, a thorn remained\r\n    in their hearts, fearing that the moving lamentations and the\r\n    mortal groans came from the lips of some hapless Spaniard. This\r\n    fatidical presentiment turned out unfortunately to be a\r\n    fact. The victim sacrificed that melancholy night, still\r\n    remembered with a shudder by the priests, was Lieutenant\r\n    Salvador Piera. This brave soldier, who had made up his\r\n    mind to die in the breach rather than surrender the town\r\n    of Aparri, was persuaded to capitulate only by the prayers\r\n    and tears of certain Spanish ladies who had been instructed\r\n    to do so by a man who should have been the first one to\r\n    shoulder a rifle. After having been harassed in Aparri he\r\n    was taken to Tuguegarao at the request of Esteban Quinta\r\n    or Isidoro Maquigat, two artful filibusters thirsting to\r\n    revenge themselves on the Lieutenant, who during the time\r\n    of the Spanish government had justly laid his heavy hand\r\n    upon them. In the latter part of September they conducted\r\n    him on foot and without any consideration whatever to the\r\n    capital of Isabela. In this town he was at once placed in\r\n    solitary confinement in one of the rooms of the _convento_\r\n    and allowed no intercourse with any one. The sin for which\r\n    they recriminated Piera was his having charged Dimas [283]\r\n    with being a filibuster, and their revengefulness reached\r\n    an incredible limit. The heartrending moans of this martyr\r\n    to his duty still resound in that _convento_ converted into\r\n    the scene of an orgy of blood. The unfortunate man was heard\r\n    to shout: 'For God's sake, for God's sake, have pity,' and\r\n    trustworthy persons tell that under the strain of torture\r\n    he would challenge them to fight in a fair field by saying:\r\n    'I will fight alone against twenty of you;' but the cowardly\r\n    torturers, a reproach to the Filipino race, looked upon it as\r\n    an amusement to glut their spite on a defenceless man whose\r\n    hands were tied. They had him strung up all night with but\r\n    insignificant refreshment and rest, sometimes being suspended\r\n    by his arms which finally became disjointed and useless, and\r\n    at others he was hung up by his feet, the blood rushing to his\r\n    head and placing him in imminent danger of sudden death. It\r\n    was the intention of these brutes to torture him as much as\r\n    possible before killing him, just as a member of the feline\r\n    race plays with, tosses in the air and pirouettes around the\r\n    victim which falls into his claws. If to the torture of the\r\n    rope are added the blows with cudgels and the butts of rifles\r\n    which were frequently rained upon the victim it will be no\r\n    surprise that early on the morning of the 30th he was in the\r\n    throes of death in the midst of which the sufferer had just\r\n    enough strength to say that he was hungry and thirsty; then\r\n    those cannibals (the heart is filled with fury in setting forth\r\n    such cruelty) cut a piece of flesh from the calf of the dying\r\n    man's leg and conveyed it to his mouth and instead of water\r\n    they gave him to drink some of his own urine. What savagery!\r\n\r\n    \"The blood from the wound finished the killing of the fainting\r\n    Piera. The blood shed served to infuriate more the barbarous\r\n    executioners who in order to give the finishing stroke to the\r\n    martyr, as an unrivalled expression of their savage ferocity,\r\n    thrust a red-hot iron into his mouth and eyes. That same night\r\n    these treacherous and ferocious tyrants whose sin made them\r\n    hate the light, buried the body in the darkness of the night\r\n    in a patch of cogon grass adjoining the _convento_.\"\r\n\r\nPiera's torture was by no means confined to this last night of his\r\nlife, as the following account of it shows:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the first days of this accursed month, while the padres\r\n    were bemoaning their fate in jail, a dark drama was being\r\n    enacted in the _convento_, whose hair-raising scenes would\r\n    have inspired terror to Montepiu himself.\r\n\r\n    \"Lieutenant Salvador Piera of the Guardia Civil, commanding\r\n    officer at Aparri, who, realizing that all resistance\r\n    was useless, gave way to the persistent solicitations of\r\n    Spaniards and natives and surrendered that town on honourable\r\n    terms, which the Katipúnan forces did not respect after\r\n    the capitulation had been signed, was sent for by Villa,\r\n    the military authority of Isabela. Something terrible was\r\n    going to happen as Piera himself felt confident, for it is\r\n    said that before leaving Aparri he went to confession where\r\n    he settled the important business of his conscience in a\r\n    Christian manner with a representative of God.\r\n\r\n    \"And so it turned out, for as soon as he arrived in Ilagan he\r\n    was taken to the _convento_ and placed incomunicado in one of\r\n    its apartments. Soon after, three or four vile fiends,--for\r\n    they do not deserve the name of men,--bound him with strong\r\n    cords and hanged him to a beam. Then they began to charge\r\n    him with having prosecuted a certain Mason, and inflicted\r\n    upon him the most frightful tortures. The pen refuses to set\r\n    forth so many atrocities. For three days they had him in that\r\n    position while his vile assassins made a martyr of him. Our\r\n    hair stands on end to think of such crimes. The heart-rending\r\n    cries of this unfortunate man while prey to such barbarous\r\n    torments could be heard in every part of the town and carried\r\n    panic to the homes of all the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    \"The late hours of the night were always chosen by those\r\n    treacherous fiends to give Piera the _trato de cuerda_ (this\r\n    form of torture consists in tying the hands of the victim\r\n    behind his back and hanging him by them by a rope passed\r\n    through a pulley attached to a beam; his body is lifted as\r\n    high as it will go and then allowed to fall by its own weight\r\n    without reaching the ground); but this torture was administered\r\n    to him in a form so terrible that all the pictures of this kind\r\n    of torment found in the dreadful narratives of the calumniators\r\n    of the Holy Office, pale into insignificance in comparison\r\n    with the atrocious details of the tortures here recited; at\r\n    each violent jerk the unhappy victim feeling that his limbs\r\n    were being torn asunder would cry out 'My God! My God!' This\r\n    terrifying cry reverberating through the jail would freeze\r\n    the very blood of the poor priests therein incarcerated.\r\n\r\n    \"On the third day, when those infuriated hyenas appeared\r\n    to have spent their diabolical rage; after they had thrust\r\n    a red-hot iron into his eyes and left him with sightless\r\n    sockets; the poor martyr, the prey of delirium, cried out\r\n    that he was hungry, and one of those _sicarii_ cut a piece of\r\n    flesh from Piera's thigh and was infamous enough to carry it\r\n    to his mouth. On the night of the seventh of the month very\r\n    late a number of wretches buried in the _convento_ garden a\r\n    body still dripping warm blood from the lips of which there\r\n    escaped the feeble plaints of anguish of a dying man.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the Spaniards relative to this matter is well shown\r\nby the following statement of Father Malumbres:--\r\n\r\n    \"This horrible crime cannot be pardoned by God or man, and\r\n    is still uninvestigated, crying to Heaven for vengeance with\r\n    greater reason than the blood of the innocent Abel. So long\r\n    as the criminals remain unpunished it will be a black and\r\n    indelible stigma and an ugly stain on the race harbouring\r\n    in its midst the perpetrators of this unheard-of sin. Words\r\n    of reprobation are not enough, justice demands exemplary and\r\n    complete reparation, and if the powers of earth do not take\r\n    justice into their own hands, God will send fire from Heaven\r\n    and will cause to disappear from the face of the earth the\r\n    criminals and even their descendants. A murder so cruel and\r\n    premeditated can be punished in no other way.\r\n\r\n    \"If the courts here should wish to punish the guilty persons\r\n    it would not be a difficult task; the public points its\r\n    finger at those who dyed their hands in the blood of the\r\n    heroic soldier, and we shall set them forth here echoing\r\n    the voice of the people. The soulless instigator was Dimas\r\n    Guzman. The executioners were a certain José Guzman (alias\r\n    Pepin, a nephew of Dimas) and Cayetano Pérez.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was duly taken up in the courts, and Judge Blount himself\r\ntried the cases.\r\n\r\nThe judge takes a very mild and liberal view of the occurrence. He\r\nsays of it: [284]--\r\n\r\n    \"Villa was accompanied by his aide, Lieutenant Ventura\r\n    Guzman. The latter is an old acquaintance of the author\r\n    of the present volume, who tried him afterwards, in 1901,\r\n    for playing a minor part in the murder of an officer of the\r\n    Spanish army committed under Villa's orders just prior to,\r\n    or about the time of, the Wilcox-Sargent visit. He was found\r\n    guilty, and sentenced, but later liberated under President\r\n    Roosevelt's amnesty of 1902. He was guilty, but the deceased,\r\n    so the people in the Cagayan Valley used to say, in being\r\n    tortured to death, got only the same sort of medicine he had\r\n    often administered thereabouts. At any rate, that was the\r\n    broad theory of the amnesty in wiping out all these old cases.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds:--\r\n\r\n    \"I sentenced both Dimas and Ventura to life imprisonment for\r\n    being accessory to the murder of the Spanish officer above\r\n    named, Lieutenant Piera. Villa officiated as arch-fiend on\r\n    the grewsome occasion. I am quite sure I would have hung\r\n    Villa without any compunction at that time, if I could have\r\n    gotten hold of him. I tried to get hold of him, but Governor\r\n    Taft's attorney-general, Mr. Wilfley, wrote me that Villa was\r\n    somewhere over on the mainland of Asia on British territory,\r\n    and extradition would involve application to the London Foreign\r\n    Office. The intimation was that we had trouble enough of our\r\n    own without borrowing any from feuds that had existed under\r\n    our predecessors in sovereignty. I have understood that Villa\r\n    is now practising medicine in Manila. More than one officer\r\n    of the American army that I know afterwards did things to\r\n    the Filipinos almost as cruel as Villa did to that unhappy\r\n    Spanish officer, Lieutenant Piera. On the whole, I think\r\n    President Roosevelt acted wisely and humanely in wiping the\r\n    slate. We had new problems to deal with, and were not bound\r\n    to handicap ourselves with the old ones left over from the\r\n    Spanish régime.\" [285]\r\n\r\nBut it happens that this was the Filipino régime. Piera's torture\r\noccurred at the very time when, according to Blount, Aguinaldo had\r\n\"a wonderfully complete 'going concern' throughout the Philippine\r\narchipelago.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it occurred in the Cagayan valley where Blount says\r\n\"perfect tranquillity and public order\" were then being maintained\r\nby \"the authority of the Aguinaldo government\" in a country which\r\nMessrs. Wilcox and Sargent, who arrived on the scene of this barbarous\r\nmurder by torture four weeks later, found so \"quiet and orderly.\"\r\n\r\nNot only was Blount perfectly familiar with every detail of this\r\ndamnable crime, but he must of necessity have known of the torturing\r\nof friars to extort money, which preceded and followed it.\r\n\r\nThe following statement seems to sum up his view of the whole matter:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is true there were cruelties practised by the Filipinos\r\n    on the Spaniards. But they were ebullitions of revenge for\r\n    three centuries of tyranny. They do not prove unfitness for\r\n    self-government. I, for one, prefer to follow the example set\r\n    by the Roosevelt amnesty of 1902, and draw the veil over all\r\n    those matters.\" [286]\r\n\r\nThe judge drew the veil not only over this, but, as we have seen,\r\nover numerous other pertinent matters which occurred in this land of\r\n\"profound peace and tranquillity\" just at the time Wilcox and Sargent\r\nwere making their trip. My apologies to him for withdrawing the\r\nveil and for maintaining that such occurrences as those in question\r\ndemonstrate complete and utter unfitness for self-government on the\r\npart of those who brought them about!\r\n\r\nIf it be true that Blount knew more than one officer of the American\r\narmy who did things to the Filipinos almost as cruel as Villa did to\r\nLieutenant Piera, why did he not report them and have the criminals\r\nbrought to justice?\r\n\r\nSuch an attack on the army, in the course of which there is not given\r\na name or a fact which could serve as a basis for an investigation,\r\nis cowardly and despicable.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment believe that Blount speaks the truth, but if\r\nhe does, then his failure to attempt to bring to justice the human\r\nfiends concerned brands him!\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion in certain quarters to make vile allegations\r\nof this sort against officers of the United States army, couching them\r\nin discreetly general terms. This is a contemptible procedure, for\r\nit frees those who make reckless charges from danger of the criminal\r\nproceedings which would otherwise doubtless be brought against them.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Ilagan, the town where Piera was tortured to death,\r\nBlount says [287] that Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent were\r\n\r\n    \"given a grand _baile_ [ball] and _fiesta_ [feast], a kind\r\n    of dinner-dance, we would call it.... From Ilagan they\r\n    proceeded to Aparri, cordially received everywhere, and\r\n    finding the country in fact, as Aguinaldo always claimed in\r\n    his proclamations of that period, seeking recognition of his\r\n    government by the Powers, in a state of profound peace and\r\n    tranquillity--free from brigandage and the like.\"\r\n\r\nWithin sight of the banquet hall, within hearing of the music, lay\r\na lighter on which were huddled eighty-four priests of the Catholic\r\nChurch, many of them gray-haired old men, innocent of any evil conduct,\r\nwho for weeks had suffered, mentally and physically, the tortures of\r\nthe damned.\r\n\r\nOf the events of this evening and the following day Father Malumbres\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    \"From the river the _convento_ could be seen profusely\r\n    illuminated and the strains of music could be heard, an\r\n    evident sign that they were engaged in revelry. This gave us\r\n    a bad start, as we came to fear that Villa had returned from\r\n    the expedition undertaken to come up with two Americans who\r\n    had crossed the Caraballo range and were thinking of coming\r\n    down as far as Aparri. It was late to announce to Villa our\r\n    arrival at Ilagan, so that we were obliged to pass the night\r\n    on the lighter. In the morning our boat was anchored in front\r\n    of the pueblo of Ilagan, where we were credibly informed that\r\n    Villa had returned. This accursed news made us begin to fear\r\n    some disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\n    \"Our Matias went ashore and delivered the official\r\n    communication regarding our transfer to Villa, while we\r\n    waited impatiently for his decision. Sergeant Matias at length\r\n    returned with orders for our disembarkation; we put on the best\r\n    clothes we had and the rowers placed a broad plank between\r\n    the lighter and the arsenal and we left our floating prison\r\n    two abreast. Matias called the roll and the order to march,\r\n    we were eighty-four friars in a long column climbing the\r\n    steep ascent to Ilagan.\r\n\r\n    \"When we had arrived in front of the building used for\r\n    headquarters, we faced about in front thereof, and the\r\n    first thing we saw in one of the windows were the sinister\r\n    features of Falaris, who with a thundering brow and black\r\n    look was delighting himself in the contemplation of so many\r\n    priests surrounded by bayonets and filled with misery. Any\r\n    other person but Villa would have melted on seeing such\r\n    a spectacle, which could but incite compassion. The two\r\n    American tourists were also looking on at this horrible scene\r\n    as if stupefied, but they soon withdrew in order, perhaps,\r\n    not to look upon such a painful picture. It was, indeed,\r\n    heartrending to contemplate therein old gray-haired men who\r\n    had passed their lives in apostolic work side by side with\r\n    young men who had just arrived in this ungrateful land, and\r\n    many sick who rather than men seemed to be marble statues,\r\n    who had no recourse but to stand in line, without one word\r\n    of consolation; therein figured some who wore religious garb,\r\n    others in secular dress limited to a pair of rumpled trousers\r\n    and a cast-off coat, the lack of this luxurious garment being\r\n    replaced in some instances by a native shirt.\r\n\r\n    \"For two long hours we were detained in the middle of the\r\n    street under the rays of a burning sun and to the scandal of\r\n    the immense crowd which had been gathered together to witness\r\n    the denouement of the tragedy. The priests had hardly come into\r\n    the presence of Villa when Fathers Isidro and Florentino were\r\n    called out for the purpose of having heaped upon them a flood\r\n    of insults and affronts. Father Isidro was ordered by Villa to\r\n    interview Sr. Sabas Orros, who, Villa supposed, would wreak his\r\n    revenge blindly upon him, but he was greatly mistaken, as said\r\n    gentleman treated the priest with great respect; the tyrant\r\n    remained talking to Father Florentino in the reception room\r\n    of the headquarters building, and when it appeared that such\r\n    talk would come to blows, the elder of the Americans left one\r\n    of the rooms toward the reception room, and the scene suddenly\r\n    changing, Villa arose and addressing the priest said: 'I am\r\n    pleased to introduce to you an American Brigadier-General,\r\n    Mr. N.' The latter returned a cordial greeting in Spanish to\r\n    the priest who made a courteous acknowledgment; after this\r\n    exchange of courtesies, Villa resumed his defamatory work,\r\n    pouring out a string of absurdities and infamous insults\r\n    upon the friars, going so far as to say in so many words:\r\n    'from the bishop down you are all thieves and depraved' he\r\n    added another word which it would be shameful to write down,\r\n    and so he went on from one abyss to another without regard\r\n    to reputations or the respect due to venerated persons.\r\n\r\n    \"The American let his disgust be seen while Villa was talking,\r\n    and the latter understood these protests and ordered the\r\n    priest to withdraw, the comedy coming to an end by the\r\n    American shaking hands with the priest and offering him\r\n    assistance. Villa would not shake hands with him, as was\r\n    natural, but the priest was able to see that he was confused\r\n    when he saw the distinction and courtesy with which an\r\n    American general had treated a helpless friar. What a narrow\r\n    idea did the Americans form of the government of Aguinaldo,\r\n    represented by men as savage and inhuman as Villa!\r\n\r\n    \"The natives averred that the Americans referred to were\r\n    spies who had come to explore those provinces and were\r\n    making maps of the strategic points and principal roads,\r\n    so that a very careful watch was kept upon them and Villa\r\n    took measures to have them go down the river without landing\r\n    at any place between Echague and Ilagan. At Ilagan they were\r\n    given an entertainment and dance, Villa being a skilled hand\r\n    in this sort of thing, and a few days later he accompanied\r\n    them to Aparri [288] without allowing them to set foot on\r\n    land. The government of Aguinaldo no longer had everything\r\n    its own way, and secret orders had been given to have every\r\n    step of the explorers followed. The commanding and other\r\n    leading officers of the Valley, supporting the orders of the\r\n    government, circulated an order throughout the towns which\r\n    read as follows:--\r\n\r\n        \"'_To All Local Officers_:\r\n\r\n        \"'You will not permit any maps to be made or notes\r\n        to be taken of strategic points by Americans or\r\n        foreigners; nor will you allow them to become\r\n        acquainted with the points of defence; you will\r\n        endeavour to report immediately to this Government any\r\n        suspicious persons; you will make your investigations\r\n        secretly, accompanying suspected persons and feigning\r\n        that their investigations are approved, and finally\r\n        when it shall seem to you that such suspected persons\r\n        have finished their work, you will advise without\r\n        loss of time, in order that their notes may be seized.'\r\n\r\n        \"Despite this order the Americans were able to\r\n        inform themselves very thoroughly of the forces in\r\n        the Valley and its state of defence, and Filipinos\r\n        were not lacking who for a few pesos would put them\r\n        abreast of all information regarding the plans and\r\n        projects of Aguinaldo's government.\"\r\n\r\nRelative to this Wilcox-Sargent trip Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In October and November, 1898, Paymaster W. B. Wilcox,\r\n    U.S.N., and Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent, U.S.N., travelled\r\n    through Northern Luzon from which they returned with a\r\n    favourable impression of the government which had been set\r\n    up by Aguinaldo's agents.\r\n\r\n    \"It was realized by the subtle men whom they met that it\r\n    was highly expedient that they should make a favourable\r\n    report and accordingly they were well received, and although\r\n    constant obstacles were thrown in the way of their seeing\r\n    what it was not considered well for them to see yet the real\r\n    reasons for the delays in their journey were carefully kept\r\n    from them. At least some of their letters to the fleet were\r\n    taken, translated, and sent to Aguinaldo, who kept them,\r\n    and constant reports upon them and their movements were made.\"\r\n\r\nBlount refers to the fact that Mr. Sargent tells a characteristic\r\nstory of Villa, [289] whose vengeful feeling toward the Spaniards\r\nshowed on all occasions.\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless have interested the travellers to know that the\r\n\"robbery\" consisted in taking the funds out of the province to save\r\nthem from falling into Villa's hands, and in paying them to soldiers in\r\nNueva Vizcaya to whom money was due. It would further have interested\r\nthem to know that this unfortunate Spaniard had been twice tortured\r\nwithin an inch of his life by Villa.\r\n\r\nBut let us continue our interrupted narrative:--\r\n\r\n    \"The presence of the Americans in Ilagan soon freed us from\r\n    certain forms of savagery and barbarous intentions on the\r\n    part of Villa. There can be no doubt that the tyrant was\r\n    constantly cudgelling his brains to invent new methods of\r\n    showing his contempt for the friars; at the unlucky time we\r\n    write of he conceived the infamous plan of ordering a circular\r\n    enclosure of cane to be made, put a pig into it--we trust\r\n    the reader will pardon the details--with a bell hung to his\r\n    neck, blindfolded the priests and compelled them to enter the\r\n    enclosure with sticks in their hands, and in this ridiculous\r\n    attitude, obliged them to strike about when the sound of the\r\n    bell appraised them of the animal's proximity; it is obvious\r\n    that the principal purpose of the fiendish Villa was to have\r\n    the priests lay about them in such a way as to deal each\r\n    other the blows instead of the pig. The tyrant also had the\r\n    idea of making us and the other priests in Ilagan parade the\r\n    streets of that town dancing and playing the band. The wish\r\n    to consummate his plan was not lacking but he was deterred by\r\n    the presence of the Americans and the arguments of Sr. Sabas\r\n    Orros to whom we also owed the signal favour that Villa did\r\n    not take us to our prisons at Tumauini and Gamut on foot and\r\n    with our clothing in a bundle at our backs.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 2 a banquet was given in Villa's honour at Ilagan and the\r\npleasant idea occurred to him to have four of the friars dance at\r\nit for his amusement. The people of the town put their handkerchiefs\r\nbefore their faces to shut out the sight, and some wept. Father Campo,\r\none of the priests who was obliged to dance, had great ulcers on his\r\nlegs from the wounds caused by the cords with which he had been bound\r\nwhen he was tortured with water, and was at first unable to raise his\r\nfeet from the floor; but Villa threatened him with a rattan until he\r\nfinally did so. This caused the sores on his legs to burst open so\r\nthat the bones showed.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of October a number of the friars were compelled to get up a\r\nband and go out and meet Leyba with music on his arrival. The people\r\nof the towns closed their windows in disgust at the sight. A great\r\ncrowd had gathered to receive Leyba, and the priests were compelled\r\nto dance in the middle of the street, but this again only caused\r\ndisgust. A couple of priests were then beaten in the usual fashion\r\nin a private house. This caused murmuring even among those of the\r\nsoldiers who were natives of the Cagayan valley. At the same time\r\ntwo other priests were horribly whipped in the prison.\r\n\r\nThis has been a long story, but the half has not been told. Those\r\nwho escaped torture had their feelings harrowed by the sight of\r\nthe sufferings of their fellows. They were constantly and grossly\r\ninsulted; were often confined in the most unsanitary quarters; given\r\npoor and insufficient food and bad water, or none at all; robbed of\r\ntheir clothing; compelled to march long distances under a tropical\r\nsun when sick, wounded and suffering; obliged to do servants' work\r\npublicly; forced to make a ridiculous spectacle of themselves in the\r\npublic streets; ordered to recant, and heaven knows what not!\r\n\r\nThe torments practised on them had two principal objects: to\r\ncompel them to give up money, and to discredit them with the common\r\npeople. They failed to accomplish this latter result. There is abundant\r\nevidence that the natives of the Cagayan valley clothed and fed\r\nthem when they could, and wept over the painful humiliations and the\r\ndreadful sufferings which they were powerless to prevent or relieve.\r\n\r\nThe tormentors were men from distant provinces, with no possible\r\npersonal grievances against the priests whom they martyrized. Their\r\naction was the result, not of an \"ebullition of revenge for three\r\ncenturies of tyranny\" as stated by Blount, but of insensate greed\r\nof gold and damnable viciousness. I believe the American people will\r\nhold that such cruelities brand those who practise them as unfit to\r\ngovern their fellows, or themselves.\r\n\r\nLest I be accused of basing my conclusions on _ex parte_ statements\r\nI will now return to the Insurgent record of events in the Cagayan\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the Spanish officers of the Tabacalera Company [290]\r\nfared comparatively well. In a letter dated September 27, 1898, and\r\naddressed to the secretary of war of the revolutionary government,\r\nLeyba says of the taking of Tuguegarao that the only terms of the\r\nsurrender were to respect life. He therefore felt at liberty to seize\r\nall the money that the friars had hidden, \"which was accomplished\r\nby applying the stick.\" He adds that they did nothing to the agents\r\nof the great Tabacalera Company, then the most powerful commercial\r\norganization in the Islands, for the significant reason that they\r\nhad found that its stock was largely held by Frenchmen and feared\r\ntrouble. [291]\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 1898, Leyba, concerning whose ideas as to public order\r\nwe are already informed, wrote a most illuminating letter setting\r\nforth the conditions which had existed there. He does not claim that\r\nthere had been Octavian peace!\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that this letter covers the very time\r\nduring which Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent passed through the Cagayan\r\nvalley. It paints a vivid picture of conditions, and as the painter\r\nwas the ranking Insurgent officer in the valley during this entire\r\nperiod, he cannot be accused of hostile prejudice. I therefore give\r\nthe letter in full'--\r\n\r\n    \"_Aparri_, December 4, 1898.\r\n\r\n    \"_Don Baldomero Aguinaldo_,\r\n\r\n    \"_The Secretary of War_:\r\n\r\n    \"_Dear Sir and of My Greatest Esteem_: I take the liberty\r\n    of addressing this to you in order to state that owing to\r\n    the lack of discipline in the soldiers whom we have brought,\r\n    since they are all volunteers and whom I am not able to reduce\r\n    to rigorous subordination, for the revolution would find itself\r\n    without soldiers with whom to win triumph, they committed many\r\n    abuses and misdeed which, for the lack of evidence, I was\r\n    not able to punish, although I knew of these abuses but had\r\n    no proof, and as a lover of my country and of the prestige\r\n    of the Revolutionary Army, I took care not to disclose the\r\n    secret to any one, in this way avoiding the formation of an\r\n    atmosphere against the cause of our Independence to the grave\r\n    injury of us all. But it happened that, in spite of the good\r\n    advice which I have given them and the punishments which I have\r\n    given to some of the 3d Company of Cauit, they did not improve\r\n    their conduct but have gone to the extreme of committing a\r\n    scandalous robbery of 20,800 pesos which sum the German, Otto\r\n    Weber, was taking to the capital, which deed has caused me\r\n    to work without ceasing, without sleeping entire nights, for\r\n    I understood what a serious matter it was to take money from\r\n    a foreigner. After making many inquiries, it was discovered\r\n    that a very large part of the money which reached the sum of\r\n    $10,000, a little more or less, was buried under the quarters\r\n    which the said company occupied, this with the sanction of\r\n    all the officers, it appears to me, because it is impossible\r\n    that such a sum could be brought into a house where so many\r\n    soldiers are living without the knowledge of the officers.\r\n\r\n    \"Indignant at such shameful behaviour, I reprimanded the\r\n    officers and preferred charges against the ones I deemed to\r\n    blame in the matter.\r\n\r\n    \"Afterwards I found out that they had attempted to murder\r\n    me for trying to find out the originators of the crime. On\r\n    account of this, and in order to prevent a civil war which\r\n    would have broken out against the said soldiers if precautions\r\n    had not been taken, I decided to disarm them, to the great\r\n    displeasure of the Colonel who was not aware of my motives.\r\n\r\n    \"This bad conduct has been copied by the soldiers of the 4th\r\n    Company stationed in Ilagan, and I believe the Colonel, guided\r\n    by my warning, will take the same measures in regard to them.\r\n\r\n    \"As the officers are the first ones to commit abuses and\r\n    misdeeds, it is easily seen that the soldiers under their\r\n    orders, guided by them, will commit worse ones than the\r\n    chiefs, and as these seem to lack the moral strength to\r\n    control and reprimand them, I propose to you, if it meets your\r\n    approval, that all these soldiers and some of the officers\r\n    be returned to their homes by the steamer _Luzon_, if there\r\n    should be sufficient coal, or in another if you order it,\r\n    since they tell me themselves that because they are far\r\n    away from their homes they do not wish to continue in the\r\n    service in this province. This is easily arranged as there\r\n    are now men stationed in this province for instructing the\r\n    native volunteers, many of whom have been students, and will\r\n    therefore make good officers and non-commissioned officers,\r\n    and in this way a battalion could be formed, well disciplined\r\n    from the beginning and disgraceful things would be avoided\r\n    not only towards the natives of this province but also towards\r\n    foreigners, which is the most important. Having stated my case,\r\n    I place myself always at your disposal, requesting you will\r\n    attend to this affair.\r\n\r\n    \"With reference to the 4th Company stationed in the Province\r\n    of Isabela, whose captain is Don Antonio Monzon of Panamitan,\r\n    there are many complaints of thefts and assaults committed\r\n    by the soldiers, and in answer to my questions, Don Simeón\r\n    Adriano y Villa, Major and Sanitary Inspector and doctor of\r\n    this battalion, whom I have stationed there for lack of a\r\n    competent person, tells me that he has always punished and\r\n    offered advice to officers and soldiers in order to prevent\r\n    the recurrence of thefts and assaults, but he has never been\r\n    able to suppress them completely, because the soldiers are\r\n    abandoned by their officers, and because of lack of example\r\n    on the part of the latter; they do not understand that it is\r\n    a great blot when they commit these abuses, since when they\r\n    discover the goods or house of a Spaniard they believe they\r\n    have a right to appropriate everything which they encounter.\r\n\r\n    \"I have learned lately, that some foreigners, residents in that\r\n    province, among them some employees of the Tobacco Factory,\r\n    'El Oriente' and of the firm of Baer Senior & Co., who have\r\n    Spanish employees in various pueblos of that province, have\r\n    some very serious complaints to make of assaults committed\r\n    against them prejudicial to their interests; however, I\r\n    hope that now with the arrival of General Tirona he will\r\n    regulate matters, although I believe that this gentleman\r\n    is not sufficiently energetic in proceeding against the\r\n    officers and soldiers, as I have seen when I reprimanded\r\n    and punished them for faults committed he has pardoned them,\r\n    and it appears that he censures energetic acts which we must\r\n    use in order to subject them to rigorous discipline. The same\r\n    thing happened when Major Sr. Victa wished to discipline them;\r\n    it appears that the Colonel reprimanded him when he punished\r\n    some soldiers for gambling in their quarters, since, as you\r\n    know, that gentleman believes that he who is right is the one\r\n    who comes to him first, and who is best able to flatter him.\r\n\r\n    \"The Colonel has agreed with me that his first act on arrival\r\n    at the province of Isabela should be to disarm and take all\r\n    the money he finds among the soldiers of the 4th Company\r\n    (Panamitan) in order to serve as indemnity for the property\r\n    of the foreigners in case they should make any claim.\r\n\r\n    \"I request that you send some leader or officer in order to\r\n    superintend our actions, and to lift the doubt which hangs\r\n    over the person who has worked faithfully and honourably in\r\n    the sacred cause of our Independence.\r\n\r\n    \"I am filling the position of First Chief in the Port of\r\n    Aparri temporarily on account of the absence of the Colonel\r\n    who has conferred on me all his duties and power. After the\r\n    military operations which were carried on as far as the last\r\n    town in Isabela, being tired and somewhat sick, I was put in\r\n    charge of these military headquarters, which I found to be\r\n    very much mixed up, the town, moreover, being desperate on\r\n    account of the assaults committed by my predecessor, Rafael\r\n    Perca, who was appointed by the Colonel, and who was formerly\r\n    2d Captain of the steamer _Filipinas._ After arriving and\r\n    taking charge, having received numerous complaints against\r\n    him, I had him arrested and I found that he had been guilty\r\n    of robbery, unlawful use of insignia, illegal marriage, rape\r\n    and attempted rape. I hold him in custody only awaiting the\r\n    arrival of the Colonel in order to convene a court-martial\r\n    for his trial, in which the Colonel will act as President\r\n    and I as Judge Advocate.\r\n\r\n    \"With nothing more to communicate, I hope you will attend\r\n    to my just claim and send a special delegate to investigate\r\n    our acts and see the truth, for perhaps if a statement comes\r\n    direct from me you will not believe it.\r\n\r\n    \"I am your affectionate and faithful subordinate, who kisses\r\n    your hand,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"_J. N. Leyba_.\" [292]\r\n\r\nBlount states that conditions existed \"just like this, all over Luzon\r\nand the Visayan Islands.\" [293] Unfortunately this was only too true!\r\n\r\nThe troops complained of by Leyba were made up of Aguinaldo's fellow\r\ntownsmen. They never obeyed any one else, and left a trail of murder\r\nand rapine behind them. Aguinaldo never punished them, and from the\r\ntime when one of them tried to murder their commander until a guard\r\ncomposed of them murdered General Antonio Luna in June, 1899, they\r\nare mentioned only with fear and execration.\r\n\r\nBlount describes with enthusiasm the establishment of civil government\r\nin Cagayan.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Americans will be interested in knowing who was its head and\r\nhow it worked. The \"elections\" were held on December 9, 1898, and Dimas\r\nGuzman was chosen head of the province. He was the man subsequently\r\nsentenced to life-imprisonment by Blount, for complicity in the\r\nmurder of Lieutenant Piera. In describing his method of conducting his\r\ngovernment he says that the people doubted the legality of attempts\r\nto collect taxes; that the abuses of heads of towns caused rioting in\r\nthe towns, in which only Ilocanos took part; and that he not only did\r\nnot report these things but contrived to conceal them from foreigners\r\nin the province. [294]\r\n\r\nHis failure to report these troubles and disorders to his government\r\nis of interest, as Blount alleges [295] that differences between the\r\nlocal authorities were in a number of cases referred to the Malolos\r\ngovernment for settlement.\r\n\r\nBlount says [296] that General Otis's reports were full of inexcusable\r\nblunders about the Tagálogs taking possession of provinces and making\r\nthe people do things, and cites the relations between Villa and Dimas\r\nGuzman to illustrate the error of these allegations.\r\n\r\nHe has elsewhere [297] referred to Villa as the \"arch-fiend\" in the\r\nmatter of torturing the unhappy Spaniards as well as the Filipinos who\r\nincurred his ill-will. We have seen that Guzman proved an apt pupil\r\nand did credit to his instructor in connection with the torturing\r\nof Lieutenant Piera, but it nevertheless appears from Guzman's own\r\nstatements that his relations with the Insurgent officers and their\r\nsubordinates involved some rather grave difficulties. Of Major Canoy,\r\nfor instance, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I must add that the said Major Canoy is such a remarkable\r\n    character that he saw fit to give my cook a beating for not\r\n    taking off his hat when he met him. He insulted the delegate\r\n    of rents of Cabagan Viejo for the same reason. He struck the\r\n    head man of the town of Bagabag in the face. He put some of\r\n    the members of the town council of Echague in the stocks,\r\n    and he had others whipped.\" [298]\r\n\r\nIt was really incautious for Governor Guzman to complain of these\r\nconditions because Major Canoy and his party won, and the Governor\r\nhad to resign.\r\n\r\nBut the day of reckoning came. It was in consequence of the atrocities\r\ncommitted by the Tagálog soldiers in the Cagayan valley that Captain\r\nBatchelder was able a little later to march practically unopposed\r\nthrough the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela and Cagayan with one\r\nbattalion of American negro troops, for whom he had neither food nor\r\nextra ammunition, and that Tirona surrendered the Insurgent forces\r\nin the valley without attempting resistance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nInsurgent Rule in the Visayas and Elsewhere\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to the conditions alleged to have been found by Sargent\r\nand Wilcox in the Cagayan valley, Blount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Had another Sargent and another Wilcox made a similar trip\r\n    through the provinces of southern Luzón about this same time,\r\n    under similar friendly auspices, before we turned friendship\r\n    to hate and fear and misery, in the name of Benevolent\r\n    Assimilation, they would, we now know, have found similar\r\n    conditions.\" [299]\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the provinces of Mindoro and Palawan, and the great\r\nisland of Mindanao, he dodges the issue, alleging the unimportance\r\nof Mindoro and Palawan, and claiming that \"Mohammedan Mindanao\"\r\npresents a problem by itself. Under such generalities he hides the\r\ntruth as to what happened in these regions.\r\n\r\nI agree with him that there was essential identity between actual\r\nconditions in the Cagayan valley and those which prevailed under\r\nInsurgent rule elsewhere in Luzón and in the Visayas. I will go\r\nfurther and say that conditions in the Cagayan valley did not differ\r\nessentially from those which prevailed throughout all portions of\r\nthe archipelago which fell under Insurgent control, except that in\r\nseveral provinces captured friars and other Spaniards were quickly\r\nmurdered whereas in the Cagayan valley no friar was quite killed\r\noutright by torture. Those who ultimately died of their injuries\r\nlived for some time.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider some of the actual occurrences in these other\r\nprovinces, continuing to follow the route of our tourists until it\r\nbrings us back to Manila.\r\n\r\n_South Ilocos_\r\n\r\nThe first province visited by Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent after\r\nleaving Aparri was South Ilocos. The conditions which had prevailed\r\nat Vigan, the capital of the province, shortly before their arrival,\r\nare described in a letter signed \"Mariano\" and addressed under date\r\nof September 25, 1898, to Señor Don Mena Crisólogo, from which I\r\nquote extracts:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Dear Mena_: I read with a happy heart your letter of the\r\n    3rd instant, and in answer I have to say:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the 22nd of August a mass meeting was held for the election\r\n    of the local presidente of this town, and I was elected to\r\n    the office; and on the 1st instant the Colonel appointed me\r\n    Provisional Provincial President of this province, so that\r\n    you can imagine the position I am in and the responsibilities\r\n    which weigh on me.\r\n\r\n    \"Your house is occupied by the Colonel, in view of the fact\r\n    that it is not rented.\r\n\r\n    \"I have here eleven friar prisoners and the damned priests\r\n    who escaped from here have not as yet been returned, but it\r\n    is known that they are prisoners in Cagayan, and as soon as\r\n    they arrive here I will treat them as they deserve.\r\n\r\n    \"It is with great regret that I have to relate the events\r\n    and misfortunes which we have been suffering here since the\r\n    arrival of the troops, as all the detachments are supported\r\n    by the towns, and here in the capital where the commissary\r\n    is established, our resources are exhausted, owing to the\r\n    unreasonable demands of the commissary, because he never asks\r\n    what is only just and necessary, but if he needs provisions for\r\n    200 men, he always asks enough for 1000. And notwithstanding\r\n    this, the most lamentable and sad occurrences are taking\r\n    place almost daily in the different barrios, and often in\r\n    the town itself; the soldiers are guilty of many abuses and\r\n    disorderly acts, such as rapes and murders, which usually\r\n    remain unpunished by reason of the real authors thereof not\r\n    being found, and when they are found and reported to their\r\n    commanders, the latter do nothing. One night the house and\r\n    estate of Sario Tinon in Anannam was sacked by six armed men,\r\n    who threatened him and took his money, his wife's jewels and\r\n    the best horses he had. Thank God that his family was at the\r\n    time in the capital, and it appears that now the authors of\r\n    this act are being discovered.\r\n\r\n    \"I am at the present time working with Father Aglipay to have\r\n    the forces stationed here replaced by our volunteers which I\r\n    am recruiting, in order to prevent in so far as possible the\r\n    frequent acts of barbarity which the former are committing\r\n    in the province.\r\n\r\n    \"When the friars from Lepanto arrived here, they were made\r\n    to publish the following proclamation:--\r\n\r\n    \"'_Proclamation_.--We, the friars, declare that all the acts\r\n    committed by us against the honest Filipinos when we discharged\r\n    our respective offices, were false and in contravention of the\r\n    rights of the Holy Church, because we only wished to deceive\r\n    and prejudice the honest inhabitants of the Philippines; for\r\n    which reason we now suffer what we are suffering, as you see,\r\n    according to the old adage that \"he who owes must pay.\" And\r\n    now we inform all you honest Filipinos that we repent for\r\n    the acts above referred to, which are in contravention of\r\n    the laws and good customs, and ask your pardon.--_Vigan_,\r\n    September 13, 1898.'\r\n\r\n    \"All of which I communicate to you in order that you may\r\n    form an idea of what is taking place here, and take such\r\n    steps as may be proper for the common good, and especially\r\n    for the good of this town, hoping that with the aid of your\r\n    valuable protection the abuses and disorders suffered by the\r\n    residents will be stopped.\" [300]\r\n\r\nThe province of Abra, now a subprovince of South Ilocos, was evidently\r\nno exception to the general rule, for there is on file a letter to\r\nAguinaldo with twenty-six signatures, protesting bitterly against the\r\noppression of the poor, in the effort to compel them to contribute war\r\ntaxes, complaining against the misuse of supplies gathered ostensibly\r\nfor the soldiers, and stating that the petitioners will be obliged to\r\ntake refuge with the Igorots and Negritos, if not granted relief. [301]\r\n\r\nApparently the trouble grew, for on December 27, 1898, the \"Director\r\nof Diplomacy\" telegraphed to Aguinaldo concerning it, saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most urgent. The discontent in the provinces of Pangasinán,\r\n    Tarlac and Yloco (Ilocos) is increasing. The town of Bangbang\r\n    rose in revolt the 25th and 26th of this month, and killed\r\n    all of the civil officials. It is impossible to describe\r\n    the abuses committed by the military and civil authorities\r\n    of the said provinces. I urge you to send a force of 100 men\r\n    and a diplomatic officer to reëstablish order. The matter is\r\n    urgent.\" [302]\r\n\r\nI find nothing important in the Insurgent records concerning conditions\r\nin La Union at this time. Pangasinán, Tarlac, Pampanga and Bulacan,\r\nwhich were now revisited by our tourists, have already been discussed.\r\n\r\n_The Province of Manila_\r\n\r\nConditions in Manila Province, as distinguished from Manila City,\r\nleft much to be desired.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey made a statement applicable to the territory adjacent\r\nto the city and bay of Manila in a cablegram to Washington dated\r\nOctober 14, 1898, which reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is important that the disposition of the Philippine\r\n    Islands should be decided as soon as possible. . . . General\r\n    anarchy prevails without the limits of the city and bay of\r\n    Manila. Natives appear unable to govern.\" [303]\r\n\r\nOf it Blount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In this cablegram the Admiral most unfortunately repeated\r\n    as true some wild rumours then currently accepted by the\r\n    Europeans and Americans at Manila which, of course, were\r\n    impossible of verification. I say 'unfortunately' with some\r\n    earnestness, because it does not appear on the face of his\r\n    message that they were mere rumours. And, that they were wholly\r\n    erroneous, in point of fact, has already been cleared up in\r\n    previous chapters, wherein the real state of peace, order,\r\n    and tranquillity which prevailed throughout Luzón at that\r\n    time has been, it is believed, put beyond all doubt.\" [304]\r\n\r\nBlount seems here to have overlooked the fact that the admiral\r\nhimself was in Manila Bay and in Manila City at the time he sent\r\nthis cablegram. The statements in question were not rumours, they\r\nwere deliberate expressions of opinion on the part of a man who had\r\nfirst-hand information and knew what he was saying.\r\n\r\nThey were not the Admiral's only allegations on this subject. When\r\ntestifying before the Senate committee he said:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Admiral Dewey_. I knew that there was no government in the\r\n    whole of the Philippines. Our fleet had destroyed the only\r\n    government there was, and there was no other government; there\r\n    was a reign of terror throughout the Philippines, looting,\r\n    robbing, murdering; a reign of terror throughout the islands.\"\r\n\r\n_La Laguna_\r\n\r\nHaving brought our tourist friends safely back to Manila, we must\r\nnow leave them there and strike out by ourselves if we are to see\r\nother provinces.\r\n\r\nLa Laguna lies just east of Manila. Of it we learn that:\r\n\r\n    \"Laguna Province was so overrun by bands of robbers that\r\n    the head of the pueblo of San Pablo ordered the people to\r\n    concentrate in the town to avoid their attacks.\" [305]\r\n\r\n_Bataan_\r\n\r\nThe province of Bataan lies just across the bay from Manila.\r\n\r\n    \"On January 10, 1899, the secretary of the interior directed\r\n    the governor of Bataan Province to ascertain the whereabouts of\r\n    a number of men who had just deserted with their rifles from\r\n    the commands there. He was to appeal to their patriotism and\r\n    tell them that if they would but return to their companies\r\n    their complaints would be attended to and they would be\r\n    pardoned.\" [306]\r\n\r\n_Zambales_\r\n\r\nZambales joins Bataan on the west and north. On November 13, 1898,\r\nWenceslao Vinvegra wrote to Aguinaldo describing the state of affairs\r\nin this province. From his letter we learn that two brothers named\r\nTeodoro and Doroteo Pansacula, claiming to be governor and brigadier\r\ngeneral respectively, who are charged with abandonment of their\r\nposts in the field, disobedience and attempts against the union\r\nof the Insurgents, had been committing all manner of abuses. They\r\nhad organized a band of cut-throats, armed with rifles and bolos,\r\nand were terrorizing the towns, committing robberies and murders and\r\nordering that money be furnished for themselves and food for their men.\r\n\r\nThey were also encouraging the people to disobey the local authorities\r\nand refuse to pay taxes, and were promulgating a theory, popular with\r\nthe masses, that the time had come for the rich to be poor and the\r\npoor rich.\r\n\r\nThey had furthermore induced regular Insurgent troops to rise up in\r\narms. [307]\r\n\r\nFrom this communication it would appear that the Insurgent government\r\nhad not been entirely effective in Zambales up to November 13th, 1898.\r\n\r\nFrom other communications we learn that the soldiers at Alaminos were\r\nabout to desert on November 30th, 1898; [308] that it was deemed\r\nnecessary to restrict travel between Tarlac, Pampanga, Bataan and\r\nZambales in order to prevent robberies; [309] and that on January 9,\r\n1899, the governor of the province found it impossible to continue\r\nthe inspection of a number of towns, as many of their officials had\r\nfled to escape the abuses of the military. [310] Conditions were\r\nobviously very serious in Zambales at this time.\r\n\r\n_Cavite_\r\n\r\nCavite province lies immediately south of Manila province as the\r\nlatter was then constituted. On August 24, 1898, the secretary of\r\nwar wired Aguinaldo that two drunken Americans had been killed by\r\nInsurgent soldiers. [311] On the same day General Anderson advised\r\nthe governor of Cavite that one American soldier had been killed and\r\nthree wounded by his people, and demanded his immediate withdrawal,\r\nwith his guard, from the town. [312]  The governor asked Aguinaldo for\r\ninstructions. Aguinaldo replied instructing the governor to deny that\r\nthe American had been killed by Insurgent soldiers and to claim that\r\nhe had met death at the hands of his own companions. The governor was\r\nfurther directed to give up his life before leaving the place. [313]\r\n\r\nIn view of the definite statement from one of his own officers that\r\nthe soldier in question was killed by Filipino soldiers, Aguinaldo's\r\ninstructions to say that he was killed by Americans are interesting\r\nas showing his methods.\r\n\r\nNot only were the Insurgents obviously unable to control their own\r\nsoldiers in Cavite town sufficiently to prevent them from committing\r\nmurder, but conditions in the province of the same name left much to\r\nbe desired. On December 29, 1898, the governor wired Aguinaldo that\r\nthe town of Marigondong had risen in arms. [314]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that land records were destroyed in Cavite. Of\r\nthis matter Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In Cavite, in Cavite Province, and probably in most of the\r\n    other provinces, one of the first acts of the insurgents\r\n    who gathered about Aguinaldo was to destroy all the land\r\n    titles which had been recorded and filed in the Spanish\r\n    administrative bureaus. In case the independence of the\r\n    Philippines was won, the land of the friars, the land of the\r\n    Spaniards and of those who still stood by Spain, would be in\r\n    the gift of Aguinaldo or of any strong man who could impose\r\n    his will upon the people. And the men who joined this leader\r\n    would be rich in the chief riches of the country, and those\r\n    who refused to do so would be ruined men.\" [315]\r\n\r\n_Sorsogón_\r\n\r\n    \"The native civil officials who took charge of the government\r\n    of Sorsogón Province when the Spaniards abandoned it did\r\n    not think it worth while to hoist the insurgent flag until a\r\n    force of four companies arrived there to take station early in\r\n    November, 1898. The officer in command promptly ordered the\r\n    Chinamen in the town of Sorsogón, who are prosperous people,\r\n    to contribute to the support of his troops. They at once gave\r\n    him cloth for uniforms, provisions, and 10,000 pesos. This\r\n    was not sufficient, for on November 8 Gen. Ignacio Paua,\r\n    who seems to have been the insurgent agent in dealing with\r\n    the Chinese, complained that the troops in Sorsogón were\r\n    pillaging the Chinamen there. They had killed 13, wounded 19,\r\n    and ruined a number of others.\" [316]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1899, a correspondent wrote Aguinaldo that it was very\r\ndifficult to collect taxes as every one was taking what he could lay\r\nhis hands on. [317]\r\n\r\n_Ambos Camarines_\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 1898, Elias Angeles, a corporal of the _guardia\r\ncivil_, headed an uprising against the Spaniards. The Spanish officer\r\nin command, and all of his family, were killed by shooting up through\r\nthe floor of the room which they occupied. Angeles then assumed the\r\ntitle of Politico-Military-Governor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tagálog Vicente Lucban arrived on his way to Samar, he ordered\r\nAngeles to meet him at Magarao, with all his troops and arms, disarmed\r\nthe troops, giving their rifles to his own followers, marched into\r\nNueva Caceres and took possession of the entire government. Aguinaldo\r\nsubsequently made Lucban a general, and sent him on his way to Samar.\r\n\r\nLucban was succeeded by another Tagálog, \"General\" Guevara, a very\r\nignorant man, who displayed special ability in making collections,\r\nand is reported to have kept a large part of the funds which came\r\ninto his possession.\r\n\r\nColonel Peña, who called himself \"General,\" was one of the worst of\r\nthe Tagálog invaders, for they were practically that. He threatened\r\nall who opposed him with death, and summarily shot at least one man\r\nin Tigaon. That town subsequently rose against him, and he was badly\r\ncut up by the Bicols. [318] On getting out of the hospital he was\r\nsent away.\r\n\r\nThe daughters of prominent families suffered at the hands of these\r\nvillains. Peña abducted one, a son of Guevara another. Her brother\r\nfollowed young Guevara and killed him. If girls of the best families\r\nwere so treated, how must those of the common people have fared?\r\n\r\nBraganza ordered the killing of all Spaniards and Chinese at\r\nMinalabag. Some forty-eight Spaniards were murdered.\r\n\r\nMany Chinese were killed at Pasacao; about thirty at Libmanan by\r\norder of Vicente Ursua a Tagálog; more than twenty at Calabanga.\r\n\r\nConditions became so unbearable that Faustino Santa Ana gathered\r\naround him all Bicols who were willing to fight the Tag£logs, but\r\nthe troubles were finally patched up.\r\n\r\nAmerican troops had little difficulty in occupying Ambos Camarines\r\nand other Bicol provinces, owing to the hatred in which the Tagálogs\r\nwere held.\r\n\r\n_Mindoro_\r\n\r\nConditions in the important island of Mindoro may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that it became necessary for its governor to issue a decree\r\non November 10, 1898, which contained the following provisions among\r\nothers:--\r\n\r\n    \"2nd. The local presidentes of the pueblos will not permit any\r\n    one belonging to their jurisdiction to pass from one pueblo\r\n    to another nor to another province without the corresponding\r\n    pass, with a certificate upon its back that the taxes of its\r\n    holder have been paid.\r\n\r\n    \"3rd. That from this date no one will be allowed to absent\r\n    himself from his pueblo without previously informing its head\r\n    who will give him an authorization on which will be noted\r\n    the approval of the presidente of the pueblo....\r\n\r\n    \"5th. Persons arriving from a neighboring town or province in\r\n    any pueblo of this province will immediately present themselves\r\n    before the presidente of said pueblo with their passes. He\r\n    will without charge, stamp them with his official seal.\" [319]\r\n\r\nThese are peculiar regulations for a province which is at peace,\r\nand as Major Taylor has truly remarked:--\r\n\r\n    \"The form of liberty contemplated by the founders of the\r\n    Philippine Republic was not considered incompatible with a\r\n    very considerable absence of personal freedom.\" [320]\r\n\r\nLater, when travelling through Mindoro, I was told how an unfortunate\r\nlegless Spaniard, who had been running a small shop in one of the towns\r\nand who was on good terms with his Filipino neighbors, was carried\r\nout into the plaza, seated in a chair, and then cut to pieces with\r\nbolos in the presence of his wife and children who were compelled to\r\nwitness the horrible spectacle!\r\n\r\nOn this same trip Captain R.G. Offley, then the American Governor\r\nof Mindoro, told me while I was at Pinamalayan that the people there\r\nwere greatly alarmed because a murderer, liberated under the amnesty,\r\nhad returned and was prowling about in that vicinity. This man had a\r\nrather unique record. He had captured one of his enemies, and after\r\nstripping him completely had caused the top of an immense ant-hill to\r\nbe dug off. The unfortunate victim was then tied, laid on it, and the\r\nearth and ants which had been removed were shovelled back over his\r\nbody until only his head projected. The ants did the rest! Another\r\nrather unusual achievement of this interesting individual was to tie\r\nthe feet of one of his enemies to a tree, fasten a rope around his\r\nneck, hitch a carabao to the rope, and start up the carabao, thus\r\npulling off the head of his victim. Yet this man and others like\r\nhim were set at liberty under the amnesty proclamation, in spite of\r\nthe vigorous protests of the Philippine Commission, who thought that\r\nmurderers of this type ought to be hanged.\r\n\r\nAnd now I wish to discuss briefly an interesting and highly\r\ncharacteristic statement of Judge Blount. In referring to conditions\r\nin the Visayan Islands, he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Of course the Southern Islands were a little slower. But as\r\n    Luzón goes, so go the rest. The rest of the archipelago is\r\n    but the tail to the Luzón kite. Luzón contains 4,000,000 of\r\n    the 8,000,000 people out there, and Manila is to the Filipino\r\n    people what Paris is to the French and to France. Luzón is\r\n    about the size of Ohio, and the other six islands that really\r\n    matter, are in size mere little Connecticuts and Rhode Islands,\r\n    and in population mere Arizonas or New Mexicos.\" [321]\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is no exception to the general rule that the statements\r\nof this author will not bear analysis. One of the other six islands\r\nthat he says really matters is Samar. Its area is 5031 square\r\nmiles. The area of Rhode Island is 1250 square miles. The smallest of\r\nthe six islands named is Bohol, with an area of 1411 square miles. It\r\ncannot be called a little Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAs regards population, Arizona has 122,931. It is hardly proper to\r\ncall either Panay with a population of 743,646, Cebu with 592,247,\r\nNegros with 460,776, Leyte with 357,641, Bohol with 243,148 or even\r\nSamar with only 222,690, a mere Arizona, and New Mexico with 195,310\r\nis also a bit behind.\r\n\r\nLuzón really has an area of 40,969 square miles and a population\r\nof 3,798,507. [322] What Blount is pleased to call \"the tail to the\r\nLuzón kite,\" is made up as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Island       Area (Square Miles)   Population\r\n    Samar         5,031                  222,690\r\n    Negros        4,881                  460,776\r\n    Panay         4,611                  743,646\r\n    Leyte         2,722                  357,641\r\n    Cebu          1,762                  592,247\r\n    Bohol         1,411                  243,148\r\n    Totals       20,419                2,620,148\r\n\r\n\r\nEven so, the tail is a trifle long and heavy for the kite, but if we\r\nare going to compare Luzón with \"the Southern Islands,\" by which Blount\r\ncan presumably only mean the rest of the archipelago, why not really do\r\nit? The process involves nothing more complicated than the subtraction\r\nof its area and population from those of the archipelago as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Area (Square Miles)  Population\r\n    Philippines     115,026              7,635,426\r\n    Luzón            40,969              3,798,507\r\n    Difference       74,057              3,836,919\r\n\r\n\r\nPerforming this operation, we discover that the tail would fly away\r\nwith the kite, as Luzón has less than half of the total population\r\nand only a little more than a third of the total area.\r\n\r\nTo compare the area or the population of one large island with those of\r\nindividual small ones, in determining the relative importance of the\r\nformer in the country of which it makes up a part, is like comparing\r\nthe area and population of a great state with those of the individual\r\ncounties going to make up other states.\r\n\r\nBlount resorts to a similar questionable procedure in trying to show\r\nthe insignificance of Mindoro and Palawan. There are an island of\r\nMindoro and a province of Mindoro; an island of Palawan and a province\r\nof Palawan. In each case the province, which includes numerous small\r\nislands, as well as the large one from which it takes its name, is\r\nmuch larger and more populous than is the main island, and obviously\r\nit is the province with which we are concerned.\r\n\r\nEven if Blount wished to limit discussion to the Christian natives\r\ncommonly called Filipinos, his procedure is still wholly unfair. Of\r\nthese there are 3,575,001 in Luzón and 3,412,685 in the other\r\nislands. In other words, the Filipino population is almost equally\r\ndivided between the two regions.\r\n\r\nAs he would not have found it convenient to discuss the conditions\r\nwhich arose in Mindanao under Insurgent rule, he attempts to show\r\nthat no political importance attaches to them. In the passage above\r\nquoted he does not so much as mention either Mindoro or Palawan\r\n(Paragua). Elsewhere, however, he attempts to justify his action by\r\nmaking the following statements:--\r\n\r\n    \"The political or governmental problem being now reduced\r\n    from 3141 islands to eleven, the last three [323] of the nine\r\n    contained in the above table may also be eliminated as follows:\r\n    [324]--\r\n\r\n    \"Mindoro, the large island just south of the main bulk of\r\n    Luzón, pierced by the 121st meridian of longitude east of\r\n    Greenwich, is thick with densely wooded mountains and jungle\r\n    over a large part of its area, has a reputation of being\r\n    very unhealthy (malarious), is also very sparsely settled,\r\n    and does not now, nor has it ever, cut any figure politically\r\n    as a disturbing factor.\" [325]\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that the political problem involved in the\r\ngovernment of the important islands which Blount would thus leave\r\nout of consideration, is not solved by ignoring it, certain of his\r\nfurther statements cannot be allowed to go uncorrected.\r\n\r\nThe allegation that the island has never \"cut any figure politically\r\nas a disturbing factor\" is absurd. In the Spanish days its forests\r\nfurnished a safe refuge for evildoers who were from time to time\r\ndriven out of Cavite and Batangas. A large proportion of its\r\nFilipino inhabitants were criminals who not infrequently organized\r\nregular piratical expeditions and raided towns in Masbate, Romblon\r\nand Palawan. The people of the Cuyos and Calamianes groups lived\r\nin constant terror of the Mindoro pirates, and _tulisanes_, [326]\r\nwho paid them frequent visits. I myself have been at Calapan, the\r\ncapital of the province, when the Spanish officials did not dare to\r\ngo without armed escort as far as the outskirts of the town for fear\r\nof being captured and held for ransom. During considerable periods\r\nthey did not really pretend to exercise control over the criminal\r\nFilipinos inhabiting the west coast of the island. Conditions as\r\nto public order were worse in Mindoro than anywhere else in the\r\narchipelago north of Mindanao and Joló.\r\n\r\nNo less absurd are Blount's suggestions as to the general\r\nworthlessness of the island. There are high mountains in its\r\ninterior, and there are great stretches of the most fertile land in\r\nthe world along its coast. Its northern and eastern portions have\r\na very heavy and evenly distributed rainfall, and are admirably\r\nsuited to the growing of cocoanuts, hemp, cacao, rubber and similar\r\ntropical products. In this region rice flourishes wonderfully without\r\nirrigation. There was a time in the past when Mindoro was known as\r\n\"the granary of the Philippines.\" Later its population was decimated\r\nby constant Moro attacks, and cattle disease destroyed its draft\r\nanimals, with the result that the cultivated lands were abandoned\r\nto a considerable extent and again grew up to jungle, from which,\r\nhowever, it is easy to redeem them. The west coast has strongly marked\r\nwet and dry seasons similar to those at Manila. There is abundant\r\nwater available for irrigation, furnished by streams which never run\r\ndry. Much of the soil is rich, and will grow the best of sugar in\r\nlarge quantity. The forests, which now cover extensive areas, abound\r\nin fine woods, and produce rubber and other valuable gums. There are\r\noutcroppings of lignite at numerous points on the island, and in the\r\nvicinity of Mt. Halcon is found the finest marble yet discovered in\r\nthis part of the world. Gold is also present in some quantity at\r\nvarious places. In short, Mindoro is naturally one of the richest\r\nislands in the Archipelago. If its tillable lands were under high\r\ncultivation, it would support half the population of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n_Palawan_\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to show that Palawan is without political importance\r\nBlount has followed precisely the procedure which he adopted in the\r\ncase of Mindoro. First, he gives the area and the population of the\r\nisland, when he should concern himself with the province. The area of\r\nthe island is 4027 square miles; that of the province, 5238 square\r\nmiles. According to the 1903 census, the population of the island\r\nwas 10,918, while that of the province, which contains such thickly\r\nsettled and fertile islands as Cuyo and Agutaya, was 39,582. Of course,\r\nif one wishes to emphasize the unimportance of Palawan, it is more\r\nconvenient to take the figures for the island.\r\n\r\nBlount says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Paragua, [327] the long narrow island seen at the\r\n    extreme lower left of any map of the archipelago, extending\r\n    northeast-southwest at an angle of about 45°, is practically\r\n    worthless, being fit for nothing much except a penal colony,\r\n    for which purpose it is in fact now used.\" [328]\r\n\r\nI must deny the truthfulness of his statements, even if we limit\r\nour consideration to the island of Palawan. Only 159 of its 4027\r\nsquare miles are utilized for a penal colony. Its natural wealth\r\nis simply enormous. It is covered throughout the greater part of\r\nits extent with virgin forest containing magnificent stands of the\r\nbest timber. Damar, a very valuable varnish gum, is abundant in its\r\nmountains. Much of the so-called \"Singapore cane,\" so highly prized by\r\nmakers of rattan and wicker furniture, comes from its west coast. It\r\nis a well-watered island, and its level plains, which receive the\r\nwash from its heavily forested mountains, have a soil of unsurpassed\r\nfertility in which cocoanuts come to bearing in five years or even\r\nless. Incidentally, the greater part of the island lies south of\r\nthe typhoon belt. Malampaya Sound, situated near its northwestern\r\nextremity, is one of the world's great harbors. But should we wish to\r\nrid ourselves of this wonderful island, I may say, without violating\r\nany official confidences, that there was a time when Germany would\r\nhave been more than pleased to take it off our hands; and indeed our\r\nBritish friends, who were sufficiently interested in it to survey it\r\nsome decades ago, might possibly be prevailed upon to accept it!\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons why Blount thought it convenient to make it\r\nappear that Palawan was politically unimportant. Shortly after the\r\noutbreak of hostilities with Spain the Filipino garrison at Puerto\r\nPrincesa mutinied, and the things which they did were not nice. Among\r\nothers, they liberated the convicts, Puerto Princesa being at the time\r\na penal colony, and the latter, together with some of the soldiers,\r\nstarted up the east coast of the island, leaving a trail of devastation\r\nin their wake. The prosperous town of Tinitian was abandoned as they\r\napproached it, and was so thoroughly cleaned out by them that it has\r\nnever since been reoccupied except by a few stragglers. Other towns,\r\nincluding Tay-Tay, were raided.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 1899, Aguinaldo's representative in this province wrote\r\nhim that the inhabitants were preparing to kill all the Tagálogs and\r\nrevolt against Insurgent rule. [329] Later when some of the latter\r\nwere anxious to get the people of one of the northern settlements to\r\ntake them on a short boat journey, these Visayans consented to give\r\nthem a lift only on condition that they first allow themselves to be\r\nbound, and then took them out to sea and threw them overboard.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which Blount would have found it inconvenient to discuss\r\nis the conduct of the people of Cuyo, at one time the capital of\r\nthe province. On this island, which contains but twenty-one square\r\nmiles, there were in 1903 no less than 7545 inhabitants. They hated\r\nand feared the people of Mindoro and sent messengers to Iloilo,\r\nafter the Americans had occupied that place, to beg for a garrison of\r\nAmerican troops, and to say that if furnished with an American flag\r\nthey themselves would defend it. For some reason they were not given\r\nthe flag, and the sending of a garrison was long delayed. Having grown\r\nweary of waiting, they made an American flag of their own, hoisted\r\nit, and when the Insurgents from Mindoro came intrenched themselves\r\nand defended it. They were actually being besieged when the American\r\ngarrison finally arrived. Here is one more fact inconsistent with\r\nthe theory that the Filipino people were a unit at Aguinaldo's back,\r\nand of course the easiest way to get around such an occurrence is to\r\nforget to mention it!\r\n\r\n_Mindanao_\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the great island of Mindanao, which all but equals\r\nLuzón in size, having an area of 36,292 square miles as against the\r\n40,969 of Luzón. Blount's first mention of it is peculiar.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the words \"the other six islands that really\r\nmatter,\" in the passage above cited on page 116 of his book, he has\r\ninserted a foot-note reading as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The six main Visayan Islands. Mohammedan Mindanao is\r\n    always dealt with in this book as a separate and distinct\r\n    problem.\" [330]\r\n\r\nBut it was hardly possible for him to dismiss this great island, which\r\nis a little continent by itself, quite so cavalierly and I will quote\r\nthe more important of his further and later statements regarding it:--\r\n\r\n    \"While the great Mohammedan island of Mindanao, near Borneo,\r\n    with its 36,000 square miles of area, requires that the\r\n    Philippine archipelago be described as stretching over more\r\n    than one thousand miles from north to south, still, inasmuch\r\n    as Mindanao only contains about 500,000 people all told, half\r\n    of them semi-civilized, the governmental problem it presents\r\n    has no more to do with the main problem of whether, if ever,\r\n    we are to grant independence to the 7,000,000 Christians of\r\n    the other islands, than the questions that have to be passed\r\n    on by our Commissioner of Indian Affairs have to do with the\r\n    tariff. Mindanao's 36,000 square miles constitute nearly\r\n    a third of the total area of the Philippine archipelago,\r\n    and more than that fraction of the 97,500 square miles of\r\n    territory to a consideration of which our attention is reduced\r\n    by the process of elimination above indicated. Turning over\r\n    Mindanao to those crudely Mohammedan semi-civilized Moros\r\n    would indeed be 'like granting self-government to an Apache\r\n    reservation under some local chief,' as Mr. Roosevelt, in\r\n    the campaign of 1900, ignorantly declared it would be to\r\n    grant self-government to Luzón under Aguinaldo. Furthermore,\r\n    the Moros, so far as they can think, would prefer to owe\r\n    allegiance to, and be entitled to recognition as subjects\r\n    of, some great nation. Again, because the Filipinos have no\r\n    moral right to control the Moros, and could not if they would,\r\n    the latter being fierce fighters and bitterly opposed to the\r\n    thought of possible ultimate domination by the Filipinos, the\r\n    most uncompromising advocate of the consent of the governed\r\n    principles has not a leg to stand on with regard to Mohammedan\r\n    Mindanao. Hence I affirm that as to it, we have a distinct\r\n    separate problem, which cannot be solved in the lifetime\r\n    of anybody now living. But it is a problem which need not\r\n    in the least delay the advent of independence for the other\r\n    fourteen fifteenths of the inhabitants of the archipelago--all\r\n    Christians living on islands north of Mindanao. It is true that\r\n    there are some Christian Filipinos on Mindanao, but in policing\r\n    the Moros, our government would of course protect them from\r\n    the Moros. If they did not like our government, they could\r\n    move to such parts of the islands as we might permit to be\r\n    incorporated in an ultimate Philippine republic. Inasmuch as\r\n    the 300,000 or so Moros of the Mohammedan island of Mindanao\r\n    and the adjacent islets called Jolo (the 'Sulu archipelago,'\r\n    so called, 'reigned over' by the sultan of comic opera fame)\r\n    originally presented, as they will always present, a distinct\r\n    and separate problem, and never did have anything more to\r\n    do with the Philippine insurrection against us than their\r\n    cousins and co-religionists over in near-by Borneo, the task\r\n    which confronted Mr. Root in the fall of 1899, to wit, the\r\n    suppression of the Philippine insurrection, meant practically\r\n    the subjugation of one big island, Luzón, containing half the\r\n    population and one third of the total area of the archipelago,\r\n    and six neighbouring small ones, the Visayan Islands.\" [331]\r\n\r\nNow as a matter of fact Mindanao is by no means Mohammedan. The\r\nMohammedan Malays, called Moros, are found here and there along the\r\nwestern coast of the Zamboanga peninsula and along the southern coast\r\nof the island as far as Davao. They also extend far up the Cotabato\r\nRiver and occupy the Lake Lanao region, but that is all. The interior\r\nof the island is for the most part occupied by the members of a\r\nnumber of non-Christian, non-Mohammedan tribes, while its northern\r\nand eastern coasts are inhabited by Visayan Filipinos, of whom there\r\nare many in Zamboanga itself.\r\n\r\nWhile, as Blount says, the Moros took no part in the insurrection\r\nagainst the United States, the Visayans of Mindanao did, and we had\r\nsome lively tussles with them in Misamis and in Surigao.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed unthinkable that we should turn Mindanao over to the\r\nMoros. Abandonment of it by us would in the end result in this,\r\nas they would take possession of the entire island in the course of\r\ntime. Neither the other wild tribes nor the Filipinos could stand\r\nagainst them. I heartily agree with the conclusion that we must retain\r\nthis island for many years before we can settle the problems which it\r\npresents. It is further true that we might retain it and still grant\r\nindependence to the remainder of the Philippine Archipelago, but if\r\nwe are to eliminate Mindanao from consideration because the Filipinos\r\nhave no right to control the Moros, of whom there are in reality\r\nonly about a hundred and fifty-four thousand [332] on the island,\r\nand could not if they would, what about Luzón, where there are in\r\nreality no less than four hundred and sixty thousand non-Christians,\r\n[333] many of whom, like the Ifugaos, Bontoc Igorots, Kalingas and\r\nwild Tingians, are fierce fighters and practically all of whom are\r\nbitterly opposed to the thought of possible ultimate domination by\r\nFilipinos, while most of them welcome American rule?\r\n\r\nHave the Filipinos any more moral right to control them than they\r\nhave to control the Moros? Could they control them if they would? And\r\nhas the most uncompromising advocate of the consent of the governed\r\nprinciple \"a leg to stand on\" in the one case if he lacks it in\r\nthe other?\r\n\r\nThe Filipino politicians are not ready to admit that Filipinos could\r\nnot satisfactorily govern Moros and have even alleged that they did\r\nso govern them during the period now under discussion. Let us examine\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo attempted to enter into negotiations with the Sultan of Joló,\r\naddressing him as his \"great and powerful brother,\" [334] but this\r\nbrother does not seem to have received his advances with enthusiasm,\r\nand the other brothers proceeded to do things to the Filipinos at\r\nthe first opportunity.\r\n\r\nJosé Roa in writing Aguinaldo on January 26, 1899, of conditions in\r\nthe province of Misamis says: [335]--\r\n\r\n    \"Hardly had said evacuation of Iligan taken place on the 28th\r\n    of last month, when the Moros or Mohammedans of the interior,\r\n    our mortal enemies since times immemorial on account of their\r\n    religious fanaticism which they carry to extremes, as do their\r\n    co-religionists in Europe and Asia, and on account of their\r\n    objection to leading a civilized life, began to harry the\r\n    town of Iligan which is the nearest town to the lake around\r\n    which is the densest Moro population. Due to the prestige\r\n    of the local president of that town, Señor Carloto Sariol,\r\n    and the energy that he showed, after some days of constant\r\n    firing against groups who descended upon the suburbs of the\r\n    town, he was successful in having them abandon their hostile\r\n    attitude and promise to live in peace and harmony with said\r\n    towns, this verbal agreement being participated in by the\r\n    Dattos of some settlements who did not wish to treat with\r\n    the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    \"Being acquainted nevertheless with these people, we know by\r\n    experience that the more friendly they appear, the more we\r\n    must watch against them, because as soon as they find a good\r\n    opportunity they do not fail to take advantage of it to enter\r\n    the towns for the purpose of sacking them and kidnapping as\r\n    many of their inhabitants as possible in order to reduce them\r\n    to slavery.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the abandonment of Cotabato by the Spaniards the\r\nFilipino residents set up a government there. A few days later the Moro\r\ndatos, Piang, Ali and Djimbangan, dropped in with their followers,\r\ncut off the head of the Filipino _presidente_, served a few other\r\nleading officials and citizens in the same manner, and proceeded to\r\nset up a government of their own which was the only government that\r\nthe place had prior to the arrival of the American troops.\r\n\r\nDato Djimbangan promptly caused the Filipina women of the place to\r\nbe stripped and compelled to march before him on the public plaza in\r\na state of nudity.\r\n\r\nAt Zamboanga the Moros could have taken the town at any time after\r\nthe Spaniards left had they desired to do so. On the arrival of the\r\nAmericans Dato Mandi offered to take it and turn it over to them,\r\nbut his proposition was declined.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently swore to an affidavit relative to conditions under\r\nInsurgent rule. It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"We always had peace in Zamboanga District; except during the\r\n    revolution of the Filipinos in the year 1899, when for seven\r\n    or eight months there was in existence the so-called Filipino\r\n    Republic. During that time there was much robbing and killing;\r\n    the life of a man was worth no more than that of a chicken;\r\n    men killed one another for personal gain; enemies fought one\r\n    another with the bolo instead of settling their differences\r\n    before the law. It was a time of bloodshed and terror. There\r\n    was no justice. Because of this the Moros were opposed to\r\n    the Filipinos. There was conflict between the better class\r\n    of Filipinos and the revolutionists, who had gained control\r\n    of the local government.\" [336]\r\n\r\nElsewhere throughout the Moro territory those Filipinos who did\r\nnot promptly make their escape were murdered or enslaved. In short,\r\nthe lion and the lamb lay down together, with the lamb inside as usual.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that this first and last attempt of Filipinos\r\nto govern Moros did not result in complete success.\r\n\r\nBaldomero Aguinaldo made a subsequent attempt to open communication\r\nwith the Sultan of Joló, authorizing him to establish in all the\r\n_rancherias_ of Mindanao and Joló a government in accordance with a\r\ndecree duly transmitted. The Sultan was requested to report the result\r\nof his efforts and to give the number of his forces with their arms,\r\nand was advised that, \"if in this war, which I consider to be the last,\r\nwe secure our independence and with the opposition of our brothers\r\nin that region, with yourself at their head, we are successful in\r\npreventing the enemy from gaining a foothold, the grateful country will\r\nalways render a tribute of homage and gratitude to your memory.\" [337]\r\nCuriously, the Sultan seems to have remained unmoved by the appeal.\r\n\r\n_Masbate_\r\n\r\nThis tight little island of 1236 square miles had in 1903 a Visayan\r\npopulation of 29,451. Its people are all Filipinos, and are on the\r\nwhole rather an unusually orderly and worthy set. There is no reason\r\nwhy it should have been excluded in considering \"the human problem\r\nin its broader governmental aspect,\" whatever that may be, nor can I\r\nunderstand why Blount should have desired to exclude it except that\r\nhe seems to have been endeavouring to exclude everything possible\r\noutside of Luzón, in order to increase the apparent importance of\r\nthe Christian provinces of that island. Masbate should of course be\r\ntaken into account in connection with the Visayan Islands, of which\r\nit is one.\r\n\r\nThe islands ordinarily included in the group known as \"The Visayas\"\r\nfrom the ancient tribal name of the civilized Filipino people who\r\ninhabit them, who are called Visayans, are Samar, Panay, Negros,\r\nLeyte, Cebú, Bohol, Masbate, Tablas, Romblon, Ticao, Burias, Siquijor\r\nand numerous smaller islands adjacent to those named. Although their\r\ninhabitants are all rated as one people, they speak a number of more or\r\nless distinct dialects. Only Panay, Negros, Samar, Tablas and Sibuyan\r\nhave non-Christian inhabitants, and in the three islands last named\r\ntheir number is so small as to be negligible. In the mountains of Panay\r\nand Negros, however, Negritos are to be found in considerable numbers,\r\nas are the representatives of a tribe sometimes called _Monteses_ [338]\r\nand sometimes Bukidnon. The latter tribal designation I have thought\r\nit best to reserve for certain inhabitants of northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nIn the Visayas, Palawan and Mindanao the government of Aguinaldo\r\nwas established at various places and different times, without\r\nconsulting or considering the will of the people. The men who went as\r\nhis delegates were supported by armed forces, hence their authority\r\nwas not at first questioned, but soon there arose murmurings which\r\nmight easily have grown into a war cry.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Visayan Filipinos is clearly foreshadowed in the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter dated January 14, 1899, in which Mabini\r\ndiscussed the advisability of putting the constitution in force:--\r\n\r\n    \"And even if this change is made, I fear that Negros and Iloílo\r\n    will form a federal Republic and not one in conformity with the\r\n    centralized Republic provided for by the Constitution.\" [339]\r\n\r\nThe action later taken by Negros shows that there was abundant reason\r\nfor this fear.\r\n\r\nAs late as February 26, 1899, the Insurgent government was still\r\nignorant as to the real conditions in Negros and Mindanao. [340]\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written on March 18, 1899, to Apacible at Hongkong, we\r\nlearn that Aguinaldo and his followers were even then still uninformed\r\nas to events in the Visayan Islands. [341] In view of these facts,\r\nhow ridiculous become the contentions of those who claim that the\r\nMalolos government represented the archipelago as a whole. And what\r\nshall we say of the following statement, remembering that the Treaty\r\nof Paris was signed December 10, 1899?\r\n\r\n    \"When the Treaty of Paris was signed, General Otis was in\r\n    possession of Cavite and Manila, with less than twenty thousand\r\n    men under his command, and Aguinaldo was in possession of\r\n    practically all of the rest of the archipelago with between\r\n    35,000 and 40,000 men under his command, armed with guns,\r\n    and the whole Filipino population were in sympathy with the\r\n    army of their country.\" [342]\r\n\r\nUltimately, by one means or another, and chiefly by the use of armed\r\nemissaries, the Visayan Islands, with the exception of Negros, were\r\nbrought into the Insurgent fold.\r\n\r\nMabini's fear that Negros and Iloilo would form a federal republic\r\nwas not realized, but Negros set up its own government, applied to the\r\nlocal commander of the United States forces for help, endeavoured with\r\nalmost complete success to keep out Tagálog invaders, and presently\r\nsettled down contentedly under American rule, facts of which Blount\r\nmakes no mention. On the contrary, without just cause, he includes\r\nthis great island, with its 4881 square miles of territory and its\r\n560,776 inhabitants, in the area over which he claims that Aguinaldo\r\nexercised complete control.\r\n\r\nAt Iloilo the American troops encountered opposition when they planned\r\nto land. Negotiations had been entered into with the local Filipino\r\nofficers, but the latter, under the influence of representatives\r\nwhom Aguinaldo had sent from Luzón, announced themselves as adherents\r\nof his government, and when the American troops finally disembarked\r\nfired the town ahead of them. It has been claimed that in doing this\r\nthey were inspired by pure patriotism, but the facts shown by their\r\nown records present a very different picture.\r\n\r\nIn writing to Aguinaldo on April 8, 1899, Mabini says:\r\n\r\n    \"We have received a communication forwarded from Iloílo,\r\n    from General Martin Delgado and Francisco Soriano, your\r\n    commissioner. Soriano states that the troops of Diocno have\r\n    done nothing except commit excesses and steal money during\r\n    the attack by the Americans upon the town of Iloílo, even\r\n    going so far as to break their guns by using them as poles\r\n    to carry the stolen money which they took to Cápiz. It is\r\n    said that these forces, besides being unwilling to fight the\r\n    Americans, refuse to give their guns to those who do wish\r\n    to fight and do not want Cápiz to aid the people of Iloílo,\r\n    who are the ones who support the entire forces, including\r\n    the troops of Diocno who went there.\" [343]\r\n\r\nThis same letter contains the following brief reference to conditions\r\nin Cebu and Leyte:--\r\n\r\n    \"Also a native priest, Señor Pascual Reyes, has arrived\r\n    here from Cebú, and says that in Leyte General Lucban is\r\n    committing many abuses and that Colonel Mójica is only a\r\n    mere figurehead. In Cebú, he says, things are also in a\r\n    chaotic condition, because the military chief, Magsilum\r\n    [Maxilom,--TR.], and the people are not in harmony.\"\r\n\r\nFurther details as to conditions in Cebu are given in a letter to\r\nAguinaldo from the commissioner whom he put in charge of elections\r\nin that island, who on February 19, 1899, writes: [344]--\r\n\r\n    \"Having arrived in this province the 8th of last month, I\r\n    left on the 11th for the northern pueblos of this Island to\r\n    hold the elections for the offices ordered by the Superior\r\n    Decree of June 18, last.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"The news spread like an electric spark, as in all the pueblos\r\n    I visited later I found that almost all of the residents were\r\n    in their homes, so that when the elections were held in the\r\n    town hall, all the principal residents attended, requesting\r\n    me to inform you that they were disposed to sacrifice even\r\n    their dearest affections whenever necessary for our sacred\r\n    cause; they only asked me to inform those who hold the reins\r\n    of government at the present time in this province, that some\r\n    steps be taken to put a stop to the arbitrary acts which had\r\n    been and still are being committed by the so-called Captains,\r\n    Majors, Colonels, Generals and Captains General, who abusing\r\n    in the most barefaced manner the positions they claimed to\r\n    hold, were depriving them of their horses and their carabaos,\r\n    or cattle. I promised them that I would do this, as I do\r\n    now, by sending a communication at once to Sres. Flores and\r\n    Maxilom, who are at the head of the provincial government,\r\n    impressing upon them the fact that if they continue to grant\r\n    ranks and titles to persons of this character, as they have\r\n    done, it would end in the utter ruin of this wealthy province.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds that these men did not remedy the evils complained of. It\r\nwould be possible to cover in detail all of this and the remaining\r\nInsurgent territory, and to show that Judge Blount was quite right in\r\nstating that conditions similar to those encountered in Luzón arose\r\nthere, but the limitations of time and space forbid, and I must ask\r\nmy readers to accept on faith the statements of Blount and myself\r\nthat such was the case!\r\n\r\nTaylor thus summarizes the conditions which ultimately arose:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Insurgent soldiers lived in their own land as they would\r\n    have lived in a conquered country. They were quartered on the\r\n    towns and the towns had to feed them whether they would or not.\r\n\r\n    \"Peace there was where Aguinaldo's soldiers had not penetrated,\r\n    but there does not seem to have been progress. Life went very\r\n    well in a long siesta in the shady villages under the palm\r\n    trees, but not only the structure of the State, its very\r\n    foundations were falling apart. When Aguinaldo's soldiers\r\n    came they brought cruelty and license with them. Proud of\r\n    their victories and confident in themselves they felt that the\r\n    labourers in the fields, the merchants in the towns, were for\r\n    the purpose of administering to their necessities and their\r\n    desires. Aguinaldo, having seen this force gather about him,\r\n    was forced to entreat it, to appeal to it; he was never strong\r\n    enough to enforce discipline, even if he cared to do it.\"\r\n\r\nAguinaldo himself finally became disheartened over his inability to\r\nmaintain a decent state of public order in the territory which he\r\nclaimed to govern, and in December, 1898, tendered his resignation,\r\ngiving among other reasons odious favouritism on the part of some of\r\nthe military chiefs, together with a desire to enrich themselves by\r\nimproper means, such as accepting bribes, making prisoners a source\r\nof gain, and decreasing the allowance of the soldiers. He said that\r\nmany soldiers had received sums of money as their share of booty,\r\nand intimated that officers must have done the same. He made charges\r\nagainst civil as well as military officers and ended by saying that\r\nhe retained the evidence for presentation when called on. [345]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo was later persuaded to withdraw his resignation. No wonder\r\nthat he wished to tender it!\r\n\r\nIn referring to the report of Wilcox and Sargent, Blount has said:--\r\n\r\n    \"This report was submitted by them to Admiral Dewey under\r\n    date of November 23, 1898, and by him forwarded to the Navy\r\n    Department for its information, with the comment that it 'in\r\n    my opinion contains the most complete and reliable information\r\n    obtainable in regard to the present state of the northern part\r\n    of Luzon Island.' The Admiral's indorsement was not sent to\r\n    the Senate along with the report.\" [346]\r\n\r\nHe thus gives it to be understood that the admiral believed that the\r\nreport truthfully set forth the conditions which actually existed in\r\nthese provinces, and that his indorsement was suppressed. Not only was\r\nit true that this report when rendered contained the most complete\r\nand reliable information then available in regard to the existing\r\nstate of the northern part of Luzon Island, but it contained the only\r\nfirst-hand information available. The facts ultimately leaked out and\r\nled the admiral radically to change his opinion as to the conditions\r\nwhich arose under Insurgent rule. Of them he later said:--\r\n\r\n    \"There was a sort of a reign of terror; there was no\r\n    government. These people had got power for the first time\r\n    in their lives and they were riding roughshod over the\r\n    community. The acts of cruelty which were brought to my notice\r\n    were hardly credible. I sent word to Aguinaldo that he must\r\n    treat his prisoners kindly, and he said he would.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that I have fully demonstrated the truth of these\r\nstatements. Blount was thoroughly familiar with Dewey's testimony\r\nbefore the Senate Committee, in which they occur, but he did not\r\nmention them.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this discussion of Insurgent rule without quoting\r\nextracts from a remarkable document written by Isabelo Artacho\r\nin October, [347] 1899. It was entitled \"Declaration Letter and\r\nProclamation\" and was addressed to the Filipino people. While it is\r\nprobable that Artacho was impelled to tell the truth by his hatred for\r\nAguinaldo, tell the truth he did, and his rank and standing entitle\r\nhis statements to consideration:--\r\n\r\n    \"Study the work of the insurrection; see if it is, as is said,\r\n    the faithful interpretation of your wishes and desires.\r\n\r\n    \"Go through your towns, fields, and mountains. Wherever you\r\n    see an insurgent gun or bolo you will find girls and faithful\r\n    wives violated, parents and brothers crying for the murder of\r\n    a son or of a brother; honest families robbed and in misery;\r\n    villages burned and plundered for the benefit of a chief or\r\n    a General; you will see fresh and living signs yet of those\r\n    horrible crimes perpetrated with the greatest cynicism by\r\n    those who call themselves your liberators! Liberators because\r\n    they wear red pants, or a red shirt, or carry on their hats\r\n    a piece of red cloth or a triangular figure!\r\n\r\n    \"Here, a president stabs a man, perhaps the most honest of\r\n    the village, simply for having implored mercy for a creature\r\n    arbitrarily inflicted with the _cepo_ [an oblong square\r\n    piece of heavy wood divided into two parts, with a lock at\r\n    each end and six or more holes in the middle to confine the\r\n    feet of prisoners]; there, a dying man, suspended by the feet\r\n    in a _cepo_, raised from the level of the ground, by another\r\n    president who has charged him with an unproved crime; there a\r\n    poor woman falsely charged and driven by petty officers with\r\n    their bayonets for having objected to their invasion into\r\n    her house, or shop, they being supposed to be, each, Justice\r\n    itself, '_Justicia_,' and to be obeyed as images of the Gods;\r\n    there, generals who murder without fear, for an insignificant\r\n    motive, creatures whose members are being mutilated, or\r\n    their flesh cut in slices and afterwards roasted and given\r\n    them to eat; there, officers braining a girl who has refused\r\n    to accede to their sensual wishes, the lifeless body of the\r\n    victim, pierced with shots, after having been made use of, is\r\n    thrown into the river. It is not unusual to witness officers\r\n    burying people alive in a tomb prepared by the victim, by order\r\n    of the murderer; it is not unusual to see a _Puisne_-Judge\r\n    pointing a revolver at a man who is about to give evidence,\r\n    and threatening to brain him for having dared to ask: 'Why and\r\n    to whom am I to declare?' And finally, on his tottering throne,\r\n    you will see the Magistrate of the Philippines, so called by\r\n    his worshippers, with his mephistophelian smile, disposing\r\n    and directing the execution of a murder, of a plunder, of\r\n    a robbery, or the execution of some other crimes against\r\n    those who are indifferent or do not care to worship him,\r\n    such indifference being considered a crime.\r\n\r\n    \"Putting aside the many other murders, I may mention that\r\n    one recently committed on the person of the renowned and by\r\n    many called the worthy General, Antonio Luna, which took place\r\n    just at the entrance of the palace of the Republic Presidency,\r\n    and also the assassination at Kavite of the ever remembered\r\n    martyr, Andrés Bonifacio, the founder of the 'Katipúnan'\r\n    Society, and the one who initiated the Revolution of 1896;\r\n    against the memory of whom it has been committed, in the\r\n    proclamation of that falsely called Republic, the criminal\r\n    and unjust omission to render the smallest manifestation of\r\n    Filipinos' feelings towards him, to prevent that same might\r\n    dislike his murderers!\r\n\r\n    \"Study the ordinances and constitution of this so-called\r\n    democratic Government of the Republic, that grand work of the\r\n    wise Filipinos; admire with me that beautiful monument erected\r\n    on a sheet of paper and consecrated to the conquest of reason\r\n    and labour, especially in connection with human rights and\r\n    property, the basis for the well-being of social life; but,\r\n    lament and deplore with me its palpable nullity when brought\r\n    to practice and you will again see that the laws were made\r\n    for the people and not the people for the laws!\r\n\r\n    \"Under this republic called democratic it is a crime to\r\n    think, to wish, to say, anything which does not agree with\r\n    what the said Gods think, wish and say.

[348]\r\n\r\n    \"_Hongkong_, 1st October, 1899.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the men who perpetrated the outrages I have detailed are alive\r\nto-day, and are powers in their respective communities. Simeon Villa\r\nwas recently elected a member of the municipal board from the south\r\ndistrict of Manila, but fortunately an American governor-general\r\nprevented him from taking his seat. Just prior to my departure from\r\nManila he was appointed, by Speaker Osmeña, a member of a committee\r\non reception for Governor-General Harrison.\r\n\r\nThe kind of independent \"government\" these men established is the\r\nkind that they would again establish if they had the chance, [349]\r\nbut among the persons to be tortured and murdered would now be those\r\nAmericans who failed to escape seasonably. I do not mean to say\r\nthat such a state of affairs would come about immediately, but it\r\nwould certainly arise within a comparatively short time. Sooner yet\r\n\"the united Filipino people\" would split up on old tribal lines,\r\nand fly at each other's throats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDid We Destroy a Republic?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim has frequently been made that the United States government\r\ndestroyed a republic in the Philippine Islands, [350] but some of\r\nthe critics seem to entertain peculiar ideas as to what a republic\r\nis. Blount states [351] that Aguinaldo declined to hear our declaration\r\nof independence read \"because we would not recognize his right to\r\nassert the same truths,\" and then apparently forgetting the Insurgent\r\nchief's alleged adherence to the principles of this document, he\r\nlets the cat out of the bag by saying that \"the war satisfied us all\r\nthat Aguinaldo would have been a small edition of Porfirio Diaz,\"\r\nand would himself have been \"The Republic.\" [352]\r\n\r\nHe would doubtless have set up just this sort of a government, if\r\nnot assassinated too soon, but it would hardly have accorded with the\r\nprinciples of the declaration of independence, nor would it have been\r\nexactly \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people.\"\r\n\r\nBlount truly says [353] that the educated Filipinos, admittedly\r\nvery few in number, absolutely control the masses. He adds [354]\r\nthat _presidentes_ of pueblos are as absolute bosses as is Murphy\r\nin Tammany Hall, and that the towns taken collectively constitute\r\nthe provinces. The first statement is true, and the second, which\r\nis tantamount to a declaration that the _presidentes_ control every\r\nsquare foot of the provinces and every man in them, is not so far\r\nfrom the truth as it might be. I have been old-fashioned enough to\r\nretain the idea that a republic is \"a state in which the sovereign\r\npower resides in the whole body of the people, and is exercised by\r\nrepresentatives elected by them.\"\r\n\r\nBlount labored under no delusion as to the fitness of the common\r\npeople to govern. [355]\r\n\r\nNot only did the Filipinos themselves understand perfectly well that\r\nthey had no republic, but there were many of them who were fully\r\naware of the fact that they could establish none. Fernando Acevedo,\r\nin writing to General Pío del Pilar on August 8, 1898, said: [356]--\r\n\r\n    \"There could be no republic here, even though the Americans\r\n    should consent, because, according to the treaties, the\r\n    Filipinos are not in condition for a republic. Besides this,\r\n    all Europe will oppose it, and if it should be that they divide\r\n    our country as though it were a round cake, what would become\r\n    of us and what would belong to us?\"\r\n\r\nI will now trace the evolution of the government which Aguinaldo did\r\nset up. In doing so I follow Taylor's argument very closely, drawing\r\non his unpublished Ms., not only for ideas, but in some instances for\r\nthe words in which they are clothed. I change his words in many cases,\r\nand do not mean to unload on him any responsibility for my statements,\r\nbut do wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to him and at the same\r\ntime to avoid the necessity for the continual use of quotation marks.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's methods in establishing his republic are shown by his order\r\n[357] that \"any person who fights for his country has absolute power\r\nto kill any one not friendly to our cause\" and the further order\r\n[358] prescribing that twelve lashes should be given to a soldier\r\nwho lost even a single cartridge, while if he continued to waste\r\nammunition he should be severely punished. In March, 1899, workmen\r\nwho had abandoned their work in the arsenal at Malolos were arrested,\r\nreturned, given twenty-five lashes each and then ordered to work. [359]\r\n\r\nThe news that an American expedition was about to sail for the\r\nPhilippines made him realize that he had not much more than a month\r\nin which to place himself in a position in which he would have to be\r\nconsulted and assisted, and this he tried to do. The arms he received\r\nfrom Hongkong on May 23 enabled him to begin an insurrection, not\r\nas an ally of the United States, but on his own account. From May 21\r\nto May 24 he issued orders for the uprising against Spain. On May 24\r\nhe declared himself Dictator of the Philippines in a proclamation in\r\nwhich he promised to resign his power into the hands of a president\r\nand cabinet, to be appointed when a constitutional assembly was\r\nconvened, which would be as soon as the islands had passed into\r\nhis control. He further announced that the North American nation\r\nhad given its disinterested protection in order that the liberty of\r\nthe Philippines should be gained. [360] On May 25, 1898, the first\r\nAmerican troops sailed from San Francisco for the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo still had a month in which to seize enough Spanish territory\r\nto erect thereon what would appear to the Americans on their arrival to\r\nbe a government of Luzón, of which he was the head. The Hongkong junta\r\nand Aguinaldo himself intended to ask for the recognition of their\r\ngovernment, but they had first to create it. To obtain recognition\r\nit was necessary that the American commander on land should be able\r\nto report that wherever he or his troops had gone the country was\r\nruled by Aguinaldo according to laws which showed that the people\r\nwere capable of governing themselves.\r\n\r\nAs the United States is a republic it was natural that the directing\r\ngroup of insurgent leaders should decide upon a republican form of\r\ngovernment. That form would appeal to the people of the United States;\r\nthe first \"Christian Asiatic Republic\" was a description which would\r\ninevitably awaken sympathy in that mother of republics. The idea was a\r\nwise and subtle one; but Aguinaldo's republic was merely an elaborate\r\nstage-setting, arranged for the contemplation of the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBy June 5, 1898, the success of the insurgent arms had been such that\r\nAguinaldo felt that he could throw down the mask. He would still\r\nbe glad of American assistance, but he felt himself strong enough\r\nto do without it. He saw that \"there can now be proclaimed before\r\nthe Filipino people and the civilized nations its only aspiration,\r\nnamely, the independence of this country, which proclamation should\r\nnot be delayed for any ulterior object of this government\" [361] and\r\nordered that the independence of the Philippines should be proclaimed\r\nat his birthplace, Cavite Viejo, on June 12, 1898. On that date he\r\nformally proclaimed it. The provinces of Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga,\r\nBatangas, Bulacan, Laguna and Morong were about to fall into his hands,\r\nthe Spanish troops in them being besieged, and about to surrender.\r\n\r\nFrom the same place on June 18, 1898, Aguinaldo promulgated his decree\r\nfor the creation and administration of municipalities. [362] In brief,\r\nthis provided that as soon as the territory of the archipelago, or any\r\nportion thereof, had passed from the possession of Spanish forces, the\r\npeople in the towns who were most conspicuous for their intelligence,\r\nsocial position and upright conduct were to meet and elect a town\r\ngovernment. The heads of the towns in every province were to elect\r\na head for the province and his three counsellors. The provincial\r\ncouncil, composed of these four officials, with the presidente of the\r\ncapital of the province, were to see to the execution in that province\r\nof the decrees of the central government and to advise and suggest.\r\n\r\nThis provincial council was to elect representatives for the\r\nrevolutionary congress, which was to be charged with submitting\r\nsuggestions to the central government upon interior and exterior\r\naffairs, and was to be heard by the government upon serious matters\r\nwhich admitted of delay and discussion.\r\n\r\nBefore any person elected to office was permitted to discharge\r\nhis functions, his election was to be approved by the central\r\ngovernment. The military commanders, except in time of war, were\r\nto have no jurisdiction over the civil authorities. They could,\r\nhowever, demand such supplies as they might need, and these could\r\nnot be refused. The government was to appoint commissioners to carry\r\nthese regulations into effect.\r\n\r\nOn June 20 Aguinaldo issued his regulations for the government of\r\nprovinces and municipalities [363] as supplemental to the decree\r\nof two days before. It went into the details of government, under\r\nthe following heads: police, justice, taxation and registration\r\nof property.\r\n\r\nOn June 23 he proclaimed the establishment of a revolutionary\r\ngovernment, with himself as \"president.\" In this capacity he had all\r\nthe powers of the Spanish governor-general, unhampered by any orders\r\nfrom Spain. It is true that the scheme provided for the eventual\r\nformation of a republic, but it is doubtful if the people who drew it\r\nup really knew what that word meant. What was provided for in practice\r\nwas a strong and highly centralized military dictatorship, in which,\r\nunder the form of election, provision was made for the filling of\r\nall offices by men devoted to the group which had seized control.\r\n\r\nAccording to this decree the dictatorial government was in future to\r\nbe entitled the revolutionary government. Its duty was to struggle\r\nfor the independence of the Philippines in order to establish a\r\ntrue republic. The dictator was to be known as the president of the\r\nrevolutionary government. There were to be four secretaries--one of\r\nforeign affairs, commerce and marine; one of war and public works;\r\none of police and interior order, justice, education and hygiene;\r\none of the treasury, agriculture and manufactures. The government\r\ncould increase the number of secretaries if necessary. They were to\r\nassist the president in the despatch of business coming under their\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the president and his secretaries, there was to be a\r\nrevolutionary congress composed of representatives from the provinces\r\nof the Philippine Archipelago, elected as provided by the decree of\r\nJune 18. In case a province was not able to elect representatives,\r\nthe government would appoint them for such province. The congress\r\nwas to discuss and advise, to approve treaties and loans, and to\r\nexamine and approve the accounts of the secretary of the treasury. If\r\nimportant matters admitted of delay, the congress would be heard\r\nconcerning them; but if they did not admit of delay, the president of\r\nthe government was to act at once. Projects of law could be presented\r\nby any representative, and by the secretaries of the government.\r\n\r\nA permanent committee of congress presided over by the vice-president\r\nwas to be chosen by that body. This was to serve as a court of appeal\r\nin criminal cases and as a court of final jurisdiction in cases\r\narising between the secretaries of the government and provincial\r\nofficials. The acts of congress were not to go into effect until the\r\npresident of the government ordered their execution. He was also to\r\nhave the right of veto.\r\n\r\nThis was a well-devised plan to secure control for the central\r\ngroup about Aguinaldo. His commissioners, under a form of election\r\nin which the electors were carefully selected men, established\r\nmunicipal governments devoted to the cause of the revolution. These\r\nwere to choose provincial officials and members of the congress. All\r\nelections were subject to Aguinaldo's approval, and every province\r\nwas under the command of a military representative of his, who could\r\nand did call upon the civil authorities for such supplies as he deemed\r\nfit. All real power was vested in the central group, and the central\r\ngroup was composed of Emilio Aguinaldo and his public and private\r\nadvisers. By this time he had gathered about him men who were trained\r\nin the law, some of whom had served the Spanish government in various\r\ncapacities. They were accustomed to the methods that had previously\r\nprevailed under the Spanish régime, and were now ready to draw up\r\nconstitutions and regulations for the new government. Mabini wrote\r\nthe three organic decrees. Copies of them were sent to the foreign\r\nconsuls in Manila, and on July 15, 1898 to Admiral Dewey.\r\n\r\nAlthough the title of \"president\" was assumed by Aguinaldo, as\r\nmore likely to be favourably considered in the United States than\r\n\"dictator,\" the tendency of his followers who had not been educated\r\nin Europe was to speak of and to regard him not as a president,\r\nbut as an overlord holding all power in his hands. The people did\r\nnot feel themselves citizens of a republic, copartners in an estate;\r\nthey considered themselves subject to a ruler who sometimes called\r\nhimself president, and sometimes dictator. Indeed, there is much to\r\nshow that if Aguinaldo and his followers had succeeded in their plans,\r\neven the name \"republic\" would not have been long continued as the\r\ntitle of his government. [364]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's claim as to the effectiveness of his government on August\r\n6, 1898, was as follows: [365] \"The government of the revolution\r\nactually rules in the provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Mindoro,\r\nTayabas, Laguna, Morong, Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Infanta and\r\nbesieges the capital, Manila. The most perfect order and tranquillity\r\nreign in these provinces, governed by authorities elected by the\r\ninhabitants in conformity with the organic decrees dated June 18 and\r\n23 last. Moreover, the revolution has about nine thousand prisoners of\r\nwar who are treated humanely and according to the rules of civilized\r\nwarfare. We can muster more than thirty thousand men organized as a\r\nregular army.\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been that in the majority of these provinces municipal\r\ngovernments, formed in accordance with the provisions of the decree of\r\nJune 18, had been established; but provincial governments had not been\r\nestablished in all of them, and tranquillity did not reign in any of\r\nthem, as they were the scene of operations against the Spaniards. There\r\ncould not well have been nine thousand prisoners in his hands at this\r\ntime, as that was claimed later when a large additional number of\r\nSpaniards had surrendered. As for the thirty thousand men organized as\r\na regular army, there may be a certain difference of opinion as to what\r\nconstitutes a regular army; the men who saw Aguinaldo's force then,\r\nand who have read the papers of its leaders, must be of the opinion\r\nthat that force was not a regular army. Probably only Manila Province\r\nhad a provincial government on August 6. Its local presidentes met at\r\nCavite Viejo on August 3 and elected three members of congress from\r\nthe province, and also the members of the provincial government. The\r\nelection took place under the supervision of Colonel Teodoro Gonzales,\r\nwhom Aguinaldo had appointed governor of Manila Province on August\r\n1. He remained governor after the election was held. Not until August\r\n17 did the local presidentes of Bulacan assemble under the presidency\r\nof the secretary of the interior and proceed to elect two members to\r\ncongress and the members of the provincial government. Not until August\r\n20 was there an election for the members of the provincial government\r\nof Cavite Province. This was held in the town of Cavite. Isaac Fernando\r\nRios, who was afterwards a member of the Filipino junta in Madrid,\r\nwas chosen a representative of the province; but as he wrote that he\r\nwas in favour of coming to some agreement with Spain which would permit\r\nthe development of the Philippines, without abandoning the sovereignty\r\nof that country, Aguinaldo promptly disapproved his election [366]\r\nand ordered a new one held for the office thus left vacant. On October\r\n2, 1899, Aguinaldo approved the result of a new election held there\r\nbecause four of the five high officials of the province had absented\r\nthemselves, while one of them had died. Of the men who had so absented\r\nthemselves one had gone abroad, while the other three had remained\r\nin Manila or Cavite under the government of the United States. [367]\r\n\r\nThe people of the provinces obeyed the men who had arms in their\r\nhands. It is not probable that many of them had any conviction\r\nconcerning the form of government which would be best for the\r\nPhilippines. There were no signs of a spontaneous desire for a\r\nrepublic. Orders came from the group about Aguinaldo, and the people\r\naccepted a dictator and a republic as they accepted a president and\r\na republic, without knowing, and probably without caring very much,\r\nwhat it all meant, except that they hoped that taxes would cease with\r\nthe departure of the friars. A determined and well-organized minority\r\nhad succeeded in imposing its will upon an unorganized, heterogeneous,\r\nand leaderless majority.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a province was occupied by the Insurgents it was divided\r\ninto territorial zones within which command was exerted by military\r\nofficers. On July 20, 1898, Cavite had been divided into four zones,\r\nand next day Brigadier-General Artemio Ricarte was placed in command\r\nof the province and the first zone.\r\n\r\nBy July 7 Bulacan Province had been divided into six zones, and Nueva\r\nEcija into four zones, with a separate commander for each zone. These\r\nmen established the government prescribed by Aguinaldo's decrees of\r\nthe middle of June. Probably by the end of July Aguinaldo's municipal\r\ngovernments had been established in the greater part of the towns\r\nof Luzón. These governments were not established by the mass of the\r\npeople. The mass of the people were not consulted, but they were not\r\nin the habit of being consulted in such matters and probably saw no\r\nnecessity for it in this case. As an evidence of this we have the fact\r\nthat from the beginning the acts of election were almost always drawn\r\nup in Spanish, although by far the greater portion of the people of\r\nthe archipelago spoke only the native dialects.\r\n\r\nThe method of establishing these municipal governments employed in\r\nCavite in June, 1898, was continued to the end of Aguinaldo's rule. It\r\nwas the same in different places and at different times. Data obtained\r\nfrom reports and documents written in towns far removed from each\r\nother follow. They must be considered together in order to obtain an\r\nidea of what this method really was.\r\n\r\nWhen the Insurgent movement had progressed sufficiently far, the\r\nleaders collected their adherents and obtained recognition as the\r\nheads of their provinces or districts. For example, representatives\r\nof the towns of Pampanga assembled at San Fernando on June 26,\r\n1898, and under the presidency of General Maximo Hizon agreed to\r\nyield him \"complete obedience as military governor of the province\r\nand representative of the illustrious dictator of these Philippine\r\nIslands.\" [368] The town of Macabebe refused to send any delegates\r\nto this gathering. Commissioners, in almost every case officers of\r\nAguinaldo's army, were empowered by him to establish the so-called\r\nrepublican government. They appointed delegates who proceeded to\r\nthe smaller towns and held elections; but whenever possible the\r\ncommissioner of Aguinaldo presided. In many cases these delegates were\r\nlieutenants of the army. The commissioners selected the electors,\r\nfor they had all to be \"marked out by their good conduct, their\r\nwealth, and their social position,\" and they had all to be in favour\r\nof independence. They then presided at the elections, which were\r\n_viva voce_. They apparently selected the people to be elected, and\r\nforwarded a record of the proceedings to the central government. The\r\nelection had to be approved by the dictator or president before the\r\nsuccessful candidates could assume the duties of their offices. Later\r\non, the military commanders remote from the seat of government were\r\nauthorized to approve elections and install the successful candidates,\r\nbut the records of election had even then to be forwarded to the\r\ncapital for approval, the action of the commissioner not being final.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners do not seem to have been able to find many men\r\nwho had the necessary requisites for electors. In the town of Lipa,\r\nBatangas Province, with a population of forty thousand seven hundred\r\nforty-three, at the election held July 3, 1898, a presidente was chosen\r\nfor whom twenty-five votes were cast. On November 23, 1898, an election\r\nwas held at Vigan, Ilocos Sur, for a presidente to succeed one who had\r\nbeen elected representative in congress. One hundred and sixteen votes\r\nwere cast. The population of Vigan is nineteen thousand. On October 5,\r\n1898, at Echague, Isabela Province, a presidente was elected for whom\r\nfifty-four votes were cast. The population of Echague is fifty-four\r\nthousand. On October 2, 1898, at Cabagan Nuevo, Isabela, one hundred\r\nand eleven men voted out of a population of sixty-two hundred and\r\nforty. On January 29, 1899, the town of Hernani, in Samar, elected its\r\nmunicipal officials under the supervision of V. Lukban. Fifty-four men\r\nvoted. The town has a population of twenty-five hundred and fifty-five.\r\n\r\nThe elections, so-called, were not always held without protest. For\r\nexample, the town of San José, Batangas, protested unavailingly\r\nto Aguinaldo against the result of an election held at 10 P.M.,\r\nin a storm of rain. Men who had been on friendly terms with the\r\nSpaniards were usually excluded from all participation. If in spite\r\nof the precautions taken men were elected who were disliked by the\r\ncommissioner or his supporters, the election could be set aside on the\r\nground that the person elected was not an adherent of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe elections were often held in a singular manner, as in the following\r\ncase: [369]--\r\n\r\n    \"On August 20, 1898, four men of Tondo appeared\r\n    before Aguinaldo on Bacoor and announced that they were\r\n    representatives of the people of the district, who loved\r\n    liberty. Then in accordance with the directions of the\r\n    president of the republic under the supervision of the\r\n    secretary of the interior, they drew lots from a hat to\r\n    decide how the offices of the head of the district, delegate\r\n    of police, delegate of the treasury and delegate of justice\r\n    were to be distributed. The decision having been made in this\r\n    simple fashion, Aguinaldo gravely approved the election as\r\n    expressing the will of the people. Perhaps it did, for they\r\n    seem to have continued, at least for a time, to obey them. On\r\n    November 14, 1898, Aguinaldo again approved an election for\r\n    local officials in Tondo which since August 13 had been within\r\n    the American lines.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 23 San Carlos, in Pangasinán Province, a town of twenty-three\r\nthousand people, elected its officials under the new form of\r\ngovernment. The presidente chosen was a well-known member of the\r\nKatipúnan, and before the election was held announced his intention\r\nof killing any one who was chosen for the position for which he was a\r\ncandidate. [370] He was accordingly elected. In spite of this grave\r\ninformality, an informality which formed one ground for a protest\r\non the part of some of the people of the town, Aguinaldo approved\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1898, an election was held under the supervision of\r\nthe military commander in Camarines for the municipal officials of the\r\ntown of Yriga. [371] The voting was oral, and a secretary wrote down\r\nthe votes for the two candidates under direction of the commissioner,\r\nwho finally announced that the candidate whose friend he was had been\r\nelected, but without stating how many votes he had received. This\r\nnewly elected head of the town had the town crier on the following\r\nnight publish through the streets an address to the people, in which\r\nhe thanked those who had voted for him and warned those who had not\r\nthat it would be well for them to beware. The Spanish law known as\r\nthe Maura Law, which regulated the elections in the municipalities\r\nunder the Spanish government, provided for a limited electoral body,\r\ncomposed largely of ex-officials of the municipalities. The choosing of\r\nan electoral body by the military commander of a district probably did\r\nnot seem strange to the people. The provincial and municipal officials\r\nwere established in office by armed men, and they were obeyed because\r\nthey had been installed by armed men; but it was a form of election\r\nto which people, as a rule, saw no reason to object. There were,\r\nhowever, in many cases bitter complaints of the abuses committed by\r\nthe officers thus \"elected.\"\r\n\r\nThis form of government spread with the advance of Aguinaldo's\r\narms. Municipal elections were held in Tarlac in July, in Ilocos\r\nNorte and Tayabas in August, in Benguet and the Batanes Islands in\r\nSeptember, 1898, in Panay in December, 1898, and in Leyte and Samar\r\nin January, 1899.\r\n\r\nOn December 27 Antonio Luna wrote that all the provinces of Luzón,\r\nMindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, and Ticao, Romblón, part of Panay,\r\nthe Batanes, and Babuyanes Islands were under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe insurgent government. [372]\r\n\r\nBy October 7, 1898, 14 of the 36 provinces and districts into\r\nwhich Luzón had been divided by the Spanish government had civil\r\ngovernors. [373] These 14 were Tagálog provinces or provinces which\r\nthe Tagálogs controlled. The other provinces were still under military\r\nrule, and, indeed, even the provinces under civilians were dominated\r\nby their military commanders. With the manner of holding elections\r\nwhich prevailed, the governors must have been men who were in favour\r\nof the military party in force, for otherwise they would not have\r\nbeen elected. [374]\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the number of provinces under civil\r\ngovernors much increased. If in Pangasinán Province, where there\r\nare many Tagálogs, organizations opposed to the rule of Aguinaldo\r\ncould cause serious disorders, as was the case, it must have been\r\nconsidered expedient for the success of the attempt of the Tagálogs,\r\nwho form only a fifth of the population, to dominate the archipelago,\r\nthat all provinces in which an effective majority of the people were\r\nnot of that tribe, should be kept under military rule. The municipal\r\ngovernments which had been established in Luzón were in the hands of\r\nAguinaldo's adherents, or of men who it was hoped would prove loyal\r\nto him. They were men of the Spanish-speaking group, which has always\r\ndominated the people of the islands. They were probably not as a rule\r\nmen of means. Many of them,   perhaps most of them, had been clerks\r\nand employees under the Spanish government, and they saw no reason\r\nfor changing the methods of town administration which had then been\r\nfollowed. The municipal taxes, the estimates for expenditures, and\r\nthe regulations for town government, were but little modified from\r\nthose they found in force. In many ways such changes as were made\r\nwere for the worse.\r\n\r\nOnce installed in power, Aguinaldo's officials were required to\r\nexercise over the mass of the people about the same control that\r\nhad always been exercised over them. The governing group considered\r\nthat they were perfectly capable of providing for the welfare of\r\nthe islands, and that it was the duty of the people to obey them\r\nwithout question.\r\n\r\nWhen the insurgent force was increased in preparation for war with\r\nthe Americans a large number of municipal officials resigned, or\r\nattempted to do so. It was not easy for a municipal official under\r\nAguinaldo's government to resign. A resignation, to be accepted, had\r\nto be accompanied by the certificate of a physician that the person\r\nconcerned was unfit to perform the duties of his office. Judging by\r\nthe record, [375] an epidemic seems to have attacked the municipal\r\nofficials in January, 1899. It is probable that they saw that war\r\nwas inevitable and that they did not wish to remain in charge of\r\nthe towns and be responsible for providing for the necessities of\r\n\"the liberating army.\" In Pangasinán in that month men could not\r\nleave their barrios without obtaining the permission of the headman,\r\nand in one town men who had attempted to sell their property for the\r\npurpose of going to Manila were, on January 17, ordered to be arrested\r\nand their conduct investigated. [376]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo, having established himself at Malolos, ordered the congress\r\nprovided for in his decree of June 23, 1898, to  assemble at the\r\ncapital on September 15,1898, and appointed a number of provisional\r\nrepresentatives for provinces and islands not under his control. [377]\r\nIt has often been claimed that Aguinaldo's government controlled at\r\nthis time the whole archipelago, except the bay and city of Manila\r\nand the town of Cavite. [378]\r\n\r\nBlount quotes the following statement from the report of the First\r\nPhilippine Commission:--\r\n\r\n    \"While the Spanish troops now remained quietly in Manila,\r\n    the Filipino forces made themselves masters of the entire\r\n    island except that city.\" [379]\r\n\r\nI signed that statement, and signed it in good faith; nevertheless,\r\nit is untrue. The Filipino forces never controlled the territory\r\nnow known as Ifugao, Bontoc, Kalinga or Apayao, much less that\r\noccupied by the Negritos on the east coast of Luzón, but this is\r\nnot all. There exists among the  Insurgent records a very important\r\ndocument, prepared by Mabini, showing that when the call for the\r\nfirst session of the Filipino congress was issued, there were no less\r\nthan sixty-one provinces and _commandancias_, which the Insurgents,\r\nwhen talking among themselves, did not even claim to control, and\r\ntwenty-one of these were in or immediately adjacent to Luzón. [380]\r\n\r\nThe men who composed this congress were among the ablest natives of\r\nthe archipelago; but representative institutions mean nothing unless\r\nthey represent the people; if they do not, they are a conscious lie\r\ndevised either to deceive the people of the country or foreign nations,\r\nand it is not possible for any system founded upon a lie to endure. A\r\nreal republic must be founded not upon a few brilliant men to compose\r\nthe governing group but upon a people trained in self-restraint and\r\naccustomed to govern by compromise and concession, not by force. To\r\nendure it must be based upon a solid foundation of self-control, of\r\nself-respect and of respect for the rights of others upon the part of\r\nthe great majority of the common people. If it is not, the government\r\nwhich follows a period of tumult, confusion and civil war will be a\r\ngovernment of the sword. The record the Philippine republic has left\r\nbehind it contains nothing to confirm the belief that it would have\r\nendured, even in name, if the destinies of the islands had been left\r\nin the hands of the men who set it up.\r\n\r\nThe national assembly met on the appointed day in the parish church\r\nof Barasoain, Malolos, which had been set aside for the meetings\r\nof congress. This body probably had then more elected members than\r\nat its subsequent meetings, but even so it contained a large number\r\nof men who were appointed by Aguinaldo after consultation with his\r\ncouncil to represent provinces which they had never even seen.\r\n\r\nFrom a \"list of representatives of the provinces and districts,\r\nselected by election and appointment by the government up to July\r\n7, 1899, with incomplete list of October 6, 1899\" [381] I find\r\nthat there were 193 members, of whom forty-two were elected and one\r\nhundred fifty-one were appointed. This congress was therefore not an\r\nelective body. Was it in any sense representative? The following table,\r\nshowing the distribution of delegates between the several peoples,\r\nwill enable us to answer this question.\r\n\r\nIn considering this table it must be remembered that the relationship\r\ngiven between the number of delegates assigned to a given people\r\nand the number of individuals composing it is only approximate, as\r\nno one of these peoples is strictly limited to the provinces where\r\nit predominates.\r\n\r\nI have classified the provinces as Tagálog, Visayan, etc., according\r\nto census returns showing the people who form a majority of their\r\ninhabitants in each case. [382]\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople          Number          Elected Delegates   Appointed Delegates\r\nVisayans        3,219,030           0                   68\r\nTagálogs        1,460,695          18                   19\r\nIlocanos          803,942           7                   11\r\nBicols            566,365           4                    7\r\nPangasináns       343,686           2                    2\r\nPampangans        280,984           2                    2\r\nCagayans          159,648           4                    6\r\nZambalans          48,823           1                    2\r\nNon-Christians    647,740           4                   34\r\n                                   42                  151\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the Tagálog provinces had eighteen out of a\r\ntotal of forty-two elected delegates. The Visayans, by far the most\r\nnumerous people in the islands, did not have one. The non-Christian\r\nprovinces had a very disproportionately large total of delegates, of\r\nwhom four are put down as elected, but on examination we find that one\r\nof these is from Lepanto, the capital of which was an Ilocano town; one\r\nis from Nueva Vizcaya, where there is a considerable Cagayan-Ilocano\r\npopulation; one is from Benguet, the capital of which was an Ilocano\r\ntown, and one from Tiagan, which was an Iloeano settlement. These\r\ndelegates should therefore really be credited to the Ilocanos.\r\n\r\nIf the individual relationships of the several members are considered,\r\nthe result is even more striking. Of the thirty-eight delegates\r\nassigned to the non-Christian provinces, one only, good old Lino\r\nAbaya of Tiagan, was a non-Christian. Many of the non-Christian\r\n_comandancias_ were given a number of delegates wholly disproportionate\r\nto their population, and in this way the congress was stuffed full\r\nof Tagálogs.\r\n\r\nThink of Filipe Buencamino, of Aguinaldo's cabinet, representing the\r\nMoros of Zamboanga; of the mild, scholarly botanist Leon Guerrero\r\nrepresenting the Moros, Bagobos, Mandayas and Manobos of Davao; of\r\nJosé M. Lerma, the unscrupulous politician of the province of Bataan,\r\njust across the bay from Manila, representing the wild Moros of\r\nCotabato; of Juan Tuason, a timid Chinese _mestizo_ Manila business\r\nman, representing the Yacan and Samal Moros of Basilan; of my good\r\nfriend Benito Legarda, since a member of the Philippine Commission,\r\nand a resident delegate from the Philippines to the congress of the\r\nUnited States, representing the bloody Moros of Jolo! Yet they appear\r\nas representatives of these several regions.\r\n\r\nFew, indeed, of the delegates from non-Christian territory had ever\r\nset foot in the provinces or _comandancias_ from which they were\r\nappointed, or would have been able to so much as name the wild tribe\r\nor tribes inhabiting them.\r\n\r\nI have been furnished a list, made up with all possible care by\r\ncompetent persons, from which it appears that there were eighty-five\r\ndelegates actually present at the opening of congress, of whom\r\nfifty-nine were Tagálogs, five Bicols, three Pampangans, two Visayans,\r\nand one a Zambalan. For the others there are no data available. Yet\r\nit has been claimed that this was a representative body! It was a\r\nTagálog body, without enough representatives of any other one of the\r\nnumerous Philippine peoples to be worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nWith a congress thus organized, Aguinaldo should have had no difficulty\r\nin obtaining any legislation he desired.\r\n\r\nThe committee of congress appointed to draw up a constitution set\r\nto work promptly, and by October 16,1898, had proceeded so far\r\nwith their work that Buencamino was able to write to Aguinaldo that\r\nwhile he had been of the opinion that it would have been best for\r\nhim to continue as a dictator aided by a committee of able men,\r\nyet it would now be a blow to the prestige of congress to suspend\r\nits sessions. Aguinaldo noted upon this letter the fact that he did\r\nnot approve of a constitution. [383]\r\n\r\nApparently early in December the committee submitted their project. In\r\npresenting it to congress they said [384] that--\r\n\r\n    \"The work whose results the commission has the honour to\r\n    present for the consideration of congress has been largely a\r\n    matter of selection; in executing it not only has the French\r\n    constitution been used, but also those of Belgium, Mexico,\r\n    Brazil, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, as we have\r\n    considered those nations as most resembling the Filipino\r\n    people.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important difference between this project and the actual\r\nconstitution adopted was that, although the project provided that\r\nthe Dominican, Recollect, Franciscan and Augustinian friars should\r\nbe expelled from the country and that their estates should become\r\nthe property of the state, yet it recognized the Catholic religion\r\nas that of the state and forbade state contribution to the support\r\nof any other, although it permitted the practice in private of any\r\nreligion not opposed to morality, which did not threaten the safety of\r\nthe country. The government was authorized to negotiate a concordat\r\nwith the Pope for the regulation of the relations between church and\r\nstate. A strong party was in favour of this recognition, but it finally\r\nfailed of adoption, and the constitution as promulgated provided\r\nfor the freedom and equality of religion and for free and compulsory\r\neducation which had not been provided for in the original project. The\r\nconstitution as approved forbade the granting of titles of nobility,\r\ndecorations or honorary titles by the state to any Filipino. This\r\nparagraph did not exist in the original project, which merely forbade\r\nany Filipino to accept them without the consent of the government.\r\n\r\nMabini, the ablest of all Aguinaldo's advisers, did not approve of the\r\nconstitution. He himself had drawn up a project for a constitution\r\nduring June, 1898, but it was not accepted by the committee, the\r\ngreater part of whom were Catholics and for that reason opposed to\r\nMabini, who was a bitter antagonist of that church. And yet when\r\nseparation of church and state was finally provided for it did not\r\nplease Mabini, who, although he was opposed to church control, wrote\r\nto Aguinaldo [385] that the constitution as passed by congress was not\r\nacceptable and should not be promulgated because the constitutional\r\nguarantees of individual liberty could not be maintained, as the\r\narmy had to be in control for the time being, and furthermore it was\r\nnot expedient to separate church and state, as this separation would\r\nalienate many of their adherents. Indeed, there was not much in the\r\nconstitution which he thought ought to take immediate effect, [386]\r\nand he wrote that congress was ill-disposed toward him because he had\r\nrefused to agree to its promulgation. Existing conditions were such\r\nthat he believed that all powers should be vested in one person. He\r\nwarned Aguinaldo that if the constitution were put in force, he would\r\nbe at the mercy of his secretaries. On January 1, 1899, Aguinaldo,\r\nprobably at the suggestion of Mabini, proposed certain changes in\r\nit. [387]\r\n\r\nEvidently the provisions of the constitution did not worry Aguinaldo\r\nmuch, as is shown by his reply to the request by some of his officers\r\nfor information as to what reward those who were first in the attack\r\non Manila should receive. He promised them such titles as marquis,\r\nduke, etc. [388]\r\n\r\nOn January 2, 1899, Aguinaldo announced the formation of a new cabinet\r\nmade up as follows: Apolinario Mabini president and secretary of\r\nforeign affairs; Teodoro Sandico, secretary of the interior; Mariano\r\nTrias, secretary of the treasury; Baldomero Aguinaldo, secretary\r\nof war and navy, and Gracio Gonzaga, secretary of _fomento_. [389]\r\nOn January 4 Mabini took the oath of office as the president of the\r\ncouncil of government. This body met twice a week at Malolos on set\r\ndays, and at the close of its deliberations forwarded to Aguinaldo\r\na statement of the subjects discussed and the conclusions reached\r\nfor his decision. The president of the republic did not preside at,\r\nor take part in, its deliberations.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1899, General Otis issued a proclamation in which\r\nhe announced that the United States had obtained possession of the\r\nPhilippines and that its government would be extended over the islands\r\nof the archipelago. Aguinaldo replied next day with one which, if\r\nnot intended to be a declaration of war, was at least a warning that\r\nhostilities were imminent. This proclamation was carried into Manila\r\nby his emissaries and posted up over the one issued by the American\r\ncommander. It was a challenge to a trial of strength, and Aguinaldo\r\nand his advisers hastened their preparations for the coming combat.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the interior on the same day sent an order to the\r\nheads of all provinces directing the organization of territorial\r\nmilitia to resist the American invasion, and ordering the heads of the\r\ntowns to hold meetings of the people to protest against the aggression\r\nof the United States. They were held in accordance with these orders,\r\nand records of the proceedings were sent to Malolos and published in\r\nthe official organ of the government as evidence of the feeling of the\r\npeople. It was, however, not considered necessary in publishing them\r\nto mention the fact that they had been held in compliance with orders.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 1899, Mabini wrote to Aguinaldo [390] recommending\r\nchanges in the proposed constitution, which he still liked as little\r\nas ever. He was afraid that Negros and Panay would refuse to accept\r\nthe form of government it prescribed. The worst thing about it was\r\nthat the Americans would be less disposed to recognize Aguinaldo's\r\ngovernment; for when they saw the constitution they would know, as it\r\nmade no mention of them, that the Filipinos wanted independence. Mabini\r\nthought that it was possible that the wording of the constitution\r\nmight have been deliberately planned by members of the congress in\r\nfavour of annexation to the United States, so that that country would\r\nbe warned, would become more mistrustful, and would refuse to recognize\r\nAguinaldo's government. Whatever the president of the council may have\r\nthought about the theoretical advisability of a congress to represent\r\nthe people, he found one much in the way when he had obtained it.\r\n\r\nBuencamino advised that the constitution should be approved and\r\npromulgated; one argument was that the congress had been consulted in\r\nthe matter of a national loan, and if it was dissolved, there could\r\nbe no loan. This was apparently the only matter upon which it had\r\nbeen consulted. [391]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Philippine Republic was ratified at a session\r\nof the congress on January 20, 1899.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo sanctioned it and ordered that it should\r\nbe \"kept, complied with and executed in all its parts because it is\r\nthe sovereign will of the Philippine people.\" [392] The constitution\r\nprovided for a government of three coördinate powers, executive,\r\nlegislative and judicial. Whether it provided for a form of government\r\nwhich would have succeeded in the Philippines was not determined by\r\nactual experience. It was never really put in force for war with the\r\nUnited States began in two weeks and the constitution must stand as the\r\nexpression of the ideas of a certain group of educated natives rather\r\nthan as the working formula for the actual conduct of the political\r\nlife of a nation. One proof of this is the fact that not until June 8,\r\n1899, were Aguinaldo's decrees upon the registration of marriages and\r\nupon civil marriage, dated June 20,1898, revoked, and the provisions\r\nof the constitution concerning marriage put in effect. [393]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo had approved the constitution; he had informed the foreign\r\nconsuls and General Otis that it had been promulgated and become the\r\nlaw of the land. It was not promulgated. It had not become the law of\r\nthe land. It served one important purpose. It passed into the hands\r\nof the Americans and showed them the ability and the aspirations of\r\ncertain individuals of the archipelago, but Mabini and his followers\r\ndid not believe in its form or in its provisions, and Mabini at least\r\nwas emphatic in his declarations that the time had not yet come for it\r\nto be put into effect. On January 24, 1899, he wrote to Aguinaldo that\r\nif it should be promulgated it would be absolutely necessary to give\r\nthe president the veto power, and replace the elected representatives\r\nby others appointed by the government. If this were not done the\r\npresident would be at the mercy of congress, and the people, seeing\r\nthat disagreement between the executive government and the congress\r\nwas the cause of its misfortunes, would start another revolutionary\r\nmovement to destroy both of them. [394]\r\n\r\nAs long as Mabini remained in power the constitution was mere\r\npaper. Its adoption was not indicative of the capacity of the people to\r\nmaintain self-government. It expressed only the academic aspirations\r\nof the men who drafted it. There is not the slightest evidence from\r\nany previous or subsequent experience of the people that it would have\r\nworked in practice. It was enacted for the misleading of Americans\r\nrather than for the benefit of the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nWhile the government of Aguinaldo was called a republic, it was in\r\nfact a Tagálog military oligarchy in which the great mass of the\r\npeople had no share. Their duty was only to give soldiers for the\r\narmy and labourers for the fields, and to obey without question the\r\norders they received from the military heads of their provinces.\r\n\r\nThere is no cause for vain regrets. We did not destroy a republic in\r\nthe Philippines. There never was anything there to destroy which even\r\nremotely resembled a republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe Conduct of the War\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to attempt to write a history of the war which\r\nbegan on February 4, 1899, nor to discuss any one of its several\r\ncampaigns. I propose to limit myself to a statement of the conditions\r\nunder which it was conducted, and a description of the two periods\r\ninto which it may be divided.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset the Insurgent soldiers were treated with marked\r\nseverity by their leaders. On June 17, 1898, Aguinaldo issued an order\r\nto the military chiefs of certain towns in Cavite providing that a\r\nsoldier wasting ammunition should be punished with twelve lashes for\r\na first offence, twenty-four for a second, and court-martialled and\r\n\"severely punished\" for a third. [395]\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1900, General Lacuna ordered that any officer allowing\r\nhis soldiers to load their rifles when not before the enemy should be\r\nliable to capital punishment, [396] which in practice was frequently\r\ninflicted on soldiers for very minor offences.\r\n\r\nMen of means were drafted into the ranks and then excused from service\r\non the payment of cash.\r\n\r\nThe soldiery, quartered on the towns, committed endless\r\nabuses. Conditions were bad enough before the outbreak of hostilities,\r\nas I have shown in the chapters dealing with Insurgent rule. They\r\ngrew rapidly worse thereafter, and human life became cheap indeed.\r\n\r\n\"The documents of this period show that the insurgent troops driven\r\nfrom the front of Manila fell upon the people of the neighbouring\r\ntowns and burnt, robbed, and murdered. Either their officers lost\r\nall control over them, or else they directed these outrages. It was\r\nnot for some days that control was regained.\" [397]\r\n\r\nEndless orders were issued by Aguinaldo and other high Insurgent\r\nofficers, prohibiting rape, brigandage and robbery, and there was\r\ngrave need of them. Unfortunately they could not be enforced. Indeed\r\nit was often impossible to distinguish between Insurgent soldiers, who\r\nremoved their uniforms or had none, and brigands pure and simple. [398]\r\n\r\nMany men were soldiers at one time and brigands at\r\nanother. Unquestionably soldiers and brigands sometimes\r\ncoöperated. Garrisons were withdrawn from towns which did not promptly\r\nand fully comply with the demands of Insurgent commanders, [399]\r\nand armed bandits appeared and plundered them.\r\n\r\nThere were some Insurgent leaders, like Cailles, who suppressed\r\nbrigandage with a heavy hand, [400] but many of them were indifferent,\r\neven if not in alliance with the evil doers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Visayas\r\n\r\nFeeling between Tagálog soldiers and Visayan people grew constantly\r\nmore bitter, and before many months had passed they fell to killing\r\neach other. The highest officers of the \"Regional Revolutionary\r\nGovernment of the Visayas\" protested vigorously to Aguinaldo, [401]\r\nbut without result. The situation was entirely beyond his control.\r\n\r\nOn April 20, 1899, General Delgado issued an order which tells a\r\nsignificant story of conditions, and of his own weakness in dealing\r\nwith them. [402]\r\n\r\nIn Luzón General Trias of Cavite accused the soldiers and citizens\r\nof his province of committing \"robberies, assaults, kidnappings and\r\ncrimes which are committed only by barbarous and savage tribes.\" [403]\r\n\r\nThat very serious conditions promptly became general is conclusively\r\nshown by the record of Aguinaldo's government for February 24, 1899,\r\nwhen it decided--\r\n\r\n    \"that the president of the council shall study such measures\r\n    as will put an end to the continual discord and friction\r\n    between the civil and military authorities of every province,\r\n    in order that fatal consequences may be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nWith such conditions prevailing among the Filipinos themselves, it was\r\nto be expected that the laws of civilized warfare would be violated and\r\nthat American soldiers taken prisoners would sometimes be treated with\r\nbarbarity. Flags of truce were deliberately violated. [404] American\r\nsoldiers were trapped, poisoned [405] and murdered in other ways. [406]\r\n\r\nIt was promptly charged in the United States that American soldiers\r\nwere committing barbarities, and Blount has revived these old tales.\r\n\r\nI know personally that during the early days of the war Insurgent\r\nprisoners and wounded were treated with the greatest humanity and\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nA part of the Insurgent plan of campaign was the circulation of the\r\nmost shocking statements concerning the abuses committed by American\r\nsoldiers. I have elsewhere described [407] the fate that overtook\r\nColonel Arguelles, in part because he told the truth as to the humane\r\ntreatment by the Americans of prisoners and wounded.\r\n\r\nNot only did some of those who did this forfeit their lives, but\r\nnewspaper articles, military orders, and proclamations issued by civil\r\nofficers informed the people that the American soldiers stole, burned,\r\nrobbed, raped and murdered. Especial stress was laid on their alleged\r\nwholesale violations of women, partly to turn the powerful influence of\r\nthe women as a whole against them, and partly to show that they were\r\nno better than the Insurgents themselves, who frequently committed\r\nrape. [408]\r\n\r\nThese horrible tales were at first believed even by some of the\r\nresponsible Insurgent officers in remote regions, [409] but all such\r\nmen soon learned the truth, which was known to most of them from\r\nthe start.\r\n\r\nIn official correspondence between them, not intended for the public,\r\norders were given to use women as bearers of despatches for the\r\nreason that Americans did not search them. [410] More significant\r\nyet, when conditions became bad in the provinces, Insurgent officers\r\nsent their women and children to seek American protection in Manila\r\nor elsewhere. Cartload after cartload of them came in at Angeles,\r\nshortly after General Jacob H. Smith took that place. Aguinaldo himself\r\nfollowed this procedure, as is shown by the following extracts from\r\nVilla's famous diary: [411]--\r\n\r\n    \"_December 22._--It was 7 A.M. when we arrived in\r\n    Ambayuan. Here we found the women worn out from the painful\r\n    journey they had suffered. They were seated on the ground. In\r\n    their faces were observed indications of the ravages of\r\n    hunger; but they are always smiling, saying they would prefer\r\n    suffering in these mountains to being under the dominion of\r\n    the Americans, and that such sacrifices are the duties of\r\n    every patriot who loves his country.\r\n\r\n    \"We secured some camotes in this settlement, cooked them\r\n    immediately, and everybody had breakfast. Our appetites\r\n    were satisfied.\r\n\r\n    \"The honorable president had already decided some days before\r\n    to send all the women to Manila, including his family, and\r\n    this was his motive in hurrying his family forward with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_December 24._--We find ourselves still in Talubin. About 8\r\n    o'clock this morning a report came saying the Americans had\r\n    arrived at Bontoc, the provincial capital, the nearest town\r\n    to Talubin, and distant from it two hours by the road. An\r\n    immediate decision was made. The honourable president told\r\n    his family and the other women that they should remain in the\r\n    settlement and allow themselves to be caught by the Americans,\r\n    and he named Señors Sytiar and Paez to remain also, with the\r\n    obligation of conducting the women to Manila. As soon as the\r\n    arrangement was effected, the honourable president prepared\r\n    himself for the march. The parting was a very sad one for\r\n    himself and for his family.\r\n\r\n    \"The honourable president left Talubin at 11 o'clock in the\r\n    morning, his family and the other women remaining behind with\r\n    two gentlemen charged with conducting them to Manila.\" [412]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in all other similar cases, the women were kindly treated\r\nand safely conducted to their destination. Aguinaldo and his fellows\r\nknew the happy fate of the members of his own family, as is shown by\r\na later entry:--\r\n\r\n    \"_February 6._--We have been informed that the mother and son\r\n    of the honourable president are at Manila, living in the house\r\n    of Don Benito Legarda, and that they reached that capital long\r\n    before the wife and sister of the honourable president. We have\r\n    also learned that Señor Buencamino, and Tirona, and Concepcion\r\n    are prisoners of the American authorities in Manila. With\r\n    reference to the wife and sister of the honourable president\r\n    and the two Leyba sisters, it is said that they went to Vigan\r\n    and from there went by steamer to Manila.\" [413]\r\n\r\nThe mother and son, accompanied by Buencamino, had allowed themselves\r\nto be captured at an earlier date. What shall we say of a leader who\r\nwould turn his mother, wife, sister and son over to American soldiers\r\nfor safekeeping, and then continue to denounce the latter as murderers,\r\nand violaters of women? Aguinaldo did just this. That the Insurgent\r\nleaders were early and fully aware of the treatment accorded their\r\nwounded is shown by the following extract from a letter to General\r\nMoxica of Leyte, dated March 2, 1900, giving instructions as to what\r\nshould be done with wounded men:--\r\n\r\n    \"If by chance any of our men are wounded on the field or\r\n    elsewhere, efforts must be made to take away the rifles and\r\n    ammunition at once and carry them away as far as possible,\r\n    so that they may not be captured by the enemy; and if the\r\n    wounded cannot be immediately removed elsewhere or retreat\r\n    from the place, let them be left there, because it is better\r\n    to save the arms than the men, as there are many Filipinos\r\n    to fill up the ranks, but rifles are scarce and difficult to\r\n    secure for battle; and besides the Americans, coming upon\r\n    any wounded, take good care of them, while the rifles are\r\n    destroyed; therefore, I repeat, they must endeavour to save\r\n    the arms rather than the men.\" [414]\r\n\r\nThere were some rare individual instances in which uninjured Filipinos\r\nwere treated with severity, and even with cruelty, by American\r\nsoldiers. They occurred for the most part late in the war when the\r\n\"water cure\" in mild form was sometimes employed in order to compel\r\npersons who had guilty knowledge of the whereabouts of firearms to\r\ntell what they knew, to the end that the perpetration of horrible\r\nbarbarities on the common people, and the assassination of those who\r\nhad sought American protection, might the more promptly cease. Usually\r\nthe sufferers were themselves bloody murderers, who had only to tell\r\nthe truth to escape punishment. The men who performed these cruel\r\nacts knew what treatment was being commonly accorded to Filipinos,\r\nand in some instances to their own comrades. I mention these facts to\r\nexplain, not to excuse, their conduct. Cruel acts cannot be excused,\r\nbut those referred to seldom resulted in any permanent injury to the\r\nmen who suffered them, and were the rare and inevitable exceptions\r\nto the general rule that the war was waged, so far as the Americans\r\nwere concerned, with a degree of humanity hitherto unprecedented under\r\nsimilar conditions. The Insurgents violated every rule of civilized\r\nwarfare, yet oathbreakers, spies and men fighting in citizens' clothes\r\nnot only were not shot by the Americans, as they might very properly\r\nhave been, but were often turned loose with a mere warning not to\r\noffend again.\r\n\r\nThe false news circulated to aid the Insurgent cause was by no means\r\nlimited to such matters. Every time their troops made a stand they were\r\npromptly defeated and driven back, but their faltering courage was\r\nbolstered up by glorious tidings of wonderful, but wholly imaginary,\r\nvictories won elsewhere. It was often reported that many times more\r\nAmericans had fallen in some insignificant skirmish than were actually\r\nkilled in the whole war, while generals perished by the dozen and\r\ncolonels by the thousand. Our losses on March 27, 1899, in fighting\r\nnorth of Manila, were said to be twenty-eight thousand. In reality\r\nonly fifty-six Americans were killed in all northern Luzón during\r\nthe entire month.\r\n\r\nOn April 26, 1899, the governor of Iloilo published the following\r\nremarkable news items among others:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Pavia_, April 6th, 1899.\r\n\r\n    \"The Liberating Army of the Visayan Islands to the Local\r\n    Presidents of the towns shown on the margin:\r\n\r\n    \"_Towns:_ Santa Barbara, Pavia, Leganes, Zárraga, Dumangas,\r\n    Batac Viejo, Tuilao, Batac Nuevo, Banate.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Santa Ana taken by Americans burning town our troops advancing\r\n    to Rosario and Escolta Americans request parley account death\r\n    General and officers and many soldiers.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"At 3 P.M. of the 14th battle at Santolan 500 American\r\n    prisoners who are to be taken to Malolos.\r\n\r\n    \"At 9.45 P.M.

The Rosario and Escolta are the main\r\nbusiness streets of the city.\r\n\r\nApparently the Insurgents must have thought that colonels were as\r\nnumerous in our army as in theirs, for they reported two thousand of\r\nthem killed on February 6, 1899, and threw in one general for good\r\nmeasure. [416]\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe learn from the _Filipino Herald_ for February 23, 1899, that on that\r\nday the Filipino army captured and occupied the suburbs of Manila,\r\nwhile American troops were besieged in the outskirts of the city,\r\nat La Loma, and in the neighbouring town of Caloocan. [417]\r\n\r\nBut why continue. No tale concerning American losses in the Philippines\r\nwas too fantastic to be told by the leaders and believed by the\r\nsoldiery and the populace. The American soldiers were even said to\r\nbe refusing to fight, and great prisons were being constructed in\r\norder properly to punish them.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur and his entire staff were captured before March 2,\r\n1900, according to a letter sent to General Moxica of Leyte on that\r\ndate. [418]\r\n\r\nAnd what of conditions in the United States during this troubled\r\nperiod? We learn from the Insurgent records that prior to January 15,\r\n1900, \"the Union Army\" had met with a new disaster, as a result of\r\nwhich President McKinley tendered his resignation, being succeeded\r\nby Mr. Bryan. Philippine independence was to be proclaimed on\r\nFebruary 4, 1899. On January 20, \"General Otis's successor, John\r\nWaterly, of the democratic party,\" arrived at Manila with papers and\r\ninstructions relative to proclaiming the Philippine Republic. [419]\r\nThings now went from bad to worse. The trouble between democrats\r\nand republicans resulted in an insurrection. Before August, 1901,\r\nPresident McKinley had brought about strained relations between\r\nGermany and the United States by bribing an anarchist to assassinate\r\nthe German Emperor. [420] Before September 15, 1901, he had been\r\nkilled by a member of the Democratic party, and the Filipinos could\r\nacclaim their independence. [421]\r\n\r\nThe first period of the war, which we may term the period of organized\r\narmed resistance, drew rapidly to its close, and there followed the\r\nsecond period, characterized by guerrilla tactics on the part of\r\nthe Insurgents.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General Pío\r\ndel Pilar, ex-bandit, if indeed he had ever ceased to rob and murder,\r\nand authorized this man, whom he had been again and again asked to\r\nremove, to begin guerrilla warfare in Bulacan. Guerrilla tactics\r\nwere duly authorized for, and had been adopted by, Insurgent forces\r\neverywhere before the end of November.\r\n\r\nOf this style of fighting Taylor has truly said:--\r\n\r\n    \"If war in certain of its aspects is a temporary reversion\r\n    to barbarism, guerrilla warfare is a temporary reversion to\r\n    savagery. The man who orders it assumes a grave responsibility\r\n    before the people whose fate is in his hands, for serious\r\n    as is the material destruction which this method of warfare\r\n    entails, the destruction to the orderly habits of mind and\r\n    thought which, at bottom, are civilization, is even more\r\n    serious. Robbery and brigandage, murder and arson follow in\r\n    its wake.\r\n\r\n    Guerrilla warfare means a policy of destruction, a policy of\r\n    terror, and never yet, however great may have been the injury\r\n    caused by it, however much it may have prolonged the war\r\n    in which it has been employed, has it secured a termination\r\n    favorable to the people who have chosen it.\" [422]\r\n\r\nThe case under discussion furnished no exception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nSuch semblance of discipline as had previously existed among the\r\nInsurgent soldiers rapidly disappeared. Conditions had been very\r\nbad under the \"Republic\" and worse during the first period of the\r\nwar. During the second period they rapidly became unendurable in\r\nmany regions, and the common people were driven into the arms of\r\nthe Americans, in spite of threats of death, barbarously carried out\r\nby Insurgent officers, soldiers and agents in thousands of cases. I\r\nhave described at some length the conditions which now arose in the\r\nchapter on Murder as a Governmental Agency, to which the reader is\r\nreferred for details. [423]\r\n\r\nIn the effort to protect the towns which showed themselves friendly,\r\nthe American forces were divided, subdivided and subdivided again. On\r\nMarch 1, 1901, they were occupying no less than five hundred two\r\nstations. By December of the same year the number had increased\r\nto six hundred thirty-nine, with an average of less than sixty men\r\nto a post. As a result of the protection thus afforded and of the\r\nhumane conduct of our troops, the people turned to us in constantly\r\nincreasing numbers.\r\n\r\nIt remained to stamp out the dying embers of insurrection, while\r\ncontinuing to seek to protect those who put their trust in us. Further\r\nsubdivision of the troops in order to garrison more points was hardly\r\npossible, but field operations were actively pushed. One after another\r\nthe Insurgent leaders were captured or voluntarily surrendered. Most\r\nofficers of importance issued explanatory statements to the people\r\nshortly after giving up active field operations, whether they\r\nsurrendered voluntarily or were taken prisoners. Aguinaldo himself\r\nwas captured on March 23, 1901, at Palanan, the northernmost point\r\non the east coast of Luzon inhabited by civilized people. No place\r\nin the islands, inhabited by Filipinos, is more completely isolated,\r\nand he had long been almost entirely cut off from his followers,\r\nmany of whom believed him to be dead. On April 19, 1901, he issued\r\nan address to the Filipino people, in which he clearly recognized\r\nthe fact that they wanted peace. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Manila_, April 19, 1901.\r\n\r\n    \"To the Filipino People:--\r\n\r\n    \"I believe that I am not in error in presuming that the\r\n    unhappy fate to which my adverse fortune has led me is not\r\n    a surprise to those who have been familiar day by day with\r\n    the progress of the war. The lessons thus taught, the full\r\n    meaning of which has recently come to my knowledge, suggested\r\n    to me with irresistible force that the complete termination\r\n    of   hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable\r\n    but  absolutely essential to the welfare of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"The Filipinos have never been dismayed by their weakness,\r\n    nor have they faltered in following the path pointed out by\r\n    their fortitude and courage. The time has come, however, in\r\n    which they find their advance along the path impeded by an\r\n    irresistible force--a force which, while it restrains them,\r\n    yet enlightens the mind and opens another course by presenting\r\n    to them the cause of peace. This cause has been joyfully\r\n    embraced by a majority of our fellow-countrymen, who have\r\n    already united around the glorious and sovereign banner of the\r\n    United States. In this banner they repose their trust in the\r\n    belief that under its protection our people will attain all the\r\n    promised liberties which they are even now beginning to enjoy.\r\n\r\n    \"The country has declared unmistakably in favor of peace; so\r\n    be it. Enough of blood; enough of tears and desolation. This\r\n    wish cannot be ignored by the men still in arms if they are\r\n    animated by no other desire than to serve this noble people\r\n    which has thus clearly manifested its will.\r\n\r\n    \"So also do I respect this will now that it is known to me,\r\n    and after mature deliberation resolutely proclaim to the world\r\n    that I cannot refuse to heed the voice of a people longing for\r\n    peace, nor the lamentations of thousands of families yearning\r\n    to see their dear ones in the enjoyment of the liberty promised\r\n    by the generosity of the great American nation.\r\n\r\n    \"By acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United\r\n    States throughout the entire Archipelago, as I now do without\r\n    any reservation whatsoever, I believe that I am serving thee,\r\n    my beloved country. May happiness be theirs.\r\n\r\n    \"_Emilio Aguinaldo_. [424]\r\n\r\n    \"_Manila_, April 19, 1901.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement of Aguinaldo, published in Spanish, Tagálog and\r\nEnglish, undoubtedly hastened the end of the war, but it did not lead\r\nto immediate general surrender, for as Taylor has very truly said:--\r\n\r\n    \"A force like Aguinaldo's could not be surrendered. It had been\r\n    torn by internal dissensions and the bonds of discipline had\r\n    always been very lax. It had originally been held together\r\n    by a lively expectation of the advantages to be obtained\r\n    from the pillage of Manila. That hope had disappeared, and\r\n    the leaders had become the lords of life and property each\r\n    in his own province. It was a force which could disintegrate,\r\n    but which could not surrender. Only armies can do that. Forces\r\n    over which their leaders have lost all except nominal control\r\n    when beaten do not surrender. They disintegrate by passing\r\n    through the stages of guerrilla warfare, of armed bands of\r\n    highwaymen, of prowling groups of thieves, of sturdy beggars\r\n    who at opportune moments resort to petty larceny.\" [425]\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's forces now passed through these several stages. Some of\r\nhis more important subordinates had previously been captured or had\r\nsurrendered. Others, still remaining in the field, now acted on his\r\nadvice, more or less promptly. A few remained obdurate for a time,\r\nbut as a rule not for long, and soon there remained in the field only\r\na very limited number of real military leaders, like General Malvar in\r\nBatangas and General Lukban in Samar, and a very considerable number\r\nof bandit chiefs, some of whom had posed as Insurgents. The forces\r\nof the latter were now materially and rapidly augmented by men who\r\nhad been Insurgent officers or soldiers and  while serving in this\r\ncapacity had become so enamoured of a lawless life that they were now\r\nunwilling to settle down and work for their daily bread, preferring\r\nto continue to live off their long-suffering fellow-countrymen,\r\nwhom they robbed and murdered more mercilessly than ever.\r\n\r\nThe war was practically over. The insurrection had failed. In my\r\nopinion no Filipino who held out to the end for independence compared\r\nin intellectual power with Mabini, and I deem his views as to why\r\nit failed worthy of special attention. At the time of his death,\r\nhe left behind a memoir from which I quote the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"The revolution failed because it was poorly led, because\r\n    its head conquered his place, not by meritorious, but by\r\n    reprehensible actions, because in place of supporting the men\r\n    most useful to the people, he rendered them useless because he\r\n    was jealous of them. Believing that the aggrandizement of the\r\n    people was nothing more than his own personal aggrandizement,\r\n    he did not judge the merits of men by their capacity,\r\n    character, or patriotism, but by the degree of friendship\r\n    and relationship which bound them to him; and wishing to have\r\n    his favorites always ready to sacrifice themselves for him,\r\n    he showed himself complaisant to their faults. Having thus\r\n    secured the people, the people deserted him. And the people\r\n    having deserted him, he had to fall like a wax idol melted\r\n    by the heat of adversity. God forbid that we should forget\r\n    so terrible a lesson learned at the cost of unspeakable\r\n    sufferings.\" [426]\r\n\r\nThese are by no means the only reasons why the revolution failed,\r\nbut they foredoomed it to failure.\r\n\r\nThe surrender or capture of the more respectable military element\r\nleft the unsurrendered firearms in the hands of men most of whom\r\nwere ignorant, many of whom were criminal, and nearly all of whom\r\nwere irresponsible and unscrupulous.\r\n\r\nStrict enforcement of the rules of civilized warfare against them\r\nwas threatened, but not actually resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe situation was particularly bad in Batangas. General J. F. Bell\r\nwas put in charge there, and he found a humane and satisfactory\r\nsolution of the existing difficulties in reconcentration--not the\r\nkind of reconcentration which made the Spaniards hated in Cuba, but\r\na measure of a wholly different sort. This measure and its results\r\nhave been concisely described by Taylor, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"General Bell said he was as anxious as any one could be\r\n    to avoid making war against those who really wanted the\r\n    termination of hostilities, and it was his duty to protect\r\n    them against the vengeance of others. Over and above all\r\n    these considerations in importance, however, was the absolute\r\n    necessity of making it impossible for insurgents to procure\r\n    food by levying contributions. Therefore, in order to give\r\n    those who were pacifically inclined an opportunity to escape\r\n    hardship, as far as possible, and preserve their food supply\r\n    for themselves and their families, it was determined to\r\n    establish zones of protection with limits sufficiently near\r\n    all towns to enable the small garrisons thereof to give the\r\n    people living within these zones efficient protection against\r\n    ruinous exactions by insurgents. He accordingly, 'in order to\r\n    put an end to enforced contributions now levied by insurgents\r\n    upon the inhabitants of sparsely settled and outlying barrios\r\n    and districts by means of intimidation and assassination,'\r\n    ordered the commanding officers of all towns in the provinces\r\n    of Batangas and Laguna to 'immediately specify and establish\r\n    plainly marked limits surrounding each town bounding a zone\r\n    within which it may be practicable, with an average-sized\r\n    garrison, to exercise sufficient supervision over and furnish\r\n    protection to inhabitants (who desire to be peaceful) against\r\n    the depredation of armed insurgents. The limits may include\r\n    the barrios which exist sufficiently near the town to be given\r\n    protection and supervision by the garrison, and should include\r\n    some ground on which live stock could graze, but so situated\r\n    that it can be patrolled and watched. All ungarrisoned towns\r\n    will be garrisoned as soon as troops become available.\r\n\r\n    \"'Commanding officers will also see that orders are at once\r\n    given and distributed to all the inhabitants within the\r\n    jurisdiction of towns over which they exercise supervision,\r\n    informing them of the danger of remaining outside of these\r\n    limits, and that unless they move by December 25 from outlying\r\n    barrios and districts, with all their movable food supplies,\r\n    including rice, _palay_, [427] chickens, live stock, etc.,\r\n    to within the limits of the zone established at their own\r\n    or nearest town, their property (found outside of said\r\n    zone at said date) will become liable to confiscation or\r\n    destruction. The people will be permitted to move houses\r\n    from outlying districts should they desire to do so, or to\r\n    construct temporary shelter for themselves on any vacant\r\n    land without compensation to the owner, and no owner will be\r\n    permitted to deprive them of the privilege of doing so. In the\r\n    discretion of commanding officers the prices of necessities of\r\n    existence may also be regulated in the interest of those thus\r\n    seeking protection. As soon as peaceful conditions have been\r\n    reëstablished in the brigade these persons will be encouraged\r\n    to return to their homes, and such assistance be rendered\r\n    them as may be found practicable.'\r\n\r\n    \"It was deemed best not to compel the people to enter these\r\n    zones; but they were warned that unless they accepted that\r\n    protection their property, which consisted almost entirely\r\n    of food supplies, would become liable to confiscation or\r\n    destruction, because it might be impossible to determine\r\n    whether it belonged to hostile or peaceful people. To put\r\n    an end to vengeance by assassination, it was determined to\r\n    make use of the right of retaliation conferred by General\r\n    Order 100 issued by President Lincoln in 1863. A circular\r\n    telegram was published announcing an intention to retaliate\r\n    by the execution of prisoners of war in case any more were\r\n    assassinated by insurgents for political reasons. It was not\r\n    found necessary to do this. Assassinations stopped at once.\r\n\r\n    \"As the campaign progressed it became more and more apparent\r\n    that a large number of poor people had contributed through\r\n    fear, for the power of the insurgents to collect came to\r\n    an end after they had lost their power of intimidation. The\r\n    efficiency of the protection afforded in such zones was the\r\n    determining factor in forming the decision and attitude of\r\n    many of the natives. The protection afforded was efficient,\r\n    and from time to time many additional families entered the\r\n    zones. The sentiment for peace grew stronger steadily and\r\n    natives volunteered assistance to Americans at every hand and\r\n    in every town. When these volunteers were trustworthy they were\r\n    armed and sent out into the mountains from which they brought\r\n    back guns, and insurgents, and hundreds of half-famished\r\n    men, women, and children who, released from the intimidating\r\n    influence of the insurgents, entered the zones of protection.\r\n\r\n    \"The most serious discomfort experienced by any one within\r\n    these areas was caused to the _mestizo_ ruling group, whose\r\n    members bitterly resented the blow to their prestige in being\r\n    treated like every one else. They had been accustomed to have\r\n    others work for them and obey them blindly. To a man who could\r\n    speak Spanish and who had always been the lord of his _barrio_,\r\n    [428] the possibility of having to cultivate a field with his\r\n    own hands was an unthinkable and scandalous thing. These men\r\n    suffered and suffered acutely; but it was not their bodies\r\n    which suffered--it was their pride.\r\n\r\n    \"Malvar surrendered on April 16, 1902. Most of the people\r\n    had turned against their once highly respected chief, and\r\n    toward the end several thousand natives of Batangas joined\r\n    the Americans in their determined hunt for the fugitive\r\n    leader. Realization of the fact that the people were against\r\n    him materially aided in forcing his surrender.\r\n\r\n    \"General Bell had captured or forced to surrender some 8000 to\r\n    10,000 persons actively engaged, in one capacity or another,\r\n    in the insurrection. These prisoners were rapidly released\r\n    when they had taken the oath of allegiance. By the first week\r\n    of July no political prisoners were held in this region. They\r\n    had returned to their homes.\r\n\r\n    \"The policy of concentrating the people in protected zones\r\n    and destroying the food which was used for the maintenance of\r\n    guerrilla bands was not new. There had been precedents even\r\n    in the United States. One of these is the order issued on\r\n    August 25, 1863, by Brigadier-General Ewing, commanding the\r\n    district of the border, with headquarters at Kansas City, Mo.,\r\n    in which he ordered the inhabitants of a large part of three\r\n    counties of that State to remove from their residences within\r\n    fifteen days to the protection of the military stations which\r\n    he had established. All grain and hay in that district was\r\n    ordered to be taken to those military stations. If it was not\r\n    convenient to so dispose of it, it would be burned (Rebellion\r\n    Records, Series I, Vol. XXII, Part II, p. 473). The American\r\n    commanders in the Philippines had adopted no new method of\r\n    procedure in dealing with war traitors; they had, however,\r\n    effectively employed an old one.\r\n\r\n    \"The insurrection had originated among the Tagálogs and had\r\n    spread like a conflagration from the territory occupied by\r\n    them. The fire had been quenched everywhere else. General\r\n    Bell had now stamped out the embers in the Tagálog provinces.\r\n\r\n    \"On July 2 the Secretary of War telegraphed that the\r\n    insurrection against the sovereign authority of the United\r\n    States in the Philippines having come to an end, and provincial\r\n    civil governments having been established throughout the\r\n    entire territory of the archipelago not inhabited by Moro\r\n    tribes, the office of military governor in the archipelago was\r\n    terminated. On July 4, 1902, the President of the United States\r\n    issued a proclamation of amnesty proclaiming, with certain\r\n    reservations, a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all\r\n    persons in the Philippine Archipelago who had participated\r\n    in the insurrection.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Bell's motives and methods in reconcentrating the inhabitants\r\nof this troubled region have been grossly misrepresented, and he\r\nhimself has been sadly maligned. He is the most humane of men, and\r\nthe plan which he adopted resulted in the reëstablishment of law and\r\norder at a minimum cost of human suffering.\r\n\r\nMany of the occupants of his reconcentration camps received there\r\ntheir first lessons in hygienic living. Many of them were reluctant\r\nto leave the camps and return to their homes when normal conditions\r\nagain prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe number of Filipinos killed during the Batangas campaign was\r\nvery small. [429] Blount has sought to make it appear that partly as\r\nan indirect consequence of war there was dreadful mortality there,\r\nciting by way of proof the fact that the Coast and Geodetic Atlas,\r\npublished as a part of the report of the first Philippine Commission,\r\ngave the population of Batangas as 312,192, while the census of 1903\r\ngave it as 257,715. [430]\r\n\r\nThe report of the United States Philippine Commission for 1903\r\ngives the population of Manila as 221,000, while in 1900 it had been\r\n260,000. Does this mean that there had been a holocaust in Manila? Not\r\nat all. It means only that the thousands of Filipinos who had sought\r\nthe protection of the American forces there during the period when\r\nthey feared their own soldiers in the provinces had mostly returned\r\nto their homes. During the disturbed period in Batangas great numbers\r\nof people took refuge in other and more peaceful regions. Some of\r\nthem returned later; others did not.\r\n\r\nBlount further quotes a statement in the 1901 report of the Provincial\r\nSecretary of Batangas to the effect that:\r\n\r\n    \"The mortality, caused no longer by the war, but by disease,\r\n    such as malaria and dysentery, has reduced to a little over\r\n    200,000 the more than 300,000 inhabitants which in former\r\n    years the province had.\" [431]\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that these figures, showing a mortality of a\r\nhundred thousand from disease alone, are hardly consistent with those\r\nquoted by Blount as showing a decrease in population during a longer\r\nperiod of only fifty-four thousand four hundred and forty-seven, it is\r\nnot apparent why Americans should be charged with deaths due to malaria\r\nor dysentery, since no systematic effort to rid Batangas of these ills\r\nhad ever previously been made, and the very thing which then prevented\r\nthe adoption of the measures subsequently so successfully put forth\r\nto this end was the disorderly conduct of the people themselves. As a\r\nsimple matter of fact, however, there was no such dreadful mortality\r\nfrom these diseases at this time. Malaria has never been especially bad\r\nin this province, and even cholera, which swept it during the period\r\nin question and is far more readily communicated than is dysentery,\r\ncaused only twenty-three hundred and ninety-nine known deaths.\r\n\r\nIn the end peace was established and prosperity followed in its wake.\r\n\r\nThis result was brought about in part by the efficient activity of\r\nthe armed forces of the United States and in part by the efforts of\r\nthe first and second Philippine Commissions. [432]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan and Independence\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to bring home to some of my Democratic and Anti-Imperialist\r\nfriends the unreliable character of the testimony of even the very\r\nhigh officers of the so-called Philippine Republic, I here quote\r\ncertain extracts from the Insurgent records, showing the important\r\npart played, doubtless unwittingly, by Mr. William Jennings Bryan in\r\nPhilippine politics during the war. The first of these might properly\r\nhave been considered in the chapter entitled \"Was Independence\r\nPromised?\" Others are instructive in that they show the use made\r\nof false news in bolstering up the Insurgent cause, and might with\r\npropriety have been included in the chapter on \"The Conduct of the\r\nWar.\" I have thought it best to keep them by themselves. Further\r\ncomment on them would seem to be superfluous.\r\n\r\n    \"On May 1, 1900 (P.I.R., 516.6), I. de los Santos wrote a\r\n    long letter in Tagálog and cipher to Aguinaldo, in which he\r\n    reported upon the progress of what he would have probably\r\n    called the diplomatic campaign. If this letter is to be\r\n    believed, the agents in the United States of the junta had\r\n    been able to form relations which might be of great value to\r\n    them. Santos said in part:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Commissioners... Señores Kant (G. Apacible) and Raff\r\n    (Sixto López) duly carried out your last instructions given\r\n    at Tárlac. Señor Del Pan, sailing by way of Japan, about the\r\n    middle of October, and Señor Caney (G. Apacible), sailing by\r\n    way of Europe about the 1st of November, met in Toronto about\r\n    the middle of February following. But before the arrival of\r\n    Kant, Raff had already come from Hayti (United States) and was\r\n    able to pry in upon our political friends and enemies. When\r\n    they met each other they continued the voyage incognito, as\r\n    Raft had done previously, making themselves known to a very\r\n    few people; but later on, and according to the instructions\r\n    carried by Caney, they made themselves known to a greater\r\n    number of people, and have succeeded in interviewing Bryan\r\n    who happened to be in New York. Señor Raff said that Bryan\r\n    feared being present at a conference, lest he might be called\r\n    a traitor by members of his own party, and also by those\r\n    of the opposite or \"imperialist\" party, who are quite proud\r\n    over the victories they have gained against our people over\r\n    there. Nevertheless, Raff was able to be present and talk at\r\n    some of the anti-imperialist meetings, our political friends\r\n    introducing him as a friend from the committee (at Hongkong)\r\n    and as an advocate of the cessation of the war over there\r\n    in order that our sacred rights may be given consideration\r\n    by them. And as Bryan could not personally take part in the\r\n    conference, he sent a most trusted person, his right-hand man,\r\n    Dr. Gardner. The results of the conference between Señor Raff\r\n    and Dr. Gardner, the latter acting in the name of Mr. Bryan,\r\n    are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"'1st. That we may fight on, and Bryan will never cease to\r\n    defend our sacred rights. 2nd. That we must never mention\r\n    Bryan's name in our manifestos and proclamations, lest the\r\n    opposite party might say he is a traitor. 3rd. That we are in\r\n    the right; and hence he promised in the name of Bryan that if\r\n    this Señor Bryan is victorious in the presidential campaign,\r\n    he will recognize our independence without delay. Your honored\r\n    self can easily conclude from all the foregoing that Señor Del\r\n    Pan, after the receipt of these promises, concurred with him;\r\n    and he returned to inform Señor Apacible about the results\r\n    of the conference. So these two studied over the plan of\r\n    the policy to be adopted and carried out. I write you what\r\n    their opinions are, viz.: 1st, that they will reside there,\r\n    pending the outcome of the presidential contest, aiding the\r\n    propaganda and enlivening it until November, the date set for\r\n    the desired thing. Owing to what Dr. Gardner said and promised\r\n    in the name of Bryan, some one ought to stay there in order\r\n    that Bryan may be approached, if he is elected, so he can\r\n    sign the recognition of our independence; and this should\r\n    be done at once, lest in his excitement over the victory\r\n    he should forget his promise. 3rd. For carrying out the two\r\n    propositions just mentioned, they request 2000 pounds sterling,\r\n    that is $20,000 in silver, to be used for the propaganda,\r\n    for paying newspapers and for bribing senators--this last\r\n    clause is somewhat dangerous and impossible. And 4th, that\r\n    the money must be sent immediately, and that you should be\r\n    informed not to mention the name of Bryan in the manifestos\r\n    and proclamations.\r\n\r\n    \"'In order to answer quickly and decisively that proposition,\r\n    and as I did not have the desired money here, I answered as\r\n    follows: \"Plan approved; for the sake of economy we have\r\n    decided that one of the two retire, but before doing so\r\n    make arrangements, establish communications with leaders of\r\n    Bryan's party, and he who remains should thus cultivate the\r\n    relations; he who is to retire will locate himself in Paris\r\n    near Señor Katipalad (Agoncillo) with whom he will secretly\r\n    discuss political problems that may arise. So he will watch\r\n    for the opportune moment of Bryan's election, in order to go\r\n    immediately to Hayti and formally arrange the contract with\r\n    Bryan.\" [433]\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"'By the end of 1899, by the time guerrilla warfare was well\r\n    under way, by the time that any Filipino government, unless\r\n    an expression of the unfettered will of the nearest bandit\r\n    who can muster a dozen rifles may be called a government,\r\n    had ceased to exist, a strong opposition to the policy of the\r\n    administration had arisen in the United States and a demand for\r\n    the recognition of the independence of the Philippines. The\r\n    junta in Hongkong were assured that the Democratic party\r\n    would come into power in the next elections and that this\r\n    would mean the success of the patriotic efforts of Aguinaldo\r\n    and his followers. The news was good and was forthwith spread\r\n    abroad in \"Extracts from our correspondence with America,\"\r\n    \"News from our foreign agents,\" \"News from America,\" and\r\n    \"Translations from the foreign press\"--circulars and handbills\r\n    printed on thin paper which were smuggled into the Philippines\r\n    and passed into the hands of the guerrilla leaders who could\r\n    read Spanish. They gathered their followers about them and\r\n    told them that a powerful party had arisen in America which\r\n    was going to give them all they had ever asked for. They had\r\n    only to fight on, for success was certain. In America the\r\n    \"Anti-imperialists\" were hanging the \"Imperialists,\" and\r\n    they should continue to harry the American adherents among\r\n    the natives of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    \"'There are a number of these publications among the papers\r\n    captured from the insurgents, and the adoption of this method\r\n    of propaganda seems to have been nearly coincident with\r\n    Aguinaldo's orders declaring guerrilla warfare. It does not\r\n    seem likely that the matter contained in them was supplied by\r\n    a Filipino, for if it was he assumed a general acquaintance\r\n    among the people with American politics and American methods\r\n    which they were far from possessing.\r\n\r\n    \"'In these publications the Filipinos were assured that\r\n    the Imperialists were kept in power only by the lavish\r\n    contributions of the \"truts,\" whatever they may have been;\r\n    but the people of the United States were growing weary of their\r\n    domination and were about to return to the true principles of\r\n    Washington and Jefferson. The illustrious Americans \"Crosvy\r\n    Stickney, and Vartridge\" were all laboring for the cause\r\n    of Philippine independence. Long lists of American cities\r\n    were given in which the illustrious orators Mr. Croshy\r\n    and Mr. Schurts had addressed applauding crowds upon the\r\n    necessity of throttling the \"truts\" because they opposed\r\n    recognition of the rights of the Filipinos. In August, 1900,\r\n    \"News from our agents in America\" informed its readers that--\r\n\r\n        \"'\"W. J. Bryan has stated in a speech that his first\r\n        act upon being elected President will be to declare\r\n        the independence of the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'On June 16, 1900, Gen. Riego de Dios, acting head of\r\n    the Hongkong junta, wrote to Gen. I. Torres (P.I.R., 530),\r\n    the guerrilla commander in Bulacán Province, and assured\r\n    him that a little more endurance, a little more constancy,\r\n    was all that was needed to secure the attainment of their\r\n    ends. According to their advices the Democratic party would\r\n    win in the approaching elections in the United States, and--\"it\r\n    is certain that Bryan is the incarnation of our independence.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'The number of men opposed to the policy of the administration\r\n    was said to be continually increasing.\r\n\r\n    \"'The attitude of those who protect us cannot be more manly\r\n    and resolute: \"Continue the struggle until you conquer or\r\n    die.\" Mr. Beecher of the League in Cincinnati writes us:\r\n    \"I shall always be the champion of the cause of justice and\r\n    of truth,\" says Mr. Winslow of the Boston League. \"Not even\r\n    threats of imprisonment will make me cease in my undertaking,\"\r\n    Doctor Denziger assures us. \"I shall accept every risk and\r\n    responsibility,\" says Doctor Leverson. \"If it is necessary, I\r\n    shall go so far as to provoke a revolution in my own country,\"\r\n    repeats Mr. Udell. \"It is necessary to save the Republic and\r\n    democracy from the abyss of imperialism and save the worthy\r\n    Filipinos from oppression and extermination\" is cried by\r\n    all, and the sound of this cry is ever rising louder and\r\n    louder.'\" [434]\r\n\r\nExtract from a letter of Papa Isio [435] dated March 4, 1901:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have received from Luzón an order to proceed more rapidly\r\n    with my operations this month, as Bryan ordered Emilío to keep\r\n    the war going vigorously until April, and he also said that\r\n    if independence was not given the Philippines by that time,\r\n    he, Bryan, and his followers would rise in arms against the\r\n    oppressors.\" [436]\r\n\r\n    \"_Tarlac_, Oct. 26, 1899.\r\n\r\n    \"To the Military Governor of This City, and To the Secretary\r\n    of the Interior.\r\n\r\n    \"As a meeting shall be held on the morning of Sunday next\r\n    in the Presidential Palace of this Republic in return for\r\n    that held in the United States by Mr. Bryan, who drank to\r\n    the name of our Honourable President as one of the heroes of\r\n    the world, and for the purpose of celebrating it with more\r\n    pomp and contributing to it the greater splendor with your\r\n    personnel, I will be obliged to you if you will please call\r\n    at this office to confer with me on the matter.\r\n\r\n    \"God preserve you, etc.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"_F.

Flores, acting secretary of war, to the\r\nmilitary governor of Tarlac on October 27, 1899, there occurs the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the United States meetings and banquets have been held in\r\n    honor of our Honourable President, Don Emilio Aguinaldo, who\r\n    was pronounced one of the heroes of the world by Mr. Bryan,\r\n    future president of the United States. The Masonic Society,\r\n    therefore, interpreting the unanimous desires of the people,\r\n    and with the approval of the government, will on Sunday the\r\n    29th instant, organize a meeting or popular assembly in the\r\n    interest of national independence and in honor of Mr. Bryan\r\n    of the anti-imperialist party, the defenders of our cause in\r\n    the United States. The meeting will consist of two functions;\r\n    first--at nine A.M. of the 29th the assembly will convene in a\r\n    suitable place, a national hymn will inaugurate the exercises,\r\n    after which appropriate addresses will be delivered; and\r\n    second--at four P.M. a popular demonstration will take place\r\n    throughout the town, with bands of music parading the streets;\r\n    residents will decorate and illuminate their houses.\r\n\r\n    \"Which I have the pleasure of transmitting to you for your\r\n    information and guidance and for that of the troops under\r\n    your command.\" [438]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe First Philippine Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere mentioned the appointment of the First Philippine\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 1899, its civilian members met at Washington and\r\nreceived the President's instructions.\r\n\r\nWe were to aid in \"the most humane, pacific and effective extension\r\nof authority throughout these islands, and to secure, with the least\r\npossible delay, the benefits of a wise and generous protection of\r\nlife and property to the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nWe were directed to meet at the earliest possible day in the city\r\nof Manila and to announce by a public proclamation our presence\r\nand the mission intrusted to us, carefully setting forth that while\r\nthe established military government would be continued as long as\r\nnecessity might require, efforts would be made to alleviate the burden\r\nof taxation, to establish industrial and commercial prosperity and\r\nto provide for the safety of persons and property by such means as\r\nmight be found conducive to those ends.\r\n\r\nWe were to endeavour, without interfering with the military\r\nauthorities, to ascertain what amelioration in the condition of the\r\ninhabitants and what improvements in public order were practicable,\r\nand for this purpose were to study attentively the existing social and\r\npolitical state of the several populations, particularly as regarded\r\nthe forms of local government, the administration of justice, the\r\ncollection of customs and other taxes, the means of transportation and\r\nthe need of public improvements, reporting through the Department of\r\nState the results of our observations and reflections, and recommending\r\nsuch executive action as might, from time to time, seem to us wise\r\nand useful.\r\n\r\nWe were authorized to recommend suitable persons for appointment\r\nto offices, made necessary by personal changes in the existing\r\ncivil administration, from among the inhabitants who had previously\r\nacknowledged their allegiance to the American government.\r\n\r\nWe were to \"ever use due respect for all the ideals, customs and\r\ninstitutions of the tribes which compose the population, emphasizing\r\nupon all occasions the just and beneficent intentions of the United\r\nStates,\" and were commissioned on account of our \"knowledge, skill, and\r\nintegrity as bearers of the good-will, the protection and the richest\r\nblessings of a liberating rather than a conquering nation.\" [439]\r\n\r\nNothing could be more false than Blount's insinuation that we were\r\nsent out to help Otis run the war. [440] There was no war when\r\nwe started, and we were expressly enjoined from interfering with\r\nthe military government or its officers. We were sent to deliver a\r\nmessage of good-will, to investigate, and to recommend, and there\r\nour powers ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurman and I, with a small clerical force, sailed from Vancouver,\r\nJanuary 31, 1899. On our arrival at Yokohama we learned with keen\r\nregret of the outbreak of hostilities at Manila.\r\n\r\nBlount has incorrectly stated that President McKinley had sent the\r\ncommission out when the dogs of war were already let loose. [441] The\r\ndogs of war had not been loosed when we started, and one of the main\r\npurposes in sending us was to keep them in their kennels if possible.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo has made the following statements in his \"Reseña Verídica\":--\r\n\r\n    \"... We, the Filipinos, would have received said commission,\r\n    as honourable agents of the great America, with demonstrations\r\n    of true kindness and entire adhesion. The commissioners would\r\n    have toured over all our provinces, seeing and observing\r\n    at close range order and tranquillity, in the whole of\r\n    our territory. They would have seen the fields tilled\r\n    and planted. They would have examined our Constitution and\r\n    public administration, in perfect peace, and they would have\r\n    experienced and enjoyed that ineffable charm of our Oriental\r\n    manner, a mixture of abandon and solicitude, of warmth and of\r\n    frigidity, of confidence and of suspiciousness, which makes\r\n    our relations with foreigners change into a thousand colours,\r\n    agreeable to the utmost.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah! but this landscape suited neither General Otis nor the\r\n    Imperialists! For their criminal intention it was better that\r\n    the American commissioners should find war and desolation\r\n    in the Philippines, perceiving from the day of their arrival\r\n    the fetid stench emitted by the mingled corpses of Americans\r\n    and Filipinos. For their purposes it was better that that\r\n    gentleman, Mr. Schurman, President of the Commission, could not\r\n    leave Manila, limiting himself to listen to the few Filipinos,\r\n    who, having yielded to the reasonings of gold, were partisans\r\n    of the Imperialists. It was better that the commission should\r\n    contemplate the Philippine problem through conflagrations,\r\n    to the whiz of bullets, on the transverse light of all the\r\n    unchained passions, in order that it might not form any exact\r\n    or complete opinion of the natural and proper limits of said\r\n    problem. Ah! it was better, in short, that the commission\r\n    should leave defeated in not having secured peace, and would\r\n    blame me and the other Filipinos, when I and the whole Filipino\r\n    people anxiously desired that peace should have been secured\r\n    before rather than now, but an honourable and worthy peace\r\n    for the United States and for the Philippine Republic.\" [442]\r\n\r\nThese statements, made to deceive the public, make interesting reading\r\nin the light of our present knowledge as to the purposes and plans\r\nof Aguinaldo and his associates.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Yokohama we were promptly informed by a secretary\r\nfrom the United States Legation that no less a personage than Marquis\r\nIto had been in frequent communication with the Filipinos since 1894,\r\nthat they had been looking to him for advice and support, and that\r\nhe had interested himself in the present situation sufficiently to\r\ncome to the American minister and offer to go to the Philippines,\r\nnot in any sense as an agent of the United States, but as a private\r\nindividual, and to use his influence in our behalf. His contention\r\nwas that the then existing conditions resulted from misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nHe said that Americans did not understand Asiatics, but he was an\r\nAsiatic himself and did understand the Filipinos, and thought that he\r\ncould settle the whole affair. The minister had cabled to Washington\r\nfor instructions. Naturally the offer was not accepted.\r\n\r\nI was reminded, by this extraordinary incident, of a previous\r\noccurrence. I spent the month of March, 1893, in Tokio when returning\r\nfrom my second visit to the Philippines, and was kindly invited to\r\ninspect the zoölogical work at the Imperial University. When I visited\r\nthe institution for that purpose, I was questioned very closely on\r\nthe islands, their people and their resources. The gentlemen who\r\ninterrogated me may have been connected with the university, but I\r\ndoubt it.\r\n\r\nWe reached Hongkong on February 22. Here I had an interview with\r\nDr. Apacible of the junta, while Mr. Schurman visited Canton. Apacible\r\ntold me that the Filipinos wanted an independent republic under an\r\nAmerican protectorate. Pressed for the details of their desires, he\r\nsaid that \"the function of a protector is to protect.\" Further than\r\nthat he could not go. I tried to convince him of the hopelessness\r\nof the course the Filipinos were then pursuing and of the kindly\r\nintentions of my government, but felt that I made no impression on him.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Manila on March 4, 1899, too late to land. Firebugs were\r\nabroad. We watched a number of houses burn, and heard the occasional\r\ncrackle of rifle fire along the line of the defences around the\r\ncity. The next morning there was artillery fire for a time at San\r\nPedro Macáti. Everywhere were abundant evidences that the war was on.\r\n\r\nThis left little for us to do at the moment except to inform ourselves\r\nas to conditions, especially as Colonel Denby had not yet arrived,\r\nand General Otis was overwhelmed with work and anxiety.\r\n\r\nI renewed my acquaintance with many old Filipino and Spanish friends\r\nand improved the opportunity, not likely to recur in my experience,\r\nto see as much as possible of the fighting in the field.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was at San Pedro Macáti, Captain Dyer, who commanded\r\na battery of 3.2-inch guns there, suggested that if I wished to\r\ninvestigate the effect of shrapnel fire I could do so by visiting\r\na place on a neighbouring hillside which he indicated. Acting upon\r\nhis suggestion, I set out, accompanied by my private secretary, who,\r\nlike myself, was clad in white duck. The Insurgent sharpshooters on\r\nthe other side of the river devoted some attention to us, but we knew\r\nthat so long as they aimed at us we were quite safe. Few of their\r\nbullets came within hearing distance.\r\n\r\nWe were hunting about on the hillside for the place indicated by\r\nCaptain Dyer, when suddenly we heard ourselves cursed loudly and\r\nfluently in extremely plain American, and there emerged from a\r\nneighbouring thicket a very angry infantry officer. On venturing to\r\ninquire the cause of his most uncomplimentary remarks, I found that he\r\nwas in command of skirmishers who were going through the brush to see\r\nwhether there was anything left there which needed shooting up. As\r\nmany of the Insurgent soldiers dressed in white, and as American\r\ncivilians were not commonly to be met in Insurgent territory, these\r\nmen had been just about to fire on us when they discovered their\r\nmistake. We went back to Manila and bought some khaki clothes.\r\n\r\nAt first my interest in military matters was not appreciated by my army\r\nfriends, who could not see what business I had to be wandering around\r\nwithout a gun in places where guns were in use. I had, however, long\r\nsince discovered that reliable first-hand information on any subject\r\nis likely to be useful sooner or later, and so it proved in this case.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks after we reached Manila there was no active military\r\nmovement; then came the inauguration of the short, sharp campaign\r\nwhich ended for the moment with the taking of Malolos. For long,\r\ntedious weeks our soldiers had sweltered in muddy trenches, shot at\r\nby an always invisible foe whom they were not allowed to attack. It\r\nwas anticipated that when the forward movement began, it would be\r\nactive. Close secrecy was maintained with regard to it. Captain\r\nHedworth Lambton, of the British cruiser _Powerful_, then lying\r\nin Manila Bay, exacted a promise from me that I would tell him if\r\nI found out when the advance was to begin, so that we might go to\r\nCaloocan together and watch the fighting from the church tower,\r\nwhich commanded a magnificent view of the field of operations.\r\n\r\nI finally heard a fairly definite statement that our troops would\r\nmove the following morning. I rushed to General Otis's office and\r\nafter some parleying had it confirmed by him. It was then too late to\r\nadvise Lambton, and in fact I could not properly have done so, as the\r\ninformation had been given me under pledge of secrecy. Accompanied\r\nby my private secretary, Dr. P. L. Sherman, I hastened to Caloocan,\r\nwhere we arrived just at dusk, having had to run the gantlet of\r\nnumerous inquisitive sentries _en route_.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night in the church, where General Wheaton and his staff\r\nhad their headquarters, and long before daylight were perched in\r\na convenient opening in its galvanized iron roof, made on a former\r\noccasion by a shell from Dewey's fleet.\r\n\r\nFrom this vantage point we could see the entire length of the line\r\nof battle. The attack began shortly after daylight. Near Caloocan\r\nthe Insurgent works were close in, but further off toward La Loma\r\nthey were in some places distant a mile or more from the trenches of\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of attack was that the whole American line should\r\nrotate to the north and west on Caloocan as a pivot, driving the\r\nInsurgents in toward Malabon if possible. The latter began to fire\r\nas soon as the American troops showed themselves, regardless of the\r\nfact that their enemies were quite out of range. As most of them were\r\nusing black-powder cartridges, their four or five miles of trenches\r\nwere instantly outlined. The ground was very dry so that the bullets\r\nthrew up puffs of dust where they struck, and it was possible to\r\njudge the accuracy of the fire of each of the opposing forces.\r\n\r\nRather heavy resistance was encountered on the extreme right, and\r\nthe turning movement did not materialize as rapidly as had been\r\nhoped. General Wheaton, who was in command of the forces about\r\nthe church, finally moved to the front, and as we were directly in\r\nthe rear of his line and the Insurgents, as usual, overshot badly,\r\nwe found ourselves in an uncomfortably hot corner. Bullets rattled\r\non the church roof like hail, and presently one passed through the\r\nopening through which Major Bourns, Colonel Potter, of the engineer\r\ncorps, and I were sticking our heads. Immediately thereafter we\r\nwere observed by Dr. Sherman making record time on all fours along\r\none of the framing timbers of the church toward its tower. There we\r\ntook up our station, and thereafter observed the fighting by peeping\r\nthrough windows partially closed with blocks of volcanic tuff. We\r\nhad a beautiful opportunity to see the artillery fire. The guns were\r\ndirectly in front of and below us and we could watch the laying of\r\nthe several pieces and then turn our field-glasses on the particular\r\nportions of the Insurgent trenches where the projectiles were likely to\r\nstrike. Again and again we caught bursting shells in the fields of our\r\nglasses and could thus see their effect as accurately as if we had been\r\nstanding close by, without any danger of being perforated by shrapnel.\r\n\r\nAfter the Insurgent position had been carried we walked forward\r\nto their line of trenches and followed it east to a point beyond\r\nthe La Loma Church, counting the dead and wounded, as I had heard\r\nwild stories of tremendous slaughter and wanted to see just how\r\nmuch damage the fire of our troops had really done. On our way we\r\npassed the Caloocan railroad station which had been converted into\r\na temporary field hospital. Here I saw good Father McKinnon, the\r\nchamplain of the First California Volunteers, assisting a surgeon\r\nand soaked with the blood of wounded men. He was one chaplain in a\r\nthousand. It was always easy to find him. One had only to look where\r\ntrouble threatened and help was needed. He was sure to be there.\r\n\r\nOn my way from the railway station to the trenches I met a very much\r\nexcited officer returning from the front. He had evidently had a long\r\nand recent interview with Cyrus Noble, [443] and was determined to\r\ntell me all about the fighting. I escaped from him after some delay,\r\nand with much difficulty. Later he remembered having met me, but\r\nmade a grievous mistake as to the scene of our encounter, insisting\r\nthat we had been together in \"Wheaton's Hole,\" an uncommonly hot\r\nposition where numerous people got hurt. He persisted in giving a\r\ngraphic account of our experiences, and in paying high tribute to\r\nmy coolness and courage under heavy fire. My efforts to persuade him\r\nthat I had not been with him there proved futile, and I finally gave\r\nup the attempt. I wonder how many other military reputations rest\r\nupon so slender a foundation! This experience was unique. I never\r\nsaw another officer under the influence of liquor when in the field.\r\n\r\nAt the time that we visited the Insurgent trenches, not all of our\r\nown killed and wounded had been removed, yet every wounded Insurgent\r\nwhom we found had a United States army canteen of water at his side,\r\nobviously left by some kindly American soldier. Not a few of the\r\ninjured had been furnished hardtack as well. All were ultimately\r\ntaken to Manila and there given the best of care by army surgeons.\r\n\r\nSometime later a most extraordinary account of this fight, written by a\r\nsoldier, was published in the _Springfield Republican_. It was charged\r\nthat our men had murdered prisoners in cold blood, and had committed\r\nall manner of barbarities, the writer saying among other things:--\r\n\r\n    \"We first bombarded a town called Malabon and then entered\r\n    it and killed every man, woman and child in the place.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts were briefly as follows: There was an Insurgent regiment in\r\nand near a mangrove swamp to the right of this town. When it became\r\nobstreperous it was shelled for a short time until it quieted down\r\nagain. None of the shells entered the town. Indeed, most of them\r\nstruck in the water. Our troops did not enter Malabon that day,\r\nbut passed to the northward, leaving behind a small guard to keep\r\nthe Insurgents from coming out of Malabon in their rear. Had they\r\nthen entered the town, they would not have found any women, children\r\nor non-combatant men to kill for the reason that all such persons\r\nhad been sent away some time before. The town was burned, in part,\r\nbut by the Insurgents themselves. They fired the church and a great\r\norphan asylum, and did much other wanton damage.\r\n\r\nBeing able to speak from personal observation as to the occurrences of\r\nthat day, I sent a long cablegram direct to the _Chicago Times-Herald_\r\nstating the facts. After my return to the United States, President\r\nMcKinley was kind enough to say to me that if there had been no\r\nother result from the visit of the first Philippine Commission to the\r\nislands than the sending of that cablegram, he should have considered\r\nthe expense involved more than justified. He added that the country\r\nwas being flooded at the time with false and slanderous rumours,\r\nand people at home did not know what to believe. The statements of\r\narmy officers were discounted in advance, and other testimony from\r\nsome unprejudiced source was badly needed.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1899, Colonel Denby arrived, and our serious work\r\nbegan. The fighting continued and there was little that we could\r\ndo save earnestly to strive to promote friendly relations with the\r\nconservative element among the Filipinos, and to gather the information\r\nwe had been instructed to obtain.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1899, we issued a proclamation setting forth in clear and\r\nsimple language the purposes of the American government. [444] It was\r\ntranslated into Tagálog and other dialects and widely circulated. The\r\nInsurgent leaders were alert to keep the common people and the soldiers\r\nfrom learning of the kindly purposes of the United States. They were\r\nforbidden to read the document and we were reliably informed that\r\nthe imposition of the death penalty was threatened if this order was\r\nviolated. In Manila crowds of Filipinos gathered about copies of the\r\nproclamation which were posted in public places. Many of them were\r\nsoon effaced by Insurgent agents or sympathizers.\r\n\r\nThis document unquestionably served a very useful purpose. [445]\r\nFor one thing, it promptly brought us into much closer touch with\r\nthe more conservative Filipinos.\r\n\r\nWe soon established relations of friendliness and confidence with men\r\nlike Arellano, Torres, Legarda and Tavera, who had left the Malolos\r\ngovernment when it demonstrated its futility, and were ready to turn\r\nto the United States for help. Insurgent sympathizers also conferred\r\nfreely with us. We were invited to a beautiful function given in our\r\nhonour at the home of a wealthy family, and were impressed, as no one\r\ncan fail to be, with the dignified bearing of our Filipino hosts,\r\na thing which is always in evidence on such occasions. We gave a\r\nreturn function which was largely attended and greatly aided in the\r\nestablishment of relations of confidence and friendship with leading\r\nFilipino residents of Manila.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos were much impressed with Colonel Denby. He was a handsome\r\nman, of imposing presence, with one of the kindest hearts that ever\r\nbeat. They felt instinctively that they could have confidence in him,\r\nand showed it on all occasions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we lost no opportunity to inform ourselves as to\r\nconditions and events, conferring with Filipinos from various parts\r\nof the archipelago and with Chinese, Germans, Frenchmen, Belgians,\r\nAustrians, Englishmen, Spaniards and Americans. Among the witnesses\r\nwho came before us were farmers, bankers, brokers, merchants,\r\nlawyers, physicians, railroad men, shipowners, educators and public\r\nofficials. Certainly all classes of opinion were represented, and\r\nwhen we were called upon by the President, a little later, for a\r\nstatement of the situation we felt fully prepared to make it.\r\n\r\nBlount has charged that the commission attempted to interfere with the\r\nconduct of the war, and cites a cablegram from General Otis stating\r\nthat conferences with Insurgents cost soldiers' lives in support of\r\nthis contention. No conference with Insurgent leaders was ever held\r\nwithout the previous knowledge and approval of the general, who was\r\nhimself a member of the commission.\r\n\r\nLate in April General Luna sent Colonel Arguelles of his staff to ask\r\nfor a fifteen days' suspension of hostilities under the pretext of\r\nenabling the Insurgent congress to meet at San Fernando, Pampanga,\r\non May 1, to discuss the situation and decide what it wanted to\r\ndo. He called on the commission and urged us to ask Otis to grant\r\nthis request, but we declined to intervene, and General Otis refused\r\nto grant it.\r\n\r\nMabini continued Luna's effort, sending Arguelles back with letters to\r\nOtis and to the commission. In the latter he asked for \"an armistice\r\nand a suspension of hostilities as an indispensable means of arriving\r\nat peace,\" stating explicitly that the Philippine government \"does not\r\nsolicit the armistice to gain a space of time in which to reënforce\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nThe commission again referred Arguelles to General Otis on the matter\r\nof armistice and suspension of hostilities. We suspected that the\r\nstatement that these things were not asked for in order to gain time\r\nwas false, and this has since been definitely established.\r\n\r\nTaylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"On April 11 Mabini wrote to General Luna (Exhibit 719) that\r\n    Aguinaldo's council was of the opinion that no negotiations\r\n    for the release of the Spanish prisoners should be considered\r\n    unless the American Commission agreed to a suspension of\r\n    hostilities for the purpose of treating, not only in regard\r\n    to the prisoners, but for the purpose of opening negotiations\r\n    between Aguinaldo's government and the American authorities.\r\n\r\n    \"'In arriving at this decision we have been actuated by the\r\n    desire to gain time for our arsenals to produce sufficient\r\n    cartridges, if, as would seem to be probable, they persist in\r\n    not even recognizing our belligerency, as means for furthering\r\n    the recognition of our independence.'\" [446]\r\n\r\nArguelles, on his return, was instructed to ask Otis for a--\r\n\r\n    \"general armistice and suspension of hostilities in all the\r\n    archipelago for the short space of three months, in order to\r\n    enable it to consult the opinion of the people concerning\r\n    the government which would be the most advantageous,\r\n    and the intervention in it which should be given to the\r\n    North American Government, and to appoint an extraordinary\r\n    commission with full powers, to act in the name of the\r\n    Philippine people.\" [447]\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis naturally again declined to grant the request for a\r\nsuspension of hostilities.\r\n\r\nLittle came of the conference between Arguelles and the commission,\r\nexcept that we really succeeded in convincing him of the good\r\nintentions of our government, and this promptly got him into very\r\nserious trouble, as we shall soon see. I took him to a tent hospital\r\non the First Reserve Hospital grounds where wounded Insurgents were\r\nreceiving the best of treatment at the hands of American surgeons,\r\nand he was amazed. He had been taught to believe that the Americans\r\nmurdered prisoners, raped women, and committed similar barbarities\r\nwhenever they got a chance. As we have seen, stories of this sort\r\nwere industriously spread by many of the Insurgent leaders among\r\ntheir soldiers, and among the common people as well. They served\r\nto arouse the passions of the former, and stirred them up to acts\r\nof devilish brutality which they might perhaps not otherwise have\r\nperpetrated. Arguelles told the truth upon his return, and this,\r\ntogether with his suggestion that it might be well to consider the\r\nacceptance of the form of government offered by the United States,\r\nnearly cost him his life. Relative to this matter Taylor says:--\r\n\r\n    \"When Arguelles returned to the insurgent lines, it must have\r\n    been considered that he had said too much in Manila. While he\r\n    had been sent there to persuade the Americans to agree to a\r\n    suspension of hostilities to be consumed in endless discussion\r\n    under cover of which Luna's army could be reorganized, he had\r\n    not only failed to secure the desired armistice, but had come\r\n    back with the opinion that it might after all be advisable\r\n    to accept the government proposed by the United States. On\r\n    May 22 General Luna ordered his arrest and trial for being in\r\n    favour of the autonomy of the United States in the Philippine\r\n    Islands. He was tried promptly, the prosecuting witness\r\n    being another officer of Luna's staff who had accompanied\r\n    him to Manila and acted as a spy upon his movements (P.I.R.,\r\n    285. 2). The court sentenced him to dismissal and confinement\r\n    at hard labor for twelve years. This did not satisfy Luna's\r\n    thirst for vengeance, and he was imprisoned in Bautista on the\r\n    first floor of a building whose second story was occupied by\r\n    that officer. One night Luna came alone into the room where\r\n    he was confined and told him that although he was a traitor,\r\n    yet he had done good service to the cause; and it was not\r\n    proper that a man who had been a colonel in the army should\r\n    be seen working on the roads under a guard. He told him that\r\n    the proper thing for him to do was to blow his brains out,\r\n    and that if he did not do it within a reasonable time the\r\n    sentinel at his door would shoot him. He gave him a pistol\r\n    and left the room. Arguelles decided not to kill himself,\r\n    but fully expected that the guard would kill him. Shortly\r\n    afterwards Luna was summoned to meet Aguinaldo, and never\r\n    returned. On September 29, 1899, his sentence was declared\r\n    null and void and he was reinstated in his former rank (P.I.R.,\r\n    285. 3, and 2030. 2).\" [448]\r\n\r\nColonel Arguelles has told me exactly the same story. For a time it\r\nseemed as if the views expressed by him might prevail.\r\n\r\n    \"According to Felipe Buencamino and some others, the\r\n    majority of the members of congress had been in favour of\r\n    absolute independence until they saw the demoralization of\r\n    the officers and soldiers which resulted in the American\r\n    occupation of Malolos. In the middle of April, 1899, they\r\n    remembered Arellano's advice, and all of the intelligent\r\n    men in Aguinaldo's government, except Antonio Luna and the\r\n    officers who had no desire to lay down their military rank,\r\n    decided to accept the sovereignty of the United States. At\r\n    about the same time copies of the proclamation issued by the\r\n    American Commission in Manila reached them and still further\r\n    influenced them toward the adoption of this purpose. By the\r\n    time congress met in San Isidro on May 1, 1899, all of the\r\n    members had accepted it except a few partisans of Mabini,\r\n    then president of the council of government. At its first\r\n    meeting the congress resolved to change the policy of war with\r\n    the United States to one of peace, and this change of policy\r\n    in congress led to the fall of Mabini and his succession by\r\n    Paterno. The first act of the new council was the appointment\r\n    of a commission headed by Felipe Buencamino which was to go\r\n    to Manila and there negotiate with the American authorities\r\n    for an honourable surrender.\" [449]\r\n\r\n    \"Although Mabini had fallen from power, Luna and his powerful\r\n    faction had still to be reckoned with. He was less moderate\r\n    than Mabini, and had armed adherents, which Mabini did not, and\r\n    when Paterno declared his policy of moderation and diplomacy\r\n    he answered it on the day the new council of government was\r\n    proclaimed by an order that all foreigners living in the\r\n    Philippines except Chinese and Spaniards, should leave for\r\n    Manila within forty-eight hours.\" [450]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Luna intercepted the Buencamino commission. Its head\r\nhe kicked, cuffed and threatened with a revolver. One of its members\r\nwas General Gregorio del Pilar. He was allowed to proceed, as he\r\ncommanded a brigade of troops which might have deserted had he been\r\nbadly treated, but Luna named three other men to go with him in place\r\nof those who had been originally appointed. [451] They were Gracio\r\nGonzaga, Captain Zialcita, and Alberto Baretto. They reached Manila\r\non May 19, 1899, and during their stay there had two long interviews\r\nwith the commission.\r\n\r\nThey said that they had come, with larger powers than had been\r\nconferred on Arguelles, to discuss the possibility of peace, the\r\nform of ultimate government which might be proposed in future, and\r\nthe attitude of the United States government toward needed reforms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on May 4, we had laid before the President a plan of\r\ngovernment informally discussed with Arguelles, and had received the\r\nfollowing reply, authorizing, in substance, what we had suggested:--\r\n\r\n    \"Washington, May 5, 1899, 10.20 P.M.\r\n\r\n    \"Schurman, Manila:\r\n\r\n    \"Yours 4th received. You are authorized to propose that\r\n    under the military power of the President, pending action of\r\n    Congress, government of the Philippine Islands shall consist\r\n    of a governor-general, appointed by the President; cabinet,\r\n    appointed by the governor-general; a general advisory council\r\n    elected by the people; the qualifications of electors to be\r\n    carefully considered and determined; the governor-general\r\n    to have absolute veto. Judiciary strong and independent;\r\n    principal judges appointed by the President. The cabinet\r\n    and judges to be chosen from natives or Americans, or both,\r\n    having regard to fitness. The President earnestly desires the\r\n    cessation of bloodshed, and that the people of the Philippine\r\n    Islands at an early date shall have the largest measure of\r\n    local self-government consistent with peace and good order.\r\n\r\n    \"_Hay_.\" [452]\r\n\r\nOur proclamation of April 4, 1899, was also taken up at their request\r\nand was gone over minutely, sentence by sentence. We were asked to\r\nexplain certain expressions which they did not fully understand.\r\n\r\nThey told us that it would be hard for their army to lay down its\r\narms when it had accomplished nothing, and asked if it could be taken\r\ninto the service of the United States. We answered that some of the\r\nregiments might be taken over and employment on public works be found\r\nfor the soldiers of others.\r\n\r\nWe endeavoured to arrange for an interview with Aguinaldo, either\r\ngoing to meet him or assuring him safe conduct should he desire to\r\nconfer with us at Manila.\r\n\r\nThey left, promising to return in three weeks when they had had time\r\nto consider the matters under discussion, but they never came back.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter there was an odd occurrence. Soon after our\r\narrival we had learned that Mr. Schurman was a man of very variable\r\nopinions. He was rather readily convinced by plausible arguments,\r\nbut sometimes very suddenly reversed his views on an important subject.\r\n\r\nAt the outset Archbishop Nozaleda made a great impression upon\r\nhim. The Archbishop was a thoroughgoing Spaniard of the old school,\r\nand entertained somewhat radical opinions as to what should be done\r\nto end the distressing situation which existed. After talking with\r\nhim Mr. Schurman seemed to be convinced that we ought to adopt a\r\nstern and bloody policy, a conclusion to which Colonel Denby and I\r\ndecidedly objected.\r\n\r\nA little later he made a trip up the Pasig River with Admiral Dewey\r\nand others and had a chance to see something of the aftermath of\r\nwar. It was not at all pretty. It never is. I was waiting for him\r\nwith a carriage at the river landing on his return and had hard work\r\nto keep him away from the cable office. His feelings had undergone a\r\ncomplete revulsion. He insisted that if the American people knew what\r\nwe were doing they would demand that the war be terminated immediately\r\nat any cost and by whatsoever means, and he wanted to tell them all\r\nabout it at once. By the next morning, however, things fortunately\r\nlooked rather differently to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurman acquired a working knowledge of the Spanish language\r\nwith extraordinary promptness. Shortly thereafter Colonel Denby and\r\nI discovered that when Filipinos came to see the commission in order\r\nto impart information or to seek it, he was conferring with them\r\nprivately and sending them away without our seeing them at all.\r\n\r\nSoon after we had made our formal statement of the situation to the\r\nPresident, Mr. Schurman had an interview with an Englishman who had\r\nbeen living in Insurgent territory north of Manila, from which he had\r\njust been ejected, in accordance with Luna's order. This man told\r\nhim all about the mistakes of the Americans and evidently greatly\r\nimpressed him, for shortly thereafter he read to us at a commission\r\nmeeting a draft of a proposed cablegram which he said he hoped we would\r\napprove. It would have stultified us, had we signed it, as it involved\r\nin effect the abandonment of the position we had so recently taken\r\nand a radical change in the policy we had recommended. Mr. Schurman\r\ntold us that if we did not care to sign it, he would send it as an\r\nexpression of his personal opinion. Colonel Denby asked him if his\r\npersonal opinion differed from his official opinion, and received an\r\naffirmative reply. We declined to approve the proposed cablegram,\r\nwhereupon he informed us that if his policy were adopted, he and\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo would settle things without assistance from us,\r\nand that otherwise he would resign. He inquired whether we, too,\r\nwould send a cable, and we told him certainly not, unless further\r\ninformation from us was requested. He sent his proposed message,\r\nin somewhat modified form, and received a prompt reply instructing\r\nhim to submit it to the full commission and cable their views.\r\n\r\nHe did submit it to Colonel Denby and myself at a regularly called\r\ncommission meeting, argued that in doing this he had obeyed the\r\nPresident's instructions, and vowed that he would not show it to\r\nGeneral Otis. I showed it to the General myself, allowing him to\r\nbelieve that I did so with Mr. Schurman's approval, and thus avoided\r\nserious trouble, as he had been personally advised from Washington\r\nof the instructions to Mr. Schurman. The General then joined with\r\nColonel Denby and myself in a cablegram setting forth our views,\r\nand so this incident ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurman did not resign, but thereafter we saw very little of\r\nhim. He made a hasty trip to the Visayas and the Southern Islands\r\nand sailed for the United States shortly after his return to Manila,\r\nbeing anxious to get back in time for the opening of the college year\r\nat Cornell.\r\n\r\nColonel Denby and I were instructed to remain at Manila, where we\r\nrendered such assistance as we could give, and continued to gather\r\ninformation relative to the situation, the country and the people. In\r\nthis latter work we were given invaluable help by Jesuit priests,\r\nwho prepared for us a comprehensive monograph embodying a very large\r\namount of valuable information, and furnished us a series of new maps\r\nas well. The latter were subsequently published by the United States\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey in the form of an Atlas of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nEarly in September we had a most interesting interview with Sr. José de\r\nLuzuriaga, a distinguished and patriotic Filipino from western Negros,\r\nwhere American sovereignty had been accepted without resistance. Up\r\nto that time it had been possible for the people of Negros to keep\r\nout Tagálog invaders. Sr. Luzuriaga assured us that so long as this\r\ncondition continued, there would be no trouble, and he was quite right.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's agents eventually gained a foothold there for a short time,\r\nand did some mischief, but it did not result very seriously.\r\n\r\nWe felt an especial interest in this island, as General Otis had\r\nasked us carefully to study and to criticise a scheme for its\r\ngovernment which had been drafted by General James F. Smith, who\r\nafterward became justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines,\r\nsecretary of public instruction and governor-general of the islands,\r\nand was then in command of the troops in Negros.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton arrived in the Philippines during our stay. His\r\ncoming had been eagerly looked forward to by the army. He had sailed\r\nwith the understanding that he was to be put in charge of field\r\noperations. While he was at sea, influences were brought to bear\r\nwhich changed this plan.\r\n\r\nIt is my firm conviction that if Lawton had been put in command, the\r\nwar would have ended promptly. He was a wonderful man in the field. He\r\npossessed the faculty of instilling his own tremendous energy into\r\nhis officers and men, whose privations and dangers he shared, thereby\r\narousing an unfaltering loyalty which stood him in good stead in time\r\nof need. If there was fighting to be done, he promptly and thoroughly\r\nwhipped everything in sight. He punished looting and disorder with\r\na heavy hand, treated prisoners and noncombatants with the utmost\r\nkindness, and won the good-will of all Filipinos with whom he came\r\nin contact.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur was always declaring that the Filipinos were a unit\r\nagainst us and that he could never get information from them. General\r\nLawton never lacked for such information as he needed, and constantly\r\nand successfully used the Filipinos themselves as messengers and for\r\nother purposes. I came to know him intimately, and learned to admire\r\nand love him as did all those who had that great privilege.\r\n\r\nFor some time I had charge of his spies. Never have men taken longer\r\nchances than did the faithful few who at this time furnished us with\r\ninformation as to events in Insurgent territory. Discovery meant prompt\r\nand cruel death. For a long time Major F. S. Bourns had performed the\r\nuncongenial task of directing the spies. He was then the chief health\r\nofficer of Manila, and as all sorts of people were compelled to consult\r\nhim on sanitary matters, visits to his office aroused no suspicion. He\r\nspoke Spanish, and this was imperatively necessary. Our spies simply\r\nwould not communicate results through interpreters. The facts revealed\r\nby the Insurgent records show how right they were in refusing to do so.\r\n\r\nMajor Bourns eventually returned to the United States. His work was\r\ntaken over by an army officer, with the result that two of our best\r\nmen died very suddenly in that gentleman's back yard. As I spoke\r\nSpanish, and as all sorts of people came to see the commission,\r\nI was the logical candidate for this job, which I thereupon inherited.\r\n\r\nEach morning, if there was news, I myself laboriously thumped out\r\nmy notes on the typewriter, making an original and one copy. The\r\ncopy I took at once to General Lawton. The original I took, later,\r\nto General Otis.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton was firmly convinced that most army officers were\r\nunfitted by their training to perform civil functions. He organized\r\nmunicipal governments with all possible promptness in the towns\r\noccupied by his troops, and in this work he requested my assistance,\r\nwhich I was of course glad to give. Sr. Felipe Calderon drafted a\r\nsimple provisional scheme of municipal government which I submitted\r\nfor criticism to that most distinguished and able of Filipinos,\r\nSr. Cayetano Arellano. [453] When the final changes in it had been\r\nmade, I accompanied General Lawton on a trip to try putting it into\r\neffect. We held elections and established municipal governments in a\r\nnumber of the towns just south of Manila, and in some of those along\r\nthe Pasig River.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis watched our operations and their results narrowly, and\r\nwas sufficiently well pleased with the latter to order General Kobbé\r\nto follow a similar course in various towns on or near the railroad\r\nnorth of Manila. Kobbé did not profess to know much about municipal\r\ngovernment, and asked me to go with him and help until he got the\r\nhang of the thing, which I did.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the first Philippine Commission had a sort of\r\nleft-handed interest in the first municipal governments established\r\nin the islands under American rule.\r\n\r\nIn his endeavour to show that the Commission interfered with military\r\noperations, Blount has ascribed certain statements to Major Starr. He\r\nsays: \" ... at San Isidro on or about November 8, Major Starr said:\r\n'We took this town last spring,' stating how much our loss had been in\r\nso doing, 'but partly as a result of the Schurman commission parleying\r\nwith the Insurgents, General Otis had us fall back. We have just had\r\nto take it again.'\" [454]\r\n\r\nIf Major Starr ever made such a statement he was sadly\r\nmisinformed. General Lawton was the best friend I ever had in the\r\nUnited States Army. I saw him almost daily when he was in Manila,\r\nand he showed me the whole telegraphic correspondence which passed\r\nbetween him and General Otis on the subject of the withdrawal from\r\nSan Isidro and Nueva Ecija, which was certainly one of the most\r\nill advised moves that any military commander was ever compelled to\r\nmake. General Lawton's unremitting attacks had absolutely demoralized\r\nthe Insurgent force, and my information is that when he finally\r\nturned back, Aguinaldo and several members of his cabinet were\r\nwaiting, ten miles away, to surrender to him when he next advanced,\r\nbelieving that they could never escape from him. I have not the\r\ntelegraphic correspondence before me, but I remember its salient\r\nfeatures. Otis ordered Lawton to withdraw, and Lawton, convinced of\r\nthe inadvisability of the measure, objected. Otis replied that, with\r\nthe rainy season coming on, he could neither provision him nor furnish\r\nhim ammunition. Lawton answered that he had provisions enough to last\r\nthree weeks and ammunition enough to finish the war, whereupon Otis\r\nperemptorily ordered him to withdraw. The Philippine Commission had\r\nno more to do with this matter than they had to do with the similar\r\norder against advancing which Otis sent Lawton on the day the latter\r\nwon the Zapote River fight, when the Insurgents were running all over\r\nthe Province of Cavite. Lawton wanted to push forward and clean the\r\nwhole place up. The reply to his request to be allowed to do so ran,\r\nif memory serves me well, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Do nothing. You have accomplished all that was expected\r\n    of you.\"\r\n\r\nLater on, Lawton and his devoted officers and men had to duplicate the\r\nfierce campaign which had resulted in the taking of San Isidro. This\r\nmade possible the movement that Lawton had had in mind in the\r\nfirst instance, which was made with the result that organized armed\r\nresistance to the authority of the United States promptly ceased in\r\nnorthern Luzón.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject I wish to record the fact that shortly after\r\nhis return from the San Isidro campaign General Lawton asked me to\r\naccompany him on a visit to General Otis and act as a witness. I\r\ndid so. In my presence Lawton said to Otis that if the latter would\r\ngive him two regiments, would allow him to arm, equip and provision\r\nthem to suit himself, and would turn him loose, he would stake his\r\nreputation as a soldier, and his position in the United States Army,\r\non the claim that within sixty days he would end the insurrection\r\nand would deliver to General Otis one Emilio Aguinaldo, dead or\r\nalive. The general laughed at his offer. General Lawton asked me\r\nsome day to make these facts public. As life is an uncertain thing,\r\nI deem it proper to do so now. Personally I am convinced that if his\r\noffer had been accepted he would have kept his promise.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1899, Colonel Denby and I sailed for the United\r\nStates, having been recalled to Washington. Shortly after our arrival\r\nthere the commission issued a brief preliminary report. The winter\r\nwas spent in the preparation of our final report, which constituted\r\na full and authoritative treatise on the islands, the people and\r\ntheir resources. Father José Algué, the distinguished head of the\r\nPhilippine Weather Bureau, was called to Washington to help us,\r\nand gave us invaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nOur preliminary report, dated November 2, 1899, and the first volume\r\nof our final report, published on January 31, 1900, contained our\r\nobservations and recommendations relative to political matters.\r\n\r\nMr. Schurman has been credited with saying in an address made on\r\nJanuary 11, 1902: \"Any decent kind of government of Filipinos by\r\nFilipinos is better than the best possible government of Filipinos\r\nby Americans.\" [455]\r\n\r\nOn November 2, 1900, he signed the following statement: [456]--\r\n\r\n    \"Should our power by any fatality be withdrawn, the\r\n    commission believe that the government of the Philippines\r\n    would speedily lapse into anarchy, which would excuse, if it\r\n    did not necessitate, the intervention of other powers and the\r\n    eventual division of the islands among them. Only through\r\n    American occupation, therefore, is the idea of a free,\r\n    self-governing, and united Philippine commonwealth at all\r\n    conceivable. And the indispensable need from the Filipino\r\n    point of view of maintaining American sovereignty over the\r\n    archipelago is recognized by all intelligent Filipinos and even\r\n    by those insurgents who desire an American protectorate. The\r\n    latter, it is true, would take the revenues and leave us the\r\n    responsibilities. Nevertheless, they recognize the indubitable\r\n    fact that the Filipinos cannot stand alone. Thus the welfare\r\n    of the Filipinos coincides with the dictates of national\r\n    honour in forbidding our abandonment of the archipelago. We\r\n    cannot from any point of view escape the responsibilities of\r\n    government which our sovereignty entails; and the commission\r\n    is strongly persuaded that the performance of our national\r\n    duty will prove the greatest blessing to the peoples of the\r\n    Philippine Islands.\"\r\n\r\nMore than fourteen years' experience in governmental work in the\r\nPhilippines has profoundly impressed me with the fundamental soundness\r\nof these conclusions of the first Philippine Commission. Every\r\nstatement then made still holds true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Civil Government\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Philippine Commission did not complete its work until March,\r\n1900. By this time conditions had so far improved in the archipelago\r\nthat President McKinley was prepared to initiate a movement looking\r\ntoward the establishment of civil government there. With this end in\r\nview he appointed the following commission of five civilians; William\r\nH. Taft of Ohio, Dean C. Worcester of Michigan, Luke E. Wright of\r\nTennessee, Henry C. Ide of Vermont and Bernard Moses of California. Our\r\nappointments were dated March 16, 1900. Our instructions which were\r\nfull, are given in the appendix. [457] I was the only member of the\r\nfirst commission to be reappointed. Neither General Otis nor Admiral\r\nDewey cared to serve, and indeed the professional duties of each\r\nof them rendered his appointment to the new commission difficult,\r\nif not impossible. Mr. Schurman had at one time expressed himself\r\nas vigorously opposed to the idea of a new commission, maintaining\r\nthat the best results could be obtained by the appointment of a civil\r\ngovernor with wide powers. It was therefore taken for granted that he\r\nwould not desire reappointment. Colonel Denby was keenly interested\r\nin the work and would have been glad to continue it, but he was past\r\nseventy and with his good wife had then spent some fifteen years\r\nin the Far East. He doubted whether his strength would be adequate\r\nto bear the strain of the arduous task which obviously lay before\r\nthe new commission, and Mrs. Denby desired to remain in the United\r\nStates where she could be near her children from whom she had been\r\nlong separated, so her husband felt constrained to say that he did\r\nnot wish to return to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nI separated from him with the keenest regret. He was an amiable,\r\ntactful man of commanding ability and unimpeachable integrity, actuated\r\nby the best of motives and loyal to the highest ideals. He constantly\r\nsought to avoid not only evil but the appearance of evil. I count it\r\none of the great privileges of my life to have been associated with\r\nhim. The one thing in the book written by James H. Blount which aroused\r\nmy ire was his characterization of Colonel Denby as a hypocrite. No\r\nfalser, meaner, more utterly contemptible statement was ever made,\r\nand when I read it the temptation rose hot within me to make public\r\nBlount's personal Philippine record, but after the first heat of\r\nanger had passed I remembered what the good old Colonel would have\r\nwished me to do in such a case, and forbore.\r\n\r\nThe second Philippine commission, hereinafter referred to as \"the\r\ncommission,\" received its instructions on April 7, 1900.\r\n\r\nThey covered a most delicate and complicated subject, namely, the\r\ngradual transfer of control from military to civil authority in a\r\ncountry extensive regions of which were still in open rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of President McKinley there was no reason why steps\r\nshould not be taken, from time to time, to inaugurate governments\r\nessentially popular in their form as fast as territory came under\r\nthe permanent control of our troops, and indeed, as we have seen,\r\nthis had already been done by the army. It was provided that we\r\nshould continue and perfect the work of organizing and establishing\r\ncivil governments already commenced by the military authorities. In\r\ndoing this we were to act as a board of which Mr. Taft was designated\r\npresident. It was contemplated that the transfer of authority from\r\nmilitary commanders to civil officers would be gradual, and full and\r\ncomplete coöperation between these authorities was enjoined. Having\r\nfamiliarized ourselves with the conditions then prevailing in the\r\nislands, we were to devote our attention first to the establishment\r\nof municipal governments, in which the natives should be given the\r\nopportunity to manage their local affairs to the fullest extent and\r\nwith the least supervision and control found to be practicable. We were\r\nthen to consider the organization of larger administrative divisions,\r\nand when of the opinion that the condition of affairs in the islands\r\nwas such that the central administration could safely be transferred\r\nfrom military to civil control were to report this conclusion to the\r\nsecretary of war with our recommendations as to the form of central\r\ngovernment which should be established.\r\n\r\nBeginning with September 1, 1900, we were authorized to exercise,\r\nsubject to the approval of the President and the secretary of war, the\r\nlegislative power, which was then to be transferred from the military\r\ngovernor to us until the establishment of civil central government,\r\nor until Congress should otherwise provide. We were authorized during\r\na like period to appoint to office such officers under the judicial,\r\neducational, and civil service systems, and in the municipal and\r\ndepartmental governments, as were duly provided for. Until the\r\ncomplete transfer of control the military governor was to remain the\r\nchief executive head of the government and to exercise the executive\r\nauthority previously possessed by him and not expressly assigned to\r\nthe commission by the president in his instructions. In establishing\r\nmunicipal governments we were to take as the basis of our work those\r\nestablished by the military governor, under the order of August 8,\r\n1899, which I had helped to set up, as well as those established\r\nunder the report of a board constituted by the military governor by\r\nhis order of January 29, 1900, of which Señor Cayetano Arellano was\r\nthe president.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of departmental or provincial governments we\r\nwere to give special attention to the then-existing government of the\r\nisland of Negros, established with the approval of the people of that\r\nisland under the order of the military governor of July 22, 1899.\r\n\r\nWe were instructed to investigate troubles growing out of large land\r\nholdings, including those of the religious orders, and to promote,\r\nextend and improve the system of education already inaugurated by\r\nthe military authorities, giving first importance to the extension\r\nof a system of primary education free to all, which would tend to fit\r\nthe people for the duties of citizenship and the ordinary avocations\r\nof a civilized community. Instruction was to be given at first in\r\nthe native dialects, but full opportunity for all of the people to\r\nacquire English was to be provided as soon as possible. If necessity\r\ndemanded, we were authorized to make changes in the existing system\r\nof taxation and in the body of the laws under which the people were\r\ngoverned, although such changes were to be relegated to the civil\r\ngovernment which we were to establish later, so far as might be. Our\r\ninstructions contained the following important passages:--\r\n\r\n    \"In all the forms of government and administrative provisions\r\n    which they are authorized to prescribe, the commission should\r\n    bear in mind that the government which they are establishing\r\n    is designed not for our satisfaction, or for the expression\r\n    of our theoretical views, but for the happiness, peace and\r\n    prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands, and the\r\n    measures adopted should be made to conform to their customs,\r\n    their habits, and even their prejudices, to the fullest\r\n    extent consistent with the accomplishment of the indispensable\r\n    requisites of just and effective government.\r\n\r\n    \"At the same time the commission should bear in mind, and the\r\n    people of the islands should be made plainly to understand,\r\n    that there are certain great principles of government which\r\n    have been made the basis of our governmental system which\r\n    we deem essential to the rule of law and the maintenance of\r\n    individual freedom, and of which they have, unfortunately,\r\n    been denied the experience possessed by us; that there are\r\n    also certain practical rules of government which we have\r\n    found to be essential to the preservation of these great\r\n    principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and\r\n    these rules of government must be established and maintained\r\n    in their islands for the sake of their liberty and happiness,\r\n    however much they may conflict with the customs or laws of\r\n    procedure with which they are familiar.\r\n\r\n    \"It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the\r\n    Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of\r\n    these principles and rules, and they will inevitably within\r\n    a short time command universal assent. Upon every division\r\n    and branch of the government of the Philippines, therefore,\r\n    must be imposed these inviolable rules:--\r\n\r\n    \"That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or\r\n    property without due process of law; that private property\r\n    shall not be taken for public use without just compensation;\r\n    that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the\r\n    right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the\r\n    nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with\r\n    the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for\r\n    obtaining witnesses in his favour, and to have the assistance\r\n    of counsel for his defence; that excessive bail shall not be\r\n    required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\r\n    punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice in\r\n    jeopardy for the same offence, or be compelled in any criminal\r\n    case to be a witness against himself; that the right to be\r\n    secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not\r\n    be violated; that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\n    shall exist except as a punishment for crime; that no bill\r\n    of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed; that no\r\n    law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech or of the\r\n    press, or the rights of the people to peaceably assemble and\r\n    petition the Government for a redress of grievances; that no\r\n    law shall be made respecting the establishment of religion,\r\n    or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free\r\n    exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship\r\n    without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion in some quarters to sneer at the last of these\r\nparagraphs, and to insinuate, if not to charge, that President McKinley\r\nin his policy toward the Philippine Islands was actuated by unworthy\r\nmotives. Nothing could be further from the truth. From the beginning\r\nto the end the real good of the several peoples of the archipelago\r\ncame first with him, and no one who had the privilege of knowing him\r\nwell doubts it. Thoroughly imbued with the lofty sentiments expressed\r\nby him in our instructions, we set forth on our long pilgrimage to a\r\ncountry where we were to undertake a heavy task essentially different\r\nfrom that which had ever before fallen to the lot of any five citizens\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1900, we sailed from San Francisco on the United\r\nStates army transport _Hancock_. We were forty-five strong. Of\r\nthis goodly company only four remain in the Philippines to-day,\r\n[458]--Mr. and Mrs. Branagan, Mrs. Worcester and myself. Singularly\r\nenough, with two exceptions, all of the others are still alive\r\nand at work. Arthur W. Ferguson, prince of interpreters, who was\r\nlater appointed Executive Secretary, died in the service after more\r\nthan six years of extraordinarily faithful and efficient work. James\r\nA. LeRoy, my faithful, able and efficient private secretary, contracted\r\ntuberculosis, and fell a victim to it after a long and gallant fight.\r\n\r\nAt Honolulu we met with a severe disappointment. It was of course\r\nour duty to call on Governor Dole. We were advised that silk hats\r\nand frock coats must be donned for this visit, and it was perishing\r\nhot. We reached the palace in a reeking perspiration and had a long\r\nwait in a suffocating room. When Mr. Dole appeared, he was closely\r\nfollowed by an attendant bearing a large and most attractive-looking\r\nbottle carefully wrapped in a napkin, and our spirits rose. But,\r\nalas! It contained Poland water.\r\n\r\nAt Tokio we had an audience with the Emperor and were received by the\r\nEmpress as well. In the high official who had charge of the palace\r\nwhere these events took place, I discovered an old University of\r\nMichigan graduate who made the occasion especially pleasant for me.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached Manila on the morning of June 3. Although the\r\nthermometer was in the nineties, a certain frigidity pervaded the\r\natmosphere on our arrival, which General MacArthur, the military\r\ngovernor, seemed to regard in the light of an intrusion.\r\n\r\nHe had been directed to provide suitable office quarters for us. To\r\nour amazement and amusement we found desks for five commissioners\r\nand five private secretaries placed in one little room in the\r\nAyuntamiento. [459] While it was possible to get through the room\r\nwithout scrambling over them, it would have been equally possible\r\nto circle it, walking on them, without stepping on the floor. In\r\nthe course of our first long official interview with the General,\r\nhe informed us that we were \"an injection into an otherwise normal\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nHe added that we had already mediatized the volume of work that flowed\r\nover his desk. At the moment none of us were quite sure what he meant,\r\nbut we found the word in the dictionary. How often in the weary\r\nyears that were to follow I wished that some one would materially\r\nmediatize the task which fell to my lot! It was General MacArthur's\r\nhonestly held and frankly expressed opinion that what the Filipinos\r\nneeded was \"military government pinned to their backs for ten years\r\nwith bayonets.\" He later changed that view very radically, and when\r\ncivil provincial governments were finally established it was with\r\nhis approval, and, in many instances, upon his specific recommendation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset some effort was made to keep the public away from\r\nus. Word was passed that we had no authority, which was true enough,\r\nas our legislative activities were not to begin until September\r\n1. The ninety days which intervened were very advantageously spent in\r\ngaining familiarity with the situation, which we had no difficulty\r\nin doing. Plenty of people were already weary of military rule and\r\nflocked to us. None of my companions had ever before set foot in the\r\nPhilippines, and although I had spent more than four years there,\r\nI still had plenty to learn.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I am reminded of an event which occurred somewhat\r\nlater. While the commission was en route from Iloilo to Catbalogan\r\nwhen we were establishing civil provincial governments, General Hughes\r\nand Mr. Taft became involved in a somewhat animated discussion. The\r\nGeneral displayed an accurate knowledge of facts which were of such\r\na nature that one would hardly have expected an army officer to be\r\nfamiliar with them. Mr. Taft said: \"General, how do you do it? You\r\nhave always been a busy man, devoted to your profession. How have you\r\nmanaged to accumulate such a remarkable fund of information?\" The\r\nGeneral smiled his rare smile and replied: \"Governor, I will tell\r\nyou. I always try to go to bed at night knowing a little more than\r\nI did when I got up in the morning.\" It is a wise plan to follow.\r\n\r\nOn September 1 we assumed the legislative power, our first official\r\nact being to appropriate $2,000,000 Mexican for the construction and\r\nrepair of highways and bridges.\r\n\r\nWe were impressed with the fundamental necessity of promptly opening up\r\nlines of land communication in a country which almost completely lacked\r\nthem, and there were many poor people in dire need of employment who\r\nwould be relieved by the opportunity to earn an honest living which\r\nthe inauguration of road construction would afford them.\r\n\r\nOur second act appropriated $5000 Mexican for the purpose of making\r\na survey to ascertain the most advantageous route for a railroad into\r\nthe mountains of Benguet, where we wished to establish a much-needed\r\nhealth resort for the people of the archipelago.\r\n\r\nSeven days later we passed an act for the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of an efficient and honest civil service in the Philippine\r\nIslands. This measure was of basic importance. We had stipulated before\r\nleaving Washington that no political appointees should be forced upon\r\nus under any circumstances. The members of the second commission, like\r\ntheir predecessors of the first, were firm in the belief that national\r\npolitics should, if possible, be kept out of the administration of\r\nPhilippine affairs, and we endeavoured to insure this result.\r\n\r\nOur tenth act appropriated $1500 Mexican to be paid to the widow\r\nof Salvador Reyes, vice-president of Santa Cruz in Laguna Province,\r\nassassinated because of his loyalty to the established government.\r\n\r\nOur fifteenth act increased the monthly salaries of Filipino public\r\nschool teachers in Manila.\r\n\r\nOur sixteenth and seventeenth acts reorganized the Forestry Bureau\r\nand the Mining Bureau.\r\n\r\nOn October 15 we appropriated $1,000,000 United States currency,\r\nfor improving the port of Manila, where there was urgent need of\r\nprotection for shipping during the typhoon season.\r\n\r\nOn December 12 we passed an act authorizing the establishment of local\r\npolice in cities and towns in the Philippine Islands and appropriating\r\n$150,000 United States currency for their maintenance.\r\n\r\nTwo days later we passed a much-needed act regulating the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors within the city of Manila and its attached\r\nbarrios.\r\n\r\nOn December 21, we appropriated $75,000 United States currency for\r\nthe construction of the Benguet Road, little dreaming how much time\r\nwould elapse and how many more dollars would be appropriated, before\r\na vehicle passed over it.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficiently evident that I cannot here give an account\r\nof the several acts which we passed when I say that they number four\r\nhundred forty-nine during the first year. We created the administrative\r\nbureaus of a well-organized government, established civil rule in\r\nnumerous municipalities and provinces, provided for the necessary\r\nexpenses of government, organized courts and reformed the judiciary. So\r\nimportant were the results following the establishment of the Civil\r\nService Act and the act providing for the organization of courts for\r\nthe Philippine Islands that I have devoted a chapter to each.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were no limits on our power to enact legislation other\r\nthan those imposed by our instructions hereinbefore referred to,\r\nnothing was further from our desire than to exercise too arbitrarily\r\nthe authority conferred upon us.\r\n\r\nTaylor has correctly described our method of procedure in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n    \"On September 1, 1900, the Commission began its legislative\r\n    and executive duties. In performing them it adopted the policy\r\n    of passing no laws, except in cases of emergency, without\r\n    publishing them in the daily press, nor until after they\r\n    had passed a second reading and the public had been given\r\n    an opportunity to come before the Commission and suggest\r\n    objections or amendments to the bills. Before enacting\r\n    them they were submitted to the military governor for his\r\n    consideration and comment.\" [460]\r\n\r\nThe other especially important events of our first legislative\r\nyear were the establishment of civil rule in the municipalities\r\nas well as in thirty-eight provinces and the substitution of the\r\nmilitary central government by the gradual creation of bureaus and\r\nthe ultimate appointment of a civil governor and of five heads of\r\nexecutive departments.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1900, we passed an act providing for the establishment\r\nof a civil government in the province of Benguet, and thus it happened\r\nthat a province practically all of whose inhabitants were members of\r\na non-Christian tribe was the first to enjoy the benefits of civil\r\nrule. This action grew out of investigations by General Wright and\r\nmyself made when visiting Baguio during the latter part of July, which\r\nled us to the conclusion that civil government could be established in\r\nBenguet at any time and should be established as soon as possible. In\r\nview of the rather primitive state of civilization of the people for\r\nwhom we were legislating, a special act adapted to local conditions\r\nwas passed providing for a provincial government and fixing a form\r\nof government for the several settlements.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1901, we passed an act for the organization of municipal\r\ngovernments in the Philippine Islands which, with various amendments,\r\nis still in effect and has been made applicable to all municipal\r\ncorporations of the Philippines inhabited chiefly by Filipinos, except\r\nthe city of Manila, the city of Baguio and a few small settlements\r\nin the so-called special government provinces. [461]\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 1901, we passed a general act for the organization of\r\nprovincial governments in the Philippine Islands. A special act was\r\nrequired to make it applicable to any given province.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared for the serious work of establishing civil\r\ngovernment throughout the archipelago so fast and so far as conditions\r\nmight seem to justify, we determined to visit the several provinces\r\nand to familiarize ourselves with conditions on the ground in each\r\ncase before taking action. We invariably sought the opinion of\r\nthe military authorities as to the fitness of the provinces under\r\nconsideration for civil rule, and never established it except with\r\ntheir approval. Indeed, in several cases we yielded to their judgment\r\nand organized provinces which we ourselves thought might better wait\r\nfor a time.\r\n\r\nOur first trip was to the northward along the line of the\r\nManila-Dagupan railway, and in the course of it we organized the\r\nprovinces of Bulaean, Pampanga, Tarlac and Pangasinán.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March we crossed Manila Bay to Bataan and established\r\na civil provincial government there.\r\n\r\nThe first provincial officers were necessarily appointed, not\r\nelected. I well remember the consternation which Mr. Taft created\r\non this trip, when in announcing the appointment of a man of strong\r\ncharacter who was much disliked by some of the people present, he\r\nsaid that if the appointee did not behave well his official head\r\nwould be promptly removed. Surprise showed on almost every face in\r\nthe audience. They had become sufficiently accustomed to the idea of\r\nbeing beheaded or otherwise sent out of the world by their own people,\r\nbut had been led to believe that the Americans were a humane nation,\r\nand it took Mr. Taft at least five minutes to explain his joke.\r\n\r\nDuring the second week in March the commission transferred its officers\r\nbodily to the United States Army Transport _Sumner_ and started on\r\na long journey in the course of which it visited and established\r\nprovincial governments in eighteen provinces, [462] returning to\r\nManila on the 3d of May.\r\n\r\nThis trip was most interesting but dreadfully wearing. Everywhere\r\nwe were overwhelmed by the hospitality of our Filipino friends. We\r\narrived at some new place nearly every morning, and the programme in\r\neach was much the same. After an early breakfast we hurried ashore,\r\ndrove or walked about for a short time to see what the town was like,\r\nand then attended a popular meeting in its largest building, where\r\nwe held long and frank converse with the people on local conditions,\r\ngiving them every opportunity to air their views, with the result that\r\nthe local orators, of whom there were usually more than a sufficiency,\r\nhad an opportunity to bring their heavy guns into action. Then followed\r\na recess in the course of which we partook of a very elaborate lunch,\r\nand when possible conferred privately with influential men, often\r\nlearning things which they did not care to tell us in public. Then came\r\nanother open meeting at which the actual organization of the province\r\nwas effected and the officials were appointed and sworn in. After\r\nthis there was a long formal dinner, with the endless courses which\r\ncharacterize such functions in the Philippines, and then came a ball\r\nwhich lasted till the wee small hours. When at last we got on board,\r\ntired out, our steamer sailed, and often brought us to some new place\r\nby sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn several instances we did not pass the act organizing a given\r\nprovince at the time of our visit, but for one reason or another\r\npostponed action until a later date. We visited a number of places\r\nlike Joló, Basilan, Zamboanga, Cotabato, Davao and Samar, where we\r\nhad no intention of establishing civil government, in order to observe\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\nWe touched at Marinduque on our trip south, and found that nothing\r\ncould then be done there, but the better element were anxious for a\r\nchange, and we promised them that if they would bring about certain\r\nspecified results before our return we would give them a provincial\r\ngovernment. They undertook to do so, and kept their word. Needless\r\nto say we also kept ours.\r\n\r\nWe had grave doubts as to the advisability of establishing civil\r\ngovernments in Cebú, Bohol and Batangas. In the first of these\r\nplaces the people were sullen and ugly. In the second there was\r\na marked disinclination on the part of leading citizens to accept\r\npublic office. There had been a little scattering rifle fire on the\r\noutskirts of the capital of the third very shortly before our arrival\r\nthere, but the organization of all these provinces was recommended by\r\nthe military authorities, and we decided to try an experiment which\r\ncould do little harm, as we could return any one of them to military\r\ncontrol in short order should such a course seem necessary.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made to make it appear that in organizing Cebú,\r\nBohol and Batangas, we acted prematurely and upon our own initiative,\r\nthus complicating the situation for the military authorities. I will\r\nlet Blount voice this complaint. He says in part:--\r\n\r\n    \"In his report for 1901 Governor Taft says that the four\r\n    principal provinces, including Batangas, which gave trouble\r\n    shortly after the civil government was set up in that year,\r\n    and had to be returned to military control, were organized\r\n    under civil rule 'on the recommendation' of the then commanding\r\n    general (MacArthur). It certainly seems unlikely that the haste\r\n    to change from military rule to civil rule came on the motion\r\n    of the military. If the Commission ever got, _in writing,_\r\n    from General MacArthur, a 'recommendation' that any provinces\r\n    be placed under civil rule while still in insurrection, the\r\n    text of the writing will show a mere soldierly acquiescence in\r\n    the will of Mr. McKinley, the commander-in-chief. Parol [463]\r\n    contemporaneous evidence will show that General MacArthur\r\n    told them, substantially, that they were 'riding for a\r\n    fall.' In fact, whenever an insurrection would break out in\r\n    a province after Governor Taft's inauguration as governor,\r\n    the whole attitude of the army in the Philippines, from the\r\n    commanding general down was 'I told you so.' They did not\r\n    say this where Governor Taft could hear it, but it was common\r\n    knowledge that they were much addicted to damning 'politics'\r\n    as the cause of all the trouble.\" [464]\r\n\r\nProphecy is always dangerous and when unnecessary seems rather\r\ninexcusable. I submit the essential portions of the record to\r\nshow exactly what we did get from General MacArthur, and add the\r\nsuggestion that it was really hardly essential that he should make\r\nhis recommendations in writing, as he did, for the reason that he\r\nwas a gentleman and would not have repudiated a verbal recommendation\r\nonce made.\r\n\r\nOn February 5, 1901, Governor Taft wrote General MacArthur a letter\r\nclosing with the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n    \"As already communicated to you the purpose of the Commission\r\n    is to make a Southern trip on the 23rd of February, or as\r\n    soon thereafter as practicable, with the idea of arranging\r\n    for provincial governments there, and I am directed by the\r\n    Commission to request your opinion as to the provinces in\r\n    which provincial governments may be safely established. It is\r\n    understood that Panay, Romblon, Tayabas, and possibly one or\r\n    two of the Camarines are ready for this. What has been said\r\n    with reference to the Northern provinces applies to these,\r\n    but we shall communicate with you further as to the Southern\r\n    provinces when we have been advised as to the possibility of\r\n    securing a steamer.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 9, General MacArthur gave the following instructions to\r\nthe Commanding General, Department of the Visayas:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Military Governor desires that you report to this\r\n    office at the earliest date practicable the provinces in your\r\n    department that may be considered ready for the establishment\r\n    of civil governments therein and in this connection directs\r\n    me to say that it should not be considered as necessary that\r\n    complete pacification has been brought about in a province\r\n    before reporting it as ready for such government; that the\r\n    provincial civil governments to be established will doubtless\r\n    prove useful agents in the further work of pacification.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 27, that officer reported that in his opinion Iloilo,\r\nCapiz, Oriental Negros and Occidental Negros were ready; that Antique\r\nmight be in a few days, and that Cebú, Bohol and Leyte were not. These\r\nfacts were reported to Governor Taft by General MacArthur on March 4,\r\nand on the same day Lieutenant-Colonel Crowder wrote to the commanding\r\ngeneral of the Visayas:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Military Governor directs me to say that he regards\r\n    the initiation of provincial civil government as an aid in\r\n    the work of pacification, in which view it is not necessary\r\n    that a province should be completely pacified as a condition\r\n    to the initiation of such government. He has expressed to the\r\n    Commission the opinion that you may be able, upon their arrival\r\n    at Iloilo, to submit a supplementary list of provinces in which\r\n    it would be advisable to establish at once these governments.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General MacArthur wrote on February 13, to Governor Taft:--\r\n\r\n    \"In partial reply to your letter of the 5th instant I have the\r\n    honor to inform you that the Commanding General, Department of\r\n    Southern Luzon, reports but one province, Tayabas, as ready at\r\n    the present time for civil government. I add the provinces of\r\n    Laguna, Batangas and Cavite, believing that the institution of\r\n    civil government in all these provinces will be in assistance\r\n    of the military authorities in the work of pacification.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur's communications seem to me to show something more\r\nthan \"a mere soldierly acquiescence in the will of Mr. McKinley,\"\r\nespecially as the President had no knowledge of these provinces, and\r\nnever made any recommendation whatsoever relative to the establishment\r\nof civil government there.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in establishing civil government in Cebu and Bohol, the\r\ncommission acted on the specific recommendation of the military, and\r\nrather against its own judgment. There seemed no very good reason for\r\nrefusing to try civil government, if the commanding general wanted\r\nit tried, and when it failed, as it promptly did, in Cebu, Bohol and\r\nBatangas, these provinces were immediately returned to the full control\r\nof the military, and left there until conditions became satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHaving escaped the perils of the deep, and the much graver perils of\r\nthe dinner table, during our southern trip, we returned to Manila,\r\nwearier, wiser and sadder men than when we started, for we had learned\r\nmuch of the superstitions, the ignorance and the obsessions which\r\nprevailed among the Filipinos, and we knew that many of the men who\r\nfrom love of country had accepted office under us had done so at the\r\nperil of their lives. We had all had an excellent opportunity to come\r\nto know the Filipinos. Their dignity of bearing, their courtesy,\r\ntheir friendly hospitality, their love of imposing functions, and\r\nof _fiestas_ and display, their childishness and irresponsibility\r\nin many matters, their passion for gambling, for litigation and for\r\npolitical intrigue, even the loves and the hatreds of some of them,\r\nhad been spread before us like an open book. It is a fact that except\r\nfor the inhabitants of Cebu, Bohol and Batangas, the people wanted\r\nwhat we had to give them and were grateful for it. Never before had\r\nthey had their day in court, and they appreciated it.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of civil government throughout so large a proportion\r\nof the provinces in the islands would have been impossible at this\r\ntime had it not been for the helpful activities of the Federal\r\nParty organized on December 23, 1900, by many of the best and most\r\ninfluential Filipinos in the archipelago for the purpose of aiding\r\nin the establishment of peace and order. Its members were tireless in\r\ntheir activities. They succeeded in persuading many Insurgent leaders\r\nto lay down their arms, so that a normal condition could be restored in\r\nterritory which the latter had previously harried. They convinced many\r\nof the common people of the true purposes of the American government,\r\nand in numerous other ways rendered invaluable services.\r\n\r\nThe officers and many of the members and agents of this party were\r\npromptly sentenced to death by Aguinaldo, and many of them were\r\nassassinated; [465] but the party persisted in its efforts until\r\nsuccess was attained.\r\n\r\nDuring June of 1901 Professor Moses and I made a horseback trip through\r\nPangasinán, La Union, Benguet, Lepanto and Ilocos Sur, accompanied by\r\nour private secretaries. Professor Moses was in wretched health as the\r\nresult of overwork and confinement, and needed out-of-door exercise.\r\n\r\nI had been intrusted with the drafting of legislation for the\r\ngovernment of the non-Christian tribes, and wanted to learn as much\r\nabout them as possible, so that I could act intelligently.\r\n\r\nWe started from Dagupan mounted on horses kindly furnished us by the\r\narmy, and escorted by four mounted infantrymen. None of us had ridden\r\nfor years, and army officers were offering wagers that we would not\r\nget as far as Baguio. At Mangaldan a cavalry outfit replaced our\r\nmounted infantrymen, and while the members of our new escort were\r\nresting under the shade of a tree in the cemetery, I heard them\r\nvoicing joyful anticipations of the easy time they were to have\r\ntravelling with tenderfeet. I made up ray mind to give them some\r\nhealthful exercise on the trip.\r\n\r\nHaving first visited the work at the lower end of the Benguet Road and\r\nthen travelled across country in a driving storm over wretched trails,\r\nwe reached Bauang, our point of departure for the interior. Here I\r\ncalled the sergeant in charge and asked him where were the extra shoes\r\nfor our horses. In some confusion he confessed that he had brought\r\nnone, whereupon I read him a homily on the duties of a cavalryman,\r\nand sent the whole outfit to San Fernando to get the horses reshod\r\nand provided with extra shoes for the trip.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Baguio in a howling typhoon. When we emerged from the\r\nhills into the open, and our horses got the full sweep of the storm,\r\nthey at first refused to face it. We forced them into it, however,\r\nand a few moments later had found refuge in the house of Mr. Otto\r\nScheerer, a hospitable German. The cavalrymen and the horses got in\r\nunder the building. It gave me great joy to hear through the floor\r\nthe voice of the sergeant remarking, with much emphasis of the sort\r\nbest represented in print by dashes, that if he had known the sort\r\nof a trip he was starting on he would have been on sick report the\r\nmorning of his departure.\r\n\r\nWe waited in vain three days for the storm to end and then rode\r\non. Mr. Scheerer, who accompanied us, had sent ahead to arrange for\r\nlunch at the house of a rich Igorot named Acop, but when we arrived at\r\nthis man's place, soaked, cold, and hungry, we found it shut up. He\r\nhad not received the message and was away from home. Investigation\r\nshowed that our only resource in the commissary line were some\r\nwads of sticky, unsalted, boiled rice which our Igorot carriers had\r\ninside their hats, in contact with their frowsy hair. We bolted as\r\nmuch of this as the Igorots could spare, killing its rather high\r\nflavour with cayenne peppers picked beside the trail, and continued\r\nour journey. In descending a steep hill my horse stumbled and while\r\nattempting to recover himself drove a sharp stone into his hoof and\r\nturned a complete somersault, throwing me over his head on to the\r\nrocks. When I got him up he was dead lame, and I walked the rest of\r\nthe way to Ambuklao, where we arrived just at sunset.\r\n\r\nThis once prosperous little Igorot hamlet had been burned by the\r\nSpaniards, for no apparent reason, during their flight from the\r\nprovince in 1906, and we found only two houses standing. They were\r\nnaturally crowded. I was so dead with fatigue that I threw my saddle on\r\nthe ground, and using it as a pillow, lay down in a couple of inches\r\nof water and fell sound asleep. Later the Igorots vacated one of the\r\nhouses, and placed it at our disposal. I spent the greater part of the\r\nnight in a contest with an old Igorot woman, who for the commendable\r\npurpose of keeping us warm tended a smoky pitch-pine fire, and shut\r\nthe door, which afforded our only means of ventilation, every time I\r\ndropped asleep. Awakened by the stifling smoke I would open it again,\r\nbut as soon as I dozed she would shut it. I finally solved the problem\r\nby lying down with my head sticking out of the door.\r\n\r\nThe next day was bright and clear. We rested until noon, drying\r\nout our belongings meanwhile, and then continued our journey,\r\nvisiting the Igorot settlements on the Agno River and those in\r\nsouthern Lepanto and finally reaching Cervantes, the capital of that\r\nsub-province. The Igorots of Benguet and Lepanto received us with\r\nthe utmost friendliness, and when not in danger of breaking our necks\r\nby falling over the edges of the wretched trails, we greatly enjoyed\r\nour trip.\r\n\r\nAt Cervantes we were met by a delegation of Bontoc Igorots, who begged\r\nus to visit their country, and we were just preparing to do so when\r\nwe received a telegram recalling us to Manila to be present at the\r\ninauguration of Mr. Taft as civil governor. During our absence the\r\ncommission had established provincial governments in Rizal, Cavite and\r\nNueva Ecija. Mr. Taft was inaugurated on July 4, 1901. Thenceforth\r\nhe exercised control over the provinces where civil government had\r\nbeen established, while the military governor continued in charge\r\nof each of the remaining provinces until it was duly organized and\r\ntransferred to civil control.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1901, the commission sailed on a tour of the remaining\r\nnorthern provinces, visiting La Union, Ilocos Sur, Abra, Ilocos Norte,\r\nCagayan, Isabela and Zambales in the order named, and establishing\r\na government in each. On the trip to Abra those members of the\r\ncommission not previously accustomed to roughing it in the islands\r\nwere given a novel experience, for we went up the Abra River on\r\nbamboo rafts. However, a veritable ship of state had been prepared\r\nfor Governor Taft, and no one suffered any great discomfort.\r\n\r\nAt Vigan, the capital of Ilocos, we narrowly escaped drowning in the\r\nsurf when returning to our steamer. For a time our good _viray_ [466]\r\nwith some twenty oarsmen was unable to make headway through the rolling\r\nwaves. It broached to, nearly filled with water, and struck the bottom\r\nheavily several times. Some of the men quit rowing and began to pray,\r\nwhereupon General J. F. Bell, who was sitting in the stern, rose to his\r\nfeet, and shouted at them until they became more afraid of him than of\r\nthe sea, and pulled for dear life until we were out of danger. Upon\r\narrival at the ship we watched with interest the progress of other\r\nboats through the surf, and were alarmed to see the men in one madly\r\ndivesting themselves of their clothing. When it finally came alongside\r\nits occupants made flying leaps for the gangway, and we discovered\r\nthat a great hole had been knocked in its bottom, and that raincoats,\r\nordinary coats, and trousers had been jammed into this opening in\r\norder to keep the rapidly sinking craft afloat for a few moments.\r\n\r\nIn the Cagayan valley we had a taste of real tropical heat. Never\r\nhave I seen a man suffer more than did Mr. Taft at Ilagan on the day\r\nwhen we established a provincial government for Isabela, and the night\r\nthat followed still lingers in my memory. The air was suffocating. My\r\nbed was in a corner. I dragged it out between a window and a door\r\nand threw both wide open. Still I could not sleep. Slipping off\r\nmy pajamas, I seated myself on the broad window sill. The heat was\r\nintolerable. I poured water over myself and resumed my seat in the\r\nwindow. The water would not evaporate. I sat there until morning,\r\nas I could not endure the heat lying down.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions are unknown throughout the greater part of the\r\narchipelago, where cool sea breezes temper the heat at all times. In\r\nthe Cagayan valley an immense plain is bordered by ranges of high\r\nmountains to the east and the west. They seem to shut off both\r\nmonsoons to a considerable extent, and there very trying heat is by\r\nno means unusual.\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1901, the first day of the second year of actual\r\nservice of the commission, a complete central civil government was\r\nestablished. Commissioner Wright was appointed secretary of commerce\r\nand police; Commissioner Ide, secretary of finance and justice;\r\nCommissioner Moses, secretary of public instruction, and I myself\r\nsecretary of the interior. The commission was strengthened by the\r\naddition of three Filipino members: Señor Benito Legarda, Señor José\r\nR. de Luzuriaga, and Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera, all of whom were men\r\nof exceptional ability and had rendered distinguished service in the\r\nestablishment of peace and order.\r\n\r\nExcept for the addition of one more Filipino on July 6, 1908, the\r\norganization of the commission has remained unchanged up to the present\r\ntime, although there have been numerous changes in its personnel. The\r\ntask which lay before it was to enact a code of laws adapted to the\r\npeculiar conditions existing in the Philippines, and this was indeed\r\na herculean undertaking. Its members laboured unremittingly. Governor\r\nTaft and General Wright were towers of strength in the early days. The\r\nrest of us did what we could, and I, for one, am very proud of the\r\nresult. Certainly no one can ever claim that the commission was not\r\nindustrious. Before it finally ceased to be the legislative body of\r\nthe islands it had passed some eighteen hundred acts. Obviously,\r\nas it is not my purpose to write an encyclopedia of law, I cannot\r\ndiscuss them in detail, and must content myself with here barely\r\nmentioning a few of the more important results obtained, leaving the\r\nmore detailed discussion of some of them for later chapters.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that the additional bureaus necessary\r\nfor the work of the Insular government were created, and given\r\nproper powers. Civil government was gradually extended to the entire\r\narchipelago. [467] The criminal code was amended and supplemented\r\nby the passage of new laws. The administration of justice was\r\nreorganized and reformed. [468] An efficient native insular police\r\nforce was organized, and an admirable state of public order brought\r\nabout. [469] The health service was extended to the provinces, and\r\nhealth conditions were greatly improved throughout the islands. [470]\r\nBaguio was made accessible and became both the summer capital and\r\na health resort for the people of the islands. [471] The scientific\r\nwork of the government was cordinated, and efficiency and economy in\r\nits performance were insured. [472]\r\n\r\nPrimary and secondary schools were established throughout the islands,\r\nsupplemented by trade schools, and a normal school at Manila. [473]\r\nLegislation was enacted, and submitted to the President and to\r\nCongress, covering the disposition of public lands. [474] The purchase\r\nof extensive estates belonging to certain religious orders, and the\r\nsale of their holdings therein to tenants, was provided for. [475]\r\nFairly adequate legislation for the protection and development\r\nof the forest resources of the islands was enacted. [476] Means\r\nof communication by land and sea were greatly improved, and the\r\ndevelopment of commerce was thus stimulated. [477]\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that all of these things were done with a\r\nper capita taxation of about $2.24!\r\n\r\nAnother fundamentally important aid to the commercial development of\r\nthe islands was afforded by a radical reformation of the currency.\r\n\r\nThe islands under the sovereignty of Spain had their own distinct\r\nsilver coinage in peso, media peso, peseta and media peseta pieces.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Spanish government, hoping to check the heavy exportation\r\nof gold currency from the Philippines, passed a law prohibiting the\r\nimportation of Mexican dollars, but allowed the Mexican dollars then\r\nin the islands to continue to circulate as legal tender.\r\n\r\nWhen the American troops arrived, there were in circulation the\r\nSpanish-Philippine peso and subsidiary silver coins; Spanish pesos\r\nof different mintings; Mexican pesos of different mintings; Hongkong\r\ndollars, fractional silver coins from different Chinese countries,\r\nand copper coins from nearly every country in the Orient. Although a\r\nlaw had been passed prohibiting the introduction of Mexican dollars\r\ninto the islands, they were being constantly smuggled in. Fluctuations\r\nin the price of silver affected the value of the silver coins, and the\r\nmoney in common use was in reality a commodity, worth on any given day\r\nwhat one could get for it. These conditions affected most disastrously\r\nthe business interests of the islands. Merchants were forced to allow\r\nvery wide margins in commercial transactions, because they did not\r\nknow what their goods would actually cost them in local currency upon\r\narrival. The most important business of the local banks was in reality\r\nthat of exchange brokers and note shavers. They hammered the exchange\r\nrate down and bought silver, then boosted the rate skyward and sold.\r\n\r\nThe American army brought in a large amount of gold, but this did\r\nnot remain in circulation long, as it was exported by the different\r\nbusiness concerns, or hoarded.\r\n\r\nUnited States silver money had a limited circulation during the\r\nearly days of American occupation, but it passed at less than its\r\ntrue value. An effort was made under the military administration to\r\nkeep the ratio of exchange at two to one by the purchase from the\r\npublic of all United States currency offered at that rate to the banks.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the banks refused to carry private accounts in United\r\nStates currency, but when it was offered for deposit it was changed\r\ninto Mexicans with a heavy charge for the transaction, and an account\r\nopened in Mexican currency to the credit of the depositor. If the\r\ndepositor afterward desired to get United States currency, he gave a\r\ncheck for it at the then existing rate of exchange. Such conditions\r\nwere intolerable, and the commission passed an act making it an offence\r\nto refuse to accept for deposit the currency of the sovereign power,\r\nbut this did not remedy the fundamental difficulty. There came a\r\nheavy slump in the price of silver. The Insular government lost a\r\nvery large sum because of the decrease in value of its silver coin.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles A. Conant had been brought from the United States to make\r\na report on the feasibility of providing an American coinage for the\r\nislands. He recommended that the unit of value should be a peso,\r\nequivalent to fifty cents United States currency. Congress, by an\r\nact passed July 1, 1902, vested general authority over the coinage\r\nin the Philippine government, but the commission decided not to take\r\naction until more specific authority could be obtained from Congress,\r\nas the proposed reform was radical, and it was very important that the\r\nnew currency should at the outset command the confidence so essential\r\nto its success.\r\n\r\nAfter long discussion, Congress authorized, by an act passed March\r\n2, 1903, a new currency system based on a theoretical peso of 12.9\r\ngrains of gold 900 fine, equivalent to one-half of a United States\r\ngold dollar. The circulating medium was to be the Philippine silver\r\npeso, which was to be legal tender for all debts, public and private,\r\nand its value was to be maintained on a parity with the theoretical\r\ngold peso. For this purpose the creation of a gold standard, or gold\r\nreserve fund, was provided for, and this fund was to be maintained\r\nand could be used for no other purpose.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced in introducing the new currency\r\ninto the islands. The banks at first failed to give any assistance to\r\nthe government. The business men of Manila, and especially the Chinese,\r\ndiscounted the new Philippine peso, because it did not contain as\r\nmuch silver as did the Mexican dollar. They were quickly brought to\r\ntime, and given to understand where they stood if they discredited\r\nthe currency of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Philippine coins and the Mexican coins in circulation were\r\ncollected by the treasury and exported to the San Francisco mint,\r\nwhere they were reminted into new coins of the weight and fineness\r\nprescribed by law.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a gold standard fund to maintain the parity\r\nbetween the gold and silver dollar was quickly effected by the sale of\r\nexchange on the United States in accordance with the established law,\r\nat a cost estimated to be the same as the transportation of the gold\r\ncoin itself.\r\n\r\nThe army, by direction of the secretary of war, ceased to pay\r\nin United States money, and its paymasters were given credit at\r\nthe Insular Treasury, where they obtained the necessary funds in\r\nPhilippine currency.\r\n\r\nThe government also authorized, in addition to the coinage of silver,\r\nthe issuance of paper money in two, five, and ten peso notes. All of\r\nthe coins and bills were readily interchangeable with the United States\r\ncoins in common use, the dollar being worth two pesos, the half dollar\r\none peso, the twenty-five cent piece a half peso, the ten-cent piece\r\na peseta, the five-cent piece a media peseta and the cent two centavos.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the silver value of the new peso was such that when the\r\nprice of silver again rose, its bullion value was greater than its\r\nmoney value, and in consequence coins of this denomination were hoarded\r\nand exported. It proved necessary to prohibit their exportation,\r\nand to issue new coins of less bullion value, but this was the only\r\nreally serious difficulty attending a fundamental reform which put\r\nthe currency on a sound basis. The original pesos were recoined and\r\na handsome profit made on the transaction.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not lived in a country where the circulating medium\r\nis constantly fluctuating in value can fully appreciate the enormous\r\nbenefit conferred on the Philippine Islands by this important reform.\r\n\r\nAnother reform of far-reaching importance was the readjustment of the\r\nburden of taxation so that it should bear lightly on the necessities\r\nof life, and heavily on its luxuries. This was a complete reversal\r\nof the scheme which we found in force, under which wheat flour and\r\nkerosene oil paid very heavy import duties while cigars and champagne\r\nwere lightly taxed.\r\n\r\nWe imposed export taxes on certain products of the country. Such taxes\r\nare objected to by many political economists, but were approved of by\r\nthe Filipinos, who strongly opposed the imposition of a logical and\r\nvery necessary personal tax to provide funds for the construction\r\nand maintenance of highways and bridges. It is usually wise, when\r\npracticable, to obtain funds for necessary governmental purposes by\r\nthe imposition of taxes which are willingly paid.\r\n\r\nMr. Taft resigned the governorship of the Philippines to become\r\nsecretary of war, his resignation taking effect January 31, 1904. He\r\nhad performed a monumental work for the Filipinos, and for humanity at\r\nlarge, during his years of service in the islands, and carried with\r\nhim the good will of most of the people whom he had so faithfully,\r\nefficiently and self-sacrificingly served. He had at one time very\r\ngravely impaired his health by hard work, and when the opportunity\r\ncame to satisfy a lifelong ambition by accepting appointment as a\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States, he had passed\r\nit by, in order to perform his duty to the people of the Philippine\r\nIslands. As secretary of war, and as President of the United States,\r\nhe availed himself of every opportunity which these high offices\r\nafforded to help the Filipinos, and to increase the prosperity of\r\ntheir country. They have had no better friend, and no other friend\r\nwhom they have ever had has been so useful to them. One more proof\r\nof his real greatness is afforded by the fact that to-day, after\r\nbeing reviled by many Filipino politicians whom he befriended, who\r\nhave succeeded to a large degree in making the common people of the\r\nPhilippines consider him their enemy, his interest in the people of\r\nthe Islands is as keen, and his eagerness to help them is as great,\r\nas in the early days when they acclaimed him their deliverer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Luke E. Wright, a democrat of Memphis, Tennessee, was\r\nappointed by President Roosevelt civil governor in Mr. Taft's\r\nplace. He rendered his country and the Filipinos most distinguished\r\nservice. It is one thing to build up a great government, with numerous\r\npolitical appointments at one's disposal, and another to stand by and\r\nkeep it running smoothly and efficiently, when a lot of disappointed\r\npoliticians, who have seen their last hope of political preferment go\r\na-glimmering, are throwing sand into the bearings of the machine. This\r\nlatter class had begun to plot against Governor Taft before his\r\nresignation took effect, but their machinations were rendered fruitless\r\nby the wave of regret raised by his coming departure.\r\n\r\nThey now devoted themselves, with a good deal of success, to injuring\r\nGovernor Wright, who declined to be dictated to, in the matter of\r\nappointments, by the Federal Party, and aroused the ire of many\r\npoliticians by occasionally telling the Filipinos unpalatable but\r\nwholesome and necessary truths relative to their fitness for immediate\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wright, whose title had been changed from governor to\r\ngovernor-general on February 6, 1905, went on leave during the latter\r\npart of that year, fully expecting to return and resume his work\r\nin the Philippines, but the islands were not to see him again. He\r\nresigned, effective April 1, 1906, to become United States Ambassador\r\nto Japan. In my opinion, the acceptance of his resignation at this time\r\nwas one of the gravest mistakes ever made in the Philippine policy of\r\nthe United States. The islands were deprived of the services of a very\r\nable and distinguished man, thoroughly conversant with their needs,\r\nwho had the courage of his convictions, and whose convictions were\r\nthoroughly sound.\r\n\r\nCertain Filipino politicians openly boasted that they had secured his\r\nremoval, and they and their ilk were encouraged to put forth new and\r\npernicious efforts. Had General Wright returned to the islands much of\r\nthe political unrest from which they have since suffered would have\r\nbeen avoided. He was beloved by his associates, who felt a sense of\r\npersonal loss when they learned that the places which had known him\r\nin The Philippines would know him no more.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded for the brief period of five and a half months by\r\nJudge Henry C. Ide, vice-governor and secretary of finance and justice,\r\nwho had performed his duties while he was on leave. Judge Ide was a\r\nrepublican, from Vermont. He resigned on September 19, 1906.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by General James F. Smith, a democrat from California,\r\nwho had come to the islands as a colonel of volunteers, and had won\r\npromotion because of his valuable services in the Visayas, and more\r\nespecially in the island of Negros, where he had earned the good\r\nwill of the Filipinos by his tact and kindness. Later he had served,\r\nunwillingly, as head of the Manila custom house.\r\n\r\nHe was subsequently made a justice of the supreme court of the\r\nPhilippines. A lawyer by profession, he had resigned this position\r\nwith regret to accept appointment, on January 1, 1903, as secretary\r\nof public instruction. He did not desire the governor-generalship and\r\nmade a strong but unsuccessful effort to avoid accepting the position,\r\nwhich he finally took from a sense of duty. He was a good lawyer,\r\nwith a big heart, and a keen insight into human nature. He thoroughly\r\nunderstood the Filipinos, and he made an excellent governor-general. It\r\nwas during his term of office that the Philippine Legislature,\r\ncomposed of an upper appointive house, the Philippine Commission,\r\nand a lower elective house, the Philippine Assembly, met for the\r\nfirst time on October 16, 1907.\r\n\r\nI devote a separate chapter [478] to the Philippine Legislature and\r\nits work, so need not discuss it here. Suffice it to say that such\r\nsuccess as attended the work of this body during its inaugural, first\r\nand special sessions, was very largely due to the tactful influence\r\nof Governor-General Smith, who gave the speaker of the assembly\r\nmuch valuable, friendly counsel, and kept the two houses working in\r\ncomparative harmony. Having struggled through one session of the\r\nlegislature, Governor-General Smith felt at liberty to resign. He\r\ngreatly desired to leave the Philippine government service and return\r\nto the practice of his profession. His resignation was reluctantly\r\naccepted, about a year after he had tendered it, and he left the\r\nservice on November 10, 1909.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Vice-Governor W. Cameron Forbes, a republican\r\nfrom Massachusetts, who had accepted appointment as secretary of\r\ncommerce and police on June 15, 1904. A man of independent means,\r\nMr. Forbes entered the public service only because of the opportunity\r\nfor greater usefulness which was thus afforded him. He brought to\r\nbear on the problems which confronted him as secretary of commerce\r\nand police intelligence and ability of a very high order. Wide\r\npractical experience in the management of large business interests\r\nhad admirably fitted him to improve the organization and increase the\r\nefficiency of the insular police force, and to mature and carry out\r\nplans for bettering means of communication and otherwise facilitating\r\nand stimulating the normal, healthful commercial development of the\r\nislands. I have devoted several chapters to the discussion of the\r\nresults accomplished along these lines, [479] and will not attempt\r\nhere to enumerate them.\r\n\r\nLike all of his predecessors, he brought to the office of\r\ngovernor-general mature experience gained on the ground, having been\r\nin the service more than five years at the time of his promotion.\r\n\r\nAs governor-general, he not only retained his keen interest in the\r\nlarge problems which had previously engaged his attention, and laboured\r\nunceasingly and most successfully in the performance of the duties of\r\nhis new office, but took an especial interest in the development of\r\nthe summer capital, and in the work for the non-Christian peoples of\r\nthe islands, devoting a much greater amount of time and attention to\r\nfamiliarizing himself with the needs of this portion of the population\r\nthan had ever previously been given to it by any governor-general. He\r\nvisited the Moros and the Bukidnons in the south, and the Negritos,\r\nthe Benguet Igorots, the Lepanto Igorots, the Bontoc Igorots,\r\nthe Ilongots, the Ifugaos, the Kalingas, and both the wild and the\r\ncivilized Tingians, in the north, repeatedly inspecting the several\r\nsub-provinces of the Mountain Province.\r\n\r\nThrough his generosity in making proper grounds available, public\r\ninterest in outdoor sports was greatly stimulated at Manila and\r\nat Baguio, while his own participation in polo, baseball and golf\r\nwas a good example to Americans and Filipinos alike, in a country\r\nwhere vigorous outdoor exercise is very necessary to the physical\r\ndevelopment of the young and the preservation of the health of the\r\nmature. He was a true friend of the Filipinos, whom he genuinely liked\r\nand was always ready to assist. His personal influence was a powerful\r\nfactor in the success of the very important work carried on at the\r\nPhilippine Normal School and the Philippine Training School for Nurses.\r\n\r\nDuring his term of office the prosperity of the islands increased\r\nby leaps and bounds, public order became better than ever before\r\nin their history, and the efficiency of the civil service reached\r\nits maximum. No other governor-general ever drew so heavily on his\r\nprivate means in promoting the public good, and it was the irony\r\nof fate that he should have been accused, by certain irresponsible\r\nanti-imperialists, of using his public office to promote his private\r\ninterests. Near the end of his administration grossly and absurdly\r\nfalse charges were made against him on the floor of the House by\r\nRepresentative William A. Jones. As their falsity has been conclusively\r\nand finally shown, [480] I will not here lend importance to them\r\nby repeating them. No official has ever given any country a cleaner\r\nadministration than Governor-General Forbes gave the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIt was his fortune to be in office at the time of the change in the\r\nnational administration of the United States. After continuing to serve\r\nfor months with no sign from Washington as to whether his resignation\r\nwas desired, he was advised by the Chief of the bureau of insular\r\naffairs that the appointment of Mr. Francis Burton Harrison, who is a\r\nTammany Hall democrat, as his successor had been sent to the Senate,\r\n[481] and three days after its confirmation received a curt request\r\nfor his resignation to be effected in a week and a day. He was also\r\nrequested to employ servants for Mr. Harrison. Spaniards who read\r\non the public streets newspapers which printed this message were\r\nseen to tear them up and stamp on the pieces! Our Spanish friends\r\nare accustomed to expect courtesy in connection with the removal of\r\nfaithful and efficient public servants.\r\n\r\nAll other governors-general had taken the oath of office at\r\nManila. Mr. Harrison took it at Washington on September 2, 1913. He\r\nis the first American governor of the islands who has entered upon his\r\nhigh duties without previous experience in the country which he is to\r\ngovern, and he has as yet displayed little inclination to profit by\r\nthe experience of either Filipino or American administrative insular\r\nofficials of high rank. It is too soon to discuss any feature of his\r\nadministration other than his attitude toward the civil service,\r\nwhich I take up elsewhere, [482] and I can only express the hope\r\nthat when he has gained that knowledge which can come only through\r\npersonal observation on the ground, he will grow to be a wise, strong,\r\nconservative official.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of civil government in the Philippine Islands under\r\nAmerican rule was a gradual evolution up to the time of the assumption\r\nof control by Governor-General Harrison.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to follow in detail all of its successive stages,\r\nbut in closing this chapter will endeavour briefly to summarize the\r\nresults obtained up to that time.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines now have two delegates to the Congress of the United\r\nStates appointed by the legislature in accordance with the provision of\r\nSection 8 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902. Both are Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThe ranking executive officials of the insular government are a\r\ngovernor-general, a secretary of the interior, a secretary of finance\r\nand justice, a secretary of commerce and police and a secretary\r\nof public instruction. All of these officers are appointed by the\r\nPresident, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The secretary of\r\nfinance and justice is a Filipino; the other secretaries of departments\r\nare Americans.\r\n\r\nThere is a legislature composed of two houses known respectively as\r\nthe Philippine Commission and the Philippine Assembly. The Philippine\r\nCommission is composed of nine members; five are the governor-general\r\nand the four secretaries of department _ex officio_, and four are\r\nappointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Senate. Four\r\nof the members are Filipinos and five are Americans. [483]\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Assembly is composed of eighty-one elected members,\r\nall of whom are Filipinos. They represent thirty-four of the\r\nthirty-nine provinces into which the archipelago is divided. The two\r\nhouses of the legislature have equal powers. Neither has any special\r\nprivilege in the matter of initiating legislation, and affirmative\r\naction by both is required in order to pass it. The Moro Province,\r\nthe Mountain Province and the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Agusan\r\nare not represented in the assembly, nor are they subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the Philippine Legislature. The Philippine Commission\r\nalone has legislative jurisdiction over them, their population being\r\nlargely composed of Moros, or members of other non-Christian tribes.\r\n\r\nThe provinces may be divided into regularly organized provinces\r\ngoverned under the provincial government act, and specially organized\r\nprovinces, which include the Moro Province, the Mountain Province\r\nand the provinces of Mindoro, Palawan, Agusan and Nueva Vizcaya, of\r\nwhich the first is governed under a special law and the remaining four\r\nare governed under a different one known as \"The Special Provincial\r\nGovernment Act.\"\r\n\r\nRegularly organized provinces have a governor and a treasurer. The\r\ngovernor is elected, and the treasurer is appointed by the\r\ngovernor-general with the approval of the commission. These two\r\nofficials, with another known as the third member, constitute\r\na provincial board. The third member is elected. As the Filipinos\r\nusually elect to office men from among their own people, practically\r\nall of the elective provincial officers are Filipinos, as are ten\r\nof the appointive officers, it having been the policy to appoint\r\nFilipinos whenever possible.\r\n\r\nRegularly organized provinces are divided into municipalities\r\nwhich elect their own officers and control their own affairs for\r\nthe most part. Provincial treasurers have intervention in municipal\r\nexpenditures, which are approved in advance for each fiscal year,\r\nand municipal officers may be removed for misconduct by the\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\nAll officers of the six special government provinces are appointed\r\nby the governor-general with the approval of the commission.\r\n\r\nThere are four regularly organized municipalities in these provinces,\r\nbut the remainder of their territory is divided into townships,\r\nwhich elect their own officers, except their secretary-treasurers,\r\nwho are appointed by the provincial governor; and into _rancherias_ or\r\nsettlements, with all of their officials appointed by the provincial\r\ngovernor. This latter form of local government is confined to the\r\nmore primitive wild people.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary is independent. The details of its organization will\r\nbe found in Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nThree of the seven justices of the supreme court, including the chief\r\njustice, are Filipinos, as are approximately half of the judges of\r\nthe courts of first instance and practically all justices of the peace.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, 71 per cent\r\nof the employees in the classified civil service of the islands were\r\nFilipinos painstakingly trained for the positions to which they had\r\nbeen appointed.\r\n\r\nPrior to the American occupation, the Filipinos had practically no\r\nintervention in the government of their country.\r\n\r\nThe changes introduced in the twelve years since the establishment\r\nof civil government began are of a sweeping and radical nature. For\r\nreasons hereinafter fully set forth, I believe they have been somewhat\r\ntoo sweeping, and too radical. At all events, it is now certainly the\r\npart of wisdom carefully to analyze their results before going further.\r\n\r\nI deem the subject of the establishment of civil governmental control\r\nover the non-Christian tribes of the Philippines worthy of special\r\nconsideration. [484]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Civil Service\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the Philippine Commission left Washington, a clear understanding\r\nwas reached with the President and secretary of war to the effect that\r\nno political appointee whatsoever should under any circumstances be\r\nforced upon us. After arrival at Manila early attention was given to\r\nthe drafting of a civil service act by Mr. Taft, who was fortunate in\r\nhaving the assistance of Mr. Frank M. Kiggins, chief of the examining\r\ndivision of the United States Civil Service Commission. The passage\r\nof this act and its strict enforcement led to very favourable comment\r\nin the United States. In his first annual message President Roosevelt\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is important to have this system obtain at home, but\r\n    it is even more important to have it rigidly applied in our\r\n    insular possessions....\r\n\r\n    \"The merit system is simply one method of securing honest and\r\n    efficient administration of the government, and in the long\r\n    run the sole justification of any type of government lies in\r\n    its proving itself both honest and efficient.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Root also gave us his fullest support, calling attention to\r\nthe fact that the law which we had passed was of a very advanced type,\r\nand that under such circumstances as confronted us, the securing of\r\nthe best men available should outweigh, and indeed practically exclude,\r\nall other considerations.\r\n\r\nOur action met with the unqualified approval of organizations\r\nwhich especially interest themselves in the maintenance of clean\r\nand efficient public service, such as the Cambridge (Massachusetts)\r\nCivil Service Reform Association [485] and the National Civil Service\r\nReform League, whose committee on civil service in dependencies spoke\r\nin very high terms of existing conditions in the Philippines. [486]\r\n\r\nIn its first annual report the Civil Service Board called attention\r\nto some of the more important provisions of the Act in the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n    \"Competitive examinations must, whenever practicable, be\r\n    held for original entrance to the service, and promotions of\r\n    employees must also be based upon competitive examinations,\r\n    in which the previous experience and efficiency of employees\r\n    shall be given due consideration. The examinations for entrance\r\n    to the service must be held in the United States and in the\r\n    Philippine Islands, and applicants are required to be tested\r\n    in both English and Spanish.\r\n\r\n    \"Disloyalty to the United States of America as the supreme\r\n    authority in the Islands is made a complete disqualification\r\n    for holding office, and every applicant for admission to the\r\n    service must, before being admitted to examination, take the\r\n    oath of loyalty. By an amendment to the Civil Service Act on\r\n    January 26, 1901, it is further declared that all persons\r\n    in arms against the authority of the United States in the\r\n    Philippine Islands, and all persons aiding or abetting them,\r\n    on the first day of April, 1901, shall be ineligible to\r\n    hold office.\r\n\r\n    \"A minimum age limit of eighteen years and a maximum age\r\n    limit of forty years are fixed for those who enter the\r\n    lowest grades in the service. This avoids the difficulty\r\n    and embarrassment that would result from the admission of\r\n    men advanced in years to positions where the duties can be\r\n    better performed by younger and more energetic persons.\r\n\r\n    \"The Board is given authority to investigate matters\r\n    relative to the enforcement of the act and the rules, and is\r\n    empowered to administer oaths, to summon witnesses, and to\r\n    require the production of office books and records in making\r\n    such investigations. Without such a provision it would be\r\n    very difficult, if not impossible, to conduct satisfactory\r\n    investigations, but with the authority conferred by the act,\r\n    the Board can make a rigid inquiry into the facts of every\r\n    case arising under the act and the rules.\r\n\r\n    \"The act provides for the ultimate classification of all\r\n    positions in the service, from laborers to heads of bureaus and\r\n    offices, and the Board may, in its discretion, determine the\r\n    efficiency of those now in the service as well as those who may\r\n    enter hereafter through its examinations. This authority will\r\n    enable the Board to ascertain the fitness of all employees so\r\n    that only the most competent will be retained in the service.\r\n\r\n    \"As a check upon the illegal payment of salaries the act\r\n    provides that whenever the Board finds that a person has been\r\n    appointed in violation of its provisions or of the rules of\r\n    the Board, and so certifies to the disbursing and auditing\r\n    officers, such payments shall be illegal, and if payment is\r\n    continued the disbursing officer shall not receive credit\r\n    for the same and the auditing officer who authorizes the\r\n    payment shall be liable on his official bond for the loss to\r\n    the government.\"\r\n\r\nIn its third annual report the Civil Service Board mentioned the\r\nfollowing among its distinctive duties:--\r\n\r\n    \"All appointments to classified positions are required to\r\n    be made on a form prescribed by the Board, and the Board's\r\n    attestation is required in each case before the Civil Governor\r\n    or Secretary of Department will approve the appointment and\r\n    before the disbursing officer will pay any salary.\r\n\r\n    \"The papers in all cases of reduction, removal and enforced\r\n    resignation are required to be submitted to the Board for\r\n    recommendation before transmission to the Civil Governor or\r\n    Secretary of Department for final action.\r\n\r\n    \"The Board is required to keep a record of all unclassified as\r\n    well as classified employees in the Philippine civil service,\r\n    showing among other things date of appointment, original\r\n    position and salary, place of employment, all changes in\r\n    status and grade, and all accrued and sick leave granted.\r\n\r\n    \"From its service records the Board is required to compile\r\n    annually, for publication on January 1, a roster of the\r\n    officers and employees under the Philippine Government.\r\n\r\n    \"Applications from employees, classified and unclassified,\r\n    for accrued and sick leave for more than two days must be\r\n    made on a form prescribed by the Board and forwarded to it\r\n    for verification of service record and previous leave granted\r\n    and for recommendation before final action is taken by the\r\n    Civil Governor or Secretary of Department.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts from official reports clearly show that the act was\r\nindeed of a very advanced type, and if honestly enforced would of\r\nnecessity lead to the establishment and maintenance of \"an efficient\r\nand honest civil service,\" for which purpose it was enacted.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the insular government dispensed with boards as administrative\r\nagencies, and in accordance with this general policy, a bureau of\r\ncivil service with a director at its head was substituted for the\r\nCivil Service Board, thus securing greater administrative efficiency\r\nand increased economy.\r\n\r\nAt first the Civil Service Act applied to comparatively few positions,\r\nas only a few bureaus and offices had been created, but as the\r\ngovernment was organized and grew, the different bureaus and offices\r\nwere placed in the classified service, the acts organizing them leaving\r\nin the unclassified service positions to which in the judgment of\r\nthe commission the examination requirements of the act should not\r\napply. Ultimately these requirements were made applicable to the\r\ntreasurers of all municipalities and to all positions, including\r\nteachers, in the executive and judicial branches of the central\r\ngovernment, the provincial governments, and the governments of the\r\ncities of Manila and Baguio, except a few specifically excepted by\r\nlaw, which for the most part are unclassified or exempt in almost\r\nall governments, national, state and municipal, having civil service\r\nlaws. None of the states of the Union has such a widely extended\r\nclassification of its civil service.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the positions specifically placed in\r\nthe unclassified service by law and of appointments made by the\r\nPhilippine Commission, all positions in the Philippine civil service\r\nare classified and must be filled by appointees who have passed civil\r\nservice examinations. Neither the governor-general nor the Bureau of\r\nCivil Service can, by the promulgation of civil service rules, or in\r\nany other manner whatever, transfer any position from the classified\r\nto the unclassified service or except from examination any position\r\nin the classified service. Under most of the civil service laws of\r\nthe United States the President or the governor of the state has\r\nauthority to transfer positions from the non-classified or exempted\r\nclass to the competitive classified civil service or _vice versa_,\r\nthese powers sometimes leading to manipulation of the civil service\r\nrules for political purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, where emergencies, such as cholera epidemics,\r\nsometimes lead to the employment of large bodies of temporary\r\nemployees without examination, when the emergency has passed the\r\ntemporary employees have always been discharged; and no employee\r\nhas ever received classification without examination on account of\r\ntemporary service. This is in marked contrast to the practice in the\r\nUnited States, where large bodies of employees taken on for temporary\r\nservice due to emergencies, such as the war with Spain, are not\r\ninfrequently blanketed into the classified service without examination.\r\n\r\nIn its last annual report the board recommended that a number of\r\nofficial positions in the unclassified service be placed in the\r\nclassified service, and gave as a reason therefor that such action\r\nwould \"add to the attractiveness of the classified service by\r\nincreasing the opportunities therein for promotion to responsible\r\npositions.\" This recommendation was adopted by providing that all\r\nvacancies in the positions of heads and assistant heads of bureaus or\r\noffices and of superintendents shall be filled by promotion, with or\r\nwithout examination, in the discretion of the civil governor or proper\r\nhead of a department, of persons in the classified civil service,\r\nif competent persons are found therein.\r\n\r\nThis provision is an important and distinguishing feature of the\r\nPhilippine Civil Service Act. The federal civil service has none\r\ncomparable with it. It is of special value in that it induces young\r\nmen of exceptional ability and training to enter the lower grades,\r\nfor they have the certainty that faithful and efficient work will in\r\nthe end earn for them the highest positions.\r\n\r\nOn February 25, 1909, the director of civil service made the following\r\nstatement with respect to the observance of the law:--\r\n\r\n    \"A careful study of Act 5 and all acts amendatory thereof\r\n    will show that there has been no change in the policy adopted\r\n    by the Commission at the outset to extend the classified\r\n    service as widely as possible and to fill by promotion all\r\n    the higher positions so far as practicable. The provision\r\n    requiring the higher positions to be filled by promotion so\r\n    far as practicable has always been regarded by the Philippine\r\n    Commission, by this Bureau, and by others interested in\r\n    obtaining the best possible government service in the\r\n    Philippines as one of the most important provisions of the\r\n    Civil Service Act. It has been faithfully observed by all\r\n    Governors-General....With the exception of the positions\r\n    of Governor-General and Secretaries of Departments, the\r\n    Philippine Civil Service Act requires the highest positions\r\n    in the executive civil service, namely, chiefs and assistant\r\n    chiefs of Bureaus and Offices, to be filled by promotion from\r\n    the entire service in all cases except when in the opinion of\r\n    the appointing power there is no person competent and available\r\n    who possesses the qualifications required, and this provision\r\n    has been faithfully observed heretofore.\"\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the law by the commission has received the\r\nfollowing commendation from the executive committee of the National\r\nCivil Service Reform League:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have further to note with satisfaction the course of\r\n    the Philippine Commission, by which, if it be persevered in,\r\n    the merit system will be established in the Islands of that\r\n    archipelago at least as thoroughly and consistently as in any\r\n    department of government, Federal, State, or Municipal, in\r\n    the Union. This must be, in any case, regarded as a gratifying\r\n    recognition of sound principles of administration on the part\r\n    of the Commission, and justifies the hope that, within the\r\n    limits of their jurisdiction at least, no repetition of the\r\n    scandals of post-bellum days will be tolerated.\"\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the appointment of Governor-General Harrison the\r\nprovisions of the Civil Service Act and rules were firmly supported\r\nby all of the governors-general and secretaries of departments,\r\nand the annual reports of the governor-general uniformly expressed\r\nsatisfaction with their practical operation. Mr. Taft was always an\r\nenthusiastic supporter of the merit system.\r\n\r\nGovernor-General Forbes in his inaugural address made the following\r\nstatements:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is necessary that the civil service should be rigidly\r\n    maintained and its rules carefully observed. One very\r\n    distinguished Filipino has recently been appointed to\r\n    administrative control of one of the most important departments\r\n    of the Government, equal in rank to any executive position in\r\n    the Islands with the exception of the Executive head. In the\r\n    executive branch of the Government, the Filipinization of the\r\n    service must steadily continue. As vacancies occur Filipinos\r\n    will be gradually substituted for Americans as rapidly as\r\n    can be done without positive detriment to the service. At the\r\n    same time, care will be taken to provide a suitable career for\r\n    honest and capable Americans who have come out here in good\r\n    faith. They should know that during good behavior and efficient\r\n    performance of their duty they are secure in their positions,\r\n    and that when they desire to return to the United States an\r\n    effort will be made to place them in the civil service at home.\r\n\r\n    \"I want no better men than the present officers and employees\r\n    of the Government, Americans and Filipinos. They compare\r\n    favorably with any set of men I have ever seen both as regards\r\n    ability and fidelity to duty.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of the Civil Service Act the proportion of\r\nFilipinos employed has increased from 49 per cent, in 1903, to 71\r\nper cent in 1913, as is shown by the following table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n           Comparison of Percentages of Americans and\r\n                  Filipinos in the Service\r\n\r\n        =============================================\r\n                       |      NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\r\n             YEAR      |-----------------------------\r\n                       |    Americans |   Filipinos\r\n        ---------------------------------------------\r\n        1903 ......... |      51%     |      49%\r\n        1904 ......... |      49      |      51\r\n        1905 ......... |      45      |      55\r\n        1906 [487] ... |      -       |      -\r\n        1907 ......... |      40      |      60\r\n        1908 ......... |      38      |      62\r\n        1909 ......... |      38      |      62\r\n        1910 ......... |      36      |      64\r\n        1911 ......... |      35      |      65\r\n        1912 ......... |      31      |      69\r\n        1913 ......... |      29      |      71\r\n        =============================================\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first few years after the establishment of the government\r\nlarge numbers of Americans were appointed, as there were\r\ncomparatively few Filipino candidates with the necessary educational\r\nqualifications. During the last two years, 89 per cent of the persons\r\nappointed in the islands have been Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great increase in the number of Filipinos entering\r\nthe civil service examinations in English. Ten years ago 97 per cent\r\nof those examined took their examinations in Spanish, while during\r\nlast year 89 per cent of those examined took examinations in English,\r\nthe total number so examined being 7755. Almost all appointees\r\nfor ordinary clerical work are now Filipinos, but the supply of\r\nbookkeepers, stenographers, civil engineers, physicians, veterinarians,\r\nsurveyors, chemists, bacteriologists, agriculturists, horticulturists,\r\nconstabulary officers, nurses, electricians, mechanical engineers,\r\nand other scientific employees is still insufficient to meet the\r\ndemands of the service. Only one Filipino has passed the stenographer\r\nexamination in English since the organization of the government, and it\r\nis necessary each year to bring many American stenographers from the\r\nUnited States. A few Filipinos pass each year the junior stenographer\r\nexamination [488] and are able to fill some of the positions which\r\nwould formerly have required the appointment of Americans.\r\n\r\nThe salaries paid to executive officials, chiefs of bureaus and\r\noffices, chief clerks, and chiefs of divisions equal in many instances\r\nthose paid to officials occupying similar positions in the service\r\nof the United States government.\r\n\r\nIn the legislative branch the speaker receives $8000 per annum. Members\r\nof the Philippine Commission without portfolios receive $7500 per\r\nannum. Members of the Philippine Assembly receive $15 a day for each\r\nday in which the assembly is in session.\r\n\r\nIn the executive branch secretaries of departments receive $15,500\r\nper annum each, including $5000 received by them as members of the\r\nPhilippine Commission. The executive secretary receives $9000 per\r\nannum. The salaries of other bureau chiefs range from $2500 per annum\r\nto $7500.\r\n\r\nThe justices of the Philippine Supreme Court receive $10,000 per\r\nannum. Judges of courts of first instance receive from $4500 to $5500.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from an article by the chairman of the\r\nPhilippine Civil Service Board give information with respect to\r\nsalaries in the Philippine Islands, as compared with salaries paid\r\nin surrounding British and Dutch colonies:--\r\n\r\n    \"The salaries paid officials in all branches of the service\r\n    of the Straits Settlements are generally lower than those paid\r\n    in the Philippine civil service. In this connection, however,\r\n    it is only just to state that the population and extent of the\r\n    territory under British control, and the expenses of living,\r\n    are less than in the Philippines, while the difficulty of\r\n    the problems to be solved is not so great. The salaries paid\r\n    to natives who fill the lower grade positions in the civil\r\n    service of the Philippine Islands are three and four times\r\n    as great as the salaries paid to natives in similar classes\r\n    of work in the civil service of the British Malay colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"A study of the colonial civil service of the Dutch in\r\n    the islands of Java and Madura gives us somewhat different\r\n    results....\r\n\r\n    \"The matter of salaries is peculiarly interesting. The\r\n    comparison made above of the compensations received by the high\r\n    officials in the civil service of the English colonies and by\r\n    those in the Philippines does not hold good when applied to\r\n    the Dutch in Java. In fact, the salary of the Governor-General\r\n    of Java is somewhat remarkable in contrast with that of the\r\n    Civil Governor of the Philippines. As is well known, the latter\r\n    receives $20,000, while the salary of the Governor-General of\r\n    Java amounts to 132,000 gulden or something over $53,000. The\r\n    American official is given, in addition, free transportation\r\n    on all official investigations and free use of the governor's\r\n    palace, but not the cost of maintenance. On the other hand,\r\n    the Dutch governor is granted 51,000 gulden (about $21,500)\r\n    as personal and household expenses and travel pay.\r\n\r\n    \"The general secretary of the government receives 24,000\r\n    gulden ($9648), as compared with the executive secretary\r\n    of the Philippine government, whose salary is $7500. [489]\r\n    The seven heads of departments in the Javanese service each\r\n    receive a like compensation of 24000 gulden. The Raad,\r\n    or Council, of the Dutch colonial government is composed\r\n    of a vice-president and four members--the former receiving\r\n    about $14,500, the latter slightly over $11,500 each. In the\r\n    Philippine government the executive functions of heads of\r\n    departments are exercised by four members of the legislative\r\n    body, each of whom receives $10,500 for his executive services\r\n    and $5000 for his legislative duties. Without going further\r\n    into detail, the conclusion is evident that all officials of\r\n    high rank are much better paid in the Dutch service. When a\r\n    comparison is made between the chief clerks and other office\r\n    employees of middle grades--not natives--the salaries are\r\n    seen to be about the same in the two countries.\r\n\r\n    \"All natives in positions of lower grades, however,\r\n    in the Philippine Islands fare better than their Malay\r\n    brethren, either in the Straits Settlements or in the East\r\n    Indies.\"--(Second Annual Report of the Philippine Civil\r\n    Service Board, pp. 60, 61.)\r\n\r\n    \"Difference in salaries for subordinate positions in the\r\n    British and Dutch colonial services and the Philippine service\r\n    are distinctly in favour of subordinate employees in the\r\n    Philippine service; only the higher officials, after long\r\n    experience, in the British colonial service receive larger\r\n    salaries than corresponding officials in the Philippine\r\n    service; the leave of absence and other privileges for the\r\n    Philippine service are not less liberal than for other colonial\r\n    services.\"--(Report of the Philippine Commission for 1905,\r\n    p. 74.)\r\n\r\nThe entrance salaries of Americans brought to the islands are\r\nconsiderably in excess of the entrance salaries received on appointment\r\nto the civil service in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the minimum entrance salaries given to\r\nAmericans appointed in the United States to the United States civil\r\nservice, as shown by the manual of examinations of the United States\r\nCivil Service Commission for the fall of 1913, and to Americans\r\nappointed in the United States to the Philippine Civil Service:--\r\n\r\n\r\n====================================================================\r\n                         |     Philippines      |  United States\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                         |                      |\r\nAid (Surveyor)           |     $1400            | $ 900\r\nCivil Engineer           |      1400            |  1200\r\nForester, assistant      |      1400            |  1200\r\nScientific Assistant,    |                      |\r\n(Agricultural Inspector) |      1400            |   600\r\nPhysician                |      1600            |  1320\r\nPrinter                  |      2000            |      .50 per hour\r\nStenographer             |      1200            |   700\r\nTrained Nurse            |       600 Board,     |   600 and laundry\r\n                         | quarters and laundry |\r\nTeacher                  |      1000            |   540\r\nVeterinarian             |      1600            |  1200\r\n                         |                      |\r\n====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following cases taken from the official rosters show some\r\npromotions to the higher positions in the service of employees who\r\nentered the lower ranks of the classified service:--\r\n\r\nA clerk who entered the service in 1899 at $1800 per annum was\r\nappointed in 1903 an assistant chief of bureau at $3000 per annum and\r\nin 1908 executive secretary at $9000 per annum. A teacher appointed in\r\n1899 at $720 per annum was appointed a chief of an office at $4000 per\r\nannum and in 1912 a judge at $4500 per annum. A teacher who entered\r\nthe service in 1901 at $1200 per annum was in 1909 appointed a chief\r\nof a bureau at $6000 per annum. A teacher who entered the service in\r\n1904 at $1000 per annum was appointed in 1911 an assistant chief of\r\na bureau at $6000 per annum. A clerk who entered the service in 1901\r\nat $1200 per annum was appointed in 1909 an assistant chief of the\r\nexecutive bureau at $3750 per annum and in 1912 a chief of a bureau\r\nat $6000 per annum. A stenographer who entered the service in 1902\r\nat $1400 per annum was in 1908 appointed an assistant chief of a\r\nbureau at $5000 per annum. A transitman who entered the service in\r\n1905 at $1400 per annum was in 1913 appointed an assistant chief of a\r\nbureau at $4500 per annum. An accountant who entered the service in\r\n1901 at $1800 per annum was in 1907 appointed an assistant chief of\r\na bureau at $3750 per annum and in 1909 a chief of a bureau at $6000\r\nper annum. A law clerk who entered the service in 1904 at $1800 per\r\nannum was in 1913 appointed judge at $4500 per annum. In no service\r\nanywhere has promotion depended more directly on demonstrated ability,\r\nand in many instances it has been rapid.\r\n\r\nYoung men living two in a room may obtain room and board in boarding\r\nhouses in Manila at a rate as low as $35 per month each. In the Young\r\nMen's Christian Association building, a large reënforced concrete\r\nstructure with reading room, gymnasium, and a good restaurant, the\r\ncharge for two in a room is $10.25 each. Board costs $27.50, a total of\r\n$37.75. The expenses for clothing in Manila are less than in the United\r\nStates, as white clothing is worn the whole year and white duck suits\r\nmay be obtained for about $3 each. The expenses for laundry amount\r\nto about $5 a month. The necessity of employing a _muchacho_ [490] is\r\n_nil_, in the case of an unmarried employee who boards. Servants are\r\nfar cheaper and better in the Philippines than in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn a discussion of the salaries paid in the Philippine civil service\r\nthe question of the leave allowed should be considered. Classified\r\nemployees who receive an annual salary of $1000 or more per annum may\r\nbe granted twenty-eight days' leave per annum to cover absences from\r\nduty due to illness or other causes. If not taken during the calendar\r\nyear in which it is earned or in January or February of the succeeding\r\nyear, it is forfeited. Employees taking vacation leave during the\r\nmonths of December, January, February and March may take fifty-six\r\ndays, corresponding to two years of service, at one time, and may thus\r\nget time to visit Australia, Japan, China, and neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to vacation leave an employee whose salary is $1000 or\r\nmore but less than $1800 per annum is entitled to thirty days' accrued\r\nleave per annum, and an employee whose salary is $1800 per annum or\r\nmore is entitled to thirty-five days' accrued leave per annum. Accrued\r\nleave may accumulate for not more than five years of service.\r\n\r\nAll classified employees are entitled to visit the United States or\r\nforeign countries once in every three years, receiving in addition to\r\ntheir accrued leave, one year's vacation leave, allowance of actual\r\ntravel time at half pay not to exceed sixty days, and return travel\r\nexpenses from place of residence in the United States, or from port\r\nof embarkation in a foreign country to Manila, on the completion of\r\ntwo years of service after date of return. An employee entitled to\r\nthirty-five days' accrued leave per annum who visits the United States\r\nafter having rendered three years of service receives a total of two\r\nhundred thirteen days' accrued leave, vacation leave, and half-pay\r\ntravel time. If he postpones his visit till he has completed five\r\nyears of service, he receives a total of two hundred ninety-one days'\r\naccrued leave, vacation leave and travel time. An employee entitled to\r\nthirty days' accrued leave per annum who visits the United States after\r\nthree years of service receives a total of one hundred ninety-four\r\ndays' leave and half-pay travel time, and if he postpones his visit\r\nuntil he has rendered five years of service, he receives a total of\r\ntwo hundred fifty-nine days' leave and travel time.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these are very liberal allowances. An employee\r\nreceiving $1200 at the end of two years of service may spend eight\r\nweeks of vacation leave visiting Japan or other surrounding countries,\r\nand at the end of an additional year's service he may visit his home\r\nin the United States with six and a third months' absence on full and\r\nhalf pay and with his expenses from his home to Manila payable two\r\nyears after his return, and during every three years of his service\r\nhe may have the same privileges.\r\n\r\nThe law also provides that if an employee is wounded or injured in\r\nthe performance of duty, he may have a total of six months' leave on\r\nfull pay in addition to any accrued leave to his credit.\r\n\r\nEmployees who have rendered satisfactory service and resign after\r\nthree or more years receive in a lump sum all accrued leave due and\r\nthirty days' half salary. For example, an employee who has received\r\n$1800 per annum and has served five years without taking any leave\r\nin excess of the four weeks' vacation leave allowable annually would\r\ndraw $1025 were he to resign.\r\n\r\nThe school sessions amount to forty weeks per annum and the school\r\nvacations to twelve weeks per annum. [491] Teachers receive an annual\r\nsalary and draw full pay during vacations as well as during school\r\nsessions. Every third year they are allowed to visit the United States\r\nor foreign countries with an allowance of sixty days' half-pay travel\r\ntime in addition to the ten weeks' long vacation, and on completing\r\ntwo years of service after return to the islands they are entitled to\r\ntheir travelling expenses from place of residence in the United States\r\nto Manila or from port of embarkation in a foreign country to Manila.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare these provisions with the regulations\r\ngoverning leave of absence in the British colonial service:--\r\n\r\n    (1) There is no distinction between sick leave and ordinary\r\n    leave, the leave of absence on account of sickness being\r\n    charged against the ordinary leave allowable.\r\n\r\n    (2) There are two classes of leave: vacation leave on full\r\n    pay and half-pay leave.\r\n\r\n    (3) The vacation leave amounts to three months every two\r\n    years, and must be taken during the two years, as it does\r\n    not accumulate.\r\n\r\n    (4) The half-pay leave amounts to two months for each year\r\n    of service, but cannot be taken until after a period of six\r\n    years' resident service in the Colony, except in cases of\r\n    serious indisposition supported by medical certificate, or of\r\n    \"urgent private affairs,\" the nature of which must be stated\r\n    to the governor. In either case, the governor and council\r\n    must be satisfied that the indulgence is indispensable.\r\n\r\n    Half pay in African and Asiatic colonies may accumulate for\r\n    twelve years' service--_i.e._ twenty-four months' half-pay\r\n    leave.\r\n\r\n    (5) After the exhaustion of all vacation leave and half-pay\r\n    leave, an advance of six months' half-pay leave may be made on\r\n    special grounds (\"urgent private affairs\" or illness supported\r\n    by a medical certificate), the advance being charged against\r\n    leave accruing subsequently.\r\n\r\n    (6) For the purpose of visiting home, an officer may be\r\n    granted the vacation leave due him (which is never more than\r\n    three months) on full pay, and his accumulated half-pay leave,\r\n    to commence at the expiration of his vacation leave.\r\n\r\n    (7) Judicial and education officers do not receive the\r\n    vacation leave described in paragraph 3 above, the vacation\r\n    of courts and schools being considered equal to this, but\r\n    they do receive the half-pay leave described in paragraph 4,\r\n    and may, when visiting home on half-pay leave, receive full\r\n    pay during any ordinary vacation of the court or school.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that although officers in the British colonial service\r\nare allowed much longer periods of absence, the greater part of their\r\nabsence is on half pay and the total money value of the leave allowable\r\nin the British colonial service and in the Philippine civil service\r\nis about the same. As officers naturally prefer to be on full pay\r\ninstead of half pay while on leave, the provision of the Philippine\r\nlaw is in their interest; it is also in the interest of the service,\r\nas the periods of the absence from duty are not so prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Civil Service Law is now about to be put to its\r\nfirst really severe test as a result of the change in the national\r\nadministration. Heretofore those whose duty and privilege it has been\r\nto enforce it have been in the most full and hearty sympathy with its\r\npurposes. President McKinley was from the outset definitely committed\r\nto the widest application of the merit system to appointments in the\r\nPhilippines. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft firmly supported that system,\r\nas has each succeeding governor-general up to, but not including,\r\nMr. Harrison, who is as yet an unknown quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, however, to note that on the day following his\r\narrival there was a demand for the instant resignation of Mr. Thomas\r\nCary Welch, a faithful and efficient employee of the government,\r\nwho had been for nearly ten years in the service, whose position\r\nwas desired for, and immediately given to, Mr. Stephen Bonsal. That\r\ngentleman had been appointed at Washington a member of the Municipal\r\nBoard of Manila immediately after Mr. Harrison's confirmation as\r\ngovernor-general. It is not recorded that Mr. Bonsal rendered any\r\nvaluable service to the city on the voyage, or during the twenty-four\r\nhours of his occupancy of his municipal post subsequent to his\r\narrival! Nor does it appear that he passed any examination before\r\nhis early promotion.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely upon the removal of Mr. Welch came a demand for\r\nthe resignation of Captain Charles H. Sleeper, Director of Lands,\r\nwho was unquestionably one of the ablest and most efficient of the\r\nbureau chiefs.\r\n\r\nHe had earned the ill-will of the _politicos_ by insisting that persons\r\nauthorized to make public land surveys, or other surveys on which\r\nclaims of title as against the government were to be based, should\r\nknow enough about surveying to make one correct survey when given\r\nan opportunity practically to demonstrate their abilities under very\r\nfavourable conditions. He had also incurred the dislike of influential\r\n_caciques_ by defending the occupants of small holdings on friar\r\nestates from the rapacity of their rich neighbours, and by protecting\r\nfree-patent applicants and homesteaders when large landowners opposed\r\ntheir applications in order to prevent their securing land, so that\r\nthey might the more easily be held as peon labourers.\r\n\r\nHe had started in his bureau a practical school for Filipino surveyors\r\nwhich was training really well-qualified candidates for positions\r\ndesired by the politicians for themselves or their incompetent friends.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, he had helped to upset the plans of the men\r\nprimarily responsible for the so-called \"friar lands investigation\"\r\nconducted by the House Committee on Insular Affairs, which cost\r\nthe United States government a very large sum, and resulted in\r\ndemonstrating his uprightness and the efficiency of his administration.\r\n\r\nMr. John R. Wilson, the assistant director of lands, was absent at the\r\nmoment, but his resignation was demanded on the day of his return. He\r\ntoo was an active, efficient, upright man.\r\n\r\nBoth of these removals were political acts, pure and simple. Sr. Manuel\r\nTinio was appointed Director of Lands. He is a bright young Ilocano\r\nof good character, who had become a \"general\" in the Insurgent army\r\nat twenty-one years of age. He is unfit to hold the place, because,\r\nas he has himself frankly said, he knows nothing about the work. He\r\nis charged with the duty of administering $7,000,000 worth of friar\r\nlands, and the whole public domain of the Philippine Islands, and with\r\nsuch minor duties as the checkmating of the machinations of numerous\r\nwealthy Filipinos who seek fraudulently to acquire great tracts through\r\nfraudulent claims to unperfected titles and by other improper means.\r\n\r\nWhile in Honolulu, _en route_ to Manila, Mr. Harrison gave out an\r\ninterview, which I am credibly informed he has since confirmed in\r\nsubstance. It contained the following statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"For years I have been of the minority in Congress and have\r\n    seen the Democrats kicked about, trampled upon, and otherwise\r\n    manhandled by Republicans, so that I must confess it now gives\r\n    me a saturnine pleasure to see the Democrats in a position\r\n    to do the same thing to the Republicans.\"\r\n\r\nHis early official acts after arrival at Manila confirmed the belief\r\nthat this was indeed the spirit in which he was facing the grave\r\nresponsibilities which there confronted him.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond doubt or cavil that high ideals heretofore have prevailed\r\nin the Philippine Civil Service. Are they now to be substituted by\r\nthe methods of the ward politician?\r\n\r\nIn its report for 1901 the Philippine Commission said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The civil service law has been in operation since our last\r\n    report, and we see no reason to change our conclusion as\r\n    to the absolute necessity for its existence, and strict\r\n    enforcement. Without this law American government in these\r\n    Islands is, in our opinion, foredoomed to humiliating failure.\"\r\n\r\nI signed that report. I have not since seen any reason to change\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Constabulary and Public Order\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years of Spanish rule in the Philippines\r\nevil-doers were pursued and apprehended and public order was maintained\r\nchiefly by the _guardia civil_. At the time of its organization in\r\n1868 this body had a single division. By 1880 the number had been\r\nincreased to three, two for Luzón and one for the Visayan Islands.\r\n\r\nThe _guardia civil_ was organized upon a military basis, its officers\r\nand soldiers being drawn from the regular army of Spain by selection\r\nor upon recommendation. Detachments were distributed throughout the\r\nprovinces and were commanded according to their size by commissioned\r\nor non-commissioned officers. Central offices were located in district\r\ncapitals; company headquarters were stationed in provincial capitals,\r\nand detachments were sent to places where they were deemed to be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions they rendered service as patrols of two men\r\neach, but for the purpose of attacking large bands of outlaws one or\r\nseveral companies were employed as occasion required.\r\n\r\nThe _guardia civil_ had jurisdiction over all sorts of violations of\r\nlaws and municipal ordinances. They made reports upon which were based\r\nthe appointments of municipal officers, the granting of licenses to\r\ncarry firearms, and the determination of the loyalty or the disloyalty\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nThey were vested with extraordinary powers. Offences against them\r\nwere tried by courts-martial, and were construed as offences against\r\nsentinels on duty. Penalties were therefore extremely severe.\r\n\r\nOfficers of the _guardia civil_ on leave could by their own initiative\r\nassume a status of duty with the full powers and responsibilities\r\nthat go with command. This is contrary to American practice, under\r\nwhich only dire emergency justifies an officer in assuming an official\r\nstatus unless he is duly assigned thereto by competent authority.\r\n\r\nThe _guardia civil_ could arrest on suspicion, and while the Spanish\r\nGovernment did not directly authorize or sanction the use of force to\r\nextort confessions, it was not scrupulous in the matter of accepting\r\nconfessions so obtained as evidence of crime, nor was it quick to\r\npunish members of the _guardia civil_ charged with mistreatment\r\nof prisoners.\r\n\r\nReports made by the _guardia civil_ were not questioned, but were\r\naccepted without support even in cases of the killing of prisoners\r\nalleged to have attempted to escape, or of men evading arrest.\r\n\r\nThis method of eliminating without trial citizens deemed to be\r\nundesirable was applied with especial frequency in the suppression\r\nof active brigandage, and latterly during the revolution against\r\nSpain. Prisoners in charge of the _guardia civil_ were always tied\r\nelbow to elbow. They knew full well that resistance or flight was\r\nan invitation to their guards to kill them, and that this invitation\r\nwas likely to be promptly accepted.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of crime the members of this organization arrested\r\npersons on suspicion and compelled them to make revelations, true or\r\nfalse. Eye-witnesses to the commission of crime were not needed in\r\nthe Spanish courts of that day. The confession of an accused person\r\nsecured his conviction, even though not made in the presence of a\r\njudge. Indirect and hearsay evidence were accepted, and such things\r\nas writs of habeas corpus and the plea of double jeopardy were unknown\r\nin Spanish procedure.\r\n\r\nThe _guardia civil_ could rearrest individuals and again charge them\r\nwith crimes of which they had already been acquitted. I have been\r\nassured by reliable Filipino witnesses that it was common during the\r\nlatter days of Spanish sovereignty for persons who had made themselves\r\nobnoxious to the government to be invited by non-commissioned\r\nofficers to take a walk, which was followed either by their complete\r\ndisappearance or by the subsequent discovery of their dead bodies.\r\n\r\nIt naturally resulted that the members of the _guardia civil_ were\r\nregarded with detestation and terror by the people, but their power\r\nwas so absolute that protest rarely became public. The one notable\r\nexception was furnished by Dr. Rizal's book entitled \"Noli Me Tangere,\"\r\nwhich voiced the complaints of the Filipinos against them. There is\r\nnot a vestige of doubt that hatred of them was one of the principal\r\ncauses of the insurrection against Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the American government organized a rural police force in\r\nthe Philippines. It was called the Philippine constabulary. The\r\ninsurrection was then drawing to a close, but there were left in the\r\nfield many guerilla bands armed and uniformed. Their members sought to\r\nexcuse their lawless acts under the plea of patriotism and opposition\r\nto the forces of the United States. In many provinces they combined\r\nwith professional bandits or with religious fanatics. Various \"popes\"\r\narose, like Papa Isio in Negros. The Filipinos had become accustomed\r\nto a state of war which had continued for nearly six years. Habits\r\nof peace had been abandoned. The once prosperous haciendas were in\r\nruins. War and pestilence had destroyed many of the work animals,\r\nand those which remained continued to perish from disease. Asiatic\r\ncholera was sweeping through the archipelago, and consternation and\r\ndisorder followed in its wake.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the organization of a rural police force was\r\nimperatively necessary. Unfortunately the most critical situation which\r\nit was to be called upon to meet had to be faced at the very outset,\r\nwhen both officers and men were inexperienced and before adequate\r\ndiscipline could be established.\r\n\r\nThe law providing for its establishment was drawn by the Honourable\r\nLuke E. Wright, at that time secretary of commerce and police and\r\nlater destined to become governor-general of the Philippines and\r\nsecretary of war of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was intended that the constabulary should accomplish its ends by\r\nforce when necessary but by sympathetic supervision when possible,\r\nsuppressing brigandage and turning the people towards habits of\r\npeace. The fact was clearly borne in mind that the abuses of the\r\n_guardia civil_ had not been forgotten and the new force was designed\r\nto meet existing conditions, to allay as rapidly as possible the\r\nexisting just rancour against the similar organization established\r\nunder the Spanish régime, and to avoid the evils which had contributed\r\nso much toward causing the downfall of Spanish sovereignty. The law\r\nwas admirably framed to achieve these ends.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the constabulary were selected chiefly from American\r\nvolunteers recently mustered out and from honourably discharged\r\nsoldiers of the United States army. Some few Filipinos, whose loyalty\r\nwas above suspicion, were appointed to the lower grades. This number\r\nhas since been materially augumented, and some of the original Filipino\r\nappointees have risen to the rank of captain.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that at the outset there should be abuses. The\r\norganization was necessarily born at work; there was no time to\r\ninstruct, to formulate regulations, to wait until a satisfactory\r\nstate of discipline had been brought about. There were not barracks\r\nfor housing the soldiers; there were neither uniforms, nor arms,\r\nnor ammunition. There was no system for rationing the men. All of\r\nthese things had to be provided, and they were provided through a\r\nnatural evolution of practical processes, crystallizing into form,\r\ntested by the duties of the day. The organization which grew up was a\r\ntrue survival of the fittest, both in personnel and in methods. The\r\nwonder is not that some abuses occurred, but that they were so few;\r\nnot that there were occasional evidences of lack of efficiency,\r\nbut that efficiency was on the whole so high from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe several provinces were made administrative units, the commanding\r\nofficer in each being designated as \"senior inspector.\" The men who\r\nwere to serve in a given province were by preference recruited there,\r\nand a departure was thus made from the usual foreign colonial practice.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the total force was fixed at one hundred companies with a\r\nnominal strength of two officers and fifty men each. Under special\r\nconditions this rule may be departed from, and the size of the\r\ncompanies or the number of officers increased.\r\n\r\nEach province is divided by the senior inspector into sections, and the\r\nresponsibility for patrol work and general policing rests on the senior\r\ncompany officer in each station. The provinces are grouped into five\r\ndistricts, each commanded by an assistant chief who exercises therein\r\nthe authority, and performs the duties appropriate to the chief for\r\nthe entire Philippines. The higher administrative positions have always\r\nbeen filled by detailing regular officers of the United States army.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary soldiers are now neatly uniformed, armed with Krag\r\ncarbines and well disciplined. They show the effect of good and regular\r\nfood and of systematic exercise, their physical condition being vastly\r\nsuperior to that of the average Filipino. They are given regular\r\ninstruction in their military duties. It is conducted in English.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine constabulary may be defined as a body of armed men\r\nwith a military organization, recruited from among the people of the\r\nislands, officered in part by Americans and in part by Filipinos, and\r\nemployed primarily for police duty in connection with the establishment\r\nand maintenance of public order.\r\n\r\nBlount's chapters on the administrations of Taft, Wright and Smith\r\nembody one prolonged plaint to the effect that the organization of\r\nthe constabulary was premature, and that after the war proper ended,\r\nthe last smouldering embers of armed and organized insurrection should\r\nhave been stamped out, and the brigandage which had existed in the\r\nPhilippines for centuries should have been dealt with, by the United\r\nStates army rather than by the constabulary.\r\n\r\nEven if it were true that the army could have rendered more effective\r\nservice to this end than could have been expected at the outset from\r\na newly organized body of Filipino soldiers, the argument against the\r\norganization and use of the constabulary would in my opinion have\r\nbeen by no means conclusive. It is our declared policy to prepare\r\nthe Filipinos to establish and maintain a stable government of their\r\nown. The proper exercise of police powers is obviously necessary to\r\nsuch an end.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset we have sacrificed efficiency in order that our wards\r\nmight gain practical experience, and might demonstrate their ability,\r\nor lack of ability, to perform necessary governmental functions. Does\r\nany one cognizant of the situation doubt for a moment that provincial\r\nand municipal affairs in the Philippine Islands would to-day be more\r\nefficiently administered if provincial and municipal officers were\r\nappointed instead of being elected? Is any one so foolish as to imagine\r\nthat the sanitary regeneration of the islands would not have progressed\r\nmuch more rapidly had highly trained American health officers been used\r\nin place of many of the badly educated and comparatively inexperienced\r\nFilipino physicians whose services have been utilized?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the concrete case under discussion I dissent from\r\nthe claim that more satisfactory results could have been obtained by\r\nthe use of American troops.\r\n\r\nThe army had long been supreme in the Philippines. Every function of\r\ngovernment had been performed by its officers and men, if performed at\r\nall. Our troops had been combating an elusive and cruel enemy. If they\r\nwere human it is to be presumed that they still harbored animosities,\r\nborn of these conditions, toward the people with whom they had\r\nso recently been fighting. Had the work of pacification been then\r\nturned over to them it would have meant that often in the localities\r\nin which they had been fighting, and in dealing with the men to whom\r\nthey had very recently been actively opposed in armed conflict, they\r\nwould have been called upon to perform tasks and to entertain feelings\r\nradically different from those of the preceding two or three years.\r\n\r\nA detachment, marching through Leyte, found an American who had\r\ndisappeared a short time before crucified, head down. His abdominal\r\nwall had been carefully opened so that his intestines might hang down\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\nAnother American prisoner, found on the same trip, had been buried in\r\nthe ground with only his head projecting. His mouth had been propped\r\nopen with a stick, a trail of sugar laid to it through the forest,\r\nand a handful thrown into it.\r\n\r\nMillions of ants had done the rest.\r\n\r\nOfficers and men who saw such things were thereby fitted for war,\r\nrather than for ordinary police duty.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that they had seen so many of them that they continued to\r\nsee them in imagination when they no longer existed. I well remember\r\nwhen a general officer, directed by his superior to attend a banquet\r\nat Manila in which Americans and Filipinos joined, came to it wearing\r\na big revolver!\r\n\r\nLong after Manila was quiet I was obliged to get out of my carriage\r\nin the rain and darkness half a dozen times while driving the length\r\nof Calle Real, and \"approach to be recognized\" by raw \"rookies,\"\r\neach of whom pointed a loaded rifle at me while I did it. I know\r\nthat this did not tend to make me feel peaceable or happy. In my\r\nopinion it was wholly unnecessary, and yet I did not blame the army\r\nfor thinking otherwise.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, when my private secretary, Mr. James H. LeRoy,\r\nwas one day approaching Malolos, he was sternly commanded by a sentry\r\nto halt, the command being emphasized as usual by presenting to his\r\nattention a most unattractive view down the muzzle of a Krag. He was\r\nnext ordered to \"salute the flag,\" which he finally discovered with\r\ndifficulty in the distance, after being told where to look. The army\r\nway is right and necessary in war, but it makes a lot of bother in\r\ntime of peace!\r\n\r\nThis was not the only reason for failing to make more extensive use\r\nof American soldiers in police duty. A veteran colonel of United\r\nStates cavalry who had just read Judge Blount's book was asked what\r\nhe thought of the claim therein made that the army should have done\r\nthe police and pacification work of the Philippines. His reply was:--\r\n\r\n    \"How long would it take a regiment of Filipinos to catch an\r\n    American outlaw in the United States? Impossible!\"\r\n\r\nAnother army officer said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Catching Filipino outlaws with the Army is like catching a\r\n    flea in a twenty-acre field with a traction engine.\"\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps nothing so demoralizing to regular troops as\r\nemployment on police duty which requires them to work singly or in\r\nsmall squads. Discipline speedily goes to the dogs and instruction\r\nbecomes impossible.\r\n\r\nSuccessful prosecution of the work of chasing _ladrones_ in the\r\nPhilippines requires a thorough knowledge of local topography and\r\nof local native dialects. Spanish is of use, but only in dealing\r\nwith educated Filipinos. A knowledge of the Filipino himself; of his\r\nhabits of thought; of his attitude toward the white man; and toward\r\nthe _illustrado_, or educated man, of his own race; ability to enter a\r\ntown and speedily to determine the relative importance of its leading\r\ncitizens, finally centring on the one man, always to be found, who\r\nruns it, whether he holds political office or not, and also to enlist\r\nthe sympathy and coöperation of its people; all of these things are\r\nessential to the successful handling of brigandage in the Philippines,\r\nwhether such brigandage has, or lacks, political significance.\r\n\r\nThe following parallel will make clear some of the reasons why it was\r\ndetermined to use constabulary instead of American soldiers in policing\r\nthe Philippines from the time the insurrection officially ended:--\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited States Army                  Philippine Constabulary\r\n\r\nSoldier costs per annum $1400.      Soldier costs per annum $363.50.\r\n(Authority: Adjutant General\r\nHeistand in 1910.)\r\n\r\nAmerican soldiers come from         Constabulary soldiers are\r\nAmerica.                            enlisted in the province\r\n                                    where they are to serve.\r\n\r\nFew American soldiers speak         All constabulary soldiers\r\nthe local dialects.                 speak local dialects.\r\n\r\nFew American soldiers speak         All educated constabulary\r\nany Spanish.                        soldiers speak Spanish.\r\n\r\nAmerican soldiers usually have      Constabulary soldiers, native to\r\nbut a slight knowledge of local     the country, know the geography\r\ngeography and topography.           and topography of their respective\r\n                                    provinces.\r\n\r\nFew American soldiers have had      The Filipino soldier certainly\r\nenough contact with Filipinos       knows his own kind better than\r\nto understand them.                 the American does.\r\n\r\nThe American soldier uses a         The constabulary soldier is\r\nration of certain fixed components  rationed in cash and buys the\r\nimported over sea. (A ration is     food of the country where he\r\nthe day's allowance of food for     happens to be.\r\none soldier.)\r\n\r\nThe American ration costs           The constabulary cash ration is\r\n24.3 cents United States currency   10.5 cents United States currency.\r\n(exclusive of cost of               (No freight or handling charges.)\r\ntransportation and handling).       The constabulary soldier knows not\r\nFresh meat requiring ice to keep    ice. His food grows in the islands.\r\nit is a principal part of the       He buys it on the ground and needs\r\nAmerican ration. To supply it       no transportation to bring it to him.\r\nrequires a regular system of\r\ntransport from the United States\r\nto Manila and from thence to local\r\nports, and wagon transportation\r\nfrom ports to inland stations.\r\n\r\nThe American soldier is at no       The idea of enlisting the sympathy\r\npains to enlist the sympathy and    and coöperation of the local\r\ncoöperation of the people; and      population is the strongest tenet\r\nhis methods of discipline habits    in the constabulary creed.\r\nof life, etc., make it practically\r\nimpossible for him to gain them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore preparing the foregoing statement relative to the reasons for\r\nusing Philippine constabulary soldiers instead of soldiers of the\r\nUnited States army for police work during the period in question, I\r\nasked Colonel J. G. Harbord, assistant director of the constabulary,\r\nwho has served with that body nine years, has been its acting director\r\nand is an officer of the United States army, to give me a memorandum\r\non the subject. It is only fair to him to say that I have not only\r\nfollowed very closely the line of argument embodied in the memorandum\r\nwhich he was good enough to prepare for me, but have in many instances\r\nused his very words. The parallel columns are his.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary soldier, thoroughly familiar with the topography\r\nof the country in which he operates; speaking the local dialect and\r\nacquainted with the persons most likely to be able and willing to\r\nfurnish accurate information; familiar with the characteristics of\r\nhis own people; able to live off the country and keep well, is under\r\nall ordinary circumstances a more efficient and vastly less expensive\r\npolice officer than the American soldier, no matter how brave and\r\nenergetic the latter may be. Furthermore, his activities are much\r\nless likely to arouse animosity.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the army is pretty consistently unwilling to take the\r\nfield unless the constitutional guarantees are temporarily suspended,\r\nand it particularly objects to writs of habeas corpus. The suspension\r\nof such guarantees is obviously undesirable unless really very\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider some of the specific instances of alleged\r\ninefficiency of the constabulary in suppressing public disorder,\r\ncited by Blount.\r\n\r\nOn page 403 of his book he says, speaking of Governor Taft and disorder\r\nin the province of Albay which arose in 1902-1903:--\r\n\r\n    \"He did not want to order out the military again if he could\r\n    help it, and this relegated him to his native municipal police\r\n    and constabulary, experimental outfits of doubtful loyalty,\r\n    and, at best, wholly inadequate, as it afterwards turned out,\r\n    for the maintenance of public order and for affording to\r\n    the peaceably inclined people that sort of security for life\r\n    and property, and that protection against semi-political as\r\n    well as unmitigated brigandage, which would comport with the\r\n    dignity of this nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts as to these disorders are briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn 1902 an outlaw in Tayabas Province who made his living by\r\norganizing political conspiracies and collecting contributions in\r\nthe name of patriotism, who was known as José Roldan when operating\r\nin adjoining provinces, but had an alias in Tayabas, found his life\r\nmade so uncomfortable by the constabulary of that province that he\r\ntransferred his operations to Albay. There he affiliated himself\r\nwith a few ex-Insurgent officers who had turned outlaws instead\r\nof surrendering, and with oath violators, and began the same kind\r\nof political operations which he had carried out in Tayabas, the\r\nprincipal feature of his work being the collection of \"contributions.\"\r\n\r\nThe troubles in Albay were encouraged by wealthy Filipinos who saw in\r\nthem a probable opportunity to acquire valuable hemp lands at bottom\r\nprices, for people dependent on their hemp fields, if prevented from\r\nworking them, might in the end be forced to sell them. Roldan soon\r\nlost standing with his new organization because it was found that he\r\nwas using for his personal benefit the money which he collected.\r\n\r\nAbout this time one Simeon Ola joined his organization. Ola was\r\na native of Albay, where he had been an Insurgent major under the\r\ncommand of the Tagálog general, Belarmino. His temporary rank had\r\ngone to his head, and he is reported to have shown considerable\r\nseverity and hauteur in his treatment of his former neighbours\r\nin Guinobatan, to which place he had returned at the close of the\r\ninsurrection. Meanwhile, a wealthy Chinese _mestizo_ named Don Circilio\r\nJaucian, on whom Ola, during his brief career as an Insurgent officer,\r\nhad laid a heavy hand, had become _presidente_ of the town.\r\n\r\nSmarting under the indignities which he had suffered, Jaucian made it\r\nvery uncomfortable for the former major, and in ways well understood\r\nin Malay countries brought it home to the latter that their positions\r\nhad been reversed. Ola's house was mysteriously burned, and his life\r\nin Guinobatan was made so unbearable that he took to the hills.\r\n\r\nOla had held higher military rank than had any of his outlaw\r\nassociates, and he became their dominating spirit. He had no grievance\r\nagainst the Americans, but took every opportunity to avenge himself\r\non the _caciques_ of Guinobatan, his native town.\r\n\r\nThree assistant chiefs of constabulary, Garwood, Baker and Bandholtz,\r\nwere successively sent to Albay to deal with this situation. Baker\r\nand Bandholtz were regular army officers. The latter ended the\r\ndisturbances, employing first and last some twelve companies of\r\nPhilippine scouts, armed, officered, paid, equipped and disciplined\r\nas are the regular soldiers of the United States army, and a similar\r\nnumber of constabulary soldiers. Eleven stations in the restricted\r\nfield of operations of this outlaw were occupied by scouts. There were\r\nfew armed conflicts in force between Ola's men and these troops. In\r\nfact, it was only with the greatest difficulty that this band, which\r\nfrom time to time dissolved into the population only to reappear\r\nagain, could be located even by the native soldiers. It would have\r\nbeen impracticable successfully to use American troops for such work.\r\n\r\nReferring to the statement made by Blount [492] that Vice-Governor\r\nWright made a visit to Albay in 1903 in the interest \"of the\r\npeace-at-any-price policy that the Manila Government was bent on,\"\r\nand the implication that he went there to conduct peace negotiations,\r\nGeneral Bandholtz, who suppressed outlawry in Albay, has said that\r\nVice-Governor Wright and Commissioner Pardo de Tavera came there\r\nat his request to look into conditions with reference to certain\r\nallegations which had been made.\r\n\r\nColonel Bandholtz and the then chief of constabulary, General Allen,\r\nwere supported by the civil governor and the commission in their\r\nrecommendations that no terms should be made with the outlaws. The\r\nfollowing statement occurs in a letter from General Bandholtz dated\r\nSeptember 21, 1903:--\r\n\r\n    \"No one is more anxious to terminate this business than I am,\r\n    nevertheless I think it would be a mistake to offer any such\r\n    inducements, and that more lasting benefits would result by\r\n    hammering away as we have been doing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd General Allen said in an indorsement to the Philippine\r\nCommission:--\r\n\r\n    \"... in my opinion the judgment of Colonel Bandholtz in\r\n    matters connected with the pacification of Albay should\r\n    receive favourable consideration. Halfway measures are always\r\n    misinterpreted and used to the detriment of the Government\r\n    among the ignorant followers of the outlaws.\"\r\n\r\nThese views prevailed.\r\n\r\nBlount has claimed that the death rate in the Albay jail at this\r\ntime was very excessive, and cites it as an instance of the result\r\nof American maladministration.\r\n\r\nAssuming that his tabulation [493] of the dead who died in the Albay\r\njail between May 30 and September, 1903, amounting to 120, is correct,\r\nthe following statements should be made:--\r\n\r\nOnly recently has it been demonstrated that beri-beri is due to the\r\nuse of polished rice, which was up to the time of this discovery\r\nregarded as far superior to unpolished rice as an article of food,\r\nand is still much better liked by the Filipinos than is the unpolished\r\narticle. Many of these deaths were from beri-beri, and were due to\r\na misguided effort to give the prisoners the best possible food.\r\n\r\nCholera was raging in the province of Albay throughout the period\r\nin question, and the people outside of the jail suffered no less\r\nthan did those within it. The same is true of malarial infection. In\r\nother words, conditions inside the jail were quite similar to those\r\nthen prevailing outside, except that the prisoners got polished rice\r\nwhich was given them with the best intentions in the world, and was\r\nby them considered a superior article of food.\r\n\r\nWith the present knowledge of the methods of dissemination of\r\nAsiatic cholera gained as a result of the American occupation of\r\nthe Philippines, we should probably be able to exclude it from a\r\njail under such circumstances, as the part played by \"germ carriers\"\r\nwho show no outward manifestations of infection is now understood,\r\nbut it was not then dreamed of. One of the greatest reforms effected\r\nby Americans in the Philippines is the sanitation of the jails and\r\npenitentiaries, and we cannot be fairly blamed for not knowing in\r\n1903 what nobody then knew.\r\n\r\nThe troubles in Albay ended with the surrender of Ola on September\r\n25, 1903. Blount gives the impression that he had a knowledge of them\r\nwhich was gained by personal observation. He arrived in the province\r\nin the middle of November, seven weeks after normal conditions had\r\nbeen reëstablished.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 1903, General Bandholtz telegraphed with reference to\r\nthe final surrender of Ola's band:--\r\n\r\n    \"The towns are splitting themselves wide open celebrating\r\n    pacification and Ramon Santos (later elected governor) is\r\n    going to give a record-breaking fiesta at Ligao. Everybody\r\n    invited. Scouts and Constabulary have done superb work.\"\r\n\r\nBlount makes much of disorders in Samar and Leyte. Let us consider\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nIn all countries feuds between highlanders and lowlanders have been\r\ncommon. Although the inhabitants of the hills and those of the lowlands\r\nin the two islands under discussion are probably of identical blood\r\nand origin, they long since became separated in thought and feeling,\r\nand grew to be mutually antagonistic. The ignorant people of the\r\ninterior have always been oppressed by their supposedly more highly\r\ncivilized brethren living on or near the coast.\r\n\r\nThe killing of Otoy by the constabulary in 1911 marked the passing\r\nof the last of a series of mountain chiefs who had exercised a very\r\npowerful influence over the hill people and had claimed for themselves\r\nsupernatural powers.\r\n\r\nManila hemp is the principal product upon which these mountaineers\r\ndepend in bartering for cloth and other supplies. The cleaning of\r\nhemp involves very severe exertion, and when it is cleaned it must\r\nusually, in Samar, be carried to the seashore on the backs of the\r\nmen who raise it. Under the most favourable circumstances, it may be\r\ntransported thither in small _bancas_ [494] down the streams.\r\n\r\nThe lowland people of Samar and Leyte had long been holding up the\r\nhill people when they brought in their hemp for sale in precisely the\r\nway that Filipinos in other islands are accustomed to hold up members\r\nof the non-Christian tribes. They played the part of middlemen,\r\npurchasing the hemp of the ignorant hill people at low prices and\r\noften reselling it, without giving it even a day's storage, at a very\r\nmuch higher figure. This system was carried so far that conditions\r\nbecame unbearable and finally resulted in so-called _pulájanism_\r\nwhich began in the year 1904.\r\n\r\nThe term _pulájan_ is derived from a native word meaning \"red\" and\r\nwas given to the mountain people because in their attacks upon the\r\nlowlanders they wore, as a distinguishing mark, red trousers or a\r\ndash of red colour elsewhere about their sparse clothing. They raided\r\ncoast towns and did immense damage before they were finally brought\r\nunder control. It should be remembered that these conditions were\r\nallowed to arise by a Filipino provincial governor, and by Filipino\r\nmunicipal officials. It is altogether probable that a good American\r\ngovernor would have prevented them, but as it was, neither their cause\r\nnor their importance were understood at the outset. The _pulájan_\r\nmovement was directed primarily against Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak occurred on July 10, 1904, in the Gandara River\r\nvalley where a settlement of the lowlanders was burned and some of its\r\ninhabitants were killed. Eventually disorder spread to many places on\r\nthe coast, and one scout garrison of a single company was surprised\r\nand overwhelmed by superior numbers. Officers and men were massacred\r\nand their rifles taken.\r\n\r\nIn point of area Samar is the third island in the Philippines. In\r\nits interior are many rugged peaks and heavily forested mountains. It\r\nwas here that a detachment of United States marines under the command\r\nof Major Waller, while attempting to cross the island, were lost for\r\nnearly two weeks, going without food for days and enduring terrible\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\nAt the time in question there were not five miles of road on the\r\nisland passable for a vehicle, nor were there trails through the\r\nmountains over which horses could be ridden. The only interior lines\r\nof communication were a few footpaths over which the natives were\r\naccustomed to make their way from the mountains to the coast.\r\n\r\nTroops have perhaps never attempted a campaign in a country more\r\ndifficult than the interior of Samar. The traditional needle in the\r\nhaystack would be easy to find compared with an outlaw, or band of\r\noutlaws, in such a rugged wilderness.\r\n\r\nUpon the outbreak of trouble troops were hurried to Samar, and by\r\nDecember, 1904, according to Blount himself, there were some 1800\r\nnative soldiers on the island who were left free for active operations\r\nin the field by the garrisoning of various coast towns with sixteen\r\ncompanies of United States infantry.\r\n\r\nIf the nature of the feuds between the Samar lowlanders and highlanders\r\nhad then been better understood, the ensuing troubles, which were\r\nmore or less continuous for nearly two years, might perhaps have\r\nbeen avoided. As soon as it became evident that the situation was\r\nsuch as to demand the use of the army it was employed to supplement\r\nthe operations of the constabulary.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that trouble ended in Samar it began in Leyte. There\r\nwas no real connection between the disorders in the two islands. No\r\nleader on either island is known to have communicated with any leader\r\non the other; no fanatical follower ever left Samar for Leyte or\r\nLeyte for Samar so far as we are informed.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of administration the two islands were grouped in a\r\nsingle command after the army was requested to take over the handling\r\nof the disturbances there, in coöperation with the constabulary. The\r\ntrouble ended in 1907 and both islands have remained quiet ever\r\nsince. The same causes would again produce the same results now or\r\nat any time in the future, and they would be then, as in the past,\r\nthe outcome of the oppression of the weak by the strong and without\r\nother political significance. Under a good government they should\r\nnever recur.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances which did not exist in 1902 and 1904 made it\r\nfeasible to use the army in Samar and Leyte during 1905 and 1906. The\r\nhigh officers who had exercised such sweeping powers during the\r\ninsurrection had meanwhile given way to other commanders. Indeed,\r\na practically new Philippine army had come into existence. The\r\npolicy of the insular government as to the treatment of individual\r\nFilipinos had been recognized and indorsed by Americans generally,\r\nbut many of the objections to the use of the troops, including the\r\nheavy expense involved, still existed and I affirm without fear of\r\nsuccessful contradiction that had it been possible to place in Samar\r\nand Leyte a number of constabulary soldiers equal to that of the\r\nscouts and American troops actually employed, disorder would have\r\nbeen terminated much more quickly and at very greatly less cost.\r\n\r\nWith the final breaking up of organized brigandage in 1905 law and\r\norder may be said to have been established throughout the islands. It\r\nhas since been the business of the constabulary to maintain it. The\r\nvalue of the coöperation of the law-abiding portion of the population\r\nhas been fully recognized. The newly appointed constabulary officer\r\nhas impressed upon him the necessity of manifesting an interest in the\r\npeople with whom he comes in contact; of cultivating the acquaintance\r\nof Filipinos of all social grades, and of assisting to settle their\r\ndisagreements and harmonize their differences whenever possible. He\r\nis taught a native dialect.\r\n\r\nThe constabulary have to a high degree merited and secured\r\nthe confidence and good-will of the people, whose rights they\r\nrespect. There is a complete absence of the old arbitrary procedure\r\nfollowed by the _guardia civil_ and as a result there are frequent\r\nrequests from Filipino officials for additional detachments, while\r\nthe removal of a company from a given community is almost invariably\r\nfollowed by vigorous protests. The power of human sympathy is very\r\ngreat, and as the attitude of constabulary officers and men is usually\r\none of sympathy, conciliation and affection, that body has earned\r\nand deserved popularity.\r\n\r\nThe success of the constabulary in apprehending criminals has been\r\nboth praiseworthy and noteworthy. The courage and efficiency which\r\nhave often been displayed by its officers and men in hard-fought\r\nengagements with Moro outlaws or with organized bands of thieves\r\nand brigands have been beyond praise. Many of its officers have\r\nrendered invaluable service in bringing the people of the more\r\nunruly non-Christian tribes under governmental control, not only\r\nbravely and efficiently performing their duty as police officers,\r\nbut assisting in trail construction or discharging, in effect, the\r\nduties of lieutenant-governors in very remote places which could be\r\nvisited by the actual lieutenant-governors only infrequently. I later\r\ntake occasion to mention the valuable work done by Lieutenant Case\r\nin the early days of Ifugao, and to dwell at length on the splendid\r\nservice rendered there by Lieutenant Jeff D. Gallman, who was for\r\nmany years lieutenant-governor of the subprovince while continuing\r\nto serve as a constabulary officer. Lieutenant Maimban at Quiangan,\r\nand Lieutenant Dosser at Mayoyao, have been and are most useful,\r\nthough they do not hold official positions under the Mountain Province\r\nor receive any additional compensation for the special services which\r\nthey render. Captain Guy O. Fort served most acceptably as governor of\r\nthe province of Agusan during the interim between the resignation of\r\nGovernor Lewis and the appointment of Governor Bryant and Lieutenants\r\nAtkins and Zapanta have also rendered valuable service as assistants to\r\nthe provincial governor. Lieutenant Turnbull is now assistant to the\r\ngovernor of Nueva Vizcaya for work among the Ilongots on the Pacific\r\ncoast of northern Luzón. Other constabulary officers, who have not\r\nbeen called upon for special service of this kind, have performed\r\ntheir ordinary duties in such a way as to demonstrate that they were\r\nactuated by the spirit of coöperation and have been of great help.\r\n\r\nBut the work of the constabulary has not been confined to police\r\nduty. They have been of the greatest assistance to the Director of\r\nHealth in effectively maintaining quarantine, and making possible the\r\nisolation of victims of dangerous communicable diseases like cholera\r\nand smallpox, when inefficient municipal policemen have utterly failed\r\nto do their duty. They have given similar assistance to the Director\r\nof Agriculture in the maintenance of quarantine in connection with\r\nefforts to combat diseases of domestic animals. In great emergencies\r\nsuch as those presented by the recent eruption of Taal volcano, and\r\nthe devastation caused by great typhoons, they have been quick to\r\nrespond to the call of duty and have rendered efficient and heroic\r\nservice. They assist internal revenue officers. Except in a few of\r\nthe largest cities they are the firemen of the islands and by their\r\neffective work have repeatedly checked conflagrations, which are of\r\nfrequent occurrence and tend to be very destructive in this country,\r\nwhere most of the houses are built of bamboo and nipa palm, and\r\nwhere roofs become dry as tinder during the long period when there\r\nis little or no rain. They have aided in combating pests of locusts,\r\nand, in short, have been ready to meet almost any kind of an emergency\r\nwhich has arisen.\r\n\r\nThe importance of having such a body of alert, industrious,\r\ndisciplined, efficient men inspired by a high sense of duty, and\r\nphysically so well developed that they can continue to perform\r\nthat duty in the face of long-continued privations and hardships,\r\nis beyond dispute. The results which have been obtained by the\r\nPhilippine constabulary have abundantly justified the policy which\r\nled to its organization.\r\n\r\nIts task has been no sinecure. Eleven officers and one hundred\r\nninety-seven enlisted men have been killed in action. Forty-eight\r\nofficers and nine hundred ninety-one men have died of\r\ndisease. Forty-six officers have been wounded in action. Seven hundred\r\nsixty-eight men have been discharged for disability. Seven thousand\r\nfour hundred twenty-four firearms and 45,018 rounds of ammunition have\r\nbeen captured by, or surrendered to, the constabulary. Four thousand\r\neight hundred sixty-two outlaws have been killed and 11,977 taken\r\nprisoners. Twelve thousand two hundred sixty-two stolen animals have\r\nbeen recovered.\r\n\r\nThere are many things which are not brought home to the reader\r\nby such statistics. The weary days and nights on tropical trails;\r\nthe weakness and pain of dysentery; the freezing and the burning of\r\npernicious malaria; the heavy weight of responsibility when one must\r\nact, in matters of life and death, with no superior to consult; the\r\ndisappointment when carefully laid plans go wrong; the discouragement\r\ncaused by indifference; the danger of infection with loathsome\r\ndiseases; ingratitude; deadly peril; aching wounds; sudden death,\r\nand, worse yet, death after suffering long drawn out, when one meets\r\none's end knowing that it is coming and that one's family will be\r\nleft without means or resources,--these are some of the things that\r\nthe officers and men of this gallant corps have faced unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nThe work of the constabulary and of the Philippine scouts has\r\nconclusively demonstrated the courage and efficiency of the Filipino\r\nas a soldier when well disciplined and well led.\r\n\r\nThe establishment and maintenance of order in the Philippines have\r\nafforded opportunity for some of the bravest deeds in the annals of\r\nany race, and the opportunity has been nobly met. The head-hunters\r\nof the Mountain Province, the Mohammedan Moros of Mindanao, Joló\r\nand Palawan, the bloody _pulájanes_ of Samar and Leyte, the wily\r\n_tulisanes_ of Luzón, all unrestrained by any regard for the rules\r\nof civilized warfare, have for twelve years matched their fanatical\r\nbravery against the gallantry of the khaki-clad Filipino soldiers. Time\r\nand again a single officer and a handful of men have taken chances\r\nthat in almost any other land would have won them the Victoria cross,\r\nthe legion of honor, or some similar decoration. Here their only\r\nreward has been the sense of duty well done.\r\n\r\nThe force known as the Philippine constabulary was organized for the\r\npurpose of establishing and maintaining order. It has established\r\nand is maintaining a condition of order never before equalled or\r\napproached in the history of the islands. The policy which led to\r\nits organization has been a thousand times justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no branch of the public administration have there been more\r\nnumerous or more beneficial reforms than in the administration of\r\njustice. They have resulted in simplifying organization, in decreasing\r\nthe possibility of corruption and partiality, and in diminishing the\r\ncost of litigation and the time which it requires.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those especially interested I give in the appendix\r\nthe past and present organization of the courts. [495] The subject\r\nis too technical to interest the average layman.\r\n\r\nThe slender salaries paid to judges, the fact that in the majority\r\nof cases their appointment and promotion were due to influence and\r\nsuggestion, their liability to be transferred from one court to another\r\nor from the Philippines to the Antilles, as frequently happened, and\r\nthe further fact that the subordinate personnel of the courts was not\r\na salaried one, caused the administration of justice in the Philippine\r\nIslands to be looked upon askance. There was a general belief, well\r\nfounded in many instances, that lawsuits were won through influence\r\nor bribery. Clerks and the subordinate personnel of the courts were\r\nreadily bribed. Indeed, they frequently demanded bribes from litigants,\r\nor from defendants in criminal cases, under promise to expedite the\r\ntrials if paid to do so, or under threat to commit some injustice\r\nif payment was not forthcoming. For many years after the American\r\noccupation justices of the peace received no salaries and had to look\r\nto fees for their compensation. This system worked wretchedly. The\r\npositions were only too often filled by very incompetent and unworthy\r\nmen, who stimulated litigation in order to make more money. Now all\r\njustices of the peace receive reasonable salaries.\r\n\r\nThe paying of regular salaries and the furnishing of necessary\r\noffices and supplies have done much to improve the work of justice\r\nof the peace courts, which are now presided over by men who average\r\nfar better than even their immediate predecessors.\r\n\r\nUntil they were put on a salary basis the work of the Filipino\r\njustices of the peace left much more to be desired than is lacking\r\nat present. In many instances they allowed gross brutalities,\r\nperpetrated by the rich on the poor, or by the strong on the weak,\r\nto go unpunished. The following case furnished me by an American\r\nteacher is typical of what has occurred only too often:--\r\n\r\n    \"On another occasion, I met the brother of my house _muchacha_,\r\n    [496] a boy about eight. He had a sort of protuberance on\r\n    one side caused by broken ribs which had not been set. I\r\n    questioned my _muchacha_. She said her step-father had kicked\r\n    the child across the room some weeks before and broken his\r\n    ribs. The next day, I took the child together with Señora\r\n    Bayot, the wife of the Governor's secretary, before the local\r\n    Justice of the Peace. Señora Bayot translated and the child\r\n    told the same story as had his sister. The Justice of the\r\n    Peace issued an order for the step-father to report to him\r\n    on the next day. That night my _muchacha_ told me that her\r\n    step-father had threatened to kill the child if he did not\r\n    tell the Justice that he got the hurt by falling out of an\r\n    orange tree. The child did as ordered, and the step-father was\r\n    dismissed. When I questioned the Justice of the Peace as to\r\n    why he credited the second tale, he said the child was under\r\n    oath then, and was not under oath in the first statements.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not deemed wise at the outset to appoint a Filipino judge for\r\nthe city of Manila, as it was feared that there would be a lack of\r\nconfidence in a Filipino who had occasion to decide cases involving\r\nlarge sums of money in which Americans or foreigners on the one hand\r\nand Filipinos on the other were interested; but a few years after\r\nthe establishment of the new judicial system Filipino judges had won\r\nsuch a reputation for justice and fairness as to gain the confidence\r\nof Americans and foreigners and the appointment of a Filipino judge\r\nfor the court of the city of Manila did not arouse any opposition.\r\n\r\nFilipino judges of courts of first instance seem usually to have\r\nbeen actuated by a desire to do full justice. The instances in which\r\ncomplaints have been made against them because of partiality to party\r\nor to race are few. Some of them have been justly criticised for\r\ntardiness in cleaning up their dockets, and it is undoubtedly true\r\nthat their capacity for turning out work is on the average below that\r\nof their Americans associates.\r\n\r\nThe fact must not be forgotten that Americans are in the majority\r\nin the Supreme Court, which reviews the decisions of courts of first\r\ninstance, and this undoubtedly exercises a restraining influence. It\r\nis not possible accurately to judge what would be the actions of a\r\nbody of men now subject to such control if it did not exist. It is\r\nfurthermore true that the Filipinos are more inclined to be suspicious\r\nof their own countrymen than of Americans, and there have been from\r\ntime to time specific requests from them that judges in certain\r\nprovinces be Americans.\r\n\r\nUnder the Spanish régime the fees paid by litigants were excessive\r\nand the use of stamped paper was compulsory. Its value ranged from\r\ntwenty-five centavos to two pesos for a folio of two sheets according\r\nto the amount involved in the suit. Now there are fixed fees of $8\r\nin civil suits, except in probate matters, where the fee is $12.\r\n\r\nIt was in the power of an unscrupulous litigant to make a lawsuit\r\nalmost eternal. In matters involving an amount exceeding $250 it was\r\nlawful to institute proceedings in the action whereby the decision of\r\nthe main issue was suspended pending decision of the proceedings, and\r\nas a decision was appealable to the _audiencia_, this was often done\r\nby attorneys who had an interest in delaying the suit. By instituting\r\none proceeding after another a suit could be indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nAnother method of securing delay was to object to the judge. In\r\ncase the judge denied the ground of the objection, a proceeding was\r\ninstituted against him and the trial of the main issue was turned over\r\nto another judge; although the proceeding arising out of the objection\r\ndid not suspend the trial of the main issue, when the time came to\r\ndecide the latter the decision was withheld until the proceeding\r\narising out of the objection was settled, and as this latter was one\r\nin connection with which other proceedings could be instituted which\r\nmight delay the decision and consequently the decision of the main\r\nissue, there was no end to the matter.\r\n\r\nTo-day all this has been stopped by the procedure in court. The\r\nchallenging of judges is not allowed, although they must refrain\r\nfrom the trial of any matter when they are disqualified in any way\r\nas regards it. Proceedings which suspend the trial of the main issue\r\ncannot be instituted. The procedure itself is more expeditious,\r\nthe time allowances and formalities have been reduced, and all the\r\nlong Spanish civil procedure regarding the presentation of evidence\r\nhas been shortened. Suits are settled with a speediness previously\r\nunknown. In order to avoid delay on the part of judges in rendering\r\ndecisions, an act has been passed prohibiting the payment of their\r\nsalaries without a certificate that they have no matter which has\r\nbeen awaiting decision for more than three months.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inquisitorial procedure which obtained under Spanish\r\nrule, the disposition of criminal cases was even slower than that\r\nof civil cases. The cause would be commenced, either _de officio_,\r\nby the judge who had a knowledge of the crime, or by the prosecuting\r\nattorney, or by virtue of private accusation on the part of the person\r\naggrieved. The case once started, the investigations made during the\r\nperiod known as the _sumario_ were conducted in the absence of the\r\naccused. The latter had no hand in the case, as it was thought that\r\nthe reserve and secrecy of the procedure ought not to be violated\r\nto the end that the accused might not frustrate the evidence of\r\nthe prosecution by preparing his defence. Owing many times to the\r\ninactivity of the judge or of the prosecuting attorney, to the great\r\namount of work which weighed down the courts--for actions were begun\r\nwhen there was knowledge of the commission of the crime, although the\r\nperpetrators were not known--and by the manipulations at other times\r\nof the private accuser to whose interest it was to harm the accused\r\nby delaying the _sumario_, this period was often made to extend over\r\nyears and years. Meanwhile the defendant was confined in prison,\r\nas no bail was allowed in any case in which the penalty was that of\r\n_presidio correccional_ (from six months and one day to six years'\r\nimprisonment) or greater. In addition to this the circumstance that all\r\ncriminal causes in the islands had to be sent for review to the proper\r\n_audiencia_, caused a large accumulation of old cases in these higher\r\ncourts, and this alone made their disposition a matter of some years.\r\n\r\nTo-day the procedure is rapid. Information having been brought against\r\nthe defendant, the trial is had in the same term or at most during\r\nthe next term of court. Sometimes the trial is suspended owing to the\r\nnon-appearance of witnesses, but it can be said that cases are rare\r\nwhere causes are pending in the docket of the court for a longer period\r\nthan two terms. Causes appealed to the Supreme Court are disposed of\r\npromptly, and as a general rule it does not take over six months to\r\nget a decision.\r\n\r\nDefendants in criminal cases have now been granted by the Philippine\r\nBill certain fundamentally important rights which they did not formerly\r\nenjoy; namely, to appear and defend in person or by counsel at every\r\nstage of the proceedings; to be informed of the nature and cause of the\r\naccusation; to testify as witnesses in their own behalf; to be exempt\r\nfrom testifying against themselves; to be confronted at the trial by,\r\nand to cross-examine, the witnesses against them; to have compulsory\r\nprocess issue for obtaining witnesses in their own favour; to have\r\nspeedy and public trials; to be admitted to bail with sufficient\r\nsureties in all cases, except for capital offences. None of these\r\nrights were enjoyed under the procedure in effect during the Spanish\r\nrégime. A man was prosecuted without being notified of the charges\r\nagainst him, and he was only made aware of the case against him after\r\nthe _sumario_. When all of the evidence of the prosecution had been\r\ntaken the accused was heard in his own defence. He was compelled\r\nto testify, and was subjected to a very inquisitorial examination,\r\nincluding questions which incriminated him. Although he had the right\r\nto compel witnesses for the prosecution to ratify over their signatures\r\nthe evidence against him given during the _sumario_, as the defence of\r\nthe majority of the accused was in the hands of attorneys _de officio_\r\nthey nearly always renounced this privilege of the defendant, and,\r\nas has already been said, bail was not admitted in any grave offence\r\nduring the trial.\r\n\r\nNo sentence of acquittal in a criminal case can now be appealed from\r\nby the government. Under the Spanish system sentences of acquittal of\r\ncourts of first instance had to be referred for review to the proper\r\n_audiencia_ and the fiscal of the latter could appeal from a sentence\r\nof acquittal by it.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Bill grants to the inhabitants of the islands other\r\nimportant individual rights which they did not formerly possess.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish constitution was not in force here, and although the\r\nPenal Code contained provisions for punishing, in a way, officials who\r\nviolated certain rights granted by the Spanish constitution, citizens\r\nhad no expeditious method of securing their punishment. Now the Code of\r\nCivil Procedure grants them certain special remedies by which their\r\nrights can be made good. To illustrate: Under the Spanish régime\r\nthe only remedy for a man illegally detained was to bring a criminal\r\naction against the person illegally detaining him. He did not have\r\nthe remedy of the writ of habeas corpus nor the writ of prohibition\r\nagainst an official who attempted to make him the victim of some\r\nunlawful act. His only remedy was to bring a criminal action against\r\nsuch official, or to sue him for damages. He could not compel public\r\nofficials to perform their ministerial duties by mandamus proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe individual rights conferred by the Philippine Bill, and the\r\nspecial remedies granted by the Code of Civil Procedure, assure to the\r\ninhabitants of the islands liberties and privileges entirely unknown\r\nto them during the days of Spanish sovereignty, and these liberties\r\nand privileges are adequately safeguarded.\r\n\r\nTwo things still greatly complicate the administration of justice in\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe first is the dense ignorance of the people of the working class\r\nwho for the most part have failed to learn of their new rights,\r\nand even if they know them are afraid to attempt to assert them in\r\nopposition to the will of the _caciques_, whose power for evil they\r\nknow only too well.\r\n\r\nThe other is the unreliability of many witnesses and their\r\nshocking readiness to perjure themselves. It is always possible to\r\nmanufacture testimony at small expense. While the criminal libel\r\nsuit brought against certain members of the staff of the newspaper\r\n_El Renacimiento_, which libelled me, was in progress the judge\r\nshowed me the opinion of the two Filipino assessors [497] in one\r\nof the cases and told me that it was written by an attorney for the\r\ndefence. I could not believe this, but a few days later an assessor\r\nin another of the cases called at my house, bringing a draft of the\r\nopinion of himself and his associate which he sought to submit to\r\nme for criticism or modification, saying that I knew much more about\r\nthe case than they did! He was nonplussed at my refusal to read the\r\ndocument, and left saying \"_acqui tiene V. nuevo servidor_.\" [498]\r\nHad I redrafted the opinion, as I might have done, my \"new servant\"\r\nwould have called later for a _quid pro quo_.\r\n\r\nSome of the Filipino judges of first instance have proved weak in\r\nmatters affecting the integrity of public domain and the protection\r\nof the public forests, but on the whole these officers have done\r\nrather surprisingly well. It must be remembered that the best men\r\nin the islands have now been appointed, and that another generation\r\nmust come on before there will be available any considerable number\r\nof new candidates who are up to the standard of the present appointees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHealth Conditions\r\n\r\n\r\nI had abundant opportunity to observe health conditions in the\r\nPhilippines during the Spanish régime and they were shocking in the\r\nextreme. There were no provisions for the sanitary disposal of human\r\nwaste even in Manila. If one had occasion to be out on foot at night,\r\nit was wise to keep in the middle of the street and still wiser to\r\ncarry a raised umbrella.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the American occupation some five hundred barrels\r\nof caked excrement were taken from a single tower in one of the old\r\nManila monasteries. The moat around the city wall, and the _esteros_,\r\nor tidal creeks, reeked with filth, and the smells which assailed\r\none's nostrils, especially, at night, were disgusting.\r\n\r\nDistilled water was not to be had for drinking purposes. The\r\ncity water supply came from the Mariquina River, and some fifteen\r\nthousand Filipinos lived on or near the banks of that stream above the\r\nintake. The water was often so thick with sediment that one could not\r\nsee through a glass of it, and it was out of the question to attempt\r\nto get it boiled unless one had facilities of one's own.\r\n\r\nConditions in the provinces were proportionately worse. As a rule,\r\nthere was no evidence of any effort to put provincial towns into\r\ndecent sanitary conditions. I must, however, note one striking\r\nexception. Brigadier General Juan Arolas, long the governor of Joló,\r\nhad a thorough knowledge of modern sanitary methods and a keen\r\nappreciation of the benefits derivable from their application. When\r\nhe was sent to Joló, practically in banishment, the town was a plague\r\nspot to which were assigned Spaniards whose early demise would have\r\nbeen looked upon with favour by those in power. He converted it into\r\na healthy place the death rate of which compared favourably with that\r\nof European cities, thereby demonstrating conclusively what could\r\nbe done even under very unfavourable conditions. No troops in the\r\nislands were kept in anything like such physical condition as were\r\nthe regiments assigned to him, and he bore a lasting grudge against\r\nany one inconsiderate enough to die in Joló.\r\n\r\nEverywhere I saw people dying of curable ailments. Malaria was\r\nprevalent in many regions in which it was impossible to secure good\r\nquinine. The stuff on sale usually consisted largely of cornstarch,\r\nor plaster of Paris. Fortunately we had brought with us from the\r\nUnited States a great quantity of quinine and we made friends with\r\nthe Filipinos in many a town by giving this drug gratis to their sick.\r\n\r\nSmallpox was generally regarded as a necessary ailment of childhood. It\r\nwas a common thing to see children covered with the eruption of\r\nthis disease watching, or joining in, the play of groups of healthy\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of people who had died of smallpox was handed on to other\r\nmembers of the family, sometimes without even being washed. The victims\r\nof the disease often immersed themselves in cold water when their fever\r\nwas high, and paid the penalty for their ignorance with their lives.\r\n\r\nThe average Spaniard was a firm believer in the noxiousness of night\r\nair, which he said produced _paludismo_. [499] Most Filipinos were\r\nafraid of an imaginary spirit, devil or mythical creature known as\r\n_asuáng_, and closed their windows and doors after dark as a protection\r\nagainst it. Thus it came about that in a country where fresh air is\r\nespecially necessary at night no one got it.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis was dreadfully common, and its victims were conveying\r\nit to others without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nA distressingly large percentage of native-born infants died before\r\nreaching one year of age on account of infection at birth, insufficient\r\nclothing, or improper food. I have many times seen a native mother\r\nthrust boiled rice into the mouth of a child only a few days old,\r\nand I have seen babies taught to smoke tobacco before they could walk.\r\n\r\nBefore our party left the islands in 1888, cholera had broken out\r\nat a remote and isolated place. A little later it spread over a\r\nconsiderable part of the archipelago. On my return in 1890 I heard\r\nthe most shocking stories of what had occurred. Victims of this\r\ndisease were regarded with such fear and horror by their friends\r\nthat they were not infrequently carried out while in a state of\r\ncoma, and buried alive. It became necessary to issue orders to have\r\nshelters prepared in cemeteries under which bodies were required to\r\nbe deposited and left for a certain number of hours before burial,\r\nin order to prevent this result.\r\n\r\nIn Siquijor an unfortunate, carried to the cemetery after he had\r\nlost consciousness, came to himself, crawled out from under a mass\r\nof corpses which had been piled on top of him, got up and walked\r\nhome. When he entered his house, his assembled friends and relatives\r\nvacated it through the windows, believing him to be his own ghost. They\r\ndid not return until morning, when they found him dead on the floor.\r\n\r\nI heard a well-authenticated story of a case in which all the members\r\nof a family died except a creeping infant who subsisted for some time\r\nby sucking a breeding sow which was being kept in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nDuring the great cholera epidemic in 1882 it is said that the\r\napproaches to the Manila cemeteries were blocked with vehicles of\r\nevery description loaded with corpses, and that the stench from\r\nunburied bodies in the San Lazaro district was so dreadful that one\r\ncould hardly go through it.\r\n\r\nBeri-beri was common among the occupants of jails, lighthouses and\r\nother government institutions, as well as in certain garrisoned towns\r\nlike Balabac.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 I found the wife of a very dear Spanish friend dying from\r\nan ailment which in the United States could have been promptly and\r\ncertainly remedied by a surgical operation. I begged him to take her\r\nto Manila, telling him of the ease with which any fairly good surgeon\r\nwould relieve her, and promising to interest myself in her case on\r\nmy arrival there. To my utter amazement I found that there was not a\r\nsurgeon in the Philippine Islands who would venture to open the human\r\nabdomen. The one man who had sometimes done this in Spain stated that\r\nit would be impossible for him to undertake it in Manila, on account\r\nof the lack of a suitable operating room, of instruments and of the\r\nnecessary anaesthetist and other professional assistants. In fact, at\r\nthe time of the American occupation there was not a modern operating\r\nroom, much less a modern hospital, in the Philippines. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of people were perishing needlessly every year for the lack\r\nof surgical intervention. A common procedure in dealing with wounds\r\nwas to cover them with poultices of chewed tobacco, ashes, and leaves.\r\n\r\nIn many provinces the people were without medical assistance of\r\nany sort, and fell into the hands of native quacks who were little,\r\nif at all, better than witch doctors.\r\n\r\nThe most fantastic views were entertained relative to the causation\r\nof disease. In some towns it was vigorously asserted that after a\r\npeculiar looking black dog ran down the street cholera appeared. In\r\nother places cholera was generally ascribed to the poisoning of wells\r\nby Spaniards or foreigners.\r\n\r\nCemeteries were not infrequently situated in the very midst of towns,\r\nor near the local supplies of drinking water. Conditions within\r\ntheir walls were often shocking from an aesthetic view point. As the\r\narea available for burials was limited, and the graves were usually\r\nunmarked, parts of decomposed bodies were constantly being dug up. It\r\nwas the custom to throw such remains about the foot of the cross at\r\nthe centre of the cemetery.\r\n\r\nMilitary sanitation was also very bad. I was at Zamboanga when\r\nthe wreck of General Weyler's expedition to Lake Lanoa began to\r\nreturn. There had been no adequate provision for the medical care of\r\nthe force in the field, and the condition of many of the soldiers was\r\npitiable in the extreme. Disabled men were brought in by the shipload,\r\nand the hospitals at Zamboanga, Isabela de Basilan and Joló were soon\r\nfilled to overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe lack of adequate sanitary measures was equally in evidence in\r\ndealing with cattle disease. Rinderpest, a highly contagious and\r\nvery destructive disease of horned cattle, was introduced in 1888 and\r\nspread like fire in prairie grass. No real effort was made to check\r\nit prior to the American occupation, and it caused enormous losses,\r\nboth directly by killing large numbers of beef cattle and indirectly\r\nby depriving farmers of draft animals.\r\n\r\nWhen I first visited the islands every member of our party fell\r\nill within a few weeks. All of us suffered intensely from tropical\r\nulcers. Two had malaria; one had dysentery; one, acute inflammation\r\nof the liver, possibly of amoebic origin; and so on to the end of\r\nthe chapter. I myself got so loaded up with malaria in Mindoro that\r\nit took me fifteen years to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nFortunately the American army of occupation brought with it numerous\r\ncompetent physicians and surgeons, and abundant hospital equipment\r\nand supplies, for the soldiers promptly contracted about all the\r\ndifferent ailments to be acquired in the islands.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Manila on the 5th of March, 1899, I found that a\r\ngreat army hospital, called the \"First Reserve,\" had been established\r\nin the old rice market. There was another sizable one on the Bagumbayan\r\ndrive. A third occupied a large building belonging to French sisters\r\nof charity which was ordinarily used for school purposes.\r\n\r\nIn immediate connection with the First Reserve Hospital was a tent\r\nhospital where sick and wounded Insurgents were being given the best\r\nof care.\r\n\r\nField hospitals were promptly established as the troops moved out\r\nfrom Manila, and in connection with many of these Filipinos were given\r\nmuch needed medical and surgical help. The recipients of such kindly\r\ntreatment were, however, prohibited by Insurgent officers from telling\r\nothers of their experiences lest the hatred of Americans diminish as\r\na result.\r\n\r\nSmallpox had broken out among the Spanish soldiers in the walled\r\ncity and was spreading badly when my friend, Major Frank S. Bourns\r\nof the army medical corps, was given the task of eradicating it,\r\nwhich he promptly accomplished. A little later the use of the Santa\r\nAna church as a smallpox hospital was authorized, and sick Filipinos\r\nwere carefully tended there.\r\n\r\nThe army promptly set about cleaning up Manila and waging war\r\nupon the more serious ailments which threatened the health of the\r\nsoldiers and that of the public. The work was at the outset put under\r\nthe direction of Major Edie, a very capable and efficient medical\r\nofficer. Subsequently it was turned over to Major Bourns, who, on\r\naccount of his intimate knowledge of Spanish, and his wide acquaintance\r\nwith the Filipinos, was able to carry out many much-needed reforms,\r\nand in doing so aroused a minimum of public antagonism.\r\n\r\nUpon the establishment of civil government Governor Taft was very\r\ndesirous of retaining Major Bourns's services, but this did not prove\r\npracticable, as he desired to give up government work and engage in\r\nprivate business.\r\n\r\nThere was promptly created an efficient board of health made up of men\r\nof recognized ability and large practical experience. Its chairman was\r\nMajor Louis M. Maus, commissioner of public health. The other members\r\nwere Mr. H. D. Osgood, sanitary engineer; Dr. Franklin H. Meacham,\r\nchief sanitary inspector; Dr. Paul C. Freer, superintendent of\r\ngovernment laboratories; and Dr. Manuel Gomez, secretary.\r\n\r\nThis board was promptly put upon its mettle. It had inherited from\r\nthe army an incipient epidemic of bubonic plague in Manila, and\r\nthe disease soon spread to Cavite and also to Cebú, then the second\r\nport of the Philippines in commercial importance. It also appeared in\r\nseveral provincial towns near Cavite. An effective campaign against it,\r\ninaugurated at this time, was never abandoned until it was completely\r\neradicated in 1906,--a noteworthy result to achieve in a country like\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1902, I was advised that two patients at San Juan de\r\nDios hospital were developing symptoms of Asiatic cholera, and on the\r\nfollowing day a positive laboratory diagnosis was made. Other cases\r\nfollowed in quick succession, and we soon found ourselves facing a\r\nvirulent epidemic of this highly dangerous disease. At the outset\r\nthe mortality was practically 100 per cent. Unfortunately, there was\r\nno one connected with the medical service of the islands who had had\r\npractical experience in dealing with cholera, and we had to get this\r\nas we went along.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the outbreak, Governor Taft was in the United States,\r\nActing Governor Wright was in Leyte, the secretary of finance and\r\njustice was in Japan, and there were present in Manila only the\r\nsecretary of public instruction and the secretary of the interior. As\r\nthe executive head of the government was absent, and there was no\r\nquorum of the legislative body, I of necessity arrogated to myself\r\npowers which I did not lawfully possess, appointing employees and\r\nincurring expenses without the usual formalities.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 22 I informed General Chaffee that four cases\r\nof cholera had occurred in Manila, and requested that an adequate\r\nmilitary force be despatched to the valley of the Mariquina River to\r\nprotect the city water supply from possible contamination.\r\n\r\nThis request was promptly acceded to, and the guard thereafter\r\nmaintained proved adequate to prevent infection of the city water,\r\nalthough there are three towns on the river above the intake, and it\r\nwas the custom of their people to bathe and wash their clothing in\r\nthis stream. Many of the filthy surface wells of the city were filled\r\nas rapidly as possible, and those that could not be filled were closed.\r\n\r\nThe people, entirely unaccustomed as they were to any sanitary\r\nrestrictions, believing that the disease was not cholera, and firm in\r\ntheir conviction that they had a right to do whatever they liked so\r\nlong as they kept on their own premises, bitterly resented the burning\r\nor disinfection of their houses and effects, and the restriction of\r\ntheir liberty to go and come as they pleased, and in spite of the\r\nfact that the number of cases was kept down in a manner never before\r\ndreamed of at Manila, there arose an increasingly bitter feeling of\r\nhostility toward the work of the board of health. In fact, the very\r\nsuccess of the campaign proved an obstacle, and we were assured that\r\nthe disease could not be cholera, as, if it were, there would be a\r\nthousand deaths a day!\r\n\r\nAn educational campaign was immediately begun, and simple\r\ndirections for avoiding infection were published and scattered\r\nbroadcast. Distilled water was furnished gratis to all who would drink\r\nit, stations for its distribution being established through the city\r\nand supplemented by large water wagons driven through the streets. The\r\nsale of foods likely to convey the disease was prohibited. Large\r\nnumbers of emergency sanitary inspectors were immediately appointed,\r\nand every effort was made to detect all cases as soon as possible. A\r\nland quarantine was established around the city, to protect the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of a possible extensive outbreak of contagious disease\r\na detention camp capable of accommodating some twenty-five hundred\r\npeople had been established previously on the San Lazaro grounds, and\r\nto this place were taken the cholera \"contacts.\" A cholera hospital\r\nwas opened near this camp, and the stricken were removed to it from\r\ntheir homes as speedily as possible, the buildings which they had\r\noccupied being thoroughly disinfected, or burned if disinfection\r\nwas impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the dead were at the outset either buried in hermetically\r\nsealed coffins or cremated. When the detention camp and hospital at\r\nSan Lazaro threatened to become crowded, a second camp and hospital\r\nwere established at Santa Mesa. At this latter place both \"contacts\"\r\nand the sick were obliged to live in tents.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish residents were allowed to establish a private cholera\r\nhospital in a large and well-ventilated _convento_ on Calle Herran. As\r\nthe number of sick Spaniards was nothing like sufficient to fill this\r\nbuilding, they were asked to turn over the unoccupied space in it to\r\nthe board of health, which they most generously did.\r\n\r\nIn response to popular clamour a hospital under strictly Filipino\r\nmanagement was opened in a nipa building in Tondo. Interest in it\r\nsoon flagged, and the government found itself with this institution\r\non its hands.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic came soon after the close of a long-continued war,\r\nand there were at that time in Manila not a few evil-intentioned\r\npersons, both foreign and native, who welcomed every opportunity\r\nto make trouble. The difficulties arising from the claim advanced\r\nby a number of reputable but ignorant medical men that the disease\r\nwas not cholera at all were sufficiently great. They were enormously\r\nincreased by false and malicious stories to the effect that \"contacts\"\r\nwere killed at the detention camp; that patients on arrival at the\r\ncholera hospital were given a drink of poisoned _vino_ [500] and\r\ninstantly dropped dead; that the distilled water distributed free of\r\ncharge was poisoned, and that the Americans were poisoning the wells.\r\n\r\nThe necessary use of strychnine as a heart stimulant at the cholera\r\nhospital was made the basis for a story that the sick were being\r\npoisoned with this drug.\r\n\r\nThese silly tales were widely circulated and quite generally believed,\r\nand as a result of the fear thus engendered, and of the desire on\r\nthe part of relatives and neighbours of stricken persons to escape\r\ndisinfection and quarantine, strong efforts were often made to conceal\r\nthe sick and the dead, and when this was not possible the \"contacts\"\r\nusually ran away. There were not wanting instances of the driving of\r\ncholera victims into the streets.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the generally hostile attitude of the public and some\r\ngrave mistakes in policy, the measures adopted sufficed at the outset\r\nto hold the disease in check to an extent which surprised even the\r\nhealth officers themselves.\r\n\r\nOn May 15 there began a rapid and quite steady decline in the number\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\nIn June, however, it increased. During July it grew steadily larger,\r\nand on the 25th of that month there were ninety-one cases, the\r\nlargest number which has ever occurred in Manila on any day since\r\nthe American occupation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the early months of the epidemic Major Maus had laboured\r\nunceasingly to check it, displaying an energy and an indifference to\r\nfatigue and personal discomfort which were highly commendable. The\r\nlong-continued strain ultimately began to tell on him severely. On\r\nMay 17 orders were received from the Adjutant-General's Office\r\nproviding for his relief on or about July 30, and stating that Major\r\nE. C. Carter, of the United States Army Medical Corps, would be\r\navailable for detail as commissioner of public health on that date,\r\nif his services were desired. Arrangements were accordingly made to\r\nhave Major Carter proceed to the Philippines. Major Maus's resignation\r\nwas accepted, effective July 31. Dr. Frank S. Bourns was urged to\r\ntake temporary charge of the situation, and consented to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of August Major Carter arrived and announced his readiness\r\nto assume his duties, but it was suggested to him that he ought first\r\nto have some time to familiarize himself with them, and Dr. Bourns\r\nwas left free to carry out the special work for which he had been\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nThis he did with promptness and despatch, the number of cases for\r\nAugust being but seven hundred twenty as against thirteen hundred\r\nsixty-eight for the previous month. On the 8th of September, having\r\nbrought the disease under control at Manila, he insisted on resigning\r\nin order to attend to his private affairs, which were suffering from\r\nneglect, and his resignation was reluctantly accepted.\r\n\r\nDr. Bourns's remarkable success in dealing with a very difficult\r\nsituation was largely due to his ability to devise measures which,\r\nwhile thoroughly effective, were less irritating to the public than\r\nwere those which had been previously employed.\r\n\r\nThe policy which he had inaugurated was followed by his successor\r\nwith the result that the cases fell to two hundred seventy-five\r\nin September and eighty-eight in October. In November there was\r\na slight recrudescence, but the disease did not again threaten to\r\nescape control and in February practically disappeared, there being\r\nbut two cases during the entire month.\r\n\r\nThe return of hot, damp weather again produced a slight recrudescence,\r\nand scattering cases continued to occur until March, when the epidemic\r\nof 1902-1904 ended in Manila.\r\n\r\nIn view of the conditions which then prevailed and of the extreme\r\nrisk of a general infection of the city water supply, which, had it\r\noccurred, would doubtless have resulted in the death of a third of\r\nthe population, this is a record of which the Bureau of Health may\r\nwell be proud.\r\n\r\nThe effort to prevent the spread of infection by maintaining a land\r\nquarantine around Manila proved entirely ineffective. The disease\r\npromptly appeared in the provinces where the campaign against it\r\nwas from the outset in charge of newly appointed Filipino presidents\r\nof provincial boards of health, aided, when practicable, by medical\r\ninspectors from Manila.\r\n\r\nBefore it was finally checked in Manila there were 5581 cases with\r\n4386 deaths; while in the provinces, in many of which it necessarily\r\nlong ran its course practically unhindered, there were 160,671 cases,\r\nwith 105,075 deaths.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of April, 1904, the Board of Health passed the following\r\nresolutions:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whereas cases of Asiatic cholera have occurred in but three\r\n    provincial towns of the Philippine Islands since February 8,\r\n    1904; and\r\n\r\n    \"Whereas only one case of Asiatic cholera has been reported as\r\n    occurring any place in the Philippine Islands since March 8,\r\n    1904; and\r\n\r\n    \"Whereas the city of Manila was declared on March 23 to be\r\n    free from the infection of Asiatic cholera; On motion\r\n\r\n    \"_Resolved_, That the islands composing the Philippine\r\n    Archipelago are, and are hereby declared to be, free from\r\n    the infection of Asiatic cholera; and\r\n\r\n    \"_Be it further resolved_, That the Commissioner of Public\r\n    Health be directed to send a copy of these resolutions to the\r\n    honourable the Secretary of the Interior, the Municipal Board,\r\n    the United States Marine-Hospital Service, and the Collector\r\n    of Customs.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, however, it later proved that cholera was endemic\r\nin certain swampy regions near Manila, and in 1905 we found ourselves\r\nwith a new epidemic on our hands.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second week, beginning August 23, there had been one\r\nhundred thirty-seven cases, as compared with one hundred twenty-five\r\nfor the same period during the epidemic of 1902-1904.\r\n\r\nHowever, the conditions for combating cholera were now far more\r\nfavourable than in 1902. Major E. C. Carter had at his own request been\r\nrelieved from duty as commissioner of public health, and Dr. Victor\r\nG. Heiser, passed assistant surgeon of the United States public\r\nhealth and marine hospital service, had been appointed to succeed\r\nhim on April 5, 1905. Dr. Heiser was a highly trained officer of one\r\nof the most efficient services which has ever been organized for the\r\ncombating of contagious and infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nHe had under him in the city of Manila a small but thoroughly trained\r\nbody of twenty-four medical inspectors, of whom nineteen were Americans\r\nand five Filipinos. Profiting by his previous experience and that of\r\nhis predecessors in the Philippine service, he inaugurated a campaign\r\nwhich practically terminated the epidemic in Manila on February 21,\r\n1906, [501] with a total of two hundred eighty-three cases and two\r\nhundred forty-three deaths.\r\n\r\nThis brief and decisive campaign reflects the greatest credit on all\r\nconcerned with it.\r\n\r\nThe board of health had one great advantage in the fact that the San\r\nLazaro contagious disease hospital had been completed. This building,\r\nwith its cool wards and attractive surroundings, made it possible to\r\ngive cholera victims the best of care.\r\n\r\nThere was at the outset little or no fear of this hospital, but\r\napparently this condition of things was not satisfactory to that\r\nsmall but dangerous element of the Manila public which from the time\r\nof the American occupation has never let pass any opportunity to make\r\ntrouble. As usual, the medium of attack was the local press. _Soberanía\r\nNacional_ published a most extraordinary article painting in vivid\r\ncolours the alleged horrors of the San Lazaro Hospital, and stating\r\namong other things that the naked bodies of the dead, tagged and with\r\ntheir feet tied together, lay about the entrance of that institution. A\r\nmore false statement was never published.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after its appearance terror reigned among\r\nthe lower classes, and living and dead cholera victims were being\r\nsmuggled out of the city to neighbouring towns.\r\n\r\nFeeling that the vicious attitude of a certain section of the press\r\nhad cost lives enough, I sent the editor of this paper a courteous\r\ninvitation to call at my office. He made no response. I then wrote\r\nhim, demanding a retraction, and sending him a correct statement to\r\npublish. [502]\r\n\r\nHe was at first disposed to argue the matter, but finding that I\r\nmeant business published the article which I sent to him and made\r\nthe following retraction:--\r\n\r\n    \"We are exceedingly glad to affirm in the honour of truth and\r\n    justice, that the news given by us on the seventh instant under\r\n    the title 'Painful Scenes,' and 'Naked Dead,' is absolutely\r\n    absurd, false and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n    \"We have investigated the truth of the said notice, and can\r\n    affirm to our readers that it is entirely inaccurate, as in\r\n    the courtyard of the said hospital the naked dead that we\r\n    have spoken of are not now exposed, nor have they ever been\r\n    so exposed.\r\n\r\n    \"The truth is above all things, and to rectify a baseless\r\n    piece of news should not be a doubtful action on the part\r\n    of the person who gave the news, but rather something in his\r\n    favour that the public should appreciate it at its full value.\r\n\r\n    \"To conclude, we must record our gratitude to the Secretary\r\n    of the Interior, the Hon. Dean C. Worcester, for the\r\n    investigations made in the premises with the purpose of\r\n    ascertaining the truth of the alleged facts, and for the\r\n    courteous way in which he received us this morning when\r\n    interviewed by one of our reporters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the provinces the results of the campaign against cholera were\r\nfar less satisfactory than in Manila as was to be anticipated, owing\r\nto lack of adequate personnel, but the cases, which numbered 34,238\r\nand deaths which numbered 22,938, were far fewer than during the\r\nprevious epidemic.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt here to trace the course of the subsequent\r\nepidemics which have occurred from time to time, but shall content\r\nmyself with giving the deaths by years. In 1908, they numbered 18,811;\r\nin 1909, 7306; in 1910, 6940; in 1911, 203. In 1912, there were none,\r\nand thus far in 1913 there have been none. [503]\r\n\r\nThe superstitious practices which were formerly employed by the\r\nFilipinos to combat this scourge have given way to simple and\r\ninexpensive hygienic measures, and we can safely count on sufficient\r\ncoöperation from the people to make an effective campaign possible\r\nwhen it next appears.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the strain of the early days of the first\r\nepidemic. Two of my best men, Dr. Meacham and Mr. Mudge, literally\r\nworked themselves to death, remaining on duty when they knew that\r\nthey were in imminent danger, and in the end laying down their lives\r\nwillingly for an alien and hostile people. Such things make one proud\r\nof being an American.\r\n\r\nAt times the situation was not devoid of amusing features. I had\r\noccasion to visit one of the northern provinces, where the epidemic was\r\nespecially severe, in an effort to calm the panic-stricken populace. I\r\nstayed with the governor, a very intelligent Filipino. For obvious\r\nreasons I investigated his domestic arrangements, finding that he\r\nwas boiling drinking water, thoroughly cooking all food, and taking\r\nall usual and necessary precautions to prevent infection.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his house the first evening, after a short absence, I\r\nfound the grounds decorated with lighted Japanese lanterns. Supposing\r\nthat the proverbial Filipino hospitality had risen above even such\r\nuntoward circumstances as those which then existed, I asked the\r\ngovernor what the entertainment was to be. In evident perplexity he\r\nreplied that he had not planned to have any entertainment, and on\r\nmy inquiring what the lanterns were for, said he had heard that they\r\nwere good to keep away cholera germs!\r\n\r\nI have referred to the fact that the civil government inherited a\r\nfairly well developed epidemic of bubonic plague. In 1901 this disease\r\ncaused four hundred twenty-seven deaths, in 1902 it caused ten only,\r\nbut the demands made on the sanitary force by the cholera epidemic\r\nwhich began in that year rendered it impossible to give to plague\r\nthe attention which it otherwise would have had, with the result\r\nthat in 1903 we had one hundred seventy-four deaths. In 1904 there\r\nwere seventy-eight; in 1905, forty-three; in 1906, seven; in 1907,\r\nnone; and from 1907 until 1912, none. In the latter year the disease\r\nwas reintroduced.\r\n\r\nRats become infected with it, and fleas transmit it from them to human\r\nbeings. It was probably brought in by pestiferous rodents hidden\r\ninside packages of vegetables, as it appeared in a district where\r\ncrates of vegetables are opened in large numbers, and did not appear\r\nin the vicinity of the piers, although shore rats are abundant there,\r\nand if diseased rodents had landed from shipping, would promptly have\r\nbecome infected,--a thing which did not occur.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time plague also appeared at Iloilo, where it was\r\neradicated with a total of nine deaths. At Manila there have been\r\nup to the present time [504] fifty-nine deaths, and scattering cases\r\ncontinue to occur at considerable intervals.\r\n\r\nHad plague not been promptly and effectively combated, it would\r\nunquestionably have spread rapidly, causing untold misery and heavy\r\nproperty losses.\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, at the time of the American occupation\r\nsmallpox was by many people regarded as an almost inevitable ailment\r\nof childhood. It proved necessary to secure the passage of legislation\r\nforbidding the inoculation of human beings with it to prevent misguided\r\nFilipinos from deliberately communicating it to their children, not\r\nbecause they did not dearly love them, but because they regarded\r\ninfection with it as a calamity sure to come sooner or later, and\r\ndesired to have it over with once for all.\r\n\r\nWe have performed more than ten million vaccinations, with the result\r\nthat the annual deaths from this disease have decreased from forty\r\nthousand at the outset to seven hundred for the year just ended. There\r\nis now less smallpox in Manila than in Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the six provinces nearest Manila it was killing, on the average,\r\nsix thousand persons annually. For a year after we finished vaccinating\r\nthe inhabitants of these provinces it did not cause a death among them;\r\nnor has it since caused such a death except among new-born children\r\nor newly arrived unvaccinated persons.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary results have been achieved without the loss of\r\na life or a limb so far as we know. The vaccine used was prepared by\r\nour own Bureau of Science with extraordinary care, and has proved to\r\nbe remarkably pure and active.\r\n\r\nWe at first endeavoured to have vaccinations performed by local\r\nFilipino health officers, but, after spending large sums without\r\nobtaining satisfactory results, gave up this plan and substituted\r\ntherefor a method of procedure by which the work was carried on under\r\nthe very immediate supervision of the director of health. We then made\r\nsubstantial progress. However, under the law as it at present stands,\r\nsucceeding annual vaccination, intended to insure the immunization\r\nof children soon after they are born and of unvaccinated persons who\r\nmay come into a given territory, are intrusted to the local Filipino\r\nauthorities, with the result that in very many cases they are not\r\nattended to. We get elaborate returns showing the number of persons\r\nvaccinated. Then comes an outbreak of smallpox, and on investigation\r\nwe learn that the vaccinations so fully reported were made on paper\r\nonly! In other words, the continuance of this work, of such vital\r\nimportance to the Filipino people, is still directly dependent upon\r\ncontinued control by American health officers.\r\n\r\nAnother great problem now in a fair way to final solution is the\r\neradication of leprosy. At the outset we were told by the church\r\nauthorities that there were thirty thousand lepers in the islands. In\r\n1905 we began to isolate and care for all supposed victims of this\r\ndisease, only to find that many outcasts believed to be suffering\r\nfrom it were really afflicted with curable ailments. We were able to\r\nrestore a very large number of them to society, to their great joy\r\nand that of their friends.\r\n\r\nA few hundreds of true lepers were being humanely cared for in\r\nManila and elsewhere. Many others had been driven out of the towns\r\ninto forests or waste places on the larger islands, where they were\r\nperishing miserably from fever and other diseases. Still others had\r\nbeen isolated on sand quays, where they were in danger of dying from\r\nthirst during the dry season. Not a few wandered through the towns\r\nat will, spreading the disease broadcast.\r\n\r\nAll known lepers are now cared for at Culion, a healthful, sanitary\r\ntown with good streets, excellent water and sewer systems, many modern\r\nconcrete buildings and a first-class hospital.\r\n\r\nThey are not confined to the limits of the town, but wander at will,\r\nexcept that they are excluded from the immediate vicinity of the\r\nhouses of the officers and employees of the colony.\r\n\r\nThey may have their little farms, and raise pigs, chickens, vegetables,\r\netc., if they wish. They may, and do, float about over the waters of\r\nthe neighbouring bay in boats or on rafts, and fish to their hearts'\r\ncontent. They are well fed and well cared for, and their physical\r\ncondition improves to a marked degree promptly after their arrival at\r\nthe colony. The only hardship which they suffer is that necessarily\r\ninvolved in separation from their relatives and friends, and this is\r\nmitigated by occasional visits which the latter may make them.\r\n\r\nSince we began to isolate lepers, their number has decreased to\r\napproximately three thousand, and with a continuance of the present\r\npolicy the disease should soon disappear from the Philippines.\r\n\r\nDuring the period immediately subsequent to the American occupation,\r\namoebic dysentery wrought sad havoc both among our soldiers and among\r\ncivil government officers and employees. Four of my own family of five\r\nhad it, and one had it twice, in spite of the fact that we took all\r\nknown precautions; and the experience of my family was by no means\r\nexceptional. This disease then annually cost the lives of a large\r\nnumber of American men and women, and a considerable additional\r\nnumber went home invalids for life as a result of infection with\r\nit. We seemed to hear almost daily of some new case.\r\n\r\nCareful scientific investigation carried on at the bureau of science\r\ntaught us the best methods of combating this type of dysentery,\r\nand the proper disposal of human feces, the regulation of methods\r\nused in fertilizing vegetables, improvement in supplies of drinking\r\nwater, and other simple, hygienic measures have reduced the deaths\r\nfrom it among Americans to an almost negligible minimum. Such cases\r\nas occur are almost without exception detected early, and readily\r\nyield to treatment.\r\n\r\nThe belief that Filipinos do not suffer from this disease has proved\r\nto be without foundation. It kills thousands of them every year. Those\r\nwho are willing to adopt the simple precautions which experience has\r\nshown to be necessary may enjoy the large degree of immunity from it\r\nwhich Americans now have.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of amoebic dysentery in the Philippines has undoubtedly\r\nbeen infected drinking water. From time immemorial the people have\r\nbeen obtaining their water for drinking purposes from flowing streams,\r\nopen springs or shallow surface wells.\r\n\r\nThe wells were especially dangerous, as it was the common custom\r\nto wash clothing around them so that water containing disease germs\r\nfrequently seeped into wells used by whole villages. The results of\r\nsuch conditions during a cholera epidemic can readily be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe drinking supplies of many provincial towns have now been radically\r\nimproved by the sinking of 853 successful artesian wells.\r\n\r\nIn many places there has been a resulting reduction of more than\r\nfifty per cent in the annual death rate. Large sums are spent yearly\r\nby the government in drilling additional wells,--a policy which is\r\nwarmly approved by the common people. The recent appropriations for\r\nthis purpose have been $255,000 for the fiscal year 1912, $60,000\r\nfor 1913 and $200,000 for 1914.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the islands, malaria was killing as many persons\r\nas was smallpox. The mortality caused by it is now being greatly\r\nreduced by giving away annually millions of doses of quinine, and by\r\ndraining or spraying with petroleum places where mosquitoes breed,\r\nas well as by teaching the people the importance of sleeping under\r\nmosquito nets and the necessity of keeping patients suffering from\r\nactive attacks of malaria where mosquitoes cannot get at them. Only\r\nquinine of established quality is allowed in the market.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained in combating malaria are often very\r\nstriking. Calapan, the capital of Mindoro, was in Spanish days known as\r\n\"the white man's grave\" on account of the prevalence of \"pernicious\r\nfever\" there. To-day it is an exceptionally healthy provincial town.\r\n\r\nAt Iwahig, in Palawan, the Spaniards attempted to conduct a\r\npenal colony. They were compelled to abandon it on account of\r\npernicious malaria, which caused continued serious mortality when\r\nthe American government attempted to establish a similar institution\r\nthere. Application of the usual sanitary measures has made it a\r\nhealthful place.\r\n\r\nOld jails throughout the islands have been rendered sanitary,\r\nor replaced by new ones. The loathsome skin diseases from which\r\nprisoners formerly suffered have in consequence disappeared. The\r\npractical results obtained in Bilibid, the insular penitentiary, are\r\nworthy of special note. The annual death rate at this institution was\r\n78.25 per thousand for the calendar year 1904. It increased steadily\r\neach month from January, 1904, to September, 1905, when it reached\r\nits maximum, deaths occurring at the rate of 241.15 per thousand per\r\nyear. At this time the director of health was given charge of the\r\nsanitation of this prison.\r\n\r\nBy remedying overcrowding, improving drainage, installing sewers and\r\nregulating diet along scientific lines, the rate was reduced in six\r\nmonths to 70 per 1000, and there it stuck.\r\n\r\nA systematic examination of the stools of prisoners was then\r\nmade. Eighty-four per cent were found to be afflicted with at least\r\none intestinal parasite. Fifty per cent had two or more, and twenty\r\nper cent had three or more. Fifty-two per cent of the total had\r\nhookworm. Active treatment for the elimination of these parasites was\r\nbegun in one barrack, and after the work was completed it was noted\r\nthat there was much less disease there than in the remainder. All\r\nof the thirty-five hundred prisoners were ultimately examined,\r\nand intestinal parasites eradicated if present. The death rate then\r\ndropped to thirteen to the thousand, and has remained at or near this\r\nfigure up to the present time.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the discovery of the cause of beri-beri,\r\nand to the effect of the governor-general's order forbidding the\r\nuse of polished rice in government institutions or by government\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nI subsequently made a strong effort to secure legislation imposing\r\na heavy internal revenue tax on polished rice, thus penalizing its\r\nuse. I failed, but such effort will be renewed by some one, let us\r\nhope with ultimate success.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish days cholera, leprosy, smallpox and other dangerous\r\ncommunicable diseases were constantly reintroduced from without. This\r\nis no longer the case. The United States public health and marine\r\nhospital service has stretched an effective defensive line around the\r\narchipelago and has sent its outposts to Hongkong, Shanghai and Amoy,\r\nto prevent, so far as possible, the embarkation for Manila of persons\r\nsuffering from such ailments. We now have the most effective quarantine\r\nsystem in the tropics, and one of the best in the world. At Mariveles\r\nthere is a very large and complete disinfecting plant, and vessels\r\nmay also be satisfactorily disinfected at Cebú and Iloilo.\r\n\r\nThis quarantine service kept the Philippines free from bubonic plague\r\nfor seven years, and has repeatedly prevented the entry of pneumonic\r\nplague, that most deadly of all known diseases.\r\n\r\nA peculiar and shockingly disfiguring disease known as yaws occurs\r\nsomewhat infrequently in the Philippine lowlands and is very prevalent\r\nin a number of places in the highlands. In many ways it resembles\r\nsyphilis, and indeed at one time was considered to be syphilitic\r\nin its origin. Doctor Richard P. Strong, of the Bureau of Science,\r\nmade the very important discovery that salvarsan is an absolute\r\nspecific for it. The effect of an injection of this remedy closely\r\napproaches a miracle in medicine. In five or six days the condition\r\nof the patient begins to improve rapidly. By the end of the second\r\nweek his horrible sores have healed.\r\n\r\nIt was with this remedy that we began our health work among some of\r\nthe wilder head-hunters of northern Luzón. Think of the advantage of\r\nbeing absolutely certain of curing such an ailment in every case, and\r\nthink of the gratitude of poor wretches, undergoing untold suffering,\r\nwhen they were almost immediately relieved!\r\n\r\nSoon after this use for salvarsan was discovered, I caused a liberal\r\nsupply of it to be sent to the Bontoc Hospital. For some time we\r\nwere unable to persuade any victims of yaws to undergo treatment,\r\nbut finally we found one at Barlig who was guilty of a minor criminal\r\noffence, arrested him, and took him to Bontoc. Instead of putting\r\nhim in jail there, we sent him to the hospital for treatment.\r\n\r\nAt first he complained bitterly that we were putting no medicine\r\non his sores. Then the remedy began to work and he decided it was\r\n\"strong medicine.\" By the tenth day he was running around town\r\njoyfully exhibiting his rapidly healing body to every one who would\r\nlook at it. On the fourteenth day he suddenly disappeared, to the\r\ndeep regret of the medical men, who had hoped that they might keep\r\nhim as an example of what could be done, and thus persuade others\r\nto undergo treatment. A few days later, however, he reappeared with\r\nthirteen victims of yaws from his home town, having meanwhile twice\r\ncovered on foot the great distance which separates Barlig from Bontoc,\r\nand assembled and brought in his fellow-sufferers.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the people of Manila were formerly supplied with\r\nimpure drinking water from the Mariquina River, and were therefore in\r\nconstant danger of infection with cholera and other deadly diseases. At\r\na cost of some $1,500,000 we have given the city a modern water system,\r\nthe intake of which is far up in the hills above the last village. The\r\nannual deaths from ordinary water-borne diseases exclusive of cholera\r\nhave fallen from 3558--the average number at the time the new system\r\nwas introduced--to 1195. Recently a leak in the dam, which necessitated\r\ntemporary resumption of the use of the Mariquina River water, was\r\nimmediately followed by a marked increase in the number of deaths\r\nfrom such diseases, thus conclusively demonstrating the fact that we\r\nwere right in ascribing the previous reduction in deaths to a better\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nThis annual saving of lives is an important result, but more important\r\nyet is the fact that when Asiatic cholera reappears in the Mariquina\r\nvalley, as it inevitably will sooner or later, we shall not live in\r\nconstant fear of a general infection of the Manila water supply,\r\nwhich, judging from the experience of other cities where modern\r\nsanitary methods have been introduced, might result in the death of\r\na third of the population. In every country a very considerable part\r\nof the population always fails to boil its drinking water, no matter\r\nhow great the resulting danger may be.\r\n\r\nManila lacked any facilities for the proper disposal of human waste,\r\nand the conditions which resulted were unspeakable, especially in\r\nthe little _barrios_, or groups of houses, placed close together,\r\nhelter-skelter, on wet, swampy ground and reached by means of runways\r\nnot worthy even of the name of alleys, as one often had to crouch to\r\npass along them.\r\n\r\nA modern sewer system costing $2,000,000, supplemented by a pail\r\nsystem, has very effectively solved this problem, while thousands of\r\nhomes closely crowded on disease-infected, mosquito-breeding ground\r\nhave been removed to high, dry, sanitary sites. The regions thus\r\nvacated have in many instances been drained, filled, provided with\r\ncity water and good streets, and made fit for human occupancy.\r\n\r\nThe old moat around the city walls was a veritable incubator of\r\ndisease. It has been converted into an athletic field where crowds\r\nof people take healthful exercise. The _esteros_, or tidal creeks,\r\nreeked with filth. More than twenty miles of such creeks have been\r\ncleaned out, although much still remains to be done to put them in\r\nreally satisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nThere were no regulations covering the construction of buildings, and\r\nit was not unusual to find six or eight persons sleeping in a closed\r\nand unventilated room 10 × 8 × 8 feet. Manila now has an excellent\r\nsanitary code, and such conditions have been made unlawful.\r\n\r\nThe previous woeful lack of hospital facilities has been effectively\r\nremedied. At a cost of approximately a million and quarter pesos we\r\nhave built and equipped the great Philippine General Hospital, one of\r\nthe most modern institutions of its kind in the world, and by far the\r\nbest in the Far East. In it we have very satisfactorily solved the\r\nquestion of getting sufficient light and air in the tropics without\r\ngetting excessive heat. Its buildings are certainly among the very\r\ncoolest in the city of Manila, and \"the hospital smell\" is everywhere\r\nconspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nIt is called a three-hundred-bed institution, but as a matter of fact\r\nthe ventilation is so admirable that nearly two hundred additional\r\nbeds can safely be put in as an emergency measure.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and twenty of its beds are free. In them a very large\r\nnumber of persons are annually given the best of medical and surgical\r\ncare. At its free clinic some eighty thousand patients find relief\r\nin the course of a year.\r\n\r\nThe increase in private hospital facilities has also been\r\nnoteworthy. Among the new institutions doing admirable work should be\r\nmentioned the University Hospital, an Episcopal institution; the Mary\r\nJ. Johnston Hospital, a Methodist institution; and St. Paul's Hospital,\r\na Catholic institution. Patients are admitted to all of them without\r\nregard to their religious belief, a policy the liberality of which\r\nmust commend itself to all broadminded persons.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the hospitals of Manila, the old Spanish institution,\r\nSan Juan de Dios, should not be forgotten, for it has been improved\r\nand modernized until it offers good facilities for the treatment of\r\nthe sick and the injured.\r\n\r\nAll of the above mentioned institutions are in effect acute-case\r\nhospitals designed for the treatment of curable ailments. Cases\r\nof dangerous communicable disease are excluded from them, but are\r\nadequately provided for at San Lazaro where the insular government\r\nhas established modern and adequate hospitals for plague, smallpox,\r\ncholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, etc., as well as a\r\ndetention hospital for lepers, pending their departure for Culion.\r\n\r\nAn insane hospital capable of comfortably accommodating 300 inmates\r\nhas also been provided. A few years since the insane were commonly\r\nchained to floors, or tied to stakes under houses or in yards,\r\nand were not infrequently burned alive during conflagrations. Such\r\nconditions no longer exist, but the government is not yet able to\r\nprovide for nearly all of the insane who need institutional care.\r\n\r\nThe several institutions above mentioned have a very important\r\nfunction apart from the relief of human suffering, in that they afford\r\nunexcelled opportunities for giving practical instruction in nursing\r\nand in the practice of medicine and surgery.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was not such a thing as a Filipina trained\r\nnurse in the islands. I was firmly convinced that the Filipinas of\r\nthis country could learn to be good nurses, and made earnest efforts\r\nto have included among the first students sent at government expense\r\nto the United States several young women of good family who should\r\nattend nurses' training schools and then return to assist in our\r\nhospital work.\r\n\r\nI failed to secure the adoption of this plan, but later the training\r\nof nurses was inaugurated in connection with hospital work at the\r\nold Civil Hospital, St. Paul's, the University Hospital, the Mary\r\nJ. Johnston Hospital and the Philippine General Hospital. At the latter\r\ninstitution there is now conducted an admirable school where more than\r\ntwo hundred young men and women are being trained. Three classes have\r\nalready graduated from it, and Filipina nurses have long since proved\r\nthemselves to be exceptionally efficient, capable and faithful. It\r\nwill be some time before we can educate as many as are needed in the\r\ngovernment hospitals, and after that has been accomplished a vast\r\nfield opens before others in the provincial towns, where the need of\r\ntrained assistants in caring for the sick is very great.\r\n\r\nWe found exceedingly few competent Filipino physicians or surgeons\r\nin the islands. This condition was due not to natural incompetence\r\non the part of the Filipinos but to the previous lack of adequate\r\neducational facilities. The government has established a thoroughly\r\nmodern college of medicine and surgery, well housed, and provided\r\nwith all necessary laboratory facilities. It furnishes the best of\r\ntheoretical instruction, while its students have every opportunity\r\nfor practical work at the bedsides of patients in the government\r\nhospitals, all patients in free beds being admitted subject to the\r\ncondition that they will allow their cases to be studied.\r\n\r\nWhile there is still an evident tendency on the part of graduates of\r\nthis school to feel that they know enough, and to desire to get to\r\nmaking money without delay, we are nevertheless managing to attract an\r\nincreasingly large number of the more competent to the intern service\r\nof the Philippine General Hospital, where as the result of additional\r\nyears of practical experience they become exceptionally proficient.\r\n\r\nThis institution, with its great free clinic, offers very exceptional\r\nfacilities for practical instruction, and we have already trained\r\nsome extremely competent Filipino physicians and surgeons.\r\n\r\nAs funds permit, hospital work is being extended to the provinces. At\r\nCebú a thoroughly up-to-date sixty-bed institution is now open. A\r\nsmaller one was established years ago at Baguio, where surgical work\r\nmay be performed with great advantage on account of the rapidity with\r\nwhich convalescence occurs in the cool, pure mountain air, which also\r\nexpedites the recovery of persons recuperating from wasting diseases.\r\n\r\nA little more than a year ago a hospital was opened at Bontoc, the\r\ndemand for accommodations being so great from the start that we did\r\nnot even await the arrival of beds. Sick Igorots were only too glad\r\nto lie on the floor if their needs could be ministered to.\r\n\r\nIt had previously been the custom of the wild men to kill chickens,\r\npigs or carabaos in case of illness, in order to propitiate evil\r\nspirits, the kind and number of animals killed being of course\r\ndetermined by the wealth of the patients. They have now satisfied\r\nthemselves that quinine for malaria, salvarsan for yaws, and other\r\neffective remedies for common ailments are more useful and more\r\nreadily obtained than was the helpful intervention of the _anítos,_\r\nor spirits of the dead, while the methods and results of modern\r\nsurgery are a source of unending amazement and satisfaction to them.\r\n\r\nThe first surgeon to anesthetize a Kalinga became promptly and widely\r\nknown as \"the man who kills people and brings them to life again,\"\r\nand the individual on whom he operated successfully, who chanced to\r\nbe the most influential chief of the tribe, became his friend for\r\nlife. Indeed, the results of medical and surgical work for the wild\r\nmen have been an important factor in bringing about and maintaining\r\nfriendly relations with them.\r\n\r\nTheir gratitude is at times very touching. At Atok, in Benguet, there\r\nlives an Igorot chief named Palasi. When he was already old a son was\r\nborn to him. This boy, who was the delight of his declining years,\r\nbecame deathly ill with confluent smallpox, and the Igorots considered\r\nhim as good as dead. At this time Sanitary Inspector Baron appeared\r\non the scene. He promptly turned every one else out of the house and\r\nhimself nursed the boy, saving his life. Palasi wished to pay him\r\nfor his services, but was informed by Mr. Baron that the government\r\npaid him, and he could not accept additional compensation. Palasi\r\npromptly made the long journey to Baguio to ascertain whether Baron\r\nhad told him the truth, and was informed by Governor Pack that this\r\nwas the case. The old man retired to Atok, quite disgusted with the\r\nstrange ways of Americans.\r\n\r\nSix months later he again appeared at Baguio to ask the governor about\r\na _fiesta_ which he had just heard it was customary to celebrate\r\non the 25th of December. He had been told that Americans were in\r\nthe habit of giving presents to each other at this time, and asked\r\nif this was the ease. Governor Pack said yes. Palasi then inquired\r\nif the feast was a _good_ feast, and the custom a _good_ custom,\r\nand was assured that both of these things were true. He next asked\r\nif it would be a good feast for Igorots as well as for Americans,\r\nand receiving an affirmative reply from the unsuspecting governor,\r\ntriumphantly declared that he was going to give Baron his best\r\nhorse. Under the circumstances the governor allowed him to do so.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Bontoc Hospital we use two men, one of whom\r\ntravels from settlement to settlement, relieving minor ailments on\r\nthe spot and sending to the hospital only those patients who need\r\nto go there, while the other stays at home and receives them. From\r\ntime to time these two doctors \"change works.\" Pages from their daily\r\njournals, written in the field, often read like romance.\r\n\r\nWere I a young man, and possessed of adequate knowledge of medicine\r\nand surgery, I would ask nothing better than to minister to the wants\r\nof these people. One might not, and indeed would not, acquire great\r\nwealth, but he would be rich in friends. Here lies a great field for\r\npractical missionary work.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the health work there have been many occurrences\r\nwhich were both amusing and sad. At one time there was great excitement\r\nover a sacred spring which had appeared in Manila Bay off the district\r\nof Tondo. It was duly blessed by Aglipay, the head of the so-called\r\nAglipayano church. Coincidently with its discovery there was a sharp\r\nlittle outbreak of Asiatic cholera. Investigation revealed the fact\r\nthat the \"spring\" had its origin in a broken sewer pipe. We were\r\nobliged to prevent the faithful from further partaking of its waters,\r\nand thus insuring themselves a speedy trip to the better world.\r\n\r\nAt one time cases of cholera appeared scattered generally throughout\r\nthe Mariquina valley and without apparent connection. For some days we\r\nwere unable to make a guess as to their origin. Then we heard that a\r\n\"Queen\" had arisen at the town of Taytay near the Laguna de Bay. An\r\ninvestigation of the Queen and her activities resulted in rather\r\nastonishing revelations. She was a very ordinary looking Tagálog girl\r\nwho had secured the body of an old bull-cart, stopped the cracks with\r\nclay, partially filled it with water and decaying vegetable matter,\r\nand at rather frequent intervals had bathed in the fermenting mass\r\nthus concocted. In due time she announced herself a healer of all\r\nthe ills to which flesh is heir, and the sick flocked to her. Cholera\r\nwas then prevalent in some of the towns near Taytay, and there were\r\npersons suffering from it among those seeking relief. Some of them\r\nwere directed to wash their hands in the extemporized tank, while\r\nothers bathed their bodies in it. As a result it soon contained a\r\ncholera culture of unprecedented richness. This was given to patients\r\napplying for treatment, and was bottled and sent to those who were\r\ntoo ill to come in person. Hence numerous scattering cases of cholera\r\nwhich did not bear any relationship to other known cases.\r\n\r\nIt proved quite an undertaking to put the Queen of Taytay out of\r\nbusiness. We first asked the local authorities to have her sent to\r\nManila, but the presidente and the police declined to act. We then\r\napplied for a warrant to the Filipino judge of the court of first\r\ninstance having jurisdiction over Taytay, but that worthy official\r\nfound it convenient to be suddenly called out of the province. At\r\nlast we prevailed upon soldiers of the Philippine constabulary to\r\narrest the queen and bring her to Manila.\r\n\r\nWe had anticipated that she might prove insane, but she showed herself\r\nto be a very keen-witted young woman. We employed her at the San Lazaro\r\nHospital to look after cholera patients. The people of Taytay were\r\nnot satisfied, and a few days later a large delegation of them came\r\nto Manila and demanded the Queen. I was at my wits' end to know what\r\nto do, but old Spanish law can usually be relied upon in emergencies,\r\nand the attorney-general discovered a provision couched in very general\r\nterms, which provided against disobedience to the authorities. It was\r\nonly necessary for an \"authority\" to have read to an ordinary person a\r\nstatement setting forth what that person must not do; then if the order\r\nwas violated, such person could be made to suffer pains and penalties.\r\n\r\nI accordingly prepared a most impressive order prohibiting the Queen\r\nof Taytay from further engaging in the practice of medicine, had her\r\nfollowers drawn up in battalion formation, placed myself at the front\r\nand centre, caused the Queen to be brought before me, and read her my\r\ncommunication, at the same time charging the good people of Taytay\r\nnot to tempt her again to try her hand at healing, for the reason\r\nthat if they did she would surely get into serious trouble. They\r\nmarched away with the Queen and I have not heard of her since.\r\n\r\nHardly a year goes by that some similar miraculous healer does not\r\nset up in business, and the supply of dupes seems to be unending.\r\n\r\nWhile it is comparatively easy to combat disease in a place like\r\nManila, what of the provinces, where in many cases there is not one\r\nphysician to two hundred thousand inhabitants?\r\n\r\nTo meet this difficulty we have an organization of district and\r\nmunicipal health officers. A district may include a single province\r\nor several provinces. A district health officer is invariably a\r\nphysician who has had reasonably thorough practical training in the\r\nwork of public sanitation, usually at Manila.\r\n\r\nHe is supposed to spend his time in sanitary work rather than in\r\ntreating sick individuals, but it is, of course, impossible for him\r\nalways to refuse to treat such persons, and we encourage gratuitous\r\nwork for the poor when it can be carried on without interfering too\r\nseriously with more important duties.\r\n\r\nPresidents of municipal boards of health may exercise jurisdiction over\r\na single municipality or over several. They are supposed to maintain\r\ngood sanitary conditions in their respective towns, under the general\r\nsupervision of district health officers, and to instruct their people\r\nin sanitary methods and their results, as well as to devote a certain\r\namount of their time to the relief of the suffering poor.\r\n\r\nOn the whole it must be admitted that while this system has\r\naccomplished much, it has fallen far short of accomplishing what\r\nit should.\r\n\r\nMen like Dr. Arlington Pond of Cebú have wrought marvels, and have\r\nconclusively demonstrated the fact that it is not the system that\r\nis at fault. Of our thirteen district health officers, ten are\r\nFilipinos. They are, with few exceptions, letter-perfect. They know\r\nwhat they ought to do, but as a rule lack the initiative and the\r\ncourage to do it.\r\n\r\nRecently after discovering exceptionally bad sanitary conditions in\r\nseveral towns of the province of Misamis, I demanded an explanation\r\nof the district health officer, an exceptionally well-educated and\r\nintelligent Filipino physician. I found, as I had anticipated, that\r\nthe sanitary regulations of his towns left little to be desired,\r\nbut that they were absolutely ignored.\r\n\r\nI asked him what sense there was in paying his salary if he failed\r\nto remedy such conditions as I had discovered. He replied that if he\r\nwere really going to compel people to clean up, it would be necessary\r\nto begin with the provincial governor, whose premises were in a bad\r\nstate. When I suggested that in my opinion the provincial governor\r\nwould be the best possible man to begin with, the doctor evidently\r\nthought me crazy!\r\n\r\nIt is as yet impossible for the average intelligent Filipino to\r\nunderstand that the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak,\r\nshould be treated alike.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a province asks for an American health officer,\r\nor a Filipino demands the services of an American physician. My\r\ninvariable procedure in such cases has been to request that the\r\napplication be made in writing. For some mysterious reason the\r\npetitioners are seldom willing to go on record.\r\n\r\nA short time since we had a strong demand from Iloilo for an American\r\ndistrict health officer. I made the usual suggestion and got a written\r\nrequest that there be sent to Iloilo a district health officer \"after\r\nthe style of the district health officer of Cebú.\" If Dr. Pond's\r\nnationality may be considered a part of his style, then this was a\r\nrequest for an American, otherwise not!\r\n\r\nWith rather shocking frequency, Filipinos who must be examined for\r\nleprosy or some other dangerous communicable disease strongly insist\r\nthat the examination be made by an American bacteriologist rather\r\nthan by one of their own countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn connection with recent election troubles two men were wrongfully\r\ndenounced as lepers. In several instances perfectly sound people\r\nhave been thrust among lepers who were being taken on board steamer\r\nfor transfer to Culion. This grievous wrong was committed by their\r\nenemies under cover of darkness, and in the confusion which attends\r\nthe embarking of a number of people in a heavy sea. The reason why\r\nthe services of Americans are often specially requested for diagnostic\r\nwork is not far to seek!\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that our greatest success in establishing\r\nsatisfactory provincial sanitary conditions has been achieved in\r\ncertain of the \"special government provinces,\" where the people are\r\nunder the very direct control of American officials.\r\n\r\nThere is not a regularly organized province in the Philippines in\r\nwhich the towns are as clean as are those of Mindoro, where, until\r\nrecently, we have never had a resident district health officer.\r\n\r\nI believe that nowhere in the tropics can there be found native\r\ntowns which are cleaner or more healthful than are those of Bukidnon,\r\ninhabited in some instances by people who have literally been brought\r\ndown out of the tree-tops within the last two or three years. We have\r\nnever had a resident health officer in this subprovince.\r\n\r\nI mention these facts not as an argument against health officers, but\r\nas a proof of what can be done without them by intelligent Americans\r\nvested with proper authority.\r\n\r\nIt has given me especial pleasure to see the fundamental change which\r\nhas come about in public sentiment relative to medical, surgical\r\nand sanitary work. At the outset sanitary inspectors and vaccinators\r\ncarried on their work at serious risk of personal violence. Indeed,\r\nseveral of them were killed. Incredible tales were believed by the\r\npopulace, with the result that cholera victims sometimes had to be\r\ntaken to the hospital by force. In later years it has been by no\r\nmeans unusual for them to come in voluntarily and request treatment.\r\n\r\nGeneral hospitals were in the old days regarded as places where people\r\nso unfortunate as to have no homes to die in might go to end their\r\ndays. It was almost impossible to get any other class of persons\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\nNow we constantly turn away deserving patients from the Philippine\r\nGeneral Hospital because of lack of room. The common people are\r\nflocking to it in rapidly increasing numbers. We even have \"repeaters,\"\r\nand persons who drop in just to get a comfortable bed and a bath while\r\nwaiting for an examination which will inevitably show that there is\r\nnothing wrong with them.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties were increased at the outset by the fact that many\r\nforeign medical men working in the Far East good-naturedly ridiculed\r\nour efforts to better conditions, claiming that in tropical colonies it\r\nwas customary to take only such steps as would safeguard the health of\r\nEuropean residents, and that it was really best to let the masses live\r\nas they would, since orientals were incapable of sanitary reform, and\r\nthe attempt to bring it about involved a waste of effort that might\r\nbe more profitably directed elsewhere. Furthermore these men were,\r\nin their several countries, practising what they preached.\r\n\r\nIt has been very interesting to note the reaction of American methods\r\nupon those previously in vogue in neighbouring colonies. At first\r\nour efforts to make Asiatics clean up, and to eliminate diseases\r\nlike leprosy, cholera and plague, were viewed with mild amusement,\r\nnot unmixed with contempt; but the results which we obtained soon\r\naroused lively interest.\r\n\r\nForeign governments began to send representatives to the annual\r\nmeetings of the \"Philippine Island Medical Association,\" [505] in\r\norder to learn more of our methods. From these small beginnings sprang\r\n\"The Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine,\" the biennial\r\nmeetings of which bring together the most experienced, skilful and\r\nwidely known physicians and sanitarians in the East for an interchange\r\nof views and experiences which is invaluable, and greatly facilitates\r\nconcerted action between the various governments concerned in dealing\r\nwith what may be termed \"international health problems.\"\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of this Association was held at Manila, the second\r\nat Hongkong. The third will take place at Saigon.\r\n\r\nThe results of a rigid enforcement of the \"Pure Food and Drugs Act\"\r\nare worthy of more than passing notice. Such enforcement has been\r\ncomparatively easy as the officials concerned are not hampered\r\nby politics. The Philippines were at one time a dumping-ground for\r\nproducts that could not be sold elsewhere, but it is now possible for\r\nFilipinos to obtain wholesome preserved foods and unadulterated drugs,\r\nexcept in very remote places where none of any sort are available.\r\n\r\nThe cost of our medical and sanitary work has been comparatively\r\nsmall. The per capita rate of taxation here is lower than in any\r\nother civilized country. What we have done has been accomplished\r\nwithout spending vast sums of money or resorting to military measures.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained are very largely due to the faithfulness\r\nand efficiency of Dr. Victor G. Heiser, who was chief quarantine\r\nofficer of the Philippines when he succeeded Major E. C. Carter as\r\ncommissioner of public health on April 5, 1905, and was later made\r\ndirector of health when the original board of health was abolished\r\nas an administrative entity. He has continued to hold the office of\r\nchief quarantine officer, and thus has been in complete executive\r\ncontrol of the health situation for eight years.\r\n\r\nThrough good report and ill, mostly ill, he has given unsparingly of\r\nhis time, his skill and his wisdom, always treating the government\r\nmoney as if it were his own.\r\n\r\nHis tenure of office has been long enough to enable him to inaugurate\r\nand carry out policies, and thus get results.\r\n\r\nSeldom, if ever, have health officials been more viciously and\r\npersistently attacked than have Dr. Heiser and myself. The assaults\r\non us have been the direct result of a firm stand for a new sanitary\r\norder of things, established in the interest of the whole body of\r\ninhabitants of these islands, civilized and uncivilized. We both\r\nwelcome the profound change in public sentiment, which has slowly\r\nbut surely come about as a result of practical accomplishment.\r\n\r\nMany very grave health problems still confront the insular\r\nadministration. Of these the most serious are the eradication of\r\ntuberculosis and the reduction of the very high infant mortality rate.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that about one Filipino in five suffers from\r\ntuberculosis in some form during his life and the work we have thus\r\nfar accomplished in many fields must be considered as in a way a\r\nclearing of the decks for action against this, the greatest enemy of\r\nall. However, the Philippines do not differ essentially from other\r\ncivilized countries, in all of which tuberculosis is a very serious\r\nfactor in the death rate.\r\n\r\nAs regards infant mortality the situation is different. More than\r\nfifty per cent of the babes die before completing their first year of\r\nlife. The causes which lead to this appalling result have been made\r\nthe subject of careful investigation which still continues. Popular\r\ninterest has been aroused, but it is undoubtedly true that many\r\nyears of patient work will be necessary before anything approaching\r\nsatisfactory results can be brought about.\r\n\r\nThe physical condition of the average Filipino is undoubtedly\r\nbad. Of one hundred seventy-eight university students recently\r\nexamined sixty-nine were found to be suffering from serious\r\norganic troubles. Unquestionably the great mass of the people are\r\nunderfed. This is largely due to the poor quality of the rice which\r\nthey consume, and to the fact that rice forms too large a part of\r\ntheir diet. I am firmly convinced that much of the so-called laziness\r\nof the Filipinos is the direct result of physical weakness due to\r\nimproper and insufficient food.\r\n\r\nSince the American occupation a large amount of time has been\r\nsuccessfully devoted to the working out of a good all-around diet made\r\nup of local products the cost of which comes within the means of the\r\npoor. The next thing will be to get them to adopt it, and there comes\r\nthe rub. Incalculable good would result, if we could only persuade the\r\npeople of these islands to sleep with their windows open. Thousands\r\nupon thousands of infant lives would be saved annually, if mothers\r\ncould be persuaded not to give solid food to their little ones during\r\nthe early months of their existence.\r\n\r\nIn the educational campaign which we have thus far conducted with some\r\nconsiderable degree of success, two agencies have proved invaluable,\r\nnamely the Catholic Church and the public schools. Again and again I\r\nhave begged Apostolic Delegate Monsignor Agius and Archbishop Harty to\r\nbring to bear the influence of the Church in favour of simple sanitary\r\nregulations, the general adoption of which was imperatively necessary\r\nin combating some epidemic of disease. They have invariably given me\r\ninvaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nThrough the public schools we reach more than half a million children,\r\nand they take the information which we convey to them home to\r\ntheir parents. Simple rules for the prevention of cholera have been\r\nuniversally taught in the schools. When the use of English has become\r\ngeneralized the difficulty now encountered in reaching the common\r\npeople will largely disappear. The truth is that they are singularly\r\ntractable and docile when their reason can be effectively appealed\r\nto. The readiness with which they have submitted to the rigorous\r\nmeasures necessary for the elimination of leprosy is a lasting honour\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nWould the sanitary campaign so vitally important to the people of\r\nthe Philippines be effectively continued if American authority were\r\nwithdrawn at this time? With regret I must answer this question\r\nemphatically in the negative. We have succeeded in training a few\r\ngood physicians and surgeons. We have thus far failed to train\r\nreally efficient sanitary officers. What is lacking is not so much\r\nknowledge as to what should be done as initiative and courage to do\r\nit. Until this condition changes radically for the better, Filipinos\r\ncannot safely be intrusted with the sanitary regeneration of their\r\ncountry. Under American control the population of the islands is\r\nsteadily and rapidly increasing. It is my firm conviction that if\r\nFilipinos were at this time placed in control of the health work,\r\nthe population would steadily and rapidly decrease.\r\n\r\nThe present attitude of the Filipino press toward sanitary work is\r\nboth interesting and important. I quote the following editorial from\r\nthe March 27, 1913, issue of _El Ideal_, a paper generally believed\r\nto be controlled by Speaker Osmeña:--\r\n\r\n    \"Some persons, who, because of being ignorant of many\r\n    things, do not sympathize with the Filipino people, who are\r\n    in the habit of frequently throwing up to them the violent\r\n    opposition of our masses to strict sanitary measures in cases\r\n    of epidemics, and the lively protests which are provoked\r\n    here on some occasions by other provisions tending to end\r\n    some public calamity, thinking they see in this disposition\r\n    of mind an indication of our incapacity to govern ourselves....\r\n\r\n    \"To be more expressive, we shall say that the sanitary agents\r\n    and veterinarians of the government, swollen with power and\r\n    overly zealous of their prestige, quickly become, when an\r\n    occasion like those cited by us presents itself, cunning czars,\r\n    whose sphere of influence is in direct ratio to the peaceful\r\n    character and ignorance of the people intrusted to their\r\n    care, and whose excesses and abuses recognize no limits but\r\n    the natural ones established by the greater or lesser honour\r\n    of those public servants, their greater or lesser cynicism,\r\n    and their greater or lesser degree of temerity.\r\n\r\n    \"This, and nothing else, is the logical and natural explanation\r\n    of the hostility of our people toward those measures of good\r\n    government which are sincerely esteemed for what they are\r\n    worth, but for which they have veritable terror because of\r\n    the nameless abuses to which they give rise.\r\n\r\n    \"These comments are of palpitating current interest at this\r\n    moment, when reports are made almost daily to the press and\r\n    the proper authorities of misbehaviour and excesses befitting\r\n    soulless people who live without the law committed by persons\r\n    who should be examples of prudence, honesty and good manners,\r\n    for it is in this concept that the people are compelled to\r\n    furnish them their daily bread.\"\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be regretted that the public press of the islands\r\nhas not yet become sufficiently enlightened to join in the great\r\nsanitary campaign which has already relieved an enormous amount of\r\nhuman suffering and has greatly increased the expectancy of life of\r\nthe people of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Assembly has repeatedly passed acts providing for the\r\ncreation of a sort of sanitary council of numerous members authorized\r\nto pass on public health measures proposed by the director of health\r\nand instructed to disapprove them if not in accordance with the\r\nbeliefs and customs of the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nIn protecting the public health in the Philippine Islands emergencies\r\nconstantly arise which must be instantly and effectively met. It would\r\nbe as logical to place a commanding general directing a battle under\r\nthe control of an advisory board as it would thus to tie the hands of\r\nthe director of health, and it is difficult to see how any competent\r\nand self-respecting sanitarian could be willing to continue to hold\r\nthis position if so hampered.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Commission has heretofore invariably tabled the\r\nacts designed to accomplish this end, but that body has now been\r\n\"Filipinized\" and its future attitude on this very important\r\nquestion is therefore in doubt. Hardly had the legislative session\r\nopened in October, 1913, when the assembly again passed the same\r\nold bill. Should it become a law, there will be occasion to watch,\r\nwith especial interest, the death rate of Manila and that of the\r\narchipelago as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBaguio and the Benguet Road\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, 1892, when sitting in a native house on a hill overlooking\r\nNaujan Lake in Mindoro, and anxiously awaiting the boats which were\r\nto make it possible for my party to return to the coast, I saw a\r\nsmall flotilla approaching.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise and regret I found that it was not coming for us, but\r\nbrought a number of Spanish officers who had heard that we had some\r\nmysterious procedure for killing the tamarau, an extraordinarily wild\r\nand vicious little buffalo peculiar to this island. They had come to\r\nget us to tell them how we did it, if possible, and if not to watch\r\nus and find out for themselves.\r\n\r\nWe described to them our method, which was easily understood. It\r\nconsisted in picking up a likely trail along some water course,\r\nfollowing it until the tamarau was overtaken, and then shooting\r\nhim. This looked suspiciously simple to our Spanish friends before they\r\nhad tried it, and they shook their heads. After trying it they became\r\nconvinced that more than a few days of experience would be necessary\r\nbefore satisfactory results could be obtained. They profited little\r\nby the best information we could give them, and by the services of\r\nthe expert tracker whom we loaned to them. Meanwhile I obtained from\r\none of them, Señor Domingo Sanchez, information destined to become\r\nof great importance in the development of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nSeñor Sanchez, who was an employee of the Spanish forestry bureau,\r\ntold me that in the highlands of Northern Luzón at an elevation\r\nof about five thousand feet, there was a region of pines and oaks\r\nblessed with a perpetually temperate climate and even with occasional\r\nfrosts. I confess that I did not believe all of his statements. I\r\nwas then experienced in climbing Philippine mountains, and at five\r\nthousand feet had invariably found a hopeless tangle of the rankest\r\ntropical vegetation, with humidity so high that trees were draped with\r\nferns, orchids, and thick moss, and dripping with moisture. However,\r\nI knew that the mere presence of pine and oak trees would mean the\r\noccurrence of special bird species feeding upon their seeds, and so\r\ndetermined to investigate.\r\n\r\nA severe attack of typhoid fever necessitated my leaving the islands\r\nbefore I could carry out this plan, but upon my return with the first\r\nPhilippine Commission in 1899 I remembered Señor Sanchez's story. In\r\nview of the probability that American occupation would continue\r\nfor a long period, the existence or non-existence near Manila of an\r\nextensive highland region with a temperate climate became a question\r\nof great practical importance. I therefore caused search to be made\r\nin the Spanish archives to see what, if any, reliable information was\r\navailable, and to my great satisfaction unearthed a detailed report\r\nmade by a committee of three distinguished and competent Spanish\r\nofficers who had spent some weeks at Baguio in the _comandancia_ of\r\nBenguet, during which period they had made six temperature observations\r\ndaily, had tramped over the neighbouring country very thoroughly,\r\nhad located a number of springs of potable water and determined their\r\napproximate flow, and in short had gathered a large series of very\r\nvaluable data which more than bore out the statements of Señor Sanchez.\r\n\r\nI found, furthermore, that Spanish engineers had made a survey for\r\na carriage road into this country, and had prepared a profile of it\r\nwith estimates of the amount and cost of the necessary excavation\r\nand other work.\r\n\r\nWhile in Washington during the winter of 1899-1900, I brought\r\nthis matter to the attention of Secretary Root. Just as the second\r\nPhilippine Commission was filing out of his office, after receiving\r\nits instructions, he called out to us directing that we look into\r\nthat Benguet matter, and if the facts proved to be as stated open up\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nMindful of these instructions the commission delegated General Luke\r\nE. Wright and myself to visit Benguet and familiarize ourselves with\r\nconditions by investigation on the ground. General MacArthur was\r\ndubious when we expressed a desire to carry out the instructions of\r\nthe secretary of war. He told us that the country was very dangerous,\r\ndoubtless confusing it with Bangued, the capital of Abra, near which\r\nthere was at that time a strong and active Insurgent force.\r\n\r\nWe insisted on going, so he said that he would send a troop of\r\ncavalry with us, and he kept his word. During the last week of July\r\nwe finally sailed from Manila on a naval vessel for San Fernando in\r\nthe province of Union. From this place we expected to go by road as\r\nfar as Naguilian, in the same province, and thence on horseback to\r\nTrinidad and Baguio, in Benguet.\r\n\r\nIn order to expedite investigations as much as possible we took\r\nwith us Mr. Horace L. Higgins, president of the Manila and Dagupan\r\nRailway Company, who was an engineer of experience, to report on\r\nthe practicability of constructing a railway to Baguio. We also took\r\nMajor L. M. Maus, of the army medical corps, and Dr. Frank S. Bourns,\r\nwho then held the volunteer rank of major in the same corps, to report\r\non the possibilities of the place as a health resort. Two young naval\r\nofficers went along just for the trip.\r\n\r\nMajor Maus accompanied us only because requested to do so. Taking\r\nthe latitude and altitude as a basis for his calculations, he had\r\nalready determined with a lead pencil and piece of paper just what\r\nthe climate of Baguio must be, and had demonstrated to his own\r\ncomplete satisfaction that the statements of the members of the\r\nSpanish committee above referred to were necessarily false.\r\n\r\nHis first rude shock came when we were met at San Fernando by a young\r\naide to Colonel [506] Duval, who was in command of the local garrison\r\nat that place. This lieutenant told us that some negro soldiers were\r\nstationed at Trinidad and were being kept supplied by an army pack\r\ntrain. I asked him how they were getting on. He said very well,\r\nexcept that they could not keep warm. They had called for all the\r\nspare blankets available, but still complained of the cold!\r\n\r\nThe trail proved to be in execrable condition. No repair work had been\r\ndone on it since 1896, and its constant use during the then-existing\r\nrainy season by a pack train had completed its destruction. Much of\r\nthe way it was a mere V in the earth, with deep mud at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWe left Naguilian early in the morning and stopped for lunch at\r\na little place properly called Sablán, but unofficially known as\r\n\"The Bells.\" Aguinaldo had thought at one time of establishing his\r\nheadquarters in Benguet and had planned to have a gun foundry at\r\nSablán. His troops accordingly stole most of the church bells in\r\nthe neighbouring lowland towns, meaning to use them for gun metal,\r\nand compelled the unfortunate Benguet Igorots to carry them up the\r\nsteep trail. Boiler pipes, which had been used in lieu of carrying\r\npoles, had in several instances been badly bent out of shape. There\r\nwas even an old vertical boiler which had been lugged up entire for\r\nsome unknown reason.\r\n\r\nThe labour involved must have been enormous, and we were assured\r\nthat when the Igorot bearers, prostrated with fatigue, had refused\r\nto continue their titanic task without rest, they had been driven\r\nto it at the muzzles of Insurgent rifles, and that some of them had\r\nbeen shot as a lesson to the others. At all events, the boiler and\r\nthe bells were there, and there the boiler and the larger bells have\r\nremained ever since!\r\n\r\nIt was still steaming hot at Sablán, and the whole countryside\r\nwas buried in the densest tropical vegetation. Major Maus was\r\ntriumphant. Things were working out just as he had predicted. However,\r\nas we were already halfway up, we thought that we might as well\r\ncontinue the journey. I had expected to find pines and oaks, but\r\nhad anticipated that they would grow amidst a dense tangle of damp\r\ntropical vegetation.\r\n\r\nWe were all literally dumfounded when within the space of a hundred\r\nyards we suddenly left the tropics behind us and came out into a\r\nwonderful region of pine parks. Trees stood on the rounded knolls at\r\ncomparatively wide intervals, and there were scores of places where,\r\nin order to have a beautiful house lot, one needed only to construct\r\ndriveways and go to work with a lawn-mower. At the same moment,\r\na delightful cold breeze swept down from the heights above us.\r\n\r\nJust at sunset we experienced a second surprise, coming out on the\r\nknife-sharp crest of a ridge, and seeing spread before us the Trinidad\r\nValley, which is shaped like a huge wash-basin. Its floor was vividly\r\ngreen with growing rice, Igorot houses were dotted here and there over\r\nits surface, and the whole peaceful, beautiful scene was illuminated\r\nby the rays of the setting sun. The air had been washed clean by\r\nthe heavy rain which had poured down on us throughout the afternoon,\r\nand the sight was one never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nJust at dusk we reached the little settlement of Trinidad, which had\r\nbeen the capital of the Spanish _comandancia_ of Benguet, finding\r\nthat its inhabitants were in part Ilocanos and in part Igorots.\r\n\r\nHere we were hospitably entertained by the officers of the military\r\npost. It was so cold that one's breath showed. Major Maus improved\r\nthe opportunity to indulge in a severe chill. Finding him buried\r\nunder blankets, we asked his views as to the Benguet climate. They\r\nwere radical! It is only fair to the Major to say that the report\r\nwhich he ultimately made set forth the facts fully and fairly. It\r\ndid not suit General MacArthur. Years afterward, when discussing the\r\nclimate of Benguet with Surgeon-General Sternberg, I referred to this\r\nreport and found to my amazement that he had never seen it. He caused\r\nan investigation to be made, and it was at last resurrected from a\r\ndusty pigeonhole.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Trinidad we received a letter from Mr. Otto Scheerer,\r\nthe one white resident of Benguet, inviting us to make our headquarters\r\nat his house when we visited Baguio. Bright and early the next morning\r\nMr. Scheerer himself appeared on the scene and guided us to his home,\r\nwhere he entertained us most hospitably during our entire stay. The\r\ntrip from Trinidad, a distance of four miles, was made over a wretched\r\npony trail.\r\n\r\nWe found conditions exactly as described in the Spanish report. The\r\ncountry was gently rolling, its elevation ranging from forty-five\r\nhundred to fifty-two hundred feet. The hills were covered with short,\r\nthick grass, and with magnificent pine trees, which for the most\r\npart grew at considerable distance from each other, while along the\r\nstreams there were wonderful tree ferns and luxuriant tangles of\r\nbeautiful tropical vegetation. It took us but a short time to decide\r\nthat here was an ideal site for a future city, if water could be\r\nfound in sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nWe revisited each of the several springs discovered and described\r\nby the Spanish committee, but decided that they would be inadequate\r\nto supply a town of any great size. Mr. Scheerer now came to the\r\nfront and guided us to the very thing that we were looking for,\r\nbut had hardly dared hope to find; namely, a magnificent spring of\r\ncrystal-clear water. At that time it was flowing nearly a million\r\ngallons per day. It burst forth from a hillside in such a manner as\r\nto make its protection from surface drainage easy, and we decided\r\nthat there was nothing lacking to make Baguio an admirable site for\r\nthe future summer capital and health resort of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that the construction of a highway from San Fernando,\r\nin Union, to Baguio would involve considerable expense, and we asked\r\nMr. Scheerer about other possible lines of communication. A study\r\nof the Spanish maps had led us to consider two: one up the valley of\r\nthe Agno River, and the other up that of the Bued River. The latter\r\nroute had the great advantage of affording direct communication with\r\nthe end of the railway line at Dagupan.\r\n\r\nMr. Scheerer took us to a point which commanded a view for some\r\ndistance down the Bued River valley, and conditions looked rather\r\nfavourable. Mr. Higgins undertook to make a trip down this valley to\r\nthe plains of Pangasinán, reporting to us on his arrival at Manila,\r\nso we returned to that place and awaited advices from him. He was\r\nfurnished with a guard of soldiers from Trinidad, and attempted to\r\ngo down the river bed, but encountered unexpected difficulties, and\r\nhis progress was finally checked by a box cañon from which he escaped\r\nwith difficulty, spending a night without food or water on a chilly\r\nmountain top known as \"Thumb Peak.\" The following morning he managed\r\nto cross to a high mountain called Santo Tomás, whence he returned\r\nto Baguio. He was, however, of the opinion that the trip down the\r\ncañon could be made without special difficulty by a party suitably\r\nprovided with food and tentage.\r\n\r\nConvinced by our report that active measures should be taken to\r\nestablish communication with this wonderful region, the commission,\r\non September 12, 1900, appropriated $5000 Mexican, \"for the purpose\r\nof making a survey to ascertain the most advantageous route for\r\na railway into the mountains of Benguet, Island of Luzon, and the\r\nprobable cost thereof.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles W. Meade, then serving as city engineer of Manila,\r\nwas selected to make the survey. There was every theoretical reason to\r\nbelieve him competent, and we did not question either his integrity\r\nor his ability. After being absent from Manila for some time, he\r\nreported in favour of the Bued River valley route, saying that it\r\nwas entirely feasible to build a railway along it.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that, as the construction of a wagon road would be\r\nnecessary in building the railroad, we might as well undertake that\r\nfirst, and so be able to go to Baguio in wheeled vehicles before the\r\nrailroad was completed. He asked for $75,000 United States currency,\r\nwith which to build this road, stating that he expected to be able\r\nto do it for $65,000, but would like $10,000 as a margin of safety.\r\n\r\nOn December 21, 1901, the commission passed an act authorizing the\r\nconstruction of a highway from Pozorubio, in Pangasinán, to Baguio,\r\n\"the same to be built under the general supervision of the military\r\ngovernor and the immediate direction of Captain Charles W. Meade,\r\nThirty-sixth Infantry, United States Volunteers, who has been detailed\r\nby the military governor for that purpose, along the general line\r\nof survey recently made by Captain Meade for a railway between said\r\ntowns.\" The $75,000 asked for were appropriated by this act.\r\n\r\nWork began promptly at both ends of the line. In June, 1901,\r\nI set out on my first trip through the wild man's territory in\r\nnorthern Luzón. Incidentally, and for my personal satisfaction only,\r\nI inspected the work on the road. We had been rather disappointed by\r\nCaptain Meade's failure to make more rapid progress. At the lower end\r\nI found that delay was being caused by a huge cliff necessitating a\r\nvery heavy rock cut. I was assured by Captain Meade that from this\r\npoint on the line ran through dirt most of the way, so that the road\r\ncould be completed very rapidly. This statement proved to be grossly\r\nin error. It took years of hard work to open up the road.\r\n\r\nIts cost when finally ready for traffic was $1,961,847.05. Its length\r\nwas forty-five kilometers eight hundred ninety-one meters, [507] of\r\nwhich thirty-four kilometers were in non-Christian territory. Some\r\nten kilometers of the remainder have since been incorporated in the\r\nfirst-class road system of the province of Pangasinán, as this part\r\nis chiefly used by the people of that province in shipping their\r\nagricultural products to Benguet, and in maintaining communication\r\nbetween their towns.\r\n\r\nThe additional cost of the road to date [508] since it was first\r\nopened is $792,434, making its total cost to date $2,754,281.05. This\r\nincludes not only the actual cost of maintenance, but very extensive\r\nimprovements, such as the metalling of the road from the so-called\r\nzigzag to Baguio, the construction of five steel bridges, and the\r\nreplacing of all the original bridges on the road and of all the\r\noriginal culverts except those made of concrete or masonry.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in Benguet in 1901, I found that good progress had been\r\nmade on the upper end of the road, which had penetrated for a short\r\ndistance into the cañon proper without encountering any considerable\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 1901, the commission stated in its annual report to the\r\nsecretary of war, \"He [509] has been much delayed by the difficulty of\r\nprocuring the labour necessary for its early completion, and several\r\nmonths will yet elapse before it is finished!\" They did!\r\n\r\nOn August 20, 1901, Captain Meade was relieved, and Mr. N. M. Holmes\r\nwas made engineer of the road.\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 1902, a little sanitarium was opened in a small native\r\nhouse at Baguio. During the following July I was sent to it as a\r\npatient, and while in Benguet again inspected the road which had been\r\ncontinued high up on the cañon wall to a point where, on a very steep\r\nmountain side, a peculiar rock formation had been encountered at the\r\nvery grass roots. This rock disintegrated rapidly under the action\r\nof the sun when exposed to it. Comparatively solid in the morning,\r\nit would crack to pieces and slide down the mountain side before\r\nnight. A sixty-foot cut had already been made into the precipitous\r\nmountain side, and the result was an unstable road-bed, hardly four\r\nfeet in width, which threatened to go out at any moment.\r\n\r\nMy trip to Baguio promptly relieved a severe attack of acute intestinal\r\ntrouble from which I had been suffering, and when Governor Taft fell\r\nill the following year with a similar ailment, and his physicians\r\nrecommended his return to the United States, I did my best to persuade\r\nhim to try Baguio instead. He decided to do so.\r\n\r\nFive rough cottages had meanwhile been constructed for the use of\r\nthe commissioners, the lumber for them being sawed by hand on the\r\nground. Boards had been nailed to frames as rapidly as they fell\r\nfrom the logs, and had shrunk to such an extent that a reasonably\r\nexpert marksman might almost have thrown a cat by the tail through\r\nany one of the houses. At night they looked like the old-fashioned\r\nperforated tin lanterns, leaking light in a thousand places. These\r\nwere the luxurious homes provided for the high officials of the\r\ngovernment of which so much has been said!\r\n\r\nWe paid for them an annual rental amounting to ten per cent of their\r\ncost, which had of course been excessively high on account of the\r\nnecessity of packing everything used in them, except the lumber,\r\nup the Naguilian trail.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were in no frame of mind to be critical. We had put in\r\nthree years of killing hard work, labouring seven days in the week,\r\nand keeping hours such as to arouse a feeling little short of horror\r\namong old British and other foreign residents. We were all completely\r\nexhausted, and Mr. Taft was ill. For my part, I would gladly have paid\r\nalmost any sum for a tent under the pine trees and the privilege of\r\noccupying it for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nOn the trip up Mr. Taft had ridden a magnificent saddle horse which\r\nhad been given to him by General Chaffee. At the time he left, Manila\r\nhad been burning hot. When he was at last seated on the porch of the\r\nlittle house which was to be his home for weeks, with a cool breeze\r\nsighing through the needles of a spreading pine tree close at hand,\r\nhis satisfaction knew no bounds. Already his magnificent constitution\r\nhad begun to respond to the stimulation of the wonderful mountain air,\r\nand filled with enthusiasm he summoned a stenographer and dictated\r\nthe following cablegram to the secretary of war:--\r\n\r\n    \"April 15, 1903.\r\n\r\n    \"_Secwar_,\r\n\r\n    \"_Washington_.\r\n\r\n    \"Stood trip well, rode horseback 25 miles to 5000 feet\r\n    altitude. Hope amoebic dysentery cured. Great province this,\r\n    only 150 miles from Manila with air as bracing as Adirondacks\r\n    or Murray Bay. Only pines and grass lands. Temperature this\r\n    hottest month in the Philippines in my cottage porch at three\r\n    in the afternoon 68. Fires are necessary night and morning.\r\n\r\n    \"_Taft_.\"\r\n\r\nAs quick as the wires could bring it, he received the following reply:\r\n\r\n    \"_Washington_, D.C., April 16, 1903.\r\n\r\n    \"_Taft_,\r\n\r\n    \"_Manila_.\r\n\r\n    \"Referring to telegram from your office of 15th inst., how\r\n    is horse?\r\n\r\n    \"_Root_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he read it his shouts of laughter, rolling over the hills of\r\nBaguio, must have been audible half a mile away!\r\n\r\nMr. Taft's sojourn in the hills put him again in fine condition and\r\nmade it possible for him to return to Manila and resume the heavy\r\nburden of work which there awaited him. The other members of the\r\ncommission also greatly benefited by their stay in the hills.\r\n\r\nWhile there we heard disquieting rumours as to the practicability\r\nof completing the road. There was a difference of opinion between\r\nthe engineer in charge and one of his immediate subordinates as to\r\nthe route which should be followed. The consulting engineer of the\r\ncommission was accordingly requested to make a survey to determine a\r\npracticable route for the unfinished portion of the road and estimate\r\nthe cost of completing it. In due time he advised us that it was\r\npracticable to complete it, but that the cost would be at least\r\n$1,000,000. Warned by our experience with Meade, we wished additional\r\nexpert advice, so summoned to Baguio Colonel L. W. V. Kennon, a man\r\nof great energy and executive ability, who had had large experience\r\nin engineering work in mountainous country, and requested him to go\r\ndown the Bued River valley and report on the progress of the work,\r\nand the practicability of completing the road on the route which had\r\nbeen determined upon.\r\n\r\nBeing the youngest and most active member of the commission, I was\r\ndetailed to accompany him. On this trip I became convinced that\r\nall of the engineers interested, except the consulting engineer,\r\nhad grossly understated the difficulties which must be overcome\r\nbefore the road could be completed. Colonel Kennon decided that it\r\nwas entirely feasible to build the road, but that the comparatively\r\nshort stretch already completed from Baguio into the upper end of\r\nthe cañon must be abandoned and a new line adopted. Furthermore,\r\nhe gave us some very definite and extremely unpleasant information\r\nas to the probable cost of completing the work, his statements on\r\nthis subject confirming those of the consulting engineer.\r\n\r\nThe commission was thus put face to face with the hard facts but did\r\nnot flinch. On the contrary, it passed the following resolution on\r\nJune 1, 1903:--\r\n\r\n    \"On Motion, _Resolved_, That it be declared the policy of\r\n    the Commission to make the town of Baguio, in the Province of\r\n    Benguet, the summer capital of the Archipelago and to construct\r\n    suitable buildings, to secure suitable transportation,\r\n    to secure proper water supply, and to make residence in\r\n    Baguio possible for all of the officers and employees of\r\n    the Insular Government for four months during the year, that\r\n    in pursuance of this purpose the Secretary of the Interior,\r\n    the Consulting Engineer to the Commission, the Chief of the\r\n    Bureau of Architecture, and Major [510] L. W. V. Kennon, United\r\n    States Army, whom it is the intention of the Commission to\r\n    put in actual charge of the improvements in Benguet Province,\r\n    including the construction of the Benguet Road, the erection\r\n    of the buildings and the construction of a wagon road from\r\n    Naguilian, be appointed a Committee to report plans and\r\n    estimates to the Commission for the proposed improvements in\r\n    the Province of Benguet and to submit same to the Commission\r\n    for action and necessary appropriation, and\r\n\r\n    \"_Be it further resolved_, That steps should be immediately\r\n    taken looking to the increase of the capacity of the Sanitarium\r\n    by at least twenty rooms, to the construction of seven more\r\n    cottages on the grounds of the Sanitarium, to the construction\r\n    of a Governor's residence on the site overlooking the big\r\n    spring which is the source of the Bued River immediately\r\n    south of the Sanitarium proper, to the construction of an\r\n    Administration building sufficient for the Commission, the\r\n    Commission's staff and the Executive Bureau, of at least\r\n    twenty-five rooms, and to the making of a plan for a town\r\n    site for the municipality of Baguio; but that the details\r\n    of construction and improvements, with such variations from\r\n    the indicated plan as may seem wise, shall be left to the\r\n    committee appointed under the previous resolution.\"\r\n\r\nIn his annual report dated November 15, 1903, Governor Taft said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In connection with the subject of health, reference should be\r\n    made to the province of Benguet and to Baguio, the capital of\r\n    that province. The secretary of commerce and police will refer\r\n    to the work now being done in the construction of the Benguet\r\n    road from Pozorrubio, through Twin Peaks, to Baguio. There\r\n    have been serious engineering mistakes made in the road,\r\n    and it is proving to be much more costly than was expected;\r\n    but when completed its importance in the development of\r\n    these islands can hardly be overestimated. One of the things\r\n    essential to progress in the islands is the coming of more\r\n    Americans and Europeans who shall make this their business\r\n    home. If there can be brought within twelve hours' travel\r\n    of Manila a place with a climate not unlike that of the\r\n    Adirondacks, or of Wyoming in summer, it will add greatly\r\n    to the possibility of living in Manila for ten months of the\r\n    year without risk. It will take away the necessity for long\r\n    vacations spent in America; will reduce the number who go\r\n    invalided home, and will be a saving to the insular government\r\n    of many thousands of dollars a year. It will lengthen the\r\n    period during which the American soldiers who are stationed\r\n    here may remain without injury to their health and will thus\r\n    reduce largely the expense of transportation of troops between\r\n    the islands and the United States. More than this, Filipinos\r\n    of the wealthier class frequently visit Japan or China for\r\n    the purpose of recuperating. People of this class are much\r\n    interested in the establishment of Baguio as a summer capital,\r\n    and when the road is completed a town will spring up, made up\r\n    of comfortable residences, of a fine, extensive army post,\r\n    and sanitariums for the relief of persons suffering from\r\n    diseases prevalent in the lowlands. It is the hope of the\r\n    government that the Roman Catholic Church will send American\r\n    priests as it has sent American bishops to the islands, to\r\n    assist in the moral elevation of the people. The fear of the\r\n    effect of the climate has kept many from coming. The Roman\r\n    Catholic Church authorities have announced their intention\r\n    of erecting rest houses at Baguio for the purpose of the\r\n    recuperation of their ministers and agents. The Methodists and\r\n    Episcopalians have already secured building lots in Baguio for\r\n    this purpose. It is the settled purpose of the Commission to\r\n    see this improvement through, no matter what the cost, because\r\n    eventually the expenditures must redound to the benefit of the\r\n    government and people of the islands. We have already stated,\r\n    in the report on the public land act, that it is proposed,\r\n    under that act, which allows the organizing of town sites,\r\n    to sell the public land in suitable lots at auction so that\r\n    every one interested shall have the opportunity to obtain a\r\n    good lot upon which to build a suitable house.\" [511]\r\n\r\nMr. Taft would be delighted could he see to-day how completely his\r\nanticipations have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nColonel Kennon was put in charge of construction work, and things began\r\nto move. They kept moving until the road was finished. From this time\r\non we knew that the expense involved would be out of all proportion\r\nto the original estimate, but we were determined to push the work\r\nthrough, having reached the decision that it was worth while to open\r\nup communication with Baguio at any cost within reason, because of its\r\nfuture certain value to the people of the islands as a health resort.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1904, I rode over the road in a vehicle nearly to Camp\r\nFour, and came the rest of the way to Baguio on horseback over a new\r\ntrail which zigzagged up a mountain side near Camp Four and followed\r\nthe crest of the range from there in. A little later the Commission\r\ncame by the same route, and spent the hot season in the cool Benguet\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1905, Colonel Kennon drove into Baguio in the first\r\nwagon to arrive there over the Benguet Road, which was opened for\r\nregular service on March 27th of the same year. The cost of the road\r\non November 1, 1905, had, as previously stated, been $1,966,847.05,\r\nand the cost of the heavy work in the cañon had been approximately\r\n$75,000 per mile, which is not excessive when compared with the cost\r\nof similar work in the United States, especially as this sum included\r\nmaintenance of the portions constructed during previous years.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a certain amount of congressional relief funds was\r\nexpended on the construction of this road has been made the subject\r\nof very unjust criticism. A large number of poor Filipinos, who were\r\nin dire straits, were thus given an opportunity for remunerative\r\nemployment, and the distribution of a portion of the congressional\r\nrelief fund in this way was in entire harmony with the fixed policy\r\nof the commission to avoid pauperizing the people by giving money\r\nor food outright to able-bodied persons, and to afford them relief\r\nby furnishing them opportunity to work for a good wage. A further\r\nreason why the expenditure of money from this fund on the Benguet\r\nRoad was appropriate is found in the fact that the region opened up\r\nis destined to play a very important part in the cure of tuberculosis,\r\nwhich is the principal cause of death among the people of the lowlands,\r\nbut is practically unknown among the Igorots of the hills.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years after the road was open owners of bull carts\r\nin Pangasinán made large sums transporting freight over it. This is\r\nnot the case at the present time, as the growing volume of freight\r\nrequiring to be moved led to the blocking of the road with bull carts\r\nand necessitated the installation of an automobile truck line so that\r\nit might be more expeditiously handled.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1904, the great landscape architect, Mr. D. H. Burnham,\r\nvisited Baguio, and made a plan for its future development. He was\r\nenthusiastic over its possibilities, and gave his services free of\r\ncharge. His plan is being closely adhered to, and although funds are\r\nnot now available for going far toward carrying it out, we have at\r\nleast avoided anything which would interfere with it.\r\n\r\nThe next important event in the history of Baguio was the first sale\r\nof residence and building lots, which took place on May 28, 1906,\r\nand was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Public\r\nLand Act relative to town sites.\r\n\r\nAlthough a howling typhoon was sweeping Benguet at the time, 91\r\nresidence lots and 15 business lots were disposed of at this first\r\nsale, and at a subsequent one held in Manila a few weeks later all\r\nthe remaining lots then surveyed were sold.\r\n\r\nThe town site includes two hundred sixteen square miles, and new lots\r\nare surveyed as required. All sums derived from the sale of lots are\r\nused for the improvement of the town site, and thus Baguio is made\r\nto help build itself.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1900 the Baguio Country Club was organized. Because\r\nof the extraordinary false statements made concerning it by certain\r\nunscrupulous politicians, I give its history somewhat fully. Its\r\npurpose was to afford a meeting place for the people of the town\r\nand to give them an opportunity for outdoor sports. It purchased a\r\nhundred acres of land on which a low assessment had been placed in\r\nview of the semipublic purpose which it was to serve.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the \"club house\" was a rude, grass-roofed shed made of\r\npine slabs. Its doors and windows were mere openings which could not be\r\nclosed. It was erected in about a week. Three holes of a golf course\r\nand a croquet ground had been prepared. These decidedly primitive\r\nclub facilities nevertheless served to bring the people of Baguio\r\ntogether and give them an opportunity for a good time out of doors.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1907, a Country Club Corporation was organized\r\nwith a capital stock of $5000, of which $3000 have thus far been\r\nsubscribed. The shares cost $50. No single subscriber owns more than\r\nthree, with the sole exception of Mr. Forbes, who took ten to help\r\nthe club get started. Ownership of stock brings no emoluments, but,\r\non the contrary, indirectly involves expense which the present owners\r\nhave been willing to bear for the public good.\r\n\r\nFrom these small beginnings the Baguio country club has grown into\r\nan important institution. As funds became available from the sale\r\nof stock, the payment of dues and tile generous donations of a\r\nfew members, an excellent nine-hole golf course was completed, and\r\ntennis courts and facilities for trap-shooting were installed. In\r\nMarch and April, 1908, a modest club house was built at a cost of\r\nsome $5000. It has two small locker rooms, a large living room,\r\na tiny office, a little bath, a kitchen, and nine single sleeping\r\nrooms. Three very small cottages, costing $375 each, were erected\r\non the club grounds for the use of the members. Five larger cottages\r\nhave since been constructed.\r\n\r\nAny person of good character is eligible to membership. The entrance\r\nfee is $25, but officers of the army, navy and marine corps stationed\r\nat Baguio are admitted without the payment of this fee, and persons\r\ntemporarily there may secure the privileges of the club by paying at\r\nthe rate of $5 per month. The annual dues are $20. The families of\r\nmembers are entitled to the privileges of the club. Among its members\r\nare the highest officials of the insular government and teachers,\r\nclerks, stenographers and other employees drawing small salaries,\r\nas well as numerous permanent residents of Baguio.\r\n\r\nIt knows no race or creed, and Filipinos take advantage of its\r\nprivileges quite as freely as do Americans. Representatives of\r\nevery nationality in the islands may be found on its golf course on\r\na pleasant afternoon. It is the common meeting place of Baguio, and\r\nhardly a day passes without the giving of some pleasant luncheon or\r\ndinner in its little living room or in the outdoor space covered by\r\nan overhanging roof at its eastern end. No more democratic institution\r\never existed.\r\n\r\nCongressman Jones, in his attacks on the Philippine administration, is\r\nfond of stating that \"there is a club for officials at Baguio.\" The\r\nstatement is true, but reminds one of that other statement of a\r\nship's first mate who came on board intoxicated just before the vessel\r\nsailed. The following morning, happening to look at the ship's log for\r\nthe previous day, he saw the entry \"The mate drunk to-day.\" It was his\r\nfirst offence, and he begged the captain to erase this record, but the\r\ncaptain said \"It is true, is it not?\" and insisted that it must stand.\r\n\r\nA little later the captain was taken ill. Upon resumption of duty he\r\nfound an entry in the log reading: \"The captain sober to-day.\" When\r\nhe furiously insisted that it be erased, the mate said \"It is true, is\r\nit not?\" Now, it is true that there is a club for government officers\r\nat Baguio, but in making this statement Mr. Jones and his ilk have\r\nneglected to say that there is also at Baguio a club for employees; a\r\nclub for private citizens; a club for Americans; a club for Filipinos;\r\na club for foreign consuls and other foreign residents of the islands;\r\na club for business men; a club for clerks; and that all of these\r\ninstitutions are one and the same, namely, the Baguio Country Club,\r\nwhich is now strictly self-supporting and meets its obligations from\r\nthe funds derived from the dues of its members. These dues are absurdly\r\nlow in view of the privileges which it affords.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Forbes does not like to have it known, I cannot refrain\r\nfrom stating that the club has not always been self-supporting, and\r\nthat he has repeatedly made up deficits from his private funds. The\r\ncost involved in getting the golf course into shape was out of all\r\nproportion to the resources of the organization. Sufficient funds\r\nwere not available to pay for the club house and cottages when they\r\nwere constructed, and had it not been for the generosity of Mr. Forbes\r\nthe club would not exist to-day in anything like its present form.\r\n\r\nThe polo field at Baguio has been referred to as another evidence of\r\nextravagant governmental expenditure. It is true enough that it was\r\nin the first instance an expensive luxury, as an immense amount of\r\nearthwork had to be done in order to make a level piece of ground of\r\nsufficient size. The field is administered by the Country Club, and is\r\nopen to the use of the public for any form of amusement which will not\r\ninterfere with its use for polo. The detractors of the government have\r\nneglected to mention that the cost of its construction and maintenance\r\nhave been met from the private funds of Mr. Forbes.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the story of the growth of Baguio, the next\r\nstep forward was the construction of an official residence for the\r\ngovernor-general, for which $15,000 were appropriated. Mr. Forbes had\r\nnot the slightest personal interest in this appropriation. When it\r\nwas made he had no knowledge of the fact that he was later to become\r\ngovernor-general, and his private Baguio residence was decidedly more\r\ncomfortable and commodious than this official one. His subsequent\r\noccupancy of the latter building involved a real personal sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 a modern hospital and the governor-general's residence were\r\ncompleted. No other government official is furnished a free house. All\r\nhave to rent government cottages or stay at hotels, unless they choose\r\nto build for themselves. The policy of giving the governor-general\r\nan official residence in Baguio is in accord with that which gives\r\nhim one at Manila.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1908, there was opened a \"Teachers' Camp,\" to which came\r\nAmerican school teachers from all over the islands. They were housed\r\nin a hundred and fifty tents, which were set up under the shade of the\r\npine trees. Larger tents served as kitchen, dining room, storehouse\r\nand recitation rooms, while a structure of bamboo and nipa palm,\r\nerected at a total cost of $150, was utilized for general assembly\r\npurposes. Four talented lecturers were employed to instruct and\r\nentertain the teachers. At one time there were a hundred and ninety\r\npersons in the camp.\r\n\r\nThe credit for initiating this very important move is due chiefly to\r\nWilliam F. Pack, at that time governor of the province of Benguet, who\r\nstrongly advocated bringing the teachers to Baguio, and did everything\r\nin his power to make the first assembly the great success which it was.\r\n\r\nIt has now become a fixed institution, and has accomplished\r\nuntold good. Americans who spend too many years in out-of-the-way\r\nmunicipalities of the Philippines without coming in contact with their\r\nkind are apt to lose their sense of perspective, and there is danger\r\nthat they will grow careless, or even slovenly, in their habits. It\r\nis of the utmost benefit for school teachers to get together once a\r\nyear, learn of each other's failures and successes, and profit by each\r\nother's experiences, forget their troubles while engaging in healthful\r\nathletic sports, listen to inspiring and instructive discourses,\r\nand above all else benefit by open-air life in a temperate region.\r\n\r\nThe Teachers' Camp is now a beautiful and attractive place. A fine\r\nsystem of walks and drives make every part of it readily accessible. It\r\nhas an excellent athletic field. The teachers live in tents, but\r\ngood permanent buildings have been provided in which are located the\r\nmess, a social hall, recitation rooms, etc., and several comfortable\r\ncottages have been constructed for the use of visiting lecturers\r\nand others. An outdoor amphitheatre which seats a thousand persons\r\nhas been built at small expense by taking advantage of peculiarly\r\nfavorable natural conditions. Filipino teachers share the pleasures\r\nand benefits of the camp with their American associates, and the\r\n\"assembly\" certainly does great good.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot season of 1908 the Bureau of Lands transferred a number\r\nof its employees to Baguio, quartering them in tents. This was done\r\nin order to ascertain the practical effect of sending American and\r\nFilipino employees to this mountain resort. The conclusion was reached\r\nthat the small additional expense involved was more than justified\r\nby the larger quantity and higher quality of the work performed as a\r\nresult of the greatly improved physical condition of the workers. Every\r\nFilipino sent to Baguio gained in weight, with the single exception\r\nof a messenger who had to run his legs off! Other bureaus subsequently\r\nfollowed the example of the Bureau of Lands, with similar results.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1909 season, the railroad having reached Camp One, five\r\nlarge Stanley steam automobiles were operated by the government in\r\ntransporting passengers from this place to Baguio, and more than two\r\nthousand persons were thus moved over the road.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the unexpectedly heavy expense involved in completing the\r\nroad had been made the subject of severe criticism by the public press\r\nof Manila. Most of the critics were entirely honest, having no idea\r\nof the character of the country opened up, or of the importance of\r\nmaking it readily accessible.\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the commission should have crowded its programme\r\nthrough to conclusion, it faltered. The only government construction\r\nwork performed at the summer capital that year, in addition to what\r\nhas been mentioned, was the erection of a small office building and of\r\na barrack building for labourers, the enlarging of five government\r\ncottages, the addition of out-buildings, and the enlarging of a\r\nbuilding which served as a combination sanatorium and hotel.\r\n\r\nThis policy of inaction was a mistaken one. It made the Benguet Road\r\nseem like the city avenue which ran into a street, the street into\r\na lane, the lane into a cow path, the cow path into a squirrel track\r\nand the squirrel track up a tree, for while one could get to Baguio,\r\nthere was very little there after one arrived. The accommodations\r\nat the sanatorium were strictly limited, and there was some apparent\r\njustification for the charge freely made that the Philippine Commission\r\nhad voted to spend very large sums of money to open up a health resort\r\nfrom which only its members and its staff derived benefit.\r\n\r\nThe government had at the outset been obliged to construct its\r\nbuildings on a piece of private land purchased from Mr. Otto Scheerer,\r\nas prior to the passage of the Public Land Act and its approval by the\r\nPresident and Congress, building on public land was impossible. Now,\r\nhowever, a town site had been surveyed, and plans for the future\r\ndevelopment of Baguio had been made by one of the world's most\r\ncompetent experts. The time had arrived for action. Mr. Forbes, then\r\nsecretary of commerce and police, argued vigorously for the carrying\r\nout of the original plan of the commission by the construction of\r\nadequate public buildings. To help the development of the place,\r\nhe purchased two adjacent building lots and on the tract of land so\r\nsecured built a handsome and expensive home, where he subsequently\r\nentertained not only his personal friends, but guests of the\r\ngovernment, as well as various persons who had no other claim on him\r\nthan the fact that they were officers or employees of the government\r\nwho were in need of a change of climate and could ill afford to seek it\r\nat their own expense. Among his house guests were General Aguinaldo,\r\nSpeaker Osmeña and many other Filipinos. It was Mr. Forbes's idea,\r\nand mine as well, that members of the commission ought to set the\r\nexample by building at Baguio. I followed his example to the extent\r\nof buying a lot and constructing on it a simple and inexpensive house,\r\nthus obtaining the first and only home that I have ever owned.\r\n\r\nUltimately Mr. Forbes formulated a plan for the construction of a group\r\nof government buildings, a mess hall and a large number of small and\r\ninexpensive cottages for rental to government officers and employees\r\nso that the executive offices of the government might be transferred\r\nto Baguio during the heated term and it might become the true summer\r\ncapital of the Philippines. This plan was adopted in substance, and\r\nit was decided to transfer the bureaus of the government to Baguio\r\nfor the coming hot season, so far as practicable.\r\n\r\nFunds were appropriated for the carrying out of Mr. Forbes's plan,\r\nbut before the construction work had fairly begun there occurred,\r\non October 17, 1909, a destructive typhoon. Eighteen inches of rain\r\nfell in nine hours, and twenty-six inches in twenty-four hours. The\r\nBued River quickly rose fifty feet, carrying away trees and rocks\r\nwhich obstructed its course, and seriously injuring the road for\r\nmiles. Four of the largest bridges were swept away and the work of\r\nconstructing government buildings, which was just about to begin,\r\nwas greatly retarded. It was not thought possible to transfer the\r\nbureaus of the government to Baguio for the coming hot season as\r\nplanned. Indeed, there were not lacking those who insisted that no\r\none would be able to get there. Mr. Haubé, the energetic and capable\r\nyoung engineer in charge, had the road open on the twentieth day of\r\nDecember, and the projected buildings ready for occupancy in February,\r\na noteworthy and highly creditable achievement.\r\n\r\nIt was then thought that the storm which had done such serious damage\r\nto the road was of unprecedented violence, but there was worse to\r\ncome. On July 14 and 15, 1911, a terrific typhoon swept across northern\r\nLuzón, bringing down one of the world's record rainfalls. Between\r\nnoon of the 14th and noon of the 15th, forty-five and ninety-nine\r\nhundredths inches of rain fell at Baguio. A mountain forming a part\r\nof the wall of the Bued cañon split from the top and the detached\r\nportion toppled over into the river, damming it to a depth of about\r\na hundred and fifty feet at a time when it was carrying an enormous\r\nvolume of water. When this dam burst, an avalanche of earth and rock,\r\nswept onward by a huge wave, rushed down the cañon, leaving complete\r\ndestruction in its wake. Every bridge in its course was carried away,\r\nand the road was left in such condition that it would have cost\r\n$300,000 to open it for traffic. Then Providence, having apparently\r\ndone its worst, relented and sent another typhoon which washed away\r\nmost of the débris left by the first one, uncovering the road-bed\r\nand making it possible to reopen communication for $50,000.\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintaining the Benguet Road has proved\r\nexcessive. Mountains tower above it on both sides to a height of four\r\nto seven thousand feet and the drainage basin which finds its outlet\r\ndown the narrow gorge through which the road runs is enormous. Even\r\nso, under ordinary climatic conditions its maintenance does not offer\r\nvery exceptional difficulties, as much of it is blasted out of rock;\r\nbut during extraordinarily heavy storms the danger of destruction by\r\noverwhelming floods is great.\r\n\r\nWhile a century may pass before there is another storm like the one\r\nwhich brought down the terrific slide above described, there may be\r\none at any time, and when the railroad has once reached Baguio, it is\r\nhardly probable that such extensive repairs as were necessary after the\r\nlast destructive typhoon will ever again be made, especially as the\r\nhorse trail built on a carriage road grade from Baguio to Naguilian\r\nin the lowlands has been widened little by little, until it is now\r\nsafe for small automobiles. The maintenance of the bridges alone,\r\non the Benguet Road, is a very formidable item, while there is only\r\none short bridge on the Naguilian Road before the province of Union\r\nis reached. As it runs on or near the crests of ridges all the way,\r\nthere are no extensive watersheds above it, and it is not liable\r\nto serious injury during the most violent storms. The total cost\r\nof the Benguet portion of this road to date [512] has been only\r\n$33,405. This stretch is seventeen and a half miles in length and\r\ndoes not include that portion of the road which lies within the city\r\nof Baguio. The total distance from the centre of Baguio to Bauang,\r\nthe nearest railroad station on the coast, is thirty-four miles.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of the new government buildings and the transfer\r\nof the several bureaus to Baguio for the season of 1910 a real boom\r\nbegan. The old sanatorium building had long been leased to a private\r\nindividual who used it for hotel purposes, adding to it from time to\r\ntime. A second hotel had been built. The railroad had been extended\r\nto Camp One and a regular automobile service established for the\r\nconvenience of the public between Camp One and Baguio. The Jesuits\r\nhad constructed a great rest house and meteorological observatory on\r\na commanding hill. The Dominicans had purchased a neighbouring hill\r\ntop and prepared to erect thereon a very large reënforced concrete\r\nbuilding to serve for college purposes and as a rest house for members\r\nof the order who required a change of climate.\r\n\r\nDevelopment began early at Camp John Hay, an extensive and beautiful\r\nmilitary reservation set aside within the Baguio town site. Some\r\nprogress had been made in this direction prior to the coming of\r\nMajor-General Leonard Wood. That highly efficient and far-seeing\r\nofficer gave a tremendous impetus to the work. He had been something\r\nof a sceptic on the subject of Baguio before visiting the place, but,\r\nlike all other responsible persons who take the trouble to see it,\r\npromptly became an enthusiast when he had an opportunity to observe\r\nconditions for himself. Many army officers and their families who\r\ncould not obtain accommodations in the limited number of buildings\r\non the reservation were glad to take tents for the season, and the\r\nCamp promptly began to serve useful ends. It has steadily grown\r\nand developed ever since, and is now a well-organized army post. Its\r\nremarkable progress has been due in large measure to the initiative and\r\ningenuity of Captain M. R. Hilgard, who has been its commander since\r\nOctober, 1905. Great progress has been made in erecting buildings,\r\nbut they are still far short of the needs of the service. At the\r\npresent writing [513] there are many tents in use by officers and\r\ntheir families. These serve very well during the dry months, but with\r\nthe oncoming of the heavy showers, which usher in the rainy season,\r\nbecome damp and uncomfortable and make it necessary for the occupants\r\nto return to the lowlands just at the time when Baguio is growing\r\nmost attractive and the heat of Manila is becoming most oppressive.\r\n\r\nThe ground set aside in the military reservation is adequate for a\r\nbrigade post, and such a post should be established as soon as the\r\nrailroad reaches Baguio. The different commands in the islands could\r\nthen be ordered there in succession, and officers and men given the\r\nbenefits of one of the best climates in the world.\r\n\r\nBaguio has continued steadily to develop, and the Benguet Road\r\nno longer ends by running up a tree. The government has not only\r\nerected a residence for the governor-general, but has established\r\noffices for the chief executive, the secretaries of departments,\r\nthe Philippine Commission, the Executive Bureau, and the Bureaus of\r\nAgriculture, Civil Service, Education, Forestry, Health, Public Works\r\nand Constabulary. There are also a hospital, a series of tuberculosis\r\ncottages for the treatment of patients from the lowlands, cottages\r\nand dormitories for government officers and employees, a great mess\r\nhall where meals may be had at moderate cost, an automobile station,\r\na garage, storehouses, a pumping plant, and labourers' quarters. At\r\nthe Teachers' Camp there are a separate mess hall, an assembly hall\r\nand a fine athletic field.\r\n\r\nThe city of Baguio has a city hall, a storehouse, a corral and market\r\nbuildings. Lot owners who have built summer homes for themselves have\r\nbrought up friends to show them what Baguio was like. Curiously it has\r\nnever seemed possible to convey any adequate idea of its attractions\r\nand advantages by word of mouth. Again and again I have urged sceptics\r\nto come and see for themselves. When after the lapse of years they\r\nfinally did so, they have invariably asked me why I had not told them\r\nabout it before, forgetting that I had exhausted my vocabulary without\r\nbeing able to make them understand. Practically without exception,\r\nthe persons who actually visit Baguio become \"boosters.\"\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate in a way that the boom did not come quicker, for\r\nthe hard truth is that up to date the rapidity of the growth of the\r\nsummer capital has been determined absolutely by the local lumber\r\nsupply. The original Filipino hand-sawyers were ultimately replaced\r\nby small portable mills, and these in turn by large modern mills\r\nto which logs are brought by skidding engines or overhead cables,\r\nyet it is true to-day, as it has always been true, that no sawmill\r\nhas ever been able to furnish dry lumber, for the simple reason that\r\nthe green output is purchased as fast as it can be sawed.\r\n\r\nFor a time the lumbermen took advantage of the necessities of the\r\npublic, but when timber on the government concessions first granted\r\nthem had been exhausted and they applied for new cutting areas,\r\nmy turn came. I fixed maximum prices on lumber which they might not\r\nexceed without forfeiting their concessions. I also fixed a minimum\r\nannual cut which they were compelled to make, and imposed a regulation\r\nproviding that at least half of the total cut should be offered for\r\nsale to the public.\r\n\r\nThere is no justification for the claim that Baguio is a rich\r\nman's city. The town site is very large and can be indefinitely\r\nextended. Good lots may be had at extremely moderate prices, and the\r\ncost of houses is strictly a matter of individual means and taste. A\r\nlarge section is given up to small dwellings for Filipinos. The\r\nman who earns his living with a bull cart has no more difficulty\r\nin establishing a home there than does the Filipino millionnaire,\r\nand rich and poor are building in constantly increasing numbers.\r\n\r\nWhile experience has taught me that I cannot convey by words alone\r\nany adequate conception of what Baguio is like, I must nevertheless\r\nhere make the attempt.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one miles of well surfaced roads wind among its pine-covered\r\nhills and afford beautiful glimpses of the luxuriant vegetation\r\nalong its numerous small streams. There are building sites to suit\r\nall tastes, and each house owner is convinced that his particular\r\nlocation is better than that of any one else. One spring supplies\r\nexceptionally pure water sufficient for the needs of at least ten\r\nthousand people, and an abundant additional supply can be obtained\r\nwhen needed. The scenery is everywhere beautiful, and in many sections\r\ntruly magnificent.\r\n\r\nGently rolling hills enclose valleys with sides sometimes steep and\r\nprecipitous and sometimes gently sloping. The country is watered by\r\nnumerous streams bordered by magnificent tree-ferns, and by trees,\r\nshrubs, and plants requiring a large amount of water, while the dry\r\nhillsides bear noble pines standing at wide intervals and often\r\narranged as if grouped by a skilled landscape artist. During the\r\nrainy season they are covered with ferns and orchids, while exquisite\r\nwhite lilies, larger than Easter lilies, dot the hillsides. The dense\r\n_cógon_ of the Philippine lowlands is absent. Bamboo grass or _runo_\r\noccurs sparingly in the immediate vicinity of streams and springs, but\r\nthe hills are covered with a short grass seldom more than knee high,\r\nso that one may ride or walk over them in almost any direction with\r\ncomfort. A system of excellent horse trails affords communication\r\nwith neighbouring provinces where one may see wonderful tropical\r\nvegetation, magnificent scenery, strange wild peoples, and the most\r\nremarkable terraced mountainsides in the world. These regions may\r\nbe visited with safety and comfort, as public order is well-nigh\r\nperfect and rest houses have been provided at reasonable intervals\r\non all important main trails.\r\n\r\nThe delightfully cool climate of Baguio makes active outdoor exercise\r\nenjoyable, and insures the speedy restoration to health and vigor\r\nof persons suffering ill effects from tropical heat, or recuperation\r\nfrom wasting diseases. Open fires are comfortable morning and evening\r\nthroughout the year, and the pitch pine wood burns beautifully. Except\r\nduring typhoons the rainy season weather is delightful. When one\r\nwakens in the morning the atmosphere and the landscape have been\r\nwashed clean. The air is clear as crystal, and mountain peaks fifty\r\nor seventy-five miles away stand out with cameo-like sharpness. The\r\nneedles of the pines fairly glisten and their delightful odor\r\nis constantly in one's nostrils. The whole country is green as a\r\nlawn. Roses, violets, azaleas, \"jacks-in-the-pulpit,\" and several kinds\r\nof raspberries and huckleberries, all growing wild, make one feel as\r\nif back in America. One may visit the neighbouring Trinidad valley\r\nand see cabbages and coffee, bananas and Irish potatoes, flourishing\r\non one piece of land. Strawberry plants imported from America bear\r\ncontinuously from December to May. Fresh vegetables of all sorts tickle\r\npalates which have grown weary of the canned goods of the lowlands.\r\n\r\nAnywhere from twelve to three o'clock, the clouds begin to roll in and\r\nheavy showers fall, usually lasting until nine or ten at night. Then\r\nthe stars come out. The next day is like its predecessor.\r\n\r\nAfter the first rains, which usually come about the middle of April,\r\nthere is as a rule a month of beautiful weather with very little\r\nprecipitation. Then the rains begin to come steadily again, and keep\r\nit up until the end of the wet season, falling in the manner already\r\ndescribed so that one can get one's outdoor exercise in the morning,\r\nwhile the afternoon showers are conducive to industry.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the average maximum, minimum and mean\r\ntemperatures for each month of the year, the figures covering the\r\nperiod January, 1902, to January, 1908:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Month       Average  Average  Mean\r\n                    Maximum  Minimum\r\n                        °F.     °F.    °F.\r\n        January       75.1    50.2    63.3\r\n        February      75.4    45.8    61.6\r\n        March         77.5    49.4    64.1\r\n        April         78.2    51.9    65.7\r\n        May           77.7    54      66.2\r\n        June          77      56.8    66.2\r\n        July          75.9    55.9    65.4\r\n        August        76      54.9    65.1\r\n        September     75.2    56      65.2\r\n        October       76.4    53.8    65.1\r\n        November      76.4    49.8    64.1\r\n        December      76.1    50.3    64.1\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the above figures are for temperatures at a height of six\r\nfeet above the ground. Temperatures nearer the ground are decidedly\r\nlower. It has been found that in the Baguio plateau the lowest\r\ntemperatures correspond to the deepest valleys. In such places white\r\nfrost is not rare during the months of January, February, and March,\r\nwhile on the tops of hills the temperature is milder, frost being\r\nalmost unknown. During typhoons conditions do not differ essentially\r\nfrom those experienced elsewhere in the islands, except that the\r\nrainfall is exceptionally heavy.\r\n\r\nMajor-General J. Franklin Bell, who has given special attention to\r\nmountain resorts the world over, vigorously asserts that Baguio has\r\nno equal on the globe. Certainly the climate is more nearly perfect\r\nthan any other of which I have personal knowledge, and the delightful\r\ncoolness and the bracing air afford heavenly relief to jangling nerves\r\nand exhausted bodies, worn out by overwork and by a too prolonged\r\nsojourn in tropical lowlands.\r\n\r\nOne of the very important things about the Baguio climate is its\r\nmarvellous effect upon victims of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nPersons suffering from this disease in its earlier stages may\r\nconfidently look forward to restored health if willing to live\r\nout of doors under the pine trees, and there have been a number of\r\nextraordinary recoveries among those in advanced stages.\r\n\r\nA series of little cottages which can be thrown wide open have been\r\noperated for some time in connection with the government hospital,\r\nin order practically to demonstrate the effect of the climate on\r\ntuberculosis victims.\r\n\r\nThe results are conclusive, and whenever funds are available there\r\nshould be established a settlement of such cottages on some one of\r\nthe numerous good sites sufficiently removed from the town to avoid\r\nany possible danger of infecting healthy persons. There should also\r\nbe a large mess hall from which good nourishing food can be served,\r\nand plenty of level ground on which tents can be erected during the\r\ndry season. Baguio's potential importance as a resort for victims of\r\nthe great white plague justifies every cent of expenditure necessary\r\nto make it readily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of the Assumption have erected a handsome building which\r\nserves as a rest house and a girls' school. The sisters known as the\r\n\"Belgian Canonist Missionaries\" are erecting a building which will\r\nafford them a place to come for recuperation when wearied by strenuous\r\nwork in the lowlands, and will make it possible for them to open a\r\nschool for Igorot girls, which they are planning to do.\r\n\r\nBishop Brent has established an excellent school for American boys,\r\nsituated on a sunny hilltop. The instruction is very good, the food\r\nexcellent, and a healthier, heartier-looking lot of youngsters than\r\nthose who enjoy the privileges of this institution cannot be found\r\nanywhere. There is abundant opportunity for them to play basket-ball,\r\ntennis and golf. Some of them indulge in polo, playing on Filipino\r\nponies.\r\n\r\nBishop Brent also has a mission school for Igorot girls, and plans\r\nto open a boarding school for American girls in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian missionary priests, locally known as the \"Missionary\r\nPriests of the Church of San Patricio,\" have their headquarters at\r\nBaguio, where the chief of their order resides and where they come\r\noccasionally for rest and recuperation. Archbishop Harry has a modest\r\nhome on one of the numerous hilltops.\r\n\r\nThe building of a school for constabulary officers, to which young\r\nmen arriving from the United States are sent before entering upon\r\nactive service, crowns another hill and commands a magnificent view\r\nof the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nSeveral business concerns, such as the Compañia General de Tabacos de\r\nFilipinas, have erected rest houses for their officers and employees,\r\nwhile the number of attractive private homes increases as rapidly as\r\nthe supply of building materials will permit. Filipino residents of\r\nManila have recently invested more than a hundred thousand dollars\r\nin Baguio homes.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. No description would be anything like complete\r\nwithout mention of a unique structure which is certain to become famous\r\nthe world over. It has been built under the immediate supervision of\r\nMajor-General Bell, who has given freely of his time and thought to\r\nmake it the extraordinary success which it is. I refer to the wonderful\r\namphitheatre which stands at the side of the official residence of the\r\nmajor-general commanding the Division of the Philippines. Advantage has\r\nbeen taken of the existence of a natural amphitheatre with remarkable\r\nacoustic properties. Man has added what Nature left undone, and the\r\nresult is an imposing and beautiful auditorium capable of seating\r\nfour thousand people, throughout which a whisper can be heard. It\r\nis utilized for religious services, concerts, lectures, theatrical\r\nperformances and other public entertainments. No charge is exacted for\r\nits use, but if an admission fee is collected, a liberal percentage\r\nof the proceeds must go to some worthy charity. It has been terraced\r\nin stone by Igorot labourers; the trees originally standing in it\r\nhave been protected, and tree ferns, shrubs and flowering plants\r\nhave been added. The result beggars description, and photographs do\r\nit scant justice.\r\n\r\nIgorots from Bontoc, and even Ifugaos, now visit Baguio with increasing\r\nfrequency, attracted by a large market established especially for the\r\nbenefit of the hill people, where they may sell their manufactured\r\narticles or agricultural products, and may purchase at moderate cost\r\nthe commodities which they need. The Benguet Igorots do not raise rice\r\nenough for their own use. Formerly they had to make up the shortage\r\nby eating _camotes_, but they have now become so prosperous that they\r\ncan afford to buy rice, which is carted in over the Benguet Road.\r\n\r\nThere are promising gold mines close at hand. Their development would\r\nhave been impossible had not the construction of the Benguet Road\r\nmade it feasible to bring in the necessary heavy machinery.\r\n\r\nSome of the fruits, many of the flowers and practically all of the\r\nvegetables of the temperate zone can be advantageously produced in\r\nBenguet. They are being shipped to Manila in steadily increasing\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nOne would gather from the criticisms of the enemies of the Philippine\r\ngovernment that the Benguet Road was a pleasure boulevard. The\r\ngovernment motor trucks transported over it during the last fiscal\r\nyear 22,390 passengers and 7696.24 metric tons of freight.\r\n\r\nRailroad corporations are inclined to be a bit soulless. The Manila\r\nRailway Company is extending its line to Baguio by means of a branch\r\nleaving the main line at Aringay. The building of this extension is now\r\n[514] fifty-five per cent completed, and the company is bound under\r\nthe terms of its agreement to finish the road by August, 1914. In the\r\nevent of its failure to do so, it must pay a monthly penalty amply\r\nsufficient in amount to cover the cost of maintaining the Benguet\r\nRoad. Baguio will continue to develop steadily until the railroad\r\nis opened and then will go ahead by leaps and bounds. It is sure to\r\nprosper because it meets a very real and very imperative need.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the following extracts from a letter of August 7,\r\n1913, from the director of medical services in India to the department\r\nsurgeon of the Philippines are of interest:--\r\n\r\n    \"In reply to your letter of June 31st I attach a statement\r\n    showing the number and location of the hill stations in\r\n    India with the approximate capacity of each, and their height\r\n    above sea-level.\r\n\r\n    \"With regard to your inquiry regarding the number of cases\r\n    treated in these sanitaria we use these hill stations not\r\n    only for the treatment of convalescents, but also for giving\r\n    healthy men an opportunity of spending the Indian hot weather\r\n    under the best climatic conditions procurable. To this end,\r\n    so far as is practicable, all units are sent to the hills for\r\n    the first hot weather after their arrival in India, and they\r\n    are thus able to settle down to their new conditions of life\r\n    without being immediately exposed to the trying and enervating\r\n    environment of a plains station in the summer months. We also\r\n    send as many soldiers as we can of the older residents from\r\n    hot stations to summer in the hills.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Practically all soldiers' wives and families are given an\r\n    opportunity of a change from the more unhealthy stations to\r\n    the hills during the hot weather.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Our experience shows that the following cases are most\r\n    benefited by a change to the hills:--\r\n\r\n    \"1. All cases of malarial fever and malarial cachexia.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Patients recovering from acute diseases.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Convalescents after surgical operations.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Cases of anaemia and debility.\r\n\r\n    \"5. Cases of chronic venereal diseases.\r\n\r\n    \"6. Neurasthenics.\"\r\n\r\nNot only are all such cases greatly benefited at Baguio, but patients\r\nsuffering from dysentery and chronic diarrhoea are also greatly\r\nbenefited and often cured by a sufficiently long sojourn there. This\r\nis the experience of the civil government at its hospital and of\r\nthe military authorities at the Camp John Hay hospital, according to\r\nGeneral Bell.\r\n\r\nContinuing the quotations from the letter of the director of medical\r\nservices in India:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have found that by the judicious use of hill stations\r\n    for convalescents both the invaliding and death rate of the\r\n    British troops in Indian have been enormously reduced and the\r\n    efficiency of the Army has been increased with a considerable\r\n    financial saving to the Government.\r\n\r\n    \"It is advisable that all troops and families should be\r\n    accommodated in huts, especially during the rainy season in\r\n    the hills, but there is no doubt that they are benefited by\r\n    the change even if they have to live in tents and are thereby\r\n    exposed to considerable discomfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance attached by the British to hill stations is shown by\r\nthe fact that there are no less than 29 in India, their height above\r\nsea-level varying from 2000 to 7936 feet. Of these eleven have no\r\npermanent accommodations and are used for men only.\r\n\r\nI add the following extracts from a letter of Major P. M. Ashburn,\r\nMedical Corps, U.S.A., president of the army board for the study of\r\ntropical diseases:--\r\n\r\n    \"A man can remain in the tropics indefinitely without being\r\n    actually sick, if infectious diseases are avoided. This is fast\r\n    leading to the fallacy that we can advantageously remain many\r\n    years in these latitudes. The fact that while a man may never\r\n    be sick, he yet may have his physical and mental vigour greatly\r\n    impaired by prolonged exposure to heat is thus lost sight\r\n    of. No man can do his best work, either physical or mental,\r\n    if he is hot and uncomfortable. The same feeling of lassitude\r\n    and indisposition to exertion is experienced at home during\r\n    the hot summer, which after a few years here becomes chronic.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It is a matter of official recognition that government\r\n    employees need to get away from the heat of Manila each year,\r\n    hence the removal to Baguio.\r\n\r\n    \"It is likewise commonly recognized that many women and\r\n    children become so run down and debilitated as to need to go\r\n    to Japan, Baguio or the United States.\r\n\r\n    \"It is often true that monotony and discomfort are the cause\r\n    of nervous and mental breakdown, witness the often-mentioned\r\n    insanity among farmers' wives and the nervous breakdowns\r\n    attributable to pain and strain, even though it be, as in\r\n    many cases of eyestrain, so slight as not to be recognized\r\n    by the patient.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, it is the monotony of a tropical lowland climate which makes\r\nan occasional change so imperatively necessary. Shall residents of\r\nthe Philippines be forced to seek that change, at great expense of\r\ntime and money, in Japan, the United States or Europe, or shall we\r\nmake and keep available for them a region which admirably answers\r\nthe purpose, distant only half a day's travel from Manila?\r\n\r\nI give extracts from a memorandum of Col. William H. Arthur, Department\r\nSurgeon of the Philippines, which are important in this connection:--\r\n\r\n    \"3. Experience has shown that long residence in the Philippines\r\n    has a marked effect on the mental and physical vigour of people\r\n    not born and raised in the tropics. This is manifested in many\r\n    ways, and men, women and children who are not actually ill,\r\n    seem to lose their energy, become listless, irritable, and\r\n    forgetful, and find the least exertion burdensome. This is\r\n    much aggravated in the hot season, and very few individuals\r\n    manage, without permanent mental and physical deterioration,\r\n    to live through many hot seasons in the plains.\r\n\r\n    \"4. There are in the Philippine Islands two places where\r\n    relief from these conditions can be found:--(1) Camp John Hay,\r\n    near Baguio, in the mountain province of Benguet, Island of\r\n    Luzón; and (2) Camp Keithley, in the Lake Lanao District of\r\n    the Island of Mindanao. Camp John Hay, in the province of\r\n    Benguet, is in the mountains at an elevation of approximately\r\n    5000 feet and is 175 miles from Manila, most of which distance\r\n    is covered by railroad. Within 18 months it is expected that\r\n    the railroad all the way to Baguio will be completed.\r\n\r\n    \"5. Experience has shown that a large number of cases of\r\n    disease or injury, or patients convalescing from surgical\r\n    operations, recover much more rapidly in the cool mountain\r\n    climate of Baguio than in the depressing heat and humidity of\r\n    the plains. Before the establishment of this mountain refuge\r\n    from the heat of the plains, many cases of this class were\r\n    transferred to the United States that are now brought back\r\n    to health at Camp John Hay and Camp Keithley. The beneficial\r\n    effect of the change in climate is particularly noticeable in\r\n    people who have become run down after one or more hot seasons\r\n    spent at the lower levels.\r\n\r\n    \"6. The great value of a refuge in the mountains from the\r\n    effect of prolonged heat is shown in enclosed reports, which\r\n    indicate the classes of cases especially benefited, but there\r\n    are a great many others not reported and not actually sick\r\n    but whose vitality and resistance are more or less diminished\r\n    and who find great benefit from an occasional sojourn in the\r\n    mountains of Benguet or the highlands of Mindanao, especially\r\n    during the hottest part of the year.\"\r\n\r\nI have quoted thus at length from communications of a distinguished\r\nBritish medical officer, of a well-known and able special student\r\nof tropical diseases, and of the ranking United States army surgeon\r\nin the islands to show the consensus of opinion among experienced\r\nexperts as to the necessity of hill stations in the tropics. I might\r\ngive numerous additional similar opinions of equally competent men\r\nbut will only add two more statements of Major Ashburn, the latter\r\nof which seems to me admirably to sum up the situation:--\r\n\r\n    So firm is my belief in the efficacy of the place that I have\r\n    at considerable expense kept my two sons in school there,\r\n    instead of keeping them at home in Manila at no expense\r\n    for schooling, and so satisfactory has been the result in\r\n    normal, vigorous growth and robust health for both boys,\r\n    that I consider the money so spent about the best investment\r\n    I have ever made.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I state all this to show the faith that is in me. To experience\r\n    Baguio and to see the rapid improvement of visitors there\r\n    is to be convinced that it is a delightful and beneficial\r\n    climate. To appreciate the full degree of its delights it\r\n    is only necessary to compare in one's own experience (not\r\n    in weather reports) a hot season in Manila and one there. To\r\n    appreciate its benefits it is necessary to compare in one's\r\n    own experience (not in statistics) the appearance of health\r\n    of the people seen at the two times and places. As recent\r\n    work on beri-beri has clearly shown the vast importance in\r\n    diet of substances formerly not known to have any importance,\r\n    so, I think, are the factors in climate not to be recorded by\r\n    wind gauges, thermometers or other meteorological instruments,\r\n    and factors in health and efficiency not recorded in books\r\n    on physiology, bacteriology, pathology or health statistics.\"\r\n\r\nLet no one think that the summer capital of the Philippines has been\r\nbuilt solely for the benefit of Americans. The Filipinos need it\r\nalmost as much as we do, and many of them profit by the change with\r\nextraordinary promptness.\r\n\r\nIt is really almost incredible that such a place should exist\r\nwithin eight hours' travel of Manila, and every possible victim of\r\ntuberculosis in the islands, which means every inhabitant of the\r\nlowlands, has a right to demand that it should be made, and kept,\r\nreadily accessible. Existing accommodations are nothing like adequate\r\nfor the crowds which desire to take advantage of them during the\r\nseason. Hotels are filled to overflowing. There are always several\r\ndifferent applicants for each government cottage. Many persons who\r\nwould be glad to spend the hot months in the Benguet mountains find\r\nit impossible to do so, because they cannot obtain accommodation,\r\nand at present many more are obliged to shorten their stay in order\r\nto give others a chance.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, when we were facing unforeseen difficulties and\r\ndiscouragements, I was for a time the one member of the Philippine\r\nCommission who was really enthusiastically in favour of carrying\r\nout the original plans for the summer capital. It was then the\r\nfashion to charge me with responsibility for the policy of opening\r\nup communication with the place and for the mistakes made in the\r\nconstruction of the Benguet Road, although I had never had any control\r\nover the road work and had been one of five at first, and later one\r\nof nine, to vote for every appropriation found necessary in order to\r\ncomplete it.\r\n\r\nIt was the enthusiasm of Mr. Forbes which at a critical time finally\r\nsaved the situation, and now that Baguio has arrived, and the wisdom of\r\nthe policy so long pursued in the face of manifold discouragements has\r\nbeen demonstrated, my one fear is that he will get all the glory and\r\nthat I shall be denied credit for the part which I actually did play\r\nin bringing about the determination to establish quick communication\r\nwith one of the most wonderful mountain health resorts to be found in\r\nany tropical country, and in giving that determination effect. But I\r\nhave had a more than abundant reward of another sort. My wife, my son\r\nand I myself, when seriously ill, have been restored to vigorous health\r\nby brief sojourns at this one of the world's great health resorts.\r\n\r\nIt has been very much the fashion for Filipino politicians to rail at\r\nBaguio, and now that the dangerous experiment of giving them control\r\nof both houses of the legislature is being made, they may refuse to\r\nappropriate the sums necessary to make possible the annual transfer\r\nof the insular government to that place. The result of such a bit of\r\npolitics would be a marked increase in the present extraordinarily\r\nlow death rate among government officers and employees, American and\r\nFilipino, [515] beginning in about two years, when the cumulative\r\neffect of long residence in the lowlands makes itself felt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Baguio can stand on its own feet, and if, as the politicians\r\nsuggest, the government buildings there be sold at auction, purchasers\r\nfor all dwelling houses should readily be found. Too many Filipinos\r\nhave learned by happy experience the delights of this wonderful region,\r\nto let such an opportunity pass. Baguio has come to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe Coördination of Scientific Work\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Americans landed at Manila, they found no government institutions\r\nfor the training of physicians and surgeons and no hospital in any\r\nsense modern or indeed worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nThere did exist the equipment of what had been called a municipal\r\nlaboratory, outfitted for a limited amount of chemical work only.\r\n\r\nWhen the Philippine Commission arrived on the scene, it fell to my\r\nlot to draft the necessary legislation for placing scientific work\r\non a firm foundation, and, later, as secretary of the interior, to\r\nexercise ultimate executive control over practically all such work\r\ncarried on under the insular government.\r\n\r\nThe complete initial lack of adequate hospital facilities and of\r\nmeans for making chemical and bacteriological investigations had been\r\npromptly remedied by the establishment of army hospitals and an army\r\nlaboratory. Although these could not be placed fully at the service of\r\nthe public, they nevertheless bridged the gap for the time being, and\r\nin formulating laws and making plans for the future I was inclined to\r\nsay, \"Blessed be nothing,\" as we were not hampered by useless employees\r\nor archaic equipment, but were left free to make a clean start.\r\n\r\nI had thoroughly learned one lesson at the University of Michigan while\r\na member of its zoölogical staff. We had a zoölogical laboratory in\r\nwhich were conducted the zoölogical half of a course in general biology\r\nand numerous other courses in animal morphology, mammalian anatomy,\r\ncomparative anatomy and embryology. There was also a botanical\r\nlaboratory in which all of the botanical work of the institution\r\nwas carried on. This did not involve any overlapping, but there was\r\noverlapping of the work of the zoölogical laboratory and that of the\r\nmedical department, which had an anatomical laboratory, a histological\r\nlaboratory, a pathological laboratory and a so-called hygienic\r\nlaboratory. The professor of anatomy thought that his students would\r\nunderstand human anatomy better if they knew something of comparative\r\nanatomy, and instead of sending them to us wished to start his own\r\ncourses. The histologist dabbled in embryology and was soon duplicating\r\nour course in the embryology of the chick. He was constantly at war\r\nwith the pathologist over the question of where histology left off\r\nand pathology began, and both of them were inclined to differ with\r\nthe man in charge of the hygienic laboratory over similar questions of\r\njurisdiction. Furthermore, we had a chemical laboratory split up into\r\nvarious more or less independent subdivisions, and a psychological\r\nlaboratory. In these several institutions for scientific research\r\nthere was much duplication of instruction and of books, apparatus\r\nand laboratory equipment. Great economies might have been effected\r\nby the establishment of a central purchasing agency, which could have\r\nobtained wholesale rates on supplies ordered in large quantity. Nothing\r\nof the sort existed. One laboratory chief would order from the corner\r\ndrug store, while another bought in Germany.\r\n\r\nThere was danger that a similar condition of things might arise in\r\nthe Philippines. The Bureau of Health would want its chemical and its\r\nbiological laboratories; the Bureau of Agriculture would need to do\r\nchemical work covering a wide range of subjects, and botanical and\r\nentomological work as well. The Bureau of Forestry would of course\r\nrequire a large amount of botanical work, and would also need to\r\nhave chemical work done on gums, resins and other forest products,\r\nto say nothing of investigating insects injurious to trees and more\r\nespecially to timber after cutting. The latter class of destroyers\r\ndo enormous damage in the Philippines. Much chemical work would\r\nbe required by the Bureau of Customs, which as a matter of fact\r\nlater insisted upon the necessity of a \"microscopical laboratory\"\r\nto provide facilities for the examination of fibres, etc. Obviously\r\nthere would be a large amount of work for the general government in\r\nconnection with investigation of the mineral resources of the country,\r\nand the testing of coals, cements and road materials.\r\n\r\nSmallpox was decimating the population. There was need of the\r\nmanufacture of great quantities of virus with which to combat it,\r\nand of other common and necessary serums and prophylactics as well.\r\n\r\nHere then was a golden opportunity to start right. In imagination I saw\r\na Bureau of Science for scientific research and for routine scientific\r\nwork, a great General Hospital, and a modern and up-to-date College of\r\nMedicine and Surgery, standing side by side and working in full and\r\nharmonious relationship. The medical school would give to the youth\r\nof the land the best possible facilities for theoretical training\r\nin medicine and surgery, while access to the wards of the hospital\r\nwould make possible for them a large amount of practical bedside\r\nwork. Its operating amphitheatres would increase the opportunity\r\nfor clinical instruction, as would a great free outpatient clinic,\r\nconducted primarily for the benefit of the poor. Professors in the\r\ncollege would hold positions on the hospital staff, not only in order\r\nto give to them and to their students every facility for clinical\r\ndemonstration work, but to enable them constantly to \"keep their\r\nhands in.\" Promising Filipino graduates would be given internships\r\nand other positions on the house staff of the hospital. Patients\r\nwould be admitted to its free beds subject to the condition that they\r\nallow their cases to be studied by the faculty and students of the\r\ncollege. The necessary biological and chemical examinations for the\r\nhospital would be made in the laboratories of the Bureau of Science,\r\nwhich would at the same time afford every facility for the carrying on\r\nof scientific investigation by advanced students, by members of the\r\nfaculty of the college and by members of the hospital staff. Members\r\nof the staff of the biological laboratory would have the use of the\r\ngreat volume of pathological material from the hospital, and with\r\nfree access to its rooms and wards, would have an almost unparalleled\r\nopportunity for the study of tropical diseases, while some of the\r\nofficers and employees of the Bureau of Science and of the Bureau of\r\nHealth might be made members of the faculty of the college and their\r\nservices utilized as instructors.\r\n\r\nAs we had neither laboratories, hospital nor college at the time,\r\nthe realization of this somewhat comprehensive scheme seemed rather\r\nremote. It was commonly referred to as \"Worcester's dream,\" and one\r\nof my friends in the army medical corps probably quite correctly\r\nvoiced public sentiment when he said, \"Poor Worcester has bats in his\r\nbelfry.\" However, he laughs best who laughs last! After the lapse of\r\na good many years my dream came true. The three great institutions\r\nwhich I hoped might sometime be established are to-day in existence,\r\nand are doing the work which I hoped that they might perform. Now\r\nlet us consider how they came to be.\r\n\r\nIn the early days I drafted an act providing for the establishment of\r\na Bureau of Government Laboratories which should perform all of the\r\nbiological and chemical work of the government under the direction\r\nof one chief, and on July 1, 1901 the commission passed it.\r\n\r\nI was more than fortunate in securing as the director of this\r\nbureau Dr. Paul C. Freer, then professor of general chemistry at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan.\r\n\r\nDr. Freer obtained leave of absence for a year, in order to help us\r\nget started. This leave was twice extended for additional periods of\r\none year each, and in the end he decided to sever his connection with\r\nthe university and throw in his lot with the Philippine government.\r\n\r\nHe remained in charge of the Bureau of Government Laboratories and\r\nof its successor, the Bureau of Science, until his death on April\r\n17, 1912.\r\n\r\nHimself a chemist and investigator of note, he had a wide and\r\ncatholic knowledge of science in general, and no better man could\r\nhave been found for this important piece of constructive work. For\r\nnearly a year the two of us laboured over plans for the laboratory\r\nbuilding and lists of the necessary books, instruments, apparatus,\r\nglassware, chemicals and other supplies. At the end of this time we\r\nsubmitted to the commission what I do not hesitate to say was the\r\nmost complete estimate for a large project which ever came before\r\nit. Much forethought was necessary in order to time the orders for\r\nbooks, instruments and apparatus so that it would be possible to\r\nhouse them properly when they arrived, and the estimated expense was\r\ndistributed over a period of two and one-half years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile work had begun in cramped temporary quarters in a\r\nhot little \"shack,\" for it deserved no better name, back of the\r\nCivil Hospital. Here under almost impossible conditions there were\r\nperformed a large volume of routine biological and chemical work,\r\nand a considerable amount of research, the results of which proved\r\nto be of far-reaching importance.\r\n\r\nWith the employment of the first chemists and bacteriologists there\r\narose a class of questions which I determined to settle once for\r\nall. There is a regrettable tendency among some scientific men to try\r\nto build barbed-wire fences around particular fields of research in\r\nwhich they happen to be interested, and to shoo every one else away.\r\n\r\nAt the outset I gave all employees clearly to understand that such\r\nan unscientific and ungenerous spirit would not be tolerated in the\r\nBureau of Government Laboratories. The field which opened before us\r\nwas enormous. There was work enough and more than enough for all, and\r\nwe should at the outset adopt a spirit of friendliness and helpfulness\r\ntoward every scientific man who desired to lend a hand.\r\n\r\nThis rule of conduct has been steadfastly adhered to. Numerous\r\nwell-known scientists have visited the Philippines and to each we have\r\nextended all possible assistance, furnishing laboratory quarters,\r\ninstruments, apparatus and reagents, and, whenever practicable,\r\nmaterial as well. Indeed, many of our scientific guests have been\r\nmade employees of the bureau without pay, so that there might be no\r\nquestioning of their right to use government equipment.\r\n\r\nTwo important results have followed this policy. One is that we have\r\nestablished the friendliest and most helpful relations with numerous\r\nresearch institutions. The other is that we have been able to assist\r\nin the performance of much valuable work which has borne important\r\nresults, and which would perhaps have remained undone had it not been\r\npossible for us to aid those who undertook it.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time came our fine new building, with good facilities\r\nfor performing all kinds of laboratory work. When it was equipped\r\nand occupied, we were able to say that the opportunities offered at\r\nManila for investigating tropical diseases were probably unequalled\r\nelsewhere, and there was a deal of such investigation urgently needing\r\nto be made. Our equipment for chemical research was also very complete\r\nand the vast undeveloped natural resources of the islands presented\r\na practically virgin field for such investigation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset absurd rumours spread as to the cost of buildings and\r\nequipment, and there was much popular outcry against the supposed\r\nwastefulness of the government. A simple statement of the facts\r\nserved to kill these foolish tales, and people soon began to see that\r\nthe creation of the Bureau of Government Laboratories was merely the\r\napplication of common-sense to existing conditions and had resulted in\r\ngreatly increased economy and efficiency. Indeed, at the suggestion\r\nof a committee appointed to make a study of the government service\r\nand suggest measures for its betterment, the principle which I had\r\nadopted was carried still further. Not only was all zoölogical and\r\nbotanical work transferred to this bureau, but the Bureau of Ethnology\r\nand the Bureau of Mines were abolished as separate entities and were\r\nmade divisions of it, and its title was changed to \"The Bureau of\r\nScience.\" Little by little the scope of the work has steadily widened.\r\n\r\nThe scientific books and periodicals of the government were scattered\r\namong half a dozen different bureaus and were not being well cared\r\nfor. I arranged to have them all temporarily transferred to the\r\nlibrary of the Bureau of Science and catalogued there. Those said\r\nto be really needed for frequent reference were then returned to\r\nthe several bureaus but were kept under observation by the bureau of\r\nscience librarian, who took particular pains to look after the binding\r\nof serial publications as rapidly as the volumes were completed.\r\n\r\nThe list of books requested by the several bureau chiefs for\r\nreference was suspiciously long. I gave orders that each set of bureau\r\nbookshelves be provided with cards and a box into which to drop them,\r\nand each time a book was used a card was made out for it and placed\r\nin the box. After six months I quietly gathered up the cards and had\r\nthem checked against the lists of books for which the several bureau\r\nchiefs had asked, and was then able to order a large proportion of them\r\nback to the library for the reason that they had not been used at all.\r\n\r\nThe result of this policy is that we have to-day a central\r\nscientific library in which are catalogued all the scientific books\r\nof the government. Books needed by the several bureaus for frequent\r\nreference are placed where they can be used conveniently, and the\r\ncard catalogue indicates where they are, so that they can readily be\r\nfound. In this way it has been possible to avoid much needless and\r\nexpensive duplication. The library now contains 26,652 bound volumes.\r\n\r\nWe were extremely fortunate in the men whose services we secured\r\nin the early days, and the volume of research work turned out was\r\nunexpectedly large. The question of how best to arrange for the\r\nprompt publication of our results became urgent, and in the end we\r\nanswered it by publishing the _Philippine Journal of Science_, now\r\nin its eighth year and with an assured and enviable position among\r\nthe scientific journals of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the early days before we knew what we now know about the\r\npreservation of health in tropical countries there was a deal of\r\nsickness among government officers and employees. While the army was\r\nmore than liberal in helping us meet the conditions which arose,\r\nit was of course very necessary that we should establish our own\r\nhospital as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOn October 12, 1901, the so-called \"Civil Hospital\" was opened\r\nin a large private dwelling, obtained, as we then fondly imagined,\r\nmerely as a temporary expedient. Together with two adjoining and even\r\nsmaller buildings it continued to be our only place for the treatment\r\nof ordinary medical and surgical cases until September 1, 1910! I\r\ncan here only very briefly outline the causes of this long delay.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the building was large enough to meet immediate needs. At\r\nthe time when it began to grow inadequate there was a plan on foot\r\nfor a large private institution, in which the government was to secure\r\naccommodations for its patients, and a hospital building was actually\r\nerected, but interest in this project waned, the private backing which\r\nwas believed to have been assured for it failed, and the whole scheme\r\nwent by the board. Then plans for a great general hospital were called\r\nfor. A very large amount of time was consumed in their preparation and\r\nwhen they were finished the expense involved in carrying them out was\r\nfound to be far beyond the means of the government. Ultimately I was\r\ncharged with the duty of securing other plans involving a more moderate\r\nexpenditure. Again long delay necessarily ensued. When semi-final\r\nplans were submitted, the consulting architect insisted on a series\r\nof arches along the sides of the several ward pavilions which were\r\ndoubtless most satisfying from an artistic point of view, but would\r\nhave shut off light and fresh air to an extent which I could not\r\ntolerate. A three months' deadlock was finally broken by his acceding\r\nto my wishes, but in October, 1906, just as the completed plans were\r\nfinally ready to submit to the commission, I was compelled by severe\r\nillness to return to the United States. There remained three American\r\nand three Filipino members of the commission. One of the former was\r\nMr. W. Morgan Shuster, then secretary of public instruction. Prior\r\nto the time when he became a candidate for a secretaryship he had\r\nbeen bitter in his criticism of the Filipinos. Coincidently with the\r\ndevelopment of this ambition he became almost more pro-Filipino than\r\nsome of the Filipino politicians themselves. For a time he seemed to\r\ncontrol the Filipino vote on the commission and largely as a result of\r\nhis activities every important matter which I left pending, including\r\nthat of the establishment of the great general hospital so vitally\r\nneeded by the people of the islands, was laid on the table. I was\r\ninformed that Mr. Shuster had announced that we could have $125,000\r\nfor the hospital and no more! We needed $400,000.\r\n\r\nBeginning on the day after my return the following April these several\r\nprojects, including that for the Baguio Hospital and that for the\r\nPhilippine General Hospital. were taken from the table and passed.\r\n\r\nConstruction work goes slowly in the tropics. One ward pavilion of the\r\nPhilippine General Hospital was occupied on September 1, 1910. Soon\r\nafterward the four others came into use.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 1907, a medical college was opened. It was called \"The\r\nPhilippine Medical School.\" Its creation at this time was made possible\r\nby the existence of the Bureaus of Science and Health. Its staff was\r\nat the outset recruited very largely from these two bureaus. The\r\ndirector of the Bureau of Science was made its dean and continued\r\nto hold this position until his death. To his unselfish efforts and\r\nto those of the director of health is due the well-organized modern\r\ncollege which we have to-day. In lieu of better quarters the first\r\nclasses were held in an old Spanish government building which was\r\naltered and added to until it answered the purpose reasonably well.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the act which provided for the establishment of\r\nthis college was intrusted to me. I called for the assistance of a\r\ncommittee of technical experts and asked that they submit a draft\r\nfor my consideration, which they did. It contained a provision to the\r\neffect that the college should be under the administrative control of\r\nthe secretary of the interior. I struck out the words \"secretary of the\r\ninterior\" and inserted in lieu thereof the words \"secretary of public\r\ninstruction\" for two reasons. First, the school theoretically belongs\r\nunder that official, in spite of its necessarily close relationship\r\nwith the Bureau of Science and the Bureau of Health. Second, I wanted\r\nthe support of the secretary of public instruction for the measure,\r\nas it involved considerable expenditure and I was not sure how the\r\nbill might fare in the commission. It happened that the incumbent\r\nof that position was very much inclined to take a liberal view of\r\nbills which extended his jurisdiction. Mr. Taft, when he visited\r\nthe Philippines in 1909, reached the conclusion that I was guilty\r\nof an error of judgment in doing this, and a little later expressed\r\nthe view that the Medical College ought to be under the control of\r\nthe secretary of the interior, because of its intimate relationship\r\nwith the bureaus above mentioned. I might perhaps even then have had\r\nthis change made, but refrained from attempting to do so, believing\r\nthat all would go well under the existing arrangement. So long as\r\nDr. Freer lived this was the case.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of absolute honesty and sincerity of purpose, and\r\nwas far-seeing enough fully to realize that the interests of the\r\ngovernment, and of individuals as well, would best be served by\r\ncarrying out the broad and liberal policy which was then in effect.\r\n\r\nThe next event of importance was the establishment of the University\r\nof the Philippines, which was provided for by an Act passed on June\r\n18, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Medical School was in due time incorporated with the\r\nuniversity as its College of Medicine and Surgery, passing under the\r\nexecutive control of the university board of regents.\r\n\r\nAt this time the plan of which I had dreamed so many years before\r\nwas in full force and effect and was working admirably. Members of\r\nthe Bureau of Science staff served on the college faculty and held\r\nappointments in the Philippine General Hospital as well, one of them\r\nbeing the chief of a division there. Members of the college faculty\r\ncarried on research work at the Bureau of Science. The great working\r\nlibrary installed in the building of the latter bureau served as the\r\nmedical library. Members of the college faculty also rendered important\r\nservice in the Philippine General Hospital, where two of them were\r\nchiefs of divisions, two held important positions on the house staff\r\nand numerous others served as interns. Officers of the Bureau of Health\r\nwere appointed to the faculty of the college and carried on research\r\nwork at the Bureau of Science. The staff of the latter bureau made\r\nthe chemical and biological examinations needed in connection with\r\nthe work of the hospital as well as those required by the Bureau of\r\nHealth. The Bureau of Science manufactured the sera and prophylactics\r\nrequired by the Bureau of Health in its work. The two large operating\r\namphitheatres in the Philippine General Hospital were planned with\r\nespecial reference to the accommodation of students, who could pass\r\nalong a gallery from one to the other. The work of the free clinic,\r\nattended daily by hundreds of Filipinos seeking relief, was largely\r\nturned over to the college faculty, and increased opportunities were\r\nthus given for medical students to study actual cases.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was an ideal one. It excited the admiration of numerous\r\nvisiting European and American experts, who were competent to judge\r\nof its merits, and its continued success was dependent only upon the\r\nhonesty of purpose, loyalty and good faith of the several parties\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThen came the untimely death of Dr. Freer. A few months later an\r\nattempt was made by certain university officers to secure control of\r\nthe professional work of the hospital for that institution, leaving\r\nthe director of health and the secretary of the interior in charge\r\nof the nurses, servants, accounts and property, and burdened with\r\nthe responsibility for the results of work involving life and death,\r\nbut without voice in the choice of the men who were to perform it.\r\n\r\nThose who were responsible for this effort evidently had not taken\r\nthe trouble to read the law, and I had only to call attention to its\r\nprovisions in order to end for the time this first effort to disturb\r\nthe existing logical distribution of work between the two institutions.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Manila in October, 1913, a second attempt was being made\r\nto secure control of the professional work of the hospital for the\r\nuniversity, but this time the plan was more far-reaching, in that it\r\ncontemplated the transfer to the university of control of the Bureau of\r\nScience as well; and more logical, in that a bill accomplishing these\r\nends had been drafted for consideration by the Filipinized legislature.\r\n\r\nThe original plan for the coördination of the scientific work of\r\nthe Philippine government was sound in principle and will, I trust,\r\neventually be carried out, whatever may be done temporarily to upset\r\nit during a period of disturbed political conditions.

Aguinaldo was\r\n    'master' of the Cavite Lodge. Moreover, he was a member of\r\n    the 'Katipúnan' Society and the chief of the many members\r\n    who were in the pueblo of Cavite Viejo. What was to be\r\n    done? Aguinaldo, not knowing what to do, and mindful of the\r\n    fact that the curate there knew positively that he was not\r\n    only a mason, but also the chief of the Katipúnans of his\r\n    pueblo, considered it expedient on the night of August 29 to\r\n    at once call a meeting of all the compromised persons in his\r\n    town. Aguinaldo made clear to them their grave situation.\r\n\r\n\"They all agreed that on the following day Aguinaldo, their chief,\r\nshould make representations to the Governor of Cavite; so he went away\r\nvery early the following morning, presented himself to the governor,\r\nand in the name of the people of Cavite Viejo offered him their\r\nrespects and their loyalty to Spain, at the same time requesting\r\nhim to condescend to send to his town a garrison of 100 men for\r\nits security. The governor replied that he would first consult the\r\ncaptain-general, and if the proposition was approved he would send\r\nthe garrison at once.\r\n\r\n\"As Aguinaldo was greatly beloved by the governor and his wife, they\r\noffered him wine and sweetmeats. As soon as this was over he took\r\nhis leave and returned happy to his town. On arrival in the town\r\nhe assembled all the compromised persons and informed them of the\r\nbrilliant result of his efforts. Continuing, he told them that then was\r\nthe opportune moment for rising in arms against the Spaniards. To this\r\nthey unanimously replied by saying it was terrible, because no arms\r\nwere available, and that for this reason it would certainly prove to\r\nbe a disaster for them.\r\n\r\n\"But Aguinaldo, in company with his godfather, the lamented Candido\r\nTirona, insisted on convincing them with their strong arguments. They\r\nmade them understand that Spanish cruelty would annihilate them\r\nwithout fail, and for no other reason than that they were members of\r\nthe Katipúnan.\r\n\r\n\"As it happened, at that very time there were two 'Guardia Civil'\r\nsoldiers in the court-house. So at about 2 o'clock in the morning,\r\nAguinaldo and Tirona went directly to the court-house. Arriving there,\r\nthese two determined insurgent chiefs intimated to the guards that\r\nthey should surrender their equipments. These replied that it was\r\nimpossible, and said they would die first. Instantly a struggle ensued\r\nbetween the four men, which lasted nearly an hour. But it resulted in\r\nfavor of the insurgent chiefs who succeeded in taking the guns and\r\ncartridges. Once in possession of these armaments, the two chiefs,\r\naccompanied by a number of the town people, directed themselves to\r\nthe convent in order to capture the curate. Very unfortunately for\r\nthem, the curate was no longer there when they arrived; he had made\r\nhis escape. While the struggle was going on with the guards in the\r\ncourt-house, he received the news and fled at once by embarking in\r\na native boat.\r\n\r\n\"The insurgent chiefs then returned to the court-house and immediately\r\nprepared a communication to all the municipal captains in the provinces\r\nof Cavite, Batangas and Laguna, inviting them to at once rise against\r\nSpain, and stating that their own town of Cavite Viejo was already\r\nfreed from slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Each one of these communications was sent out by a mounted courier,\r\nso that before the expiration of many hours all the towns in Cavite\r\nProvince were informed of what had taken place in Cavite Viejo.\r\n\r\n\"On the following day some of the towns took up arms. At the same\r\ntime Aguinaldo, in company with many people from his town, marched on\r\nImus in order to attack the Spanish troops who were there. When he\r\narrived in Imus the people of this town at once joined him and they\r\nall went to the convent, in which were the friars and the soldiers\r\nof the 'Guardia Civil.' Just as he arrived at the atrium of the\r\nChurch his companions did not wish to follow him, for fear that the\r\nsoldiers were occupying the church tower. So Aguinaldo advanced alone\r\nuntil he reached the door of the convent. Once here, he called his\r\ncompanions to aid him. But these were not so determined as he was,\r\nand only about five responded. When these got to where Aguinaldo was,\r\nhe commenced breaking in the door which was soon open. They went\r\nupstairs, but they found nobody, since the friars and soldiers had\r\ncrossed over to the treasury building.\r\n\r\n\"Aguinaldo's companions were now numerous, because the others followed\r\nhim when they saw that nothing happened to those who went up into\r\nthe convent; and all of these went immediately to the treasury\r\nbuilding, in which were the friars and soldiers whom they were\r\nhunting. When they reached it they found the doors closed, so they\r\ncould not pass. Aguinaldo ordered the house burned. Those in hiding\r\ninside the house were without any other remedy and had to surrender;\r\nbut meanwhile some of them had been burned to death, among these a\r\nlieutenant of the 'Guardia Civil.' By this victory Aguinaldo succeeded\r\nin taking 17 rifles and two 2 1/2 pounder guns.\"--P.I.R., 869.\r\n\r\n[56] \"My Beloved Countrymen: I accepted the agreement of peace\r\nproposed by Don Pedro A.

The last telegrams from Europe which\r\nFelipe will send you by this mail are alarming for our future. The\r\npreliminaries of peace are announced. The demand of America is,\r\nannexation of Porto Rico and the Ladrone Islands, independence of\r\nCuba under an American protectorate and an American coaling station\r\nin the Philippines. That is, they will again deliver us into the hands\r\nof Spain. On the other hand, all the powers will unite to prevent the\r\nannexation of the Philippines, according to the telegrams of Regidor;\r\nthe American cabinet hesitates about including us in the negotiations\r\nfor peace from fear of a conflict with us and the Filipinos in Europe\r\nadvise us to send a message to America giving our unconditional\r\nadhesion. If events will be what these telegrams indicate, we have a\r\ndark and bloody future before us. To be again in the hands of Spain\r\nwill mean a long and bloody war, and it is doubtful whether the end\r\nwill be favourable to us. The treaty of peace sanctioned by the other\r\npowers will assure the dominion of Spain. Spain free from Cuba and\r\nher other colonies will employ all her energy to crush us and will\r\nsend here the 150,000 men she has in Cuba. I do not think that the\r\nFilipinos will again submit to their tyrants and there will be a long\r\nand bloody war. And on account of the treaty the other powers will\r\naid Spain to completely dominate us and place all possible obstacles\r\nin our way to prevent shipment of arms and all kinds of revolutionary\r\nlabours. In view of all this and bearing in mind the present urgency\r\nof the matter, it is necessary for that government to establish and\r\npublish its policy.

There were too\r\nmany natives there with friends and relations in Aguinaldo's camp to\r\nmake him desire to subject the city to the hardships of an effective\r\nsiege. And, furthermore, he did not have the force, nor did his men\r\nhave the necessary discipline, to prevent the ingress of supplies. It\r\nwas not until the first part of July that the price of provisions\r\nincreased. It was at no time found necessary by the authorities to take\r\nover all the stores of provisions in the city. Indeed, there seems to\r\nhave been a fairly steady traffic in supplies between Manila and the\r\ncountry to the north. It was a traffic in which it has been charged\r\nthat certain Spanish officers of rank made large sums. Aguinaldo\r\npermitted it, and on July 26, 1898, signed an order directing that\r\nfood should be sent into Manila from the north to prevent starvation\r\nin the city, and ordered the heads of the towns in the vicinity not\r\nto interfere with this traffic (P.I.R., 1087-4). The entrance of food\r\nsupplies was confined to the northern line, for then it would not be\r\nknown to the Americans who, after July 30, occupied the entrenchments\r\nin front of San Antonio Abad.

I am the Republic.'\"--Blount, p. 292.\r\n\r\n[353] \"The war demonstrated to the army, to a Q. E. D., that the\r\nFilipinos are 'capable of self-government,' unless the kind which\r\nhappens to suit the genius of the American people is the only kind of\r\ngovernment on earth that is respectable, and the one panacea for all\r\nthe ills of government among men without regard to their temperament or\r\nhistorical antecedents. The educated patriotic Filipinos can control\r\nthe masses of the people in their several districts as completely as\r\na captain ever controlled a company.\"--Blount, p. 292.\r\n\r\n[354] \"Even to-day the presidente of a pueblo is as absolute boss\r\nof his town as Charles F.

God preserve you, Captain General,\r\nmany years.\" P.I.R., 1080. 1. Every now and then we find a queer use\r\nof the term \"royal family.\" This seems to have been common among the\r\nmass of the people. Heads of towns and men of position often used\r\nthe expression \"royal orders\" in speaking of the orders and decrees\r\nissued by Aguinaldo. For example, the officials of Tayug, a town of\r\n19,000 people in Pangasinán Province, certified, on October 9, 1898,\r\nthat they had carried out the instructions for \"the establishment of\r\nthe popular government in accordance with the royal decree of June 18,\r\n1898.\"--P.I.R., 1188. 1.\r\n\r\nIn October certain of Aguinaldo's adherents in Tondo wrote to him and\r\nprotested against the acts of the local presidente, who, they held,\r\nhad not been duly elected in accordance with the provisions of the\r\n\"royal order\" of June 18, 1898. They closed their respectful protest\r\nby requesting that said royal order should be obeyed.--Taylor, AJ., 63.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 an officer of the army in Union Province wrote: \"In accordance\r\nwith the orders of the secretary of war of our republican government\r\nof these islands, issued in compliance with royal decree, article 5,\r\npublished on March 8.\" On September 1, 1898, the local presidente\r\nof the town of Mangatarem, writing to the head of the province,\r\nsaid that he had not furnished the estimates required because the\r\nelections provided for in \"article 7 of the royal decree of the\r\nsuperior government, dated June 18 last,\" had not been approved. A\r\nyoung son of a member of Aguinaldo's cabinet, writing to his father in\r\nSeptember, 1899, spoke of the \"royal decree of June 18, 1898.\"--P.I.R.,\r\n1188. 3. In Romblon, in August, 1898, elections were held in compliance\r\nwith the prescription of the \"royal decree of June 18, 1898,\" and\r\nAguinaldo approved them, apparently without considering that this\r\nwas an anomalous way of describing a decree of the dictator of the\r\nso-called republic. On March 7, 1899, a general in the revolutionary\r\nservice stated that an officer had been released from arrest by a\r\n\"royal order.\" The attitude of mind which made men speak of Aguinaldo's\r\n\"royal orders\" in 1898 did not change when he fled before the advance\r\nof the United States army. His orders remained royal orders. They\r\nwere again and again referred to in this way.\r\n\r\n[365] P.I.R., Books C-1.\r\n\r\n[366] P.I.R., 1216. 1.\r\n\r\n[367] P.I.R., 1216. 1.\r\n\r\n[368] P.I.R., 223.\r\n\r\n[369] P.I.R. 1133. 1.\r\n\r\n[370] P.I.R., 1137. 4.\r\n\r\n[371] _Ibid.,_ R., 1165. 2.\r\n\r\n[372] P.I.R., 319. 1.\r\n\r\n[373] _Ibid.,_ 3. 33.\r\n\r\n[374] _Ibid.,_ 1022. 3.\r\n\r\n[375] P.I.R., 1200.\r\n\r\n[376] P.I.R., 907. 6.\r\n\r\n[377] P.I.R., 39. 7.\r\n\r\n[378] The following memorandum to accompany a letter from Señor Don\r\nSixto Lopez, Secretary of Señor Don Felipe Agoncillo, to the Honorable\r\nthe Secretary of State, written January 5, 1899, clearly sets forth\r\nthis claim:--\r\n\r\n\"Pursuant to the action of said congress a detailed system of\r\ngovernment has been provided for and is actually maintained in all the\r\nportions of the Philippine Islands, except so much of the provinces of\r\nManila and Cavite as is now in the actual possession of the American\r\nArmy, such excepted part containing only about 3 per cent. of the\r\npopulation of the entire islands and an infinitely smaller proportion\r\nof their area.\r\n\r\n\"From the foregoing it will appear that the Philippine government is\r\nnow, as it has been practically ever since the 16th of June, 1898,\r\nin substantially full possession of the territory of the people it\r\nrepresents.\"--Taylor Ex. 530 57 KU., Congressional Record, June 3,\r\n1902, Vol. 35, part 6, p. 6217.\r\n\r\n[379] Blount, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[380] \"September, 1898.\r\n\r\n\"_Decree_\r\n\r\n\"Although article 11, Chapter 2, of the Organic Decree of June\r\n23 (1898) last, prescribes that the appointment of provisional\r\nrepresentatives of Congress be given to persons who have been born\r\nor have resided in the provinces which they are to represent; taking\r\ninto consideration the urgent necessity that said body enter upon\r\nits functions immediately, I hereby decree the following:--\r\n\r\n\"1.

It suffered the same fate as the proclamation\r\nof January 4, set out in pages 113 and 114 of this report, but it\r\nproduced a marked beneficial influence on the people, especially those\r\noutside our lines, as it carried with it a conviction of the United\r\nStates' intentions, on account of the source from which it emanated,\r\nit being an expression from a committee of gentlemen especially\r\nappointed to proclaim the policy which the United States would pursue.\"\r\n\r\n--_Taylor_, 90 AJ.\r\n\r\nTaylor adds: \"The commander of one of the regiments of sandatahan in\r\nManila reported that he had forced the people of the city to destroy\r\nthe proclamations issued by the commission (P.I.R., 73. 9).
