He was probably the son of Joseph\r\nHorton, of Leicestershire, England, and born in the little hamlet of\r\nMousely of that shire. Of his history before he came to America very\r\nlittle is known. He came over in the ship \"_Swallow_\" in 1633-38.\r\nHe landed at Hampton, Mass. How long he remained at Hampton is not\r\nknown. But in 1640 we find him with his wife and two children in New\r\nHaven, Conn., in company with the Rev. John Youngs, William Welles,\r\nEsq., Peter Hallock, John Tuthill, Richard Terry, Thomas Mapes,\r\nMatthias Corwin, Robert Ackerly, Jacob Corey, John Conklin, Isaac\r\nArnold, and John Budd, and on the 21st day of Oct., 1640, assisted\r\nby the venerable Rev. John Davenport and Gov. Eaton, they organized\r\nthemselves into a Congregational Church, and sailed to the east end\r\nof Long Island, now Southold. They had all been members of Puritan\r\nchurches in England, and all had families with them except Peter\r\nHallock. They doubtless had been on the island previous to this time\r\nand looked out their homes. On nearing the shore they cast lots to\r\ndecide who should first set foot on the land. The lot fell on Peter\r\nHallock, and the place where he stepped upon the land has ever since\r\nbeen known as Hallock's Landing.\r\n\r\nOn coming ashore, they all knelt down and engaged in prayer, Peter\r\nHallock leading, as had been determined by the lot. These were the\r\nfirst persons of any civilized nation that had ever attempted to\r\nsettle on the east end of Long Island. _See Griffin's Journal._\r\n\r\nBarnabas Horton was a man of deep-toned piety, and a warm advocate\r\nof civil and religious freedom. He was one of the most prominent and\r\ninfluential men of Southold. He was for many years a magistrate, and\r\nseveral times a member of the General Court at New Haven and Harford.\r\nHe built the first framed dwelling-house ever erected on the east of\r\nLong Island, and that house is still (1875) standing and occupied. It\r\nis a shingle-house, that is, shingles are used for weather-boards,\r\nand the sides have never been reshingled, and the roof but once,\r\naccording to the statement of Jonathan Goldsmith Horton, the last\r\nHorton occupant of the old house.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Barnabas Horton I. was large in stature, and of a\r\nruddy complexion, and of fine social qualities.\r\n\r\nHis tombstone is of English blue marble, five feet long and about\r\nthree feet wide. It is placed horizontally over the grave. The stone\r\nwas re-lettered about fifty or sixty years ago by Jonathan G. Horton.\r\nIt is elevated about eighteen inches from the ground, on a good stone\r\nbase. The original base was of brick, but it had all crumbled down\r\nmany years ago. The present base was put under the stone at the time\r\nit was re-lettered by Jonathan G. Horton.\r\n\r\nThe inscription surrounds the border of the stone, and reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Here lieth buried the body of MR. BARNABAS HORTON, who was\r\n    born at Mousely, Leicestershire, Old England, and died at\r\n    Southold, on the 13th day of July, 1680, aged 80 years.\"\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the stone we find the Epitaph, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Here lies my body tombed in dust\r\n      'Till Christ shall come to raise it with the just;\r\n      My soul ascended to the throne of God,\r\n      Where with sweet Jesus now I make abode:\r\n      Then hasten after me, my dearest wife,\r\n      To be partaker of this blessed life;\r\n      And you, dear children, all follow the Lord,\r\n      Hear and obey His public sacred word;\r\n      And in your houses call upon His name,\r\n      For oft I have advised you to the same:\r\n      Then God will bless you with your children all,\r\n      And to this blessed place He will you call.\"\r\n\r\n    Heb. xi: 4.--\"He being dead, yet speaketh.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that this epitaph was written by himself, and that it,\r\ntogether with the inscription, date of his death excepted, was\r\nall put upon the stone before he died. He was the only one of the\r\noriginal thirteen who brought his tombstone with him, and this fact\r\nseems to indicate a commendable desire to see that his name and\r\nmemory should not perish from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--We have followed _Griffin's Journal_ in relation to the\r\n    thirteen old Puritans who first settled in Southold. But C.\r\n    B. Moore, Esq., of New York City, who has been more thorough\r\n    and faithful than any other person, in studying the history\r\n    and genealogy of the early settlers of Southold--examining all\r\n    the _deeds_ and _wills_, and other authentic documents to be\r\n    found, and also copying the inscriptions from every headstone,\r\n    not only in Southold, but over nearly the whole Island--makes\r\n    it very evident that some of those named were not there at so\r\n    early a date, and he also says that _Peter_ Hallock, who is\r\n    named as one of the thirteen, was the grandson of the Puritan\r\n    Hallock who settled at Southold, and whose Christian name\r\n    was William. Mr. Moore is one of the best genealogists of\r\n    the country, and in relation to Long Island, he is the best\r\n    authority extant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the engraving that the old house is double. The\r\nwestern part is that which was built by Barnabas in 1659-60. The east\r\nor two-story part was built by Jonathan I., about 1682. The upper\r\nroom of this part was used for a court-house for nearly twenty years,\r\nas we learn from Thompson's History of Long Island, and some of the\r\nold benches used when it was a court-house are still preserved. The\r\nold \"castle,\" as Jonathan G. Horton, its last Horton occupant, used\r\nto call it, is in all probability the oldest wood house in America. I\r\nknow of no dwelling-house of any kind, stone or brick, now standing,\r\nthat can date back as far as this venerable old mansion. There were\r\na few huts on the east of Long Island previous to 1640--two or three\r\nit is said on Shelter Island. But these, as well as those built by\r\nthe Puritans, immediately on their settlement in Southold, soon all\r\npassed away. Not a vestige of any of the first generation buildings\r\ncan be found except this one. It remained for the house that Barnabas\r\nbuilt to survive the wreck of ages, and to stand to-day as a noble\r\nrepresentative of the dwellings of two hundred and fifteen years ago.\r\nBut the old house stands to-day not only as peering above all others\r\nby its age, but also by its occupancy. It is not very often that\r\nwe find two generations of the same name, living and dying in the\r\nsame house--rarely find three. But here we have six generations in\r\nsuccession, all bearing the Horton name, living and dying in the same\r\nhouse, and all born in it except Barnabas I., and his son Jonathan.\r\nWe may go to the castles and palaces of the old world, and search\r\nlong and diligently, and fail to find a parallel case.\r\n\r\nWith a few repairs, the old castle may yet stand for generations far\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nIt requires some thought and reflection to realize the lapse of time\r\nsince the old house was built. See the old Puritan himself there\r\ntwenty years; then his son Jonathan, twenty-eight years; and then\r\nJonathan, Jr., about sixty years; and next Lawrence and _his_ son\r\nJonathan over a half a century; and lastly Jonathan G. Horton, about\r\na half a century; making in all two hundred and thirteen years at the\r\ndeath of Jonathan G. Horton, 3 July, 1873. These six generations all\r\nliving and dying in the old mansion! Could those old walls re-echo\r\nall the words ever spoken there, and exhibit anew all the scenes\r\never witnessed there--the book containing such a record would vastly\r\nexceed in volume the size of the old castle. It would bring to light\r\nmuch that is now in darkness, and must forever remain hidden from the\r\ngenerations of the living.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Jonathan G. Horton, the old homestead became, by\r\nwill, the property of the Rev. Mrs. Williams, of Brooklyn, N. Y., who\r\nwas the adopted daughter of Jonathan G. Horton, he never having had\r\nissue, so that on the 3d of July, 1873, the old homestead went out of\r\nthe Horton name.\r\n\r\nMrs. Williams proposes to sell it, and if some of the Hortons do\r\nnot buy it, it will indicate a lack of decent respect for the old\r\ncastle, if not for the Horton name. It should be bought back into\r\nthe Horton name, suitably repaired and preserved for the wonder and\r\nadmiration of generations of Hortons yet unborn. Jonathan G. Horton,\r\nthe short, thick man, and Stuart T. Terry, are the two men seen in\r\nthe engraving, in front of the old house.\r\n\r\nMr. Stuart T. Terry, of Southold, L. I., has kindly copied and\r\nforwarded to me, many interesting facts from the New Haven Colonial\r\nRecords, some of which are here inserted:\r\n\r\n    \"Concerning some farmers neere Southold, at a place called\r\n    Hashamamock, aboute whom BARNABAS HORTON, one of ye Constables\r\n    last yeare, which was 1656, also, Constable in 1659. 29\r\n    May, 1661, Barnabas Horton was a Deputy to the New Haven\r\n    Court--also, 31 May, 1654, the Deputies from Southold,\r\n    presented to ye court a wrighting from their towne, wherein\r\n    it is desired that BARNABAS HORTON and JOHN PEAKEN, the two\r\n    present Deputies of Southold, may be chosen Constables for\r\n    that plantation; which was done. Barnabas Horton was a Deputy\r\n    to the Court in New Haven, in 1654-'56-'58-'59 and 1661. In\r\n    1655 there was no election, but he wrote a letter to the\r\n    Court on public affairs. In 1662 he was admitted a Freeman of\r\n    Connecticut Colony, at Harford, and in 1663 and 1664 he was a\r\n    Deputy to the General Court, at Harford. He was a Magistrate in\r\n    1664, and until his death. He is one of the Patentees of the\r\n    Town of Southold in 1676.\" Made his will May 10, 1680. Died 13\r\n    July, 1680. Will proved. Lib. 2, N. Y., p. 54.--_Vide \"Moore's\r\n    Indexes of Southold.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD BIBLE.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting relic left by our good old ancestor,\r\nBarnabas, is the OLD BIBLE, which he brought with him from England.\r\nIt is now in the possession of the Hon. Silas Horton, of Southold. It\r\nwas taken to the Bible House, New York, some years ago, and carefully\r\nrepaired, and every torn leaf mended, so that it is now entire, and\r\nin a good condition.\r\n\r\nWe find in it the following record:\r\n\r\n  \"Imprinted at London, by the Deputies of Christian Barker.\"\r\n\r\n  _Printer to the Queen's Most Excellent Majestie, 1597._\r\n\r\n  CUM PRIVILEGIO.\r\n\r\nThen follows in manuscript:\r\n\r\n    \"Barnabas Horton, to his son Jonathan Horton, this BIBLE he did\r\n    bequeath, in the year of our Lord, 1680.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Capt. Jonathan Horton, his _Book_. _God give him grace._\r\n    Jonathan Horton, 1683.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place, and probably in the handwriting of Jonathan Horton,\r\nJr., we find:\r\n\r\n    \"_The Word of the Lord God of Jonathan Horton, 1748-'49._\"\r\n\r\nAgain we find:\r\n\r\n    \"Lydia Tuthill, her _Book_, given her by her mother, as it is\r\n    said.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Feb. 8, in the year 1742, then Jonathan Tuthill departed this\r\n    life--the son of Henry Tuthill and Bethia (Horton) Tuthill.\r\n    Susanna Tuthill, wife of Jonathan Tuthill, departed this life\r\n    May 16, in the year 1743, in the 50th year of her age. Henry\r\n    Tuthill, departed this life the 4th day of January, in the year\r\n    1750, aged 84. Bethia Tuthill, wife of Henry Tuthill, departed\r\n    this life March 16th, 1744, in the 73d year of her age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MUSKET, CASK, AND WALKING STAFF.\r\n\r\n_The old wood hooks_ are still attached to the big beam of the old\r\nhouse, upon which Barnabas used to hang his OLD MUSKET, which was\r\ncalled \"uncle Barney's _quart pot_.\" He brought it with him from\r\nEngland. It is now in the possession of Barnabas B. Horton, of\r\nSouthold. It is still a long old gun, though not as long as it was\r\nonce, as it was bursted by overloading on one Thanksgiving Day, and\r\nabout eight or ten inches of the muzzle cut off.\r\n\r\nThe CASK, in which he packed a portion of his household goods, and\r\nbrought over with him, is still in existence, and is owned by Gilbert\r\nW. Horton, of Bay View, Southold. It is doubly historic from the fact\r\nthat when the British invaded Long Island it was filled with wheat\r\nand buried, thus securing the wheat from the foraging parties of the\r\nBritish army. It is made of solid oak--hoops and all--the hoops are\r\nsquare and about an inch and a quarter thick--only one hoop missing.\r\nIt is used for a grain cask, and will hold about fifteen bushels. It\r\nwas formerly called \"uncle Barney's money barrel,\" as romance had it,\r\nthat he brought it over full of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nHis WALKING STAFF is still preserved. It is made of the Yew tree\r\nwood, has a fine ivory head with the letters \"J. H.\" and the figures\r\n\"1617\" in apparently golden specks indented into it, from which\r\nit would seem that it once belonged to his father, and that J. H.\r\n(Joseph Horton) were his initials. It is now owned by Silas R.\r\nHorton, of Goshen, N. Y.\r\n\r\nMany other mementos of the old Puritan are in existence, some of them\r\nin the Long Island Historical Rooms, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORTON NAME--FIRST SETTLERS IN THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe word Horton in the Anglo-Saxon language means an enclosure, or\r\ngarden of vegetables. It is said to be derived from _ort_ and _tun_,\r\n_ort_, meaning plant, and _tun_, enclosed. The name is evidently of\r\nLatin origin, and has been known in England ever since the conquest\r\nof Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe Hortons in England, and their descendants in America, have\r\ngenerally been cultivators of the soil. They have been found almost\r\nuniversally in the middle class of society, and it is not known that\r\nany royal blood has ever coursed in their veins. They are, and always\r\nhave been, _producers_ rather than _consumers_, and for industry,\r\nintegrity, and piety, they will lose nothing in a comparison with the\r\nrenowned families of either the new or the old world.\r\n\r\nThe first of the family who emigrated to this country, of whom we\r\nhave any authentic record, came over from England 1633 to 1638.\r\nThomas, Jeremiah, and Barnabas, were among the early emigrants, and\r\nold tradition says they were brothers. Thomas came over in the \"_Mary\r\nand John_,\" in 1633, settled permanently in Springfield, Mass.\r\nJeremiah also settled in Massachusetts. There was a John Horton in\r\nNew York, in 1645, but no one has been found claiming descent from\r\nhim. He probably returned to England.\r\n\r\nIt is not known from what place in England either Thomas or Jeremiah\r\ncame, nor is there any certain evidence that they were brothers of\r\nBarnabas, but the three coming over about the same time would favor\r\nthe tradition that they were brothers.\r\n\r\nThe Head Quarters of Cæsar's army was near the present _Leicester_,\r\nthe principal town of that county, and the Horton name has been\r\nknown there to the remotest period of any authentic records. This\r\nfact, together with the name itself, favors the idea that the family\r\nwas of Roman origin. The name in olden time was frequently written\r\nOrton, and it is highly probable, that the Ortons and Hortons were\r\noriginally from the same family, and perhaps also the Nortons.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF THE HORTON FAMILY.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the Horton Family is established by the fact, that\r\none Robert De Horton, manumitted a bondman to his manor of Horton,\r\nlong before the time of Henry Larey, Earl of Lincoln, who died in\r\n1310. It is also ascertained that the Hortons had a manor-house\r\nin Great Horton, with a mill and certain demesne lands therewith\r\nbelonging, at a very remote period.\r\n\r\nWilliam Horton, Esq., of Frith House, in Barksland, Halifax,\r\ndescended from the above-mentioned Robert, married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Hanson, Esq., of Toothill, had issue and died\r\nabout 1640, viz.:\r\n\r\n    1. William, of Barkisland, or Bark Island Hall, who purchased\r\n    in the 15th of Charles I., the estate of Howroyde, was born\r\n    about 1576.\r\n\r\n    2. Joseph, born about 1578.--_Burke's Landed Gentry, vol. 1, p.\r\n    345._\r\n\r\nIt is held that this Joseph settled in Mousely, Leicester Co.,\r\nand was the father of Barnabas Horton. It is highly probable that\r\nBarnabas was not the oldest son, and not inheriting real estate, may\r\nhave been one reason for his emigrating to America.\r\n\r\nIt is known that Capt. Jeremy Horton, 18 Aug., 1626, was the master\r\nand owner of the ship \"_Swallow_,\" of Barnstable, and that he made\r\nvoyages to New England, in 1633 and 1638, and in a subsequent voyage\r\nhe was shipwrecked and several lives lost--the crew and master came\r\nto Boston, but the vessel was lost.\r\n\r\nCapt. Roger Horton, about this time, had a prisoner delivered to\r\nhim, from the White Line Prison, to be transported into parts beyond\r\nthe seas, to serve in the wars of his majesty's plantations.\r\n\r\nTradition says that Barnabas Horton and family came over in the\r\n\"_Swallow_,\" in 1638, or perhaps earlier, but I have not found his\r\nname on any of the lists of emigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL NAME OF SOUTHOLD.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians called Southold,[1] 'Yennycock.' Mr. John Youngs,\r\nwho had been a minister at Hingham, England, came over with a\r\nconsiderable part of his church, and here fixed his residence. He\r\ngathered his church anew on the 21 Oct., 1640, and the planters\r\nunited themselves with New Haven. However, they soon departed from\r\nthe rule of appointing none to office, or of admitting none to be\r\nfreemen, but members of the church. New Haven insisted on this as a\r\nfundamental article of the constitution. They were, therefore, for\r\na number of years, obliged to conform to the law of jurisdiction.\r\nSome of the principal men were: Rev. Mr. Youngs, Mr. William Wells,\r\nMr. Barnabas Horton, Thomas Mapes, John Tuthill, and Matthias\r\nCorwin.\"--_Trumbull's History of Connecticut._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDocumentary History of New York, vol. ii., p. 439. \"Rate-Lists of\r\nLong Island, 1675, 1676, and 1683,\" page 447, Southold's Estimate, 16\r\nSept., 1675, p. 451:\r\n\r\n    _Barnabas Horton_, 2 heads (men? voters?), rated at £18 each;\r\n    37 acors land £37; 9 oxen, £54; 8 cows, at £40; 4 three\r\n    year-olds, £16; 4 two year-olds, £10; 4 yerlings, £6; 69 shepe,\r\n    £23; 6 horses, £72; 1 yerling (colt), £3; 8 swine, £8.

We commence\r\nwith the Christian name. Then follows the parentage, genealogical\r\ndata, &c., and then the Christian names of the children and order\r\nof births. In many of the early families the exact order of births\r\ncannot be ascertained; but it has been approximated as nearly as\r\npossible. The lineage is given in connection with the first member of\r\nthe family. The Roman numerals indicate the order of births. The sons\r\nand daughters of the old Puritan, Barnabas, constitute the second\r\ngeneration, but they are spoken by way of eminence as Joseph I.,\r\nHannah I., &c. The book contains much repetition, but none too much\r\nto make it plain and easy to study.\r\n\r\nThis little book contains the chronicles of only about one-half of\r\nthe Horton families looked up. Those whose genealogical data are\r\ngiven only in a small part, and those whose correct lineage has not\r\nbeen satisfactorily ascertained, are not included in this book.\r\n\r\nThis book is mainly what those who have kindly furnished records\r\nand sketches have made it. The whole has been carefully compiled.\r\nBut genealogical works, almost of necessity, contain many errors.\r\nDoubtless this small work has its full share. But when errors are\r\ndiscovered, notice thereof should be given, so that a second edition\r\nmay be made entirely truthful. Thankful to all who have generously\r\ngiven their assistance, this work is sent out as a small contribution\r\nto the genealogical literature of the day, and in the hope that a\r\nmore full and extensive book of Horton chronicles may be issued at no\r\nvery distant day.\r\n\r\n_Terrytown, 10 Jan., 1876._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Generation.--Barnabas I._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

He was a\r\ntanner and currier by trade, and he tanned the first leather that was\r\never manufactured in Delaware Co. He purchased large tracts of lands,\r\nbuilt saw-mills and grist-mills, and carried on a large business in\r\nthe manufacture and sale of lumber and provisions, as well as of\r\nleather.

The snow fell in April, after\r\n    they moved, about two feet deep. He had a large stock of cows,\r\n    sheep and hogs. In his flock of sheep were twenty-two ewes,\r\n    the finest that could be found in Colchester, nearly all of\r\n    them only two years old. He drove them to Liberty. Wolves\r\n    were seen on the way near Parkesville. He arrived at Liberty\r\n    Falls--salted his sheep in the evening. The next morning the\r\n    sheep were gone, and Isaac and his son Roy, went up the hill\r\n    at Liberty Falls to look for them. Before they got beyond the\r\n    clearing they found dead sheep scattered along the log fence,\r\n    and others dying. Nearly all the flock were killed. They even\r\n    killed a lamb in the pen adjoining the house.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1837, Isaac Horton had thirty-seven grandchildren, all\r\n    living but two. His children all lived to maturity.\"--(_Letter\r\n    G. B. Horton, 1871._)\r\n\r\nIsaac Horton was a member of the Baptist Church, of Colchester; but\r\nafter he moved to Liberty, Sullivan Co., N. Y., he usually attended\r\nthe Episcopal Church. He built a grist-mill at Liberty Falls, in 1827\r\nor 1828, another in 1841-42. He was quite extensively engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of bed-posts and other turned work, including wooden\r\nbowls; also in shipping curled and birds-eye maple. Politically he\r\nwas a whig, and an ardent supporter of Clay and Webster. He died 10\r\nMay, 1855. She is still living.\r\n\r\nUnder date of 8 February, 1874, Webb Horton writes, \"My mother is\r\nliving and in good health. She resides at Liberty, Sullivan Co.,\r\nN. Y. She is in the eighty-seventh year of her age. Her father\r\ndied aged eighty-eight, and her grandmother, Prudence Schofield,\r\naged ninety-four. She has now living ten children, thirty-seven\r\ngrandchildren, and nineteen great-grandchildren.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very remarkable family--so large and yet so few deaths.\r\nIt is a rare occurrence to find a family of children, ten in number,\r\nthe youngest forty-six years old, _all living_. And then so many\r\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren living. I have no record of any\r\nfamily equal to it, and doubtless, the number is now (1875), somewhat\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

Frost Horton is a retired manufacturer, and resides at\r\nPeekskill. He has always been a prominent man in the community,\r\nenjoying in a high degree the confidence and respect of his fellow\r\ncitizens. He possesses fine social qualities, and, since retiring\r\nfrom business, he occasionally amuses himself in hunting and fishing.\r\nHis integrity, industry and great business capacities, during the\r\nactive part of his life, rendered him a most valuable acquisition to\r\nthe community in which he carried on his business, and the articles\r\nhe manufactured were of sterling value to the farming interests of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton, on sending me his photograph for an engraving,\r\naccompanied it with the following very modest and unassuming sketch\r\nof his life:\r\n\r\n    \"I was born in Yorktown, Westchester County, New York,\r\n    15 September, 1806. My parents were farmers, in moderate\r\n    circumstances. I remained with them until I was seventeen,\r\n    working on the farm in the summer, and going to school in the\r\n    winter, thus acquiring merely a common-school education. When\r\n    I was seventeen years old, at the suggestion of my parents,\r\n    I decided to learn the blacksmith trade, and commenced the\r\n    business at once, and served an apprenticeship for several\r\n    years. On the 17th of October, 1827, I married Phebe Tompkins,\r\n    and on the 9th of March, 1820, we moved to Peekskill village,\r\n    where we have resided ever since. I bought some property,\r\n    and set up the blacksmithing business. I succeeded well\r\n    in the business. In the spring of 1835 I entered into a\r\n    co-partnership business with Mr. Truman Minor, under the firm\r\n    name of 'Minor & Horton,' and went into the foundry business,\r\n    manufacturing agricultural implements, principally ploughs and\r\n    plough-castings. Our business increased rapidly, and paid us\r\n    well. We continued partners for twenty years. In 1855 Mr. Minor\r\n    retired from business, and I took in Mr. Geo. W. Depeu as a\r\n    partner, and about two years afterwards, we admitted each of us\r\n    a son, and the firm then became, 'Horton, Depeu & Sons.' Our\r\n    manufactured articles were sold in nearly every State in the\r\n    Union, and also in many foreign countries.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1862 we all sold out to a stock company, formed for that\r\n    purpose. Having been in active business for thirty years, I now\r\n    retired. In the spring of 1855 I was elected Supervisor of the\r\n    town of Cortlandt, and I represented that town in the Board of\r\n    Supervisors for five years in succession.\r\n\r\n    \"In the winter of 1858, I was a member of the Legislature from\r\n    this Assembly District. For many years I held the various\r\n    offices of our village, but of late have declined official\r\n    stations, preferring the enjoyments of private life.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Horton is not a public professor of Christianity, but is a\r\ngentleman of correct moral deportment, and very temperate in his\r\nhabits. Mrs. Horton is an amiable lady, and a valued member of the\r\nPresbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frost Horton]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.

Mr. Westbrook, to DELIA CLAPP,\r\ndaughter of Philip Clapp and ---- Ferris. They had one child, Emma,\r\nborn at Peekskill in 1842, died in 1856. He was a lawyer, very\r\nindustrious and ambitious, and died 5 March, 1842, probably from\r\napplying himself too closely to his profession and overtasking his\r\nmental powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. WILLIAM CLEMENTS, son of Wright Horton and Ann Quereau, born at\r\nYorktown, 9 January, 1811; married 29 August, 1832, at Yorktown, by\r\nThomas Tompkins, Esq., to PHEBE MCKEEL, daughter of Moses McKeel.

He is a Deacon in the\r\nBaptist Church, embraced religion in early life, has always been a\r\nprominent man, and commanded the respect and esteem of all who knew\r\nhim. He went to Jefferson County, New York, in his infancy, and in\r\n1826 he purchased land at Adams Centre, and became a well-to-do\r\nfarmer, exerting a salutary influence in the community, being active\r\nin the moral and religious enterprises of the day; he resided there\r\nuntil after the death of his wife, when he went to Troy, New York,\r\nwhere he now (1874) resides.\r\n\r\nChildren, all born at Adams Centre:\r\n\r\n    1.

Horton]\r\n\r\nThe following auto-biographical sketch of Dea. John W. Horton,\r\ncontained in one of his letters, is interesting and well worth\r\npreserving:\r\n\r\n    \"I was born in the town of Colchester, Delaware County, New\r\n    York, on the 12th of October, 1802. When a little over three\r\n    years old, my father moved to Lyme, Jefferson County, New York,\r\n    which was then known as the Black River Country, and settled on\r\n    the shore of Chaumont Bay, at the east end of Lake Ontario. It\r\n    was here I spent my childhood and my boyhood days, learning, as\r\n    I grew up, how to endure the privations of a pioneer life in a\r\n    northern wilderness. At the age of nine years I began to know\r\n    what manual labor meant, working on the farm in the summer, and\r\n    going to school in the winter. In those days our school-houses\r\n    were frequently some old log house, which some settler had\r\n    built and then vacated, and perhaps left the country, or moved\r\n    into better quarters. Such school-houses were splendid for\r\n    hot weather, being so well ventilated; but in the winter they\r\n    required piles of wood and great physical endurance to keep\r\n    warm. My facilities for acquiring an education were exceedingly\r\n    limited. Being the eldest of eight children, perhaps I had to\r\n    take a little more of the rough end of life than some of the\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    \"At the commencement of my seventeenth year, my father\r\n    commenced preparing for building a new house, and I then gave\r\n    up going to school, and worked through the winter at quarrying\r\n    stone and getting lumber for the new house. The house was\r\n    commenced in the spring and completed before fall, myself and\r\n    younger brother carrying the stone and mixing the mortar.\r\n\r\n    \"I remained with my father until I was twenty-four years old. I\r\n    then went for myself. I purchased land, and settled permanently\r\n    at Adams Centre, after my marriage. In December, 1829, myself\r\n    and wife connected ourselves with the Baptist Church, at the\r\n    State Road, Jefferson County, New York.\r\n\r\n    \"We were blessed with four daughters--all grew up to womanhood,\r\n    married, made a public profession of religion, and became\r\n    members of the Baptist Church. We occupied our old home until\r\n    the 13th of December, 1872, when death removed my dear wife\r\n    from this world of care, pain and suffering to the mansions of\r\n    everlasting rest, as I humbly trust.\r\n\r\n    \"The next April I sold my farm, and I am now spending the few\r\n    remaining days of my life with my three surviving daughters,\r\n    by whose affectionate care and tenderness I am made quite\r\n    contented and happy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.

His love for his country overrode all\r\n    personal considerations, and he was often heard to say, that\r\n    the life of a civilian had no attractions for him while armed\r\n    traitors refused to acknowledge the laws and its institutions\r\n    typified by the Stars and Stripes. He loved his friends and\r\n    home, but he loved his country more, and he was willing to bid\r\n    adieu to father and mother, brothers and sisters, and go into\r\n    the foremost rank of those who were battling for the right, and\r\n    he battled nobly, and fell at last a martyr for his country's\r\n    freedom. He died in Millon Prison, Ga., aged 23 years and 10\r\n    months.\"--_Extract of Letter of Andrew Horton._\r\n\r\n    5. Willie Gaylord, born 15 May, 1843; died 30 January, 1849.\r\n\r\n    6.

Horton was a farmer, and occasionally a hunter, \"frequently\r\ntaking his rifle,\" as he says, and going into the woods not far\r\nfrom his house, he would knock down a deer or two and return home\r\nby breakfast time. One morning in June, some forty years ago, he\r\ntook his gun and went out into the woods, about half a mile from his\r\nhouse, when a fine buck appeared before him and down he went. While\r\nreloading his gun he heard a wolf howl, and going a little further he\r\nbrought him down also. On returning to the place where he shot the\r\nbuck, behold, a huge panther had taken possession of the buck, and\r\nwas regaling himself by licking up the blood and preparing to feast\r\nupon the carcass. He stood still for some minutes, looking at the\r\npanther, thinking it rather cruel to kill him before he had a chance\r\nto take his fill of his much coveted food. But at length the panther\r\nsaw him and showed signs of fight, and he then put a ball through his\r\nbrain. On going home for his team, he found he had been gone only a\r\nlittle over an hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton took up land in a dense wilderness, several miles from any\r\ninhabitant, cleared it up, and then bought several other farms and\r\nassisted in clearing them up.

G. Ingraham, of the Episcopal Church, to\r\nHELEN ELIZABETH BREED, daughter of A. O. T. Breed, Esq., and Margaret\r\nShields, both of Milwaukee, Wis., and born in Milwaukee, 20 Jan.,\r\n1842.

Olive Grant, born 10 June, 1864.\r\n\r\nMrs. Horton was a lady of education and refinement. She possessed an\r\nexcellent moral and religious character; was a worthy member of the\r\nSt. James Episcopal Church, of Milwaukee, in which she took a lively\r\ninterest, and was distinguished for her generosity--especially for\r\nher many deeds of benevolence to the suffering and the poor. She\r\nwas a kind and dutiful wife, a most tender and affectionate mother,\r\nand her early departure was deeply lamented, not only by her bosom\r\ncompanion and near relatives, but also by the community in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly\r\n\r\nH. L. Horton]\r\n\r\nHarry L. Horton's father was a well-to-do farmer, and Harry remained\r\nwith his parents and worked on the farm until he was seventeen years\r\nold. He received but a moderate common-school education, and, during\r\nhis school-boy days, he was noted for his activity and sagacity, and\r\nearly exhibited more than ordinary business capacity. At the age of\r\nseventeen he engaged as a clerk in the store of D. Brink & Son, at\r\nHorn Brook, Pa., and remained with them until they sold out to H. W.\r\nLangford & Co., and with them he continued his clerkship until they\r\nclosed business. Shortly after this, he was engaged for one year\r\nby O. D. Bartlett, Esq., of Towanda, Pa., as clerk in his store,\r\nand at the expiration of that time, he entered the store of Joseph\r\nPowell & Co., of Towanda, with whom he served as clerk until 1854.\r\nHe always gave good satisfaction to his employers. Having by his\r\nindustry and economy laid up a small sum of money, he decided to go\r\nWest, and leaving Bradford County in 1854, he traveled extensively\r\nin Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, until he neared the bottom\r\nof his purse, without locating or engaging in business anywhere. But\r\nat length, in 1856, he went to Milwaukee, and engaged in the produce\r\ncommission business, in which he was very successful. Here he seemed\r\nto be permanently settled. But after the death of his wife, his\r\nbusiness, which had been very remunerative, seemed to lose much of\r\nits interest, and in March, 1865, having closed up his business in\r\nMilwaukee, with about $15,000 in pocket, he went to New York City,\r\nand immediately engaged in the banking and broker business, in which\r\nhe has continued until the present time, conducting a large business,\r\nwhich, under the supervision of his keen eye and his assiduous\r\npersonal attention, he has made very lucrative. He now owns a fine\r\nproperty on Staten Island, and, though he lost largely by the panic\r\nof 1873, he is still doing a fair business, and, to use his own\r\nlanguage, he \"has always managed to pay a hundred cents on the dollar\r\nand never _failed_.\"\r\n\r\nHe possesses excellent social qualities, is kind-hearted, generous\r\nand noble, and at his banking house, 56 Broadway, New York, or at\r\nhis island home, those who visit him will meet with such a frank\r\nand cordial reception as to make them feel that they are not only\r\nat home, but at the home of one whose words and deeds define the\r\ncharacter of a true gentleman.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton was married 2. in Trinity Chapel, N. Y., 12 October,\r\n1875, by the Rev. Dr. Weston, to Sara Patten, a lady of culture and\r\nrefinement of the city of New York, and an esteemed member of the\r\nEpiscopal Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.

No children.\r\n\r\nHorace is a well-to-do farmer, owns a large farm about two miles from\r\nthe river, has a very pretty dwelling-house with slate roof, a good\r\nbarn and out-buildings. He is a prominent man in the township, rents\r\nhis farm and lives at ease. He inherited a part of the old homestead\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ELIZABETH, daughter of William B.

In the Autumn of 1771, he went to Newburgh\r\nwith a load of grain. On the way home, he was taken sick, succeeded\r\nin getting home, but died in a day or two after. About 1782, his\r\nwidow married Parshall Terry, formerly of Southold. He was a widower,\r\nwas living with his family in Wyoming Valley in 1778. He and his\r\nfamily were in the famed Forty Fort the night after the Indian battle\r\nand massacre. The next morning they fled to the mountains and after\r\nsuffering great hardships, crossing the \"big swamp,\" afterwards\r\nknown as \"Swamp Dismal,\" or the \"Shades of Death,\" they reached\r\nStroudsburg, Pa., in safety. Leaving his family here, he hastened\r\nto Orange Co., N. Y., for assistance. During his absence his wife\r\nwas taken sick with \"camp distemper\" (malignant dysentery), and died\r\nleaving a large family of children, the youngest but three years old.\r\n\r\nHe took his family to Little Britain, Orange Co., N. Y., and as\r\nabove-stated, married the widow Horton. The two families, all told,\r\nnumbering twenty-two persons. The house in which they lived being an\r\nold-fashioned double log-house, they hired a school-master and made\r\none part of it a school-house, thus evincing a laudable determination\r\nto have the education of their household properly cared for. The\r\nwriter obtained these facts in 1828, from Benjamin Horton, son of\r\nIsrael, who was one of the pupils. But this arrangement was not of\r\nlong continuance, for in 1786, Sarah, the mother and step-mother\r\ndied, and was buried by her first husband in Warwick Cemetery.\r\n\r\nIsrael Horton had children as follows, the first four born in\r\nSouthold, the rest in Goshen, Orange Co.:\r\n\r\n    1.

Their children were\r\ntrained up to love and fear the Lord and keep his commandments.\r\nHe was a soldier in the old French war, and, in 1758, bearing the\r\ncommission of Lieutenant, he had charge of Fort Stanwix, N. Y., and\r\nremained there until the close of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. JONATHAN, son of Jonathan Horton and Elizabeth Goldsmith, born at\r\nCutchogue, L.

He was one of\r\nthe signers for the Pledge for Independence, in 1775.--_Vide \"History\r\nof Orange County,\" page 499._\r\n\r\nChildren, probably born in Orange County:\r\n\r\n    1.

Y., and was appointed Postmaster,\r\nat the first town meeting of that town, in 1811. Some of his\r\nposterity are living in that part of the country yet, and some are\r\nburied in East Palmyra Cemetery, Wayne Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sixth Generation.--Caleb I._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

We here re-produce a portion of his obituary, which appeared\r\nin the Presbyterian, of Philadelphia, shortly after his decease:\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Horton has been for forty years the indefatigable and\r\n    successful Tract Missionary of the Seventh Ward, New York\r\n    City. When he first assumed the important task of laboring\r\n    for the spiritual interests of this portion of the city, it\r\n    was known as one of the most wicked and wretched wards. The\r\n    'Sailor Boarding-houses' of olden times, with their numerous\r\n    'land-sharks,' and temptations to sinful indulgence, swarmed\r\n    here.... In process of time, the greater part of this territory\r\n    was occupied by dwellings of opulent merchants. Then after\r\n    another period of years, a new generation found the older\r\n    inhabitants of the Seventh Ward crowded out, and their former\r\n    homes became filled with a population of the dregs of old\r\n    country emigrants, or gave place to shops and manufactories.\r\n    Mr. Horton adapted himself and modified his work to meet\r\n    these successive changes, and calling to his help a faithful\r\n    band of distributors, teachers and visitors, made a Christian\r\n    influence to be felt, increasing its power by every available\r\n    means. A great multitude of conversions from year to year were\r\n    the result of his faithful labors. Admonished by the approach\r\n    of old age, he resigned his position as missionary, made all\r\n    arrangements as to his worldly affairs, wrote farewell letters,\r\n    and quietly looked forward to the close of his earthly career.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seventh Generation.--Caleb I._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

He was an upright and\r\n    conscientious man, and largely shared the esteem of all who\r\n    knew him. He was a most sincere and ardent Universalist, living\r\n    the life of the Christian, and dying in the full and perfect\r\n    triumph of Gospel faith and hope. He and his wife were, for\r\n    many years, members of the Congregational Church of Chester;\r\n    but about thirty years before his death, he and his wife\r\n    embraced Universalism, and avowed it openly ever afterwards.\r\n    Nevertheless, they continued to support the church and worship\r\n    within its walls, and we hazard nothing in saying that there\r\n    was no man in Chester, nor in all the region round about it,\r\n    who was more generally and highly respected for manly and\r\n    Christian character than Hiram Horton. Some time before his\r\n    death he had requested that a minister of the Universalist\r\n    denomination should attend his funeral services; but the pastor\r\n    of the church, the Rev. Luke I. Stoutenberg, and others,\r\n    refused to let them into the church, notwithstanding that the\r\n    salary of that preacher was paid in part by the 'Horton Fund,'\r\n    and the church itself had been built mainly by the Hortons.\r\n    His funeral had to be attended in the Presbyterian Church,\r\n    the Presbyterians generously offering them the use of their\r\n    church.\"--_Obituary of Hiram Horton._\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.

Horton possessed more than an ordinary fund of cheerfulness\r\nand joviality; and his humorous and genial nature was an\r\nunfailing source of interest and life in the family and in the\r\nsocial circle. He was a careful business man. Though long engaged\r\nin mercantile pursuits, he never had occasion to fear financial\r\ncrises or revulsions, living always prepared at any moment to honor\r\nhis pecuniary obligations. Punctuality and promptness were marked\r\ncharacteristics of the man. To perform was more pleasing to him than\r\nto promise; in enterprises for the public good he was always among\r\nthe first. He was constable for many years, Justice of the Peace\r\nfor five years, and declined a re-election; was Treasurer of the\r\nCounty for two years, and was one of the electors on the Democratic\r\nelectoral ticket in 1848. He was Captain and then Major in the\r\nmilitia, and from 1828 to 1835 Brigade Inspector.\r\n\r\nThough not a public professor of Christianity, he was its friend and\r\nsupporter, and conscientiously and habitually practised its virtues.\r\nHe was uniformly in attendance upon public worship, and paid more\r\nmoney for the Terrytown Tabernacle (Union meeting-house) than any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\nHe was popular and pleasing in his manners, and politically a man of\r\nmark, but never a _politician_--holding office only when the office\r\nsought him. His end was quiet and peaceful.\r\n\r\n      \"The 'Angel's Whisper' stole in song upon his closing ear;\r\n      From his own daughter's lips it came, so musical and clear,\r\n      That scarcely knew the dying man what melody was there:\r\n      The last of earth's or first of heaven's pervading all the air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV. EUNICE, daughter of Maj. John Horton and Deborah Terry, born at\r\nTerrytown, 14 Jan., 1796; married in the old log meeting-house at\r\nMerry All, Pa., 20 July, 1817, by Rev. Minor Manasseh York, to THOMAS\r\nINGHAM, ESQ., son of Joseph Ingham and Pamelia Ellicott, and born in\r\nBucks Co., Pa., 1 April, 1794. The ancestors of Thomas Ingham came\r\nfrom England. Jonas Ingham, the first known ancestor, came to this\r\ncountry about A. D. 1700. By trade he was a clothier. He married a\r\nCheshire woman, who often told her grandson that she landed on the\r\nground where the city of Philadelphia now stands before there was a\r\nhouse on it. They settled in Trenton, N. J., where their son Jonathan\r\nwas born, in 1709 or 1710. They also had three daughters. Jonathan\r\nIngham resided in Bucks County, at a place known as Ingham's Springs,\r\nwhere he owned a farm and woolen factory. He was a rigid Quaker. A\r\ncotemporary, who was well acquainted with him said, \"He did not\r\nbelong to the old aristocracy who governed Bucks County before the\r\nRevolution, but his position in life and high intelligence put him\r\nin their society.\" They made him a Justice of the Peace, a Judge of\r\nthe Court, and a member of the Assembly. He died in 1798 or 1799,\r\naged 89. He had 3 sons and 2 daughters. Jonas, his youngest son,\r\nwas born in 1746. He learned the business of a clothier. January 3,\r\n1771, he was married to Elizabeth Beaumont, and soon after leased his\r\nfather's fulling mill, and was running it when the Revolutionary war\r\ncommenced. When the contesting armies came near, he enlisted, and\r\nserved first as a Lieutenant and then as a Captain in the militia.\r\nHe was in service in 1777, and in the battle at Gulf Mills. In the\r\nearly part of the year 1778 he was taken with a fever and sent\r\nhome. He afterward purchased land and built a fulling mill near the\r\nDelaware River; he there lived some years and educated his children\r\nhimself. In 1789 he commenced a settlement on the Wyalusing Creek,\r\nbeing the first settler above Lewis', on that stream. He was an\r\ningenious mechanic, and invented the machine for shearing cloth,\r\nwhich afterwards came into general use. He was a good writer and\r\npublic speaker. In 1804 he was elected a member of the Legislature\r\nfrom Luzerne County. He died October 28, 1820. He had three sons and\r\nthree daughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thos. J. Ingham.]\r\n\r\nJoseph, his eldest son, was born January 21, 1773, and his father\r\ntaught him the common branches of education, including surveying\r\nand algebra. While his father was making his first improvements on\r\nthe Wyalusing, Joseph remained at home in Bucks County, in charge\r\nof the business. He learned the trade of a millwright. About the\r\nyear 1793 he married Pamelia Ellicott, and soon after bought three\r\nhundred acres of land on the Susquehanna River, at the mouth of the\r\nSugar Run. He moved his family to this place in 1795, and commenced\r\nbuilding a saw mill in the fall of 1801, and finished it in the\r\nspring following. Soon afterwards he built a grist mill. His wife,\r\nPamelia Ellicott, died 17 November, 1824. He afterwards married Laura\r\n(Whitcomb) Vose, a widow, by whom he had two sons. He had six sons\r\nby his first wife--no daughters. He died 11 June, 1829. Thomas, his\r\neldest son, was educated partly by his father at home and partly in\r\nthe common-school at Wyalusing. He learned his father's business of\r\nmillwright, running mills and farming. He bought a farm and settled\r\nfirst at Browntown, Pa. But he remained there but a short time, when\r\nhe sold out and came back to Sugar Run, and lived near his father.\r\nAfter the death of his father, he bought the homestead, and there\r\nlived until his death. He re-built the mills, and also erected a\r\nstore-house, and engaged in the mercantile business. While quite a\r\nyoung man he was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and held that\r\noffice during the most of his life. His mind was well informed on\r\nall general topics; his judgment was excellent, and he was noted for\r\nhis morality, honesty and truthfulness. He was mild and quiet in his\r\nmanners, but decided and firm in his purposes. Eunice, his wife, was\r\nhandsome in her appearance and pleasing in her manners, possessed a\r\nlively and cheerful disposition, and was exceedingly energetic. She\r\nmanaged all the affairs of her household with economy and skill, and\r\noften assisted her husband in his business. When he was absent she\r\ncould as readily manage the business out-doors as in the house. She\r\nwas remarkably generous, and always had a bountiful hand for the\r\npoor, and was active in assisting her neighbors who were in sickness\r\nor trouble. Without making a public profession, both she and her\r\nhusband exhibited the virtues of Christianity in her daily walk and\r\ncharacter. She died 2 March, 1844. He died 14 August, 1855. They were\r\nboth buried in the Terrytown Cemetery.\r\n\r\nChildren, all born in Asylum, now Wilmot, Pa.:\r\n\r\n    1.

He possessed good business capacities, and was a man of much\r\ninfluence and activity, of good, sound, moral character, and well\r\nread in the sacred Scriptures, and in sentiment a thorough Old School\r\nPresbyterian or Covenanter, but never made a public profession. He\r\nwas fond of company, and always took pains to make pleasant visits\r\nfor his friends when they called on him.\r\n\r\nSally was a good housekeeper--industrious, economizing and a\r\nskillful worker, often taking the premium at the County Fair\r\nfor domestic articles of her own manufacture. She possessed a\r\nwonderfully retentive memory--readily stating, not only incidents\r\nthat occurred at any time during her life, but also dates--dates of\r\nbirths, marriages and deaths of all her acquaintances, even from her\r\nearly childhood. She had a peculiar faculty of stating a fact or\r\ncircumstance so connected with others as to leave no doubt of its\r\ntruthfulness. She died in Wyalusing, 27 April, 1874, leaving to her\r\nfamily and friends the consoling belief that she exchanged the cares\r\nand sorrows of this mortal life for the full fruition of that world\r\n\r\n      \"Where fragrant flowers eternal bloom,\r\n          And joys supreme are given;\r\n      Where rays divine disperse the gloom,\r\n      Beyond the confines of the tomb,\r\n          The endless bliss of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Morrow died in Wyalusing, at the residence of his son-in-law,\r\nAndrew Fee, 10 August, 1873, where he had lain sick about four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M^{RS}.

Elijah Horton's present residence is Oswego, Kosciusko Co., Ia.\r\nIn a letter bearing date 23d Sept., 1874, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"You ask for a short biographical sketch. This I rather\r\n    decline, further than to say that my life has been devoted\r\n    to the judicial profession. I studied law in Morristown, N.\r\n    J., and practiced there until I removed to Alleghany Co., N.\r\n    Y., in 1832. I served as first Judge of the Court of Common\r\n    Pleas of that county for about ten years. Soon after moving\r\n    into the State of Indiana in 1844, I was appointed District\r\n    Judge, and I have served in that office, and also as a Justice\r\n    of the Peace ever since, until within a few weeks past when I\r\n    resigned. In looking over my past life, I see many things that\r\n    I would not do over again, with my past experience, especially\r\n    would I say long and loud, NO, instead of YES, as I often did.\r\n    Your letter brings to my mind views and opinions which I have\r\n    been learning and experiencing for many years of my past life.\r\n    Habits have grown upon me imperceptibly from my childhood. I\r\n    have old diaries written in my younger days, in which I find\r\n    recorded rules for my own conduct, the strict observance of\r\n    which, has caused me many miles of travel and hours of labor.\r\n    For illustration, I recall one or two: 'Have a place for\r\n    everything, and keep everything in its place' and 'Never put\r\n    off till to morrow what you can as well do to-day.' I began\r\n    life under such rules, and I have always been tyrannically\r\n    _ruled_ by them. If I forgot to do anything that I intended to\r\n    do through the day, and happened to think of it after I had\r\n    gone to bed, I could not sleep until I would get up and do it,\r\n    if possible, and if not possible there would be no sleep for me\r\n    that night. I have written this letter at one sitting and feel\r\n    pretty tired.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter contained about four pages foolscap, and it is no wonder\r\nthat he, now just entering his eightieth year, should feel tired.\r\nThe greater wonder is that he could write at all. It is written in a\r\nbold, plain hand, giving no indications of age.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

She came North by the advice of physicians, and at her\r\n    husband's request, as it was not considered safe for her to\r\n    remain there during the hot season. His mother writes: \"We\r\n    have passed through a great bereavement. Howell died the 18\r\n    Sept. last. He was taken sick on Sabbath with yellow fever,\r\n    and died the next Thursday, at eleven o'clock. Our hopes as to\r\n    this world are all blasted, but we trust that he is with his\r\n    Saviour, to whom he gave himself in his seventeenth year, and\r\n    from that time until his death, he lived a Christian. So we may\r\n    mourn not without hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:                                              |\r\n  | The following two entries for 'II.

Y., 7 Nov., 1797; married in 1821, HENRIETTA HICKS, daughter of\r\nJacob M. Hicks and Elizabeth ----, of Brooklyn, N. Y., and born in\r\n1804. (Jacob M. Hicks died in 1843, aged 94. His wife died in 1854,\r\naged 85.)\r\n\r\nChildren, probably all born in Brooklyn:\r\n\r\n    1. Maria Hicks Stringham, married William M. Richards.\r\n\r\n    2.

Elizabeth Wynkoop Stringham, married Com. J. B. Creighton,\r\n    being his 2d wife.\r\n\r\nSilas H. Stringham entered the navy in June, 1810, as midshipman\r\non the frigate _President_, Commodore John Rogers. In 1812 he was\r\nassigned to the _Guererre_, under Decatur. In 1813 he was on the\r\n_Spark_, one of the Algerine squadron. In 1817, having been promoted\r\nto a Lieutenancy, he was transferred to the sloop-of-war _Erie_, and\r\nin 1818, to the _Peacock_. He was next ordered to the sloop-of-war\r\n_Cyane_, in 1819. In 1821 he was upon the _Hornet_, 1st Lieutenant,\r\nat the West India station. In 1822 he was again on the _Cyane_, under\r\nCom. Creighton. From 1825 to 1829 he held a position at the Brooklyn\r\nNavy Yard, and in 1829 he was again assigned to the _Peacock_, and\r\nsent in search of the _Hornet_, sloop-of-war, which was lost. We\r\nnext find him on the _Falmouth_, and ordered to Carthagena. From\r\n1830 to 1834 he was in shore service. In 1835 he has command of the\r\n_John Adams_, in the Mediterranean squadron. In 1837 he is second\r\nin command at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and from 1843 to 1846 he had\r\nthe full command of this yard. During the Mexican war we find him in\r\nactive service, and in command of the _Ohio_, ship-of-the-line. In\r\n1851 he was commander of the Norfolk Navy Yard; and in 1852 assigned\r\nto the command of the Mediterranean squadron, which he held till\r\n1855. He is next in command of the Charleston Navy Yard, which he\r\nheld till May, 1859. In March, 1861, he was a member of a naval\r\nCourt-martial, and while there was appointed flag officer of the\r\nAtlantic Blockade squadron. In 1861 Com. Stringham was honored with\r\nthe preparation of the first of those combined naval and military\r\nexpeditions which have crowned the American navy with such glory;\r\nand in his case, as in many others, the success has been almost\r\nexclusively due to the action of the navy. The result of this\r\nexpedition being the capture of the rebel forts Clark and Hatteras,\r\nand the surrender of the garrison to Flag-officer Stringham and\r\nGeneral Butler, consisting of 715 men, 1000 stand of arms, 75 kegs of\r\npowder, 5 stand of colors, 31 cannon (1 of them a 10-inch Columbiad),\r\na brig loaded with cotton, a sloop with provisions and stores, 2\r\nlight-boats, 150 bags of coffee, &c. Not a man belonging to the fleet\r\nwas killed. For this brilliant affair Flag-officer Stringham received\r\nthe thanks of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of September, 1861, at his own request, he was relieved\r\nfrom his command, and in August, 1862, he was made a Rear-Admiral,\r\non the retired list, and soon after this he was President of the\r\nNaval Commission to locate a new Navy Yard. In 1863 he had command\r\nof the Navy Yard and station at Charleston, S. C., remained there\r\ntill 1866. In 1869 he was Port Admiral at New York, and served three\r\nyears. March 3d, 1873, by Act of Congress, retired officers are\r\nprohibited from being employed by Government, except in time of war.\r\nSince that time the Admiral is permitted to enjoy a retired life, at\r\nhis residence, in Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\nFor a more full account of the noble and daring deeds and brilliant\r\nexploits of Admiral Stringham, see _The American Crisis of 1861-'62_,\r\nby Frank Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. LEBBEUS LATHROP, son of Hannah Horton and Isaiah Vail, Jr.\r\n(_Silas_, _Barnabas_, _Barnabas_, _Caleb I._), born in Goshen, N. Y.,\r\n27 Oct., 1791; married SALLY MOORE, a lineal descendant of Thomas\r\nMoore, of Southold, L. I.\r\n\r\nChildren, probably all born in Newburgh, N. Y., where they settled\r\nsoon after marriage:\r\n\r\n    1. Charles.\r\n\r\n    2. Hector.\r\n\r\n    3. Azuba.\r\n\r\n    4. Nathaniel.\r\n\r\n    5. Hannah.\r\n\r\n    6. Wilmot.\r\n\r\n    7. Richard.\r\n\r\n    8. Sally.\r\n\r\n    9. Egbert.\r\n\r\n    10. Anna.\r\n\r\n    \"He early engaged in the business of transporting Orange County\r\n    products to New York, and soon found himself in command of a\r\n    first-class sloop, of extra heavy tonnage, and his carrying\r\n    trade of merchandise, passengers, &c., became very extensive.\r\n    The immense traffic at White Hall Street, East River, prompted\r\n    Captain Vail to seek some other quarters, more commodious than\r\n    that he occupied--the city at that time having a population of\r\n    only about 100,000. He soon found an old acquaintance, formerly\r\n    a Miss Horton, of West Chester Co., N. Y., who had married\r\n    Mr. James Van Nostrand, a wholesale grocer. An arrangement\r\n    was soon consummated, by which Van Nostrand was to move his\r\n    stock to West Street, and Vail to leave East River and land\r\n    at the Albany Basin, adjacent to Van Nostrand's store, which\r\n    arrangement was at once announced to the Hudson River boatmen\r\n    at White Hall, when, in derision, they laughed at the young\r\n    Captain's presumption; but Vail and Van Nostrand soon had the\r\n    laugh on the White Hall advocates, for the entire craft from\r\n    Orange County soon followed Capt. Vail, discharging regularly\r\n    his heavy loads of produce from the _Bayard_,[7] the first\r\n    to establish a regular wharf for Orange County produce and\r\n    passengers on the North River side of New York, and Van\r\n    Nostrand's grocery was the first ever located in West Street.\r\n    The following summer Capt. Vail's eyesight became impaired,\r\n    and he moved to Goshen, New York, where he and Mrs. Vail were\r\n    popular hotel keepers until the year 1834, when he was elected\r\n    Clerk of Orange County, and re-elected in 1837, and again in\r\n    1840. In 1832 he established at Goshen a Baptist periodical,\r\n    called the _Signs of the Times_, which is still in existence,\r\n    and edited and published at Middletown, New York, by Elder\r\n    Beebe, the venerable Old-School Baptist preacher. He, also, in\r\n    1844, established in Goshen the _Clarion_, the first Free-Soil\r\n    newspaper ever established in this part of the State of New\r\n    York. His religious and political opinions were regarded as\r\n    _ultra_ or _radical_, and he was a recognized leader of his\r\n    sect or party. His general urbanity and good judgment, and his\r\n    enthusiastic nature, combined with his fine appreciation of the\r\n    arts, made him popular with all classes of people. He died in\r\n    Goshen.\r\n\r\n    \"Mrs. Vail survived him over a quarter of a century. She was\r\n    devotedly attached to him and his children. She was a beautiful\r\n    woman, and her happiness seemed to centre in their welfare,\r\n    which her husband reciprocated by leaving her his entire\r\n    estate, which she left unimpaired at her death, after a life\r\n    of over four-score years. Their youngest daughter is the well\r\n    known Madame Martinez, the eminent soprano vocalist and teacher\r\n    of the voice.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Nathaniel Vail, Esq., of Goshen, for the foregoing\r\nrecord and sketch of Lebbeus L.

He was long a magistrate, and for\r\nfour years in succession he represented Livingston and Alleghany\r\nCounties in the Legislature of the State of New York. He was often\r\nan arbitrator, both in the Church and out of it. In religion he was\r\nwhat was then called, by way of reproach, a _radical_. In 1829 he\r\nwent to Nevada. In 1851 he was appointed U. S. Mail Agent for Oregon.\r\nHe finally settled at Hood River, where, on the 10th Oct., 1868, he\r\ndied. For several years before his death, he carried on an extensive\r\nbusiness in raising fruit, and became quite rich. He was a thoroughly\r\nanti-slavery man, and while the Liberty party was in existence, he\r\nwas its firm and warm supporter. Mrs. Coe resides at Hood River, and\r\nher son Charles, who was a superior young man, noted for his piety\r\nand sound moral and Christian character, carried on successfully his\r\nfather's business until his death, which occurred 24 Dec., 1874. His\r\nmother said of him, \"My heart's beloved has left me, nothing can fill\r\nthe void. He not only filled his father's place on the farm, but also\r\nat the family altar, and notwithstanding his youth, older men came to\r\nhim for advice on matters temporal as well as religious.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Coe is an educated, refined and talented Christian lady--an able\r\nand finished writer, and the author of many very pretty verses and\r\npoems, and though aged, and having suffered much from ill health,\r\nyet her penmanship is neat, and her thoughts and words fresh, warm\r\nand vigorous. Speaking of her deceased little infant, Susan Amelia,\r\nshe says, \"To whom, like a dew-drop, kissed off by the sun's morning\r\nbeam, a beauteous existence was given, whose soul seemed to come down\r\nto earth in a dream, only to wake up when it ascended to Heaven.\" She\r\nhas kindly given much valuable information in regard to the Hortons\r\nof New Jersey and their connections, only a small part of which can\r\nappear in the \"Chronicles.\" Mrs. Coe's ancestors, both on her father\r\nand mother's side, were originally from England.\r\n\r\nRACHEL BENNET, daughter of David Bennet and Mary Coe, and\r\ngrand-daughter of Huldah Horton, is a maiden lady, intelligent, well\r\neducated and possesses good social qualities; she is a successful\r\nteacher. We are indebted to her for many interesting letters, giving\r\ngenealogical data of members of the Horton family.

Indeed\r\n    they have not been celebrated for great heroic achievements\r\n    of any kind. Nevertheless, with but few exceptions, they\r\n    have been industrious, peaceable, law-abiding, and very\r\n    respectable citizens, possessing commendable self-reliance\r\n    and independence. They belong to the middle class of the\r\n    people--the class which has always constituted the basis of\r\n    a good-ordered, well-regulated, and prosperous State and\r\n    Nation. Let their merits and their virtues be inscribed on the\r\n    tablets of our memories, and preserved for our veneration and\r\n    emulation.\"--_Letter of Harrison Faulkner Horton, September,\r\n    1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.

He was frank spoken, open,\r\ngenial and social. His native industry, all through his childhood and\r\nyouth, displayed great aptitude for business. In all these respects,\r\nas was the boy so is the man.\r\n\r\nAfter availing himself of the schools of his native town, in his 16th\r\nyear he entered upon the English and the commercial courses of study,\r\nin the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute, at Towanda, remaining there\r\nthrough 1858 and 1859. He then continued as an efficient clerk in his\r\nfather's store until August, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe war for the Union had burst upon the nation. His heart was ablaze\r\nwith enthusiasm for the Constitution and the Union. His father was\r\nproud of the valor and patriotism of his young son. Joseph had become\r\nas his right hand, and was his main-stay in business. The fond father\r\nhesitated to spare a son so dear to his heart, and so essential to\r\nthe success of his affairs. At length, like tens of thousands of\r\nother fathers, he made the sacrifice for his country, consented, and\r\nallowed Joseph to enlist on the 7th of August, 1862, at Wyalusing,\r\nunder Captain George W. Jackson, in Company \"A,\" of the 141st\r\nRegiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Joseph was a week afterwards\r\n(August 14th,) elected 1st Lieutenant of this Company.\r\n\r\nIn September his Regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade of Birney's\r\n(formerly Kearney's) Division in the 3d Army Corps. It was almost\r\nimmediately put into most active service. Five days after his first\r\nbattle (that of Fredericksburg,) Lieut. Horton was made Captain of\r\nhis Company, viz.: on the 18th of December.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th day of the following May (1863) Captain Horton was engaged\r\nwith his Regiment in the battle of Chancellorville, Virginia. The\r\nRegiment went into this engagement with 419 men, and during the fight\r\nhad 234 killed or wounded; and for its firm constancy and bravery was\r\nwarmly complimented, both by General Birney and General Graham.\r\n\r\nAt Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July, 1863, this Regiment was again\r\nactively engaged. And of Capt. Horton, Gen. Madill, in his report\r\nsays: \"Capt. Horton, though severely stunned by concussion of shell,\r\nremained in the field, and I am greatly indebted to him for his\r\nservices, _as he was the only Captain left with the Regiment_.\" On\r\nthe 3d of July, at Gettysburg, Capt. Horton commanded the Regiment.\r\nAt the morning roll-call of this fearful day, 198 men answered to\r\ntheir names; of this number, 136 were either killed or wounded.\r\nOn the 31st of the following January (1864) Captain Horton was\r\ncommissioned Major, commanding his Regiment. And on the 28th of the\r\nnext month (February, 1864,) he was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel,\r\ncommanding his Regiment until Lee's surrender, April 9th, 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, Col. Horton was wounded, during the engagement at\r\nSpottsylvania, Virginia, by a gun-shot through his left forearm and\r\nin his left hip.\r\n\r\nDuring his wounded condition, he was visited by his uncle, Hon.\r\nGeorge F. Horton, M. D., and was tenderly nursed by his sister\r\nLouisa, wife of Hon. Uriah Terry. While convalescing, and not\r\nyet well enough to take the field, he was appointed on several\r\nCourts-Martial, and also had charge of several convoys of new men,\r\nconducting them to posts along the southern sea-board.\r\n\r\nWith his Regiment, he was honorably mustered out of the service at\r\nthe close of the war, May 28th, 1865.\r\n\r\nOf Col. Horton's old Company \"A,\" consisting of 117 members, there\r\nwere killed, 16; died, 9; discharged for disability, 20; discharged\r\nfor wounds, 15; transferred to veteran corps for wounds, 7;\r\ntransferred to 57th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, for unexpired\r\nterm of service, 14; absent in hospital, wounded, 4; dishonorably\r\ndischarged, 1; leaving, at the mustering out of the Regiment, of the\r\nwhole 117, only 31.\r\n\r\nCol. Horton was engaged in the following battles, namely:\r\nFredericksburg, Cedars, Chancellorville, Gettysburg, Wilderness,\r\nSpottsylvania, Petersburg, Weldon Railroad, White-Oak Road, Sailors'\r\nCreek, and at Lee's surrender; besides participating in many small\r\nskirmishes.\r\n\r\nHonorably freed from his military service by the happy close of the\r\nwar, Col. Horton hasted home to be the business stay of his aged\r\nfather, and was actively engaged in mercantile pursuits up to 1871.\r\n\r\nIn October (24th) 1866, he was married, at Worcester, Massachusetts,\r\nto ABBY H. NEWCOMB, only daughter of Charles and Lucy R. Newcomb, of\r\nthat city. Miss Lucy Sanderson Horton is their only child; she was\r\nborn December 18th, 1872.\r\n\r\nSince 1871, Col. Horton has been living at Birch Creek (formerly\r\nBernice Colliery), Sullivan County, Pa., and is Superintendent of\r\n\"The Sullivan Anthracite Coal Company's\" works, located at that place.\r\n\r\nThe high appreciation in which he is held by the Company, is shared\r\nby the community under his employ, who have several times combined\r\nin tendering to him, as their Superintendent and considerate friend,\r\ntestimonials of large intrinsic value, but still more valuable as\r\nevidences of their cordial and grateful esteem.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans of his County unanimously urged him as their nominee\r\nfor Congress in the fall of 1874, but were overruled by the other\r\nCounties of the District.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.

Horton, in Terrytown, Mrs. Deborah E., wife\r\n    of Dr. W. J. Hillis, of Barclay. She was born Nov., 1844, born\r\n    again Feb., 1866, and has passed from earth to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written by a lady in the West, on the death\r\nof Mrs. HILLIS:\r\n\r\n\r\n    LINES ON THE DEATH OF COUSIN DEBBIE.\r\n\r\n      She faded away in the early spring-time,\r\n          Ere Nature put on her robe of green,\r\n      And with a peaceful look in her clear blue eyes,\r\n          She calmly passed to the land unseen.\r\n\r\n      Oh, she has gone from us; so young and so fair,\r\n          Wearing all the charms of youthful bloom,\r\n      And around our hearts there comes a deep sadness,\r\n          O'ershadowing us in midnight gloom,\r\n\r\n      Earth's tenderest ties were twined around her,\r\n          And fain would we have had her stay;\r\n      But angels around the throne were beckoning\r\n          As if to hasten her flight away.\r\n\r\n      No fear of death could blanch her marble cheek,\r\n          Nor dim the pure lustre of her eye;\r\n      Through faith she looked above this fleeting world,\r\n          Where joys immortal ne'er fade or die.\r\n\r\n      Her face was radiant with heavenly glory\r\n          As she murmured a parting prayer,\r\n      And then we knew, by her saint-like beauty,\r\n          That the seal of death was written there.\r\n\r\n      We miss her, yes, we miss the cheerful sunshine\r\n          That she cast on every side,\r\n      And we mourn the crushed and blighted hopes,\r\n          Of a fond and loving bride.\r\n\r\n      But there's a light to lure us homeward,\r\n          In this sorrowing world of ours;\r\n      And we'll strive to meet the dearly loved one\r\n          Where forever bloom unfading flowers.\r\n\r\n  E.

F. and Abigail Horton, aged 25 years.\r\n\r\n    Decided in her convictions, yet with charity for all, amiable\r\n    in disposition and warm in her affections, she won a large\r\n    circle of friends, who sympathize with her immediate relatives\r\n    in this bereavement. She availed herself of every advantage\r\n    afforded to store her mind with useful knowledge. Diligent as a\r\n    pupil, she was successful as a teacher, exhibiting unflagging\r\n    energy and patience in the school room, she surpassed most\r\n    in securing the love and advancement of her pupils. She was\r\n    sustained through a long and painful illness by an unfaltering\r\n    trust in her covenant keeping Saviour, and with her feet firmly\r\n    set on the Rock of Ages by a living faith, fearlessly entered\r\n    the dark valley, fearing no evil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Truly Yours\r\n\r\n    Nancy T. Horton]\r\n\r\n    She referred to the following stanzas, as expressing her own\r\n    hopes when near the close of her earthly existence, and which\r\n    are inserted for this as well as for their exquisite beauty:\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEARER HOME.\r\n\r\n    BY ALICE CARY.\r\n\r\n      One sweetly solemn thought\r\n        Comes to me o'er and o'er--\r\n      I'm nearer to my home to-day\r\n        Than I have been before.\r\n\r\n      Nearer my Father's house,\r\n        Where the many mansions be,\r\n      Nearer the great white throne,\r\n        Nearer the crystal sea.\r\n\r\n      Nearer the bound of life,\r\n        Where we lay our burdens down,\r\n      Nearer leaving the cross,\r\n        Nearer gaining the crown!\r\n\r\n      But lying darkly between,\r\n        Winding down through the night,\r\n      Is the silent, unknown stream\r\n        That leads at last to the light.\r\n\r\n      Closer and closer my steps\r\n        Come to the dread abysm;\r\n      Closer Death to my lips\r\n        Presses the awful chrism.\r\n\r\n      Oh! if my mortal feet\r\n        Have almost gained the brink;\r\n      If it be I am nearer home,\r\n        Even to-day, than I think;\r\n\r\n      Father, perfect my trust,\r\n        Let my spirit feel in death\r\n      That her feet are firmly set\r\n        On the rock of a living faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [_From the Presbyterian._]\r\n\r\n    In Terrytown, Pa., on the 7th inst., Miss Nancy T. daughter\r\n    of Dr. G. F. and Abigail Horton, aged twenty-five years. Born\r\n    of pious parents, from infancy she enjoyed the advantages\r\n    of religious culture. In early life she made profession of\r\n    faith in Christ, and ever after adorned that profession with\r\n    a consecrated life and godly deportment. She was among the\r\n    first to unite with the then recently organized Presbyterian\r\n    church at Terrytown, which she loved with the ardor of a\r\n    sanctified affection. Possessed of unusual decision of\r\n    character and strong convictions of the truth of her opinions,\r\n    she nevertheless exercised a broad charity for those whom she\r\n    thought conscientiously differed from her. Her amiability,\r\n    intelligence, purity, and warm affection won her a large circle\r\n    of friends, over whom she had great influence. Her end was\r\n    peace, and in full assurance of a blessed immortality. One\r\n    incident, among many others, may be given as illustrating the\r\n    ground of her confidence. Shortly before her death, clasping\r\n    her arms around her brother's neck, she whispered:\r\n\r\n      \"Nothing in my hand I bring,\r\n      Simply to the cross I cling.\"\r\n\r\n    This simple clinging to the cross was her support through the\r\n    long months of wasting sickness, the secret of her patience in\r\n    suffering, and the staff of her strength through the valley of\r\n    the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n      COM.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.

D., son of Dr. Harvey Horton and Mary Bennet\r\n(_Barnabas_, _Silas_, _Barnabas_, _Barnabas_, _Caleb I._), born at\r\nGreenville, Orange Co., N. Y., 12 March, 1832; married in Middletown,\r\nN. Y., in March, 1859, to FANNY CAROLINE BEEBE, daughter of Elder\r\nGilbert Beebe, the distinguished and able editor of the \"_Signs\r\nof the Times_,\" and sister of the Hon. George M. Beebe, member of\r\nCongress from Orange Co., N. Y., and born in Middletown, N. Y., exact\r\ndate not given. Dr. Horton graduated in Albany Medical College,\r\nClass of 1856. He established an office and commenced the practice\r\nof medicine at Middletown, N. Y., and was very successful. After his\r\nmarriage he removed to Kansas, and settled at Atchison. On his way\r\nreturning home from a journey East he was instantly killed, 3 Sept.,\r\n1861, by the fall of a bridge with a train of cars upon it, one of\r\nwhich he was in, which spanned the Little Platte River, nine miles\r\neast of St. Joseph, Missouri. The bridge had been partly burned by\r\nthe rebels, but left standing ready to fall when the cars came upon\r\nit, for the purpose of killing Union soldiers. Thirteen persons were\r\nkilled, and over eighty badly injured by this barbarous outrage.\r\nThe Doctor's corpse was taken to Middletown, and buried in the Hill\r\nCemetery by the side of his father, and mother, and sisters.\r\n\r\nThey had one child, Mary Evelyn, born 3 Aug., 1861. After the death\r\nof her husband, the Doctor's wife returned to Orange Co., where the\r\nlittle child died, 21 Oct., 1861, and was buried by the side of its\r\ndead father.\r\n\r\nDr. Horton was a man of superior mental capacity, possessed high\r\nliterary talent, was deeply learned in his profession, and doubtless,\r\nhad he lived, would have attained to great eminence in the science of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. HON. ALBERT HOWELL, son of Dr. Harvey A. Horton and Mary Bennet,\r\nborn near Brookfield, in the town of Minnisink, Orange Co., N. Y., 13\r\nMarch, 1837; married in Middletown, N. Y., by the Rev. Mr. Harris,\r\n26 May, 1864, to ANNA AMELIA ROBERTSON, daughter of William Wells\r\nRobertson and Adaline Sayer, and born in Centerville, Minnisink\r\nTownship, 2 July, 1840.\r\n\r\nChildren:\r\n\r\n    1. Carrie Robertson, born in Middletown, N. Y., 22 April, 1865.\r\n\r\n    2. Mary Bennet, born in Atchison, Kansas, 12 July, 1868.\r\n\r\n    3. Rosa Sayer, born in Atchison, Kansas, 2 June, 1871.\r\n\r\n    4. Albert Howell, born in Atchison, Kansas, 1 April, 1874.\r\n\r\nAlbert H. Horton attended the public school at West Town, N. Y.,\r\nuntil 13 years of age, and then attended the \"_Farmer's Hall\r\nAcademy_,\" at Goshen, Orange Co., New York, and was there prepared\r\nfor college. He entered the \"University of Michigan,\" as a freshman,\r\nand remained there two years, but was compelled to leave college on\r\naccount of inability to study, owing to some trouble with his eyes.\r\nIn 1857, he entered the law office of Hon. Joseph W. Gott, at Goshen,\r\nNew York, as a law student, and remained there until December 18th,\r\n1858, when he was admitted as a counsellor and attorney at-law, at\r\na general term of the N. Y. Supreme Court, held in Brooklyn, New\r\nYork. In 1859, he went West, with his brother, and the Hon. George M.\r\nBeebe, now member of Congress from New York State, to engage in the\r\npractice of the law. He formed a partnership in the law business with\r\nMr. Beebe, under the firm name of Beebe & Horton, at Macon, Moscow,\r\nMo., in 1859, but both parties soon became tired of Missouri, and\r\nremoved to Kansas. Mr. Beebe soon became Secretary of the Territory\r\nof Kansas, and their acting Governor. Mr. Horton selected Atchison,\r\nAtchison Co., Kansas, as his adopted home, and has resided there\r\never since. In 1860, he was appointed City Attorney of Atchison, by\r\nthe Mayor, the Hon. Geo. H. Fairchild. In the Spring of 1861, he\r\nwas elected City Attorney of the same city, on the Union ticket. In\r\nSeptember of 1864, he was appointed District Judge of the 2d Judicial\r\nDistrict, of Kansas, by the Governor, Hon. Chas. H. Robinson. He was\r\nelected and re-elected to the same office, and then resigned in 1865,\r\nto continue the practice of his profession. On his entering practice,\r\nhe was again elected City Attorney of Atchison, and held the position\r\none year. In 1868, he was elected as one of the State Electors on the\r\nRepublican State ticket in Kansas, and was selected the messenger\r\nto take the vote of Kansas to Washington, to be deposited with the\r\nVice-President for Grant and Colfax. From 1861 to 1864, in addition\r\nto attending to the duties of Judge of the District Court, he edited,\r\nwith Hon. John J. Ingalls, the weekly \"_Champion_,\"--a newspaper\r\nprinted and published at Atchison. Mr. Ingalls is now the U. S.\r\nSenator from Kansas. In May, 1869, Mr. Horton was appointed, by\r\nPresident Grant, U. S. District Attorney of Kansas, and he held this\r\noffice till July 18th, 1873, and then resigned the position. Upon the\r\nresignation of Judge Delabay, U. S. Judge of Kansas, in 1874, Mr.\r\nHorton's name was mentioned very prominently in connection with the\r\nvacant Judgeship, and at a State Bar meeting, called to recommend\r\nnames for the position, Mr. Horton was presented by the majority\r\nof the lawyers present for the place. Owing to some difference of\r\nopinion among the Kansas delegation in Congress, however, Hon.\r\nC. G. Foster, of Atchison, was appointed in his stead. Mr. Horton\r\nstill continues the practice of his profession at Atchison, and is\r\nthe local attorney of the Chicago and Rock Island R. R. Co., and\r\nthe Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe R. R. Co., at that place. In\r\nMarch, 1873, Horton was associated with the Hon. Caleb Cushing, of\r\nMassachusetts, in the defence of Senator S. C. Pomeroy, before the U.\r\nS. Senate Investigating Committee, charged to inquire into certain\r\npretended charges of bribery, connected with the Senatorial election\r\nin Kansas, in January, 1873. After a lengthy examination, Senator\r\nPomeroy was acquitted by a majority of the Senatorial Committee.\r\nAfterwards the charges against Mr. Pomeroy were dismissed in Kansas,\r\nand the case against him never came to trial. In the Fall of 1873,\r\nHorton was elected by upwards of 500 majority to the Legislature of\r\nKansas, and took a prominent part in the impeachment of Hon. Josiah\r\nE. Hayes, State Treasurer of Kansas. Mr. Horton was chairman of the\r\ncommittee which reported and carried the impeachment through the\r\nHouse, in February, 1874, and was then appointed Chairman of the\r\nBoard of Managers to prosecute the impeached Treasurer before the\r\nState Senate. The State Treasurer then resigned, and the impeachment\r\nended. In politics Mr. Horton is a Republican, but belongs to the\r\nConservative side of the party.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated York-Pomeroy Bribery Case was brought to a final\r\ntermination on the eleventh of March, 1875, and the $7,000 historic\r\npackage was turned over to Mr. Pomeroy's counsel, the Hon. A. H.\r\nHorton. Great credit is due Judge Horton for his untiring efforts in\r\nhaving such an unjust and malicious prosecution brought to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ANNA ELIZA, daughter of Parmenas H. Horton and Milicent Howell\r\n(_Barnabas_, _Silas_, _Barnabas_, _Barnabas_, _Caleb I._), born in\r\nMiddletown, N. Y., 15 Jan., 1830; married in Middletown, 23 March,\r\n1859, by the Rev. Daniel F.

Mrs. Gardner says: \"Milicent Howell was the name of\r\nboth my paternal and maternal grandmothers, and yet they were not\r\nat all related as we know of; we have often spoken of it as quite a\r\nsingular coincidence.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gardner was the first to propose a GENERAL GATHERING and SOCIAL\r\nUNION and RE-UNION of the Horton family of our country, which is to\r\ntake place in Philadelphia in July, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.

He remarks in one of his letters,\r\n\r\n    \"The Patriarchs, Nathan and Samuel Horton, who settled in\r\n    Bedford Co., Pa., seemed to live in a quiet, Quaker-like way,\r\n    as they left no records save a few deeds and other legal\r\n    papers, which we found on the county records. They were both\r\n    practical blacksmiths, and that trade has been adopted by a\r\n    great many of both families, and many of their descendants are\r\n    at this time the best mechanics of the country. I have myself\r\n    a set of blacksmith tools, brought from Philadelphia by my\r\n    grandfather when he moved out, and the bellows bears the brand\r\n    'D. C. Dawson, Philadelphia, 1774,' and I do not keep them as\r\n    an heirloom, for they are in active use almost every day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI. JAMES C., son of Gen.

They are generally regarded as a clever, honest, liberal,\r\n    and charitable people. They possess good social qualities,\r\n    and are generally very popular, and these characteristics,\r\n    capability being added, account for so many of them holding\r\n    public positions. Many of them are public professors of\r\n    Christianity, and belong to the Baptist and Methodist\r\n    denominations.\r\n\r\n    \"In politics they were formerly Whigs,--were all faithful to,\r\n    though not fully approving, the cause of the late Southern\r\n    Confederacy. They are now all conservative, and acting with the\r\n    Democratic party. Though generally intelligent, educated, and\r\n    talkative, there has never yet one of them been a preacher or a\r\n    lawyer, and but one a physician. They are nearly all engaged\r\n    in agricultural pursuits, and generally fond of amusements,\r\n    such as hunting, fishing, etc.\"--_Letter of Hon. William\r\n    Horton, of Boone, N.

He was then taken to Johnson's Island,\r\nOhio, where he says, that the suffering from hunger was so great that\r\nrats were freely eaten by the prisoners. After remaining there about\r\ntwenty months, he was released on parole, and got home in March,\r\n1865.

RUTH ANN, daughter of Nelson Horton and Sarah Shons (_Silas\r\nDanes_, _Silas_, _Silas_, _Barnabas_, _Barnabas_, _Caleb I._), born\r\nin Wallkill, N. Y., 14 June, 1838. She is an intelligent maiden\r\nlady--a live member of the Old School Baptist Church. She has\r\nrendered valuable assistance in gathering up genealogical data of her\r\nbranch of the Horton family; under date of May, 1871, she says:\r\n\r\n    \"In regard to leading traits of character of the Horton family,\r\n    I may speak of the disposition manifested in my own line. Some\r\n    might set them down as too dogmatical. I do admit that most of\r\n    them are rather tenacious of their own opinions. Especially\r\n    were my grandfather and his brother Barnabas positive and firm\r\n    men. But I do not think this trait of character is so prominent\r\n    in other branches of the family. In regard to punctuality\r\n    and uprightness, they can present as untarnished a record as\r\n    any other family. I have never heard of any of them being\r\n    imprisoned for debt or misdemeanor. Their social standing has\r\n    always been good. As to mental capacity, I believe they have\r\n    generally been people of good common sense. They have not, so\r\n    far as I know, ever made any special mark in the literary or\r\n    scientific world. Politically, as a general thing, they embrace\r\n    and adhere to the _Democratic idea_--the idea of freedom and\r\n    equal rights. They have mainly followed agricultural pursuits.\r\n    I believe frugality has ever been a leading characteristic\r\n    of the family, in all its history, and we find this trait\r\n    of character still prominent, despite the great amount of\r\n    prodigality and unthrift witnessed in these times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Y., 16 May, 1796; died\r\nin Goshen, at the age of 47 years. He married 9 April, 1817, Maria\r\nRyneck, of Schenectady.\r\n\r\nChildren, all born in Goshen:\r\n\r\n    1. Silas Ryneck.\r\n\r\n    2.

Moffat.\r\n\r\n    8. Gertrude, married Brown C. Ward.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 18 the Doctor entered the junior class at Union\r\nCollege, and he was soon distinguished for his close application to\r\nhis studies and strict regard for integrity. After his collegiate\r\ncourse, he studied medicine, and attended medical lectures in the\r\nmedical department of the University of New York, during the palmy\r\ndays of Mitchell and Hosack, and like these eminent teachers, he\r\ncultivated a taste for patient, cautious and bold investigation,\r\nwhich afterwards made him so distinguished and successful in the\r\nmedical profession.\r\n\r\nHe commenced the practice of medicine at the residence of his father,\r\nand he soon possessed the confidence of the people and secured a\r\nlarge practice. He afterwards moved to the village of Goshen, and\r\nsoon became a prominent man among his medical brethren, and, though\r\nyoung, he was nevertheless called upon to perform all the difficult\r\nand grave surgical operations occurring in the village, and also in\r\nthe surrounding country. He was a good surgeon, but he was still\r\nmore celebrated as a physician. By his skill and honorable bearing,\r\nhe early secured the confidence of his medical brethren, and he was\r\nfrequently called in consultation with the aged and experienced\r\nphysicians of his day. He was remarkably successful in the treatment\r\nof fevers, carefully studying their pathology at the bedside, and\r\nalso by post-mortem examinations, and in his views he was greatly in\r\nadvance of the profession of his day. He prepared with great labor a\r\nwork on fevers, but never published it. His pamphlet on Dysentery,\r\nand his Geological Reports, are his only published works, and these\r\nare sufficient to establish his reputation as a profound thinker and\r\na clear and powerful writer.\r\n\r\nAt the bedside he was cheerful, affectionate and soothing, and always\r\ndignified. In his intercourse with his medical brethren he was always\r\nhonorable, and in harmony with the code of medical ethics.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his career of usefulness as a physician, he turned\r\nhis attention to the study of botany, mineralogy and geology, and\r\nsoon became one of the most noted men of his day in these sciences.\r\nHis great delight in these studies led him, at the age of 37, to\r\nrelinquish the practice of medicine and devote himself wholly to\r\nthese sciences, and had he lived a few days longer, he would have\r\npublished a large work on these subjects. The Doctor was also fond of\r\narchæological lore, and he was the first to attempt a genealogical\r\nhistory of the descendants of our old progenitor, Barnabas, of 1640.\r\nThe old Horton roll of names and lineage which he got up some 60\r\nyears ago, was kindly furnished me by his son, Dr. William Horton,\r\nof Craigville, N. Y., and has rendered me valuable assistance in\r\ncompiling the \"Chronicles.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Horton was always rigidly moral, and never sacrificed principle\r\nto expediency. He had early been taught to respect the teachings\r\nof the Bible, and towards the close of his life he was led, with a\r\nchild-like faith, to believe the doctrine of salvation by grace, and\r\nto publicly give himself to the Saviour, wondering and regretting\r\nthat he had so long remained ignorant of the beauty, simplicity and\r\nsublimity of the Gospel scheme of salvation. Thus he died, in hope of\r\na glorious immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. BARNABAS BAILEY, son of Dea. Jonathan Horton and Bethia Hallock\r\n(_Capt. Barnabas_, _Dea.

The Indians\r\n    passed within a few feet of her, but did not discover her.

Nathaniel Case, in the ship _Triad_. With a crew of about\r\n25 men, they made a voyage of about nine months in the South Atlantic\r\nOcean, in latitude 35 to 40°, and longitude 10 to 20°. The voyage was\r\nprosperous and the business paid well. He afterwards made a voyage\r\non the Indian Ocean and South Sea. He followed the business for 13\r\nyears, and during that time, he circumnavigated the earth four times.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that, notwithstanding all the hazard and\r\ndanger of a sea-faring life, they never lost a man by accident or\r\nsickness. They were all temperate men, and this had much to do with\r\ntheir immunity from danger, sickness and death. The Captain quaintly\r\nremarks that a half gallon demi-john of liquor was not used by the\r\nwhole crew, as a beverage, during any one of their voyages. During\r\nthe time he followed the sea he visited the Sandwich Islands, the\r\nSociety Isles, and also New Zealand. On the island of Owyhee he saw\r\nthe place where Capt. Cook was killed by the natives.\r\n\r\nThe last voyage was in 1846-47 and 48, and during this voyage the\r\nCaptain had command of the ship. He took but two gallons of spirits\r\nwith him on that voyage, and part of that he brought back with him.\r\n\r\nThe Captain is beautifully situated at Peconic, L. I.--has a\r\nbeautiful farm, which he knows how to keep in good order, and his\r\nhouse, among the best in the township of Southold, is admirably kept\r\nby his amiable and accomplished lady, and nearly every room in it is\r\nrichly ornamented with frames and cases of rare, costly and beautiful\r\nsea-shells, most tastefully arranged, and all done by the delicate\r\nhands of Mrs. Horton herself. Great skill and persevering effort were\r\nrequired to accomplish so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MARY ELIZABETH, daughter of Osborn Horton and Sally Philips (_Col.\r\nBenjamin_, _Capt. Barnabas_, _Dea.

ALONZO ERASTUS, son of Erastus Horton and Tryphena Burleigh,\r\nborn at Union, Ct., 24 Oct., 1813; married in Jefferson, Wis., 22\r\nDec., 1841, by Charles Rockwell, Esq., to SALLY MILLINGTON WRIGHT,\r\neldest daughter of William Cobb Wright and Sylvia Shelden, and born\r\nin Russia, Herkimer Co., N. Y., 11 May, 1822. She died in Jefferson,\r\nWis., 29 Dec., 1846, leaving no issue. He married 2. at Keyport,\r\nN. J., 29 July, 1861, by N. J. Beedle, Esq., to SARAH WILSON BABE,\r\ndaughter of Joseph Babe and Margaret Wilson, and born at Sing Sing,\r\nN. Y., 3 Sept., 1824. They have no children.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. J. A. Shepherd, of San Diego, for the\r\nfollowing interesting sketch of the life of Mr. A. E. Horton:\r\n\r\n\r\nALONZO E. HORTON.\r\n\r\n    To a person acquainted with this gentleman our introduction\r\n    would sound unfamiliar. \"Here is A. E. Horton, of San Diego,\"\r\n    is all that he would allow to be said before he would be\r\n    acquainted with a room-full of strangers. His motto is\r\n    \"action,\" and he has practiced it long and faithfully. He would\r\n    leave ceremony in the lurch to talk _business_, and never think\r\n    apology necessary; and we can think of no better rule to follow\r\n    in writing what we know of him.\r\n\r\n    His parents commenced their westward march in 1815, from\r\n    Union, Ct., when Alonzo was two years old. Their home for the\r\n    next four years was in Stockbridge, Madison Co., N. Y. Then a\r\n    residence of two years in New Haven, Oswego County, where the\r\n    first school lessons were taken under the direction of Miss\r\n    Patty Woodward. When he was eleven years old the family reached\r\n    the shore of Lake Ontario, in the town of Scriba, and moved\r\n    into their new log-house.\r\n\r\n    Then followed a year of muscular as well as mental discipline\r\n    to the lad Alonzo. His father was suddenly bereft of sight by\r\n    a severe inflammatory attack upon his eyes. School was two\r\n    miles away, and to and fro our student made his morning and\r\n    evening tramps in pursuit of knowledge. But he was the eldest\r\n    boy of the household, and to him after study came toil. His\r\n    evenings were spent in basket-making, which assisted largely in\r\n    providing for the wants of the family. Thus for about a year he\r\n    bravely essayed to lift the burden from his father's shoulders.\r\n    From that time until he was half through his twenty-first year,\r\n    he was first assistant wood-chopper on the home-lot, where they\r\n    filled Oswego orders for hewed timber.\r\n\r\n    He commenced business for himself by purchasing the remaining\r\n    six months of his minority, agreeing to pay $50 to his father\r\n    for that purpose. In eight months from that time he had been a\r\n    grocery clerk at $12 a month; a lake sailor before the mast;\r\n    and the last half of the time owner and captain of the \"Wild\r\n    Goose,\" a small vessel he had purchased, and put into the\r\n    wheat trade between Oswego and Canada. His marine speculation\r\n    proved quite a profitable one for those days; he sold out and\r\n    closed business, paid all his obligations, and had $300 in his\r\n    pocket. During the winter of 1834-'35 he learned the trade\r\n    of a cooper, and his specialty for a time was flour-barrels.\r\n    Then the city of Oswego elected him constable, by the largest\r\n    majority given to any man on the Whig ticket. The young officer\r\n    was too kind-hearted to make his office pay, and he lost all he\r\n    made in trade by failing to enforce payment from poor debtors\r\n    according to law. Out of office he invested $7 in a contract\r\n    for land, and in a month made $336 on the venture. Young Horton\r\n    had another strong point, which was often brought into play in\r\n    the inevitable wrestling-matches incident to town-meetings of\r\n    long ago. His 130 pounds was a most animated and unmanageable\r\n    load for his largest companions to handle, and at \"square\r\n    hold\" he was the acknowledged champion of the township. Yet he\r\n    was pronounced a consumptive by Dr. Van Schaick, with the\r\n    advice \"Go West--it may do you good; but I think it probable\r\n    you will not live more than six months.\" He took the doctor's\r\n    prescription, and went West.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A. E. Horton]\r\n\r\n    He landed in Milwaukee, in May, 1836, and soon after was one\r\n    of a party of six on the _trail_ for the Rock River country.\r\n    There were no roads, and the best inn to be found was to\r\n    turn in their blankets under an oak tree. But the mosquitoes\r\n    promptly presented bills for their lodgings. After thirty\r\n    nights camping, they reached the cabin of Mr. and Mrs. Janes,\r\n    the parents of the now lively city of Janesville. Theirs was\r\n    the only house, and that about 10x16 feet in size, but immense\r\n    in hospitality. After partaking of the latter, the party (among\r\n    whom were the names of Churchill, Odell, Ogden and Jewett)\r\n    continued on until reaching the foot of Koskonong Lake, where\r\n    each one made a quarter-section claim, built a cabin, and went\r\n    back to Milwaukee. One of those claims, at least, was left for\r\n    another pre-emptor, with the cabin thrown in, for Horton was\r\n    soon too busy to think farther about it. Others waited, with\r\n    hands in pockets, for the approaching land sales; he took up\r\n    the shovel and worked on the new streets. Money was worth too\r\n    much to be wasted by idleness. A working-man always gains more\r\n    profitable knowledge than a loafer. His capital was labor and\r\n    observation, and out of these were to be wrought a fortune.\r\n\r\n    Of the two hotels then in the new city, he had selected the\r\n    Bellevue for his lodgings. Two bits a night paid for his share\r\n    of a room, and his own blankets were bed and bedding. His\r\n    room-mates were sometimes as many as sixteen; and his rule was\r\n    \"early to bed.\" Two nephews of the Receiver at the Land-Office\r\n    came in one evening full of an important secret which they must\r\n    talk over. The young fellow who worked on the road was the\r\n    only one retired, besides themselves, and his hearty snoring\r\n    satisfied them that he was beyond hearing. Their authority was\r\n    official, so no danger of mistakes. The bills of the Michigan\r\n    State Bank and Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank would be taken\r\n    at par at the land sales, and consequently would be as good\r\n    as gold, and worth the premium of at least 10 per cent. They\r\n    would quietly gather it in for the occasion. The next day our\r\n    sleeper was _not_ shoveling on the street. He was learning the\r\n    whereabouts of holders of certain styles of Michigan currency,\r\n    and was soon doing a brisk exchange business with his New York\r\n    Safety Fund Savings, amounting to $300. At night he was in\r\n    his room, happy in the prospective addition to his funds; but\r\n    there were two other persons there who thought they had little\r\n    success in securing the coveted currency. It was unaccountable,\r\n    for were they not the only individuals to whom the secret had\r\n    been imparted?\r\n\r\n    The sales of Government land commenced the following day, and\r\n    Horton was present with his receivable funds. He bought no\r\n    land, but his money was in immediate and continuous demand.\r\n    Many times during the sale he retired to replenish his bank\r\n    stock by exchanging bank notes with numerous parties according\r\n    to previous arrangement. The enterprise was a financial\r\n    success. Here his quick perception did him good service, for he\r\n    was marked as a prize by a thieving gang. One of them formed\r\n    his acquaintance on the evening of a profitable day, and tried\r\n    to learn his intended movements. Yes, he would soon go to his\r\n    lodging-place; but that night he concluded it would be best\r\n    _for him_ to remain where he was, and he did so. But another\r\n    young man, about his age, and similarly dressed, was waylaid on\r\n    the very route Horton was expected to travel, caught, gagged\r\n    and carried off to a safe place for robbery. In the dark they\r\n    had captured the wrong man, as his empty pockets and the cut of\r\n    his coat proved on careful examination.\r\n\r\n    Thinking the country a safer place, he went out three miles, to\r\n    where his uncle, Dwight Foster, was superintending one of the\r\n    first saw-mills built in Wisconsin. While there another attempt\r\n    was made to entrap him. One, Robinson, came from town to inform\r\n    him that a man named Johnson would take a named sum for some\r\n    land which he had talked of buying. He must be sharp if the\r\n    trade was secured, and should take his money with him for that\r\n    reason. Horton promptly decided to take _more_, and quietly\r\n    deposited a loaded pistol in each pocket of his hunter's\r\n    coat. His caller carried a suspicious-looking hickory cudgel,\r\n    altogether too cumbersome for a cane, and explained that he had\r\n    been tracking a wild animal, which he hoped they could identify\r\n    by the marks. In a low, marshy place, a little off their road,\r\n    its tracks were most clearly made. Descending to the spot\r\n    indicated, he urged Horton to follow him, and determine what\r\n    sort of creature had crossed there. Instead of complying Horton\r\n    presented a pistol, told his man if he found no tracks there\r\n    as described, he would shoot him without further notice. The\r\n    villain was outwitted, and preferred returning to town a short\r\n    distance in advance of the ready weapons of his captor. It was\r\n    ascertained that Johnson knew nothing of the fellow's errand,\r\n    and that the only foot-prints about the miry trap in which\r\n    Robinson had hoped to catch his game, were made by himself.\r\n    He was next heard of, a few years afterwards, in the Iowa\r\n    penitentiary, committed for horse-stealing.\r\n\r\n    Returning to the East Mr. Horton passed the time until 1840,\r\n    in various places and employments, the last being at St.\r\n    Mary's with the American Fur Co. His first western _home_ was\r\n    purchased in the town of Oakland, Wis., that year, to which\r\n    locality his father and family followed not long after. In a\r\n    few months more he had established himself matrimonially and\r\n    happily. Three years engaged in miscellaneous trade, land\r\n    figuring as the principal item, he became a cattle-dealer.\r\n    He bought his beef in Illinois, did the largest part of the\r\n    driving, and averaged two trips in five weeks. He furnished his\r\n    customers so satisfactorily in his own and adjoining counties,\r\n    that in one year his original capital of $150 was increased\r\n    to $4,000. In St. Louis he saw profits in land-warrants, and\r\n    bought sufficient to locate 1,500 acres of land. Out of this\r\n    investment grew the village of _Hortonville_, in Outagamie\r\n    Co., Wis. His first town was buried in the woods, and he went\r\n    to work with eight men to cut a four-mile road to his proposed\r\n    mill-site. By the time he had lots to sell, he was sawing\r\n    lumber with which to improve them. The prices and payment for\r\n    material was of small account with the proprietor. Houses\r\n    must be built, whether settlers had money or not. In a year\r\n    from the completion of the mill, 150 people were _living_ in\r\n    Hortonville, and at the end of two years sold out the remaining\r\n    property, being $7,188 better for his enterprise.\r\n\r\n    In 1851, Mr. Horton went to California for the first time.\r\n    Mining-stock was his first business experience, and it cost\r\n    him $1,000. It was his _last_ transaction in that line also.\r\n    Spent a few months at mining in El Dorado and Placer Counties,\r\n    and then opened a store at Pilot Hill. There also he devised\r\n    and constructed a ditch 6½ miles in length, purposing to\r\n    supply the miners with water as well as other commodities. At\r\n    the end of a year he had sold out his water-works and other\r\n    interests for $6,500, of which sum he had used the larger\r\n    portion in his improvements. Next he was trading in gold-dust\r\n    on account of Adams' Express Co., realizing usually $30 a\r\n    day in commissions. A day or two before the failure of his\r\n    employers, in 1853, a friend suggested to him, that his money\r\n    remaining in their office at ----, might be safer in his own\r\n    pocket. It was \"a word to the wise,\" and before noon the next\r\n    day he had ridden 30 miles, and much to the dissatisfaction of\r\n    the agent, drawn his money from the safe of the company. His\r\n    next care was for his friends hard at work in the mining-camps\r\n    and elsewhere. To all whom he could reach he gave the hint,\r\n    and thousands of dollars were secured, by his prompt efforts,\r\n    to those who had earned the money by the hardest of toil. The\r\n    following day the express offices were closed, and payments\r\n    suspended. He was in capital standing in the mining districts\r\n    where he had operated, and resumed the business with himself\r\n    for banker. He bought at the mines and sold in the towns, often\r\n    with a profit of $4.50 per ounce. He was a man of _dust_, and\r\n    with his native adroitness, managed to carry valuable deposits\r\n    of the precious article upon his person without a single\r\n    mishap. Sometimes his outer garments would scarcely secure him\r\n    other than the slightest attentions. His landlords were afraid\r\n    their bills would be unpaid, except his fares were collected\r\n    in advance. He arrived one evening at one of the rough taverns\r\n    of those times, with treasure enough about him to incite the\r\n    gamblers about him to worse crimes for its possession. His good\r\n    clothes were covered with very dirty overalls and woolen shirt.\r\n    In calculating Yankee phrase, he interrogated the proprietor as\r\n    to his accommodations for man and beast, and the reasonableness\r\n    of his _charges_. Card-playing ceased for a time in the general\r\n    astonishment, then the party shouted with laughter at the\r\n    green chap from Connecticut. They bantered him to play off a\r\n    Yankee trick. He showed them how to eat the mush and milk,\r\n    which he had stipulated for as his supper, and with a yawn of\r\n    indifference to the jests made at his expense, he signified\r\n    his desire to sleep. The door of his room was without lock or\r\n    bolt, but the landlord laughingly assured his guest, that he\r\n    would be the last man anybody would think of robbing. He awoke\r\n    next morning from an undisturbed sleep, and at breakfast-time\r\n    was up and _dressed_. He passed over a small package of _dust_\r\n    in settlement, which was accepted and pronounced all right.\r\n    Word was sent to the stable, his horse could _now_ be brought\r\n    out--his bill was paid.\r\n\r\n    \"Mister, want to _buy_ some more o' that stuff?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Yes;\" replying with a surprised look.\r\n\r\n    \"How much?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Suppose I can buy all _you_ have to sell.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Will you treat this 'ere crowd ef you can't?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, I will, and _yeou_, too.\"\r\n\r\n    Diminutive sacks of dust were handed to the wondering host, and\r\n    the coin counted out in return. By the time $2500 had exchanged\r\n    hands, the landlord's $20-pieces were exhausted, and our Yankee\r\n    had played the \"trick\" with a $250 pile still in reserve. The\r\n    laugh came in then louder than the night before; and as the\r\n    glasses were being filled the buyer of gold-dust remarked,\r\n    irreligiously, that he would have robbed the fellow himself if\r\n    he had known how he was playing him.\r\n\r\n    The business was as suitable as profitable to the man, and so\r\n    well did he manage it, that his profits for the last quarter\r\n    of 1854, were $1000 per month. Another success was in a novel\r\n    undertaking for those golden days. He went prospecting for\r\n    ice-fields, and finding a favorable situation 25 miles above\r\n    Georgetown, in El Dorado County, put up 312 tons of the cool\r\n    mountain product. A few months afterwards the speculation\r\n    returned him eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n    In March, 1856, among the passengers on board the steamship\r\n    _Cortez_, for Panama, was Mr. Horton. Soon after their arrival\r\n    at the isthmus, the memorable rising of the natives took place.\r\n    The mob would have had easy work in carrying out the plan of\r\n    outrage and plunder, but for the prompt and courageous action\r\n    of our friend and a few of his companions. Among nearly 200\r\n    people from the steamer, who were dining at the hotel where\r\n    the attack was made, there were but three with fire-arms. The\r\n    announcement that the rioters were coming, caused a stampede\r\n    from the table to the upper rooms. On bursting into the house,\r\n    the leading ruffians were halted at the stairway by _Capt._\r\n    Horton and his aids, and as the attempt to ascend was made,\r\n    a few effective shots drove the assailants into the street.\r\n    Immediately the reign of terror and bloodshed began.\r\n\r\n    \"Please, sir, save my father!\" was an appeal from a little\r\n    boy, as he pointed to where a swarthy assassin stood taking\r\n    aim at a defenceless man. The American's revolver was leveled\r\n    and fired just in time to render the other's shot harmless by\r\n    his own fall. Others were protected by the same faithful hand\r\n    and stern purpose as they retreated towards the only place of\r\n    safety--the American steamer. Arriving at the water, the crowd\r\n    rushed on to a small steam-tug, and but for the quick thought\r\n    and bold action of our leader, would have been overtaken by\r\n    the pursuing mob. He took command, gave his orders to fasten\r\n    to a lighter near at hand, transferred his passengers to the\r\n    larger craft, and signalled the engineer to start for the\r\n    _Cortez_. Fortunately, he was obeyed without question, and a\r\n    more successful trip was never made by the _Wild Goose_ and her\r\n    commander on Lake Ontario! His money loss was some $10,000, but\r\n    he could count untold gain in the saving of lives, and to this\r\n    day he refers to his participation in those fearful scenes with\r\n    satisfaction not to be calculated in coin.\r\n\r\n    On their arrival in New York, Mr. Horton was named by his\r\n    fellow-passengers as the person to proceed to Washington, to\r\n    make a statement of the occurrences at Panama, in response to\r\n    a call from the authorities to that effect. From that time\r\n    until his marriage in 1861, he made several journeys between\r\n    Washington and Wisconsin, as a witness in the riot case and a\r\n    claimant for damage. His testimony was important in deciding\r\n    the demand for reparation made by the United States upon the\r\n    Government of New Grenada. His own claim was most strenuously\r\n    and successfully opposed by the Spanish commissioner. He\r\n    had done too much injury to his people to have _his_ losses\r\n    repaid. _All_ other claims were not so objectionable; and as\r\n    a compromise in the final settlement, the man who deserved\r\n    a General's commission for courage and strategic skill, and\r\n    liberal pay for the personal risks taken in his defense of\r\n    American citizens, was stricken from the list of creditors.\r\n\r\n    Starting again for the Pacific coast soon after the civil war\r\n    was began at Sumpter, he included a trip to British Columbia\r\n    in his travels. At Lewiston, on the Columbia River, he began\r\n    to think of the outfit needed for the journey. His effects\r\n    inventoried one gold pencil, a single-barreled pistol, and $15\r\n    cash. To his brother-in-law, Mr. Charles Wright, who was one\r\n    of his traveling companions, and much better provided with\r\n    equipments, he intimated that he must do a little _trading_\r\n    before he could proceed. In half a day he had exchanged his\r\n    jewelry and pistol for a pair of horses; sold one of them again\r\n    at a clean profit of $50; paid $15 for a third; and early in\r\n    the afternoon returned to camp with two good animals, fine\r\n    revolver, saddles, blankets, and about $60 in money. Trading\r\n    was his special success--speculation invariably a failure. For\r\n    a distance of 1400 miles through the northern wilderness, that\r\n    Lewiston revolver brought down most of the game upon which the\r\n    company feasted by the way. In the Salmon River country, trees\r\n    and the feathery snow furnished most comfortable bedding. They\r\n    sold their surplus provisions to a British customs officer\r\n    on the route, at a profit of 66 per cent. At Lytton, they\r\n    replenished their stock, and loaded five of their horses with\r\n    saleable goods. They found a market at Williams' Creek for\r\n    flour at $1.00 per pound, and for bacon at $1.25.\r\n\r\n    Arriving at the Cariboo mining district, the party bought the\r\n    \"Darkey's Claim.\" It was a rich prospect, and they worked the\r\n    lead until snow closed the operations, taking an ounce of gold\r\n    from a bucket of dirt. At this time the claim would have sold\r\n    for thousands of dollars. After wintering at Victoria they\r\n    returned to make their fortunes, securing a force of workmen\r\n    at $10 a day. After working four feet further their riches\r\n    \"jumped\" and vanished beyond recovery. Not a hundred feet off\r\n    three miners were taking out 75 ounces per day, and others\r\n    doing equally well. But the \"Darkey\" had \"run out,\" and the\r\n    owners accepted $200 for their lost treasure. Mining has had no\r\n    attraction for him to this day.\r\n\r\n    When Mr. Horton reached San Francisco again, his financial\r\n    condition would have caused a \"panic\" in any other man. In\r\n    capital he was \"broke,\" but in nothing else. Then as now, there\r\n    were the strength and elasticity of steel in the man's spirit\r\n    and nerves. He first tried a stall in the market; but the\r\n    dollar a day realized caused him to retire from business in a\r\n    short time. Buying and selling a ranch in Rio Visto concluded\r\n    his real-estate operations in that part of the State. He was\r\n    a dealer in second-hand furniture in San Francisco, when he\r\n    first heard San Diego discussed as one of the great cities of\r\n    the future. The value of its harbor and climate was the topic\r\n    of the evening at a private literary gathering where he was\r\n    a frequent listener. What he had heard so impressed itself\r\n    in his thoughts that he could not sleep that night, until he\r\n    had jumped out of bed, and satisfied his inquisitiveness by a\r\n    careful study of the map of California. The situation seemed\r\n    revealed as a prize especially for him. He determined to secure\r\n    it, and--slept.\r\n\r\n    Here was the opportunity long sought and never despaired\r\n    of. In three days the stock was disposed of, and the store\r\n    closed. The proceeds were small--perhaps less than $500. No\r\n    one among his friends could be induced to join him in his\r\n    visionary enterprise. Alone, on the 6th of April, 1867, Mr.\r\n    Horton reached San Diego. It exceeded his expectations, and\r\n    obstacles in the way of purchase were quickly swept aside by\r\n    his indomitable energy. The few people there were having such\r\n    a quiet time, that they had become indifferent to the charm\r\n    of office. The first work was to get an election called for\r\n    Trustees, those officers only being empowered to sell lands\r\n    belonging to the city. Candidates were provided and elected.\r\n    The desired property was legally advertised and sold, and on\r\n    the 11th day of May following, a deed of some 750 acres was\r\n    made. Thirty-six cents an acre, and but one bidder! Mr. Horton\r\n    was the happy purchaser, and little did he care that his\r\n    investment was looked upon by most of the 150 people then in\r\n    San Diego, as a wild expenditure of money.\r\n\r\n    The work of advertising the new city was immediately commenced.\r\n    The tin case in which he carried the first map of \"Horton's\r\n    Addition to San Diego,\" through the streets of San Francisco,\r\n    is carefully treasured in his office, and could not be bought\r\n    for its weight in gold. Horton was everywhere, and irresistible\r\n    in glowing dreams of the future of his city. His labors were\r\n    untiring from the time he measured off blocks and lots with a\r\n    tape-line, and laid out the streets for his workmen to clear\r\n    from cactus and sage-brush, until the winter of 1869-'70, when\r\n    his sales averaged $15,000 a month. From $3,000 in 1867, his\r\n    receipts increased to nearly $85,000 in 1869. His money built\r\n    up the place as fast as received, and it is safe to state, that\r\n    $300,000 have been used by him for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    This is but an imperfect sketch of Mr. Horton's business\r\n    career in San Diego. He has richly earned the sobriquet of\r\n    \"Father of the City,\" and the respect and best wishes of his\r\n    fellow-citizens. His faith and works have been the _life_ of\r\n    the place, when crops failed for want of rain, railroad hopes\r\n    were delayed, or croakers insisted on publishing its death as\r\n    a certainty. Long may Horton live, and great the prosperity he\r\n    may witness in the pet child he has so bravely matured--HIS OWN\r\n    SAN DIEGO!\r\n\r\n    Mr. Horton is a man of liberal views, and has always been\r\n    an ardent and practical advocate of political and religious\r\n    freedom. To the poor, both black and white, he has been a\r\n    faithful friend. To-day, an honest man in homespun receives as\r\n    cordial a grasp of his hand, as the man in broadcloth and fine\r\n    linen. That he has the sympathy and respect of the masses of\r\n    his fellow-citizens, was manifested in a most gratifying manner\r\n    in the vote given him in his county for State Senator, in the\r\n    contest of 1871. His opponent was the Democratic chief of the\r\n    county, that had never before failed to give a large Democratic\r\n    majority. San Diego honored the Republican Horton with a\r\n    majority of 50, and he only failed in election by the adjoining\r\n    county (forming the balance of the district) voting as usual,\r\n    largely Democratic. Socially he is a warm-hearted, affable\r\n    gentleman, true to his friends, and watchful of those who play\r\n    him false. Temperate in his habits, and always active in mind\r\n    and body, his health is as robust, and his personal appearance\r\n    as young as most men at 50 years. Last and best tribute to his\r\n    character, is the kind care for his parents in their helpless\r\n    age, and that love for his MOTHER, which to her was the dearest\r\n    and last earthly tie broken in her departure to the better Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.

EMELINE, daughter of Chauncey Horton and Amanda Chaffee, born in\r\nAshford, Ct., 22 Sept., 1829; married in Stockbridge, Madison Co., N.\r\nY., 8 March, 1854, to the REV. GILES BUTLER CLEVELAND, born 12 Aug.,\r\n1825, in Durham, Greene County, N. Y. They have one son, viz.:\r\n\r\n    Arthur Horton Cleveland, born in the city of Philadelphia, 10\r\n    Feb., 1865.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cleveland graduated from the Ladies' Department of Oberlin\r\nCollege (Ohio), in 1853, and from the Woman's Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania, in 1855. She was elected to the Chair of Anatomy in\r\nthat College, in 1857, which she held until 1862, when she was\r\ntransferred to the Chair of Obstetrics. This she still occupies, and\r\nis also a member of the Board of Corporators.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, at the solicitation of a number of philanthropic ladies\r\nof Philadelphia, who had in view the establishment of a Hospital\r\nfor Women and Children, Professor Cleveland went abroad for medical\r\nstudy, and to make herself acquainted with the arrangements and\r\nmanagement of hospitals. She entered the School of Obstetrics in\r\nconnection with the _Maternite_ of Paris, and after receiving the\r\ndiploma of that institution, found ready access to the wards and\r\nlecture-rooms of other hospitals, and was allowed free inspection of\r\ntheir administrative departments.\r\n\r\nOn her return, she was chosen Resident Physician of the then\r\nchartered Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, which position she\r\ncontinued to fill for seven years. She has been one of the Managers\r\nof the Hospital from its organization, and a member of the Consulting\r\nBoard since her retirement from the office of Resident Physician.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleveland has made a number of important surgical\r\noperations, and is the first woman, so far as known, who ever\r\nperformed ovariotomy. In her second case, a tumor, weighing fifty\r\npounds, was successfully removed, the patient making a good recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

Y., _16 August, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  GEO. F. HORTON, M. D.:\r\n\r\n    _My Dear Friend_: Your very kind and interesting letter of the\r\n    18th inst., came duly to hand some days since. I have often\r\n    heard it said that the Hortons of this country sprung from two\r\n    brothers, who emigrated from England at an early day, and that\r\n    one of them settled in Massachusetts, and the other on Long\r\n    Island. My ancestor, Stephen Horton, I think, was a descendant\r\n    of Thomas Horton, who settled in Springfield, Mass., perhaps\r\n    a son of Thomas. My brother, John Horton, many years since\r\n    obtained from Dr. Horton, of Hartford, Ct., the genealogy\r\n    that I send you. There was many years since a Dr. Horton who\r\n    resided at Springfield, whom my eldest sister visited, and who\r\n    was a relative of ours. He had a son who was also a doctor in\r\n    New York City, and also engaged in the grocery and provision\r\n    business. I think he is dead. I am satisfied that Barnabas\r\n    Horton was a brother of Thomas.\r\n\r\n    Stephen Horton settled in West Springfield, Mass. He had two\r\n    sons, Benjamin and Stephen. Benjamin, born in 1720; died at\r\n    Brandon, Vermont, 13 Jan., 1803. He left two sons, Gideon and\r\n    Moses, also a daughter, who married a Mr. Underwood.\r\n\r\n    Gideon Horton was born in 1744, in West Springfield, Mass.;\r\n    married Sarah Douglass, great aunt to the Hon. Stephen A.\r\n    Douglass. He died at Brandon, Vt., 16 Dec., 1801. His sons\r\n    were Hiram, Gideon, Jr., and John. Hiram, born 5 March, 1764,\r\n    at West Springfield; married Sarah Drury, 16 June, 1785, at\r\n    Pittsford, Vt.; moved to Malone, Franklin Co., N. Y., in 1808.\r\n    He was one of the leading men of the county, holding the office\r\n    of County Treasurer, and first Judge of the Courts for several\r\n    years. He died 5 Oct., 1824.\r\n\r\n    He owned a large quantity of land, also mill-property, and\r\n    several mercantile stores. He belonged to the Presbyterian\r\n    Church, and was active and consistent in its duties. He had\r\n    three sons and seven daughters. Sons were: Harry, John, and\r\n    Hiram, Jr. (myself), all born in Brandon, Vt. Harry, born 22\r\n    July, 1796; died in Constable, N. Y., 22 August, 1840. He was\r\n    a farmer, a merchant, and a manufacturer of flour and lumber.\r\n    He belonged to the Congregational Church. He had two children,\r\n    Hiram Safford Horton (married and settled in Wisconsin, and\r\n    has a large family), and Delia A. Horton, who married Howard\r\n    E. King, Esq., merchant at Malone. John, son of Hiram. Sen.,\r\n    born 22 Dec., 1797; died at Madrid, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y.,\r\n    14 Oct., 1859, without issue. He was also a member of the\r\n    Congregational Church, and followed farming, milling, and\r\n    lumbering. Hiram, Jr., born 22 April, 1799; resides in Malone,\r\n    N. Y.; married 20 Jan., 1822, Adaline Wead. Has three children,\r\n    all born at Malone, N. Y. I. William L. Horton, born 28 Oct.,\r\n    1822; died 19 Sept., 1861. He was a lawyer; left two children:\r\n    George F. and Anna M. Horton. II. Adeline Mead Horton, born 21\r\n    Jan., 1834; married in Oct., 1864, Myron G. Horton, grandson\r\n    of Dr. John Horton, who was the son of Gideon Horton, Sen.,\r\n    being her 3d cousin. They reside at Malone, N. Y., and have two\r\n    children. III. Frederick, born 22 August, 1838, and died 13\r\n    April, 1867, childless. I have now named the male members of\r\n    my branch of the family, and for the family of Gideon Horton\r\n    Jr., I refer you to Dr. Charles W. Horton, of Brattleborough,\r\n    Vt., one of his sons, and for the family of Dr. John Horton,\r\n    I refer you to his son, Dr. Geo. Horton, Winauskie Falls, Vt.\r\n    The Hortons seem to have been given largely to the medical\r\n    profession. When your work is accomplished, I shall be glad to\r\n    have you send me one copy.\r\n\r\n  I am yours, truly,\r\n  HIRAM HORTON.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton, the writer of the foregoing letter, was a\r\nhighly-respected member and Elder of the Presbyterian Church of\r\nMalone. He died 31 August, 1873. He was a dealer in flour, lumber,\r\nand dry-goods, real-estate, and merchandising of various kinds. Mrs.\r\nMyron G. Horton, informing me of his death, remarks that she is now\r\n(1874) the only one of his children living.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  17½ WEST 30 ST., CINCINNATI, OHIO, _May, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  DR. GEO. F. HORTON:\r\n\r\n    _Dear Sir_: While at Pomeroy a few weeks since on a visit,\r\n    my father showed me your letter, requesting information in\r\n    regard to our descent, and asked me to answer your questions.\r\n    I am not really in a condition to give you any particular\r\n    information, for the reason that the notes I once made on the\r\n    subject, when, in 1864, I graduated at Dana College, are out\r\n    of my reach. A sketch of our genealogy and history had to be\r\n    recorded in our \"Class Book,\" and I there broke ground in this\r\n    to me until then, unattractive field, in obedience to that\r\n    necessity. The main facts that I recall are, however, these:\r\n    I did not get very far in tracing my descent. My father,\r\n    Valentine B. Horton, was the son of Zenas Horton, who was the\r\n    son of David Horton--David was born near the beginning of the\r\n    last century; no! in the 2d or 3d decade, and fought in the old\r\n    French war, and was also a soldier in the Revolution, and was\r\n    killed at Saratoga. He lived in Braintree, Mass. Zenas Horton\r\n    moved thence to Windsor, Vt., where my father was born. Beyond\r\n    David I did not spend labor enough to penetrate; but I was\r\n    rendered nearly certain, I remember, that he was a grand-son\r\n    and great-grand-son, respectively, of two certain Thomas\r\n    Hortons, one of Springfield, and the other of Charlestown,\r\n    Mass., the elder of whom landed in Dorchester, from the\r\n    schooner _Mary and John_, in 1633. Barnabas, of Southold, I\r\n    remember coming across, but I was obliged, after following that\r\n    track for some time, to give him up, and settle upon Thomas,\r\n    the ancestor of David.... I shall be glad to communicate with\r\n    you further on this subject. My address I have already given at\r\n    my office (law), as above, and believe most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n  S. DANA HORTON.\r\n\r\nI have had some correspondence with this gentleman since the date of\r\nthe above letter, but he has given no further information as to his\r\nlineage. The above would run thus: 6. S. Dana; 5. Valentine B.; 4.\r\nZenas; 3. David; 2. Thomas; 1. Thomas. Some links are missing, for\r\ncertainly, counting from the first Thomas, S. Dana Horton must be in\r\nthe 8th or 9th generation. S. Dana wields the pen of a ready writer,\r\nand he has achieved considerable notoriety in the political reform\r\nliterature of the day, especially in favor of so using the elective\r\nfranchise as to give increased representation to minorities. Several\r\nof his articles have appeared in the _Penn Magazine_, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  BARRINGTON, R. I., _March 27th, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  DR. GEO. F. HORTON:\r\n\r\n    _Dear Sir_: Your letter of inquiry lies before me, supplying\r\n    more information than I shall be able to give you. Ours is a\r\n    Boston family, where my father and grandfather both resided.\r\n    We were six brothers and four sisters, all of whom lived to\r\n    their maturity, but of whom only five now survive. The eldest\r\n    of these was Rev. Jotham Horton, of whom you inquire, who died\r\n    in Boston, in Feb., 1853. His son, Rev. Jotham Horton, died, a\r\n    martyr to freedom, by the mob spirit in New Orleans, some years\r\n    ago. Our father's name was Jotham, who was a ship-smith, and\r\n    did the iron work of the historic frigate _Constitution_.\r\n\r\n    Our family being large, my parents allowed me to go into the\r\n    country (Worcester County), at the early age of seven. I was\r\n    educated a paper-maker previous to entering upon a course\r\n    of liberal education. Thus separated from home, I had less\r\n    knowledge of our ancestry than might otherwise have been the\r\n    case. Supposing that my surviving brother at Mobile has better\r\n    information regarding our ancestry than I have, I take the\r\n    liberty of forwarding your letter to him, requesting him to\r\n    supply any intelligence he may have at hand. He having been\r\n    long a resident there, and loyal to the Union, is an ex-Mayor\r\n    of the city, appointed by Gen. Pope, and is at present,\r\n    happily for him, Judge of Probate for the County. His address\r\n    is \"Hon. Gustavus Horton, Mobile, Alabama.\" From him you will\r\n    probably hear soon. Wishing you much success in your laudable\r\n    investigations, and quite willing to recognize any of our\r\n    cousins in the Keystone State,\r\n\r\n  I am yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  F. HORTON.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Francis Horton, writer of the foregoing letter, was one of\r\nthe excellent of the earth. He was a scholar and quite a poet, and\r\nan able and much loved minister of the Word. He died in 1873. It is\r\nhighly probable that he was a descendant of Joshua I.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this, we give the following thrilling article,\r\nwhich was published in the _Boston Watchman and Reflector_, soon\r\nafter the barbarous murder of the Rev. Jotham Horton:\r\n\r\n\r\n  LAST HOURS OF A NEW ORLEANS MARTYR.\r\n\r\n  AN AFFECTING SKETCH.\r\n\r\n    \"Good-by, Emma,\" he said, \"I shall not be gone long. It can't\r\n    take more than ten minutes to open the Convention, and then\r\n    I shall come right away. Look for me at three o'clock, at\r\n    farthest,\" and the young pastor kissed his wife and hurried\r\n    away to the city.\r\n\r\n    That day was destined to be one among the most memorable in the\r\n    annals of human wickedness since the famous St. Bartholomew's.\r\n    The members of the Union Convention had looked forward to\r\n    it with apprehension. They knew that the spirit of the late\r\n    rebellion still survived in New Orleans, and they could not\r\n    hope that they should be permitted to assemble without some\r\n    molestation from disorderly individuals, but they had no\r\n    suspicions that the masses of the city would rise against\r\n    them, _organized_ for deliberate bloodshed. They did not know\r\n    that all the arms had been bought up, till the gun-shops\r\n    contained not so much as a pocket-pistol. They did not know\r\n    that the Mayor had telegraphed to the President that there\r\n    would certainly be a riot, and had received the assurance that\r\n    the military would not interfere with the civil power. They\r\n    did not know that the police force had been increased by the\r\n    addition of a gang of blood-thirsty men, and that the municipal\r\n    authorities had agreed upon signals, and arranged to begin\r\n    the riot themselves. Watched by no suspicion, and awed by no\r\n    Butler's strong right hand, the conspirators were suffered to\r\n    perfect their preparations, and when the morning of the 30th\r\n    of July dawned, the treacherous officials appeared at the\r\n    station-house fully armed, and waiting the opportunity for\r\n    their bloody work.\r\n\r\n    The pastor of the Colleseum Baptist Church, Rev. Jotham W.\r\n    Horton, had been requested to open the Convention with prayer.\r\n    Moved by the warmest Christian sympathy for the freedmen,\r\n    this young New England minister had gone to the South with\r\n    his wife, to give his best energies to their welfare. He was\r\n    a man of sincere piety and a large heart; pure as a little\r\n    child, self-denying where duty was concerned to an extent that\r\n    often made him suffer, and so peaceable that though repeatedly\r\n    insulted, and even once fired upon, and though conscious that\r\n    he was fatally marked by malignant disloyalists, he would never\r\n    go armed.\r\n\r\n    After taking leave of his wife, Mr. Horton proceeded in the\r\n    cars from his residence in Carrolton to the city. Ever apt to\r\n    look hopefully on the worst prospects, and slow to suspect evil\r\n    of his fellow-men, he had felt no fears of injury for this day,\r\n    beyond perhaps a forcible seizure and commitment to the parish\r\n    prison.\r\n\r\n    The hour arriving for opening the Convention, and Mr. Horton\r\n    having entered the hall, stood up to offer prayer just as the\r\n    clock struck twelve. Strongly and fervently his words came\r\n    up, breathing petitions for the peace of his country and the\r\n    deliverance of the oppressed. God heard him, but with that\r\n    prayer His servant's work ended, and then He gave him for a\r\n    little while to the cruel wrath of his enemies, that He might\r\n    make that wrath praise Him. Immediately on the sounding of the\r\n    stroke of noon from the city clocks, and simultaneously with\r\n    the opening of Mr. Horton's prayer, the armed police filed out\r\n    of the several stations, three hundred strong, and marched\r\n    toward the Institute. Some of them entered the hall during the\r\n    prayer, a mob in the meantime rapidly collecting round the\r\n    door, and hardly had the good man uttered the closing \"amen\"\r\n    when a miscreant fired a bullet at his head.\r\n\r\n    There could be no longer any doubt of the intentions of the\r\n    officers and the mob. The latter assailed the windows and\r\n    crushed in at the doors. \"Kill him! kill him!\" they yelled.\r\n    \"Shoot every cursed Yankee in the house!\" Just then all the\r\n    bells in the city began to toll. It was the preconcerted signal\r\n    of slaughter, and now the horrors of the day began.\r\n\r\n    The disloyalist ruffians rushed in with pistols, knives and\r\n    clubs, and commenced their appointed work of murder. Resistance\r\n    was hopeless. The Convention broke up in the wildest confusion,\r\n    some of its members falling dead, and many mortally wounded in\r\n    the hall, while a few who could, fled. The Union men saw that\r\n    they were doomed. Instead of protecting them, and arresting the\r\n    rioters at the firing of the first shot, as with their force\r\n    they could easily have done, _the police headed the attack_,\r\n    and there is reason to believe that one of their number fired\r\n    the first shot.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Horton received five balls in his body, and fell. These\r\n    balls were fired by policemen. Not satisfied with their\r\n    work, they seized him, battered his head with their billies,\r\n    stabbed him, kicked and dragged him on the pavements to the\r\n    first station, the mob following behind, cursing, beating and\r\n    trampling him with their shoes. Thrusting him into a cell, he\r\n    was left mangled and senseless.\r\n\r\n    Meantime the shopkeepers of the city had closed their stores,\r\n    and strolled about, gratified spectators of the fiendish\r\n    carnival, greeting the murderers of Horton, and every squad of\r\n    policemen that passed them dragging a bleeding loyalist, with\r\n    shouts of \"Good! good! Kill the white nigger.\"\r\n\r\n    Around the Mechanics' Institute and in the adjacent streets\r\n    upwards of one hundred negroes lay weltering in their blood,\r\n    and the dead carts drove by loaded with warm corpses and\r\n    bodies of the wounded still writhing with life, all tumbled\r\n    indiscriminately together.\r\n\r\n    In one of these carts the mangled Horton was flung, after lying\r\n    awhile at the station-house, and under a stifling load of dead\r\n    and wounded negroes, his stomach crushed in by a blow of a\r\n    heavy plank, he was taken to the Marine Hospital.\r\n\r\n    Furious with the taste of blood, the police and their fellow\r\n    Thugs raged up and down some of the streets of the city,\r\n    calling out the names of well-known loyalists, declaring their\r\n    intention to slaughter every Union man in New Orleans. In the\r\n    midst of the excitement and carnage, the bayonets of Federal\r\n    troops appeared, and further murder was prevented. The mob\r\n    dispersed, and the blood-stained streets, and battered windows,\r\n    and muffled groans from distant hospital wards alone testified\r\n    to the horrors of the 30th of July.\r\n\r\n    As the hours of that bloody day passed, the wife of Mr. Horton\r\n    waited at her home, five miles distant, for his return. Three\r\n    o'clock came, the limit he had set for his absence. She looked\r\n    long and anxiously to catch a glimpse of him approaching along\r\n    the familiar street. He did not come, and her anxiety grew into\r\n    alarm. To add to her terror, a breathless messenger arrived\r\n    at her residence, and warned her that she would not be safe\r\n    there that night, for trouble had happened at the State-House,\r\n    and the secessionists were searching for all the Unionists in\r\n    the city and suburbs. Hastily summoning the negro servant, she\r\n    told her to bar the doors and windows, and with a few hurried\r\n    preparations then set off for the city, to learn the fate of\r\n    her husband.\r\n\r\n    Having formerly boarded with a Mrs. E----, she took her way\r\n    first to her house, and made known her anxious errand. She was\r\n    told of the riot and massacre, and at once feared the worst.\r\n    Several young men who boarded at the house volunteered to\r\n    search for Mr. Horton. They returned late in the evening, but\r\n    could give her no news, save that he had been badly wounded.\r\n    They dared not communicate their own convictions of his fate.\r\n\r\n    Only the darkness of the dangerous streets and the restraint of\r\n    friends prevented the almost distracted woman from going forth\r\n    that night to continue the search herself. As it was, the night\r\n    brought no sleep to her eyes, and as soon as it was morning she\r\n    started on her sad errand.\r\n\r\n    Information had been received through the city papers that Gen.\r\n    Baird, the military commandant, had released all who had been\r\n    arrested and confined by the police, giving the name of her\r\n    husband among the rest, and stating that he had returned home.\r\n    Acting on this representation, she went alone to Carrolton,\r\n    but only to return by the next train. He was not there.\r\n    Without waiting for breakfast she set off for Gen. Baird's\r\n    headquarters; a young Methodist clergyman, Mr. Henry, one of\r\n    Mrs. E----'s boarders, insisting on being her company.\r\n\r\n    No sooner did Gen. Baird see Mrs. Horton and knew who she was,\r\n    than he expressed much surprise that her husband had not been\r\n    seen, and told her he had ordered his release. Perhaps she\r\n    would find him at the City Hall. To this place she immediately\r\n    went, but she searched in vain. He had not been there. She then\r\n    hurried to the First Police Station, determined to wring from\r\n    the brutal officers a confession of what they had done with\r\n    her husband. Entering the office, she forced her way within\r\n    the rails, and asked of the clerk what had been done with her\r\n    husband. The man declared that \"Preacher Horton\" had been sent\r\n    by him to Charity Hospital, and she at once hurried thither.\r\n    Again she was disappointed. He had not been seen there! (The\r\n    truth was, the cart which carried Mr. Horton's body had stopped\r\n    there, and been sent away, as it appeared to be occupied only\r\n    by blacks.) The horrible idea now suggested itself to the\r\n    afflicted woman that her husband had been conveyed away with a\r\n    load of dead bodies, and had been buried alive, but, as a last\r\n    resort, she determined to visit the Marine Hospital. This was\r\n    in a low and distant part of the city, and devoted entirely to\r\n    negroes, and she could not have believed he would be carried\r\n    there by his worst enemies, but at a friend's suggestion she\r\n    sought the place, still accompanied by Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n    Arrived at the gate, she was refused entrance, but catching a\r\n    glimpse of Dr. Harris, the head surgeon, whom she knew, she\r\n    called to him, and asked him if her husband was there. Dr.\r\n    Harris could give her no positive assurance, but immediately\r\n    ordered the servant to admit her. Forgetting her weariness\r\n    in her joy that her long quest had at last succeeded, the\r\n    faithful woman bounded up the steps, and without waiting to be\r\n    directed, rushed in among the patients, found out her husband,\r\n    and sank exhausted upon his bosom. What a spectacle! The form\r\n    she loved a bruised and helpless mass of flesh and blood, his\r\n    head swollen to the size of two, his left arm useless, and his\r\n    right shattered and mangled. He moved perpetually about with\r\n    the restless, nervous gestures of a dreaming infant. So badly\r\n    trampled and beaten was his head and face that his eyes were\r\n    blinded, and a painful retching, produced by the injuries to\r\n    his stomach, obstructed his breath and speech. But through all\r\n    the anguish and darkness of his wreck he knew his wife. That\r\n    she should have recognized him is a miracle to all who do not\r\n    understand the inspired sagacity of a wife's affection.\r\n\r\n    \"Wipe my face, Emma,\" he gasped, as if she had been bending\r\n    over him ever since he fell.\r\n\r\n    Worn and broken-hearted, the poor woman sat down by her\r\n    husband's side, and tried to strengthen herself for the task of\r\n    soothing and comforting his last hours, for she knew too well\r\n    that he could not live. Nineteen long hours she had searched\r\n    for him, and now to find him thus!\r\n\r\n    Few comforts were to be found in that hospital, though the\r\n    attendants, seeing her distress, evidently meant to treat\r\n    her kindly. Up to this time the wounded man had lain in the\r\n    warden's room, but on the next morning, which was Wednesday,\r\n    he was removed to a more airy apartment. The operation of\r\n    trepanning was then performed on his head, though with little\r\n    hope of permanent benefit. When this was over, and the burden\r\n    upon his brain was thus relieved, the sufferer looked up and\r\n    repeated,\r\n\r\n      \"When I can read my title clear\r\n        To mansions in the skies,\r\n      I'll bid farewell to every fear,\r\n        And wipe my weeping eyes.\r\n\r\n      \"Should earth against my soul engage--\"\r\n\r\n    Here weakness prevented him, and he whispered to his wife,\r\n\r\n    \"You finish it.\"\r\n\r\n    He slept a good deal, but seemed always conscious of his wife's\r\n    presence, frequently putting up his restless hand to touch\r\n    her face, and remind himself, in his blindness, of her loved\r\n    features. When he talked, it was of his unfinished work, his\r\n    conviction of the justice of the cause in which he fell, his\r\n    anxieties for his wife, left alone in a cruel world, and of his\r\n    enemies and murderers always forgivingly, as if they knew not\r\n    what they did. At different times, too, he spoke of the riot,\r\n    relating facts and incidents as I have set them down.\r\n\r\n    It afflicted him much to leave his wife penniless. He had had a\r\n    little money in his pocket when he came to the Convention, but\r\n    that, with the gold studs in his bosom, had been plundered by\r\n    some of the ruffians who took part in mutilating his person.\r\n\r\n    Thus he lingered until the sixth day after his injury. When\r\n    the morning of Sunday, the 5th of August, came, he remembered\r\n    that he had an appointment to exchange pulpits with a colored\r\n    brother in the city, and said,\r\n\r\n    \"Emma, we must send word to Bro. Miles that I can't come. I\r\n    don't feel quite well enough to preach.\"\r\n\r\n    As time went on, his mind began to wander, and he fancied\r\n    himself in his own pulpit. He invoked the Divine blessing, he\r\n    gave out a hymn and sung, wounded and suffering as he was;\r\n    his wife, who wept as she thought of the melody of his own\r\n    fine voice, joining him at his request, half choked by her\r\n    tears. Then he prayed with her, sung again, and preached,\r\n    taking for his text, \"Out of the abundance of the heart the\r\n    mouth speaketh.\" After these exercises, he expressed his wish\r\n    to close with the Lord's Supper, and immediately began the\r\n    beautiful ceremony. His wife, anxious to gratify him, skilfully\r\n    aided with such meagre conveniences as were at hand, to carry\r\n    out his touching fancy. He partook with her what seemed to him\r\n    the symbolic bread and wine.\r\n\r\n    \"We both drink from the same cup, Emma,\" said he.\r\n\r\n    Another hymn, a benediction, and the sufferer began to grow\r\n    weak, as if, indeed, his work was done.\r\n\r\n    \"I am going now, Emma,\" he whispered. \"I'm sorry you can't come\r\n    with me. In the fall you'll come.\"\r\n\r\n    Then there were no more connected sentences, but incoherent\r\n    syllables of prayer, and whispers of saintly hope, \"In the\r\n    vale--the vale--home yonder--good-by,\" and at six o'clock that\r\n    Sabbath evening the gentle-spirited Horton fell asleep in Jesus.\r\n\r\n    Thus perished a martyr to freedom and equal rights, as sincere\r\n    and pure a man as God ever welcomed \"through great tribulation\"\r\n    to the immortal pleasures of His presence.\r\n\r\n    To the tender consideration of her friends, never so numerous\r\n    as now, and to the merciful consolation of Almighty God, who\r\n    never pitied her as He now pities her, we commend the weeping\r\n    widow, and pray that she may long live to share the honor of\r\n    her martyred husband's fame.\r\n\r\n  THERON BROWN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  MONSON, MASS., _May 27th, 1874_.\r\n\r\n  A. E. HORTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    _My Dear Sir_: I have received several copies of the \"_San\r\n    Diego Union_,\" the last No., April 30, also a copy of the\r\n    \"_World_,\" March 20th, which contains a picture of San Diego.\r\n    Also a sketch of the city on a small sheet, which gives an\r\n    account of the origin of the new city, and of your relation to\r\n    it as the founder and the source of its enterprise.\r\n\r\n    For these favors I desire to express my cordial thanks. The\r\n    growth of your new city is indeed wonderful, and a brilliant\r\n    future is certain to come. Were I a young man, the temptation\r\n    would be strong to cross the continent and join in your great\r\n    enterprise. But my future is short, and must be devoted to the\r\n    commemoration of the past.\r\n\r\n    It has so happened that in my work as the genealogist of my\r\n    native town of Union, I have recently devoted special efforts\r\n    to the two families of _Horton_ and _Burleigh_. Dr. Horton, of\r\n    Terrytown, Pa., proposes to publish the annals of the Horton\r\n    family in this country, nearly all of whom are the posterity of\r\n    BARNABAS, who came from England.\r\n\r\n    I have in charge the genealogy of Rev. Ezra Horton, your\r\n    grandfather, and have nearly completed the collection of nearly\r\n    all his descendants of the fourth generation (to which you\r\n    belong), from Rev. Ezra, of Union. I have the names, with dates\r\n    of birth, of three of your father's children who (including\r\n    yourself) were born in Union. The rest of your father's family\r\n    I have not. I desire very much to obtain a complete list of\r\n    all the children of your father's family, with date of births,\r\n    marriages, and deaths, so far as possible. I understand that\r\n    your father is still living, though at an advanced age. I have\r\n    an obituary notice of your mother, published in a San Diego\r\n    paper soon after her death, a year ago last March.\r\n\r\n    Rev. Lucien Burleigh, the son of _Rinaldo Burleigh_, of\r\n    Plainfield, Conn., is endeavoring to obtain a complete record\r\n    of all the descendants of _John Burleigh_, the first comer of\r\n    the name to which your mother belonged. Your mother was first\r\n    cousin to Rinaldo Burleigh, who was a long time Principal of\r\n    Plainfield Academy, and the father of a number of sons who are\r\n    well known as writers, and as editors.\r\n\r\n    I visited Union last week, and saw my uncle, Capt. Chauncey\r\n    Paul, and his wife, whose name before marriage was Polly\r\n    Armour, daughter of John Armour. They both recollect your\r\n    father and mother. John Armour was a near neighbor of Mr. Jacob\r\n    Burleigh, and the children of the families grew up together.\r\n\r\n    The effort of Rev. Lucien Burleigh will result in obtaining\r\n    full accounts of all branches of his family. I was able to give\r\n    him a full account of the children of the first comer, _John_,\r\n    and his wife, _Meriam Fuller_, whose ancestry I have traced far\r\n    back among the early settlers of Willington and Ashford, in\r\n    Conn., and in Rehoboth, Mass.\r\n\r\n    My interest in the two families of Horton and Burleigh, arises\r\n    not from the recent efforts to procure genealogies of those\r\n    two families by parties specially interested. I have long been\r\n    engaged in collecting facts pertaining to the history of Union,\r\n    my native town. I have made it a point to study the history of\r\n    all the early settlers and long residents. I have traced the\r\n    ancestry of very many back to England and Scotland, through the\r\n    Scotch-Irish emigration, which took place nearly one hundred\r\n    and sixty years ago. Very many of the early settlers of Union\r\n    were Scotch-Irish--as the Pauls, the Lawlors, the Moores, the\r\n    Armours, the Crawfords, the McNalls, and others who, like all\r\n    the race, were genuine Scotch in their character, and were\r\n    among the best of the emigrants of the olden times. They were\r\n    not connected at all with the modern or ancient Irish race.\r\n\r\n    The Hortons, Burleighs, and Laflins were genuine Englishmen in\r\n    their ancestry. So were the Fosters, the Badgers, the Sessions,\r\n    the Newells, the Loomises, the Abbotts, and the Waleses.\r\n\r\n    From that little town, a great many enterprising emigrants have\r\n    gone forth to people the mighty West. The people of Union,\r\n    in respect to enterprise and education, are higher than the\r\n    average emigration of towns in Connecticut and Massachusetts.\r\n    My long and patient explorations into the history of Union, has\r\n    led me to such results as that I am not ashamed of the fame or\r\n    the name of my native town.\r\n\r\n    Having lost all my own children, and always cherishing a\r\n    sincere regard for the people of Union, I determined long ago\r\n    to find out all I could of their history and the fortunes of\r\n    their descendants.\r\n\r\n    The old town holds its own in population and in valuation. I\r\n    have a good memory of all who have lived there during the last\r\n    half century, and I think the town is as respectable now as it\r\n    was in my childhood. Some of the worthy names of the olden time\r\n    have wholly gone; though the descendants of some remain.\r\n\r\n    It is an interesting circumstance, that from that little town\r\n    _you_ have gone forth, and on the other side of the new world\r\n    have laid the foundations of a great city. Thus New England has\r\n    sent forth its best mind and muscle to build up new States in\r\n    this greatest Empire of freemen the sun has ever shone upon.\r\n\r\n    New England was founded by the best people of Old England\r\n    and Scotland. I like to look back, and also forward. It is\r\n    well that all parts of our great country can be able to trace\r\n    their origin to common sources. Great as are the intervening\r\n    distances in time and space which separate the different\r\n    generations, yet are they not wholly severed in interest, nor\r\n    ought they to be separated in sympathy. I hope that my long\r\n    studies in relation to the families of my native town, will\r\n    be of some benefit in making those of the same name somewhat\r\n    acquainted with each other; or at least it will prevent those\r\n    who are of kindred race and blood from utter forgetfulness of\r\n    each other.\r\n\r\n  Very Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n  C. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Hammond, writer of the foregoing letter, is, and has\r\nbeen for many years past, the Principal of Monson Academy. His work\r\nis nearly ready for the press.
