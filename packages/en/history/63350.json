Consequently, many furnishings have disappeared, because\r\na guard could, naturally, not be posted. In the whole East, the\r\nadministration has found terrible conditions of living quarters, and\r\nthe chances of procurement are so limited that it is not practical to\r\nprocure any more. Therefore, I beg the Fuehrer to permit the seizure of\r\nall Jewish home furnishings of Jews in Paris, who have fled, or will\r\nleave shortly, and that of Jews living in all parts of the occupied\r\nWest, to relieve the shortage of furnishings in the administration in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\n2. A great number of leading Jews were, after a short examination in\r\nParis, again released. The attempts on the lives of members of the\r\narmed forces have not stopped, on the contrary they continue. This\r\nreveals an unmistakable plan to disrupt the German-French cooperation,\r\nto force Germany to retaliate, and, with this, evoke a new defense\r\non the part of the French against Germany. I suggest to the Fuehrer\r\nthat, instead of executing 100 Frenchmen, we substitute 100 Jewish\r\nbankers, lawyers, etc. It is the Jews in London and New York who incite\r\nthe French communists to commit acts of violence, and it seems only\r\nfair that the members of this race should pay for this. It is not the\r\n_little_ Jews, but the _leading_ Jews in France, who should be held\r\nresponsible. That would tend to awaken the Anti-Jewish sentiment.\r\n\r\n  BERLIN 18 Dec 1941\r\n  R/H\r\n\r\n  signed: A. ROSENBERG\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPY OF DOCUMENT 001-A-PS\r\n\r\n  19 November 1945\r\n\r\nI, Major William H. Coogan, 0-455814, Q.M.C., a commissioned officer of\r\nthe Army of the United States of America, do hereby certify as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The United States Chief of Counsel in July 1945 charged the Field\r\nBranch of the Documentation Division with the responsibility of\r\ncollecting, evaluating and assembling documentary evidence in the\r\nEuropean Theater for use in the prosecution of the major Axis war\r\ncriminals before the International Military Tribunal. I was appointed\r\nChief of the Field Branch on 20 July 1945. I am now the Chief of the\r\nDocumentation Division, Office of United States Chief of Counsel.\r\n\r\n2. I have served in the United States Army for more than four years\r\nand am a practicing attorney by profession. Based upon my experience\r\nas an attorney and as a United States Army officer, I am familiar with\r\nthe operation of the United States Army in connection with seizing\r\nand processing captured enemy documents. In my capacity as Chief of\r\nthe Documentation Division, Office of the United States Chief of\r\nCounsel, I am familiar with and have supervised the processing, filing,\r\ntranslation and photostating of all documentary evidence for the United\r\nStates Chief of Counsel.\r\n\r\n3. As the Army overran German occupied territory and then Germany\r\nitself, certain specialized personnel seized enemy documents, books,\r\nand records for information of strategic and tactical value. During\r\nthe early stages such documents were handled in bulk, and assembled\r\nat temporary centers. However, after the surrender of Germany, they\r\nwere transported to the various document centers established by Army\r\nHeadquarters in the United States Zone of Occupation. In addition\r\nto the documents actually assembled at such document centers, Army\r\npersonnel maintained and secured considerable documents \"in situ\" at\r\nor near the place of discovery. When such documents were located and\r\nassembled they were catalogued by Army personnel into collections and\r\nrecords were maintained which disclosed the source and such other\r\ninformation available concerning the place and general circumstances\r\nsurrounding the acquisition of the documents.\r\n\r\n4. The Field Branch of the Documentation Division was staffed by\r\npersonnel thoroughly conversant with the German language. Their task\r\nwas to search for and select captured enemy documents in the European\r\nTheater which disclosed information relating to the prosecution of\r\nthe major Axis war criminals. Officers under my command were placed\r\non duty at various document centers and also dispatched on individual\r\nmissions to obtain original documents. When documents were located, my\r\nrepresentatives made a record of the circumstances under which they\r\nwere found and all information available concerning their authenticity\r\nwas recorded. Such documents were further identified by Field Branch\r\npre-trial serial numbers, assigned by my representatives who would then\r\nperiodically dispatch the original documents by courier to the Office\r\nof the United States Chief of Counsel.\r\n\r\n5. Upon receipt of these documents they were duly recorded and indexed.\r\nAfter this operation, they were delivered to the Screening and Analysis\r\nBranch of the Documentation Division of the Office of United States\r\nChief of Counsel, which Branch re-examined such documents in order to\r\nfinally determine whether or not they should be retained as evidence\r\nfor the prosecutors. This final screening was done by German-speaking\r\nanalysts on the staff of the United States Chief of Counsel. When the\r\ndocument passed the screeners, it was then transmitted to the Document\r\nRoom of the Office of United States Chief of Counsel, with a covering\r\nsheet prepared by the screeners showing the title or nature of the\r\ndocument, the personalities involved, and its importance. In the\r\nDocument Room, a trial identification number was given to each document\r\nor to each group of documents, in cases where it was desirable for the\r\nsake of clarity to file several documents together.\r\n\r\n6. United States documents were given trial identification numbers in\r\none of five series designated by the letters: \"PS\", \"L\", \"R\", \"C\", and\r\n\"EC\", indicating the means of acquisition of the documents. Within each\r\nseries documents were listed numerically.\r\n\r\n7. After a document was so numbered, it was then sent to a\r\nGerman-speaking analyst who prepared a summary of the document with\r\nappropriate references to personalities involved, index headings,\r\ninformation as to the source of the document as indicated by the Field\r\nBranch, and the importance of the document to a particular phase of the\r\ncase. Next, the original document was returned to the Document Room\r\nand then checked out to the photostating department, where photostatic\r\ncopies were made. Upon return from photostating, it was placed in an\r\nenvelope in one of several fireproof safes in the rear of the Document\r\nRoom. One of the photostatic copies of the document was sent to the\r\ntranslators, thereafter leaving the original itself in the safe. A\r\ncommissioned officer has been, and is, responsible for the security of\r\nthe documents in the safe. At all times when he is not present the safe\r\nis locked and a military guard is on duty outside the only door. If the\r\nofficers preparing the certified translation, or one of the officers\r\nworking on the briefs, found it necessary to examine the original\r\ndocument, this was done within the Document Room in the section set\r\naside for that purpose. The only exception to this strict rule has\r\nbeen where it has been occasionally necessary to present the original\r\ndocument to the defendants for examination. In this case, the document\r\nwas entrusted to a responsible officer of the prosecution staff.\r\n\r\n8. All original documents are now located in safes in the Document\r\nRoom, where they will be secured until they are presented by the\r\nprosecution to the court during the progress of the trial.\r\n\r\n9. Some of the documents which will be offered in evidence by the\r\nUnited States Chief of Counsel were seized and processed by the British\r\nArmy. Also, personnel from the Office of the United States Chief of\r\nCounsel and the British War Crimes Executive have acted jointly in\r\nlocating, seizing and processing such documents.\r\n\r\n10. Substantially the same system of acquiring documentary evidence was\r\nutilized by the British Army and the British War Crimes Executive as\r\nthat hereinabove set forth with respect to the United States Army and\r\nthe Office of the United States Chief of Counsel.\r\n\r\n11. Therefore, I certify in my official capacity as hereinabove stated,\r\nto the best of my knowledge and belief, that the documents captured\r\nin the British Zone of Operations and Occupation, which will be\r\noffered in evidence by the United States Chief of Counsel, have been\r\nauthenticated, translated, and processed in substantially the same\r\nmanner as hereinabove set forth with respect to the operations of the\r\nUnited States Chief of Counsel.\r\n\r\n12. Finally, I certify, that all Documentary evidence offered by the\r\nUnited States Chief of Counsel, including those documents from British\r\nArmy sources, are in the same condition as captured by the United\r\nStates and British Armies; that they have been translated by competent\r\nand qualified translators; that all photostatic copies are true and\r\ncorrect copies of the originals and that they have been correctly\r\nfiled, numbered and processed as above outlined.\r\n\r\n  [Signed] WILLIAM H.

As for the small part used for the\r\nenlarging of scientific research possibilities, it pertains exclusively\r\nto such affairs that can be carried out only with the material\r\n(prisoners), which is accessible to the Waffen SS and can therefore not\r\nbe undertaken by any other experimental agency.\r\n\r\nI cannot object therefore on the part of the Reich Experimental Counsel\r\nagainst the budget of the Surgeon General-SS and Police.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Mentzel\r\n  Ministerialdirektor\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n  Reich Leader SS\r\n  Reich Surgeon SS and Police\r\n  File: 135/ Secret / 43 TG, NR 24/43 geh.\r\n\r\n  Berlin 26 Feb 43\r\n\r\n  Subj.: Scientific Institutes\r\n  Ref to: Correspondence of 19 Feb. 43 Rf. 234/43 SR.--\r\n  To the Head of the Executive Counsel of the Reich Research\r\n  Counsel Ministerialdirektor Mentzel\r\n\r\n  Berlin-Steglitz\r\n  Grunewaldstrasse 35\r\n\r\n  My dear Ministerialdirektor:\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment of your letter of the 19th Feb 1943, I am able to\r\nreply the following to it today:\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for the 53 key positions for my office which you made\r\nthe basis of your memorandum was planned for peace times.\r\n\r\nThe special institutes of the SS which are to be partly staffed through\r\nthis appropriation are to serve the purpose to establish and make\r\naccessible for the entire realm of scientific research, the particular\r\npossibilities of research only possessed by the SS.\r\n\r\nIn view of the further developments of this war, I have already shelved\r\nthis plan for the time being as the result of negotiations with\r\nthe Reich Finance Minister in the past year, so that my authorized\r\npersonnel amounts to 25 key positions only. Of these positions, only 5\r\nare filled at present.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances your objections with regard to an\r\nunreasonable overlapping of work of scientific institutes for the war's\r\nduration are void.\r\n\r\nI will gladly be at your disposal at any time, however, to discuss the\r\nparticular research aims in connection with the SS, which I would like\r\nto start after the war according to the direction of the Reich leader\r\nSS.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is important that these researches--once their\r\nrealization appears possible, will be tied in with the related research\r\naims of the state.\r\n\r\nHoping to have served you with my preliminary summary, I remain with\r\nbest greetings and\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  GRAWITZ\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  25 March 1943\r\n\r\n  Pres. of Reich Research Counsel\r\n  Head of Executive Counsel\r\n  To the Surgeon General SS and Police SS Lt.

Since the work of the state chief of research\r\nstarted originally in the armament department, I was unable to clear\r\nup any questions pertaining to the medical department, which came up\r\nin the last weeks. But I shall do so in the near future, and I believe\r\nI can already say that the new institutes requested by the surgeon\r\ngeneral of SS and police will be unnecessary since other institutes can\r\ncover these planned missions.\r\n\r\nI shall have a conference with the surgeon general SS and police\r\npertaining to details of this planned work and, at that time, I shall\r\nlet you know what my final stand will be.

Gr. C3-38). The organization\r\nplan shows that the surgeon general SS and police plans not only\r\nspecial experts for \"Research\" in pharmaceutical chemistry, in dental\r\nand clinical services and a special section of scientific service, but\r\nalso that plans are desired for a string of institutes which likewise\r\ndeal mainly with research work:\r\n\r\n  1. Central Institute for Medical Scientific Exploitation\r\n  2. Institute for the History of Medicine\r\n  3. Pharmaceutical Chemistry Research Institute\r\n  4. Pharmacy for Military Requirements\r\n  5. Special Institute Sachenhausen\r\n  6. Pathological Institute\r\n  7. Hygienic Research Institute\r\n\r\nIn the informal discussions it was referred to the fact that the plans\r\nfor the research arrangements for the Waffen-SS can only be granted if\r\nthe research missions which the Surgeon General SS embarked upon are\r\nnot already undertaken by other independent institutes, resp. by the\r\nuniversities, or belong to their sphere.\r\n\r\nThe Hygienic Institute, according to the proposed plan, includes the\r\nfollowing seven divisions:\r\n\r\n 1. Division for combating epidemics with bacteriological and\r\n serological laboratories\r\n\r\n 2. Division for hygiene with corresponding laboratories\r\n\r\n 3. Division for chemistry with chemical laboratories\r\n\r\n 4. Division for geology and hydrology\r\n\r\n  [Reich Research Counsel\r\n  In care of Ministerialdirektor, Prof. Dr. Mentzel]\r\n\r\n 5. Division for climatology and geography, especially in preparation\r\n for cultural waging of war in sub tropical and tropical lands in Africa\r\n\r\n 6. Division for statistics and epidemic forecast which will, with new\r\n developments, work against the spreading of epidemics for the coming\r\n years\r\n\r\n 7. Division for the elimination of epidemics which will chiefly\r\n concern itself with new installation of apparatus for delousing and\r\n sterilization of drinking water for the fighting troops\r\n\r\nI lack accurate data for other institutes. I have set aside the\r\ndecision on this budget.\r\n\r\nRegarding the decree of the Fuehrer of the 9th June 42, (RGBL. I, 389),\r\nand the emphasized necessity of coordinated scientific research, I ask\r\nfor your immediate opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\n  By order of\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. Bender\r\n  Certified Cunsich Chief Tax Secretary\r\n\r\n  (RGBL I 389)\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 003-PS\r\n\r\nA Short Report of the Activity of the Foreign Policy Office (APA)\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Foreign Policy Office (APA) of the National\r\nSocialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) could not from its founding be\r\nconsidered a replica of the development of the Foreign Office, but is\r\nrestricted in a very definite manner. From the entire foreign policy\r\ncomplex the following concrete problems have been selected:\r\n\r\n_The German-English Relationship, the North Eastern Region, the South\r\nEastern Region (Danube Region) along with boundary peoples holding\r\ninterests in these regions, and Soviet Russia._\r\n\r\nWith the realization that the entire present day foreign policy is tied\r\ntogether in the closest manner with the question of foreign trade, a\r\ndefinite division was established to deal with this subject. Thus the\r\nfollowing divisions were set up in the APA.:\r\n\r\nEngland, the North, the South-East Region, the Near East, Foreign\r\nTrade, and the Press.\r\n\r\n_1. England_: The attempts to find persons in England who had the\r\ndesire to understand the German movement date back to 1929. Our English\r\nagent R. in Berlin made possible my first trip to London in 1931. There\r\na number of connections were made which worked out well in a practical\r\nfashion to bring about a German-English understanding. Above all was\r\nGroup Leader W., member of the Air General Staff, who was firmly of\r\nthe belief that Germany and England must stand together in the defense\r\nagainst the Bolshevist danger. These different voicings of opinions had\r\nthe result that the circle in the English Air General Staff enlarged\r\nand the Flying Club became a center of German-English understanding.\r\nIn 1934 Group Leader W. came to Germany where he was received by the\r\nFuehrer (Hitler). The utterances of the Fuehrer had the result to\r\nfurther strengthen these already favorably inclined policies, and since\r\nthis time this cordiality has not been broken. The Air General Staff\r\nalways inquired of us what they could state to refute the anti-German\r\nelements in London in a manner favorable to us. The German arguments\r\nwere then applied in a corresponding manner. In contrast to certain\r\nEnglish persons who would speak out very fervently for Germany, only\r\nto speak the contrary some months later, this staunch group, namely,\r\nthe Air General Staff which was run by the younger officers, had proven\r\nitself to be a solid and conscious support in all changing situations.\r\nNot least in this influence was the great speech of Baldwin of the\r\nprevious year in which he promised Germany the right to air protection.\r\nThe English periodical \"The Airplane\" which is printed under the\r\nguidance of the Air General Staff, began to express against Bolshevism\r\nin an always increasing sharper tone, and always declared, when there\r\nwas agitation against German militarism, that one could today feel\r\nwell pleased if Germany had a strong air force to combat the Asiatic\r\nbarbarism. The English ministers who did not wish to adopt this point\r\nof view were sharply criticized. In the change of foreign ministers the\r\npro-French candidate for foreign office was not selected, but rather\r\nthe ex-Minister of Air, Samuel Hoare, who till this day still keeps\r\nup his personal contacts with the Air Ministry. Upon his request a\r\nmemorandum on the spiritual foundation of national socialism, inspired\r\nby us, was translated to him; it being his desire to understand our\r\nmovement more fully.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of MacDonald this feeling of cordiality was supported\r\nthrough the private secretary of MacDonald, Mr. Badlow whom I also met\r\nin 1933 and with whom I had extensive discussions. Since this time he\r\nhas constantly been informed through us, and has had more than one\r\nheated difference of opinion with MacDonald over this subject.\r\n\r\nA resulting activity of this connection with the British Air General\r\nStaff was the establishment of a liaison between our Air Ministry\r\nand the British fliers. However, before it was possible for us to\r\nreveal our armament, W. revealed to me on official stationery of the\r\nBritish Air Ministry, a representative of the airplane motor factory\r\nwhich was engaged in producing motors for the British Air Force,\r\nand which said representative I later met here in Berlin. Since the\r\nGerman industry itself had attained production capacity by now, this\r\nalmost official British offer for German air arming could not be fully\r\naccepted. However, the Chief of our England Division (Kapitaenleutnant\r\nObermueller, reserve) took two representatives of the German Air\r\nMinistry to London and himself undertook several trips to London. He\r\nwas the first German to receive an invitation from the vice-Air Marshal\r\nto view the British Air Force and British air strength. The APA had\r\nplaced an automobile at the disposal of this same Air Marshal in which\r\nto tour Germany when he was in Germany last year. A firmer bond has\r\nalso been accomplished between our English Division and Henry Deterding\r\nand his associates. Misunderstandings in matter of taxes pertaining to\r\nthe German possessions of Deterding could be removed, thus preventing\r\na change of management in respect to Deterding and the Shell Works\r\nwhereby Germany would have lost some large contracts.\r\n\r\nAt the close of last year we received the message that the King\r\nof England has expressed himself to be very dissatisfied over the\r\nofficial press agency. The visit of the Duke of Kent to Munich had\r\nmade matters still worse pertaining to the King's views on the press\r\nagency. Consequently we one day received the request from London to\r\nmake possible that our English agent take a trip to London in order\r\nto orient the Duke of Kent in every detail pertaining to national\r\nsocialism in order to convey this information to the King. R. went with\r\nme to London exactly as requested and there had an over three hour\r\nlong unobserved conference with the Duke of Kent, who then conveyed\r\nthis to the King of England. One can assume that this instruction has\r\nserved its purpose and exerted a definite strengthening pressure for\r\nchange of cabinet and head it in a direction of closer cordiality for\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nA number of Englishmen were invited to the Party Day of 1934, of which\r\nsome at least portrayed a favorable attitude towards Germany. Above\r\nall was Captain McCaw, semi-official counsel of the English Ministry\r\nof War and liaison man between other ministries. McCaw was previously\r\nadjutant to Lord Kitchener, and as we ascertained, has worked for a\r\nGerman-British understanding in official quarters. Besides, there was\r\nalso the truly enthusiastic adjutant of the Duke of Connaught (uncle of\r\nthe English King), Archibald Boyle, who was called upon all matters of\r\nforeign policy by the Air Transport Ministry, and who worked for the\r\nsame purpose. To these important contacts may be added a great number\r\nof other connections with British politicians, officers, and members of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIt naturally is to be understood that other personalities of the Nazi\r\nParty (NSDAP) had important connections in England and have utilized\r\nthem. In conclusion I believe I can say that the England Division of\r\nthe Foreign Policy Office (APA), in spite of many difficulties and\r\ncounter-currents upon which I will not enter any further, has done\r\nits duty in the special purpose of helping to create a German-English\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n_2. Northern Division_: The winning over of the Scandinavian\r\ncountries to the side of Germany appears as a foregone necessity for\r\nfuture German foreign policy, but the necessity is also as great to\r\nprevent the Scandinavian countries from making a clean entry into\r\nthe circle of anti-German countries. The political possibilities\r\ntowards these Marxist governments were extremely difficult. Trade\r\npolicies, according to my belief, have suffered most through sins\r\nof omissions, hence the APA restricted itself more to the cultural\r\npolitical field. For this purpose it expanded the Nordic (Scandinavian)\r\nSociety. This formerly small society has grown to be a decisive bond\r\nin the German-Scandinavian relationship since its support by the\r\nAPA two years ago. The society's leader, Lohse, is selected by the\r\nAPA. The offices in all sections [Gau] are headed by corresponding\r\nsection chiefs [Gauleiter]. Trade groups and other organizations and\r\nbranches of the party which have dealings with Scandinavia have come\r\nto agreement so that almost all of the traffic between Germany and\r\nScandinavia today passes through the hands of the Nordic Society. The\r\nsociety has to date celebrated in Germany all memorial days of great\r\nNordic scientists and artists (Hamsun, Holberg, Heidenstam) and has\r\nbrought a number of Nordic conductors to Germany, as well as having\r\nfurthered Nordic literature. Through its periodical \"The North\" [Der\r\nNorden] thoughts have been exchanged. Finally, personal relations were\r\nincreasingly favored through conventions. Especially was the Convention\r\nof 1935 a complete success. This convention met under the sanctity\r\nof the Scandinavian ministers in Germany and the German ministers in\r\nScandinavia, as far as it applied to the Nordic Music Conclave as the\r\nmain purpose of the convention. The committee was composed of the\r\nauthoritative Nordic Music Society. Fourteen sold out concerts and over\r\n200 Scandinavian visitors attest to the success of the convention.\r\n\r\nThereupon the First National Finnish Art Exhibition came to Germany,\r\nfollowed by the request of the Finnish Government to the APA to hold a\r\nGerman exposition in Helsinki in March of 1936. These psychologically\r\nvaluable affiliations have undoubtedly loosened the tension in many\r\ncircles and it would do well for a clever trade policy to make use\r\nof this loosened tension, as for example, the trade treaties between\r\nEngland and Finland expire in 1936. The Chief of the Northern Division\r\nis my private secretary, Thilo von Trotha.\r\n\r\n_3. Southeast (Danube-Region)_: Since the Fuehrer (Hitler) has reserved\r\nAustria for his own, the APA has relayed on to the responsible places\r\nany reports from Austria, and has not dealt in Austrian politics.\r\nRelations with Hungary were immediately established. The APA invited\r\nPremier Gombos to Berlin in 1933 for a private visit where he was\r\npresented to the Fuehrer. The Fuehrer took him along to Erfurt to\r\nobserve a review of the SA. Specific discussions were undertaken with\r\nHungary to convince her of the futility of her demands for 100 percent\r\nrevision of boundaries. Finally in August of 1935 I spoke with his\r\nexcellence von Angian and made clear to him that although we well\r\nunderstood her own interests, the necessity that Hungary must decline\r\nits revision demands upon Yugoslavia and Rumania and address its\r\ndemands to Czechoslovakia. One can assume that the Hungarians are now\r\nready to realize the necessity of the boundary revisions as proposed.\r\n\r\nExceptionally long and drawn out discussions were in process with\r\nRumania because definite measures were necessary, not because we did\r\nnot wish to be intervening in Rumanian affairs without being called,\r\nbut because we had to await the attitude of the Party as a result of\r\nthe King of Rumania sending a friend to Berlin. Here on Rumanian\r\nsoil a bitter battle was going on between the pro-French Titulesco\r\nand Jewish elements on one side against the anti-Jewish elements on\r\nthe other side. The King is well aware of the fact that in the end\r\nhis support of Bolshevism may cost him his throne. However, he is\r\nso intimidated by the threats of France, so as not to call for an\r\nelection, and hopes only that the powers of the people, which are\r\nmounting against Titulesco, are so strong that he can support himself\r\nupon the will of the people. In order to create unity of expression\r\nthe APA suggested formation of a large German-Rumanian Chamber of\r\nCommerce in Berlin. The profits of this business were not to benefit\r\nany private associates, but were to go to those groups that worked for\r\na German-Rumanian understanding. Because of a false report of Herr von\r\nNeurath to the Fuehrer (Hitler) in which it was stated as though the\r\naction were taken in the name of the Fuehrer, the work was delayed\r\nand hindered and finally stopped, even though all of the ministers\r\nconcerned had agreed to the plan. Through this many costly months\r\nwere lost and the APA was forced to try other means. Since it was not\r\npossible to work with money, many conferences were arranged between the\r\ncoming Premier Goga. Finally, an agreement which had been considered\r\nimpossible, was concluded between Goga and the anti-Semitic leader\r\nCuza. Cuza, upon my wish, deleted several points from his program,\r\nafter which he informed us that it was necessary in the interest of his\r\nfatherland (Rumania) and a German-Rumanian understanding that he comply\r\nwith my wish, as he had recognized in me an unyielding anti-Semite. I\r\nhave informed the Fuehrer of the complicated later relationships in\r\nnumerous reports. Germany is fighting France and Bolshevism in Rumania,\r\nand when affairs have progressed so as to warrant further discussion,\r\nthe King of Rumania will invite me to a visit to discuss the matter\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nFeelers have been sent out to Belgrade through Rumania. Here also\r\nexists the possibility of splitting the \"lesser entente,\" but as far\r\nas I can ascertain, Yugoslavia is not considering withdrawal from this\r\nalliance singly under certain guarantees, but will withdraw together\r\nwith Rumania. The work in Rumania has to a part been undertaken by Herr\r\nDuckwitz, but especially by Party-Member Schickedanz.\r\n\r\n_The Near East_: Next it was necessary that the position of the\r\nnational socialistic movement be secured not only within the confines\r\nof the Party but also in public life. This was the more so necessary\r\nsince the old Rapallo Treaty was constantly being discussed in the\r\nuniversities in numerous lectures. In relation with this was the Near\r\nEast Ideology of Moeller van dem Brock which exerted its influence\r\ndeep within the Party. The APA proceeded in the most tenacious fashion\r\nto prevent the proponents of the Rapallo school from coming to the\r\nuniversities, although this was not always possible. The APA prevented\r\nthat instructional lectures of the School of Rapallo and Moeller van\r\ndem Brock were held within the Party and other societies. Through the\r\nReich Ministry for the Furtherance of German Literature were issued\r\nmany sharp criticisms over the eastern ideology of Moeller van dem\r\nBrock to all government and party offices. Furthermore, Dr. Leibrandt,\r\nthe Chief of the Near East Division delivered several speeches on\r\nthis matter to Party Conventions, student societies, and so forth.\r\nIt was this activity which caused the APA to make enemies with many\r\ngovernmental offices until the Fuehrer in his speech of May 21 set\r\nforth the authenticity of this work and forced a withdrawal of those\r\nwho opposed this activity of the APA. From there on the Near East\r\nDivision has pursued the entire current Russian political activity,\r\ncollected and examined current Russian reports, made an exact study of\r\nthe minority feelings in Russia, and contacted anti-Soviet circles,\r\nalthough only for purposes of study. The Near East Division has\r\nsupplied other divisions, namely the English Division with necessary\r\nmaterial about Russia, as well as making available to the Press\r\nDivision material for \"Dem Voelkischen Beobachter\" [official Nazi Party\r\nnewspaper].\r\n\r\n_Foreign Trade_: In all these political connections the question of\r\nforeign trade played an important part. Reluctantly one must say that\r\nit was just in this field, according to my view, that much opportunity\r\nhas been lost. First of all, the Manchuko Incident, which came to\r\nthe attention of the Fuehrer, was without question sabotaged in the\r\nworst fashion by the Foreign Offices in Berlin and Tokio. Still, it\r\nis of significance that the form of the reciprocal trade treaties\r\nwhich were written up by the Foreign Trade Division serve as models\r\nfor many other governmental treaties. In many instances the division\r\nwas able to establish order when things had been greatly neglected,\r\nas the German-Finnish Discussions (for which the chief of the Foreign\r\nTrade Division received the Finnish decoration), the German-Norwegian\r\nWal Agreement, and a great number of other questions. Problems dealing\r\nwith the foreign trade of Germany and the middle east (Turkey and Iran)\r\nwere also attacked. One may say today that a very cheerful cooperation\r\nhas been established in this field between the representatives of the\r\nForeign Office and our Foreign Trade Division. The German-Rumanian\r\nquestion was tackled by our Foreign Trade Division during all this\r\ntime, but unfortunately did not produce the desired results. The\r\nForeign Trade Division produced a stimulus for German industry on the\r\nquestion of German-Russian credit. As things stood, greedy circles\r\nin heavy industry threatened the interests of the medium and small\r\nindustries whom they were willing to sacrifice for the tempting\r\nSoviet business. Seventy million marks would have been lost in this\r\ndeal because Russia would not accept the decisions of the Board of\r\nArbitration, while heavy industry was willing to forego this sum.\r\nThrough the intervention of the APA the situation was changed. Shortly\r\nthereafter the Board of Arbitration again met and acknowledged the\r\nclaims of little and medium business, and divided among the several\r\ncategories, thus saving the German Reich 70 million marks.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Trade Division worked under the theory, that the question\r\nof foreign trade would be a rapid development, and therefore formulated\r\nexact recommendations in the discussions. The recommended foreign trade\r\ndrafts, as were recommended in these discussions, were not refuted by\r\nWagemann nor Josias Stamp in London. Opposition, however, has arisen\r\nin the Reich Ministry of Commerce, which apparently, however, has not\r\ngiven the matter a very exact examination. Thus the matter rests.\r\nGerman foreign trade has not progressed, and the forced taxation by\r\nmeans of export duties of over 700 million marks for German industry in\r\n1935 can only be considered an emergency measure and not a fundamental\r\npolicy. Here again the APA recommends to the Fuehrer to give these\r\nproposals a trial.\r\n\r\nParty Member Daitz has worked with initiative on questions of foreign\r\ntrade. Party Member Malletke, who has proven himself to be a far-seeing\r\nassociate, has conducted the daily administration and the examination\r\nof all problems.\r\n\r\n_The Press_: The Press Division of the APA is comprised of persons who\r\ntogether master all the languages that are in use. Daily they examine\r\napproximately 300 newspapers and deliver to the Fuehrer, the deputy\r\nFuehrer, and all other interested offices the condensations of the\r\nimportant trends of the entire world press. I know that these press\r\nreports are highly praised by all who constantly follow them. The Press\r\nDivision furthermore conducts an exact archives on the attitudes of\r\nthe most important papers of the world and an exact archives on the\r\nmost important journalists of the world. Many embarrassments during\r\nconferences in Germany could have been avoided had one consulted these\r\narchives (case of Leumas, Nurnberg, 1934; case of Dorothy Thompson;\r\nand others). Further, the Press Division was able to arrange a host of\r\ninterviews as well as conducting a great number of friendly foreign\r\njournalists to the various official representatives of Germany. Hearst\r\nthen personally asked me to often write about the position of German\r\nforeign policy in his papers. This year five continuous articles under\r\nmy name have appeared in Hearst papers all over the world. Since these\r\narticles, as Hearst personally informed me, presented well founded\r\narguments, he begged me to write further articles for his papers.\r\n\r\nThe Press Division of the APA was able to step into a position of\r\narbitration in the conflict which arose between the representatives\r\nof the foreign press in Germany and the Office of Propaganda because\r\nof the general attack that the Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Goebbels\r\nhad made upon the combined world press in July of 1934. Thus from\r\nthe combined press representatives it was able to select and take\r\ncare of those who were of a pro-German opinion, or at least conducted\r\nthemselves in a neutral manner. Because of the willingness to cooperate\r\nthat the Press Division under the skillful guidance of Dr. Bomer showed\r\nthe foreigners, the Press Division has won a position of honor, and can\r\ntoday claim to have a truly personal and factual knowledge of world\r\njournalism.\r\n\r\nIn general the APA has attempted in the last 1-1/2 years to establish\r\ncontact between diplomacy and the world press in Germany. For this\r\npurpose the APA held a Beer Party [Bierabend] each month. On each of\r\nthese evenings a prominent representative of the party or government\r\nspoke about the work of his division. The most prominent national\r\nsocialists spoke at these gatherings (Goering, Rust, Todt, Schirach,\r\nHierl, Dr. Gross, Frau Scholtz-Klinck, Frank, Ley, and others). These\r\nevenings were constantly attended by the majority of the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives. We could always count on having at least 350 to 400\r\nvisitors. Since we invited a great number of representatives of the\r\nGerman ministries and party offices in the last year, a hefty traffic\r\nhas developed. Many items which later appeared in the papers can be\r\naccredited to the personal clarification of a national socialistic\r\nparty member who attended these evenings. The APA furthermore conducted\r\na great number of foreigners to the labor battalions [Arbeitsdienst]\r\nor acquainted them with other establishments. That has been a bit of\r\nwork that has constantly been going on so that the APA here too has\r\nexperience to answer all questions which may arise.\r\n\r\n_The School of Instruction_ [_Das Schulungshaus_]: The 2-1/2 year work\r\nof all those active in the APA has given them a very exact picture\r\nof the practical workings of foreign policy and foreign trade. It has\r\nalso enabled them every bit of knowledge which can be obtained from a\r\nnational socialistic point of view in order to accurately judge the\r\nquestions of foreign policy at all. In order to also develop potential\r\nand interested capable powers arising from the people and develop them\r\nas successors in the movement of national socialism the Foreign Policy\r\nSchool of Instruction [Aussenpolitisches Schulungshaus] was founded\r\nin Dahlem in 1935. Students from all over Germany who displayed an\r\ninterest in foreign policy were assembled at this school. They were\r\nhere instructed and schooled through lectures and cooperative work\r\nsimilar to seminars. Into this school were drawn the Hitler youths, SS,\r\nand the plan exists to have persons who will later travel abroad as\r\nrepresentatives of large German concerns undergo an extensive course\r\nof instruction. Furthermore, the foreign Policy School of Instruction\r\nshould also examine those students which the Academic Student Exchange\r\nis sending abroad. Lectures at the school were given by a number\r\nof German economists, as well as the Japanese and Chinese military\r\nattaches. The Chief of the APA himself lectured there.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the APA as well as the School of Instruction rest\r\nin the hands of Party Member Knauer, who in his youth was party to the\r\nMarch on Coburg.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I may well say that these 2-1/2 years were rich in\r\nexperiences and have tested people in their capacity to perform work.\r\nThese 2-1/2 years have led to the elimination of one or another\r\nincompetents, but at least a dozen people have become so enriched\r\nthrough experience that they can be a great help to the Fuehrer in the\r\nfield of their enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe lack of necessary and sufficient means naturally prevents a\r\ncomplete exploitation of the entire activity, which surely would\r\nbe desired. But in spite of this one can say that the most humanly\r\npossible was accomplished here with sacrifice, sense of duty, and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 004-PS\r\n\r\nCopy\r\n\r\nThe Political Preparation of the Norway Action\r\n\r\n (The enclosures mentioned in the report have been omitted from this\r\n paper since they are only relative to specific matters. The complete\r\n report including appendices has been submitted to the Deputy of the\r\n Fuehrer by Reichsleiter Rosenberg on 17 June 1940)\r\n\r\nThe Office of Foreign Relations [Aussenpolitisches Amt] of the\r\nNational Socialist Party (NSDAP) has had contact with Vidkun\r\nQuisling, leader of the Nasjonal Samling in Norway, for years. The\r\ndirector of the \"Office North\" [Amt Norden] of the office of Foreign\r\nRelations--later victim of a fatal accident--paid him (Quisling) a\r\npersonal visit on one of his trips to Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1939 the general political situation was beginning to grow\r\ncritical Quisling gave the Office of Foreign Relations an estimate\r\nof the situation and his opinion about the possible intentions of\r\nGreat Britain with relation to Scandinavia in case of conflict (Great\r\nBritain's) with the German Reich. Prior to the convention of the\r\nNordic Association [Nordische Gesellschaft] in Luebeck, Quisling was\r\nreceived by Reichsleiter Rosenberg in Berlin. He (Quisling) pointed\r\nout the decisive geopolitical importance of Norway in the Scandinavian\r\nregion and the advantages gained by the Power in control of the\r\nNorwegian coast in case of conflict between the German Reich and Great\r\nBritain. He further explained the extraordinarily clever, democratic\r\nand particularly anglo-saxon propaganda which had been accepted\r\nfavourably by almost the entire nation, also because of Norway's\r\neconomic dependence on the seas and therefore on England. Since he\r\ndid not believe that the small nations would remain neutral in case\r\nof conflict--as had been the case in the World War of 1914--but was\r\nconvinced that they would become involved in one way or the other he\r\nrequested support for his party and press in Norway, basing his request\r\non the \"pangermanic\" ideology. Reichsleiter Rosenberg also requested\r\nDirector [Amtsleiter] Scheidt to arrange a meeting between Quisling\r\nand his Deputy Hagelin with State Secretary [Staatssekretaer] Koerner,\r\nbearing in mind that this matter might be of particular interest to\r\nGeneral Field Marshall Goering with regard to air strategy. This\r\nmeeting with the State Secretary Koerner did take place. At the same\r\ntime Staff Director [Stabsleiter] Schickedanz, directed by Reichsleiter\r\nRosenberg, submitted the attached memorandum to Reich Minister and\r\nChief of the Chancellery [Reichsminister und Chef der Reichskanzlei]\r\nLammers for the information of the Fuehrer by the end of June 1939\r\n(Enclosure No. 1).\r\n\r\nAfter the Luebeck convention Director [Amtsleiter] Scheidt took a\r\nvacation trip to Norway to further pursue this matter. His observations\r\nare found in the attached report (Enclosure No. 2). Even during his\r\npresence in Germany Quisling had requested a short, pertinent training\r\nprogram for reliable party functionaries especially selected by him.\r\nThis request was granted by Reichsleiter Rosenberg. In _August 1939_\r\na 14 day course was held at the School of the Office for Foreign\r\nRelations of the NSDAP [Aussenpolitisches Schulungshaus der NSDAP] in\r\nBerlin for 25 followers of the Nasjonal Samling who had been selected\r\nby Quisling.\r\n\r\nIn September Burgermeister Dr. Winkler revealed that he had been\r\ncharged with the financial aspects of Quisling's request by General\r\nField Marshal Goering through State Secretary Koerner. The outbreak\r\nof war and the beginning of the Polish campaign delayed the decisions\r\n(Enclosure No. 3). A further reminder of Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\nto General Field Marshal Goering in the course of a talk about\r\nthe importance of Norway in connection with the matters set forth\r\noriginally by Quisling had no practical results.\r\n\r\nAt the same time political tension increased in Norway as Russian\r\nactivity made itself felt in the Baltic regions. Of this Quisling\r\nkept the office (APA) informed through his deputies in Germany. The\r\noutbreak of the Russo-Finnish war at the end of November helped to\r\nfurther increase the anti-German currents in all Scandinavia and played\r\ninto the hands of the anglo-saxon propaganda which was now building\r\nup to full strength. Greater Germany was represented as a secret ally\r\nof Soviet Russia and as the real culprit in Finland's misfortune. At\r\nthe same time the Western Powers promised Finland military support\r\nwhich could only be supplied via Norway and Sweden. The possibility\r\nof a plan by Great Britain to occupy Norway and possibly Sweden to\r\neffectively close the blockade against Greater Germany and further to\r\ngain convenient air bases against Germany began to take shape under the\r\npretence of altruistic help to Finland. Its aim was to involve also the\r\nNordic Nations in a conflict against Greater Germany. Quisling informed\r\nthe office (APA) about these new possibilities shaping on the political\r\nscene, acting through his deputy in Germany.\r\n\r\nAs the activities of the Allies became more and more noticeable in\r\nNorway Quisling again came to Germany to voice his fears. He was\r\nreceived by Reichsleiter Rosenberg in the early part of December\r\nand he again presented his ideas. Firmly convinced that in the long\r\nrun a genuinely neutral position in the great conflict would become\r\nimpossible for the small nations and in his firm faith in the victory\r\nof Greater Germany in this conflict which also was an ideological one,\r\nQuisling considered it his duty--supported as he was by a small but\r\ndetermined minority--to tie Norway's fate to that of Greater Germany\r\nas the new centre of strength of a nordic-germanic life community.\r\nWe knew that his courageous group was the _only_ pro-German Party.\r\nHis deputy in Germany, Hagelin, had also arranged for a talk between\r\nQuisling and Grand Admiral Raeder which took place about this time.\r\nDuring a report to the Fuehrer Reichsleiter Rosenberg again mentioned\r\nNorway. He particularly pointed out her importance in the case of\r\nEngland deciding to occupy Norway with the tacit consent of the\r\nNorwegian Government, for the purpose of strengthening the blockade\r\nand under the pretence of help for Finland. Grand Admiral Raeder, too,\r\nupon his request, was called to the Fuehrer in connection with his\r\ntalks with Quisling. As a result of these steps Quisling was received\r\nby the Fuehrer for personal instructions on the _16th of December_ and\r\nagain on the _18th of December_. During this interview the Fuehrer\r\nemphasized repeatedly that the most preferable attitude of Norway\r\nas well as all of Scandinavia would be one of complete neutrality.\r\nHe had no intentions to enlarge the theatres of war to draw other\r\nnations into the conflict. If, however, the enemy were preparing an\r\nenlargement of the zones of war with the aim to further throttle\r\nand threaten the Greater German Reich then, of course, he would be\r\nobliged to arm against such steps. Then the Fuehrer promised Quisling\r\nfinancial support for his movement based on the pan-germanic ideology\r\nand for the purpose of combatting the increasing enemy propaganda. The\r\nmilitary matters of the questions were now transferred to a special\r\nmilitary staff which assigned special missions to Quisling and heard\r\nhis opinions (Encl. No. 29). The political treatment was to be handled\r\nby Reichsleiter Rosenberg, expenses were to be carried by the Foreign\r\nOffice [Auswaertiges Amt] and Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs\r\n[Reichsminister vom Aussenpolitischen Amt] was to be kept informed\r\nat all times. Maintenance of liaison with Quisling was assigned to\r\nDirector [Amtsleiter] Scheidt who, as matters developed further, was\r\nattached to the Naval Attache in Oslo, Commander [Korvettenkapitaen]\r\nSchreiber. Strictest secrecy was ordered for the entire matter.\r\n\r\nThen, in January, during a conference between Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\nand Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop it was decided to appropriate to\r\nQuisling an initial sum of 200,000 Goldmark. This money was to be taken\r\nto Oslo, in two instalments, by the liaison agent Scheidt where it was\r\nto be handed to Quisling. In the Foreign Office [Auswaertiges Amt]\r\nPrivy Councillor [Geheimrat] Von Grundherr was the only one to be told\r\nof this arrangement (Encl. No. 3).\r\n\r\nAs shown in the attached documentary memoranda Quisling's reports\r\ntransmitted by his deputy in Germany Hagelin concerning the possibility\r\nof active intervention of the Western Powers in Norway with consent of\r\nthe Norwegian Government became more and more alarming. These reports\r\ncontinuously supplemented with more and more accurate confirmations\r\nby Quisling's confidants were in certain contrast with the opinions\r\nof the German Legation in Oslo. The Legation believed in the neutral\r\nintentions of the Norwegian Government of that time, the Nygardsvold,\r\nand was further convinced that the Government would take arms in\r\ndefence of its neutrality policy. The Foreign Office [Auswaertiges\r\nAmt] held the same opinion as is shown in the attached documentary\r\nmemorandum dated January 8 which is the result of a talk between\r\nDirector [Amtsleiter] Scheidt and Privy Councillor [Geheimrat] Von\r\nGrundherr (Encl. 8). It is of special interest that Hagelin, Quisling's\r\nDeputy in Germany, whose intimate connection with Quisling was not\r\nknown in Norway succeeded in getting a foothold in the circles of\r\nthe Nygardsvold Government. Thus he heard the uncolored opinions of\r\nthe members of the Government who conducted themselves like a secret\r\nNorwegian-Anglophile society.\r\n\r\nIn the documentary memorandum of January 13 he relates the opinions\r\nexpressed to him by two Norwegian Ministers. The gist of the opinions\r\nwas that Germany had already lost the war and that Norway--if only\r\nbecause of its large Merchant Marine--could not do other than favour\r\nEngland in her politics, in war even more so than in peace. And further\r\nthat the entire nations agreed with this policy (Encl. 9). During\r\nthe night of February 16 to 17 the English raided the \"Altmark\" in\r\nthe Joessingsfjord. The reaction of the Norwegian Government to the\r\nAltmark-affair seemed to indicate that certain secret arrangements had\r\nbeen made between the Norwegian Government and the Allies. This was\r\nfurther emphasized in Director Scheidt's consolidated report covering\r\nJanuary 20th to February 20th (Encl. No. 11) after he had received\r\nHagelin's report. Hagelin had overheard the conversation between two\r\nmembers of the Storting during which one member said to the other\r\nthat the actions of the two commanders of the Norwegian torpedo boats\r\nhad been a \"prearranged affair.\" The same report also refers to the\r\nEnglish demands for air bases in Norway and for freedom of trade in\r\nthe Norwegian waters. It goes on to say that although the Norwegian\r\nGovernment refused those demands it was agreed that violations by the\r\nEnglish would be answered with paper protests only. Such reports, and\r\nconfirmations thereto were time and again supplied through Quisling. In\r\ncomplete contrast to those opinions the German Legation, even after the\r\nAltmark Affair, relied fully upon the good will of the Norwegians. The\r\nAmbassador cited the signing of the Norwegian-German trade agreement as\r\nweighing heavily in favour of his point of view. He already considered\r\nthe Norwegian Government Nygardsvold somewhat dependent on the Greater\r\nGerman Reich (Encl. Nos. 11 and 12). All these reports were currently\r\nsubmitted to the Fuehrer by Reichsleiter Rosenberg. Quisling always\r\nemphasised that more than 90% of the country was behind England and\r\nthat he only represented a minority which, however, was chosen by\r\nvirtue of its intuition to take charge later on as representatives of a\r\nnew Norwegian nation.\r\n\r\nApart from financial support which was forthcoming from the Reich in\r\ncurrency, Quisling had also been promised a shipment of material for\r\nimmediate use in Norway such as coal and sugar. Additional help was\r\npromised. The shipments were to be conducted under cover of a new Trade\r\nCompany to be established in Germany or through especially selected\r\nexisting firms while Hagelin was to act as consignee in Norway. Hagelin\r\nhad already conferred with the respective Ministers of the Nygardsvold\r\nGovernment as for instance the Minister of Supply and Commerce\r\n[Versorgungs-und Handelsminister] and had been assured permission for\r\nthe import of coal. At the same time the coal transports were to serve\r\npossibly to supply the technical means necessary to launch Quisling's\r\npolitical action in Oslo with German help. It was Quisling's plan to\r\nsend a number of selected, particularly reliable men to Germany for\r\na brief military training course in a completely isolated camp. They\r\nwere then to be detailed as area and language specialists to German\r\nSpecial Troops who were to be taken to Oslo on the coal barges to\r\naccomplish a political action. Thus Quisling planned to get hold of\r\nhis leading opponents in Norway including the King, to prevent all\r\nmilitary resistance from the very beginning. Immediately following\r\nthis political action and upon an official request of Quisling to the\r\nGovernment of the German Reich the military occupation of Norway was to\r\ntake place. All military preparations were to be completed previously.\r\nThough this plan contained the great advantage of surprise it also\r\ncontained a great number of dangers which could possibly cause its\r\nfailure. For this reason it received a quite dilatory treatment while,\r\nat the same time, it was not disapproved as far as the Norwegians were\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn February, after a conference with General Field Marshal Goering,\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg informed the Secretary in the Office of the\r\nFour Year Plan [Ministerialdirektor im Vierjahresplan] Wohlthat only\r\nof the intention to prepare coal shipments to Norway to the named\r\nconfidant Hagelin. Further details were discussed in a conference\r\nbetween Secretary Wohlthat, Staff Director Schickedanz and Hagelin.\r\nSince Wohlthat received no further instructions from the General Field\r\nMarshal, Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop--after a consultation with\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg--consented to expedite these shipments through\r\nhis office. Based on a report of Reichsleiter Rosenberg to the Fuehrer\r\nit was also arranged to pay Quisling ten thousand English pounds per\r\nmonth for three months commencing on the 15th of March, to support his\r\nwork. This money was to be paid through liaison agent Scheidt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hagelin, through his connection in Norway as trusted agent\r\nof the Norwegian Navy, had been commissioned with the purchase of\r\nGerman AA-guns (Flaks) through the German Navy Ministry. Through this\r\nconnection he gained more and more insight into the actual ideas and\r\nintentions of the Norwegian Nygardsvold Government and into the Allied\r\npreparations which had already started in Norway. While in Germany\r\non the 20th of March to attend conferences regarding the delivery of\r\nthe German AA guns, he made a detailed report about the increasing\r\nactivities of the Allies in Norway, tolerated by the Nygardsvold\r\nGovernment. According to his reports the Allies were already checking\r\nthe Norwegian coastal towns for landing and transport possibilities.\r\nHe also stated that the French Commandant Kermarrec who was charged\r\nwith this reconnaissance had a confidential talk with Colonel Sunolo,\r\nCommandant of Narvik, who is a follower of Quisling; during the course\r\nof the talk he told him of the Allied intentions to land motorized\r\ntroops in Stavanger, Dronthoim and possibly also at Kirkenes and to\r\noccupy the airport at Sola (Encl. no. 14).\r\n\r\nAt the same time Hagelin increased his oral and written warnings\r\nregarding the confidential agreements between the Allied and the\r\nNorwegian Governments stipulating that in case of an Allied occupation\r\nof coastal towns the Norwegian Government would not go beyond paper\r\nprotest, as was the case in the Altmark Affair. And again, in his\r\nreport of March 26 (Encl. Nos. 15 and 16) he pointed out that the\r\nspeech of the Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht dealing with Norwegian\r\nneutrality and containing some protests was not being taken seriously\r\neither in London by the English nor in Norway by the Norwegians. It\r\nwas well known that the Government had no intentions to take a stand\r\nagainst England. However, to keep up appearances towards Germany up to\r\nthe last minute the Norwegian Government intended to issue an order\r\nto fire. This was to demonstrate that everything within their power\r\nhad been done. There was a continuous series of conferences between\r\nthe King, the Commanding Admiral, the Crown Prince and the newly\r\nappointed Minister of War Ljundberg who had been placed in office at\r\nthe special request of England as early as January. A person close to\r\nthe King as well as the commanding Admiral explained to Hagelin that\r\nthe above mentioned actions by England were quite unavoidable since\r\nshe knew that she could only win the war if she were in control of the\r\nNorwegian ports. Furthermore England feared a German counterblow which\r\nwas not to be allowed to materialize. The Norwegian Government was also\r\nnotified by London that Germany intended to mine the waters between\r\nJutland and the Norwegian coast. Based on a message from England this\r\nplan was revealed on or about March 15 during a secret session of the\r\nForeign Affairs Committee of the Storting by Foreign Minister Koht.\r\nAs a matter of fact, during the course of the military preparations\r\nfor the occupation of Norway this plan had been adopted by the German\r\nmilitary authorities and to this day it is a mystery how this plan got\r\nto London. In view of all this news Quisling could no longer back his\r\nearlier advice to continue watching the development of the situation\r\nin Norway. He now had to point out that any further delay would mean\r\na grave risk. The above was probably the most decisive report ever\r\nto be submitted here by Hagelin. Reichsleiter Rosenberg immediately\r\ntransmitted it to the Fuehrer (Encl. No. 15).\r\n\r\nWhile still in Berlin Hagelin was requested by Colonel Schmundt to make\r\nspeedy arrangements for a conference between Quisling and a Colonel of\r\nthe General Staff, at some neutral location. This conference was held\r\nin Copenhagen in the beginning of April.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of all this information coming from Quisling and his\r\nconfidants and in contrast to the opinion held up to the end by German\r\nLegation in Oslo and by the Foreign Office, the Allies, on April 8th.\r\ninitiated their first major blow as an introduction to their intended\r\noccupation of Norway. During the night from the 7th. to the 8th. of\r\nApril they mined the Norwegian coast and made public announcement\r\nof this act. Norway's reaction, consistent with the reports always\r\nreceived by the Office of Foreign Relations [Aussenpolitisches Amt] of\r\nthe NSDAP, was nothing more than protests on paper growing weaker by\r\nthe hour. Then, after proper preparations and by command of the Fuehrer\r\nGreater Germany undertook the counterblow in the morning of April 9th.\r\nand occupied the most important Norwegian airfields and seaports.\r\n\r\nReports about the further political developments in Norway proper are\r\nfound in the appended documentary memorandum (Encl. Nos. 18 to 30).\r\n\r\nAfter the success of the occupational operations in Norway seemed\r\nassured the Fuehrer called for Reichsleiter Rosenberg for a short\r\ntalk before lunch, on April 25th. He oriented him (Rosenberg) about\r\nthe developments of the military action in Norway where the English\r\nAuxiliary Corps had just suffered a decisive defeat combined with\r\nthe capture of important documents and plans. He further revealed to\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg that he had based this most daring decision\r\nwhich was now approaching successful completion on the continuous\r\nwarnings of Quisling as reported to him by Reichsleiter Rosenberg. And\r\nthat it actually happened in the Drontheimfjord that behind the stern\r\nof the last German Troop Transport there appeared the bow of the first\r\nEnglish destroyer which convoyed the Allied Troop Transport fleet. This\r\ndestroyer was wiped out by the German Navy.\r\n\r\n Berlin, June 15th. 1940\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 007-PS\r\n\r\nBrief Report on Activities of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Party\r\nfrom 1933 to 1943\r\n\r\nWhen the Foreign Affairs Bureau [Aussenpolitisches Amt] was established\r\n1 April 1933 the Fuehrer directed that it should not be expanded to a\r\nlarge bureaucratic agency, but should rather develop its effectiveness\r\nthrough initiative and suggestions.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the extra ordinarily hostile attitude adopted by the\r\nSoviet Government in Moscow from the beginning the newly-established\r\nbureau devoted particular attention to internal conditions in the\r\nSoviet Union, as well as to the effects of World Bolshevism primarily\r\nin other European countries. It entered into contact with the most\r\nvariegated groups inclining towards National Socialism and combatting\r\nBolshevism, focussing its main attention on Nations and States\r\nbordering on the Soviet Union. On the one end those nations and states\r\nconstituted an _Insulating Ring_ encircling the Bolshevist neighbor;\r\non the other hand they were the lateral of German living space\r\n[Fluegelstellung zum deutschen Lebensraum] and took up a flanking\r\nposition towards the Western Powers [Flankenstellung Gegenueber Den\r\nWestmaechten] especially Great Britain. In order to wield the desired\r\ninfluence by one means or another, the Bureau was compelled to use\r\nthe most varying methods, taking into consideration the completely\r\ndifferent living conditions, the ties of blood, intellect and history\r\nof the movements observed by the Bureau in those countries.\r\n\r\nIn _Scandinavia_ an outspoken pro-Anglo-Saxon attitude, based on\r\neconomic considerations, had become progressively more dominant after\r\nthe World War of 1914/1918. There the Bureau put entire emphasis on\r\ninfluencing general _cultural_ relations with the Nordic peoples. For\r\nthis purpose it took the Nordic Society [Nordische Gesellschaft] in\r\nLuebeck under its protection. The Reich conventions of this society\r\nwere attended by many outstanding personalities, especially from\r\nFinland. While there were no openings for purely political cooperation\r\nin Sweden and Denmark, an association based on Greater Germanic\r\nideology was found in Norway. Very close relations were established\r\nwith its founder, which led to further consequences. (See annex I for\r\nmore detailed exposition).\r\n\r\n_South-Eastern Europe_ was dominated by the French post-war system\r\nof alliances. The countries united in the Little Entente were aiming\r\nat a more favorable defence of the booty accumulated during the\r\nwar. In addition each one of these countries sought to gain through\r\nthis mutual-assistance pact safety against a superior opponent:\r\nCzechoslovakia against Germany; Yugoslavia against Italy; Rumania\r\nagainst the Soviet Union. In _Czechoslovakia_ a common hatred against\r\neverything German united the still remaining, partly pan-Slavic,\r\nMasonic and pro-Jewish tendencies. In _Rumania_ the feeling of\r\ninsecurity and fear of the superior neighbor, from whom she had taken\r\nBessarabia was growing. In Rumania a primitive anti-Semitic group still\r\nexisted. Its academically doctrinaire attitude precluded large scale\r\npolitical effectiveness, but nevertheless offered points of mutual\r\ninterest. The Foreign Affairs Bureau picked these up, developed them,\r\ninstigated the formation of a new party and thereby forced a decisive\r\nchange in the whole political situation in Rumania, which is still\r\nhaving its effect today. (See Annex II for more detailed exposition).\r\n\r\n_Hungary and Bulgaria_ alone, Allied nations of the World War which had\r\nformerly been completely deprived of their rights, were attracted by\r\nthe newly-formed center of gravity in the north. This attraction was\r\nnourished by the hope of obtaining an expansion of their own power\r\nthrough the increasing strength of Germany. However, National Socialism\r\nmet a certain reserve or antipathy in Bulgaria because of widespread\r\ncontagion of the Communistic blight. In Hungary it met similar reserve\r\ndue to the still-fashionable feudal leading circles, who are bolstered\r\nby Jewish capital. At any rate it may be mentioned here that _the first\r\nforeign state visit after the seizure of power took place through the\r\nmediation of the Foreign Affairs Bureau_. Julius Gombos, who in former\r\nyears had himself pursued anti-Semitic and racial tendencies, had\r\nreached the Hungarian Premier's chair. The Bureau maintained a personal\r\nconnection with him. In September 1933 he paid a visit to Germany and\r\nwas received by the Fuehrer in Erfurt. With this visit the official\r\ncordon of isolation surrounding National Socialism was pierced for the\r\nfirst time. This visit had been preceded by the Fuehrer's reception\r\nof the Rumanian poet and former minister Octavian Goga through the\r\nBureau's mediation. Goga later became the decisive exponent of a\r\npolitical reproachment with Germany.\r\n\r\nIn _Yugoslavia_ other German Reich agencies had become active in the\r\nsame direction, so that the Foreign Affairs Bureau remained in the\r\nbackground and shifted its efforts to the purely commercial sphere. It\r\ninitiated the first contracts with Croation and Serbian cooperatives.\r\n\r\nMotivated by reasons of War Economy, the Bureau advocated _the transfer\r\nof raw material purchases from overseas_ to the areas accessible by\r\noverland traffic routes, i.e. primarily _in the Balkans_, naturally\r\ninsofar as practicable. At first little heed was paid to the Bureau in\r\nthese endeavors, but it later secured the active support especially\r\nof the Food Estate; through its cooperation, e.g., on the subject of\r\nfruit and vegetable imports, a very substantial shift in the source\r\nof imports was attained, particularly through the currently initiated\r\ncooperation with Croatian and Hungarian cooperatives as well as with\r\ncommercial associations all over the Balkans.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, work in _Italy_ was out of the question because\r\never since the days of our struggle for power ties of a personal\r\nnature have existed, which were taken over by official institutions\r\nor cultivated by individual personalities. Work in _Austria_ was also\r\nexcluded, since a special \"Provincial Directorate for Austria\" existed\r\nwithin the Nazi Party.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau declined to concern itself with questions of Racial Germans\r\n[Volksdeutsche] abroad. For this phase of the problem the \"Racial\r\nGermans\" Central Agency [Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle] was later created.\r\n\r\nTowards _Western European States_ the Bureau limited its activities to\r\nsimple observation of existing conditions, or to the establishment of\r\nrelations, especially of a commercial nature, primarily in _Belgium,\r\nHolland and Luxemburg_.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the attitude on foreign policy laid down by the\r\nFuehrer, the Bureau endeavored to establish far-reaching connections\r\nwith England through continuous personal contacts with influential\r\npersonalities of English political life. Eminent Englishmen were\r\ninvited to the annual Party Rallies.\r\n\r\nPursuant to its self chosen task the Bureau devoted its attention\r\nto the _Near East_. Turkey, newly consolidated by Mustapha Kemal,\r\nadopted a hesitating attitude of watchful waiting. This position was\r\nprobably due to military impotence against Soviet Russia, clearly\r\nrecognized, on the one hand, and also to hostility to Fascist Italy,\r\nalready previously manifested, on the other hand. In _Iran_, however,\r\nthe Bureau's initiative in the economic field to stimulate the mutual\r\nexchange of goods encountered greatest understanding and the greatest\r\nreadiness in carrying it through. The Bureau's initiative in developing\r\nwith the head of commercial circles, entirely new methods for the\r\neconomic penetration of Iran found expression, in an extraordinarily\r\nfavorable way, in reciprocal trade relations. Naturally in Germany,\r\ntoo, this initiative at first encountered a completely negative\r\nattitude and resistance on the part of the competent state authorities,\r\nan attitude that had first to be overcome. In the course of a few\r\nyears the volume of trade with Iran was multiplied five-fold, and in\r\n1939 Iran's trade turnover with Germany had attained first place. Even\r\nSoviet Russia, the competitor who had been biggest and most dreaded\r\npreviously, had been eliminated from the running. Concurrently with\r\nthe activation of commercial relations the Bureau had also intensified\r\ncultural relations and had, in conjunction with growing commercial\r\ninfluence and in closest collaboration with the Iranian Government,\r\ncreated a series of cultural institutions headed and directed by\r\nGermans. In consequence the dominant French cultural influence in Iran\r\nhas already been broken since the year 1936.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau simultaneously attempted to also draw Afghanistan into its\r\norbit. Relations established with leading individual personalities led\r\nto the willing opening of this country, which had formerly been rather\r\nneglected by Germany. All the leading personalities of Afghanistan were\r\nguests of the Bureau. The Bureau favored the taking part of German\r\neconomy in the industrial upbuilding of the country; German experts in\r\nall fields were called to Afghanistan in increasing numbers through\r\nthe Bureau's mediation. The German Colony became the dominant one in\r\nAfghanistan. The preparation for expansion of the Afghan army was in\r\nGerman hands; carrying it through was prevented by the outbreak of\r\nwar. Even though the German Colony had to leave Afghanistan later on,\r\nAfghanistan's neutral position today is largely due to the Bureau's\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe _Arab question_, too, became part of the work of the Bureau. In\r\nspite of England's tutelage of _Iraq_ the Bureau established a series\r\nof connections to a number of leading personalities of the Arab world,\r\nsmoothing the way for strong bonds to Germany. In this connection,\r\nthe growing influence of the Reich in Iran and Afghanistan did not\r\nfail to have repercussions in Arabia. All these relations took place\r\non a purely economic basis and fostered the systematically directed\r\nadvancement of German influence and prestige in the domains reserved\r\nby the Western Powers for themselves. In this connection it may be\r\nmentioned in general that the internal peril to England's preponderance\r\nin those areas would have been considerably more pronounced, if the\r\nBureau's foresighted initiative, which took Oriental conditions very\r\nwell into account, had not been forever ignored by official authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau foresaw the necessity of technical improvement of the\r\n_Danube water route_ to facilitate traffic, because of the shift in the\r\nincrease of the exchange in goods, especially in the Balkans and in\r\nthe Orient. On its own initiative it attempted to influence competent\r\nauthorities (especially of the Bavarian Government), together with\r\nparticularly interested private commercial circles, to enlarge our\r\nDanube shipping facilities (primarily the port of Regensburg). Although\r\nthe Bureau throughout the years, asserted this necessity, which was\r\nbecoming more and more urgent, and although the Bureau relentlessly\r\nmaintained its initiative, its endeavors in this matter were\r\nunfortunately not crowned by any success. Presumably all responsible\r\nauthorities regret it bitterly to-day.\r\n\r\nAmong other projects due to the Foreign Affairs Bureau's initiative,\r\nendeavors to grow the _rubber-fibered Kok Sagys plant_ in Germany\r\ndeserve to be emphasized. This plant is being cultivated in the Soviet\r\nUnion. In spite of efforts during many years, no success was attained\r\nin planting sizeable experimental crops, because of latent disunity\r\namong competent authority. The Bureau was compelled to resort to\r\nexperimental fields in _Greece_ through its own connections in the\r\nBalkans.\r\n\r\nSomewhat off the beaten path was the Bureau's undertaking in _Brazil_,\r\nwhich grew out of personal connections, large quantities of cotton\r\n(60,000 tons) were successfully brought to Germany under a clearing\r\nagreement at a time when imports of this raw material had become\r\nvery critically short, already necessitating work outs. A Bureau\r\nrepresentative was twice the Brazilian Government's guest. Brazil\r\nand Iran were the only nations from whom Germany could purchase this\r\nindispensable raw material for Reichsmark. The Brazilian Minister\r\nexpressed his thanks for this initial step to the Head of the Bureau in\r\nan address delivered at the occasion of an exposition.\r\n\r\nAbout 40 lecture evenings for diplomats and the foreign press should\r\nalso be listed. They dealt with the construction of the new Germany,\r\nand speakers included many leading personalities of the Reich.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau has carried out the initiating of all politically feasible\r\nprojects. With the outbreak of war it was entitled to consider its task\r\nas terminated. The exploitation of the many _personal_ connections in\r\nmany lands can be resumed under a different guise.\r\n\r\n  Signed: ROSENBERG\r\n\r\n  2 Inclosures\r\n  I Norway\r\n  II Rumania\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n _Annex I_ to Brief Report on Activities of the Foreign Affairs Bureau\r\n of the Nazi Party from 1933 to 1943.\r\n\r\nThe Political Preparation of the Military Occupation of Norway During\r\nthe War Years 1939/1940.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, of all political groupings in Scandinavia\r\nonly \"Nasjonal Samling\", led in Norway by the Former Minister of War\r\nand Major of the Reserve Vidkun Quisling, deserved serious political\r\nattention. This was a fighting political group, possessed by the idea\r\nof a Greater Germanic Community. Naturally all ruling powers were\r\nhostile and attempted to prevent, by any means, its success among the\r\npopulation. The Bureau maintained constant liaison with Quisling and\r\nattentively observed the attacks he conducted with tenacious energy\r\non the middle class which had been taken in tow by the English.\r\nFrom the beginning it appeared probable that without revolutionary\r\nevents, which would stir the population from their former attitude,\r\nno successful progress of Nasjonal Samling was to be expected. During\r\nthe winter 1938/1939, Quisling was privately visited by a member of\r\nthe Bureau. When the political situation in Europe came to a head\r\nin 1939, Quisling made an appearance at the convention of the Nordic\r\nSociety [Nordische Gesellschaft] in Luebeck in June. He expounded\r\nhis conception of the situation, and his apprehensions concerning\r\nNorway. He emphatically drew attention to the geopolitically decisive\r\nimportance of Norway in the Scandinavian area, and to the advantages\r\nthat would accrue to the power dominating the Norwegian coast in case\r\nof a conflict between the Greater German Reich and Great Britain.\r\nAssuming that his statements would be of special interest to the\r\nMarshal of the Reich Goering for aero-strategical reasons, Quisling\r\nwas referred to State Secretary [Staatssekretaer] Koerner by the\r\nBureau. The Staff Director [Stabsleiter] of the Bureau handed the\r\nChief of the Reich Chancellery a memorandum for transmission to the\r\nFuehrer. It dealt with the same subject, still taking into account\r\nthe then doubtful attitude of Soviet Russia. After the outbreak of\r\nGerman-Polish hostilities and of the Soviet-Finnish war, tensions\r\nin Scandinavia became more strained and facilitated the work of\r\nAnglo-Saxon propaganda. It began to appear possible that, under the\r\npretext of altruistic aid to Finland, Great Britain might intend\r\nto occupy Norway, and perhaps Sweden, to complete the anti-German\r\nblockade in the North Sea for all practical purposes, and to gain\r\ncomfortable airplane bases against Germany. The aim would have been\r\nto drag the Northern countries, too, into a military conflict with\r\nGermany. Apprehensive about this development, Quisling again appeared\r\nin Berlin in December 1939. He visited Reichsleiter Rosenberg and\r\nGrand Admiral Raeder. In the course of a report to the Fuehrer,\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg turned the conversation once more to Norway. He\r\nespecially pointed to Norway's importance should England, to tighten\r\nher blockade and under the pretext of aid to Finland, take steps to\r\noccupy the country, with the Norwegians' tacit consent. On the basis of\r\nhis conversation with Quisling and at his own request, Grand Admiral\r\nRaeder, too, had been asked to see the Fuehrer. In consequence of\r\nthese steps, Quisling was granted a personal audience with the Fuehrer\r\non 16 December, and once more on 18 December. In the course of this\r\naudience the Fuehrer emphasized repeatedly that he personally would\r\nprefer a completely neutral attitude of Norway as well as of the whole\r\nof Scandinavia. He did not intend to enlarge the theaters of war\r\nand to draw still other nations into the conflict. Should the enemy\r\nattempt to spend the war, however, with the aim of achieving further\r\nthrottling and intimidation of the Greater German Reich, he would\r\nbe compelled to gird himself against such an undertaking. In order\r\nto counterbalance increasing enemy propaganda activity, he promised\r\nQuisling financial support of his movement, which is based on Greater\r\nGermanic ideology. Military exploitation of the question now raised\r\nwas assigned to the Special Military Staff, which transmitted special\r\nmissions to Quisling. Reichsleiter Rosenberg was to take over political\r\nexploitation. Financial expenses were to be defrayed by the Ministry\r\nfor Foreign Affairs [Auswaertiges Amt], the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs being kept continuously by the Foreign Affairs Bureau. Chief\r\nof Section [Amtsleiter] Scheidt was charged with maintaining liaison\r\nwith Quisling. In the course of further developments he was assigned to\r\nthe Naval Attache in Oslo, Lt. Commander [Korvettenkapitaen] Screiber.\r\nOrders were given that the whole matter be handled with strictest\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\nQuisling's reports, transmitted through his representative in\r\nGermany, Hagelin, and dealing with the possibility of intervention\r\nby the Western Powers in Norway with tacit consent of the Norwegian\r\ngovernment, became more urgent by January already. These increasingly\r\nbetter substantiated communications were in sharpest contrast to the\r\nview of the German Legation in Oslo, which relied on the desire for\r\nneutrality of the then Norwegian Nygardsvold cabinet and was convinced\r\nof that government's intention and readiness to defend Norway's\r\nneutrality. No one in Norway knew that Quisling's representative for\r\nGermany maintained closest relations to him; he therefore succeeded\r\nin gaining a foothold within governmental circles of the Nygardsvold\r\ncabinet, and in listening to cabinet members' true views. Hagelin\r\ntransmitted what he had heard to the Bureau, which conveyed the news to\r\nthe Fuehrer through Reichsleiter Rosenberg. During the night of 16 to\r\n17 February English destroyers attacked the German steamer \"Altmark\"\r\nin Jossing fjord. The Norwegian government's reaction to this question\r\npermitted the conclusion that certain agreements had been covertly\r\narrived at between the Norwegian government and the Allies. Such\r\nassumption was confirmed by reports of Section [Amtsleiter] Scheidt who\r\nin turn derived his information from Hagelin and Quisling. But even\r\nafter this incident the German Legation in Oslo championed the opposite\r\nview, and went on record as believing in the good intentions of the\r\nNorwegians.\r\n\r\nThanks to his connections in Norway as agent of the Norwegian Navy,\r\nHagelin had succeeded, in the meantime, in being entrusted with the\r\npurchase of German AA guns through the German Navy Ministry. Through\r\nthese connections he gained more and more insight into the real views\r\nand intentions of the Norwegian Nygardsvold cabinet, and into the\r\npreparations already initiated by the Allies in Norway. At the occasion\r\nof his presence in Berlin on 20 March to negotiate about delivery of\r\nGerman AA guns he mentioned that the Allies were now even examining\r\nNorwegian ports for loading and transportation facilities. The French\r\nKommandant entrusted with this mission was said to have revealed Allied\r\nintentions in confidential conversations with the commander of Narwik,\r\nan adherent of Quisling. These intentions were to land motorized troops\r\nat Stavanger, Drontheim and perhaps Kirkenes, and to occupy Sola\r\nairdrome near Stavanger. Hagelin also re-emphasized his warnings about\r\nagreements secretly concluded between the Allies and the Norwegian\r\ngovernment according to which the Norwegian government would content\r\nitself solely with paper protests in case of a possible occupation of\r\nport cities by the Allies. He pointed out that the Norwegian government\r\nhad never intended to seriously oppose England, and that it was playing\r\na two-faced game with Germany solely to gain time for faits accomplis.\r\nHe also mentioned that the Norwegian government had been informed by\r\nEngland that Germany intended to lay a minefield from Jutland to the\r\nNorwegian coast. In view of all the information that had reached him,\r\nQuisling could no longer stand by his advice to await developments in\r\nNorway for a little while longer; he was compelled to point out that\r\nany delay of the German counter-thrust would entail extraordinary\r\nrisks. These reports were immediately transmitted to the Fuehrer by\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg. On 8 April the Allies struck the first blow in\r\npreparation for their intended occupation of Norway, thus confirming\r\nthese reports made by Quisling and his agents, and in contrast to the\r\nviews held to the end by the German Legation in Oslo and by the expert\r\nof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs [Auswaertiges Amt]. During the\r\nnight from 7 to 8 April minefields were laid alongside the Norwegian\r\ncoast by the Allied fleet, and the Allied governments informed the\r\nworld of the steps they had taken. In accordance with indications given\r\nby the Bureau, only progressively more tepid protests were made by\r\nNorway. By order of the Fuehrer Greater Germany counter-attacked, after\r\ncorresponding preparation, in the morning of 9 April and occupied the\r\nmost important Norwegian sea ports and airdromes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n _Annex II_: Rumania (From the overthrow of Titolescu to Marshal\r\n Antonescu)\r\n\r\nIn spite of almost complete occupation by the Central Powers in the\r\nlast World War, Rumania was indebted to Versailles for her re-creation,\r\nwhich was effected partially even at the expense of her one-time\r\nEastern ally. A basically sound anti-Semitic tendency existed in\r\nthis post-war country, which was torn asunder by dynastic squabbles\r\nand innumerable party fights. But in spite of repeated efforts this\r\ntendency had never risen above the limitations of a club, because of\r\nsolely scientific doctrinaire leadership. What was lacking was the\r\nguiding leadership of a political personality. After manifold grouping\r\ntrials the Bureau believed to have found such a personality--the\r\nformer Minister, and poet, Octavian Goga. It was not difficult to\r\nconvince this poet, pervaded by instinctive inspiration, that a Greater\r\nRumania, though it had to be created in opposition to Vienna, could be\r\nmaintained only together with Berlin. Nor was it difficult to create\r\nin him the desire to link the fate of Rumania with the future of the\r\nNational Socialist German Reich in good time. By bringing continuing\r\ninfluence to bear, the Bureau succeeded in inducing Octavian Goga as\r\nwell as Professor Cuza to amalgamate the parties under their leadership\r\non an Anti-Semitic basis. Thus they could carry on with united strength\r\nthe struggle for Rumania's renascence internally, and her affiliation\r\n[Anschluss] with Germany externally. Through the Bureau's initiative\r\nboth parties, which had heretofore been known by distinct names, were\r\nmerged as the National-Christian Party, under Goga's leadership and\r\nwith Cuza as Honorary President. The attempts concurrently undertaken\r\nby the Bureau to amalgamate this Party with the much more youthful,\r\nbut energetic Iron Guard movement were initially frustrated by the\r\napparently insurmountable personal incompatibility of Cuza and\r\nCodreanu. At any rate these attempts led to the secret establishment of\r\ngood personal relations between Goga and the mystic-fanciful Codreanu.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the years after his return, the king had succeeded\r\nin becoming the country's decisive factor through crafty tactics in\r\ndealing with the dominant political parties. Had the Bureau also\r\nsucceeded in merging the National-Christian Party with Codreanu,\r\nRumania would have obtained sharply anti-Semitic leadership based on\r\nstrong mass support. Such leadership could have attained its aims even\r\nagainst the will of the king. However, surviving rivalries between\r\nthe country's anti-Semitic trends later enabled the king to use them\r\nseparately for his plan, in order to destroy them as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for re-orientation of Rumania's foreign policy was taken\r\nup by Goga with bold elan. He had earlier succeeded in upsetting the\r\nposition of Foreign Minister Titulescu, the agent of Franco, of the\r\nGeneva League of Nations and of the Little Entente. Titulescu was later\r\noverthrown. Among the numerous, not very significant splinter parties,\r\nthe \"Young Liberals\", founded by George Bratianu, supported Goga's\r\ncampaign, without joining the anti-Semitic trend. The Rumanian front of\r\nVaida Voevod, wobbling to and fro among all camps, adopted a similar\r\nposition for some time.\r\n\r\n_Through intermediaries_, the Bureau _maintained constant contact_\r\nwith both tendencies, just like it constantly consulted with Goga,\r\nthrough Staff Director [Stabsleiter] Schickedanz, about tactics to\r\nbe followed. The whole struggle was accelerated by Soviet Russia's\r\nincreasing pressure in the Bessarabian question, and by the process\r\nof political rapprochement with Moscow, which was supported by Paris\r\nand Prague. Following a long period of recurring political trials\r\ninvolving scandal and graft, Rumania's internal struggle for the future\r\nmake-up of the country had been aggravated by the coming to the front\r\nof the Christian-Nationalist Party and of the Iron Guard. This struggle\r\nwas being fought with increasing bitterness. The king's attitude\r\ntowards the national movement was procrastinating and underhanded.\r\nThe movement was agreeable to him for eliminating the two parties\r\nwhich, by tradition, took turns in the government. But he intended to\r\nprevent the unequivocal victory of anti-Semitic and racial [Voelkisch]\r\nprinciples, influenced by growing Nationalism, in the country. That is\r\nwhy the Nationalists' foreign policy, secretly projected by Germany,\r\ndid not fit into his plans. Because he was in possession of the police\r\nand of the army, he remained the decisive factor in the country.\r\nAfter repeated postponement of the elections, which were legally due,\r\nthe king decided to hold an election. The decision was based on a\r\nvery reliable report of his then Prime Minister Taterescu. Taterescu\r\nwas convinced that the Liberal Party would again receive 40% of all\r\nvotes, through the machinations customary in Fomia. However, after a\r\nbitter election campaign the Liberal Party suffered painful defeat.\r\nThe opposition National Movement had achieved indisputable victory in\r\nspite of all chicanery and machinations by their opponents. The Iron\r\nGuard received about 16% of the total vote, the National-Christian\r\nParty Goga-Cuza about 11%, the government party about 35%. The rest\r\nof the votes were scattered. After some vacillation and hesitancy, the\r\nking appointed Goga Prime Minister on 27 December 1937 with a binding\r\npromise that Parliament would be dismissed and new elections held\r\nwithin the legally prescribed time limit. In spite of warnings by the\r\nBureau Goga believed the promise given by the king. But the king was\r\nonly attempting to gain time.\r\n\r\n_Thus a second government on racial and anti-Semitic foundations\r\nhad appeared in Europe, in a country in which such an event had\r\nbeen considered completely impossible._ The government immediately\r\nmade known its intention to proceed against Jewish predominance in\r\nthe country and declared repeatedly that it would have to subject\r\nRumania's previous foreign policy to re-examination and reform. In\r\nthe meantime the Judaic-Masonic and liberal opposition did not lose\r\ntime. Passions were inflamed and became increasingly more envenomed.\r\nIt looked like a hot and bloody election campaign. The prospects of\r\nGoga's Christian-Nationalist Party pointed to a big victory with sure\r\ncertainty, especially since, with the Bureau's cooperation he had on\r\nthe sly made a secret agreement with Codreanu. To be sure, Goga did not\r\nact on the Bureau's advice to immediately develop his party cadres,\r\nto expand his party machine all over the country and to permeate the\r\npolice and gendarmerie. Goga postponed the execution of organizational\r\nreform, which he also intended, until after the election. He considered\r\nhimself to be under obligation to the king not to undertake anything\r\nuntil the electoral decisions had been rendered, but to take steps all\r\nthe more incisively after legally attaining the majority.\r\n\r\nIn innumerable interviews the opposition must have succeeded in\r\nconvincing the king that an electoral victory of Goga would react most\r\nacutely against the king himself. In that case he would no longer\r\nbe able to get rid of the ghosts he had called in; if Goga attained\r\na two-thirds majority, he, the king, would be Goga's captive. These\r\nexpostulations, and the uncontrollable Judaic influences of the Jewish\r\nclique at the Rumanian court, plus the pressure of the French and\r\nBritish Ministers led to a change in the king's attitude, assuming\r\nthat this change had not already been anticipated by him at the time\r\nof Goga's appointment. The king decided to prevent the elections.\r\nGoga resisted. Thereupon the king offered Goga the formation of\r\nan authoritarian government, i.e., a government created solely by\r\nvirtue of royal sovereignty. That meant a coup d'etat. Goga declined.\r\nThereupon the king informed Goga that he would accept the cabinet's\r\nresignation, which, however, had not even been offered to him. Goga\r\nrealized too late that the strength at his disposal was entirely\r\ninadequate to thwart the king's plans. He resigned.\r\n\r\nBut the course once embarked upon forced even the king to pay heed\r\nto the mood that had been created in the country. Also, a return to\r\nthe disrupted foreign-policy ties was no longer possible. Although an\r\nauthoritarian system had been built up, Rumania found herself without\r\nher former backing. The French security system had been ruptured and\r\ncould not be re-established, if only in view of Yugoslavia's attitude\r\nin the South-East, where relations established by other German agencies\r\nhad simultaneously loosened the cohesiveness of the Little Entente.\r\nThat, at any rate, was the Goga government's success.\r\n\r\nIn his last great speech to the Rumania Academy, shortly before his\r\ndeath, Goga welcomed Austria's affiliation with Germany, and affirmed\r\nfor the last time his belief in adherence to new Greater German Reich\r\nand to Fascist Italy, a belief he had struggled for.\r\n\r\nNow the king's war of extermination against the Iron Guard began.\r\nCodreanu was arrested with his closest collaborators, to face a\r\nspecially convoked court-martial. Sole basis for the prosecution was an\r\nalleged communication from Codreanu to the Fuehrer, which was proved\r\nto be a forgery, and a telegram addressed to the Fuehrer. On the\r\nbasis of these \"records\" he was sentenced to ten years' hard labor.\r\nIn vain did the Bureau attempt to bring about an intervention of the\r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs in this episode, which diminished the\r\nwhole prestige of the German Reich. It did not prevail against the\r\nofficial agencies, which condemned the entire project of the Bureau in\r\nRumania, because the official German delegation expected their sole\r\nsalvation from the attitude of the king and his creatures. Logically,\r\nthe acceptance without dissent of this challenge was interpreted in\r\nBucharest as granting carte blanche and Codreanu was shot with his\r\nclosest collaborators for establishment of the first personal contact\r\nbetween the King and the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nThis appeared to doom the Iron Guard, too, Goga's party, deprived of\r\nhis leadership, was submerged into insignificance. But Goga left behind\r\na personal heir, who is now Marshal Antonescu. Against the king's\r\nwish, Goga had appointed this politically insignificant provincial\r\ngeneral, with whom the king was on bad terms, as his Minister of\r\nWar. At first, completely pro French in outlook, Antonescu gradually\r\nadopted a different view under Goga's influence. After Goga's\r\nresignation, Antonescu still remained in the king's cabinet at Goga's\r\nwish. He also maintained continued relations with the Iron Guard.\r\nThereby the possibility of eliminating the king was at hand--and was\r\nexploited. Antonescu's to-day appears in practice as executor of the\r\nheritage bequeathed to him by Goga, who had led him from political\r\ninsignificance into the political arena. Thereby a change to Germany's\r\nliking had become possible in Rumania.\r\n\r\n  [signed] ROSENBERG\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 014-PS\r\n\r\nReport to the Fuehrer\r\n\r\nI report the arrival of the principal shipment of ownerless Jewish\r\n\"cultural property\" [Kulturgut] in the salvage location Neuschwanstein\r\nby special train on Saturday the 15th of this month. It was secured\r\nby my staff for Special Purposes [Einsatzstab] in Paris. The especial\r\ntrain, arranged for by Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering, comprised\r\n25 express baggage cars filled with the most valuable paintings,\r\nfurniture, Gobelins, works of artistic craftsmanship and ornaments.\r\nThe shipment consisted chiefly of the most important parts of the\r\ncollections Rothschild, Seligmann, Bernheim-Jeune, Halphen, Kann,\r\nWeil-Picard, Wildenstein, David-Weill, Levy-Benzion.\r\n\r\nMy Staff for Special Purposes started the confiscatory action in\r\nParis during October 1940 on the basis of your order, my Fuehrer.\r\nWith the help of the Security Service (SD) and the Secret Field\r\nPolice [Geheime Feldpolizei] all storage--and hiding-places of\r\nart possessions belonging to the fugitive Jewish emigrants were\r\nsystematically ascertained. These possessions were then collected in\r\nthe locations provided for by the Louvre in Paris. The art historians\r\nof my staff have itemized scientifically the complete art-material\r\nand have photographed all works of value. Thus, after completion,\r\nI shall be able to submit to you shortly a conclusive catalogue of\r\nall confiscated works with exact data about origin plus scientific\r\nevaluation and description. At this time the inventory includes more\r\nthan 4000 individual pieces of art, partly of the highest artistic\r\nvalue. Besides this special train the masterpieces selected by the\r\nReichsmarschall--mainly from the Rothschild collection--have been\r\nforwarded in two special cars to Munich already some time ago.\r\nThey have been deposited there in the air raid shelters of the\r\nFuehrer-building.\r\n\r\nAccording to instruction the chief special train has been unloaded in\r\nFussen. The cases containing pictures, furniture etc. have been stored\r\nin the castle Neuschwanstein. My deputies accompanied the special train\r\nand took care of the unloading in Neuschwanstein too.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the paintings have to be unpacked to determine any\r\npossible damage suffered during the transport. Furthermore, the\r\nobservation of climatic influences upon the paintings and their future\r\ncareful maintenance necessitate their unpacking as well as their\r\nskillful setting-up. Due to lack of time a part of the shipment has not\r\nyet been fully inventoried in Paris. This has to be taken care of by my\r\nco-workers on the spot in Neuschwanstein to supplement the inventory\r\nin full. I have detached for Neuschwanstein the necessary technical\r\nand scientific personnel of my staff for the execution of this work.\r\nThe required time for the unpacking and arranging in Neuschwanstein as\r\nwell as the preparing of the exhibition rooms will take approximately\r\n4 weeks. I shall report the completion of the work to you then, and\r\nrequest you, my Fuehrer, to let me show you the salvaged works of art\r\nat the spot. This will give you a survey over the work accomplished by\r\nmy staff for Special Purposes.\r\n\r\nOver and above the chief shipment there are secured in Paris a mass of\r\nadditional abandoned Jewish art possessions. These are being processed\r\nin the same sense and prepared for shipment to Germany. Exact accounts\r\nabout the extent of this remaining shipment are at the moment not\r\navailable. However, it is estimated that the work in the Western areas\r\nwill be finished entirely within two to three months. Then a second\r\ntransport can be brought to Germany.\r\n\r\n Berlin, 20 March 1941\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 015-PS\r\n\r\n[Rosenberg Letter and Report to Hitler]\r\n\r\n  16 April 1943\r\n  673/R/Ma\r\n\r\n  Mr Fuehrer:\r\n\r\nIn my desire to give you, my Fuehrer, some joy for your birthday I take\r\nthe liberty to present to you a folder containing photos of some of the\r\nmost valuable paintings which my special purpose staff [Einsatzstab],\r\nin compliance with your order, secured from ownerless Jewish art\r\ncollections in the occupied western territories. These photos represent\r\nan addition to the collection of 53 of the most valuable objects of art\r\ndelivered some time ago to your collection. This folder also shows\r\nonly a small percentage of the exceptional value and extent of these\r\nobjects of art, seized by my service command [Dienststelle] in France,\r\nand put into a safe place on the Reich.\r\n\r\nI beg of you, my Fuehrer, to give me a chance during my next audience\r\nto report to you orally on the whole extent and scope of this art\r\nseizure action. I beg you to accept a short written intermediate report\r\nof the progress and extent of the art seizure action which will be\r\nused as a basis for this later oral report, and also accept 3 copies\r\nof the temporary picture catalogues which, too, only show part of the\r\ncollection you own. I shall deliver further catalogues which are now\r\nbeing compiled, when they are finished. I shall take the liberty during\r\nthe requested audience to give you, my Fuehrer, another 20 folders of\r\npictures, with the hope that this short occupation with the beautiful\r\nthings of art which are nearest to your heart will send a ray of beauty\r\nand joy into your revered life.\r\n\r\n  Heil, my Fuehrer\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Intermediate Report of the Seizure of Ownerless Jewish Art\r\n Possessions, by the Special Purpose Staff [Einsatzstab] of\r\n Reichsleiter Rosenberg in the Occupied Western Territories.\r\n\r\nThe seizure action began in compliance with the Fuehrer order of\r\n17 Sept 1940. At first those art collections were seized which the\r\nJews, fleeing from occupied territories, left behind in Paris. The\r\nseizure action was extended to all remaining cities and villages of\r\nthe occupied French territory where it was thought that Jewish art\r\ncollections might be hidden. By using all possible ways and means we\r\ndiscovered and seized all Jewish art collections which were hidden\r\neither in Jewish homes in Paris, in castles in the provinces or in\r\nwarehouses and other storage places. The seizure action was in part\r\nvery difficult and tedious and, up to now, not all completed. The\r\nescaped Jews knew how to camouflage the hiding places of these objects\r\nof art, and to find them was made more difficult by the Frenchmen\r\noriginally charged with the administration of the hiding places. The\r\nspecial purpose staff [Einsatzstab] in connection with the security\r\npolice [Sicherheitsdienst-SD], the squad for the protection of the\r\nforeign currency market [Devisenschutzkommando] and by using their own\r\ningenuity succeeded in securing the main part of art collections, left\r\nbehind by the escaped Jews, and bringing it safely to the Reich. The\r\nmost important part of the action was the securing of 79 collections\r\nof well-known Jewish art collectors in France. The list of collections\r\nis attached hereto. Top place on the list is taken by the famous\r\ncollections of the Jewish family of Rothschild. The difficulty of the\r\nseizure action is shown by the fact that the Rothschild collections\r\nwere distributed over various places in Paris, in Bordeaux and in the\r\nLoire castles of the Rothschilds, and could only be found after a long\r\nand tedious search. Although the action covered the past 2 years, we\r\ndiscovered and secured, through the use of trusted agents, quite a\r\nlarge part of the Rothschild collection in 1942.\r\n\r\nBesides the seizure of these complete Jewish art collections, we also\r\nsearched all vacant Jewish apartments in Paris and other places for\r\nsingle art objects which might have been left behind. The main job in\r\nthis action was to ascertain all addresses of Jews, escaped from the\r\noccupied territories, since we had to overcome quite a few difficulties\r\non the part of the French police force which naturally tried their best\r\nto retard our progress. During this search through hundreds of single\r\nJewish apartments a large amount of art objects were secured.\r\n\r\nThese in this manner secured collections and single pieces of art\r\nwere transferred to central collecting points in Paris, located in\r\nthe so-called Jeu de Paume and rooms of the Louvre. The art expert of\r\nthe special purpose staff inventoried, photographed and packed all\r\nsecured objects of art. Taking the inventory was made more difficult\r\nby the fact that all data pertaining to the collection were suppressed\r\nby the former owners. For this reason each art object had to be\r\nexamined separately for origin, place where found, and period. The\r\nwork is so designed that at its conclusion the finished inventory\r\nwill represent an unimpeachable document, as far as the historical\r\nbackground of the art collection is concerned. It will show, on one\r\nside, the monetary, and on the other, the historical value. The Jewish\r\nowners and collectors only judged these collections by their material\r\nvalue. Consequently they did not recognize the historical value and\r\ntherefore showed no inclination to make these collections available\r\nfor research. However, this research has now been accomplished by the\r\nsorely understaffed special purpose staff. All their findings were\r\nincorporated into 3 temporary books which will serve as basis for one\r\ncatalogue, soon to be compiled.\r\n\r\nDuring the time from 17 Sept 1940 to 7 April 1943, 10 transports of 92\r\ncars or a total of 2775 crates were sent to Germany. The contents of\r\nthe crates were: paintings, antique furniture, Gobelins, objects of\r\nart, etc. Besides all this another special transport of 53 art objects\r\nwas shipped to the Fuehrerbau in Muenchen, and 594 pieces (paintings,\r\nplastics, furniture, textiles) delivered to Reichs Marshal [Goering].\r\n\r\nCastle Neuschanstein was designated as the first shelter. After\r\nthis castle was filled, the Bavarian administration for state-owned\r\ncastles and parks saw fit to relinquish several rooms in the castle\r\nHerrenchiemsee for further shipments.\r\n\r\nSince these 2 shelters were not enough and since the Bavarian\r\nadministration could not supply any more we rented 2 more in the\r\nneighborhood; it was made possible through the intervention of the\r\nState Treasurer [Reichsschatzmeister]. We rented several rooms in the\r\nformer Salesianer monastery at Buxheim near Memmingen in Schwaben and\r\nthe privately owned castle Kogl near Voecklabruck at Upper Austria\r\n[Oberdonau]. The location and condition of these 2 shelters is such\r\nthat they are perfect in regards to safety against air attack and fire,\r\nand can easily be guarded. All art objects are so divided between the\r\n4 shelters that it is possible to continue the inventory and care, and\r\nthat no large collections of valuable art objects will be concentrated\r\nin any one place. All measures for safety are taken care of by the\r\ncombined efforts of: 1. the Bavarian administration for castles and\r\nparks, 2. the central control of the fire prevention police, and 3.\r\nthe local representatives of State and Party. In this way the highest\r\ndegree of safety has been achieved.\r\n\r\n_9455 articles_ in the aforementioned shelters have been completely\r\ninventoried, as of 1 April 1943. The inventory is as follows:\r\n\r\n  5255 Paintings\r\n   297 Sculptures\r\n  1372 Pieces antique furniture\r\n   307 Textiles\r\n  2224 Small objects of art, including East-Asiatic art\r\n\r\nThe inventory in addition to records of seizure and lists of seizure\r\nand transport, follows the pattern of the enclosed file card\r\n[Karteikarte]. On this file card is noted all information necessary\r\nto characterize all objects as to origin, master, technique, time,\r\netc. These file cards together with the extended explanations of the\r\nmen charged with taking the inventory constitute the basis for the\r\nediting of the master catalogue. Besides this there is in preparation\r\na photo-library in one of the central offices in Berlin, as well as in\r\nNeuschwanstein. Since the number of technicians was small, the time\r\nshort, and the necessity of a quick expert from Paris was paramount,\r\nonly the most valuable objects were inventoried in Paris. Therefore\r\nthe inventory has to be continued in the shelters. According to\r\nthe latest count there are approximately 10,000 more objects to be\r\ninventoried.\r\n\r\nAt present there are 400 crates in Paris, ready for shipment which will\r\nbe sent to the Reich as soon as necessary preliminary work in Paris\r\nis completed. Should the present 4 shelters not prove sufficient for\r\nconsequent shipments, 2 more places, namely the castle Bruck near Linz\r\nand the camp Seisenegg near Amstetten on the lower Danube have been\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of fire prevention all art objects in the shelters had\r\nto be unpacked skillfully. These measures were also necessary to\r\naccomplish the inventory and to continue with the care of the valuable\r\nart objects. Restoration has begun since many needed it when we\r\nacquired them. At present a repair shop with all necessary tools is\r\nbeing outfitted in Fuessen in which all paintings, pieces of furniture\r\nand other objects will be restored, to safeguard preservation. The\r\nunpacking, the continuation of the inventory, and the establishment of\r\nthe photo-library, and too, the editing of the master catalogue, will\r\ntake considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe action of seizure [Fassungaktion] in Paris and occupied Western\r\nterritories will be continued, although on a reduced scale, since\r\nthere are still new art objects of great value to be found. The\r\nadministration of the East not only will seize furniture, but also\r\nthe art objects which might yet be found there. Here too valuable art\r\nobjects were found in the last months. These art objects, found during\r\nthe collection of furniture, were also sent to the shelters and will\r\nreceive the same treatment as the others. Besides these objects, whose\r\nart value is established, hundreds of modern French paintings were\r\nseized which from the German standpoint are without value as far as the\r\nnational-socialist art conception is concerned. These works of modern\r\nFrench painters will be listed separately, for a later decision as to\r\ntheir disposition.\r\n\r\nOn orders from the Reichs Marshal some of the works of modern and\r\ndegenerate French art were exchanged in Paris for paintings of known\r\nvalue. The exchange was of great advantage to us, since we received 87\r\nworks by Italian, Dutch and German masters who are known to be of great\r\nvalue. We shall continue to trade whenever a chance presents itself.

Besides the heroic and victorious\r\nconduct against an enemy of an unheard of superiority in number and\r\nmaterial, and fighting with the courage of utter despair and beastly\r\nbrutality, stands the endurance of hardships unparalleled in history\r\nof severest winter of cold, ice, snow and story since 140 years. The\r\nconquest of the unbelievable difficulties arising from such a climate\r\nand terrible weather conditions elevates our soldiers of the East\r\nFront, by comparison with the human and soldierly efforts of all times\r\nup to now, without exaggeration, to supermen.\r\n\r\nIt is now the duty of the Home Front towards those soldiers to summon\r\nall its strength for an equally gigantic effort to enable them to win\r\ncomplete, final and most rapid victory.\r\n\r\nAll the burdens and further necessary restrictions, even in the field\r\nof nutrition, must be endured with proud determination in consideration\r\nof the shining example of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nOur Armed Forces of Greater Germany surpassed themselves in heroism,\r\nresistance and endurance at the Front of the East, in Africa, in\r\nthe air and on the sea. To insure their victory in any case, it\r\nis necessary now to produce more and better weapons, materiel and\r\nammunition through another increased effort and endeavor of the entire\r\nGerman people, that is, all the producing workers, intellectual and\r\nmanual, the women and the entire German Youth.\r\n\r\nIn this manner will the German Home Front contribute decisively to the\r\nfrustration of the hopes of our enemies to again escape their complete\r\nand final defeat.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this new, gigantic labor mobilization is to use all the rich\r\nand tremendous sources, conquered and secured for us by our fighting\r\nArmed Forces under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, for the armament\r\nof the Armed Forces and also for the nutrition of the Homeland. The\r\nraw-materials as well as the fertility of the conquered territories and\r\ntheir human labor power are to be used completely and conscientiously\r\nto the profit of Germany and their allies.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that most of the German people capable of doing\r\nso have already made a most commendable effort for the war economy,\r\nmore considerable reserves must be found and made available under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe decisive measure to realize this is in the uniformly regulated and\r\ndirected Labor-mobilization of the nation in the war.\r\n\r\nTo reach this goal, the following principles must be worked out and\r\nexecuted:\r\n\r\nA. All important Production Programs, actually in progress, must under\r\nno circumstances be disturbed by the new measures. On the contrary,\r\nthey should even be increased.\r\n\r\nB. All orders of the Fuehrer, Reichs-Fieldmarshal of the Greater German\r\nReich and the \"Minister\" for ammunition and armament are to be carried\r\nout as quickly as possible. Labor supply necessary for that purpose\r\nmust be freed and made available either in Germany or in the occupied\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nC. The task concerning the seed and harvest of German peasantry and\r\nall the territories under German control with the view to secure the\r\nlargest production is just as urgent. The lacking laborers must be made\r\navailable as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nD. A supply system for the vitally necessary materials for the German\r\npeople will be assured.\r\n\r\nThe realization of these principles for labor-mobilization requires:\r\n\r\n1. The cooperation of all the forces of the party, economy and the\r\nstate under coordinated leadership.\r\n\r\n2. The best will of all the German people.\r\n\r\n3. The most far-reaching measures to imbue all the employed German\r\nworkmen and women with the highest confidence in the justice of the\r\nconsideration of their own personal welfare and their salaries as well\r\nas the best possible care for their health and shelter under the actual\r\nwar circumstances.\r\n\r\n4. The quickest and best solution of the question of the use of women\r\nand youth labor.\r\n\r\nTo reach the goal determined by the Fuehrer the simultaneous and\r\nquickest use of numerous different measures of unified purpose are\r\nabsolutely necessary. As any one of those must not interfere with the\r\nothers, but rather complement them, it is also absolutely necessary\r\nthat all the offices [Dienststellen] in the Reich, its territories\r\nand communities, in party, state and economy, participating in this\r\ndecisive task act according to coordinated, synchronized directives.\r\n\r\nThus, the labor-mobilization of the nation contributes extraordinarily\r\nto the quickest and victorious termination of the war. It requires\r\nevery effort of the German people on the Home front. It is for that\r\nGerman people, for their preservation, their freedom, happiness and\r\namelioration of their nutrition and standards of living that this war\r\nis being fought.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Principles\r\n\r\nI. In the districts [Gau], it is the task of the district-chief\r\n[Gauleiter] to take in his hands the propaganda and orientation of the\r\nGerman people concerning the necessity of labor-mobilization and to\r\ncarry out important measures for the care of the employed youth and\r\nwomen as well as to supervise the condition of camps and shelters.\r\n\r\nThey also assure themselves of the closest and friendliest cooperation\r\nof all the participating institutions.\r\n\r\nII. It is not only the most distinguished duty of the General\r\nPlenipotentiary, but a condition sine qua non for the success of his\r\ntask, to assure himself of the utmost cooperation and understanding\r\nof all the highest Reichs-Bureaus [Reichs-stellen], especially those\r\noffices [Dienststellen] of the Armed Forces whose departments are\r\nconcerned with his task.\r\n\r\nIII. Equally necessary is the mutual understanding of all the\r\nReichs-leaders [Reichsleiter] of the party, especially the cooperation\r\nof the German Labor Front [Deutsche Arbeitsfront] and the institutions\r\nof economy.\r\n\r\nIV. The General Plenipotentiary for labor mobilization will therefore\r\nuse with the help of the smallest, personal staff of assistants the\r\nexisting party, state and economic institutions and assure the quickest\r\nsuccess of his measure with the good will and the cooperation of all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nV. The General Plenipotentiary for labor mobilization has therefore,\r\nwith the consent of the Fuehrer and the knowledge of the Reichsmarshal\r\nof Greater Germany and the director [Leiter] of the Party Chancellory\r\n[Reichskanzlei] appointed all the district chiefs [Gauleiters] as his\r\nplenipotentiaries in the German Districts of the National Socialist\r\nParty.\r\n\r\nVI. The plenipotentiaries for labor mobilization are using all the\r\noffices of the Party in their district. The chiefs of the highest\r\noffices of the State and economy of their districts will assist\r\nand advise the District chiefs in all matters concerning the labor\r\nmobilization.\r\n\r\nThe most important for that purpose would be the following:\r\n\r\n The President of the Land Labor Office [Praesident des\r\n Landesarbeitsamtes],\r\n\r\n The Trustee for Labor, [Treuhaender der Arbeit],\r\n\r\n The leader of the Peasants [Landesbauernfuehrer],\r\n\r\n The economic adviser of the district [Gauwirtschaftsberator],\r\n\r\n The District Superintendant of the German Labor Front [Gauobmann der\r\n Deutschen Arbeitsfront],\r\n\r\n The leader of the womanhood of the district [Gaufrauenschaftsleiterin],\r\n\r\n The leader of the Hitler Youth of the region [Gebietsfuehrer der\r\n Hitler-Jugend],\r\n\r\n The highest representative of the interior and general administration,\r\n and of the office for Agriculture [der hoechste Vertreter der Inneren\r\n und Allgemeinen Verwaltung bzw. des Landeswirtschaftsamtes].\r\n\r\nShould the confines [Bezirk] of a Land-Labor Office comprise several\r\nDistricts, it seems advisable that the President of the Land-Labor\r\nOffice in question should make available to the District Chief, in\r\nwhose district capital there is no Land-Labor Office, his closest and\r\nmost capable assistants in such a way that also in those offices the\r\ncontinuous information and instruction of the district-chiefs about all\r\nthe measures concerning the labor-mobilization remains assured.\r\n\r\nVII. The most distinguished and important task of the district-chiefs\r\nof the National Socialist Party in their capacity as plenipotentiaries\r\nin their districts consists in assuring the best understanding and\r\ncooperation of all the offices of their districts participating in the\r\nlabor-mobilization.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be strictly observed that the dignitaries\r\nof the party and the offices of the National Socialist Party, its\r\norganizations, sub-divisions and attached institutions do not assume\r\nfunctions coming under the jurisdiction of the State, the Armed Forces\r\nor economic institutions and for which only those authorities are\r\nresponsible; they are not to interfere with official business not\r\ncoming under their jurisdiction, according to the wish of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nShould we succeed with the help of the Party in convincing all the\r\nGerman intellectual and manual workers of the great importance of the\r\nlabor-mobilization for the outcome of the war, and succeed in taking\r\ngood care and keeping up the morale of all the men, women, and the\r\nGerman youths who work within the labor-mobilization program under\r\nextraordinarily strenuous circumstances, as far as their physical\r\nand mental capabilities of endurance are concerned, and should we\r\nfurthermore be able, also with the help of the party, to use prisoners\r\nof war as well as civilian workmen and women of foreign blood not only\r\nwithout harm to our own people but to the greatest advantage to our\r\nwar and nutrition industries, then we will have accomplished the most\r\ndifficult part of the labor mobilization program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Task and its Solution\r\n\r\n(No figures are mentioned because of security reasons. I can\r\nassure you, nevertheless, that we are concerned with the greatest\r\nlabor-problem of all times, especially with regard to figures.)\r\n\r\nA. The Task:\r\n\r\n1. The conscription of new soldiers to a gigantic extent for all\r\nbranches and services of the Armed Forces has been rendered necessary\r\nby the present war-situation.\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n\r\n_a._ The removal of workers from all professional enterprises,\r\nespecially of a great number of trained personnel from armament\r\nproducing war industries.\r\n\r\n_b._ Also the removal of especially non-essential personnel from the\r\nwar nutrition industry.\r\n\r\n2. The war situation also necessitates the continuation of the\r\ntremendously increased and improved armament programs as ordered by the\r\nFuehrer.\r\n\r\n3. The most essential commodities for the German people must continue\r\nto be produced for minimum requirements.\r\n\r\n4. The German housewife's health, particularly the health of those on\r\nthe farms, must not be endangered in their quality as mothers by the\r\nwar. On the contrary, they must be relieved in every possible way.\r\n\r\nB. The Solution:\r\n\r\n1. All skilled workers removed from defense plants through induction\r\ninto the Armed Forces must absolutely and immediately be replaced in\r\nsuch a way that no bottleneck or decrease in the production of the war\r\nproduct results. It is the responsibility of all the authorities for\r\nthe labor mobilization to make sure that this directive is considered\r\nin each case.\r\n\r\nThe most capable workers must, therefore, be removed from the reserves\r\nof discontinued, lesser defense installations, and the discontinued\r\nconstruction industry and be made available to the enterprises from\r\nwhich specialists are being called into the Armed Forces, 8 weeks\r\nbefore their actual induction, in order to enable them to instruct and\r\nfamiliarize their replacement with their work.\r\n\r\n2. Workmen or women available because of destruction or damage of their\r\ninstallations must just as quickly be made available and incorporated\r\nagain in the war industry.\r\n\r\n3. The Armament and Nutrition tasks make it vitally necessary, not only\r\nto include the entire German labor power but also to call on foreign\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I immediately tripled the transport program which I found\r\nwhen I took charge of my mission.\r\n\r\nThe main effort of that transport has been advanced into the months of\r\nMay-June in order to assure in time and under any circumstances the\r\navailability of foreign labor power from the occupied territories for\r\nan increased production, in view of coming operations of the army,\r\nas well as agricultural labor in the sector of the German Nutrition\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\nAll prisoners of war, from the territories of the West as well of the\r\nEast, actually in Germany, must be completely incorporated into the\r\nGerman armament and nutrition industries. Their production must be\r\nbrought to the highest possible level.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasized, however, that an additional tremendous quantity\r\nof foreign labor has to be found for the Reich. The greatest pool for\r\nthat purpose are the occupied territories of the East.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is an immediate necessity to use the human reserves\r\nof the conquered Soviet territory to the fullest extent. Should we\r\nnot succeed in obtaining the necessary amount of labor on a voluntary\r\nbasis, we must immediately institute conscription or forced labor.\r\n\r\nApart from the prisoners of war still in the occupied territories,\r\nwe must, therefore, requisition skilled or unskilled male and female\r\nlabor from the Soviet territory from the age of 15 up for the\r\nlabor-mobilization.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one quarter of the total need of foreign labor can\r\nbe procured in Europe's occupied territories West of Germany, according\r\nto existing possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe procurement of labor from friendly and also neutral countries can\r\nonly cover a small part of the total need. Practically only skilled\r\nworkers and specialists can be considered in this case.\r\n\r\n4. In order to relieve considerably the German housewife, especially\r\nthe mother with many children and the extremely busy farm-woman and in\r\norder to avoid any further danger to their health, the Fuehrer also\r\ncharged me with the procurement of 400,000-500,000 selected, healthy\r\nand strong girls from the territories of the East for Germany.\r\n\r\n5. The spring cultivation of the fields [Fruehjahrsbestellung] will be\r\nassured by the use of the German youth in class-formation, together\r\nwith their teachers according to an agreement with Reichs-Youth-Leader\r\n[Reichsjugendfuehrer] and the responsible, highest Reichs-Authorities.\r\n\r\n6. The labor mobilization of the German women is of very great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nExamining this very difficult problem and after getting thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the fundamental opinion of the Fuehrer as well as of\r\nthe Reichsmarshal of the Greater German Reich and my own most careful\r\ninquiries and their results, I must absolutely reject the possibility\r\nof having an obligatory service decreed by the State for all German\r\nwomen and girls for the German War and Nutrition industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough, at the beginning, I myself, and probably the majority of\r\nthe leading personalities of the party and of the womanhood with me,\r\nbelieved that for certain reasons an obligatory service for women\r\nshould be decreed, I am of the opinion that all responsible men and\r\nwomen in party, state and economy should accept with the greatest\r\nveneration and gratitude the judgment of our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler,\r\nwhose greatest concern has always been the health of the German women\r\nand girls; in other words, the present and future mothers of our nation.\r\n\r\nI cannot enumerate all the reasons which made me come to that decision.\r\nI only ask for confidence in me as an old fanatical district chief of\r\nthe National Socialist party and to believe that this could be the only\r\npossible decision.\r\n\r\nWe all agree that this decision might appear unjust towards millions\r\nof women who are engaged in defense and nutrition industries under the\r\nmost strenuous conditions but we also realize that an evil cannot be\r\nremedied by spreading it to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThe only possible way to eliminate the existing injustices and\r\nhardships consists in winning the war in order to enable us to remove\r\nall women and girls engaged from jobs unsuitable for women, namely\r\nendangering their health, the birth-rate of our nation, and family and\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\nWe must also consider the difference, whether a woman or girl has been\r\nused to work in the field or in a factory because of her young age, and\r\nwhether already she has proved to be able to stand this kind of work.\r\n\r\nAside from physical harm, the German women and girls under any\r\ncircumstances must be protected from moral and mental harm according to\r\nthe wish of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that these conditions could be fulfilled in the case\r\nof mass-conscription and employment. It is impossible to compare the\r\nGerman Woman with the German soldier in this case, because of the\r\nexisting fundamental natural and racial differences between man and\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWe cannot accept the responsibility for the dangers threatening the\r\nlife of the nation resulting from such a measure in the field of women\r\nlabor mobilization, in view of the countless men on the fighting\r\nfront--our dead soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe many millions of women, however, faithfully and industriously\r\nengaged in the German economy, and especially now, in war time,\r\nrendering valuable services, deserve the best possible care and\r\nconsideration. They, as well as the soldiers and workmen, deserve\r\nthe greatest gratitude of our nation. They must be treated in the\r\nbest possible way by the labor offices and labor authorities and\r\ntheir economic and health necessities must be generously considered.\r\nThe Fuehrer as well as the Reichsmarshal of the Greater German Reich\r\nattach the greatest value to those measures. For instance, it would be\r\ncompletely wrong to threaten pregnant women with punishment and court\r\nprocedures, as has happened already, if they miss a day of work because\r\nof troubles resulting from their condition during the usual period\r\nof precaution [Schonungsperiode]. Nevertheless, it must and will be\r\npossible to maintain the necessary work discipline.\r\n\r\n7. A last, but also important reserve consists in the possibility of\r\nthe personal increased production of each German worker. It will be\r\nthe most distinguished task of the party and the German labor front to\r\nachieve that increased production. There is no doubt that the German\r\nintellectual and mental worker will accomplish it, no matter where he\r\nworks and in spite of the difficult conditions of our present nutrition.\r\n\r\nThis will be the best way for the German worker on the home front to\r\nexpress his gratitude towards the soldier on the fighting front who\r\nbears the most gigantic and terrible hardships in this severe winter,\r\nthus remaining victorious over our enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is also the task of the party, State and economy in cooperation to\r\nimprove the sick rate by 1 percent through the adequate cooperation\r\nof health insurance institutions [Krankenkasse] and approved doctors\r\n[Vertrauensarzt]. This was accomplished in the district of Thuringia.\r\nSuch an improvement of the sick rate throughout the Reich would mean\r\nthe gain of 200,000 new workers.\r\n\r\nThe severest measures must be used against loafers, as we can not allow\r\nthose parasites to shunt their duties in this decisive struggle of our\r\npeople at the cost of the others.\r\n\r\nI tried to determine the exterior solution of the task concerning the\r\nlabor mobilization, as conditioned by the present war situation, under\r\nparagraph B, 1-7.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that all the possibilities contained in that\r\nparagraph will be completely exhausted. The rejection of a general\r\nconscription of all the women and girls does not mean that I condemn\r\nabsolutely the use of women and girls who are in a position to make\r\nthemselves available for a suitable job wherever they can be useful to\r\nthe war industry without violating the principles of the Fuehrer. This\r\nwill be done in closest cooperation with the competent offices of the\r\nparty, state, the Armed Forces and the economy.\r\n\r\nThe labor mobilization program as laid down in paragraph 1-7\r\nconstitutes not only the greatest labor mobilization of a people but\r\nalso in history.\r\n\r\nAdolf Hitler, however, made it clear through his idea of National\r\nSocialism that figures are not the decisive factor in the life of\r\nnations. Besides the tremendous figure of the employed labor forces\r\nstands their productive capacity. This productive capacity depends not\r\nonly on the amount of calories, which I put at their disposal in the\r\nform of nourishment, but also on their moral and mental condition.\r\n\r\nThis makes it necessary to consider besides the gigantic,\r\norganizational question, the questions of nutrition, shelter,\r\norientation, propaganda, and spiritual guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasures to be Taken to Assure the Well-Being of German Workmen and\r\nWomen\r\n\r\nThere must be no doubt for the German producing people that they out-do\r\nby far all the other workers of the world through their conscientious\r\nwork and their readiness to accept the most strenuous tasks under\r\nproper political and philosophical guidance.\r\n\r\nThe district Chiefs will at this decisive stage of the war assure with\r\nthe help of all the institutions and organizations of the party the\r\nbest political and ideological care ever known in the history of labor\r\nand humanity in wartime, for the German producing people in their\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nI am convinced in my capacity as general plenipotentiary for labor\r\nmobilization that everything will be done by the party to maintain\r\nwithin or without the plants the attitude and morale of the German\r\nworkers on a high level through the use of all means of propaganda and\r\norientation, meetings and appeals, as the only way to make the home\r\nfront worthy of the fighting front, and the only means of accomplishing\r\nthis gigantic task and winning the war.\r\n\r\nI will constantly see to it, that the authorities for labor\r\nmobilization as well as the managers of the plants assist the party and\r\nprimarily the German labor front in its decisive and great task in this\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nEven workmen and women employed in war plants in their home towns and\r\nliving and eating with their families must be properly looked after.\r\nI mention only: Provisions of coal and potatoes, consideration of\r\ntheir possibility to get to their place of work. The lack of spring\r\nvegetables and other troubles caused by war conditions and affecting\r\nthe nerves and health of our people must be offset by the strength and\r\nsatisfaction gathered by the realization of the National Socialist\r\nprinciples of folks community [Volksgemeinschaft] social justice and\r\nthe necessity to hold out together and the belief and the confidence in\r\nour Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nThis task becomes much more complicated in the case of those millions\r\nof workmen and women who have been conscripted for labor far from their\r\nhomes in jobs they are not used to. This is a necessity of war.\r\n\r\nSuch utilization of labor power can neither be restricted nor can the\r\nhardships connected with it be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to make life for our folks comrades [Volkskameraden] as\r\nagreeable as possible and to facilitate the conditions of their\r\nutilization. All these German people must be assisted by billeting\r\nthem, if possible, in decently furnished rooms under as decent\r\nconditions, by encouraging companionship during their free time through\r\nthe party and to assure prompt issue of ration tickets and other such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the Politeness-Drive [Aktion \"Hoeflichkeit\"]\r\nintroduced by Reichs-Director party member Dr. Goebbels will be binding\r\nto the utmost for all labor offices and all offices of economy and\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nAll camps where German producing people, men or women, are to be\r\nquartered, must be perfect examples of German cleanliness, order and\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nThe German plants and the German economy must not hesitate to do\r\neverything in their power to make life far from their own homes\r\nand families tolerable for conscripted folks comrades men or women\r\nquartered in those camps. As there is a complete order guaranteed in a\r\nway for the German soldier of the Armed Forces in his company for his\r\nexternal requirements as well as for his character, which elevates him\r\nfar above the soldiers of other nations, so should this also be made\r\npossible in adequately applied form for the producing men within the\r\nlabor mobilization program.\r\n\r\nThe necessary measures for the care of the producing German people\r\nwithin the labor mobilization program should therefore be carried out\r\nto the fullest extent by the German labor front.\r\n\r\nIn case of more extensive commitment of women and girls away from\r\ntheir home towns and families, the rules for shelter and care as\r\napplied by the women's labor service [Weiblichen Arbeitsdienstes] must\r\nfundamentally be respected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrisoners of War and Foreign Workers.\r\n\r\nThe complete employment of all prisoners of war as well as the use of\r\na gigantic number of new foreign civilian workers, men and women, has\r\nbecome an indisputable necessity for the solution of the mobilization\r\nof labor program in this war.\r\n\r\nAll the men must be fed, sheltered and treated in such a way as to\r\nexploit them to the highest possible extent at the lowest conceivable\r\ndegree of expenditure.\r\n\r\nIt has always been natural for us Germans to refrain from cruelty\r\nand mean chicaneries towards the beaten enemy, even if he had proven\r\nhimself the most bestial and most implacable adversary, and to treat\r\nhim correctly and humanly, even when we expect useful work of him.\r\n\r\nAs long as the German defense industry did not make it absolutely\r\nnecessary, we refrained under any circumstances from the use of Soviet\r\nprisoners of war as well as of civilian workers, men or women, from the\r\nSoviet territories. This has now become impossible and the labor power\r\nof these people must now be exploited to the greatest extent.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I arranged my first measures concerning the food,\r\nshelter and treatment of these foreign laborers with the highest\r\ncompetent Reichs-authorities and with the consent of the Fuehrer and\r\nthe Reichsmarshal of the Greater German Reich in such a way that a top\r\nperformance will be demanded and will be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, though, that even the effort of a machine is\r\nconditioned by the amount of fuel, skill and care given to it. How many\r\nmore conditions must be considered in the case of men, even of low kind\r\nand race, than in the case of a machine!\r\n\r\nI could not accept the responsibility towards the German people,\r\nif after having brought such a tremendous number of men to Germany\r\nthese men would one day become a burden for the German people or even\r\nendanger their health, instead of doing very necessary and useful work,\r\nbecause of mistakes made in their nutrition, shelter and treatment.\r\n\r\nThe principles of German cleanliness, order and hygiene must therefore\r\nalso be carefully applied to Russian camps.\r\n\r\nOnly in such a way will it be possible to exploit that labor to the\r\nhighest benefit of arms production for the fighting front and for the\r\nwar nutrition program, without any trace of false sentimentalism.\r\n\r\nThe necessary instructions concerning the food, shelter and treatment\r\nof the people from the East have been communicated to the competent\r\nauthorities of the police, defense and nutrition bureaus; beyond that,\r\nI turn to the district-chiefs of the National Socialist Party with the\r\nrequest to assist me also in this field to the best of their abilities,\r\nin order to avoid any harm that might result from the use of that kind\r\nof labor to the German people.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of blood-related, allied and friendly nations are to be\r\ntreated with particular care and consideration.\r\n\r\nAll action making the stay and work in Germany more difficult and\r\nunnecessarily unbearable for the foreign workers and exceeding the\r\nrestrictions and hardships imposed by the war must be avoided. We\r\ndepend to a large extent on their good will and their production.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore only logical to make their stay and work in Germany as\r\nbearable as possible--without denying anything to ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis can be realized, for instance, by facilitating their national and\r\nfolk [volkstuemlich] habits concerning food, shelter, and organization\r\nof their evenings after work, etc., as far as conditions and the\r\nconsideration of our own people permit.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that, if the authorities for the labor\r\nmobilization, the general and interior administration, party and labor\r\nfront cooperate in close harmony in this mobilization of foreign\r\nworkmen and women, the tremendous advantage resulting from this mass\r\ncommitment of millions of prisoners of war and foreign, civilian\r\nworking men and women for the German defense and nutrition industries\r\nmay be supplemented by an equal success for the propaganda of the\r\nnational socialist Great German Reich and for its prestige throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the greatest harm for our war industry may result if\r\nthe cooperation of all forces involved is not assured and all those\r\nproblems are not solved by all competent offices.\r\n\r\nTherefore in closing I would ask you to observe the following\r\nprinciples carefully:\r\n\r\n1. All technical and administrative matters for the labor mobilization\r\ncome exclusively under the authority and responsibility of the General\r\nPlenipotentiary for Labor Mobilization, the National Labor Offices\r\n[Landesarbeitsaemter] and the Labor Offices [Arbeitsaemter].\r\n\r\n2. All questions and tasks concerning propaganda orientation,\r\nobservation of political consequences and care (of people engaged in\r\nthis labor-mobilization program) come under the jurisdiction of:\r\n\r\n_a._ The party, if outside of the plant\r\n\r\n_b._ The German Labor Front for manufacturing plants, the Bureau for\r\nfarm politics [Amt fuer Agrarpolitik] for agricultural enterprises.\r\n\r\n3. The issue of food and clothing ration cards, financial indemnities\r\nand relief come exclusively under the jurisdiction of the competent\r\nauthorities or institutions of economy.\r\n\r\nAsk the district chiefs of the National Socialist Party, as my\r\nplenipotentiaries, to assure a smooth cooperation between those various\r\nbureaus as well as the best possible harmony and mutual complete\r\nexchange of information.\r\n\r\n4. The solution of the task concerning the war mobilization of labor\r\nis of such decisive importance that even the most important local or\r\nregional interests concerning most vital peace tasks must not interfere\r\nwith it. Whoever violates that rule must be made responsible if the\r\nGerman soldier in his decisive struggle for the fate of our nation\r\nlacks arms and ammunition, synthetic gasoline or rubber, vehicles or\r\nairplanes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I want to deeply impress upon all the men and women who\r\nparticipate decisively in this war in the labor mobilization program\r\nwith insistence to comply with all those necessities, decisions and\r\nmeasures, according to the old National Socialist principle:\r\n\r\nNothing for us, everything for the Fuehrer and his work, that is, for\r\nthe future of our Nation!\r\n\r\n  [signed]: Fritz Sauckel\r\n\r\n  [Stamp]\r\n\r\n  (The Deputy for the 4 year plan\r\n  The General Plenipotentiary for labor mobilization)\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 017-PS\r\n\r\nCopy /T\r\n\r\n  The Deputy for the Four Year Plan\r\n  The General Deputy for the Mobilization of Labor\r\n  Va.

The Fuehrer therefore has granted me, for the execution\r\nof my decree of 21 March 1942, new powers for my new duties, and\r\nhas especially authorized me to take whatever measures I think are\r\nnecessary in the Reich, the Protectorate, the General Gouvernement, as\r\nwell as in the occupied territories, in order to assure at all costs\r\nan orderly mobilization of labor for the German armament industry.\r\nThe additional required labor forces will have to be drafted for the\r\nmajority from the recently occupied eastern territories especially\r\nfrom the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Therefore the Reichskommissariat\r\nUkraine must furnish 225,000 labor forces by 31 December 1942 and\r\n225,000 more by 1 May 1943. I ask you to inform Reichskommissar\r\nGauleiter party fellow member Koch about the new situation and\r\nrequirements and especially to see to it that he will support\r\npersonally in any possible way the execution of this new requirement.\r\n\r\nI have the intention to visit Party member Koch shortly, and I would\r\nbe grateful to you if you could inform me as to where and when I could\r\nmeet him for a personal discussion.\r\n\r\nRight now though, I ask that the procurement be taken up at once with\r\nevery possible pressure and the commitment of all powers especially\r\nalso of the experts of the labor offices. All the directives which had\r\nlimited temporarily the procurement of Eastern laborers are annulled.\r\nThe Reichs procurement for the next months must be given priority over\r\nall other measures.\r\n\r\nI do not ignore the difficulties which exist for the execution of\r\nthis new requirement, but I am convinced that with the ruthless\r\ncommitment of all resources, and with the full cooperation of all those\r\ninterested, the execution of the new demands can be accomplished for\r\nthe fixed date. I have already communicated the new demands to the\r\nReichskommissar Ukraine via mail.\r\n\r\nIn reference to our long distance phone call of today, I will send you\r\nthe text of the Fuehrer's decree at the beginning of next week.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Your devoted\r\n  [signed] FRITZ SAUCKEL\r\n  [stamp] Certified conform to the original\r\n  [signed] ACKERMANN clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 018-PS\r\n\r\nThe Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories\r\n\r\n  21 December 1942\r\n  Nr. 02926/42\r\n\r\n  To Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel\r\n  General deputy for labor deployment\r\n  Berlin W 8\r\n  Mohrenstrasse 65\r\n\r\n  Dear party member Sauckel:\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your report on the execution of the great\r\ntask given to you, and I am glad to hear that in carrying out your\r\nmission you have always found the necessary support, even on the part\r\nof the civilian authorities in the occupied Eastern territories. For\r\nmyself and the officials under my command this collaboration was and\r\nis self-evident, especially since both you and I have, with regard to\r\nthe solution of the labor problem in the East, represented the same\r\nviewpoints from the beginning. For political as well as efficiency\r\nreasons, you have devoted your attention, above all, to the care of\r\nthe Eastern workers, employed in the Reich, and in the same sense\r\nI also have striven toward an overall satisfactory solution, by\r\nthe establishment of special posts, collaborating with the welfare\r\norganizations [Betreuungsorganisationen].\r\n\r\nIf there is now complete agreement between your and my conception of\r\nthe matter, I nevertheless find it necessary on the grounds of several\r\noccurrences during the last months, to point out with reference to the\r\nenclosure, the methods applied by your agencies and collaborators.\r\nI thereby do not disregard the fact that considering the scope and\r\nurgency of the task to be accomplished, difficulties and hardships,\r\nyes even false measures by the executing branches, can in the long\r\nrun not be avoided. But it seems necessary to me, to follow up these\r\noccurrences insofar as they touch the conduct of war and the interests\r\nof the Reich. This would always be the case, where the acquisition of\r\nnew laborers is undertaken in a way which intimidates the population.\r\nThe reports I have received show, that the increase of the guerilla\r\nbands in the occupied Eastern regions is largely due to the fact that\r\nthe methods used for procuring laborers in these regions are felt to\r\nbe forced measures of mass-deportation, so that the endangered persons\r\nprefer to escape their fate by withdrawing into the woods or going\r\nover to the guerilla bands. Add to the occasionally unfavorable news\r\nregarding the treatment of the Eastern laborers in the Reich, about\r\nexperiences with the labor procurement authorities, then the result\r\ncan only be a strengthening of the number and fighting spirit of the\r\nhostile troops. This development is further aided by the return of tens\r\nof thousands of useless Eastern workers from the Reich (sick, cripples,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nTo this point I should like to add that my repeated plea to establish\r\nsick-camps in the regional labor office districts, instead of the\r\nmass deportation of the Easterners who are incapable of work, has\r\nso far not been answered. Hence I found it necessary to contact\r\nthe Reichskommissar [Commissioner] for health and sanitation on\r\nthis matter. In the session of the propaganda department called by\r\nState Counselor, Professor Boerger on the 17th of this month, the\r\nnegative repercussions which will be caused in the native provinces\r\nby the recently planned return transports were referred to not\r\nonly by the representatives of my agency, but particularly by the\r\nrepresentative of the economic staff East, since such events interfere\r\nwith the demands for labor and production in the rear military\r\nzones. Measures such as conscription, return of the sick or similar\r\nthings not only impair the procurement and the legal validity of\r\nthe executive orders of the compulsory-labor order released by me\r\non Dec 19.41, but moreover endanger all the important war work in\r\nthe occupied Eastern territories. This goes as well for the urban\r\nas for the rural procurement districts, where so far, thanks to the\r\nself-sacrificing activity of the leaders of the economic land bases, an\r\natmosphere permitting productive work was created between the German\r\nadministration and the native population, which now threatens to become\r\nlost. Even if I do not close my eyes to the necessity that the numbers\r\ndemanded by the Reichs minister for weapons and ammunition as well as\r\nby the agricultural economy justify unusual and hard measures, I have\r\nto ask, due to the responsibility for the occupied Eastern territories\r\nwhich lies upon me, that in the accomplishment of ordered tasks such\r\nmeasures be excluded, the toleration and prosecution of which will some\r\nday be held against me, and my collaborators. In order to achieve this,\r\nand to bring into agreement the requirements given by the peculiar\r\npolitical situation of the Eastern territories with the measures of\r\nthe commissions and the staffs of your agencies, I have empowered the\r\nReichs commissioner for the Ukraine insofar as necessary to make use\r\nof his right, and to see to it that methods which run contrary to the\r\ninterest of the conduct of the war and war economy in the occupied East\r\nbe abolished.\r\n\r\nIt appears strange to me, that in numerous cases which should\r\nhave been discussed with the civil authorities, we only receive\r\ninformation through the police and other agencies. I am referring\r\nin this connection to the note of my standing representative of\r\nNov. 11.42.--III wi 5--1231-3587--in which I asked for a discussion\r\nconcerning the mutual cooperation, and especially on the position of\r\nyour delegates, to which I have unfortunately never received an answer\r\nfrom you. With consultation of our mutual wishes, which you personally\r\nwill certainly understand, it is unfortunately impossible for me to\r\naccept a co-responsibility for the consequences, which result from the\r\nrecounted state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI should not like to have informed you of this, without expressing\r\nmy hope that in the interests of both of us, this condition will be\r\nterminated with the coming of the new year. I am personally convinced\r\nthat you, dear Party member Sauckel, have the same desire. I assume\r\nthat there will be an opportunity for discussion of this in the\r\nconference prompted by me on Jan. 11.43.\r\n\r\nI am gratefully looking forward to your reports in this connection.\r\n\r\n  Yours,\r\n  signed: A.

No. 7328/42 secret Group VIII)\r\n\r\n Selected letters from the occupied Eastern regions regarding the\r\n period from Sept. 11 to Nov. 10, 1942.\r\n\r\nIn the letters from the Ukraine a further sharp decline in the morale\r\nis pictured, and under the impact of an increased requisition of labor\r\nforces for the Reich, the Ukrainian population has been seized by a\r\nterrible fear.\r\n\r\nHorrifying picturizations of _compulsory measures_ by the\r\nadministrative authorities for the seizure of Eastern laborers, form\r\na major part of the news from home to their relatives working in\r\nGermany. The disinclination to answer the call to work in the Reich\r\nhas evidently grown steadily, not only due to the reports of Eastern\r\nworkers, which fled home and their workshops or have been dismissed.\r\nIn order to secure the required number for the labor transport, men\r\nand women including youngsters from 15 years on up, are allegedly\r\ntaken from the street, from the market places and village festivals,\r\nand carried off. The inhabitants therefore hide themselves in fear\r\nand avoid any appearance in public. After public beatings during the\r\nmonth of October, so available letters state, came the burning down of\r\nhomesteads, and of whole villages as retribution for failure to comply\r\nwith the demand for the appropriation of labor forces directed to the\r\ncommunities. The execution of the latter measures is being reported\r\nfrom various villages.\r\n\r\n\r\nParts from Two Letters\r\n\r\n\"At our place, new things have happened. People are being taken to\r\nGermany. On Dec. 5, some people from the Kowkuski district were\r\nscheduled to go, but they didn't want to and the village was set afire.\r\nThey threatened to do the same thing in Borowytschi, as not all who\r\nwere scheduled to depart wanted to go. Thereupon 3 truck-loads of\r\nGermans arrived and set fire to their houses. In Wrasnytschi 12 houses\r\nand in Borowytschi 3 houses were burned.\r\n\r\n\"On Oct. 1 a new conscription of labor forces took place. From what\r\nhas happened, I will describe the most important to you. You can not\r\nimagine the bestiality. You probably remember what we were told about\r\nthe Soviets during the rule of the Poles. At that time we did not\r\nbelieve it and now it seems just as incredible. The order came to\r\nsupply 25 workers, but no one reported. All had fled. Then the German\r\nmilitia came and began to ignite the houses of those who had fled. The\r\nfire became very violent, since it had not rained for 2 months. In\r\naddition the grain stacks were in the farm yards. You can imagine what\r\ntook place. The people who had hurried to the scene were forbidden to\r\nextinguish the flames, beaten and arrested, so that 7 homesteads burned\r\ndown. The policemen meanwhile ignited other houses. The people fall on\r\ntheir knees and kiss their hands, but the policemen beat them with\r\nrubber trunchions and threaten to burn down the whole village. I don't\r\nknow how this would have ended if I Sapurkany had not intervened. He\r\npromised that there would be laborers by morning. During the fire the\r\nmilitia went through the adjoining villages, seized the laborers, and\r\nplaced them under arrest. Wherever they did not find any laborers, they\r\ndetained the parents, until the children appeared. That is how they\r\nraged throughout the night in Bielosirka. The workers which had not yet\r\nappeared till then, were to be shot. All schools were closed and the\r\nmarried teachers were sent to work here, while the unmarried ones go\r\nto work in Germany. They are now catching humans like the dog-catchers\r\nused to catch dogs. They are already hunting for one week and have not\r\nyet enough. The imprisoned workers are locked in at the schoolhouse.\r\nThey cannot even go out to perform their natural functions, but have to\r\ndo it like pigs in the same room. People from many villages went on a\r\ncertain day to a pilgrimage to the monastery Potschaew. They were all\r\narrested, locked in, and will be sent to work. Among them there are\r\nlame, blind and aged people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 019-PS\r\n\r\n  The Commissioner for the Four Year Plan\r\n  The Deputy General for Labor Supply\r\n  No. IVa 5780.28/1138\r\n\r\n  Berlin, SW 11, 17 March 1943\r\n  Saarlandstr. 96 (Reich's Ministry for Labor)\r\n  Tel. of the RAM: 11 00 28\r\n\r\nPostal Checking Account of the RAM, Branch: Berlin 100.19\r\n\r\nCopies:\r\n\r\n  1.

He himself has been charged by me with the absolute and\r\ncompletely unreserved cooperation with all bureaus of the Eastern\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nEspecially the labor supply for the German agriculture, and likewise\r\nfor the most urgent armament production programs ordered by the Fuehrer\r\nmake the fastest importation of approximately 1 million women and men\r\nfrom the Eastern Territories within the next 4 months a must. Starting\r\n15 March the daily shipment must have reached 5000 female and male\r\nworkers respectively, while beginning of April this number has to be\r\nstepped up to 10,000.

S, for the\r\ndiscussion of the pending importation of domestic workers from the East\r\nfrom the Ukraine into the Reich. To this Gauleiter Sauckel declared the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nIt is the definite wish of the Fuehrer that the law over the duty\r\nyear [Pflichtjahr] for women be not over extended, that all German\r\ngirls must work one additional year in housekeeping. This position of\r\nthe Fuehrer is motivated by the positive experiences which have been\r\nmade so far with the women's Reich's labor service; this service has\r\nproved itself to be an instrument of political breeding through which\r\nthe German girls are made politically more reliable than through one\r\nadditional year of private housekeeping. Therefore, and this is also\r\nthe opinion of the Reichsmarshall and of Reichsleiter Bormann, the\r\nhousekeeping problem must be solved through a different way than the\r\nabove-mentioned one.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Fuehrer has ordered the immediate importation of\r\n400,000 to 500,000 female domestic Eastern workers from the Ukraine\r\nbetween the ages of 15 and 35, and has charged the General Deputy for\r\nlabor mobilization with the execution of this action which is to end\r\nin about 3 months. In connection with this--this is also approved by\r\nReichsleiter Bormann, the illegal bringing of female housekeepers into\r\nthe Reich by members of the Armed Forces, or various other agencies,\r\nis to be allowed subsequently, and furthermore, irrespective of the\r\nofficial recruiting, is not to be prevented. The determining factor\r\nfor the recruiting of Ukrainian female domestic workers is this:\r\naccording to the specific wish of the Fuehrer only such girls are to\r\nbe recruited against whose permanent stay in Germany, to be determined\r\nby their conduct and their physical appearance, there will be no\r\nscruples; it is in accordance with a specific desire of the Fuehrer\r\nthat the greatest number of these girls be germanized through the\r\nrecruitment. To this, the Fuehrer declared that we have to review\r\nour school knowledge about people migrations, to the extent that the\r\nLebensraum of the Germanic peoples is not only to be considered from\r\na point of view of the newly gained territories at that time, but\r\nalso from the point of view of the region of origin of those peoples.\r\nThe Germans have spread \"like beer\". Only the young people have left\r\nwhereas the old ones remained at home. This is the reason why there\r\nare, especially in the Ukraine and in the northerly part of the Black\r\nSea, such a great number of blond haired and blue eyed people who have\r\nneither Tartar nor Caucasian appearances. This can only be the case of\r\npeasants, descendants of settled Germanic tribes; to re-germanize them\r\ncan only be a question of time. It is the Fuehrer's desire that in 100\r\nyears from now 250 million German speaking people will live in Europe.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the recruitment of Ukrainian domestic workers is not\r\nonly under a labor mobilization consideration but also a racial one,\r\nit ensues forcibly that a special treatment of this labor mobilization\r\nmeasure is necessary, which does not exclude the fact that the domestic\r\nUkrainian workers are to be considered in the first place as workers\r\nfrom the East and are to be provided with the sign \"OST\". They are\r\nto be employed in city households as well as in country households,\r\npreferably in families with many children and essential constructive\r\nfamilies (Aufbau Familien) so that 200,000 of them will be furnished\r\nto city households and 200,000 to country households. In order to\r\nprevent a better position of the Eastern domestic workers employed in\r\ncountry households as compared to the ones employed in cities, the\r\ndomestic workers from the Ukraine are to receive basically the same\r\nfood as the German civilian population. Because these regulations\r\nnecessitate a revision of the feeding precepts of Prisoners of War and\r\nsoviet civilian laborers as stated in a communication of the Reich's\r\nnutrition ministry of April 4, 1942, the Reich's minister for nutrition\r\nand agriculture has asked the General Deputy for labor mobilization\r\nto refrain from the execution of the measures at least until the food\r\nsituation of the German people permits the importation of more foreign\r\nlabor forces and a better food situation for the workers from the East\r\ncan be assured. Gauleiter Sauckel spoke in harshest terms against the\r\nstand of the Reich's minister for nutrition stating that he refuses to\r\ndiscuss an order of the Fuehrer. He added furthermore that irrespective\r\nof the importation of domestic workers, the mobilization of one more\r\nmillion workers from the East is being planned, this being the only\r\nway to realize in the years to come the Fuehrer's Armament and Steel\r\nproduction program for the execution of the great plans in the West\r\nand for the annihilation of the greatest war economy of the world, the\r\nNorth American one. For the feeding of this million men labor force\r\nwhich number furthermore is equilibrated by the fact that approximately\r\n7 million German soldiers are in greater part supplied with food\r\nfrom the foreign countries, party member Backe has only to solve the\r\norganizational problem in order to take advantage of the first rate\r\nharvest throughout Europe. Never before did a minister for nutrition\r\nstart his function under such favorable conditions as State Secretary\r\nBacke. The reference to the difficult transportation conditions to\r\nbring the foreign harvests into the Reich does not impress Gauleiter\r\nSauckel in the least; he would find ways and means to utilize the\r\nharvest and the cattle from the Ukraine even if he has to draft the\r\nwhole Jewry of Europe to use them as a human road for the handling\r\nof boxes to the Ukraine. \"If the food rations both for the Germans\r\nand the foreign workers are not increased shortly, then a scandal of\r\nthe greatest proportion will take place\". The decreased resistance of\r\nthe bodies--especially with the shortage of doctors--will give rise\r\nto great epidemics (see Diphtheria Epidemy). It is to be requested\r\nfrom Party member Backe that the proposed increase of bread and meat\r\nration be not done with the start of the winter time only but at the\r\nend of the present allotment period, so that the weakened bodies can\r\nbuild up a reserve of strength which will get them well through the\r\nwinter. The Fuehrer cannot understand the fact that it has to be in\r\nthe country which carries the greatest weight in the fight for the\r\nfuture of Europe that most people go hungry while this is not the\r\ncase with France, Holland, Hungary, and the Ukraine and everywhere\r\nelse; he desires that this be the contrary in the future. As far as\r\nthe foreign workers in Germany are concerned (with the exception of\r\nthe workers from the East) a slow reduction of food according to\r\nrenderment has to be applied to them; it cannot be tolerated that lazy\r\nDutchmen or Italians receive better food than a diligent worker from\r\nthe East. As far as the nutrition is concerned, here too the principle\r\nof renderment has to be applied. Since the new nutrition regulation is\r\nseen as being feasible by Gauleiter Sauckel in the above mentioned\r\nway of thinking, therefore, the special action of the General Deputy\r\nfor labor mobilization (GBA) for the importation of domestic workers\r\nfrom the East must be coupled with the current recruiting commission\r\nin the Ukraine. The delegation from October to April of 200,000 to\r\n300,000 male and female workers from the East already employed in the\r\nGerman agriculture to industry factories is not affected by this; these\r\nforces (incl. the female ones) will be returned in the spring to their\r\noriginal peasant organizations, and there just as before, they will\r\nnot be employed at home but for agricultural work. A lawful ground for\r\nspecial domestic action, a decree is being prepared, the text of which\r\nwas read at the conference by Councellor in the Ministry Dr. Letsch.\r\nThe recruiting which in the case of the female domestic workers will be\r\nbased especially on voluntariness will be executed in connection with\r\nthe office of the Reichsfuehrer SS and the Chief of the German police\r\nwho intend to step in for the pre-examination with regard to a possible\r\nworthiness of becoming a German. Those female workers from the East\r\nfound to be apt for housekeeping will be marked in a special way by the\r\nlabor and social officers so that they can be recognized as such on\r\nthe transport lists of the collective shipments. Independent of these,\r\nspecial shipments of domestic female workers are to be considered\r\nsince Gauleiter Sauckel plans on having brought into the Reich 6,000\r\npersons a day. With reference to the treatment of the female domestic\r\nworkers from the East in the Reich, this question has been talked\r\nover with the Reichsfuehrer SS and the Chief of the German Police,\r\nthe Reichswomen office, the Party Chancellory, the General Deputy for\r\nlabor mobilization, the result being a plan for a notice for the German\r\nhousewomen. The wages of the female domestic workers are to be paid\r\naccording to a remuneration table for workers from the East; however,\r\nthis has to be deviated through the fixation of special tariffs by the\r\nlabor trustees. In reference to the Eastern worker's tax for management\r\ndirectors, it was decided to ask the Reich's finance minister to higher\r\nthe Eastern worker's tax by half for the families of up to three\r\nchildren and to cut it out completely for families of 4 children and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the conference, the Councellor to the Ministry Letsch--as\r\nhe had done previously with new notices--tried to get the proposed\r\nnotice for the German housewomen ratified by those who took part;\r\nhowever, the undersigned protested against that by demanding a copy to\r\ndetermine his position. The representatives of the party chancellery,\r\nthe nutrition ministry and other offices joined in this demand so that\r\nGauleiter Sauckel promised to make available the draft of the text for\r\nSeptember 4, 1942 with the request that final positions be taken by\r\n1400 o'clock.\r\n\r\nGenerally one gathered from this conference that the questions\r\nconcerning the recruitment and mobilization as well as the treatment\r\nof the female domestic workers from the East are being handled by\r\nthe General Deputy for labor mobilization, the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nthe Chief of the German police and the party chancellory and that\r\nthe Reich's ministry for the occupied territories of the East is not\r\nconsidered as competent or only as half competent. In reference to this\r\nthe undersigned established specifically that the Reich's ministry for\r\nthe occupied territories for the East has not until now participated in\r\nthe drafting of the notice. He declared furthermore that the Reich's\r\nministry for the occupied territories of the East is greatly interested\r\nin the Propaganda for the mobilization of domestic workers, and that it\r\nbe carried out in a favored way considering the necessity to have only\r\nvolunteer forces at the disposition for housekeeping.\r\n\r\nGauleiter Sauckel took knowledge of this with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  (signed) Gutkelch\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 031-PS\r\n\r\n  Chief of the Political Directing Staff, personal referee\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 12 June 1944\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Copy No. 1 of 2 copies\r\n\r\n Re: Evacuation of youths from the territory of Army Group \"Center\"\r\n (Heu-Aktion).\r\n\r\n1. Memorandum:\r\n\r\nThe Army Group \"Center\" has the intention to apprehend 40-50,000\r\nyouths at the ages of 10 to 14 who are in the Army Territories, and\r\nto transport them to the Reich. This measure was originally proposed\r\nby the 9th Army. These youths cause considerable inconvenience in the\r\nTheatre of Operations. To the greater part these youths are without\r\nsupervision of their parents since men and women in the theatres of\r\noperations have been and will be conscripted into labor battalions to\r\nbe used in the construction of fortifications. Therefore Children's\r\nVillages are to be established behind the front, for the younger age\r\ngroups, and under native supervision. To collect adequate experiences\r\nthe 9th Army has already established such a Children's Village and has\r\nachieved good results also from the political viewpoint. Army Group\r\nfurther emphasizes that these youths must not be allowed to fall into\r\nthe hands of the Bolsheviks in case of a withdrawal since that would\r\namount to reinforcing the enemy's potential war strength. This measure\r\nis to be strongly fortified by propaganda under the slogan: Care of the\r\nReich for White-Ruthenian Children, Protection against Brigandry. The\r\naction has already started in the 5 kilometer zone. The Youth Bureau\r\nhas already had preliminary talks with the Organization Todt and with\r\nthe Junkers works. It is intended to allot these juveniles primarily to\r\nthe German trades as apprentices to be used as skilled workers after 2\r\nyears' training. This is to be arranged through the Organization Todt\r\nwhich is especially equipped for such a task through its technical and\r\nother set-ups. This action is being greatly welcomed by the German\r\ntrade since it represents a decisive measure for the alleviation of the\r\nshortage of apprentices.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Political Directing Staff, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer\r\nBerger, submitted the action to the Minister on the 10th of the month.\r\nThe Minister feared that the action would have most unfavorable\r\npolitical consequences, that it would be regarded as abduction of\r\nchildren, and that the juveniles did not represent a real asset to the\r\nenemy's military strength anyhow. The Minister would like to see the\r\naction confined to the 15-17 year olds.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the arguments against this decision of the Minister:\r\n\r\n1. This action is not only aimed at preventing a direct reinforcement\r\nof the enemy's military strength but also at a reduction of his\r\nbiological potentialities as viewed from the perspective of the future.\r\nThese ideas have been voiced not only by the Reichsfuehrer of the SS\r\nbut also by the Fuehrer. Corresponding orders were given during last\r\nyear's withdrawals in the southern sector.\r\n\r\n2. A similar action is being conducted at the present time in the\r\nterritory of the Army Group Ukraine-North (General Field Marshal\r\nModel). Even in this politically especially preferred Galizian\r\nterritory recruiting measures were being taken with the aim to collect\r\n135,000 laborers to be organized in battalions for the construction\r\nof fortifications. The youths over 17 were to be detailed to the SS\r\nDivision and those under 17 to the SS Auxiliary. This action which\r\nhas been going on for several weeks has not led to any political\r\ndisturbances. While it is true that the population has to be recruited\r\nby force, they do show a certain understanding, later on, for this\r\nmeasure of purely military necessity. Provided, of course, that they\r\nreceive correct treatment, good food and lodgings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe unified organization of parents in labor battalions makes it\r\npossible to extract this group as a whole in the case of withdrawals\r\nwhich are quite conceivable in the case of Army Groups \"Center\" and\r\nSouth. The children already transported into the Reich would serve as a\r\nsuitable incentive.\r\n\r\n3. As to Army Group \"Center\" this measure is to be initiated in Army\r\nTerritories, that is to say in those territories not under a civil\r\nadministration. During a conference with the Chief of Staff of the\r\n9th Army I gained the impression that the action will be executed,\r\nif necessary, even without the consent of the Reich Ministry for the\r\nOccupied Territories of the East.\r\n\r\n4. If the Ministry for the East should not support or execute this\r\naction, it is expected that the procurement will be undertaken by the\r\nGBA [Generalbevollmaschtiger fuer den Arbeitseinsatz--General Deputy\r\nfor the Mobilization of Labor]. Army Group \"Center\" and especially 9th\r\nArmy thought it of greatest importance not to let the children be put\r\nto work in the Reich through the General Deputy for the Mobilization\r\nof Labor. They preferred the offices of the Reichs-minister for the\r\nOccupied Territories of the East [RMfdbO]. Only through these offices\r\ndid they believe to have a guarantee for correct and proper treatment.\r\nThis desire of the Army Group is a particular expression of confidence\r\ntowards the Ministry for the East. Army Group desires that the action\r\nbe accomplished under the most loyal conditions, as had been done\r\npreviously in the case of recruiting for the SS Auxiliary. They further\r\ndesired special arrangements regarding care mail exchange with parents\r\netc. As far as possible the children are to remain in groups according\r\nto their village communities, then be collected in small camps in the\r\nReich where they would be at the disposal of trade establishments.\r\nThese technical matters have already been discussed. They can be\r\naccomplished with the help of the offices of the Hitler Youth through\r\nthe Youth Bureau of the Ministry. Thus the Ministry is also able to\r\nexercise political guidance over the juveniles and has them at its\r\ndisposal at all times. If I should re-occupy the territory the Ministry\r\nof the East could return the juveniles in the proper manner. Together\r\nwith their parents they would then most likely represent a positive\r\npolitical element during the reconstruction of the territory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n The Chief of the Political Directing Staw, personal referee, p 612\r\n a/44g\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 14 June 1944\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n Re: \"Heu-Aktion\"\r\n\r\n1.

The whole civil population in this area, including non-military\r\nofficials, had to abandon this zone as of 2100, 26 Sep 1943. The office\r\nof the Special Purposes Staff [Einsatzstabes] on Rowno Street #8 lies\r\nin the prohibited zone. The apartment house on Theaterstrasse #9 was\r\nevacuated and troops quartered within.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the materials on hand encountered extraordinary\r\ndifficulties due to lack of loading space. However the transporting of\r\nthe following was carried out:\r\n\r\n 24 Sep 43: _Materials of the Museum of Art at Charkow._\r\n\r\n Taken over by party member Pfeiffer from General Commissioner,\r\n Shitomir for shipping by trucks to Reichs Commissioner Ukraine [RKU]\r\n in Rowno.\r\n\r\n  96 Ukrainian paintings.\r\n  185 Western European paintings.\r\n  12 wood carvings and etchings.\r\n  25 carpets and tapestries.\r\n\r\n The inventory and files of those objects are in the hand of the staff\r\n leaders. The Reich Commissioner kept a copy of the inventory.\r\n\r\n26 Sep 43: _Materials of HAG_ [_Hauptarbeitsgruppe--Main Division_]\r\n\r\n The document-house library, utensils, office supplies and the\r\n administration were loaded in a freight car by 13 native workers for\r\n Truskawiec under the supervision of Special Purpose Staff Director\r\n FUCHS.\r\n\r\n27 Sep 43: _Materials of the Department of Seizure_ [_Abteilung\r\nErfassung_]\r\n\r\nThis shipment went to Ratibor and contained\r\n\r\n  42 cases--10,186 books\r\n  7 cases--total catalog of the East Library\r\n  21 cases--selected publications\r\n  12 cases--art folios\r\n  11 packages of samples of magazines\r\n  9 crates and }\r\n  7 rolls      }  Bolshevist pictures\r\n  22 crates Bolshevist films\r\n\r\n Several cases of negatives and positives from the photoarchive,\r\n dispositives and slides, materials of Special Purpose Commandant Dr.\r\n Huettig of the Special Purpose Staff \"Science\" 1 case of Bolshevist\r\n data in German and others.\r\n\r\n1 Oct. 43: _Materials of the Ukrainian Museum in Kiev._\r\n\r\n On the basis of the General evacuation orders of the city commissioner\r\n the following were sorted out by us and loaded for shipment to Krakow.\r\n\r\n  Textiles of all sorts\r\n  Collections of valuable embroidery patterns\r\n  Collections of brocades\r\n  Numerous items of wood, etc.\r\n\r\nMoreover an essential part of the prehistoric museum was transported\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSince already on the 20 Sep the head of the provincial administration\r\nof libraries, museums and archives, Dr. Winters, had requested his\r\nassignment to the Special Purposes Staff. Because of the evacuation of\r\nthe civil administration, he left the city on 25 Sep on the basis of\r\nthe general evacuation order. Dr. Winter turned over to the leader of\r\nthe main division (HAG) a list of the articles under his protection in\r\ncase the Special Purpose Staff remained longer in Kiev and would also\r\ntake charge of these materials. Dr. Winter could only send 2 freight\r\ncars of material into the interior. Shortly before his departure Dr.\r\nWinter had turned over by a transfer document to the city commissioner\r\nthe administration of the materials entrusted to him. The latter had\r\ncharged Prof. Dr. Mansfeld with as complete an evacuation of these\r\narticles as possible. Since Prof. Dr. Mansfeld knew little about the\r\narticles, he requested support from the Special Purpose Staff of\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg. On 1 Oct. it was possible to load 2 freight\r\ncars with museum goods, but under great difficulty. Since labor was\r\nunobtainable all the members still in Kiev on the Special Purpose Staff\r\nof Reichsleiter Rosenberg undertook the loading themselves.\r\n\r\nThe activity in Kiev became more difficult since the German artillery\r\nstands in the center of the city and from there fires its salvoes\r\ntoward the East bank.\r\n\r\nThrough the military measures the salvage work was carried out, under\r\never-increasing difficulties. At the request of Prof. Dr. Mansfeld 2-3\r\ncollaborators were assigned to him for the evacuation of the articles\r\nand institutes which up to now had been under the civil administration.\r\n\r\nSince the remaining in Kiev of all members of the Chief Labor Group\r\nUkraine was impossible the leader of the Chief Labor Group HAG had come\r\nto an agreement by the 2 Oct. with G-2 (Ic) on the following points\r\nconcerning the division in that area.\r\n\r\n1. The Special Purposes Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg's Chief Labor\r\nGroup Ukraine will leave behind a detachment of 5 men for security and\r\nsafety of the cultural articles in the off-limits zone of the city of\r\nKiev.\r\n\r\n2. The remaining detachment will at the request of the infantry\r\ndivision (ID) and at the command of the 7th Army Corps (7 AK) work in\r\nclose cooperation with the G-2 (Ic) of the infantry division (ID).\r\n\r\n3. The infantry division (ID) is prepared to take care of the\r\ndetachment and provide each member with corresponding identification\r\npapers and thereby guarantee the utmost protection possible in the\r\nprohibited zone.\r\n\r\n4. At the request of G-2 (Ic) of the Infantry Division (ID) the\r\nparticular detachments were to take over tasks which lay in the\r\ncompetence of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n5. The Infantry Division (ID) places great value on further\r\nevacuation of precious articles, since this battle zone can in no\r\ncase be protected sufficiently by the army. One may even count on\r\nartillery shells falling at any time. Army installations, means of\r\ntransportation, etc., should be provided by the Infantry Division, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nOf course it was the duty of the Chief Labor Group Ukraine (HAG) to\r\nhold out in Kiev as long as possible, until it was rendered impossible\r\nby the military situation.\r\n\r\nAll members of the Chief Labor Group [HAG] have worked in harmony and\r\nwith strong interest to insure the safety and evacuation of the most\r\nprecious cultural goods. At the loading they lent a hand in order to\r\ncomplete the loading work in the few hours remaining.\r\n\r\nThe remaining of the Chief Labor Group [HAG] and its work has greatly\r\nimpressed G-2 and the Division. The intention that the remaining\r\ndetachment would leave Kiev at the last possible moment met with strong\r\napproval. This last movement was defined by the Army as the one on\r\nwhich the remaining detachment would be \"bombed out of office.\"\r\n\r\nOn 5 Oct 1943 the leader of the Chief Labor Group departed from Kiev\r\nwith his staff except those selected for the remaining detachment in\r\norder to continue leading the work of the Chief Labor Group of Ukraine\r\n[HAG] from Truskavice.\r\n\r\n  Signed: UTIKAL\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The Staff Directorate\r\n  [Stabsfuehrung]\r\n  Referee East\r\n\r\n  Berlin 21 Oct. 1943\r\n  II b/Dr. Z./Z/\r\n\r\n  [handwritten notation]\r\n\r\nMiss Girschberg for final copy to Reich Directorate, Staff Director,\r\nSubordinate Leaders, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum for the Reichs Leader\r\n\r\n _Subject: Evacuation of the Office at Kiev._\r\n\r\nAs you all know the Chief Labor Office Group Ukraine (HAG) of the\r\nSpecial Purposes Staff had to, for the time being shift its offices\r\n[Dienstsitz] to Truskaviec near Drobobycz 90 km South of Lomberg.\r\nThis shifting was accomplished without any friction. A remaining\r\ndetachment was left behind in the prohibited zone in Kiev. This\r\nremaining detachment still protects the cultural goods which lie in\r\nthe battle zone insofar as their salvage has not been carried out.\r\nNumerous cultural goods were saved in the last hour by the Special\r\nPurposes Staff before the destruction through enemy action, aided by\r\nthe strenuous work of the staff members as a whole. The following items\r\nwere shipped:\r\n\r\n1. _24 Sept. 43: Materials from the Charkow Art Museum._\r\n\r\nTaken over by party member (Pg.)

Prof. Dr. Stampfuss with\r\nthe help of several collaborators gathered another collection of\r\nprehistoric articles and also shipped it to Krakau.\r\n\r\nWhen the civil administration left Kiev the head of the provincial\r\nadministration for archives, libraries, and museums, Dr. Winter and\r\nhis helper Dr. Benzing, again joined the Special Purposes Staff on 20\r\nSep. However these two gentlemen also left Kiev on 25 Sep. The Special\r\nPurpose Staff did then undertake again its original task of protecting\r\nthe cultural articles and goods. Though the personnel has been\r\ndecreased materially in the course of the development of the situation,\r\nit was then arranged that right up to the last minute one group of\r\nworkers capable of action remained in Kiev for the carrying out of the\r\nfinal tasks. The Special Purpose Staff is the last German office which\r\nremains in the dead zone of Kiev. Its remaining and its assistance\r\nto the G-2 (Ic) of the combat division involved has made a strong\r\nimpression on the army. We were permitted to remain in the fighting\r\nzone up until the point when we would be bombed out of the office.\r\n\r\nThis successful work was in the main due to the devotion to duty and\r\nto personal inspiration of the Chief of the Special Purposes Staff\r\nAnton, but also due to the unselfish performance of duty of his other\r\nco-workers.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. ZEISS\r\n  Chief of the Special Purposes Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 041-PS\r\n\r\n  Memorandum for the Fuehrer\r\n\r\nBy a decision of the Fuehrer the Reichsminister for the occupied\r\nEastern territories has received the authority to put to use for the\r\nsupport of government arrangements in the Eastern territories the\r\navailable household goods of refugees, absent or deported Jews in the\r\noccupied Western areas. This is the so-called Action \"M\". For the\r\nexecution of Action \"M\" the service office West [Dienststelle Westen]\r\nhas been set up in Paris with directive authority in France, Belgium\r\nand the Netherlands. Up to the present time about 40,000 tons of\r\nhousehold goods have been loaded on free transportation space (ship and\r\nrailway) bound for the Reich.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the fact that the requirements of bomb damaged\r\npersons in the Reich must take precedence over the demands of the East,\r\nthe Reich Ministry has placed a major portion (over 19,500 tons) of\r\nthe household goods at the disposal of the bomb damaged persons in the\r\nReich. The goods have then been transported by the appropriate service\r\noffice west in the occupied territory. Likewise, the Reich Ministry\r\nwill place at the disposition of bomb damaged persons the greatest\r\nportion, at least 80%, of the goods accruing from Action \"N\" [sic].\r\nFor its own purposes only these goods which are urgently needed in the\r\nEast will be reserved.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Action \"M\" has resulted in two categories of\r\ndifficulties up to the present time:\r\n\r\n_a._ Transportation Question. The goods have been transported up to\r\nthis point as Armed Forces goods by means of railway cars and ships.\r\nThe transportation authorities [Kommandanturen] now wish to treat\r\nthe transport requirements of Action \"M\" as the transport of the\r\ncivilian sector. This would lead to unbearable delays and among other\r\ndifficulties would require the export-approval of the French State.\r\nBecause of this the following decree is required: Goods which the Reich\r\nMinister for the East-Service Office West [Dienststelle Westen] Paris\r\nor their directive authorities in France, Belgium and the Netherlands,\r\ndeclare as goods accruing from Action \"M\", are to be transported as\r\nArmed Forces goods.\r\n\r\n_b._ Distribution of furniture among bombed-out persons. The giving up\r\nof the furniture to bomb-damaged persons is being delayed in order that\r\nit may be submitted upon import into the Reich territory to handling\r\nby the customs. After time-losing determination of the value, the\r\nfurniture in many cases is auctioned to the bomb-damaged persons by\r\nChief Financial Commissioners [Oberfinanzpraesidenten]; to avoid these\r\nred-tape procedures the following decree is proposed:\r\n\r\n1. Goods accruing from Action \"M\" are exempt from all customs handling.\r\nFor such goods there are no obligations or duties to pay.\r\n\r\n2. Bomb damaged districts announce their needs in household furnishing\r\nunder the auspices of the competent Reich defense commissar to Reich\r\nMinistry for Occupied Eastern Territories--Central Section. The Reich\r\nMinistry instigates the immediate removal of the objects placed at\r\nits disposal by its service office West [Dienststelle Westen] and in\r\naccordance with the indication of the Reich defense commissar ships\r\ndirectly to the competent regional directorates [Gauleitungen]. These\r\ngive the furniture to the persons suffering the bomb damage on a\r\nloan basis. The determination of the value of the furniture and the\r\ndefinitive acquisition by the person suffering the bomb damage remains\r\nin abeyance till a later accounting. Up to the time of reckoning the\r\ngoods are Reich property, and are subject to the evaluation right of\r\nthe Reich Minister for the occupied Eastern territory.\r\n\r\nBy these proposals a type of management would be achieved whereby\r\npersons who have suffered bomb damage would have furniture and\r\nhousehold goods at their disposal in the shortest possible time. And\r\nthereby also a portion of their most immediate difficulties would be\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 3 October 1942\r\n\r\n  Signed: A ROSENBERG\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 047-PS\r\n\r\n  HOTEL KAISERHOF\r\n  Berlin W 8\r\n\r\n  Berlin 24 August 1931\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. Rosenberg:\r\n\r\nI am just reading in the Voelkischer Beobachter, edition 235/236, page\r\n1, an article entitled \"Does Wirth intend to come over?\". The tendency\r\nof the article is to prevent on our part a crumbling away from the\r\npresent form of government. I myself am travelling all over Germany to\r\nachieve exactly the opposite. May I therefore ask that my own paper\r\nwill not stab me in the back with tactically unwise articles.\r\n\r\nPersons, who are known to seek connection or are even prepared to\r\nbreak from the present constellation, _are to be spared under all\r\ncircumstances_. Our fight is to be directed in the first line against\r\nthe stubborn defenders of the present course and against persons who\r\nreject us.\r\n\r\nI ask therefore the Voelkischer Beobachter as well as the Party Press\r\nOffice to pay punctilious attention to this in the interest of our work.\r\n\r\n  With German greetings,\r\n  signed: ADOLF HITLER\r\n\r\n An identical information went to Mr. Dr. Dietrich, Party Press Office\r\n\r\n  signed: WILHELM BRUECKNER, Adj.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 053-PS\r\n\r\n The Deputy of the Reichs Ministry [Reichsministerium] for the Occupied\r\n Eastern Provinces with the Army Group South.--Captain Dr. Koch\r\n\r\n  REPORT 10\r\n  (Concluded on 5th October 1941)\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  (See also the morale report which will be ready in a short time\r\n  \"Legacy of the Soviets in the Ukrainian Areas\"--concluded at\r\n  the end of September 1941)\r\n\r\nA. _The Ukraine on the Right of the Dnieper_ can, for all purposes, be\r\nconsidered as inactive.\r\n\r\n_a._ The German Wehrmacht was regarded by the populace now, as ever,\r\nas emancipator and liberator from physical and mental pressure; the\r\npolitical points of view at present are not as important as the\r\nphysical.\r\n\r\nA temporary administration was almost put in everywhere by the troops,\r\nespecially by officers of Defense II, who were reserved for this, and\r\nwill be enlarged upon by the field commanders under the direction\r\nof Section VII (military) with the commander-in-chief of the rear\r\ncommunication zone; the proportional far-reaching net of the field\r\nand Army post command will be support and condensed through the\r\norganization of the office of the inspector of economy (especially the\r\nchief group of agriculture) which is of the same opinion. Occasional\r\nor regular conferences lead to unification of the points of view. Upon\r\nmy trip through the land (so far about 6000 km), I have tried through\r\npersonal contacts, to work for clearness and unification as much as\r\npossible; through speeches, conferences, participation in informal\r\ndiscussions, etc., I have reached, so far, some 600 native village\r\nburgermeisters, 12 larger city governments with their burgermeisters,\r\nabout 500 professors or students, 30 ministers with their church\r\ncouncils and 20 leaders of rayons or their assistants. I was asked by 4\r\ncommanders-in-chief, several garrison leaders [Standortaelteste], and a\r\nfew division commanders of various German garrisons, to lecture. I was\r\nheard by almost all Ic officers of the armies and other higher command\r\nposts, also some 100 agriculture leaders, 30 communications officers\r\nand 3 propaganda companies. The present Defense II officers gladly\r\nprocured such connections for me and guaranteed continued execution of\r\nprobable decisions.\r\n\r\n_b._ Where friction arises between German-(Retinue) sections and the\r\nnative populations, they are not of political, but economical or\r\npersonal nature.\r\n\r\nEconomy. The populace is aware and understands that a very large\r\npart of their total harvest has to be given to the Wehrmacht (and\r\neconomical command); but they resist against \"unjust\" and \"individual\"\r\nrequisitions, that means against continued confiscation in the villages\r\nalong the same large routes of march, without uniformly requisitioning\r\nin the country; and also against unrationalized or wild demands (the\r\nconfiscation of pregnant cows, requisition without proper receipts,\r\ndisregarding of letters of safe conduct issued by higher German\r\nechelons, etc.).\r\n\r\nIndividual German economical commands made complaints, and rightly so,\r\nover delayed terms and quantities; in most cases it was found that\r\ntechnical hindrances were the reasons (delayed or curtailed orders,\r\nlack of transportation) and not malice or sabotage. The farmers reply\r\nto the oft heard remarks of their laziness and lack of working effort,\r\nwas that they brought in the large harvest on their own free will\r\nwithout having many machines, manpower and the time.\r\n\r\nPersonal. The Bolshevists, using brutal measures (such as prison,\r\ndeportation, etc.) in general nevertheless refrained from punishing\r\nindividuals (by whipping). Now that it occasionally is done by German\r\ntroops, well meaning people blame it on the misunderstanding or\r\nignorance of the language; but should it be done too often, antipathy\r\nand distrust will be created.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the population emphasizes the difference which exists\r\nbetween the occasional mistakes of the Germans and the systematic\r\noppressions by our allies. Here especially the Rumanians and Hungarians\r\ncaused much gossip. The German Army Command, which operated for the\r\nsafeguarding of German property in the newly acquired Rumanian special\r\n(partly drastic) countermeasures. [sic]\r\n\r\n_c._ A complete report on these so-called Partisan-movements was made\r\non 14 Sept 1941.\r\n\r\nThe Army High Command decided, therefore, in favor of centralizing the\r\nwork on the problem, and requested Captain Lazarek for this, who until\r\nnow was assigned to me (Koch).\r\n\r\nExamples from Czernigow, Poltawa and other Army groups (for example,\r\nStaraja Russa near Orscha) prove that the enemy in the future will\r\nemploy partisans using explosives and mines.\r\n\r\n_d._ The inner political interest of the population is limited at\r\npresent to questions of administration and meritorious service in\r\noffices or semi-military associations.\r\n\r\nOf all the old, strong political parties in Kiev, only a subordinate\r\n(\"Kultur\") section of the \"Sojus Wyzwolennia Ukrainy\" (organisation\r\nfor the liberation of the Ukraine) could be found; other trails led to\r\nShitomir, Uman, and Lemberg, but were lost there in some remnants of\r\nlocal organizations.\r\n\r\nUp till now, the Bandera people could not fulfill their original\r\nplan, the establishment of a self-supporting government in Kiev,\r\nsince the \"Command Kiew\" which was to perform this, was removed by\r\nthe security service [SD] in Fastow and Wassilkow; in the first days\r\nafter the occupation of the city, they pasted small propaganda placards\r\nright next to the German governmental publications, however without\r\nmuch result. Also handbills, in which it was tried to justify the\r\nattentat of Shitomir, remain ineffective. The burning of Kiev and the\r\nstrict screening of the population following thereafter [Sichtungen]\r\nhave caused, it seems, a (passing) standstill in the organizational\r\nconstruction of the Bandera group.\r\n\r\nFrom the Melnyk organization it was possible to obtain a secret\r\ndirective called \"in Matters of Propaganda\"; aside from the old and\r\nwell-known requests (self-rule demands of totalitarianism, national\r\nsocialistic philosophy of life) the following is noticeable in regards\r\nto the Reich's relative points (Par. 18): \"The special aim is to\r\nobtain a clarification of the relations to the German factors. It is\r\nto be pointed out that Germany is at war with Moscow and therefore\r\nis our ally which one must support in battle. At the same time it is\r\nemphasized that the opportunity of the construction of a Ukrainian\r\npolitical system does not only depend alone on the Germans but also\r\non our own combined organization and on our ability to produce. Our\r\nmotto here is: \"Our strength lies in ourselves.\" (This settlement of a\r\nGerman policy differentiates itself, despite their careful composure\r\nand stipulation, fundamentally from the rules laid down by Banderas, in\r\nwhich--to my knowledge--it was, up until now, referred to as \"allies\",\r\noften set in quotation marks but never used in connection with the\r\nspecific references to the Reich.)\"\r\n\r\n_e._ A permanent security police force (military) is in every town.\r\nIt draws its replacements from newly captured Ukrainians, is entirely\r\nunder German command and wears the blue-yellow brassard; weapons\r\nare only issued them for guard duty or patrols. At the beginning of\r\nSeptember a (melnyk-friendly) group of 300-500 Ukrainian fugitives out\r\nof Bukawia was used in the district Winnica-Gaisin. They are mainly\r\nserious men with some knowledge of German and up till now we received\r\nno complaints about their services.\r\n\r\n_f._ The _fire of Kiev_ (24-29 September 1941) destroyed the very\r\ncenter, that is the most beautiful and most representative part\r\nof the city with its two large hotels, the central Post Office,\r\nthe radio station, the telegraph office and several department\r\nstores. An area of about 2 square kilometers was affected, some\r\n50,000 people are homeless; they were scantily housed in abandoned\r\nquarters. As reconciliation for the obvious sabotage, the Jews of the\r\ncity, approximately (according to figures from the SS-Commands for\r\ncommitment) 3,500 [sic] people, half women, were liquidated on the 29th\r\nand 30th September. The population took the execution--as much as they\r\nfound out about it--calmly, many with satisfaction; the newly vacated\r\nhomes of the Jews were turned over for the relief of the housing\r\nshortage. Even if certain relief was created in a social respect, the\r\ncare of the city of half a million is still in danger and one can\r\nalready foresee food shortages and eventual epidemics.\r\n\r\nUp to date the danger of mines has not been eliminated--according\r\nto official reports of the engineer officers--at least 10,000 (ten\r\nthousand!) mines were deactivated, among them, of course, a great\r\nnumber in the outskirts of the city (railroad station, civilian\r\nairport, etc.) and in the tactical forward areas; in individual\r\nbuildings (also in museums) there were found 3-1/2 tons of explosives\r\nin prepared, technically correct mine chambers; captured detonator\r\napparatus leads to the belief that other arrangements of similar nature\r\nwere built for wireless detonation. With consideration to possible\r\nelectrical mine detonation, the power supply has not yet been switched\r\non and therefore most staffs and commands are functioning only with\r\ncandle or poor petroleum lighting. The explosion and the burning of the\r\ncity caused several losses on officers, men and materials.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the city remain quiet and disciplined as before;\r\nGerman regulations are enforced to the best ability and without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nI reported over the evacuation measures of the Bolshevists in Kiev in\r\nmy telephone conversation of the 24-29 September; the picture has not\r\nchanged noticeably as a whole.\r\n\r\n_g._ I safe-guarded as much of the local art treasures from libraries,\r\nacademies, institutes and museums with my special detail (2 officers,\r\n2 drivers) as I could. Around 20, partly large, objects could be\r\nsafe-guarded in this manner and are at the disposal of the Reich.\r\n\r\nB. A uniform and supervised administration has not become possible\r\nin the Ukraine on the left of the Dnieper River; the streets to the\r\nfew Dnieper bridges are swarming with prisoners and fugitives, the\r\nactive troop counter-traffic eastward still hasn't stopped. The\r\nBolshevists were able to trash and carry away undetermined quantities\r\nof the harvest, according to the populace. On the other hand, several\r\nevacuees, formerly of Soviet authority, managed to stay back in the\r\n\"Kessel of Kiev\" and to save themselves from further deportation; the\r\nwhole Kiev fire department with its equipment, which was evacuated by\r\nthe Russians, came back again in a like manner on the day before the\r\nfire. In some cases it was possible to salvage several herds of cattle\r\nand machinery.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe economical commands concerned and 1st Lt. Dr. Dittloff report\r\nthrough channels about the special economical situation of the occupied\r\nUkrainian provinces.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith the continuation of the peace, the people are again concerned with\r\ncultural and religious questions:\r\n\r\n_a._ Where it was technically possible, the lower classes of schools\r\nwere opened. The initiative (and the cost) lie with the inhabitants\r\nthemselves. The administrative court will be held responsible for the\r\npolitical attitude of the teachers, the supervision ties with the\r\nGermans. The Soviet school texts are destroyed, all communistic emblems\r\nremoved from the buildings and institutes.\r\n\r\nRequest by Russian (and occasionally Polish) minorities to establish\r\nRussian (or Polish)--especially private--schools will be denied in all\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nJunior high schools, business schools, or even colleges, will not even\r\nbe subject to discussion.\r\n\r\n_b._ A permanent _press_ can be assumed to be existing (in a technical\r\nsense).\r\n\r\nThere are Ukrainian newspapers in Kamienec Podolsk, Rowne, Berditschew,\r\nWinnica, Shitomir, Uman, Kirowograd, Nowo-Ukrainka, Kriwoirog, Cherson,\r\nNikolajew and Kiev (perhaps in a few other places); the papers are\r\npublished from once to six times weekly and are mostly, fairly\r\npure newspapers; some (naturally censored) articles deal with the\r\nanti-bolshevistics and in the field of German-Ukrainian cooperation\r\n(thankfulness for the emancipation, similar parallels, etc.). The\r\nfollowing ground rules pertain to the technique of foreign propaganda:\r\nThe term \"Ukraine\" can only be used in a territorial (not pertaining\r\nto state) sense; the Reich is not an \"ally\", but a \"protector\" of\r\nthe Ukraine; the German Wehrmacht is not \"garrisoned\" (or even\r\n\"occupationally army\" as was formulated by several Bandera men) but\r\ninstead \"saviors\"; the title \"Fuehrer-Emancipator\" is to be used when\r\ntalking of Adolf Hitler, etc.; as far as these directives went, they\r\nwere looked upon as natural and obeyed without a trace of objection.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Six_ different groups were found in the _religious circles_ in\r\nthe Ukrainian Province right of the Dnieper:\r\n\r\n1. The old _Orthodox-Eastern Church_ (also named \"Tychon\" or\r\n\"Slavian\"); it is the closest successor of the pre-bolshevistic\r\nreligious organization and includes the greater part of the\r\nchurch-going populace, Ukrainians and Russians alike; amongst the\r\npriests are several pro-Russians; the rest lean toward a final\r\nre-establishment of the Ukraine. The strength of the group cannot yet\r\nbe given in figures. Alone in the Shitomir province for example, there\r\nare 100 priests; in the city of Kiev there remained two small churches\r\nduring the time of the Russians. Bishops are not present. The 83 year\r\nold Archbishop Antonij Abaschidse, who was found in Kiev, is crippled\r\nand not capable of any conceivable service. A published appeal by the\r\nmetropolite and so-called patriarch Sergius from Moscow to resist\r\nagainst \"Fascism and the German bandits\" (dated 22 June 1941) aroused\r\nno interest among the populace.\r\n\r\n2. _The Ukrainian \"Autokephal\" Church_, a (from an orthodox standpoint)\r\nuncanonic group, consisting of a Ukrainian, home-conscious people,\r\nwithout lawful bishops; it constitutes a religious minority, but\r\nsuffered especially severe persecutions from the Bolshevists and is\r\ncomposed exclusively of radical enemies of Moscow and Bolshevism. It\r\nhas congregations and churches in almost all Ukrainian cities and\r\nopenly pledges ties to the national-Ukrainian bishops in Wolhynien and\r\nto the general government.\r\n\r\nIts union with the first mentioned group for a permanent, anti-Moscow\r\nand pro-German organization is probable. The German authorities\r\n[Behoerde], remembering the decree of the Fuehrer, did not hinder the\r\nreligious participation of both groups, however instructed them, in the\r\nmain intersession prayer--to first remember a prayer for the Fuehrer,\r\nthe Reich and the German Wehrmacht; the instructions were carried out\r\neverywhere where they had been given. Larger religious services (in\r\nopen places, etc.) were often requested, but have so far been rejected.\r\n\r\n3. The _Synodale_ (also \"Erneuerungs Synodale\" or \"Lebende\") church.\r\nIt is justified by laws of the church; however it stands at present\r\nnear an agreement with the Soviet government. Their services where\r\nrequested--for example in Berditschow--were not permitted.\r\n\r\n4. The _Roman-Catholic Church_. Within the framework of the German\r\nmilitary administration, only one religious service was permitted\r\nat the old cathedral in Shitomir (16 Sept 41), but was stopped\r\nbecause of the following \"misuse of the trust placed in the (Polish)\r\nlocal priests.\" The Roman-Catholic cathedral of Shitomir was closed\r\nagain for Latin and Polish services and might be taken over by the\r\nUkrainian-Orthodox congregation.\r\n\r\n5. The Sect of the Altglaeubigen (Russian and Ukrainian \"Raskolniki\").\r\n\r\n6. _Sects converted to Protestantism_ (Adventists, Baptists,\r\nEvangelical Christians, Stundists, etc.).\r\n\r\nBoth sect groups did not request religious services and did not openly\r\ncome into appearance and can be regarded as harmless.\r\n\r\nSpecial director Dr. Stumpp, who was especially appointed for this,\r\nreported on the situation of the _Evangelical Congregations in the\r\nGerman Settling Space_; he is at present with Lt. Vohrer in the German\r\nsettlement on the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNext _Intentions for the Future_:\r\n\r\nAs soon (around the end of October) as the civilian administration\r\noccupies the whole territory right of the Dnieper and their\r\nHeadquarters are established in Kiev, I will follow--providing no other\r\ncommands are given--the high command of the Army Group South and report\r\nat that place.\r\n\r\nFor the time, after the conclusion of the Eastern campaign, I request\r\npermission for special proposals.\r\n\r\n  signed: GIRUS KOCH\r\n  Captain\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 054-PS\r\n\r\n  The Reichminister\r\n  _For The Occupied Eastern Territories_      C.P., 7 October 1942\r\n  The Representative at the Army Sector B.                      L 14/10\r\n  To the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories,\r\n  Chief Section I,\r\n  BERLIN, Unter den Linden 63.\r\n  _Reprint to Captain Lorenz Hq. of the High Command of the\r\n  Army_\r\n\r\n  Subject: Treatment of Ukrainian Specialists.\r\n\r\n  Enclosures:--2--\r\n\r\nAttached I send you the copy of a report made by the Commandant of the\r\nCollecting Center for Specialists at Charkow, (report submitted at the\r\nend of September 1942) as well as the copy of a letter from April 1942.\r\n\r\nRelative to the treatment of Ukrainian specialists in the Reich, I was\r\nasked by the Chief of Staff of the Commander in Chief to attend to the\r\nmatter most emphatically since the complaints here never cease. I have\r\ndiscussed it thoroughly with the chief of section VII at the Commander\r\nin Chief's. I went to see Captain Schmid and visited the camp. As\r\nsynopsis of the discussions with the gentlemen and reading of reports\r\nthe following can be established in general:\r\n\r\n_a._ With some few exceptions the Ukrainians employed individually in\r\nthe Reich e.g. at small trade plants, as agricultural laborers, as\r\ndomestic helps, etc., are very satisfied with their conditions.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Ukrainians sheltered in the community camps, however, complain\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed report of Captain Schmid reports these matters in detail.\r\n\r\nThe question of treatment of the Ukrainians, transported to the Reich\r\nas workers of the East worries the bureaus of the Army concerned a\r\ngreat deal. The Commander in Chief urged me to visit some of the camps\r\nin the Reich myself as soon as possible and to report to the proper\r\nauthorities in order to bring about immediate relief. The Army zone is\r\nby no means satisfied. All the circumstances of discontent contribute\r\nmore and more to more people joining the bands or wandering away to the\r\ncamp of the Bandera esp. other groups hostile to us.\r\n\r\nThe best propaganda of all would be to treat the workers of the\r\nEast well; great demands are not made by the Ukrainians anyhow. If\r\ntheir treatment will only be somewhat better and humanely decent\r\nthese people, who make in part a good impression, will be more than\r\nsatisfied; these people after all came to the Greater German Reich--at\r\nleast at the beginning of the employment of workers of the East in\r\nthe Reich--of their own free will and full of hope. The unsuitable\r\ntreatment described in the reports is hardly propaganda and is not\r\nprofitable for us. After all, we are not at war with the Ukrainian\r\npopulation and certainly not with people who by their voluntary\r\nenlistment for labor, help us to win the war.\r\n\r\nIt also would serve our purposes definitely better to utilize the\r\nspecialist in his specialty.\r\n\r\n  [signed] THEURER\r\n  (Theurer)\r\n  1st Lieutenant\r\n\r\nCopy of Copy\r\n\r\n  Collecting Center for Skilled Workers at Charkow.\r\n  Captain Schmid, Commandant.\r\n  To the Commander of the Army Sector B., Section VII\r\n  _CHARKOW_\r\n  _Subject_: Abuses in the treatment of Ukrainian skilled workers.\r\n\r\nBy reason of my capacity as commandant of the Collecting Center for\r\nskilled workers and the transport of skilled workers to the Reich\r\nconnected with it and thereby being in touch with the various groups of\r\nthe Ukrainian population, I am informed of the morale of the Ukrainians\r\nin the extended surroundings of the Eastern Ukraine. Resulting from\r\nthis knowledge I have to state that an atmosphere of animosity has\r\ntaken the place of the original attitude toward the Reich. This sudden\r\nchange of mood is connected partly with the scarcity of food for the\r\ncivilian population caused by the war and intensified by the measures\r\nfor centralization. The more important motive--the extreme abuses which\r\nhave taken place at various times in the treatment of skilled workers\r\nshipped to Germany.\r\n\r\nSince a prosperous economic cooperation with the 35 million people of\r\nthe Ukraine lies within the interest of our coming generations and\r\nsince the Ukrainians themselves are organically healthy, very capable\r\nof development and rich in valuable and willing constructive forces, it\r\nis necessary to prevent in time an estrangement starting at the roots\r\nand to recognize the beginnings of the disastrous development before it\r\nis too late, and to take effective countermeasures.\r\n\r\nI. _Abuses in recruiting_\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the action the recruiting worked on the basis of\r\nvoluntary enlistment. Later on a certain pressure had to be put on to\r\nreach certain minimum quotas. This however did not give a license to\r\nthe starosts and to their militia, entrusted with the drafting, to the\r\nbrutalities mentioned in the following.\r\n\r\nThe starosts esp. village elders are frequently corruptible, they\r\ncontinue to have the skilled workers, whom they drafted, dragged from\r\ntheir beds at night to be locked up in cellars until they are shipped.\r\nSince the male and female workers often are not given any time to pack\r\ntheir luggage, etc., many skilled workers arrive at the Collecting\r\nCenter for Skilled Workers with equipment entirely insufficient\r\n(without shoes, only two dresses, no eating and drinking utensils, no\r\nblankets, etc.). In particularly extreme cases new arrivals therefore\r\nhave to be sent back again immediately to get the things most necessary\r\nfor them. If people do not come along at once, the threatening and\r\nbeating of skilled workers by the above mentioned militia is a daily\r\noccurrence and is reported from most of the communities. In some cases\r\nwomen were beaten until they could no longer march. One bad case in\r\nparticular was reported by me to the commander of the civil police\r\nhere (colonel Samek) for severe punishment (place Sozolinkow, district\r\nDergatschi). The encroachments of the starosts and the militia are of\r\na particularly grave nature because they usually justify themselves by\r\nclaiming that all that is done in the name of the German Armed Forces.\r\nIn reality the latter have conducted themselves almost throughout\r\nin a highly understanding manner toward the skilled workers and the\r\nUkrainian population. The same, however, can not be said of some of the\r\nadministrative agencies. To illustrate this be it mentioned, that a\r\nwoman once arrived being dressed with barely more than a shirt.\r\n\r\nParticularly distressing is the fact that, on account of issued\r\nordnances to prevent smuggling, all food acquired by the skilled\r\nworkers and the rest of the population by buying or bartering household\r\nutensils, etc., is being taken away by the militia on the way. This is\r\nnot rarely accompanied by beatings (without regard to objections or\r\ngiven circumstances).\r\n\r\nIt happened that skilled workers who came to Germany had sold or\r\nbartered their own belongings partly or completely in that way, thus\r\nthey owned neither household furniture, etc., nor any other goods or\r\nfood. By combatting smuggling in that manner, unfortunately only too\r\noften very poor people are being affected and robbed of their last\r\nproperty, while the real smugglers are hard to catch. Furthermore food\r\nhas disappeared from the market due to a freezing of prices.\r\n\r\nFamily members left behind and formerly supported by those who went to\r\nGermany get social care. This, however, is only the case in the city\r\nof Charkow, not in the case of people on the country (note: used to\r\nbe the case, now all get special food distribution, the hardship thus\r\nis removed). The taking away of food esp. the sale of goods mentioned\r\nabove often results in considerable hardships for those left behind and\r\nhas sometimes strong effects, since neither communal nor reciprocal\r\nassistance exist here.\r\n\r\nVery depressing for the morale of the skilled workers and the\r\npopulation is the effect of those persons shipped back from Germany\r\nfor having become disabled or not having been fit for labor commitment\r\nfrom the very beginning. Several times already transports of skilled\r\nworkers on their way to Germany have crossed returning transports\r\nof such disabled persons and have stood on the tracks alongside of\r\neach other for a long period of time. These returning transports\r\nare insufficiently cared for. Nothing but sick, injured and weak\r\npeople, mostly 50-60 to a car, are usually escorted by 3-4 men. There\r\nis neither sufficient care or food. The returnees made frequently\r\nunfavorable--but surely exaggerated--statements relative to their\r\ntreatment in Germany and on the way. As a result of all this and of\r\nwhat the people could see with their own eyes, a psychosis of fear\r\nwas evoked among the specialist workers esp. the whole transport\r\nto Germany. Several transport leaders--of the 62nd and the 63rd in\r\nparticular-reported thereto in detail. In one case the leader of the\r\ntransport of skilled workers observed with his own eyes how a person\r\nwho died of hunger was unloaded from a returning transport on the\r\nside track [1st Lt. Hoffmann of the 63rd transport, Station Darniza].\r\nAnother time it was reported that 3 dead had to be deposited by the\r\nside of the tracks on the way and had to be left behind unburied by the\r\nescort. It is also regrettable that these disabled persons arrive here\r\nwithout any identification. According to the reports of the transport\r\ncommanders one gets the impression that these persons unable to work\r\nare assembled, penned into the wagons and are sent off provided only\r\nby a few men escort, and without special care for food and medical or\r\nother attendance. The Labor Office at the place of arrival as well as\r\nthe transport commanders confirm this impression.\r\n\r\nII. _Deficiencies on Transport_\r\n\r\nDuring the transport to Germany provisions should be made for food,\r\nwater and drink, answering the call of nature, medical care, orderly\r\ntransportation, avoidance of maltreatment, delousing according to\r\nregulation, and supervision. To take care of all this a military escort\r\nis detailed consisting of 1 car commander for each car, 1 train guard\r\nfor every 6 cars, 1 supply man for every 5 cars, and 1 control staff\r\nfor every 3 cars. This is the minimum strength required according to\r\ncorresponding reports of all transport commanders. With less than that\r\norderly care and transportation of specialists is no longer secured.\r\nIt has been often confirmed that insufficient and uninstructed escorts\r\ncaused fatal accidents, insufficient food and care, escape of hundreds\r\nof workers, most brutal maltreatment with consequent disorder and\r\nconfusion. Unfortunately the escorts were depleted on the way in\r\nvarious manners by Army details esp. by commanders for the supervision\r\nof furloughs or after the transports were taken over by the police.\r\nThis always affected the transports unfavorably. The transports\r\ncommanders are instructed to secure the interests of the transports by\r\nall possible means against encroachments of all kind. They are of vital\r\nimportance for the Great German Reich.\r\n\r\nRecently the practice started of handing the transports over to new\r\nescorts in Przemysl. These escorts are under the command of a delegate\r\nof the German Labor Front or the Ministry of Labor. This practice is\r\nclearly against the regulations and rules of the Reich Marshal and\r\nthe Deputy General for Labor Supply. Taking a good management of the\r\ntransport by the delegates for granted, incoming reports here list the\r\nfollowing deficiencies: The escorts are understaffed which causes in\r\npart lack of care and food and rough treatment, doctors and released\r\nfemale domestic helpers are detained in camps without authority for\r\nwant of supplementary identification papers, social care is lacking.\r\nA verbal report at hand relates in detail and with the witnesses the\r\nirresponsibility and indecent conduct of delegate Albert Nuessen who\r\ntook over the 62nd transport. The transfer to the camp is made as\r\nfast as possible and not perfect. The railroad offices are of course\r\ndirected to support the transport commanders. Unfortunately, however,\r\nsome of the office chiefs of the railroad treat the transports of\r\nspecialists often as very immaterial. The chief of transportation in\r\nRomodan e.g. stated to a transport commander that these transports are\r\nnot important. Yet the Fuehrer himself ordered these transports, and\r\nthe problem of work power was declared to be the most important and\r\nurgent in order to increase the potential of armament!\r\n\r\nThe food situation of the transports is now somewhat improved after\r\ngiving right notice ahead of time. Previously some of the food\r\nstations failed grossly. However, it happens again and again that in\r\nspite of giving advance notice of the transports strength in time,\r\nno warm or cold food is ready or available. Sometimes this is due to\r\nmilitary or hospital transports which passed through before. This can\r\nbe easily understood. Sometimes, however, the notice was not passed\r\non or simply nothing at all was done. In the Reich it is generally\r\nbetter. Of course it happens when trains are detoured a great deal of\r\nthe specialists go hungry for days. The iron ration is always taken\r\nalong and also used. It mostly depends on the transport commander and\r\nthe office chief for social care how unforeseen food difficulties are\r\novercome. The Army offices show always greatest understanding for\r\nsupplying these transports, the deputies of the labor front most of\r\nthe time fulfill their appointments well, however some of the deputies\r\nof the attendance service have completely failed in their duties. The\r\ntransport commanders are instructed to give exact names and conditions\r\nin the future. The red cross which at times is overburdened helps with\r\nthe supplying; unfortunately, however, the attitude and behavior of\r\nmany female red cross workers toward the specialists is based often\r\non uncomprehension of the Fuehrer's great action in regard to Eastern\r\nworkers, and they treat especially the female workers in an outrageous\r\nmanner. Food also has been refused at times with the reference that\r\nthese were \"Russian swine.\" Nobody pays attention to the fact that\r\nthese are Ukrainians, because there is a lack of information to that\r\neffect. In reference to this, attention is called to the fact that it\r\nhas happened on several occasions that people have broken out of the\r\ncars after several days of hungering, hurried into the nearby villages,\r\nsold their goods and acquired food. In such cases of course, it is not\r\nto be expected that they all come back. Such gross incidents of the\r\ntransports of the first months have not, to our knowledge been repeated\r\nin the summer. However, it has been reported that about 500 workers\r\nescaped along the route out of a transport which started from Kiev,\r\naccompanied by only a few policemen, supposedly 5 in all, (and without\r\nmedical personnel) and which convoy was badly supplied and taken care\r\nof.\r\n\r\nTo understand the supply problem, it is important to know that often\r\nonly a short time is being allotted for the feeding of the many\r\nhundred people by the train commander or the railway station officer.\r\nTherefore all the workers can only be fed before the departure of the\r\ntrain if there is a sufficient amount of accompanying and attendance\r\npersonnel and if the food is handed out quickly at several distributing\r\npoints; in addition close co-operation of the workers is needed.\r\nBecause the transports must often stop 1-3 Km outside of the stations\r\nit still happens frequently that a small part of the workers remains\r\nwithout rations because the engineers, in spite of agreements and the\r\nstationmaster let the trains take off without warning. On the basis of\r\nreported incidents, attention must be called to the fact that it is\r\nirresponsible to keep the workers locked in the cars for many hours so\r\nthat they cannot even take care of the calls of nature. It is evident\r\nthat the people of a transport must be given an opportunity from\r\ntime to time to get drinking water, to wash, and in order to relieve\r\nthemselves. Cars have been showed in which people had made holes so\r\nthey could take care of the calls of nature. When nearing bigger\r\nstations persons should, if possible relieve themselves far from these\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nThe following abuses were reported from the delousing stations: In\r\nthe women's and girls' shower rooms, services was partly performed\r\nby men or men would mingle around or even helped with the soaping!;\r\nand vice versa, there was female personnel in the men's shower rooms;\r\nmen also for some time were taking photographs in the women's shower\r\nrooms. Since mainly Ukrainian peasants were transported in the last\r\nmonths, as far as the female portion of these are concerned they are\r\nmostly of a high moral standard and used to strict decency, they\r\nmust have considered such a treatment as a national degradation. The\r\nabove mentioned abuses have been, according to our knowledge, settled\r\nby the intervention of the transport commanders. The reports of the\r\nphotographing were made from Halle; the reports about the former were\r\nmade from Kiewerce. Such incidents in complete disregard of the honor\r\nand respect of the Greater German Reich may still occur again here or\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIII. _Abuses inside Germany_\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the higher authorities in the Reich do everything to\r\nattend, in the best manner, to the workers from the East, especially\r\nfrom the Ukraine, who have been called to Germany. In most of the\r\nenterprises, too, in the countries and in households, one is not\r\nonly satisfied most of the time with the Ukrainian women and girls\r\nas help, but they are also treated with a happy solicitude and with\r\nunderstanding for their position and for our relations to the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nHere too, unfortunately voices are heard that tell of bad treatment in\r\nthe collecting as well as other camps. All the time people tell about\r\nbeatings and thrashings and constantly also they write about them. It\r\nseems that especially these men who have functions pertaining to order\r\nand security violate sometimes very much the limits of admissibility\r\nand identify the Ukrainians as Bolsheviks while they have actually for\r\ndecades opposed themselves to Bolshevism as its natural enemies. The\r\ncamp commanders also, usually show no understanding for the Ukrainians.\r\nThe treatment in the camps is described as being bad and very brutal.\r\n\r\nWith regard to food, it is being felt in Germany that in a war for life\r\nand death, it is but natural to impose harsh restrictions in the first\r\nplace on foreigners who have been up to the present in the enemy's\r\ncamps. No doubt the Reich and the businesses make efforts to keep the\r\nworkers who were brought in, in good health and working condition.\r\nIf abuses take place here, it is harmful to ourselves and should be\r\nremedied in each single case.\r\n\r\nDisadvantageous also is the fact that a great portion of the German\r\npopulation considers the Ukrainian labor forces as their worst enemies\r\nand as _Russian Bolshevists_ and treat them accordingly. A definite\r\nclarification is urgently needed here. In the face of such an attitude\r\nof the Ukraine it will be completely impossible to have for decades and\r\ncenturies a successful and durable solution for the great economical\r\nand political problem of the East especially of the Southern part.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the postal communication problem of the specialists with\r\ntheir country was not fully solved and gave cause to ill rumor and\r\ndepression. At present an improvement is being planned.\r\n\r\nHere in the Ukraine thousands of recruiting notices and placards have\r\nbeen put out to get cooperation from the people and urging them to\r\nreport to the Reich with the assurance of best treatment. Therefore,\r\nconsidering this and also the above mentioned abuses, it would seem\r\nto be of interest to the Reich, and necessary for the security of our\r\nfuture race and to prevent a later evil, to prevent by all means an\r\nalienation of the Ukraine with its precious territories and population\r\nby settling vicious abuses and by a clarification of the situation.\r\n\r\n  Certified True Copy C.P. 5 Oct 1942.\r\n  [illegible signature]\r\n  Envelope\r\n  At the V.O. of the Reichs Ministry for the occupied territories of\r\n  the East.\r\n  Deputy with Army, Territory B.\r\n  Official seal.\r\n\r\nCopy of Copy\r\n\r\n Copy of a letter of graduate engineer given to the Specialist\r\n Collecting Camp.

Nester!\r\n  Good Day!\r\n\r\nAs I have told you in my letter of 20 Apr. 42, we have been transported\r\nto the Grunewald Railroad car repair factories. In the first week I\r\nhave worked as a manual laborer in the main warehouse of the works.\r\nI have unloaded coal, have dug the ground and have stacked lumber.\r\nThis is supposed to be the \"employment of Specialists\" in their own\r\nline of work. The question constantly arises, why did I go to Germany,\r\nmaybe that I who volunteered as a specialist (graduate engineer) for\r\nGermany, am to be transformed into a banned prisoner? I wonder why?\r\nWhat misdeeds have I committed against Germany? On the contrary, I\r\nhave believed all those who spoke in Charkow about the worker's life\r\nin Germany. My attitude toward Germany has remained kind and friendly,\r\nI want to work, but I do not want to be led astray, to be treated as\r\na civilian prisoner and without any care, or as a forgotten man who\r\ncan find nowhere and receives from nobody, care and moral backing. I\r\nhad hoped that we would be treated humanely and quite differently. It\r\nshould be clear that I did not come to Germany to beg for charity. I\r\nhad a job in Charkow and a decent working place; this I have renounced\r\nfor the good of Germany and sacrificed for the improvement of the\r\ncondition of my family. It was clear to me that I had to help that\r\nstate that delivered me from the Bolshevist yoke, from this yoke under\r\nwhich I had to live for 24 years. Now I had expected a better future\r\nfor myself. Our food ration consists of: at 4 o'clock in the morning\r\n3/4 of a liter of tea, in the evening at 6 o'clock 3/4 of a liter of\r\nsoup and 250 grams of bread a day. That is all. With such food we have\r\nto dig the ground and great requirements are made from us just like\r\nfrom manual laborers. On account of the under-nourishment and the heavy\r\nwork I am weak and exhausted today and I don't know if I can endure and\r\nsurvive this much longer. To what conditions thoughtlessness can drive\r\na man! Into a condition which will probably not be pleasant to anybody.\r\n\r\nI beg you all, deliver me, help that I can go back to my family!\r\nIf this is impossible, ease my condition otherwise I may commit a\r\nstupidity, escape or suicide.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility to continue to live like this.\r\n\r\n  Your,\r\n  Grigori.\r\n\r\n P.S.: Expect with impatience to hear from you. What is the possibility\r\n of sending me a work suit which in my stupidity I have not taken along.\r\n\r\n Certified copy of Original 5 Oct. 42\r\n\r\n Mamperl, employee\r\n\r\n (At the V.O. of the Reich Ministry of the occupied territories of the\r\n East.

Various district leaders proposed to let these\r\npurchases be handled by suitable private merchants who know these\r\ndistricts and have corresponding connections.\r\n\r\nI have brought these proposals to the attention of the National\r\nEconomic Minister and am quoting his reply of 16 December 1943 on\r\naccount of its fundamental importance: I consider it a specially\r\nimportant task to make use of the economic power of the occupied\r\nterritories for the Nation. You are aware of the fact that since\r\nthe occupation of the Western territories the buying out of these\r\ncountries has been affected in the greatest proportion. Raw materials,\r\nsemi-finished products and stocks of finished goods have been rolling\r\nto Germany for months, valuable machines were sent to our armaments\r\nindustry. Everything was done at that time to increase our armament\r\npotentialities. Later on the shipments of these important economic\r\ngoods were replaced by the so-called distribution of orders from\r\nindustry to industry. These measures are running smoothly and with\r\ngood success for a long time. They were again strengthened these\r\nlast few months because we were more than ever before forced by the\r\nshutting-down of the consumer goods industry in favor of armament to\r\nuse the economic powers of the Western occupied territories for these\r\nGerman needs.\r\n\r\nWith the growing volume of the distribution of orders the black-market\r\nalso lost more ground and the termination of products as to kind,\r\nquality and price was taken into our hands much more effectively. In\r\nthe spring of this year, therefore, the Reichsmarschal was able to\r\ndecide to prohibit all black-market purchases through German agencies.\r\nSince, besides the industrial fabrication from old stocks and from\r\nuncontrollable production in the Western occupied territories,\r\ncertain supplies always exist which are not covered by the industrial\r\ndisplacement, the proper German agencies have received the order from\r\nme to get also these free stocks of finished goods besides securing\r\nproduction for the displacement. In doing so, one must not form a\r\nwrong idea of the amount of these stocks. They usually are not as\r\nbig as they might appear to be in the display window of some cities\r\nof the Western territories. These purchases are being made under the\r\ncontrol of central purchase agencies and according to the regulations\r\nof the national agencies. Moreover, these purchases have already been\r\nin the hands of German companies proven in foreign business. Since,\r\nin addition to these firms, buyers have recently acted who used to\r\nbe active in the black-market and are not sufficiently competent\r\nnor always reliable, I have formed recently for France and Belgium\r\neach a common buying office for the companies permitted for certain\r\nbusinesses. It is the task of these offices to purchase the finished\r\ngoods without disturbing the distribution of orders specially for the\r\nsupply for air attack losses. These offices represent a coordination\r\nof the especially experienced German companies in Belgium and France.\r\nAmong them are, for instance, also a number of respectable Hamburg\r\nfirms. The offices are getting general directions from the Reich\r\noffices as to which goods are urgently needed for the provision for\r\nbombed out people. Besides, it is up to their private economical\r\ninitiative to develop fully these possibilities, on which I am also\r\nputting the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I may assume that your proposals have already been carried\r\nout. Difficulties in the delivery of the goods to the Reich are solely\r\ndue to the present specially strained transport situation. Frequently\r\nduring the last few weeks it was not possible to bring in even the most\r\nimportant goods destined for the bombed out civilians from the Western\r\noccupied territories. Upon an improvement of the transport situation,\r\nthe provision with these goods will also improve. Special actions,\r\ntherefore, can also not change this situation. They would only disturb\r\nthe order of the practice established after many troubles.\r\n\r\n  Signed M.

(doctor, honorus causa) von Rabenau has\r\nappeared in the publications section of the NSDAP. Group I: German\r\nMilitary Might, published by the Central Publishing Co. of the NSDAP,\r\nSuccessors to Franz Eher Inc. Ltd. (GmbH) Berlin.\r\n\r\nI cannot but point out this spiritual outpouring as a digression, at\r\nleast as inadequate. It is on the same order as the many lectures\r\nwhich General von Rabenau gave to officers before the present war\r\nand its tendencies are directed against the concept of the German\r\nsoldier which was born with the national-socialistic revolution, even\r\nif this tendency is cleverly kept to a minimum in this case. Just\r\nas in his lectures, Rabenau uses the method of arbitrary juggling\r\nwith philosophic learning, which on one hand displays a widespread\r\nknowledge, and on the other consciously holds back from the clarity\r\nfor which we strive with the national-socialistic world philosophy\r\n[Weltanschauung].\r\n\r\nAs I have reported before in conversation with you, General von Rabenau\r\ngave a lecture in Aachen some time before this war to a group of some\r\n60 to 70 younger officers and about 15 leaders of the party who were\r\ninvited, and among whom I chanced to be, about the development of the\r\npeople's army. According to Rabenau, the present people's army began\r\nabout 1813 during the wars of Liberation (Napoleonic) and developed in\r\nthe decades which followed to its present size, thanks to the great\r\nGerman qualities of soldiery which reached their zenith in the army of\r\none hundred thousand men. The national-socialistic revolution which\r\ncreated the popular will for soldiery, and with it the developments for\r\nthe establishment of the first German people's army is not mentioned in\r\nany way, much less, in the role of being the dynamic creative force.\r\nRabenau contented himself with presenting only a few quotations from\r\nthe Fuehrer's \"Mein Kampf\". The politically ignorant officers got the\r\nimpression, as Rabenau knew how to talk vividly and convincingly,\r\nthat the size of the present day people's army was an accomplishment\r\nof the old military forces, and in their later thinking they will ask\r\nthemselves: \"Why is there so much emphasis on the Party? Why invite the\r\nParty fuehrers? This is an affair for soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I asked a question after the lecture, which unfortunately did\r\nnot offer a discussion period, and explained to him that he was in\r\nno wise justified by history, that he had denied the mother of the\r\npeople's army, the Revolution, the Party, he overbore me in the\r\narrogant manner which is peculiar to him with references to Indian,\r\nChinese, French, English and German philosophies in order to prove to\r\nme in front of several listeners that his lecture presentation was\r\ncorrect. I replied with the philosophic ideas which I have won in\r\nthe practical struggle of life, and insisted on the correctness of my\r\nconcept. He professes not to be able to allow my contentions because\r\nthey were not scientifically based. According to all appearances only\r\nthose philosophic ideas are scientifically based, for him, which were\r\ndeveloped _before_ the national-socialistic revolution.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of Rabenau made itself clear at the close of this\r\nconversation, when the church came into the debate as the educational\r\nfactor [Erziehungsfaktor]. After he had affirmed the necessity of the\r\nchurches, Rabenau said with emphasized self-assurance something like\r\nthe following, \"Dear Gauleiter, the Party is making mistake after\r\nmistake in the business with the churches. Obtain for me the necessary\r\npowers from the Fuehrer, and I guarantee that I shall succeed in a\r\nfew months in establishing peace with the churches for all times.\"\r\nAfter this catastrophic ignorance I gave up the conversation about the\r\nimportance of philosophic ideas for our ordinary life [Volksleben].\r\n\r\nDear Party Member Hess: The reading of General von Rabenau's pamphlet\r\n\"Spirit and Soul of the Soldier\" has reminded me again of this. In this\r\nbrochure, just as at that time, Rabenau affirms the necessity of the\r\nchurch, straightforward and clearly, even if it is prudently careful.\r\nHe writes on page 28:\r\n\r\nThere could be more examples, they would suffice to show that soldiers\r\nin this world can scarcely get along without thoughts about the next\r\none.\r\n\r\nBecause General von Rabenau is falsely based spiritually, I consider\r\nhis activities as an educator in spiritual affairs as dangerous and I\r\nam of the opinion that his educational writings are to be dispensed\r\nwith absolutely, and that the publications section of the NSDAP can and\r\nmust renounce these writings.\r\n\r\nIf such spiritual educational work should be done, in the interests of\r\nthe German armed forces, then the Publications Section of the NSDAP can\r\nbe permitted to accept for publication only brochures about \"Spirit\r\nand Soul of the Soldier\" which point out most strongly the permanent\r\ndanger for \"Spirit and Soul of the Soldier.\" The churches with their\r\nChristianity are this danger against which the struggle must always be\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nI considered it my duty to tell you again of my concept of General von\r\nRabenau, as well as to convey my criticism of the Publications Section\r\nof the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n\r\n  signed: FLORIAN\r\n  Gauleiter\r\n\r\n  official seal of\r\n  Gauleiter\r\n  Gau Duesseldorf\r\n  enclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 066-PS\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS PARTY\r\n\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer\r\n  Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n  Reichsleiter\r\n  Alfred Rosenberg\r\n  Berlin W 35\r\n  Margaretenstr 17\r\n\r\n  Munich 24 June 1940\r\n  The Brown House\r\n  III/Dr Kl--Eg\r\n  Chancellory Rosenberg\r\n  Receipt Nr 1799 M.\r\n  1 July 40\r\n\r\n  H\r\n\r\n  Copy to III for comment--2 July\r\n\r\nEnclosed please find the draft of a decree about the judicial status\r\nof religious organizations and congregations in the Reich district\r\nDanzig-West Prussia, with a request for your comment.\r\n\r\nThe draft in its present form has been approved by District Leader\r\nForster.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Signed: M.

It is desirable, however, to proceed in\r\nindividual cases in such a way that Jews will live together in one\r\nhouse, as much as feasible under rental conditions.\r\n\r\n_b._ For this reason the arianization of real estate will be _the last\r\nstep of the total arianization_, that means that at present real\r\nestate is only to be arianized in individual cases where there are\r\ncompelling reasons. An immediate concern is the arianization of plants\r\nand business enterprises, farm property, forests, etc.\r\n\r\n2. _The use of sleepers and dining cars is to be prohibited for Jews._\r\nApart from that no separate Jew-compartments must be arranged for.\r\nNeither should any bans be pronounced regarding the use of railways,\r\nstreetcars, subways, buses and ships.\r\n\r\n3. The ban for Jews is to be pronounced only for certain public\r\nestablishments etc. This includes such hotels and restaurants which\r\nare mainly visited by Party members (for instance: Hotel Kaiserhof,\r\nBerlin; Hotel Vierjahreszeiten, Munich; Hotel Deutscher Hof, Nurnberg;\r\nHotel Drei Mohren, Augsburg, etc.). The ban can further be pronounced\r\nfor swimming pools, certain public squares, resort towns, etc. Mineral\r\nbaths may, in individual cases and if prescribed by a doctor, be used\r\nby Jews, but only in a manner not causing offense.\r\n\r\nII. Pensions are not to be denied to Jews who have been civil servants\r\nand who have been pensioned. It is to be investigated, however, whether\r\nthose Jews can manage on a smaller pension.\r\n\r\nIII. Jewish social care is not to be arianized or to be abolished,\r\nso that Jews will not become a public burden but can be cared for by\r\nJewish institutions.\r\n\r\nIV. Jewish patents are property values and therefore to be arianized\r\ntoo. (A similar procedure was used during the World War by America and\r\nother states pertaining to German citizens.)\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n  _Mixed Marriages_:\r\n\r\nI. 1. _with children_ (half-Aryans 1 class)\r\n\r\n_a._ If the father is German and the mother Jewish the family is\r\npermitted to remain in their present apartment. No ban for Jews\r\nregarding housing is to be pronounced against these families.\r\n\r\nThe property of the Jewish mother may be transferred in such cases to\r\nthe German husband respectively the half-Aryan children.\r\n\r\n_b._ If the father is Jewish and the mother German these families\r\nare neither to be housed in Jewish quarters for the time being. This\r\nbecause the children (half-Aryan 1st class) are not to be exposed to\r\nthe Jewish agitation as they will have to serve later in the labor\r\nservice and the armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe property may for the time being be transferred partly or entirely\r\nto the children.\r\n\r\n2. _without children_\r\n\r\n_a._ If the husband is German and the wife Jewish par. 1 a holds true\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n_b._ If the husband is Jewish and the wife German these childless\r\ncouples are to be treated as pure Jews.\r\n\r\nProperty values of the husband cannot be transferred to the wife. Both\r\ncan be lodged in Jewish houses or quarters.

The clause concerning confiscations to be undertaken in Reich\r\nterritory is doubtless a regulation which has not yet been introduced,\r\nand directly because of this I have asked you to propose such a\r\nregulation to the Fuehrer. The proposal originated in a decree\r\nof the Fuehrer relative to the work of the higher institutes of\r\nlearning whereby the question of research institutes and library\r\nwere given priority and the official bureaus of the Party and the\r\nstate were instructed to support me in this work. Now it is clear\r\nthat the philosophical opponents of the regime (this is especially\r\ntrue in the case of the recently confiscated religious archives)\r\nare concealing a quantity of the things which are of priceless,\r\nperhaps of irreplaceable, value for the later research of the higher\r\ninstitutes of learning. Because an actual necessity seems to be\r\npresent, I wish to make the already cited proposal. It is understood\r\nthat the confiscations are not executed by the regional authorities\r\n[Gauleitungen] but that this is conducted by the Security Service\r\n[SD] as well as by the police. Scientific work can only be done of\r\ncourse after the confiscation by the police, but here--and this is\r\ndecisive--all must decide what is necessary for police compilations\r\n(actual correspondence with philosophical opponents and other\r\nmaterial) and what does not fall under the competency of the police,\r\nbut under the research work done by seminary, that is the Reich\r\ndirection [Reichsleiter] of the Nazi Party. The taking of an office\r\nby Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich is only to be considered as much, not as a\r\nbinding engagement. I therefore have decided on this proposal because\r\nit has been communicated to me in writing by a Gauleiter, that the\r\nChief Office of the Reich Security [Reichssicherheitshauptamt] of\r\nthe SS has claimed the following from the library of a monastery: The\r\nCatholic Handbook, Albertus Magnus; Edition of the Church Fathers;\r\nHistory of the Papacy by L.V. Pastor and other works. That means that\r\nalready historical sources and works are being claimed for the Police\r\nfrom the monastery libraries of the districts [Gaue] which must remain\r\nreserved uniquely for the work of the Reich direction [Reichsleitung]\r\nof the Nazi Party respectively the state research places. These aspects\r\nhave already been discussed thoroughly in the question of confiscated\r\nproperty in occupied areas. I have transmitted to you a photocopy of\r\nmy convention with the Security Service [SD] which was reached with\r\nthe express approval of Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich. I would like also\r\nto mention that this work has been executed in accordance with the\r\nagreement and always in a loyal fashion (with the exception of a case\r\nin Holland which I hope will be likewise solved in the same way).\r\nPhotocopies and written copies should be made available to me of all\r\nmaterial which the police has rightly confiscated for their political\r\npolice purposes, but which according to its nature, must also be\r\nappropriated for a later research value. In my view there exists in\r\nitself no fundamental difficulty if both sides adopt the viewpoint\r\nof being loyal on their own and to the missions of the Partner. I\r\nrequest once more special efforts to prevent that valuable writings are\r\narbitrarily extracted from the libraries in various districts by the\r\nChief Office of Reich Security [Reichssicherheitshauptamt] or other\r\npolice service offices. On this account I propose the regulation that\r\nall confiscations remain under the full powers [Oberhoheit] of the\r\ndistrict leader and be examined by my deputies in case later research\r\nvalue in the respective district itself appears possible.\r\n\r\n2. There is a great misunderstanding with respect to what is\r\ninvolved in the question of the south-east and the employment of\r\nmy administrative staff; art objects have always been treated as a\r\nsecond line problem. In the first line an order of the chief of the\r\nhigh command of the Armed Forces [OKW] on the instance of the Fuehrer\r\nhas gone twice to the occupied territories of the west to place all\r\nscientific and archive materials of ideological opponents of the regime\r\n[Weltanschaulicher Gegner] at my disposal for research purposes. That\r\nhas resulted also in close cooperation on the widest scale with the\r\nSecurity Service [SD] and the military commanders, and I believe that\r\nI have secured priceless research pieces for the Reich directorate\r\n[Reichsleitung] of the Nazi party and its higher institutes of\r\nlearning. I wish to inform you especially that as many as 7000 crates\r\nhave been brought to Germany up to the present moment. In the course\r\nof these confiscations we have found according to the nature of the\r\ncase other valuable cultural objects including very valuable works of\r\nart. And in order that these things should not be dispersed and that\r\nthey be secured for the Fuehrer, the Chief of the high command of the\r\narmed forces (OKW) on my request and on the instance of the Fuehrer\r\nhas ordered that these art objects should be catalogued by me. I ask\r\nyou that if necessary it should be established for the benefit of\r\nthe Reich Marshal that my working staff has executed these tasks in\r\na correct fashion and in an _objective_ blameless form. Art objects\r\ngenerally do not come into question as far as the Balkans are concerned\r\nalthough there are Free-Masonry archives and Jewish libraries and\r\nother relevant research objects. In my opinion only the same attitude\r\nas that prevailing in occupied French territory can be taken and what\r\nI requested, was really only an expansion of an already existing\r\nregulation. For General Field Marshal List, and likewise for the\r\nGeneral Quartermaster of the Army the work has already begun and my men\r\nare at work with these circles in Belgrade. By command of General Field\r\nMarshal List as well as of his deputy general, these men will also be\r\nemployed in closest relationship with the Security Service in Salonika.\r\nAs you know, Salonika is one of the largest Jewish centers.\r\n\r\nI should like to remark in this connection that this affair has\r\nalready been executed on our side with the Security Service in the\r\nmost loyal fashion. One of our collaborators who also belongs to the\r\nSecurity Service, had his duty-obligation countermanded by the Security\r\nService, whereupon it was impressed upon him that the Security Service\r\ncooperates with my administrative staff in a most loyal fashion. The\r\nposition is thus clarified in a practical fashion and the work has\r\ntaken its course. What I asked was only a confirmation that the already\r\npronounced decisions for the West should also have validity under\r\nthe given circumstances for other occupied or to be occupied areas.\r\nFinally the representative of the Fuehrer has expressly ordered that\r\nthe appropriate party members in this question should be placed, so as\r\nnot to permit this unique opportunity for an inquiry in the Jewish and\r\nMasonic lodge question to be lost. The agreement on this matter is thus\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nI trust that this letter has cleared up the resulting misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 072-PS\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS PARTY\r\n\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer, Staff Commander\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer Headquarters 19 April 1941\r\n  Fuehrer Bureau (Bo/Fu)\r\n  Chancellory Rosenberg\r\n  No 4609 H, 21 April 41\r\n  Shown to the Reichsleiter on the 22. 4\r\n  [rubber stamp]\r\n\r\n  To Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg\r\n  Berlin W 35, Margaretenstr. 17\r\n  Copy to Utikal\r\n\r\n  Dear party member Rosenberg!\r\n\r\nIn connection with the received draft of the decree I attended, as\r\nordered, a speech made by SS Brig. Gen. Heydrich. The latter called\r\nattention to the fact that the sentence, \"In the confiscations\r\nundertaken, or to be undertaken in the Reich area, of the property of\r\nideological opponents, the same rules apply\", anticipates a regulation\r\nwhich has so far not been introduced and would for the first time set a\r\nprecedent through this decree-draft. Moreover, the regional governments\r\n[Gauleitungen] are never allowed to carry out confiscations.\r\n\r\nGruppenfuehrer Heydrich further pointed out that he could under no\r\ncircumstances recognize the attempted regulation in the final sentence\r\nof your decree-draft, since there existed some objections to it. The\r\nscientific treatment of the ideological opposition could only be done\r\nin conjunction with the political police work. Only the material should\r\nbe handed over to you, and the seminar respectively. If a speedier\r\ntreatment through your office is necessary, duplicates and photocopies\r\nshould be put at your disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer emphasized that in the Balkans the use of your experts\r\nwould not be necessary, since there were no art-objects to be\r\nconfiscated. In Belgrade only the collection of Prince Paul existed,\r\nwhich would be returned to him completely. The remaining material of\r\nthe lodges, etc. would be seized by the agencies of Gruppenfuehrer\r\nHeydrich.\r\n\r\nThe libraries and art objects of the monasteries, confiscated in\r\nthe Reich, were to remain for the time being in these monasteries,\r\ninsofar as the Gauleiters had not determined otherwise. After the\r\nwar, a careful examination of the stock could be undertaken. Under no\r\ncircumstances, however, should a centralization of all the libraries be\r\nundertaken, the Fuehrer has repeatedly rejected this suggestion.\r\n\r\n  signed: M.

The Commands work upon the special\r\nauthorization and according to the general directives in the Camp\r\nregulations which was given to them and is independently in close\r\nharmony with the AO.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the Commands is the political screening of prisoners and\r\nthe segregation and further handling of undesirable elements among them\r\nwith regard to political, criminal or similar respects.\r\n\r\nResources cannot be placed at the disposal of the Commands for the\r\nfulfillment of their missions. The \"German penal code\" [Fahndungsbuch],\r\nthe \"Temporary permit of Leave List\" [Aufenthaltsermittlungsliste], and\r\n\"Special Penal Code USSR\" will prove to be of little value; the Special\r\nPenal Code USSR therefore does not suffice as only a small part therein\r\nis dangerous to the designated Soviet Russians.\r\n\r\nThe Commands will therefore have to rely on their own specialty and\r\ningenuity upon establishment and self-producing knowledge. Therefore\r\nthey will only then be able to begin with the fulfillment of their\r\nmission when they have gathered an appropriate amount of material.\r\n\r\nFor their work, the Commands are to make as much use of the experiences\r\nof the Camp Commanders as possible, who in the meantime have profited\r\nby the observation and examination of prisoners.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Commands will have to take pains from the beginning to\r\nsearch among the prisoners for seemingly trustworthy elements, may\r\nthey be communists or not, in order to make them useful for their\r\nintelligence purposes.\r\n\r\nThrough the establishment of such trusted personnel [V-Personen] and\r\nthrough the use of all other present possibilities among the prisoners,\r\nit must succeed to screen all elements.\r\n\r\nIn every case the Commands are to provide themselves with definite\r\nclarity over the encountered measures through the examination and\r\neventual questioning of prisoners.\r\n\r\nAbove all it is important to find out:\r\n\r\n 1. all outstanding functionaries of the State and of the Party,\r\n especially\r\n\r\n 2. professional revolutionists,\r\n\r\n 3. the functionaries of the Comintern,\r\n\r\n 4. all leading Party functionaries of the Russian Secret Police\r\n [KPdSU] and their associated organizations in the Central, district,\r\n and county Committees,\r\n\r\n 5. all the Peoples' Commissars and their Assistants,\r\n\r\n 6. all the former Polit-Commissars in the Red Army,\r\n\r\n 7. all leading personalities of the Central and Middle Offices among\r\n the State authorities,\r\n\r\n 8. the leading economic personalities,\r\n\r\n 9. the Soviet Russian Intelligence agents,\r\n\r\n 10. all Jews,\r\n\r\n 11. all persons who are established as being instigators or fanatical\r\n communists.\r\n\r\nJust as important is the finding of persons who are devoted to the\r\nreconstruction, the administration, and management of the conquered\r\nRussian provinces.\r\n\r\nFinally, such persons must be secured who can be used to transact\r\nfurther discoveries, whether of the Police or similar work, and for the\r\nclarification of universal interesting questions. In this category fall\r\nall the higher State and Party functionaries who are in the camp on the\r\nbasis of their position and knowledge and who can give information on\r\nthe measures and working methods of the Soviet State, the Communistic\r\nParty or the Cominterns.\r\n\r\nIn view of the pending decisions, considerations must also be given\r\nto the peoples' membership. At the end of the screening, measures, to\r\nbe decided later, as to the transfer of prisoners from one command to\r\nanother, will follow.\r\n\r\nThe Camp Commanders are directed by the Supreme Command of the Army to\r\nreport such proposals.\r\n\r\nExecutions will not be carried out in the camps or immediate vicinity.\r\nShould the camps in the General Government be situated in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the border, then the prisoners for special handling are to\r\nbe taken care of in former Soviet Russian Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Commands are to keep records of the fulfillment of special\r\nhandlings; which must include:\r\n\r\n  Serial number\r\n  Family and Surname\r\n  Date of birth and place\r\n  Military rank\r\n  Profession\r\n  Last residence\r\n  Reason for special handling\r\n  Day and place of special handling\r\n\r\n  Office IV\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECRET STATE MATTER\r\n\r\nSupplement to the Directives for the Commands of the Security Police\r\nand Security Service assigned to P.W. camps\r\n\r\n1. In the directives of the 17th July 1941, I have repeatedly pointed\r\nto the fact that it is the duty of the Special Purpose Command of the\r\nSecurity Police and Security Service to find not only the untrustworthy\r\nbut also those trustworthy elements in general which can come into\r\nconsideration for the reconstruction of the Eastern provinces.\r\n\r\n_I reemphasize that one duty is as important as the other._\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a most extensive view of the co-activity of the\r\nSpecial Purpose Command, I order that the numeral 4 (number of those\r\npersons found to be trustworthy) will be especially heeded in the\r\nweekly reports.\r\n\r\nThe war prisoners who are found to be trustworthy and who were formerly\r\nin leading positions in the Soviet Russian economic circles, are to be\r\nlisted, if possible, according to branch their last employment, and by\r\nname.\r\n\r\n2. I reemphasize again the fact that in view of the pending decisions,\r\nconsideration must especially be given to the peoples' citizenship.\r\n\r\nUkrainians, White Russians, Aserbeidschanians, Armenians, North\r\nCaucasians, Georgians, Turks are only to be designated as definitely\r\nuntrustworthy and dealt with according to the directive when they\r\nare definitely proven to be Bolshevists, Polit-Commissars, or other\r\ndangerous functionaries.\r\n\r\nOne must be careful, in as much as the Turkish people frequently have a\r\nJewish appearance and the circumcision alone does not denote a Jewish\r\ndescent (for example, Mohammedans).\r\n\r\n3. The conception \"highbrow\" [Intelligenzler] should not be interpreted\r\nalong European viewpoints.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, most primitive Soviet-Russian illiterate can, in his\r\npolitical fanaticism, be more dangerous than, for instance, the\r\nSoviet-Russian engineer, who due to his ability, went to High School,\r\neven though, he only outwardly appeared to be in accord with the\r\nBolshevistic system.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the highbrow are mainly the professional\r\nrevolutionists, writers, editors, and persons in the Comintern.\r\n\r\n4. Those Soviet Russians who are definitely found to be untrustworthy\r\nare to be forthwith reported--as designated in the directives of\r\nthe 17th July 1941. Following the introduction of the execution\r\nauthorization, further fulfillment of the designated measures are to\r\nbegin _without further delay_.\r\n\r\nA further custody in the camps in question are to be avoided for\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n\r\nFinally I reemphasize that under no circumstances are the executions to\r\nbe carried out either in the Camp or in the near vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt is self-understood that these executions are not public. It is a\r\nmatter of principle not to admit spectators.\r\n\r\n5. I again charge the leaders and members of the Special Service Staff\r\nwith the following: exemplary behavior during and after duty hours, top\r\ncooperation with camp commanders and careful checking of work.\r\n\r\n  signed: Heydrich\r\n  (S)\r\n\r\n  Verified:\r\n  signed: Wolfert, Member of the Chancellory\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 081-PS\r\n\r\n[TOP SECRET]\r\n\r\n  28 February 1942\r\n\r\n  1/1 /41 g.Ks\r\n\r\n To the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces [OKW]\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 35, Tirpitzufer 72-76\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of its existence, the Reich Ministry for the\r\noccupied Eastern territories has taken the viewpoint, that the large\r\nnumber of Soviet prisoners of war constitute a highly valuable material\r\nfor propaganda. The treatment of Soviet prisoners of war must be\r\nconsidered differently than the treatment of prisoners of war of other\r\nnations, for various reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The war in the East has not been concluded, and the treatment\r\nof the prisoners of war must have far-reaching results on the\r\nwill-to-desert of the Red Army man who is still fighting.\r\n\r\n2. Germany intends to keep a large part of the former Soviet Union\r\noccupied, even after the end of the war, and to develop it industrially\r\nfor her purposes. Therefore she depends on a far-reaching cooperation\r\nof the population.\r\n\r\n3. Germany is conducting the fight against the Soviet Union because of\r\nideological viewpoints. Bolshevism must be overthrown and something\r\nbetter must be put in its place. Even the prisoners of war themselves\r\nmust realize that national socialism is willing and in the position to\r\nbring them a better future. They must return later to their homes from\r\nGermany with a feeling of admiration and esteem for Germany and German\r\ninstitutions; and thus become propagandists for the cause of Germany\r\nand national socialism.\r\n\r\nThis attempted goal has not been attained so far. The fate of the\r\nSoviet prisoners of war in Germany is on the contrary a tragedy of the\r\ngreatest extent. Of 3.6 millions of prisoners of war, only several\r\nhundred thousand are still able to work fully. A large part of them\r\nhas starved, or died, because of the hazards of the weather. Thousands\r\nalso died from spotted fever. It is understood, of course, that there\r\nare difficulties encountered in the feeding of such a large number\r\nof prisoners of war. Anyhow, with a certain amount of understanding\r\nfor goals aimed at by German politics, dying and deterioration could\r\nhave been avoided in the extent described. For instance, according to\r\ninformation on hand, the native population within the Soviet Union are\r\nabsolutely willing to put food at the disposal of the prisoners of\r\nwar. Several understanding camp commanders have successfully chosen\r\nthis course. However in the majority of the cases, the camp commanders\r\nhave forbidden the civilian population to put food at the disposal of\r\nthe prisoners, and they have rather let them starve to death. Even on\r\nthe march to the camps, the civilian population was not allowed to\r\ngive the prisoners of war food. In many cases, when prisoners of war\r\ncould no longer keep up on the march because of hunger and exhaustion,\r\nthey were shot before the eyes of the horrified civilian population,\r\nand the corpses were left. In numerous camps, no shelter for the\r\nprisoners of war was provided at all. They lay under the open sky\r\nduring rain or snow. Even tools were not made available to dig holes\r\nor caves. A systematic delousing of the prisoners of war in the camps\r\nand of the camps themselves has apparently been missed. Utterances\r\nsuch as these have been heard: \"The more of these prisoners die, the\r\nbetter it is for us\". The consequence of this treatment is now this,\r\nthat spotted fever is spreading due to the escape and discharge of\r\nprisoners and has claimed its victims among the armed forces as well\r\nas among the civilian population, even in the old part of Germany.\r\nFinally, the shooting of prisoners of war must be mentioned; these were\r\npartly carried out according to viewpoints which ignore all political\r\nunderstanding. For instance, in various camps, all the \"Asiatics\" were\r\nshot, although the inhabitants of the areas, considered belonging\r\nto Asia, of Transcaucasia and Turkestan especially, are among those\r\npeople in the Soviet Union who are most strongly opposed to Russian\r\nsubjugation and to Bolshevism. The Reich ministry of the occupied\r\nEastern territories has repeatedly emphasized these abuses. However, in\r\nNovember for instance, a detail [Kommando] appeared in a prisoner of\r\nwar camp in Nikolajew, which wanted to liquidate all Asiatics.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of prisoners of war appears to be founded for a great\r\npart on serious misconceptions about the people of the Soviet Union.\r\nOne finds the opinion that the people become more inferior the further\r\none goes East. If the Poles already were given harsh treatment, one\r\nargues, it should therefore be done to a much greater extent to the\r\nUkrainians, White Ruthenians, Russians, and finally the \"Asiatics\".\r\n\r\nIt was apparently completely ignored, in the treatment of prisoners\r\nof war, that Germany found, in contrast to the West (France, Belgium,\r\nthe Netherlands, Norway), a people who went through all the terror of\r\nBolshevism, and who now, happy about their liberation, put themselves\r\nwillingly at the disposal of Germany. A better gift could not come to\r\nGermany in this war, which requires every last man. But instead of\r\naccepting this gift, the people of the East are being treated more\r\ncontemptibly and worse than the people of the West, who do not hide\r\ntheir enmity towards Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was a basic mistake that no difference was made between real\r\nprisoners of war and deserters. It is known that German propaganda\r\ndeposited millions of leaflets beyond the lines, and encouraged the\r\nRed soldiers to desert, whereby good treatment and sufficient food\r\nwas specifically assured to them. These promises were not kept. The\r\ndeserters were beaten and left to starve the same as so many prisoners\r\nof war. A natural consequence of this politically and militarily unwise\r\ntreatment was not only a paralyzing of the will to desert, but a plain\r\ndeadly fear to get into German captivity. It would be naive to assume\r\nthat the occurences in the prisoner of war camps could be kept hidden\r\nfrom the Soviet government. As can be seen in Molotov's circular,\r\nthe Soviets have in fact an excellent knowledge of the conditions\r\ndescribed above, and naturally they have done everything in their power\r\nto influence the Soviet population and Red soldiers accordingly. It\r\ncan be said without exaggeration that the mistakes in the treatment of\r\nprisoners of war are to a great extent the cause for the stiffening\r\npower of resistance of the Red Army, and therefore also cause for the\r\ndeath of thousands of German soldiers.\r\n\r\nAfter the Reich ministry for occupied Eastern territories was finally\r\nsuccessful in overcoming the prejudice against Soviet prisoners of war\r\npartially, and when the prisoners of war were to come to Germany to a\r\ngreat extent for work, it was found that of 3.6 million only several\r\nhundred thousand were still able to work. Thus, German economy and\r\narmament industry also must suffer for the treatment of prisoners of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe above explanations are not intended to be a belated, fruitless\r\ncriticism, nor are they directed against any official agency,\r\nespecially since very many objective situations came into play, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, and the responsibility is shared. They should only\r\nbecome the basis for a new policy toward the prisoners of war which\r\ncorresponds more to our military and civilian interests. The Reich\r\nministry for the occupied Eastern territories is endeavoring with all\r\nits powers to assist the fighting troops by effective propaganda for\r\nthe deterioration of the enemy's military forces. All propaganda will\r\nbe useless, however, if there is more fear of captivity than of death\r\nand wounds on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe primary demand is that the treatment of the prisoners of war ensues\r\naccording to the laws of humanity and according to the dignity of the\r\nGerman nation. It is understandable that inhuman treatment, proven\r\nmany times, of German prisoners of war, by members of the Red Army\r\nhas embittered the German troops so much that they retaliate with the\r\nsame treatment. However, such retaliatory measures do not improve the\r\nsituation of German prisoners of war by any means, but must have as\r\ntheir last consequence the fact that neither side will take any more\r\nprisoners, thus that they conduct the war in a most inhuman manner.\r\nAt any rate, as much as is known, such retaliatory measures have not\r\nbeen able up to now to cause the enemy to change. They were therefore\r\nwithout purpose.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sufficient food, and at least primitive shelter, are to\r\nbe provided for the prisoners within the framework of possibility. In\r\nthe camps for prisoners, scheduled for work projects, as well as in\r\nthose for the others, skillful propaganda is necessary, which must\r\nbe carried out by camp newspapers, movies, lectures, simple musical\r\nevents, games, etc.\r\n\r\nEvery camp commandant must be made responsible that every prisoner of\r\nwar, guarded by him, will return to his home later on as a propagandist\r\nfor Germany. Of course, on the other side, action must be taken with\r\nutmost severity against possible agitators. In any case, in the future\r\na difference must be made between real prisoners of war and deserters.\r\nThe deserters are to be provided with identification certificates,\r\nand in any case are to be treated better than the prisoners of war.\r\nEspecially this measure should have far-reaching success in reference\r\nto the deterioration of the Red Army.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate an expression of opinion soon, and information of\r\nappropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 084-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin NW 7, The 30 Sept.\r\n  Hegelplatz 2\r\n\r\n _Central Office [Zentralstelle] for Members of Eastern Nationals._ In\r\n (ZO)\r\n\r\n _Concerning_: Present Status of the question of Eastern Laborers.\r\n\r\nThe _commitment_ and _treatment_ of foreign laborers, who have been\r\nbrought into the Reich from occupied Eastern territories, depicts a\r\nproceeding which will not only be of significant importance to the\r\nGerman war production and the securing of food, but also for the\r\ncarrying out of German administrative interests in a former Soviet\r\narea. Two large fields of action are affected by the way in which the\r\nproblems connected with the inclusion of millions of Eastern nationals\r\nin the Reich are solved: 1. Development of the _war situation_. 2. The\r\nenforcement of the German _claim to leadership in the East after the\r\nwar_.\r\n\r\nWhen the call for labor in Germany was increased in January, 1942 among\r\nthe occupied Eastern territories, this set up a situation among those\r\nclasses of Russian and Ukrainian civilians concerned which had by all\r\nmeans the appearance of a risk. Even if one group (the volunteers) set\r\nexcessive hopes on the journey into the Reich under the impression of\r\nirresponsible promises while the other (forced laborers) left their\r\nhomes reluctantly or at least with misgivings because of memories of\r\nformer Bolshevist deportations as well as planted anti-German rumors,\r\nthe fact remains that the trip to Germany had to be felt as _journey\r\ninto the unknown_ not only by the two concerned but also by those\r\nrelatives who remained behind because of the isolation of the USSR\r\nfrom Europe for decades. The public judgment of the Reich and its\r\nleadership would be dependent upon the outcome of this measure taken by\r\nthe German military and civilian authorities in the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories. The employment in Germany offered an unusual opportunity\r\nto learn to know by personal experience, which no propaganda could\r\nreplace. The greater German Reich was much slandered by the Soviet\r\npress, and the National Socialistic position to the working class and\r\nthus to gain a basis of comparison to the corresponding Communistic\r\ndoctrines and methods. This meant no more nor less, than that the\r\ndraft of Eastern laborers would be of importance in the development\r\nof political opinions among the Eastern nationals towards the power\r\nwhich was presently occupying the region which would aid measures taken\r\nto accomplish the recruitment, the housing etc., in the Reich, which\r\nshould have been taken into consideration _from the start_, since in\r\nview of the necessity to keep the aid of the native inhabitants in\r\nthe huge areas behind the front, factors which cannot be controlled\r\nby regulations or orders, namely the _frame of mind_, which is of war\r\npotential value, must be considered.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking consideration of this, the drafting and the\r\nemployment as well as the housing, treatment etc. of the so-called\r\nEastern laborers has so far been taken care of exclusively according\r\nto labor, technical and the security police points of view, with the\r\nresult that the headquarters responsible for this were able to report\r\nthe due numerical fulfilment of the program as well as the security of\r\nthe German nationality and of the businesses. At the time, however,\r\nfacts had to be hushed which could have been avoided not only in the\r\ninterests of German prestige and to the satisfaction of the occupied\r\nEastern territories but which even today cost the lives of thousands\r\nof German soldiers by their efforts. The facts which up to the fall of\r\n1942, have undergone only part or incomplete changes, among others, the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n1. The _concept_ of the workers from the occupied territories of the\r\nUSSR was narrowed down to the labor- and social-legal term \"Eastern\r\nLaborers\". A labor condition among \"Foreigners\" was hereby created in a\r\nsegregated \"Employment under Special Conditions\" which had to be looked\r\nupon by those affected, as degrading.\r\n\r\n2. _The drafting of Eastern_ workers and women workers often\r\noccurred without the necessary examination of the capabilities of\r\nthose concerned, so that 5-10 out of a hundred, sick and children,\r\nwere transported along. On the other hand, in those places where no\r\nvolunteers were obtained, instead of using the lawful employment\r\nobligations, coercive measures were used by the police (imprisonment,\r\npenal expedition, and similar measures.)\r\n\r\n3. _The employment_ in businesses was not undertaken by considering the\r\noccupation and previous training but according to the chance assignment\r\nof the individual to the respective transports or transient camps.\r\n\r\n4. _The billeting_ did not follow the policies according to which the\r\nother foreigners are governed, but just as for civilian prisoners in\r\ncamps which were fenced in with barbed wire and were heavily guarded,\r\nfrom which no exit was permitted.\r\n\r\n5. _The treatment_ by the guards was on the average without\r\nintelligence and cruel so that the Russian and Ukrainian workers, in\r\nenterprises with foreign laborers of different nationalities, were\r\nexposed to the scorn of the Poles and the Czechs among other things.\r\n\r\n6. _The food and care_ was so bad and insufficient in the camps for the\r\nEastern Laborers being employed in the industry and in the mines that\r\nthe good average capability of the camp members dropped down shortly\r\nand many sicknesses and deaths took place.\r\n\r\n7. _Payment_ was carried out in the form of a ruling in which the\r\nindustrial worker would keep on the average 2 or 3 RM each week and the\r\nfarm laborers even less, so that the transfer of pay to their homes\r\nbecame illusory, not to mention the fact there had been no satisfactory\r\nprocedure developed for this.\r\n\r\n8. The _postal service_ with their families was not feasible for months\r\nbecause of the lack of a precautionary ruling; so that instead of\r\nfactual reports, wild rumors arrived in their countries,--among other\r\nmeans by means of emigration.\r\n\r\n9. _The promises_ which had been made time and time again in the areas\r\nof enlistment stood in contradiction with those facts mentioned under\r\n3-8.\r\n\r\nApart from the natural impairment of the frame of mind and capabilities\r\nwhich these measures, as well as conditions, brought with them, the\r\nresult was that the _Soviet propaganda_ took over the matter and\r\nevaluated it carefully. Not only the actual conditions and the letters\r\nwhich reached the country, in spite of the initial blockade, as well as\r\nthe stories of fugitives and such, but also the clumsy publications in\r\nthe German press of the legal rulings relative to the matter gave them\r\nenough to manipulate with. Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in his\r\n_note_ to the enemy powers referred already in April 1942 to this,\r\nespecially in para. III of this document in which among others it is\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n \"The German administration is treading under its feet the long\r\n recognized laws and customs governing war, in that it has given the\r\n orders to the troops to take into captivity all male civilians and in\r\n many places even the women, and to use against them those measures\r\n which the Hitlerites have introduced towards prisoners of war. This\r\n does not only mean _slave labor_ for the captured peaceful inhabitants\r\n but in most cases it also means inescapable starvation or death\r\n through sickness, corporal punishments, and organized mass murders.\r\n\r\n \"The deportation of peaceful inhabitants to the rear, which has been\r\n widely practiced by the German-Fascist army, begins to take on a mass\r\n character. It is carried out under direct rulings of the German High\r\n Command (OKW) and its effects are especially cruel in the immediate\r\n rear areas during a retreat of the German army. In a series of\r\n documents, which have been found with the staffs of destroyed German\r\n units, there is a directive to the order of the High-Command under\r\n Nlr. 2974/41 of 6 Dec. 1942 which directs that all grown men are to be\r\n deported from occupied populated points into prisoner of war camps.\r\n From the order to the 37th Infantry Regiment of the 6th Division of\r\n 2 Dec. 1941 under the heading \"About the deportation of the Civilian\r\n Population\" it can be deduced that for the period from the 4 to the 12\r\n Dec the _capture and forceful deportation of the total population_ of\r\n 7 villages to the German rear areas was planned, for which a carefully\r\n worked out plan was proposed.\r\n\r\n \"Sometimes all the inhabitants were deported, sometimes the men were\r\n torn away from their families or mothers were separated from their\r\n children. Only the smallest number of these deported people have been\r\n able to return to their home village. _These returnees report terrible\r\n degradations, heaviest forced labor, abundant deaths among inhabitants\r\n because of starvation and tortures, and murder by the Fascists of all\r\n the weak, wounded, and sick._\"\r\n\r\nFurther, there are even today announcements in the Soviet newspapers as\r\nwell as radio about the treatment of Eastern laborers which might have\r\nas an effect a strengthening of the moral power to resist in the Red\r\nArmy. Further, there is mentioned the text of a letter which arrived\r\nin Ordshonikidsegrad from a Russian girl and which was published in\r\na \"_Proclamation_\" of the police administration of the North-Western\r\nFront of the Red army under the heading of \"A Russian Girl in Cologne\",\r\nattaching in connection with it an effective propaganda viewpoint about\r\nthe \"Fascist Forced Laborers\" in Germany.\r\n\r\n \"Do you know\"--, it goes on at the end of the proclamation,--\"that\r\n every one of us who goes to Germany will meet the same fate as Olga\r\n Selesnewa! Do not forget that the German monster will make each\r\n and every one of you, who has remained behind, a slave on your own\r\n soil or drag you to eternal _forced labor_ in Germany! Dear brothers\r\n and sisters ... Go to the partisan detachments! Injure the German\r\n occupants at every step. Hit the Hitler thieves everywhere and\r\n continuously. The Russian soil shall become their graves!\"\r\n\r\nThe effects of this large scale documentary proven radio-press-and\r\nleaflet propaganda, operating even into German administered\r\nterritories, must be considered as one of the main reasons for this\r\nyear's stiffening of the Soviet resistance as well as the threatening\r\nincrease of guerilla bands up to the borders of the General Government.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, after a _betterment of the condition of the Eastern\r\nlaborers_ had been insisted upon, not only by the main office for\r\npolitics in the Reichs ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories,\r\nwhich has been able to find support in the repeated requests by the\r\nHigh Command of the Armed Forces, but also by the gentleman charged\r\nwith the responsibility for all labor employment as well as the\r\nDepartment of Labor Employment in the German Labor Movement, which has\r\nthe supervision of the Eastern Laborers--those previously existing\r\nlegal and police rulings have been mitigated and the conditions in\r\nthe 8-10,000 camps in the Reich have, on the whole, been improved.\r\nThus those fixed wages, which have been determined by the tables of\r\ncompensation in a ruling of the Council of Ministers, upon which\r\ndeductions were made up to 75%, have been replaced by new tariffs.\r\nThe Eastern Laborers were left free of duty according to it, and the\r\ntaxes were paid in a form of an Eastern Laborer Tax by the owner of\r\nthe enterprise (Ruling of Council of Ministers for the Defense of the\r\nReich of 30/6/42). Thus after many months of negotiations, with the\r\ncooperation of the Central Economic Bank in Rowno, a salary transfer,\r\nin the form of a savings stamp procedure, was regulated. Thus, the\r\nruling of the Reichs Chief of the SS of 20/2/42 prescribing barbed\r\nwire has been dropped by a supplementary ruling of 9/4/42 and at the\r\nsame time, in exceptional cases, groups were permitted to go out\r\nunder German guards, of late, it has even been permitted under their\r\nown supervision. The food supply was adjusted by a special delivery\r\nletter of the Reichs Food minister dated 17/4/42, to a degree where the\r\n\"Soviet Civilian Laborer\", as well as the prisoners of war received a\r\nuniform ration. This was still not enough compared to the normal amount\r\nof food given to those employed in the industry and in the mines,\r\nbesides it was still much less and worse than that for the Poles, but\r\nit was an improvement compared to former conditions. Furthermore the\r\npostal communication has been adjusted for those Eastern Laborers who\r\ncome from the civilian administered as well as those who are from the\r\nregions directly to the rear of the army,--at least theoretically--.\r\nOn account of the burden placed on the censorship office for foreign\r\ncountries the High Command of the Armed Forces has recently asked again\r\nfor a reduction of this measure.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the improvements mentioned as well as others, which in\r\nmany cases can be traced back to the personal intervention of the\r\nDeputy General of Labor Employment, the total situation of the Eastern\r\nLaborer (sampling date: 1 October 1942) must still be considered\r\n_unsatisfactory_, namely, not only in respect to the differences\r\nin the treatment of industrial workers and farm laborers but in\r\nthe differences found in the different States and enterprises. On\r\nthe average there are still about 40% of the lodgings for Eastern\r\nlaborers which would not meet the requirements even if all the wartime\r\nrestrictions were considered. Among these are a frightening number\r\nof camps whose conditions are such as to destroy the success of the\r\nattempt of improving relationship and the corresponding radiating\r\nuplift of the morale within the Eastern territories. Not even to\r\nmention the fact that the marking OST (East), an identification\r\nordered by the police, is being felt as degrading there remains such a\r\n_quantity of grievances and problems_ that it would be impossible to\r\nrelate them now. Only the following points are to be mentioned:\r\n\r\n1. _The Enlisting and Employing of persons of German Parentage,\r\nas Eastern laborers._ Several observations made by the commission\r\nfrom the central office to inspect camps, as well as petitions\r\nwhich have reached them, show that persons of German parentage were\r\nenlisted,--against regulations,--as Eastern Laborers. Even if they\r\nare not recognized people of German parentage according to the\r\n\"RKFestigung\", they are, however persons of German descent and with\r\nGerman names, as Mr. Middelhauve could establish in a camp near Berlin.\r\nIt is to be doubted that the branch offices of the sub-office for\r\nGermans living in foreign countries had enough qualified help who could\r\nseparate these persons capable of becoming Germans again.\r\n\r\n2. _Enlisting and Employing as Eastern Laborers of Tartars from the\r\nCrimea._ To increase the fighting numbers of the Tartar legions it\r\nwould be indispensable to return all those Tartars, who have been\r\nemployed in the Reich as Eastern Laborers, to their homes before the\r\ncoming of winter; a similar report to the \"GBA\" is being prepared.\r\nBesides climatic reasons, the necessity for this return is to intensify\r\nthe wine and tobacco growths in the Crimea by experienced help and\r\nat the same time, to prevent the invasion of Greek and Bulgarian\r\nplanters and traders. To prepare this return as well as to deal with\r\nother Tartan problems a commissioner, namely a Crimean Tartar, has\r\nbeen installed by the \"ZO\". In the meantime, difficulties have arisen\r\nbecause of the effect of the furloughing of Tartan Eastern Laborers for\r\nparticipation in the Mohammedan festival during the 4th and 5/10/42 as\r\nwell as the procurement of the meat and millet supply needed for this\r\noccasion. The authority in these and similar matters will have to be\r\nvoiced, at the time of their return, by those White Ruthanian Tartars\r\nwho have been selected for resettlement.\r\n\r\n3. _Enlisting and Employing as Eastern Laborers of Ukrainians from\r\nTransnistrian._ During an inspection of the camps for munition workers\r\nat Topchin (Kreteltow) into which the Central Office was induced\r\nbecause of an escape which became known to them, it was found that\r\nthe Eastern Laborers employed there were enlisted January 1942 in\r\nOdessa. They do not come according to para. I of the Rulings of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers dated 30/6/42, under the category of Eastern\r\nLaborers. But will have to be termed, because of the fact that the\r\nState of \"Transnistrian\" was placed in the Fall of 1941 under Rumanian\r\nsovereignty, as stateless members of the Kingdom of Rumania. To clarify\r\nthis point for all times, negotiations have been made with the GBA and\r\nthe Foreign Office as well as the Feldzeuginspektion of the Office for\r\nGeneral Affairs in the High-Command of the Army.\r\n\r\n4. _Employment of Skilled Laborers in Occupations foreign to their\r\nskills._ Up until recently petitions have continually come to the\r\npublishers of camp newspapers to the Reichs Ministry for the occupied\r\nEastern territories, to the German Workers Front and in error also to\r\nthe bureau for foreign nationals in the Reich from Eastern laborers,\r\nmen and women who are in occupations foreign to their skills or\r\ninferior to their skills, without the transfer proposals, which were\r\napproved by the central office as well as by other offices, having led\r\nto success--except in rare cases. Gauleiter Sauckel, who has repeatedly\r\ndisclosed--the last time at the conference in Weimar on the 10 and\r\n11/9/42--that the \"inner arrangement\" of the occupational employment\r\nwould be his next point on the program, does not seem to be informed\r\nabout the real conditions in which doctors, engineers, teachers,\r\nqualified skilled laborers and such are employed as unskilled workers,\r\nmechanics as farmers, and farmers as industrial workers. In any case,\r\none of his close associates, the Gauamtsleiter Orr Escher received the\r\ninformation about this which was given him by Dr. Thiell, in accordance\r\nwith instructions of the Central Office, with unusual interest.\r\n\r\n5. _Separation in employment of members of one Family._ The repeated\r\nseparation of family members who have come to the Reich as Eastern\r\nLaborers and Eastern Women Workers (married couples, parents, brothers\r\nand sisters, and children) seems utterly contrary to the usual customs\r\ngoverning other employments of foreigners. The bringing together of\r\nthose relatives who have been mistakenly separated during the transport\r\nis principally desired just as much as is the employment of family\r\nmembers in the same location. It does however, in practice, encounter\r\nsome difficulties. In order to make possible at least the transfer of\r\ninformation from both parties, the Reichs Ministry for the occupied\r\nEastern territories in August 1942, in conjunction with the Reich Main\r\noffice and Reich Security Service has allowed the limited publication\r\nof encoded advertisements seeking information. Besides this an\r\nagreement has been made in September 1942 between the Central Office\r\nand the German Red Cross in accordance with which this organization\r\nwill take over the communication between these Eastern Laborers\r\nseparated in the Reich, keeping the place of employment secret however.\r\n\r\n6. _Disregarding the Nationality in Employment and Billeting._ The\r\nplan of the Herr Reichsmarshall to create special \"Enterprises for\r\nthe Russians\" could not be accomplished as yet on account of reasons\r\nof wartime economy. The demands for a joint employment by the members\r\nof Eastern nationalities, according to their racial background could\r\nnot be carried out in practice to any great degree. In addition to\r\nthe reasons of business, the usual variegated composition of the\r\ntransports coming from the great realms of the Reichs Commissariate\r\nUkraine opposed it. Basically, a regrouping to racial membership might\r\nbe possible after completion of an examination of this membership which\r\nwould have to be made in conjunction with the issuance of employment\r\npermits for Eastern Laborers, especially when a group of foremen has\r\nbeen found among the Eastern Laborers based on partial pre-training\r\nindependently of the solution to this question, the commissions from\r\nthe Central Office will be striving to effect a rough sifting of the\r\ncamps according to racial membership, and to house them accordingly in\r\nspecial barracks. The supplying of experienced interpreters for this\r\njob and then systematic instruction has been begun.\r\n\r\n7. _Distinctive, Mostly Insufficient Food Rations._ The inadequate\r\nfood ration for Eastern Laborers is important not only in the matter\r\nof performance but also politically, since the majority of the help\r\ncoming from the occupied Eastern territories were previously accustomed\r\nto better rations. After using up all the food supplies which had\r\nbeen brought along, a general lowering of the ability to work and of\r\nthe morale was noticeable. The written request to the Herr Reichs\r\nFood-Minister on the matter, to examine the food quotas in respect\r\nto the fact that the Eastern Laborer was in a worse position in the\r\nmatter of nourishment than the Poles, was answered by a telephone\r\ncommunication from the respective Chief of Section, that to his\r\nknowledge the Russians were better off than the Poles. With this\r\nignorance of the condition decisive measures could hardly be expected\r\non the part of the Reichs Food Ministry. Nevertheless Gauleiter\r\nSauckel has declared, in Weimar as a part of his program, that the\r\nfeeding of the German as well as the foreign laborer inside of Germany\r\nwould be shortly adapted to the requirements in accordance with their\r\nperformance--here he supported his program on an utterance of the\r\nFuehrer--. In connection with this a conference took place in the\r\nReichs Food Ministry on 29/9/42 in which an improved food quota of the\r\nEastern Laborer was decided upon. The decree which is being co-signed\r\nby the High Command of the Armed Forces and the GBA, [?] upon which the\r\n\"Special Delivery Letter\" of the 17/4/42 will be nullified, provides\r\nfor laborers of all types an additional 1750 grams of potatoes, for\r\nworkers in heavy industry and additional 200 grams, and for the group,\r\nto be newly instituted, of \"overtime\" and \"night\" workers a weekly 2600\r\ngrams of bread, 300 of meat, and 150 of fat. Besides this, instead of\r\nthe tasteless bread made of turnips the usual kind will be delivered\r\nin the future. Even though a complete equality of food rationing with\r\nthe other foreigners should be aspired to, this new measure, whose\r\nenforcement is imminent, will counteract the intestinal diseases and\r\nswelling of the stomach, as well as the sending of bread from relatives\r\nin the Ukraine, which can not be hindered on political grounds.\r\n\r\n8. _Partly insufficient, and Unjust Payment of Wages._ The wage\r\nadjustments for Eastern laborers and Eastern women workers must still\r\nbe considered unsatisfactory even after the new wage scales, by the\r\nruling of the Council of Ministers dated 30/6/42, as well as the lower\r\nevaluation of those agricultural workers who are quartered and fed\r\nfree. The determining factor in keeping the net salary down is the\r\nnecessity even today of maintaining the natural lower social level\r\nas compared to the German laborer, and to protect the German produce\r\nmarket as well as--in the case of transfer accounts--the enterprises\r\nin the domain of the Reichs Commissariat from an accumulation of\r\nsurplus purchasing power. The Central Office took the viewpoint, in\r\nthe conferences concerned with this matter, that it is far better to\r\nkeep the wage level, as such, down than later to lower a nominally\r\nhigher net salary to about half by means of the forced savings plan,\r\nreportedly proposed by the Reichs Finance Minister. The change of\r\nthe hourly pay scale, as well as pay on contracts and pay by means\r\nof premiums is therefore closely connected with the success of the\r\nvoluntary stamp savings plan, which was installed in September 1942.\r\nThis on the other hand will depend upon the fact that the saved amount,\r\nwhich has been sent to the respective home banks of the relatives in\r\nthe form of savings books--a system which has finally been introduced\r\nby the Herr Reichs Commissar for the Ukraine--will at least be\r\nredeemable in cash to half of the amount shown, even if no interest is\r\npaid on it at the time. A change in the question of wages, considering\r\nthat this is the first time in bank technological procedure that\r\nsavings and transfer accounts have been joined together, would have\r\nprospects only if an eventual rearrangement does not materially raise\r\nthe total wage increase of Eastern Laborers. A throttling measure would\r\notherwise be necessary eventually which would shatter the trust in\r\nthe honesty of the German social methods and would give irresponsible\r\nmaterial to the Soviet propaganda. A way to correctness in the matter\r\nof pay within the limitations determined by this viewpoint, could be\r\nseen in the proposal of the Reichs Trustee Dr. Kimmich, who expounded\r\nit in a short report in Weimar on 11/9/42. In accordance with this a\r\nplan for arranging salaries should be carried out by the industries\r\nby inserting increasing measures for part time, apprenticeship,\r\nand instructional work, to bring into prominence the principle of\r\npay according to performance even in the occupied territories. The\r\nfoundation for the pay scale based on this will be the evaluation\r\naccording to eight categories of difficulty in the performance of\r\nwork, the use of which would exclude the evaluation of previous\r\npreparatory training (in the judging of differences) in favor of the\r\nsuccess in performance. The complete stoppage of wages would thereby\r\nbe abolished with finality and the offering of work premiums be made\r\npossible to foreign laborers. This,--as Dr. Kimmich characterizes\r\nit,--\"Re-establishment of a just salary and contract\" will have as\r\nan effect a general increase in performance which will be advertised\r\nas \"The thanks of the German laborer to the combat soldier.\" Should\r\nthese principles shortly be made obligatory in all the states, this\r\nwould also bring, in connection with the measures of the project\r\nof occupational instruction, an improvement to the former Soviet\r\nspecialist without having impaired the pre-eminence of the German\r\nspecialist. The safeguarding of the superiority of the latter is in\r\nspite of the wartime needs among other things thereby guaranteed by\r\nthe fact that the Herr Reichs Minister for armament and ammunition has\r\nbeen able to carry out through the High Command of the Armed Forces on\r\nSeptember 1942, that these 500,000 German war industrial workers, who\r\nare going to be inducted during the winter half year, will only receive\r\nan eight week training, after that they will, however, be returned to\r\ntheir key-positions in the plants. How far the coming change of wage\r\nstructure will affect not only the leading position of the German\r\nspecialist as opposed to the Eastern Laborer but also the relationship\r\nbetween these and the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian workers is not\r\nto be seen in advance without further information. First of all, the\r\nHerr Reichs Minister of Finance will examine at the instigation of the\r\nReichs Minister for the occupied Eastern Territories, if and in how far\r\nthe increase of the so-called \"Salary Equalizing Tax\" as an addition to\r\nthe Income Tax on the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian in the Reich in\r\nspite of the low rate of 15% will in many cases place them worse off\r\nthan comparable Eastern Laborers. This would be all the less tolerable\r\nas the employment of Eastern Laborers in the General Territory of\r\nEstonia leads up to the opposite problems.\r\n\r\n9. _Insufficient Equipping of clothes and shoes._ The clothing of\r\nalmost all Eastern Laborers, men and women, must be considered as\r\ninsufficient. Transports were arriving even in the last days of the\r\nmonth of September whose occupants did not carry any winter clothing\r\nwith them. The recruiting agents seem to leave the workers in the\r\nopinion that there is no winter in Germany and moreover, that the\r\nEastern Laborers would receive everything they need. In view of the\r\ncoming cold months and of the inadequacy of many quarters a catastrophe\r\nmust arise on account of the existing lack of clothing and shoes, if a\r\nsuccessful remedy is not found immediately. The main difficulties in\r\nthe supplying of missing equipment, which has already led in our large\r\nindustrial plant to the loss of 10% of its employees,--lies in the fact\r\nthat the clothing set aside from the collection of textile goods,\r\ndoes not even come close to covering the demand and that the available\r\nbooty as well as confiscated goods in occupied territories will not\r\nbe handed out by the competent management without the delivery of the\r\nexisting ration cards. Since the Eastern Laborer does not possess the\r\nlatter this could then only be carried out if the enterprises would\r\nrequisition the needed clothing for the German workers and would offer\r\nthose to the Eastern Laborers,--unfortunately however, deducting it\r\nfrom their wages from time to time. The sending of clothing, coats\r\nand shoes by the families of Eastern laborers by means of individual\r\nshipment can not be carried out without further directives on account\r\nof the necessity of delousing the garments at the border, wherefore a\r\nmeasure was proposed after previous negotiations of the Central office\r\nwith the deputy of the Generalarbeitsfuehrer Kretschman at the GBA\r\nunder the direction of the Reichs Ministry for the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories; in accordance with this measure collective addresses will\r\nbe sent to the occupied territories by the enterprises in collaboration\r\nwith the censorship office and special collection offices set up there.\r\nThe success of this action must remain in doubt at present. During the\r\nmeeting in Weimar it was then announced that from January 1943 on,\r\nuniform work clothes will be made of cellulose material which, however,\r\nwill not be of very good quality and would look baggy after a short\r\nwear. Independently of this creation of work clothes, which naturally\r\ncan not be considered a costume or uniform, the Central Office has made\r\nit one of its tasks to help with the action to provide clothes to help\r\ndecrease to a minimum the expected lowering of performance, loss of\r\nmorale, increased escapes, and cases of freezing.\r\n\r\n10. _Insufficient Supervision of the Eastern Laborers Employed in\r\nAgriculture._ According to ruling No. 4 of the Deputy General for\r\nLabor of 7 May 1942, the supervision of those Eastern workers and\r\nwomen workers employed in agriculture is delegated to the Reichs Food\r\nAdministration. Practical supervision in the rural areas by the state,\r\nregional and local authorities of the Reichs Peasant Leader must be\r\nconsidered as illusory with respect to the lack of knowledge and to the\r\ninsufficient knowledge of these people as well as to the fact that the\r\nseizing of Eastern Laborers in the midst of all the foreign workers\r\nin the rural areas can only be carried out with difficulty. To inform\r\nat least the rural superintendent of the principles which govern the\r\ntreatment of the Eastern laborers, the publication department of the\r\nReichs Food Administration has, in accord with the Reichs Minister\r\nfor occupied Eastern territories sent out guiding instructions for\r\nthe present enlightenment campaign during the fall quarter. No\r\nobjections can so far be made against a strict observance of these\r\nguiding instructions since, on account of the shortage of labor in the\r\nrural areas during the past months, a pampering of the Eastern workers\r\nand women workers was noticed, which was not only a threat towards\r\nthe temporary transfer of 200,000 agricultural workers into industry\r\nbut also in respect to the damage of a lack of migration into other\r\nareas. To intensify the supervision in the rural enterprises, a policy\r\nforming meeting took place in August 1942 with the representatives of\r\nthe Reichs Food Administration during which among other things the\r\nsending of interpreters by the Reichs Ministry for the occupied Eastern\r\nTerritory to the Reichs Peasant leader was taken into consideration.\r\nSince the Reichs Food Administration was only willing to approve in the\r\nlatter part of September, the taking over of the payment of special\r\nsupervision with a knowledge of the language, in spite of exemption\r\nfrom payment of contributions on the part of Eastern laborers, and\r\nsince there is still at the present time no clear settlement of the\r\nnumber and conditions for this it will be necessary to balance the\r\nlack of activity of the Reichs Food Administration with an appropriate\r\ninitiative action on the part of the Central Office of the Reichs\r\nMinistry for the occupied Eastern territories.\r\n\r\n11. _Insufficient Recreation._ In spite of repeated efforts for a\r\nsatisfactory and meaningful organization of the recreation period for\r\nthe Eastern laborer the German Arbeitsfront has still not been able to\r\ncreate and carry out a satisfactory recreational program. While the\r\nenterprises have organized excursions in groups because of necessity,\r\nthe recreational program in the camps have so far lacked a uniform\r\noutline. The showing of moving pictures often runs into difficulties\r\nsince the theaters, which have been created for this purpose, are\r\nonly accessible to German workers and the Eastern laborer could not\r\nenter because of the danger of contamination of lice. The daily radio\r\nprogram in Russian and Ukrainian language which in the beginning was\r\nproposed by the Reichsminister of Enlightenment and Propaganda has\r\nstill not been carried out because of several reasons. The performance\r\nof several artists is only possible in exceptional cases among the\r\nEastern races because of the existing travel difficulties. What\r\ndrawbacks and difficulties are connected with this can be shown in the\r\ncircumstances under which a Ukrainian group of artists, who are now\r\nstationed in the Reich after an agreement was made between Gauleiter\r\nSauckel and the Commissioner General of Kiew, are performing. After\r\nthis group was barely sufficiently housed in an Eastern Labor Camp\r\nnear Halle for a period of two weeks, a meeting took place in the RAM\r\nin which it was decided upon a suggestion by the representative of\r\nthe Reichs Ministry, for the occupied Eastern territories, that the\r\nNational Socialistic Organization should send three organizational\r\ntrustees, the Reichs Ministry for Enlightenment and Propaganda three\r\npropaganda trustees, and the Reichs Ministry for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories three political trustees, to Halle. By the combined efforts\r\nof these trustees it was finally possible to employ the group of\r\nartists, who were made up of three separate groups, in several of the\r\ncentral German States [Gaue], during which the management, even in\r\norganizational matters, soon went to the member of the Eastern office\r\nwho was sent by the Central Office of the Reichs Minister for the\r\nOccupied Eastern territory. Until 30/9/42, on which day the Central\r\noffice in Berlin sponsored an afternoon reception for the 38 Ukrainian\r\nartists, the Reichs Minister for Enlightenment and Propaganda had still\r\nnot decided upon the amount of wages, which had accrued because of the\r\nperformances, still less who was to pay for it, so that a temporary\r\nsolution by using an agent who would carry out the bare essential down\r\npayment had to be found. Because of this lack of clarity, the wish of\r\nthe Deputy General for the Arbeitseinsatz to retain the group in the\r\nReich during the winter months can not be supported.\r\n\r\n12. _Return under Unworthy Conditions of Eastern laborers and women\r\nlaborers who are not fit for work._ The carelessness during the\r\nenlistment and reception of millions of Eastern laborers and women\r\nlaborers has resulted in the fact that,--according to a careful\r\nestimate,--about five percent of the persons transported into the\r\nReich have proved not to be capable of work. That means nothing less\r\nthan that about 80 to 100,000 returnees will stream into the occupied\r\nEastern territories in the coming days. The dangers included in this\r\nreturning process can be seen in the fact that this deals with sick,\r\ncrippled, mothers-to-be, as well as such persons whom the enterprises\r\nare glad to reject and who because of that are not being taken care of.\r\nThe mood of these returnees is temporarily forced to be anti-German,\r\nand nothing has been done, in spite of repeated suggestions in the\r\nReichs Labor Ministry to reconcile the returnees with at least a few\r\nfavorable impressions of Germany. During the latter part of September\r\n1942, a collecting camp in Berlin-Blankenfelde, which was quartered\r\nwith Eastern laborers who were destined for return, was inspected upon\r\nthe instigation of the Central Office by a commission consisting of\r\ndifferent authorities, at which time revolting conditions were met.\r\nAmong other things a shot was fired by the guard at an Eastern laborer\r\nwho was caring for his natural needs, without the President of the\r\nStates Employment Office who was present making any protest against\r\nit. All of the camp inmates gave an impression of neglect. Since the\r\nreturning of these 1600 persons as well as a further 4400 returnees\r\nfrom other camps, could not be reconciled politically with respect to\r\nthe danger of contaminating their native districts with reports of\r\nhorror, and since the postponement of a necessary re-quartering of\r\nthe collecting camps could no longer be provided (in the meantime)\r\nthe chief of the branch offices of the Central Police-Vice-counsel\r\nin retirement Miller--Dr. of Law Boywidt and Mrs. Miller were sent\r\nat the same time to Brest-Litowsk, to stop the transport at least at\r\nthis point and to carry out according to the situation a quarantining\r\nof the people or, belatedly to take care of them. How necessary this\r\ninterference was is shown by the fact that this train with returning\r\nlaborers had stopped at the same place where a train with newly\r\nrecruited Eastern laborers had stopped. Because of the corpses in\r\nthe trainload of returning laborers, a catastrophe might have been\r\nprecipitated had it not been for the mediation of Mrs. Miller. In this\r\ntrain women gave birth to babies who were thrown out of the windows\r\nduring the journey, people having tuberculosis and venereal diseases\r\nrode in the same car, dying people lay in freight cars without straw,\r\nand one of the dead was thrown on the railway embankment. The same must\r\nhave occurred in other returning transports. To end these terrible\r\nconditions, it is intended to create special transient camps in the\r\nReich area for returning workers where those who contracted diseases\r\nin the Reich will be separated from the chronically sick. They will be\r\nsent to an organization caring for the sick. Those finally chosen to\r\nreturn would receive medical and psychological treatment for at least\r\na week. The chief of the Reich health program and his chief of liaison\r\nwith the GBA, resp., have approved this central office plan of giving\r\naid to returning workers, which aid should also be extended during\r\ntransport. The directorate of the German Red Cross wants to share in\r\nthe execution of this plan by making available trained personnel, among\r\nother things. The first of these transient camps for returnees could be\r\nestablished at Bad Frankenhausen in Thuringia where, according to the\r\nstatement of the local mayor, suitable area is available.\r\n\r\nTo solve these and numerous other problems, as well as the removal of\r\nthe described difficulties and abuses, two things are advised.\r\n\r\nI. _Consultation of the Reich minister with the Fuehrer_ with the\r\npurpose of asking him for personal energetic intervention; this\r\nconference will have to include among others the following requests as\r\nlaid down in the note 1 f 5 of 6/7/42:\r\n\r\n1. _Treatment by the police._ The Fuehrer should beseech the Reichs\r\nLeader of the SS in a personal consultation, to repeal the General\r\nRegulations of 20/2/42 including the supplementary Decree of 9/4/42.\r\n_that is Section A of the General Regulations_.\r\n\r\nLaborers from the former Soviet Russian territory and to replace them\r\nand among other things with new regulations which are to be voted\r\nupon in conjunction with the GBA (2) and the Reichs Ministry for the\r\noccupied Eastern territory.\r\n\r\n2. _Direction of people._ The Fuehrer should direct the Chancellor of\r\nthe party as well as the Reich propaganda office of NSDAP to adjust\r\nsuitable urgent measures in agreement with the Reich Ministry M.G.A.B.\r\nand respectively with the Z.O. to enlighten those party members who\r\nare handling the supervision of the relations between Germans and\r\nforeigners about the scope of the employment of the Eastern laborers\r\nand furthermore to inform the entire German population of the political\r\nmission which history has bestowed upon them by the taking in of\r\nmillions of former Soviet citizens.\r\n\r\n3. _The competences of the R.M.fdBO._ The Fuehrer should inform the\r\nsupreme authorities of the Reich, if possible through the Reich\r\nMinister and the chief of the Reichs chancellory that not only those\r\nmeasures of theirs, which concern themselves with occupied Eastern\r\nterritories but also those that affect the labor from these territories\r\nemployed in the Reich may only be decided in every action with the\r\nReich ministry for the occupied Eastern territories.\r\n\r\nII. Further expansion of the General Office for member Races, so that\r\nan extended arm of the R.M.fdBO in the Reich and as a representative of\r\nthe foreign people from the occupied Eastern territories living here it\r\ncan quickly perceive its instructed interests. The following would be\r\nessential for this.\r\n\r\n(1) _Commitment of a special Commissioner._ The appointment of a\r\nspecial commissioner for the Reich ministries provided with specific\r\nauthority to take care of the interests of the central office, should\r\nserve especially two purposes; to take an active influence upon the\r\nhandling of enlistments inside the occupied eastern territories.\r\n\r\n(2) To carry out definite aims of the central Office by cultivating a\r\npersonal contact with Gauleiter Sauckel.\r\n\r\n(3) _Reinforcing of the Branch Officers._ The commissions which\r\nserve under the chief of the branch officer and which are employed\r\nto inspect the camps, urgently need reinforcements; to be able to\r\nwork successfully in thousands of camps for this purpose about\r\n50 interpreters are needed besides liaison agents to the country\r\nemployment offices and those trustees of the Gau who worked in an\r\nhonorary capacity, the chief of the commissions need a uniform.\r\n\r\n(4) _Reinforcing the Sections._ The four sections of the Central\r\nOffice, (Matters of organization, legal and information service,\r\nsupervision aid, and psychological training) need to be immediately\r\nfilled by at least six representatives. On account of the avalanche\r\nof problems brought to the Central Office, urgent questions remain\r\notherwise unsolved and hundreds of transactions unsettled in spite of\r\nthe twelve hour day and sometimes several hours of night work, as well.\r\nOf what far reaching importance it is to see to it that a political\r\nuse is made of the stay of several million Eastern laborers in the\r\nReich. That on 8/9/42 their members already amounted to 1,737,000 is\r\nlower as from many other reasons by a glance at the present condition\r\nof the German censored figures. In spite of all measures to Germanize\r\nand re-Germanize people who are unfortunately confronted by increased\r\nwar casualties the future of the German people when measured against\r\nthe breadth of age levels placed on top of each other as characterized\r\nby a population pyramid whose outlines deviate from the biologically\r\nnormal picture of a bell, if one compares the present curve of the\r\nfuture professionals with the similar curves of the Eastern peoples\r\nit will be frighteningly apparent that especially during the decisive\r\ndecades after this war the number of German people of the Harz areas in\r\nthe East which will be required for a normal administrative development\r\nwill not be on hand, the willingness and cooperation of members of\r\nthe Eastern peoples is herewith an unavoidable necessity, wherefore\r\nthe years commiting an army of millions of Eastern laborers in the\r\nReich are not only seen from the view-point of overcoming the problems\r\nconcerned but actively must be used to create a reliable propaganda\r\narmy which after its return home will perhaps one day will be just as\r\ndecisive for the German fate in the East as the victory of our weapons.\r\n\r\n  signed: DR.

Party member\r\nDr. Rienhardt has already informed my expert that at present the\r\ndistribution of any paper whatsoever for such periodicals was barred.\r\n\r\nI urge you to see to it in any redistribution of paper to be considered\r\nlater that the confessional writing, which according to experiences\r\nso far gathered, possesses very doubtful value for strengthening the\r\npower of resistance of the people toward the external foe, receives\r\nstill sharper restrictions in favor of literature, politically and\r\nideologically more valuable.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the draft of an order \"for fulfillment of the\r\norganizational duty by the production of writings\", presented upon your\r\nrequest, will be a suitable means for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  signed: M BORMANN\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 090-PS\r\n\r\n  18 September 1940\r\n  2474-R/Dt.\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n  To the Reich Treasurer of the NSDAP\r\n  Reich Director F.X. Schwarz,\r\n  _Munich 33._\r\n\r\n  Dear Party Member Schwarz,\r\n\r\nThanks for your helpfulness in regard to the safeguarding of scientific\r\nmaterials in the occupied territories. I deduce from this that you are\r\ninterested in this work and would therefore like to inform you about\r\nseveral matters.\r\n\r\nIt took some time until we found by and by the several treasures, and\r\nuntil we could ascertain that a lot had been abducted from Paris into\r\nother towns. Thus the treasures of the Rothschilds, robbed together\r\nfrom all parts of the world, are being secured by us not only in\r\nParis but also in the various castles of the Rothschilds (Bordeaux,\r\nDeauville and so on). Legal doubts arose and I have discussed them\r\nwith the Fuehrer. Subsequently he caused a new order to be issued by\r\nthe Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces which I enclose\r\nin duplicate. Thus the Seminary (Hohe Schule) will still receive a\r\nPolish library of 130,000 volumes. This will include the complete\r\nhistory of the East, probably a large Slavic library and many other\r\nitems. Together with a lot of scientific material many extremely\r\nvaluable objects of art have been found in cases at the residence of\r\nthe Rothschilds. This has been secured and the Fuehrer will decide at a\r\nlater date as to the final disposal.\r\n\r\nIn Brussels and Amsterdam we are on the track of valuable objects too.\r\nI believe that we shall be able to bring quite some material from there\r\nto Germany.\r\n\r\nYou see that we are industrially endeavoring to exploit the present\r\nmoment. Such an opportunity will hardly present itself again. I am\r\ntrying to keep the Staff for Special Purposes down to a minimum.\r\nNevertheless it is unavoidable that a number of experts have to work at\r\nvarious places. And the work takes longer than was anticipated in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nOnce more many thanks. If I should come to Munich in the near future I\r\nhope to meet you.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  28 January 1941\r\n\r\n  3581/R/dt\r\n  [initials] Sch\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  To: The Reich Treasurer of the NSDAP\r\n  Reich Director F.X. Schwarz\r\n\r\n  _Munich 33_\r\n\r\n  _Subject: Staff for Special Purposes in Paris_\r\n\r\n  Dear Party Member Schwarz,\r\n\r\nAbout the work of my Staff for Special Purposes in France, Holland and\r\nBelgium I can inform you that the major part of the work in France\r\nwill be finished by the end of February. Then only a few men have to\r\nremain in Paris.--However, in Belgium and Holland extensive research\r\nwork has still to be carried out. I hope nevertheless to wind up the\r\nmain part of the work there within a measurable space of time. The\r\narrangement and registration of the large art treasures claimed a lot\r\nof special work. I had these treasures confiscated simultaneously with\r\nthe scientific material. The Fuehrer is going to decide what to do with\r\nthem shortly. As I informed you previously the values involved will\r\ncome close to a billion dollars according to expert estimates.\r\n\r\nI told you already verbally that the largest Jewish library of the\r\nworld, consisting of 350,000 volumes, will be placed in the institution\r\nwhich is going to be opened at Frankfurt on the Main within a short\r\ntime. Another 200,000 volumes will be added from Holland.\r\n\r\nThe library of the IInd International about the history of the social\r\nmovements cannot be transferred for the moment to Germany due to\r\nlack of space. Two will have to take charge of it in Amsterdam where\r\nscientific work can start immediately. This library consists of 130,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThe account of the expenditures up till now will be submitted to\r\nyour deputy by the administrative branch of my office. However, I\r\nhave to request that you put another amount of 100,000 Reichsmark\r\nat my disposal so that I can complete the work satisfactorily. At\r\nthe same time I propose once more that you have parts of those sums\r\nreimbursed--be it from the Reich Marshal or from the Fuehrer's funds\r\nfor cultural purposes. There is no doubt that I also have collected\r\ntreasures which will not benefit the Seminary directly.\r\n\r\nOnce more I want to express my deepest thanks for letting us have the\r\nSchrenck-Notzing-Palais in Munich for our institution. Prof. Harder,\r\nthe future director of this institution, is extremely pleased with it\r\nand will soon get in touch with your deputy.\r\n\r\nA depiction of the situation regarding the branch offices of the\r\nSeminary in the various cities is just being completed and will be\r\nsubmitted to you within a short time.\r\n\r\nOnce more many thanks for your generous support.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  Yours\r\n  [in pencil] Sch\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [SYNOPSIS]\r\n  Letter of 22 May 1941, 4592/4863/R/Ma\r\n  To the Reich Treasurer of the NSDAP, Reich Director Schwarz,\r\n  Munich 33.\r\n  Written by Rosenberg\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Letter of 9 May 1941, K IV/te. 4363 H.

We could then decide which objects and\r\ntapestries to suggest to the Fuehrer to be used for the furnishing\r\nof the Seminary [Hohe Schule] respectively of my office. The Fuehrer\r\nwill hardly be able to visit the exhibition due to the fact that he is\r\npresently overburdened with work. However I shall ask him to visit it\r\nlater and shall inform you when the Fuehrer will be able to come.\r\n\r\nOnce more I thank you for your generous support extended to my staff\r\nfor special purposes.

However, great difficulties have arisen to that effect due\r\nto the proximity of the front lines. I have therefore put at the\r\ndisposal of the Chief of my main work division Netherlands, SS Major\r\nSchmidt-Staehler, the special purpose chief Gummert with full powers\r\nfor the execution of this task.

The question, having come up for discussion\r\nagain by the statements of Reich Bishop Mueller, is however in my mind\r\nof such fundamental importance for the future ideological position of\r\nthe party, that I find it necessary, already now to point out to you\r\nthe serious objections I have in regard to such a commission.\r\n\r\nThe ministry for education of the Reich has repeatedly indicated its\r\ndesire in the course of the past few years for new directions for\r\nformulating the teaching of religion, which would also be acceptable to\r\nthe NSDAP.\r\n\r\nWith your agreement, this request has repeatedly been refused by the\r\nFuehrer's deputy. Just as your ministry did, so the deputy of the\r\nFuehrer took the position based on the assumption, that it could not\r\nbe the task of the party to give directions for the instruction of the\r\nteachings of Christian religions.\r\n\r\nChristianity and National Socialism are phenomena which originated from\r\nentirely different basic causes. Both differ fundamentally so strongly,\r\nthat it will not be possible to construct a Christian teaching which\r\nwould be completely compatible with the point of view of the national\r\nsocialist ideology; just as the communities of Christian faith would\r\nnever be able to stand by the ideology of national socialism in its\r\nentirety. The issuing of national socialist directions for the teaching\r\nof religious classes would however be based on a synthesis of national\r\nsocialism and Christianity which I find impossible.\r\n\r\nIf the directions should really be permeated by the spirit of\r\nnational socialism, some very fundamental articles of faith of the\r\nChristian teachings could not be recognized. I am referring here only\r\nto the position of the Christian churches to the race question, to\r\nthe question of hindrance or destruction of life not valuable, its\r\nposition to marriage, which speaks for the celibacy of priests and the\r\ntoleration and furtherance of orders for monks and nuns, the teaching,\r\ncontradictory to German feeling, of the immaculate conception of Mary,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNo matter how these directions may be formulated, in no case will they\r\never simultaneously find the approval of the church and the party.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the religions themselves cannot agree on the\r\ncontents of the Christian teachings; as far as the Protestants\r\nthemselves are concerned, there are not only the followers of the\r\nconfessional church in the Reich and the German Christians, but also\r\nthe adherents of a teaching, which is endeavoring to create a new\r\nLutheran Christendom of a particular kind approximately in the shape\r\nwhich seems desirable to the Reich Minister of churches, party member\r\nKerrl. The party thus would have to decide first which of these\r\ndirections of faith it would give preference, or if it should even\r\ndecide for a fourth. I do not think it entirely impossible that the\r\nReich Bishop may take this latter road, since according to his last\r\npublication he himself has already turned sharply away from conceptions\r\nwhich up to now have been part of the faith of the German Christians.\r\n\r\nBut if directions for the instruction of religion should ever be worked\r\nout, it will not be enough, to my mind, to make them for Protestants\r\nonly; respective directions should also be worked out for Catholics.\r\nTo work out directions for instructions of Catholic faith, the Reich\r\nBishop is hardly the suitable person, and one would probably have to\r\nchoose a Catholic. Of course the directions for both faiths would\r\ndiffer in fundamental questions, each, however would lay claim to the\r\nfact that it really contained the truly authentic interpretation of\r\narticle 24 of the party program.\r\n\r\nBy issuing directions nothing would therefore be improved in the\r\npresent situation in the field of the churches. The fight between the\r\nfaiths would be carried on in the old form and spread into the lines of\r\nthe party. Yes, all faiths and Christian groups would attack state and\r\nparty, because they had assumed to encroach upon their own territory,\r\nthat of teaching the Christian faith and to try to reform it.\r\n\r\nThe churches cannot be conquered by a compromise between national\r\nsocialism and Christian teachings, but only through a new ideology,\r\nwhose coming you yourself have announced in your writings. Because of\r\nthis conviction we have always been careful, not to exert a reforming\r\ninfluence on the Christian dogma in any shape nor to exert any\r\ninfluence on the church directives for religious teachings. In complete\r\nmutual agreement we have rejected the intention of the Reich Minister\r\nfor churches who, against the objection of the party, always tried anew\r\nto renew the church life in the frame of national socialist spirit, in\r\nsearching for a compromise between Christian teachings and the ideology\r\nof national socialism.\r\n\r\nShould, however, any one personality emanating from the life of the\r\nchurch, be charged now to work out directions for the teaching of the\r\nChristian religion, the party would thereby basically approve and\r\naccept for itself the position of the Reich Minister for the churches\r\npreviously opposed by it as there is no basic difference between a\r\nposition which wants to reform and reorganize the church life in its\r\nentirety, and one which aims at this goal solely in the realm of the\r\neducation of youth.\r\n\r\nSo far we have always been in accord, that by taking such a step the\r\nparty would leave the soil on which it is firmly planted and would\r\nstep on the swaying ground of the controversial Christian doctrines.\r\nIt would enter into the domain of the interpretation of the teachings\r\nof Jesus, and there would doubtless be subordinate to those who for\r\ncenturies have done nothing but interpret and rewrite the words and\r\ndeeds of Jesus of Nazareth as written in the old books about the actual\r\nwording of which the scientists fight even today. When in later decades\r\nand centuries the German people's soul liberated by national socialism\r\nshould once again be choked and crippled by Christian doctrines, it\r\ncould be possible that it may have been caused by today's attempt to\r\neffect a synthesis between national socialism and Christianity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of course I am also of the opinion that it is not\r\npossible to eliminate the religious instruction in schools without\r\nreplacing it with something better for the moral education of youth.\r\n\r\nReligious instruction as given in schools today does not only comprise\r\nthe instruction in the Christian doctrines of faith, the teachings of\r\nthe creation of the world and of the life thereafter; besides, the\r\nchildren receive also instructions in the ten commandments, which for\r\nmost comrades of the people to this day still are the only directives\r\nfor their moral behavior and for an orderly collective life in the\r\npeople's community. If this instruction is taken from the children\r\nwithout replacing it with something better, the objection can be\r\nmade--in my estimation not without reason, that, as many contend, the\r\npresent degradation of youth is in part caused by the lack of religious\r\ninstruction in schools.\r\n\r\nWhat, in my opinion, is therefore necessary is the preparation of a\r\nshort directive about a national socialist life formulation. We need\r\nfor the work of education in the party, especially also in the Hitler\r\nYouth a short resume in which the ethical principles are documented,\r\nto respect which each German boy and girl, who at one time will be\r\nrepresentatives of the national socialistic Germany, must be educated.\r\nIn such a directive for instance belongs the law of bravery, the law\r\nagainst cowardness, the commandment of love for the soulful nature in\r\nwhich God makes himself apparent also in the animal and the plant, a\r\ncommandment to keep the blood pure; many principles also belong here\r\nwhich are for instance also contained in the decalogue of the Old\r\nTestament, as far as they can be regarded as moral principles of all\r\npeople's life.\r\n\r\nThe publication of such a directive can and must only come out of our\r\nnational socialist conduct of life. Its commandments of customs need to\r\nbe explained by reference to any doctrines of faith about the creation\r\nof life and about life of the soul after death.\r\n\r\nThey can and must originate beyond any confessional discussions.\r\n\r\nI take the publication of such a directive to be of utmost importance,\r\nbecause the German boys and girls must once be told what they can and\r\nmust do, and what is forbidden for them to do. I don't even think it\r\nnecessary to introduce this directive immediately into the schools\r\nas a text; it would be sufficient if for the time being it would be\r\nintroduced into the party and its affiliations. Later it could also be\r\ntaken over by the schools just as the little Catechism also was not\r\ncreated by the school boards, but first taught by the Church and later\r\ntaken over by the schools.\r\n\r\nAs far as the religious instructions in the schools is concerned, I do\r\nnot think that anything has to be changed in the present situation. No\r\nfault can be found with any national socialist teacher, who after the\r\nunmistakenly clear instructions of the Fuehrer's deputy, is ready to\r\ngive school instructions in the Christian religion. For the contents\r\nof this instruction, however, the directives should still be binding\r\nwhich have in former years been made by the churches themselves. In\r\nthe circular of the Fuehrer's deputy No. 3/39 of 4 Jan 1939 it is\r\nstated explicitly that the teachers charged with religious instruction\r\nare not to choose from the material on biblical history at their own\r\ndiscretion, but have the obligation to teach the entire biblical\r\ninstruction material. Interpretations, explanations and separations in\r\nthe sense of several attempts of particular church directions have to\r\nbe omitted. The pupils must be given the entire picture of the biblical\r\ninstruction material.\r\n\r\nHowever, the teachers have the right to present this material as\r\nproperty of biblical thought and not as that of Germany or national\r\nsocialism. If thus in some cases comparison will be drawn, this,\r\naccording to the circular, corresponds only to the duties of the\r\neducator. Against such instruction of religion the churches cannot have\r\nany objections.\r\n\r\nWhen, sometime later, the proposed directive for a new German conduct\r\nof life first to be used in the educational work of the party, will\r\nhave found entry into the schools, it shall in no way supplant classes\r\nin religion. It may perhaps be used as a foundation for some classes in\r\nGerman and must have validity for all pupils, without consideration of\r\ntheir religious affiliations. Against such educational procedure the\r\nchurches could not object, either because it would really be a matter\r\nof additional education, which would take place next to the religious\r\ninstruction and without any connection with it. On the contrary, the\r\nchurches would have reason to be thankful to the state because it is\r\nnot satisfied with the religious instruction according to the very\r\ninsufficient moral education based on the ten commandments, but that\r\nit is giving youth an additional Education, which makes much higher\r\ndemands on its moral conduct.\r\n\r\nParallel to that the desire of the parents for the instruction in the\r\ndoctrines of faith may thus well go on. The stronger and more fertile\r\nour _positive_ educational work in the schools will be formulated,\r\nhowever the more certain it is that instruction of religions will be\r\nlosing in importance.\r\n\r\nIf the youth which is now being educated according to our moral laws\r\nwill later have to decide if it is still willing to have its children\r\nbrought up in the far inferior Christian doctrines, the decision will\r\nin most cases be negative.\r\n\r\nI would think that today, seven years after taking over the power,\r\nit should be possible to set up principles for a national socialist\r\nconduct of life. They have long been apparent to the people from the\r\nnumerous early fighters for the national socialist idea.\r\n\r\nAs long as we do not master this task, however, it will always be\r\npointed out from various sides, and rightly so, that children, not\r\ntaking part in religious instruction, are no longer taught even the\r\nmost simple moral laws which are a standard for the communal life of\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer's deputy finds it necessary that all these questions should\r\nbe thoroughly discussed in the near future in the presence of the Reich\r\nleaders, who are especially affected by them. I would appreciate it\r\nvery much if you would let me know your position in this matter before\r\nthe discussion.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  /s/ M.

I construe\r\nfrom numerous reports, that the political communities have to raise\r\nsuch a large war fund, that the execution of their tasks, partially\r\nvery important for example in the field of public welfare, is\r\nendangered. In consideration of that, a larger quota from the churches\r\nappears to be absolutely appropriate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the determination of the amount cannot be affected by\r\nthe argument that the fund could only have as a consequence a decrease\r\nof the material expenses, but not of the personnel expenses of the\r\nchurches. I consider it absolutely bearable, to decrease also the\r\npersonnel expenses, especially for the Catholic clergymen. In contrast\r\nto all other German men, obliged to serve, not one Catholic clergyman\r\nis in the field as the soldier; also none of the Catholic clergymen\r\ntakes obligations unto himself voluntarily, like the ones which must be\r\nborne by every German family head.\r\n\r\nAs far as the technical handling of the war fund to be determined for\r\nthe Catholic Church is concerned, in my opinion, the state does not\r\nhave to bother to figure out the individual partial contributions,\r\nwhich must be raised by the various Orders and religious associations.\r\nI would rather consider it correct if the amount is determined in one\r\nfor the entire Catholic Church, and if one then leaves it to the Church\r\nto divide up this amount according to its own best knowledge. However,\r\nthe state must be free to call upon the property and funds of the\r\nvarious individual parts and groups of the church arbitrarily to make\r\nits demands valid.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Evangelical Church is concerned, for years the efforts\r\nof the Reichminister for Church Affairs have been in the direction to\r\norganize all the State Churches [Landeskirchen] of the Evangelical\r\nChurch into one unified organization with a unified leadership for the\r\nspiritual as well as for the financial affairs. Despite the objections,\r\nraised by the party, these plans were more and more elaborated upon;\r\neven during the war, they were followed up without interruption.\r\nTherefore it is not unjust, to determine in one for the Evangelical\r\nChurch the war fund to be raised according to the same principles,\r\nwhich have been developed for the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nIt should be left up to the State Churches [Landeskirchen] and\r\nreligious associations, who consider such treatment unjust, to\r\ndemonstrate in an easily perceptible manner, that they are not in any\r\ndependent relationship to the leadership of the German Evangelical\r\nChurch, and do not desire to come under the latter's dominion.\r\n\r\nI would be thankful to you, if you could inform us very soon, how high\r\nthe amount of the war fund of the churches has been set at. The sum,\r\ncalculated for the duration of the first three months, of which, as I\r\nunderstand, the churches have not paid one penny, may not correspond in\r\nany way to the capability, as figured from the entire fortune and from\r\nthe contribution and/or tax income of the Churches.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n\r\n  By order\r\n\r\n  M B (M.

This administering finds its expression especially in the fact\r\nthat soldiers are being sent religious publications by the spiritual\r\nleaders of the home congregations. These publications are in part very\r\ncleverly composed. I have repeated reports that these publications are\r\nbeing read by the troops and thereby exercise a certain influence on\r\nthe morale.\r\n\r\nI have in the past sought by sounding out the General Field Marshall,\r\nthe High Command of the Armed Forces and Party Member Reich Director\r\nAmann, to restrict considerably the production and shipment of\r\npublications of this type. The result of these efforts remain\r\nunsatisfactory. As Reich Director [Reichsleiter] Amann has repeatedly\r\ninformed me, the restriction of these pamphlets by means of the\r\nprinting paper rationing has not been achieved because the paper used\r\nfor the production of these writings is being purchased on the open\r\nmarket. Publications can only be confiscated by special police measures\r\nbecause they are designed to weaken the morale of the troops. Such\r\npolice measures are really unsatisfactory and in their final execution\r\nvery much disputed.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the prior censorship of all writings by the High Command\r\nof the Armed Forces which takes place at the distribution points of\r\nthe Armed Forces service bureau, is not sufficient in my opinion, to\r\nguarantee that the soldiers are not given an undesired influence by the\r\nChurches. A publication, the contents of which are clearly tied to the\r\nChristian dogma and which do not contain attacks against Party, State\r\nor the Armed Forces, can not in general be refused permission by this\r\nexamining commission.\r\n\r\nIf the influencing of the soldiers by the Church is to be effectively\r\ncombatted, this will only be accomplished, in my opinion, by producing\r\nmany good publications in the shortest time possible under the\r\nsupervision of the Party. These publications should be so composed that\r\nthe soldiers will really prefer to read them, and at the same time,\r\nindoctrinate the soldiers with a National Socialist World philosophy,\r\nnot the Christian viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThus at the last meeting of the deputy Gauleiters complaints were\r\nuttered on this matter to the effect that a considerable quantity\r\nof such publications are not available. This is the reason I\r\nbelieve, that the publication by your expert, Office Director\r\n[Amtsleiter] Party Member Ziegler, \"_Soldier Belief--Soldier Honor_\"\r\n[Soldatenglaube--Soldatenehre] has had so great a sale in a short time.\r\n\r\nI maintain that it is necessary that in the near future we\r\ntransmit to the Party Service Offices down to local group directors\r\n[Ortsgruppenleitern] a list of additional publications of this sort\r\nwhich should be sent to our soldiers by the local groups, Party\r\nmilitary units [Sturme] or their adherents and friends in the field.\r\nI should not regard it as necessary or even good if the majority of\r\nthese publications should have a spiritual or philosophical character.\r\nRather I should regard it as much preferable if these publications in\r\ntheir finished form were styled in as varied a manner as possible, thus\r\nhaving an appeal to all members of the Armed Forces, regardless of\r\ntheir occupational or professional achievements, regardless of their\r\ninterests and their background.\r\n\r\nI should be very appreciative if you would devote your very special\r\nattention to this task, in the near future. My expert, Party Member Dr.\r\nKlopfer, is available to you for consultation about the material on\r\nhand here which is at your disposal at any time upon your call.\r\n\r\nAs the production of these publications (which at the moment are not\r\nin existence) will take a certain amount of time, and as, on the other\r\nhand, I believe that the supplying of the troops with good publications\r\nought not to be delayed a day, I should be indebted to you if you would\r\ntransmit to me a list of the already existing publications which the\r\ndeputy of the Fuehrer can recommend to the Party Service Offices as\r\nsuitable for dispatch to the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  [Signed] M.

Therefore it is forbidden to have any class,\r\nprofessional and religious barriers in the Reichsarbeitsdienst.\r\n\r\nWhat religious beliefs a person has is not a decisive factor, but it is\r\ndecisive that he first of all feels himself a German.\r\n\r\nEvery religious practice is forbidden in the Reichsarbeitsdienst\r\nbecause it disturbs the comrade-like harmony of all working men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nOn this basis every participation of the Reichsarbeitsdienst in\r\nchurchly, that is religious, arrangements and celebrations is not\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nA religious creed will strive within the German people for\r\npredominance. The Reichsarbeitsdienst in all its male and female\r\nleaders, working men and women strive for the indissoluble binding of\r\nthe whole people.\r\n\r\nTherefore not only allowing the members of the Reichsarbeitsdienst\r\nto attend church in a body, but also participation by the members\r\nof the Reichsarbeitsdienst in religious celebrations for example,\r\nweddings or funerals, violates the educational task which is facing the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nAs little as it is the affair of the Reichsarbeitsdienst to forbid its\r\nindividual members to have a church wedding or funeral, so definitely\r\nmust the Reichsarbeitsdienst avoid taking part as an organization in a\r\nfestival which is strictly religious, that is, which excludes Germans\r\nof other beliefs.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore, in any case, necessary to execute a clear temporal\r\nseparation between the churchly celebration and the debut of the\r\nReichsarbeitsdienst.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsarbeitsdienst does not participate in religious celebrations,\r\nbut rather turns her support to the marriage or burial of a member\r\nbefore or after the churchly celebration.\r\n\r\nThe participation of the musical band of the Reichsarbeitsdienst\r\nin classical churchly concerts (for example, production of the\r\n\"Schoepfung\" by Haydn) is not to be regarded as a partaking in a\r\nreligious celebration, and is always to be decided according to the\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\n  Signed: HIERL\r\n\r\n  Authenticated:\r\n  REISMEIR\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 113-PS\r\n\r\n  Rosenberg\r\n  [in pencil]\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS PARTY\r\n\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer Chief of Staff\r\n  Munich, Brown House, 27 July 1938\r\n\r\n  III Entered 11 Aug 38 6691\r\n  [Stamped]\r\n\r\n  Rosenberg Chancellery\r\n  [Stamped] Entry No. 2896k 3 Aug 38\r\n\r\n REGULATION NR 104/38\r\n\r\n (Not to be published)\r\n\r\n Requested to be returned from III, Returned 22 Aug\r\n\r\n  [in pencil]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the constantly emphasized neutrality of the party with\r\nthe churches, it is pertinent to eliminate, as far as possible, the\r\nexisting frictions.

No doubts exist on this ground if the theological\r\nfaculties in the German High schools are appreciably restricted.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as you have likewise pointed out in your letter, the\r\nclause of the Concordat and the Church Treaties are to be taken\r\ninto consideration. In the case of certain faculties, which are not\r\nmentioned by a specific clause in the Concordat and Church Treaties, as\r\nfor example Munich and a few others, a suppression can be begun without\r\nfurther to do. This is equally true of the theological faculties in\r\nAustria, Vienna and Graz.\r\n\r\nBut also, in the case of the faculties which are specifically\r\nmentioned in the Concordat or Church Treaties, there now exists a\r\nspecial legal situation which has been created by the general change\r\nin circumstances. Particularly, the introduction of military service\r\nand the execution of the Four Year Plan must be considered. By\r\nvirtue of these measures, and in addition by virtue of the fact of\r\nan extraordinary lack of replacement men in contrast to the earlier\r\nnumerous replacement men available, it will be necessary to execute a\r\ncertain reorganization of the German High Schools. Thus economics and\r\nsimplifications are necessary. I should like to refer particularly once\r\nmore to these questions on the basis of the oral discussion between\r\nMr. State Minister Dr. Wacker and my expert. Because of this I would\r\nappreciate it very much if you would restrict the theological faculties\r\ninsofar as they cannot be wholly suppressed in accordance with the\r\nabove statement. In this event the matter concerns not only the\r\ntheological faculties in the universities, but also the various state\r\nestablishments which still exist in many places as institutes of high\r\nlearning exclusively devoted to theology and without connection with a\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nI request in this instance the omission of any express declaration\r\nto the churches or to other places as well as the avoiding of a\r\npublic announcement of these measures. Complaints and the like must\r\nbe answered (if they are to be replied to) in the fashion that these\r\nmeasures are being executed in the course of the economic plan of\r\nreorganization and that similar things are happening to other faculties.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it very much if professorial chairs, thus vacated,\r\ncan be then turned over to the newly created fields of inquiry of these\r\nlast years, such as racial research, archaeology studies, etc.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  as representative\r\n  Signed: M.

The party has repudiated\r\nthese plans with all its force and for the following reasons. In the\r\nfirst place it would not be compatible for the doctrinal demands of\r\nNational Socialism to unite the State with the churches as the outer\r\norganization of the religious communions which do not have as aim in\r\nall their fields the carrying out of the National Socialist principles.\r\nIn the second place, considerations of a political nature oppose such\r\nan outer unity. At present, the churches, the Protestant as well as\r\nthe Catholic one, are disunited internally, and partly externally too,\r\nseen from an organizational point of view, they do not form a unity\r\nany longer. A union of these churches with a State built on a strong\r\nclose leadership and on any National Socialist principles is bound\r\nto fail. Such a union, furthermore, would result in constant arguing\r\nbetween Church and State. Furthermore, competence quarrels would arise\r\nconstantly there, where measures have to be taken concerning either\r\nthe State or the Church; in this case also one must always count with\r\nthe difficulty that the Churches would refuse such decisions out\r\nof dogmatic reasons. Numerous examples of such an attitude can be\r\nfound there, where out of historical reasons, there still is a union\r\nbetween State and Church, such as for instance in the case of the\r\nSchool. But even there where the State has recently tried to bring\r\norder in the affairs of the Church by making decisions such as for\r\ninstance the setting up of a State's finance committee for the Church\r\nadministration, experience has been made that one portion of the\r\nchurches thought these decisions were necessary, but another portion\r\nthought, for dogmatic reasons, that this was an intolerable meddling\r\nwith the church life. With such unfortunate circumstances, there is\r\nalways a danger for the State that it has to execute its decisions\r\nforcibly if these are not being carried out; this particular condition\r\nmust be prevented for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons of doctrinal and political nature, the deputy of\r\nthe Fuehrer has opposed the setting up of a State Church; he has also\r\nrejected the attempts to make use of the authority of the State for\r\na different kind of union between the State and Church and to settle\r\nouter organizational matters which should be the task of the Church.\r\nThe party, therefore, would regret very much if contrary to this\r\nattitude, the Armed Forces would continue with their plans to set up\r\na private consistory for the Armed Forces, that is to say to create\r\na private church for the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces Church would\r\nindeed be nothing else but a State Church within the Armed Forces. To\r\nsupplement this I would like to bring out the following points:\r\n\r\n1. A great portion of the ministers of both churches stand, in\r\naccordance with the attitude of the churches, in concealed and also\r\nopen opposition to National Socialism and the State led by it. In these\r\nquestions a different judgment of the case is presented as it would\r\nhave been before or during the World War when the churches were in a\r\nmore positive relationship to the State. Today, however, the churches\r\nand the ministers, should a crisis arise for this National Socialist\r\nState, would pass from concealed to open opposition. They will not in\r\ntimes of crisis support or help this state but at best leave it to\r\nits own fate. That they will even fight this State in these times in\r\norder to regain lost fields is clearly demonstrated by the Protestant\r\nbeseeching prayer in reference to the Sudetenland crisis; I want to\r\nbring this incident to your attention once more. This high treasonlike\r\nbeseeching prayer proves that the churches have only been waiting till\r\nthe National Socialist State found itself, at least in their opinion,\r\nin a moment of uneasiness, to take up the fight against the State with\r\ntheir whole psychological influential means. In my opinion this fact\r\ndeserves special attention, because this beseeching prayer clearly\r\ndemonstrates in which spiritually extraordinary successful way these\r\nchurches try to influence the individuals. I do not think that the\r\nministers of these churches will be a support to the fighting troops,\r\nbut that on the contrary, they will be to a great extent dangerous\r\ndestroyers of the spiritual fighting strength in the decisive moment.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that at that time this beseeching prayer was\r\napproved by most of the country's churches and that it was only later\r\non, once these trying days were put to a good end, and often drawn out\r\nnegotiations from the part of the Reich's church ministry had been\r\nended, that some of the country's churches announced their disapproval;\r\nthis disapproval, however, in the meantime was in part repudiated.\r\nA separate church from the Armed Forces even though it might free\r\nitself, as to its organization, from the other country's churches, will\r\nnot be spared from this danger. The Armed Forces church would have to\r\nget its recruits from the other churches. Even if one would go as far,\r\nand this in my opinion is practically impossible, as to how the Armed\r\nForces form their own ministery from youth on, this separation of an\r\nArmed Forces church from the rest of the churches will not be possible\r\nbecause their church faith ideas will remain the same because they are\r\nall based on dogmatic principles.\r\n\r\n2. It is known to me that certain disputes arose when the Armed Forces\r\ntried to bring about a union between the Protestant and Catholic\r\nchurches; furthermore, that certain organizational measures such as\r\nfor instance the combining of the Church song book, the creation of\r\na unified Church service etc. would be appropriate. But according\r\nto experiences which the party and the State encountered in these\r\nquestions, the difficulties, instead of decreasing, on the contrary\r\nincrease when these matters are taken in hand by authorities other\r\nthan the church. But the party, by its logical attitude towards\r\nthese matters, wanted to spare the State from these difficulties and\r\narguments within the churches, that are always led back on dogmatic\r\nprinciples. It should remain up to the church if they can, want or\r\ndo not, to accomplish these desirable organizational measures and\r\nunifications. The State or the party would furthermore oppose an\r\ninevitable development in this field by meddling in church matters;\r\nnamely a development which would lead to leaving these affairs to\r\nforces which still want to be in connection with the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer's Deputy has therefore considered it as his duty, after\r\nthe basic decision to reject a union between State and Church had been\r\nmade, to see to it that the basic ideological freedom of faith and\r\nconscience be also practically realized in all the State's decrees,\r\ndecisions etc. Everywhere the church matters have been left up to the\r\nchurch, but also every religious constraint, wherever present, was\r\nremoved. At the same time, those who wanted to busy themselves, with\r\nChurch and religious matters in a correct carrying out of the basic\r\nfaith and conscience freedom were given the possibility to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer's Deputy would welcome it if the Armed Forces would act in\r\nthese essential ideological decisions, after the same principles as\r\nthe party and also now the State have laid out for themselves, instead\r\nof pursuing the plans for a creation of an Armed Forces Church or\r\nany other closer union between the Armed Forces and the church. I am\r\nconvinced that in a short time there will be no more difficulties for\r\nthe Armed Forces either, which difficulties had been brought about by\r\nthe plan to create a separate Armed Forces Church. In fact the Armed\r\nForces have already taken a position to these questions and basically\r\nalso in the sense of accomplishing freedom of faith and conscience.\r\nIt should be decisive, however, in this respect to note that these\r\ninstructions are in many cases not always completely carried out. To\r\nassure a right execution of this principle of freedom of faith and\r\nconscience it would be in my opinion necessary to observe the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n(1) The orders stating that no constraint can be exercised in the\r\nattendance of church services during the free evening hours in army\r\ncamps would really have to be complied with. The carrying out of these\r\norders should not, as in reality it sometimes is, be left up to the\r\ndiscretion of some higher or lower ranking superiors. In most cases, no\r\ndirect constraint is exercised but in some cases the non-assistance of\r\nchurch services is punished by extra duty etc. Such incidents should\r\nlead in the future to disciplinary action.\r\n\r\n(2) The duty of Army Chaplains, if they are available in the Armed\r\nForces, should be to give an opportunity to those members of the Armed\r\nForces who have a need to talk things over with them. They could hold\r\nreligious services if there is a need for it and if the members of the\r\nArmed Forces cannot attend the regular services. But the attendance\r\nwould have to be on a voluntary basis for everybody.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the Armed Forces which grasp all German men,\r\nthere will be a need to a certain extent for attendance of Church\r\nservices. These members of the Armed Forces should be given an\r\nopportunity, provided it does not interfere with the service, to\r\nvisit churches and ministers on their own. But further than that,\r\nArmy chaplains should not be used to hold church services, to arrange\r\nevening hours etc. and to exercise any constraint to that effect. They\r\nshould only be available in order to be present there where a need\r\narises for them.\r\n\r\n(3) Special officer ranks of the church service and similar\r\ninstitutions should be abolished.\r\n\r\n(4) The building of own Armed Forces Churches should also be\r\ndiscontinued. I hardly think that there will be many cases where the\r\nmembers of the Armed Forces will not have the possibility to visit a\r\nchurch, outside of the Army, just like everybody else.\r\n\r\n(5) No formation Church attendance should take place.\r\n\r\n(6) Church organizations should have nothing to do with the Armed\r\nForces. Everything should be left up to the individual in his field.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think I can say that with these and other measures,\r\nnamely with the complete and exact accomplishment of the principle\r\nof freedom of faith and conscience, in a short time the technical\r\ndifficulties which might have arisen here and there could be overcome.\r\nI want to point once more to the order dated 13.12.1938, issued by\r\nthe Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. According to\r\nthis order, military celebrations are not to be connected any more\r\nwith a religious benediction at the time the recruits are being sworn\r\nin. The attendance of Church services of the soldiers, which takes\r\nplace possibly right after they are sworn in, is voluntary. The church\r\nservices are to be held separately from the swearing in ceremonies.\r\n\r\nIt would, in my opinion be very necessary, it would also be in\r\naccordance with the basic attitude of the Fuehrer's deputy that these\r\nprinciples contained in this order would be applied wherever the\r\nquestion of the relationship between the Armed Forces and the church\r\narises. Such a correct and exact accomplishment of the principle of\r\nfreedom of faith and conscience would present the proof that the Armed\r\nForces cannot be accused of being anti-Church or anti-Christian; on\r\nthe other hand, it would also prove that the Armed Forces are not\r\nbased on different ideological principles than the ones represented\r\nand executed by the State, the National Socialist Workers' Party and\r\nits affiliation. In this way it would be made certain that the same\r\neducational principles exist in all the organizations as well as the\r\nteaching institutions of our German people, namely the Armed Forces,\r\nthe Hitler Youth, School labor service and affiliations of the party.\r\nI think that this fact would do much more for the spiritual integrity\r\nof the German soldier than if the young German would find himself\r\nconfronted, during the various stages of his education, with various\r\nattitudes toward these questions.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n\r\n  1 Enclosure.

I have already ordered the combination\r\nof the Catholic faculty in Graz with the one in Vienna which will\r\nremain the only place in Austria with both faculties.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria after closing the Munich faculty there will remain the\r\nCatholic faculty at Wurzburg and the Evangelic faculty at Erlangen.\r\nThe continuation of these is important but the five state theological\r\ninstitutes of Bavaria should be reduced to three. I ask you to suggest\r\nthe two to be closed.\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest regions I suggest the removal of the Evangelical\r\nfaculty in Heidelberg to Tubingen and of the Catholic faculty in\r\nTubingen to Freiberg. That will provide an exchange between Wurttemberg\r\nand Baden based on the Catholic predominance in Baden and Evangelic\r\npredominance in Wurttemberg.\r\n\r\nIn West Germany a similar exchange between Bonn and Munster is proposed\r\nbut which shall be designated Catholic or Evangelic is a difficult\r\nquestion. A decision I should like to postpone a little time.\r\n\r\nA similar question arises with the proposed transfer of the faculty\r\nfrom Giessen to Marburg. Since the closing of the forestry faculty at\r\nGiessen this university has not many students. The reversal of transfer\r\nis perhaps the solution but that is not feasible at this time because\r\nof the newly organized Institute for Religious Science. Professor\r\nFrick who is to head this institute has pointed out that his transfer\r\nfrom religious to philosophical endeavors may be viewed as a tendency\r\nagainst religion. I have suggested a gradual transfer of activity and\r\nconsider the final time of transfer to be the propitious moment for\r\nsuch a transfer of the Evangelic faculty of the University of Marburg\r\nto that of the University of Bonn. Until that time it will be best to\r\nmaintain the faculty at Gottingen since its influence in the Anglican\r\nworld is great.\r\n\r\nIn the central German regions I propose a transfer of the Leipzig\r\nfaculty to the University of Halle. The small faculty at Jena I should\r\nlike to maintain because of its German-Christian stand.\r\n\r\nIn north German regions a combination of the Evangelic faculties of\r\nRostock and Kiel at Kiel is planned.\r\n\r\nFinally I should like to combine the faculties of Berlin and Greifswald\r\nin Greifswald. A double purpose would be achieved. Greifswald's weak\r\nenrollment would be improved and the Berlin faculty would not have\r\nto be included in the new university city of Berlin. I am sure this\r\nproposal will rouse the Berlin faculty but believe I can handle that\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate this plan would include the complete closing of\r\ntheological faculties at Innsbruck, Salzburg and Munich, the transfer\r\nof the faculty of Graz to Vienna and the vanishing of four Catholic\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n_a._ Closing of three Catholic theological faculties or Higher Schools\r\nand of four Evangelic faculties in the winter semester 1939/40.\r\n\r\n_b._ Closing of one further Catholic and of three further Evangelic\r\nfaculties in the near future.\r\n\r\nI ask your comments at your earliest opportunity. I propose then to\r\ngive the Ministry of Churches this information.\r\n\r\n  By direction:\r\n  ZSCHINTZSCH\r\n  (Authenticated).\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 123-PS\r\n\r\nCopy\r\n\r\n  NSDAP\r\n  The Deputy Fuehrer, Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n  Munich, 23 June 1939, Brown House\r\n  III D-ES 3230/0/15 2131 g.A.E 50/39\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n To the Fuehrer's Commissioner for the supervision of all spiritual and\r\n political instruction and education of the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n  Attention: Verwaltungsleiter Kerksiek or deputy\r\n\r\n  Berlin W. 35, Margarethen St. 17\r\n\r\n  Chancery Rosenberg Receipt No. 29 June 39 8487\r\n\r\n  _Subject: Theological Faculties_\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Conference of Specialists on the Liaison Staff of\r\nthe NSDAP please find enclosed a copy of my letter of today to the\r\nReich Minister for Science, Education and National Education for your\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nI would like to request you to inform me in due time as to your further\r\nwishes regarding the point of view cited in my letter.

No. 76/39g. Concerning this subject a conference has taken\r\nplace between all the party offices concerned, in which the principal\r\npoints of view for the party as well as your statement were discussed.\r\nI would therefore like to inform you in detail of the Party's decisions\r\nas a result of this comprehensive discussion:\r\n\r\n1. The Evangelical faculty of the _Koenigsberg_ University must remain\r\nfor the time being as it is, since it is the only one of this type for\r\nEast Prussia as well as for the whole northeast area.\r\n\r\n2. In future there will no longer exist any necessity for the\r\npreservation of the state Catholic educational institution in\r\n_Braunsberg_. I request you, therefore, to combine this institution\r\nwith the Catholic faculty of the University of Breslau.\r\n\r\n3. Regarding Breslau, the Protestant as well as the Catholic faculties\r\nmust be retained for the time being.\r\n\r\n4. Similarly both faculties of the University of _Prag_ must remain for\r\nthe present as at this time it would not be advisable to reduce the\r\nUniversity of Prag in any manner. Although in regard to a dispersal of\r\nthe theological faculty in Prag there would be no difficulties with\r\nthe Concordat, I do not deem it advisable at the moment to initiate\r\nmeasures of this sort there. Action regarding the University of Prag\r\nmust still be retarded for a time.\r\n\r\n5. The situation at the University of _Vienna_ is very similar. Vienna\r\nis the only university of the Ostmark, at which the theological faculty\r\nis still in existence. I request, therefore, that you reserve any\r\ndecisions in this matter a little longer, until the situation in regard\r\nto the University of Prag has been further cleared up. Nevertheless I\r\nwould like to emphasize now that at a later date the dissolution of the\r\ntheological faculties of the Universities of Wien and Prag will also be\r\nnecessary in my opinion.\r\n\r\n6. I request you to combine the Protestant theological faculty\r\nin _Rostock_ with the Protestant theological faculty in Kiel, in\r\nconformance with both the arrangements described in your message and\r\nthe proposal that I have already put forward.\r\n\r\n7. In regard to the theological faculty in _Berlin_ I am in complete\r\nagreement with you in that under no circumstances should this\r\nfaculty be included in the new University Town [Hochschulstadt]. The\r\ntheological faculty of Berlin must disappear in the near future.\r\nI do not deem it advisable, as you suggest should next be done to\r\ntransfer this faculty to Greifswald. Fundamentally it is inadvisable\r\nto shift the theological faculty of a large city to a small town. The\r\npossibility must not be allowed to arise of such a large number of\r\ntheological students, as would come to a small university city as a\r\nresult of such a transfer, giving this character to this city, and\r\neven perhaps to the whole region. Since this danger does not exist in\r\na large city, I request you to leave the theological faculty in Berlin\r\nfor the time being. I do not deem it necessary to determine the future\r\nof this faculty today, since the new university town will presumably\r\nnot be completed for several years.\r\n\r\n8. Since three theological faculties in the German Baltic area are\r\nnot necessary, I request you to transfer the theological faculty of\r\nthe University of _Greifswald_ as well as that of Rostock to Kiel.\r\nThe theological faculties in Koenigsberg and Kiel should be quite\r\nsufficient. I do not believe special consideration for Greifswald in\r\nregard to the northern states to be necessary since the university of\r\nKiel has made the furthering of ties with the north its particular\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n9. For _Bavaria_ I request that more extensive measures be carried\r\nout than were provided for in your communication of the 6.4.1939. In\r\nthe future the preservation of the five state philosophic-theological\r\nuniversities in Bavaria will no longer be necessary. In so far as\r\nthese are to be theological faculties in the future, the training\r\nof theologians is to be carried out by them and not by any state\r\nuniversities serving the church exclusively. I would ask you therefore\r\nnot only to reduce these institutions to three, but also to break them\r\nup completely in the shortest possible time, if it is not possible\r\nto do so immediately. Above all, I request you to dissolve the\r\nuniversities in Passau, Regensburg and Bamberg in the aforementioned\r\norder, because they are the cores of extremely strong confessional\r\nactivity against National Socialism.\r\n\r\n10. In addition there is also in Bavaria the Church's own Institution\r\nin _Eichstadt_ for training bishops which receives considerable state\r\nsubsidies. Even though there is no question of dissolving this church\r\ninstitution, nevertheless, I would like you to ensure that the State\r\nsubsidies to this institution cease immediately.\r\n\r\n11. I request that the Catholic faculty of the university of\r\n_Wuerzburg_ be retained until further notice.\r\n\r\n12. In the same manner the Protestant faculty of the University of\r\n_Erlangen_ will have to be retained.\r\n\r\n13. Regarding the south German area, I do not agree with your plan to\r\ntransfer the Protestant faculty in _Heidelberg_ to Tuebingen. Tuebingen\r\nhas already become a confirmed Protestant-theological center. It is\r\nfeared that the transferring of the Heidelberg Protestant faculty to\r\nTuebingen would only still further emphasize this characteristic of\r\nthe university town. I wish, therefore, that the Protestant faculty of\r\nTuebingen be combined with that in Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n14. May I give you my decision later regarding your plan to transfer\r\nthe Catholic faculty from Tuebingen to Freiburg, since the necessity\r\nhas arisen to reconsider this matter.\r\n\r\n15. In western Germany, I do not deem your projected exchange between\r\n_Bonn_ and _Muenster_ expedient. I wish you to combine both theological\r\nfaculties in Bonn.\r\n\r\n16. Furthermore, I would request you to transfer the Protestant faculty\r\nof the University of _Marburg_ to Giessen. I do not consider that the\r\nideas which you asserted regarding working with foreign Forscher (odd\r\nsects) at the institute for Religious Science which will be established\r\nin Marburg, solve the problem.\r\n\r\n17. In addition, I wish you to transfer the theological faculty of\r\n_Goettingen_ to Giessen.\r\n\r\n18. The theological faculty of _Jena_ would probably have to be\r\nretained until further notice.\r\n\r\n19. Also the theological faculty in _Leipzig_ should be combined with\r\nthat in Halle.\r\n\r\nIn the above I have informed you of the Party's wishes after thorough\r\ninvestigation of the matter with all party offices. I would be grateful\r\nif you would initiate the necessary measures as quickly as possible,\r\nin regard to the great political significance for the Gau concerned,\r\nwhich will be the result in every single case of such a combination.\r\n\r\nI would like you to always keep in contact with me when instituting\r\nthese measures, in particular with regard to the arranging of\r\nthe actual time, since I am in touch with the competent Gau\r\nadministrations. Furthermore, I would like you to take into\r\nconsideration the following in connection with the mergers which we\r\nhave planned:\r\n\r\n1. As a result of these mergers a rather large number of professional\r\nchairs will become vacant. I believe it of the utmost importance that\r\nthese positions should not remain unfilled, but that they should be\r\noccupied again or at least the greater portion of them. When doing\r\nthis, those branches of science must be primarily considered which have\r\nbeen able to prove that they formerly had too few professional chairs.\r\nI would like to reserve the opportunity of getting in touch with you\r\nagain regarding details.\r\n\r\n2. Furthermore, as a result of these mergers a large number of\r\ninstitutes, libraries, buildings, etc. will be vacated. I do not deem\r\nit wise to place all these accommodations at the disposal of the new\r\ntheological faculties connected with these mergers. The necessity will\r\nprobably arise of dealing specially with each separate case according\r\nto the circumstances. Here I would also like to request that you\r\nconsult me when making decisions.\r\n\r\n3. Above all, I request that you keep me continually informed regarding\r\nthe individual arrangements to be carried out by you in order that\r\nI be able to inform the party offices interested and especially the\r\nappropriate Gau administration, which is mainly concerned, in time.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  I.V.

Bormann\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 129-PS\r\n\r\n  Reich Minister Kerrl\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 8, 6 September 1939\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Stapel!\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of 31 August and in no wise neglected your\r\nmemorandum on the situation of the Evangelical Church in Germany, but\r\nread it through immediately. I must tell you that I agree with the\r\nportrayal of the situation down to the last word, although I must\r\nassume that the \"inflation of principles\" is also aimed at me. However\r\nthat did not annoy me, I understand your idea rather completely. So\r\nthat you understand me too, I want to continue your memorandum with my\r\nreasons. You close with the absolutely correct conclusion:\r\n\r\nThe State should neither combat existing religion nor introduce a new\r\nreligion. It should allow Christianity to prove by itself that it still\r\nhas vital force. It should confine itself to spiritual affairs and only\r\nexercise compulsion in the production of a legal and administrative\r\nunity of the Evangelical Church.\r\n\r\nCorrect!\r\n\r\nMy action is determined however by the following situation:\r\n\r\nAs you know from the speech of the Fuehrer in the Reichstag on 30\r\nJanuary 1939, every power in exercising compulsion in the production\r\nof a legal and administrative unity of the Evangelical Church was\r\ncompletely withdrawn from me. The Fuehrer considers his efforts\r\nto bring the Evangelical Church to reason, unsuccessful and the\r\nEvangelical Church with respect to its condition rightfully a useless\r\npile of sects. As you emphasize the Party has previously carried on\r\nnot only a fight against the political element of the Christianity of\r\nthe Church, but also a fight against membership of Party Members in a\r\nChristian confession.\r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that in this situation it can very easily eventuate\r\nthat the \"Organization of German Understanding of the Christian\r\nReligion Through Luther\" will collapse of its own accord, if, as in\r\nAustria and in the Sudetan Gau, the privileges, namely of collecting\r\ntaxes and state subsidies are entirely removed from the Evangelical\r\nChurch. If it comes to that then from the collapse of the organization\r\nof the Evangelical Church the advantage will redound not to the\r\nState but to the Catholic Church which cannot receive a mortal blow\r\nthrough such measures in its well-aimed unified, basically political\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church will and must, according to the law under which it\r\nis set up, remain a thorn in the flesh of a Racial State. An effective\r\ncombatting of it cannot ensue from a State which thanks to its secure\r\nideological basis desires and must refrain from every intervention\r\ninto religious things. The National Socialistic State can therefore\r\nput nothing positive or new in the place of that which it must perhaps\r\ndestroy and from the collapsing Evangelical Church the people somewhat\r\ndeceived about their religion would in large numbers stream into the\r\nCatholic Church, and this Church would then divide the people into two\r\nmutually hostile groups in a much more regrettable manner than has\r\nhappened through the confessions.\r\n\r\nIn addition every negative struggle, which cannot in a positive manner\r\nreplace that which has been destroyed, is anyhow condemned to failure.\r\n\r\nIn this factual situation I see an unheard of danger for the religious\r\npeace of the German people approaching and, all my efforts--you will\r\nunderstand that--have previously been only directed at eliminating this\r\ndanger. But that is only possible if the Party learns to distinguish in\r\nthe clearest manner between religion and ideology and thus, as Luther\r\nestablished and Kant scientifically proved, realizes, that ideology\r\nmust limit itself to the area of experience, where alone reason can\r\nbecome knowledge. It must further realize that knowledge based on\r\nreason alone cannot satisfy the human being here on earth, but, that\r\nhe (the human being) according to the structure of the \"world of\r\nfreedom within himself\", or let us say, according to \"the Kingdom of\r\nGod within himself\" cannot overcome the compelling moral necessity to\r\nattain certainty concerning the essence of God. The human being is now\r\nno \"_purely moral being_\", but the torture and the happiness of his\r\nearthly life consists in moving about in flesh and blood. Therefore\r\nhowever we have power over the inevitable weakness of not always being\r\nable to harmonize moral thought and deed. To be sure we do not need\r\nto be ashamed of original sin or to find our body despicable, for it,\r\nand thereby original sin is from God and we are no gods, but human\r\nbeings. But how could we, who must believe in the moral importance of\r\nour life and the world, get along, because we without being sure of our\r\nimmortality would not be able to yield our bodily life in fulfillment\r\nof our duty itself, without a religion going beyond the boundaries\r\nof reason? How could we who ourselves are righteous, doubt the fact\r\nthat God must be just, and how could we demand of him the all-knowing,\r\nwho knows our thoughts, that he confer on us immortality, if our\r\nrighteousness condemns the one whom it recognizes as acting against his\r\nbetter moral conviction. Our life here on earth would be senseless,\r\nif we could find out nothing about the true essence of God, if we\r\nwere not in some way certain that it is not righteousness but divine\r\nlove. But we cannot find it out through knowledge based on reason, but\r\nonly by the power of faith which we can get for ourselves through the\r\npersonality of Christ, therefore from the true Christian religion, for\r\nwhich in no wise is the presentation of the priests standard, but only\r\nChrist himself.\r\n\r\nThe \"Foundation of the Religion of Christ\" rests in our own inner\r\nbeing. The Evangelical Church of today has not been able to lead us to\r\nthis real \"Religion of Christ\". This Religion of Christ is only to be\r\ngrasped if not only the genius of a Luther, but everybody has learned\r\nto distinguish the domains of reason and faith. It depends neither on\r\nsacred orders nor on sacraments, but one finds the way to it only if\r\none has learned to doubt reason, as this reason has most accurately\r\nbecome acquainted with its magnitude and its narrow boundaries, and\r\nonly Priests who have grasped that with reason and heart, can penetrate\r\nfrom pseudo-priesthood to the true priesthood and thus fill the hearts\r\nof the people with true faith.\r\n\r\nTherefore for 15 years I have been working on a book which explains\r\nto everybody the scientific basis of National Socialism in such a way\r\nthat one learns to recognize the extent and the boundaries of reason as\r\nwell as of ideology and the necessity of the religion of Christ, and\r\ncomprehends, that in this area Party and State can do only one thing:\r\nto completely take one's own position and to renounce any claim to a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nI believe I can finish this work at this time; its publication however\r\nwill not be possible until the return of peace.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order that meanwhile these conclusions mentioned above\r\nwhich would lead to the destruction of the organization of the\r\nEvangelical Church, might not occur, it was my most important job to\r\nsee to it that today's pile of sects in the Evangelical Church would\r\nconsolidate of their own accord into an organ at least filled with a\r\ndesire for unity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as I was no longer allowed to issue orders under the State\r\nI tried again and again to exercise influence on the district church\r\nleaders even though they seemed to be powerless according to your\r\nstatements approved by me in your memorandum, at least to create\r\nthis condition for the possibility of preserving the organization of\r\nthe Lutheran Church. These efforts have at least reached a certain\r\nconclusion and become fruitful to such an extent that it was possible\r\nto aim at a unity among them over three men, who as a confidential\r\ncouncil of the church chancellery now possess the possibility of\r\nfinding _by positive work_ confidence of the people who feel united in\r\nthe Evangelical Church.\r\n\r\nIf these men, Bishop Mardahrens, Bishop Schultz of Mecklenburg and\r\nOberkonsistorialrat Hymmen apprehend the commandment of the hour, then\r\nby positive work they can line up the direction of the Evangelical\r\nChurch with the goals desired by me into a complete legal and\r\nadministrative unity. If they do not understand how to direct this\r\npositive work correctly, then both of us will have to bury the hope of\r\na preservation of the organization of the Lutheran Church, because only\r\nthe success of such a work can give the Fuehrer the justification of\r\ngiving us full power in the direction desired by us.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine that I would much prefer to see you among these three\r\nmen, because I would then know that the work was being actively and\r\nsuccessfully lined up with the goal jointly desired by both of us.\r\nHowever I shall pursue this aim with all the energy in my power as long\r\nas I am in my job and the decision of the Fuehrer gives me approval or\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nThese are difficult times into which our people are now entering, but\r\nI believe that Providence even here has correctly guided everything.\r\nIt has through the Fuehrer created for conditions for the inevitable\r\nbattle, as they cannot be found more favorable. If the German people\r\nmaintain themselves--and what justifies us in doubting it--everything\r\nmust come to a good and victorious end, and thereby would be created\r\njust the proper condition for the extension of the Third Reich\r\nexternally in tranquil safety and in well-aimed work at home, but\r\nthen would be created just the right soil for the possibility of\r\nnationalistic church work in the congregations, which you rightfully\r\nconsider the most important thing.\r\n\r\nPlease be convinced that I am always happy to think of you and rejoice\r\nat every communication from you.\r\n\r\nI know that you are a man who has already accomplished extraordinary\r\nthings for the spiritual enlightenment of the German people and I am\r\nconvinced that you will still accomplish in the future fruitful things\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\nI need not emphasize to you that this letter is confidential. However,\r\nI shall make accessible to the Confidential Council copies of your\r\nsplendid memorandum as well as copies of this letter for confidential\r\ncognizance. I would be especially glad if in the near future I found\r\nthe opportunity to discuss orally with Reich Minister Hess your\r\nmemorandum and my answer.\r\n\r\nWith hearty greetings and with\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Yours\r\n  [Signed] Kerrl\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 131-PS\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKER'S PARTY\r\n\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n  Munich, 12 December 1939 Brown House\r\n  III--So./Eis. 3230/0\r\n\r\n To: The Deputy of the Fuehrer for the supervision of the complete\r\n mental and doctrinal training and education of the NSDAP Reich Leader\r\n A.

The planned spiritual battle against\r\nthese powers was declared essential to the war effort by the Fuehrer.\r\nFor this purpose, the Fuehrer has ordered, among other things, that\r\nthe \"Special Purpose Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg for the occupied\r\nareas\" should be authorized in the occupied areas under military\r\nadministration and in the occupied Eastern territories under civil\r\nadministration--exclusive of the General Government--to\r\n\r\n_a._ Search libraries, archives, lodges, and other philosophical and\r\ncultural institutions of all kinds, for material suitable to the\r\naccomplishment of his task, and to have this material seized.\r\n\r\n_b._ To cause the seizure of cultural goods which are owned by Jews, or\r\nwithout ownership, or the owner of which cannot readily be determined.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Reich minister of the occupied Eastern territories has\r\nestablished on 12/6/1942 a \"Central Office for the seizure and\r\nsafe-keeping of cultural goods in the occupied Eastern Territories.\"\r\nDisregarding exceptional cases, in which the safeguarding of endangered\r\ncultural goods is urgent, it is desired to keep these goods in place\r\nfor the present. This has been agreed upon, according to the agreement\r\nreached between Armed Forces High Command General Staff of the General\r\nHeadquarters, and the Special Purpose Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n_d._ In the Eastern Theatre of operations, also such cultural goods as\r\ndo not fall under §_b_--especially museum pieces--are to be concealed,\r\nrespectively safeguarded, to save them from damage or destruction.\r\n\r\nFor the accomplishment of the missions named in I_a_, _b_ and _c_, the\r\n\"Special Purpose Staff Reichsleiter Rosenberg\" employs special units.\r\nWith the consent of Reichsleiter Rosenberg, the deployment of these\r\nspecial units is regulated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For the central steering of the Special Units, according to need, a\r\ndelegate of the Special Purpose Staff of Reichsleiter is employed, who\r\nis director of the Special Units in the Army Group area, respectively\r\nthe Army area. This man is obligated to inform the Supreme Commander\r\nof the Army Group respectively Army in time, of the directives he\r\nhas received from Reichsleiter Rosenberg or from the staff leader.\r\nThe Supreme Commander is authorized to give the delegate directives\r\nwhich are necessary to avoid disturbing the operations. These\r\ndirectives supersede all others. The delegates depend upon steady and\r\nclose co-operation with the G-2 (Intelligence Officer). The Special\r\nUnit authorities can demand the furnishing of a liaison man by the\r\ndelegate to the G-2. The G-2 has to coordinate, the missions of\r\nthe Special Purpose Units with the military intelligence [Abwehr]\r\nand the secret field police. For the cooperation with the defense\r\nofficers, respectively defense offices, the decisions reached in the\r\ntalks between Special Purpose Staff Rosenberg and Armed Forces High\r\nCommand/Foreign intelligence, will apply.\r\n\r\n2. The Special Units of Reichsleiter Rosenberg carry out their work\r\nin their own responsibility and according to the directives given by\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n3. For the accomplishment of the missions described in I_a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, the Special Units Reichsleiter Rosenberg have the right to\r\nsearch buildings in the theater of operations for relevant material\r\nand confiscate it. The secret field police is to be informed of the\r\nconfiscations. The secret field police furnishes official aid to the\r\nSpecial Units if necessary.\r\n\r\n4. The demarcation line between the working territory of the Special\r\nUnits Reichsleiter Rosenberg and the Special Units of the Chief of\r\nthe Security Police and the security service is regulated by direct\r\nagreement between both service offices.\r\n\r\n5. _a._ The Special Units belong to the Armed Forces. They wear brown\r\nuniforms with the swastika insignia.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Special Units have a strength of 20-25 men, their clothes and\r\nequipment, together with a corresponding number of vehicles, is secured\r\nby the Special Purpose Staff, Reichsleiter Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Special Units are always subordinated, to the service branches\r\nto which they are attached for the execution of their mission, with\r\nrespect to care, march, accommodation and rations.\r\n\r\n_d._ The members of the Special Units are identified by a\r\n\"service-book\" of the Special Purpose Staff Reichsleiter Rosenberg,\r\nwhich corresponds to the pay-book. This service-book is to contain\r\nalways the rank of the owner. It is further noted there, how the owner\r\nis to be treated in comparison (E.M., NCO, Officer). The service\r\nbranch, which receives a Special Purpose Unit, has to certify on a\r\nspecial sheet, provided for this purpose by the service office, the\r\nfact and duration of the deployment with this branch as members of the\r\nArmed Forces. The service-book counts as identity card.\r\n\r\n_e._ The Special Units are eligible for medical care. They are to be\r\nvaccinated according to the orders given to the Army.\r\n\r\n_f._ Distribution of a fuel contingent is always to be arranged with\r\nthe chief quartermaster of the Army with which a special unit is\r\nplaced. Vehicles are to be cared for by the H.K.P.\r\n\r\n_g._ Field postal service of the Special Units during movement, is\r\ncarried by way of the field post number of the service branch which has\r\na Special Unit attached. By transformation to long, permanent work,\r\napplication for their own field post number can be made with the army\r\nfield postmaster concerned.\r\n\r\n_h._ Under priority of military necessity the Special Units have the\r\nright to use Armed Forces telephone and telegraph lines forward,\r\nand, when possible also to the rear. Within the area of the military\r\nadministrations, connection with the Armed Forces telephone net is to\r\nbe made possible.\r\n\r\n_i._ With regard to the use of means of transportation, the rules\r\ndecreed for the army also apply to the Special Units. Armed Forces\r\ndriving licenses are to be furnished by the service branch, to which a\r\nSpecial Unit is attached.\r\n\r\nIt is to be made certain, that the above regulations are always made\r\nknown to the commanding authorities, which receive Special Units for\r\ndeployment.\r\n\r\nThe Special Units Reichsleiter Rosenberg are to be supported in every\r\nway in the execution of their mission. Particularly, insofar as\r\noperations permit, deployment directly with the fighting troops is to\r\nbe made possible.\r\n\r\nIV. Independent of the missions of the Special Units Reichsleiter\r\nRosenberg, in accordance with paragraph I_a_, _b_, _c_, the troops and\r\nall military service offices employed in the theater of operations,\r\nare directed to save valuable art monuments whenever possible, and\r\nsafeguard them from destructions or damages.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary safeguarding of cultural goods, museums etc. by\r\nthe troops and military service units under subsequent agreement,\r\nrespectively yield to Special Units Reichsleiter Rosenberg, wins\r\nparticular significance in the occupied Eastern territories where, in\r\ncontrast to the West and South East no organizations for the protection\r\nof art have been designated by Armed Forces High Command/General Staff\r\nof the Army/Generals' Quarters.\r\n\r\nBy direction\r\n\r\n  /s/ Wagner\r\n\r\n _Distribution_\r\n\r\n All High Commands of the Army Groups with signal co's\r\n [Nachrichtenabteilung] 5; each for all field commanders of the Army\r\n territory.\r\n\r\n All Army High Commands and Panzer Army High Commands with signal\r\n co's [Nachrichtenabteilung] each, Staff Don with 3 signal co's\r\n [Nachrichtenabteilungen].\r\n\r\n Military Commander in France, Paris\r\n Military Commander in Belgium  and Northern France, Brussels\r\n Army Territory (W.B.)

This\r\nmaterial is derived from Jewish property, now centrally collected to\r\nserve the research, doctrine and education of the German people.\r\n\r\nThe most significant book-collections today belonging to the stock\r\nof the \"Library for exploration of the Jewish question\", are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. The library of the _Alliance Israelite Universelle_. Among the\r\napproximately _40,000 volumes_ of this library from Paris (mainly\r\nJudaica and Hebraica) are numerous volumes of magazines, voluminous\r\npamphlet material, a very detailed literature and collection of\r\nclippings from newspapers regarding the affair Dreyfus, about 200\r\nHebrew manuscripts and 30 manuscripts in other languages, about 20\r\nincunabula.\r\n\r\n2. The stock of the _Ecole Rabbinique_ consists mostly of Judaica and\r\nHebraica, altogether about _10,000 volumes_. The Jewish texts of this\r\nRabbi-school in Paris offers valuable Talmud-material and complete\r\nmagazine series.\r\n\r\n3. The library of the _Federation de Societe des Juifs de France_\r\n(about _4000 volumes_) contains besides general literature about Jewry\r\nmostly Russian literature about the Jewish question.\r\n\r\n4. The stock of the Jewish bookstore in Paris _Lipschuetz_ (about\r\n_20,000 volumes_) contains in its most valuable part bibliographical\r\nworks, Hebraica and so on.\r\n\r\n5. The various collections from former property of the _Rothschilds_\r\nof Paris generally are of no more than common interest, but they also\r\nshow that the various members of the Rothschild family collected Jewish\r\nliterature for their own orientation. The collections in question are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n _a._ Collection _Edouard Rothschild_ (about _6,000 volumes_)\r\n\r\n _b._ Collection _Edouard and Guy Rothschild_ (about _3,000 volumes_)\r\n\r\n _c._ Collection _Maurice Rothschild_ (about _6,000 volumes_)\r\n\r\n _d._ Collection _Robert Rothschild_ (about _10,000 volumes_)\r\n\r\n _e._ Collection of the Rothschild family from hunting lodge\r\n _Armainvilliers_ (about _3,000 volumes_)\r\n\r\nThese Rothschild collections contain, besides the valuable book stock,\r\nimportant archive material which gives information on connections\r\nbetween Jews and non-Jews in France and abroad. In this connection it\r\nshould be mentioned that the district office Frankfurt/Main also is in\r\npossession of the archives of the last 100 years of the Parisian bank\r\nof Rothchild (760 boxes).\r\n\r\n6. The _Rosenthaliana_ from Amsterdam with _20,000 volumes_ (mostly\r\nGerman language literature on the Jewish question).\r\n\r\n7. The library of the _Sefardic Jewish community in Amsterdam_ with\r\nabout _25,000 volumes_ (mostly Hebraica).\r\n\r\n8. The large amount of books secured in the _occupied eastern\r\nterritories_ (prevalent Soviet-Jewish and Polish-Jewish literature,\r\nvoluminous Talmud literature) are from collecting points in Riga,\r\nKauen, Wilna, Minsk and Kiev (about _280,000 volumes_).\r\n\r\n9. Book collections from Jewish communities in _Greece_ (about _10,000\r\nvolumes_).\r\n\r\n10. Book material from a \"Sonderaktion\" in the Rhineland (collecting\r\npoint _Neuwied_) with about _5,000 volumes_.\r\n\r\n11. The book collections mentioned under 1-10 were turned over to the\r\nLibrary for Exploration of the Jewish Question by the Einsatzstab\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg and are constantly being filled up by new\r\nshipments from the Einsatzstab. Besides that, some 100,000 volumes\r\nwhich were obtained from other sources (finance offices and so on)\r\nby the district office, belong to the library for exploration of the\r\nJewish question. Therefore, the library for exploration of the Jewish\r\nquestions contains as of 1 April 1943:\r\n\r\nApproximately _550,000 volumes_ (about 3,300 book boxes) including 325\r\nboxes (approx. 24,000 volumes) earmarked for the district office but\r\nstill kept in Berlin with the Staff, and including approx. 220,000\r\nvolumes (about 650 boxes) prepared for shipment to Frankfurt/Main at\r\nthe various collecting points of the Einsatzstab and partly packed.\r\n\r\nIn detail, these stocks deposited in Berlin cover the material of the\r\nabove under Nos. 3, 5_b_, _d_ and _e_ mentioned libraries (about 17,000\r\nvolumes), furthermore parts of the collections mentioned under Nos.\r\n5_a_ and _c_ (about 7,000 volumes); all the books at the collecting\r\npoints ready for shipment to Frankfurt/Main cover the whole stock as\r\nthe collections mentioned under Nos. 6 and 7 (about 50,000 volumes),\r\npart of that material secured in the East (compare No. 8 above; there\r\nare in Minsk about 20,000 volumes, in Wilno about 50,000 volumes and in\r\nKiev about 100,000 volumes). The stocks mentioned here which are still\r\nin Berlin or at the collecting points, make up approximately another\r\n_240,000 volumes_. The district office in Frankfurt/Main has received\r\nso far approximately _300,000 volumes_ (about 2,325 boxes).\r\n\r\nOf these, approximately 2,325 book boxes which arrived at the library\r\nfor exploration of the Jewish question, were so far unpacked and put on\r\nbookshelves:\r\n\r\n 567 boxes of the Alliance Israelite Universelle (out of 656 boxes)\r\n\r\n 165 boxes of the Ecole Rabbinique (out of 243 boxes)\r\n\r\n 50 boxes of the book store Lipschuetz (out of 197 boxes)\r\n\r\n 84 boxes of the collection Edouard Rothschild (the remaining 75 boxes\r\n are still in Berlin)\r\n\r\n 23 boxes of the collection Maurice Rothschild (the remaining 39 boxes\r\n are still in Berlin)\r\n\r\n 159 boxes of the collection point Riga (the whole stock)\r\n\r\nThus 1,048 book boxes (about 150,000 volumes) were unpacked that is\r\nhalf of the book boxes, so far received in Frankfurt Main.\r\n\r\n27,848 volumes were catalogued in Frankfurt Main from 1 May 1941\r\n(beginning of cataloguing) to 31 March 1943 (catalogued according\r\nto authors and subjects). According to the same principle the new\r\npublication which were put into the library for the exploration of the\r\nJewish question since 1941, were catalogued--9,325 volumes.\r\n\r\nApart from the actual importance of the Jewish question, the library\r\nfor the research of the Jewish question assumes a high position in the\r\nrealm of German libraries with its present collection of about 550,000\r\nvolumes because this Frankfurt library could be brought to such a\r\ndegree of completeness as regards the literature on the Jewish question\r\nas never before in Europe or elsewhere. In the New Order of Europe\r\nOrganization _the_ library for the Jewish question not only for Europe\r\nbut for the world will arise in Frankfurt am Main.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 176-PS\r\n\r\nREPORT\r\n\r\nOn the activities of the Einsatzstab of the Bureau of the Reichsleiter\r\nRosenberg in the occupied Western Territories and The Netherlands.\r\nWorking Group Netherland\r\n\r\nThe Working Group Netherland of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\nbegan its work in agreement with the competent representative of the\r\nReichskommissar during the first days of September, 1940. The execution\r\nof the past, conforming with the Fuehrer's orders, coordinated itself\r\nwith the liquidation, that is confiscation, according to civil law, of\r\nthe various subversive institutions--as set forth in the circulars of\r\nthe OKW (A2 Nr. 2850/40g Adj. Chief OKW), dated 5 July 1940, and of the\r\nChief of the OKW to the Commander in Chief of the Wehrmacht in France\r\n(2 f 28.14WZ Nr. 3812/40g) dated 17 September 1940, as well as to the\r\nCommander in Chief of the OKW in the Netherlands. (Az 2 f 28 J (IA) Nr.\r\n1338 40g) dated 30 October 1940.

Furthermore, everything the temple of the lodge\r\nin Nijmegen and the temple of the I.O. O.F. in Haarlem contained, was\r\nsent to Germany. Also, steel-shelves for about 30,000 books were taken\r\nfrom the building belonging to the Grooten Oosten in Den Haag where\r\nthey have so far been used for the Bibliotheka Klossiana, containing\r\nparts of one library of the Grooten Oosten, and the library of the\r\nVrijmetselar-Stichting, Amsterdam, are of great value. And so are\r\nthe archives of the Grooten Oosten in Den Haag, containing all the\r\nhistorical documents of the lodges affiliated with the Grooten Oosten.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the value of the Bibliotheka Klossiana, containing many\r\nrare pieces, it is to be remembered that in 1930 the Grooten Oosten\r\nder Nederlande was offered $5,000,000 for the Bibliotheka Klossiana by\r\nFreemasons in the U.S.\r\n\r\nA particularly valuable discovery was made by the working group\r\nsearching the altars in the building of the Grooten Oosten in Den Haag.\r\nThe Master-Hammer of the Grooten Oosten, made of pure gold, with which\r\nsome of its members had presented to the Grooten Oosten on its 60th\r\nAnniversary, fell into our hands. It is a piece of high quality whose\r\nmoney-value alone is estimated to be 3,000 Reichsmark.\r\n\r\nThe Working Group took over the International Institute for Social\r\nHistory in Amsterdam with its library and archives, boxes of\r\nextraordinary value. It seems that this institute was founded in 1934\r\nwith the intention of creating a center of intellectual resistance\r\nagainst National Socialism. Its employees were mainly Jewish refugees\r\nfrom Germany. The contents of its library and its archives with many\r\nvery valuable items were brought together from all over the world. In\r\nthe library, there are about 160,000 volumes, though most of them will\r\nhave to be catalogued. Of particular interest is the German, French\r\nand Russian Department. According to the decision made by Reichsleiter\r\nRosenberg, the Institute was taken over in its entirety. A member of\r\nthe Dienstelle was nominated as director of the Institute--he, together\r\nwith his collaborators will arrange the books, catalogue the scientific\r\nmaterial and get the Institute ready for the work of the Party. What\r\nmay be said already is that the scientific value of the library and the\r\narchives is that they contain a complete collection of material on the\r\nsocial and socialist movements in certain countries.\r\n\r\nThe libraries of the Societas Spinozana in Den Haag and of the\r\nSpinoza-House in Rijnsburg also were packed. Packed in 18 cases, they,\r\ntoo, contain extremely valuable early works of great importance for\r\nthe exploration of the Spinoza problem. Not without reason did the\r\nDirector of the Societas Spinozana try, under false pretenses which we\r\nuncovered, to withhold the library from us.\r\n\r\nThen the library of the Alliance Francaise, Den Haag, was packed (6\r\ncases) as well as the German publication of the refugee-publishers\r\nAller de Lange, Querido, Fischer-Beerman, Forum-Zeek, of the Kultura\r\nBookshop and the publications of the Pegasus-Verlag, all in Amsterdam,\r\na total of 17 cases. After that, the Working Group concentrated\r\non packing the newspaper and magazine stocks of the International\r\nInstitute for Social History. The very exclusive racks which had been\r\nbrought together from all over the world were kept at the Institute\r\nin complete disorder and left to self-destruction; they were properly\r\npacked into 776 cases and stored, for the time being, in the Working\r\nGroup's store-houses. It is very strongly suggested that these\r\nnewspapers and magazines be bound and the volumes be put up in proper\r\nlibraries as fast as possible; otherwise, an irreparable loss will be\r\nthe result since these newspapers and magazines are from all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA large unknown amount of material classified as \"Enemy Goods\" and\r\ncoming from the so-called \"Overseas-Gifts\", that is, household goods of\r\nJewish refugees, is falling into our hands daily. These gifts are being\r\nkept at the so-called \"House in Holland\", and so far 43 cases were\r\npacked there, including the private library of the former Minister of\r\nthe Eisner-Government, Neurath.\r\n\r\nIn agreement with the Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht in the\r\nNetherlands, all libraries in houses of Jewish refugees and confiscated\r\nby the Wehrmacht, are being turned over to the Working Group. So far,\r\nthe library of the Jew De Cat in Haarlem was packed into 4 cases.\r\n\r\nAn extremely valuable library, containing inestimable works in\r\nSanskrit, was confiscated when the Theosophic Society in Amsterdam was\r\ndissolved, and packed into 96 cases.\r\n\r\nA number of smaller libraries belonging to the Spiritists, Esperanto\r\nMovement, the Bellamy Movement, the International Biblical Research\r\nand various other minor international organizations were packed into\r\n7 cases; texts belonging to various minor Jewish organizations were\r\npacked into 4 cases, and a library of the Anthroposophic Society in\r\nAmsterdam into three.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the racks of books confiscated, packed and\r\nso far sent to Germany by the Working Group are of extraordinary\r\nscientific value and shall contribute an integral part of the library\r\nof the \"Hohe Schule.\" The money-value of these libraries, as shown in\r\nthe case of the \"Klossiana\", can only be estimated, but surely amount\r\nto 30-40,000,000 Reichsmark.\r\n\r\nFor the coming months, action is planned on the following, enumerated\r\nhere in chronological order:\r\n\r\n1. The libraries of the Theosophic Society and similar organizations in\r\nDen Haag, Rotterdam and several other places.\r\n\r\n2. Continuous sifting of objects confiscated in the \"House in Holland\"\r\nand other buildings.\r\n\r\n3. Screening of several archives with Press-photos, consisting\r\naltogether of 2.6 million pictures which shall be turned over to us by\r\nthe Reichskommissariat.\r\n\r\n4. The Jewish private libraries in Amsterdam, particularly:\r\n\r\nA. The Israelite Library Beth-Hamidrasch Etz Chaim, Amsterdam,\r\nRapenburgerstraat 109. This library, founded in 1740, contains about\r\n4,000 volumes, particularly Jewish theology.\r\n\r\nB. Library of the Netherland Israelite Seminar, Amsterdam,\r\nRapenburgerstraat 177. It contains 4,300 volumes of Hebraica and 2,000\r\nvolumes Judaica. At the time, it took over the library of the Jewish\r\nSociety for Literature, Thoelet (1830-1837) and valuable Jewish private\r\ncollections. Amongst other things, it contains precious old prints from\r\nthe years 1480 to 1560 and some manuscripts.\r\n\r\nC. The Portuguese-Israelite Seminar, Amsterdam, Jonas Daniel Meyerplein\r\n5. There are 25,000 volumes, 450 manuscripts, 600 prints [Inkunablen]\r\nand numerous Exlibris, coins and the like and the famous material on\r\nTalmud Literature.\r\n\r\nD. The so-called Rosentaliana, primarily a foundation by the Jew\r\nRosenthal from Hannover. From there, it was at the time transferred and\r\naffiliated with the local university library. In the meantime, it has\r\non account of donations, grown considerably. Technically, it belongs to\r\nthe Municipality of Amsterdam, but in the Catalogue of Libraries in the\r\nNetherlands of 1931, it is designated as \"Private\". According to the\r\ncatalogue, it contains 25,000 volumes and 300 manuscripts. However, the\r\namount of volumes reaches 100,000 indeed.\r\n\r\nThe libraries mentioned under 4. ought to be of particular interest for\r\nthe history of Western Europe. It is very likely that hitherto unknown\r\nfacts may be brought into the open, on the era of Cromwell and that\r\nof the glorious Revolution of 1688 and the resulting personal union\r\nbetween England and the Netherlands. In particular, light may be thrown\r\non Cromwell's attitude towards the Jews, possibly even on the Jewish\r\ninfluence on the development of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe temple and the museum of the Grooten Oosten der Nederlande. At\r\npresent, both are needed for exhibitions on behalf of the Dienststelle\r\nof the Reichskommissar. With the end of the exhibition temple\r\nfurnishings and museum shall be turned over to us.\r\n\r\nA very conservative estimate of the value of the objects enumerated\r\nin 1. to 5. may be about three times as much as that of the libraries\r\nalready packed. Therefore, it is safe to say that the library of the\r\nHohe Schule shall, with very little effort, receive an extraordinary\r\namount of treasures which shall give it a unique position in the realm\r\nof questions regarding Judaism and Free-Masonism.\r\n\r\nThe Working Group, in executing the afore-mentioned tasks is bound\r\nstrictly to the pace set by the Reichskommissar for the handling of\r\nthe Jewish questions and that of the international organizations. This\r\npace again is determined by the political evolution which is taking\r\nshape according to decisions made on a higher level, and which must\r\nnot be hampered by individual acts. Work that has been authorized\r\nto be done by the Working Group, but has not yet been accomplished\r\nshould now, with twice as much personnel as before, be finished within\r\n2 to 3 months. It may be mentioned that the Working Group has been\r\nworking overtime for weeks now, and also is working, as is done on the\r\nbattlefield, on Sundays.\r\n\r\n  The leader of the Working Group Netherland.\r\n\r\n  Schimmer\r\n  Oberbereichsleiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 197-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 27 August 1941.\r\n\r\n  Notes\r\n\r\n Concerning the conference that has taken place on the OKH concerning\r\n the transfer of a part of the Ukraine to the civil administration.\r\n\r\nOn 25.8.1941, a conference took place in headquarters OKH/\r\nQuartermaster General regarding preparation for the transfer of the\r\nReich Commissary of the Ukraine to the civil administration scheduled\r\nto take place on 1.9.41.\r\n\r\nBesides myself and the expert of the Q.M. General, the following took\r\npart in the conference:\r\n\r\n  Major i. G. Altenstadt      Chairman\r\n\r\n  Ministerialdirigent Dr.     Chief of the Administrative\r\n    Danckwarts                  Branch within the Army Administrative\r\n                                Group.\r\n\r\n  Colonel i. G. von Krosigk   Chief of the General Staff of\r\n                                the commander of the southern\r\n                                Army Zone Rear.\r\n\r\n  Chief of Staff of the\r\n    Commander of the Office\r\n    of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n  Regierungspraesident\r\n  Dargs                       Representative of Reich Commissar\r\n                                Koch.\r\n\r\n  Oberregierungsrat Dr.\r\n    Labs\r\n\r\n  Captain Dr. Braeutigam....  Representative of the Ministry\r\n                                for the East.\r\n\r\n  Major Wagner.\r\n\r\nThe letter first explained the boundaries of the Reich Commissariat\r\nUkraine as of the 1.9.41. In Bessarabia and Bukovinia Rumania is in\r\naccord with the O.K.W. and has already set up the civil administration,\r\nalthough until now there has been no official surrender of the area\r\nto Rumania. The official assignment to the Rumanian administration\r\nis expected in the next few days. The area around Brest is still at\r\npresent, under the military commander of the General Government; the\r\nremainder of the Reich Commissariat Ukraine is under the commander of\r\nthe Southern Army Zone Rear. At the time that a civil administration\r\nwas inaugurated on the 1.9.1941, these areas (which apply to the\r\nmilitary sector) were transferred to the jurisdiction of the commander\r\nof the Wehrmacht in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe area to be transferred is for the most part pacified. Only in the\r\nregion of the Pripet Marshes is there still unrest produced by Partisan\r\ngroups. The rather strong forces there at present of the Southern Army\r\nZone Rear have been concentrated and recently destroyed 8 out of 10\r\nPartisan battalions (strength of each battalion approximately 100 men).\r\nShould the Partisans not be wholly liquidated by the 1.9.1941, forces\r\nof the above mentioned commander will remain in the area for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe security of the part of the Reich Commissary Ukraine to be set\r\nup on the 1.9.1941, will be carried out in the south by a Hungarian\r\nDivision (2 brigades), connected in the north with a Slovakian security\r\ndivision besides 4 battalions of militia. All units, including the\r\nHungarian and Slovakians are under the command of the commander of\r\nthe Wehrmacht. In the area are two district commands and five town\r\ncommands, and the district commands are in Luck and Kamenez-Podolsk.\r\nThe units of the transport and intelligence services remain directly\r\nunder the command of the O.K.W. Furthermore the economic inspection\r\nof the south remains with the commander of the Army Zone Rear. The\r\neconomic command in Kiev placed under this inspection has its seat for\r\nthe time being in Shitomir. This command is responsible for the civil\r\nadministration in the whole area to be transferred.\r\n\r\nNear Kamenez-Podolsk, the Hungarians have pushed about 11,000 Jews\r\nover the border. In the negotiations up to the present it has not been\r\npossible to arrive at any measures for the return of these Jews. The\r\nhigher SS and Police leader (SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Jeckeln) hopes,\r\nhowever, to have completed the liquidation of these Jews by the\r\n1.9.1941.\r\n\r\nMinisterialdirigent Dr. Danckwarts asserts that both district\r\ncommands have confined themselves to the fulfilment of all the most\r\nnecessary projects in the administrative field. In the communities\r\nfor the most part Volksdeutsche or Ukrainians have been placed in\r\noffice as Burgermeister. According to experiences up to date these\r\npeople are scarcely in a position to administer to their communities\r\nindependently, but require in every single case instruction and\r\nguidance from the German units.\r\n\r\nColonel von Krosigk states that the military units in many towns of the\r\nregion have set up a Ukrainian militia, which it is agreed would now be\r\ntaken over by the higher SS and Police leader as auxiliary police.\r\n\r\nIn this militia strong efforts for independence have been noticed since\r\nthis militia is in part composed of active elements (members of the\r\nBandera National independentist movement). The populace is in general\r\nobliging but wholly intimidated and uneasy. They have made themselves\r\ndeserving by their searching for Russian paratroopers who were dropped\r\nalmost every night by the Russians, especially around the main railroad\r\nlines. These paratroops are harmless, since they are badly armed and\r\ninstructed. They are for the most part in civilian clothes. From the\r\ndirective for the treatment of the collective question great success in\r\nthe field of propaganda is promised in military circles.\r\n\r\nIn many Ukrainian districts the Ukrainians themselves have put their\r\nburgermeisters in office. These men had with them quantities of written\r\nmessages and statements from national Ukrainian parties. The Wehrmacht\r\nhas not recognized such people, but took the statements from them and\r\nsent them home again.\r\n\r\nThe administrative officials of the two district commands remains until\r\nthe 15.9.1941 at the district commands in order to assist the units by\r\ntheir familiarity with the civil administration, without their being\r\nengaged in the actual work of administration themselves. Particularly,\r\nKriegsverwaltungsrat Schwarz, one of the two administrative officials\r\nof the commander of the southern Army Zone Rear still remained in the\r\narea and would go to Rowno in case the civil administration should\r\ndesire it. The 454th division becomes the security division in the area\r\nof the Reich Commissariat insofar as the security was not taken over by\r\nthe Rumanians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a private conference between (Ministerialdirigent) Dr. Danckwarts,\r\n(Regierungspraesident) Darge, Captain Dr. Braeutigam and the\r\nundersigned, a few more administrative questions were briefly\r\ndiscussed. On this occasion (Ministerialdirigent) Dr. Danckwarts stated\r\nthat the Rumanians in the southern part of the Ukraine would take\r\nover as far as civil administration was concerned, the old borders of\r\nBessarabia, forming a zone as far as the Bug, including Odessa, without\r\nbeing promised the eventual possession of this zone.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with 15 divisions they would take over the security of a\r\nlarger portion of the Ukraine, which in this zone would be under the\r\ncontrol of the German civil administration.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dr. Braeutigam was requested by telephone by Dr. Koeppen at\r\nthe Fuehrer's Headquarters to be careful that the Rumanians should not\r\nform a Ukrainian group under a former military attache in Berlin in\r\nthe zone taken over by their civil administration. This question was\r\ndiscussed with Major Altenstadt in my presence. He explained that the\r\nWehrmacht has no administrative control in influencing the Rumanians\r\nin the zone under their civil administration; this could only be done\r\nthrough the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn discussion with several officers who had recently been in the\r\nUkraine, I learned that the prohibiting of army chaplains from\r\nconducting religious services for the civilian population and also the\r\nEthnic Germans [Volksdeutsche] has led to depression and disturbance\r\namong the Volksdeutsche. One should not fail to realize that the\r\nchurch has been the common connecting-link of the Volksdeutsche in the\r\nUkraine. Although not many Ukrainian clergy are present a few still\r\nhold religious services for the Ukrainians. The Volksdeutsche fail to\r\nunderstand why the only possibility of their caring for their souls,\r\nnamely through the agency of Army Chaplains, is denied to them.\r\n\r\n  LABS\r\n  Oberregierungsrat\r\n  [illegible]\r\n  Ministerialdirektor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 199-PS\r\n\r\n  COPY\r\n\r\n  Reichs Ministry for the Occupied East\r\n\r\n  Berlin 11 July 1944\r\n\r\n  Correspondence\r\n\r\n To the General Deputy for the Labor Employment, Gauleiter Sauckel\r\n\r\n _Berlin SW 11_\r\n\r\nI just learned that refugee camps for the White Russians in Bialystok,\r\nKrajewo and Olitai were closed for the recruiting for the war Einsatz\r\nCommand middle.

Contrary to all promises\r\nthese laborers were not released even after twelve months, and their\r\nvarious connections at home received no compensations. They did not\r\neven get a short furlough home for a long time. Now it is intended to\r\nput them in the munitions industry against their will.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1942 another recruiting was made by the Wehrmacht\r\nfor 7000 male transport-aides. They forced the Lithuanians to register\r\nat an office and then locked them up in barracks as they came in.\r\nNaturally they dislike the Germans almost as much as the Russians.\r\n\r\nRecently the recruiting drives for new volunteers for the army, police\r\nand labor service, and for laborers in the munitions industry within\r\nthe Reich have been started. However the Russians removed 40,000\r\nprofessional personnel in 1941, and more than 100,000 were removed from\r\nwork, so many positions cannot be filled now.\r\n\r\nAfter the recruiting campaigns the populace did not trust any further\r\nproclamations or measures as far as working within Germany was\r\nconcerned. Furthermore the Lithuanians do not feel that they have in\r\ntheir state a political unit. Because of previous unsettled political\r\nconditions, the Lithuanian does not think much about politics. Since he\r\npays little attention to his own laws, he heeds ours even less. They do\r\nnot attend the musterings and must be brought by the police.\r\n\r\nAlthough the civilian administration promised to produce the labor,\r\nthey were not too successful, as the following will show:\r\n\r\n1. _Seizure of the age classes of 1919/24_\r\n\r\nThis was ordered by the Reichs Commissar for the East, but due to the\r\ninefficiency of the officials, it was only partially successful.\r\n\r\nThe actual seizure was done by members of the Wehrmacht, police, local\r\nadministration and the labor office. Energetic propaganda campaigns\r\nwere initiated to induce the male members of the age groups to register\r\nat the designated offices.\r\n\r\nSoon however opposition arose on the part of the Lithuanian\r\nintelligentia. To counteract this the following measures were taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation]\r\n\r\nRenunciation of the formation of a Lithuanian legion, closing of the\r\nnative universities, and arresting of a number of members of the\r\nLithuanian intelligentia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translator's Synopsis]\r\n\r\nThese measures were not practicable; consequently the General Commissar\r\nordered another registering, with severe penalties for non-appearance.\r\nAlthough every effort was made, the results were still unsatisfactory.\r\nFrom an expected total enrolment of 5800 men, only 47% appeared, and\r\namong this percentage were many of no use to us for various reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation]\r\n\r\n2. The completely unsatisfactory experience of the previous action made\r\n_a further seizure of the age group 1912/18 and also of the female\r\nage group 1914/22_ necessary. These two further actions also brought\r\nno satisfactory result. In a lecture which the Plenipotentiary for\r\nthe Arbeitseinsatz Gauleiter Sauckel made on 18 July 1943 in Kauen,\r\nand in an official conference following it, between Gauleiter Sauckel\r\nand the General Commissar, the pool of labor in the Reich was again\r\nbrought up urgently; Gauleiter Sauckel again demanded that Lithuanian\r\nlabor be furnished in greater volume for the purposes of the Reich. As\r\nthe minutes of this conference show, the General Commissar described\r\nvery forcibly the very great difficulties opposing the preparation of\r\nindigenous labor forces, and asked urgently for the preparation of a\r\nlarger number of German police forces. SS-Obergruppenfuehrer von dem\r\nBach promised explicitly at that time \"a real strengthening of the\r\npolice force in Lithuania\". This real strengthening of the police force\r\nin Lithuania meanwhile was not carried out in the course of further\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translator's Synopsis]\r\n\r\n3. Sauckel wanted 30,000 workers. Although the civilian administration\r\ndid their best, conditions were in confusion and only 8200 of the\r\n30,000 were on hand.\r\n\r\n4. Then Sauckel made a new requisition, this time for 100,000 workers.\r\nAlthough fulfillment of this requisition would vacate many positions\r\nin the country, the General Commissar promised to fill the order.\r\nHowever, many difficulties will arise. In the country it is easier\r\nto recruit labor because it is possible to study the labor situation\r\nin more detail than in a large city like Kauen. In the country the\r\nadministration has a closer tie with the populace for one thing.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the requisition of labor made on Lithuania, assistance from\r\nthe German Civil Administration is a necessity. The police force will\r\nhave to be increased temporarily, severe treatment in case of sabotage,\r\na temporary increase in the allotment of motor fuel, and the use of the\r\nquartermaster facilities of the Wehrmacht; all these measures will be\r\nnecessary if the required amount of labor is to be supplied.\r\n\r\nThis new action of Sauckel's will probably not work. The only way of\r\ngaining any successes in this matter is to have at our disposal large\r\nnumbers of German police.\r\n\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 205-PS\r\n\r\nNational Socialist Labor Party\r\n\r\nParty Chancellory\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer's Headquarters 5 May 1943\r\n\r\n  The Chief of the Party Chancellory\r\n  Chancery Rosenberg\r\n  Admit.

There is an apparent practical\r\nresult in the employment within the Reich of millions of foreign\r\nworkers from almost all the European countries on the continent, in\r\naddition to a large number of members of the conquered forces of\r\nhostile nations. From this fact arise special obligations for the\r\nGerman people, which are submitted first of all in the following\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\n1. Of primary importance is the security of the Reich. The\r\nReichsfuehrer of the SS and his units settle all questions on measures\r\nof the security police for the protection of the Reich and the German\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n2. The humane, production-increasing treatment of the foreign workers\r\nand the facilities granted them can obviously lead to the effacement\r\nof the clear lines of demarcation between the workers of foreign\r\npeoples and members of the German race. It is demanded of members of\r\nthe German race that they observe the difference between themselves\r\nand foreign nationals as a patriotic duty. By disregarding the\r\nfundamental principles of the National Socialist conception of blood\r\n[Blutauffassung] a member of the German race must be aware of being\r\nliable to the severest penalties. The knowledge, that the outcome will\r\nbe either victory or a Bolshevist chaos, must cause every German to\r\ndraw the necessary conclusions in dealings with workers of foreign\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\nEverything is subordinated to the mission of ending the war\r\nvictoriously. The foreign workers employed within the Reich are to\r\nbe treated in such a manner that their reliability is retained and\r\nexpedited; that consequences unfavorable to the Reich be limited to a\r\nminimum in their home countries and that full labor be retained at a\r\nfuture date for the German war economy, yes, so that even a rise in\r\nproduction ensues. The following is to be regarded here as decided:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone even the primitive man, has a fine perception for justice!\r\nConsequently every unjust treatment must have a very bad effect.\r\nInjustices, insults, trickery, mistreatment etc. must be discontinued.\r\nPunishment by beating is forbidden. The workers of foreign nationality\r\nare to be correspondingly informed concerning the severe measures for\r\ninsubordinate and seditious elements.\r\n\r\n2. Winning someone to active cooperation for a new idea is impossible,\r\nif his innate consciousness of value is insulted at the same time.\r\nFrom people who are described as beasts, barbarians and sub-humans, no\r\ngreat accomplishment can be demanded: In contrast to all opportunities\r\nthat arise, positive characteristics such as the will to fight against\r\nBolshevism, security of their own existence and of their country,\r\nreadiness to enlist and the willingness to work, all are to be spurred\r\non and expedited.\r\n\r\n3. Moreover everything must be done in order to further the necessary\r\ncooperation of the European peoples in the struggle against Bolshevism.\r\nThe foreign worker is not to be convinced by words alone that a German\r\nvictory is also favorable for him and his people. Supposition is a\r\nsuitable treatment.\r\n\r\nDigressing from these view-points, the responsible plenipotentiaries\r\nfor Arbeitseinsatz responsible for the recruiting and the working\r\nconditions of the foreign laborers as well as the other bureaus\r\nconcerned, have issued the necessary directives for the employment\r\nof foreign laborers within the Reich. From these instructions the\r\nfollowing are especially to be stressed:\r\n\r\n_a._ If possible every foreign worker will receive a position for\r\nwhich he has the greatest ability according to his training and former\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n_b._ The quartering of foreign labor personnel is to be, as a rule, in\r\ncamps. The accommodations must be provided with all the necessities\r\nin respect to orderliness, cleanliness and sanitation. Measures of\r\nimprisonment such as confinement and barbwire are forbidden. It is\r\nespecially emphasized that in this quartering, the national customs\r\nof the foreign workers, (male and female) are to be given the utmost\r\nconsideration in conformation with the possibilities conditioned by\r\nwar. The foreigners are as much as possible divided into national\r\ngroups, and are to be quartered together. The assistance of the foreign\r\nworkers in the administration of the camp and the maintenance of\r\norder within the camp is to be secured. For all camps there are camp\r\ndirectives which outline in particular the duties and right of the camp\r\nand the leaders.\r\n\r\n_c._ At the time of enlistment the foreign workers are to be urged to\r\nbring clothing and foot gear with them to Germany. So far as this is\r\nnot possible and so far as it has become necessary to replace articles\r\nof clothing that have become unusable, they are to be provided with\r\nclothing and footgear, considering limitations imposed by war, so that\r\nthe necessary protection for the preservation of health against weather\r\nis guaranteed.\r\n\r\n_d._ The foreign workers are to receive, in reference to diet, the\r\nsame ration allowance as the German workers from the Reich Minister\r\nfor nutrition and agriculture. In this matter the usual cost will\r\nbe considered. Care will be taken that supplies are issued to the\r\nforeign workers in accordance with the numbers placed at their\r\ndisposal. Embezzlements, usurious prices etc. by supervisory bureaus or\r\nadministrative officers will be punished as if the act were committed\r\nagainst Germans.\r\n\r\n_e._ Every foreign worker has claim to efficient sanitation measures.\r\nThe regulations for prevention of epidemics and contagious diseases\r\nare not to be deviated from. Medical attention according to local\r\nconditions is to be assured by the doctors of the camp district or\r\ninsurance [Kasse]. For permanent treatment in districts or hospitals\r\nthe number of beds necessary are to be kept ready in a suitable\r\nmanner. For nursing and maintenance nursing personnel of the same\r\nnationality are if possible to be called up, and if circumstances\r\npermit doctors and army-surgeons of the same nationality. For pregnant\r\nworkers obstetrical necessities are to be provided; also peaceful\r\naccommodations and nurseries of suitable size are to be supplied.\r\nFemale members of the nationality concerned are to be used for care of\r\npatients. The return home [Rueckbefoerderungen] of pregnant workers is\r\nto take place only in extremely exceptional cases on the request of the\r\nparty concerned.\r\n\r\n_f._ Recreation for the foreign workers is of the greatest importance\r\nfor the conservation of working power and morale. Entertaining\r\norganizations, periods of free time, sports, etc. are of prime\r\nimportance in the camp itself and are to be carried on by camp\r\npersonnel. In addition, special performers and national groups of\r\nthe various nationalities are to be used for the further development\r\nof this recreation. In addition insofar as possible their own moving\r\npicture films will be presented. Furthermore books, periodicals and\r\nnewspapers translated into the various foreign languages are to be\r\navailable in every camp. Language courses are to promote understanding\r\nin the place of work. For the various nationalities special\r\ndictionaries are to be published.\r\n\r\nIn addition the workers from the East have at least the possibility of\r\ngoing out on their free day.\r\n\r\n_g._ For all foreign workers recreation is possible, insofar as it is\r\ndesired. For members of the Occupied Eastern Territories care only from\r\nlay-priests is considered. Care from Russian and Ukrainian emigrants is\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nIn case of death all foreigners will be buried in the public cemeteries.\r\n\r\n_h._ The political influence is directed mainly against Bolshevism and\r\nought to be molded accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned principles are considered binding as policies of\r\nconduct for all organizations, bureaus and personnel, since they have\r\nbeen published as directives by the respective bureaus. All units\r\nwhich are concerned with the employment and care of foreign workers\r\nand particularly factory and camp leaders, are responsible for these\r\nprinciples being put into practice and being adhered to. They must\r\nunderstand quite clearly that violations of the forgiving fundamentals\r\ndamage the German war economy and indirectly, the Front. Therefore they\r\nare not only punishable from the point of view of the non-political\r\ncrime (for example, assault, embezzlement, usury) but also can be\r\npunished for treasonable crimes. Not only the author of such an act\r\ncan be held responsible but also the responsible office chief. Also\r\ndefective instruction or supervision of subordinate offices can lead to\r\nan official punishment.\r\n\r\nAll existing directives and instructions for the treatment of foreign\r\nworkers will be tested by the bureaus concerned as to whether they\r\nconform to the principles set forth here. Where this is not the case,\r\nthey will be immediately revised by suitable measures.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 16 April 1943\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 212-PS\r\n\r\nCOPY\r\n\r\nDirections for the handling of the Jewish question\r\n\r\n1. _In General._ The competency of the Chief of the Security Police\r\nand Security Service, who is charged with the mission of solving\r\nthe European Jewish question, extends even to the occupied eastern\r\nprovinces. Accordingly, the offices under the Security Police for\r\nthe purpose of handling the Jewish question in the occupied eastern\r\nprovinces are qualified for their present sphere of activity.\r\n\r\nIn the individual Reichs commissariats, and within these, in the\r\nGeneral commissariats, Jewry represents a portion of the population\r\nwhich is very varied in strength. For example, millions of Jews live in\r\nWhite Russia and in the Ukraine who have lived here for generations.\r\nIn the central province of the USSR however, the Jews have moved in,\r\nfor by far the greatest part, during Bolshevistic times. Those Russian\r\nJews who followed in the wake of the invading Red Army of 1939 and 1940\r\nto East Poland, West Ukraine, West White Russia, the Baltic lands,\r\nBessarabia, and Buchenland are one particular group.\r\n\r\nAll measures for the Jewish question in the occupied eastern provinces\r\nmust be met with the point of view that the whole Jewish question will\r\nbe solved in general for all of Europe after the war at the latest.\r\nThey are therefore to be instituted as preparatory partial measures and\r\nmust be in agreement with those decisions which may otherwise be met\r\nin this field. This is especially true for the preparation of at least\r\ntemporary reception centers for Jews from the Reich province.\r\n\r\nAn eventual act by the civilian population against the Jews is not\r\nto be prevented as long as this is compatible with the maintenance\r\nof order and security in the rear of the fighting troops. Namely\r\nretaliatory measures are to be allowed against the Jews who come into\r\nthe provinces which were newly occupied by the Red Army in the last few\r\nyears. However, strict measures are to be taken against street mobs and\r\nother evil elements for whom it concerns only plunder of Jewish stores\r\nand stealing Jewish property for their own personal gain.\r\n\r\n2. _Definition of the term \"Jew\"._ The peaceful settlement of the\r\nJewish question requires the previous determining as to who is to be\r\nconsidered a Jew in the occupied Eastern provinces. In reference to the\r\nsolving of the European Jewish question and to the strong influence\r\nwhich Jewry had upon the remaining Russian population until the\r\ninvasion of German troops, and which it still exercises at present, it\r\nappears necessary from a political, as well as from a popular point of\r\nview, for the purpose of avoiding a later regaining of strength of the\r\nJews, to grasp the term \"Jew\" in the most far-reaching sense.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is a Jew, who belongs to the Jewish religion, or has been\r\nrecognized as Jewish by other circumstances; he who has a parent who is\r\na Jew in accordance with the above sentence is also a Jew.\r\n\r\n3. _Comprehension, mark of recognition, suspension of the rights of\r\nfreedom and segregation._ The first main goal of the German measures\r\nmust be strict segregation of Jewry from the rest of the population.\r\nIn the execution of this, first of all is the seizing of the Jewish\r\npopulace by the introduction of a registration order and similar\r\nappropriate measures. Soviet Jewry has, constantly, attempted,\r\nsince the Bolshevistic Revolution, to disguise itself in order to\r\nunobtrusively move into leading positions, especially in the grain\r\nregions of the USSR. For this purpose many Jews have dropped their\r\nJewish names and have taken Russian family names and Russian surnames.\r\nIt is to be decreed, that the person who must register must report\r\nall changes of name by Jews during his lifetime, or as far as he\r\nknows during the time of his forefathers, to his superior and to\r\nmake them retrogressive. The same goes for previous departure from\r\nthe religious congregation and acceptance of other faiths (other\r\nmanifold). The erasure of the Jewish deception will be easier in the\r\nReich commissariat Eastland and Ukraine, where the larger part of\r\nthe Jews have been living for generations than in the other Reichs\r\ncommissariats. The Soviet archive material, in so far as it is\r\npreserved, is to be brought to use for this.\r\n\r\nThen immediately, the wearing of the recognition sign consisting of a\r\nyellow Jewish star is to be brought about and all rights of freedom for\r\nJews are to be withdrawn. They are to be placed in Ghettos and at the\r\nsame time are to be separated according to sexes. The presence of many\r\nmore or less closed Jewish settlements in White Ruthenia and in the\r\nUkraine makes this mission easier. Moreover, places are to be chosen\r\nwhich make possible the full use of the Jewish manpower in case labor\r\nneeds are present. These Ghettos can be placed under the supervision\r\nof a Jewish self-government with Jewish officials. The guarding of the\r\nboundaries between the Ghettos and the outer world is, however, the\r\nduty of the police.\r\n\r\nAlso in the cases in which a Ghetto could not yet be established,\r\ncare is to be taken through strict prohibitions and similar suitable\r\nmeasures that a further intermingling of blood of the Jews and the rest\r\nof the populace does not continue.\r\n\r\n4. _Removal of the Jewish influence in political, economical, cultural\r\nand social fields._ Relative with the measures to segregate the Jews\r\nphysically from the rest of the populace, everything necessary is to\r\nbe used in order to eliminate every influence of the Jewry upon the\r\nRussian people. This is to happen immediately in political and cultural\r\nfields, whereas in all other cases consideration is to be taken that\r\nthe common interests are not impaired. This is especially true for the\r\neconomic missions which are important due to the demands of the war and\r\nthose which concern the national economy.\r\n\r\nAn entire reconversion of Jewish professional life must be brought\r\nabout insofar as it does not deal with manual laborers. The group of\r\nState employees in the Russian government along with the strongest\r\nJewish professional groups shall vanish entirely. Likewise, similar\r\nprofessional groups are to be divorced from the public life, whereby,\r\nhowever, the tempo of these measures must correspond with the general\r\neconomical and social need.\r\n\r\nThe entire Jewish property is to be seized and confiscated with\r\nexception of that which is necessary for a bare existence. As far\r\nas the economical situation permits, the power of disposal of their\r\nproperty is to be taken from the Jews as soon as possible through\r\norders and other measures given by the commissariat, so that the moving\r\nof property will quickly cease.\r\n\r\nAny cultural activity will be completely forbidden to the Jew. This\r\nincludes the outlawing of the Jewish press, the Jewish theatres and\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe slaughtering of animals according to Jewish rites is also to be\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\n5. _Forced Labor._ The present manpower shortage in the occupied\r\neastern territories as well as ideological-political considerations\r\nmake the demand appear of basic significance to introduce forced labor\r\ncommitment in the strictest form. This will have to take place move\r\nby move by the elimination of the Jews from their professional life\r\nalthough they are to be permitted to work in their own occupations\r\nif they fall within the scope of the labor commitment. Moreover, the\r\nJewish manpower is to be used for heavy manual labor.\r\n\r\nThe standing rule for the Jewish labor employment is the complete\r\nand unyielding use of Jewish manpower regardless of age in the\r\nreconstruction of the occupied eastern territories. The missions,\r\nwhich are to be given to the Jews in their labor employment, are\r\nespecially the highway, railroad and canal construction, as far as the\r\nameliorations, etc. are considered. Also, it seems that agricultural\r\nemployment above all, will be brought about under strict supervision.\r\nNothing is to be done against the employment of the Jews in cutting of\r\nwood, production of straw shoes, brooms and brushes within the Ghettos.\r\n\r\nIn the employment of the Jews, care is to be taken that Jewish labor is\r\nonly so used in those productions which will later suffer no noticeable\r\ninterruption in case of a rapid withdrawal of these labor forces, and\r\nwhich excludes a specialization of Jewish workers. It is to be avoided\r\nin every case that Jewish workers become indispensable in essential\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n6. _Violations_. Violations against German measures, especially against\r\nthe forced labor regulations, are to be punishable by death to the\r\nJews.

In many\r\nplaces, according to these reports, the guarding authorities have even\r\ndeveloped into protectors and caretakers of the PWs.\r\n\r\nI informed the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of these reports\r\nwith the comment that the productive German population absolutely\r\ncannot understand it, if, in a time in which the German people is\r\nfighting for existence or non-existence, PWs--hence our enemies--are\r\nleading a better life than the German working-man, and that it is an\r\nurgent duty of every German who has to do with PWs, to bring about a\r\ncomplete utilization of their manpower.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of PW affairs in the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces has\r\nnow given out the unequivocal order, attached hereto in copy form, to\r\nthe commanders of PWs in the military districts. I request that this\r\norder _be brought orally to the attention of all party office holders\r\nin an appropriate manner_.\r\n\r\nIn case that in the future complaints about unsuitable treatment of PWs\r\nstill come to light, they are to be immediately communicated to the\r\ncommanders of the PWs with a reference to the attached order.\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer--HQ, 25 November 1943\r\n\r\n  (Signed): M.

Allg. (Ia) No. 11082143\r\n\r\n  Berlin, Badenschestr. 51, 26 October 1943\r\n\r\n To: the Commanders of PWs in the Military Districts I to XIII, XVII,\r\n XVIII, XX, XXI, Government-General with the commanders of the Armed\r\n Forces in the Ukraine and the East; the PW District Commandant with\r\n the Commander of the Armed Forces in Norway.\r\n\r\n For information: to the Commanders of PWs in the Operational Areas I\r\n to IV\r\n\r\n to the PW District Commandants in Italy and Serbia\r\n\r\n  Subject: Treatment of PWs.\r\n\r\nI. The intention of treating non-Soviet PWs strictly according to the\r\nConvention of 29 and the Soviet PWs according to the special directions\r\nof the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, has in many cases led to\r\nforms, which are not in harmony with the total war forced upon us.\r\n\r\nThe PW must according to the convention \"be treated humanely and\r\nespecially be protected against acts of violence, insults, and public\r\ncuriosity\". This does not mean, however, that a similar care must be\r\ngranted him, as is required for German soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Soviet PWs, insofar as their diet is brought into\r\nharmony with the work output expected of them and they have recovered\r\nfrom the unavoidable rigors of the Eastern war, the sharp health\r\nsupervision originally necessary, in part consisting of continuous\r\nweight check-ups is as a rule no longer required. Weight check-ups may\r\nonly have the aim of determining undernourishment; they are only to be\r\nutilized in individual cases.\r\n\r\nThe aerial terrorism of the enemy forces great parts of the German\r\npeople into a way of life similar to that prevailing in the operational\r\narea. As a result of this, the treatment and conduct of PWs, who enjoy\r\nthe protection of the convention of 29 and who are, moreover, through\r\nthe receipt of packages, in many ways better nourished than their\r\ncountrymen on the enemy side, are regarded critically. Especially, a\r\ntoo mild treatment of Soviet PWs will not be understood anywhere, as\r\nit is known what frightful sufferings German soldiers must endure, who\r\nhave fallen into Soviet hands.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the labor detachments and the guard personnel must,\r\nmoreover, receive unequivocal orders and it must continually be pointed\r\nout to them through teaching and instruction that their primary duty\r\nconsists in keeping the PWs to the full output of their working energy,\r\nand in insuring that the lazy be apprehended most rapidly through such\r\nmeasures as are permitted to the entrepreneurs or by the punishments\r\nreserved to the military superiors and that intractable elements be\r\nrecognized and segregated.\r\n\r\nLeaders of labor detachments and guard personnel must be conscious\r\nof the fact that, in a time when unconditional and extreme effort is\r\ndemanded from every member of the German nation, inferior production on\r\nthe part of the PWs, which are traceable to malevolence or carelessness\r\ncan in no case be tolerated. The great labor battle of the homeland\r\ndepends upon the work output of every individual and thereby also of\r\nevery PW.\r\n\r\nThe thought that PWs through their work primarily fill the wallet of\r\nthe entrepreneur, and hence must be protected from him is erroneous.\r\nEntrepreneurs are now agents of the German people. They have\r\nexclusively to deliver things of importance to the war effort usually\r\nin a very limited time and for this to utilize completely all manpower\r\nat their disposal according to its best occupational suitability. The\r\nentrepreneurs know that manpower cannot be replaced and must therefore\r\nfor this reason too, have the greatest interest in the preservation of\r\nthis power.\r\n\r\nLabor detachment leaders, guard personnel, entrepreneurs and German\r\nworkers form one front and have a common goal: the attainment of\r\nvictory! To this end they must, by putting aside all personal wishes,\r\nand in closest and most unified cooperation make use of the manpower of\r\nthe PWs put at their disposal by the Reich. Whoever does not work for\r\nthis goal or interferes with its attainment is harmful to the nation\r\nand injures our comrades at the front.\r\n\r\nHence, the treatment of the PWs employed at labor is to be arranged\r\nsolely to raise the labor output to the highest possible degree and\r\nimmediately to take sharp action if the PWs are careless, lazy, or\r\nrecalcitrant. The PWs are not to be \"cared for\" but are to be handled\r\nin such a manner that the required highest degree of work output be\r\nattained. With this, needless to say, goes, besides just treatment of\r\nthe PWs, the supplying of the PWs with the rations, clothing, etc., due\r\nthem according to existing directives.\r\n\r\nII. The development of the situation and the increasing requirements\r\nfor PW labor power force us to bring more and more PWs into the Reich.\r\nDespite this it cannot be counted upon that the guard forces will be\r\ncorrespondingly increased, also the quality of the guard personnel will\r\nnot on the average be able to be improved.\r\n\r\nIn addition the problem becomes more difficult because the PWs\r\nerroneously believe that they can discern an advantage to themselves\r\nin the situation. Hence they become arrogant in many cases and attempt\r\nto escape to a greater extent. These symptoms can only be countered\r\nby immediately taking sharp measures against the PWs in case of\r\nrecalcitrance or escape.\r\n\r\nWeaklings, who should express themselves to the effect that in the\r\npresent situation one must assure oneself of \"friends\" among the PWs by\r\nmeans of mild treatment, are defeatists and are to be prosecuted on the\r\ncharge of subversion of national defense.\r\n\r\nThe PWs must not be in doubt for an instant that weapons will be\r\nruthlessly employed against them, if they give any sort of passive\r\nresistance or should try to mutiny.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officers must take care that this policy concerning\r\nthe treatment of PWs becomes the common property of all officers,\r\nofficials, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men subordinated\r\nto them. This is not to be attained through written directives and\r\npamphlets alone, but primarily by the spoken word and by a persistent\r\nand conscientious education of subordinates in the spirit of these\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nI request that the local agencies of the National Socialist Party be,\r\nin a suitable manner, orally informed of this policy and that it be\r\nreported to the Commanders.\r\n\r\nI request that no reproduction of this document be made.\r\n\r\n  [signed] v.

Central Office 27 Sep 44 [Init.] 3.\r\n Administration 27 Sep 44 [Init.] Returned to the Chancellery\r\n\r\n Subject: Treatment of Prisoners of War--Tasks of the guard units.\r\n\r\nThe regulations, valid until now, on the treatment of Prisoners of War,\r\nand the tasks of the guard units are no longer justified in view of the\r\ndemands of the total war effort. Therefore, the Supreme Command (OKW)\r\nof the Armed Forces, on my suggestion, issued the regulation, a copy of\r\nwhich is enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe following is cited for its contents:\r\n\r\n1. The understanding exists between the Chief of the Supreme Command\r\nof the Armed Forces (OKW) and myself, that _the cooperation of the\r\nparty in the commitment of prisoners of war is inevitable_. Therefore,\r\nthe officers, assigned to the prisoner of war system, have been\r\ninstructed, to _cooperate most closely with the bearers of sovereignty_\r\n[_Hoheitstraeger_]; the commandants of the prisoner of war camps have\r\nto detail immediately _liaison officers to the Kreisleiters_.\r\n\r\nThus the opportunity will be afforded the Hoheitstraeger, to alleviate\r\nexisting difficulties locally, to exercise influence on the behavior\r\nof the guard units and to _better assimilate the commitment of the\r\nprisoners of war to the political and economic demands_.\r\n\r\n2. The increase of performance [Leistungssteigerung] of the prisoners\r\nof war depends decisively on how the guard and auxiliary units\r\nunderstand their task, and what position they take toward the prisoners\r\nof war. From this knowledge the necessity is derived, _to orient them\r\nagain and again politically and ideologically_, to put the meaning of\r\ntheir mission constantly before their eyes. For that, in all base camps\r\n[Stalags] National Socialist leaders from headquarters [hauptamtliche\r\nNS-Fuehrungsoffiziere] are being assigned.\r\n\r\nI request the Hoheitstraeger to support the commandants of the\r\nprisoners of war in the selection of capable officers. Above that,\r\nthe Hoheitstraeger are to furnish the commandants of the prisoner of\r\nwar camps with capable speakers for the orientation of the guard and\r\nauxiliary units. Collaborators of the offices for national questions\r\n[Volkstumfragen] are to be called upon especially for that.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a constant political orientation of the plant owner, who\r\nis invested now with special rights toward the prisoners of war and\r\ntoward the guard units, must take place in cooperation with the German\r\nLabor Front (DAF).\r\n\r\n    /s/ M.

This accusation is true.\r\n\r\nI was committed as district commissioner in the information service in\r\nthe territory of Wassilkow from May 5th 1942 up to December 28th 1944.\r\nBesides many work districts, I was made fully responsible by district\r\ncommissioner Doehrer to completely fill the district quota of workers\r\nto be delivered to Germany. Although the task wasn't agreeable to me, I\r\ncarried it out conscientiously, with skill, and where it was necessary\r\nwith sternness. Up until the penetration of the Soviet Armies, this\r\nterritory delivered more than 31,000 workers to Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring the year of 1942 the conscription of workers was accomplished\r\nby way of propaganda. Only very rarely was force necessary. Only\r\nin August 1942, measures had to be taken against 2 families in the\r\nvillages Glewenka and Salisny-Chutter, each of which were to supply\r\none person for labor. Both were requested in June for the first time,\r\nbut didn't obey although requested repeatedly. They had to be brought\r\nup by force, but succeeded twice to escape from the collecting camp,\r\nor when being on transport. Before the second arrest, the fathers of\r\nboth of the men were taken into custody, to be kept as hostages and to\r\nbe released only when their sons would show up. When, after the second\r\nescape, rearrest of both the fathers and boys was ordered, the police\r\npatrols ordered to do so, found the houses to be empty.\r\n\r\nThat time I decided to take measures to show the increasingly\r\nrebellious Ukrainian youth that our orders have to be followed. I\r\nordered the burning down of the houses of the fugitives. The result\r\nwas, that in the future people obeyed willingly, orders concerning\r\nlabor obligations. However, the measure of burning houses has not\r\nbecome known, for the first time by my actions, but was suggested in\r\na secret letter from the commissioner for the commitment of labor\r\nas a forced measure, in case other measures should fail. This hard\r\npunishment was accepted by the population with satisfaction, previous\r\nto the measures, because both families ridiculed all the other duty\r\nanxious families, which sent their children partly voluntarily to the\r\nlabor commitment.\r\n\r\nThe year 1943 brought about a new regulation concerning the commitment\r\nof labor, by way of regular yearly conscription. Previous to the\r\ncoming of the conscription, I trained the staff for this task. I had\r\nthe collecting camp in the territory of Wassilkow fixed to the best of\r\npossibilities with clean, light bedrooms, clean sanitary installations,\r\ngood food, and entertainment. First of all, everything was done away\r\nwith, which could have caused the Ukrainian to feel that he is being\r\ndeparted by force. A well meaning propaganda was put to work on all\r\nworkers, right after their arrival into the camp and didn't allow a\r\nlow feeling to arise. I had reserved for myself the right of exemption\r\non the basis of labor, political, and social reasons; it was handled\r\nas big heartedly as the task permitted. Mostly after the start of\r\nthe first conscription period, the districts of Wassilkow received\r\na local commander in the person of Count Griese. This officer, who\r\ncaused already great quarrels in the district of Lodwiza and Gadjatsch\r\non account of his arrogant behaviour, also created difficulties in\r\nWassilkow between the armed forces and the civil administration, up\r\nto then unknown. First of all he took care of the labor commitment\r\nand not only criticized measures taken by me, but received also at\r\nany time every complaining Ukrainian, and promised them help against\r\nthe office of the district commissioner. Up to then I didn't have to\r\ntake serious measures, because the population was fairly willing. Only\r\na few fugitives had to pay families, and until the money came in, I\r\nhad secured more or less of their property according to the security\r\nof the case. The punished paid their penalties without exception and\r\nhad their property returned to them. But before they got around to\r\ndo so, one part complained to the local commander, who didn't by any\r\nchance reproach these people, but on the contrary, took care of all the\r\ninterests of those people, in front of me, and sometimes ordered me\r\nwith a commanding voice, to nullify my measures. I didn't let it scare\r\nme, but carried out the task, for which I was responsible, according\r\nto my judgment. But the job was unbearably hard now, since it became\r\nknown to the population, that the local commander accepts complaints\r\nagainst the district commissioner. After the initial successes, a\r\npassive resistance of the population started, which finally forced me\r\nto start again on making arrests, confiscations, and transfers to labor\r\ncamps. After a while a transport of people, obliged to work, overran\r\nthe police in the railroad station in Wassilkow and escaped. I saw\r\nagain the necessity for strict measures. A few ring leaders, which of\r\ncourse escaped before they were found in Plissezkoje and in Mitnitza.\r\nAfter repeated attempts to get a hold of them, their houses were burned\r\ndown. Thereupon, military police were sent to the villages by the local\r\ncommander and extensive interrogations concerning this affair were made\r\nby him. Besides that he hired young Ukrainians as voluntary helpers,\r\nwhich were fugitives from the transient camp. Therefore, every work was\r\nmade impossible for me, in this sector.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for me to give the exact dates of the mentioned\r\nhappenings above, because after I was last committed in the district\r\nof Gaissin, I got into a Soviet ambush in March 1944 near Stanislau. I\r\ncould only hide my weapons and had to burn my whole baggage including\r\nmy diary.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I want to point out the following:\r\n\r\n1. I had the responsibility within the territory of Wassilkow for the\r\nconscripting of the local workers for the Reich. The choice of means,\r\nwhich were used to execute my task, was to be left to me.\r\n\r\n2. I worked with the utmost patience and only reverted to stricter\r\npunishments, when the success accomplished was in no comparison to the\r\ntime used.\r\n\r\n3. Strict measures, like the burning down of houses, were only used in\r\na few cases. By this means, it was accomplished--at least in 1942--that\r\nthe recruiting of workers didn't tie down too many police forces, who\r\nbecause of other functions, couldn't be used for that purpose all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n4. I was entitled to use such measures by the secret labor-directive\r\nfor labor commitment staff in the district of Kiew. They, therefor,\r\ndon't display by any means, any individual actions.\r\n\r\n5. The delivery of 31,000 workers to the Reich is definitely important\r\nto the war effort. Stern measures are definitely justified in order to\r\nprevent a failure of this action.\r\n\r\n6. My measures were thought to be just by the biggest part of the\r\npopulation. They only caused displeasure with the Germans, who had only\r\nsmall tasks to perform in the Ukraine, and therefore had too much time\r\nfor philosophy.\r\n\r\n7. My actions against fugitive people obliged to work\r\n[Arbeitseinsatz-pflichtige], were always reported to district\r\ncommissioner Doehrer, in office in Wassilkow, and to the\r\ngeneral-commissioner [General kommissar] in Kiew. Both of them know the\r\ncircumstances and agreed with my measures, because of their success.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  Signed: Paul Raab.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 265-PS\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n  Shitomir, 30 June 1943\r\n\r\n _The Commissioner General_\r\n\r\nOral report on the situation in the general district Shitomir, by\r\nCommissioner General Leyser, delivered at an official conference, with\r\nReichs Minister Rosenberg, in Winniza on 17 June 1943.\r\n\r\n Mr. Reichs Minister\r\n\r\nThe employees of the civil administration in the General District of\r\nShitomir have, aside from their administrative work, been charged with\r\nthe following special tasks:\r\n\r\n Agricultural production and collection\r\n\r\n Recruiting of workers for Germany and management of forests and timber.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned tasks became virtually a problem due to the fact\r\nthat the general district of Shitomir is particularly \"blessed\" with\r\nbands. Regarding the _agriculture_, it should be primarily interesting\r\nto note that, in the year of 1942, _altogether 289 establishments\r\nwere declared_ as agricultural cooperatives. In 1943 altogether _501\r\nestablishments were, respectively will be_, proclaimed agricultural\r\ncooperatives. The allotment of farm-land amounted in 1942 to 18%, in\r\n1943, so far, to 10.4% and an additional 10% are expected in the fall.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the strong activity of bands, _only about 40%_ of\r\nthe acreage of the general district remain, at present, for the regular\r\nproduction and collection; approximately 60% are under the control of\r\nthe bands. These actually supply the population, in part, with seed\r\nand have the fields cultivated by their order and naturally have the\r\nintention to take possession of the crop in the fall.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the activity of the bands we have access to only\r\n36% of the cattle, 41% of the pigs and 28% of the sheep out of the\r\ntotal stock. As we have to supply particularly the front with meat,\r\nwe are therefore forced to a certain waste of our cattle stocks. Due\r\nto the strong drainage on the substance, there can be no more regular\r\nbreeding. And too, only 42% of the milk total and 51% of the eggs could\r\nbe salvaged. The spring cultivation has been performed thoroughly.\r\nIt was amazing, nonetheless, that in spite of the strong drainage of\r\nlabor forces into the Reich the tilling was executed with a rapidity\r\nwhich could not have been taken for granted. To judge by the present\r\ncondition and the weather, an average crop can be expected. However,\r\nthe securing and salvage of the crop gives much reason to worry. It\r\nmust be avoided under all circumstances, that the bands get hold of\r\nconsiderable parts of the crop, respectively destroy the farm products\r\nwhich have been brought to collecting points. Sufficient protection for\r\nthe various collecting points is not provided, the previous experiences\r\ndo not promise favorable results.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of agriculture deserve particular praise for their\r\nself-sacrificing and dangerous work. In many cases they are only\r\nable to fulfill their duties by risking their lives daily. They made\r\nnumerous sacrifices in blood, in particular lately. Nonetheless,\r\nthey refuse to be prevented from fulfilling their duty. The present\r\nsituation is best illuminated by the fact that at this time the\r\nagricultural leaders can only work at full, or approximately full,\r\ncapacity in 5 out of 18 local areas. In all the other areas, we have\r\nbeen forced to withdraw the leaders of the strong points, and rally\r\nthem at the local or district farmers. From there, they are in most\r\ncases only able to perform their work under strong protection of the\r\npolice or army.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms created by the recruiting of workers are, no doubt, well\r\nknown to the Reichs Minister through reports and his own observations.\r\nTherefore, I shall not report them. It is certain that a recruitment\r\nof labor, in the sense of the word, can hardly be spoken of. _In most\r\ncases, it is nowadays a matter of actual conscription by force._\r\nThe population has been stirred up to a large extent and views the\r\ntransports to the Reich as a measure which does in no way differ from\r\nthe former exile to Siberia, during the Czarist and Bolshevist systems.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground stands, at the moment, the mobilization of the young\r\nclasses of 1923 and 1925. To accomplish this, the active propaganda\r\non our part was used to an extent previously unknown. Therefore, it\r\ncan be stated that the action had been particularly well prepared\r\nand consolidated. In spite of that it did not lead to the desired\r\nsuccess. It has to be added that, in the course of the action, the\r\ndesired contingents had been raised by the Chief Plenipotentiary for\r\nthe mobilization of labor. I could not confine myself therefore to the\r\nclasses of 1923 and 1925 alone, but also called up the class of 1922.\r\nBeyond that, even other sections of the population which originally\r\nshould have been spared had to be included. With this our propaganda\r\nbecame for the greater part illusory. But as the Chief Plenipotentiary\r\nfor the mobilization of labor explained to us the gravity of the\r\nsituation, we had no other device. I consequently have authorized the\r\ncommissioners of the areas to apply the severest measures in order to\r\nachieve the imposed quota. The deterioration of morale in conjunction\r\nwith this does not necessitate any further proof. It is nevertheless\r\nessential, to win the war on this front too! The problem of labor\r\nmobilization cannot be handled with gloves.\r\n\r\nUp-to-date, almost 170,000 male and female workers have been sent to\r\nthe Reich from the general district Shitomir. It can be taken for\r\ngranted that, during the month of June, this number is going to rise to\r\napproximately 200,000.\r\n\r\nManagement of forests and timber is also one of the principal worries.\r\nThe general district of Shitomir is very rich in woods. As an average,\r\nthe wooded area amounts to 26% of the total acreage. In the north,\r\nlarge sections of the country are covered 100% with woods. But this\r\ngreat abundance in woods is also the cause of the many bands. About\r\n1,400,000 hectare of wood, that is 80% of the total, are controlled by\r\nbands. Like in the agricultural sector, only a relatively small part\r\nof the wood remains for use. Our yearly production potential in timber\r\namounts to 1,300,000 cubic meter. Presumably 1,000,000 cubic meter\r\ncan be cut. The yearly potential in firewood amounts to 900,000 cubic\r\nmeter. We hope to achieve this. I may point out that the supply of wood\r\nfor mines, RR ties, construction and heating purposes is especially\r\nimportant. The activity of the bands permits us at present to cut, on\r\na larger scale, only in the more southern scantily wooded regions.\r\nConsequently, the old stock of wood there is being consumed rapidly.\r\nThe final result, if no change in the condition occurs, will be the\r\ncareless cutting down of woods, which is going to result in extensive\r\nwaste land. The fact that we are cutting down wood on a larger scale\r\nonly in the south, brought strong impetus to the timber industry in\r\nthe region of Winniza. The time can be foreseen when this period of\r\nprosperity will end, and the timber industry in the south will succumb.\r\nWhether then a removal of the timber industry into the northern part\r\nwill be possible depends on the circumstances which at present cannot\r\ncompletely be foreseen.\r\n\r\nRegarding the activity of the bands I would like to refer to the\r\nnumerous reports laid before the Reichs Minister. There can be said\r\nhardly anything else on this subject except that the situation is\r\nbecoming more unfavorable day by day. The situation can be judged best\r\nby the fact that at present only one of the larger roads in the general\r\ndistrict, the one leading from Shitomir to Winniza, can be used without\r\nconvoy. Because the activity of the bands is now also growing daily in\r\nthe south, it is not sure that we shall not be obliged to introduce,\r\nsooner or later, the convoy system here too. All other roads of the\r\ncountry are at present passable in convoy only when rifles or machine\r\npistols are held ready to shoot. The sacrifices brought to date in\r\nbattle with bandits are very great. In about one year's time, the\r\nlosses through fighting with them in the general district of Shitomir\r\non the German and allied side, including the natives in German service,\r\namount up to now _to 2,568 persons_. The number of missing could not\r\nbe ascertained exactly, because among them are also people who have\r\njoined the bands voluntarily or have been recruited forcibly. Their\r\nnumber amounts to an estimated 2,000 persons. Experience shows that\r\nthese missing persons all die miserably, so the total number of deaths\r\nin battle with the bands in the course of the year can be given as\r\nabout 4,500. Opposing this is the following two demands: (1) Constant\r\ntransfer of army units into those areas threatened respectively\r\noccupied by the bands; (2) Unity of command. The demand to transfer\r\nunits of the armed forces into the areas controlled by the bands, is\r\nsupported by special instructions of the OKW [High Command of the\r\nArmed Forces] in order to fight the bands. It is regrettable that too\r\nfrequently the opinion from the respective branches of the armed forces\r\nis that this demand cannot be executed on account of technical reasons\r\nconcerning training. That this objection is always and everywhere true,\r\ndoes not seem credible to me. Frequent violations against the unity\r\nof command have been committed. The need for prestige, the quest for\r\npower, vanity, etc. have not become extinct as yet. I have to say with\r\nregret that so far I found the least understanding for the necessity\r\nof our common struggle in the armed forces. At any rate, I have the\r\nimpression that under the pressure of conditions they arrived at the\r\nconclusion, that one cannot take the responsibility anymore to lead an\r\nexistence alone, but that the collection of all forces alone could only\r\nbring us victory.\r\n\r\nThe struggle which has to be carried on, is hard and full of\r\nsacrifices. But it will and must be carried through. Vast psychic\r\nforces have been awakened in the members of the civil administration\r\nanew daily. The successes, which they were able to achieve so far\r\nare impressive particularly with regard to the resistance. May I\r\ntherefore be permitted at the conclusion of this report to thank\r\nall my co-workers for their excellent work. They know that they are\r\npractically on the front. I can promise your excellency, that we all\r\nshall do our duty now, and in the future, as our Fuehrer has ordered--.\r\n\r\n  Signed: LEYSER\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 285-PS\r\n\r\n The Reichs Commissar for the Sudetenland\r\n\r\n Stamped: Rosenberg Chancellory\r\n\r\nIn Nr 4459 3 Nov 38 Shown to RL 3/11\r\n\r\n  Reichenberg 31 Oct 1938\r\n\r\n Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 35 Margaretenstrasse 17\r\n\r\n\r\n [Handwritten note]: Copy to Himmler\r\n\r\n Dear party member Rosenberg!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was not possible for me to thank you for your friendly\r\nletter of the 15th of this month, because your news was forwarded to\r\nAsch.

First of all, in my opinion\r\nMueller is not to be considered guilty in this case. It cannot be\r\nestablished, either by the letter from the village Biloserka, which\r\nletter caused this investigation, nor by the conduct of district\r\ncommissioner Mueller, himself, that he was present at the happenings in\r\nBiloserka. He therefore cannot be held personally responsible. But even\r\nif Mueller had been present at the burning of houses in connection with\r\nthe national conscription in Biloserka, this should by no means lend to\r\nthe relief of Mueller from office. It is mentioned specifically in a\r\ndirective of the Commissioner General in Lusk of 21 Sep 1942, referring\r\nto the extreme urgency of the national conscription.\r\n\r\n\"Estates of those who refuse to work are to be burned, their relatives\r\nare to be arrested as hostages and to be brought to forced labor\r\ncamps.\" It is obvious that this decree was merely directive in nature\r\nand was not a binding order of the individual commissioner to decide\r\naccording to his own discretion, when the interest of the conscription,\r\nsuch severe measures were to be applied.\r\n\r\nI request therefore to consider the case closed.\r\n\r\n  Reich Commissioner Rowno I 7252 Journal No. 637/43 geh.\r\n\r\n  My order                                  signed: Paltzo\r\n  to P i 755/439                                    [in pencil]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 294-PS\r\n\r\nCopy\r\n\r\nTOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Handwritten:\r\n  II 1 1161/44/ g\r\n\r\nMemorandum\r\n\r\nIn the East, Germany is carrying on a threefold war: a war for the\r\ndestruction of Bolshevism, a war for the destruction of the greater\r\nRussian Empire, and finally a war for the acquisition of colonial\r\nterritory for colonizing purposes and economic exploitation.\r\n\r\nThis threefold mission of the Eastern campaign has brought about\r\nthe enormous resistance of the Eastern peoples. Were the war being\r\nconducted only for the smashing of Bolshevism, then it would have\r\nbeen decided long ago in our favor, for, as all experiences of this\r\nwar have confirmed, Bolshevism is hated to the utmost by the Eastern\r\npeoples, above all by the great mass of peasants. Also the dissolution\r\nof the greater Russian Empire into its national components would\r\nnot have provoked the resistance which we meet now. As the numerous\r\nprisoner interrogations and other experiences show the shrewd Russians\r\nhave a complete understanding that this war will end in territorial\r\nlosses for them and the non-Russian peoples will break out from the\r\nconfinement within which Russia has forced them. The reduction of\r\nthe power of resistance of the Red Army is the major portion of the\r\nthird goal of our campaign. With the inherent instinct of the Eastern\r\npeoples the primitive man soon found out also that for Germany the\r\nslogan: \"Liberation from Bolshevism\" was only a pretext to enslave\r\nthe Eastern peoples according to her own methods. In order that there\r\nexist no doubt at all on the German war aim, however, German publicity\r\nrefers openly to this intention in increasing measure. The conquered\r\nterritory is claimed publicly not only for Germany as a colonization\r\narea, but even for Germany's embittered enemies, the Dutch, Norwegians,\r\nand others. The economic exploitation is proclaimed verbally and in\r\nprint, and carried out with almost elimination of the demands of the\r\nindigenous population, even with the greatest lack of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe populace has more of an understanding of the measures and duties\r\nnecessitated by war than the conquered peoples of the West. But the\r\nlaborer and peasant, who were educated to the highest degree of\r\nself-consciousness by Bolshevism, soon perceived that Germany did not\r\nregard them as partners of equal rights, but considered them only as\r\nthe objective of her political and economic aims. That disillusioned\r\nthem unspeakably, all the more since they had placed colossal hopes on\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe main department for politics of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied\r\nEastern territories claims that it has been quite aware of this\r\nsituation from the beginning. It was soon apparent that the war could\r\nnot be decided in a short time by arms alone, because of the vast areas\r\nand the enemy's inexhaustible reserves of manpower and material, but\r\nthat as in all great wars of recent times a spiritual disintegration\r\nwould have to come and the war would have to be changed at the final\r\nconclusion to a civil war, all the more since the German Wehrmacht does\r\nnot intend to occupy completely the territory of the Soviet Union.\r\nThe Russian collapse of 1917 and the German break-down of 1918 were\r\nactually not brought about by weapons alone, but primarily by political\r\ndisintegration. What Lenin achieved in Russia, the 14 points of Wilson\r\nand the undermining effect of Marxism accomplished in Germany. In the\r\nSoviet Union we found on our arrival a population weary of Bolshevism,\r\nwhich waited longingly for new slogans, holding out the prospect of\r\na better future to them. It was Germany's duty to find such slogans,\r\nbut they remained unuttered. The population greeted us with joy as\r\nliberators, and placed themselves at our disposal willingly and freely\r\nwith body and life. Wherever Ukrainians, Russians, White Ruthenians and\r\nmembers of the Baltic peoples were enlisted in the German Wehrmacht\r\nor in the police they have proved themselves and fought excellently\r\nalmost without exception. The Main Department for Politics tried every\r\nmeans of keeping this vast capital that had fallen into our lap, and\r\nof utilizing it for our purposes. To this purpose it was necessary\r\nthat National Socialism separate itself from Bolshevism with a sharp\r\nline of distinction and open to the populace prospects of a new better\r\nlife. All measures which the Main Department for Politics suggested\r\nwere directed toward this one goal of preserving this capital. They\r\nhave been many times attacked as the expression of a weak sentimental\r\nhumanitarian attitude, of a form of German sentimentalism, and they\r\nwere in reality only the expression of completely coarse material\r\npolitics. For nothing else was contemplated than to preserve the\r\nmass millions of the Eastern area in the adjustment to us which was\r\nencountered with, in order to draw from it the greatest possible use\r\nfor Germany both militaristically, politically and economically. Should\r\nthis political policy succeed, the greatest reactions on the enemy\r\ntroops were to be expected. For years the masses of the S.U. (Soviet\r\nUnion) were stirred up against the surrounding world by the most\r\nefficient propaganda machine that has ever existed. Until 1939 National\r\nSocialism had been the target of the most spiteful attacks. Day after\r\nday it was hammered into the laborers and peasants that the active\r\nmasses in Germany were a sacrifice to the most terrible exploitation.\r\nWith extreme tension workers and peasants looked forward to the\r\nGerman administration. To be sure they had not completely trusted the\r\nBolshevist propaganda, but in spite of that they met the new masters\r\nwith a certain feeling of doubt.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, the peoples of the S.U. (Soviet Union) have gone\r\nthrough the hardest times. Consequently, they are of a simplicity\r\ninconceivable to us, even in the political sphere. A form of government\r\nwhich was not intent only on plundering and exploitation and which put\r\naside the Bolshevist methods would have kindled the greatest enthusiasm\r\nand put at our disposal a mass of millions. And the enthusiasm in the\r\noccupied Eastern territories would have had its reaction on the force\r\nof resistance of the Red Army. It would have been easily attainable to\r\nhave the Red Army man say to himself: \"I fight for a system that is\r\nthroughout worse than that which awaits me in the case of a defeat. I\r\nwill be better off in every respect among the Germans than I have been\r\nuntil now\". If the Red Army man had become convinced of his general\r\nwell-being, the war would have been at an end very soon.\r\n\r\nKnowing this the Main Department for Politics believed it to be its\r\nprimary duty to assist our combat troops with all their power by a\r\npropaganda campaign aimed at crippling the power of resistance of\r\nthe Red Army and to shorten the war in this way. For the attainment\r\nof this goal there are, among the measures proposed, two of the\r\nutmost importance: The Agrarian Law and Religious Freedom, which is\r\nessentially distinct from that of the Bolshevists.\r\n\r\nConsidering the exceptionally great significance which approaches the\r\nagrarian question in the Soviet Union, the Main Department for Politics\r\nwas demanding even before the beginning of the Eastern campaign,\r\nthat the Kolchos be dissolved and an individual agrarian economy be\r\nintroduced again. This proposal was turned down by the Four Year Plan\r\nwith the remark that organic changes were not to be considered during\r\nthe war. Not until August of 1st year was an increase of the farmland\r\nsuccessfully put through.\r\n\r\nBefore the realization could be carried out, however, the Four Year\r\nPlan had recognized that the impetuous pressure of the whole peasant\r\npopulation for the dissolution of the collective would have to be\r\nreckoned with in some way in the interest of production itself. The\r\nproposal of the Main Department for Politics for the dissolution of\r\nthe collective found its defeat in the new agrarian decree. A few\r\nmonths had been sufficient to make clear, not only to all Wehrmacht\r\nunits down to the youngest lieutenant in the line farthest forward,\r\nbut also to the units in the home country and the civil administration\r\nin the occupied Eastern territories, the need of reform in the Kolchos\r\nconstitution. The only exceptions in this knowledge were the two Reich\r\nCommissars, whose disagreement unfortunately caused a delay of several\r\nweeks. The new Agrarian Decree came out shortly before the spring\r\nplanting and was greatly played up in the territories by the Press\r\nand Propaganda Dept. of Main Department I. Its direct success was a\r\nhitherto inconceivable piece of work of the populace in the spring\r\nplanting, which was able to be carried out in spite of unfavorable\r\npreliminary conditions. In spite of this no lasting effect on the enemy\r\nhas appeared so far. Naturally, the enemy propaganda countered our\r\nAgrarian Decree with every means. Their main argument was that in this\r\nit was only a matter of a promise which had as its purpose a momentary\r\ntactical success, that moreover Germany intended to make use of the\r\nland later for her own purposes. This argument found support in the\r\nvery slow execution of the Agrarian Decree, which is to be attributed\r\nin part to objective reasons (lack of surveyors, land registration,\r\nsurveying instruments and so forth).\r\n\r\nIt has been foreseen that in 1942 in the Ukraine 20% of the general\r\neconomy was to be changed to agriculture cooperatives. The increasing\r\nof the farmland, which forms the main criterion of the general economy\r\nand is carried through everywhere immediately, has still not been\r\nachieved to the extent of 10% of the general economy, although it was\r\ndecreed, as has been mentioned, in August 1941. The transformation to\r\nagricultural cooperatives has generally begun only a short time ago,\r\nand according to the directives of the farmer's leader Koerner is not\r\nto reach more than 10% by the end of August of this year. In this state\r\nof affairs it is understandable that great sections of the Ukrainian\r\npeasantry are under the control of enemy propaganda and have lost\r\nbelief in the earnestness of our intentions.\r\n\r\nThe religious freedom was likewise to call forth a great propaganda\r\neffect. After months long negotiations, it was eventually decided\r\nnot to announce the freedom of religion ceremoniously, but to let it\r\ncome into existence as quietly as possible. The propaganda effect\r\nconsequently slipped from the picture.\r\n\r\nWhen the Main Department for Politics noticed the hesitation of\r\ndecision in the church question, it searched for a substitute in\r\nanother means of propaganda, in the question of returning property\r\nrights of the individual. In this the whole world could be clearly\r\nshown that National Socialism contrasts distinctly with the Bolshevist\r\nexpropriation measures and a new property law would be ushered in. The\r\nfirst display of this slogan for propaganda use would have been the\r\nimmediate raising of the expropriation measures in the Baltic states,\r\nwhich Bolshevism had not yet controlled for a year, and consequently\r\nit would have been possible to resume the former property situation\r\nwithout further ado. To the unbounded astonishment of the populace,\r\nhowever, the German administration marched forward to play the role\r\nof receiver of the goods stolen by the Bolshevists. The necessity for\r\nthe restoration of private ownership for the psychological treatment\r\nof the populace was referred to by all the General Commissioners in\r\nthe Baltic states; this population, as everybody knows, ought to be\r\nwon for German patriotism. Even after the Four Year Plan gave up its\r\nold ideas in recognition that a further protraction of the restoration\r\nof private ownership would damage even the German economic interests.\r\nThe fundamental profession of the reinstallation of the pre-Bolshevist\r\nproperty law did not follow, though it was against every political\r\njudgment and based only on the unfounded opposition of the Reichs\r\nCommissar.\r\n\r\nAgain a real weapon for the disintegration of the enemy front had been\r\ntwisted out of our hand, a weapon whose effect may not be undervalued.\r\nFor the unrecompensed expropriation of private property by the\r\nBolshevists had aroused at the time not only the terror of Russian\r\nbourgeois circles including the more prosperous peasants, but also\r\nof the entire civilized world. The world, including the laborers and\r\npeasants in the Soviet Union who were disillusioned by Bolshevism,\r\nawaited now a clear policy in this question on the part of Germany.\r\nThis silence on the part of Germany obviously made itself of use to the\r\nenemy propaganda, which could reliably persuade the Soviet masses that\r\nGermany plans no restoration of individual ownership.\r\n\r\nThe Main Department for Politics furthermore has always emphasized that\r\nthe Eastern peoples must be told something concrete about their future.\r\nThe Department refers to the fact that in case we should not oppose\r\nthe propaganda of Stalin, the peoples would have to succumb to this\r\npropaganda, that is to say, they would believe in their own enslavement\r\nby Germany. The Main Department for Politics has accordingly often\r\ndirected the attention of Wehrmacht units to the expediency of having\r\nthe Slavic Eastern peoples receive calming assurances regarding their\r\nfuture from the authoritative German quarters. As the best means, the\r\nestablishment of a sort of counter-regime to Stalin with a captured Red\r\ngeneral was indicated; or, if the word government should be avoided,\r\nthen just a rebellious general somewhat after the model of de Gaulle,\r\nwho should become the point of crystallization for all the Red soldiers\r\nwho are dissatisfied with Stalin. The correctness of this conception\r\nhas been confirmed in the time following its inception by countless\r\nstatements of prisoners of war, who have all stated independently that\r\nthe silence of Germany regarding the future of Russia allows the worst\r\nto be feared. Many would like to desert, but they did not know to whom\r\nthey should go. Under the banner of a recognized counter-revolutionary\r\nleader they would gladly and bravely fight against the Bolshevist\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nAll the suggestions concerning this were rejected in their essentials.\r\nPermission for front-line duty was effected only for groups of Turkish\r\nand Caucasian peoples and finally after several refusals also for the\r\nEstonians. Because of the difficulty of recruiting troops, the unit\r\ngenerally came to the point of impressing civilians and prisoners of\r\nwar into their ranks, in the first line of rear-echelon services. But\r\neven in the foremost line they found employment and fought well. Only\r\nin the last few weeks under the pressure of danger from the partisans\r\nwas the formation of native units allowed and that only for combat\r\nwith the bandits. But even this measure will remain ineffective as far\r\nas propaganda is concerned if a combat unit is not activated and a\r\npersonality with a resounding name is not put at its head.\r\n\r\nThe Main Department for Politics was compelled, for the sake of\r\nattaining the above-outlined goal, to rescind or at least greatly\r\nchange measures from German quarters which would strengthen the enemy's\r\npower of resistance.\r\n\r\nOf primary importance, the treatment of prisoners of war should be\r\nnamed. It is no longer a secret from friend or foe that hundreds of\r\nthousands of them literally have died of hunger or cold in our camps.\r\nAllegedly there were not enough food supplies on hand for them. It\r\nis especially peculiar that the food supplies are deficient only\r\nfor prisoners of war from the Soviet Unions, while complaints about\r\nthe treatment of other prisoners of war, Polish, Serbian, French\r\nand English, have not become loud. It is obvious that nothing is so\r\nsuitable for strengthening the power of resistance of the Red Army as\r\nthe knowledge that in German captivity a slow miserable death is to\r\nbe met. To be sure the Main Department for Politics has succeeded here\r\nby unceasing efforts in bringing about a material improvement of the\r\nfate of the prisoners of war. However this improvement is not to be\r\nascribed to political acumen, but to the sudden realization that our\r\nlabor market must be supplied with laborers at once. We now experienced\r\nthe grotesque picture of having to recruit millions of laborers from\r\nthe occupied Eastern territories, after prisoners of war have died of\r\nhunger like flies, in order to fill the gaps that have formed within\r\nGermany. Now the food question no longer existed. In the prevailing\r\nlimitless abuse of the Slavic humanity, \"recruiting\" methods were used\r\nwhich probably have their origin only in the blackest periods of the\r\nslave trade. A regular manhunt was inaugurated. Without consideration\r\nof health or age the people were shipped to Germany, where it turned\r\nout immediately that far more than 100,000 had to be sent back because\r\nof serious illnesses and other incapabilities for work. This system\r\nin no way considered that these methods would of necessity have their\r\neffect on the power of resistance of the Red Army, since these methods\r\nwere used only in the Soviet Union of course, and in no way remotely\r\nresembling this form in enemy countries like Holland or Norway.\r\nActually we have made it quite easy for Soviet propaganda to augment\r\nthe hate for Germany and the National Socialist system. The Soviet\r\nsoldier fights more and more bravely in spite of the efforts of our\r\npoliticians to find another name for this bravery. Valuable German\r\nblood must flow more and more, in order to break the resistance of the\r\nRed Army. Obviously the Main Department for Politics has struggled\r\nunceasingly to place the methods of acquiring workers and their\r\ntreatment within Germany on a rational foundation. Originally it was\r\nthought in all earnestness to demand the utmost efforts at a minimum\r\ncost of the biological knowledge has led to an improvement. Now 400,000\r\nfemale household workers from the Ukraine are to come to Germany, and\r\nalready the German press announces publicly that these people have no\r\nright to free time and may not visit theaters, movies, restaurants,\r\netc. and may leave the house at the most three hours a week apart from\r\nexception concerning duty.\r\n\r\nIn addition there is the treatment of the Ukrainians in the Reichs\r\nCommissariat itself. With a presumption unequalled we put aside all\r\npolitical knowledge and to the glad surprise of all the colored world\r\ntreat the peoples of the occupied Eastern territories as whites of\r\nClass 2, who apparently have only the task of serving as slaves for\r\nGermany and Europe. Only the most limited education is suitable for\r\nthem, no solicitude can be given them. Their sustenance interests us\r\nonly insofar as they are still capable of labor, and in every respect\r\nthey are given to understand that we regard them as of the most minute\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the following can be determined:\r\n\r\n1. The resistance power of the Red Army and the strength of the\r\npartisan movement has mounted in the same degree as the population\r\nrealized our true enlistment for them. The feats of arms of our\r\nnoble army have been neutralized exactly as in 1918 by an inadequate\r\npolitical policy. Our political policy has forced both Bolshevists and\r\nRussian nationals into a common front against us. The Russian fights\r\ntoday with exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice for nothing more or\r\nless than recognition of his human dignity.\r\n\r\n2. Our political policy of utilizing the Ukraine as a counter-weight\r\nagainst mighty Russia, against Poland and the Balkans, and as a bridge\r\nto the Caucasus, has suffered complete ship-wreck. The 40 million\r\nUkrainians who joyfully greeted us as liberators, are today indifferent\r\nto us and already begin to swing into the enemy camp. Should we not\r\nsucceed in checking this situation in the last moment, then we run the\r\ndanger from day to day of having a partisan movement in the Ukraine,\r\nwhich not only eliminates the Ukraine as a furnisher of food, but also\r\nties up the reinforcements of the German army, endangers its existence\r\nand accordingly involves the danger of a German defeat.\r\n\r\nIf this danger which threatens the German people is to be prevented in\r\nthe last moment, then the following is necessary.\r\n\r\n1. For the Ukraine an absolutely positive political policy must be\r\ncarried out in every respect. The Ukraine must not be merely an\r\nobjective of exploitation to us, but the populace must sincerely feel\r\nthat Germany is its friend and liberator. The German economic agencies\r\nmust be responsible for assuring the populace a minimum on which they\r\ncan exist. A compulsory conscription of labor in the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories must be restrained immediately. The treatment of Ukrainians\r\nand other Eastern peoples within the Reich must be fair and human. In\r\npublicity, both oral and written, everything must be avoided that is\r\nin any way cognizant of the fact that we regard this territory as an\r\nobjective of exploitation. The Russian people must be told something\r\nconcrete about their future, particularly because Germany does not\r\nhave the intention nor the power to occupy the whole Russian area.\r\n\r\n2. The policy of the officials of the Reichs Commissar for the Ukraine\r\nis in general the exponent for the above described policy, which has\r\nnot recognized the role of the Ukraine in world politics, and has\r\nsucceeded in throwing away the friendship of 40 million people; and\r\nwhich is guilty in this way of strengthening the power of resistance\r\nof the Red Army and prolonging the war with all its consequences.\r\nThese officials see their only mission as the economic exploitation\r\nof the country. The longer the war lasts, however, the more political\r\nforces must be interposed. Therefore it would be opportune to place at\r\nthe head of the Reich Commissariat a personality who also possesses\r\nsufficient political ability.\r\n\r\nIf we do not accomplish this change of course at once, then one can say\r\nwith certainty that the power of resistance of the Red Army and of the\r\nwhole Russian people will mount still more, and Germany must continue\r\nto sacrifice her best blood. Yes, it must be openly stated that the\r\npossibility of a German defeat approaches in a tangible proximity, all\r\nthe more so if the partisan movement for which Stalin is striving with\r\nevery means, should spread over a greater part of the Ukraine. One\r\nshould protest that in the South Ukraine such a danger does not exist\r\nbecause of the lack of swamps and forests. The bandit leader Machino\r\nneeds to be remembered, he who for about 2 years terrorized the Ukraine\r\nand knew how to avoid all persecutions. One should also not place his\r\nhopes on the economic collapse of the Soviet Union. Certainly the\r\nlosses in fertile land, raw materials and industrial projects are very\r\nsignificant. On the other hand the Soviet Union still has the Ural\r\nterritory, fabulously rich in raw materials of all kinds, which for\r\nfourteen years has been industrially developed with all power, as well\r\nas rich Siberia. Finally we know that the Soviets have systematically\r\ncarried on an economic policy of hoarding reserves, and we cannot\r\ncompletely tie up the English-American reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we accomplish the proposed change in policy, then it can\r\nbe believed certain that the decomposition of the Red Army will also\r\nsucceed. For the power of resistance of the Red Army man is broken the\r\nmoment that he becomes convinced that Germany brings him a better life\r\nthan he has led under the Soviets, and that Germany has a small bit\r\nof consideration for his national qualities, in other words does not\r\nintend to rob him of his soul.\r\n\r\nThe problem is too serious to be allowed to remain undecided. Here it\r\nis a question of the future of the German race, under circumstances\r\nconcerning even its existence or non-existence. The permanent thesis of\r\nthe Main Department for Politics has proved itself true, that a quick\r\nvictory cannot be attained entirely by the aid of arms, but only in\r\nconjunction with the application of a great political offensive. That\r\nthe administration of the occupied Eastern territories is composed\r\nalmost entirely of personnel not acquainted with Russia is probably one\r\nof the reasons why this thesis has not been carried out. The gentlemen\r\nslowly grope their way into the problem, for which the majority still\r\nrequire interpreters. Nevertheless it is today already confirmed that\r\nwide circles of the lower administrative chiefs in the Ukraine are\r\nplainly frightened of the policy commanded by the higher echelon.\r\nHowever, they are not in a position to have their way. So much the\r\nmore reason one should trust the interpretation of the Main Department\r\nfor Politics based on the best technical and social knowledge; the\r\nDepartment is even today convinced of a speedy victorious conclusion of\r\nthe war, insofar as its political directives are followed.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 25 October 1942\r\n  Signed: BRAEUTIGAM\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 315-PS\r\n\r\nCopy\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 8, Wilhelmstr. 72, 12 March 1943\r\n  Reich Ministry for Food and Agriculture\r\n  Current No... IV/1a - 907\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n on a meeting held in the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and\r\n Propaganda on 10 March 1943\r\n\r\n Presiding: State Secretary Gutterer\r\n\r\n For the participating agencies see invitation list of 5 March, among\r\n others\r\n\r\n  Oberregierungsrat Hucho (GBA)\r\n  Reich Council for Agriculture Dr. Hatesaul\r\n  Referent Schwarz RNSI\r\n\r\n  Oberregierungsrat Dr. Brendler (Ministry for Food)\r\n\r\n _Subject_: Directives for treatment of foreign workers employed in the\r\n Reich.\r\n\r\nIn his introductory remarks, State Secretary Gutterer said that at the\r\nsuggestion of Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels the Fuehrer has decided that\r\nout of political considerations a uniform treatment of the problems\r\nconcerning foreigners will have to be secured immediately in all\r\nagencies and a corresponding education of the German people will have\r\nto be instituted.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of the new Europe and the increased anti-communist\r\ntrend which have been played up by the foreign propaganda office demand\r\nthat in the treatment of foreign workers in the Reich immediately every\r\nmaterial which would be an incentive for a hostile attitude on the\r\npart of the foreign workers should be eliminated. This is particularly\r\nnecessary in the treatment of the workers from the East. In this\r\ninstance the hitherto prevailing treatment of the Eastern workers has\r\nled not only to a diminished production, but has most disadvantageously\r\ninfluenced the political orientation of the people in the conquered\r\nEastern territories and has resulted in the well-known difficulties\r\nfor our troops. In order to facilitate military operations the morale\r\nhas to be improved by a better treatment of the Eastern workers in the\r\nReich.\r\n\r\nIn a decree issued 15 February to all district leaders [Gauleiter] and\r\nReich directors [Reichsleiter], Reich Ministry Dr. Goebbels has given\r\ncorresponding directives to party agencies. In order to instruct all\r\nother agencies, managers and trade union members who are concerned with\r\nArbeitseinsatz, the Reich Minister for Enlightenment and Propaganda\r\nhas planned directives; these directives, issued in a draft (see\r\nenclosure), served as a working basis for discussion.\r\n\r\nIn general the following is to be said about these directives:\r\n\r\nThe treatment of foreigners which until now was markedly different for\r\nsubjects of Western and Eastern countries will be put on a uniform\r\nbasis as much as possible, particularly the living standards of the\r\nEastern workers will be raised. The change introduced herewith in the\r\ntreatment of the foreigners will mainly affect the hitherto prevailing\r\nSecurity Police measures of the Reichsfuehrer SS and of the Main\r\nSecurity Office. The measures introduced by the management will be less\r\ninfluenced. In general, the decrees which have been issued by the GBA\r\nalready and which, among others, are dealt with in the note for the\r\nmanagers will be less affected. However, an increased repudiation of\r\nmistreatment and beatings will come into effect. Accordingly, a more\r\nsevere punishment is planned for those supervisors and under officials\r\nwho commit such offenses. During the meeting considerable doubts were\r\nvoiced by the representatives of the Main Security Office of the Reich\r\nand of the Party Chancellery. The former expounded the necessity for\r\nthe strict security police measures for the protection of the German\r\npopulation and for the security of the Reich. The representative of\r\nthe party chancellery particularly pointed out the controversies which\r\nalready are appearing and which would result for the German population\r\nif more freedom were granted to the foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Food Ministry is particularly interested in the following\r\npoints of the directives:\r\n\r\nUnder _Point 5_ it is declared that it is desired _to accommodate\r\nthe various nationalities separately_ in factories and camps. It was\r\npointed out by representatives of the GBA and Reichsnaehrstand that in\r\nthe future this cannot be carried out fully in agriculture too, because\r\nof reasons of the Arbeitseinsatz. However, with the warning that this\r\nmeasure is to be \"striven for\" in the future, permission has been given\r\nto avoid changes in personnel beyond those hitherto exercised and that\r\nthis principle will be considered by the GBA in cases of new draftees,\r\njust as it was done before.\r\n\r\n_Point 7_: In principle, the foreign workers should receive the same\r\nfood rations. To this, the undersigned remarks that the rations are\r\nvaried according to nationalities (Eastern workers, Poles, other\r\nforeigners) in order to account for the home customs. Also the\r\nrations are varied according to the types of work performed (camp\r\nrations, agricultural workers who provide their own food and special\r\nrations for individual employees of the factory). The rations of the\r\nforeign agricultural migrant labor differ insofar that on the basis\r\nof state contracts various allowances in kind are given to them for a\r\npart of their pay. A uniformity is being striven for. For the above\r\nmentioned reasons, however, a complete uniformity on the basis of the\r\nGerman allowances is impossible. The validity of these arguments was\r\nrecognized and the passage was deleted. Instead, clauses were added to\r\nthe effect that \"full rations, as laid down in the regulations, should\r\nbe distributed\" and that \"the rations for those performing heavy and\r\nextremely heavy work should be handed out only if the production is\r\naccordingly great\". Against these additional clauses no opposition was\r\nvoiced, final decision however was withheld.\r\n\r\n_Point 8_: The demanded _new basis for wages_ of the Eastern workers\r\nhas been discussed already by the departments. A corresponding draft\r\nof the GBA, equalizing the wages of Eastern and Polish workers, will\r\nreach the departments in the near future. This new regulation would\r\nfulfill an old wish of the Reich Food Ministry to equalize the wages\r\nof the Polish and Eastern workers in order to increase production and\r\nsimplify the pay procedure.\r\n\r\n_Point 9_: _Sick and pregnant female workers_ will not be _returned\r\nanymore_ since they usually spread negative propaganda in their\r\ncountry. Erection of dispensaries will meet with less difficulty in\r\nthe industry than in agriculture. However, they will be required\r\nin agriculture too in order to free the farms from the care of\r\nforeign workers. For the same reason, collective accommodations are\r\nnecessary for foreign children who were born in the Reich. Appropriate\r\nnegotiations are now in progress in the GBA.\r\n\r\nOn _page 7_ of the draft, all the above directives for all\r\norganizations, agencies and individuals are declared as binding; the\r\nagencies will be held responsible for the execution of these directives\r\nin an orderly fashion. The latter seems to be an extremely far-reaching\r\ndemand, since the execution of a great part of these directives does\r\nnot depend on the wish of the agencies but on the limited possibilities\r\nduring the 4th year of the war, such as providing adequate clothing,\r\nerection of barracks for the sick and for the foreign children born in\r\nthe Reich.\r\n\r\nAlso the suggested stricter punishment of infringements against these\r\ndirectives seems to be objectionable. The arrogant and recalcitrant\r\nattitude of some of the foreigners frequently forces the managers and\r\ntheir representatives to use sharp measures in order to keep up the\r\nproduction of the foreign workers. Insofar as certain abuses will\r\nemerge in this process and these are punished not only as unpolitical\r\ncriminal actions but as acts of sabotage and in some cases as high\r\ntreason, the positions of the managers and their representatives will\r\nbe considerably weakened before the foreigners, and uncertainties will\r\nresult in regard to the treatment of the foreigners. These will lead to\r\na marked lack of discipline on the part of the foreigners. It would be\r\ndesirable that the final decision should be against this clause.\r\n\r\nState Secretary Gutterer asked for comments on the draft by 16 March at\r\nthe latest. The Reich peasant leader [Dr. Hatesaul] agreed to deliver\r\nto us the comments of the Reichsnaehrstand immediately.\r\n\r\n  Dead line matter, 15 March 1943!\r\n\r\n To the Referat II B 2, II B 3, IV 9 in this building\r\n\r\nHerewith I forward above copy of notes on a meeting held 10 March and\r\na copy of the draft with the request for comment.

The Chief of the National Socialist German Association of University\r\nLecturers is bound by orders and directives of Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\nin all questions concerning intellectual and ideological training,\r\nresearch and education.\r\n\r\n2. The main task of the National Socialist German Association of\r\nUniversity Lecturers is to present the university lecturers a picture\r\nof the history, the formation and the tasks of the National Socialist\r\nmovement, and to coordinate them in accordance with our ideology with\r\nthe great political aims of the Reich. The training has to correspond\r\nwith the requirements of the body of university lecturers.\r\n\r\n3. Insofar as beyond this general education a supplementary training,\r\nthrough working communities, university camps, etc. is required--these\r\ntraining measures may be carried out with the provision that the tasks\r\nmentioned in Art. 6 are not encroached upon.\r\n\r\n4. The National Socialist German Association of University Lecturers\r\nis obliged to submit to the Reichsleiter all plans for working\r\ncommunities, conferences, camps, etc., with designation of topics and\r\nnames of the participants, always in time enough that the possibility\r\nof his changing them in accordance with his duty as a leader is\r\nassured. His objections and directives resulting from this are binding\r\nand authoritative for the National Socialist German Association of\r\nUniversity Lecturers. This applies accordingly to the work of the\r\nAssociation done abroad also.\r\n\r\n5. Publications will be limited to the above mentioned tasks and\r\nare to be submitted to the Main Bureau for Science 14 days before\r\npublication. All publications have to bear a remark that the scientific\r\nresponsibility for the individual contributions lies exclusively upon\r\nthe author,--in order to avoid the impression of an official party\r\nopinion. Reichsleiter Rosenberg will make the decision as to whether\r\nthe publications of the National Socialist German University Lecturers\r\nAssociation are to be published by the Hoheneichen press.\r\n\r\n6. When Reichsleiter Rosenberg plans for his mission, especially for\r\nthe seminary [Hohe Schule], the collection of professional groups in\r\nthe different fields of science, or the organization of scientific\r\nmeetings of university lecturers--the organizational measures will be\r\ncarried out by the National Socialist German Association of University\r\nLecturers.\r\n\r\n7. Judgments and opinions of the National Socialist German Association\r\nof University Lecturers concerning the appointments, assignments and\r\ntransfers of university lecturers are to be submitted to the Main\r\nBureau for Science and, at the same time, to the party chancery.\r\n\r\n8. The appointment of the educational director of the National\r\nSocialist German Association of University Lecturers will take place\r\nwith the approval of Reichsleiter Rosenberg. He will be called into\r\nthe Reich working community as a member for the education of the whole\r\nNS movement.\r\n\r\n Munich, the 2nd December 1941\r\n\r\n  Rosenberg\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer's Commissioner for the supervising\r\n  of the whole intellectual and ideological\r\n  training and education of the NSDAP and\r\n  Chief of the Seminary [Hohe Schule]\r\n  [Signature illegible]\r\n  Chief of the Party Chancellery\r\n\r\n [Signature illegible] Chief of the National Socialist German\r\n Association of University Lecturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 327-PS\r\n\r\n  DRMfdbO.\r\n  II 1 c 1183/44g.\r\n\r\n  Copies for the Political Main Staff Str. 19/10\r\n  Q 19/x: 20/10 Dr. Wetzelz.k W 21/10\r\n  P_{1} P_{2}\r\n  with request for acknowledgment, Dr. Kinkelein n.r.\r\n  Z.d.

I supervise the\r\nfollowing companies:\r\n\r\n (_a_) Zentralhandelsgesselschaft Ost fuer landwirtschaftlichen Absatz\r\n und Bedarf m.b.H. (ZO). (Central Trading Company East for Agricultural\r\n Marketing and Requirements Limited)\r\n\r\n (_b_) Landbewirtschaftungsgessellschaft Ostlund und Ukraine\r\n (Agricultural Development Company Eastern Territories and Ukraine)\r\n\r\n (_c_) Beschaffungsgessellschaft Ost m.b.H. (Supply Company East\r\n Limited)\r\n\r\n (_d_) Pharm.--Ost G.m.b.H. (Pharmaceutics--East Company Limited)\r\n\r\nThe following banks under my supervision are also not private firms:\r\n\r\n (_e_) Zentralnotenbank Ukraine (Central Exchange Bank Ukraine)\r\n\r\n (_f_) Notenbank Ostland (Exchange Bank Eastern Territories)\r\n\r\n (_g_) Zentralwirtschaftsbank Ukraine (Central Commercial Bank Ukraine)\r\n\r\n (_h_) Verband der Wirtschaftsbanken in der Ukraine. (Association of\r\n Commercial Banks in the Ukraine)\r\n\r\n (_i_) Gemeinschaftsbank Ostland und Weissruthenien. (Cooperative Bank\r\n Eastern Territories and White Ruthenia)\r\n\r\nThe liquidation of these companies and banks has been discussed with\r\nthe Reich Plenipotentiary for total war effort and will be brought to\r\na close not later than by the end of this year. Assets suitable for\r\nrestitution of the companies have already been earmarked for the armed\r\nforces and war economy. Therefore, any intervention with regard to\r\nstocks and personnel does not only impede the liquidation of business\r\nwhich is inevitably necessary but also delays the supply of goods to\r\nthe armed forces and war industry. For this reason I beg, to refrain\r\nfrom any intervention.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Party Chancellory has a copy hereof.\r\n\r\nEnclosed I am sending you a copy of my letter of today to the Reich\r\nPlenipotentiary for total war effort from which you will note that the\r\nliquidation of the companies under my supervision has been agreed upon\r\nwith the Reich Plenipotentiary and will be concluded at a relatively\r\nclose date considering the vast operations which are indispensable for\r\nthe liquidation in the interest of an orderly war economy. Restored\r\nproperty not yet surrendered has already been earmarked for the armed\r\nforces and war economy, so that any delay of the liquidation or perhaps\r\neven independent confiscation of the property by the Gau Leaders would\r\nimpair or destroy an organized plan, something that should not be done\r\nwithout a compelling reason in the interest of war economy. In order to\r\ngive you an idea of the past and present problems of these companies, I\r\nam attaching enclosed a corresponding survey.\r\n\r\nI beg you to acknowledge receipt of the telegram to the Gau Leaders.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to point out also that in my mind it is not correct\r\nto simply order the Gau Leaders under the heading \"actions against\r\ncivilians in rear echelons\" to press the speeding up of the liquidation\r\nof offices and establishments which have been brought back from the\r\noccupied territories. Without doubt cases have occurred where such\r\npressure was warranted by all means. On the other hand, it has been\r\nproven that, for instance, thousands of decent men and women as well\r\nas firms, who have done their duty under the most difficult conditions\r\nthere, have been brought back from the occupied territories and have\r\nrecognized the need of the hour immediately, but can simply not\r\ncomplete their work still necessary for the liquidation at present from\r\none day to the other. As far as the Eastern territories are concerned,\r\nthe above applies to the majority of the people assigned, so that I am\r\nobliged to regret that you also associate these people with the most\r\nill-reputed term of rear-echelon.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  Yours\r\n  Signed: A Rosenberg\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n(1). _Zentralhandelsgessellschaft Ost fuer landwirtschaftlichen\r\nAbsatz und Bodarf m.b.H. (Z.O.)._ (Central Trading Company East for\r\nAgricultural Marketing and Requirements Limited).\r\n\r\nThe following has been the mission of the Z.O. as a monopoly company\r\nfor the Eastern Territories:\r\n\r\n (_a_) Collection of all agricultural products as well as commercial\r\n marketing and transportation thereof. (Delivery to armed forces and\r\n the Reich),\r\n\r\n (_b_) Trusteeship of enterprises dealing with food supplies,\r\n\r\n (_c_) Providing enterprises dealing with food supplies with special\r\n equipment, supplying the agriculture with means of production and the\r\n rural population with commodities (premium goods).\r\n\r\nThe following is the present mission of the Z.O.:\r\n\r\n (_aa_) Winding up of transactions relative to commodities and\r\n finances, particularly utilization of evacuated goods brought back\r\n from the Eastern Territories and goods which did not come into use\r\n there any more,\r\n\r\n (_bb_) Collection of goods brought back from the agriculture and food\r\n industry of other occupied territories (General Government West),\r\n\r\n (_cc_) Remaining current business,\r\n\r\n (_a_) Fulfillment of the original assignments in the remainder of the\r\n Eastern Territories,\r\n\r\n (_b_) Inter-territorial exchange of machines for the agriculture as\r\n well as for the dairy industry and inter-territorial exchange of seeds\r\n according to directives of the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year\r\n Plan--business section food.\r\n\r\nThe actual significance of the Z.O. and the volume of its transactions\r\ncan be seen from the following:\r\n\r\n (1) 30 offices with 200 agencies were subordinated to each main office\r\n for the Eastern Territories, the Central District and the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n (2) 11 subsidiary companies of the food industry with 130 branches\r\n were founded in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n (3) The Z.O. including its subsidiary companies employed at the peak\r\n of its business during the summer of 1943 about 7,000 German party\r\n members of the Reich and in addition has set up about 250 German firms\r\n of the Reich.\r\n\r\n (4) The total turn-over of the Z.O. amounted to about 5.6 milliard\r\n Reichsmark, from its foundation until the 31st of March 1944.\r\n\r\n (5) During this period, the Z.O. together with its subsidiaries has\r\n collected:\r\n\r\n  Grain                         9,200,000 tons\r\n  Meat and meat products          622,000 tons\r\n  Linseed                         950,000 tons\r\n  Butter                          208,000 tons\r\n  Sugar                           400,000 tons\r\n  Fodder                        2,500,000 tons\r\n  Potatoes                      3,200,000 tons\r\n  Seeds                           141,000 tons\r\n  Other agricultural products   1,200,000 tons\r\n  Eggs                          1,075 million eggs\r\n\r\nThe following was required for transportation:\r\n\r\n 1,418,000 railroad box cars and 472,000 tons of boat shipping space.\r\n\r\n (6) A total of 32,900 box cars of evacuated goods has been brought\r\n back by the Z.O. of which\r\n\r\n  22,400 are grain, linseed and other seeds, etc.,\r\n  9,000  are agricultural machines, other machines, etc., and\r\n  1,500  are goods for supply and consumption.\r\n\r\nWhile the utilization of the evacuated agricultural products has been\r\ncompleted in the main part in spite of all difficulties by means of\r\ntransfer to the Reich Agencies, it has not been possible to effect the\r\nutilization of the remaining goods (machines, furniture, supply goods\r\netc.) in the same time and with as little friction. The utilization of\r\nthese goods is being effected with the cooperation of the Commissioner\r\nfor utilization of goods, Dr. Kemna, for the Reich Minister of Economy\r\nand the Reich Minister for Armament and War Production. Moreover, part\r\nof these goods which are composed of thousands of types of different\r\ngoods must first be overhauled and repaired.\r\n\r\nThe number of personnel of the Z.O. and its subsidiary companies has\r\nalready been reduced from 7,000 to 681 employees, exclusive of 50\r\nworkers who are still working in the Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\n(2). _Landbewirtschaftungsgessellschaft Ukraine_. (_Agricultural\r\nDevelopment Company, Ukraine_)\r\n\r\nThe Landbewirtschaftungsgessellschaft Ukraine (LBGU) had the following\r\nmissions (Figures according to status of 1st July 1943):\r\n\r\n (_a_) Supervisory management of almost 31,000 collective farms and\r\n agricultural cooperatives [former Kolhoze] with 1.7 million farms, of\r\n almost 540,000 individual farms with an area used for cultivation of\r\n maximum 38 million hektars (93.9 million acres)--24.5 million hectars\r\n (60.5 million acres) during summer 1943--,\r\n\r\n (_b_) Managing trusteeship of 1875 state-owned estates with an area\r\n used for agriculture of 2.8 million hectars (6.9 million acres),\r\n\r\n (_c_) Managing trusteeship of 72 breeding stations with an area of\r\n 124,000 hectars (306,400 acres), seed reproducing areas of 424,000\r\n hectars (1,047,700 acres),\r\n\r\n Trustee management of 17 offices for distribution of seeds of 270 seed\r\n distribution points and of 619 seed depots with a seed capacity of\r\n 192,000 tons.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Managing trusteeship of 900 machine and tractor stations (MTS)\r\nwith 49,600 tractors.\r\n\r\nThe LBGU maintained 1 central business office, 6 district offices (with\r\n5 branch offices), 114 regional offices, 431 county offices, 2,870 base\r\noffices and 400 supervisory bodies.\r\n\r\nThe LBGU has already completed the liquidation of the following affairs:\r\n\r\n (1) Management of the general enterprises (see above under _a_),\r\n\r\n (2) Management of the state-owned estates (see above under _b_),\r\n\r\n (3) Sheep-breeders association Ukraine,\r\n\r\n (4) Financial liquidation (balance-sheet of liquidation as of 1st July\r\n 1944 will be completed on 20th Oct. 1944).\r\n\r\nAt present the LBGU still attends to the following matters:\r\n\r\n (_aa_) Utilization of still remaining 5,400 tons of highly valuable,\r\n evacuated seeds (a total of 98,000 tons have been brought back), most\r\n of which will be transferred to the Landbau-Gesellschaft m.b.H. (Land\r\n Development Company Limited) founded recently by the Commissioner for\r\n the Four Year Plan,--termination by the end of this year--,\r\n\r\n (_bb_) Utilization of the rolling stock, parts of equipment and\r\n similar matters confiscated by the armed forces.\r\n\r\n (_cc_) Realization of the MTS evacuation depots and work shops. The\r\n personnel used in connection with this (90 civilians, 34 military\r\n personnel) occupied mainly with new problems regarding the employment\r\n of agricultural machines and the repair thereof. The transfer of\r\n these machines to the above mentioned Landbau-Gesellschaft has been\r\n projected in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe number of personnel employed by the LBGU has been reduced from\r\n4,500 German and Dutch workers as of 30 June 1943 to 410 as of 1st Oct.\r\n1944.\r\n\r\nOf these latter 248 were made available for other important war jobs,\r\nespecially in the general government, by way of orders and leaves from\r\npresent jobs. 28 employees are assigned to supervise 50,000 Ukrainian\r\nworkers in key-positions and skilled laborers of the LBGU. Another 90,\r\nas mentioned, are employed for the problems of utilizing agricultural\r\nmachines and for the repair thereof (see above _cc_). Consequently,\r\nonly 44 persons are employed to wind up the remaining affairs.\r\n\r\n(3). _Beschaffungsgesellschaft Ost m.b.H. (BGO).

So far the BGO has\r\ncollected about 1,000 carloads of evacuated goods. One part of these\r\nis directed by the B.G.O. to agencies charged with their utilization\r\nwhich operate under its management.

II h\r\n\r\n Directions concerning the Treatment of Jewish Property in the Reich\r\n Commissariat Ostland of 13 October 1941\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 1\r\n\r\nThe total, movable and immovable properties of the Jewish population in\r\nthe territories governed by the Reich's Commissioner for Eastern areas\r\nare placed under confiscation by the administration for the commission\r\nand the seizure according to the following regulations.\r\n\r\nPar. 2\r\n\r\nProperty is defined as movable and immovable objects along with all\r\naccessories, claims, commissions, rights and interests of all types.\r\n\r\nPar. 3\r\n\r\n1. The confiscation will be carried out by the Reich's commissioner\r\nfor the East or those officers who have been authorized by him. It can\r\nbe carried out by directives to individual persons or in general by a\r\nproclamation and can be limited to individual objects of wealth.\r\n\r\n2. The following shall be excluded from confiscation:\r\n\r\n_a._ That part of the household furniture which will take care of the\r\nbase essentials of life.\r\n\r\n_b._ Cash, bank and savings credit, as well as bonds, up to a total\r\nvalue of one hundred Reichsmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 4\r\n\r\n1. With the confiscation the previous owner loses all rights to dispose\r\nof the confiscated property.\r\n\r\n2. Whoever has confiscated property in possession or custody, will\r\nadminister it until further notice. The changing or disposal of the\r\nproperty or of its profits will only be allowed inside the bounds of\r\norderly management. All other measures taken beyond this will need the\r\napproval of the Reichs commissioner for the East or those agencies\r\nauthorized by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 5\r\n\r\n1. The property that is placed under confiscation can be brought under\r\nthe administration of the commission, so far as it is necessary for\r\norderly management.\r\n\r\n2. The assuming of control by the administrative commission will at the\r\nsame time be looked upon as confiscation.\r\n\r\n3. The Reichs commission for the East will issue directives about the\r\narrangement and management of this administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 6\r\n\r\n1. Confiscated property can be called in by the Reichs commissioner for\r\nthe East or by the agencies authorized by him.\r\n\r\n2. The disposal of the confiscated property will be left to the\r\nauthorized agencies.\r\n\r\n3. These agencies will decide with finality, using administrative\r\nmeans, on the debts which belong to the confiscated property. The\r\nresponsibility will be limited to the sales value of the confiscated\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 7\r\n\r\nBids for the purchase of the property which comes under confiscation\r\ncan be publicly advertised.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 8\r\n\r\nThe responsible authorities can demand information from everyone to\r\ncarry out their task.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 9\r\n\r\n1. The following will be punished with a prison sentence and monetary\r\nfine or one of those punishments.\r\n\r\n_a._ Those who will undertake to withdraw an object of value from the\r\noffices of the civil authorities or those installed with the authority\r\nfor disposal, or in any other manner to thwart, to evade, or to impair\r\nthe action of confiscation.\r\n\r\n_b._ Those who intentionally or carelessly do not fulfill in due time\r\nor completely one of those directives imposed upon him such as an\r\norder of execution or other directive of execution, and the report and\r\ninformation obligations concerning it.\r\n\r\n2. In severe cases the punishment is penal servitude. If the accused is\r\ncharged with willful disobedience or should it be any other especially\r\nsevere case the death sentence is authorized.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 10\r\n\r\nThe Reichs commissioner for the East will issue the necessary measures\r\nto carry out those directives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 11\r\n\r\nThe directive will go into effect on the day of its publication.\r\n\r\n  Riga, the 13 October 1941\r\n  The Reichs Commissioner for the East\r\n  Signed: LOHSE\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 343-PS\r\n\r\n  Field Marshal Milch\r\n\r\n  Berlin,--W 8, Leipzigerstrasse 7, 31 Aug 1942\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Himmler!\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your letter of the 25 Aug.

Any continuation of these experiments\r\nseems essentially unreasonable. However the carrying out of experiments\r\nof some other kind, in regard to perils at high seas, would be\r\nimportant. These have been prepared in immediate agreement with the\r\nproper offices; Major (M.C.) Weltz will be charged with the execution\r\nand Capt (M.C.) Rascher will be made available until further orders in\r\naddition to his duties within the Medical Corps of the Air Corps. A\r\nchange of these measures does not appear necessary, and an enlargement\r\nof the task is not considered pressing at this time.\r\n\r\nThe low-pressure chamber would not be needed for these low-temperature\r\nexperiments. It is urgently needed at another place and therefore can\r\nno longer remain in Dachau.\r\n\r\nI convey the special thanks from the supreme commander of the Air Corps\r\nto the SS for their extensive cooperation.\r\n\r\nI remain with best wishes for you in good comradeship and with\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Always yours\r\n  [Signed] E.

I agree with you in the expectations, which we connect with\r\nthe enlargements of the camps, begun with such success in East-Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Germany is best able to liberate the youth from\r\nthinking about small states and to explain to them the understanding\r\nfor the European obligation. Furthermore, I expect especially through\r\nthe conscription of entire age groups, that the military education\r\nwill make itself felt in the military aspect. Only the education of an\r\nentire age group has influence on the reserve situation. The reserve\r\nsituation of the Estonian and Latvian Legion is marked especially\r\nby the lack of noncommissioned officers and instructors. If we can\r\neliminate this lack by the universal military education of the growing\r\nage groups, that will mean for the future a considerable inner\r\nstrengthening of not small parts of our Northern front.\r\n\r\nThe first General directors as well as state directors in Estonia\r\nand Latvia in the meantime have been instructed, to create the legal\r\nbasis, which are necessary for the execution of required military\r\neducation. Obergebietsfuehrer Lueer could assure me that the inner\r\nreadiness exists on the part of the youth. Also the organization and\r\nleaders of the youth will never close their ears to this commitment.\r\nHowever, I must draw your attention to the doubts, which are in the\r\nway of the military education of the _Latvian and Estonian youth on\r\nGerman soil_; I have consciously refrained from issuing the necessary\r\norders on my own competence, but have asked Commissioner General to\r\ncause the countries own administration to publish the appropriate\r\norders. Because of their own orders, these agencies will also have\r\nto issue the specific orders for the individual commitments. This is\r\naccording to our policy, to relieve the German authorities from all the\r\nmore technical and administrative problems, which touch little on our\r\nleadership and educational mission, and to leave to the countries own\r\nadministration freedom of action.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the conferences which have taken place so far,\r\nit cannot be expected that General Dankers or Dr. Mae will order their\r\nyouth organizations on their own, to conduct the military education\r\nnot in Latvia or Estonia, but in East-Prussia or in Warthegau. This\r\nviewpoint is partly caused by the more or less expressed fear, to be\r\nsuspected by reactionary circles to favor a so called Germanization.\r\nGeneral Dankers and Dr. Mae can also point out, that the transfer\r\nof the Latvian and Estonian pre-military education of the youth\r\ncontradicts the above-mentioned principles, which we customarily\r\nobserve in the realm of the remaining administration. I cannot\r\ninclude a camp education, which primarily is to alleviate the most\r\ndire needs of an inadequate recruit training as a matter of our\r\nbasic German educational mission. In the military education camps,\r\nthe young Latvians are trained under Latvian leaders in the Latvian\r\nlanguage,--not because this is our ideal, but because absolute military\r\nnecessity demands this. If General Dankers or Dr. Mae express the\r\nwish, and they have done so, to conduct such camps on Latvian or\r\nEstonian soil, I am not able to oppose them with any serious reasons.\r\n\r\nI consider the arrangement of the most necessary suppositions for the\r\nfuture military service an immediate and simply practical mission of\r\nthe countries own youth activity. The permission, that the countries\r\nown youth organizations, even if only in part and under German\r\nleadership, can carry out the military education in the country,\r\ngives them a considerable power toward those circles, still opposing,\r\nand is also able to increase the enthusiasm, especially of the\r\nyouth. Our policy must adapt itself in the necessary extent toward\r\nthis immediate goal, to rouse the Baltic peoples to the highest war\r\neffort of all forces. I am sure that the adaptability and educational\r\ncapacity of the youth demand other measures from us, than those which\r\ncan be advocated by us in our policies toward the adult parts of the\r\npopulation. However, politics and the education of the youth must\r\nperform in common according to the necessities of war, which gives\r\nus the problem to mobilize all available forces for victory. Even\r\nunder these conditions, there are enough possibilities for Germany to\r\nexercise influence. The universal execution of the military education\r\nbased on compulsory service with regard to the location of the camp\r\ngives us the possibility to increase the share of the German camps. Two\r\nor three camps in Estonia and Latvia therefore act as advertising for\r\nthe camps within Germany; for in contrast to the Germanic peoples of\r\nthe West, the military education is no longer to be carried out through\r\n_voluntary enlistments, but through legal conscription_. The camps in\r\nEstonia and Latvia as well, will have to be under German leadership,\r\nand as military education camps of the Hitler youth, they must be a\r\nsymbol of our educational mission beyond Germany's borders.\r\n\r\nI consider the execution of the military education of the Estonian and\r\nLatvian youth not only a military necessity, but also a war mission of\r\nthe Hitler youth especially. I would be thankful to you, party member\r\nAxmann, if the Hitler youth would put itself at our disposal with the\r\nsame readiness, with which they have so far supported our work in the\r\nBaltic Area.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  [signed] Lohse\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 351-PS\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE REICH CABINET SINCE 30 JANUARY 1933\r\n\r\n_Reichs Chancellor_ Adolf Hitler, appointed 30 January 1933\r\n\r\n_Fuehrer and Reichs Chancellor_ since 2 August 1934\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+---------\r\n                      Name             | Appointed | Reappointed | Resigned\r\n  -------------------------------------+-----------+-------------+---------\r\n  The Deputy of the Reichs Chancellor  |           |             |\r\n     von Papen                         | 30.1.1933 |             |30.7.1934\r\n                                       |           |             |\r\n  1.

_Subject: The Political Situation._\r\n\r\nThe _Reichs Chancellor_ opens the session and explains that millions of\r\npeople within Germany would joyfully greet this day on which a Reich\r\nCabinet under his leadership had been appointed by the Reich President.\r\nHe asked the members of the Cabinet to give him their confidence as he\r\nhimself had confidence in each member of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThen the Chancellor stated that he intended to suggest to the Reich\r\nPresident the appointment of the Counsellor in the Ministry, Dr.\r\nLammers, to the post of State Secretary in the Reich Chancellor in\r\nplace of the retired State Secretary Planck, and the appointment of\r\nthe member of the Reichstag, Walter Funk, to the post of Director in\r\nthe Ministry and Director of the Press Office in place of the retired\r\nDirector in the Ministry, Marcks.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Cabinet took note of this. There were no objections against\r\nhis proposal.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Chancellor then opened a discussion about the political\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nReich Minister Goering stated that he had contacted the Center Party.\r\nThe Center Party felt offended because they had not been informed\r\nabout the development of the situation. As he had been informed Reich\r\nChancellor von Papen had not contacted the representatives of the\r\nCenter Party. He, Reich Minister Goering, was under the impression that\r\nthe Center Party expected certain concessions from the present Reich\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Economy and Reich Minister for Food and\r\nAgriculture stated that it would be wise to avoid any brusque actions\r\ntoward the Center Party. However, the representation of the Center\r\nParty in the Reich Cabinet was to be avoided since, in his opinion, it\r\nwould endanger the unity of decisions of that body.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Chancellor pointed out that adjournment of the Reichstag\r\nwould be impossible without the collaboration of the Center Party. One\r\nmight, however, consider suppressing the Communist Party to eliminate\r\nits votes in the Reichstag and by this measure achieve a majority in\r\nthe Reichstag. Based on his experiences, however, such suppressions of\r\nparties were of no avail. He was afraid that heavy political fights\r\nand possibly a general strike might be the result of this contemplated\r\nsuppression of the Communist Party of Germany. Surely the economy\r\nof the count needed settled conditions. If, however, one discussed\r\nthe question of the greater danger for the national economy, the\r\nuncertainty and unrest connected with new elections or a general\r\nstrike, then one had to arrive at the conclusion that a general strike\r\nwould be far more dangerous for the national economy.\r\n\r\nIt appeared flatly impossible to suppress the 6,000,000 people who\r\nstood behind the Communist Party of Germany. It might be possible,\r\nhowever, to achieve a majority for the new Reich Cabinet after\r\ndissolving the Reichstag and the new elections which had to fall soon.\r\nThe best thing, however, would be if the Reichstag should adjourn\r\nitself voluntarily.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Economy and the Reich Minister for Food and\r\nAgriculture explained that he certainly has no longing for a general\r\nstrike. In his opinion, however, it was impossible to avoid the\r\nsuppression of the Communist Party of Germany. If that were not done\r\none could not achieve a majority in the Reichstag, certainly not a\r\nmajority of two-thirds.\r\n\r\nAfter the suppression of the KPD the passage of an enabling law through\r\nthe Reichstag would be possible. He doubted that there would be a\r\ngeneral strike after the suppression of the KPD. He preferred the\r\nsuppression of the KPD to new elections.\r\n\r\nReich Minister Goering stated that the Communists had planned a\r\ndemonstration for this evening (30 January), which he had prohibited.\r\nOn the basis of his investigations the KPD would not be prepared for a\r\ngeneral strike at the present. The social democrats were pressing for a\r\ndiscussion in Reichstag.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion it would be best to dissolve the Reichstag as soon as\r\npossible and to hold new elections. The Reich Chancellor had given his\r\nword that the present constellation of the Reich Cabinet would not be\r\naltered even after new elections.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Chancellor confirmed the correctness of this statement.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Labor declared that there was great joy in the\r\nranks of the Steel Helmet [Stahlhelm] about the forming of the present\r\nReich Cabinet. There was no more friction between the Steel Helmet and\r\nthe SA.\r\n\r\nIn his opinion it would not be wise to let the first act of the present\r\nReich Cabinet consist in the suppression of the KPD which might result\r\nin a general strike.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy of the Reich Chancellor and the Reich Commissar for Prussia\r\npointed out that the German nation needed a rest. In his opinion it\r\nwould be best initially to request an Enabling Law from the Reichstag.\r\nIf such a law would not be passed the situation could be tackled anew.\r\nThe Reich Chancellor declared that the general strike was not to be\r\ntaken lightly. To suppress a possible general strike the Reichswehr\r\nshould not be committed, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Defense thanked the Reich Chancellor for this\r\nattitude and emphasized that the soldier is only used to thinking of\r\nhis opponent as an enemy from outside.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the question of\r\nwhether a suppression of the KPD with the possible consequence of a\r\ngeneral strike were to be preferred to new elections for the Reichstag\r\nunder foreign political consideration. He came to the conclusion that\r\na suppression of the KPD with the possible consequence of a general\r\nstrike would be, by far, the more serious outlook.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for Finance pointed out that the financial status\r\nof the Reich, the States, and the Counties could only be adjusted\r\nthrough a slow improvement of the economic situation. He regarded the\r\nsuppression of the KPD as a last political means. State Secretary Dr.\r\nMeissner proposed for the discussion whether an Enabling Law was to be\r\nproposed which would contain provisions for measures to be taken by\r\nthe Reich Cabinet in the interest of combating unemployment. Such an\r\nEnabling Law would only require a simple majority in the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nReich Commissar Dr. Gereke stated that the Center Party would not\r\ntolerate the Cabinet. Speedy new elections to the Reichstag would\r\nbecome necessary. The Deputy of the Reich Chancellor and the Reich\r\nCommissar for the State of Prussia suggested that the Reich Chancellor,\r\nin an interview, would state at the earliest opportunity that the\r\nrumors about the danger of inflation and the rumors about the danger\r\nof the rights of civil servants are untrue. The Reich Chancellor\r\nagreed to this. He further informed the meeting that he would contact\r\nrepresentatives of the Center Party in the morning of 31 January.\r\n\r\nA new meeting of the Ministers is to take place on 31 January at 4:00\r\np.m.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Cabinet took note of this.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Wienstein 31.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 352-PS\r\n\r\nCopy\r\n\r\n THE REICH MINISTER AND CHIEF OF THE REICH CHANCELLERY\r\n\r\n  Rk. 8008D\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 14 June 1942\r\n  Fuehrer's Headquarters\r\n\r\n To the Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration [General\r\n bevollmaechtigter die Reichs Norwaltung]\r\n\r\n Subject: The Jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers for the Defense\r\n of the Reich [Ministerats fuer die Reichsverteidigung]\r\n\r\nYour letter of 3 June 1942--CBV Nr. 493/42/2882--. Recently the Fuehrer\r\nannounced in accord with the opinions of the Reich Marshal of the\r\nGreater German Reich as shown in my letter of 20 Feb. 1940-RK. 624B-\r\nthat he believes it practical to reserve certain legislative missions\r\nfor the Reich Cabinet. With this he has not limited the competency\r\nof the Council of Ministers for the defense of the Reich but given a\r\ndirective as to how legislation should be handled under the point of\r\nview of practicability. I have no doubt that the Fuehrer, as well as\r\nthe Reich Marshal, have not changed their point of view, in particular\r\nregarding the fact that at the present there should be only legislation\r\nimportant in the cause of war, and that they will stress the fact that\r\nthe Fuehrer himself and the Reich Cabinet should not be eliminated\r\nfrom the powers of legislation. It will have to be tested from time to\r\ntime what measures will be reserved for the Reich Cabinet. My letter\r\nof 20 February 1940, and the opinions of the Fuehrer therein expressed\r\nmay serve as a directive even if the limitations indicated by me are\r\nno longer applicable in their full meaning. I would therefore suggest\r\nnot basing the discussions with the Reich Minister of Finance on the\r\nquestion of competency of the Reich Cabinet or the Council of Ministers\r\nfor the defense of the Reich, but on the question of whether it would\r\nbe practical to achieve settlement through either Reich law or a Decree\r\nfrom the Council of Ministers for the defense of the Reich in the sense\r\nof the opinions voiced by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. Lammers\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 374-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin Nr 234404 9.11.2355\r\n\r\n To all state police offices and state police administrative offices.\r\n --To director or his deputy.\r\n\r\n This teletype message is to be transmitted immediately in the most\r\n rapid way.\r\n\r\n1. Actions against the Jews and in particular against their synagogues\r\nwill occur in a short time, in all of Germany. They are not to be\r\nhindered.

Insofar as important archive material is present in the synagogues,\r\nit is to be secured by immediate measures.\r\n\r\n3. The seizure of some 20 to 30 thousand Jews in the Reich is to be\r\nprepared. Wealthy Jews above all are to be chosen. More detailed\r\ndirectives will appear in the course of this night.\r\n\r\n4. If, in the course of this action, Jews are found in possession of\r\narms then the sharpest measures are to be employed. Special troops of\r\nthe SS as well as the general SS can be drawn into the total action.

Only such measures are to be taken, which do not entail a danger to\r\nGerman life and property (for example: burning of synagogues only if no\r\nfire hazard is present in the neighborhood).\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the course of events tonight permits the use of the\r\nappointed officials for this purpose, as many Jews are to be seized,\r\nespecially wealthy ones, in all regions as can be accommodated in the\r\nprisons at hand. Moreover, only healthy, male Jews of not too great\r\nan age are to be seized.

The highest importance is to be placed on accuracy since the\r\nlist is to be printed.\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Jew baiting\r\n\r\nThe district directorate will set up a committee which has the task of\r\ndirecting and supervising the communities in the whole district. The\r\nstrength of this committee will be determined by the district directed.\r\nYou are to inform the Gau-propaganda directorate at once of the\r\ncommittees named. The Gau propaganda directorate will then set itself\r\nin coordinating with these committees through you.\r\n\r\n  _Present tasks of the committees._\r\n\r\nThe committee will form in all the local groups and support localities\r\nsuch committees whose names shall be known only to the district\r\ncommittee. The members of the sub-committees shall report to the\r\ndistrict committee the names of those Party members and other Germans\r\nwho buy from Jews. The district committee will publish articles whose\r\ncontent is such that it will point out to the miscreant members of the\r\nnation the shamefulness of their deed, and will make them aware of the\r\nshame to which they would be subjected if they were proceeded against\r\npublicly. This article must be arranged so that only the addresses of\r\nthose involved, the business and the time in which he made the purchase\r\nwill be given. The article should bear no signature and will be posted\r\non various posting spots. Further the committees have to secure female\r\nclerks from Jewish stores, who can then very easily name those who\r\npurchase in Jewish shops. This demands some caution and has to be done\r\nwith the greatest secrecy. The names of these clerks shall in no case\r\nbe mentioned. Negotiations are to be undertaken with the association\r\nfor the employed middle class so that it will prepare the means for\r\nthis action and will assume the responsibility of finding a new job in\r\nanother shop of equal importance in case the clerk loses her job. Her\r\nname must not be given, only the number.\r\n\r\nThe district directorate will point out in all gatherings of members\r\nor in all public gatherings that the Jew in all countries is again\r\ncarrying on a low attack which is greatly harmful to Germany. It must\r\nbe made clear to the masses that no German may buy from a Jew. It is\r\nalso to be demanded of the Party membership that it constantly bring\r\nthis to the attention of its friends and acquaintances. The Party\r\nmembership must go so far in the interest of the nation that it cease\r\nfriendship with best acquaintances if the latter continue to purchase\r\nfrom Jews. It must go so far that no German will speak to a Jew if it\r\nis not absolutely necessary, and this must be particularly pointed out.\r\n\r\nGerman girls who go with Jews are to be made cognizant of the\r\nshamefulness of their actions. A member of our party must, in no way,\r\nhave anything to do with such a person.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  Signed: Bang\r\n  Gau-Propagandaleiter\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 375-PS\r\n\r\nTOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 25 August 1938\r\n  General Staff of the 5th Section (German Air Force)\r\n  (Genstb. 5. Abteilung)\r\n  No. 28/38. TOP SECRET (G-2)\r\n  _For Commanders only_ [_CHEF-SACHE_]\r\n  THROUGH OFFICER COURIER ONLY\r\n\r\n Subject: Extended Case Green [GRUEN--code for Czechoslovakia.]\r\n Estimate of the Situation with Special Consideration of the Enemy.\r\n\r\n A. _Initial Political Situation_:\r\n\r\n1. The basic assumption is that France will declare war during the Case\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that France will only decide upon war if _active\r\nmilitary assistance by Great Britain_ is definitely assured.\r\n\r\n2. The Soviet Union will probably side immediately with the Western\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\n3. It is _not_ expected for the moment that other states will intervene\r\nagainst Germany.\r\n\r\n_The Dutch-Belgian area_ assumes in this connection much more\r\nimportance for the prevention of the war in Western Europe than during\r\nthe World War. This mainly as an advanced base for the air war.\r\n\r\n4. _The United States of America_ will immediately support the fight of\r\nthe Western Powers with strong ideological and economic means.\r\n\r\n5. _Italy, Nationalistic-Spain, Hungary and Japan_ are regarded as\r\nbenevolent neutrals.\r\n\r\n B. _Initial Military Situation_:\r\n\r\n1. The French-Czechoslovakian treaty provides for military assistance\r\nonly in the case of an _unprovoked_ attack. At least an agreement of\r\nthe French and British views as to the legal aspect has to be achieved.\r\nIf only for _political reasons_ we have to consider the 2nd day as the\r\nearliest possible day of war on a European scale. In cast of a 24 hour\r\nultimatum it would be the 3rd day.\r\n\r\n2. It is further assumed that the actual commencement of hostilities\r\nwill only take place after the French armed forces _have been\r\ntactically deployed_. That means within the fourth to eighteenth day.\r\nThis to\r\n\r\n a. use the deployment as a means of political pressure,\r\n\r\n b. and to be able to deploy the troops undisturbed.\r\n\r\n3. _The war aim of the Entente Powers_ is to be considered as the\r\novercoming of Germany through attacking its war economy. With other\r\nwords through a _long_ war.\r\n\r\n4. The following are possible methods of operation for the French army:\r\n\r\n a. to man and hold the Maginot-line,\r\n\r\n b. to march into Belgium and the Netherlands at the beginning of the\r\n war with the aim of occupying the Ruhr-territory.\r\n\r\n_All suppositions support the first alternative._\r\n\r\n5. _The French Air Force_ will probably attack both economic and German\r\nAir Force targets as well as military and communication objectives.\r\nThus no concentrated effect will be achieved at any one place.\r\n\r\n6. The _French Navy_ will probably cooperate through operations with\r\nthe _British sea power_ to supplant the North Sea blockade. The aim\r\nwill be the maintenance of naval predominance in the Atlantic and the\r\nWestern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n7. The _British Air Force_ is assumed to be committed from English\r\nbases against the Rhine-Westphalia industrial area and the North Sea\r\nports. Sooner or later the Belgium-Dutch neutrality will be violated.\r\n\r\nA _camouflaged aircraft reporting network_ in Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands has to be taken into account from the first day of the\r\nwar. No transfer to France on the part of the British Air Force need\r\nbe expected at the beginning of the war. Equally it is held to be out\r\nof the question for any large parts of the British armed forces to be\r\ntransferred to France.\r\n\r\n8. Provision seems to have been made for the use of North French ground\r\norganizations during the _course of the war_ at least by part of the\r\nattacking British Air Forces.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a relatively large number of civilian airfields in\r\nBelgium and the Netherlands seem to indicate the intention of moving\r\nadvanced elements of the air defenses of London (light fighters and\r\nreconnaissance aircraft) into this area after a while.\r\n\r\n9. Thanks to the expected neutrality of Poland, the active\r\n_participation of Soviet Russia_ will be largely restricted to the\r\nprosecution of the war in the Baltic.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, air attacks against East Prussia and the Baltic coast\r\nare to be anticipated and occasional raids on Berlin are regarded as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n10. The basic assumption in respect to _our own prosecution of the\r\nwar_ is that two war plane air forces will be available in the West at\r\nthe beginning of hostilities. There will be five war plane air forces\r\nin all after three to four weeks. The aim will be to bring about a\r\ndecision by the defeat of the Western powers.\r\n\r\n C. _Task of the German Air Force_:\r\n\r\nThe German Air Force has at present not all the forces necessary to\r\nseek a decision by attacking the enemy's war economy with the aid of\r\nthe navy. The prime responsibility of the German Air Force in the\r\npresent situation must be to help the armed forces immobilized opposite\r\na fortified front to achieve operational freedom.\r\n\r\n D. _Enemy War Plane Forces_:\r\n\r\n1. The _French Air Force_ will have on the 1st October some 640 war\r\nplanes in the front line units on French home territory of which not\r\nmore than 120 to 150 attain a modern standard of performance. Available\r\nreserves total about 320 obsolete war planes.\r\n\r\nThere are another 150 obsolete war planes in North Africa for use in\r\ncolonial war or against Southern Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the French home war plane units will be deployed\r\nfor the most part in the known areas of Eastern France at the\r\nbeginning of the war. They will be employed against various targets\r\n(air force targets, industrial and communications targets, military\r\ninstallations, Army targets) in the operational area as well as in\r\ndepth according to the capabilities of their personnel and equipment.\r\n\r\nAny transfer of more than insignificant forces to Czechoslovakia is\r\nregarded as outside the range of practical possibilities, as is the\r\nconcentrated commitment of large formations against the armies fighting\r\nin Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n2. _The British war plane force_ will consist of some 850 war planes on\r\nOctober 1st of which 300 to 350 can be regarded as modern. The majority\r\nof the front line aircraft as well as some 200 to 300 reserve aircraft\r\ncan be described as only conditionally serviceable in the face of\r\nmodern defences.\r\n\r\nDue to their inadequate range the present British war plane formations\r\nare _not_ in a position to carry on a _vigorous_ air war from their\r\nhome bases only without violating sovereign Dutch or Belgian territory.\r\n\r\nEven if Dutch and Belgian neutrality is ignored only the modern war\r\nplanes need to be taken into account as a serious threat to the Ruhr.\r\n\r\nA transfer of British Air Forces to Northern France is to be expected\r\nat the earliest, after several weeks of war.\r\n\r\nIf the French Army Command decides to march through Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands the immediate influx of British fighters into this area\r\nbecomes probable.\r\n\r\nHeavy attacks against the North Sea ports by carrier based aircraft\r\nneed not be reckoned with:\r\n\r\n _a._ because the equipment and training of these aircraft is designed\r\n to fit them for specific naval tasks;\r\n\r\n _b._ because aircraft carriers, due to their vulnerability, will be\r\n committed in the North Sea only for very pressing reasons, which do\r\n not exist in this instance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand occasional attacks by coastal aircraft forces against\r\ntargets on the North Sea coast are feasible and probable.\r\n\r\n E. _Enemy Aircraft Industries_:\r\n\r\n1. The first aircraft put into mass production as a result of the\r\nexpansion of _French military aircraft industry_ during the years 1934\r\nto 1938 are at present rolling off the assembly lines. At the moment\r\nthe aero-engine factories are lagging behind with deliveries.\r\n\r\nIn August 1938 forty single-engined and thirty twin-engined military\r\naircraft were delivered to the French Air Forces. It must be assumed\r\nthat these figures will be increased during the coming months to 100\r\naircraft a month, 50 single-engined and 50 twin-engined.\r\n\r\nA further moderate increase in production is possible and to be\r\nexpected from spring 1939 on.\r\n\r\n2. _In Great Britain_ existing plants have been extended since 1936\r\nwith the aid of State funds and the effect on the armament situation\r\nwill begin to make itself felt increasingly from 1939 on. If the\r\npresent plans will be observed the program will be completely carried\r\nout by 1941.\r\n\r\nPresent production (August 1938) is estimated at some 200 aircraft\r\nof _all types_ (commercial and military aircraft) a month. It\r\nmust be noted that the import of training aircraft and long-range\r\nreconnaissance aircraft from the United States and Canada is intended.\r\n\r\n3. _North American aircraft industry_ (United States and Canada) is at\r\nthe moment fully occupied. No notable expansion has yet taken place but\r\nis possible. A possible expansion would have no practical effects in\r\n1939.\r\n\r\n250 aircraft of _all types_ (commercial and military) a month for the\r\nhome and foreign market may be stated as the present production rate.\r\nAppreciably more aircraft engines are manufactured.\r\n\r\n F. _Position with regard to preparation of target data_:\r\n\r\n1. It is proposed to supply units on or before 5th October with the\r\nfollowing _target data for France_:\r\n\r\n _a._ Air Force (airfields, air parks and equipment depots, air force\r\n fuel dumps). About 90% of existing installations are included.\r\n\r\n _b._ _Fuel Supply._\r\n\r\n 100% of the refineries are included and 60% of the total storage\r\n capacity (including the above-mentioned Air Force fuel dumps).\r\n\r\n_c._ _Ammunition Supply._\r\n\r\n An estimated 70% to 80% of the total productive capacity of explosive\r\n and gunpowder factories and 17 large supply dumps (main ammunition\r\n depots and ammunition depots, Army and Air Force) are included.\r\n\r\n_d._ _Power Supply._\r\n\r\n All the large power plants are included.\r\n\r\n_e._ _Key Industries._\r\n\r\n In particular the Paris aero-engine industry has been included.\r\n\r\n_f._ _Targets in the Paris area._\r\n\r\n Further target data, particularly for essential industrial targets,\r\n are accumulating currently.\r\n\r\n In addition, command authorities will receive maps of the tactical\r\n situation and of target groups on or before the above-mentioned date.\r\n\r\n2. Basic target maps of British ground organization (airfields) are\r\napproximately 90% ready. They have been passed on to Air Force Group\r\n2 for printing and for the adding of sectional excerpts of maps. They\r\nhave been ordered to be ready by 15 September.\r\n\r\nAs far as essential industrial targets are concerned, work has been\r\ncarried out on the food and crude oil supply systems and docks in\r\nthe London and Hull areas (basic target maps, sector maps, partially\r\ncovered also by aerial and ground panoramas).\r\n\r\nThese will be reproduced after the ground organization targets have\r\nbeen printed. They cannot be expected to be ready before 20 October.\r\n\r\nTactical maps and target maps of London and Hull will be issued to the\r\ncommand authorities prior to the end of September.\r\n\r\n3. The basic target maps of the Air Force objectives for _Belgium and\r\nthe Netherlands_ are ready for printing. Reproduction and distribution\r\n(including sector maps) will probably be possible only during October.\r\n\r\n4. In general it must be emphasized that, unlike Czechoslovakia, there\r\nare relatively very few aerial photographs of Western European targets\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n G. _Recommendations for our own Prosecution of the Air War._\r\n\r\n1. A negative answer must be given to the question as to whether it is\r\nappropriate to postpone the massed commitment of our striking power\r\nuntil the spring. The _balance of force_ would probably have altered\r\nby that time to our disadvantage due to further progress of French and\r\nBritish aircraft industry and imports from North America.\r\n\r\n2. From a _climatological_ point of view the autumn offers _our_ forces\r\ngreater prospect of success than the enemy, due to our relatively good\r\ntraining in instrument flying.\r\n\r\n3. As our forces must be regarded as small, even if we accept the\r\nfigure of 5 air forces as a basis, the task can only be fulfilled by\r\nconcentrated blows directed against the enemy's weakest points.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose choice of targets must be made with the greatest care\r\nand must be restricted to the decisive points.\r\n\r\n4. As long as only _2 air forces_ are available prosecution of the war\r\non the _basis of gaining time is advisable_. This is seen in attacks\r\nagainst the enemy _air forces_ in the airfields where they are deployed\r\nin Eastern France, with a view to prevent complete aerial predominance\r\nby the enemy.\r\n\r\n_Attacks on Paris_ should only be carried out as a reprisal, especially\r\nas the air defences in and around Paris are strong. Such attacks must\r\nhowever be possible at all times.\r\n\r\nDirect _cooperation with the Army_ is only considered desirable if the\r\nenemy deploys or advances in such strength as to endanger the Western\r\nGerman fortifications by a break through or out-flanking.\r\n\r\nSupport for the Army will be supplied in this case by attacks:\r\n\r\n _a._ against transports, troop concentrations and movements,\r\n\r\n _b._ against enemy war planes, should these cooperate with his armed\r\n forces in great numbers.\r\n\r\nShould there be danger of a penetration of the Western fortifications,\r\na further measure would be to concentrate _fighter forces_ scattered in\r\nthe West on the decisive ground front.\r\n\r\nAttacks against objectives in the _British Isles_ are to be regarded as\r\nunjustifiable in view of the small numbers of our combat forces.\r\n\r\nShould the enemy remain on the defensive in the ground war and withdraw\r\nwith his war plane forces to the West there will be no urgent reason\r\nfor us to commit our own forces. In this case it would seem better to\r\nsave our forces until reinforcements arrive.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as _strong forces_ are freed for the prosecution of the war\r\nin the West, operations in the air must be directed without delay at\r\n_reaching a decision_.\r\n\r\nIt would seem possible to achieve this end by attacking:\r\n\r\n _a._ fuel refineries and dumps;\r\n\r\n _b._ gunpowder and high explosive factories, _main ammunition depots\r\n and ammunition depots_;\r\n\r\n _c._ the most important parks handling imports which are also centers\r\n for the transfer and reshipment of fuel and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThus the enemy's fuel and ammunition supply system for his ground and\r\nair forces would be paralyzed or at least curtailed to an intolerable\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the individual groups of targets are one after the other\r\nsuccessively attacked until eliminated it would appear that by the use\r\nof 5 air forces a sufficient measure of success could be achieved to\r\nenable the Army to break through the enemy's fortified front.\r\n\r\n_No_ large-scale operations against targets in _the British Isles_\r\ncould be carried out in addition to this task.\r\n\r\nEverything should however be prepared to make _reprisal attacks_\r\nagainst London possible at any time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the strength of the air defences in and around London\r\nsuccess in such attacks is only likely if _strong_ forces are committed.\r\n\r\nIn addition occasional _harassing attacks_ against targets in South\r\nand Southeast England may be worthy of consideration, particularly if\r\nthe weather enforces a lull in France. A secondary aim of such attacks\r\nwould be to pin down strong defence forces in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n6. Should still stronger war plane forces--at least 3 air forces--be\r\navailable after the French targets had been successfully attacked, they\r\nmight be committed to advantage in attacks against the _food supply\r\nof Great Britain_, notably of London. It must however be emphasized\r\nthat it is only regarded as possible to achieve decisive successes if\r\nconsiderably stronger forces are committed and if the western ports are\r\nalso subjected to air attacks.\r\n\r\n H. _Requests to Armed Forces Supreme Command, Army and Navy_:\r\n\r\n1. The use of the Condor Legion against the refineries in Bordeaux and\r\npossibly against those in Marseilles would valuably supplement our\r\nattacks of the French fuel supply system.\r\n\r\n2. The ammunition situation has to be rendered precarious for the enemy\r\nas soon as possible. Therefore the armed forces should accompany the\r\nair attacks against the ammunition supplies with synchronized offensive\r\nthrusts. Special attention should be directed towards the ammunition\r\nsupplies stored in the Maginot Line itself and accessible to air attack.\r\n\r\n3. The Navy should hamper _imports_ through the French Atlantic ports\r\nto as great an extent as is compatible with its other tasks and the\r\nforces available. Especially for some 2-3 months at the beginning of\r\nthe attack against the fuel supply of France.\r\n\r\n4. Belgium and the Netherlands would, _in German hands_, represent an\r\nextraordinary advantage in the prosecution of the air war against Great\r\nBritain as well as against France. Therefore it is held to be essential\r\nto obtain the opinion of the Army as to the conditions under which\r\nan occupation of this area could be carried out and how long it would\r\ntake. In this case it would be necessary to reassess the commitment\r\nagainst Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  Signed: For: WOLTER\r\n\r\n  1 inclosure\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  Chief of German Air Force Operations Staff\r\n  General Staff/5th Section (Draft)\r\n  1. copy with 1 inclosure\r\n  2. copy with 1 inclosure\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 376-PS\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\n  FUEHRER'S H.Q.\r\n  29/10/40\r\n\r\n  Major (General Staff) Freiherr von Falkenstein\r\n  [Addressed to an unspecified General] \"Chefsache\"\r\n\r\nIn order to supplement today's telephone conversation of 10:00 A.M. I\r\ntake the liberty of submitting to you a brief resume of the military\r\nquestions current here for _your personal information_ before I go on\r\nleave. Major Queisner, my deputy, is informed of the questions touched\r\non here and can supply further information if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe exception is Gibraltar, General Warlimont having requested that\r\nall inquiries be made to him, as this territory is regarded as a\r\nparticularly ticklish business.\r\n\r\n1. At the moment no intervention in Greece is intended. Nor for the\r\nmoment is anything to be undertaken with regard to Crete.\r\n\r\n2. The question of _beginning preparation_ in Libya in _conjunction\r\nwith Italy_ is to be examined in the light of a report by General\r\nRitter von Thoma, which will be received during the next few days.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this report a proposal is to be submitted to the\r\nFuehrer by Field Marshal Keitel with regard to strength required, date\r\nof offensive, etc. Field Marshal Keitel and Marshal Badoglio will then\r\nmeet in mid-November and will settle details. Large-scale preparations\r\nshould not be expected before then.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster-General (Colonel Langemeyer) has been informed by us\r\nof the necessity for timely disposal of special war material, equipment\r\nand clothing.\r\n\r\n3. No orders respecting Case East [Fall Ost] have been given and no\r\norders are to be expected at the moment.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the Russian action against Rumania is dismissed as a\r\ntrifling matter.\r\n\r\nTransports to Rumania are proceeding according to plan as ordered by\r\nthe Fuehrer and are not to be speeded up.\r\n\r\n4. No activity should be expected at present on the part of Spain. The\r\nconversation between the Fuehrer and Franco therefore covered only\r\neconomic collaboration and long-term developments.\r\n\r\nThe Gibraltar affair should not however be lost to mind though it will\r\nhave to be treated with extreme care.\r\n\r\nThe Army will shortly send a small reconnaissance staff\r\n[Erkundungsstab] to Spain where it will cooperate with Admiral\r\nCanaris: this has been authorized by the Fuehrer. The GAF will request\r\npermission to participate on its own account.\r\n\r\nThere will be further orders from the Armed Forces Supreme Command; the\r\ndetails requested in tele-printer message 00 926/40 are required for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n5. The Fuehrer is at present occupied with the question of the\r\noccupation of the Atlantic Islands with a view to the prosecution of\r\nwar against America at a later date. Deliberations on this subject are\r\nbeing embarked upon here. Essential conditions are at the present:--\r\n\r\n _a._ No other operational commitment,\r\n\r\n _b._ Portuguese neutrality,\r\n\r\n _c._ Support of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nA brief assessment of the possibility of seizing and holding air bases\r\nand of the question of supply is needed from the GAF.\r\n\r\nMajor Queisner will fetch the documents for himself from Ic Kurferst\r\n(C. in C. GAF Rear Hq.). I would like to ask Colonel Schmidt to arrange\r\nthat he be supplied with the information he desires.\r\n\r\n6. C. in C. Armed Forces Norway has expressed fears that as a result\r\nof the Order: Armed Forces Supreme Command, Armed Forces Operations\r\nStaff/Abteilung L. No. 35 331/40 top secret and Chefsache dated\r\n22/10/40 greater activity on the part of the British will develop\r\nagainst Norway, and has requested naval and air force reinforcements.\r\nThe question of moving Stuka Staffeln was touched upon. I expressed my\r\nopinion that Stuka units had at present to prepare for other tasks, but\r\nwould however request that the matter be further examined.\r\n\r\n7. General von Boetticher has made repeated reference, especially\r\nin his telegram 2314 dated 26/10, to the fact that in his opinion\r\ntoo many details of our knowledge of American aircraft industry are\r\nbeing published in the German press. The matter has been discussed\r\nat Armed Forces Supreme Command. I pointed out that the matter was\r\na specifically GAF one, but have taken the liberty of referring the\r\nmatter to you on its own merits.\r\n\r\n  [Signed] Falkenstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 382-PS\r\n\r\n  _WRITTEN STATEMENT BY\r\n  KORVETTENKAPITAN MOEHLE\r\n  DATED 19th JULY, 1945_\r\n\r\nA. _Order of September, 1942_\r\n\r\nIn September 1942 (I can no longer recollect the exact date), the\r\nfollowing W/T message was given to all U-boats and operational\r\nflotillas by the Commander in Chief U-boats in officers' cypher, i.e.\r\nTop Secret:--\r\n\r\n 1. \"All rescue measures such as righting of capsized life-boats,\r\n going alongside, provisioning, towing to land, etc., are absolutely\r\n forbidden and must cease.\r\n\r\n 2.

In\r\nview of my knowledge of the way in which the Staff of the Chief Command\r\nU-boats worked, I consider it quite impossible that an order of such\r\nimportance could have been given without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the order was given with the concurrence\r\nor at the instigation of the Supreme Command, i.e. the Fuehrer's\r\nheadquarters, or at the instigation of the Fuehrer himself after one of\r\nhis many conferences with Grand Admiral Doenitz.\r\n\r\nAs Senior Officer of the 5th U-boat Flotilla, it was my duty to pass\r\non these instructions of Commander in Chief U-boats to Commanding\r\nOfficers of U-boats which were leaving on their war patrols.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the order itself, it undoubtedly states, and in\r\nparticular for those who know the manner in which Commander in Chief\r\nU-boats is wont to give his orders, that the High Command regard it as\r\ndesirable that not only ships but also their crews should be regarded\r\nas objects of attack, i.e. that they should be destroyed; at that time\r\nGerman propaganda was continually stressing the shortage of crews for\r\nenemy merchant ships and the consequent difficulties. I too understood\r\nthis order in that way.\r\n\r\nHad the point of view of the High Command been otherwise the order\r\nwould undoubtedly have been expressed in different words. It would then\r\nonly have stated that for reasons of security rescue measures were to\r\ncease and this order would have been passed as a normal secret W/T\r\nmessage. It was perhaps even the intention that this order could be\r\ninterpreted in two ways and the reason may be that in the first place,\r\nit contravenes international laws of warfare and secondly, that it was\r\nan order which must give rise to serious conflicts of conscience in\r\ncommanding officers.\r\n\r\nIt was very difficult for me as senior officer of the Flotilla to ask\r\nfor clarification of this order from the Commander in Chief U-boats\r\nsince while I was senior officer (15.6.41-5.5.45) I could only,\r\nowing to lack of time, visit the Commander in Chief U-boats four\r\nor five times. I could not discuss this order with officers on my\r\nstaff as all messages in officers' cypher might only be received by\r\nme. I was moreover of the opinion that commanding officers who were\r\nuncertain as to the meaning of this particular point always had the\r\nopportunity (an opportunity which they often took on other points) to\r\nobtain a clear understanding of this point when they went for their\r\ninstructions to the staff of Commander in Chief U-boats itself; these\r\ninstructions by the staff of the Commander in Chief U-boats were for\r\nthe great part given by very young officers with much more recent\r\noperational experience than I had--the officers on Commander in Chief\r\nU-boats' staff changed frequently. Generally speaking, with very few\r\nexceptions, commanding officers received their instruction from the\r\nstaff of Commander in Chief U-boats after I myself had given them their\r\ninstructions. Commanding officers were generally speaking in much\r\ncloser personal contact with these young staff officers than they were\r\nwith myself as senior officer of a purely transit flotilla. There were\r\nmany commanding officers whom I only saw and got to know for a few\r\ndays in Kiel while they were fitting their boats out for operations.\r\n\r\nHaving given considerable thought to the whole of this matter I\r\nnow remember that during one of my visits to Commander in Chief\r\nU-boats' staff in the winter of 1942/3 or the summer '43, one of the\r\nstaff officers, Korvettenkapitaen Hessler or perhaps more likely\r\nKorvettenkapitaen Kuppisch, with whom because of very close ties of\r\nfriendship I used to converse intimately as long as he was Commander\r\nin Chief U-boats' staff, told me of the following occurrence (whether\r\nI broached the subject or how the matter came up I can no longer\r\nremember).\r\n\r\nA type VII boat (500-tonner) reported in her war log that when outward\r\nbound from a base in France, she met far out in the Bay of Biscay a\r\nraft with five enemy airmen, but was not able to take them on board\r\nowing to shortage of room (she had a complement of 54 and carried full\r\nprovisions for 14 weeks). The boat therefore proceeded without taking\r\nany notice of the survivors.\r\n\r\nThis action of the U-boat was vehemently denounced by the Commander\r\nin Chief U-boats' staff. It was stated that she would have acted more\r\ncorrectly in destroying this raft since it was highly probable that the\r\nenemy air crew would be rescued by the enemy and in the meantime might\r\nonce more have destroyed a German U-boat.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence made the views of the Commander in Chief U-boats clear\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nAs concerns making the order known to commanding officers: the order\r\nwas always passed on during a commanding officers' conference while\r\ntheir boats were having their final overhaul or while they were being\r\nfitted out in Kiel for operational patrols; during these conferences I\r\npassed on to commanding officers once again all important orders about\r\nthe equipping of their boats, procedure on departure, in home waters\r\nand while in convoy to Norway. Operational orders were not given by\r\nthe flotilla; they were always given by the Commander in Chief U-boats\r\nhimself or by Captain U-boats West on his behalf.\r\n\r\nI was wont to pass on this controversial and serious order with more or\r\nless the following words:--\"I have now to inform you of a High Command\r\norder concerning conduct towards survivors. It is a very ticklish\r\nmatter. Commander in Chief U-boats in September 1942 gave the following\r\norder in an 'officers only' signal ( ... the exact words of the order\r\nwere then read out).\"\r\n\r\nSince I am myself in my innermost conscience in disagreement with this\r\norder, I was very glad that in most cases commanding officers raised no\r\nqueries and I was therefore relieved of any further discussion on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nSometimes however queries were raised and I was wont to answer somewhat\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I will explain the viewpoint of the High Command, which gave this\r\norder, by reference to the following event\": I then mentioned the\r\nexample of the Type VII boat in the Bay of Biscay together with the\r\nexplanation and viewpoint expressed to me by Commander in Chief\r\nU-boats' staff. I then went on to say, \"Gentlemen, you must yourselves\r\ndecide what is compatible with own consciences. The safety of your own\r\nboat must always remain your prime consideration.\"\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of total underwater war (\"Schnorchel\"), I have\r\nin this connection in various ways further stated that commanding\r\nofficers were in a much easier position in this respect since they had\r\nno occasion to surface and that the order was therefore illusory for\r\nthem. They had to keep clear of everything which was not worth the\r\nfiring of a torpedo.\r\n\r\nI also remember that many commanding officers after the order of\r\nSeptember 1942 had been read said, \"That is quite clear and unequivocal\r\nhowever hard it may be\". Had this order been given to me as a\r\ncommanding officer I would have taken note of it in silence but in\r\npractice would always have been able with a clear conscience not to\r\ncarry it out since I consider I would endanger my own boat by acting in\r\nthis way, (i.e., by shooting at life-boats).\r\n\r\nIf therefore U-boat commanding officers state that they had received\r\nfrom me the order to destroy life-boats, this does not correspond with\r\nthe facts, but they received from me quite insufficiently clearly\r\nexpressed instructions from the High Command together with my personal\r\nviews thereon.\r\n\r\nBefore the order of September 1942 was issued I never discussed this\r\ndifficult question at a commanding officers' conference and the subject\r\nof conduct towards survivors was never broached.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Conduct Towards Neutral and Hospital Ships_\r\n\r\nOn this matter, which I treated together with what has gone before, I\r\ngave commanding officers the following directions:\r\n\r\nThere was an express order of the High Command, and Commander in Chief\r\nU-boats was adamant on this point and would relentlessly pursue the\r\nbreach of it by court martial (i.e., he insisted on the order being\r\nstrictly obeyed), that no neutral or Red Cross ship might be molested\r\neven if the enemy misused neutral flags or the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nThe political results of sinking a neutral were much more serious than\r\nwould have been the usefulness of the tonnage sunk.\r\n\r\nI told commanding officers for their guidance in doubtful cases--in bad\r\nvisibility, when neutral markings were not distinct, etc.--that it was\r\nbetter to allow five enemy vessels to go free than to sink one neutral.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the stopping and examination of neutrals, an order\r\nwas made in January 1944 that in particular Spanish and Portuguese\r\nsteamers in the North and Central Atlantic were to be stopped and\r\nexamined for contraband and members of enemy nations of military age.\r\nI told commanding officers \"Don't touch them. Stay underwater. You are\r\nendangering yourselves too much by that because you will certainly\r\nbe reported by wireless and we know from experience that when such\r\nexaminations are made watchfulness is liable to suffer. You are only\r\nexposing yourself to the danger of being surprised. If a ship carries\r\nneutral markings let it go by unscathed.\"\r\n\r\nObjection was often made that German hospital ships had often been\r\ndestroyed by the enemy, as German propaganda had stressed for years.\r\nMy answer was: That does not matter, however unpleasant it may be. The\r\norder of the High Command is decisive and binding. Politics come before\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Rendering of Reports_\r\n\r\nThere was an order--I do not remember whether it was in the form of a\r\nwritten or verbal instruction--that no events during a war patrol which\r\ncontravened established international agreements should be entered in\r\nthe war log. I believe that the reason for this order was that eight\r\ncopies were made of war logs and were available to many authorities;\r\nthere was always the danger therefore that events of this nature\r\nwould become known and it was undoubtedly undesirable for reasons of\r\npropaganda that this should be so.\r\n\r\nEvents of this nature were only to be reported if asked for when\r\ncommanding officers made their personal reports; these were invariably\r\nmade after every patrol to Commander in Chief U-boats or later in\r\ncertain instances to Captain U-boats.\r\n\r\nI also gave the commanding officers instructions on this point.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I can only stress that the order of September 1942\r\nappeared to me personally to go too far and I am in total disagreement\r\nwith it at heart. As a serving officer I had however to carry out\r\nthe command to pass on this order to commanding officers for their\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nDuring the long time that I was senior officer of the Flotilla no\r\nsingle commanding officer mentioned to me that he could not reconcile\r\nobedience to this order with his conscience and that he was therefore\r\nunable to carry it out.\r\n\r\nAn order of this nature was never given by me, i.e. on my own\r\ninitiative, and could not be given by me since, had I exceeded my\r\nauthority in so serious a way, I would immediately and without question\r\nhave been relieved.\r\n\r\n  [signed] MOEHLE\r\n  Korvettenkapitaen\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 386-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 10 Nov 1937\r\n\r\n  NOTES on the Conference in the Reichskanzlei\r\n  on 5 Nov 37 from 1615-2030 hours\r\n\r\n Present: The Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor\r\n\r\n The Reichsminister for War, Generalfeldmarschall v. BLOMBERG\r\n\r\n The C-in-C Army, Generaloberst Freiherr von FRITSCH\r\n\r\n The C-in-C Navy, Generaladmiral Dr. h. c. RAEDER\r\n\r\n The C-in-C Luftwaffe, Generaloberst GOERING\r\n\r\n The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs Freiherr v. NEURATH\r\n\r\n Oberst HOSSBACH\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer stated initially that the subject matter of today's\r\nconference was of such high importance, that its further detailed\r\ndiscussion would probably take place in Cabinet sessions. However,\r\nhe, the Fuehrer, had decided NOT to discuss this matter in the\r\nlarger circle of the Reich Cabinet, because of its importance. His\r\nsubsequent statements were the result of detailed deliberations and\r\nof the experiences of his 4-1/2 years in Government; he desired to\r\nexplain to those present his fundamental ideas on the possibilities and\r\nnecessities of expanding our foreign policy and in the interests of a\r\nfar-sighted policy he requested that his statements be looked upon in\r\nthe case of his death as his last will and testament.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer then stated:\r\n\r\nThe aim of German policy is the security and the preservation of the\r\nnation, and its propagation. This is, consequently, a problem of space.\r\n\r\nThe German nation is composed of 85 million people, which, because of\r\nthe number of individuals and the compactness of habitation, form a\r\nhomogeneous European racial body which cannot be found in any other\r\ncountry. On the other hand, it justifies the demand for larger living\r\nspace more than for any other nation. If no political body exists\r\nin space, corresponding to the German racial body, then that is the\r\nconsequence of several centuries of historical development, and should\r\nthis political condition continue to exist, it will represent the\r\ngreatest danger to the preservation of the German nation [Volkstum] at\r\nits present high level. An arrest of the deterioration of the German\r\nelement in Austria and Czechoslovakia is just as little possible as\r\nthe preservation of the present state in Germany itself. Instead of\r\ngrowth, sterility will be introduced, and as a consequence, tensions of\r\na social nature will appear after a number of years, because political\r\nand philosophical ideas are of a permanent nature only as long as they\r\nare able to produce the basis for the realization of the actual claim\r\nof existence of a nation. The German future is therefore dependent\r\nexclusively on the solution of the need for living space. Such a\r\nsolution can be sought naturally only for a limited period, about 1-3\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBefore touching upon the question of solving the need for living space,\r\nit must be decided whether a solution of the German position with a\r\ngood future can be attained, either by way of an autarchy or by way of\r\nan increased share in universal commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nAutarchy: Execution will be possible only with strict\r\nNational-Socialist State policy, which is the basis; assuming this can\r\nbe achieved the results are as follows:\r\n\r\nA. In the sphere of raw materials, only limited, but NOT total autarchy\r\ncan be attained:\r\n\r\n1. Wherever coal can be used for the extraction of raw materials\r\nautarchy is feasible.\r\n\r\n2. In the case of ores the position is much more difficult.\r\nRequirements in iron and light metals can be covered by ourselves.\r\nCopper and tin, however, can NOT.\r\n\r\n3. Cellular materials can be covered by ourselves as long as sufficient\r\nwood supplies exist. A permanent solution is not possible.\r\n\r\n4. Edible fats--possible.\r\n\r\nB. In the case of foods, the question of an autarchy must be answered\r\nwith a definite \"NO\".\r\n\r\nThe general increase of living standards, compared with 30-40 years\r\nago, brought about a simultaneous increase of the demand for an\r\nincrease of personal consumption even among the producers, the farmers,\r\nthemselves. The proceeds from the production increase in agriculture\r\nhave been used for covering the increase in demands, therefore they\r\nrepresent no absolute increase in production. A further increase in\r\nproduction by making greater demands on the soil is _not_ possible\r\nbecause it already shows signs of deterioration due to the use of\r\nartificial fertilizers, and it is therefore certain that, even with the\r\ngreatest possible increase in production, participation in the world\r\nmarket could NOT be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe considerable expenditure of foreign currency to secure food\r\nby import, even in periods when harvests are good, increases\r\ncatastrophically when the harvest is really poor. The possibility\r\nof this catastrophe increases correspondingly to the increase in\r\npopulation, and the annual 560,000 excess in births would bring about\r\nan increased consumption in bread, because the child is a greater bread\r\neater than the adult.\r\n\r\nPermanently to counter the difficulties of food supplies by lowering\r\nthe standard of living and by rationalization is impossible in a\r\ncontinent which had developed an approximately equivalent standard of\r\nliving. As the solving of the unemployment problem has brought into\r\neffect the complete power of consumption, some small corrections in\r\nour agricultural home production will be possible, but NOT a wholesale\r\nalteration of the standard of food consumption. Consequently autarchy\r\nbecomes impossible, specifically in the sphere of food supplies as well\r\nas generally.\r\n\r\n_Participation in World Economy._ There are limits to this which we are\r\nunable to transgress. The market fluctuations would be an obstacle to\r\na secure foundation of the German position; international commercial\r\nagreements do NOT offer any guarantee for practical execution. It\r\nmust be considered on principle that since the World War (1914-18) an\r\nindustrialization has taken place in countries which formerly exported\r\nfood. We live in a period of economic empires, in which the tendency\r\nto colonize again approaches the condition which originally motivated\r\ncolonization; in Japan and Italy economic motives are the basis of\r\ntheir will to expand, the economic need will also drive Germany to it.\r\nCountries outside the great economic empires have special difficulties\r\nin expanding economically.\r\n\r\nThe upward tendency, which has been caused in world economy, due to\r\narmament competition, can never form a permanent basis for an economic\r\nsettlement, and this latter is also hampered by the economic disruption\r\ncaused by Bolshevism. It is a pronounced military weakness of those\r\nStates who base their existence on export. As our exports and imports\r\nare carried out over those sea lanes which are ruled by Britain, it is\r\nmore a question of security of transport rather than one of foreign\r\ncurrency, and this explains the great weakness in our food situation in\r\nwartime. The only way out, and one which may appear imaginary, is the\r\nsecuring of greater living space, an endeavor which at all times has\r\nbeen the cause of the formation of states and of movements of nations.\r\nIt is explicable that this tendency finds no interest in Geneva and\r\nin satisfied States. Should the security of our food position be our\r\nforemost thought, then the space required for this can only be sought\r\nin Europe, but we will not copy liberal capitalist policies which rely\r\non exploiting colonies. It is NOT a case of conquering people, but of\r\nconquering agriculturally useful space. It would also be more to the\r\npurpose to seek raw material producing territory in Europe directly\r\nadjoining the Reich and not overseas, and this solution would have\r\nto be brought into effect in one or two generations. What would be\r\nrequired at a later date over and above this must be left to subsequent\r\ngenerations. The development of great world-wide national bodies is\r\nnaturally a slow process and the German people, with its strong racial\r\nroot, has for this purpose the most favorable foundations in the heart\r\nof the European Continent. The history of all times--Roman Empire,\r\nBritish Empire--has proved that every space expansion can only be\r\neffected by breaking resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are\r\nunavoidable; neither formerly nor today has space been found without an\r\nowner; the attacker always comes up against the proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe question for Germany is where the greatest possible conquest could\r\nbe made at lowest cost.\r\n\r\nGerman politics must reckon with its two hateful enemies, England and\r\nFrance, to whom a strong German colossus in the center of Europe would\r\nbe intolerable. Both these states would oppose a further reinforcement\r\nof Germany, both in Europe and overseas, and in this opposition they\r\nwould have the support of all parties. Both countries would view the\r\nbuilding of German military strongpoints overseas as a threat to their\r\noverseas communications, as a security measure for German commerce, and\r\nretrospectively a strengthening of the German position in Europe.\r\n\r\nEngland is NOT in a position to cede any of her colonial possessions\r\nto us owing to the resistance which she experiences in the Dominions.\r\nAfter the loss of prestige which England has suffered owing to the\r\ntransfer of Abyssinia to Italian ownership, a return of East Africa can\r\nno longer be expected. Any resistance on England's part would at best\r\nconsist in the readiness to satisfy our colonial claims by taking away\r\ncolonies which at the present moment are NOT in British hands, e.g.\r\nAngola. French favors would probably be of the same nature.\r\n\r\nA serious discussion regarding the return of colonies to us could be\r\nconsidered only at a time when England is in a state of emergency and\r\nthe German Reich is strong and well-armed. The Fuehrer does not share\r\nthe opinion that the Empire is unshakable. Resistance against the\r\nEmpire is to be found less in conquered territories than amongst its\r\ncompetitors. The British Empire and the Roman Empire cannot be compared\r\nwith one another in regard to durability; since the Punic Wars the\r\nlatter did not have a serious political enemy. Only the dissolving\r\neffects which originated in Christendom, and the signs of age which\r\ncreep into all states, made it possible for the Ancient Germans to\r\nsubjugate Ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nAlongside the British Empire today a number of States exist which are\r\nstronger than it. The British Mother Country is able to defend its\r\ncolonial possessions only allied with other States and NOT by its own\r\npower. How could England alone, for example, defend Canada against an\r\nattack by America or its Far Eastern interests against an attack by\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nThe singling out of the British Crown as the bearer of Empire unity is\r\nin itself an admission that the universal empire cannot be maintained\r\npermanently by power politics. The following are significant pointers\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n_a._ Ireland's tendency for independence.\r\n\r\n_b._ Constitutional disputes in India where England, by her\r\nhalf-measures, left the door open for Indians at a later date to\r\nutilize the nonfulfillment of constitutional promises as a weapon\r\nagainst Britain.\r\n\r\n_c._ The weakening of the British position in the Far East by Japan.\r\n\r\n_d._ The opposition in the Mediterranean to Italy which--by virtue\r\nof its history, driven by necessity and led by a genius--expands its\r\npower position and must consequently infringe British interests to\r\nan increasing extent. The outcome of the Abyssinian War is a loss of\r\nprestige for Britain which Italy is endeavoring to increase by stirring\r\nup discontent in the Mohammedan world.\r\n\r\nIt must be established in conclusion that the Empire cannot be held\r\npermanently by power politics by 45 million Britons, in spite of all\r\nthe solidity of her ideals. The proportion of the populations in the\r\nEmpire, compared with that of the Motherland is 9:1, and it should act\r\nas a warning to us that if we expand in space, we must NOT allow the\r\nlevel of our population to become too low.\r\n\r\nFrance's position is more favorable than that of England. The French\r\nEmpire is better placed geographically, the population of its colonial\r\npossessions represents a potential military increase. But France is\r\nfaced with difficulties of internal politics. At the present time only\r\n10 per cent approximately of the nations have parliamentary governments\r\nwhereas 90 per cent of them have totalitarian governments. Nevertheless\r\nwe have to take the following into our political considerations as\r\npower factors:\r\n\r\n  Britain, France, Russia and the adjoining smaller States.\r\n\r\nThe German question can be solved only by way of force, and this is\r\nnever without risk. The battles of Frederick the Great for Silesia,\r\nand Bismarck's wars against Austria and France had been a tremendous\r\nrisk and the speed of Prussian action in 1870 had prevented Austria\r\nfrom participating in the war. If we place the decision to apply force\r\nwith risk at the head of the following expositions, then we are left\r\nto reply to the questions \"when\" and \"how\". In this regard we have to\r\ndecide upon three different cases.\r\n\r\n_Case 1. Period 1943-45._ After this we can only expect a change for\r\nthe worse. The re-arming of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force,\r\nas well as the formation of the Officers' Corps, are practically\r\nconcluded. Our material equipment and armaments are modern, with\r\nfurther delay the danger of their becoming out-of-date will increase.\r\nIn particular the secrecy of \"special weapons\" cannot always be\r\nsafeguarded. Enlistment of reserves would be limited to the current\r\nrecruiting age groups and an addition from older untrained groups would\r\nbe no longer available.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the re-armament, which will have been carried out\r\nat that time by the other nations, we shall decrease in relative\r\npower. Should we not act until 1943/45, then, dependent on the absence\r\nof reserves, any year could bring about the food crisis, for the\r\ncountering of which we do NOT possess the necessary foreign currency.\r\nThis must be considered as a \"point of weakness in the regime\". Over\r\nand above that, the world will anticipate our action and will increase\r\ncounter-measures yearly. Whilst other nations isolate themselves we\r\nshould be forced on the offensive.\r\n\r\nWhat the actual position would be in the years 1943-1945 no one knows\r\ntoday. It is certain, however, that we can wait no longer.\r\n\r\nOn the one side the large armed forces, with the necessity for securing\r\ntheir upkeep, the aging of the Nazi movement and of its leaders, and on\r\nthe other side the prospect of a lowering of the standard of living and\r\na drop in the birth rate, leaves us no other choice than to act. If the\r\nFuehrer is still living, then it will be his irrevocable decision to\r\nsolve the German space problem no later than 1943-45. The necessity for\r\naction before 1943-45 will come under consideration in cases 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n_Case 2._ Should the social tensions in France lead to an internal\r\npolitical crisis of such dimensions that it absorbs the French Army and\r\nthus renders it incapable for employment in war against Germany, then\r\nthe time for action against Czechoslovakia has come.\r\n\r\n_Case 3._ It would be equally possible to act against Czechoslovakia\r\nif France should be so tied up by a war against another State, that it\r\ncannot \"proceed\" against Germany.\r\n\r\nFor the improvement of our military political position it must be\r\nour first aim, in every case of entanglement by war, to conquer\r\nCzechoslovakia and Austria simultaneously, in order to remove any\r\nthreat from the flanks in case of a possible advance Westwards. In\r\nthe case of a conflict with France it would hardly be necessary to\r\nassume that Czechoslovakia would declare war on the same day as France.\r\nHowever, Czechoslovakia's desire to participate in the war will\r\nincrease proportionally to the degree to which we are being weakened.\r\nIts actual participation could make itself felt by an attack on\r\nSilesia, either towards the North or the West.\r\n\r\nOnce Czechoslovakia is conquered--and a mutual frontier,\r\nGermany-Hungary is obtained--then a neutral attitude by Poland in a\r\nGerman-French conflict could more easily be relied upon. Our agreements\r\nwith Poland remain valid only as long as Germany's strength remains\r\nunshakeable; should Germany have any setbacks then an attack by Poland\r\nagainst East Prussia, perhaps also against Pomerania, and Silesia, must\r\nbe taken into account.\r\n\r\nAssuming a development of the situation, which would lead to a planned\r\nattack on our part in the years 1943-45, then the behavior of France,\r\nPoland and Russia would probably have to be judged in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer believes personally that in all probability England and\r\nperhaps also France have already silently written off Czechoslovakia,\r\nand that they have got used to the idea that this question would one\r\nday be cleaned up by Germany. The difficulties in the British Empire\r\nand the prospect of being entangled in another long-drawn-out European\r\nWar, were decisive factors in the non-participation of England in a\r\nwar against Germany. The British attitude would certainly NOT remain\r\nwithout influence on France's attitude. An attack by France without\r\nBritish support is hardly probable assuming that its offensive would\r\nstagnate along our Western fortifications. Without England's support,\r\nit would also NOT be necessary to take into consideration a march by\r\nFrance through Belgium and Holland, and this would also not have to be\r\nreckoned with by us in case of a conflict with France, as in every case\r\nit would have as consequence the enmity of Great Britain. Naturally,\r\nwe should in every case have to bar our frontier during the operation\r\nof our attacks against Czechoslovakia and Austria. It must be taken\r\ninto consideration here that Czechoslovakia's defence measures will\r\nincrease in strength from year to year, and that a consolidation of the\r\ninside values of the Austrian army will also be effected in the course\r\nof years. Although the population of Czechoslovakia in the first place\r\nis not a thin one, the embodiment of Czechoslovakia and Austria would\r\nnevertheless constitute the conquest of food for 5-6 million people, on\r\nthe basis that a compulsory emigration of 2 million from Czechoslovakia\r\nand of 1 million from Austria could be carried out. The annexation of\r\nthe two States to Germany militarily and politically would constitute\r\na considerable relief, owing to shorter and better frontiers, the\r\nfreeing of fighting personnel for other purposes and the possibility\r\nof re-constituting new armies up to a strength of about 12 Divisions,\r\nrepresenting a new division per 1 million population.\r\n\r\nNo opposition to the removal of Czechoslovakia is expected on the part\r\nof Italy; however, it cannot be judged today what would be her attitude\r\nin the Austrian question since it would depend largely on whether the\r\nDuce were alive at the time or not.\r\n\r\nThe measure and speed of our action would decide Poland's attitude.\r\nPoland will have little inclination to enter the war against a\r\nvictorious Germany, with Russia in its rear.\r\n\r\nMilitary participation by Russia must be countered by the speed of\r\nour operations; it is a question whether this need be taken into\r\nconsideration at all in view of Japan's attitude.\r\n\r\nShould Case 2 occur--paralyzation of France by a Civil War--then the\r\nsituation should be utilized _at any time_ for operations against\r\nCzechoslovakia, as Germany's most dangerous enemy would be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer sees Case 3 looming nearer; it could develop from the\r\nexisting tensions in the Mediterranean, and should it occur he has\r\nfirmly decided to make use of it any time, perhaps even as early as\r\n1938.\r\n\r\nFollowing recent experiences in the course of the events of the war\r\nin Spain, the Fuehrer does NOT see an early end to hostilities there.\r\nTaking into consideration the time required for past offensives by\r\nFranco, a further three years duration of war is within the bounds of\r\npossibility. On the other hand, from the German point of view a 100\r\nper cent victory by Franco is not desirable; we are more interested\r\nin a continuation of the war and preservation of the tensions in the\r\nMediterranean. Should Franco be in sole possession of the Spanish\r\nPeninsula it would mean the end of Italian intervention and the\r\npresence of Italy on the Balearic Isles. As our interests are directed\r\ntowards continuing the war in Spain, it must be the task of our future\r\npolicy to strengthen Italy in her fight to hold on to the Balearic\r\nIsles. However, a solidification of Italian positions on the Balearic\r\nIsles can NOT be tolerated either by France or by England and could\r\nlead to a war by France and England against Italy, in which case Spain,\r\nif entirely in white (i.e. Franco's) hands, could participate on the\r\nside of Italy's enemies. A subjugation of Italy in such a war appears\r\nvery unlikely. Additional raw materials could be brought to Italy via\r\nGermany. The Fuehrer believes that Italy's military strategy would be\r\nto remain on the defensive against France on the Western frontier and\r\ncarry out operations against France from Libya against North African\r\nFrench colonial possessions.\r\n\r\nAs a landing of French-British troops on the Italian coast can be\r\ndiscounted, and as a French offensive via the Alps to Upper Italy\r\nwould be extremely difficult and would probably stagnate before the\r\nstrong Italian fortifications, French lines of communication by the\r\nItalian fleet will to a great extent paralyze the transport of fighting\r\npersonnel from North Africa to France, so that at its frontiers\r\nwith Italy and Germany France will have at its disposal solely the\r\nmetropolitan fighting forces.\r\n\r\nIf Germany profits from this war by disposing of the Czechoslovakian\r\nand the Austrian questions, the probability must be assumed that\r\nEngland--being at war with Italy--would not decide to commence\r\noperations against Germany. Without British support a warlike action by\r\nFrance against Germany is not to be anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe date of our attack on Czechoslovakia and Austria must be made\r\ndependent on the course of the Italian-English-French war and would\r\nnot be simultaneous with the commencement of military agreements\r\nwith Italy, but of full independence and, by exploiting this unique\r\nfavorable opportunity he wishes to begin to carry out operations\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia. The attack on Czechoslovakia would have to take\r\nplace with the \"speed of lightning\" [blitzartig schnell].\r\n\r\nFeldmarschall von Blomberg and Generaloberst von Fritsch in giving\r\ntheir estimate on the situation, repeatedly pointed out that England\r\nand France must not appear as our enemies, and they stated that the\r\nwar with Italy would NOT bind the French army to such an extent that\r\nit would NOT be in a position to commence operations on our Western\r\nfrontier with superior forces. Generaloberst von Fritsch estimated\r\nthe French forces which would presumably be employed on the Alpine\r\nfrontier against Italy to be in the region of 20 divisions, so that a\r\nstrong French superiority would still remain on our Western frontier.\r\nThe French would, according to German reasoning, attempt to advance\r\ninto the Rhineland. We should consider the lead which France has got\r\nin mobilization, and quite apart from the very small value of our\r\nthen existing fortifications--which was pointed out particularly by\r\nGeneralfeldmarschall von Blomberg--the four motorized divisions which\r\nhad been laid down for the West would be more or less incapable of\r\nmovement. With regard to our offensive in a South-Easterly direction,\r\nFeldmarschall von Blomberg draws special attention to the strength of\r\nthe Czechoslovakian fortifications, the building of which had assumed\r\nthe character of a Maginot line and which would present extreme\r\ndifficulties to our attack.\r\n\r\nGeneraloberst von Fritsch mentioned that it was the purpose of\r\na study which he had laid on for this winter to investigate the\r\npossibilities of carrying out operations against Czechoslovakia with\r\nspecial consideration of the conquest of the Czechoslovakian system\r\nof fortifications; the Generaloberst also stated that owing to the\r\nprevailing conditions he would have to relinquish his leave abroad,\r\nwhich was to begin on 10 November. This intention was countermanded by\r\nthe Fuehrer who gave as a reason that the possibility of the conflict\r\nwas not to be regarded as being so imminent. In reply to the remark\r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that an Italian-English-French\r\nconflict be not as near as the Fuehrer appeared to assume, the Fuehrer\r\nstated that the date which appeared to him to be a possibility was\r\nsummer 1938. In reply to statements by Generalfeldmarschall von\r\nBlomberg and Generaloberst von Fritsch regarding England and France's\r\nattitude, the Fuehrer repeated his previous statements and said that\r\nhe was convinced of Britain's non-participation and that consequently\r\nhe did not believe in military action by France against Germany.\r\nShould the Mediterranean conflict already mentioned lead to a general\r\nmobilization in Europe, then we should have to commence operations\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia immediately. If, however, the powers who are not\r\nparticipating in the war should declare their disinterestedness, then\r\nGermany would, for the time being, have to side with this attitude.\r\n\r\nIn view of the information given by the Fuehrer, Generaloberst Goering\r\nconsidered it imperative to think of a reduction or abandonment of our\r\nmilitary undertaking in Spain. The Fuehrer agreed to this in so far as\r\nhe believed this decision should be postponed for a suitable date.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the discussion concerned material armament questions.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) HOSSBACH\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 388-PS\r\n\r\nAPPERTAINING TO WAR HISTORY\r\n\r\n[pencil note]\r\n\r\nS.O.

Only\r\n  Berlin, 22 April 1938\r\n\r\nBASES OF THE DISSERTATION ON \"GRUEN\"\r\n\r\n Summary of discussion between Fuehrer and General Keitel of 21 April:\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _Political Aspect_\r\n\r\n1. Strategic surprise attack out of a clear sky without any cause or\r\npossibility of justification has been turned down. As result would be:\r\nhostile world opinion which can lead to a critical situation. Such a\r\nmeasure is justified only for the elimination of the _last_ opponent on\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\n2. Action after a time of diplomatic clashes, which gradually come to a\r\ncrisis and lead to war.\r\n\r\n3. Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (e.g.\r\nassassination of German ambassador in connection with an anti-German\r\ndemonstration).\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Military Conclusions_\r\n\r\n1. The preparations are to be made for the political possibilities\r\n2 and 3. Case 2 is the undesired one since \"Gruen\" will have taken\r\nsecurity measures.\r\n\r\n2. The loss of time caused by transporting the bulk of the divisions\r\nby rail--which is unavoidable but should be cut down as far as\r\npossible--must not impede a lightning-swift blow at the time of the\r\naction.\r\n\r\n3. \"Separate thrusts\" are to be carried out immediately with a view to\r\npenetrating the enemy fortification lines at numerous points and in a\r\nstrategically favorable direction. The thrusts are to be worked out to\r\nthe smallest detail (knowledge of roads, of targets, composition of the\r\ncolumns according to their individual tasks). Simultaneous attacks by\r\nthe Army and Air Force.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force is to support the individual columns, (e.g. dive-bombers:\r\nsealing off installations at penetration points, hampering the bringing\r\nup of reserves, destroying signal communications traffic, thereby\r\nisolating the garrisons.)\r\n\r\n4. Politically, the first 4 days of military action are the decisive\r\nones. If there are no effective military successes, a European crisis\r\nwill certainly arise. Accomplished facts must prove the senselessness\r\nof foreign military intervention, draw Allies into the scheme (division\r\nof spoils!) and demoralize \"Gruen\".\r\n\r\nTherefore: bridging the time gap between first penetration and\r\nemployment of the forces to be brought up, by a determined and ruthless\r\nthrust by a motorized army. (e.g. via Pi past Pr) [Pilsen, Prague],\r\n\r\n5. If possible, separation of transport movement \"Rot\" from \"Gruen\". A\r\nsimultaneous strategic concentration \"Rot\" can lead \"Rot\" to undesired\r\nmeasures. On the other hand it must be possible to put \"Fall Rot\" into\r\noperation at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Propaganda_\r\n\r\n1. Leaflets on the conduct of Germans in Czechoslovakia (Gruenland).\r\n\r\n2.

POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES\r\n\r\n1. Sudden surprise attack out of clear sky not possible. World opinion\r\ncan produce critical situation. Would be thinkable only for ultimate\r\nconflict without the threat of other opponents.\r\n\r\n2. Action after a period of tension and constant aggravation of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n3. Action as the result of an incident. (example)\r\n\r\n\r\nB. MILITARY NECESSITIES\r\n\r\nCases 2 and 3 can be considered. In case 2 \"security measures\" will be\r\ntaken. Duration of transporting by rail to be looked into.\r\n\r\n1. Invasion by columns ready to march at points which lie in a\r\ndirection, strategically important. (Permanent fortifications must\r\nbe known, columns assembled to suit particular situations, roads\r\nreconnoitred.) Simultaneous attack by Luftwaffe, cooperation with\r\nLuftwaffe, isolation of garrisons of the fortifications, cutting of\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\n2. \"Dead Space\" in first 4 days prior to actual operation must be\r\navoided under all circumstances. Must be bridged through motorized\r\narmy. Penetrating via Pilsen. Hamper mobilization.\r\n\r\n3. Separation of transport movement \"Rot\" and \"Gruen\",\r\n\r\n _a._ in order not to aggravate \"Rot\",\r\n\r\n _b._ but also so as not to arrive late, if necessary.\r\n\r\nBasic Principle: Create Accomplished Facts so that\r\n\r\n _a._ help comes too late--other powers do not intervene\r\n\r\n _b._ Allies take part (like wolves also want something out of it)\r\n\r\n _c._ State collapse from within.\r\n\r\nPropaganda: Directions to Germans.

Therefore inevitable political developments _within_\r\nCzechoslovakia must force the issue, or political events in Europe\r\ncreate an especially favorable opportunity and one which may never come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n2. _Political Possibilities for the Commencement of the Action:_\r\nAn invasion without suitable obvious cause and without sufficient\r\npolitical justification cannot be considered with reference to the\r\npossible consequences of such an action in the present situation.\r\n\r\nRather will the action be initiated either:\r\n\r\n_a._ after a period of increasing diplomatic clashes and tension, which\r\nis coupled with military preparations and is made use of to push the\r\nwar-guilt onto the enemy. Even such a period of tension preceding the\r\nwar however will terminate in sudden military action on our part, which\r\nmust come with all possible surprise as to time and extent, or\r\n\r\n_b._ by lightning-swift action as a result of a serious incident,\r\nthrough which Germany is provoked in an unbearable way and for which at\r\nleast part of the world opinion will grant the moral justification of\r\nmilitary action.\r\n\r\n\"_b_\" is militarily and politically the more favorable.\r\n\r\n3. _Conclusions for the Preparations of \"Fall Gruen\"_; which must take\r\ninto account the possibilities mentioned in 2 _a_ and 2 _b_.\r\n\r\n_a._ For _Armed War_ it is essential to create--already in the\r\nfirst 4 days--a military situation which plainly proves to hostile\r\nnations eager to intervene, the hopelessness of the Czechoslovakian\r\nmilitary situation, and gives the nations with territorial claims\r\non Czechoslovakia an incentive to immediate intervention against\r\nCzechoslovakia. In such a case the intervention of Poland and Hungary\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia can be expected, especially if France, due to\r\nItaly's clearly pro-German attitude fears, or at least hesitates, to\r\nunleash a European war by her intervention against Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that attempts by Russia to give military support\r\nto Czechoslovakia are to be expected. If concrete successes are not\r\nachieved as a result of the ground operations during the first few\r\ndays, a European crisis will certainly arise.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Propaganda War_ must, on one hand, intimidate Czechoslovakia\r\nby threats and reduce her power of resistance, on the other hand, give\r\ninstructions to the national minorities for supporting the Armed War\r\nand influence the neutrals into our way of thinking.\r\n\r\n_c._ The _Economic War_ has the task of employing all means at the\r\ndisposal of economy to hasten the final collapse of Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Economic and Propaganda war can precede the Armed\r\nwar.

Two front war with main effort in the South East\r\n  (strategic concentration \"Gruen\")\r\n\r\n1. _Political Prerequisites._ It is my unalterable decision to smash\r\nCzechoslovakia by military action in the near future. It is the job\r\nof the political leaders to await or bring about the politically and\r\nmilitarily suitable moment.\r\n\r\nAn inevitable development of conditions inside Czechoslovakia or\r\nother political events in Europe creating a surprisingly favorable\r\nopportunity and one which may never come again may cause me to take\r\nearly action.\r\n\r\nThe proper choice and determined and full utilization of a favorable\r\nmoment is the surest guarantee of success. Accordingly the preparations\r\nare to be made at once.\r\n\r\n2. _Political Possibilities for the Commencement of the Action._ The\r\nfollowing are necessary prerequisites for the intended invasion:\r\n\r\n_a._ suitable obvious cause and, with it\r\n\r\n_b._ sufficient political justification,\r\n\r\n_c._ action unexpected by the enemy, which will find him prepared to\r\nthe least possible degree.\r\n\r\nFrom a military as well as a political standpoint the most favorable\r\ncourse is a lightning-swift action as the result of an incident through\r\nwhich Germany is provoked in an unbearable way for which at least part\r\nof world opinion will grant the moral justification of military action.\r\n\r\nBut even a period of tension, more or less preceding a war, must\r\nterminate in sudden action on our part--which must have the elements of\r\nsurprise as regards time and extent--before the enemy is so advanced in\r\nmilitary preparedness that he cannot be surpassed.\r\n\r\n3. _Conclusions for the Preparation of \"Fall Gruen\"._\r\n\r\n_a._ For the _Armed War_ it is essential that the surprise element\r\nas the most important factor contributing to success be made full\r\nuse of by appropriate preparatory measures, already in peacetime and\r\nby an unexpectedly rapid course of the action. Thus it is essential\r\nto create a situation within the first four days which plainly\r\ndemonstrates, to hostile nations eager to intervene, the hopelessness\r\nof the Czechoslovakian military situation and which at the same\r\ntime will give nations with territorial claims on Czechoslovakia an\r\nincentive to intervene immediately against Czechoslovakia. In such a\r\ncase, intervention by Poland and Hungary against Czechoslovakia may be\r\nexpected, especially if France--due to the obvious pro-German attitude\r\nof Italy--fears, or at least hesitates, to unleash a European war\r\nby intervening against Germany. Attempts by Russia to give military\r\nsupport to Czechoslovakia mainly by the Air Force are to be expected.\r\nIf concrete successes are not achieved by the land operations within\r\nthe first few days, a European crisis will certainly result. This\r\nknowledge must give commanders of all ranks the impetus to decided and\r\nbold action.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _Propaganda War_ must on the one hand intimidate\r\nCzechoslovakia by threats and soften her power of resistance, on the\r\nother hand issue directions to national groups for support in the Armed\r\nWar and influence the neutrals into our way of thinking. I reserve\r\nfurther directions and determination of the date.\r\n\r\n4. _Tasks of the Armed Forces._ Armed Forces Preparations are to be\r\nmade on the following basis:\r\n\r\n_a._ The mass of all forces must be employed against Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\n_b._ For the West, a minimum of forces are to be provided as rear cover\r\nwhich may be required, the other frontiers in the East against Poland\r\nand Lithuania are merely to be protected, the Southern frontiers to be\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\n_c._ The sections of the army which can be rapidly employed must force\r\nthe frontier fortifications with speed and decision and must break into\r\nCzechoslovakia with the greatest daring in the certainty that the bulk\r\nof the mobile army will follow them with the utmost speed. Preparations\r\nfor this are to be made and timed in such a way that the sections\r\nof the army which can be rapidly employed cross the frontier at the\r\nappointed time at the _same time_ as the penetration by the Air Force\r\n*before the enemy can become aware of our mobilization.*\r\n\r\n* For this, a timetable between Army and Air Force is to be worked out\r\nin conjunction with the OKW and submitted to me for approval.*\r\n\r\n5. _Missions for the branches of the Armed Forces._\r\n\r\n_a._ _Army._ The basic principle of the surprise attack against\r\nCzechoslovakia must not be endangered by the inevitable time required\r\nfor transporting the bulk of the field forces by rail nor the\r\ninitiative of the Air Force be wasted. Therefore it is first of all\r\nessential to the army that as many assault columns as possible be\r\nemployed at the same time as the surprise attack by the Air Force.\r\nThese assault columns--the composition of each, according to their\r\ntasks at that time--must be formed with troops which can be employed\r\nrapidly owing to their proximity to the frontier or to motorization\r\nand to special measures of readiness. It must be the purpose of\r\nthese thrusts to break into the Czechoslovakian fortification lines\r\nat numerous points and in a strategically favorable direction, to\r\nachieve a breakthrough or to break them down from the rear. For\r\nthe success of this operation, cooperation with the Sudeten German\r\nfrontier population, with deserters from the Czechoslovakian army,\r\nwith parachutists or airborne troops and with units of the sabotage\r\nservice will be of importance. The bulk of the army has the task of\r\n* frustrating the Czechoslovakian plan of defense, of preventing\r\nthe Czechoslovakian army from escaping into Slovakia, of forcing\r\na battle,* of beating the Czechoslovakian army and of occupying\r\nBohemia and Moravia speedily. To this end a thrust into the heart of\r\nCzechoslovakia must be made with the strongest possible motorized and\r\narmored units using to the full the first successes of the Assault\r\ncolumns and the effects of the Air Force operations. The rear cover\r\nprovided for the _West_ must be limited in numbers and quality to\r\nthe extent which suits the present state of fortifications. Whether\r\nthe units assigned this will be transported to the Western frontier\r\nimmediately or held back for the time being will be decided in my\r\nspecial order. Preparations must however, be made to enable security\r\ndetachments to be brought up to the Western frontier even during the\r\nstrategic concentration \"Gruen\". Independent of this, a first security\r\ngarrison must be improvized from the engineers at present employed in\r\nconstructing fortifications and from formations of the Labor Corps.\r\nThe _remaining frontiers_, as well as East Prussia, are to be weakly\r\nprotected. But, always depending on the political situation, the\r\ntransfers by sea, of a part or even the bulk of the active forces of\r\nEast Prussia, into the Reich must be taken into account.\r\n\r\n[*--* Passages between asterisks represent additions to the version in\r\nItem 5]\r\n\r\n_b._ _Air Force._ While leaving a minimum of defensive forces in the\r\nWest, the Air Force is to be employed in bulk in a surprise attack\r\nagainst Czechoslovakia. The frontier is to be flown over at the same\r\ntime as it is crossed by the first section of the army. (see 5_a_)\r\nThe _most important task_ of the Air Force is the destruction of the\r\nCzechoslovakian Air Force and their supply bases within the shortest\r\npossible time, in order to eliminate the possibility of its employment\r\nas well as that of Russian and French air forces, should the occasion\r\narise, against the strategic concentration and penetration of the\r\nGerman army and against the German \"Lebensraum.\" Next to this the\r\ncrippling of enemy mobilization, of the direction of the government and\r\nArmed Forces, as well as the delaying of the strategic concentration of\r\nthe Czech Army by attacks on communication installations, mobilization\r\nand government centers can be of considerable importance to the initial\r\nsuccess of the army. At points in the frontier area where stronger\r\nsections of the Czechoslovakian Army *or the depth of the defensive\r\nsystem* might make the success of the sudden breakthrough of the German\r\nLand-attack questionable, the employment of adequate bomber forces must\r\nbe assured. Czechoslovakian industrial installations are to be spared\r\nas far as the course of operations permits. Retaliatory attacks against\r\nthe population will be carried out only with my permission. Centers\r\nof air defense are to be created throughout Berlin, the central German\r\nindustrial area and the Ruhr area *and gradually prepared even now in\r\nan inconspicuous fashion.*\r\n\r\n_c._ _Navy._ The Navy will assist the army operations by employing the\r\nDanube-flotilla. For this purpose the flotilla will be under the orders\r\nof C-in-C Army. As regards the conduct of naval warfare at first only\r\nthose measures are to be taken which appear to be necessary for the\r\ncareful protection of the North Sea and the Baltic against a sudden\r\nintervention in the conflict by other states. These measures must be\r\nconfined to the absolutely necessary extent. Their inconspicuousness\r\nmust be guaranteed. It is of decisive importance that all actions,\r\nwhich might influence the political attitude of the European Great\r\nPowers unfavorably, be avoided.\r\n\r\n6. _Tasks of the War Economy._ In the war economy it is essential\r\nthat in the field of the armament industry a maximum deployment of\r\nforces is made possible through increased supplies. In the course of\r\noperations, it is of value to contribute to the reinforcement of the\r\ntotal war--economic strength--by rapidly reconnoitring and restarting\r\nimportant factories. For this reason the sparing of Czechoslovakian\r\nindustrial and works installations--insofar as military operations\r\npermit--can be of decisive importance to us.\r\n\r\n7. *All preparations for sabotage and insurrection will be made by OKW.\r\nThey will be made, in agreement with and according to the requirement\r\nof the branches of the Armed Forces, so that their effects accord with\r\nthe operations of the Army and Air Force.*\r\n\r\n  signed ADOLF HITLER\r\n  Certified copy\r\n  signed Zeitzler\r\n  Oberstleutnant on the General Staff\r\n\r\n[*--* Passages between asterisks represent additions to the version in\r\nItem 5]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [ITEM 12] [_Typescript_]      Berlin, 9 June 1938\r\n  L I a H\r\n\r\nSHORT SURVEY OF ARMAMENT OF THE CZECH ARMY\r\n\r\n1. _SMALL ARMS_\r\n\r\n Armed uniformly with Mauser Rifle, Model 24, calibre 7.92 mm (similar\r\n to German Rifle 98).

There is no danger of a preventive war by foreign states against\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nGermany has not committed herself to any military alliances which would\r\nautomatically force Germany into a warlike conflict of foreign powers.\r\n\r\nThe immediate aim is a solution of the Czech problem by my own, free\r\ndecision; this stands in the foreground of my political intentions. I\r\nam determined to use to the full every favorable political opportunity\r\nto realize this aim.\r\n\r\nThereby, friends, interested parties and enemies can be called upon to\r\ntake part in this scheme and other powers can remain indifferent even\r\nthough they could not be previously placed with absolute certainty in\r\none of these categories.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will decide to take action against Czechoslovakia only\r\nif I am firmly convinced as in the case of the occupation of the\r\ndemilitarized zone and the entry into Austria that France will not\r\nmarch and therefore England will not intervene.\r\n\r\n2. The preparations of the Armed Forces must cover:\r\n\r\n _a._ thorough preparation of the action against Czechoslovakia (\"Fall\r\n Gruen\"). See Part 2.\r\n\r\n _b._ Maintenance of the previous \"Fall Rot\" (strategic concentration\r\n with the main effort against the West.) See Part 2.\r\n\r\n _c._ Special preparations, mainly in the form of studies and\r\n deliberations within the Supreme Commands. See Part 3.\r\n\r\n _d._ Preparatory measures, in case German territory is suddenly and\r\n abruptly violated with hostile intent by a foreign power. See number 3.\r\n\r\n3. If in the midst of peace, German territory is suddenly and abruptly\r\nviolated with hostile intent by a foreign power, armed resistance will\r\nbe offered _without any special order_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the branches of the Armed Forces must empower their\r\ncompetent Commanders on the frontier or on the coast to take on their\r\nown authority, all measures necessary to repulse the enemy attack\r\nshould such a case occur. (See Reich Defense Law (RVG) para. 2).\r\n\r\nIn no event, however, may the German Reich frontier be crossed by\r\ntroops or aircraft, nor any foreign territory violated, without my\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIt will not be considered a violation of German territory (see 1st\r\nsentence of this number) if single sentries or patrols cross the\r\nfrontier unintentionally and accidentally or through the over-eagerness\r\nof a subordinate commander, or if aircraft fly over the frontier due to\r\nfaulty navigation, or warships sail in our German territorial waters\r\nwith obviously no hostile intentions.\r\n\r\n4. This directive concerns the uniform _preparation_ for war and the\r\ngeneral strategic considerations applying to the _outbreak_ of the\r\nwar.

Regulations dealing with special\r\nmatters, Administration and War Economy relative to \"Fall Gruen\" are\r\nstill to be issued.\r\n\r\n2. _Two Front War with the main effort in the West_ (\"_Fall Rot_\")\r\n\r\nSince even a war against us started by the Western Nations _must_,\r\nin view of the situation today, begin with the destruction of\r\nCzecho-Slovakia, the preparation of strategic concentration for a war\r\nwith the main effort by the Army and Air Force against the West, is no\r\nlonger of primary importance.\r\n\r\nThe preparations made to date for the event (\"Rot\"), however, remain\r\nin effect. They contribute, as far as the Army is concerned, towards\r\ncamouflaging and screening the other strategic concentration and\r\nserve, in the case of the Luftwaffe, as a preparation for the shifting\r\nof the main effort from the East to the West, which may, under\r\ncertain circumstances, suddenly become necessary. They also serve as\r\npreliminary work for future possibilities of war in the West.\r\n\r\nIt is left to C in C Army to decide how far the Army strategic\r\nconcentration \"Rot\", prepared by OKH for the beginning of the new\r\nmobilization year 38/39, will be issued to subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe tasks which arise for the _Navy_ in \"Fall Rot\" will be the same as\r\nthose should \"Fall Gruen\" be extended to include the Western European\r\nnations. The naval preparations are therefore to be continued with the\r\nprevious objective.\r\n\r\n  J\r\n  K [Initialled by Keitel and Jodl]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Written by an officer_\r\n\r\n  _2.

Only\r\n\r\n  Access only through officer\r\n\r\n  _Part 3_\r\n\r\n  _CONSIDERATIONS_\r\n\r\nI. _In connection with \"Gruen\"._\r\n\r\nHow the political situation will develop during the execution or after\r\nthe conclusion of \"Gruen\" cannot be predicted. Therefore the Armed\r\nForces will confine themselves to the preparation of the measures given\r\nin Part I, Number 3, to \"Fall Gruen\" and \"Fall Rot\". However, it seems\r\nexpedient to make at least theoretical considerations and calculations\r\nfor several possible eventualities, to avoid being mentally unprepared.\r\nThese considerations would have to cover:\r\n\r\n_a._ What would have to be done if other nations intervened against us\r\nduring the execution of \"Gruen\"--contrary to our expectations.\r\n\r\n_b._ What should be done after the conclusion of \"Gruen\".\r\n\r\nTo _a_. If, during the execution of \"Gruen\", France intervenes against\r\nus, the measures provided in \"Fall Gruen\" come into force. The primary\r\nessential in this connection is to hold the Western fortifications,\r\nuntil the execution of the action \"Gruen\" permits forces to be freed.\r\nShould France be supported by England, in this it will have small\r\neffect at first on the land-war. It is the duty of the Air Force,\r\nthe Navy, and the OKW (War Economy Staff, Defense, Armed Forces\r\nCommunications), however, to carry out far-sighted deliberations in\r\ntheir sphere.\r\n\r\nAmong the Eastern powers, Russia is the most likely to intervene. This,\r\nin the beginning at any rate, will probably consist of reinforcement\r\nof the Czech Air Force and Armament. However, the decision must not be\r\nneglected concerning what measures are to be taken if Russia were to\r\ncome to the point of starting a Naval and Air war against us or even\r\nwish to penetrate into East Prussia, through the border states.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a penetration by Poland, we must hold the Eastern\r\nfortifications and East Prussia, using the Frontier Guard and other\r\nformations, until the conclusion of the action \"Gruen\" once more gives\r\nus freedom of movement.\r\n\r\nTo _b_. If the action \"Gruen\" takes place still during this\r\nMobilization year, we must be in the position after the conclusion of\r\n\"Gruen\" to put a provisional strategic concentration quickly into force.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the latter, further to what was said in part\r\n1, number 3, it is of primary importance to safeguard the German\r\nfrontiers, including the new addition by the Armed Forces, and still\r\nhave the bulk of the Field Forces and the Air Force at our disposal. It\r\nwould have to be possible to put such a future strategic concentration,\r\n\"Frontier Protection,\" into force separately for the various frontiers.\r\n\r\nII. _Independent of \"Fall Gruen\"_\r\n\r\nGermany will not refrain from occupying the Memel-territory by a\r\nlightning blow in the case of a Polish-Lithuanian conflict occurring.\r\nThe deliberations on this eventuality must cancel the directive issued\r\n18 March 1938 (OKW Nr 472/38 g.

Only\r\n  Access only through Officer\r\n\r\n  1 Copy\r\n\r\nTIMING OF THE X-ORDER AND THE QUESTION OF ADVANCE MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe _Luftwaffe's_ endeavor to take the enemy air forces by surprise at\r\ntheir peace-time airports justifiably leads them to oppose measures\r\ntaken in advance of the X-order and to the demand that the X-order\r\nitself be given sufficiently late on X minus 1 to prevent the fact of\r\nGermany's mobilization becoming known to Czechoslovakia on that day.\r\n\r\nThe _Army's_ efforts are tending in the opposite direction. It intends\r\nto let OKW initiate all advance measures between X minus 3 and X\r\nminus 1 which will contribute to the smooth and rapid working of the\r\nmobilization. With this in mind _OKH also demands_ that the X order be\r\ngiven _not later than 1400 on X minus 1_.\r\n\r\nTo this the following must be said:\r\n\r\nOperation (Aktion) Gruen will be set in motion by means of an\r\n\"incident\" in Czechoslovakia which will give Germany provocation for\r\nmilitary intervention. The fixing of the _exact time_ for this incident\r\nis of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nIt must come at a time when weather conditions are favorable for our\r\nsuperior air forces to go into action and at an hour which will enable\r\nauthentic news of it to reach us on the afternoon of X minus 1.\r\n\r\nIt can then be spontaneously answered by the giving of the X order at\r\n1400 on X minus 1.\r\n\r\nOn X minus 2 the Navy, Army and Air Force will merely receive an\r\nadvance warning.\r\n\r\nIf the _Fuehrer_ intends to follow this plan of action, all further\r\ndiscussion is superfluous.\r\n\r\nFor then no advance measures may be taken before X minus 1 for which\r\nthere is not an innocent explanation as we shall otherwise appear to\r\nhave manufactured the incident. Orders for absolutely essential advance\r\nmeasures must be given in good time and camouflaged with the help of\r\nthe numerous manoeuvres and exercises.\r\n\r\nAlso, the question raised by the Foreign Office as to whether\r\nall Germans should be called back in time from prospective enemy\r\nterritories must in no way lead to the conspicuous departure from\r\nCzechoslovakia of any German subjects before the incident.\r\n\r\nEven a warning of the diplomatic representatives in Prague is\r\nimpossible before the first air attack, although the consequences could\r\nbe very grave in the event of their becoming victims of such an attack\r\n(e.g. death of representatives of friendly or confirmed neutral powers).\r\n\r\nIf, for technical reasons, the _evening hours_ should be considered\r\ndesirable for the incident, then the following day cannot be X day, but\r\nit must be the day after that.\r\n\r\nIn any case we must act on the principle that nothing must be done\r\nbefore the incident which might point to mobilization, and that the\r\nswiftest possible action must be taken after the incident. (X-Fall).\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of these notes to point out what a great interest\r\nthe Wehrmacht has in the incident and that it must be informed of the\r\nFuehrer's intentions in good time--insofar as the Abwehr Section is not\r\nalso charged with the organization of the incident.\r\n\r\nI request that the Fuehrer's decision be obtained on these points.\r\n\r\n  J 26/8\r\n  [Initialled by Jodl]\r\n\r\n  Notes: [in Schmundt's handwriting]\r\n  Submitted on 30.8\r\n  The Fuehrer will act on these lines.\r\n  On 31.8 Col. v.

From\r\n here will then be ready for action. When X Day becomes known, field\r\n units carry out exercises in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n_Fuehrer_\r\n\r\n Has objection.

Carry\r\n out camouflage exercises everywhere.\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n OKH must know when X-day is by 1200 noon, 27 September.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_The Fuehrer_\r\n\r\n Expresses different opinion on employment of troops for \"Gruen\".\r\n Aspects for the 2nd Army (OS) are smallest. Strongest Cz.\r\n fortifications there. Waste of troops; thrust in the 10th Army area,\r\n however, is promising. Roadblocks prepared everywhere in addition\r\n also in 2nd Army area. No reason for hindrance. The Czechs will stop\r\n opposite 2nd army and keep assault army ready east of Prague. A thrust\r\n against it into the heart of Cz. is to be made. Thrust in the 14th\r\n army area will fail because of means of transport. Therefore assemble\r\n all mot. and arm'd divisions with 10th army and employ in the thrust.\r\n Once we are through there, the South front, which is built up opposite\r\n our 12th army in 3 defense lines, will collapse. An army in the heart\r\n of Bohemia will bring about the decision. Possible repetition of\r\n Verdun in case of 2nd army. An attack there would mean bleeding to\r\n death for a task which cannot be accomplished.\r\n\r\n_v. Brauchitsch_\r\n\r\n Has objections because of the state of the mot. divisions, supply and\r\n untrained leaders.\r\n\r\n_The Fuehrer_:\r\n\r\n The course now planned corresponds to Cz. expectations.\r\n\r\nOpposite the 10th Army the enemy is not always in concrete\r\nemplacements. Possibility here of drawing in the Henlein people\r\n(uniforms). The line here is very far back. Cooperation between 10th\r\nand 12th armies. We must add motorized units to army. As formerly\r\nthe \"Prussian Cavalry.\" How else can we gather experiences? Decisive\r\nis the coordination of equal speeds. Breakthrough in sector of 2nd\r\narmy not so rapid, so that a tactical success can be turned into a\r\nstrategic one. _The Fuehrer_ gives orders for the development of the\r\nwestern fortifications; improvement of advance positions around Aachen\r\nand Saarbrucken.

Mission:\r\nto prevent retreat of Cz. Army from Moravia-Bohemia area. To beat army.\r\nTo bring about rapid decision. Mission can be accomplished by pincer\r\nattack in the direction of Olmutz and Brunn to be undertaken by 2nd\r\nand 14th Armies. Difficult transport situation in Austria. Therefore\r\nmain effort in 2nd Army area. Cz. frontier can only be lightly held.\r\nWithdrawal certain on part of Cz. forces. Several defensive lines\r\nfavorable but terrain will delay second thrusts and allow time to be\r\ngained for a Cz. retreat, and so retain a rear position. This is to be\r\navoided. The Bohemian Moravian heights which will confront the attacker\r\nin the last phase will favor probable Cz. line of action. The pincer\r\nattack makes a \"rear attack\" from behind these heights possible. This\r\noperation will definitely succeed. Reserves at first mainly local.\r\nFurther reserves near and south of Prague. Opponent won't have time\r\nto form further reserves. Opponent does not possess closed armoured\r\nforces. They are distributed and consist of light units.\r\n\r\n_2nd Army._ Weaknesses opposite its sector recognized. Installations\r\nonly partly completed. Mostly lack armd cupolas. There are great gaps.\r\nOlmutz will be reached on the second day. Oppa is no obstacle, can be\r\ncrossed by tanks as well as Inf. No armd forces opposing. Freudenthal\r\nonly 35 men garrison. So-called light motorized forces on right flank\r\nare no danger. Consist partly of mounted units and will be engaged by\r\nadjoining Army. Were the attack, against expectations, to fail, then\r\nunder no circumstances \"bleed to death\" before the position. Strategic\r\nconcentration to be flexible. Rear sections will then be brought up to\r\nthe points where success has been achieved. Cz fears the Glaz mountain\r\narea. Only demonstrations to be staged in this area; there will be a\r\ntie up of Cz forces. To provide cover eastwards tanks will be valuable.\r\n\r\nOn the rest of the mountain front: 4th (9?) Corps, and in the frontier\r\nsector demonstrations must be staged to tie up forces.\r\n\r\n_12th and 14th Armies_ will work together. Their columns must\r\nnecessarily support one another during the thrust and cause the front\r\nto collapse. Bohemia only weakly occupied at frontier: 1 Division to\r\n120 kms. Operation therefore promising. After the thrust in a northerly\r\ndirection 12 Army forces east and \"races\" for Brunn. The enemy will not\r\nbe able to employ reserves according to plan.\r\n\r\n_10th Army faces_ Pilsen Riegel which is strongly fortified. Bad roads.\r\nTanks must break through here and establish bridge-heads for following\r\nup forces. Forces of the next wave will be brought up by truck units.\r\nAfter the 3rd and 4th Mobilization day 6 further divisions will be\r\nbrought up to the 2nd and 3rd line and can be employed where success is\r\nin the balance.\r\n\r\n_The Fuehrer_: We should not plan the action on the operations as\r\nwe desire them, but take into consideration the probable course of\r\naction pursued by the enemy. With regard to his course of action two\r\nfactors are decisive: 1. At the time of our rearmament between 1934\r\nand 1938 our opponent must have endeavoured to secure himself against\r\na tearing of the East-West Communication, in his case probably between\r\nTrappau and Nikolsburg. Against us this would imply the building\r\nof fortifications on the Upper Silesian frontier. In the South an\r\nagreement with Austria would achieve a defense north of the Danube, or\r\nan advance to the Danube to protect the Southern flank.\r\n\r\n2. The latter is no longer possible. Therefore, as a result of the\r\nsituation created in March 1938, it is all the more probable that\r\nthey have increased their fortifications opposite our 2nd army. The\r\nenemy must hold there--otherwise there is no sense in holding the\r\nremaining front. Hence here the best regiments and fortifications are\r\nto be expected. Holding of the front facing the 2nd Army will decide\r\nthe \"To be or Not to be\" of Cz. There is no doubt that the planned\r\npincer movement is the most desirable solution and should take place.\r\nBut its success is nevertheless too uncertain for it to be depended\r\non. Especially as a rapid success is necessary from a political point\r\nof view. The first 8 days are politically decisive; within that week\r\na far-reaching territorial gain must be achieved. Our artillery\r\n(210cm Howitzers) not adequate against fortifications. Where an\r\nattack is expected the element of surprise is ruled out. Besides from\r\nexperience it is difficult to refrain from an action that achieves\r\nonly part-success. More and more units are thrown into breaks, and\r\nbleeding-to-death which one wanted to avoid sets in (Verdun!!). Tanks\r\nare used up and are not available for the subsequent territory-gaining\r\noperation. The consequence is that motorized divisions have to advance\r\nwithout tanks. (\"Tables Turned\")\r\n\r\nAlso the objectives of the motorized units are not too far-removed and\r\ncan be gained without fighting, so that they could be equally well\r\ngained by infantry troops. The motorized divisions will not be able to\r\ninfluence a decision to any extent. It is the task of motorized forces\r\nto bridge areas free of the enemy. Where an attack opens up a large\r\nfree space, the commitment of motorized forces is justified. Compare\r\nwith the use of army cavalry at the beginning of the 1914 war. It is\r\ncatastrophic for tanks to have to stop and wait for infantry. This\r\ncontradicts all laws of logic. In the 14th army sector fortifications\r\ncan only have been begun since March. Hence, thrust toward Brunn will\r\nbe easier. 2nd Pz Div can therefore be left there. However, this\r\ndivision should operate with the 29th motorized division. _Therefore\r\nthe 29th must not arrive on the evening of the 2nd day._ The 2nd Pz\r\nmust constitute the advance column of the 29th Div (Mot.). Are the\r\nroad conditions suitable for the 29th? The 13th Division, which has no\r\nprospects of success as a Mot. division with the 12th Army, is to be\r\ntransferred to the Reichenau Army together with 2nd Motorized Div. Thus\r\n2 chances for victory will be created.\r\n\r\nIf pincer movement has no success, 10th Army will open way for 12th\r\nArmy, bringing strong forces into the heart of the country. If both\r\noperations are successful, this means the end of Cz. In place of the\r\ntwo motorized divisions it is preferable to mobilize two further\r\ndivisions which are to be brought up in trucks and buses. For the 10th\r\nArmy the turn Northeast toward Prague may become necessary.\r\n\r\n_General Oberst v. Brauchitsch_: Employment of motorized divisions was\r\nbased on the difficult rail situation in Austria and the difficulties\r\nin getting other divs. (ready to march) into the area at the right\r\ntime. In the West vehicles will have to leave on the 20th of Sept.,\r\nif X-Day remains as planned. Workers leave on the 23rd, by relays.\r\nSpecialist workers remain according to decision by Army Command 2.\r\n\r\n_The Fuehrer_: Doesn't see why workers have to return home as early as\r\nX-11. Other workers and people are also on the way on mobilization day.\r\nAlso the RR cars, they will stand around unnecessarily later on.\r\n\r\n_General Keitel_: Workers are not under the jurisdiction of district\r\ncommands (Bezirks Kdos.) in the West. Trains must be assembled.\r\n\r\n_v. Brauchitsch_: 235,000 men RAD [Labour Service] will be drafted. 96\r\nConstruction Bns will be distributed (also in the east). 40,000 trained\r\nlaborers stay in the West.\r\n\r\n_Fuehrer_: Trained men should be distributed among newly formed\r\ndivisions on 2nd line.\r\n\r\n_Brauchitsch_: Will be investigated. Implies change of mobilization\r\norders if war orders already in the hands of the people.\r\n\r\n_General Construction Inspector Dr. Todt (late brought into the\r\nconference)_: Delays in unloading of material through slow changeover\r\nin timetable of RRs only from 15 September.

Schm\r\n\r\n  26 September 1938\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE SUDETEN-GERMAN FREE CORPS\r\n\r\nHerr Benesch has dissolved the Sudeten-German Party and believes that\r\nhe will thus be able to destroy the unity of the Sudeten-German radical\r\ngroup and to deal the death blow to the Sudeten-Germans. Konrad Henlein\r\nknew the answer to this. He issued a call on 17.9.38 for the formation\r\nof a Sudeten-German Free Corps. Within a few hours, thousands of\r\nSudeten-Germans had already rallied to the colors all along the border.\r\nThousands who were burning to fight for their tortured homeland were\r\nforced, to their great disappointment, to remain at their places of\r\nwork, because it was impossible, in such a short period of time, to\r\ninduct, equip and arm the masses of enthusiastic volunteers. For even\r\nin the first few hours after the appeal (probably the first instance in\r\nthe history of the Free Corps) shock troops of the Free Corps began, in\r\nextremely daring operations, to secure the escape of their countrymen\r\nwho had been hounded out of their homeland by their torturers.\r\n\r\nSince 19 Sept.--in more than 300 missions--the Free Corps has executed\r\nits task with an amazing spirit of _attack_ (defense)* and with a\r\nwillingness often reaching a degree of unqualified self-sacrifice. The\r\nresult of the first phase of its activities: more than 1500 prisoners,\r\n25 MG's and a large amount of other weapons and equipment, aside from\r\nserious losses in dead and wounded suffered by the _enemy_ (The Czech\r\nTerrorists).*\r\n\r\nThousands of members of the Sudeten-German Free Corps stand shoulder\r\nto shoulder on the frontiers of Germany. They are inspired by but one\r\ndesire: The freedom of the homeland within Adolf Hitler's Greater\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n  For Konrad Henlein\r\n  The Chief of Staff\r\n\r\n [*The superimposed corrections represent actual ink corrections on the\r\n original manuscript.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ITEM 31]    [_Typescript_]\r\n\r\n  Adj to the Fuehrer\r\n  [Note in pencil]\r\n  28/7\r\n  Schm.\r\n  Supreme Command of the Armed Forces      Berlin 27.9.1938\r\n\r\n  MOST SECRET           1920 hours.\r\n  WFA/L No. 2305/38 Most Secret II          45 copies, 16th copy\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has approved the mobilization without warning of the five\r\nregular west divisions (26th, 34th, 36th, 32, and 35th).

The SA in Wehrkreis XI refused to give up equipment requisitioned\r\n by the Armed Forces in accordance with mobilization regulations,\r\n because mobilization has not yet taken place.\r\n\r\n 2.

All the units operating on the frontier are\r\nsubordinate to them.\r\n\r\nNo new units of police, customs or party may be shifted into the\r\nimmediate frontier area without the knowledge of the army headquarters\r\nconcerned, nor may units already in the area be reinforced without\r\nsuch knowledge. In addition no one may cross the frontier without the\r\nknowledge of the army headquarters.\r\n\r\nFor the Henlein Free Corps and units subordinate to this the principle\r\nremains valid, that they receive instructions direct from the Fuehrer\r\nand that they carry out their operations only in conjunction with the\r\ncompetent general staff corps. The advance units of the Free Corps will\r\nhave to report to the local commander of the frontier guard immediately\r\nbefore crossing the frontier.\r\n\r\nThose units remaining forward of the frontier should--in their own\r\ninterests--get into communication with the frontier guard as often as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the army crosses the Cz border the Henlein Free Corps will\r\nbe subordinate to the OKH. Thus it will be expedient to assign a sector\r\nto the Free Corps even now which can be fitted into the scheme of army\r\nboundaries later.\r\n\r\nThe frontier guard has orders only to protect the German frontier, and\r\nnot to take part in operations on the other side of the border.

Order for the rescinding\r\nof measures taken is held over.\r\n\r\nThe entry is to be planned in such a way that it can easily be\r\nconverted into operation \"Gruen\".\r\n\r\nThe depth of the territories to be occupied daily depends on the\r\ndetails of the evacuation, which are being settled by the international\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n _a.

No. 267138\r\n  Dispatched--\r\n  Clerk\r\n\r\n1. By order of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, the\r\noccupation of the Sudeten-German areas by the Armed Forces will\r\nbe executed in a manner which will allow a changeover to military\r\noperations at any time.\r\n\r\nFor the advance of the troops to coincide with the withdrawal of the\r\nCzechs, particularly in the fortified zones, and on account of the\r\npossibility of local resistance, it is necessary for the march in to be\r\narranged in a way suited to the conduct of military operations.\r\n\r\n2. The military occupation also necessitates the settling of economic\r\nconditions in the Sudeten-German area. Assimilation can only be brought\r\nabout gradually. For this transition period the rate of exchange has\r\nbeen fixed at 100 Czech crowns to 10.00 Reichmarks so as to enable\r\nthe retail trade to function. It is a pre-condition of this temporary\r\nsettlement, however, that, until a final settlement is made with\r\nregard to economics and currency, and in order to avoid placing the\r\nSudeten-German population at a disadvantage, only those things are\r\nbought in the open market which come in the category of goods which\r\nfill the immediate needs of life. _Any exploitation of the present\r\neconomic situation is a serious offense._\r\n\r\n3. For the above stated reasons, travel into the Sudetenland from\r\nthe old Reich will be confined to those officials and authorities\r\nwho have been given specific tasks in the Sudeten-German area. It is\r\nrequested that all civil authorities and all organizations of the\r\nParty be instructed without delay that it is essential to obtain the\r\nprevious approval of the military authorities charged with the exercise\r\nof executive power (C-in-C of the Army, Army HQ) for the transfer of\r\ndepartments and units of any kind into the Sudeten-German area which is\r\nunder military authorities.\r\n\r\n  The Chief of the Supreme Command\r\n  of the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n  Keitel\r\n\r\n  [Distribution for Item 42 identical to that of Item 41]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n [ITEM 43 is seven pages of handwritten notes too illegible to\r\n translate.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  [ITEM 44]    [_Typescript_]\r\n\r\n  MOST SECRET\r\n\r\n  Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  No. 2400/38 Most Secret LIa\r\n  Top Secret\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 1st October 1938\r\n  150 copies, 18th copy\r\n  [Stamp]\r\n\r\n  Office of the Armed Forces Adjutant attached to the\r\n  Fuehrer & Reich Chancellor.\r\n\r\n  Rec.

A. Gruen)\r\n\r\n COORDINATED TIME OF ATTACK BY ARMY AND AIR FORCES ON X DAY\r\n\r\nAs a matter of principle, every effort should be made for a coordinated\r\nattack by Army and Air Forces on X Day.\r\n\r\nThe Army wishes to attack at dawn, i.e., about 0615; it also wishes to\r\nconduct some limited operations in the previous night, which, however,\r\nwould not alarm the entire Czech front.\r\n\r\nAir Force's time of attack depends on weather conditions. These could\r\nchange the time of attack and also limit the area of operations. The\r\nweather of the last few days, for instance, would have delayed the\r\nstart until between 0800 and 1100 due to low ceiling in Bavaria.\r\n\r\nIf the Luftwaffe were to attack at the time desired by the Army no\r\ntactical surprise of the enemy's air force would be achieved and it\r\nwould necessitate certain changes in the method of attack (height of\r\nflight level). Consequently, from the outset the Luftwaffe has desired\r\na later hour of attack on the part of the Army. Even so, there would\r\nbe no definite guarantee of a well-timed coordinated attack of both\r\nForces, as bad weather conditions on the day of attack might postpone\r\nthe commitment of the Air Force on X Day in part or altogether.\r\n\r\nIf an early hour of attack on the part of the Army is regarded as\r\nindispensable, a simultaneous attack by the Air Force,--desirable as it\r\nmay be,--may possibly have to be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n _Thus it is Proposed_:\r\n\r\nAttack by the Army--independent of the attack by the air force--at the\r\ntime desired by the Army (0615) and permission for limited operations\r\nto take place before them, however, only to an extent that will not\r\nalarm the entire Czech front.\r\n\r\nThe Luftwaffe will attack at a time most suitable to them.\r\n\r\n  J.\r\n  [Initialled by Jodl.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 392-PS\r\n\r\n The Social Life of New Germany with Special Consideration of the\r\n German Labor Front [Das Sociale Leben in neuen Deutschland unter\r\n besonderer Beruecksichtigung der Deutschen Arbeitsfront] (Berlin,\r\n 1938) by Prof. Willy Mueller.

Anything beyond that which is dependent\r\nupon the free trade unions is left to the discretion of the Gauleiter's\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe Gauleiters are responsible for the execution of the coordination\r\naction in the individual areas. Supporters of the action should be\r\nmembers of the National Socialist Factory Cell Organizations [NSBO or\r\nNational-Sozialistische Betriebszellen-Organisation].\r\n\r\nSA as well as SS are to be employed for the occupation of trade union\r\nproperties and for taking into protective custody personalities\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe Gauleiter is to proceed with his measures on a basis of the\r\nclosest understanding with competent regional factory cells directors\r\n[Gaubetriebszellenleiter].\r\n\r\nThe action in Berlin will be conducted by the Action Committee itself.\r\n\r\nIn the Reich the following will be occupied:\r\n\r\n The directing offices of the unions;\r\n\r\n The trade union houses and offices of the free trade unions, The Party\r\n houses of the Socialist Democratic Party of Germany insofar as trade\r\n unions are involved there;\r\n\r\n The branches and pay offices of the Bank for Workers, Employees and\r\n officials, Inc.\r\n\r\n The district committees of the General German Trade Union Federation\r\n and of the General Independent Employees Federation.\r\n\r\n The local committees of the General German Trade Union Federation and\r\n of the General Independent Employees Federation.\r\n\r\nThe following are to be taken into protective custody:\r\n\r\n All trade union chairmen [Verbandsvorsitzende];\r\n\r\n The district Secretaries and the branch directors of the \"Bank for\r\n Workers, Employees and Officials, Inc.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairmen of local committees as well as the employees of unions are\r\nnot to be taken into protective custody but are to be urged to continue\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nExceptions are granted only with the permission of the Gauleiter.\r\n\r\nThe taking over of the independent trade unions must proceed in such a\r\nfashion that the workers and employees will not be given the feeling\r\nthat this action is against them, but on the contrary, an action\r\nagainst a superannuated system which is not directed in conformity with\r\nthe interests of the German nation.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional local direction of the General German Trade Union and\r\nof the General Independent Employees' Federations is to be taken over\r\nby a commissar of the National Socialist Factory Cells Organization\r\n[NSBO].\r\n\r\nThe dealings with the authorities and other organizations are to be\r\nhanded over immediately to the newly installed commissars.\r\n\r\nAll funds and accounts of the independent trade unions are to be\r\nblocked immediately and remain thus until Thursday afternoon 1800\r\nhours. Insofar as incumbent cashiers are permitted to remain in office\r\nthey will be subject to the authority of the commissar. All payment\r\nreceipts must be countersigned by a commissar.\r\n\r\nAfter raising the blocking of funds the usual payments for the support\r\nof persons, etc. must be unconditionally assured in order not to create\r\na feeling of uneasiness among the members of the trade unions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible mass assemblies are to be arranged for the free\r\nattendance by all trade union members. In these meetings the meaning of\r\nthe action is to be set forth and it is to be explained that the rights\r\nof the workers and employees are being unequivocally guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe following unions belong to the General German Trade Union\r\nFederation [Here follows an enumeration of 28 unions].\r\n\r\nThe following unions belong to the General Independent Employees\r\nFederation [Here follows an enumeration of 13 unions].\r\n\r\nUp to the present time the following have been proposed for commissars:\r\n[Here follows an enumeration of 17 names as commissars for the most\r\nimportant arrangements of the General German Trade Union Federation].\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the newly installed commissars will be nominated by the\r\nGauleiters in close cooperation with the Regional Factory Cells Office.\r\n[Gaubetriebszellenamt].\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that this action is to proceed in a strongly\r\ndisciplined fashion. The Gauleiters are responsible in this respect;\r\nthey are to hold the direction of the action firmly in hand.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  /s/ Dr. Robert Ley\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe NSBO (National Socialist Factory Cells Organization) took over not\r\nonly the administrative apparatus but the entire press of the \"Free\r\nTrade Unions.\" The papers and magazines which had a pronounced party\r\npolitical [parteipolitisch] tendency had to stop their publication,\r\nwhile the other special publications continued. By all these measures\r\nMarxism was to be hit exclusively, but not the idea of trade unions\r\nas such, in which the right and defense of the German workers were\r\nembodied.\r\n\r\nOn 5 May 1933, the leader of the action committee reported to\r\nHitler the success of the ordered action. Then, in a public mass\r\ndemonstration, he reported about the events of 2 May to the workers\r\nof Berlin; at the same time, he unfolded before them his future plans\r\nwhich were to secure the maintenance of the financial efficiency of the\r\ntrade unions in the interest of the worker.\r\n\r\nFollowing the crushing of the free trade unions, the danger came, of\r\ncourse, that former functionaries would try to acquire money and other\r\nproperty items for themselves in an illegal manner. This, however,\r\nwould have entailed damage to the members. To avoid these dangers on 12\r\nMay 1933, the Attorney General of the State confiscated the property\r\nof the free trade unions and of all of their affiliated unions and\r\nadministrative agencies in order to secure an orderly disposition of\r\nthe property of the German workers. Dr. Robert Ley was assigned as\r\nthe attorney with the right to dispose of the confiscated property\r\n[vefuegungsberechtigter Pfleger der beschlagnahmten Vermoegen].\r\n\r\nWhile the free trade unions were smashed [zertruemmert] in the action\r\nof 2 May, Dr. Ley granted the entire Union of the Christian Trade\r\nUnions with further full liberty of movement. For this purpose, he told\r\nit on the 6th of May 1933 that \"nothing will be changed in the present\r\nsituation until the return of the Saar to the Reich and that they (the\r\nChristian Trade Unions) should continue as before to represent and\r\ncarry on the idea of the Christian Trade Unions and of Germandom as\r\nthey see it\". Therefore the Christian Trade Unions put on temporary\r\nconstraint in their attitude toward the social political events of 2\r\nMay and participated in the Saar in forming the \"German Trade Union\r\nFront\" in order to help to secure the result of the Saar voting by\r\nachieving a unity of the people.\r\n\r\nThe former free trade union leaders behaved differently. These, with\r\nthe assistance of their colleagues abroad and of the international\r\nunion of the trade unions, tried to oppose the measures of the German\r\ngovernment; this induced Dr. Ley to introduce the defense against\r\nsabotage by the legal authorities.\r\n\r\nThe hostile activities reached their peak at the International Workers\r\nConference of Geneva which began on 8 June 1933. From the German side,\r\nDr. Ley also took part in it; representatives of the Reich Cabinet\r\nand of the Christian Trade Unions were with him. The subjects for the\r\nmeeting were labor mediation, work conditions in certain branches of\r\nindustry, social insurance, provision for unemployed, and shortening\r\nof the working time. The participating states were to enter the\r\nbasic rules, which were to be set up in an international agreement,\r\ninto their social legislations. The Germans represented voiced the\r\nopinion that the situation of the working people could not be improved\r\nby international agreement but by providing work and bread for the\r\nworkers. In spite of this opposite opinion, Germany took part at the\r\nconference; in this way the German government wanted to prove that\r\nit had no purpose whatever to smash the social achievements of the\r\nGerman labor but that, on the contrary, she endeavored to retain them\r\nand lead them further. However, she was not willing to approve of an\r\ninternational agreement by which the further development of the German\r\nsocial legislation could be hampered.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference, a few foreign personalities opposed the German\r\nrepresentatives in such a way that Dr. Ley was induced to reject the\r\nfurther participation of the German Delegation in the discussions.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Geneva did not remain without influence upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the Christian Trade Unions. As already mentioned,\r\nthe Christian Trade Unions were first given opportunity to continue\r\ntheir social work without interference. They began to exploit this\r\nfavor. Also formally they have asserted that they were subject to\r\nall governmental measures which have been already taken or were to\r\nbe taken; but that they could not refrain in the course of time from\r\nstriving for a special position, which was to protect them from being\r\nideologically converted to the world of national socialistic ideas.\r\nThis attitude, which was contrary to the general interests and was\r\nprone to bring again dissension in the ranks of labor, induced Dr. Ley\r\non 24 June 1933 to order the complete incorporation of the Christian\r\nTrade Unions into the German Labor Front which had been founded in the\r\nmeantime. It was again the NSBO to which this task was assigned. At the\r\nsame time the leaders of the Christian Trade Unions lost their honorary\r\npositions which were granted to them by Dr. Ley in the new social\r\norder. Concerning this, Dr. Ley submitted the following statement:\r\n\r\n I. With the formation of the German Labor Front the majority of\r\n workers' and capitalists' organizations should have an opposite\r\n orientation. Not only should the last refuge of Marxism be liquidated\r\n by this means, but also it should be possible to remove the\r\n unfortunate schism of the German laboring men. Petty and selfish\r\n persons do not wish to recognize this great and revolutionary fact and\r\n seek to weaken this work by imitations and self-help organizations. It\r\n is the will of the Fuehrer that outside of the German Labor Front no\r\n other organization (whether of worker or of employers) is to exist * * *\r\n\r\n II. National Socialism is exercising the power in its strength most\r\n generously, however this proceeding is being interpreted here and\r\n there by its small opponents as weakness. This National Socialism\r\n believed that it could be generous in dealing with the Christian\r\n Trade Unions and other middle-class groups. This fact was answered\r\n by ingratitude and disloyalty. It turns out that the afore-mentioned\r\n unions have shown the greatest corruption in treasury matters and in\r\n economic affairs. Because of this knowledge I offer the following: All\r\n offices of the Christian Trade Unions and of employee unions are to be\r\n occupied by National Socialists * * *\r\n\r\n  (Signed) Dr. Robert LEY\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 404-PS\r\n\r\n  MEIN KAMPF\r\n  Adolf Hitler\r\n  German Edition, 1935\r\n\r\n  [Pages 456 to 457]\r\n\r\nIt is precisely our German people, that today, broken down, lies\r\ndefenseless against the kicks of the rest of the world who need\r\nthat suggestive force that lies in self-confidence.

Any such intention would\r\nbe thwarted a thousand times. Not only that our police authorities\r\ntoday have a staff of pimps and similar rabble at their disposal, who\r\nwill betray anything they can find for the Juda's payment of thirty\r\npieces of silver, and even invent things to betray, but the supporters\r\nthemselves can never be brought to the silence, that is necessary in\r\nsuch a case.

I was informed of this fact by the party members\r\nObergruppenfuehrer von Obernitz and Obergruppenfuehrer Litzmann\r\naround midnight of 9 November 1938. I declared to both these party\r\nmembers that I myself did not approve of an action involving arson\r\nof synagogues and destruction of goods but that I would raise no\r\nobjections, of course, if this action had been sanctioned by the party.\r\n_Therefore, what was done to the Jews during the night of 9/10 November\r\n1938 happened without my direct or indirect assistance._\r\n\r\n The consequences arising from the action against the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe action against the Jews of November 1938 was _not a spontaneous\r\none_ emanating from the population, and therefore was incomprehensible\r\nto many party members also as to its effects. Units of the components\r\nof the Party had been ordered to carry out the action against the\r\nJews. If there is evidence now that in isolated cases party members\r\nwith immaculate police records have appropriated goods during this\r\naction it should not be over-looked in judging such incidents that _the\r\nappropriation was committed in an instant, where all goods were being\r\ndestroyed in accordance with the orders given_.\r\n\r\n  April 14, 1939\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 407-II-PS\r\n\r\n  Telegram\r\n  GBA 760/43 [in ink crossed out in red]\r\n\r\n  10 March 3.\r\n\r\n  To the Fuehrer\r\n  Fuehrer headquarters\r\n\r\n _With the urgent request for immediate presentation to the Fuehrer in\r\n person and decision._\r\n\r\n _Subject_: Difficulties in recruiting of workers\r\n [Arbeitsdienstverpflichtung] in the former Soviet territories.\r\n\r\n  My Fuehrer:\r\n\r\nYou can be assured that the Arbeitseinsatz is being carried out by me\r\nwith fanatical determination, but also with care and consideration\r\nfor the economical and technical, as well as human, necessities and\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThe replacement for soldiers who are to be freed and the reinforcement\r\nof the armament program with newly needed workers can and will be\r\nsupplied, in spite of great difficulties, which had to be overcome in\r\nthe last two winter months. 258,000 foreign workers could be supplied\r\nduring January and February to war industry, although the transports in\r\nthe East were almost completely lacking. The commitment of German men\r\nand women is in full force.\r\n\r\nNow that the difficulties of the winter months are disappearing more\r\nand more the transports from the East can be put into full operation\r\nagain on account of preparations arranged by me. Although the report\r\nand commitment-results of German men and women is outstanding, in the\r\nheavy industrial labor the commitment of productive foreigners who are\r\nused to labor cannot be neglected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a few commanders in chief [Oberbefehlshaber] in the\r\nEast mobilized the recruiting of men and women in the conquered Soviet\r\nterritories, as I was told by Gauleiter Koch--for political reasons.\r\n\r\nMy Fuehrer! To fulfill my task I ask you to abolish these orders. I\r\nthink it impossible that the former Soviet people should experience a\r\nbetter consideration than our own German people, on whom I was forced\r\nto levy drastic measures. If the obligation for labor and the forced\r\nrecruiting of workers in the East is not possible anymore, then the\r\nGerman war industry and agriculture cannot fulfill their tasks to the\r\nfull extent.\r\n\r\nI myself have the opinion that our army leaders should not give\r\ncredence under any circumstances to the atrocity and propaganda\r\ncampaign of the Partisans. The generals themselves are greatly\r\ninterested that the support for the troops is made possible in time.\r\n\r\nI should like to point out that hundreds of thousands of excellent\r\nworkers going into the field as soldiers now, cannot possibly be\r\nsubstituted by German women, not used to work even if they are trying\r\nto do their best. Therefore I have to use the people of the eastern\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nI myself report to you, that the workers belonging to all foreign\r\nnations are treated humanely, correctly and cleanly, are fed and housed\r\nwell, and are even clothed. On the basis of my own services with\r\nforeign nations, I go as far as to state, that never before in the\r\nworld were foreign workers treated as correctly as is now happening in\r\nthe hardest of all wars by the German people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my Fuehrer, I ask you to abolish all orders which oppose the\r\nobligation of foreign workers for labor and to report to me kindly,\r\nwhether the concept of the mission presented here is still right.\r\n\r\nI would ask to talk to you personally about different important points\r\nof the Arbeitseinsatz at the beginning of next week, possibly Tuesday.\r\n\r\n  Yours, always thankful, sincere and obedient\r\n\r\n  Signed: Fritz Sauckel\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 407-V AND VI-PS\r\n\r\n  District Administration Thueringen of NSDAP\r\n  The Plenipotentiary for The Direction of Labour.\r\n\r\n  Weimar 15 April 1943\r\n  Nr. 435/43 10:25 o'clock\r\n\r\n  To the Fuehrer, Obersalzberg.\r\n\r\n  23 June 1943\r\n  [stamped]\r\n\r\n  My Fuehrer,\r\n\r\nAs Gruppenfuehrer Bormann has already informed you, I am going to the\r\neastern areas on the 15th April in order to secure 1 million workers\r\nfrom the East for the German war economy in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThe result of my last trip to France is that, after exact fulfillment\r\nof the last program, another 450,000 workers from the western areas\r\ntoo, will come into the Reich by the beginning of the summer.\r\n\r\nCounting the manpower which comes into question from Poland and the\r\nremaining areas, and which is in the neighborhood of about 150,000,\r\nit will become possible again to place 5- to 600,000 workers at the\r\ndisposal of German agriculture and 1 million workers at the disposal of\r\nthe armaments industry and the rest of the war industries by the coming\r\nsummer months.\r\n\r\nI beg you to agree that the new French labor forces can also come into\r\nthe Reich under conditions similar to those which applied to the last\r\ngroup. I have kept in touch with the High Command of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nSince the largest part of the Belgian civil workers and prisoners of\r\nwar perform very satisfactorily, I ask you to agree that a similar\r\nstatute to that which was granted to the French be made for some 20,000\r\nBelgian prisoners of war. This very great concession by you has made\r\na very deep impression upon Laval and the French Ministers. Laval has\r\nrepeatedly asked me to transmit his sincerest thanks for this to you,\r\nmy Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n1. After one year's activity as plenipotentiary for the direction of\r\nlabor, I can report that 3,638,056 new foreign workers were given to\r\nthe German war economy from 1 April of last year to 31 March this year.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, these forces have produced satisfactory performances.\r\nTheir feeding and housing is secured, their treatment so indisputably\r\nregulated that, in this respect too, our National Socialist Reich\r\npresents a shining example to the methods of the capitalist and\r\nbolshevist world. However, it is naturally inevitable that mistakes and\r\nblunders occur here and there. I will continue to endeavor with the\r\ngreatest energy to reduce them to a minimum.\r\n\r\nBesides the foreign civil workers, 1,622,829 prisoners of war will be\r\nemployed in the German economy.\r\n\r\n2. The 3,638,056 workers are distributed amongst the following branches\r\nof the German war economy:\r\n\r\n  Armament                 1,568,801\r\n  Mining industry            163,632\r\n  Building                   218,707\r\n  Communications             199,074\r\n  Agriculture and forestry 1,007,544\r\n  Other economic branches    480,298\r\n\r\nBesides the employment of foreign workers, 5 million German men and\r\nwomen workers were transferred, inside the German economic structure,\r\nto the German war economy proper by being switched from businesses\r\nunimportant to the war effort to important ones, or by retraining.\r\n\r\nAll of these efforts were necessary in order to smooth out the natural\r\nfluctuations, for example, through death, sickness, expirations or\r\nbreaches of contract, but especially through drafting into the Armed\r\nForces and the shifting of industries into other regions and to\r\nfacilitate the enlargement of the armament works, the establishment of\r\nnew factories and the fulfillment of new programs.\r\n\r\n3. The result of the registration action for men and women up to the 7\r\nApril is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the order of 27 January 1943, 3,249,743 men and women\r\nhave registered. The results are not yet final.\r\n\r\n  The number of men amounts to   553,415\r\n  that of women to             2,696,328\r\n\r\nUp till now about 52% of these registrations (that is 1,851,771) have\r\nbeen definitely fixed up by the Labor Bureaux.\r\n\r\nUp till now only 32.5% of the men come into question for the direction\r\nof labor as the majority do not fit in with the requirements as a\r\nresult of old age or sickness.\r\n\r\nEmployed up to the present moment are 66,008 men. Up to 7 April 732,489\r\nwomen were put to work.\r\n\r\nThis result must be designated as outstanding. 44% of these women,\r\nhowever, work less than 48 hours per week because of their domestic\r\ncircumstances. The basic armament industry has received from the women\r\nand men employed\r\n\r\n   20,670 men\r\n  341,100 women\r\n\r\nIt was possible to make some 130,000 available to agriculture and the\r\nrest to the Armed forces, postal service, railroads, etc.\r\n\r\n4. The result of the shutting-down measures taken by the Reich Minister\r\nfor Economic Affairs includes 74,644 persons, of this group, mostly\r\nover-age and consisting of 27,218 men, 47,426 women, only a third\r\ncould be directed to industry, 10,108 men, 17,929 women, of these the\r\narmament industry received 5,258 men, 8,621 women.\r\n\r\nThe rest were distributed to the remaining industries of war importance\r\nand to the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n5. The demands of the armaments industry for men and women workers and\r\nthe allocations of these from December 1942 until the end of March 1943\r\ngive the following result:\r\n\r\n          _Demand_                       _Allocation_\r\n  December 1942 }                        250,000\r\n  January 1943  } total 335,000          172,000\r\n  February 1943 }                        235,000\r\n                                         -------\r\n                                 total-- 657,000\r\n\r\n  March 1943            225,000          450,000\r\n  replacements for those\r\n  drafted from the armaments\r\n  industry.             240,000\r\n                        -------        ---------\r\n                        800,000        1,107,000\r\n\r\nIn the March figures 320,000 men and women are brought into account by\r\nthe registration-action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince I, my Fuehrer, shall be staying in the eastern provinces on the\r\n20 April, I beg, already today, to be allowed to extend my most fervent\r\ngood wishes to you, along with those of my district and my family.\r\n\r\nYou can be assured that the district of Thueringen and I will serve you\r\nand our dear people with the employment of all strength.\r\n\r\nThe warmest desire is that you, my Fuehrer, may always enjoy the\r\nbest of health and that we ourselves can serve you to your complete\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n  Your faithful and obedient,\r\n  [signed] Fritz Sauckel\r\n\r\n Passed on: Puttig.\r\n\r\n Received: Weismann Oberg.\r\n\r\n Officially received: 1130 o'clock Heinstein pkz Munich for Section\r\n Roem. 3.\r\n\r\n  The above telegram was also sent in letter form.

The total number of laborers employed by\r\nthe OT amounted to 270,969 at the end of March 1942 and 696,003 at the\r\nend of March 1943.\r\n\r\nIn this it is noteworthy that the Arbeitseinsatz has accelerated the OT\r\nin the West for the purpose of completing the work on the Atlantic Wall\r\nand has furnished laborers with utmost energy. This is all the more\r\nremarkable because:\r\n\r\n1. In France, Belgium and Holland the industries work for the German\r\nwar economy exclusively, and must always be supplied with labor in any\r\ncase;\r\n\r\n2. Great numbers of workers must be placed at the disposal of the\r\nGerman economy within the Reich itself.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the attendant difficulties the supply of the OT in the west\r\nwas raised from 66,701 at the end of March 1942 to 248,200 at the end\r\nof March 1943.\r\n\r\nThus the Arbeitseinsatz has done everything to help make possible the\r\ncompletion of the Atlantic Wall.\r\n\r\n  to _a_ Heil Hitler!\r\n  Your obedient and faithful\r\n  Fritz Sauckel\r\n  to _b_ Your continually obliged\r\n  Fritz Saukel\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 407-IX-PS\r\n\r\n  The Commissioner for the Four Year Plan\r\n  The Plenipotentiary for the Arbeitseinsatz\r\n  Berlin W8, 3 June 1943\r\n\r\n  1751/43 [pencilled] ab 6/4/43\r\n  To the Fuehrer of Greater Germany\r\n  The Fuehrer's Hq\r\n  My Fuehrer!\r\n\r\nI beg to be permitted to report to you on the situation of the\r\nArbeitseinsatz for the first 5 months of 1943.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the following number of new foreign laborers and\r\nPrisoners of War were employed in the German war industry:\r\n\r\n  January 1943  --120,085\r\n  February 1943 --138,354\r\n  March 1943    --257,382\r\n  April 1943    --160,535\r\n  May 1943      --170,155\r\n                 --------\r\n         Total  --846,511\r\n\r\nI may remark that this number of 850,000 was reached only after\r\ngreatest difficulties were overcome which had not existed during the\r\nprevious year; all those who have worked for the Arbeitseinsatz,\r\nparticularly in the occupied territories, did so with the greatest\r\nfanaticism and devotion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately quite a number of our officials and employees were\r\nvictims of murders and attacks by partisans.\r\n\r\nBesides those labor forces recruited for work within the Reich, several\r\nhundred thousand laborers were recruited in the occupied territories\r\nthrough the agencies for the Arbeitseinsatz as well as through the OT\r\nand the factories working in the East and the West for the German war\r\nindustry. Furthermore the Wehrmacht received a large number of laborers\r\nas well as labor volunteers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, because of the order dated 27 January 1943 requiring\r\neverybody to register, the following numbers of men and women were made\r\navailable:\r\n\r\n             _Men_      _Women_      _Total_\r\n  February  14,594    163,012    177,606\r\n  March     45,606    494,931    540,537\r\n  April     19,315    269,374    288,689\r\n  May       11,405    186,683    198,168\r\n            ------  ---------  ---------\r\n  Total     91,000  1,114,000  1,205,000\r\n\r\nOf these approximately 800,000 are available only for less than 48\r\nhours of work per week.\r\n\r\nAltogether, German war industry during the first 5 months of 1943\r\nrecruited more than 2,000,000 laborers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, negotiations resulted in agreements and regulations on the\r\nfollowing points: Wage control and increased production in the various\r\nEuropean territories especially in France, which enabled us to keep\r\nwages in the occupied European territories on a reasonable level, to\r\nstabilize living conditions of foreign laborers working for Germany in\r\nspite of the difficult conditions of war, to increase production by\r\nmeans of wage control in these territories. These measures were carried\r\nout in agreement with industrial and farming authorities as well as\r\nwith the Commissioner of the Reich for the control of prices.\r\n\r\n  Heil!\r\n  Your obedient and faithful\r\n  Signed: Sauckel\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 437-PS\r\n\r\n [Extract from report of Hans Frank to Hitler re situation in Poland,\r\n dated 19 June 1943--Pages 10 and 11.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, a series of measures or of consequences of the\r\nGerman rule have led to a substantial _deterioration of the attitude_\r\nof the entire Polish people in the General Gouvernment. These measures\r\nhave affected either individual professions or the entire population\r\nand frequently also--often with crushing severity--the fate of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nAmong these are in particular:\r\n\r\n1. The entirely insufficient nourishment of the population, mainly of\r\nthe working classes in the cities, whose majority is working for German\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nUntil the war in 1939, its food supplies, though not varied, were\r\nsufficient and generally secure, due to the agrarian surplus of the\r\nformer Polish state and in spite of the negligence on the part of their\r\nformer political leadership.\r\n\r\n2. The confiscation of a great part of the Polish estates and the\r\nexpropriation without compensation and resettlement of Polish peasants\r\nfrom manoeuvre areas and from German settlements.\r\n\r\n3. Encroachments and confiscations in the industries, in commerce and\r\ntrade and in the field of private property.\r\n\r\n4. Mass arrests and mass shootings by the German police who applied the\r\nsystem of collective responsibility.\r\n\r\n5. The rigorous methods of recruiting workers.\r\n\r\n6. The extensive paralyzation of cultural life.\r\n\r\n7. The closing of high schools, junior colleges and universities.\r\n\r\n8. The limitation, indeed the complete elimination of Polish influence\r\nfrom all spheres of State administration.\r\n\r\n9. Curtailment of the influence of the Catholic Church, limiting its\r\nextensive influence--an undoubtedly necessary move--and, in addition,\r\nuntil quite recently, the closing and confiscation of monasteries,\r\nschools and charitable institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 440-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 20 Nov. 1939\r\n  The Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces\r\n  OKW/WFA No. 213/39 g.k.

The state of alert, to make the continuation of the initiated\r\nconcentration of troops possible at any moment, must be maintained, for\r\nthe time being. Only this will make it possible to exploit favorable\r\nweather conditions immediately.\r\n\r\nThe various components of the Armed Forces will make arrangements\r\nenabling them to stop the attack even if the order for such action is\r\nreceived by the High Command as late as D-1 at 2300 hours. The keyword\r\n\r\n  \"Rhein\" (--start attack)\r\n  or\r\n  \"Elbe\" (--withhold attack)\r\n\r\nwill be passed on to the High Commands at the latest by this time.\r\n\r\nThe High Commands of the Army and the Air Forces are requested after\r\nhaving determined the day for attack, to notify Department L of the\r\nHigh Command of the Armed Forces immediately with regard to the\r\nmutually agreed hour of the commencement of the attack.\r\n\r\n2. Contrary to previous orders, all measures intended against the\r\nNetherlands are to be carried out without special orders at the start\r\nof the general attack.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the Dutch Armed Forces cannot be foreseen. The\r\nentering of our troops will take the character of a friendly occupation\r\nwherever no opposition is encountered.\r\n\r\n3. The _Land-operations_ are to be carried out on the basis of the\r\nassemble directive of 29 October. The following is added to complete\r\nthis directive:\r\n\r\n_a._ All measures have to be taken to move the emphasis of the\r\noperation quickly from Army Group B to Army Group A if greater and\r\nquicker successes than at Army Group B should be obtained there as the\r\npresent disposition of enemy's forces that would indicate.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Dutch area, including the coastal West-Frisian Islands,\r\nwithout Texel for the time being, is to be seized as far as the\r\nGrebbe-Haas Line, until further notice.\r\n\r\n4. _The Navy_ is authorized to take blockage measures for submarines\r\nagainst the Belgian and, contrary to previous orders, also against\r\nDutch harbors and waterways, in the night before the attack and from\r\nthe time of the start of the blockade activities and the time of the\r\nland attack must also be kept as short as possible in the case of the\r\nuse of submarines.\r\n\r\nCombat actions against Dutch naval forces are only authorized, if they\r\nadopt a hostile attitude.\r\n\r\nThe Navy is charged with the coastal artillery defense of the coastal\r\nregions to be occupied, against attacks from the sea. Preparations have\r\nto be made accordingly.\r\n\r\n5. The tasks of the _Air Force_ remain unchanged. They have been\r\nsupplemented by special orders, issued orally by the Fuehrer,\r\nconcerning the landing from the air and the support of the army by the\r\nseizure of the bridges west of Maastricht.\r\n\r\nThe 7th _Air_-borne Division will only be committed for landing\r\nactivities from the air after the seizure of bridges across the Albert\r\nCanal has been secured. The fastest means of transmission of this\r\nmessage between the High Command of the Army and the High Command of\r\nthe Air Force must be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nLocalities, especially great open town, and the industries are not to\r\nbe attacked either in the Dutch or the Belgian-Luxembourg area, without\r\n(urgent) military reasons.\r\n\r\n6. _The closing of the frontiers._ _a._ The border and news traffic\r\nacross the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg frontiers is to be kept at\r\nits present volume _until the beginning of the attack_ in the orders\r\nto that effect to the military and civilian authorities are not to\r\nparticipate in the preparations for the closing of the border until the\r\nstart of the attack.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Reich-Border is to be _closed_ towards the Netherlands,\r\nBelgium and Luxembourg for all non-military border and news traffic\r\n_at the start of the attack_. The Commander-in-Chief issues the orders\r\nto that effect to the military and civilian authorities concerned. The\r\nHighest Reich Authorities concerned, will be informed by the OKW (High\r\nCommand of the Armed Forces) at the beginning of the attack that the\r\nmeasures for the closing of the borders will be issued immediately by\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief of the Army, even for the Dutch Border outside\r\nof the operational territory.\r\n\r\n_c._ At first, restrictions in the border and news traffic will not\r\nbe ordered after the start of the attack on the other Reich-Borders\r\ntowards the neutral countries. Further prepared measures for the\r\nsurveillance of personal and news traffic will be taken, if necessary.\r\n\r\n  By order\r\n  Distribution:       Signed: Keitel\r\n\r\n High Command of the Army--1st Copy.\r\n\r\n High Command of the Navy--2nd Copy.\r\n\r\n R. d.

The _Landing_ must be carried out in the form of a surprise crossing\r\non a broad front approximately from Ramsgate to the area west of\r\nthe Isle of Wight, in which air force units will take the roll of\r\nartillery, and units of the navy the roll of the engineers. Whether it\r\nis practical to undertake subordinate actions, such as the occupation\r\nof the Isle of Wight or of County Cornwall, before the general landing\r\nis to be determined from the standpoint of every branch of the armed\r\nforces and the result is to be reported to me. I reserve the decision\r\nfor myself. The preparations for the entire operation must be completed\r\nby _mid-August_.\r\n\r\n2. To these preparations also belong the creation of those conditions\r\nwhich make a landing in England possible.\r\n\r\n_a._ The English air-force must morally and actually be so far\r\novercome, that it does not any longer show any considerable aggressive\r\nforce against the German attack.\r\n\r\n_b._ Mine-free channels must be created.\r\n\r\n_c._ By means of a closely concentrated mine-barrier the straight of\r\nDover on both _Flanks_ as well as the western entrance to the channel\r\nin the approximate line Aldemey-Portland must be sealed off.\r\n\r\n_d._ The area in front of the coast must be dominated and given\r\nartillery protection by strong coastal artillery.\r\n\r\n_e._ Tying down of the English naval forces in the North Sea as well as\r\nin the Mediterranean (by the Italians) is desired, whereby it must now\r\nbe attempted that the English naval forces which are in the homeland be\r\ndamaged by air and torpedo attack in strength.\r\n\r\n3. Organization of the leadership and of the preparations;\r\n\r\nUnder my command and according to my general directions the supreme\r\ncommanders will lead the forces to be used from their branches of\r\nservice. The command-staffs of the supreme commander of the army,\r\nthe supreme commander of the Navy, and the supreme commander of the\r\nair-force must from 1 August on be located within a radius of at least\r\n50 km. from my headquarters (Ziegenberg). Lodging the command staffs of\r\nthe supreme commanders of the army and navy together at Giessen appears\r\npractical to me.\r\n\r\nHence for the leadership of the landing armies the supreme commander of\r\nthe army will have to employ an army group hq.\r\n\r\nThe project bears the code-name \"Seeloewe\" [Sea-lion].\r\n\r\nIn the preparation and carrying out of the undertaking the following\r\ntasks fall to the various branches:\r\n\r\n_a._ _Army_: will draw up the operational plan and the transport\r\nplan for all units of the 1st wave to embark. The AA artillery to be\r\ntransported with the 1st wave will at the same time be attached to\r\nthe army (to the individual crossing groups) until such a time as a\r\ndivision of tasks in support and protection of ground troops protection\r\nof the ports of debarkation and protection of the aerial strong points\r\nto be occupied can be carried out. The Army furthermore distributes the\r\nmeans of transport to the individual crossing groups and establishes\r\nthe embarkation and landing points in agreement with the Navy.\r\n\r\n_b._ _Navy_: will secure the means of transport and will bring\r\nthem corresponding to the desires of the Army and according to the\r\nrequirements of seamanship into the individual embarkation areas.\r\nInsofar as possible ships of the defeated enemy states are to be\r\nprocured. For every ferrying point it will provide the necessary naval\r\nstaff for advice on matters of seamanship with escort vessels and\r\nsecurity forces. It will protect, along with the air forces employed to\r\nguard the movement, the entire crossing of the channel on both flanks.\r\nAn order will follow on the regulation of the command relationship\r\nduring the crossing. It is further the task of the navy to regulate,\r\nin a uniform manner, the building up of the coastal artillery, that\r\nis, all batteries which can be used for firing against sea targets of\r\nthe Army as well as of the Navy, and to organize the fire control of\r\nthe whole. As great an amount of _very heavy artillery_ as possible\r\nis to be employed as quickly as possible to secure the crossing and\r\nto protect the flanks from enemy operations from the sea. For this\r\npurpose, railway artillery (supplemented by all available captured\r\npieces) without the batteries (Ks and K12) provided for firing on\r\ntargets on the English mainland, is to be brought up and emplaced by\r\nuse of railway turntables.\r\n\r\nIndependent of this, the heaviest available platform batteries are to\r\nbe opposite the Straits of Dover, so emplaced under concrete that they\r\ncan withstand even the heaviest aerial attacks and thereby dominate the\r\nStraits of Dover under any circumstances in the long run, within their\r\neffective range.\r\n\r\nThe technical work is the responsibility of the Todt Organization.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Mission of the Air Force is_: To hinder interference from the\r\nenemy air force. To overcome coastal defenses which could do damage to\r\nthe landing positions, to break the first resistance of enemy troops\r\nand to smash reserves which may be coming up. For this mission closest\r\ncooperation of individual units of the air force with the crossing\r\nunits is necessary. Furthermore, to destroy important transportation\r\nroutes for the bringing up of enemy reserves, and to attack enemy naval\r\nforces, which are coming up, while they are still far away from the\r\ncrossing points. I request proposals on the use of parachute and glider\r\ntroops. In this regard it is to be determined if it is worth-while here\r\nto hold parachute and glider troops in readiness as a reserve to be\r\nquickly committed in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n4. The armed forces chief of signals will carry out the necessary\r\npreparations for signal connections from France to the English\r\nmainland. The installation of the remaining 80km East Prussian cables\r\nis to be provided for in conjunction with the Navy.\r\n\r\n5.

For the time being France will\r\nhave the role of a \"non-belligerent power\"--she will have to tolerate\r\nGerman military measures on her territory, especially in the African\r\ncolonies, and to give support, as far as possible, even by using her\r\nown means of defense. The most pressing task of the French is the\r\ndefensive and offensive protection of their French possessions (West\r\nand Equatorial Africa) against England and the deGaulle movement. From\r\nthis initial task France's participation in the war against England can\r\ndevelop fully.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, the conversations with France resulting from my\r\nmeeting with Marshal Petain are being carried on--apart from the\r\ncurrent work of the armistice commission--entirely by the foreign\r\noffice [Auswartiges Amt] in cooperation with the Supreme Command of the\r\nArmed Forces [OKW].\r\n\r\nMore detailed directives will follow at the close of these talks.\r\n\r\n2. _Spain and Portugal._ Political steps to bring about an early\r\nSpanish entry into the war have been taken. The aim of _German_\r\nintervention in the Iberian peninsula (code name Felix) will be to\r\ndrive the English out of the Western Mediterranean. For this purpose:\r\n\r\n_a._ Gibraltar will be taken and the Straits closed.\r\n\r\n_b._ The British will be prevented from gaining a foothold at another\r\npoint of the Iberian peninsula, or the Atlantic Islands.\r\n\r\nThe preparation and execution of this operation is intended as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n _Section I_\r\n\r\n_a._ Reconnaissance troops (officers in civilian clothes) make the\r\nnecessary preparations for the action against Gibraltar and for taking\r\nover aerodromes. As regards disguise and cooperation with the Spaniards\r\nthey will comply with the security measures of the Chief of Foreign\r\nIntelligence.\r\n\r\n_b._ Special units of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau are to take over\r\nthe protection of the Gibraltar area, in secret cooperation with the\r\nSpaniards, against English attempts to widen the terrain in front and\r\nagainst premature discovery and frustration of our preparations.\r\n\r\n_c._ The units intended for this operation will be kept in readiness\r\naway from the French-Spanish border and information will be withheld\r\nfrom the troops, at this early stage. In order to start operations, a\r\nwarning order will be given three weeks before the troops cross the\r\nSpanish-French border (but only after conclusion of the preparations\r\nregarding the Atlantic Islands).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the low capacity of the Spanish railways, the army will\r\ndetail mainly motorized units for this operation, so that the railways\r\nare available for reinforcements.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Section II_\r\n\r\n_a._ Units of the Air Force, directed by observation at Algeciras,\r\nwill, at a favorable moment, carry out an air attack from French soil\r\non the units of the British fleet lying in the port of Gibraltar, and\r\nwill force a landing on Spanish aerodromes after the attack.\r\n\r\n_b._ Shortly after this the units intended for use in Spain will cross\r\nthe Franco-Spanish frontier on land or in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Section III_\r\n\r\n_a._ Attack for the seizure of Gibraltar by German troops.\r\n\r\n_b._ Mobilization of troops to march into Portugal should the British\r\ngain a foothold there. The units intended for this will march into\r\nSpain immediately after the units intended for Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Section IV_\r\n\r\nSupport by the Spanish in closing the Straits after the seizure of the\r\nRock from the Spanish-Moroccan side as well, if required.\r\n\r\nAs for the _strength_ of the units to be used for operation \"Felix\" the\r\nfollowing will apply:\r\n\r\n_Army._ The units intended for Gibraltar must be in sufficient strength\r\nto seize the Rock even without Spanish assistance.\r\n\r\nApart from this, a smaller group must be available to aid the Spaniards\r\nin the unlikely event of the British attempting to land at a different\r\npoint on the coast. The units to be kept in readiness for a possible\r\ninvasion of Portugal are to be predominately of a mobile nature.\r\n\r\n_Air Force._ Sufficient forces will be detailed for the air attack on\r\nGibraltar to guarantee substantial success.\r\n\r\nFor the subsequent operations against naval objectives and for the\r\nsupport of the attack on the Rock mainly dive-bomber units are to be\r\ntransferred to Spain.\r\n\r\nSufficient anti-aircraft artillery is to be supplied to the army units,\r\nand is also to be used to engage ground targets.\r\n\r\n_Navy._ Provision is to be made for U-boats to attack the\r\nBritish-Gibraltar-Squadron, particularly when they leave harbor, which\r\nthey are expected to do after the air raid.\r\n\r\nTo support the Spaniards in the closing of the Straits, preparations\r\nare to be made in cooperation with the army for the transfer of\r\n_single_ coastal batteries.\r\n\r\nAn Italian participation is not envisaged.\r\n\r\nAs a result of operation \"Gibraltar\", the _Atlantic Islands_ (in\r\nparticular the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands) will gain increased\r\nimportance for the British conduct of the war at sea, as well as\r\nfor our own. The commanders in chief of the Navy and Air Force are\r\nexamining how the Spanish defense of the Canaries can be supported and\r\nhow the Cape Verde Islands can be occupied.\r\n\r\nI also request that the question of an occupation of Madeira and the\r\nAzores be examined and also the advantages and disadvantages that would\r\narise from this for the conduct of the war at sea and in the air. The\r\nresults of this examination are to be given to me as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n3. _Italian Offensive against Egypt._ If at all, the use of German\r\nforces only comes into consideration after the Italians have reached\r\nMorsa Metruh. Even then the use of German air forces will be considered\r\nmainly if the Italians put at our disposal the air bases necessary for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of the branches of the armed forces for use in this or\r\nany other North African theatre of war are to be carried on as follows:\r\n\r\n_Army._ Holding an armored division ready for use in North Africa\r\n(composition as previously provided for).\r\n\r\n_Navy._ Fitting out of such German ships lying in Italian ports as\r\nare suitable as transports for the transfer of the strongest possible\r\nforces either to Libya or to North West Africa.\r\n\r\n_Air Force._ Preparations for attacks on Alexandria and on the Suez\r\nCanal, so as to deny the British Command the use of the latter.\r\n\r\n4. _Balkans._ The commanders-in-chief of the Army will make\r\npreparations for occupying the Greek mainland north of the Aegean Sea\r\nin case of need, entering through Bulgaria, and thus make possible\r\nthe use of German air force units against targets in the Eastern\r\nMediterranean, in particular against those English air bases which are\r\nthreatening the Roumanian oil area.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to face all eventualities and to keep Turkey in\r\ncheck, the use of an army group of an approximate strength of ten\r\ndivisions is to be the basis for the planning and the calculations of\r\ndeployment. It will not be possible to count on the railway, leading\r\nthrough Yugoslavia, for moving these forces into position.\r\n\r\nSo as to shorten the time needed for the deployment, preparations will\r\nbe made for an early increase in the German Army mission in Roumania,\r\nthe extent of which must be submitted to me.\r\n\r\n_The Commander-in-chief of the Air Force_ will make preparations for\r\nthe use of German Air Force units in the South East Balkans and for\r\naerial reconnaissance on the southern border of Bulgaria, in accordance\r\nwith the intended ground operations.\r\n\r\nThe German Air Force mission in Roumania will be increased to the\r\nextent proposed to me.\r\n\r\nBulgarian requests to equip their army (supply of weapons, ammunition)\r\nare to be given favorable treatment.\r\n\r\n5. _Russia._ Political discussions have been initiated with the aim of\r\nclarifying Russia's attitude for the time being. Irrespective of the\r\nresults of these discussions, all preparations for the East which have\r\nalready been verbally ordered will be continued.\r\n\r\nInstructions on this will follow, as soon as the general outline of the\r\narmy's operational plans has been submitted to, and approved by, me.\r\n\r\n6. _Landing in England._ Due to a change in the general situation it\r\nmay yet be possible or necessary to start operation \"Seeloewe\" in the\r\nspring of 1941. The three services of the armed forces must therefore\r\nearnestly endeavor to improve conditions for such an operation in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n7. I shall expect _the commanders-in-chief to express their opinions_\r\nof the measures anticipated in this directive. I shall then give\r\norders regarding the methods of execution and synchronization of the\r\nindividual actions. In order to assure secrecy, only a restricted staff\r\nwill work on these plans. This applies particularly to the operations\r\nin Spain and for the plans concerning the Atlantic Isles.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Adolf Hitler\r\n  J [initialled: Jodl]\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  Ob.d.H (Op.Abt.)--1st Copy.\r\n  Ob.d.M (l.Skl.)--2nd Copy.\r\n  Ob.d.L.

This concentration of\r\nthe main effort in the East is limited by the following reservation:\r\nThat the entire battle and armament area dominated by us must remain\r\nsufficiently protected against enemy air attacks and that the attacks\r\non England and especially the supply for them must not be permitted to\r\nbreak down.\r\n\r\nConcentration of the main effort of the Navy remains unequivocally\r\nagainst England also during an Eastern campaign.\r\n\r\nIf occasion arises I will order the concentration of troops for action\r\nagainst Soviet Russia eight weeks before the intended beginning of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nPreparations requiring more time to start are--if this has not yet been\r\ndone--to begin presently and are to be completed by 15 May 1941.\r\n\r\nGreat caution has to be exercised that the intention of an attack will\r\nnot be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of the High Command are to be made on the following\r\nbasis:\r\n\r\n I. _General Purpose_:\r\n\r\nThe mass of the Russian _Army_ in Western Russia is to be destroyed in\r\ndaring operations by driving forward deep wedges with tanks and the\r\nretreat of intact battle-ready troops into the wide spaces of Russia is\r\nto be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn quick pursuit a (given) line is to be reached from where the Russian\r\nAirforce will no longer be able to attack German Reich territory. The\r\nfirst goal of operations is the protection from Asiatic Russia from\r\nthe general line Volga-Archangelsk. In case of necessity, the last\r\nindustrial area in the Urals left to Russia could be eliminated by the\r\nLuftwaffe.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these operations the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet will\r\nquickly erase its bases and will no longer be ready to fight.\r\n\r\nEffective intervention by the Russian _Airforce_ is to be prevented\r\nthrough forceful blows at the beginning of the operations.\r\n\r\n II. _Probable Allies and their tasks._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[_Page 4_, _par.

It will be the task of Rumania, together with the forces\r\nconcentrating there, to pin down the opponent on the other side and, in\r\naddition, to render auxiliary services in the rear area.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [_Page 8_, _par.

It must be clearly understood that all orders to be given by the\r\n commanders-in-chief on the basis of this letter of instructions are\r\n _precautionary measures_, in case Russia should change her present\r\n attitude toward us. The number of officers to be drafted for the\r\n preparations at an early time is to be kept as small as possible.\r\n Further co-workers are to be detailed as late as possible and only\r\n as far as each individual is needed for a specific task. Otherwise,\r\n the danger exists that our preparations (the time of their execution\r\n has not been fixed) will become known and thereby grave political and\r\n military disadvantages would result.\r\n\r\n\r\n V. I am expecting the reports of the commanders-in-chief on their\r\n further plans based on this letter of instructions.\r\n\r\nThe preparation planned by all branches of the Armed Forces are to be\r\nreported to me through the High Command, also in regard to their time.\r\n\r\n  [signed] Hitler\r\n  [initialed by: Jodl, Keitel, Warlimont and one illegible.]\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  Ob. d.

Top Secret. 18 December 1940\r\n  Directives for Special Areas to Order #21\r\n  (Case Barbarossa)\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Area of operations and executive power\r\n\r\n1. The authorization to issue orders and the regulations regarding\r\nsupply for an area of operations _within the armed forces_ shall be set\r\nup by the High Command of the Armed Forces in _East Prussia_ and in the\r\n_General Gouvernement_ at the latest four weeks before operations are\r\nstarted. The proposal by the High Command of the Army (OKH) is being\r\nmade in time, after an agreement with the Commander of the Luftwaffe\r\n(Ob.d.L.) has been reached.\r\n\r\nIt is not contemplated to _declare_ East Prussia and the General\r\nGouvernement _an area of operations_. However, in accordance with\r\nthe unpublished Fuehrer orders from 19 and 21 October 1939, the\r\nSupreme Commander of the Army shall be authorized to take all\r\nmeasures necessary for the execution of his military aim and for the\r\nsafeguarding of the troops. He may transfer his authority onto the\r\nSupreme Commander of the Army Groups and Armies. Orders of that kind\r\nhave priority over all orders issued by civilian agencies.\r\n\r\n2. _The Russian territory_ which is to be occupied shall be divided up\r\ninto individual states with _governments of their own_, according to\r\nspecial orders, as soon as military operations are concluded. From this\r\nthe following is inferred:\r\n\r\n_a._ _The area of operations_, created through the advance of the Army\r\nbeyond the frontiers of the Reich and the neighboring countries is to\r\nbe limited in depth as far as possible. The Supreme Commander of the\r\nArmy has the right to exercise the executive power in this area, and\r\nmay transfer his authority onto the Supreme Commanders of the Army\r\nGroups and Armies.\r\n\r\n_b._ In the area of operations, the _Reichsfuehrer SS_ is, on behalf of\r\nthe Fuehrer, entrusted with _special tasks_ for the preparation of the\r\n_political administration_, tasks which result from the struggle which\r\nhas to be carried out between two opposing political systems. Within\r\nthe realm of these tasks, the Reichsfuehrer SS shall act independently\r\nand under his own responsibility. The executive power invested in the\r\nSupreme Commander of the Army (OKH) and in agencies determined by\r\nhim shall not be affected by this. It is the responsibility of the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS that through the execution of his tasks military\r\noperations shall not be disturbed. Details shall be arranged directly\r\nthrough the OKH with the Reichsfuehrer SS.\r\n\r\n_c._ As soon as the area of operations has reached sufficient depth,\r\nit is to be _limited in the rear_. The newly occupied territory in\r\nthe rear of the area of operations is to be given its own _political_\r\nadministration. For the present, it is to be divided, according to\r\nits genealogic basis and to the positions of the Army Groups, into\r\n_North_ (_Baltic countries_), _Center_ (_White Russia_) _and_ _South_\r\n(_Ukraine_). In these territories _the political administration is\r\ntaken care of by Commissioners of the Reich_ who receive their orders\r\nfrom the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n3. For the execution of all _military tasks_ within the areas under\r\nthe political administration in the rear of the area of operations,\r\n_commanding officers_ who are responsible to the Supreme Commander of\r\nthe Armed Forces (OKW) shall be in command.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer is the _supreme representative of the Armed\r\nForces_ in the respective areas and the bearer of the _military\r\nsovereign rights_. He has _the tasks of a Territorial Commander_ and\r\nthe rights of a supreme Army Commander or a Commanding General. In this\r\ncapacity he is responsible primarily for the following tasks:\r\n\r\n_a._ Close cooperation with the Commissioner of the Reich in order to\r\nsupport him in his political task.\r\n\r\n_b._ Exploitation of the country and securing its economic values for\r\nuse by German industry (see par. 4).\r\n\r\n_c._ Exploitation of the country for the supply of the troops according\r\nto the needs of the OKH.\r\n\r\n_d._ Military security of the whole area, mainly airports, routes of\r\nsupply and supply-dumps against revolt, sabotage and enemy paratroops.\r\n\r\n_e._ Traffic regulations.\r\n\r\n_f._ Billeting for armed forces, police and organizations, and for PW's\r\ninasmuch as they remain in the administrative areas.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer has the right, as opposed to the _civilian_\r\nagencies, to issue orders which are necessary for the execution of the\r\nmilitary tasks. His orders supersede all others, also those of the\r\ncommissioners of the Reich.\r\n\r\nService directives, mobilization orders and directives on the\r\ndistribution of the necessary forces shall be issued separately.\r\n\r\n_The time for the assumption of command_ by the commanding officers\r\nwill be ordered as soon as the military situation shall allow a change\r\nin the command without disrupting military operations. Until such time,\r\nthe agencies set up by the OKH remain in office, operating according to\r\nthe principles valid for the commanding officers.\r\n\r\n4. The Fuehrer has entrusted the uniform direction of _the\r\nadministration of economy_ in the area of operations and in the\r\nterritories of political administration to the Reich Marshal who has\r\ndelegated the _Chief of the \"Wi Rue Amt\"_ with the execution of the\r\ntask. Special orders on that will come from the OKW/Wi Rue Amt.\r\n\r\n5. The majority of the _Police Forces_ shall be under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Commissioners of the Reich. Requests for the employment of\r\npolice forces in the area of operations on the part of the OKH are\r\nto be made as early as possible to the OKW/Armed Forces Operational\r\nStaff/Section Defense.\r\n\r\n6. The behavior of the troops towards the population and the tasks of\r\nthe _military courts_ shall be separately regulated, and commanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Personnel, Supply and Communication Traffic_:\r\n\r\n7. Special orders shall be issued by the OKW Armed Forces Operational\r\nStaff for the measures necessary _before the beginning of operations_\r\nfor the restriction of travel, delivery of goods and communications to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n8. _As soon as operations begin_, the German-Soviet Russian frontier\r\nand at a later stage the border at the rear of the area of operations\r\nwill be closed by the OKH for any and all non-military traffic with\r\nthe exception of the police organizations to be deployed by the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS on the Fuehrer's orders. Billeting and feeding of\r\nthese organizations will be taken care of by the OKH-Gen. Qu. who may\r\nfor this purpose request from the Reichsfuehrer SS the assignment of\r\nliaison officers.\r\n\r\nThe border shall remain closed also for leading personalities of the\r\nhighest government agencies and agencies of the Party. The OKW/Armed\r\nForces Operational Staff shall inform the highest government and Party\r\nagencies of this fact. The Supreme Commander of the Army and the\r\nagencies under him shall decide on exceptions.\r\n\r\nExcept for the special regulations applying to the police organizations\r\nof the Reichsfuehrer SS, applications for entrance-permits must be\r\nsubmitted to the Supreme Commander of the Army exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Regulations regarding Rumania, Slovakia, Hungary and Finland._\r\n\r\n9. The necessary arrangements with these countries shall be made by the\r\nOKW, together with the Foreign Office, and according to the wishes of\r\nthe respective high commands. In case it should become necessary during\r\nthe course of the operations to grant special rights, applications for\r\nthis purpose are to be submitted to the OKW.\r\n\r\n10. _Police measures_ for the protection of the troops are permitted,\r\nindependently from the granting of special rights. Further orders in\r\nthis shall be issued later.\r\n\r\n11. _Special orders shall be issued at a later date_ for the\r\nterritories of these countries, on the following subjects:\r\n\r\n  Procurement of food and feed.\r\n  Housing and machinery.\r\n  Purchase and the shipment of merchandise.\r\n  Procurement of funds and wage-control.\r\n  Salaries.\r\n  Request for indemnity-payments.\r\n  Postal and telegraph services.\r\n  Traffic.\r\n  Jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n_Requests of units of the Armed Forces and agencies of the OKW_\r\nfrom the respective governments regarding these subjects, are to be\r\n_submitted_ to the OKW/Armed Forces Operational Staff/ Section Defense\r\nnot later than 27 March 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Directives regarding Sweden._\r\n\r\n12. Since Sweden _can_ only become a transient-area for troops,\r\nno special authority is to be granted the commander of the German\r\ntroops. However, he is entitled and compelled to secure the immediate\r\nprotection of RR-transports against sabotage and attacks.\r\n\r\n  The Chief of the High Command of the\r\n  Armed Forces\r\n  Signed: KEITEL\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  OKH--1st copy.\r\n  OKM--2nd copy.\r\n  R.d.L.u.O.K.L.--3rd copy.\r\n  Armed Forces Operational Staff--4th copy.\r\n  Section L--5th copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 448-PS\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.\r\n  OKW/WFST/Abt.

Beyond that, the Army group Cavallero, in\r\nconnection with later operations of the 12th Army, shall be enabled to\r\nstart an attack also from Albania.\r\n\r\nI order therefore, the following:\r\n\r\n1. A blocking unit is to be recruited by the High Command of the Army\r\nwhich will be in a position to render valuable services to our Allies\r\nin the defense of Tripolitania especially against the English armored\r\ndivisions. The principles for its composition will be given separately.\r\nThe preparations for the transfer of the unit will be made in time\r\nto follow immediately the present transport of an Italian armored\r\ndivision and a motorized division to Tripoli (starting approximately 20\r\nFebruary).\r\n\r\n2. The X Air Corps will retain Sicily as basis for operations. Its most\r\nimportant assignment will be the fight against the English Naval forces\r\nand their communications between the western and eastern Mediterranean.\r\nBesides that, provisions are also to be made, with the help of\r\ntemporary landing fields, to attack the English unloading harbors and\r\nsupply bases on the coast of Western Egypt and Cryenaica and thus give\r\nimmediate support to the Army group of Graziani.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government has been asked to declare the territory between\r\nSicily and the North African coast a \"restricted area\" [Sperrgebiet]\r\nin order to facilitate the operations of the X Air corps and to avoid\r\nincidents against neutral ships.\r\n\r\n3. For transfer to Albania, German units in the approximate strength of\r\none corps, among them the 1st Mountain Division and Armored forces, are\r\nto be provided and held in readiness. The transport of the 1st Mountain\r\nDivision is to commence, as soon as the approval of the Italians is\r\nreceived by the High Command of the Armed forces. In the meantime,\r\nit must be examined and determined with the Italian High Command in\r\nAlbania whether and how many more forces for operational attacks could\r\nbe employed to good advantage and could also be supplied besides the\r\nItalian Divisions.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the German forces will be:\r\n\r\n_a._ To serve in Albania for the time being as a reserve for an\r\nemergency case, should new crises arise there;\r\n\r\n_b._ To ease the burden of the Italian Army group when later attacking\r\nwith the aim:\r\n\r\n To tear open the Greek defense front on a decisive point for a\r\n far-reaching operation,\r\n\r\n To open up the straits west of Saloniki from the back in order to\r\n support thereby the frontal attack of List's Army.\r\n\r\n4. The directives for the questions of authority over the German troops\r\nto be employed in North Africa and Albania and the restrictions which\r\nare to be made with reference to their employment, will be settled by\r\nthe High Command of the Armed Forces and the Italian Armed Forces staff.\r\n\r\n5. The suitable transports available in the Mediterranean only as far\r\nas they are not already used for transportations to Tripoli, to be\r\nprovided for the transfer of the Albania-bound troops. For transports\r\nof personnel, the transportation group Ju 52 stationed in Foggia is to\r\nbe utilized.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to complete the transfer of the bulk of the\r\nGerman forces to Albania before the transfer of the blocking unit to\r\nLybia starts, (See 1) and the use of all German boats becomes necessary\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n  [signed] Adolf Hitler\r\n\r\n  Distribution:\r\n\r\n  OKH/Gen Staff of Army, operating--1st cy.\r\n  OKM/Skl--2nd cy.\r\n  Ob.d.L./Lw.F.St.I a--3rd cy.\r\n  OKW WFST--4th cy.\r\n  --------L--5th to 9th cy.\r\n  WNV--10th cy.\r\n  Foreign/Intelligence--11th cy.\r\n  Armed Forces, Transport Chief--12th cy.\r\n  German General with the Italian high command--13th cy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  F.H.Q. 29th Jan 41\r\n\r\n  High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  WFST/Abt.

Kdos. OKW/WFSt\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer HQ, 18 Oct. 1942\r\n  12 copies, 12th copy.\r\n\r\n1. For some time our enemies have been using in their warfare methods\r\nwhich are outside the international Geneva Conventions. Especially\r\nbrutal and treacherous is the behavior of the so-called commandos, who,\r\nas is established, are partially recruited even from freed criminals\r\nin enemy countries. From captured orders it is divulged, that they are\r\ndirected not only to shackle prisoners, but also to kill defenseless\r\nprisoners on the spot at the moment in which they believe that the\r\nlatter as prisoners represent a burden in the further pursuit of their\r\npurposes or could otherwise be a hindrance. Finally, orders have been\r\nfound in which the killing of prisoners has been demanded in principle.\r\n\r\n2. For this reason it was already announced in an addendum to the Armed\r\nForces report of 7 October 1942, that in the future, Germany, in the\r\nface of these sabotage troops of the British and their accomplices,\r\nwill resort to the same procedure, i.e., that they will be ruthlessly\r\nmowed down by the German troops in combat, wherever they may appear.\r\n\r\n3. I therefore order:\r\n\r\nFrom now on all enemies on so-called Commando missions in Europe or\r\nAfrica challenged by German troops, even if they are to all appearances\r\nsoldiers in uniform or demolition troops, whether armed or unarmed, in\r\nbattle or in flight, are to be slaughtered to the last man. It does not\r\nmake any difference whether they are landed from ships and aeroplanes\r\nfor their actions, or whether they are dropped by parachute. Even\r\nif these individuals, when found, should apparently be prepared to\r\ngive themselves up, no pardon is to be granted them on principle. In\r\neach individual case full information is to be sent to the O.K.W. for\r\npublication in the Report of the Military Forces.\r\n\r\n4. If individual members of such commandos, such as agents, saboteurs,\r\netc. fall into the hands of the military forces by some other means,\r\nthrough the police in occupied territories for instance, they are to\r\nbe handed over immediately to the SD. Any imprisonment under military\r\nguard, in PW stockades for instance, etc., is strictly prohibited, even\r\nif this is only intended for a short time.\r\n\r\n5. This order does not apply to the treatment of any enemy soldiers\r\nwho, in the course of normal hostilities (large-scale offensive\r\nactions, landing operations and airborne operations), are captured in\r\nopen battle or give themselves up. Nor does this order apply to enemy\r\nsoldiers falling into our hands after battles at sea, or enemy soldiers\r\ntrying to save their lives by parachute after battles.\r\n\r\n6. I will hold responsible under Military Law, for failing to carry out\r\nthis order, all commanders and officers who either have neglected their\r\nduty of instructing the troops about this order, or acted against this\r\norder where it was to be executed.\r\n\r\n  [signed] Adolf Hitler\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:                         Copy No.\r\n\r\n  O.K.H. / Genst.d.H (High Command of the Army /\r\n    General Staff of the Army).                   1\r\n  O.K.M. / Skl.

While the vans\r\nof the first series can also be put into action if the weather is not\r\ntoo bad, the vans of the second series (_Saurer_) _stop completely in\r\nrainy weather_. If it has rained for instance for only one half hour,\r\nthe van cannot be used because it simply skids away. It can only be\r\nused in absolutely dry weather. It is only a question now whether the\r\nvan can only be used standing at the place of execution. First the\r\nvan has to be brought to that place, which is possible only in good\r\nweather. The place of execution is usually 10-15 km away from the\r\nhighways and is difficult to access because of its location; in damp or\r\nwet weather it is not accessible at all. If the persons to be executed\r\nare driven or led to that place, then they realize immediately what is\r\ngoing on and get restless, which is to be avoided as far as possible.\r\nThere is only one way left; to load them at the collecting point and to\r\ndrive them to the spot.\r\n\r\nI ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as house-trailers\r\nby putting one set of window shutters on each side of the small van\r\nand two on each side of the larger vans, such as one often sees on\r\nfarm-houses in the country. The vans became so well-known, that not\r\nonly the authorities, but also the civilian population called the\r\nvan \"death van\", as soon as one of these vehicles appeared. It is my\r\nopinion, the van cannot be kept secret for any length of time, not even\r\ncamouflaged.\r\n\r\nThe Saurer-van which I transported from Simferopol to Taganrog suffered\r\ndamage to the brakes on the way. The Security Command [SK] in Mariupol\r\nfound the cuff of the combined oil-air brake broken at several points.\r\nBy persuading and bribing the H.K.P. [?] we managed to have a form\r\nmachined, on which the cuffs were cast. When I came to Stalino and\r\nGorlowka a few days later, the drivers of the vans complained about the\r\nsame faults. After having talked to the commandants of those commands\r\nI went once more to Mariupol to have some more cuffs made for those\r\ncars too. As agreed two cuffs will be made for each car, six cuffs\r\nwill stay in Mariupol as replacements for group D and six cuffs will\r\nbe sent to SS-Untersturmfuehrer Ernst in Kiev for the cars of group C.\r\nThe cuffs for the groups B and A could be made available from Berlin,\r\nbecause transport from Mariupol to the north would be too complicated\r\nand would take too long. Smaller damages on the cars will be repaired\r\nby experts of the commands, that is of the groups in their own shops.\r\n\r\nBecause of the rough terrain and the indescribable road and highway\r\nconditions the caulkings and rivets loosen in the course of time. I\r\nwas asked if in such cases the vans should be brought to Berlin for\r\nrepair. Transportation to Berlin would be much too expensive and would\r\ndemand too much fuel. In order to save those expenses I ordered them to\r\nhave smaller leaks soldered and if that should no longer be possible,\r\nto notify Berlin immediately by radio, that Pol. Nr.------ is out of\r\norder. Besides that I ordered that during application of gas all the\r\nmen were to be kept as far away from the vans as possible, so they\r\nshould not suffer damage to their health by the gas which eventually\r\nwould escape. I should like to take this opportunity to bring the\r\nfollowing to your attention: several commands have had the unloading\r\nafter the application of gas done by their own men. I brought to\r\nthe attention of the commanders of those S.K. concerned the immense\r\npsychological injuries and damages to their health which that work can\r\nhave for those men, even if not immediately, at least later on. The men\r\ncomplained to me about head-aches which appeared after each unloading.\r\nNevertheless they don't want to change the orders, because they are\r\nafraid prisoners called for that work, could use an opportune moment to\r\nflee. To protect the men from these damages, I request orders be issued\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThe application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In order to\r\ncome to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses the accelerator\r\nto the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to be executed suffer\r\ndeath from suffocation and not death by dozing off as was planned. My\r\ndirections now have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers\r\ndeath comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully. Distorted\r\nfaces and excretions, such as could be seen before, are no longer\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nToday I shall continue my journey to group B, where I can be reached\r\nwith further news.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. Becker\r\n  SS Untersturmfuehrer\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Reichs Security Main Office\r\n  Message Center\r\n\r\n  1900, 15 June 1942               [Handwritten:]\r\n  Riga E 2                       II D 3a Maj Pradel\r\n  Message No 152452               R 16/6\r\n  Wiederhausen\r\n\r\n  Riga 7082--15-6-42--1855--BE\r\n  To Reichs Security Main Office--Roem. 2D3A--Berlin\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: S-Vans\r\n\r\nA transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special way, arrives\r\nweekly at the office of the commandant of the Security Police and the\r\nSecurity Service of White Ruthenia.\r\n\r\nThe three S-vans, which are there, are not sufficient for that purpose.\r\nI request assignment of another S-van (5-tons).

The commandos will work independently according to\r\nspecial authorization and in consequence of the general regulations\r\ngiven to them, in the limits of the camp organizations. Naturally,\r\nthe commandos will keep close contact with the camp commander and the\r\ndefense officers assigned to him.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the commandos is the political investigating of all\r\ncamp-inmates, the elimination and further \"treatment\"\r\n\r\n _a._ of all political, criminal or in some other way undesirable\r\n elements among them.\r\n\r\n _b._ of those persons who could be used for the reconstruction of the\r\n occupied territories.\r\n\r\nFor the execution of their mission, no auxiliary means can be put\r\nat the disposal of the commandos. The \"Deutsche Fahndungsbuch\",\r\nthe \"Aufenthaltsermittlungsliste\" and the \"Sonderfahndungsbuch\r\nUdSSR\" will prove to be useful in only a small number of cases; the\r\n\"Sonderfahndungsbuch UdSSR\" is not sufficient, because it contains only\r\na small part of Soviet-Russians considered to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the commandos must use their special knowledge and ability\r\nand rely on their own findings and self-acquired knowledge. Therefore,\r\nthey will be able to start carrying out their mission only when they\r\nhave gathered together appropriate material.\r\n\r\nThe commandos must use for their work as far as possible, at present\r\nand even later, the experiences of the camp commanders which the\r\nlatter have collected meanwhile from observation of the prisoners and\r\nexaminations of camp inmates.\r\n\r\nFurther, the commandos must make efforts from the beginning to seek out\r\namong the prisoners elements which appear reliable, regardless if there\r\nare communists concerned or not, in order to use them for intelligence\r\npurposes inside of the camp and, if advisable, later in the occupied\r\nterritories also.\r\n\r\nBy use of such informers and by use of all other existing\r\npossibilities, the discovery of all elements to be eliminated among the\r\nprisoners, must succeed step by step at once. The commandos must learn\r\nfor themselves, in every case by means of short questioning of the\r\ninformers and eventual questioning of other prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe information of _one_ informer is not sufficient to designate a camp\r\ninmate to be a suspect, without further proof; it must be confirmed in\r\nsome way if possible.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the following must be discovered:\r\n\r\n All important functionaries of state and party, especially\r\n\r\n Professional revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n Functionaries of the Komintern.\r\n\r\n All policy-forming party functionaries of the KPdSU and its fellow\r\n organizations in the central committees, in the regional and district\r\n committees.\r\n\r\n All Peoples-Commissars and their deputies.\r\n\r\n All former Political commissars in the Red Army.\r\n\r\n Leading personalities of the state authorities of central and middle\r\n regions.\r\n\r\n The leading personalities of the business world.\r\n\r\n Members of the Soviet-Russian intelligence.\r\n\r\n All Jews.\r\n\r\n All persons, who are found to be agitators or fanatical communists.\r\n\r\nIt is not less important, as mentioned already, to discover all those\r\npersons who could be used for the reconstruction, administration and\r\nmanagement of the conquered Russian territories.\r\n\r\nFinally, all such persons must be secured who are still needed for the\r\ncompletion of further investigation, regardless if they are police\r\ninvestigations or other investigations, and for explanations of\r\nquestions of general interest. Among them are all those especially,\r\nwho because of their position and their knowledge are able to give\r\ninformation about measures and working methods of the Soviet-Russian\r\nState, of the communist party or of the Komintern.\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, consideration must be given to the nativity in\r\nall decisions to be made. The leader of the Einsatz Kommando will give\r\nevery week a short report by telephone or an express-letter to the\r\nReichs-Security-Main-Office, containing:\r\n\r\n1. _Short_ description of their activities in the past week.\r\n\r\n2. Number of all definitely suspicious persons. (report of number\r\nsufficient)\r\n\r\n3. Individual names of all persons found to be functionaries of the\r\nKomintern, leading functionaries of the party, Peoples-Commissars,\r\nleading personalities and Political commissars.\r\n\r\n4.

I deem it necessary to announce to the competent\r\ncommanding officers and commanders the reasons for this decree.\r\n\r\nAs in no previous war, a method of destruction of communications behind\r\nthe front, intimidation of the populace working for Germany, as well\r\nas the destruction of war-important industrial plants in territories\r\noccupied by us has been developed in this war.\r\n\r\nIn the east, this type of combat in the form of partisan warfare as\r\nearly as last winter led to severe encroachment upon our fighting\r\nstrength and cost the lives of numerous German soldiers, railroad\r\nworkers, members of the labor corps [Organization Todt], the labor\r\nservice, etc. It severely interfered with and sometimes delayed for\r\ndays, the performance of transportation necessary for the maintenance\r\nof the fighting strength of the troops. By a successful continuation\r\nor perhaps even intensification of this form of war, a grave crisis in\r\none or another place at the front might develop. Many measures against\r\nthese horrible, as well as wily, sabotage activities have failed,\r\nsimply because the German officer and his soldiers were not aware of\r\nthe great danger confronting them and therefore in individual cases\r\ndid not act against these enemy groups as would have been necessary\r\nin order to help the forward echelons of the front thereby the entire\r\nconduct of the war.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore in part necessary in the East to organize special\r\nunits who mastered this danger or to assign this task to special SS\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nOnly where the fight against this partisan disgrace was begun and\r\nexecuted with ruthless brutality were results achieved which eased the\r\nposition of the fighting front.\r\n\r\n_In all eastern territories the war against the partisans is therefore\r\na struggle of absolute annihilation of one or the other part._\r\n\r\nAs soon as the realization of this fact becomes the common knowledge of\r\ntroops, they will regularly be able to cope with these occurrences in\r\nshort order; otherwise their efforts achieve no decisive results and\r\nbecome purposeless.\r\n\r\nEven though under a different name, England and America have decided\r\nupon a similar kind of warfare, while the Russian attempts to put\r\npartisan troops behind our front by land and only in exceptional cases\r\nuses air transportation to land men and to drop supplies, England and\r\nAmerica use this method of warfare primarily by landing sabotage troops\r\nfrom submarines or pneumatic boats or by means of parachute agents.\r\nEssentially, however, this form of warfare does not differ from the\r\nactivities of the Russian partisans. For it is the task of these troops:\r\n\r\n1. to build up a general espionage service with the assistance of\r\nwilling natives,\r\n\r\n2. to organize troops of terrorists and supply them with the necessary\r\nweapons and explosives,\r\n\r\n3. to undertake sabotage activities which by destruction of traffic\r\ninstallations, not only continuously disrupt our communications, but\r\nalso, when things become serious, make troop movements absolutely\r\nimpossible and eliminate our communications system.\r\n\r\nFinally, these troops are to make attacks on war-important\r\ninstallations, in which, according to a scientifically worked out\r\nprogram, they destroy key works by dynamiting, thereby forcing whole\r\nindustries into idleness.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of these activities are of extraordinary weight. I do\r\nnot know whether each commander and officer is cognizant of the fact\r\nthat the destruction of one single electric power plant, for instance,\r\ncan deprive the Luftwaffe of many thousand tons of aluminum, thereby\r\neliminating the construction of countless aircraft that will be missed\r\nin the fight at the front and so contribute to serious damage of the\r\nHomeland as well as bloody losses of the fighting soldiers.\r\n\r\nYet this form of war is completely without danger for the adversary.\r\nSince he lands his sabotage troops in uniform but at the same time\r\nsupplies them with civilian clothes, they can, according to need,\r\nappear as soldiers or civilians. While they themselves have orders\r\nto ruthlessly remove any German soldiers or even natives who get in\r\ntheir way, they run no danger of suffering really serious losses in\r\ntheir operations, since at the worst, if they are caught, they can\r\nimmediately surrender and thus believe that they will theoretically\r\nfall under the provisions of the Geneva Convention. There is no\r\ndoubt, however, that this is a misuse in the worst form of the Geneva\r\nagreements, especially since part of these elements are even criminals,\r\nliberated from prisons, who can rehabilitate themselves through these\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nEngland and America will therefore always be able to find volunteers\r\nfor this kind of warfare, as long as they can truthfully assure them\r\nthat there is no danger of loss of life for them. At worst, all they\r\nhave to do is to successfully commit their attack on people, traffic\r\ninstallations, or other installations, and upon being encountered by\r\nthe enemy, to capitulate.\r\n\r\nIf the German conduct of war is not to suffer grievous damage through\r\nthese incidents, it must be made clear to the adversary that all\r\nsabotage troops will be exterminated, without exception, to the last\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThis means that their chance of escaping with their lives is nil. Under\r\nno circumstances can it be permitted, therefore, that a dynamite,\r\nsabotage, or terrorist unit simply allows itself to be captured,\r\nexpecting to be treated according to rules of the Geneva Convention. It\r\nmust under all circumstances be ruthlessly exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe report on this subject appearing in the Armed Forces communique\r\nwill briefly and laconically state that a sabotage, terror, or\r\ndestruction unit has been encountered and exterminated to the last man.\r\n\r\nI therefore expect the commanding officers of armies subordinated to\r\nthem as well as individual commanders not only to realize the necessity\r\nof taking such measures, but to carry out this order with all energy.\r\nOfficers and noncommissioned officers who fail through some weakness\r\nare to be reported without fail, or under circumstances--when there is\r\ndanger in delay--to be at once made strictly accountable. The Homeland\r\nas well as the fighting soldier at the front has the right to expect\r\nthat behind their back the essentials of nourishment as well as the\r\nsupply of war-important weapons and ammunition remains secure.\r\n\r\nThese are the reason for the issuance of this decree.\r\n\r\nIf it should become necessary, for reasons of interrogation, to\r\ninitially spare one man or two, then they are to be shot immediately\r\nafter interrogation.\r\n\r\n  (signed) A.

It is a British aircraft (towed glider) made of wood without\r\nengine. Of the 17 member crew 3 are dead, 6 are severely the others\r\nslightly wounded.\r\n\r\nAll wore English khaki uniforms without sleeve-insignia. Furthermore\r\nfollowing items were found: 8 knapsacks, tents, skiis and radio, exact\r\nnumber is unknown. The glider carried rifles, light machine guns, and\r\nmachine pistols, number unknown. At present the prisoners are with the\r\nbattalion in Egersund.\r\n\r\nA second plane has crashed 5 km East of Helleland. It had a 6-man crew\r\nand is supposed to have towed the above glider.\r\n\r\nThe artillery officer of Stavanger is still at the scene of the\r\nincident. Further exact report follows; new annexes attached. The\r\ncompetent commander's staff (KDS) was immediately notified on the basis\r\nof the Fuehrer order.

Therefore the sabotage purpose was absolutely\r\nproved. The 280th inf. div. ordered the execution of the action\r\naccording to the Fuehrer's order. The execution was carried out toward\r\nthe evening of Nov. 20. Some of the prisoners wore blue ski-suits under\r\ntheir khaki uniforms which had no insignia on the sleeves. During a\r\nshort interrogation the survivors have revealed nothing but their\r\nnames, ranks, and serial numbers.\r\n\r\nThe salvage of the sabotage material was performed by the commander's\r\nstaff (Kds) of Stavanger. The 2nd aircraft mentioned in the above\r\nreport is a two-engine plane and was probably the towing plane. It\r\nwill be inspected. In the same night of the 19th to 20th Nov. a second\r\nglider plane was landed at the Lysefjord, 20 km East of Stavanger, 8\r\nkm East of the electric plant of Floerly. Until now 3 men, presumably\r\nEnglish, were captured by the Norwegian police. The police are on the\r\nway to conduct a search for the plane. Supposedly dead and wounded lie\r\naround it. According to the statements of the prisoners, this freight\r\ngilder is supposed to have a 16-man crew. It is possible that this\r\nfreight glider was towed by the same enemy plane which towed the glider\r\nfound 15 km North East of Egersund. The armed forces commander of\r\nNorway was notified. Refer. at III Wi and Ag WNV/Fu, Oslo.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the shooting of the 17 members of the crew, the\r\narmed forces commander of Norway (WBN) has issued an order to the\r\ndistrict commanders, according to which the interrogations by G-2 and\r\nby BDS are important before the execution of the Fuehrer order; in case\r\nof no. 4 of the Fuehrer order the prisoners are to be handed out to the\r\nBDS.\r\n\r\nForeign agency (Ast) Norway, No. 3/304/42 III F. g.Kdos\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 509-PS\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Telegraph Office: GWNOL\r\n\r\n  Date: 7 Nov. 1943\r\n\r\n  SSD WAQC 0183 7/11 1112 DGZ\r\n\r\n To Supreme Command of the Armed Forces/Wehrmacht Fuehrungsstab/Roem I\r\n c GKDOS (TOP SECRET).\r\n\r\n  Subject: British Commando--Operation in Northwest.\r\n  Pescara, 2 Nov. 43.\r\n\r\n 3 commandos--special treatment--remaining 9 men wounded, in hospital.\r\n\r\n  OB SUED F.A.

With the large-scale landing\r\nachieved, a new situation has arisen. The order referred to directs in\r\nnumber 5 that enemy soldiers who are taken prisoner in open combat or\r\nsurrender within the limits of normal combat operations (large-scale\r\nlanding operations and undertakings) are not to be treated according\r\nto numbers 3 and 4. It must be established in a form easily understood\r\nby the troops how far the concept \"within the limits of normal combat\r\noperations, etc.\" is to be extended. The view of the Supreme Command\r\nWest is as follows:\r\n\r\nA. The commitment of air-borne troops and commandos effected in\r\nNormandy falls clearly under number 5.\r\n\r\nB. It is likewise not to be contested that paratroop units or groups\r\nset down further to the rear are connected with the large-scale landing\r\noperation effected, if they have the mission of breaking supply lines\r\nor carrying out deceptive maneuvers etc. The German combat soldier will\r\nnot always be able, during battle, to decide whether it is a question\r\nof sabotage groups parachuted down or larger air-borne operations in\r\ncloser or more distant connection with a landing from the sea already\r\ncarried out or still being carried out.\r\n\r\nC. As a result of the large turn-over of troops in the area of the\r\nSupreme Command West, especially recently, it is possible that a\r\nconsiderable number of soldiers are ignorant of the order referred to,\r\nwhich dates from more than 1-1/2 years ago. For Germans from foreign\r\ncountries (Volksdeutsche) and foreign nationalities the differentiation\r\nin the treatment of prisoners will hardly be able to be made clear due\r\nto language difficulties. A further reproduction of the order in the\r\npresent situation, where cases of losses must be considered, is held\r\nby Supreme Command West to be a false course of action. Considerable\r\nreprisals against our own prisoners must be expected if its contents\r\nbecome known.\r\n\r\nD. The application of number 5 for all enemy _soldiers in uniform_\r\npenetrating from the outside into the occupied western areas is held by\r\nSupreme Command West to be the most correct and clearest solution. On\r\nthe other hand an order of the chief office for Reich security to the\r\ncommander of the SIPO (Security Police) and the SD (Security Service)\r\nin Paris has decided that numbers 3 and 4 of the order referred to are\r\nto be applied in the future the same as before in the case of uniformed\r\nparachutists committed in groups. A conversation with representatives\r\nof the higher SS and police fuehrers in France and of the commander\r\nof the SIPO and SD in Paris gave the result that according to the\r\nopinion of all concerned the difficulty lies in the determination of\r\nthe \"limits of normal combat operations\". As a solution it was agreed\r\nto set a line (e.g. Seine from the mouth to Rouen-Argentan-Avranches)\r\nNorth of which number 5, inland of which numbers 3 and 4 apply. This\r\nsolution also must be called incomplete, since the combat situation can\r\nat any time bring the necessity of extending this line to other coastal\r\nareas as well. In case of a large-scale aerial landing in the interior\r\nsuch boundaries cannot be drawn anymore at all. _Supreme Command West\r\nrequests, therefore, that, in agreement with the Reichsfuehrer SS, the\r\ndecision be made, that, in view of the new situation, number 5 is to be\r\napplied in the whole occupied Western area._\r\n\r\n  _Position taken by Armed Forces Operational Staff:_\r\n\r\n1. The Commando order remains basically in effect even after the enemy\r\nlanding in the west.\r\n\r\n2. Number 5 of the order is to be clarified to the effect, that the\r\norder is not valid for _those_ enemy soldiers in uniform, who are\r\ncaptured in open combat in the immediate combat area of the beachhead\r\nby our troops committed there, or who surrender. Our troops committed\r\nin the immediate combat area means the divisions fighting on the front\r\nline as well as reserves up to and including corps headquarters.\r\n\r\n3. Furthermore, in doubtful cases enemy personnel who have fallen\r\ninto our hands alive are to be turned over to the SD, upon whom it is\r\nencumbent to determine whether the commando order is to be applied or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n4. Supreme Command West is to see to it that all units committed in\r\nits zone are orally acquainted in a suitable manner with the order\r\nconcerning the treatment of members of commando undertakings of 18 Oct\r\n42 along with the above explanation.\r\n\r\n  Proposal:\r\n  Attached teletype message.\r\n  signed: WARLIMONT\r\n\r\n  Distribution:\r\n\r\n Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces--1 copy through\r\n Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces Operational Staff.\r\n\r\n Ktb, 2 copies.\r\n\r\n Qu--Draft, 3 copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 532-PS\r\n\r\n  WFSt/Qu (Verw. 1)\r\n\r\n  24 June 1944\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  5 copies, 1st copy\r\n\r\n SSD--Telegram.\r\n\r\n To 1.

All members of terror and sabotage units, found outside the\r\nimmediate combat area, who include fundamentally all parachutists, are\r\nto be killed in combat. In special cases, they are to be turned over to\r\nthe SD.\r\n\r\n3. All troops committed outside the combat area of Normandy are to be\r\ninformed about the duty to destroy enemy terror and sabotage units\r\nbriefly and succinctly according to the directives issued for it.\r\n\r\n4.

In case of enemy landings by air, a difference has to be made\r\n between:\r\n\r\nA. Parachute troops and airborne landing troops committed to fighting\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nB. _Single_ parachutists and small groups of parachutists who are\r\ndropped in order to execute missions of sabotage, espionage, terror or\r\ndisruption.\r\n\r\n to _a_ The combatting of enemy airborne forces is the exclusive\r\n mission of the armed forces according to the reference orders.\r\n to _b_ For combatting _single parachutists_. In alteration of fig. 7\r\n v.a. the following is decreed:\r\n\r\n1. In territories (Reich territories and occupied territories) the\r\ncombatting of _single parachutists_ is the mission of those agencies of\r\nthe Chief of the Security Police and Security Service [SD] designated\r\nas executive; in this matter it is immaterial whether the parachutists\r\nare in uniform or civilian clothes.\r\n\r\n2. To what extent armed forces and agencies of the armed forces\r\nshould be committed for these missions is to be decided directly by\r\nthe district commanders [Wehrkreisbefehslhaber] or by territorial\r\ncommanders [territorialen Befehlshaber] endowed with the powers of\r\ndistrict commander with the competent agencies of security police and\r\nSD.\r\n\r\n3. So far as single parachutists are captured by members of the armed\r\nforces, they are to be delivered to the nearest agency of the Chief\r\nof the Security Police and SD, without delay; simultaneously reports\r\nmust be made to the competent intelligence agency. The same procedure\r\nis also valid for combat action directed against parachute troops or\r\nairborne-landing troops, in case the troops realize that they have\r\nto do with saboteurs or spies. If it should be discovered that the\r\nparachutists brought to security police by armed forces, or captured\r\ndirectly by members of the police are soldiers, the SS Reich leader and\r\nChief of the German Police will take care that they will be transferred\r\nto the competent air forces agencies after the completion of the\r\nnecessary inquiry.\r\n\r\n4. Reports concerning confirmed single parachutists are to be submitted\r\nwithout delay to the nearest agency of the Chief of Security Police and\r\nof the SD, simultaneously informing the counter intelligence agency in\r\ncharge which immediately has to forward the report to district command\r\nheadquarters commander as well as the airforces command. Moreover, in\r\nprinciple fig. 4 of the reference order is applicable.\r\n\r\n5. In territories not mentioned in fig. 1, present regulations remain\r\nvalid (transfer to secret field police).\r\n\r\n II. With regard to the use of objects captured or discarded, in the\r\n case of parachutists, as far as these items are sabotage materials, or\r\n radio equipment, a supplementary order to fig. 9 v. a. is decreed:\r\n\r\n1. Captured sabotage material to be delivered to the nearest security\r\npolice agency and SD.\r\n\r\nThe army will dispose of sabotage material captured by troops in\r\nthe Eastern theater. With regard to further utilization of sabotage\r\nmaterial delivered or reverting to the Security Police, agreements made\r\nbetween the Chief of Security Police and SD and foreign section of\r\ncounter intelligence remain valid.\r\n\r\n2. Captured radio equipment, including the directions for operations,\r\ncode-material, voice material (Sprach-Material) in plain and in code\r\ntext, are to be delivered immediately via local counter intelligence\r\nagencies to OKW (Ag WNV Fu III) for use. The agencies concerned will be\r\ninformed of results. After a completion of investigations the captured\r\nradio equipment will again be at disposal, if needed. If further use of\r\ncaptured radio equipment is considered by either counter intelligence\r\nor Security Police, then the delivery of the equipment might be\r\nomitted, upon agreement each time with Ag. WNV/Fu III, however, in this\r\ncase photostatic copies of the directions for use, the code keys, etc.,\r\nas well as technical descriptions of the equipment are to be forwarded\r\nquickly to Ag-WNV/Fu III.\r\n\r\n  The Chief of High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  KEITEL\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 556-2-PS\r\n\r\n  The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht\r\n  Fuehrer Hq September 8, 1942\r\n\r\nThe extensive coastal fortifications which I have ordered to be erected\r\nin the area of Army Group West make it necessary that in the occupied\r\nterritory all available workers should be committed and should give the\r\nfullest extent of their productive capacities. The previous allotment\r\nof domestic workers is insufficient. In order to increase it, I order\r\nthe introduction of compulsory labor and the prohibition of changing\r\nthe place of employment without permission of the authorities in the\r\noccupied territories. Furthermore the distribution of food and clothing\r\nration cards to those subject to labor draft should in the future\r\ndepend on the possession of a certificate of employment. Refusal to\r\naccept an assigned job, as well as abandoning the place of work without\r\nthe consent of the authorities in charge, will result in the withdrawal\r\nof the food and clothing ration cards.

While\r\ndoing so, very considerable difficulties arose because the members of\r\nthe armed forces who get the Jews from the ghetto daily do not want to\r\ncomply with the regulations which are issued by the man responsible for\r\nwork commitment.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that the soldiers take over the Jews in columns at\r\nthe exit of the ghetto. Actually, however, several soldiers enter\r\nthe fenced-in ghetto and pick up the Jews in question without any\r\npermission. During the last week, government inspector Rottenberger and\r\nthe undersigned were present, at an early hour, during the dispatching\r\nof the Jews. Some soldiers also did not follow the instructions of the\r\nReich German workers, entered the ghetto, and themselves got the men\r\nwho had worked so far for the units in question. It was pointed out to\r\nthem that manpower had to be committed for specially urgent measures.\r\nThese instructions were not followed by the soldiers, but they shouted\r\naround in the presence of more than 1000 Jews, and simply took the men\r\naway in spite of the order forbidding it. In one instance a soldier\r\narrived the next morning in a steel helmet and again did not follow the\r\ninstructions of the Reich-German manpower. A German police sergeant\r\nwas charged with banishing the soldiers from the ghetto. The sergeant\r\nhad hardly turned around when the soldier entered the ghetto again and\r\nagain got Jews whom he was not supposed to get, and took them away. In\r\nanother case, the undersigned was just in time to prevent a pfc. of the\r\nair force from beating a Jewish policeman. The Jewish policeman beat a\r\nJew who did not want to report for a certain work. The Jewish police is\r\ndoing well with the daily commitment of about 4000 Jews. Therefore it\r\nmust be prevented that Germans attack Jewish policemen in the presence\r\nof thousands of Jews.\r\n\r\nAs soon as German soldiers who pick up the Jewish manpower daily from\r\nthe ghetto, follow the instructions of the Reich-German manpower and,\r\nabove all, keep discipline, it will be possible to get the Jewish\r\nmanpower ready for work considerably faster every day. According to\r\nmy opinion it is at least necessary that one German policeman who can\r\nprevent the illegal seizures by the German soldiers, be placed at the\r\nentrance of the ghetto daily from 0530 to 0800 hours.\r\n\r\nFor information:\r\n\r\n  signed      Lippmann.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The District Commissar in Riga\r\n  The Chief of The Employment Office\r\n  Riga Azsargu Iela 29/31\r\n\r\n  Riga, 10 February 1942\r\n\r\n  Department\r\n  File No.\r\n\r\n To the Reich Commissar for the Baltic states\r\n\r\n Work policies and social administration\r\n\r\n _Riga_, _through_ the Commissar general in Riga.\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Transport of Jews from Kauen.\r\n  _Ref._: Your letter of 6 February 1942.\r\n\r\nThe transport of Jews from Kauen arrived here on 8 February 1942.\r\nHowever, instead of the requested 500 males only,\r\n\r\n  222 males and\r\n  137 females\r\n\r\nwere sent.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that there exists a considerable need of Jewish\r\nmanpower for transport and construction work, I am requesting an\r\nadditional 1000 Jewish males from Kauen.\r\n\r\nI was informed by the transport leader that the Jews in Kauen, as\r\nfar as their commitment for work is concerned, are not under the\r\njurisdiction of the employment office, but that the Jewish manpower is\r\ndistributed by the German police.\r\n\r\nFor:\r\n\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  (Oberregierungsrat)\r\n\r\n  [ink note:]\r\n  To the Commissar General\r\n  [Initials illegible]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Command of Economic Affairs [Wirtschaftskommando] for the Territory of\r\n the former Latvia Department of Work\r\n\r\n  Riga, 21 July 1941\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Work commitment of _Jews_.\r\n\r\n  File note\r\n\r\nAccording to the Group Agriculture there is a considerable shortage\r\nof workers for farming in Latvia, which endangers especially the beet\r\nharvest. According to my findings and also those of the economy office\r\nNorth (Wi.-In. Nord) no prisoners of war are at present available for\r\nfarming. It should be examined, therefore, to which extent and under\r\nwhich conditions other possibilities of commitment are available.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the possibility of committing Jews, a conference took place\r\ntoday between the economy office North and the chief war administration\r\nadvisor (O.K.V.R.) Ellroth, from the department of work. Together with\r\nMr. Ellroth we went to the _SS_ and conferred with the leader of the\r\n_SD_, Sturmbannfuehrer Batz, as well as his deputy, Hauptsturmfuehrer\r\nKirsten. Our proposal to earmark the Jews, to put them together in a\r\nghetto, then to establish a council for Jews, and to effect with it\r\nthe extensive commitment of Jews for work, was favorably accepted.\r\nIt was also agreed upon that the commitment of Jews for work should\r\nbe effected _only_ through the special offices for commitment to be\r\ncreated by the employment office resp. offices, in order to make\r\nsure of leadership according to the necessities for war and state\r\npolicies. The SS reserves only the right of the decision of political\r\nproblems and the execution of political tasks. The ear-marking of\r\nthe Jews and their collection in a ghetto is being done. It was\r\nfurthermore announced that conferences had already taken place\r\nbetween the SS-SD on the one hand and the military administration\r\nheadquarters (Feldkommandatur) on the other hand, with the result that\r\na registration of the Jews at the police precincts, a daily report of\r\nthe Jews there, and the establishment of a special office should be\r\ninstituted for the execution of the commitment of Jews for work through\r\nthe military administration headquarters.\r\n\r\nAfter that a conference with the war administration council\r\n[Kriegsverwaltungsrat] Nachtigall took also place at the _military\r\nadministration headquarters_, which had the same result. The military\r\nadministration headquarters (Fk.) agrees also that the commitment of\r\nJews for work is done by the employment office after the registration\r\nof the Jews. While registering, a special index card can be put aside\r\nfor this commitment of work.\r\n\r\nThe discussions at the Fk. resulted furthermore in the issuing by the\r\ncommander of the rear army district of a decree on _ceiling prices and\r\nwages_, already last Wednesday, because it is his opinion that he alone\r\ncan issue official decrees with effective penalties. Furthermore, the\r\nlocally customary prices and wages are already established.\r\n\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  O.K.V.R.\r\n\r\n  Distribution:\r\n  Wi.-In.

Those red criminals who have abused you,\r\nwell meaning, honest and decent German workers for decades, in order\r\nto deprive you and thus the entire people of its rights and heritage,\r\nor we, who amidst unutterable sacrifices and suffering, fought against\r\nthese insane and distorted ideas of devilish Jews and the associates of\r\nthe Jews? Already three months of National Socialistic government prove\r\nto you: Adolf Hitler is your friend! Adolf Hitler struggles for your\r\nliberty! Adolf Hitter gives you bread!\r\n\r\nToday we are entering into the second chapter of the National\r\nSocialistic Revolution. You may say, what else do you want, you have\r\nthe absolute power. True, we have the power, but we do not have the\r\nwhole people, we do not have you workers a hundred percent, and it is\r\nyou whom we want; we will not let you be until you stand with us in\r\ncomplete, genuine acknowledgment. You shall also be freed of the last\r\nMarxian manacles, so that you may find your way to your people.\r\n\r\nFor we know that without the German worker there is no German nation!\r\nAnd before everything else we must protect you, so that your enemy\r\nMarxism and its satellites cannot attack you from the back again.\r\n\r\nEven though the Marxist Party such as the K.P.D. has been completely\r\ndestroyed, or find themselves in complete dissolution as the S.P.D.,\r\neven if the party leaders have fled in miserable cowardice or have\r\ndeserted everything and everyone; and have forsaken you, workers,\r\ncowardly and miserably as never before, we know that it is all\r\npretense. Marxism pretends to be dead in order to resurrect itself anew\r\nwith favorable opportunity and again to plunge the Judas dagger into\r\nyour back. Just as in 1914! Even at that time it sponsored the war\r\ndebts and spread itself internationally in order to betray you to the\r\nimperialism of our enemies in 1918, and to sell you thereby to world\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe sly fox doesn't deceive us. Rather we will give him one last fatal\r\nshot so that we shall never again suffer with his resurrection. The\r\nLeiperts and Grossmaenner may pretend ever so much fidelity to Hitler,\r\nbut it is better that they should be in protective custody. Therefore\r\nwe shall strike the main weapon out of the hands of the Marxist group\r\nand thereby take from it its last possibility of renewed strengthening.\r\nThe devilish teaching of the Jew Mardochai shall be destroyed\r\nwretchedly on the battlefield of the National Socialistic Revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is not as if we wanted to disrupt and destroy the unions. On the\r\ncontrary, we have never disturbed anything which has, in any way,\r\nvalue for our people and we shall never do so in the future; that is\r\na National Socialistic rule. This certainly goes for the unions which\r\nserve with hard work and were built up by the pennies taken from the\r\nmouths of the worker. No workers--your institutions are sacred and\r\nunimpeachable to us National Socialists. I myself am a poor peasant's\r\nson and understand poverty. I myself was 7 years in one of the biggest\r\nindustries of Germany and I know the exploitation of anonymous capital,\r\nand I know, above everything else, of its stingy commercial methods,\r\nfor, on account of my opinion I was fired from my occupation in 1928.\r\n\r\nWorkers, I swear to you we will not only keep everything which exists,\r\nwe will build up the protection and rights of the worker even further,\r\nso that he can enter into the new National Socialistic State as a\r\ncompletely worthwhile and respected member of the nation.\r\n\r\nWorkers and peasants on a broad front together with the free\r\noccupations and skilled labor,--thus we shall build a new Reich of well\r\nbeing, honor and freedom. Forward with Hitler for Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 615-PS\r\n\r\n  The Bishop of Limburg      Limburg/Lahn, Aug 13, 1941\r\n  To the Reich Minister of Justice _Berlin_\r\n\r\n  [Various stamps and pencilled remarks appear on original]\r\n\r\nRegarding the report submitted on July 16 (Sub IV, pp 6-7) by the\r\nChairman of the Fulda Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Dr. Bertram, I\r\nconsider it my duty to present the following as a concrete illustration\r\nof destruction of so-called \"useless life.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 8 kilometers from Limburg, in the little town of Hadamar, on\r\na hill overlooking the town, there is an institution which had\r\nformerly served various purposes and of late had been used as a\r\nnursing home; this institution was renovated and furnished as a place\r\nin which, by consensus of opinion, the above mentioned euthanasia\r\nhas been systematically practiced for months--approximately since\r\nFebruary 1941. The fact has become known beyond the administrative\r\ndistrict of Wiesbaden, because death certificates from a Registry\r\nHadamar-Moenchberg are sent to the home communities. (Moenchberg is the\r\nname of this institution because it was a Franciscan monastery prior to\r\nits secularization in 1803.)\r\n\r\nSeveral times a week buses arrive in Hadamar with a considerable number\r\nof such victims. School children of the vicinity know this vehicle\r\nand say: \"There comes the murder-box again.\" After the arrival of\r\nthe vehicle, the citizens of Hadamar watch the smoke rise out of the\r\nchimney and are tortured with the ever-present thought of the miserable\r\nvictims, especially when repulsive odors annoy them, depending on the\r\ndirection of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the principles at work here are: Children call each\r\nother names and say, \"You're crazy; you'll be sent to the baking oven\r\nin Hadamar.\" Those who do not want to marry, or find no opportunity,\r\nsay, \"Marry, never! Bring children into the world so they can be put\r\ninto the bottling machine!\" You hear old folks say, \"Don't send me to\r\na state hospital! After the feeble-minded have been finished off, the\r\nnext useless eaters whose turn will come are the old people.\"\r\n\r\nAll God-fearing men consider this destruction of helpless beings as\r\ncrass injustice. And if anybody says that Germany cannot win the war,\r\nif there is yet a just God, these expressions are not the result of a\r\nlack of love of fatherland but of a deep concern for our people. The\r\npopulation cannot grasp that systematic actions are carried out which\r\nin accordance with Par. 211 of the German criminal code are punishable\r\nwith death! High authority as a moral concept has suffered a severe\r\nshock as a result of these happenings. The official notice that N.N.\r\nhad died of a contagious disease and that for that reason his body has\r\nto be burned, no longer finds credence, and such official notices which\r\nare no longer believed have further undermined the ethical value of the\r\nconcept of authority.\r\n\r\nOfficials of the Secret State Police, it is said, are trying to\r\nsuppress discussion of the Hadamar occurrences by means of severe\r\nthreats. In the interest of public peace, this may be well intended.\r\nBut the knowledge and the conviction and the indignation of the\r\npopulation cannot be changed by it; the conviction will be increased\r\nwith the bitter realization that discussion is prohibited with threats\r\nbut that the actions themselves are not prosecuted under penal law.\r\n\r\nFacta loquuntur.\r\n\r\nI beg you most humbly, Herr Reich Minister, in the sense of the\r\nreport of the Episcopate of July 16 of this year, to prevent further\r\ntransgressions of the Fifth Commandment of God.\r\n\r\n  [Signed] Dr. Hilfrich\r\n\r\nI am submitting copies of this letter to the Reich Minister of the\r\nInterior and the Reich Minister for Church Affairs.\r\n\r\n  [initialled by the above]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 621-PS\r\n\r\n The Reichsminister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery\r\n\r\n  Berlin, W.8, 2 October 1940\r\n  Voss Street 6\r\n\r\n  SECRET REICH MATTER\r\n\r\n  _Rk. 665 B gRs_\r\n  To the Reichsminister of Justice, Dr. Guertner\r\n\r\n  Dear Dr. Guertner:\r\n\r\nI herewith acknowledge your letters of 26 August and 25 September\r\nforwarding to me further material about the death of inmates of nursing\r\nhomes.

The Reich Marshall is looking for daring fellows, who will be\r\nemployed in the East as Sonderkommandos [Special Purpose] and who will\r\nbe able to carry out the task of creating confusion behind the lines.\r\nThey are to be formed into bands under leadership and with interpreters\r\nallotted to them. For this purpose, the Reich Marshall is considering\r\nconvicts who are first offenders, who have committed not particularly\r\nheinous offenses, for which there is human understanding.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall first of all mentioned persons convicted of\r\npoaching. He knew, of course, that the Reichsfuehrer SS had picked out\r\nthe so-called poachers and they were already in his hands. He requests,\r\nhowever, that the question be reexamined. The only suitable men are\r\nthose with a passion for hunting, who have poached for love of the\r\ntrophy, not men who have laid snares and traps. The Reich Marshall\r\nalso mentioned fanatical members of smuggling gangs, who take part in\r\ngun-battles on the frontiers and whose passion it is to outwit the\r\ncustoms at the risk of their own lives, but not men who attempt to\r\nbring articles over the frontier in an express train or by similar\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall leaves it to us to consider whether still other\r\ncategories of convicts can be assigned to these bands or pursuit\r\ncommandos.\r\n\r\nIn the regions assigned for their operations, these bands, whose first\r\ntask should be to destroy the communications of the partisan groups,\r\ncould murder, burn and ravish; in Germany they would once again come\r\nunder strict supervision. * * *\r\n\r\n  (signed) Dr. Joel, 24.9.42\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 6 October 1942\r\n\r\n  Staff of MD IV, V\r\n\r\nThe attached extract from the minutes of Cabinet Councillor Dr. Joel\r\nare submitted for the preparation of the report on Friday 9.10.\r\n\r\nCopy to State Secretary Dr. Rothenberger for his attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 641-PS\r\n\r\n  File No. 927/33 Munich, 1 June 1933\r\n  District Attorney at the District Court Munich II\r\n  (Tel: Local 5791, Long Distance 57801)\r\n\r\n  to the\r\n\r\n  Public Prosecutor \"Generalstaatsanwalt\"\r\n\r\n  at the\r\n\r\n  State Supreme Court MUNICH\r\n\r\n Subject: Death of the prisoner in protective custody Dr. Alfred\r\n Strauss in the concentration camp Dachau\r\n\r\n N-12432 in one copy submitted to the State Ministry of Justice Munich,\r\n 2 June 1933\r\n\r\n  The Public Prosecutor at the State Supreme Court\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1933 the 30 year old, single attorney at law Dr. Alfred\r\nStrauss from Munich who was in the concentration camp Dachau as a\r\nprisoner under protective custody was killed by 2 pistol shots by SS\r\nman Johann Kantschuster who escorted him on a walk prescribed to him by\r\nthe camp doctor, outside of the fenced part of the camp.\r\n\r\nKantschuster gives the following report: He himself had to urinate;\r\nStrauss proceeded on his way. Suddenly Strauss broke away towards the\r\nshrub located at a distance of about 6 m from the line. When he noticed\r\nit, he fired 2 shots at the fugitive from a distance of about 8 m,\r\nwhereupon Strauss collapsed dead.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, May 24, 1933, a judicial inspection of the locality\r\ntook place. The corpse of Strauss was lying at the edge of the wood.\r\nLeather slippers were on his feet. He wore a sock on one foot, while\r\nthe other foot was bare, obviously because of an injury to this foot.\r\nSubsequently an autopsy was performed. Two bullets had entered the\r\nback of the head. Besides the body showed several black and blue spots\r\nand also open wounds. Coroner's inquest was ordered; it took place on\r\n26 May 1933. According to the expert's opinion death was caused by\r\ncerebral paralysis due to one bullet penetrating and one bullet lodging\r\nin the right portion of the cerebrum. Older scars were found at the\r\nright hip and seat, as well as hemorrhages of the left abdominal wall.\r\nThe direction of the firing channels further revealed that the bullets\r\nhad been fired from low behind and upwards to the right. The distance\r\nfrom which they were fired could not be established by the autopsy; for\r\nthis purpose chemical and microscopical examinations are necessary.\r\n\r\nI have charged Kantschuster today with murder and have made\r\napplication for opening and execution of the judicial preliminary\r\ninvestigation as well as for a warrant of arrest against him.\r\n\r\n  The District Court Public Prosecutor Attorney\r\n  WINTERSBERGER\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 642-PS\r\n\r\n  File No: G 866/33      Munich, 1 June 1933\r\n  State Prosecution at the\r\n  State Court [Landgericht] Munich\r\n  Local Telephone: 5791 Long Distance: 57801.\r\n\r\n To the Prosecutor General at The Supreme State Court\r\n [Oberlandesgericht] Munich.\r\n\r\n Subject: Decease of the arrestee in protective custody, Leonhard\r\n Hausmann in the Dachau concentration camp.\r\n\r\n No. 12431 with one copy submitted to the State Minister for Justice,\r\n Munich, 2 June 1933\r\n\r\n The Prosecutor General at the Supreme State Court.\r\n\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n\r\nOn 17 May 1933, Leonhard Hausmann from Augsburg, 31 years old,\r\nmarried, relief worker, who was kept in protective custody in the\r\nDachau concentration camp, was shot by SS staff sergeant Karl Ehmann.\r\nAccording to the account of the latter, Hausmann was to dig out young\r\nfir trees in the woods in the vicinity of the camp and pile them up\r\non a certain spot. He was supervised by Ehmann. Suddenly the latter\r\ndid not see him anymore. Therefore Ehmann looked after the prisoners\r\nand saw him running away in a stooped position, Ehmann ran after him,\r\ncalled \"Halt\" several times, once also \"Stop\", but in vain. Whereupon\r\nEhmann raised his pistol at the prisoner and fired without aiming;\r\nHausmann dropped dead. Ehmann asserts that he fired from a distance of\r\n10 to 12 meters.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was inspected already on 17 May 33 with the assistance of\r\nthe state court physician. It was found that death was due to a shot\r\nthrough the left side of the chest. According to the autopsy protocol,\r\nthe shot was fired from a distance less than 1 meter. Meanwhile the\r\nlegal-medical institute ascertained that the distance was less than 30\r\ncm.\r\n\r\nToday I have preferred public charges against Ehmann and have requested\r\nto begin and to carry out a preliminary court investigation and to\r\nissue an arrest warrant against him for danger of escape and of\r\nprejudicing the course of justice.\r\n\r\nI shall report about the course of the process.\r\n\r\n  The Supreme State Prosecutor\r\n  [signed] Wintersberger\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 644-PS\r\n\r\n  File No. G 851/33      Munich, 22 May 1933\r\n  (Postoffice 35)\r\n  Prosecution at the State Court Munich II\r\n  (Telephone: Local 5791\r\n  long distance 57801)\r\n\r\n  To the Prosecutor General of the State Court\r\n  [Oberlandesgericht]\r\n\r\n  Munich,\r\n\r\n Subject: Decease of the arrestee in protective custody Louis Schloss\r\n in the Dachau concentration camp.\r\n\r\n  _Annexes_:\r\n\r\n  1 copy of an autopsy protocol,\r\n  3 photos.\r\n  W.V. 28923/33\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of 16 May 1933 the police station Dachau informed the\r\nstate prosecution that an inmate of the concentration camp Dachau, the\r\nmerchant Louis Schloss, from Nurnberg, widowed, born on 21 June 1880,\r\nhas hanged himself in solitary confinement.

An inquest on the dead body of the prisoner\r\nNefzger, Sebastian, merchant in Munich, Schommerstrasse 17/0, born:\r\n1/10/1900 in Munich, religion Catholic, marital status: married--showed\r\nthat death through the action of third persons must be excluded. Death\r\nwas indubitably caused by excessive bleeding resulting from an opened\r\nartery of the left hand. Signed Dr. Nuernbergk, Camp Physician.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the lower court Dachau nor the state attorney Munich II had up\r\nto that time been informed of Nefzger's death reported in the letter\r\nin spite of the fact that Nefzger had already died in the night of\r\nthe 25 to the 26th of May 1933. The lower court Dachau informed the\r\nstate attorney, Munich II of this letter. A coroner's inquest was\r\nordered, which took place as late as May 27, 1933. Since the physician\r\nappointed by the superior court doubted that death had occurred due\r\nto excessive bleeding and identified marks of strings on the victim's\r\nneck, a judicial autopsy was arranged by the State Attorney on May 29,\r\n1933. The resulting opinion of the expert is so far: I. the autopsy\r\ndiscloses that excessive bleeding due to a cut on the left arm must be\r\nexcluded as a cause of death; II. the cut on the left wrist reveals\r\nthree incisions of the bone. Trial cuts are lacking. These findings\r\nare contrary to the assumption that the wound has been self-inflicted;\r\nIII. It must be assumed that the cause of death was suffocation. As a\r\ncause for suffocation, strangulation and throttling must be considered.\r\nThe characteristics of the marks left by the strings do not agree with\r\nthose otherwise observed in cases of death caused by hanging.\r\n\r\n6 photos were made of the corpse before the autopsy; one print is\r\nenclosed of each.\r\n\r\nI have issued a public indictment, on the basis of murder, of the\r\nunknown perpetrators, and of camp commander Waeckerly, camp physician\r\nDr. Nuernbergk, and chief secretary of the office Mutzbauer for having\r\naided in the crime; and I have ordered the opening and execution of\r\npreliminary court proceedings, as well as the issuance of an arrest\r\nwarrant for the said accused.\r\n\r\nI shall make reports about the developments of the process.\r\n\r\n  The Chief State Attorney\r\n  Wintersberger\r\n\r\n_Deaths of the prisoners in protective custody_:\r\n\r\n _Schloss, Louis_, merchant from Nurnberg (found hung on 5/16/1933).\r\n\r\n _Hausmann, Leonhard_, unskilled worker from Augsburg, (shot by\r\n Scharfuehrer _Karl Ehmann_ on 5/17/33).\r\n\r\n _Dr. Strauss, Alfred_, lawyer from Munich, (shot on 5/24/33).\r\n\r\n _Kantschuster, Johann_, SS man for murder.\r\n\r\n _Nefzger, Sebastian_, merchant from Munich, (died 5/25 to 5/26/33).\r\n\r\nIndictment of _unknown_ perpetrators for murder and of _Waeckerle_,\r\ncamp commander; Dr. _Nuernbergk_, camp physician; _Mutzbauer_, chief\r\nsecretary of the office, for aiding in the crime.\r\n\r\n _Lehrburger, Karl_, merchant from Nurnberg, (shot on 5/25/33) by SS\r\n man _Hans Steinbrenner_.\r\n\r\n Z.d.A.: \"Important Occurrences in the Concentration Camp Dachau.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 647-PS\r\n\r\n (100 [crossed out, on top of it] \"ten\" [in pencil] photo copies copy\r\n [in ink])\r\n\r\n  Control number\r\n  _Enclosure to number 1164/38 top secret WFA/L II_\r\n\r\nDraft of June 3rd with changes Reichsfuehrer SS of June 10, 1938 and\r\nadditions concerning signal corps unit.\r\n\r\n  [in ink]      1st Copy      3 copies      1st copy\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  The Fuehrer and Reich's Chancellor.      Berlin, 17 August 1938\r\n\r\n  [in ink]\r\n\r\n  10\r\n\r\n  [Signature illegible]\r\n\r\nBy means of the nomination of the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the\r\nGerman police in the ministry of the interior on June 17th 1936\r\n(Reichsgesetzblatt I, page 487), I have created the basis for the\r\nunification and reorganization of the German police.\r\n\r\nWith this step, the Schutzstaffeln of the NSDAP which were under the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police even up to now, have\r\nentered into close connection with the duties of the German police.\r\n\r\nIn order to regulate these tasks and in order to delineate the common\r\ntasks of the SS and of the Wehrmacht, I hereby order the following\r\ninclusively and basically:\r\n\r\n  [the above written in pencil]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. General\r\n\r\n1. Being a political organization of the NSDAP, the SS as such does not\r\nneed any military set-up and training for its political obligations. It\r\ncarries no weapons.\r\n\r\n2. For special inner-political tasks for the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nchief of the German police, tasks which I might have to assign to\r\nhim from time to time, or for the mobile use within the wartime army\r\n(SS-Verfuegungstruppe). The following SS units which either already\r\nexist, or will be set up in case of mobilization, are exempted from the\r\nregulations of number 1:\r\n\r\n  The SS-Verfuegungstruppe.\r\n  The SS-Junkerschulen.\r\n  The SS-Totenkopfverbaende.\r\n  The SS-reinforcement Totenkopfverbaende (police reinforcement).\r\n\r\nIn peacetime they are under the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the\r\nGerman police, who, with the exception mentioned in paragraph II,\r\n_alone_ has the responsibility for the organization, training, arming,\r\nand full use in regard to inner-political tasks given him from me.\r\n\r\nIn peacetime, no organizational connection with the Wehrmacht exists in\r\nthis regard. (See orders in II and III for the case of mobilization.)\r\n\r\nArms, ammunition, tools, equipment, and military handbooks for the\r\narmed SS units will be procured through the Wehrmacht, upon payment.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The armed units of the SS\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _The SS-Verfuegungstruppe_\r\n\r\n1. The SS Verfuegungstruppe is neither a part of the Wehrmacht nor a\r\npart of the police. It is a standing armed unit, exclusively at my\r\ndisposal. As such, and as a unit of the NSDAP its members are to be\r\nselected by the Reichsfuehrer SS according to the ideological and\r\npolitical standards which I have ordered for the NSDAP and for the\r\nSchutzstaffeln. Its members are to be trained and its ranks filled\r\nwith volunteers from those who are subject to serve in the army who\r\nhave finished their duties in the obligatory labor service. The\r\nservice period for volunteers is 4 years. It may be prolonged for\r\nSS-Unterfuehrer. Special regulations are in force for SS leaders. The\r\nregular compulsory military service (par. 8 of the law relating to\r\nmilitary service) is fulfilled by service of the same amount of time in\r\nthe SS Verfuegungstruppe.\r\n\r\nThe SS Verfuegungstruppe receives its financial resources through the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. Its budget requires a check-up by the high\r\ncommand of the Wehrmacht.\r\n\r\n2. The SS Verfuegungstruppe falls into the following parts:\r\n\r\n  1 headquarters staff.\r\n  (Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler) motorized [in ink].\r\n\r\n  3 regiments\r\n  2 motorcycle battalions under a Standarte Staff.\r\n  1 engineer battalion motorized [in ink].\r\n  1 signal battalion motorized [in ink].\r\n  1 medical unit.\r\n\r\nThe complete strength, the organization, the arming, and the equipment\r\nof the SS Verfuegungstruppe depend on the task allocated in peace time\r\nand in case of mobilization.\r\n\r\nIn case of mobilization, the Standarten and independent Sturmbanne\r\nare organized like the corresponding units of an infantry division\r\nrespectively of a motorized infantry division of the army [illegible\r\nremark in ink].\r\n\r\nThe engineer unit is fully motorized.\r\n\r\nThe signal unit (motorized) is organized like an infantry division\r\nsignal unit (motorized).\r\n\r\nThe peacetime strength and equipment of the army are the pattern\r\nfor the strength and equipment of the staffs and units of the SS\r\nVerfuegungstruppe. Personnel and material necessary above the peacetime\r\nstrength and the table of equipment will be determined in cooperation\r\nwith the high command of the Wehrmacht and the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nchief of the German police.\r\n\r\nFor use in the interior, the Standarten are reinforced by the following\r\nspecial formation:\r\n\r\n  (Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler)\r\n\r\n  reinforced by:\r\n\r\n  1 armored reconnaissance platoon.\r\n  [Panzerspaehzug; the word \"zug\" is added in ink].\r\n  1 motorcycle platoon.\r\n  1 motorized engineer platoon.\r\n\r\n  _the other Standarten_\r\n\r\n  by:\r\n  _each_\r\n  1 armored reconnaissance platoon.\r\n  1 light infantry motorcycle platoon.\r\n\r\nand by additional telephone and radio units for the signal platoons.\r\n\r\n  _the non-motorized units_\r\n\r\n  by:\r\n  1 trucking platoon each.\r\n\r\nThe signal unit (motorized) with additional means of communication in\r\norder to safeguard the communication system of the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nchief of the German police. The necessary personnel and material will\r\nbe determined in cooperation with the high command of the Wehrmacht\r\nand the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police.\r\n\r\nThe final aim is the complete mobilization of all Standarten and\r\nindependent units; in the case of mobilization, the skeleton\r\ncorps of the reinforcement units of the SS Totenkopfverbaende, to\r\nwhom in peacetime the short training of replacements for the SS\r\nTotenkopfverbaende was entrusted, are to be devoted to the task of\r\ninsuring replacements for the SS Verfuegungstruppe (see C 2).\r\n\r\nThe supreme commander of the army prepares the SS Verfuegungstruppe\r\nfor their use within the wartime army. He issues the necessary orders,\r\nregulates their working with reserve army authorities, supports the\r\ntraining and makes inspections. He is authorized to transfer these\r\npowers to lower echelon offices and to report to me about the state of\r\ncombat training, after prior consultation with the Reichsfuehrer SS and\r\nchief of the German police.\r\n\r\nA timely exchange of officers, respectively leaders between the army\r\nand the SS Verfuegungstruppe is to be carried out in mutual agreement\r\nas soon as the officer situation permits it.\r\n\r\nAny changes in the organization, the strength and the arming of the SS\r\nVerfuegungstruppe have to be approved by me.\r\n\r\n3. _Orders for the case of mobilization._\r\n\r\nA. The employment of the SS Verfuegungstruppe in case of mobilization\r\nis a double one:\r\n\r\n1. By the supreme commander of the army within the wartime army. In\r\nthat case, it comes completely under military laws and regulation, but\r\nremains a unit of the NSDAP politically.\r\n\r\n2. In case of necessity in the interior according to my orders. In that\r\ncase, it is under the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police.\r\n\r\nIn case of mobilization, I myself will make the decision about\r\nthe time, strength and manner of the incorporation of the SS\r\nVerfuegungstruppe into the wartime army; these things will depend on\r\nthe inner political situation at that time.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the skeleton corps of the reinforcement units of\r\nthe SS Totenkopfverbaende, to whom in peacetime the short training\r\nof replacements for the SS Totenkopfverbaende was entrusted, are to\r\nbe devoted to the task of insuring a reserve which should meet the\r\nideologic and political spirit of the Verfuegungstruppe.\r\n\r\nIn case of mobilization, all members of the SS who did their compulsory\r\nmilitary duty in the SS Verfuegungstruppe are generally to be used\r\nto reinforce the SS Verfuegungstruppe. Older classes of the SS\r\nVerfuengungstruppe also may be used to fill up the ranks of the\r\nreinforcement of the SS Totenkopfverbaende police reinforcement which\r\nwill be set-up in case of mobilization in so far as they are not needed\r\nas replacements for the SS Verfuengungstruppe.\r\n\r\nIn case of mobilization, the replacements for the SS Verfuegungstruppe\r\nalso may be used to fill up the ranks of young, untrained draftees.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _The SS Junker Schools._\r\n\r\n1. The SS Junker schools including the SS medical Junker school educate\r\nthe officer replacements for the armed parts of the SS and for the\r\nGerman police.\r\n\r\n2. The Junkers who have served at least one year of front line duty in\r\nthe SS Verfuegungstruppe and have completed the SS Junker schools and\r\nsubsequently the non-commissioned officer school successfully, and who\r\nhave accordingly served more than two years under arms (see par. 8 of\r\nthe military law), have fulfilled their compulsory military duty.\r\n\r\nLeaders and leader aspirants who have successfully finished the\r\nnon-commissioned officer school in service that is incorporated into\r\nthe Wehrmacht, will be given a rank which corresponds to their rank, in\r\nthe armed parts of the SS, or in the police.\r\n\r\n3. The budgets of the SS Verfuegungstruppe, the SS Totenkopfverbaende,\r\nand the German police will bear the partial costs of the schools for\r\nthat number of Junkers which corresponds to their calculated need for\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n4. These orders about the SS Junker schools are in force retroactive to\r\nMarch 15, 1935.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _The SS Totenkopfverbaende._\r\n\r\n1. The SS Totenkopfverbaende are neither a part of the army nor of the\r\npolice. They are a standing armed unit of the SS to clear up special\r\ntasks of police nature. I reserve the right to assign duties from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nAs such, as a unit of the NSDAP, they are to be selected and trained\r\naccording to the ideological and political directives which I have\r\nissued for the NSDAP and for the Schutzstaffeln; they are to be\r\nreplaced by the use of volunteers _capable of serving the SS_, who as a\r\nrule have served their compulsory military duty in the army. The army\r\nmust give its agreement for special cases of exception. These units\r\nare under the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police who is\r\nresponsible to me for their organization, training, arming, and full\r\nreadiness for action.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police is entitled to\r\nrecruit suitable volunteers of the army before their discharge in\r\ncooperation with the supreme command of the army.\r\n\r\nThe service period for non-commissioned officers and men is 12 years.\r\nService time in the army is to be counted. The necessary question of\r\nthe pension will be taken up at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe SS Totenkopfverbaende receive their financial means through the\r\nministry of the Interior.\r\n\r\nStarting April 1st, 1938, the SS Totenkopfverbaende are organized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nDirectorate staff with signal unit,\r\n\r\n 4 Standarten with 3 Sturmbanne each with 3 infantry companies (each\r\n 148 men strong).\r\n\r\n 1 machine gun company (150 men strong).\r\n\r\n 1 medical unit.\r\n\r\n 1 medical group necessary for the medical care of those camp prisoners\r\n who work outside.\r\n\r\nBesides, each Standarte:\r\n\r\n 1 motorcycle group (crossed out).\r\n\r\n 1 group with weapons suited for street fights to be set up in 1939\r\n (crossed out).\r\n\r\n 1 trucking unit.\r\n\r\n 1 Signal platoon.\r\n\r\n Besides 1 signal platoon for each Sturmbann to be set up in 1939\r\n (crossed out).\r\n\r\n2. Replacement units for the short time training for the reinforcement\r\nof the SS Totenkopfverbaende (police reinforcement). Strength\r\ncorresponding to the reinforcement battalion of the army. All units of\r\nthe SS Totenkopferbaende are to be motorized temporarily with 3-ton\r\nOpel-Blitz cars.\r\n\r\n3. The strength and organization of the units will be determined by the\r\nextent of their special tasks of police nature (see fig. 1) and will\r\nbe determined by me according to requirements upon suggestions of the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police.\r\n\r\n4. The armament and equipment of the SS Totenkopfverbaende depends on\r\ntheir special tasks (see fig. 1); both are to be suggested to me by the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police, after he has discussed\r\nthem with the supreme command of the army.\r\n\r\n5. _Regulations for the case of the mobilization._\r\n\r\nThe SS Totenkopfverbaende form the skeleton corps for the reinforcement\r\nof the SS Totenkopfverbaende (police reinforcement) and will be\r\nreplaced in the guarding of the concentration camps by members of the\r\nGeneral SS who are over 45 years of age and had military training.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton corps which, up to now, were units of the two replacement\r\nunits for the short time training of the reinforcement of the SS\r\nTotenkopfverbaende will be transferred to the SS Verfuegungstruppe as\r\nskeleton crews of the replacement units for that unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Reinforcement of the SS Totenkopfverbaende (police reinforcement).\r\n\r\n1. The reinforcement of the SS Totenkopfverbaende is a police\r\nunit which will be set up and armed automatically in the case of\r\nmobilization, in an emergency, at my command.\r\n\r\n2. The Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police will decide its\r\nstrength within the total strength of all police units which I shall\r\ndetermine for the territory of the Reich.\r\n\r\n3. The organization, distribution of units, armament, and training of\r\nthe reinforcement of the SS Totenkopfverbaende depend entirely on the\r\npolice tasks they will have to handle.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the full readiness for action in that respect\r\nrests with the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police who\r\nwill have to make suitable suggestions to me concerning armament and\r\nequipment, after prior consultation with the supreme command of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n4. The training of the reinforcements of the SS Totenkopfverbaende who\r\nare provided for the use of war and are between 25 and 35 years of age\r\nwill be undertaken in peacetime by the replacement units of the SS\r\nTotenkopfverbaende (compare with C 2).\r\n\r\n5. The ministry of the interior will request the financial resources\r\nfor the training of the reinforcement of the SS Totenkopfverbaende from\r\nthe supreme command of the army, as R.V. special resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The General SS (Allgemeine SS)\r\n\r\nAll other members, not mentioned in I or II of the general SS\r\n(Allgemeine SS) which is unarmed, are at the disposal of the army in\r\ncase of war (according to the regulations of the military law).\r\n\r\nHowever, considering the special inner-political tasks which the SS\r\nhas to solve in close connection with the German police in case of\r\nmobilization, I hereby order the following:\r\n\r\n1. The staff of the Reichsfuehrer SS, the staffs of the three main\r\noffices (SS, Sd, and RuS main officer, the SS Oberabschnittsstaebe and\r\nSS Abschnittstaebe) remain in case of war for tasks of police nature.\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS regulates their strength which will be cut down to\r\na minimum size for that purpose, SS members provided for those staffs\r\nare to be deferred from service in the army in case of war.\r\n\r\n2. All clothing and equipment, motor cars, arms, ammunition and other\r\nequipment owned by the SS are regulated by the legal orders in case of\r\nmobilization; this, provided they are not necessary for the setting up\r\nof the armed SS units and staffs mentioned under I and II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Decrees of execution\r\n\r\nThe supreme command of the army issues the decrees of execution\r\nnecessary to paragraph II in all questions concerning the army and the\r\ncase of mobilization in cooperation with the Reichsfuehrer SS and chief\r\nof the German police.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of the German police issues the decrees\r\nof execution concerning the police and inner political measures in\r\ncooperation with the supreme command of the army.\r\n\r\n  /s/      Hitler\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 651-PS\r\n\r\n  Reich Minister of Justice\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 8, Wilhelmstrasse 65 31 January 1938\r\n\r\n  Telephone: 110044\r\n\r\n  _4611--I a [7=] 194/38_\r\n  To the Presidents of the High Courts.\r\n\r\n Subject: Representation by Counsel of Inmates of Concentration Camps.\r\n\r\n  VERY CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\nIn preparing a decision of Reich Fuehrer SS and Chief of German Police\r\nwhether individual attorneys can be allowed in general to take over\r\nthe representation of inmates in Concentration Camps, I ask you to\r\nscrutinize at once if and what attorneys in your district could be\r\nconsidered for this purpose. Representation of inmates of Concentration\r\nCamps requires a special measure of suitability and dependability.\r\nSevere scrutiny is to be exercised in making the selection. Membership\r\nin the NSDAP, in so far as it was not acquired until after January 30,\r\n1933, will not of itself warrant the necessary dependability as a rule;\r\non the other hand this prerequisite is not to be denied because the\r\nattorney is not a member of the Party. Consideration can only be given\r\nattorneys whose attitude leaves no doubt that their views coincide\r\nwholly with the political aspirations of the State and the ideology\r\naims of the movement. Moreover, it can be assumed that attorneys\r\nwhose field of activity does not extend to taking over the defense in\r\ncriminal affairs, will as a rule not accept representation of inmates\r\nof Concentration Camps.\r\n\r\nAttorneys suitable for representation of inmates of Concentration\r\nCamps who should, if possible, reside in different localities of your\r\ndistrict, should be listed in sufficient number according to Offices of\r\nthe State Police. With reference to the necessity of very confidential\r\ntreatment, I beg therefore to consult as an expert the president of\r\nthe Chamber of Counsel about their qualifications. A consultation of\r\noffices not within the Administration of Justice is to be avoided.\r\nI ask that two copies of the list be presented after receiving the\r\nadvice of the President of the Chamber of Counsel. With regard to the\r\nattorneys names, proof of personal and professional qualification\r\nis to be submitted. Besides stating the attorney's characteristic\r\nand political attitude and especially his manner of practicing his\r\nprofession as defense counsel in penal matters, it is also to be\r\ninvestigated, if possible, if reason exists to assume that the attorney\r\nhas the confidence of the Office of State Police.\r\n\r\nAn eventual notice of non-compliance is required.\r\n\r\n  Deputy,\r\n  sig.

Schlichting\r\n  Secretary of the Office of the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 654-PS\r\n\r\n  U I _b_\r\n\r\nDiscussion with Reich Fuehrer of SS Himmler on 18.9.42 in his Field\r\nHeadquarters in the presence of State Secretary Dr. Rothenberger, SS\r\nGruppenfuehrer Streckenbach and SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Bender.\r\n\r\n1. Correction [2 illegible pencilled words] by special treatment at\r\nthe hands of the police in cases where judicial sentences are not\r\nsevere enough. On the suggestion of Reichsleiter Bormann, the following\r\nagreement was reached between the Reich Fuehrer of SS and myself:\r\n\r\n_a._ In principle the Fuehrer's time is no longer to be burdened with\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Reich Minister for Justice will decide whether and when\r\nspecial treatment at the hands of the police is to be applied.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Reich Fuehrer of SS will send the reports, which he sent\r\nhitherto to Reichsleiter Bormann, to the Reich Minister for Justice.\r\n\r\n_d._ If the views of the Reich Fuehrer of SS and those of the Reich\r\nMinister for Justice agree, the final decision on the case will rest\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n_e._ If their views are not in agreement, the opinion of Reichsleiter\r\nBormann will be brought to bear on the case, and he will possibly\r\ninform the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n_f._ In cases where the Fuehrer's decision on a mild sentence is\r\nsought through other channels (such as by a letter from a Gauleiter)\r\nReichsleiter Bormann will forward the report to the Reich Minister for\r\nJustice. The case will then be decided as already described by the\r\nReich Fuehrer of SS and the Reich Minister for Justice.\r\n\r\n2. The delivery of anti-social elements from the execution of their\r\nsentence to the Reich Fuehrer of SS to be worked to death. Persons\r\nunder protective arrest, Jews, Gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians, Poles\r\nwith more than 3-year sentences, Czechs and Germans with more than\r\n8-year sentences, according to the decision of the Reich Minister for\r\nJustice. First of all the worst anti-social elements amongst those just\r\nmentioned are to be handed over. I shall inform the Fuehrer of this\r\nthrough Reichsleiter Bormann.\r\n\r\n3. Administration of justice by the people. This is to be carried out\r\nstep by step as soon as possible, first of all in the villages and\r\nthe small towns of up to about 20,000 inhabitants. It is difficult to\r\ncarry it out in large towns. I shall rouse the Party particularly to\r\ncooperate in this scheme by an article in the Hoheitstrager (NSDAP\r\npublication). It is evident that jurisdiction may not lie in the hands\r\nof the Party. [Marginal note in pencil: according to the permanency of\r\nthe courts (?)]\r\n\r\n4. Orders regarding the police and justice are, in future, to be\r\ntempered, for example, not prosecuting unmarried mothers if they\r\nattempt to procure abortion.\r\n\r\n5. The Reich Fuehrer of SS is agreed that the cancellation of sentence,\r\neven for members of the police, will rest, as in Article 8 of the law\r\nrelating to the cancellation of sentence, with the Reich Minister for\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n6. The Reich Fuehrer of SS has given full consent to the ruling I have\r\nplanned on the corporal punishment ordered by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n7. I shall refer to the Common Law relating to Aliens and will give\r\nnotification of the claims of Justice, e.g. in the identification of\r\nyoung people as anti-social elements and their arrest. Also, it seems\r\nto me that the actual circumstances which serve to stamp a person as\r\nanti-social are not laid down in the law with sufficient clarity. The\r\nReich Fuehrer of SS is waiting for our opinion, and until then will not\r\ncarry out the text of the law.\r\n\r\n8. The Reich Fuehrer of SS has agreed to a clause for the Juvenile\r\nCourt Law, whereby the age of discretion can be reduced to 12 years\r\nand the reduced age of discretion can be extended to over 18 years.\r\n[Marginal note in pencil: \"by which he has made clear that a reduction\r\nin the age limit of full age of discretion is meant.\"]\r\n\r\n9. SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Bender, of the Staff of the Reich Fuehrer\r\nof SS, is appointed by the Reich Fuehrer of SS as liaison officer for\r\nmatters which appear to necessitate direct liaison with the Reich\r\nFuehrer of SS. He can be contacted any time by tele-printer in the\r\nField Headquarters of the Reich Fuehrer of SS, and will come once\r\nevery month to Berlin to report to me here. Hauptsturmfuehrer Wanniger\r\nis appointed as liaison officer for other matters, and he will be at\r\nSecurity Headquarters (Sicherheitsharuptamt).\r\n\r\n10. The Reich Fuehrer of SS declared that, in the infliction of\r\npunishment, special establishments should be set up, on the principle\r\nthat confirmed criminals should be confined separately and that those\r\ncapable of improvement should be separated according to the nature of\r\ntheir crimes (e.g. impostors, thieves and those who have committed acts\r\nof violence). This was recognized as correct.\r\n\r\n11. The Reich Fuehrer of SS demands that the penal register should\r\nbe kept by the police. Arguments against this are to be examined\r\n(cancellation and tightening up of the Penal Register Bill and\r\nadditions made to it). The question is to be further discussed with\r\nGruppenfuehrer Streckenbach.\r\n\r\n12. The Reich Fuehrer of SS pointed out as reliable\r\nSS--Obersturmfuehrer Reichsgerichtsrat _Altstetter_, at present on\r\nactive service as a Major, and also Landgerichtspraesident _Stepp_; he\r\ndesignated as unreliable Generalstaatstanwalt _Jung_ in Dresden.\r\n\r\n13. Finally, the Reich Fuehrer of SS broached the subject of the Office\r\nof the Public Prosecutor and its transfer to the police. I rejected it\r\nflatly. There was no further discussion of this subject.\r\n\r\n14. It is agreed that, in consideration of the intended aims of the\r\nGovernment for the clearing up of the Eastern problems, in future Jews,\r\nPoles, Gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians are no longer to be judged by\r\nthe ordinary courts, so far as punishable offenses are concerned, but\r\nare to be dealt with by the Reich Fuehrer of SS. This does not apply to\r\ncivil lawsuits, nor to Poles whose names are announced or entered in\r\nthe German Racial Lists.\r\n\r\n  Signed Th.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 656-PS\r\n\r\n National Socialist German Workers' Party Party Chancellory\r\n\r\n  The Chief of the Party Chancellory\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer's Headquarters\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  [Stamp]\r\n\r\n  Circular No. 12/43g.\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Subject: Law of Self-Defense against P.O.W.'s\r\n\r\nI acknowledge the copy of the annexed order of the Supreme Command of\r\nthe Wehrmacht.\r\n\r\n  (s)      M.

General (IA)\r\n  No. 3868 142g\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Subject: Self Defense against Prisoners of War.\r\n  Reference: None.\r\n\r\nThe question of the treatment of Prisoners of War is continually being\r\nbrought up and discussed by Wehrmacht and Party bureaus, namely that\r\nthe possibilities of punishment provided in the agreement of 1929\r\n(M. Dr.-38/2) are not sufficient. Primarily neither the military\r\npunishment law nor the discipline law, which has been eliminated for\r\nGerman military personnel, offers a punishment which can be used with\r\nsatisfactory success in case of an insubordinate and provoking attitude\r\nof Prisoners of War. The following is hereby fundamentally affirmed:\r\n\r\n1. The M.Dr. 38/2 (Agreement 1929) article 46, states that Prisoners of\r\nWar cannot receive any other punishments than those meted out to German\r\nmilitary personnel. That applies to all Prisoners of War with the\r\nexception of Soviet Prisoners of War. For Soviet Prisoners of War the\r\norder of the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht 2 f 24.73 AWA/Prisoners\r\nof War, General (IA) No. 389/42g of the 24.3.1942 Article A, fourth\r\nparagraph is applicable.\r\n\r\n2. Improper and provoking attitude of Prisoners of War toward German\r\nguard personnel as well as toward German contractors and workers\r\nforces and justifies this being enacted for the preservation of their\r\nown dignity and of national esteem. German law has an application\r\nfor this; in the case of self-defense ST GB Art 53 is applicable.\r\nAccording to the existing law, self-defense occurs not only in the case\r\nof present actual attacks but also present attacks on one's honor, on\r\none's property, etc. The law of self-defense concerns not only the\r\nparty attacked, it applies also to the protection of a third party\r\nfrom attack. Third, in the sense of the N Art 53 a.a. G, are not only\r\npersons, but also the persons of the public and private law, as for\r\ninstance the State, the municipality, society etc. The party attacked\r\ncan use for protection any means that the situation requires and the\r\nuse of which does not contradict healthy national interest [Gesunden\r\nVolksempfinden]. A _subsequent_ punishment of a prisoner of war for\r\nan improper and provoking attitude of _physical chastisement_ is not\r\npermissible since self-defense is no longer present.\r\n\r\n3. In case of the diminishing of the effort to work only the guard and\r\nthe assistant guard (for example among the farmers there is very often\r\na personal union between assistant-guard and contractor) can interfere\r\nas the military superior of the Prisoners of War. In this he is not\r\nonly authorized but also obliged by duty (see Order of the OKW A2 2f\r\n2417a Chief of Prisoners of War/General (I)/Org (IIIb) No. 2916/42 of\r\nthe 26.6.1942). Should the prisoners of war not fulfill his order,\r\n_then he has in the case of the most pressing need and danger,--the\r\nright to force obedience with the weapon if he has no other means_.\r\nHe can use the weapon as much as is necessary to attain his goal. If\r\nthe assistant guard is not armed, then, he is authorized in forcing\r\nobedience by other applicable means.\r\n\r\n4. The military personnel, officials, and assisting guard personnel\r\nwho are charged with the duty of guarding prisoners of war are to be\r\ninstructed accordingly. It is to be made clear to them what means the\r\nlaw puts at their disposal, in order that they may be able to combat\r\ninsubordinations, provocative attitudes and abatement of the will to\r\nwork on the part of the prisoners of war, and what also the limits are\r\nto which they can go.\r\n\r\n  Distribution:\r\n  * * *\r\n  D.d.R.d.A.:\r\n  Weber\r\n  Chief of the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht\r\n  /s/      Reinecke\r\n  F.d.R.\r\n  /s/      v.

[Volkspolitische Rechtsgestaltung]\r\n\r\n1 _a._ _Resettlement_ (pages 6-8).\r\n\r\nFor the carrying out of costly and long-term measures for the increase\r\nof agricultural production, the Governmental-General can at the most\r\nabsorb 1 to 1.5 million resettlers, as it is already over-populated.\r\n* * * By further absorption of 1.6 million resettlers, the 1925 Reich\r\ncensus figure of 133 inhabitants per square kilometer would be reached,\r\nwhich practically because of already existing rural over-population and\r\nlack of industry would result in a double over-population.\r\n\r\nThis figure of 1.6 million will barely suffice to transfer from the\r\nReich:\r\n\r\nThe Jews from the liberated East (over 600,000), parts of the remaining\r\nJews, preferably the younger age groups from Germany proper, Austria,\r\nSudetengau and the Protectorate (altogether over 1 million).\r\n\r\nThe Polish intelligentsia who have been politically active in the past,\r\nand potential political leaders.\r\n\r\nThe leading economic personalities, comprising owners of large estates,\r\nindustrialists and businessmen, etc.\r\n\r\nThe peasant population, so far as it has to be removed in order to\r\ncarry out by strips of German settlements the encirclement of Polish\r\nterritories in the East.\r\n\r\n6 to 7 million Poles (not including the majority of the Wasserpolen,\r\nSchlonsaken, Kaschuben) would therefore remain for an extended period\r\nof time in the liberated East, and it will be possible to accept only\r\na small fraction of them into German folksdom. * * * A resettlement\r\nof many millions can only be undertaken after victory and only in\r\nconnection with an overwhelming reorganization of the East, which would\r\ncreate space for the surplus Poles, be it in Siberia, or be it in the\r\nbordering territories, for example after the resettlement eastwards of\r\nthe White Russians. A resettlement of several million Jews, perhaps in\r\nMadagascar, could also create space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_c._ In regard to internal colonization of the East of the Reich,\r\nit might be expedient to envisage the carrying out of a planned\r\nencirclement of the districts with a Polish majority by wide strips of\r\nGerman settlements. Also, a concentration of the remaining Poles in\r\norder to create space can be considered.\r\n\r\n_d._ In order to relieve the living space of the Poles in the\r\nGovernment-General as well as in the liberated East, one should remove\r\ncheap labor temporarily by the hundreds of thousands, employ them for a\r\nfew years in the old Reich, and thereby hamper their native biological\r\npropagation. (Their assimilation into the old Reich must be prevented.)\r\n\r\nIf 1.5 million people are to be transferred in short order (in\r\nabout 4 years, i.e., 1000 daily) from the East of the Reich and\r\nare to be absorbed by the Government-General, if among them there\r\nare barely 1 million Poles and the rest Jews, then 7 million Poles\r\nwould remain in the Reich, including Poles in Germany proper and\r\nAustria, but not including prisoners of war, seasonal workers from the\r\nGovernment-General and for the time being also Kaschuben, and of course\r\nMasurians and other Slavic Germanic tribes. There would be 1 Pole for\r\nevery 12 Germans in the Reich excluding the Government-General.\r\n\r\nThe figure of 7 million comprises for example the following peoples:\r\nFinns, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians; it is double the number of\r\nSudeten-Germans in former Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nIt is terrifyingly high and cannot be decreased considerably by\r\nemigration assimilation, or additional future transfer to the\r\nGovernment-General.\r\n\r\nThis mass of Poles is a great inconvenience, an obstacle to the\r\nGermanization of the country, and under certain circumstances a danger.\r\nIt can be reduced by enlarging the Government-General.\r\n\r\nIn renouncing an area with a population of 1 million, it would be\r\npossible not only to get rid of this number of Poles but about 1.2\r\nmillion, since the areas in question are sufficiently fertile to absorb\r\n15 to 20% additional resettlers. For example, the territory of the\r\nformer district of Lodz (19,000 square kilometers) had a population of\r\n2.86 million (1938). One could take 150,000 Germans from their area\r\nand put over 3 million Poles into it. Or by giving up the Cracow Ural\r\ndistrict (Olkusz) and the Zickenau district one could get rid of about\r\n1.5 million Poles, including additional settlers from the Reich. The\r\nfurther deliberations presuppose that no areas of the Eastern districts\r\n(Ostgaue) will be renounced in favor of the Government-General.\r\nTherefore a major part of this Polish mass, which is much too large,\r\ncould emigrate only to areas East of the Government-General. A\r\nprerequisite would be a thorough reorganization of the entire East\r\nand many of its numerous peoples, under the determining influence of\r\nthe Reich (a memorandum is necessary). The total emigration of over\r\n3 million Jews (possibly to Madagascar) would also create space for\r\nPolish resettlement.\r\n\r\nAbout 1 million Poles could be taken out of their settlements, but\r\nnot from the Reich, and used as agricultural and industrial itinerant\r\nlabor. This would doubtless result in considerable relief, particularly\r\nfrom the biological viewpoint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrictest care is to be taken that secret circulars, memoranda and\r\nofficial correspondence which contains instructions detrimental to the\r\nPoles are kept steadily under lock and key so that they will not some\r\nday fill the White Books printed in Paris or the USA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 666-PS\r\n\r\nSECRET\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIVES\r\n\r\nfor the prosecution of offences against the Reich or against the\r\noccupation authorities in the occupied territories.\r\n\r\n  7 December 1941\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the Russian campaign, communist elements and\r\nother anti-German circles increased their attacks on the Reich and the\r\noccupation authorities in the occupied territories.

This\r\ngoal would be forfeited if the relatives were to be notified in cases\r\nof death. Surrender of the body for burial at home is inadvisable for\r\nthe same reason, and also because the place of burial could be misused\r\nfor demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that the following general rule be decided upon for\r\ncases of death:\r\n\r\n_a._ Notification of relatives is not to take place.\r\n\r\n_b._ The body is buried at the place of death, in the Reich.\r\n\r\n_c._ The place of burial is not made known for the time being.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the deceased Frenchman Rousseau, I have given orders\r\nwhich accord with the above proposal and I will do likewise in the\r\nfuture pending a decision by you.\r\n\r\n  pp.\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 35, Tirpitzufer 72--76, July 13, 1942\r\n  14 m 16.18 WR (I 3/4), No. 562/42 g\r\n  To the Chief of the Security Police and Security Service\r\n  Berlin SW11, Prinz Albrecht Str. 8\r\n  [Pencil alteration]\r\n\r\n  [Pencil note--]\r\n  E46 E8/46 38/42\r\n  Reich Ministry of Justice 16th July 1942\r\n  Section\r\n\r\n  By way of information to:\r\n\r\n Supreme Command of the Army\r\n\r\n Supreme Command of the Navy\r\n\r\n Reich Minister of Air Transportation and Commander-in-Chief of the Air\r\n Forces\r\n\r\n President of the Reich Court Martial\r\n\r\n Reich Minister of Justice\r\n\r\n Armed Forces Operations Staff/Headquarters\r\n\r\n _Subject_: Prosecution of punishable offences against the Reich or the\r\n occupation forces in the occupied territories.\r\n\r\n _Reference_:--IV D 4--103/42 g--of June 24, 1942. 1 enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe supreme command of the armed forces agrees to the suggested\r\ntreatment of cases of death.

Such execution of criminal agents in the Bielitz district\r\nhave already been made before also without the knowledge of the proper\r\nauthority for criminal persecution. On 2 December 1941 the head of the\r\nstate police at Kattowitz, chief councillor to the government Mildner,\r\nreported orally to the undersigned that he had ordered as necessary\r\nimmediate action, with authority from the Reich-leader of the SS these\r\nexecutions by public hanging at the place of the crime; and that\r\ndeterring measures would also have to be continued in the future until\r\nthe criminal and actively anti-German powers in the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories have been destroyed, or until other immediate actions,\r\nperhaps also by the courts, would guarantee equal frightening effect.\r\nAccordingly, 6 leaders of another Polish organization guilty of high\r\ntreason in the district in and around Sosnowitz were to be hanged\r\npublicly today as an example.\r\n\r\nAbout this procedure the undersigned expressed considerable doubts.\r\n\r\nBesides the fact that such measures have been withdrawn from the\r\njurisdiction of the ordinary courts and are contradictory to the laws\r\nnot put out of effect, a justified emergency for the exceptional\r\nproceedings by the police alone cannot, in our opinion, be lawfully\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe penal justice in our district within the limits of our jurisdiction\r\nis quite capable of fulfilling its duty of immediate penal retribution\r\nby means of a special form of special judicial activity (establishment\r\nof a so-called rapid special court). Indictment and proceeding could\r\nbe speeded up in such a way that between turning the case over to the\r\npublic prosecutor and execution no more than 3 days would elapse if the\r\npractice of pardoning is simplified and if the decision, if necessary,\r\ncan be obtained by long distance call. This was expressed yesterday to\r\nthe head of the state police at Kattowitz by the undersigned.\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe that execution by the police of criminals,\r\nespecially German criminals, can be considered more effective through\r\nshattering the sense of justice of many German countrymen. In the long\r\nrun they might, in spite of public terrorizing, lead even more to\r\nfurther brutality of minds, which is contrary to the intended purpose\r\nof pacifying. These deliberations, however, do not apply to future\r\nlawful competence of a drumhead court-martial for Poles and Jews.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent report of the head of the Kattowitz state police\r\nto the district leader [Gauleiter] Bracht, the cases of 540 persons\r\naccused of high treason from the Kattowitz district have already been\r\nforwarded in December 1940 by the police to the board of arraignment\r\nof the people's court in Berlin without any sentences having been\r\npassed there as yet. This situation, which became known in the various\r\nbranches of interested party circles and administration departments,\r\ninjures the reputation of justice in general as well as the concept\r\nof the effectiveness of justice in the occupied Eastern territories\r\nespecially because, with the exception of the court, the exclusive\r\ncompetence of the people's court for the sentencing of matters of high\r\ntreason is not sufficiently known.\r\n\r\nWe are not informed as to how far the described situation of\r\nnon-settlement is true.\r\n\r\nAs far as the proceedings of treasonable cases by the chief Reich\r\nprosecutor at the people's court in Berlin are concerned which were\r\nforwarded for prosecution to the co-undersigned public prosecutor\r\n(proceedings per par. 5 section 2 of the law about the competence of\r\ncriminal courts dated 21 Feb. 40--RGBl I, p. 405--in connection with\r\nthe AV of Reich justice ministry dated 7 June 45--German law, page 683)\r\nwe should like to point out the following:\r\n\r\nFrom July 1941 until today, the cases of 235 accused were forwarded\r\nby the chief Reich prosecutor; 122 of the accused have already been\r\nsentenced, indicted, or proceedings were suspended or transferred.\r\n\r\nThe co-undersigned president of the supreme country court has taken\r\nsteps to expedite prosecution further by personally supplementing\r\nthe criminal court for high treason. If it should become necessary\r\nin the future, a second court could be appointed for the prosecution\r\nof matters of high treason by putting aside less important work.\r\nAll organizations charged with prosecuting and sentencing of high\r\ntreason and also with other severe crimes have been impressed by the\r\nundersigned that a speedy treatment is essential for war and nation.\r\n\r\nWith these organizational measures intended and already partially\r\nintroduced by us of creating a \"Rapid Special Court\" which should also\r\nbe technically equipped with everything necessary, and with the likely\r\nestablishment at any time of a second court for matters of high treason\r\nin Kattowitz, the executions by the police still remain necessary as\r\nimmediate actions against traitors, according to the chief councillor\r\nto the government Mildner, for the anti-German treasonal activity is\r\nsupposed to have increased to such an extent that comparisons with\r\nthe situation in 1917 and 1918 are already permissible, and that the\r\ncriminals draw courage and power from the drawn-out legal trials of\r\nthe traitors. The situation in the Kattowitz district is supposed to\r\nbe especially difficult because there are 1-1/2 million Poles, 150,000\r\nCzechs, and 7,000 Jews among the 3 million population whose anti-German\r\nattitude is being joined in a remarkable way by more and more Germans\r\nin the last months. A further worsening of the situation is to be\r\ncounted on if the war should last longer; for the Poles are said to be\r\nfanatically convinced of the victory of the Western countries and of a\r\nresurrection of their country, and, without inhibition, risk everything\r\nwhich does not seem to be punishable by death. The terrorist activity\r\nof the last few months does not appear to leave the Reich Germans in\r\nthe Eastern occupied districts unimperilled. The slightest military\r\nset-back could result in immediate danger due to the growing and\r\nimmediate terrorist readiness of the anti-German organizations. These\r\nare the reasons why the head of the state police considers as necessary\r\nimmediate measures also in the field of high treason. If such steps\r\ncould be taken by judicial means, this would seem also to him the best\r\nsolution since the state police is already overburdened and suffering\r\nfrom considerable personnel shortage.\r\n\r\nAfter this discourse we cannot help but have the impression that the\r\nsituation, especially with respect to high treason (terrorist) activity\r\nhas grown serious since the spring of 1941 and that special measures\r\nhave to be taken to subdue same effectively. We pointed out to the head\r\nof the state police our insufficient competence in this field, but have\r\ninformed him that we would report this matter to the Reich minister of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great judicial importance of the mentioned problems\r\nfor the district of the Kattowitz high county court, we deem an\r\nearly personal discussion at Kattowitz necessary, and that the chief\r\ncouncillor to the government Mildner and perhaps a representative of\r\nthe people's court and of the chief Reich prosecutor at the people's\r\ncourt should be taken into consultation.\r\n\r\n  (signed)     Dr. Heimer\r\n\r\n[illegible notes showing that the conference had taken place]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 675-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Nationalsocialist German Workers Party\r\n  Berlin--Wilhelm Str. 64\r\n  Munich, Brown House\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer\r\n\r\n To the Reichminister for Justice, Attn: Ministerial office director\r\n Stadermann or his deputy\r\n\r\n  [Rubber stamp]\r\n  Reichministry for Justice\r\n  25 August 1938,\r\n\r\n  Dept V      Gst      a,\r\n  16 Aug 1938, III D--Es, 3315/0/31--3604 Secret\r\n  Berlin W 8 Wilhelmstrasse 65\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Austrian Concordat\r\n  Your letter of 23 May 1938--Va 146/38 Secret\r\n\r\nI have purposely not taken a hand in the letters, which I have\r\nreceived from various Reichministers as well as from the Reichfuehrer\r\nSS and the Chief of the German Police, since the Fuehrer's decision\r\non that was known to me already in connection with a lecture by the\r\nReichcommissioner for the incorporation of Austria into the Reich.

This question has to be brought to a conclusive\r\nclarification immediately.\r\n\r\nI deem the following conceptions possible:\r\n\r\nThe Concordat will not be considered as binding already for the reason\r\nthat it has not at all been reached _within the framework of the\r\nconstitution_.\r\n\r\nThe more detailed reasons for that are evident from the following:\r\n\r\n1. The negotiations for conclusion of the Concordat had come to an end\r\nalready on 5 June 1933, on which day the Concordat had been initialed\r\nin Vatican City.\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, the Concordat was not submitted for further\r\nconstitutional processing by the federal government of Austria\r\nfor almost a whole year, because the National Council of Austria\r\nwas considered suspended in accordance with the so-called\r\n\"self-elimination\" thesis represented by the federal government due\r\nto the resignation of all its three presidents, and beyond that, the\r\nacceptance of the Concordat could not be expected because of the\r\nmajority relationships as they existed at that time within the National\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional processing, in accordance with article 50 of the\r\nfederal constitutional law as provided for in the version of 1929 (RGBl\r\nNr 1/1930), would have had to consist of the fact that the Concordat,\r\nbeing a political and law-changing treaty of the State, would have to\r\nbe presented to the National Council for approval in order to attain\r\nits validity, in which connection the respective decision regarding\r\nthe character of this State treaty, which simultaneously changes the\r\nconstitution, can only be made in the presence of at least half of the\r\nmembers of the National Council with a majority of two thirds of the\r\nvotes cast; besides, the decision of the National Council would have\r\nhad to be submitted to further prescribed procedure (presentation to\r\nthe Federal Council).\r\n\r\nThe Concordat was processed further only in conjunction with the\r\ndevelopment which led to the constitution of 1934, and that in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nWhile, up to that date, the repeatedly uttered request for another\r\nsession of the National Council had always been opposed on the\r\nground that it was impossible to convoke it because of the so-called\r\n\"self-elimination program\" and whilst, on the basis of this claim, one\r\nhad governed by means of the enabling act for war economy which had\r\noriginally been passed for certain exclusively economic purposes (RGBl.\r\nNo. 307/1917), now all of a sudden, also based on this act, by a decree\r\ndated 24 April 1934 (RGBl. I No. 238/1934), the federal act concerning\r\nthe rules of procedure of the National Council was amended to the\r\neffect that, although a president did not exist, the National Council\r\nwas in a position to reassemble.\r\n\r\nThis procedure was absolutely unconstitutional. The Federal Government\r\nprevented through police power the attempt of the last-retired\r\npresident of the National Council to revive this body by summoning\r\nthe National Council anew in his capacity as the last president. On\r\nthe other hand, the Federal Government had also constantly refused to\r\nuse the possibility given by article 18, paragraph 3-5 of the Federal\r\nconstitutional Law of 1929, to set the National Council going again\r\nthrough an emergency decree of the Federal president. Instead of this,\r\nin the meantime, all possible legal measures were based upon the\r\nenabling act for war economy, which was entirely contrary to the realm\r\nof authorization of this law and entirely against the constitution. An\r\nespecially notorious abuse of the enabling act for war economy was the\r\nemployment of the enabling act for war economy for the issuance of the\r\naforementioned decree with which the rules of procedure of the National\r\nCouncil were changed.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the National Council summoned on this basis no longer\r\nhad the composition with which it had emerged from the last elections;\r\non the contrary it was only a rump-parliament, because all mandates of\r\nthe Social Democratic Labor Party in the meantime were also declared\r\nvoid by a decree of February 16, 1934 (RGBl. I Nr 100/1934) also based\r\nupon the before-mentioned enabling act for war economy.\r\n\r\nThis rump-parliament assembled on 30 April 1934 for a conference in\r\nwhich solemn declarations were made by the Gross Deutsche Volkspartei\r\nand the Landbund--the two parties with outspoken National character--in\r\nwhich the constitutional legality of the whole procedure was expressly\r\ndisputed, after which all delegates of the two named parties left the\r\nconference, with the exception of one delegate of the Landbund who at\r\nthe same time was holding a public office, so that for the further\r\ndiscussions and resolutions only the before-mentioned one delegate of\r\nthe Landbund and the delegates of the Christian-Social-Party and the\r\nHeimatschutz remained who together comprised only 76 delegates.\r\n\r\nThese 76 delegates now passed the so called Federal Constitutional\r\nLaw concerning extraordinary measures within the jurisdiction of the\r\nconstitution (RGBl. I Nr. 255/1934). Through Art. I of which the\r\nabove mentioned decrees of Art. 50 of the Federal Constitutional\r\nLaw of 1929 concerning the co-operation of the National Council in\r\nNational treaties were cancelled. This constituted, in addition to the\r\nunconstitutional manner of the summons, a further very substantial\r\nviolation of the constitution, in that--as has been mentioned already\r\nin the beginning--according to Art. 44, section 1, of the Federal\r\nConstitutional Law in the version of 1929, constitutional laws could\r\nonly be passed in the presence of at least one half of the members\r\nof the National Council with a two-thirds majority of the votes cast,\r\nbut the National Council consisted, in accordance with paragraph 1 of\r\nthe election rules of 165 delegates and therefore the presence of at\r\nleast 83 delegates would have been required in order to pass upon a\r\nresolution changing the constitution.\r\n\r\nAfter the federal constitutional law of 30 April 1934 had also been\r\npresented to the Federal Council which for the same reasons as the\r\nNational Council, held sessions as a rump body, and it had issued no\r\nprotest, it was announced yet on 30 April 1934, causing the day of its\r\ntaking effect to be 1 May 1934.\r\n\r\nAlready during the night of 30 April to 1 May 1934, the exchange of\r\nratifications prepared with the Papal Nuntio took place and already on\r\nthe 1 May 1934 the concordat was made public in the federal gazette.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding explanation it is evident, that the Concordat\r\nbetween the Holy See and the Republic of Austria has been concluded\r\nunder circumstances which offer the possibility to represent, with\r\nreasons which cannot be contradicted, the point of view that the\r\nconclusion of the Concordat was completely in violation of the\r\nconstitution and therefore no legal validity can be attributed to the\r\nConcordat. In this respect it has to be noted that the fact that the\r\nConcordat was concluded in violation of the constitution was regarded\r\nas a fact already at that time in all serious judicial circles in\r\nAustria. (Compare in this respect particularly also the remarks\r\nreferring to the Concordat made in the work of Guerke on \"The Austrian\r\nConstitution of 1934\" in the archive of public law, new edition, volume\r\n25, page 178 pp.).\r\n\r\nThis point of view would open up the following additional path:\r\n\r\nThe Reich government declares to the Holy See on the basis of these\r\nfacts that, after examining the legal angle, it had come to the\r\nconclusion that for the reason stated it could not recognize the\r\nConcordat any longer and is combining with that also with the effect\r\n\"ex nunc\" and with simultaneous legal settlement of the questions\r\nremaining unclarified through the abrogation of the Concordat, the\r\nabolition of the Austrian legal regulations referring to the Concordat\r\n(Federal law RGBl II, Nr. 8/1934 in the version of RGBl Nr. 134/1935\r\nand decree RGBl II Nr. 13/1934).\r\n\r\n2. The Concordat has expired automatically, through the reunion\r\nof Austria with the German Reich, because Austria has vanished as\r\nindependent state, has obtained the constitutional position of a German\r\nstate and therefore lost the position as a subject of international\r\nlaw. This point of view which by reason of logic can surely only be\r\ntaken _retroactive to 13 March 1938_, would be based more exactly on\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nWithin the international legal sphere there is no general legal\r\nsuccession of the territorial successor into the rights and duties\r\nof the territorial predecessor. It rather has to be scrutinized in\r\neach case separately, whether a legal succession in accordance with\r\ninternational law occurs. With the fall of the territorial predecessor,\r\nthe bilateral state treaties concluded by him are as a rule void.\r\nHowever some exceptions to this principle are recognized: National\r\npractice has shown that state treaties will be renewed tacitly by the\r\nterritorial successor simply by administering them further. But a new\r\nstate may also be forced, in order to obtain desired recognition,\r\nto take over certain state treaties. A general _duty in accordance\r\nwith international law_ for the fulfillment of obligations resulting\r\nfrom treaties made by the territorial predecessor, exists, however,\r\nonly in the following cases: As a rule, state treaties which concern\r\nthe territory of the state taken over as such, that is, so-called\r\n\"ratifizierte\" treaties (border treaties, treaties on rivers and\r\nroads of communication), will also fall to the territorial successor.\r\nFurthermore, those Concordats which have in accordance with customary\r\nlaw found recognition beyond the sphere of the partners of the treaty,\r\nwill also be valid for the territorial successor. Lastly, rules can\r\nbe established through a collective treaty which determines a certain\r\norder for a group of states. Those norms also remain in effect in case\r\nof territorial changes within that group and therefore also fall to the\r\nterritorial successor. (Compare Verdross, international law 1937, Page\r\n71.)\r\n\r\nThe following additional consequences would be combined with the\r\nconceptions mentioned above:\r\n\r\nTo 1: The establishment of the unconstitutional conclusion of the\r\nConcordat would first of all represent a strong moral verdict against\r\nthe whole past system connected with the names Dollfuss and Schuschnigg\r\nin Austria, which could be politically very desirable for various\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Reich government toward the other bilateral State\r\ntreaties signed by Austria would not be prejudiced as no other state\r\ntreaty of more importance was signed under the same circumstances\r\nas the Concordat. One would prefer this procedure in the expected\r\ndiscussions with other countries, some of which (Jugoslavia, Poland,\r\nEngland) have already referred to their stipulated rights in Austria.\r\n\r\nThe declaration that the Concordat will not be acknowledged on the\r\ngrounds of unconstitutionality and the repeal of the connected Austrian\r\nlegal provisions with \"ex nunc\" effect would not influence the validity\r\nof the legal acts based on the Concordat (especially on the field of\r\nmatrimonial law as to states rights). An express legalization of the\r\npast is therefore not required.\r\n\r\nFurthermore one could arrive at the point where the conception could\r\nbe maintained that former Austrian territory, in contrast to remaining\r\nReich territory, had become entirely free of the Concordat, an\r\ninterpretation which would be especially unwelcome to the Holy See for\r\nvarious reasons, and would force open the entire question of the future\r\nrelationship between the Reich and the Holy See with all the resulting\r\nconsequences in favor of the Reich in eventual further conferences with\r\nthe Holy See.\r\n\r\nTo 2: On a former occasion the church adopted this point of view, as\r\nthe Reich- and Prussian Minister for church affairs has already pointed\r\nout in his letter to the Foreign Office of 22 March 1938.\r\n\r\nThus in a statement to the secret consistory of 21 November 1921 Pope\r\nBenedict XV discussed the question of the validity and tenure of the\r\nConcordats, since retroactive effects had arisen from the changes in\r\nstate territories and organizations produced by the world war. Therein\r\nthe Pope distinguished between countries which were newly created,\r\ncountries with considerable territorial expansion, and countries which\r\nhave changed so completely that they could not be considered the same\r\n\"moral person\". According to Pope Benedict XV opinion all these three\r\nclasses of countries have \"lost their privileges granted in former\r\nConcordats\". It is quite evident, that Austria, after it became a part\r\nof the German Reich since March 13, 1938, cannot be considered the\r\n\"same moral person\" as before.\r\n\r\nIt has not yet been decided how the bilateral Austrian state Treaties\r\nof noneconomical nature which have been listed in the letter of the\r\nForeign Office of April 6, 1938--R VII. 38 will be handled. One cannot\r\nyet perceive whether the Reich will take over one or the other of these\r\ntreaties. This would no doubt be made use of by the Holy See to insist\r\non the succession of the Reich as to the Austrian Concordat. On the\r\nother hand application of the theory of international law relating\r\nto succession of states as discussed above may lead to unnecessary\r\nsuspicions in other cases, in which the Reich intends to bring about a\r\npeaceful solution with the other partner to the agreement.\r\n\r\nIf one is of the opinion that the Austrian Concordat is abolished by\r\nthe actual reunion of Austria with the Reich then the question comes\r\nup whether, on account of the same fact of territorial expansion, the\r\nConcordat of the Reich logically would have to be regarded as applying\r\nto Austria too.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Concordat was, as far as I know, not expressly extended to\r\nthe Saar-District, after the reembodiment of the latter into Germany;\r\nthere can be no doubt, however, that the Reich Concordat has formal\r\nvalidity in the Saar-District today. Even though the Saar-District\r\nunlike the Federal State of Austria--had not concluded a Concordat\r\nof its own with the Holy See prior to its reembodiment, there can be\r\nno doubt as to the former independent legal competence in accordance\r\nwith international law of the Saar-District. In view of a comparison\r\nwith the Saar-District and the possible conclusion to be drawn with\r\nregard to Austria it seems advisable not to claim the expiration of the\r\nConcordat on the grounds that the Austrian independent state has ceased\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Concordat however, has established very incisive\r\nregulations in the sphere of matrimonial law as pointed out by the\r\nReich Minister for Church Affairs, according to which the Canon\r\nLaw alone is competent for marriages of Catholics; this law has\r\nthe validity of a civil law; the publishing of bans and the laying\r\ndown of obstacles to matrimony are stipulated according to Canon\r\nLaw; Catholic Church authorities and law courts are competent for\r\nmatrimonial affairs; the parson is a registrar at the same time. Should\r\nthe Concordat therefore be considered as having expired as of March\r\n13, 1938 a number of most complicated legal questions would arise; in\r\nparticular the question as to what legal validity should be given to\r\ncatholic matrimonies concluded in Austria after March 13, 1938 and\r\nwhich other legal consequences are to be considered as connected with\r\nsuch matrimonies. It would be regrettable should one have to draw\r\nthe conclusion that legal acts based on the expired Concordat had\r\nsubsequently to be sanctioned by the state.\r\n\r\nOn weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the two conceptions\r\nboth of which can be supported by good legal arguments I should like to\r\nspeak in favour of the conception explained under 1.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad if you will inform me of your opinion about the\r\nquestion raised by May 15, 1938. I am quite aware of the fact that in\r\nview of its great political importance the decision can only be made by\r\nthe Fuehrer and Reich chancellor.\r\n\r\nAfter receipt of your communication I reserve the right to summon a\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Frick\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  D.

If the Concordat were null and void on account of\r\nunconstitutionality, then the same would apply to the legislation for\r\nits execution; the marriages based on the law of 4.5.1934 would be void\r\nand would have to be sanctioned with retroactive force. It is not clear\r\nto me how, on the basis of this reasoning, the Ministry of Interior can\r\nachieve a non-retroactive result in the nullification (p. 5).\r\n\r\nThere remains, therefore, the second solution proposed by the Ministry\r\nof Interior. If the Concordat excludes state succession, it seems to\r\nme, nevertheless, that the expiration of the law of 4.5.1934 does\r\nnot result with effective date of 13.3.38. Even if an international\r\npact expires, it seems to me that the legislation for the execution\r\nwould bind the subjects until it was abrogated by an act of the state.\r\nThe statements on page 9 of the letter are inaccurate insofar as the\r\nmarriages which were contracted after 13.3 were not contracted by\r\nvirtue of the expired Concordat, but by virtue of the law of 4.5.1934.\r\nAccordingly, it seems to me that continuing effect of the law of\r\n4.5.1934 can be achieved in this way.\r\n\r\n  /S/      Ficker 18/5\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Reich and Prussian Ministry for Church Affairs\r\n  Berlin W.8., 3, Leipzigerstrasse, 11th May 1938\r\n  [stamp]\r\n  Reich Ministry of Justice, 13th May 1938.\r\n  Sect.

Suggestions\r\nto this effect will be made to him by the Ministers competent in\r\nquestions of foreign policy and of church affairs, i.e., by the Reich\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and by the Minister for Church Affairs,\r\nwho have already contacted each other for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAlso the question of the Reich Concordats to Austria (which, by the\r\nway, is utterly unbearable) is not a legal but a political matter.\r\nThe question of the continuation of the Reich Concordat and of the\r\n\"state\"--Concordats is connected with this problem. Here, too, the\r\ndecision rests with the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the execution of the necessary laws in Austria, resp.\r\nto the introduction of Reich laws in Austria the only decisive factor\r\nis the political interest of the Reich, whereby the Austrian Concordat\r\nwill be considered as non-existent.\r\n\r\n  Signed:      KERRL.\r\n\r\n  To:\r\n\r\n _a._ The Reich Minister of the Interior\r\n\r\n _b._ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\n _c._ The Reich Minister of Justice\r\n\r\n _d._ The Reich Minister of Education\r\n\r\n _e._ The Deputy of the Fuehrer\r\n\r\n _f._ The Reich Leader of SS troops and Chief of the German Police\r\n\r\n _g._ The Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancery\r\n\r\n  (In connection with a 146/38g) Va- 139/38g\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  The Reich and Prussian Minister of Education, etc.\r\n  Berlin W8, May 17, 1938\r\n  Z II a Nr. 10074 Geh/38      Reich Ministry of Justice\r\n  May 18, 1938\r\n  Dept.

Therefore all legal acts which have taken place up to\r\nthe day of establishment of invalidity of the Austrian concordat would\r\nhave to be sanctioned retroactively.\r\n\r\nLooking at both possibilities, as presented by you, the Austrian\r\nconcordat is void ab initio, in the first case as represented by you\r\nand also by me from the very beginning, in the second case from March\r\n13, 1938 on. For legal considerations, in both cases, the subsequent\r\nsanctioning of any legal acts, carried out meanwhile, is absolutely\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n  By registered mail.\r\n\r\n 1.

Further, I don't think, that we have to fear the\r\neffects upon the Saarland, which you indicated. However, it seems to\r\nme of the utmost importance, that the treaties, concluded by Austria\r\nwith other states, have not been concluded under similar circumstances;\r\ntherefore these states do not have to fear similar consequences, a\r\nfact, which should be pointed out at the time of the declaration of the\r\ninvalidity of the Austrian concordat.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it advisable, to refer while dealing with the Curia,\r\nespecially since this point of view was also advocated by Pope Benedict\r\nXV in his statement of November 21, 1921, before the Secret Consistory\r\n(Geheimkonsistorium).\r\n\r\nI also take the position that Austria is without any concordat after\r\nthe establishment of the invalidity of the Austrian concordat. I do not\r\nconsider an extension of the Reich-concordat to Austria appropriate\r\nfrom the point of view of my office.\r\n\r\nBy authority of the State Secretary.\r\n\r\n  Signed KUNISCH\r\n  Certified:\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  Verwaltungssekretaer\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  19 May 1938\r\n\r\n1. Minister of Education, signed Kunisch, May 17, secret, sends copy of\r\nhis letter of May 17th to the Minister of the Interior, concerning the\r\nConcordat between the Holy See and the Republic of Austria.\r\n\r\nI agree with your concept as far as results are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Concordat is devoid of legal validity, since it was\r\nnot concluded in an orderly fashion and in accordance with the\r\nconstitution, as apparent from your explanations. However, I shall have\r\nto differ with you on the point that the contract is not merely invalid\r\n\"ex nunc\" (from now on) but \"ex tunc\", i.e., from the very beginning.\r\nThe necessity arises therewith to sanction retroactively all legal acts\r\nexecuted by reason of the Concordat till the date when invalidity of\r\nthe Austrian Concordat was proven.\r\n\r\nEntering upon the two possibilities explained by you, the Austrian\r\nConcordat would therefore be invalid \"ex tunc\", as far as your first\r\ncase and also mine is concerned from the very beginning, and in the\r\nsecond case as of 13 March 1938. In both cases the need arises on the\r\nbasis of judicial-political considerations for retroactive sanction of\r\nlegal acts executed in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe first possibility, the proof of the constitutional invalidity of\r\nthe Austrian Concordat, carries a moral condemnation of the former\r\nsystem in Austria, as you have explained so fittingly: a system that\r\nwithout the mandate of the Austrian people had usurped the power\r\nof state and concluded a Concordat without the official approval\r\n(legitimation) of the Austrian people. I should add, that I have no\r\nfear of possible conclusions a posteriori concerning the Saar-District,\r\nwhich you have mentioned. I consider it of highest importance that\r\nother treaties concluded with other States by Austria were not made\r\nunder similar circumstances, thus those States had no reason to fear\r\nsimilar repercussions for themselves, a fact which should be emphasized\r\nimmediately upon presentation of proof of the invalidity of the\r\nAustrian Concordat.\r\n\r\nHowever, I consider it correct procedure, that we should assist the\r\nCuria (Kurie) by showing them the second possibility, specially that\r\nthis conception was advocated by Pope Benedictus XV in his declaration\r\nof 21 November 1921 before the Secret Consistorium.\r\n\r\nI also support the viewpoint that after proof has been presented of\r\nthe invalidity of the Austrian Concordat, Austria will be free of\r\nconcordats. An extension of the Reich Concordat to include Austria I\r\nwould not consider advisable or within the interest of my sphere of\r\ncompetence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 682-PS\r\n\r\n DISCUSSION OF THIERACK WITH DR. GOEBBELS ON SEPT. 14, 1942 IN BERLIN\r\n\r\n  1--2.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n2. With regard to the destruction of asocial life, Dr. Goebbels is of\r\nthe opinion that the following groups should be exterminated: Jews and\r\ngypsies unconditionally, Poles who have to serve 3-4 years of penal\r\nservitude, and Czechs and Germans who are sentenced to death or penal\r\nservitude for life or to security custody [Sicherungsvorwahrung] for\r\nlife. The idea of exterminating them by labor is the best. For the rest\r\nhowever, except in the aforementioned cases, every case has to be dealt\r\nwith individually. In this case, of course, Czechs and Germans have to\r\nbe differently judged. There may be cases where a German sentenced to\r\n15 years of penal servitude is not to be considered asocial, but in\r\ncontrast to this a person sentenced to penal servitude up to 8 years\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 686-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy to RK 26272 B\r\n\r\n Decree of the Fuehrer and Reichs Chancellor to strengthen German\r\n folkdom\r\n\r\n  Oct 7th 1939.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the Versailles Treaty have been removed in Europe.\r\nNow the Greater German Reich has the possibility of admitting into its\r\nterritory, Germans who had to live abroad, and to resettle them, and\r\nto arrange the settlement of the groups of people, within her sphere\r\nof interest, in a way that there will be better distinction between\r\nthem. I entrust the Reichsfuehrer SS with the execution of this task\r\naccording to the following regulations:\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS has the obligation in accordance with my\r\ndirectives:\r\n\r\n1. to bring back for final return into the Reich all German nationals\r\nand racial Germans in the foreign countries;\r\n\r\n2. to eliminate the harmful influence of such alien parts of the\r\npopulation, which represent a danger to the Reich and German folk\r\ncommunity;\r\n\r\n3. the forming of new German settlements by resettling and in\r\nparticular by settling of the returning German citizens and racial\r\nGermans from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS is authorized to take all necessary general and\r\nadministrative measures for the execution of this obligation.\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS can assign certain living areas to the parts of\r\nthe population in question in order to execute the tasks given to him\r\nin Article I, No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn the occupied former Polish territories the Administration Chief of\r\nthe East [Verwaltungschef Ober-Ost] carries out the tasks assigned to\r\nthe Reichsfuehrer SS according to the latter's general orders.

Treatment of Soviet prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of increased use of the labor of Soviet prisoners of\r\nwar necessitates a new regulation of their treatment. The statutes in\r\nreference to this matter are repealed, and the following regulation is\r\nin effect in the future for the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war:\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Treatment of Soviet Prisoners of War in General_\r\n\r\nBolshevism is the mortal enemy of National Socialist Germany. The\r\nSoviet soldier must on principle be considered a carrier of Bolshevism.\r\nTherefore it answers political necessity and the authority and dignity\r\nof the German armed forces, for every German soldier to keep his\r\ndistance from the Soviet prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nWith cool and correct treatment, avoidance of violence and insults, and\r\nprotection from public curiosity, the work done by the Soviet prisoners\r\nof war can be increased. It is forbidden to carry out retaliatory\r\nmeasures against them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, any attempted fraternization is to be rejected.\r\nEven the public must at all times be aware of the feeling of pride and\r\nsuperiority of the German soldier detailed to guard Soviet prisoners of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nRuthless and energetic action in cases of uncooperativeness, refusal to\r\nwork, and negligence in work, especially toward Bolshevist agitators,\r\nis to be ordered; insubordination or active resistance must be\r\ncompletely removed _immediately_ with a weapon (bayonet, gun-butt, or\r\nfirearm, no sticks). The decree concerning use of arms by the armed\r\nforces is to be interpreted strictly. Whoever does not use his weapon\r\nor does not use it energetically enough in seeing that an order is\r\ncarried out is liable to punishment (see [volume?] VI, 12). Notation:\r\nalso page 8).\r\n\r\n2. _All traffic between the Soviet prisoners of war and the civilian\r\npopulation is to be prevented._ Special attention is to be given to the\r\nseparation of the captured officers, which has in general already been\r\ncarried out by the field army, in the territory of the armed forces\r\ncommanders and in the Reich territory; especially since Soviet officers\r\nfor understandable reasons frequently pass themselves off as enlisted\r\nmen. Any communication between the Soviet officers and men, even by\r\nsigns, must be made impossible. (see [volume?] V).\r\n\r\n3. A _camp police corps_ is to be formed within the camps and the\r\nlarger labor details of suitable Soviet prisoners of war. This police\r\ncorps will be appointed and supervised by commandants to keep order and\r\nmaintain discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. Individual Instructions_\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Food and clothing_:\r\n\r\n4. According to principle all prisoners of war receive equal treatment.\r\nIn regard to the feeding of Soviet prisoners of war, however, the rates\r\nestablished in the armed forces high command statute Az. 62 f Va/AG V\r\nIII/V 3 (V d) of February 27, 1942, is in effect in the home war area.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the food is prepared without loss of food value and if the\r\ndistribution times are sensibly spaced throughout the day, these\r\nfood rations are adequate to feed the prisoners of war. Points to\r\nbe especially considered in preparing food are contained in the\r\n\"Collection of orders No. 11\".\r\n\r\nEspecially in winter, the food is to be served warm if possible and is\r\nto be distributed as often as possible during the day. The contractors\r\nshould distribute warm food not only after work but also in pauses\r\nin the work. The suitable feeding of the Soviet prisoners of war is\r\nespecially important, since their physical efficiency is low, partly\r\nas a result of years of undernourishment, partly as a result of food\r\ndifficulties in the Soviet army and as a result of war events.\r\n\r\nSince the prisoners of war recover more easily on individual fare\r\noutside the camps than on mass feeding in the camps, it is recommended\r\nthat Soviet prisoners be put to work even if they are not yet\r\ncompletely fit for work. Full achievement cannot, of course, be\r\nexpected in that case (compare army high command of 19 February 1942,\r\nAz. 2f 24. 17 b prisoners of war Org. (III b) No. 678/42).\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, foreign _tobacco_ goods will be made available for\r\nSoviet prisoners of war in the camps. German tobacco is not to be given\r\nto Soviet prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe matter of _clothing_ was settled by decree army high command Az.\r\n2f 24. 23a prisoners of war (II, 2) No. 5632/41 of 22 August 1941.\r\nAccording to this, the clothing debit of the Soviets corresponds to\r\nthat of the other prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Work_:\r\n\r\n5. As a result of the general labor situation, the employment of\r\nthe Soviet prisoners of war, including officers, derives decisive\r\nsignificance. In principle it is permitted everywhere, unless\r\nthere are objections for reasons of defense in individual cases.\r\n(Compare enclosed statute Az. 2f 24. 17 b, chief of prisoners of war\r\n[organization?] III b No. 1474/42 of 1 April 1942, and No. 1396/42 of 9\r\nApril 1942)\r\n\r\nIn general labor columns of at least 20 men are to be provided for. In\r\n_industrial_ economy, however, it is permissible in cases of urgent\r\nbusiness necessity to use smaller labor details down to 5 men in\r\nvarious departments of the * * * concern, even in \"protected\" concerns.\r\nHowever, in such cases the employment of smaller groups requires the\r\nspecial approval of the competent defense post and of the armament\r\ncommand. A prerequisite is the presence of an adequate number of\r\nreliable foremen who have been investigated in regard to defense as\r\n\"auxiliary guards\".\r\n\r\nThe employment of officers requires the special approval of the army\r\nhigh command in each case.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the orderly employment of the Soviet prisoners\r\nof war in the Reich rests exclusively on the bureaus ordering their\r\nemployment:\r\n\r\n_a._ Armed forces high command, chief of prisoners of war affairs;\r\n\r\n_b._ Reich minister for armament and munitions;\r\n\r\n_c._ General plenipotentiary for the labor supply in the four-year plan.\r\n\r\nThe borrowing of Soviet prisoners of war is regulated for the Reich\r\nby statute Az. 2f 24. 27a prisoners of war (II, 2) No. 6999/41 of 29\r\nSeptember 1941, and supplementary statutes:\r\n\r\n Az. 2f 24. 27a prisoners of war (II,2) No. 7645/41 of 23 October 1941\r\n\r\n Az. 2f 24. 27a prisoners of war (II,2) No. 8218/41 of 14 November 1941\r\n\r\n Az. 2f 24. 27a prisoners of war (II,2) No. 9170/41 of 22 December 1941\r\n\r\n Az. 2f 24. 17s prisoners of war (I,5) No. 8102/41 of 22 December 1941\r\n\r\n Az. 2f 24. 17s prisoners of war [org.?] (III b) No. 512/42 of 18\r\n February 1942\r\n\r\nand for the territories of Ostland (Baltic countries and White Russia)\r\nand the Ukraine by statute armed forces high command Az. 2f 24. 17s\r\nprisoners of war [organization?]\r\n\r\n(III b) No. 463/42 of 29 January 1942. For the rest of the eastern\r\nterritories and the Gouvernement General the following decrees are in\r\neffect:\r\n\r\nArmy high command/general staff of the army/ general quarters/ IVa\r\n(III,2) Az. 961/42 No. I/ 5784/42 of 12 January 1942\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmy high command/ general staff of the army general quarters/ IVa\r\n(III,2) Az. 961/42 No. I/ 5784/42 of 4 February 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employment and work of the Soviet prisoners of war are to be under\r\nthe strictest control. Strong measures are to be taken in any case of\r\nrefusal to work.\r\n\r\nPoor or mediocre work not due to weak constitution, exhaustion,\r\nphysical condition, or a similar cause must immediately incur\r\nappropriate punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Free time_:\r\n\r\n6. Musical instruments can be obtained and distributed. Arts and crafts\r\nin the sense of statute AZ. 2f 24. 72g prisoners of war Ch 2 No.\r\n5671/41 of 9 August 1941 are to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThey are not forbidden to organize religious services among themselves,\r\nwhether _by captured priests of the camp_ or by laymen. Spiritual\r\nconsolation for the dying as well as the presence of a captured priest\r\nor lay-priest at burials are permitted. (see VIII).\r\n\r\nIt is forbidden to bring in members of the clergy who are not prisoners\r\nof war. No religious writings may be distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Treatment of minorities_:\r\n\r\n7. Special orders are issued according to need regarding the majority\r\nof the peoples among the Soviet prisoners of war; as far as such orders\r\nhave been issued, they remain fully in effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For all members of the most important Soviet minorities_\r\n\r\n_a._ The delivery of musical instruments (balalaika, etc.)\r\n\r\n_b._ The supplying of well-heated rooms during the winter months;\r\n\r\n_c._ The supplying of appropriate literature chosen in agreement with\r\narmed forces high command/WFST/A Pr and armed forces high command/A\r\nQusl Abw/Abw are permitted. The camp funds which have been accumulated\r\nby Soviet prisoners of war are available for necessary procurement.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which special food and a better tobacco supply are to be\r\ngranted is determined in special orders.\r\n\r\n_d._ An available barracks room is if possible to be placed at the\r\ndisposal of the _Mohammedan_ prisoners of war, where half-hour prayer\r\nsessions may be held several times a day.\r\n\r\n_e._ In addition they are to be permitted to select a Mullah or Iman\r\n(priest).\r\n\r\n\r\n V. _Separation of prisoners of war and civilians of the Eastern\r\n campaign_:\r\n\r\n8. _Deserters_: The peculiar circumstances of the Eastern campaign in\r\nmany cases made it impossible to guarantee the special consideration in\r\ncaptivity promised to deserters. The result of this fact on the Soviet\r\nfront has made itself felt in a most undesirable way, through Soviet\r\nprisoners of war who have escaped and managed to reach their homes. The\r\nGerman troops on the Eastern front have now been instructed, therefore,\r\nto give every _deserter_ a certificate that he has surrendered\r\nvoluntarily and that special treatment in captivity was promised him.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the deserters will be employed with the troops. When\r\nthey are sent to the armed forces commanders and to the Reich, however,\r\nthey are to retain their deserter certificates.\r\n\r\nThey are to be given preferential treatment in billeting in the camp,\r\nin feeding, and in the assignment of work places. It is urgently\r\ndesired that they be kept together, segregated from the other Soviet\r\nprisoners of war, in labor commands.\r\n\r\n9. For the segregation of Soviet prisoners of war and the civilians\r\npresent in the camps, the following is in effect, besides the division\r\nby nationalities in the prisoners of war camps, according to figure IV:\r\n\r\n  To be segregated:\r\n\r\n_a._ Politically undesirable persons,\r\n\r\n_b._ Officers,\r\n\r\n_c._ Politically harmless persons,\r\n\r\n_d._ Politically especially reliable persons (who can be used in the\r\nreconstruction of the occupied territories).\r\n\r\n10. While the first _separation_ according to figure 9 is undertaken,\r\nas far as possible, by the camp organs themselves, the Reichsfuehrer\r\nSS makes _special details of the security police and the security\r\nservice_ available to segregate the Soviet prisoners of war by their\r\npolitical attitude. They are directly under the chief of the security\r\npolice and of the security service and have been especially trained for\r\ntheir special task. They take their measures and make their inquiries\r\n_before_ the Soviet prisoners of war are put to work within the\r\nframework of the camp order, according to directives which they have\r\nreceived from the chief of the security police and the security service.\r\n\r\nThe special details are instructed to work in the closest cooperation\r\nwith the commandants, and especially with their defense officers.\r\nIf the Soviet prisoners of war are put to work _without_ previous\r\nexamination in exceptional cases because of the necessity for hastened\r\ncommitment of labor the special details of the security police and\r\nthe security service will undertake the _segregation_ at the place of\r\nthe labor detail. The head of the labor detail and, if the occasion\r\narises, the contractor will be consulted before the segregation in\r\ndoubtful cases. The special details will then request of the prisoner\r\nof war camps the surrender of those Soviet prisoners of war who are\r\nthen claimed. The approval of the chiefs of the security police and the\r\nsecurity service in Berlin is to be submitted to the camp commandants.\r\nThe request for surrender of the prisoners is then to be met.\r\n\r\nPrisoners of war who are put to work after investigation are to be\r\nconstantly watched by the guards in regard to their sentiments. If in\r\ntime a Soviet prisoner of war proves himself to be unreliable, he is\r\nfirst to be turned over to the prisoner of war camp which will take\r\ncare of turning him in to the security service if the occasion arises.\r\n\r\nIf on the basis of the decree armed forces high command Az. 2f 24.\r\n17b prisoners of war [organisation?] (II b) No. 678/42 of 19 February\r\n1942, Soviet prisoners of war who are not fully capable of working\r\nare given special fare in order that they may gradually be made fully\r\ncapable of working, the contractor is to receive full compensation if\r\nfor political reasons it becomes necessary to turn them over to the\r\nsecurity service.\r\n\r\n11. _Further treatment of the groups segregated under figure 9_:\r\n\r\n_a. Military personnel_: Military personnel includes those soldiers\r\nwho were captured in civilian clothes. Concerning those segregated as\r\n\"politically undesirable elements\" (see figure 9).\r\n\r\n_Officers_ will not always but sometimes be subject to segregation as\r\n\"politically undesirable persons\".\r\n\r\nShould individuals first considered undesirable later prove to be\r\n_trustworthy_, they will, as far as they had already been turned over,\r\nbe transferred to the labor details assigned to the Reichsfuehrer SS or\r\nto the nearest prisoner of war camp or officers camp.\r\n\r\n_b. Civilians_: Concerning undesirable persons see figure 10. As far as\r\nthey are not politically dangerous, their prompt return to the occupied\r\nterritory is to be desired, except insofar as they do not volunteer\r\nfor further work in Germany as civilian workers. The competent armed\r\nforces commander (or the commander of the army rear area) with the\r\napproval of the competent bureau of the chiefs of the security police\r\nand the security service, determines the time for possible return.\r\nA prerequisite for return is a guarantee of work at home in labor\r\nformations which are to be specially set up. The armed forces commander\r\n(or the commander of the army rear area) is responsible for guarding\r\nduring the return journey. If possible the command posts are to supply\r\nescort details.\r\n\r\n_c. Politically especially reliable persons_ (_see 9d_) are to be\r\nused for the segregation of politically undesirables and for work in\r\nthe camp administration. (Racial Germans are especially pointed out;\r\nhowever, one must figure, that even among them there are elements, who\r\nmust be considered \"politically undesirable\".)\r\n\r\nSince the Reichsfuehrer SS for his own purposes must rely in the\r\noccupied territories on the conscription of natives, the conscription\r\ncommand will request from the ranks of the Soviet prisoners of war\r\nespecially trustworthy persons for use and reconstruction in the\r\noccupied territory. Such requests for release by the conscription\r\ncommand of the security police and the SD are to be reported to the\r\nsupreme command armed forces.\r\n\r\n VI. _Procedure in case of escapes or punishable acts_:\r\n\r\n12. Escaping Soviet prisoners of war are to be shot immediately\r\n_without previous warning_. Proclamation on the bulletin board and\r\nduring roll call is necessary. Contrary directives of H Dv 38/11, Page\r\n13, etc., are rescinded thus far.\r\n\r\nNo warning shots are to be fired. On the other hand, arbitrary use of\r\nfirearms is forbidden. If a Soviet prisoner of war is shot by a guard,\r\nfor the purpose of keeping up discipline and to prevent unjustified\r\nshooting, in every case a short description of the happening is to be\r\npresented to the camp commandant with the following details:\r\n\r\n_a._ Whether anything is to be done.\r\n\r\n_b._ Whether action appears necessary for disciplinary reasons.\r\n\r\n_c._ Whether a report of the facts will be submitted.\r\n\r\n13. The following order, published in the armed forces regulation,\r\nremains in force:\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of all soldiers to watch for every unguarded Soviet\r\nprisoner of war, to arrest him, and to deliver him to the nearest\r\npolice station. If a prisoner of war camp is in the immediate vicinity,\r\nthe prisoner of war is to be delivered there.\r\n\r\nOKW Az 2f 24. 19m AWA/prisoner of war (I, 6) of 29 Oct 1941.\r\n\r\nCivilians, as well as prisoners of war of other nations, who return\r\nescaping Soviet prisoners of war may be rewarded.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n  OKW AZ 2f 24.20 PWs (II) No 4493/40 of 11 Dec. 40\r\n  OKW Az 2f 24.20a PWs (112) No 3572/41 of 26 May 41\r\n  OKW Az 2f 24.20a PWs (112) No. 8162/41 of 12 Nov 41\r\n\r\n14. The recaptured Soviet prisoners of war, even if they were delivered\r\nto police stations, must be turned over by them to the nearest prisoner\r\nof war camp. Considering the danger of spotted fever, isolation is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe camp commandant must find out in every individual case the cause\r\nfor escape. If the reason for the escape is only the longing for his\r\nfamily or hunger, and if the PW has not committed any crimes during his\r\nflight, then he is to be disciplined by the camp commandant and to be\r\nreturned to work.\r\n\r\n15. If a Soviet prisoner of war commits in camp on another prisoner\r\nof war murder, manslaughter or another crime, for which there is no\r\npunitive regulation in the German criminal code, which however demands\r\nthe most severe punishment (for instance cannibalism, to bring about\r\nincapability to work by self-mutilation), then the criminal is to be\r\nturned over to the secret state police [Gestapo]. Also in the case of\r\nother crimes by a Soviet prisoner of war (for instance during flight),\r\nthe camp commandant must turn over the criminal to the secret state\r\npolice unless he is convinced a disciplinary measure or the judicial\r\npunishment which is to be expected after interview with the judge of\r\nthe competent army court is sufficient to retain the discipline of the\r\ncamp. Punishment for disobedience is only possible if the prisoner of\r\nwar disobeys a _distinct_ order, given to _him_ and understood by _him_.\r\n\r\n16. In the case of every transfer to the secret state police the\r\nprisoner of war is to be discharged from captivity, and the transfer is\r\nto be reported to the armed forces information bureau if a registration\r\nhas already taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n  VII. _Funerals_:\r\n\r\nThe following shall apply to funerals of deceased prisoners of war:\r\n\r\n1. Funerals are to take place unobtrusively and in a simple manner.\r\nTreatment in the press radio or motion pictures is prohibited.\r\n\r\n2. A German military delegation will not be provided. Participation\r\nby comrades of the deceased, who belong to the same prisoner of war\r\nenclosure is permitted. Civilians may not participate.\r\n\r\n3. Gun salute will not be given.\r\n\r\n4. Wreaths of Soviet prisoners, may, if allowed, only carry black or\r\nwhite ribbons; no wreath may be deposited by Germans.\r\n\r\n5. Clergymen or their helpers may participate if they belong to the\r\ncamp itself; in the case of Mohammedans, religious servants may be\r\nbrought in if it is possible without special effort.\r\n\r\n6. Coffins are prescribed; however each corpse (without clothes, if\r\nthose are still in any way usable) is to be wrapped in strong paper or\r\notherwise appropriate material.\r\n\r\nIn the mass graves, the corpses are to be placed next to each other\r\nat a depth of the grave, usual at the locality, and they are to be\r\nequipped with an identification tag as always, so that it can be\r\ndetermined later on, with the aid of a card file, which corpses are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n7. In cemeteries, the graves are to be kept separate or at a proper\r\ndistance from other graves; in camp cemeteries, the sequence of graves\r\nof other prisoners of war may not be disturbed.\r\n\r\n8. If it is possible with special effort, cremation is permitted.\r\nIn this case also, the camp must keep lists. However, corpses of\r\nMohammedans must be interred in any case, and with the head facing\r\nEast, the face South.\r\n\r\n9. On the \"Interment of corpses of Soviet prisoners of war by the\r\ncommunities\", the decree IV e 10363/41, 3991 of 27 Oct 41 has been\r\nforwarded to them by the Reichsminister of the Interior.\r\n\r\n10.

Herewith I report most obediently that by\r\nthe careful forethought of the last few months I succeeded in making\r\nthe German Reichsbank so strong internally, so unassailable from the\r\noutside, that even the heaviest shocks of the international finance\r\nand credit system cannot touch us in any way. Meanwhile, I have quite\r\ninconspicuously transferred into gold all assets in any way available\r\nof the Reich Bank and the whole Germany economy abroad. Through the\r\nsuggestions I have worked out to keep down ruthlessly any non-vital\r\nconsumption and any public expenses and tasks of no importance to the\r\nwar. We will be in a position to satisfy all demands to be made on the\r\nfinances and economy without any serious shocks.\r\n\r\nAs the plenipotentiary general for economical affairs, called upon\r\nby you, my Fuehrer, I thought it my duty in this hour to submit this\r\nreport and this vow.\r\n\r\n  Heil my Fuehrer\r\n  WALTHER FUNK\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 701-PS\r\n\r\n  The Reich Minister of Justice 4410 b-Vs 1 379/43 g\r\n  Berlin W 8, Wilhelmstrasse 65 1 April 1943\r\n  Telephone 11 00 44\r\n  Long Distance 11 65 16\r\n\r\n To The Public Prosecutors of the Courts of Appeal,\r\n\r\n To the Commissioner of the Reich Minister of Justice for the penal\r\n camps in Emsland.\r\n\r\n  _PAPENBURG_ (_Ems_)\r\n\r\n Regarding: Poles and Jews who are released from the penal institutions\r\n of the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nInstructions for the independent penal institutions.\r\n\r\n1.

This ruling replaces the hitherto ordered return of all Polish\r\nprisoners undergoing imprisonment in the Old Reich condemned in annexed\r\nEastern territories.

Various\r\nmeasures have had an aggravating effect on the political developments,\r\nprimarily the compulsory labor and service conscription in Flanders and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe development of the conscription situation makes it necessary to\r\nhave larger procurement programs organized even in Germanic regions.\r\nAll Germans--with the exception of the Flemish--are collected in one\r\nGerman association. The Flemish remain in the \"Langemarck\" regiment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the \"Prinz Eugen\" division has been transferred to Croatia.\r\nFurthermore a Croatian legion is to be activated here, which is to be\r\nunder the command of SS-Gruppenfuehrer Phleps.\r\n\r\nOf great importance is the fact that the Fuehrer has assented to the\r\nactivation of an SS-Standart of French volunteers, which is to be\r\ncalled the \"Karl der Grosse\" standart.\r\n\r\n_Norway_: Meanwhile in Norway Minister Fuglesang has succeeded the\r\nlate Minister Lunde after the latter's unfortunate demise. In spite\r\nof promises made by the Quisling Party, one cannot count on Norway\r\nsupplying a contingent of appreciable size.\r\n\r\n_Denmark_: In Denmark the situation is especially favorable since\r\nSS-Gruppenfuehrer Dr Best has taken over the control. One can be sure\r\nthat here SS-Gruppenfuehrer Dr Best will offer a good example of\r\nnational Reich politics.\r\n\r\nThe situation in regard to Parteifuehrer Clausen has had unfavorable\r\ndevelopments recently. Clausen agreed to the plan of activating a\r\ncombat corps as introduction to the German Schutzstaffel in Denmark\r\nonly on the supposition that membership in this corps would exclude\r\nmembership in the Party. Negotiations for this very necessary\r\ncollecting organization of the combat corps go on apace. The\r\nmonopolistic position of the Party is not tenable; all recruits must be\r\nbrought in, even if Clausen himself--however without his clique--is to\r\nstand in the foreground.\r\n\r\n_Netherlands_: Meanwhile Reich Commissioner Dr. Seyss-Inquart has\r\nproclaimed Mussert leader of the Netherland people. This measure has\r\nhad an extremely disturbing effect on the other Germanic countries,\r\nespecially in Flanders. The decisive role devolves again on the General\r\nCommissariat, whose principle of using Mussert too much, in order to\r\ndisregard him, must be rejected on the part of German Reich policy in\r\nthe sense of the Schutzstaffel.\r\n\r\n_Flanders_: In Flanders the recent developments of the VNV have\r\nbecome even more unfavorable. Even the very clever policy of the new\r\nVNV-leader, Dr Elias, has been a disappointment; Dr Elias, moreover,\r\nonce stated the opinion that Germany was ready for concessions in the\r\nnatural political sphere, only when matters were going very badly for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nRecently the Walloon question has been particularly accentuated. Leon\r\nDegrelle, who was a lieutenant in the Walloon Legion and earned there\r\nthe Iron Cross First Class, is at present in Belgium and uses this\r\ntime in testing the political barometer in all quarters. Degrelle's\r\nintention of founding a Wallonian Allgemeine SS has been rejected.\r\nJudging by the connection between religion and politics, it appears in\r\nDegrelle's case that he is a Frenchman in his thinking.\r\n\r\nA favorable development has occurred in the case of the Flemish\r\nArbeitsdienst. The negotiations carried out by the Reichsarbeitsfuehrer\r\nand especially by Oberstarbeitsfuehrer Mueller-Brandenburg with the\r\nassent of the Reichsfuehrer SS have had as a result that on the 1 April\r\n1943 labor duty becomes obligatory in Belgium, both in the Flemish and\r\nWallonian sectors. To bridge the gap students and apprentice officials\r\nwere inducted into the Labor Service on the 15 Jan 43.\r\n\r\n_Finland_: In Finland Field Marshal Mannerheim has been proposed as\r\nsuccessor to the national presidency.\r\n\r\nIn correspondence with General Talvela particular discretion is\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nJust now wounded Finns (Officers, NCO's, men and Lottas) are in Germany\r\nas guests of the Reichsfuehrer-SS. This caring for the wounded has\r\nproved itself quite essential.\r\n\r\n_Southeast_: Meanwhile in the southwest all volunteers from the Germans\r\nresiding outside the Reich have been assigned to the SS.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, as has been previously stated, there are difficulties in\r\nregard to the procuring of the necessary bills of exchange for the\r\nmaintenance of the families of inducted volunteers. The suggestions of\r\nthe Hungarian government are always only patch-work.\r\n\r\nIn general a strong violence manifests itself in the southeast as\r\na consequence of the general military situation, and doubtless one\r\nmust count on the existence of a certain sympathy with hostile powers\r\nthrough the Vatican.\r\n\r\nAfter the order of the 12 August 42 by Reichsleiter Bormann regarding\r\nthe competence of the Reichsfuehrer-SS in all German matters and\r\nthe strict supervision of all Party units had been issued, a similar\r\ndecree was prepared by Reich Minister Dr Lammers for the sphere of the\r\nState, which is soon to be issued. The new formulation demands even\r\nin sectors of the state the right of the Reichsfuehrer SS to a joint\r\nstipulation in fundamental national questions, that is to say, the\r\nReich commissioners are to consult with the Reichsfuehrer SS in all\r\nactually fundamental questions regarding the nation.\r\n\r\nSS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Dr Riedweg reports again on questions of\r\nterminology which had been mentioned in the internal labor conference\r\nof the German Leitstelle in Copenhagen. Principally this terminology\r\nconcerns the conceptions \"Reich\", \"Nation\", \"Volk\" and \"Stamm\", as well\r\nas \"nordisch\" and \"germanisch\".\r\n\r\nIn agreement with the Ahnenerbe office it was determined that the\r\nconcept \"Reich\" is to remain reserved for the whole Reich of all German\r\nraces and people. For Germany the official expression \"Deutsches Reich\"\r\nis to be used.\r\n\r\n\"Nation\", being a concept stamped predominantly by liberalism, is no\r\nlonger to be applied to the German peoples.\r\n\r\nDifficulties arise also in differentiating between the concept \"Stamm\"\r\nand \"Volk\". The expression \"Volk\" is whenever possible to include the\r\nwhole German area.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Stamm\", where it applies, is to be used for countries.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the definition of the term \"nordisch\" and \"germanisch\",\r\nthe first expression must be used less and less. With the expression\r\n\"nordisch\", too high a position has been granted Norway, Sweden and\r\nDenmark at the expense of the west Germans.\r\n\r\nSS-Standartenfuehrer Sievers of the Ahnenerbe office states again the\r\nimportance of the December conference of Office VI and reports on the\r\nconference of the scientific committee, which has been concluded there.\r\nA conference on the German historical work took place in the RSHA.\r\n\r\nSS-Standartenfuehrer Loerner reports on an inventory of finances and\r\naffirms that a new agreement has been reached between the Reichs\r\nTreasurer and the Economic Administrative Office.\r\n\r\nSS-Standartenfuehrer Schmidt still wishes a condensation of the\r\nbureaus on Flanders for the simplification of the work, in particular\r\nshifting the Antwerp bureau to Brussels. In addition he reports on the\r\ncontinuous difficulties in the work of family maintenance especially in\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 707-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET!\r\n\r\n  The Fuehrer of the Reich\r\n  Head of the main office\r\n  VS-diary, number 507/44 secret\r\n  CdSSHA/Be/We.

Work may already be done in these museums, and\r\nProfessor Dr. Jankuhn proposes to set up a complete registration, by\r\nway of drawings and photography, of all prehistoric findings.\r\n\r\nI am following a suggestion of Professor Dr. Herbert Jankuhn in\r\nasking you whether you would be willing to take over this job, mainly\r\nregarding Eastern European prehistoric problems, which ought to be of\r\nparticular interest to you. In case you would accept, I would like you\r\nto let me know when you could start working, and what should have to be\r\ndone in order to secure your leave.\r\n\r\nSS-Captain Professor Dr. Herbert Jankuhn shall return to Germany by\r\nthe beginning of December. Therefore it will be possible without\r\ndifficulties to discuss then all pertinent questions during a personal\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  signed: Sievers\r\n  Lt Col of the SS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Leader of the Staff\r\n\r\n  Entered Jan. 20, 1944/185\r\n  Berlin, Jan. 14, 1944\r\n  H.A. II-Dr. Z/Do.\r\n\r\n  File note for the Leader of the Staff.\r\n\r\n Subject: Reply with regard to the letters of the captain in the SS\r\n Jankuhn to the Personal Staff of the Reich Fuehrer of SS Office for\r\n the Ancestral Heritage, dates August 12, 13, and 22, 1943, respecting\r\n the evacuation and destruction of the Charkow Museum.\r\n\r\nThe criticism, which the captain in the SS delivers against the Special\r\nPurpose Staff for very evident reasons, can readily be answered,\r\nbecause he states things without any closer investigation, that should\r\ndisparage the work of the Special Purpose Staff and the Office devoted\r\nto pre- and early historic research, because this latter work is\r\napparently inconvenient to him.\r\n\r\nIn his letter of 13 August 1943, J. had forgotten to mention that the\r\ncaptain who had rebuilt the museum for prehistoric art was in fact a\r\ndeputy of the Special Purpose Staff, namely, First Lieutenant Mueller,\r\nwho by means of truly untiring and objective work during his free time\r\nhad set up the museum to such an extent that it could again be opened\r\nto the public. The museum was visited by numerous officers and men,\r\nalso by units of the Armed SS and the police. A thorough inventory had\r\nbeen taken, also many photographic copies were on hand. Thus First\r\nLieutenant Mueller had performed a gratifying task in time of war which\r\nwas generally recognized by the leaders of the units stationed in\r\nCharkow. The report of Jankuhn does not make any reference at all to\r\nthis work of the Special Purpose Staff.\r\n\r\nOn 6 February 1943, the command was given for the first evacuation of\r\nthe city. The Special Purpose Staff had then through untiring effort\r\nbrought out the most valuable prizes of the museum; on 9 February\r\nit was necessary for the last members of the office to leave the\r\ncity, which already had been almost abandoned by German troops. It\r\nwas impossible at that time to bring out all the material, because\r\nthe transportation situation did not permit this. It was not really\r\nnecessary for SS leader Jahnkuhn to point out that these objects were\r\nimportant and worthy of being brought to safety. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, one must also consider the transportation problems that\r\narise at the time of the evacuation of a city. It is evident that at\r\nsuch a time military transports receive unqualified priority, that\r\neven the most valuable possessions of culture cannot take precedence\r\nover them. Yet the Special Purpose Staff was able to salvage the most\r\nimportant articles of the museum. The remainder was entrusted to the\r\ncare of the former curator of the museum, Professor Rudenski. Of this\r\nbalance, again the most valuable was walled up within the enclosures of\r\na bomb-proof cellar. For several days Professor Rudenski succeeded in\r\nsaving the building from being blown up as intended. Finally, however,\r\non the evening of February 14, 1943, as related by Professor Rudenski,\r\nby an oversight of a command of the Waffen SS, a fire broke out in\r\nthe building and it burned down to the ground. Yet, later on, a large\r\nportion of the valuables from the cellar was salvaged again. However,\r\na Gothic sword was missing. Now, as alleged by Jankuhn, it turns out\r\nthat this sword was preserved by a unit of the Waffen SS.\r\n\r\nCaptain of the SS J. could have easily learned of these facts, if he\r\nhad taken the trouble to contact the competent labor group Ukraine of\r\nthe Special Purpose Staff and not Prof. Hornung, who had been installed\r\nin an entirely different district and who knew nothing about the\r\ndevelopments in Charkow. At least he would not have exposed himself to\r\nthe charge that he frivolously and without closer examination of the\r\ncircumstances had claimed \"that the Special Purpose Staff had not done\r\nthe least for the preservation of the things that were found.\" The\r\ncontrary is true.\r\n\r\nAfter the recapture of the city, the valuables were reclaimed from the\r\nwreckage and the museum was opened again to the public on July 19,\r\n1943. Thus it was proved anew that the Special Purpose Staff had done\r\neverything in the way of securing possessions of great cultural value\r\nand preserving them in the interests of the German administration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the second loss of Charkow in August 1943 rendered\r\nthe work of restoration null and void. On August 6 the working staff\r\nreceived an evacuation summons with the order to leave Charkow\r\nimmediately and without delay. Conditions affecting transportation were\r\nthe same as in spring. If, indeed, valuable military installations had\r\nto remain behind, it is clear that, above all, objects from a museum\r\nhad to remain behind. If the SS command had trucks at its disposal\r\nand could use the transportation facilities without consideration of\r\nmilitary needs for the objects of the museum, then this is certainly\r\na matter of very great appreciation. On the other hand, however, it\r\ncannot be charged to the Special Purpose Staff that it did not possess\r\nadequate transportation facilities. Nevertheless, the co-workers of the\r\nworking staff have done what they could in order to preserve the most\r\nimportant part of the picture collection. In two days, already under\r\nhostile action, a large portion of museum collections was examined for\r\nthe purpose of qualifying for transportation and then the selected\r\nassortment of 300 pictures of Western-European masters and Ukrainian\r\npainters and twenty-five costly Ukrainian carpets was packed and\r\nshipped. As already at an earlier date the most important collections\r\nof the museum, dealing with prehistoric art, had been carried off, the\r\nspecial command Jankuhn could only preserve third and fourth grade\r\npieces of which several could be found in Kiev and other places.\r\n\r\nThe Special Purpose Staff under these circumstances sees no occasion\r\nfor making any reproaches against the Special Command Jankuhn. If\r\none was able to have at one's disposal transportation facilities and\r\nmanpower in a more liberal manner, then it was easy to carry off\r\nlarger collections. That the Special Command J. had done this is\r\ngratefully acknowledged by the Special Purpose Command; since it is\r\nbeing taken for granted that the collection was saved for the owner,\r\nnamely, the Reichminister of the occupied Eastern districts and that\r\ncorrespondingly it is handed over to the Special Purpose Staff as\r\nthe deputy of civil affairs. The Special Purpose Staff asks for the\r\nnecessary action.\r\n\r\nThe staff command cannot rid itself of the impression that the Captain\r\nin the SS Jankuhn submitted his report frivolously on the basis of\r\none-sided information. If he had made inquiries at the proper places\r\nwithout doubt he would have arrived at a different conclusion. At this\r\njuncture it is necessary to take a firm stand for the protection of the\r\nco-workers of the Special Purpose Staff and to ward off strongly every\r\nattack of a bureau that does not clearly understand the conditions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it could have been expected that Captain in the SS J.\r\nwould have used the opportunity to get acquainted with the bureaus\r\nof the Special Purpose Staff and effected some cooperation. With the\r\ncooperation of both certainly more material could have been salvaged\r\nthan had been done regardless (of the handicaps).\r\n\r\n  signed: Utikal\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SS \"Ancestral Heritage\"\r\n  _Research Organization_\r\n  Waischenfeld/Oberfranken, October 6, 1943\r\n  To the Chief of the SS Central Bureau\r\n  SS Leader Berger, Berlin\r\n\r\n  Dear SS Leader!\r\n\r\nAlready on July * * * of this year the need arose to inform you about\r\nfrictions that developed between co-workers of the SS \"Ancestral\r\nHeritage\" Research Organization and the Special Purpose Staff R.R. in\r\nDnjepropetrowsk. In this connection I did not neglect to mention that\r\nReichminister Rosenberg complained that we had removed prehistoric\r\ndiscoveries from the Caukasus.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the picture, I am turning over to you as\r\nsupplement two reports from Captain in the SS (F) Jankuhn. They refer\r\nto the Museum in Charkow and they reveal with full clarity that the\r\nmen of the Special Purpose Staff R.R.--insofar as we have met them\r\nheretofore--lack the simple prerequisites for the work in the East,\r\nnamely, an unobjectionable, manly behavior.\r\n\r\nI am summarizing the two reports and, briefly, I am able to conclude:\r\n1. When the evacuation of Charkow became necessary in the winter of\r\n1942, the Special Purpose Staff R.R. left the city without having done\r\nanything for the salvage of the museum.\r\n\r\n2. On August 8, 1943 it became known that the possibility of a\r\nsurrender of Charkow existed. On August 11 at nine in the morning the\r\nlast man of the Special Purpose Staff R.R. left Charkow. Before August\r\n15 no one considered any evacuation possible. In reality, Charkow was\r\nnot evacuated until August 24. Not the least had been done for the\r\nsalvaging of the collections of the museum, even though the care for\r\nthe museum is in the hands of the Special Purpose Staff R.R. There were\r\neven documents on the desks, which leads one to believe that the men\r\nconcerned abandoned their work as quickly as possible. Captain in the\r\nSS Jankuhn thereupon packed up the treasures and ordered them to be\r\nshipped.\r\n\r\nThis behavior of the men of the Special Service Staff R.R. could\r\nobviously be described by the most appropriate terms, and we are not at\r\nall surprised, if just these people \"take a shot at\" the men of the SS\r\nReichsfuehrer, who really do nothing but fulfill the duties neglected\r\nby the former.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  SS Leader\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n To the personal staff of the Reich Fuehrer of SS\r\n\r\n Office of the SS \"Ancestral Heritage\" Research Organization, Berlin\r\n\r\n  Command Post Division\r\n  Std., September 25, 1943\r\n\r\n  Concerning the evacuation of the museum of Poltawa\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the evacuation of the city of Poltawa by\r\nSeptember 21, 1943, was anticipated, I intended to examine personally\r\nthe condition of the museum there and to order the necessary measures\r\nfor preserving them, should the need arise.\r\n\r\nSince the 03 of the division, SS Leader Daltweiler, had learned during\r\na stay in P. that the salvaging of the museum through a specialist\r\nofficer of the armed forces on the basis of a command from the O.B.,\r\nalready had begun, a trip to Poltawa was abandoned.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Signed: H.

He found that the museum\r\nbuilding had been burned down completely.\r\n\r\nSince the more valuable pieces had been salvaged--as was pointed out in\r\nthe report of December 8, 1943--no loss of more important objects of\r\nculture was sustained through the destruction of the museum.\r\n\r\n  Signed: H.

The exhibition is said to\r\nhave been good and well arranged. Besides collections of prehistoric\r\ncharacter there were to be found in the museum articles referring to\r\nfolklore. When, during the winter campaigns of the months of February\r\nand March, the Special Service Staff R.R. left the city without having\r\ndone the least for the saving of the collections. Merely a Gothic sword\r\nand a gold-plated handle are said to have been taken along by one SS\r\nunit. Since the salvaging of the piece was not effected through the\r\nSecurity Service Command in Charkow, it must be assumed that a unit of\r\nthe II SS armored corps took this gorgeous weapon along.\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat of the German troops, the museum was destroyed,\r\napparently by explosion of fire. The Ukrainian collections stored there\r\nwere destroyed almost completely.\r\n\r\nRecent excavations undertaken in the ruins of the building have yielded\r\nonly insignificant pieces of the material formerly stored there.\r\n\r\nThus one of the most important museums of Russia with collections of\r\ngreat cultural value was given over to destruction through the agencies\r\nof the German civil administration.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Jankuhn\r\n  Captain in the SS\r\n  For the correctness of this copy\r\n  SS Leader\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  IIa\r\n\r\n  Exhibit i\r\n\r\n  To the report of 12 August 1943\r\n\r\nThis Institute of Culture is confiscated by the Charkow garrison!\r\n\r\nIt is secured for the Special Command R.R. and is placed under its\r\nprofessional supervision.\r\n\r\nOutside of the rules for visit and use, it is forbidden to enter the\r\ninstitute, the taking of material is considered looting and will be\r\npunished as such.\r\n\r\nSpecial permits through the Special Command R.R.

On August 10,\r\n1943, I went in the company of an interpreter, SS Sergeant Jacobsen to\r\nCharkow. In the afternoon I reported to the commander of the D.K._V_.\r\nof the SIPO and the SD, Major Krauebitter, and informed him that I\r\nwas entrusted by the Reichfuehrer SS with the salvage of the museum\r\nin the field of operations of the Waffen SS on the Southern front.\r\nIn this connection I learned of the fate of the museum in Charkow\r\nduring the evacuation of Charkow in the beginning of 1943; a separate\r\nreport on that subject is being prepared. At the same time Major\r\nKrauebitter informed me that the KVR with the garrison of Charkow, who\r\nwas responsible for the museums had already left the city days ago. A\r\nfurther inquiry in the buildings of the bureau of the Special Purpose\r\nStaff R.R. revealed that this bureau already had left Charkow on the\r\nmorning of August 10. A survey of the museum in the company of Major\r\nKrauebitter revealed the following picture:\r\n\r\nThe Museum contains a small prehistoric department after the really\r\nprehistoric museum had been destroyed in the winter after failure of\r\nevacuation. Moreover, it contained a good collection of Ukrainian\r\nart of folklore character, small objects of ecclesiastical art,\r\nparticularly, however, mostly paintings of Ukrainian painters, as the\r\npictures of central- and west-European masters had been transported to\r\nGermany by the SD in 1942. The storehouse of the museum contains still\r\nnumerous pictures. The key to the museum was given to the Ukrainian\r\nlady superintendent by the Special Purpose Staff R.R., who also related\r\nthat at eight o'clock in the morning on October 8 a gentleman of the\r\nSpecial Purpose Staff R.R. had been in the museum and with several\r\npictures had quickly departed at 8:30 o'clock. As a matter of fact,\r\nsome pictures of the collection were missing, approximately 1%.\r\n\r\nAfter no one had taken steps toward any real preservation of the\r\nmuseum, neither among the garrison nor among the Special Purpose Staff\r\nR.R., which according to the poster, referred to as Exhibit I, was\r\nresponsible for the care of the collection, the packing was begun.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric findings--almost exclusively ceramics of the bronze\r\nage--were packed in two wooden boxes and shipped by a truck of the EKV;\r\nthey were to be sent from Kiev to Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit of Ukrainian popular art contained textiles, ceramics,\r\nglass, costumes, and objects of wood. The greater part is packed in two\r\nlarge wooden boxes and was shipped with the evacuation material of the\r\nEKV by rail to Dnjepropetrowsk. Among it was a large tapestry, which on\r\naccount of its size could not be packed.\r\n\r\nFrom the collection of paintings the most valuable pictures were\r\nselected and shipped by rail in the direction of Dnjepropetrowsk.\r\n\r\nThe documents that remained lying on the desk of the Special Purpose\r\nStaff R.R.--a work plan of the Special Purpose Staff R.R. signed by a\r\nsection chief Schmidt and a report on Ukrainian art--were saved and\r\nturned over to the EKV of the SIPO and the SD.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Jankuhn\r\n  Captain in the SS\r\n  For the correctness of this copy\r\n  SS Leader\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 710-PS\r\n\r\n  The Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich\r\n  Commissioner for the Four Year Plan\r\n  Chairman of the Ministerial Council for National Defense\r\n  Berlin, 31 July 1941\r\n\r\n To: The Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service;\r\n SS-Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich\r\n\r\nComplementing the task that was assigned to you on 24 January 1939,\r\nwhich dealt with the carrying out of emigration and evacuation, a\r\nsolution of the Jewish problem, as advantageous as possible, I\r\nhereby charge you with making all necessary preparations in regard to\r\norganizational and financial matters for bringing about a complete\r\nsolution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWherever other governmental agencies are involved, these are to\r\ncooperate with you.\r\n\r\nI charge you furthermore to send me, before long, an overall plan\r\nconcerning the organizational, factual and material measures necessary\r\nfor the accomplishment of the desired solution of the Jewish question.\r\n\r\n  signed:      GOERING\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 728-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  DRAFT\r\n  Ambassador RITTER No. 444, SALZBURG, 20 June 1944\r\n\r\n 1. To Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces With reference\r\n to your correspondence of 15 June 1944, Nr.\r\n\r\n WFSt/Qu. (Verw.) Nr. 771793/44 gKChefs. II. Ang., concerning the\r\n treatment of enemy terror-aviators.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obvious objections, founded on international law and\r\nforeign politics, the Foreign Office is basically in agreement with the\r\nproposed measures.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the individual cases a distinction must be made\r\nbetween the cases of lynching and the cases of special treatment by the\r\nS.D. [Security Service].\r\n\r\nI. In the cases of lynching, the precise establishment of the\r\ncircumstances deserving punishment, according to points 1-4 of the\r\ncommunication of 15 June, is not very essential. First, the German\r\nauthorities are not directly responsible, since death had occurred,\r\nbefore a German official became concerned with the case. Furthermore,\r\nthe accompanying circumstances will be such, that it will not be\r\ndifficult to depict the case in an appropriate manner upon publication.\r\nHence, in cases of lynching, it will be of primary importance correctly\r\nto handle the individual case upon publication.\r\n\r\nII. The suggested procedure for special treatment by the S.D. including\r\nsubsequent publication, would be tenable, only if Germany, on this\r\noccasion simultaneously would openly repudiate the commitment of\r\nInternational Law, presently in force and still recognized by Germany.\r\nWhen an enemy aviator is seized by the Army or by the Police, and is\r\ndelivered to the Air Forces (P.W.) Reception Camp Oberursel, he has\r\nreceived, by this very fact, the legal status of a prisoner of war.\r\nThe Prisoner of War Treaty of 27 July 1929 establishes definite rules\r\non the prosecution and sentencing of the Prisoner of War, and the\r\nexecution of the death penalty, as for example in Article 66: Death\r\nsentences may be carried out only three months after the protective\r\npower has been notified of the sentence; in Article 63: a prisoner of\r\nwar will be tried only by the same courts and under the same procedure\r\nas members of the German Armed Forces. These rules are so specific,\r\nthat it would be futile to try to cover up any violation of them by\r\nclever wording of the publication of an individual incident. On the\r\nother hand, the Foreign Office cannot recommend on this occasion a\r\nformal repudiation of the Prisoner of War Treaty.\r\n\r\nAn emergency solution would be to prevent suspected fliers from ever\r\nattaining a legal Prisoner of War status, that is, that immediately\r\nupon seizure they be told that they are not considered Prisoners\r\nof War but criminals, that they would not be turned over to the\r\nagencies having jurisdiction over Prisoners of War; hence not to go\r\nto a Prisoner of War Camp; but that they would be delivered to the\r\nauthorities in charge of the prosecution of criminal acts and that\r\nthey would be tried in a summary proceeding. If the evidence at the\r\ntrial should reveal that the special procedure is not applicable to\r\na particular case, the fliers concerned may subsequently be given\r\nthe status of Prisoner of War by transfer to the Air Forces (P.W.)\r\nReception Camp Oberursel. Naturally, not even this expedient will\r\nprevent the possibility that Germany will be accused of the violation\r\nof existing treaties and maybe not even the adoption of reprisals\r\nupon German prisoners of war. At any rate this solution would enable\r\nus clearly to define our attitude, thus relieving us of the necessity\r\nof openly having to renounce the present agreements or of the need of\r\nhaving to use excuses, which no one would believe, upon the publication\r\nof each individual case.\r\n\r\nOf the acts deemed crimes listed under 1-4 by the letter of 15 June, we\r\nnote that those listed under 1 and 4 are legally unobjectionable. Those\r\nunder 2 and 3 are not. The Foreign Office, however, would be willing\r\nto disregard this. Perhaps it would be preferable to combine Nos.\r\n1, 3, and 4 to the effect that all strafing attacks on the civilian\r\npopulation by an aviator will be dealt with as crimes. The various\r\nfacts under 1, 3 and 4 would then be significant only as especially\r\noutstanding examples. The Foreign Office sees no reason why such\r\nattacks should not be expiated, when they are directed against the\r\ncivilian population in ordinary dwelling houses, in automobiles, on\r\nriverboats, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office bases its opinion on the fact that it is altogether\r\nforbidden to German fliers to strafe the civilian population during\r\ntheir attacks in England. According to information received by the\r\nForeign Office, such an order was issued some time ago by the Supreme\r\nCommander of the Air Forces. In case of general publication, the\r\nexistence of such an order could be pointed out.\r\n\r\nIII. It follows from the above, that the main weight of the action will\r\nhave to be placed on lynchings. Should the campaign be carried out\r\nto such an extent that the purpose, to wit: \"the deterrence of enemy\r\naviators\" is actually achieved, which goal is favored by the Foreign\r\nOffice, then the strafing attacks by enemy fliers upon the civilian\r\npopulations must be stressed in a completely different propagandist\r\nmanner than heretofore; if not in the publicity for home consumption,\r\nthen certainly in the propaganda directed to foreign countries. The\r\npertinent German local departments, most likely the police, would\r\nhave to be informed immediately to submit a short, truthful report to\r\na central depository in Berlin giving particulars as to place, time,\r\nnumber of dead and wounded.\r\n\r\nThis central depository would at once forward these reports to the\r\nForeign Office for exploitation. Since similar strafing attacks upon\r\ncivilian populations have occurred in other countries, for example, in\r\nFrance, Belgium, Croatia and Rumania, the pertinent German departments\r\nor the governments in these countries are to be directed to collect\r\nthe instances of such strafing attacks against the civilian population\r\nin the same manner and to exploit them propagandistically in foreign\r\ncountries, in collaboration with German offices.\r\n\r\nIV. In the letter of 15 June the intention was communicated that\r\nuntil further notice, an understanding with the Foreign Office would\r\nhave to be reached prior to any publication. The Foreign Office\r\nattaches particular value to this point and also to the fact that this\r\nunderstanding be reached, not only until further notice, but for the\r\nentire duration of the campaign.\r\n\r\nBy order\r\n\r\n  (signed) RITTER [crossed out]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 729-PS\r\n\r\n  [Handwritten note:]\r\n  20 June\r\n  Chief of Supreme Command of Armed Forces (Chef/OKW)\r\n  K [Keitel]\r\n  Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  Nr.771793/44 gKChefs.II.Ang., WFSt/Qu.

Low-level aerial attacks upon the civilian population--upon\r\n individuals as well as upon groups.\r\n\r\n 2.

Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner informed the deputy Chief of\r\nWFSt in Klessheim on the afternoon of 6.6, that a conference on this\r\nquestion had been held shortly before between the Reich Marshall,\r\nthe Reich Foreign Minister and the Reichsfuehrer SS. Contrary to the\r\noriginal suggestion made by the Reich Foreign Minister who wished to\r\ninclude every type of terror attack on the German civilian population,\r\nthat is, also bombing attacks on cities, it was agreed in the above\r\nconference that merely those attacks carried out with A/C armament,\r\naimed directly at the civilian population and their property, should\r\nbe taken as the standard for the evidence of a criminal action in this\r\nsense. Lynch law would have to be the rule. On the contrary, there\r\nhas been no question of court martial sentence or handing over to the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n2. Deputy Chief of WFSt stated the following:\r\n\r\na. First and foremost, following the lines of the generally distributed\r\ndeclaration made by Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels and numerous press\r\nnotices written in the same vein, it is essential to announce any\r\ndefinitely established incident of this kind giving the names and\r\nunits of the aviators, the place the incident occurred and any other\r\nrelevant facts. The purpose of this would be to make clear the serious\r\nintentions of the Germans in the face of disbelieving enemy propaganda\r\nand especially to discourage effectively any further murderous action\r\nagainst our civilian population. Therefore the question is whether the\r\nSD knows of such a case or whether the necessary proof is available\r\nfrom which to construct a case like this with the required statements.\r\nObergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner replied to both in the negative.\r\n\r\nb. Deputy Chief of the WFSt mentioned that, apart from Lynch law, a\r\nprocedure must be worked out for segregating those enemy aviators, who\r\nare suspected of criminal action of this kind, until they are received\r\ninto the Reception Camp for aviators at Oberursel; if the suspicion was\r\nconfirmed, they would be handed over to the SD for special treatment.\r\n\r\n For this purpose the WFSt would cooperate with the Supreme Command of\r\n the Air Force to set out the necessary regulations for the use of the\r\n head of the camp at Oberursel.\r\n\r\n Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner expressed his complete agreement with\r\n this view and that the SD take charge of those aviators segregated.\r\n\r\nc. On the question of making announcements, it is settled that, for the\r\npresent, agreement should be reached in every case between OKW/WFSt,\r\nOKL, and the Reichsfuehrer SS to decide the form that the announcement\r\nshould take.\r\n\r\n The participation of the Foreign office is to be assured by the WFSt.\r\n\r\n3. At a conference with Colonel von Brauchitsch (C-in-C Air Force) on\r\n6.6, it was settled that the following actions were to be regarded as\r\nterror-action, justifying Lynch law.\r\n\r\na. Low level attacks with aircraft armament on the civilian population,\r\nsingle persons as well as crowds.\r\n\r\nb. Shooting on our own (German) air crews in the air who have bailed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nc. Attacks with aircraft armament on passenger trains in the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nd. Attacks with aircraft armament on military hospitals, hospitals and\r\nhospital-trains which are clearly marked with the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Reception camp for aviators at Oberursel will be\r\ninformed of these facts given in Section 3 above. If the facts of any\r\ncase of this kind are established on examination, the prisoners are to\r\nbe handed over to the SD. Colonel von Brauchitsch declared, at the\r\nend, that another report to the Reich Marshall on this subject would be\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n  sgd.

Pursuant to the order of the Chief of the Staff of the Armed Forces\r\nand Deputy Chief of the Command Staff of the Armed Forces the following\r\nis decreed:\r\n\r\n1. It is to be ascertained from the Reichfuehrer SS through SS Major\r\nGrothmann whether and in what form the information given by the Fuehrer\r\nto the Reichfuehrer SS, that in one or more instances fliers, who had\r\nbeen shot down during strafing attacks on the population, had been\r\nlynched by the latter, has meanwhile gone out. If the answer should be\r\n\"no\", in what manner does the Reichfuehrer intend to proceed in the\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n2. From the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces (Colonel von\r\nBrauchitsch) it is to be ascertained what specific acts of enemy fliers\r\nare to be considered and handled as deserving death according to the\r\nopinion of the Reichsmarshall. Reference to this: The 4 points of the\r\nmemorandum [731-PS] by the Chief of the Command Staff of the Armed\r\nForces (Chef, WFst.) of 20-22 May based on the information of General\r\nKorten after report of the Reichsmarshall. [L-166, par. 20] * * *\r\n\r\n3. After the clarification of point 2, the preparation of a directive\r\nto the Commandant of the camp at Oberursel stating in what cases\r\nthe prisoners are to be turned over to the SD, specifying in a more\r\ndetailed manner the cases which are to be treated as deserving\r\nof death, and the points of view which are to be followed in the\r\nsubsequent procedure. Reference relative to this: Statement of Colonel\r\nvon Brauchitsch according to the notes of 26 May.\r\n\r\nThis directive is to be prepared only in two copies and, after\r\nconsultation with Colonel von Brauchitsch, it is to be forwarded to\r\nthe Commander in Chief of the Air Forces with the instructions to\r\ncommunicate it to the commandant of the camp at Oberursel orally only.\r\n\r\n4. It is to be ascertained from the Chief of the Armed Forces\r\nPropaganda whether he has any information concerning any new steps\r\ntaken in this matter by the Reichfuehrer SS.\r\n\r\n5. In accordance with the instructions issued in the evening of 3 June,\r\nby the Chief of the Command Staff of the Armed Forces, the Foreign\r\nOffice is to be informed of the situation in the evening with the\r\nfollowing purposes in view:\r\n\r\na. That the formulation of the notices of the Reich Fuehrer SS and the\r\nother measures should be undertaken in an appropriate manner and in\r\naccord with the Foreign Office; and\r\n\r\nb. To be prepared in advance against protests by the enemy powers, so\r\nas to be in a position to answer them immediately, and thus to prevent\r\noccurrences such as those which took place in connection with the\r\nescape of the Anglo-American aviators from camp Sagan.\r\n\r\nAmbassador Ritter has been already notified accordingly by the Chief of\r\nthe Command Staff of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nII. It was impossible to clarify points 1 and 2 (in this connection\r\npoint 3 as well) until 23 hours since neither Colonel von Brauchitsch\r\nnor an SS officer on the Command Staff Bergwald could be contacted. A\r\ntelephone conference with Major Grothmann has been agreed upon for 4\r\nJune at 10:00 o'clock.\r\n\r\n  Distribution:\r\n  Deputy Chief of the\r\n  Command Staff of\r\n  the Armed Forces      Copy No. 1 [pencilled notation]\r\n  Qu.

Of the _Soviet prisoners of war in our hands_--with the exception of\r\nthose of Finland, Norway and those who are employed in T/O positions\r\nby the troops, 200,000 prisoners of war fit for coal mining are to be\r\ntransferred immediately as the first installment by 1 Sept 43 by the\r\nplenipotentiary general for labor allocation with the consent of the\r\nchief, supreme command armed forces (AWA/chief prisoner of war affairs)\r\ntrainload by trainload. As far as necessary the GBA (plenipotentiary\r\nfor manpower) will provide substitutes.\r\n\r\n2. In case of the _receipt of new Soviet prisoners of war_, the\r\nrequirements of the coal mining industry have absolute priority over\r\nall other demands until further notice.\r\n\r\nAll prisoners of war, captured since 5 July 43 in the East, are to\r\nbe sent to camps of the supreme command armed forces, and from there\r\nthey are to be made available immediately or by exchange with other\r\nconsumers to the plenipotentiary for labor allocation for use in the\r\ncoal mining industry; the chairman of the national coal association has\r\nthe immediate right of choice already in the prisoner of war camps of\r\nthe supreme command armed forces area with the aid of his agencies.\r\n\r\n3. Soviet professional coal miners are to be sent without exception\r\nfrom all prisoners of war allocation points according to their\r\nvocational training to the plenipotentiary for labor allocation against\r\nreplacements for use in mining.\r\n\r\n4. All male prisoners, from 16 to 55 years age, captured in _guerilla\r\nfighting_ in the operational area, the army area, the Eastern\r\ncommissariats, the Government General and the Balkans, will in the\r\nfuture be considered prisoners of war. The same applies to those males\r\nin the newly conquered territories of the East. They are to be sent\r\nto prisoner of war camps, and are to be brought from there for labor\r\nallocation in the Reich.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the army general staff and the Reichsfuehrer SS after\r\nconsultation will issue within their jurisdiction the necessary\r\ndirectives on the conscription and further treatment of family members.\r\n\r\nFor presentation to the Fuehrer, the chief of the affairs of prisoners\r\nof war reports to me _every ten days_ on the development of the action,\r\nT. _for the first time of 25 July 43_ as of 20 July 43.\r\n\r\n  Keitel [signed in ink]\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n\r\n Army General Staff\r\n\r\n Supreme Commander Airforce\r\n\r\n Airforce General Staff\r\n\r\n Chief of army armament and Commander of the replacement army\r\n\r\n General armed forces operation office (AWA) chief of prisoner of war\r\n affairs\r\n\r\n Reichsfuehrer SS and chief of German Police\r\n\r\n Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan, attention State Secretary\r\n Koerner\r\n\r\n Reichminister for armament and nutritions\r\n\r\n Chairman of the Reich coal association [Reichsvereinigung Kohle] State\r\n councillor Pleiger.\r\n\r\nThe necessary information of further agencies, who are also concerned\r\nwill be given by AWA with the consent of the plenipotentiary for labor\r\nallocation (GBA).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The Reichsfuehrer SS    Field Headquarters\r\n  5 Aug 1943\r\n  Adjutant Journal No. 891/43 secret\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Manpower for coal mining industry.\r\n\r\n _Reference_: Letter of the command staff of the Reichsfuehrer\r\n SS--journal No. Ia/1909/43 secret.\r\n\r\n  Secret\r\n\r\n 1.

Only by this\r\nmethod can it be prevented, that the Russians with strong forces, aided\r\nby these homes and the people, familiar with the terrain, follow our\r\nwithdrawal operations during this winter and shortly appear in front\r\nof our position in Lyngen.

A large part of the small\r\nNorwegian ships which are kept hidden at present can be used for this\r\nand can later also be used for our own transportation needs.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the formation of guerilla bands on the part of the\r\nNorwegians appears to be negligible since they can no longer use the\r\nhouses during the winter.\r\n\r\n  I.A.

For the handling of these actions the following directions are\r\nissued:\r\n\r\n1. The chiefs of the State Police Offices or their deputies will\r\nimmediately after receipt of this teletype message establish telephone\r\ncontact with the political leadership offices--Gau Directorate or\r\nKreis Directorate--within their region and arrange a conference about\r\nthe handling of the demonstrations. The respective inspectors and\r\ncommanders of the Order Police are to participate in the conference.\r\nIn this conference the political leadership offices are to be informed\r\nthat the German police have received the following directives from\r\nthe Reichsfuehrer of the SS and Chief of the German Police, which\r\ndirectives are to be conformed to by the political leadership offices\r\nin an appropriate manner:\r\n\r\n_a._ Only such measures may be taken which do not jeopardize German\r\nlife or property (for instance, burning of synagogues only if there is\r\nno danger of fires for the neighborhood).\r\n\r\n_b._ Business establishments and homes of Jews may be destroyed but not\r\nlooted. The police have been instructed to supervise the execution of\r\nthese directives and to arrest looters.\r\n\r\n_c._ In business streets special case is to be taken that non-Jewish\r\nestablishments will be safeguarded at all cost against damage.\r\n\r\n_d._ Subjects of foreign countries may not be molested even if they are\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n2. Under the provision that the directives given under No. 1 are being\r\ncomplied with, the demonstrations are not to be prevented but merely\r\nsupervised regarding compliance with the directives.\r\n\r\n3. Immediately after receipt of this teletype the archives of the\r\nJewish communities are to be confiscated by the police, so that they\r\nwill not be destroyed in the course of the demonstrations. Important in\r\nthis respect is historically valuable material, not recent tax lists,\r\netc. The archives are to be delivered to the respective SD Office.\r\n\r\n4. The direction of the measures of the Safety Police regarding the\r\ndemonstrations against Jews is in the hands of the State Police\r\nOffices, in as much as the inspectors of the Safety Police do not issue\r\ndifferent directives. For the performance of the measures of the Safety\r\nPolice, officers of the criminal police as well as members of the SD,\r\nthe special troops and the SS, may be used.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the events of this night permit the use of the designated\r\nofficers, as many Jews, particularly wealthy ones, as the local jails\r\nwill hold, are to be arrested in all districts. Initially only healthy\r\nmale Jews, not too old, are to be arrested. After the arrests have\r\nbeen carried out the appropriate concentration camp is to be contacted\r\nimmediately with a view to a quick transfer of the Jews to the camps.\r\nSpecial care is to be taken that Jews arrested on the basis of this\r\ndirective will not be mistreated.\r\n\r\n6. The content of this order is to be communicated to the respective\r\ninspectors and commanders of the Order Police and to the SD Chief\r\nSectors and the SD Sub-Sectors with the notification that these police\r\nmeasures have been issued by the Reichsfuehrer of the SS and the Chief\r\nof the German Police. The Chief of the Order Police issues appropriate\r\norders to the Fire Department Police. The Safety Police and the Order\r\nPolice are to work in closest coordination in the execution of these\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this teletype is to be confirmed by the State Police\r\nDirector or a deputy via teletype to the Secret State Police Office\r\ninto the hands of SS Colonel [Standartenfuehrer] Muller.\r\n\r\n  Signed:      HEYDRICH\r\n  SS General [Gruppenfuehrer]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 775-PS\r\n\r\n  [Memorandum of Minister of Interior concerning\r\n  the Clarification of Police Matters, 1935]\r\n\r\nAs chief of the department of police in the Reich and Prussian ministry\r\nof the interior, I have noticed lately an ever increasing internal\r\npolitical tension which makes a clarification of authority both as\r\nregards the general police and more especially the political police,\r\nevidently urgently necessary.\r\n\r\n1. Fight against the Church\r\n\r\nThe Reich minister of the interior is the competent authority for\r\ngeneral rules on confessional policy. Therefore, the leaders of the\r\ndiverse confessional groups address their petitions to our office.\r\nLately, half of the political police reports concerned clerical\r\nmatters. We have untold petitions from all kinds of cardinals, bishops,\r\nand dignitaries of the church. Most of these complaints concern matters\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, although\r\nthe respective rules were not decreed by it. It happens very often that\r\nwe have in our capacity as a court of appeal to settle incidents, about\r\nwhich sometimes we know nothing at all until we receive the complaint.\r\nThere does not seem to be any unity any longer between our principles\r\nas regards political, ecclesiastical matters and the executives thereof\r\nin the states. It is an inexcusable state of affairs to give directions\r\nto complainants and make promises to ecclesiastical leaders, if there\r\nis no reliability of their being carried out in the states. Therefore,\r\nI deem it an absolute necessity that full clarification be given\r\non this controversial philosophical matter not only as regards the\r\n_principles but also the execution thereof_.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that, in my opinion, these principles should\r\nbe both considered and executed not only from an internal political,\r\nbut also from the foreign political viewpoint. I enclose an encyclical\r\nof the Pope that was submitted to me today. The question arises for\r\ninstance as to whether the manner of treatment of returning Catholic\r\nyoung people in front of Swiss customs guards has something to do with\r\nthe unfavorable foreign political commentaries which have been evoked\r\nby this action by the political police.\r\n\r\nThis concerns not only the political police; the whole police force\r\nas such will be implicated by the consequences resulting from the\r\nreligious struggle. Instances of gross disturbance of congregations are\r\nmounting terribly fast lately, often necessitating intervention of the\r\nemergency squad. In the long run I cannot carry the responsibility,\r\nfor officials will become involved and be forced to support one party\r\nor the other. The struggle [Kampfzeit] is so recent that we know from\r\nour own experience that in the end the police official will be blamed\r\nquite often for everything by both warring parties. After discarding\r\nthe rubber truncheon, the idea of exposing executive officials to\r\nsituations in which, during gross interruption of meetings, they may be\r\nforced to use cold steel, is unbearable.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that everything must be done to prevent the wearing\r\nout of the police force as well as the state authority in general with\r\nan untimely religious struggle. Should this philosophical conflict\r\ncontinue I would be forced,--incidentally this was proposed to me in a\r\nletter from the chief of the Gestapo, to give lectures to the police\r\nofficials on Christian religions or the particular importance of the\r\nreligious movement and the attitude of the party to these.\r\n\r\nNeither do I believe that it is desirable if the lower grade police\r\nauthorities carry out the handling and reporting of these religious\r\nmatters in a certain one-sided manner.\r\n\r\n2. Lately, there has been a marked increase of cases of protective\r\ncustody. I demand urgently that in this matter also, final directives\r\nbe given concerning _methods_, _proof_, _length of time_ and manner of\r\n_execution_. The decree on protective custody by the Reich Ministry\r\nof the Interior has been made invalid long ago by the actions of the\r\npolitical police. It is almost impossible to receive an adequate report\r\non a case of protective custody. The petitions, addressed to us in this\r\nmatter, all stress the same point which I also regard as important.\r\nThe parties concerned and their relatives accept protective custody\r\nas a matter of fact, but not the complete uncertainty as regards the\r\nmanner and principles by which it may or may not be imposed. This\r\nunquestionable _lawlessness_ fosters unrest and antagonism. It is\r\nintolerable for the Reich Ministry of the Interior, when there is a\r\ndifferent interpretation and application of the law in the respective\r\nstates, thereby obstructing a uniform execution of the law. The\r\nquestion must also be settled whether as approved by the judicial\r\nassociation N.S., in agreement with the Reichminister of Justice, in\r\ncases of protective custody a person is allowed a lawyer, or as is\r\nactually practised by the secret state police this is refused. I refer\r\nin this connection to the case of lawyer Puender. He was confined to\r\nprotective custody with his colleagues for bringing an action, being\r\nforced to do this by a Reich law, after duly informing the Reich\r\nMinistry of Justice and our ministry. This complaint could not involve\r\nany complications, as it could immediately be legally restrained by us.\r\n\r\n3. For _official political reasons_ I must object on principle to\r\nthe fact that lately once more and without previous knowledge of\r\nthe superior authorities, officials have been taken into protective\r\ncustody or what is sometimes even more, they have been subjected to\r\nstate police investigations. I cite here only the case of my teacher\r\nand Kreisleiter at Esterwegen, who was kept in protective custody for\r\n8 days, because he had sent a correct report, as proved afterwards,\r\nto his district councillor on abuses by the SS. I remember the\r\ninvestigations by criminal assistants of the Gestapo in Kottbus,\r\nlasting two weeks, on the chief of police in that phase, by the way an\r\nSS Brigadefuehrer. Likewise I have already presented today a complaint\r\nby the Oberpraesident Lohse, concerning the order to an official of\r\nthe gendarmerie for espionage on superior officials by officers of the\r\npolitical police.\r\n\r\nIt is intolerable from the point of view of the national socialist\r\nauthoritarian form of state leadership that subordinate offices\r\nprocure information on officials in this manner over the heads of\r\ntheir superior office. This will create a great deal of trouble quite\r\napart from the fact that information obtained in this manner must be\r\nprejudiced and very often even actually false.\r\n\r\n4. Abductions by officers of the political police on _foreign\r\nsovereign territory_ have lately created severe disturbances in\r\nthe field of foreign politics. I cite the cases of Berthold Jakob\r\n(Switzerland), Gutzeit (Holland) and the latest incident at the Czech\r\nfrontier. It is my opinion that in consideration of the foreign\r\npolitical complications, the police office should receive orders for\r\nsuch measures from the responsible Reich officer only, and not from\r\nsubordinate offices.\r\n\r\n5. Several times the Reich ministry of economics has pointed out to\r\nme the disturbing effect on the economic organization which must\r\nresult from the various political incidents caused by the police,\r\nthe atmosphere of insecurity caused by cases of protective custody\r\n(particularly in the case of economic leaders) and also in the latest\r\ncases of boycott of the Jews (Cologne, Duesseldorf).\r\n\r\n6. I can only undertake the creation of the Fuehrer protection in my\r\npolice department if I am completely responsible for the officials\r\nworking there, their service, capabilities and their co-operation with\r\nthe other departments of the criminal police.\r\n\r\n7. I propose that it be settled once and for all, not only who is to\r\nbear the responsibilities for the directives but also who shall bear\r\nthe responsibility for the carrying out of these directives in all\r\nmatters appertaining to the political police.\r\n\r\n_Either_: This responsibility rests with the Reichminister of the\r\ninterior. Then he has to be vested with altogether different powers to\r\ngive orders in political matters concerning the police.\r\n\r\n_Or_: This responsibility with all its consequences is borne by the\r\nReichfuehrer SS, who is already actually claiming the management of\r\nthe political police in the Reich. In this case, I would propose that\r\nthe law, laid down for Prussia by SS, Himmler, becomes Reich law\r\nimmediately, elevating the office of the secret state police to the\r\nstatus of a ministry and the chief of the office of the secret state\r\npolice undertakes the tasks which he--as is already stated in the draft\r\nof the law, \"determines\".\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 778-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy.\r\n\r\n  Concentration Camp _Dachau_       1.10.1933.\r\n  Commander's Office\r\n\r\n  Disciplinary and Punitive Regulations\r\n  for the Internment Camp.\r\n\r\n  Introduction.\r\n\r\nThe following regulations, concerning punishment, for the maintenance\r\nof discipline and order within the limits of the Concentration Camp\r\nDachau are released as part of the existing camp regulations.\r\n\r\nSubject to these regulations are all internees of the Concentration\r\nCamp Dachau from the time of their imprisonment to the hour of their\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nAuthority for ordering punishments lies in the hands of the camp\r\ncommander, who is personally responsible to the political police\r\ncommander for the execution of the issued camp regulations.\r\n\r\nTolerance means weakness.

The _Prussian Prime\r\nMinister_. Secret State Police Insp. 946/11 March 1934 _Berlin, 11\r\nMarch_.\r\n\r\nSubject: Order for measures of protective custody.\r\n\r\n1. The previous executory regulations, applying to measures of\r\nprotective custody are rescinded. In the future, limitations of\r\npersonal freedom, according to article 1 of the decree for the\r\nprotection of people and state of 28 Feb. 1933, may be ordered by the\r\nSecret State Police office, effective in the whole state, and by the\r\ngovernors and cabinet presidents in Berlin and by the state police\r\noffices for their local jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe present competency of the district police authorities\r\n[Kreispolizeibehoerden], namely the state counsellors [Land-rate], is\r\nno longer applicable for such measures. The measures previously ordered\r\nby them, become void after 31 March unless a prolongation has been\r\nordered before then by the State [Landes] police authorities.\r\n\r\n2. If protective custody has been ordered as a provisional measure\r\nbecause of suspicion of a criminal act, the decision of the court\r\nmust be obtained immediately for infliction of legal detention for\r\ninvestigation, and in the case of a refusal of a legal warrant for\r\narrest, the police measure is also to be rescinded, unless their\r\ncontinuation in exceptional cases appears justified for other reasons.\r\n\r\n3. Limitations of personal freedom, which are ordered by the Ober--and\r\nRegierungspraesidenten, by the president of the police in Berlin and\r\nby the state police offices, become automatically void on the 8th day\r\nafter the end of the day, on which the order for protective custody has\r\nbeen executed, unless the continuation of the protective custody has\r\nbeen ordered specifically by me upon appropriate request.\r\n\r\n4. Every case of protective custody, ordered by the Ober and\r\nRegierungspraesidenten, by the president of police in Berlin and\r\nby the state police offices, is to be reported to me personally\r\n(address Berlin W 9, Leipziger Platz 11a) by Telegram within 24 hours,\r\nmentioning exactly: name, age, occupation, political standpoint: of the\r\none affected, as well as the cause of the measure; also if necessary,\r\nthe necessity for apparently appropriate limitation of freedom beyond 7\r\ndays must be justified.\r\n\r\n5. Arrests, which do not fall under the designation \"protective\r\ncustody\", may only be made by the authorities, legally appointed for\r\nthem. But in this case, a legal warrant for arrest must be obtained\r\nunder all conditions within 24 hours. If such a warrant for arrest is\r\nrefused by the competent judge, or if it cannot be obtained within 24\r\nhours, the affected one is to be released immediately or, if the arrest\r\nis to remain in effect, action has to be taken according to #3 and 4\r\n(report by telegram within 24 hours to the prime minister).\r\n\r\n6. In the future, I will punish the abusive use of the arrest\r\nmercilessly.\r\n\r\nAgencies of the party and the associations may not make arrests. In\r\ncase of disregard of this order, the competent authorities must take\r\nactions against it immediately, and must report to me at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 781-PS\r\n\r\n 1.

S.I.2593/34--\r\n\r\nMost honored Reich Deputy [Reichstatthalter]!\r\n\r\nIn regard to your courteous communication of 19 December 1934, I\r\ninform you respectfully that, on the basis of the decree of the Reich\r\npresident relative to exercise of the right of nolle prosse of 21 March\r\n1934 (RGBl, I, page 211) in connection with Article 2, paragraph 1 of\r\nthe first law for transfer of administration of justice to the Reich of\r\n10 February 1934 (RGB1, I, page 91) the right to nolle prosse pending\r\ncriminal cases wherein the deed was committed after 20 March 1934,\r\nbelongs no longer to the Reich Deputy but exclusively to the Fuehrer\r\nand Reich Chancellor. Under the circumstances I consider myself not in\r\na position to go to the extent of proposing a nolle prosse of the case\r\nto the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor.\r\n\r\n  TO the Reich Deputy in Saxony in Dresden A1.\r\n\r\nInsofar as the deeds were committed before 2 March 1934 and therefore\r\nthe right of nolle prosse in the case belongs to you, most honored\r\nReich Deputy, I allow myself to express the greatest scruples\r\nagainst the intended nolle prosse. The nature of the mistreatments,\r\nparticularly the use of the drip-apparatus, is evidence of a coarseness\r\nand brutality in the perpetrators which is completely alien to German\r\nsensibility and feeling. Such atrocities, reminders of oriental sadism,\r\ncan find no explanation or excuse even in the greatest bitterness of\r\ncombat. Crimes of this sort must find their lawful expiation for the\r\nvery sake of the cleanness and respect of the movement. In view of\r\nexperiences in other cases, of similar aspect in a certain sense, I am\r\nalso unable to share the fear that execution of the legal proceedings\r\nwould be detrimental to the movement. This is all the more true since\r\nthe main proceedings can take place with complete exclusion of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 784-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  The Reichminister of Justice\r\n  Z.F.g 10 1696.34\r\n\r\n  Berlin, June 5, 1935\r\n\r\n1. A message to the deputy of the Fuehrer Reichminister Hess.\r\n\r\n  Confidential\r\n\r\n  Personal\r\n\r\nRegarding: penal proceedings against the merchant and SA leader Lt.\r\nColonel [Obersturmbannfuehrer] Jaehnichen and 22 companions on account\r\nof inflicting bodily injury on duty (protective custody Camp Hohenstein\r\nin Saxony).\r\n\r\n  Dear colleague!\r\n\r\nWith inference to the bill of indictment sent by me under my\r\ncommunication of March 20, 1935 regarding the penal proceedings\r\nmentioned above, I beg to inform you of the following:\r\n\r\nAfter a main trial, lasting about six weeks, the assistant prosecutor\r\nStaatsanwalt Dr. Walther, proposed the following sentences on May 3,\r\n1935:\r\n\r\n  Against Jaehnichen\r\n  (Camp Commandant) 5 years penetentiary\r\n  Against Zikera--1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Against Heinz Meier--3 years prison\r\n  Against Herbert Meier--3 years, 2 months prison\r\n  Against Tuerke--3 years prison\r\n  Against Volkmar--2 years, 3 months penetentiary\r\n  Against Leuschner--2 years, 3 months prison\r\n  Against Romkopf--2 years, 6 months prison\r\n  Against Karche--1 year, 8 months prison\r\n  Against Hausch--1 year, 4 months prison\r\n  Against Lehmann--3 years, 3 months prison\r\n  Against Kuehnel--1 year prison\r\n  Against Stachowski--1 year prison\r\n  Against Ude--1 year prison\r\n  Against Friedrich--1 year, 3 months prison\r\n  Against Schmeling (Police)--1 year prison\r\n  Against Konitz--1 year prison\r\n  Against Uhlmann--1 year prison\r\n  Against Sturzkober--10 months prison\r\n  Against Schupp--1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Against Hensel--2 years, 3 months prison\r\n  Against Heinicker--1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Against Putzler--3 years, 9 months penetentiary\r\n  Against Liebscher--7 months prison\r\n  Against Heger--Suspension on account of amnesty.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1935 the Criminal division number 12 of the Supreme Court in\r\nDresden pronounced the verdict, by which on account of offences against\r\nArt. 340 of the Penal Code the following were sentenced:\r\n\r\n  Jaehnichen--to 6 years prison\r\n  Zikera--to 1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Heinz Meier--to 3 years prison\r\n  Herbert Meier--to 3 years prison\r\n  Tuerke--to 3 years prison\r\n  Volkmar--to 2 years, 3 months prison\r\n  Leuschner--to 2 years, 6 months prison\r\n  Romkopf--to 2 years, 6 months prison\r\n  Karche--to 1 year, 8 months prison\r\n  Hausch--to 1 year, 4 months prison\r\n  Lehmann--to 3 years prison\r\n  Kuehnel--to 1 year prison\r\n  Stachowski--to 1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Ude--to 1 year prison\r\n  Friedrich--to 1 year, 3 months prison\r\n  Schmeling--to 1 year prison\r\n  Konitz--to 1 year prison\r\n  Uhlmann--to 1 year prison\r\n  Sturzkober--to 10 months prison\r\n  Schupp--to 1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Hensel--to 2 years prison\r\n  Heinicker--to 1 year, 6 months prison\r\n  Putzler--to 3 years, 9 months prison\r\n  Against Liebscher and Heger suspension was authorized\r\n    on the basis of the law governing amnesty.\r\n\r\nAfter the proposal of the sentence, however, still before the\r\nannouncement of the verdict, the chairman of the Criminal division\r\nnumber 12 received the following letter from the Reich governor\r\n[Reichsstatthalter] of Saxony:\r\n\r\n  \"Official Seal\r\n\r\n  The Reich Governor [Reichsstatthalter] of Saxony II 84/35\r\n  Dresden-A.1, May 8, 1935\r\n  Mailbox 78 Telephone 24 371.\r\n\r\n  To the president of the Supreme Court Dr. Roth\r\n  [Landgerichtsdirektor]\r\n\r\n  Dresden\r\n  Pillnitzer Street 41\r\n\r\n  The President of the Supreme Court:\r\n  Sir:\r\n\r\nAs I was informed, it is proposed to impose a punishment of 3-1/2 years\r\nof penal servitude upon the accused Standartenfuehrer Jaehnichen.\r\nWithout wanting to interfere in the proceedings or intending to\r\ninfluence you as Judge in any way before the verdict is announced,\r\nI should nevertheless like to once more call your attention to the\r\nfact that the circumstances, as they had been brought about by the\r\nrevolution of 1933 and as they, without doubt were still taking effect\r\nup to the beginning of 1934, cannot be overlooked, when pronouncing\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nA further point appears to me to be worth taking into consideration,\r\nnamely, the fact that one cannot accuse Jaehnichen of having a low\r\ncharacter and that, above all, in Hohenstein the scum of humanity had\r\nto be attended to. In consideration of this fact I should like to leave\r\nit to you to consider whether the lapses call for such a severe degree\r\nof punishment or rather whether a pardon could not be considered.\r\n\r\nAs Gauleiter of NSDAP I regard it as my duty to call attention again to\r\nthe unusual circumstances.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  Signed:      Martin Mutschmann.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover the information has come to hand that the two magistrates\r\n(Schoeffen), who functioned as judges in the principal trial, namely,\r\nRegierungsamtmann Helbig and the merchant Pesler, had been expelled\r\nfrom the NSDAP after the announcement of the verdict. I do not know by\r\nwhom this expulsion was ordered.\r\n\r\nFinally it has been put to the assistant prosecutor, Staatsanwalt Dr.\r\nWalther, who is a storm trooper, after the pronouncing of the verdict\r\non his Obersturmbannfuehrer, that he should resign from the SA.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these measures were taken at the same time as the verdict\r\nreferred to above was pronounced, gives rise to the assumption that\r\nhere also there is something below the surface. However, this would\r\nrepresent an extremely serious and highly undesirable conclusion to\r\nthe legal and fully binding penal proceedings. If the letter from\r\nthe Reich governor reproduced here gave the impression that his\r\njudicial decisions should be influenced from higher up, then this\r\nwould certainly influence to an even greater extent any later measures\r\ninstituted against the 2 magistrates. That kind of procedure against\r\nlay judges after the verdict had been pronounced would naturally and\r\nnecessarily arouse the feeling that, when they are functioning as\r\njudges, they are responsible to a certain office for their work. Hereby\r\nthe judicial unpartiality, which is the foundation of every orderly\r\nadministration of criminal law becomes null and void. Moreover, the\r\nlay judge, who upon entering service, must swear an oath, that he will\r\ndischarge his duties conscientiously and to the best of his ability,\r\nwould find himself forced to battle with his conscience. No less\r\nserious would be the consequences of such measures for the assistant\r\npublic prosecutor. This official would also have to battle with his\r\nconscience, while carrying out his duties. Thereby the orderly official\r\nwork of the authorities for the administration of criminal law would be\r\nso seriously endangered that I would find myself obliged to consider\r\nthe question whether in the face of such a state of affairs public\r\nprosecutors and judges could still be functionaries of the party or\r\nmembers of the SA at all.\r\n\r\nHence it appears to be necessary----\r\n\r\n 1. in the case in question to remove the confusion, resulting from the\r\n measures indicated above, by suitable countermeasures\r\n\r\n 2. to take steps that such occurrences altogether incompatible with\r\n the administration of criminal law and the public security guaranteed\r\n by the state are avoided.\r\n\r\nI would respectfully request your comments and information with regard\r\nto any action in this direction. Considering the importance of this\r\ncase, I would be obliged if you would reply as early as possible.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Signed:      Dr. Guertner.\r\n\r\n2.

In regard\r\nto the details of the incidents, may I refer to the enclosed copy of\r\nthe Bill of indictment of October 1934 and particularly may I call\r\nattention to page 21 of the results of the inquiry. On May 3, 1935 the\r\nassistant prosecutor Staatsanwalt Dr. Walther imposed the following\r\npunishment:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere has been received that it has been put to the assistant prosecutor\r\nStaatsanwalt Dr. Walther, who is a storm trooper, after pronouncing of\r\nthe verdict on his Obersturmbannfuehrer, that he should resign from the\r\nSA.

The Court in its sentence, however, considered\r\nthat mistreatments in such cases to a certain extent were justified\r\nor at least understandable. But it expressly stated further that\r\nthe mistreatments which occurred during interrogations had taken on\r\nproportions which were in no accord with the desired objective and that\r\nthe defendants not only attempted to wring confessions from the inmates\r\nbut that they acted in sheer lust for torture. (Compare Page 100 of the\r\nSentence Document.)\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Cases, however, over which sentences were\r\npronounced, represent mistreatments which occurred when the inmates\r\nfirst entered the institution, when they received their prison\r\nclothing, or during drill hours. These mistreatments were carried out\r\nwithout rhyme or reason. The fact that the defendants in these cases\r\nwere motivated neither by political purposes nor by personal revenge\r\nagainst outrages suffered formerly can be learned from the following\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n1. Amongst the mistreated persons there were quite a number that never\r\nbelonged to any parties of the left. Some of them were even old members\r\nof the movement. The following cases are proof of that:\r\n\r\n2. _Case Prueger_\r\n\r\nOn 6.3.1934 the Kreisleiter of the German Labor Front for the food\r\nindustry, member of the Nazi Party, was brought in for offending the\r\nKreisleiter and two other persons. When being brought in, Turke beat\r\nhis face with his fist and subsequently, in a small room, he was\r\nheavily beaten with sticks, whips and other instruments. * * *\r\n\r\n* * * 2. The methods as well as the detailed circumstances of\r\nmistreatment show that lust for torture was the only motivation in\r\na great number of cases. The following case illustrates that fact\r\nespecially well.\r\n\r\nThe defendant Schupp frequently had to supervise the drill of inmates.\r\nOn 5 or 6 March 1935 he called the inmate Lindner out of formation\r\nwithout any apparent reason and asked him for his name and domicile.\r\nThen he pressed, without any cause, his burning cigarette upon the end\r\nof Lindner's nose with the result that the latter received a burn for\r\nwhich he later required medical treatment. The court in this case, as\r\nin several others, expressly maintains that Schupp only acted out of\r\nsheer lust of torture. * * *\r\n\r\n* * * Furthermore, may I state as far as the question of further\r\nmitigation of sentences are concerned that the court in pronouncing\r\nsentence has already weighed to the fullest extent all possible\r\nmitigating circumstances, the awful consequences of cruel mistreatment\r\nof human beings should otherwise result in a far more severe judicial\r\nexpiation. Also it must not be over-looked that altogether only those\r\nmembers of the concentration camp staff were brought into court\r\nwho took an especially active and cruel part in the mistreatments.\r\nFurthermore, the sentence was not aggravated by the fact that the\r\nCourt affirmed, for purely judicial reasons, that the defendants\r\nwere officials and sentenced them for committing bodily harm while\r\ncarrying out a public office. The sentence expressly states that the\r\ncourt did not stress the fact that the accused SA men were officials\r\nin determining the punishment because they had not received proper\r\ntraining as officials and they probably do not wish to be referred to\r\nas such. (Compare page 144 of the Sentence). In these circumstances the\r\nmitigation of sentences already granted in the decree of 31 October\r\n1935 seem an extensive favor. If, nevertheless, I suggest subsequently\r\na further reduction of sentence, based upon new evidence of some of\r\nthe defendants, I can only justify my action because I believe that,\r\naccording to circumstances, the defendants in one or the other case of\r\nmistreatment may have partly acted out of revolutionary motives.\r\n\r\nAs to what parts the individual defendants played in these criminal\r\nacts I refer to the last two columns in the table handed over with the\r\nreport of 28 August 1935. The following statements as to the individual\r\ndefendants may be made.\r\n\r\n1. _Jaehnichen_:\r\n\r\n Sentence: 6 years imprisonment.\r\n\r\n Reduction of Sentence: to be released on probation after 4 years 6\r\n months.\r\n\r\nJaehnichen is an old member of the S.A. who through his bad example\r\nhas fostered the increase of excesses, but at first he was motivated\r\nundoubtedly by a certain revolutionary anger and by the fact that\r\nhe wanted to maintain exemplary discipline amongst the inmates. A\r\nfurther mitigating fact is that his participation in the unusually\r\nserious mistreatment of the Jew Ambross, who later committed suicide,\r\nwas inspired by the belief that he was dealing in this case with a\r\ndespoiler of German girls. With these facts, being what they are, a\r\nfurther reduction in sentence, amounting to one year, seems justifiable.\r\n\r\n2. _Putzler_:\r\n\r\n Sentence: 3 years 9 months imprisonment.\r\n\r\n Reduction of Sentence: to be released on probation after 2 years 6\r\n months.\r\n\r\nHis sentence is based essentially on the especially cruel mistreatments\r\nduring questionings of inmates. Even though his acts in this connection\r\nseem to be pure vindictive torture, as for example the use of the\r\ndripping device, one may, nevertheless, say that at least at first he\r\nwas motivated by the desire to obtain truthful statements. On the other\r\nhand, Putzler participated in serious excesses also during times other\r\nthan the questioning periods and played a leading part in them. To give\r\nan example, he tore out inmate Ricke's beard. A further reduction of\r\nthe sentence by 6 months seems under these circumstances a far going\r\nfavor * * *\r\n\r\n* * * I want to remark, in conclusion, that the defendants as well as\r\nthe defense, believe since 29.11.1935 that all defendants had been\r\nfinally pardoned by the decision of the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor.\r\nIt is further to be learned from remarks by defendants not in custody\r\nthat in case of a complete pardon those still in custody would leave\r\nprison under the accompaniment of a band or would be solemnly received\r\nby a band on return to their home town.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Appendix\r\n\r\nUpon application of the Reich Minister of Justice I hereby grant in\r\nthe case against Rudolp Jaehnichen and others, for mistreatment of\r\npersons committed to protective custody in Hohnstein Concentration Camp\r\n(16.

Just now, at 1030, State Secretary Dr. Meissner telephoned and asked\r\nme to deliver the following message to the Minister, whom he had been\r\nunable to contact:\r\n\r\nConcerning the pardon of those sentenced in connection with the\r\nmaltreatment in the Hohnstein Concentration Camp, Herr Bouhler informed\r\nhim yesterday that he had reported to the Fuehrer on the result of the\r\nfresh inquiries, which he and Reich Governor Mutschmann had instituted.\r\nThe Fuehrer has now decided to remit all other sentences remaining.\r\nState Secretary Meissner wished to inform the Ministry of Justice of\r\nthis, so that it might be made the subject of corresponding decrees.\r\nHe, State Secretary Meissner, mentioned that the Minister of Justice\r\nhad likewise been commissioned by the Fuehrer to carry out special\r\ninquiries, to determine in which cases the motives for maltreatment\r\nhad been sadistic and therefore a pardon would be out of place.\r\nThe Minister of Justice would have to be given the opportunity of\r\nreporting to the Fuehrer his ideas, based on his still inconclusive\r\ninvestigations. Herr Bouhler also stated that the Minister of Justice\r\nwas still at liberty to do so. The Fuehrer merely desired that his\r\ninquiries be hastened as much as possible so that the statement could\r\nbe made within the next few weeks and that, in any case, he submit a\r\ndecree granting full pardon.\r\n\r\nState Secretary Meissner, when finally summing up, therefore requested\r\nthat, should the Minister not approve of a total pardon, a double\r\ndecree be submitted.\r\n\r\n2. The Minister for his favourable consideration.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 29th November 1935\r\n  [Signature illegible]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 787-PS\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 18 June, 1935\r\n\r\n  The Reich Ministry of Justice\r\n  _Z.F. g 10 390/35_\r\n\r\n1. Communication to the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor with addition of a\r\ncertified copy of B1. 9-10 d.A., thus far\r\n\r\nSubject: Motion of the Reich deputy in Saxony concerning the\r\nnolle-prossing of the criminal procedure against Oberregierungsrat\r\nVogel in Dresden on account of bodily injury while in office.\r\n\r\n  16 St.A 107/34 (StA.Dresden)\r\n  Inclosure: 1 loose sheet.\r\n\r\nThe prosecuting authority in Dresden has indicated Oberregierungsrat\r\nErich Vogel in Dresden (case designation 16 STA. 4 107/34) on account\r\nof bodily injury while in office. The following subject matter is the\r\nbasis of the case:\r\n\r\nVogel belongs to the Gestapo office of the province of Saxony since its\r\nfoundation and is chief of Main section II, which formerly bore the\r\ntitle Zub [Zentralstelle fuer Umsturzbekaempfung] (Central office for\r\ncombatting revolt). In the process of combatting efforts inimical to\r\nthe State Vogel carried out several so called borderland actions in the\r\nyear 1933 in which a large number of politically unreliable persons and\r\npersons who had become political prisoners in the border territories\r\nwere taken into protective custody [Schutzhaft] and brought to the\r\nHohnstein protective custody camp. In the camp serious mistreatment\r\nof the prisoners has been going on at least since summer of 1933. The\r\nprisoners were not only, as in protective custody camp Bredow near\r\nStettin, beaten into a state of unconsciousness for no reason, with\r\nwhips and other tools but were also tortured in other ways, as for\r\ninstance with a drip-apparatus especially constructed for the purpose,\r\nunder which the prisoners had to stand so long that they came away with\r\nserious purulent wounds of the scalp. The guilty SA-leaders and SA-men\r\nwere sentenced to punishments of 6 years to 9 months of imprisonment\r\nby the main criminal court of the provincial court in Dresden of 15\r\nMay 1935 (16 StA. 3431.34). Vogel, whose duties frequently brought him\r\nto the camp, took part in this mistreatment, insofar as it happened\r\nin the reception room of the camp during completion of the reception\r\nformalities, and in the supply room, during issuing of the blankets. In\r\nthis respect it should be pointed out that Vogel was generally known\r\nto the personnel of the camp--exactly because of his function as head\r\nof the Zub--and his conduct became at least partly a standard for the\r\nabove-named conduct of the SA-leaders and men.\r\n\r\nOne of the border actions took place on 3 August 1935. Vogel had\r\nordered the arrest of the persons who were brought to the camp at that\r\ntime, and therefore also had responsibilities relative to their proper\r\ntreatment. On account of the large number of those who were brought\r\nin, a pay office of the administration building in the lower castle\r\nyard was adapted as a makeshift reception room to help dispose of the\r\nformalities. The reception was being taken care of by Truppfuehrer\r\n[T/Sgt] Felix Sikora. He hit every incoming person without cause\r\nviolently across the face with a steel ruler, so that it resounded\r\nloudly. In addition the prisoners, when brought in, were spoken to\r\nroughly and at the same time beaten, partly even literally pushed into\r\nthe room. Vogel stayed in the reception room a long time and watched\r\nthese proceedings without doing anything about them. In his presence,\r\nfor instance, the SA-man Mutze dealt such blows to one man, without\r\nprovocation, that he turned around on himself. As already stated, Vogel\r\nnot only took no steps against this treatment of the prisoners, but he\r\neven made jokes about it and stated that it amused him the way things\r\nwere popping here.\r\n\r\nIn the supply room Vogel himself took a hand in the beating amid the\r\ngeneral severe mistreatment. The SA-man there employed whips and other\r\narticles and beat the prisoners in such a manner that serious injuries\r\nwere produced, the prisoners partly became unconscious and had to lie\r\nin the dispensary a long time. Vogel was often present in the supply\r\nroom during the mistreatment. At least in the following cases he\r\npersonally laid violent hands upon prisoners.\r\n\r\na. On the occasion of the borderland action of 3 August 1933 Vogel was\r\nin the chamber in the rear portion of the area, where the prisoners\r\nas a rule do not enter. At first Vogel observed from there the severe\r\nmistreatment which was administered to the prisoners at the counter\r\nwhere the blankets were issued. Then he had a prisoner brought to the\r\nrear chamber and swung several blows of his fist at his head.\r\n\r\nb. On 12 November 1933 Vogel arrived at the camp together with\r\nRegierungsrat Dr. Wolf from Leipzig and again entered the chamber.\r\nOn this day several prisoners were brought in. Vogel pointed out one\r\nof the prisoners to the SA-men present in the room, among whom were\r\nSturmmann Walter Rohmkopf, Truppfuehrer Herbert Meier, and Truppfuehrer\r\nGeorg Lehmann, and declared, in effect, that this man \"should get his\r\nass particularly full\". He also stated that the prisoner had offended\r\nor threatened one of his people. Upon this invitation the prisoner was\r\nlaid across the counter in the usual manner, held fast by the head\r\nand arms, and then beaten for a considerable time by the SA men with\r\nwhips and other articles. Along with this Vogel himself took part in\r\nthe beating for a time, and after this mistreatment slapped him again,\r\nso that the prisoner appeared green and blue in the face. The prisoner\r\nis the tinsmith Hans Kuehitz, who bore the nickname Johnny. Upon his\r\ndeparture Vogel gave the head of the supply room, Truppenfuehrer\r\nMeier from 5 to 6 reichsmarks with the stated reason that the SA men\r\n\"had sweated so\". The money was then distributed by Meier to those\r\nSA-comrades who had taken part in the mistreatment.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of 20 May 1935 the Reich Deputy in Saxony forwarded to\r\nme with a recommendation Vogel's petition for nolle prossing dated 10\r\nMay, 1935, which was addressed to him, and a copy of which is attached.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to approve this petition. The mistreatments which\r\ntook place in the camp of Hohnstein are more numerous and in their\r\nfashion more serious than the cases of mistreatment in the well-known\r\nprotective custody camp Bredow, near Stettin. As in the case of Bredow\r\nan authoritative official of the State Secret Police, in like manner\r\nas SS-Sturmfuehrer Dr. Hoffmann, shot on 30 June, 1934, knowing\r\nof the mistreatment and for the most part instigating it himself,\r\nOberregierungsrat Vogel, as an authoritative member of the supervisory\r\nagency of the camp for the State Secret Police of Saxony, knew of the\r\nmistreatment and to an extent even took part in it. By his actions\r\nhe supported the convicted SA-leaders and men in their deeds and\r\nthereby bears the largest part of responsibility for the criminal acts\r\ncommitted there. It would not be right to let this participant, who\r\nin view of his training, his position of leadership, and his office,\r\nmust have recognized the objectionability of the proceedings in the\r\ncamp with particular clarity, go unpunished while the SA-leaders\r\nand men received considerable sentences--even if not very severe in\r\ncomparison with their deeds. A nolle prossing of the case against Vogel\r\nwould represent unearned granting of favors to a more highly placed\r\nparticipant, and therefore one endowed with more responsibility, and\r\nwould be considered as such by all persons involved. It would stand in\r\nstarkest irreconcilable contradiction to the treatment of the Stettin\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. Guertner\r\n\r\n  2.

Conference with the Fuehrer, to which all\r\nSupreme Commanders are ordered. The Fuehrer gives the following speech:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this conference is to give you an idea of the world of\r\nmy thoughts, which governs me in the face of future events, and to tell\r\nyou my decisions. The building up of our armed forces was only possible\r\nin connection with the ideological [weltanschaulich] education of the\r\nGerman people by the Party. When I started my political task in 1919,\r\nmy strong belief in final success was based on a thorough observation\r\nof the events of the day and the study of the reasons for their\r\noccurrence. Therefore, I never lost my belief in the midst of set-backs\r\nwhich were not spared me during my period of struggle. Providence has\r\nhad the last word and brought me success. On top of that, I had a\r\nclear recognition of the probable course of historical events, and the\r\nfirm will to make brutal decisions. The first decision was in 1919 when\r\nI after long internal conflict became a politician and took up the\r\nstruggle against my enemies. That was the hardest of all decisions. I\r\nhad, however, the firm belief that I would arrive at my goal. First\r\nof all, I desired a new system of selection. I wanted to educate a\r\nminority which would take over the leadership. After 15 years, I\r\narrived at my goal, after strenuous struggles and many set-backs.\r\nWhen I came to power in 1933, a period of the most difficult struggle\r\nlay behind me. Everything existing before that had collapsed. I had\r\nto reorganize everything beginning with the mass of the people and\r\nextending it to the armed forces. First reorganization of the interior,\r\nabolishment of appearances of decay and defeatist ideas, education\r\nto heroism. While reorganizing the interior, I undertook the second\r\ntask: to release Germany from its international ties. Two particular\r\ncharacteristics are to be pointed out: secession from the League of\r\nNations and denunciation of the disarmament conference. It was a hard\r\ndecision. The number of prophets who predicted that it would lead to\r\nthe occupation of the Rhineland was large, the number of believers\r\nwas very small. I was supported by the nation, which stood firmly\r\nbehind me, when I carried out my intentions. After that the order for\r\nrearmament. Here again there were numerous prophets who predicted\r\nmisfortunes, and only a few believers. In 1935 the introduction of\r\ncompulsory armed service. After that militarization of the Rhineland,\r\nagain a process believed to be impossible at that time. The number of\r\npeople who put trust in me, was very small. Then the beginning of the\r\nfortification of the whole country especially in the west.\r\n\r\nOne year later, Austria came, this step also was considered doubtful.\r\nIt brought about a considerable reinforcement of the Reich. The next\r\nstep was Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. This step also was not possible\r\nto accomplish in one campaign. First of all, the western fortification\r\nhad to be finished. It was not possible to reach the goal in one\r\neffort. It was clear to me from the first moment that I could not be\r\nsatisfied with the Sudeten-German territory. That was only a partial\r\nsolution. The decision to march into Bohemia was made. Then followed\r\nthe erection of the Protectorate and with that the basis for the\r\naction against Poland was laid, but I wasn't quite clear at that time\r\nwhether I should start first against the east and then in the west\r\nor vice-versa. Moltke often made the same calculations in his time.\r\nUnder pressure the decision came to fight with Poland first. One\r\nmight accuse me of wanting to fight and fight again. In struggle I see\r\nthe fate of all beings. Nobody can avoid a struggle if he does not\r\nwant to lose out. The increasing number of people requires a larger\r\nliving space [Lebensraum]. My goal was to create a logical relation\r\nbetween the number of people and the space for them to live in. The\r\nstruggle must start here. No people can get away from the solution\r\nof this task or else it must yield and gradually die out. That is\r\ntaught by history. First migration of peoples to the southwest, then\r\nadaptation of the number of people to the small space by emigration.\r\nIn the last years, adaptation of the people to insufficient space,\r\nby reducing the number of births. This would lead to the death and\r\nweakening of the blood of the people. If a people chooses that course\r\nall their weaknesses are mobilized. One yields to the force of the\r\noutside and uses this force against one's self by killing of the child.\r\nThis means the greatest cowardice, decimation of the number, and loss\r\nof value. I decided a different way: adaptation of the living space\r\nto the number of people. One acknowledgement is important. The state\r\nhas a meaning only if it supports the maintenance of its population\r\npotential. In our case 82 millions of people were concerned. That\r\nmeans the greatest responsibility. He who does not want to assume this\r\nresponsibility is not worthy of belonging to the mass of the people.\r\nThat gave me the strength to fight. It is one eternal problem to\r\nbring the number of Germans to a proper relationship to the available\r\nspace. Security of the needed space. No calculated cleverness is of\r\nany help, solution only with the sword. A people unable to produce\r\nthe strength to fight must withdraw. Struggles are different than\r\nthose of 100 years ago. Today we can speak of a racial fight. Today we\r\nfight for oilfields, rubber, treasures of the earth, etc. After the\r\npeace of Westphalia Germany disintegrated. Disintegration, impotence\r\nof the German Reich was determined by decree. This German impotence\r\nwas removed by the creation of the Reich when Prussia realized her\r\ntask. Then the opposition between France and England began. Since 1870\r\nEngland has been against us. Bismarck and Moltke were certain that\r\nthere would have to be one more action. The danger at that time was\r\nof a two-front war. Moltke was at times in favor of a preventive war.\r\nTo take advantage of the slow progress of the Russian mobilization.\r\nGerman armed might was not fully employed. Insufficient sternness\r\nof the leading personalities. The basic thought of Moltke was the\r\noffensive. He never thought of the defense. Many opportunities were\r\nmissed after Moltke's death. The solution was only possible by\r\nattacking a country at a favorable moment. Political and military\r\nleadership always declared that it was not yet ready. In 1914 there\r\ncame the war on several fronts. It did not bring the solution of these\r\nproblems. Today the second act of this drama is being written. For\r\nthe first time in 67 years it must be made clear that we do not have\r\na two-front war to wage. That which has been desired since 1870 and\r\nconsidered as impossible of achievement has come to pass. For the first\r\ntime in history we have to fight on only one front, the other front is\r\nat present free. But no one can know how long that will remain so. I\r\nhave doubted for a long time whether I should strike in the east and\r\nthen in the west. Basically I did not organize the armed forces in\r\norder not to strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier\r\nor later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it was decided\r\nthat the east was to be attacked first. If the Polish war was won so\r\nquickly, it was due to the superiority of our armed forces. The most\r\nglorious appearance in history. Unexpectedly small expenditures of men\r\nand material. Now the eastern front is held by only a few divisions.\r\nIt is a situation which we viewed previously as unachievable. Now the\r\nsituation is as follows: The opponent in the west lies behind his\r\nfortifications. There is no possibility of coming to grips with him.\r\nThe decisive question is: how long can we endure this situation? Russia\r\nis at present not dangerous. It is weakened by many incidents today.\r\nMoreover, we have a pact with Russia. Pacts, however, are only held as\r\nlong as they serve the purpose. Russia will hold herself to it only\r\nso long as Russia considers it to be to her benefit. Even Bismarck\r\nthought so. Let one think of the pact to assure our back. Now Russia\r\nhas far-reaching goals, above all the strengthening of her position in\r\nthe Baltic. We can oppose Russia only when we are free in the West.\r\nFurther Russia is striving to increase her influence on the Balkans\r\nand is striving toward the Persian Gulf. That is also the goal of our\r\nforeign policy. Russia will do that which she considers to benefit her.\r\nAt the present moment it has retired from internationalism. In case she\r\nrenounces this, she will proceed to Pan-Slavism. It is difficult to see\r\ninto the future. It is a fact that at the present time the Russian army\r\nis of little worth. For the next one or two years the present situation\r\nwill remain.\r\n\r\nMuch depends on Italy, above all on Mussolini, whose death could alter\r\neverything. Italy has a great goal for the consolidation of her empire.\r\nThose who carry this idea are fascism and the Duce, personally. The\r\ncourt is opposed to that. As long as the Duce lives, then it can\r\nbe calculated that Italy will seize every opportunity to reach her\r\nimperialistic goal. However, it is too much to ask of Italy, that it\r\nshould join in the battle before Germany has seized the offensive in\r\nthe west: Just so Russia did not attack until we had marched into\r\nPoland. Otherwise Italy will think that France has only to deal with\r\nItaly, since Germany is sitting behind its West Wall. Italy will not\r\nattack until Germany has taken the offensive against France. Just as\r\nthe death of Stalin, so the death of the Duce can bring danger to\r\nus. Just how easily the death of a statesman can come I myself have\r\nexperienced recently. The time must be used to the full, otherwise one\r\nwill suddenly find himself faced with a new situation. As long as Italy\r\nmaintains this position then no danger from Jugoslavia is to be feared.\r\nJust so is the neutrality of Rumania achieved by the position of\r\nRussia. Scandinavia is hostile to us because of Marxistic influences,\r\nbut is neutral now. America is still not dangerous to us because of its\r\nneutrality laws. The strengthening of our opponents by America is still\r\nnot important. The position of Japan is still uncertain, it is not yet\r\ncertain whether she will join against England.\r\n\r\nEverything is determined by the fact that the moment is favorable now;\r\nin 6 months it might not be so anymore.\r\n\r\nAs the last factor I must name my own person in all modesty:\r\nirreplaceable. Neither a military nor a civil person could replace\r\nme. Assassination attempts may be repeated. I am convinced of the\r\npowers of my intellect and of decision. Wars are always ended only by\r\nthe destruction of the opponent. Everyone who believes differently\r\nis irresponsible. Time is working for our adversary. Now there is\r\na relationship of forces which can never be more propitious, but\r\ncan only deteriorate for us. The enemy will not make peace when the\r\nrelationship of forces is unfavorable for us. No compromise. Sterness\r\nagainst ourselves. I shall strike and not capitulate. The fate of the\r\nReich depends only on me. I shall deal accordingly. Today we have a\r\nsuperiority such as we have never had before. After 1914 our opponents\r\ndisarmed themselves of their own accord. England disregarded the\r\nconstruction of her fleet. The fleet is no longer sufficiently large\r\nto safeguard the shipping lanes. Only two modern new constructions:\r\nRodney and Nelson. New construction activity only in the cruisers of\r\nthe Washington class, which were, however, an unsatisfactory type. The\r\nnew measures can become effective only in 1941. In the Abyssinian war\r\nEngland did not have enough strength to occupy the Tana Sea. At Malta,\r\nGibraltar and London little anti-aircraft protection. Since 1937 a\r\nrenewal of rearmament. At present however, only a small number of\r\ndivisions, which must form the nucleus of new divisions. Material for\r\nthe army being gathered together from all over the world. Not before\r\nnext summer is a positive action to be expected. The British army has\r\nonly a symbolic meaning. Rearmament in the air is proceeding. The first\r\nphase will end in the spring of 1940. Anti-aircraft has only guns from\r\nthe last war. A German flyer is safe from English anti-aircraft fire at\r\n6000 meters altitude. The navy will not be fully rearmed before one to\r\ntwo years [1-2 Jahren], I have the greatest experience in rearmament\r\nand I know the difficulties which must be overcome therein.\r\n\r\nAfter 1914 France reduced the length of service. After 1914 decrease of\r\nmilitary might. Only in some special branches are we inferior. Only the\r\nFrench Navy was modernized. In the time after the war the French army\r\ndeteriorated. There were no changes until Germany rearmed and announced\r\nher demands.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n  1. The number of active organizations in Germany is greatest.\r\n  2. Superiority of the Luftwaffe.\r\n  3. Anti-aircraft beyond all competition.\r\n  4. Tank corps.\r\n  5. Large number of anti-tank guns, five times as many as 1914\r\n  machine guns.\r\n  6. German artillery has great superiority because of the 10.5 gun.\r\n  7. French superiority in howitzers and mortars does not exist.\r\n\r\nNumerical superiority, but also the value of the individual soldier\r\nis greater than for the others. I am most deeply pained when I hear\r\nthe opinion that the German army is not individually as valuable as\r\nit should be. The infantry in Poland did not accomplish what one\r\nshould have expected from it. Lax discipline. I believe that the\r\nsoldiers must be judged in their relative value in comparison with the\r\nopponent. There is no doubt that our armed forces are the best. Every\r\nGerman infantryman is better than the French. Not the exhilaration of\r\npatriotism but tough determination. I am told that the troops will only\r\nadvance if the officers lead the way. In 1914 that was also the case.\r\nI am told that we were better trained then. In reality we were only\r\nbetter trained on the drill field, but not for the war. I must pay the\r\npresent leadership the compliment that it is better than it was in\r\n1914. Mention of the collapse while storming Liege. There was nothing\r\nlike this in the campaign in Poland.\r\n\r\nFive million Germans have been called to the colors. Of what importance\r\nif a few of them collapse. Daring in the army, navy and Luftwaffe. I\r\ncan not bear it when one says the army is not in good shape. Everything\r\nlies in the hands of the military leader. I can do anything with the\r\nGerman soldier if he is well led. We have succeeded with our small navy\r\nin clearing the North Sea of the British. Recognition of the small\r\nnavy, especially the High Command of the Navy.\r\n\r\nWe have a Luftwaffe which has succeeded in safeguarding the entire\r\nliving space of the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe land army achieved outstanding things in Poland. Even in the West\r\nit was not shown that the German soldier is inferior to the French.\r\n\r\nRevolution from within is impossible. We are superior to the enemy\r\nnumerically in the West. Behind the Army stands the strongest armament\r\nindustry of the world.\r\n\r\nI am disturbed by the stronger and stronger appearance of the English.\r\nThe English are a tough enemy. Above all on defence. There is no doubt\r\nthat England will be very much represented in France at the latest in\r\nsix to eight months.\r\n\r\nWe have an Achilles heel: The Ruhr. The progress of the war depends on\r\nthe possession of the Ruhr. If England and France push through Belgium\r\nand Holland into the Ruhr, we shall be in the greatest danger. That\r\ncould lead to the paralyzing of the German power of resistance. Every\r\nhope of compromise is childish: Victory or defeat! The question is not\r\nthe fate of a national-socialistic Germany, but who is to dominate\r\nEurope in the future. The question is worthy of the greatest efforts.\r\nCertainly England and France will assume the offensive against Germany\r\nwhen they are armed. England and France have means of pressure to bring\r\nBelgium and Holland to request English and French help. In Belgium and\r\nHolland the sympathies are all for France and England. Mention of the\r\nincident at Venlo: The man who was shot was not an Englishman, but a\r\nDutch General Staff officer. This was kept silent in the press. The\r\nDutch government asked that the body of the Dutch officer be given up.\r\nThis is one of their greatest stupidities. The Dutch press does not\r\neven mention the incident anymore. At a given time I shall use that to\r\nmotivate my action. If the French army marches into Belgium in order\r\nto attack us, it will be too late for us. We must anticipate them. One\r\nmore thing. U-boats, mines, and Luftwaffe (also for mines) can strike\r\nEngland effectively, if we have a better starting point. Now a flight\r\nto England demands so much fuel that sufficient bomb loads cannot be\r\ncarried. The invention of a new type mine is of greatest importance\r\nfor the Navy. Aircraft will be the chief mine layers now. We shall\r\nsow the English coast with mines which cannot be cleared. This mine\r\nwarfare with the Luftwaffe demands a different starting point. England\r\ncannot live without its imports. We can feed ourselves. The permanent\r\nsowing of mines on the English coasts will bring England to her knees.\r\nHowever, this can only occur if we have occupied Belgium and Holland.\r\nIt is a difficult decision for me. None has ever achieved what I have\r\nachieved. My life is of no importance in all this. I have led the\r\nGerman people to a great height, even if the world does hate us now.\r\nI am setting this work on a gamble. I have to choose between victory\r\nor destruction. I choose victory. Greatest historical choice, to be\r\ncompared with the decision of Frederick the Great before the first\r\nSilesian war. Prussia owes its rise to the heroism of one man. Even\r\nthere the closest advisers were disposed to capitulation. Everything\r\ndepended on Frederick the Great. Even the decisions of Bismarck in\r\n1866 and 1870 were no less great. My decision is unchangeable. I shall\r\nattack France and England at the most favorable and quickest moment.\r\nBreach of the neutrality of Belgium and Holland is meaningless. No\r\none will question that when we have won. We shall not bring about the\r\nbreach of neutrality as idiotically as it was in 1914. If we do not\r\nbreak the neutrality, then England and France will. Without attack\r\nthe war is not to be ended victoriously. I consider it as possible to\r\nend the war only by means of an attack. The question as to whether\r\nthe attack will be successful no one can answer. Everything depends\r\nupon the favorable instant. The military conditions are favorable. A\r\nprerequisite however, is that the leadership must give an example of\r\nfanatical unity from above. There would not be any failures if the\r\nleaders always had the courage a rifleman must have.\r\n\r\nIndividual acknowledgments: The enemy must be beaten only by attack.\r\nChances are different today than during the offensive of 1918.\r\nNumerically we can use more than 100 divisions. With respect to men,\r\nreserves can be supplied. The material situation is good. Moreover that\r\nwhich is not ready today must be ready tomorrow. The whole thing means\r\nthe end of the World War, not just of a single action. It concerns not\r\njust a single question but the existence or non-existence of the nation.\r\n\r\nI ask you to pass on the spirit of determination to the lower echelons.\r\n\r\n1. The decision is irrevocable.\r\n\r\n2. The only prospect for success, if the whole armed forces are\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the great men of our history must hearten us all. Fate\r\ndemands from us no more than from the great men of German history.\r\nAs long as I live I shall think only of the victory of my people. I\r\nshall shrink from nothing and shall destroy everyone who is opposed to\r\nme. I have decided to live my life so that I can stand unshamed if I\r\nhave to die. I want to destroy the enemy. Behind me stands the German\r\npeople, whose morale can only grow worse. Only he who struggles with\r\ndestiny can have a good intuition. In the last years I have experienced\r\nmany examples of intuition. Even in the present development I see the\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\nIf we come through this struggle victoriously--and we shall come\r\nthrough victoriously--our time will enter into the history of our\r\npeople. I shall stand or fall in this struggle. I shall never survive\r\nthe defeat of my people. No capitulation to the outside forces, no\r\nrevolution from the interior forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 795-PS\r\n\r\n  CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL KEITEL\r\n\r\n  on 17 August 1939\r\n\r\n [Identified by General Keitel as a memorandum of Admiral Canaris]\r\n\r\nI reported my conference with Jost to Keitel. He said that he would not\r\npay any attention to this action, as the Fuehrer had not informed him\r\nand had only let him know that we were to furnish Heydrich with Polish\r\nuniforms. He agreed that I instruct the General Staff. He says that he\r\ndoes not think much of actions of this kind. However, there is nothing\r\nelse to be done if they have been ordered by the Fuehrer, that he could\r\nnot ask the Fuehrer how he had planned the execution of this special\r\naction. In regard to Dirschau he has decided that this action would be\r\nexecuted only by the army.\r\n\r\nI then reported my conference with Roatta. He told me that he thought\r\nit very good if Mussolini would tell the Fuehrer in definite terms\r\nthat he would not enter the war. He personally is of the opinion that\r\nMussolini would join anyhow. I answered him that I believed this\r\nimprobable by reason of the conference between Ciano and Ribbentrop\r\nwhich I reported to him once more in detail. He says that the Fuehrer\r\nhad told him contrarywise. Based on my reports he had to conclude\r\nthat the Fuehrer does not tell him--Keitel--everything. Furthermore, I\r\ntold him that I had learned from Count Marogna that the King of Italy\r\nhad told King Alfonse a few days ago that he would not sign under any\r\ncircumstances if Mussolini should present the order for mobilization.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this Keitel expresses the opinion that it is quite\r\ninteresting to note that even a country like Italy which is governed\r\nby a dictatorship does not think much of war. How much more so must it\r\nbe in the democratic countries? He is confident that the English would\r\nnot interfere. I tried to contradict his views and say that the English\r\nwould certainly at once institute a blockade and would destroy our\r\nmerchant shipping. Keitel believes this to be of no great importance\r\nas we would receive oil from Rumania. I answered that this is not the\r\ndeciding factor and that we could not resist a blockade for a long time\r\nand that England would fight against this with all their means if we\r\nshould use force against the Poles and if it were to come to bloodshed.\r\nI told him that the English would have acted in precisely the same\r\nmanner, had any bloodshed occurred when we marched into Czechoslovakia.\r\nI tried to explain to Keitel the consequences of economic warfare for\r\nGermany and tell him that we have only very few means to counteract\r\nit. Just a short while ago I had heard that we could only send 10\r\nsubmarines into the Atlantic Ocean. Keitel thinks that it should be\r\neasy to force Rumania to surrender her oil after the conquest of\r\nPoland. I called his attention to the actions of the English in the\r\nBalkans and tried to explain to him that the English would certainly\r\nhave everything prepared in the Balkans for such an eventuality.\r\nBulgaria would not be useful to us as an ally as it would be attacked\r\nat once by Rumania and Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 798-PS\r\n\r\n The Fuehrer's speech to the Commanders in Chief on 22 August 1939\r\n\r\nI have called you together to give you a picture of the political\r\nsituation, in order that you may have insight into the individual\r\nelements on which I have based my decision to act and in order to\r\nstrengthen your confidence.\r\n\r\nAfter this we will discuss military details.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come sooner\r\nor later. I had already made this decision in spring, but I thought\r\nthat I would first turn against the West in a few years, and only\r\nafterwards against the East. But the sequence cannot be fixed. One\r\ncannot close one's eyes even before a threatening situation. I wanted\r\nto establish an acceptable relationship with Poland in order to fight\r\nfirst against the West. But this plan, which was agreeable to me, could\r\nnot be executed, since essential points have changed. It became clear\r\nto me, that Poland would attack us in case of a conflict with the\r\nWest. Poland wants access to the sea. The further development became\r\nobvious after the occupation of the Memel region, and it became clear\r\nto me that under circumstances a conflict with Poland could arise at an\r\ninopportune moment. I enumerate as reasons for this reflection:\r\n\r\n1. First of all two personal constitutions:\r\n\r\nMy own personality and that of Mussolini.\r\n\r\nEssentially it depends on me, my existence, because of my political\r\nactivities. Furthermore the fact that probably no one will ever again\r\nhave the confidence of the whole German people as I do. There will\r\nprobably never again be a man in the future with more authority than I\r\nhave. My existence is therefore a factor of great value. But I can be\r\neliminated at any time by a criminal or an idiot.\r\n\r\nThe second personal factor is the Duce. His existence is also decisive.\r\nIf something happens to him, Italy's loyalty to the alliance will no\r\nlonger be certain. The basic attitude of the Italian court is against\r\nthe Duce. Above all, the court sees in the expansion of the empire a\r\nburden. The Duce is the man with the strongest nerves in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe third factor favorable for us is Franco. We can ask only benevolent\r\nneutrality from Spain. But this depends on Franco's personality. He\r\nguarantees a certain uniformity and steadiness of the present system in\r\nSpain. We must take into account the fact that Spain does not as yet\r\nhave a Fascist party of our internal unity.\r\n\r\nOn the other side a negative picture as far as decisive personalities\r\nare concerned. There is no outstanding personality in England or France.\r\n\r\nFor us it is easy to make decision. We have nothing to lose; we can\r\nonly gain. Our economic situation is such, because of our restrictions,\r\nthat we cannot hold out more than a few years. Goering can confirm\r\nthis. We have no other choice, we must act. Our opponents risk much\r\nand can gain only a little. England's stake in a war is unimaginably\r\ngreat. Our enemies have men who are below average. No personalities. No\r\nmasters, no men of action.\r\n\r\nBesides the personal factor, the political situation is favorable for\r\nus; in the Mediterranean rivalry among Italy, France, and England, in\r\nthe Orient tension, which leads to the alarming of the Mohammedan world.\r\n\r\nThe English empire did not emerge from the last war strengthened.\r\nFrom a maritime point of view, nothing was achieved. Conflict between\r\nEngland and Ireland. The South African Union became more independent.\r\nConcessions had to be made to India. England is in great danger.\r\nUnhealthy industries. A British statesman can look into the future only\r\nwith concern.\r\n\r\nFrance's position has also deteriorated particularly in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nFurther favorable factors for us are these:\r\n\r\nSince Albania there is an equilibrium of power in the Balkans.\r\nYugoslavia carries the germ of collapse because of her internal\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nRumania did not grow stronger. She is liable to attack and vulnerable.\r\nShe is threatened by Hungary and Bulgaria. Since Kemal's death, Turkey\r\nhas been ruled by small minds, unsteady, weak men.\r\n\r\nAll these fortunate circumstances will no longer prevail in 2 to 3\r\nyears. No one knows how long I shall live. Therefore conflict better\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe creation of Greater Germany was a great achievement politically,\r\nbut militarily it was questionable, since it was achieved through a\r\nbluff of the political leaders. It is necessary to test the military.\r\nIf at all possible, not by general settlement, but by solving\r\nindividual tasks.\r\n\r\nThe relation to Poland has become unbearable. My Polish policy hitherto\r\nwas in contrast to the ideas of the people. My propositions to Poland\r\n(Danzig corridor) were disturbed by England's intervention. Poland\r\nchanged her tone toward us. The initiative cannot be allowed to pass\r\nto the others. This moment is more favorable than in 2 to 3 years. An\r\nattempt on my life or Mussolini's could change the situation to our\r\ndisadvantage. One cannot eternally stand opposite one another with\r\ncocked rifle. A suggested compromise would have demanded that we change\r\nour convictions and make agreeable gestures. They talked to us again in\r\nthe language of Versailles. There was danger of losing prestige. Now\r\nthe probability is still great that the West will not interfere. We\r\nmust accept the risk with reckless resolution. A politician must accept\r\na risk as much as a military leader. We are facing the alternative to\r\nstrike or to be destroyed with certainty sooner or later.\r\n\r\nReference to previous risks.\r\n\r\nI would have been stoned if I had not carried my point. The most\r\ndangerous step was the invasion of the neutral zone. Only a week\r\nbefore, I got a warning through France. I have always accepted a great\r\nrisk in the conviction that it may succeed.\r\n\r\nNow it is also a great risk. Iron nerves, iron resolution.\r\n\r\nThe following special reasons strengthen my idea. England and France\r\nare obligated, neither is in a position for it. There is no actual\r\nrearmament in England, just propaganda. It has done much damage that\r\nmany reluctant Germans said and wrote to Englishmen after the solution\r\nof the Czech question: The Fuehrer carried his point because you lost\r\nyour nerve, because you capitulated too soon. This explains the present\r\npropaganda war. The English speak of a war of nerves. It is one element\r\nof this war of nerves to present the increase of armament. But how is\r\nBritish rearmament in actual fact? The construction program of the Navy\r\nfor 1938 has not yet been filled. Only mobilization of the reserve\r\nfleet. Purchase of fishing steamers. Considerable strengthening of the\r\nNavy, not before 1941 or 1942.\r\n\r\nLittle has been done on land. England will be able to send a maximum of\r\n3 divisions to the continent. A little has been done for the air force,\r\nbut it is only a beginning. AA defense is in its beginning stages.\r\nAt the moment England has only 150 AA guns. The new AA gun has been\r\nordered. It will take a long time until enough have been produced. Fire\r\ndirectors are lacking. England is still vulnerable from the air. This\r\ncan change in 2 to 3 years. At the moment the English air force has\r\nonly 130,000 men, France 72,000 men, Poland 15,000 men. England does\r\nnot want the conflict to break out for two or three years.\r\n\r\nThe following is characteristic for England. Poland wanted a loan from\r\nEngland for rearmament. England, however, only gave credit in order to\r\nmake sure that Poland buys in England, although England cannot deliver.\r\nThis means that England does not really want to support Poland. She\r\ndoes not risk 8 millions pounds in Poland, although she put half a\r\nbillion into China. England's position in the world is very precarious.\r\nShe will not accept any risks.\r\n\r\nFrance lacks men (decline of the birth rate). Little has been done for\r\nrearmament. The artillery is antiquated. France did not want to enter\r\non this adventure. The West has only two possibilities to fight against\r\nus:\r\n\r\n1. Blockade: It will not be effective because of our autarchy and\r\nbecause we have sources of aid in the east.\r\n\r\n2. Attack from the west from the Maginot line: I consider this\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is the violation of Dutch, Belgium, and Swiss\r\nneutrality. I have no doubts that all these states as well as\r\nScandinavia will defend their neutrality by all available means.\r\nEngland and France will not violate the neutrality of those countries.\r\nActually England cannot help Poland. There remains an attack on Italy.\r\nA military attack is out of the question. No one is counting on a\r\nlonger war. If Mr. von Brauchitsch had told me that I would need 4\r\nyears to conquer Poland I would have replied: then it cannot be done.\r\nIt is nonsense to say that England wants to wage a long war.\r\n\r\nWe will hold our position in the West until we have conquered Poland.\r\nWe must be conscious of our great production. It is much bigger than in\r\n1914-1918.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had another hope, that Russia would become our enemy after\r\nthe conquest of Poland. The enemy did not count on my great power of\r\nresolution. Our enemies are little worms. I saw them in Munich.\r\n\r\nI was convinced that Stalin would never accept the England offer.\r\nRussia has no interest in maintaining Poland and Stalin knows that it\r\nis the end of his regime no matter whether his soldiers come out of\r\na war victoriously or beaten. Litvinow's replacement was decisive. I\r\nbrought about the change toward Russia gradually. In connection with\r\nthe commercial treaty we got into political conversation. Proposal of\r\na non-aggression pact. Then came a general proposal from Russia. Four\r\ndays ago I took a special step, which brought it about that Russia\r\nanswered yesterday that she is ready to sign. The personal contract\r\nwith Stalin is established. The day after tomorrow von Ribbentrop will\r\nconclude the treaty. Now Poland is in the position in which I wanted\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWe need not be afraid of a blockade. The East will supply us with\r\ngrain, cattle, coal, lead and zinc. It is a big arm, which demands\r\ngreat efforts. I am only afraid that at the last minute some\r\nSchweinhund [literally, swineherd's dog; figuratively, filthy person]\r\nwill make a proposal for mediation.\r\n\r\nThe political arm is set farther. A beginning has been made for the\r\ndestruction of England's hegemony. The way is open for the soldier,\r\nafter I have made the political preparations.\r\n\r\nToday's publication of the non-aggression pact with Russia hit like a\r\nshell. The consequences cannot be overlooked. Stalin also said that\r\nthis course will be of benefit to both countries. The effect on Poland\r\nwill be tremendous.\r\n\r\nGoering answers with thanks to the Fuehrer and the assurance that the\r\narmed forces will do their duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 812-PS\r\n\r\n  [Seal]                  Salzburg, 22 Aug. 1939\r\n  The Gauleiter               Chiemsee\r\n  _Personal!_\r\n  _Only direct delivery!_\r\n  To the Reich Minister Dr. Arthur SEYSS-INQUART,\r\n  VIENNA I Ballhausplatz 2\r\n\r\n  Dear Dr. Seyss:\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of 19 August 1939, in which you asked me to\r\ninform you what I know of those matters, which among others, are the\r\nsubject of your correspondence with Buerckel.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to discuss sundry talks and all that has been brought to\r\nmy notice in the course of time by different people. I wish to clarify\r\nessentially my own attitude.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July 1939 I was asked by telephone by the Reich\r\nCommissioner Gauleader Buerckel if I was in possession of the\r\nmemorandum of Globus regarding the events of March. I told him that I\r\ndo not have this memorandum and that I never possessed a single part of\r\nit, that I furthermore did not then participate in the matter and do\r\nnot know its content. Because of official requests by Buerckel I have\r\nentrusted him with a report accompanied by a letter written on the 6th\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nIf Buerckel now writes to you that certain statements were confirmed\r\nby me, I feel obliged to entrust you with a copy each of my copies\r\nof those two documents, which were only written in single originals.\r\nI shall specially inform Buerckel of this. I connect this with\r\nthe declaration, that I have given--apart from those written\r\nexplanations--no confirmations, declarations, or criticisms whatsoever\r\nregarding you and your attitude and that I have authorized nobody to\r\nrefer to any statements of mine.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of our collaboration I have always expressed and\r\nrepresented forcefully my ideas regarding yourself and my opinion of\r\nyour personality. This conception of mine was the very basis of our\r\ncollaboration. The events of February and March have not changed this,\r\nespecially since I considered the political success of the 11th March\r\nmerely as a confirmation of the intentions and convictions which have\r\nequally induced both of us to collaborate.\r\n\r\nAs far as Globus is concerned you are fully aware of his species which\r\nI judged always and in every situation only by its good side. I believe\r\nthat you already talked to Globus about the occurrences between the\r\n11th of March 1938 and today; and I am convinced that he will tell you\r\neverything that is bothering him, if you will speak to him about this\r\nmatter, as is your intention.\r\n\r\n  With the best regards and\r\n  HEIL HITLER!\r\n  Yours\r\n  _2 enclosures._    [signed]      Friedl Rainer\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy.\r\n\r\n  Salzburg, 6 July 1939\r\n  To the Reich Commissar Gauleiter Josef Buerckel\r\n  _Vienna I_\r\n  Parliament\r\n\r\n  Dear Party Member Buerckel!\r\n\r\nSoon after taking over in Austria, Klausner, Globocnik, and I flew\r\nto Berlin to report to Hitler's deputy, Hess, about the events which\r\nled to our taking over the government. We did this because we had the\r\nimpression that the general opinion, perhaps also Hitler's own, was\r\nthat the liberation depended more on Austrian matters of state rather\r\nthan the party. To be more exact. Hitler especially mentioned Dr.\r\nSeyss-Inquart alone; and public opinion gave him alone credit for the\r\nchange and thus believed him to have played the sole leading role.\r\n\r\nThis conception does not, however, correspond to the true proportions\r\nof powers and to the conditions of leadership which were completely\r\nclear until 12 March 1938. At that time I gave a short report in\r\nKlausner's behalf to the deputy of Hitler and also submitted a short\r\nsummary of the developments since 1934. I made no single copy of this.\r\nI did not take part in further actions of this kind since they seemed\r\nto me to be too much connected with personal feelings. I think the\r\nmain reason for the fact that the person of Dr. Seyss-Inquart seemed\r\nto Hitler and to public opinion to have stepped in the limelight in\r\nthose March days, was that no position existed in the party from which\r\none might have presented oneself to the public; and that there was no\r\nman who had the guts to let himself be presented. The actual reason\r\nwas that the party leadership had to remain secret during the whole\r\nillegal fight, secret even from the Reich German public. He who wanted\r\nto direct correctly the political battle of the Austrian nazism had\r\nto forego public fame. Leopold did not want to forego that and made\r\nsuch decisive political mistakes that his recall became necessary.\r\nThe person of Klausner never longed for fame and was therefore not\r\nsuitable to appear gloriously after the taking over of power. The\r\ntwo powers behind Klausner--I consider the dynamic part of Globocnik\r\nand the political part of myself--were bound from the beginning, as\r\ncollaborators of Klausner's, to put him to the fore.\r\n\r\nWe saw in March and April how a false picture about the actual\r\nleadership conditions developed from this fact which could not\r\nbe corrected in spite of our attempts to that effect. This was\r\nan important factor for the varying moods of Globocnik who hoped\r\nespecially from you that you would emphasize for Hitler and also for\r\nthe public the role of the party during the events preceding 12 March\r\n1938. I limited myself to address this verbal and written declaration\r\nto party member Hess, and furthermore to secure the documents from\r\nthe March days. In addition, I spoke at every available opportunity\r\nabout the fight of the party. I did not undertake steps to give just\r\ncredit to other persons for the glory which was excessively ascribed\r\nto one person, Dr. Seyss-Inquart; and I would not do that, primarily\r\nbecause I appear as a beneficiary, and furthermore because I believe\r\nthat I would not gladden Hitler by doing so. I am also convinced\r\nthat Dr. Seyss-Inquart did not act crookedly, and furthermore that\r\nHitler does not want to commit an act of historical justice by special\r\npreference of his person, but that he is attracted to him personally.\r\nIt really is of no great account to Hitler if this or that person was\r\nmore or less meritorious, in this sector of the great fight of the\r\nmovement. Because, in the last analysis, by far the greatest part is\r\nto be ascribed only to him; he alone will be considered by history as\r\nthe liberator of Austria. I, therefore, considered it best to accept\r\nexisting conditions and look for new fertile fields of endeavor in the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIf I should be asked to describe--without personal interest--the role\r\nof the party according to my best conviction, I am ready to do so at\r\nany time. For this reason I promised yesterday to submit to you again a\r\nshort summary, and to make it available for your confidential use. Of\r\nthis letter and of this abbreviated description I retain the sole copy.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Rainer e.h.\r\n  1 Enclosure\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOPY.\r\n\r\n Report on the events in the NSDAP of Austria since the beginning of\r\n the last stage of battle until the seizure of power on the 11th March\r\n 1938.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 the Party fought a parliamentary battle. By the seizure of\r\npower in the Reich it gained considerably in numbers. It started to\r\ntry to enforce new elections in order to gain admission into the\r\ngovernment. By these means it should have taken over the government.\r\nThe enemies recognized this fact, and the Government Dollfuss preceded,\r\nwhile tolerating the reds, to force the NSDAP from its legal plane in\r\norder to render it innocuous. In this the government used legal tricks,\r\nthereby practically doing away progressively with the democratic\r\nconstitution. The first attempts of the government were answered by the\r\nParty with an increase of pressure; and the government's breaches of\r\nconstitution were answered by arbitrary acts with the assumption that\r\nit might thus be able to overthrow the government. This assumption was\r\nwrong; at that time the government had the backing of all anti-German\r\nforeign countries, and it felt sufficiently strong to prohibit the\r\nNSDAP, and confession of adherence to the NSDAP, and subsequently to\r\ntreat as high treason the confession in favor of the \"Anschluss\".\r\n\r\nThus the first stage of battle commenced which ended with the July\r\nrising of 1934. The decision for the July rising was right, and the\r\nexecution of it was faulty. The result was a complete destruction\r\nof the organization; the loss of entire groups of fighters through\r\nimprisonment or flight into the \"Alt-Reich\"; and with regard to the\r\npolitical relationship of Germany to Austria, a formal acknowledgement\r\nof the existence of the Austrian State by the German Government.\r\nWith the telegram to Papen, instructing him to reinstitute normal\r\nrelationships between the two states, the Fuehrer had liquidated the\r\nfirst stage of the battle; and a new method of political penetration\r\nwas to begin. By order of the Fuehrer the Landesleitung Munich was\r\ndissolved, and the party in Austria was left to its own resources.\r\n\r\nThere was no acknowledged leader for the entire party in Austria. New\r\nleaderships were forming in the mine Gaus. The process was again and\r\nagain interrupted by the interference of the police; there was no\r\nliaison between the formations, and frequently there were two, three\r\nor more rival leaderships. The first evident, acknowledged speaker of\r\nalmost all the Gaus in Autumn 1934 was engineer Reinthaller (already\r\nappointed Landesbauernfuehrer [leader of the country's farmers]\r\nby Hess). He endeavoured to bring about a political appeasement\r\nby negotiations with the government, with the purpose of giving\r\nthe N.S.D.A.P. legal status again, thus permitting its political\r\nactivities. Simultaneously Reinthaller started the reconstruction of\r\nthe illegal political organization, at the head of which he had placed\r\nengineer Neubacher.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to create a legal political organization which was\r\nto negotiate with the Government while a secret illegal organization\r\nexisted, did not succeed; it brought about quarrels in almost all\r\nGaus and ended with pressure of the illegal branch against the policy\r\nof appeasement of Reinthaller, and with the latter's retirement as\r\nLandesleiter [country leader]. The successor, Neubacher, head of the\r\nillegal organization, was not recognized by all the Gaus, because\r\nmeanwhile the former Gauleader of Lower Austria, Captain Leopold,\r\nwas released; and he claimed the country leadership because of his\r\nseniority in the party. In Carinthia at about that time, Klausner\r\nwith his collaborators Globocnik, Rainer, Longhin and Pawlowski had\r\nreconstructed and readied the Gau Carinthia. The Gau Carinthia kept\r\naway from the quarrels of the leaders, and arbitrated the differences\r\nbetween Leopold and Neubacher, and finally effected a solution in\r\nsuch a way that Neubacher and his adherents recognized Leopold as the\r\ncountry leader; and Leopold appointed Neubacher to be his deputy. The\r\npoints of friction between those two groups were not yet eliminated.\r\nThose differences did not remain concealed from the police; and the\r\npolice got hold of a polemic by the group of Leopold against the group\r\nof Neubacher, on the strength of this material they arrested Leopold\r\nand Neubacher.\r\n\r\nAt that time the success of the calm attitude of the Gau Carinthia was\r\ncrowned by the fact that after these arrests the representatives of all\r\nthe Gaus came to Carinthia to offer Klausner the country leadership.\r\nBy order of Klausner Dr. Rainer reported at these conferences the\r\npolitical referendum and developed the political conception as adopted\r\nby the Gau Carinthia on the basis of which, as a matter of fact, an\r\nagreement was reached. In July 1935 Klausner became the head of the\r\nmovement without, however adopting the title of country leader because\r\nhe considered it wrong as long as the country leader Leopold was\r\nimprisoned, but he looked upon himself as the speaker of the college\r\nof Gauleaders. With the consent of the representatives of all the\r\nGaus, Klausner at that time appointed Globocnik as co-worker for the\r\norganizational part, and Rainer as co-worker for the political part of\r\nhis task.\r\n\r\nIn August some further arrests took place, the victims of which were,\r\napart from the Gauleaders, also Globocnik and Rainer. Schattenfroh\r\nthen claimed, because of an instruction received from the imprisoned\r\nLeopold, to have been made deputy country leader. A group led by\r\nengineer Raffelsberger had at this time also established connections\r\nwith departments of the Alt-Reich (Ministry of Propaganda, German\r\nRacial Agency, etc.) and made an attempt to formulate a political\r\nmotto in the form of a program for the fighting movement of Austria.\r\nIn Spring of 1936 Schattenfroh was arrested; he had named party member\r\nHinterleitner of Linz as his successor as managerial country leader.\r\nIn March Klausner was arrested in connection with the arrest of about\r\n60 leading Nazis, whereas Dr. Rainer was released. Hinterleitner again\r\nfollowed those directives which were set down at the conferences at\r\nCarinthia in the Spring of 1935; and in May 1936 he appointed Rainer,\r\nGlobocnik and engineer Hiedler to the country leadership in the\r\nfollowing spheres of influence:\r\n\r\nRainer to be chief of the political staff; Hiedler as chief of the\r\norganization; and Globocnik as liaison officer with the Reich and as\r\norganizer of all the auxiliary bases outside of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the construction of the organization were: The\r\norganization is the bearer of the illegal fight and the trustee of the\r\nidea to create a secret organization, in a simple manner and without\r\ncompromise, according to the principle of organizing an elite to be\r\navailable to the illegal land-party council upon any emergency. Besides\r\nthis, all political opportunities should be taken and all legal people\r\nand legal chances should be used without revealing any ties with the\r\nillegal organization. Therefore, co-operation between the illegal party\r\norganization and the legal political aides was anchored at the top of\r\nthe party leadership. All connections with the party in Germany were\r\nkept secret in accordance with the orders of the Fuehrer. These said\r\nthat the German state should officially be omitted from the creation of\r\nan Austrian NSDAP; and that auxiliary centers for propaganda, press,\r\nrefugees, welfare, etc. should be established in the foreign countries\r\nbordering Austria.\r\n\r\nHinterleitner already contacted the lawyer Seyss-Inquart, who had\r\nconnection with Dr. Wachter which originated from Seyss-Inquart's\r\nsupport of the July uprising. On the other side Seyss-Inquart had\r\na good position in the legal field and especially well-established\r\nrelations with Christian-Social politicians. Dr. Seyss-Inquart came\r\nfrom the ranks of the \"Styrian Heimatschutz\" and became a party\r\nmember when the entire \"Styrian Heimatschutz\" was incorporated into\r\nthe NSDAP. Another personality who had a good position in the legal\r\nfield was Col. Glaise-Horstenau who had contacts with both sides. The\r\nagreement of 11 July 1936 was strongly influenced by the activities of\r\nthese two persons. Papen mentioned Glaise-Horstenau to the Fuehrer as\r\nbeing a trusted person.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Fuehrer wished to see the leaders of the party\r\nin Austria in order to tell them his opinion on what Austrian\r\nNational-Socialists should do. Meanwhile Hinterleiter was arrested,\r\nand Dr. Rainer became his successor and leader of the Austrian party.\r\nOn 16 July 1936, Dr. Rainer and Globocnik visited the Fuehrer at the\r\n\"Obersalzburg\" where they received a clear explanation of the situation\r\nand the wishes of the Fuehrer. On 17 July 1936, all illegal Gauleiters\r\nmet in Anif near Salzburg, where they received a complete report from\r\nRainer on the statement of the Fuehrer and his political instructions\r\nfor carrying out the fight. At the same conference the Gauleiters\r\nreceived organizational instructions from Globocnik and Hiedler.\r\n\r\nUpon the proposal of Globocnik, the Fuehrer named Lt. Gen.\r\n[Gruppenfuehrer] Keppler as chief of the mixed commission which was\r\nappointed, in accordance with the state treaty of 11 July 1936, to\r\nsupervise the correct execution of the agreement. At the same time\r\nKeppler was given full authority by the Fuehrer for the party in\r\nAustria. After Keppler was unsuccessful in his efforts to cooperate\r\nwith Leopold, he worked together with Dr. Rainer, Globocnik,\r\nReinthaller as leader of the peasants, Kaltenbrunner as leader of the\r\nSS, and Dr. Jury as deputy-leader of the Austrian party, as well as\r\nwith Glaise-Horstenau and Seyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\nRegarding internal conditions, it was clear that full recognition\r\nof the party leadership was given by Seyss-Inquart. He was also in\r\npermanent contact with Capt. Leopold, and there were never any serious\r\nconflicts between them. But he also acknowledged the correctness of Dr.\r\nRainer's political interpretations, and the actual leadership of Dr.\r\nRainer in all political actions. The situation was much the same with\r\nGlaise-Horstenau who was whole-heartedly for Rainer and Globocnik but\r\nalways carefully guarded the legal party position of Leopold.\r\n\r\nDue to the cooperation of the above-mentioned people with group leader\r\nKeppler and other officials of the Reich and due to the activities of\r\nother contact-men in Austria, it was possible to obtain the appointment\r\nof Seyss-Inquart as \"Staatsrat\" (councillor of state) in July 1937.\r\nDue to the same facts, the Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg was forced to\r\ntake a new so-called \"satisfactory action\". Through all this a new\r\nand stronger political position was won in the Austrian system. The\r\nNational-Socialist Party became acceptable again in the political\r\nfield and became a partner with whom one had to negotiate, even when\r\nit was not officially incorporated into internal Austrian political\r\ndevelopments. This complicated political maneuver, accompanied by the\r\nsteadily increasing pressure from the Reich, led to the talks between\r\nthe Fuehrer and Schuschnigg at the Obersalzberg. Here Gruppenfuehrer\r\nKeppler presented the concrete political demands of the fighting\r\nunderground movement, which he estimated according to his personal\r\nexperiences and the information he received. The results of these talks\r\nwere the right of a free acknowledgment of the National Socialist\r\nmovement on the one hand and the recognition of an independent Austrian\r\nstate on the other hand, as well as the appointment of Seyss-Inquart\r\nas Minister of Interior and Public Safety, as a person who will\r\nguarantee to both sides the proper carrying out of the agreements.\r\nIn this way Seyss-Inquart occupied the key position and was in the\r\ncenter of all obvious political actions. A legal base in the government\r\nwas won for the party. This resulted in a paralysis of the \"system\r\napparatus\" (Schuschnigg government) at a time when a revolution needed\r\nto be carried out. Through this, the basis for a new attack on the\r\nSchuschnigg government was won.\r\n\r\nAnother result of the agreement was the appointment by the Fuehrer of\r\nLeopold as a member of the Staff of Hess. After a long, personal talk\r\nwith Klausner, the Fuehrer appointed him as leader of the Austrian\r\nNational Socialists, upon recommendation of Keppler. The relationship\r\nbetween Seyss-Inquart and Klausner was as follows: Seyss-Inquart\r\nacknowledged unconditionally the party leadership and actions taken by\r\nit; and he also acknowledged Klausner as the leader of the party. As a\r\nparty member he was under the command of Klausner and received orders\r\nfrom him. But as a result of the agreement at Berchtesgaden and the\r\nstatement the Fuehrer made to him during his state visit in Berlin,\r\nSeyss-Inquart was the personal trustee of the Fuehrer and directly\r\nresponsible to him for the illegal NSDAP in Austria within the confines\r\nof his political sphere. Seyss-Inquart also acknowledged the free\r\npolitical initiative of the party leader of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe \"Landesleitung\" received word about the planned plebiscite through\r\nillegal information services, on 9 March 1938 at 10 a.m. At the session\r\nwhich was called immediately afterwards, Seyss-Inquart explained that\r\nhe had known about this for only a few hours, but that he could not\r\ntalk about it because he had given his word to keep silent on this\r\nsubject. But during the talks he made us understand that the illegal\r\ninformation we received was based on truth, and that in view of the new\r\nsituation, he had been cooperating with the \"Landesleitung\" from the\r\nvery first moment. Klausner, Jury, Rainer, Globocnik and Seyss-Inquart\r\nwere present at the first talks which were held at 10 a.m. There it\r\nwas decided that first, the Fuehrer had to be informed immediately;\r\nsecondly, the opportunity for the Fuehrer to intervene must be given to\r\nhim by way of an official declaration made by Minister Seyss-Inquart\r\nto Schuschnigg; and thirdly, Seyss-Inquart must negotiate with the\r\ngovernment until clear instructions and orders were received from\r\nthe Fuehrer. Seyss-Inquart and Rainer together composed a letter to\r\nSchuschnigg, and only one copy of it was brought to the Fuehrer by\r\nGlobocnik, who flew to him on the afternoon of 9 March 1938.\r\n\r\nNegotiations with the government were not successful. Therefore they\r\nwere stopped by Seyss-Inquart in accordance with the instructions he\r\nreceived from the Fuehrer. On the 10th March all preparations for\r\nfuture revolutionary actions had already been made, and the necessary\r\norders given to all units leaders. During the night of the 10th to\r\n11th, Globocnik returned from the Fuehrer with the announcement that\r\nthe Fuehrer gave the party freedom of action and that he would back\r\nit in everything it did. Rainer then gave the final instruction for\r\nFriday, the 11th of March, and explained that three situations might\r\ndevelop within the following days:\r\n\r\n1st Case: The plebiscite will not be held. In this case, a great\r\ndemonstration must be held.\r\n\r\n2nd Case: Schuschnigg will resign. In this case, a demonstration was\r\nordered in taking over the government power.\r\n\r\n3rd Case: Schuschnigg will take up the fight. In this case, all party\r\nleaders were ordered to act upon their own initiative, using all means\r\nto capture the position of power.\r\n\r\nDr. Seyss-Inquart took part in these talks with the Gauleiters.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 11 March, the minister Glaise-Horstenau arrived in Vienna\r\nafter a visit with the Fuehrer. After talks with Seyss-Inquart he\r\nwent to see the chancellor. At 11:30 a.m. the \"Landesleitung\" had a\r\nmeeting at which Klausner, Rainer, Globocnik, Jury, Seyss-Inquart,\r\nGlaise-Horstenau, Fishboeck and Muehlmann participated. Dr.\r\nSeyss-Inquart reported on his talks with Dr. Schuschnigg which had\r\nended in a rejection of the proposal of the two ministers.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Rainer's proposal, von Klausner ordered that the\r\ngovernment be presented with an ultimatum, expiring at 1400 hours,\r\nsigned by legal political, \"Front\" men, including both ministers and\r\nalso State Councillors Fishboeck and Jury, for the establishment of a\r\nvoting date in three weeks and a free and secret ballot in accordance\r\nwith the constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of written evidence which Glaise-Horstenau had brought\r\nwith him a leaflet, to be printed in millions of copies, and a telegram\r\nto the Fuehrer calling for help, were prepared.\r\n\r\nKlausner placed the leadership of the final political actions in\r\nthe hands of Rainer and Globocnik. Schuschnigg called a session of\r\nall ministers for 2:00 p.m. Rainer agreed with Seyss-Inquart that\r\nRainer would send the telegram to the Fuehrer and the statement to\r\nthe population at 3:00 p.m. and at the same time he would start all\r\nnecessary actions to take over power unless he received news from\r\nthe session of the ministers' council before that time. During this\r\ntime all measures had been prepared. At 2:30, Seyss-Inquart 'phoned\r\nRainer and informed him that Schuschnigg had been unable to take the\r\npressure and had recalled the plebiscite but that he had refused to\r\ncall a new plebiscite and had ordered the strongest police measures\r\nfor maintaining order. Rainer asked whether the two ministers had\r\nresigned, and Seyss-Inquart answered \"No.\" Rainer informed the\r\n\"Reichskanzlei\" through the German Embassy, and received an answer from\r\nGoering through the same channels that the Fuehrer will not consent to\r\npartial solutions and that Schuschnigg must resign. Seyss-Inquart was\r\ninformed of this by Globocnik and Muehlmann; talks were had between\r\nSeyss-Inquart and Schuschnigg: Schuschnigg resigned. Seyss-Inquart\r\nasked Rainer what measures the party wished taken. Rainer's answer:\r\nReestablishment of the government by Seyss-Inquart, legalization of the\r\nparty, and calling up of the SS and SA as auxiliaries to the police\r\nforce. Seyss-Inquart promised to have these measures carried out, but\r\nvery soon the announcement followed that everything might be threatened\r\nby the resistance of Miklas. Meanwhile word arrived from the German\r\nEmbassy that the Fuehrer expected the establishment of a government\r\nunder Seyss-Inquart with a national majority, the legalization of\r\nthe party, and permission for the legion to return, all within the\r\nspecified time of 7:30 p.m.; otherwise, German troops would cross the\r\nborder at 8:00 p.m. At 5:00 p.m., Rainer and Globocnik, accompanied by\r\nMuehlmann, went to the Chancellor's office to carry out this errand.\r\n\r\nSituation: Miklas negotiated with Ender for the creation of a\r\ngovernment which included, blacks, reds and National Socialists, and\r\nproposed the post of Vice-Chancellor to Seyss-Inquart. The latter\r\nrejected it and told Rainer that he was not able to negotiate by\r\nhimself because he was personally involved, and therefore a weak\r\nand unpleasant political situation might result. Rainer negotiated\r\nwith Zernette. Director of the cabinet Huber, Guide Schmidt,\r\nGlaise-Horstenau, Legation Councillor Stein, Military Attache General\r\nMuffe, and the \"Gruppenfuehrer\" Keppler, who had arrived in the\r\nmeantime, were also negotiating. At 7:00 p.m. Seyss-Inquart entered the\r\nnegotiations again. Situation at 7:30 p.m.: Stubborn refusal of Miklas\r\nto appoint Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor; appeal to the world in case of\r\na German invasion.\r\n\r\nGruppenfuehrer Keppler explained that the Fuehrer did not yet have an\r\nurgent reason for the invasion. This reason must first be created. The\r\nsituation in Vienna and in the country is most dangerous. It is feared\r\nthat street fights will break out any moment because Rainer ordered the\r\nentire party to demonstrate at 3 o'clock. Rainer proposed storming and\r\nseizing the government palace in order to force the reconstruction of\r\nthe government. The proposal was rejected by Keppler but was carried\r\nout by Rainer after he discussed it with Globocnik. After 8:00 p.m.\r\nthe SA and SS marched in and occupied the government buildings and all\r\nimportant positions in the city of Vienna. At 8:30 p.m. Rainer, with\r\nthe approval of Klausner, ordered all Gauleiters of Austria to take\r\nover power in all eight \"gaus\" of Austria, with the help of the SS and\r\nSA and with instructions that all government representatives who try to\r\nresist should be told that this action was taken on order of Chancellor\r\nSeyss-Inquart.\r\n\r\nWith this, the revolution broke out, and this resulted in the complete\r\noccupation of Austria within three hours and the taking over of all\r\nimportant posts by the party. * * *\r\n\r\nThe seizure of power was the work of the party supported by the\r\nFuehrer's threat of invasion and the legal standing of Seyss-Inquart\r\nin the government. The national result in the form of the taking over\r\nof the government by Seyss-Inquart was due to the actual seizure of\r\npower by the party on one hand, and the political efficiency of Dr.\r\nSeyss-Inquart in his territory on the other; but both factors may be\r\nconsidered only in the relation to the Fuehrer's decision on 9 March\r\n1938 to solve the Austrian problem under any circumstances and the\r\norders consequently issued by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\n  6.7.1939      Rainer e. h.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 829-PS\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  The Chief of the OKW\r\n  WFST. / Abt. L (IV/Qu)\r\n  Nr. 002060/41 g. Kdos.\r\n\r\n  F.H. Qu., 16 September 1941\r\n  40 copies, 32nd copy\r\n\r\n  _Subject_: Communist insurrection in the occupied territories.\r\n\r\n1. Since the campaign against Soviet Russia started there have been\r\ncommunist insurrections everywhere in the territories occupied by\r\nGermany. The actions range from propaganda and assaults against single\r\nmembers of the armed forces to open revolt and spreading guerilla\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this is a _mass movement which is centrally\r\ndirected from Moscow_ and to which also the single and seemingly\r\ntrifling incidents are to be ascribed occurring in areas which have\r\nbeen quiet so far.\r\n\r\nDue to the manifold political and economic tensions in the occupied\r\nterritories we must also expect _nationalistic and other groups_ to\r\ntake advantage of the situation and to instigate difficulties for the\r\nGerman occupation troops by joining the communist insurrection.\r\n\r\nThis way an increasing _danger for the German conduct of the war_\r\narises which becomes apparent first by generally unsafe conditions for\r\nthe occupation troops and already has led to troops being detached to\r\nthe main centers of the unrest.\r\n\r\n2. Previous measures to counteract this general communist insurrection\r\nhave proved inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has now ordered that _everywhere the most drastic means_\r\nare to be employed in order to quench the movement within the shortest\r\ntime possible.\r\n\r\nOnly in this manner which has always been employed successfully by\r\ngreat nations in the history of their conquests quiet can be restored.\r\n\r\n3. The following _directives_ are to be observed:\r\n\r\n_a._ In each case of _revolt_ against the German occupation force\r\n_Communist sources_ are to be suspected regardless of what the\r\nindividual circumstances are.\r\n\r\n_b._ To nip the plots in the bud the most drastic means are to be\r\nemployed immediately at the first provocation in order to make the\r\nauthority of the occupation force prevail and to prevent further\r\nspreading. Attention should be paid to the fact that a human life\r\nin the countries concerned often means nothing and only by unusual\r\nseverity can a deterrent effect be achieved. In these cases the life\r\nof one German soldier must be atoned for by the death sentence for 50\r\nto 100 communists, as a rule. The manner of execution shall further\r\nincrease the deterrent effect.\r\n\r\nThe opposite procedure to use relatively mild punishment first and\r\nto do with the threat of more severe action as a deterrent is not in\r\naccordance with these principles and therefore should not be employed.\r\n\r\n_c._ The _political relationships_ between Germany and the respective\r\ncountry in question are irrelevant for the attitude of the military\r\noccupation authorities.\r\n\r\nTo the contrary, it is to be considered and emphasized by propaganda\r\nthat striking with energy will also liberate the native populations\r\nfrom communist criminals and result to their benefit.\r\n\r\nClever propaganda of this kind consequently will not cause undesirable\r\nreactions of the friendly parts of the population on account of the\r\nsevere measures against the communists.\r\n\r\n_d._ _Native men_ will generally be a failure in the execution of such\r\nmeasures of force. Their strengthening brings an increased danger for\r\nour own troops and therefore must not be allowed.\r\n\r\nHowever, prizes and rewards should be lavishly offered to the\r\npopulation in order to ensure its cooperation in a suitable way.\r\n\r\n_e._ If as an exception _court martial_ is to be opened in connection\r\nwith communist revolts or other offenses against the German occupation\r\nforce, the most drastic penalties are to be imposed.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the death penalty only can be an actual means having\r\ndeterrent effect. Particularly acts of espionage and sabotage and\r\nattempts to join a foreign army are, as a rule, to be punished with\r\ndeath. Also in cases of bearing arms without permission the death\r\nsentence is to be imposed in general.\r\n\r\n4. The _commanders in the occupied territories_ see to it that these\r\nprinciples are made known to all military offices without delay which\r\nhave to deal with communist acts of revolt.\r\n\r\n  Certified          /s/      Keitel\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  M.V.J.\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n\r\n    Commander of Armed Forces South-East\r\n                              [W.

The Fuehrer and commander in\r\nchief of the armed forces commands that crimes of the specified sort\r\ncommitted by civilians of the occupied territories are to be punished\r\nby the pertinent courts martial in the occupied territories _only_ when\r\n\r\n(_a_) The sentence calls for the death penalty\r\n\r\n _and_ (_b_) the sentence is pronounced within 8 days after the arrest.\r\n\r\nOnly when both conditions are met does the Fuehrer and commander in\r\nchief of the armed forces hope for the desired deterrent effect from\r\nthe conduct of punitive proceedings in the occupied territories.\r\n\r\nIn other cases in the future the accused are to be secretly brought\r\nto Germany and the further conduct of the trial carried on here. The\r\ndeterrent effect of these measures lies\r\n\r\n(_a_) in allowing the disappearance of the accused without a trace,\r\n\r\n(_b_) therein, that no information whatsoever may be given about their\r\nwhereabouts and their fate.\r\n\r\nThis decree brings only insignificant changes of their activity to the\r\nintelligence [Abwehr] agencies. Now as before the intelligence agencies\r\ndetermine the time for the arrest of the espionage and sabotage\r\nsuspect. However, in conjunction with establishment of the time it\r\nmust however be considered now that previous to the arrest evidence\r\nfully sufficient for the conviction of the perpetrator must if possible\r\nbe on hand, for further investigation hardly comes into question after\r\nthe seizure, since a sentence must take place within 8 days, or on the\r\nother hand further investigation _on the spot_ by confrontation is made\r\nimpossible by the evacuation of the prisoners to Germany. Therefore\r\ncontact should be made with the pertinent military court previous to\r\nthe arrest in order to check on the question as to whether or not the\r\ncollected evidence suffices.\r\n\r\nWhen in the opinion of the pertinent court martial and/or the military\r\ncommander an immediate conviction on the spot is not possible,\r\nand the perpetrators are therefore to be evacuated to Germany,\r\nthe intelligence agencies will inform Reich security headquarters\r\n[Reichssicherheitshauptamt] in Berlin SW 11, Prinz Albrecht-Str. 8,\r\nattention of Herr Kriminaldirektor Fischer, directly, with a statement\r\nof the exact number of prisoners and the groups that belong together\r\naccording to the circumstances of the individual case. Insofar as in\r\nindividual cases the superior commander has an urgent interest in the\r\nconviction by a Wehrmacht court, this will be brought to the attention\r\nof Reich security headquarters. A copy of the whole report to Reich\r\nsecurity headquarters is to be sent to the Foreign Office/Intelligence,\r\nIntelligence Department III.\r\n\r\nThe Reich security headquarters will determine a state police office,\r\ndepending on accommodation possibilities, which will take over the\r\nprisoners. This state police office makes contact with the proper\r\nintelligence office and arranges the details of the evacuation,\r\nparticularly if it will be handled by the secret military police,\r\nmilitary police, or by the Gestapo itself, as well as manner and place\r\nof transfer of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the Fuehrer is to be applied, to begin with, only in\r\nthe occupied western territories (Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, and\r\nNorthern France, France).\r\n\r\nThe intelligence agencies must make report to the chief of staff on the\r\nabove regulations decreed by the foreign office intelligencer.\r\n\r\n  For the Chief of the Wehrmacht High Command\r\n  Signature: CANARIS\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n\r\n  To (Intelligence III)                       127\r\n  _For information_:\r\n      West (Armed Forces Operational staff.)    1\r\n      WR                                       15\r\n\r\n      Foreign Office Intelligence Z, ZR         2\r\n\r\n      Foreign Department                        1\r\n\r\n      Intelligence III\r\n\r\n      W, H, M, Air\r\n      FPdW, F, C, C1, C2, each 1                9\r\n\r\n      Wi                                        1\r\n\r\n      U                                         2\r\n\r\n      Reich Security Headquarters,\r\n      Department IV E,\r\n      attention of Kriminaldirektor Fischer     1\r\n\r\n      Original                                  1\r\n\r\n      Supply                                   40\r\n                                             ----\r\n\r\n                                              200\r\n                                             ====\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 835-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  _14 n 16.18 WR_(_1/3_)\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 35, Tirpitzufer 72-76 2 September 1944\r\n  Telephone Local 218191\r\n  Long distance 218091\r\n\r\n Refer to file number date and content.\r\n\r\n To the German Armistice Commission re letter of 10.8.44 Az. 630/44.\r\n\r\n _For information to: OKW/WFSt/Qu/Verw.1_, WFSt/Foreign Office Group.\r\n\r\n _Concerns_: Status of Political Prisoners.\r\n\r\n _Reference_: Fuehrer decree of 30.7.44 (OKW/WFSt/Qu 2/Verw.1 Nr.\r\n 009169 g.K.) and decree OKW of 18.2.44 (_WFSt/Qu 2/Verw.1 Nr. 009169\r\n g.K._) WR 1/3 Nr. 79/44 g.K.\r\n\r\nConforming to the decrees, all non-German civilians in occupied\r\nterritory who have endangered the security and readiness for action of\r\nthe occupying power by acts of terror and sabotage or in other ways are\r\nto be surrendered to the security police and to the security service\r\n(SD).

The National League of Germans abroad [VDA] is the association\r\nresponsible for national work beyond the frontiers. At the head of\r\nthe association, the new statutes of the VDA provide for a League\r\nDirectorate consisting for the most part of leading party members\r\nin place of an independent League Director, whose office has been\r\ncancelled. Professor Karl Haushofer (Gen. ret.) has taken over the\r\nchairmanship of this Directorate. Party member Paul Meike is business\r\nmanager of the League Directorate of the VDA and in this capacity\r\nhe combines membership of the department of the Agency for Racial\r\nGermans with managing the VDA on lines which are in accordance with\r\nthe instructions of the Director of the Agency for Racial Germans.\r\nThus the VDA can no longer take action on its own which affects the\r\nwhole association. The VDA is organized into State Associations\r\n[Landesverbaende], which correspond in area to the Gaue of the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n2. The German Eastern League [BDO] is the association responsible\r\nfor work on the border country. SS-Oberfuehrer Dr. Behrends, the\r\ndeputy of the Director of the Agency for Racial Germans, is charged,\r\nuntil further notice, with its direction. Party Member Hoffmeyer is\r\nthe responsible manager of the German Eastern League. He directs its\r\nbusiness affairs according to the instructions of the Director of the\r\nAgency for Racial Germans, and is a member of the staff of the Agency\r\nfor Racial Germans. The BDO is organized into State Groups, whose\r\nregional borders correspond to those of the \"Gaue\" of the NSDAP.\r\n\r\n3. All other associations for racial work and work in the border\r\ncountry (Patriotic Associations) [Heimattreue Verdaende] etc., are\r\nalternately transferred, according to their activities, to the\r\nassociations mentioned under 1 and 2. The managers of VDA and BDO are\r\ncommissioned to take the necessary measures for the incorporating of\r\nthese associations.\r\n\r\n4. The VDA is solely responsible for racial work beyond the frontiers.\r\nI herewith forbid the Party, its organizations and affiliated\r\nassociations from all racial work abroad. The only competent body\r\nfor this task is the Agency for Racial Germans, and the VDA as its\r\ncamouflaged tool. Within the Reich the VDA, generally speaking, is\r\nresponsible only for providing the means for racial work beyond the\r\nfrontiers. The VDA must be supported in this in every way by the Party\r\noffices. Any outward appearance of a connection with the Party is,\r\nhowever to be avoided.\r\n\r\n5. The BDO is at the disposal of the Gauleiters of the frontier \"Gaue\"\r\nfor political duties on the frontiers. In addition, the establishment\r\nof a frontier territory bureau [Granzlandamt] for the following \"Gaue\"\r\nhas been agreed to, in cases where such a bureau is not already in\r\nexistence:\r\n\r\n  East Prussia,\r\n  Pomerania,\r\n  Mark Brandenburg,\r\n  Silesia,\r\n  Sudetenland,\r\n  Bavarian Ostmark,\r\n  Upper Danube,\r\n  Lower Danube.\r\n\r\nIn all other \"Gaue,\" special frontier territory bureaux or\r\nrepresentatives would be superfluous and are therefore not to be\r\nestablished. Should they already exist, they are to be dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the BDO and the VDA is to be supported in every way\r\nby the Party offices. The National Socialist leadership of both\r\nassociations will ensure energetic cooperation on their part in all\r\ntasks assigned to them by the NSDAP. Their nature is determined by\r\nconsiderations of foreign policy, and the associations must bear this\r\nin mind when representing them in public.\r\n\r\n  Signed: R.

It turned out\r\nthat the nonadmission of members of the clergy into the Party is not\r\nsufficient for the purpose in question.\r\n\r\nIn his regulation No. 34/39 on the lifting of the restriction of\r\nmemberships dated 10 May 1939 the Reich Treasurer of the NSDAP has done\r\njustice to this experience by decreeing that clergymen, _as well as\r\nother fellow Germans who are also closely connected with the church_,\r\ncannot be admitted into the Party.\r\n\r\n_In addition to this I decree that in the future Party members who\r\nenter the clergy_ or who turn to the study of Theology have to\r\nleave the Party. This decree does not affect those students who are\r\nmatriculated mainly in other factors and, not intending to become\r\nclergymen later attend only some lectures of the theological faculties.\r\n\r\n  Signed: for\r\n  BORMANN\r\n\r\n  Attested:\r\n  [Signature illegible]\r\n  _Distribution_: IV b\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 841-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN LABOR PARTY\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer's Deputy Chief of the Staff\r\n  Brown House, MUNICH 33, the 17 Jan. 1939\r\n\r\n  ORDER NO 1/39 SECRET\r\n\r\n  Subject: _Jews_.\r\n\r\nUpon proposal of Field-Marshal Goering, the Fuehrer has made some basic\r\ndecisions concerning the Jewish problem.

Dec. 1938\r\n\r\nUpon my proposal, the Fuehrer made the following decisions concerning\r\nthe Jewish problem:\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n_I. Housing of Jews_\r\n\r\n1. _a._ The tenant protective law, as a rule, is not to be abrogated\r\nfor the Jews. On the contrary, it is desired, if possible, to proceed\r\nin particular cases in such a way that the Jews are quartered together\r\nin separate houses insofar as the housing conditions allow that.\r\n\r\n_b._ For this reason the aryanizing of the house ownership _is to be\r\npostponed until the end of the total aryanization_, that is to say, for\r\nthe present the aryanizing of houses has to be carried out only where\r\nin individual cases urgent reasons exist. The aryanizing of industries,\r\nbusinesses, agricultural estates, forests, etc., is to be considered as\r\nurgent.\r\n\r\n2. Use of sleeping and dining cars is to be forbidden to the Jews. At\r\nthe same time, no special Jewish compartments to be established. As\r\nwell, the use of trains, street cars, suburban railways, underground\r\nrailways, busses, and ships can not be prohibited to the Jews.\r\n\r\n3. Only the use of some public establishments, etc., is to be\r\nprohibited to the Jews. In this category belong the hotels and\r\nrestaurants visited especially by party-members (for instance: Hotel\r\nKaiserhof--Berlin; Hotel Vierjahreszeiten--Munich; Hotel Deutscher\r\nHof--Nurnberg; Hotel Drei Mohren--Augsburg, etc.). The use of bathing\r\nestablishments, some public places, bathing resorts, etc. can be\r\nprohibited to the Jews; also medicine baths, so far as they are\r\nprescribed in particular cases by physicians, may be used by Jews, but\r\nonly in such ways that no offense is created.\r\n\r\nII. Jews who were officials and have been pensioned are not to be\r\ndenied their pensions. Investigations though have to be made as to\r\nwhether these Jews can get along with a reduced allowance.\r\n\r\nIII. The Jewish welfare organizations are not to be aryanized or\r\nabolished so that the Jews do not become a public charge, but may be\r\nsupported by Jewish welfare organizations.\r\n\r\nIV. Jewish patents are property, and as such have to be aryanized. (A\r\nsimilar procedure toward Germany was carried out by U.S.A. and other\r\ncountries during World War I).\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\n_Mixed Marriages._\r\n\r\nI. 1. _With children_ (part Jews 1st class)\r\n\r\n_a._ If the father is a German and the mother a Jewess, this family\r\nmay stay in the future in its present lodging. The regulations for\r\nexclusion of Jews are not to be applied to such families as far as\r\ntheir housing is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the property of the Jewish mother can be transferred to\r\nthe German husband, or to the mixed children.\r\n\r\n_b._ If the father is a Jew and the mother a German, such families\r\nalso, are not to be moved for the present into Jewish quarters, because\r\nthe children (part Jews 1st class) in the future, must serve in the\r\nlabor service and the armed forces, and must not be exposed to Jewish\r\npropaganda. Concerning the property, one must for the present proceed\r\nin such a way that it can be completely or partly transferred to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n2. _Without children._\r\n\r\n_a._ If the husband is a German and wife a Jewess, the provisions of\r\n1_a_ are valid accordingly.\r\n\r\n_b._ If the husband is a Jew, and the wife a German, these childless\r\ncouples are to be proceeded against as if they were full-blooded Jews.\r\nThe husband's property can not be transferred to the wife. Both,\r\nhusband and wife can be moved into the Jewish houses or Jewish quarters.\r\n\r\nEspecially in case of emigration such married couples are to be treated\r\nas Jews, as soon as an increased emigration is gotten under way.\r\n\r\nII. If a German wife divorces a Jew, she reenters the German racial\r\ncommunity and all disadvantages for her discontinue.\r\n\r\n  Signed: GOERING\r\n\r\n  Certified copy\r\n  [Signature illegible]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 842-PS\r\n\r\n  THE KREISLEITER\r\n  To The Area Staff Leaders [Gaustabsamtsleiter]\r\n  Party member SELLMER, NURNBERG\r\n\r\n  LAUF (PEGNITZ), December 30, 1940\r\n\r\nIn addition to my last report on the situation, I report the following:\r\n\r\nThe district physician of Hersbruck, Dr. Loeffler, informs me that in\r\nSchupf near Kainsback (formerly Kreis Hersbruck) a young farmer, by\r\nthe name of Koch, was turned over to an institution for sterilization,\r\nbecause of epileptic attacks.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago he wrote to his mother that he was feeling fine, and\r\nthat she should send him some smoking tobacco. His mother wrote him\r\nin return that he should come back soon, as he is badly needed on the\r\nfarm. It is remarked here that the young Koch was of great help to the\r\nmother Koch, a farmer's widow, as he managed the farm practically all\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nA week later the widow was informed that her son had suddenly died, and\r\nthat she could obtain the urn containing the ashes.\r\n\r\nAs the young Koch had been known also in his neighborhood for his\r\nindustry, it is natural that this \"violent death\" has caused great\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nWhen I proposed to district physician Loeffler to send a master mason\r\nfrom Osternohe for a few weeks to the institution in Ausbach for\r\nobservation of his mental condition, he declared he could not take\r\nthis responsibility as he did not know if same would return alive. The\r\ndoctor informed me also that it was known that the commission consisted\r\nof an SS-physician with several subordinate physicians and that the\r\n\"patients\" were not even being examined, but judged solely by the\r\npatient's existing records. As far as he knew families refuse to send\r\ntheir sick members to the institutions as they do not know whether they\r\nwould see them again alive.\r\n\r\nThe district physician in Nurnberg had informed him of two cases in\r\nthe city of Nurnberg, where charges of murder have been preferred by\r\nrelations of such patients.\r\n\r\nThe Party has up to now received neither such complaints nor\r\naccusations.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Signed: Walz\r\n  Kreisleiter\r\n\r\n  _Pencil and ink notes_:\r\n\r\n \"investigate\"\r\n\r\n \"Dr. Guesbert\" [?]\r\n\r\n \"The staff reports: No case is known.

Participants about 2,500-3,000\r\n were brought in from outside by bus, etc. The Rottenburg populace\r\n again did not participate in the demonstration. This town took rather\r\n a hostile attitude to the demonstrations. The action got completely\r\n out of hand of the Party Member responsible for it. The demonstrators\r\n stormed the palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150 to 200\r\n people forced their way into the palace, searched the rooms, threw\r\n files out of the windows, and rummaged through the beds in the rooms\r\n of the palace. One bed was ignited. Before the fire got to the other\r\n objects of equipment in the rooms and the palace, the flaming bed\r\n could be thrown from the window and the fire extinguished. The Bishop\r\n was with Archbishop Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and gentleman\r\n of his menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30 people pressed\r\n into this chapel and molested those present. Bishop Groeber was taken\r\n for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed by the robe and dragged back and\r\n forth. Finally the intruders realized that Bishop Groeber is not\r\n the one they are seeking. They could then be persuaded to leave the\r\n building. After the evacuation of the palace by the demonstrators I\r\n had an interview with Archbishop Groeber who left Rottenburg in the\r\n night. Groeber wants to turn to the Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the\r\n Interior Dr. Frick anew.

The absence from the\r\nplebiscite has evoked great and justified anger among the population.\r\nApparently the bishop himself had a bad conscience and left town on\r\nthe evening before the plebiscite for an unknown destination. Even on\r\n10 and 11 April there were demonstrations at the bishop's residence\r\nin Rottenburg against the absent bishop. On 21 April Sproll returned\r\nto Rottenburg and on the same day there were renewed demonstrations\r\nin front of the bishop's palace. On 22 April Dr. Sproll again left\r\nRottenburg in order to go to a Bavarian monastery.\r\n\r\nAs the bishop, since Hitler's rise to power, became prominent through\r\na series of damaging sermons, the Governor of Wuerttemberg now came\r\nto the conclusion that Dr. Sproll, in the interest of preserving\r\nthe state's authority and in the interest of quiet and order, could\r\nno longer remain in office. The Reich Governor had explained to the\r\necclesiastical board,\r\n\r\n that he would no longer regard Bishop Sproll as Head of the Diocese\r\n of Rottenburg on account of his refraining from the election in the\r\n office;\r\n that he desired Bishop Sproll to leave the Gau area\r\n Wuerttemberg-Hohenzollern, because he could assume no guarantee for\r\n his personal safety; that in the case of the return of the bishop\r\n to Rottenburg he would see to it that all personal and official\r\n intercourse with him on the part of state offices as well as Party\r\n offices and the Armed Forces would be denied.\r\n\r\nMoved by the reports from Wuerttemberg my Deputy, in my absence,\r\ndirected the letter attached in copy G II 2277/38 2030 dated 5 May to\r\nthe Foreign Office. In accordance with that the Foreign Office on 18\r\nMay turned to the German Embassy at the Vatican with the instruction\r\nthat it should be urged on the Holy See to persuade Bishop Sproll that\r\nhe should resign his Bishopric.\r\n\r\nThe bishop sojourning outside of his diocese had already received the\r\ninstruction to return to his diocese. On 18 May Sproll quietly returned\r\nto Wuerttemberg and retired to St. Mary's Hospital in Stuttgart.\r\n\r\nSince no answer to the instruction of 18 May had been received from the\r\nEmbassy at the Holy See, on 1 July the settlement of the affair was\r\nagain brought up in Rome. On 18 July the letter of the Foreign Office\r\nattached in copy--Pol III 1886 of 11 July--was received. Whether the\r\naffair has again been discussed with the Cardinal Secretary of State,\r\nas planned, is unknown to me.\r\n\r\nIn the intervening two months Bishop Sproll quietly resided in\r\nStuttgart. On 15 July he returned to the Episcopal residence and on 16\r\nJuly conducted a ceremonial divine service. On the evening of the same\r\nday there occurred among the population, aroused over the return of\r\nthe bishop, great demonstrations before the ecclesiastical buildings\r\nof Rottenburg. On 18 July there were more even greater demonstrations.\r\nA report of the Reich Governor of 20 July is attached in copy. It is\r\nto be expected that on Saturday, 23 July, even greater mass meetings\r\nagainst continued remaining of the Bishop will be put on, so that\r\nCardinal Bertram was impelled to send his telegram of 21 July to the\r\nFuehrer and Reich Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe content and tenor of this telegram are such that I cannot recommend\r\na favorable consideration of it. Not the demonstrating people aroused\r\nover the subversive attitude of the Bishop are turning against the\r\nState, but the Bishop by his incredible behavior against the State and\r\nfolk-community has turned against the State. In my estimation measures\r\nare not sufficient here, which merely produce the condition prior to\r\n10 April. I could only recommend a cessation of further demonstrations\r\nif the action of the German Embassy initiated at the Holy See is\r\naccompanied by success. If it is unsuccessful, the Bishop would have to\r\nbe exiled from the land, or there would have to be a complete boycott\r\nof the Bishop by the authorities, as the Reich Governor in Wuerttemberg\r\nat that time announced to the ecclesiastical officials.\r\n\r\nI would notify Cardinal Bertram correspondingly, in case the Fuehrer\r\ndoes not reserve the notification for himself.\r\n\r\n  signed: KERRL\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Berlin W8, 5 May 1938\r\n  Reich and Prussian Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs\r\n  GII 2277/38\r\n\r\n  Subject: Catholic Bishop Sproll in Rottenburg, Wuerttemberg\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg (Wuerttemberg) on 10 April\r\n1938, as the only non-voter of the Rottenburg District, aroused\r\nthe greatest resentment of all racial Germans and especially gave\r\nto Catholic circles the worst example for their civic behavior. By\r\nhis absence from the plebiscite, which is to be evaluated only as a\r\ndemonstration, he moreover has violated the sense of the Episcopal oath\r\nof loyalty prescribed in Article 16 of the Reichconcordat.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop felt impelled to evade the just anger of the people and to\r\nleave his diocese. It is to be feared that upon his possible return\r\nand a possible appearance in public, even at church functions, renewed\r\ndisorders and demonstrations would occur. It cannot be expected of the\r\nGerman police that they would protect a man who has not perceived his\r\nmost primitive duties to people and Fuehrer, from the crowds of people\r\nwho, in righteous wrath, are turning against this man. Also, it cannot\r\nbe expected of the German authorities that they will carry on official\r\nbusiness with a Bishop who in this manner has excluded himself from\r\nthe folk-community. It is not to be expected that this Bishop can ever\r\naccomplish any more fruitful work in his diocese.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend that it be urged on the Holy See via the\r\nApostolic Nuncio or via the German Embassy at the Vatican, to influence\r\nBishop Sproll that he resign his Bishopric as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBy direction\r\n\r\n  Signed: DR.

The German Embassy reports, in addition,\r\nthat in spiritual circles the behavior of the Bishop is designated as\r\nvery inapt.\r\n\r\nThe German Embassy at the Holy See has been instructed to discuss the\r\nmatter again with the Cardinal-Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nFurther information is reserved for the present.\r\n\r\nBy direction\r\n\r\n  Signed: Bismarck\r\n\r\n To: _a._ Reich Governor in Wuerttemberg Gauleiter Murr, Stuttgart\r\n\r\n _b._ Chief of the Security Police Berlin SW 11, Prinz-Albrecht-Str. 8\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Reich Governor in Wuerttemberg\r\n  Stuttgart, 20 July 1938\r\n  Subject: Bishop Dr. Sproll\r\n  Enclosures: None\r\n\r\nAs I am informed, Monday evening a demonstration again occurred in\r\nfront of the Episcopal Ordinariat.

General K.H. Frank\r\nspoke about the following:\r\n\r\nSince creation of the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, party\r\nagencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the central\r\nauthorities of Berlin have had difficulties about the solution of the\r\nCzech problem.\r\n\r\nAfter ample deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed his view about\r\nthe various plans in a memorandum. In this, three ways of solution were\r\nindicated:\r\n\r\n_a._ German infiltration of Moravia and _reduction of the Czech\r\nnationality to a residual Bohemia_.\r\n\r\nThis solution is considered as unsatisfactory, because the Czech\r\nproblem, even if in a diminished form, will continue to exist.\r\n\r\n_b._ Many arguments can be brought up against the most radical\r\nsolution, namely the deportation of all the Czechs. Therefore the\r\nmemorandum comes to the conclusion that it cannot be carried out within\r\na reasonable space of time.\r\n\r\n_c._ _Assimilation of the Czechs_, i.e. absorption of about half of\r\nthe Czech nationality by the Germans, insofar as this is of importance\r\nby being valuable from a racial or other standpoint [blut-und sonst\r\nwertmaessig Bedentunghat]. This will take place among other things,\r\nalso by increasing the Arbeitseinsatz of the Czechs in the Reich\r\nterritory (with the exception of the Sudeten German border district),\r\nin other words by dispersing the closed Czech nationality.\r\n\r\nThe other half of the Czech nationality must be deprived of its power,\r\neliminated, and shipped out of the country by all sorts of methods.\r\nThis applies particularly to the racially mongoloid part and to the\r\nmajor part of the intellectual class. The latter can scarcely be\r\nconverted ideologically and would represent a burden by constantly\r\nmaking claims for the leadership over the other Czech classes and thus\r\ninterfering with a rapid assimilation.\r\n\r\nElements which counteract the planned Germanization are to be handled\r\nroughly and should be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe above development naturally presupposes an increased influx of\r\nGermans from the Reich territory into the Protectorate.\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion, the Fuehrer has chosen solution c (assimilation)\r\nas a directive for the solution of the Czech problem and decided that,\r\nwhile keeping up the autonomy of the Protectorate on the surface, the\r\nGermanization will have to be carried out in a centralized way by the\r\noffice of the Reich Protectorate for years to come.\r\n\r\nFrom the above no particular conclusions are drawn by the armed forces.\r\nThis is the direction which has always been represented from here. In\r\nthis connection, I refer to my memorandum which was sent to the Chief\r\nof the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, dated 12 July 1939, file\r\nnumber 6/39, top secret, entitled: \"The Czech Problem.\" (Attached as\r\nannex).\r\n\r\nThe Deputy General of the Armed Forces with the Reich Protector in\r\nBohemia and Moravia.\r\n\r\n  Signed: FRIDERICI\r\n  Infantry Lt.

The Armed Forces will welcome it if they can dispose of\r\nadministrative questions in Poland.\r\n\r\nOn principle there cannot be 2 administrations.\r\n\r\n2. Poland is to be made independent. She will neither be part of the\r\nGerman Reich nor a district administered by the Reich.\r\n\r\n3. It is not the task of the Administration to make Poland into a\r\nmodel province or a model state of the German order or to put her\r\neconomically or financially on a sound basis.\r\n\r\nThe Polish intelligensia must be prevented from forming a ruling\r\nclass. The standard of living in the country is to remain low; we only\r\nwant to draw labor forces from there. Poles are also to be used for\r\nthe administration of the country. However, the forming of national\r\npolitical groups may not be allowed.\r\n\r\n4. The administration has to work on its own responsibility and must\r\nnot be dependent on Berlin. We don't want to do there what we do in\r\nthe Reich. The responsibility does not rest with the Berlin Ministries\r\nsince there is no German administrative unit concerned.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of this task will involve a hard racial struggle\r\n[Volkstumskampf] which will not allow any legal restrictions. The\r\nmethods will be incompatible with the principles otherwise adhered to\r\nby us.\r\n\r\nThe Governor General is to give the Polish nation only bare living\r\nconditions and is to maintain the basis for military security.\r\n\r\n5. In Cracow German officers have visited the Bishops. Prince Radziwill\r\nis owner of his huge estates [Latifundien].\r\n\r\nThese problems cannot be solved socially.\r\n\r\n6. _Our interests lie as follows_: Precautions are to be taken that\r\nthe territory is important to us from a military point of view\r\nas an advanced jumping-off point and can be used for strategic\r\nconcentration of troops. To that end the _railroads_, _roads_, and the\r\n_communications channels_ are to be kept in order and utilized for our\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAny tendencies towards the consolidation of conditions in Poland are\r\nto be suppressed. The \"Polish muddle\" [polnische Wirtschaft] must\r\nbe allowed to develop. The government of the territory must make it\r\npossible for us to purify the _Reich territory_ from Jews and Polacks,\r\ntoo. Collaboration with new Reich provinces [Posen and West Prussia]\r\nonly for _resettlements_ (Compare Mission Himmler).\r\n\r\n_Purpose_: Shrewdness and severity must be the maxims in this racial\r\nstruggle in order to spare us from going to battle on account of this\r\ncountry again.\r\n\r\n  [illegible initials] 20 Oct.\r\n  W.\r\n  [initialed by General Warlimont]\r\n  20 Oct.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 865-PS\r\n\r\nI name Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as my Commissioner for the central\r\ncontrol of questions connected with the East-European Region.\r\n\r\nAn office, which is to be established in accordance with his orders, is\r\nat the disposal of Reichsleiter Rosenberg for the carrying out of the\r\nduties thereby entrusted to him.\r\n\r\nThe necessary money for this office is to be taken out of the Reich\r\nChancellery Treasury in a lump sum.\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer's Headquarters 20th April 1941.\r\n  The Fuehrer\r\n  Signed: Adolf Hitler\r\n  Reich Minister and Head of Reich Chancellery\r\n  Signed: Dr. Lammers\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  The Reich Minister and the Head of the Reich Chancellery\r\n  Vossstrasse 6, Berlin W8, 21st April 1941\r\n  At present Fuehrer Headquarters.\r\n  Mail, without exception, to be sent to the Berlin address.\r\n\r\n To: the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, General\r\n Field Marshal Keitel\r\n\r\n  Personal.

The personnel of both dockyards had the reputation of being\r\nextremely radical marxistic before the war. Both dockyards strikes were\r\ndeclared in September 1941. At the second day of the strike I have\r\ntaken measures so harsh and decisive that starting there and then, and\r\nuntil this plot happened, peace and order prevailed at both enterprises.\r\n\r\n2. In connection with the withdrawal of the 20th (mountain) Army,\r\nEngland has given out the following order to the personnel of the\r\ndockyards: \"Either you blow up the ships or we shall be forced to shell\r\ntown and port.\" The efficiency of that order of the day is confirmed\r\nnot only by the plot itself but also by statements. Therefore it is\r\nclear that the saboteurs do not only have active helpers or groups\r\nof helpers amongst the personnel, but that they also enjoy passive\r\nsupport respectively protection by the rest of the crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Countermeasures._\r\n\r\n1. My old method is entirely out of question. Countersabotage in Norway\r\nis useless on account of lack of objects. Counter terror in this\r\ninstance would bypass its goal and in addition would lead to the most\r\ndisadvantageous consequences, according to the opinion, shared by Reich\r\nLeader of SS Himmler and chief of the Security Police Kaltenbrunner.\r\n\r\n2. A permanent and sufficient boarding of the ships by military guards\r\nmust fail because, on account of lack of forces. Navy and army state\r\nthat they cannot furnish additional units. Guarding by police is\r\nimpossible, because only six under strength battalions of about 400 men\r\nare at my disposal in the entire country. [Pencilled note of Keitel:\r\nNo, the Armed Forces can guard its ships itself?]\r\n\r\n3. As much as a stronger and permanent military guarding of every ship\r\nis desirable, this measure would in no way exclude the possibility\r\nof further attacks, because such guards are not able to judge if the\r\nNorwegian specialists handle their jobs right or wrong. [Pencilled note\r\nof Keitel: But the Marines can do that.]\r\n\r\n4. Just now I received a cable of Field Marshall General Keitel, in\r\nwhich the issue of a decree is demanded according to which members of\r\nthe personnel and if the occasions arises their next of kin (liability\r\nof next of kin) are collectively kept responsible for cases of sabotage\r\noccurring in their departments.\r\n\r\nThis demand makes only sense and promises success only, if I am\r\nactually allowed to perform executions by firing squad. [Pencilled note\r\nof Keitel: Yes, that is the best.] If this is not possible, such a\r\ndecree would cause exactly the opposite reaction.\r\n\r\n_a._ The Norwegian expects German defeat within a very short time. An\r\narrest therefore, does not only frighten him, but gives him security\r\non the one hand, and on the other hand an alibi with the Emigrant\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n_b._ This decree would only add fuel to the fire of the Swedish\r\nagitators and would not be crowned by success. But such shootings by\r\nfiring squads are prohibited by the Fuehrer decree. On the other hand,\r\nif I could get renewal liberty of action in this regard, and if I could\r\nuse my old methods again, without considering Sweden, then such a\r\ndecree would gain the necessary weight and, with that doubtlessly lead\r\nto success.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Suggestion._\r\n\r\n1. A military guard is ordered for every ship. The main dockyard\r\ncommittee has to submit specific suggestions regarding the respective\r\nstrength and the methods of duty patroling.\r\n\r\n2. So many workers, foremen, technicians, and engineers are to be taken\r\nfrom German dockyards that we are able to plant amongst personnel of\r\nthe most important Norwegian dockyards at least 10 percent of German\r\nspecialists. The dockyard main committee can also order the method of\r\nplanting only if, on account of this--at the worst--the production\r\ncapacity German dockyards decrease accordingly, one should consider\r\nthat by such measures the tenfold of this waste will be secured on\r\nthe Norwegian side, [Pencilled note of Keitel: I regard this measure\r\nas expedient, if decrees 3 and 4 should be declined. K.] For, only by\r\nemploying these Norwegian Specialists forces it will be possible to\r\nkeep the Norwegian experts under such constant control at their work,\r\nthat it is made quite impossible for them to commit acts of sabotage.\r\n\r\n3. Establishing of the three-shift system, in order that at any day or\r\nnight time Norwegian personnel is on board and, in case, is also blown\r\ninto the air. It is up to the dockyard main committee to decide if and\r\nto which extent this system is workable.\r\n\r\n4. In this connection the dockyard main committee should be charged\r\nin principle with the central responsibility for the security in the\r\ndockyards: for the main committee in its competence has at its disposal\r\nthe decisive prerogatives, which can warrant that security. Thereby it\r\ngoes without saying, that it has at its disposal the Security Police\r\nwith all its facilities and that the Armed Forces put at the disposal\r\nof the guards to the ordered extent.\r\n\r\n5. While accomplishing these measures one has to take into account the\r\npossibility of a strike. As I possess only limited liberty of action,\r\nat present this would be more than unpleasant. In spite of this I am\r\nof the opinion that taking the danger into the bargain, the measures\r\nsuggested should be ordered.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Terboven\r\n  Reich Commissioner\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 871-PS\r\n\r\n  Top Secret\r\n\r\n  WFSt/Qu.2 (North)      6 December 1944\r\n  2 copies, 1st copy\r\n\r\n KR--Teletype to Reichminister and Head of Reich Chancellery,\r\n Reichminister Dr. Lammers.\r\n\r\n  Sir:\r\n\r\nIn the matter of checking sabotage in Norway, I agree with the view of\r\nthe Reich Commissioner for Occupied Norwegian territory, to the extent\r\nthat I expect results from reprisals only if they are carried out\r\nruthlessly and if Reich Commissioner Terboven is authorized to carry\r\nout shootings.\r\n\r\nShould the Fuehrer not grant this authorization, I consider the\r\nproposal of Reich Commissioner Terboven (No. III of his communication)\r\nas adequate to the purpose.\r\n\r\nI note moreover that the mentioned 10% of German specialists\r\n[Fachraefte] would require from 800-1,000 persons. For guard duty it\r\nis possible to supply supplementary personnel from the Wehrmacht, to a\r\nlimited extent.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the view of Reich Commissioner Terboven, I anticipate a\r\ncertain success from this procedure at least to the extent that Marines\r\nwill be used.\r\n\r\nFor your information, there is going forward to you simultaneously\r\na teletype addressed to the Wehrmacht Commandant (W.

The only one, that is, according to Gen. Koestring.\r\n\r\nDetails of the strength and organization of the Russian divisions\r\nare _important only_ in that even the Infantry Divisions include a\r\ncomparatively large number of tanks, though the material is bad and\r\nmerely thrown together.\r\n\r\nIn the case of mechanized divisions, we have superiority with regard to\r\ntanks, weapons [Schuetzen] and artillery. The Russians are superior in\r\nnumbers, we in quality.\r\n\r\nThe Russians are normally equipped in artillery. Materials likewise\r\ninferior. The Command of the Artillery is insufficient. The Russian\r\noperational intentions are unknown. Strong forces are at the frontier.\r\nAny retreat could be only on a small scale since the Baltic States and\r\nUkraine are vital to the Russians for supply reasons. Fortification\r\nwork is in progress especially on the North and Southern flanks.\r\n\r\nThere is no fresh information on the communications system.\r\n\r\nDirectives to Army Groups so given that the Russian front will be\r\nsplit into 2 sections and a Russian retreat on the Dnjeper-Duena Line\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe Army Group North and Center ordered to press forward across the\r\nDuena in a north-easterly direction with concentrated armored forces in\r\n3 armored groups (the strongest in the South).\r\n\r\nThe most northerly group is to press on up to the region of Lake\r\nPeipus, then advance further to the East in cooperation with other two\r\narmored groups, who will be attacking Smolensk.\r\n\r\nThe Army Group South is to advance across the Dnieper in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction. Army Group North and Center is to carry out\r\noperations North of the Pripet Marshes. Army Group South will be to the\r\nSouth, that is, separate and independent. The main sector lies in the\r\nNorth; army reserves are massed there.\r\n\r\n6 armored divisions are required from the \"Marita\" operation; of\r\nthese the 2 training divisions are for the 1st line, a further 2 from\r\nRoumania itself for the Southern Group, the last 2 divisions are\r\nreserves for the Northern Group. It all depends on the Balkan situation\r\n(Turkey's attitude).\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--When the die has been cast, the Turks will not make any\r\n further moves. No special protection of the Balkans is therefore\r\n necessary. One dangerous moment will be if North Africa is cleared\r\n by the British, thus enabling the British to operate in Syria with\r\n unhampered forces.\r\n\r\n  _Chief of Army General Staff_--_Northern Group_ 50}\r\n  divs, 13 armored divs, 9 motorized divs. Southern         } Attack Forces\r\n  Group 30 divs, 5 armored divs, 3 motorized divs.          }\r\n\r\n  In addition: Supreme Command of the Army Reserves.\r\n\r\nAssignment of Pioneers is not entirely satisfactory. This is made good\r\nby additional bridge-building units [Brueckenmaterial].\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--agreed with the large dispositions.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Army General Staff_--It is proposed to isolate a large\r\n number of Russian troops in various places at the time the split is\r\n effected. The early use of reserves is necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Note_: the Pripet Marshes are not definitely _taboo_.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--mentioned the Russians tactics of flank attacks.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Army General Staff_--The cavalry divisions are particularly\r\n dangerous in this respect.\r\n\r\n  _Orders issued to date_:\r\n  Orders for Army Group are binding.\r\n  Orders for Armies set out the targets.\r\n  Orders for Units leave possibility for changes.\r\n\r\nHe expounded on _the orders issued to Army groups, etc., up to the\r\npresent_.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--mentioned that the operational areas were enormous,\r\n that the enemy troops could be successfully encircled, only if the\r\n encirclement were _complete_ (Cavalry divisions). (At the moment,\r\n there is a very biased play on in Moscow about Suwarow). The immediate\r\n surrender of the Baltic States, including Leningrad and the Ukraine,\r\n cannot be expected at once. It is, however, possible that after the\r\n initial defeat, the Russians, knowing our operational aims, will\r\n retreat on large scale and prepare for defense further East behind\r\n some barrier.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the North, regardless of the Russians in the East, will\r\nbe cleared. From there (a favorable supply-base) a thrust in the rear\r\nof the Russians without a frontal attack. It is essential to wipe out\r\nlarge sections of the enemy and not to put them to flight. This will\r\nbe accomplished if we occupy the flanking areas with the strongest\r\npossible forces. Then, with the enemy held in the center, he can be\r\nmaneuvered out of it from the flanks.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Army General Staff_--The Falkenhorst army can advance on\r\n Petsamo with 1-1/2 divisions, by using Swedish railways, with a\r\n further 1-1/2 divisions (including 1 SS Brigade). The aim is the\r\n protection of the Finnish northern industrial area, trapping and\r\n cutting off the Murmansk forces.\r\n\r\nThe Finns will probably make a strategic concentration in the South\r\nwith 4 Army Corps [Aks] of which an attacking group of 5 divisions will\r\nadvance in the direction of Leningrad, with 3 divisions against Lake\r\nOnegin, 2 divisions against Hango, they need strong support. There are\r\n15 Russian divisions on the Finnish front, approximately 1 division in\r\nMurmansk.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--assumed that Sweden would join with us at a price. The\r\n price: the Aaland Islands (not our possessions). There is no question\r\n of a union between Finland and Sweden as this would not suit the\r\n European New Order.\r\n\r\nNorway must be under protection; no repercussions are desired from that\r\nquarter. Artillery reinforcements are required.\r\n\r\n_In the South_: The most important task is the protection of the oil\r\nfields, therefore speedy action from Roumania is necessary.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Army General Staff_--Position of Hungary. If Hungary is\r\n not to participate, we must withdraw from Hungary. The destination\r\n of the march will be given as Roumania. At the last minute the\r\n direction will change towards the Russian frontier. Hungary will\r\n permit anything so long as she is given the corresponding political\r\n assurances. Agreements with all states taking part (with the exception\r\n of Roumania) can be made only at the eleventh hour. With Roumania it\r\n is a matter of life and death.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Army General Staff_--Armored reconnaissance forces are still\r\n scarce.\r\n\r\n_Flak question_ is still unsettled, it depends on the conditions of the\r\nroads (to follow in writing).\r\n\r\nThe Air Force commands 30 Flak battalions, in addition 30 batteries set\r\nup by the Army.\r\n\r\n_The Navy_ must hasten the opening of supply routes to the Baltic.\r\n\r\n_Supply_ is a road transport problem as the gauge has to be changed on\r\nthe railroads here. A system of long-distance trucks, which can bring\r\nsupplies to supply bases.\r\n\r\nAgreement with the Air Force that all transport is to be used to the\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nSupply areas, shifted to the region of East Poland, are at present\r\nbeing developed. (Possibilities in Roumania are still being explored).\r\n\r\n_In connection with Marita_, the difficulties of transporting back\r\nthose forces urgently needed for Barbarossa were stressed.\r\n\r\n_The intended time period_ was discussed with a plan. 1st Deployment\r\nStaffel [Aufmarschstaffel] transfer now, Front-Germany-East. 2nd\r\nDeployment Staffel [Aufmarschstaffel] from the middle of March will\r\ngive up 3 divisions for reinforcement in the West. Army groups and Army\r\nHigh Commands are being withdrawn from the West. There are already\r\nconsiderable reinforcements though still in the rear area. From now on,\r\nAttila can be carried out only under difficulties. Industrial traffic\r\nis hampered by transport movements. From the middle of April, Hungary\r\nwill be approached about the march through. 3 deployment staffels from\r\nthe middle of April. Felix is now no longer possible as the main part\r\nof the artillery is being entrained.\r\n\r\n_In industry_ the full capacity time table is in force. No more\r\ncamouflage.\r\n\r\nFrom 25.IV-15.V, 4 staffels to withdraw considerable forces from\r\nthe West. (Seeloewe can no longer be carried out). The strategic\r\nconcentration in the East is quite recognizable.\r\n\r\nThe full capacity time table remains. 8 Marita divisions complete the\r\npicture of the disposition of forces on the plan.\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--requested that he no longer have to employ 5 control\r\n divisions for this, but might hold them ready as reserves for\r\n commanders in the West.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--When Barbarossa commences, the world will hold its breath\r\n and make no comment.\r\n\r\n _Chief of the Air Force General Staff_--joined the conferences.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--discussed the Italian situation in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nHe stated that the loss of North Africa could be withstood in the\r\nmilitary sense but must have a strong psychological effect on Italy.\r\n\r\nBritain can hold a pistol to Italy's head and force her either to make\r\npeace and retain everything or after the loss of North Africa to be\r\nbombarded. This would be to our disadvantage. British forces in the\r\nMediterranean area will not be tied down. We ourselves have a weak base\r\nthere through Southern France. The British have the free use of a dozen\r\ndivisions and can employ them most dangerously, i.e. in Syria.\r\n\r\nWe must make every effort to prevent this. Italy must be given support.\r\n\r\nWe are already doing this in Marita. We must, however, attempt to\r\nrender effective assistance in North Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Italians are of the opinion that they can put up a defense now\r\nonly at Tripoli. This is not feasible. The Air Force cannot operate\r\nthere. Therefore the position cannot be held. There must be some larger\r\nprotection zone. Our blocking units can also be effective only in\r\nlarger protection zones.\r\n\r\nHe discussed the connection between successes, even defensive successes\r\nthere and Balkan events, possibly a peaceful settlement in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n _What can be done?_\r\n\r\nLand units will arrive late even if not too late. Graziani must receive\r\nsome kind of support. Therefore the Air Force must be employed, if\r\npossible with Stuka groups, with jumping-off bases and homefields in\r\nLybia.\r\n\r\nIf this can bring the British advance to a standstill, the intended\r\nblocking unit is still insufficient and must be reinforced by a mobile\r\nunit (strong armored division).\r\n\r\nThe British personnel and material must have been exhausted during\r\nthe advance. If the British encounter fresh and well-equipped German\r\nforces, the situation will soon alter.\r\n\r\nQuery from C-in-C Army. Can we spare an armored division for this?\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--unwillingly from Marita.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--out of the question.\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--If it comes to that, Barbarossa is also in need.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--\r\n\r\nIf we send help to North Africa, we must do so at once before the\r\nItalians. (We have made the offer to the Italians).\r\n\r\nThe primary consideration is: Can the Air Force intervene now.\r\n\r\nThe time required for the transport of Air Force supplies, blocking\r\nunit, and armored divisions must be established at once.\r\n\r\nThen, what are the climatic conditions?\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--It is important that British supplies by land and sea\r\n are stopped. This can be done only by the German Air Force.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--The Italians must be asked how long they can allow for the\r\n transport of the above-mentioned German troops.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, transport groups must be employed.\r\n\r\nProposal: General Jeschonek III/KG for special duties, from\r\n\r\n\r\nFoggia.\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--proposed that the blocking unit should first be\r\n reinforced by 1 armored regiment. The rest to follow. The Fuehrer\r\n agreed.\r\n\r\n _Chief of Air Force General Staff_--spoke of the position of the\r\n ground-organization in North Africa. Only in Benghazi are Stuka-Forces\r\n ready within range for operations.\r\n\r\nFighter forces will naturally be sent there also, or Italian fighters\r\nbe placed under German orders.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that the air base of Malta be subdued.\r\n\r\n _Fuehrer_--agreed. The Italians are to withdraw Italian fighters from\r\n the Channel coast. (He will speak to the Duce.)\r\n\r\n_The Air Force_ must test immediately, the possibilities of intervening\r\nin North Africa. The Army is to see to the transport for the blocking\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nThe transport must be speeded up. Reinforcement by an armored regiment,\r\nfurther reinforcement up to an armored division, will be withdrawn from\r\nMarita. Flak forces on ahead.\r\n\r\n _C-in-C Army_--proposed a united command of all mobile forces under\r\n 1st General Headquarters. Cooperation with the Air Force which also\r\n commands the Italian naval air forces.\r\n\r\n _Conclusions_:\r\n\r\n1. _Barbarossa._\r\n\r\n_a._ The Fuehrer on the whole was in agreement with the operational\r\nplan. When it is being carried out, it must be remembered that the\r\n_main aim_ is to gain possession of the Baltic States and Leningrad.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Fuehrer desires that the operation map and the plan of the\r\ndisposition of forces be sent to him as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n_c._ Agreements with neighboring states, who are taking part, may not\r\nbe concluded until there is no longer any necessity for camouflage. The\r\nexception is Roumania with regard to the reinforcing of the Moldau.\r\n\r\n_d._ It must, at all costs, be possible to carry out Attila (auxiliary\r\nmeasure).\r\n\r\n_e._ The strategic concentration for Barbarossa will be camouflaged as\r\na feint for Seeloewe and the subsidiary measure Marita.\r\n\r\n2. _Sonnenblume._\r\n\r\n_a._ The Air Force must intervene as soon as possible with Stuka\r\nand Fighter forces. Bases and jumping-off bases in accordance with\r\ndecisions made in North Africa. It is desired that the Italian fighter\r\nforces be placed under German orders.\r\n\r\n_b._ The 10th Flieger Korps is to take over the task of protecting the\r\ntransports to East Africa, in the closest cooperation with the Italian\r\nAir Force and Naval Commander in Catania.\r\n\r\n_c._ The 10th Flieger Korps is to strike a strong blow against the\r\nBritish troops in Cyrenaica as soon as possible (with the use of the\r\nheaviest bombs).\r\n\r\nThe main task is to disrupt British supplies by land and sea; next, to\r\ncombat the British fleet.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, attempts must be made to subdue the air base of Malta.\r\n\r\n_d._ The _Army_ is to continue the transport of the blocking unit. This\r\nis, however, to be reinforced at once with armor. Preparations for\r\nadding one Armored Division (II Staffel from Marita). Flank forces on\r\nahead. 1st General Headquarters to be established immediately.

These rules aim essentially at continuing preparations for\r\nthe attack against England in an increasing degree. Simultaneously the\r\nactual preparations for deployment in the East should be represented as\r\na diversionary maneuver to divert from plans which are being pursued\r\nfor an attack against England. In order to insure success for these\r\nmeasures, it is indispensable that these same principles are being also\r\nfollowed on the part of the organization Todt.\r\n\r\n  [initials]     K.

No. 44277/41 most secret, S.O. only, dated 12,3,41\r\n\r\n1. The second phase of the deception of the enemy commences with the\r\nintroduction on 22.5. of the full capacity timetable. The efforts\r\nof the Supreme Commands and of any other authorities concerned must\r\nbe aimed, more and more, at making the strategic concentration\r\n\"Barbarossa\" appear as a large-scale maneuver and also to continue\r\nthe preparations for the attack on England with special energy. The\r\nfollowing is the principle to be applied: the nearer the day of attack\r\napproaches, the more intensive methods can be employed (also in the\r\ncommunications service) for deception purposes.\r\n\r\n2. All efforts will be in vain if our own units are aware of the\r\napproaching attack and spread news of it at home. On the contrary, the\r\nrumor of the \"rear cover against Russia\" and of the \"feint assembly\r\nof forces in the East\" must be circulated, and/or the troops on the\r\nChannel coast must believe in actual preparations. In this connection,\r\ndead-lines and the extent of army postal restrictions are important.\r\nThey are to be regulated for the whole Armed Forces by the Supreme\r\nCommand of the Army (in cooperation with the other branches of the\r\nArmed Forces and Ausl./Abw). It will be advantageous to issue orders\r\nfor transport to the West to as many Eastern units as possible and\r\nthereby to give rise to a new wave of rumors.\r\n\r\n3. If the occasion arise, Operation _Merkur_ is to be utilized in the\r\ncommunications service by the preparation of the slogan: \"Crete was the\r\ngeneral try-out for the landing in Britain!\"\r\n\r\n4. OKW (WFSt/Section L) will shortly increase the deception by\r\nhaving several ministries concerned with preparations for Britain.\r\nThis is to be utilized by Ausl./Abw. in the communications service\r\n(counterespionage).\r\n\r\n5. _Political steps_ for the deception of Soviet Russia have been taken\r\nand are further being considered.\r\n\r\n  Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  [signed] KEITEL.\r\n  Certified a true copy\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  Captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 878-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET [Stamp]\r\n\r\n  Draft Copy\r\n\r\n  Fuehrer Headquarters, the 12th Sept. 1941.\r\n\r\n  Armed Forces High Command\r\n  Armed Forces Operational Staff/Dept L (_IV/Gu_)\r\n  Nr. 02041/41 geh.\r\n  _Reference_: Jews in the newly occupied Eastern territories.\r\n\r\nIsolated incidents render it necessary to refer to the directives\r\nissued for the conduct of troops in the USSR (Armed Forces High\r\nCommand/Armed Forces Operational Staff/Dept L (IV/Gu) Nr. 44560/41, top\r\nSecret of 19 March 1941).\r\n\r\nThe fight against Bolshevism necessitates indiscriminate and energetic\r\naccomplishment of this task, especially also against the Jews, the main\r\ncarriers of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons, any cooperation of the Armed Forces with the Jewish\r\npopulation, who are openly or secretly anti-German in their attitude,\r\nas well as the use of single Jew in any preferred auxiliary position,\r\nwill have to cease.

Punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians do not, until\r\nfurther notice, come any more under the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourts-martial and the summary courts-martial.\r\n\r\n2. Guerillas are to be killed ruthlessly by the troops in battle or\r\nduring pursuit.\r\n\r\n3. Also all other attacks of enemy civilians against the Wehrmacht,\r\nits members and employees are to be fought by the troops at the place\r\nof the attack with the most extreme means until annihilation of the\r\nattacker.\r\n\r\n4. In cases where measures of this kind were neglected or not\r\nimmediately possible, elements suspected of offense will be brought at\r\nonce before an officer. He decides whether they are to be shot.\r\n\r\nAgainst villages from which the Wehrmacht was insidiously and\r\nmaliciously attacked, collective punitive measures by force will be\r\ncarried out immediately under command of an officer with the rank of\r\nat least a battalion commander, if the circumstances do not permit an\r\nimmediate identification of individual perpetrators.\r\n\r\n5. It is expressly prohibited to hold suspected perpetrators in order\r\nto transfer them to the courts upon reinstitution of their jurisdiction\r\nover civilians.\r\n\r\n6. The commanders in chief of the army groups can, in conjunction\r\nwith the competent commanders of the air force and the navy, restore\r\nthe Wehrmacht jurisdiction over civilians in districts which are\r\nsufficiently pacified.\r\n\r\nFor the area of the political administration this decree is issued\r\nthrough the chief of the high command of the Wehrmacht [marginal ink\r\ncorrection inked out: C-n-C of army in agreement with C-i-C of other\r\nbranches.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_Treatment of punishable offenses of members of the Wehrmacht and its\r\nemployees against the native population_\r\n\r\n1. For offenses committed by members of the Wehrmacht and its employees\r\nagainst enemy civilians, prosecution is not compulsory, not even if the\r\noffense is at the same time a military crime or violation.\r\n\r\n2. While judging offenses of this kind, it should be considered in\r\nevery case, that the break-down in 1918, the time of suffering of the\r\nGerman people after that, and the numerous blood sacrifices of the\r\nmovement in the battle against national socialism were decidedly due to\r\nthe Bolshevist influence, and that no German has forgotten this.\r\n\r\n3. The judge examines therefore whether in such cases disciplinary\r\naction is justified or whether it is necessary to take legal steps.\r\nThe judge orders the prosecution of offenses against civilians through\r\ncourt-martial only if it is considered necessary for the maintenance of\r\ndiscipline or the security of the troops. This applies, for instance,\r\nto cases of serious offenses which are based on sexual acts without\r\nrestraint, which derive from a criminal tendency, or which are a\r\nsign that the troop threatens to mutiny. The punishable offenses of\r\ndestroying senselessly quarters as well as supplies or other captured\r\ngoods to the disadvantage of the own troop should, as a rule, be judged\r\nas more leniently.\r\n\r\nThe order of the inquiry proceedings requires in every individual case\r\nthe signature of the judge.\r\n\r\nExtreme care must be exercised when judging the authenticity of the\r\nstatements of enemy civilians.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_Responsibility of the troop commanders_\r\n\r\nThe troop commanders are, within the sphere of their competence,\r\n_personally_ responsible for the following:\r\n\r\n1. that all officers of the units subordinated to them are very\r\nthoroughly and promptly instructed about the fundamentals of I,\r\n\r\n2. that their legal advisors be _promptly_ informed about these\r\ninstructions and _about the verbal statements with which the\r\npolitical intentions of the leadership had been explained to the\r\ncommanders-in-chief_,\r\n\r\n3. that only such sentences will be confirmed which are in accord with\r\nthe political intentions of the leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_Protection of secret_\r\n\r\nAfter end of camouflage the decree is to be considered only as secret.\r\n\r\n  For the chief of the high command of the Wehrmacht--\r\n  Signed: KEITEL\r\n\r\n Note [in pencil]: This should, if possible, not be passed on before 1\r\n June 41.\r\n\r\n  Certified\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 910-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Government of the Governor General\r\n  Chief Department\r\n  Administration of the Interior\r\n\r\n1. During his presence, the Reichsfuehrer SS explained his plans for\r\nthe transplantation of the population of the East to the Governor\r\nGeneral in my presence. He declared that he was very anxious\r\n\r\na. that the historic German town center of Lublin should be completely\r\nrenovated as soon as possible and be placed at the disposal of the\r\nGerman functionaries.\r\n\r\nb. that the same should be done to the market-place of Zamose. Here\r\ntoo, the residential buildings should be put into a state appropriate\r\nfor the reception of German families and be placed at the disposal of\r\nGerman functionaries and other German families present.\r\n\r\nc. soon German peasant families from Transnistria should be settled\r\nin Zamose County. In order not to alarm the domestic population,\r\nparticularly the peasant population, and hereby to impair the result\r\nof the harvest, those German peasant families should be placed only\r\non the country estates and the big holdings. Insofar as peasants from\r\nTransnistria do not come into consideration, the transplanting of small\r\nbut suitable landowners from the German parts near Petrikan (Pietrikow)\r\ninto Zamose County should also be considered. As in that county already\r\nsome villages exist the inhabitants of which are doubtlessly of German\r\norigin, that way a German bulwark could be created in Zamose County.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible in some way these three measures Lublin, Zamose rural\r\narea and Zamose town district should be achieved even this year.\r\n\r\n  Cracow, 3.27.1942\r\n  Dr. S.H.\r\n  218,005\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Government of the Governor General\r\n  Chief Department:\r\n  Administration of the Interior\r\n\r\n  CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\n1. The Reichsfuehrer-SS spoke at the time of his presence on March 13\r\nand 14 in Cracow in detail about the plans of settlement for the next\r\nfew years and about the planned Germanization. Among other things, he\r\ntook the view the Gorales, Lemkes and Hutzules whose Germanic origin,\r\nor at least Germanic mixture is indubitable, in his opinion should\r\nbe Germanized in the course of time. To this purpose he recommended\r\nto begin in the schools of the territory in question by establishing\r\nthe number of blond and blue-eyed pupils in proportion to the total\r\nnumber of pupils. Then, one should begin to grant them gradually more\r\nfavorable living conditions, however on the condition that they have\r\ntheir children learn the German language and get acquainted with the\r\nGerman cultural values. Eventually, one can settle still other Germans\r\nin the territory of these three peoples later on.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is thought that sometime the Germans from\r\nZips in Slovakia should move over into the Government General. The\r\nReichsfuehrer-SS developed further trains of ideas to the effect that\r\nin the first five-year plan for resettlement after the war, the new\r\nGerman Eastern territories should first be filled; afterwards it is\r\nintended to provide at this time the Crimea and the Baltic countries\r\nwith a German upperclass at least. Into the Government General,\r\nperhaps further German island settlement should be newly transplanted\r\nfrom European nations. An exact decision in this regard, however,\r\nhas not been issued. In any case it is wished that at first a heavy\r\ncolonization along the San and the Brig be achieved so that the parts\r\nof Poland are encircled with alien populations. Hitherto, it has been\r\nalways proved that this kind of encirclement leads most quickly to the\r\ndesired nationalization.\r\n\r\n  Cracow, March 30, 1942\r\n  Dr. S/H\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 957-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  24. 2. 1940\r\n  Reich-Minister von Ribbentrop,\r\n  Berlin.\r\n  Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n  Dear Party Comrade von Ribbentrop,\r\n\r\nParty Comrade Scheidt has returned and has made a detailed report\r\nto Privy Councillor von Grundherr who will address you on this\r\nsubject.

Report about the situation and developments in the\r\n  occupied territories of the Netherlands\r\n\r\n  Period covered by this report: 29 May to 19 July, 1940.\r\n\r\n_Commission and task._\r\n\r\nWith the nomination as Reich Commissioner the commission is given * * *\r\nin serving the interests of the Reich to secure public order and public\r\nlife. * * * and the task is connected * * * to bind the Netherlands,\r\nwhich have to remain independent for the purpose of the preservation of\r\nDutch Indies territory, as much as possible to the Reich economically,\r\napart from military security measures.\r\n\r\nThis task is to be solved if we succeed in bringing about a political\r\nattitude which would make it possible for the economic ties of the\r\nNetherlands to the Reich to appear to be the emanation of the will of\r\nthe Dutch people.\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible in every individual case to combine fulfillment\r\nof the given commission with the solution of the assigned task, for\r\nthe interest of the occupation power demands the extensive suppression\r\nof all possible public activities, while in order to create and lead\r\na formation of a political will it would be necessary to grant such\r\nfreedoms as would for the Dutch, make the final result their own\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n  [Page 2]\r\n\r\n_Situation._\r\n\r\nThe situation at the time the decree of the Fuehrer went into effect\r\n(29 May 1940) is characterized by the position of the Commander in\r\nChief of the Dutch Army and Navy (General Winkelmann). He exercised all\r\npower in the administration of the country, under the powers he had\r\nreceived in consideration of the state of siege and beyond that from\r\nthe government and the queen who had fled, and he was considered by the\r\npeople as a sort of viceroy. He issued orders, the Dutch Secretaries\r\nGeneral (offices corresponding to our State Secretaries) executed\r\ntheir orders in the name of Winkelmann within administrative machinery\r\nunchanged in personnel and functioning perfectly.\r\n\r\nWherever Winkelmann appeared in public he received ovations.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Army was in only slightly reduced mobilization strength under\r\nthe command of their own officers (Winkelmann's Staff) in the barracks\r\nand camps. The occupation force was not seen often.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the Dutch population--glad that the war is over,\r\npleasantly surprised by the conduct of the German troops, though\r\nat first the circles hostile to the Germans kept themselves\r\nreserved--concealed the real attitude of the Dutch toward the Germans.\r\nThe Dutch population for many years, especially since 1933, were\r\nstirred up by the emigrants, who were tolerated here as in no other\r\ncountry, against the Reich and National Socialism. The ability of\r\nforming their own political opinion is limited for the majority.\r\nPolitics and administration are in the hands of a [page 3] small group\r\n(ruling families), whose ideas and attitude are liberal and influenced\r\nmaterially and ideologically by the west.\r\n\r\nThe real wages of the employed population are generally higher than\r\nin the Reich. About 500,000 unemployed from about 2,000,000 people\r\ncapable of working in non-independent industry, trade, or business are\r\nbeing carried along with unemployment compensation up to 70% of simple\r\nwages, thanks to the riches of the Dutch Indies possessions, just as\r\nagriculture, struggling with sales and price difficulties, is supported\r\nalmost entirely by state subsidies.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch people are caught in political stagnation as well as in\r\neconomic immobility. In spite of a good external impression (racial\r\nappearance, cleanliness of the buildings and gardens, etc.) one can\r\nobserve extensive biological and even moral damage, such as unexpected\r\nuncleanliness among the unemployed and the country population in\r\nthe Calvinistic districts, poor physical constitution, exclusive\r\ninterest in material matters, and so on. The people are widely split\r\nconfessionally and within the confessional groups bound and influenced\r\nby all kinds of activities (from political organizations to chess\r\nclubs).\r\n\r\nThe Royal House of Orange lives on the prestige won in the battles for\r\nfreedom and is considered by the group oriented materially as in the\r\nwest [page 4] (big businessmen, financiers, industrialists, higher\r\nofficials, and court nobility) as a guarantee for their political\r\npredominance and economic positions. Additional motives, based on\r\nnational conviction, for bourgeois the devotion of the Dutch people\r\nto the royal family which is more a matter of habit, cannot be found,\r\nunless they think by clinging to the royal family to banish the fear of\r\nbeing overwhelmed by the Reich.\r\n\r\nThere was no real opposition against the system among the\r\nrepresentative bodies of the parliament. In the second chamber there\r\nwere 4 NSB men among 100 Deputies; Fascist and National Socialist\r\nideas, especially the latter--are tabooed, are considered evidence of\r\nbeing uneducated, and are now branded as the sentiments of traitors.\r\nThere are concrete indications that NSB were in the uniform of Dutch\r\nsoldiers intervened in support of the invading troops of the Reich.\r\n\r\nIn Dutch political life there are almost no personalities of any\r\nimportance. Somewhat outstanding from the average is the 71 year old\r\nColijn--although his basic character is domineering and energetic,\r\nhe is completely bound up with western-liberal views and as a\r\ndecided Calvinist he cannot be won for any National Socialist ideas.\r\nNoteworthy is his desire for importance, which might induce him to\r\nmake a political deal with the occupation power, in which he might be\r\nconceited enough to think that he could outwit us and keep a distance\r\nfrom the Reich with the help of the House of Orange.\r\n\r\n  [Page 5]\r\n\r\nThe system parties--that is, the Catholic State Party, the Christian\r\nPeople's Party (reformed), the Anti-Revolutionists (Calvinists,\r\ndescendants of the revolutionary Gueux), the Social Democrats, the\r\nDemocrats, etc., were entirely undisturbed as far as their party\r\norganizations, trade unions, press, etc., were concerned, and their\r\nactivities were only partly restricted by the state of siege. Apart\r\nfrom a strong horror propaganda against the NSB people, the political\r\nfactors and the greater part of the population were just biding their\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Rightist Parties, especially the NSB, were numerically an\r\nunimportant minority, against whom as a matter of course an arrogant\r\nrejection prevailed among the intellectuals, the capitalists, and\r\nalso among the greater part of the officers' corps. This attitude,\r\nstrengthened by the charge of treason, was carried over to the rest of\r\nthe population. Of leading men among the Rightists the following are to\r\nbe mentioned within the framework of the NSB:\r\n\r\n Mussert: A liberal nationalist attempting to use Fascist methods,\r\n who is in the end afraid of the greater German Reich. His political\r\n qualities are not as great as those of an average Gauleiter in the\r\n Reich. In the Netherlands he plays a not inconsiderable role with them.\r\n\r\n Rost van Tonningen: Ideologically perfectly adequate, adjusted to the\r\n Germanic idea and National Socialism, a temperamental and effective\r\n speaker yearning [page 6] for activity, does not find his strength in\r\n himself but tries to get support and steadiness from third persons.\r\n\r\n Count Ansembourg: No outspoken personality, positively valuable in\r\n spite of his obligation of creed (Catholic), he is more a tactician\r\n and diplomatic mediator.\r\n\r\n Geikerken: The representative of Mussert, with strong Walloon mixture,\r\n he is certainly a determined opponent of the system with reservations\r\n toward the Greater German Reich.\r\n\r\n Woudenberg: Representing labor in the NSB, he is the type of a\r\n union man without special initiative but with common sense and\r\n confidence-inspiring simplicity.\r\n\r\nSome younger men, such as Feldmeyer, Zondervan, and others, are--even\r\naccording to the standards of the party within the Reich--types of\r\nabsolutely good leaders of the rank and file. Special attention is due\r\nArnold Meijer, the leader of the Black Front, a Catholic Fascist group,\r\nwho has his followers in the southern parts, Brabant and Limburg, is\r\nwithout doubt bound to Catholism but strictly opposed to the liberal\r\ndemocratic course and is above all opposed to the political influence\r\nof the representatives of the Protestant North (Colijn, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe economic situation was nowhere threatening; supplies of all kinds\r\navailable in abundance, only the traffic has been largely interrupted\r\nby the blowing up of bridges and the consequent shifting of the canals,\r\nwhich handle 70% of the total traffic; sea traffic has been stopped\r\nentirely. The [page 7] agricultural improvement economy, dependent on\r\nthe import of disproportionately large quantities of fodder, possesses\r\nsupplies sufficient until the gathering of the next harvest.\r\n\r\nIt is the almost unanimous opinion of the Dutch that they were unjustly\r\nattacked by the Germans. The charges of violation of neutrality as\r\nreported by the communique of the High Command of the Armed Forces are\r\nnot known to the population or if known are rejected as justification.\r\nA certain impression is made by pointing out that on the soil of the\r\nNetherlands, with the cooperation of high Dutch officials, an attack on\r\nthe life of the Fuehrer was prepared. It is also admitted that it was\r\nat least unwise and probably unjust, too, that the emigrants from the\r\nReich in the Netherlands and the Dutch press were allowed to give news\r\nto their fury against the Reich and the National Socialist in such an\r\nunqualified form.\r\n\r\n_Measures._\r\n\r\nIn view of this state of affairs it was necessary first to remove\r\nWinkelmann's influence. This was done by expressly advising the\r\nSecretaries General that they now have to accept orders only from the\r\nReich commissioner, which they accepted explicitly. The institution\r\nof the Secretaries General as well as the persons themselves were\r\nretained, since it had to be considered improbable in case of their\r\nresignation to find Dutchmen--among the Rightists there are almost no\r\nsuitable persons at all--who would have taken over the administration.\r\nIt seemed politically necessary, however, that some measures,\r\nespecially economic ones [page 8] but indirectly also police ones, had\r\nto be taken, carrying the signatures of the Netherlands Secretaries\r\nGeneral, for the Dutch people. The attempt of one of the Secretaries\r\nGeneral to call on Winkelmann as authority--in the question of the\r\ncontinuation of the work in armament plants for the German Armed\r\nForces--was answered with the immediate dismissal of that Secretary\r\nGeneral. Winkelmann had to admit in a public declaration that he had\r\nonly to execute the demobilization under the command of the Commander\r\nof the Armed Forces, but that otherwise he had nothing to say. This\r\nacknowledgment as well as the fact that he publicly dropped a Secretary\r\nGeneral reduced Winkelmann's influence considerably. Finally he could\r\nbe quietly made a prisoner of war in connection with the known events\r\nof June 29.\r\n\r\nIn order to execute the given commission, an administrative body\r\nas small as possible was set up, divided into four working fields\r\nof the commissioners-general. The individual specialists of these\r\ncommissioners-general, as for instance the ones for finance, justice,\r\netc., are sitting as liaison men in the respective Dutch ministries.\r\nImportance was attached to an immediate and clear distribution of\r\ncompetences and determination of the performance of the work, because\r\nof the Dutch people, being very formal and casuistic by nature, need\r\nsuch a determination. This distribution has proved its worth so far, as\r\nthere has been no friction either within the administrative machinery\r\nor with the Dutch authorities for reasons of organization.\r\n\r\n  [Page 9]\r\n\r\nCommissioners are provided for the provinces, which have extensive\r\nautonomy. We hesitated to create this office, as it was necessary\r\nfirst to investigate conditions. Now it is seen that for this office\r\npolitically experienced men were needed rather than administration\r\nofficials. Therefore, through Reich Office Director Schmidt we\r\nrequested from Reichsleiter Bormann (Hess staff) some men who, almost\r\nentirely members of the party, are on their way here and can be put\r\ninto office in the provinces in a few days.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that with the occupation of the Netherlands a large number\r\nof economic but also police measures had to be taken, the first ones\r\nof which had the purpose of reducing the consumption of the population\r\nin order to get supplies for the Reich, on the one hand, and to secure\r\na just distribution of the remaining supplies, on the other hand. In\r\nconsideration of the assigned task, we had to endeavor to see to it\r\nthat all these measures carried the signature of Dutchmen. The Reich\r\nCommissioner therefore authorized the Secretaries-General to take all\r\nthe necessary measures by means of ordinances.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, up to today almost all orders concerning the\r\nseizure of supplies and their distribution to the population and\r\ndecrees about restrictions in the formation of public opinion have been\r\nissued but also agreements concerning the transport of extraordinarily\r\nlarge supplies to the Reich have [page 10] been made, all of which\r\nbear the signatures of the Dutch Secretaries General or the competent\r\neconomic leaders, so that all of these measures have the character of\r\nbeing voluntary. It should be mentioned in this connection that the\r\nSecretaries General were told in the first conversation that loyal\r\ncooperation was expected of them, but it would be their privilege to\r\nresign if something should be ordered which they felt they could not\r\nendorse. Up to date none of the Secretaries General has made use of\r\nthis privilege, so that one may reasonably conclude that they have\r\ncomplied with all requests of their own free will.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire seizure and distribution of food supplies and\r\ntextiles have been executed, at least all the respective orders have\r\nbeen issued and are being executed.\r\n\r\nA series of instructions concerning the reorientation of agriculture\r\nhave been issued and are being executed; essentially it is a question\r\nof seeing to it that the available fodder is used in such a way that\r\nas large a stock as possible of horned cattle is carried over into the\r\nnext farming period, about 80% at the expense of the over-dimensional\r\nstock of chickens and hogs. Rules and restrictions have been introduced\r\nin the organization of traffic and the principles for the regulation of\r\ngasoline as in the Reich were carried out here.\r\n\r\nRestricting the right to quit jobs as well as to cancel leases have\r\nbeen issued in order to check the liberal-capitalistic customs of\r\nthe Dutch employers [page 11] and to avoid unrest. In the same way,\r\nthe period for repayment of debts have been extended under certain\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOrdinances concerning news service, radio, etc., prohibit listening to\r\nforeign radio stations and introduce all other restrictions necessary\r\nin this field for defense reasons. The ordinance about registration and\r\ncontrol of enemy property as well as about confiscation of the property\r\nof persons who act hostile to the Reich and to Germans were in this\r\ncase issued in the name of the Reich commissioner. On the basis of this\r\nordinance an administrator for the property of the royal family has\r\nalready been appointed.\r\n\r\nThe supplies of raw materials have been seized and, with the consent\r\nof the General Field Marshal, distributed according to this system:\r\nthe Dutch keep enough raw materials to maintain their economy for\r\nhalf a year, whereby they receive the same distribution quotas as in\r\nthe Reich. The same principle of equal treatment is being used in the\r\nsupply of food, etc. This enabled us to secure considerable supplies of\r\nraw materials for the Reich, as for instance 70,000 tons of industrial\r\nfats, which is about half of the amount which the Reich lacks.\r\n\r\nThe bank moratorium could be canceled, bank deposits are increasing,\r\nthe stock exchange has been reopened to a limited extent. Bills\r\nconcerning the control of foreign currencies have been introduced\r\naccording to the standards in the Reich.\r\n\r\nFinally it was achieved that the Dutch state makes available in\r\nsufficient quantities all means needed by the Reich, including the\r\nGerman administration so that these expenses do not burden the Reich\r\nbudget in any way.\r\n\r\n  [Page 12]\r\n\r\nA sum of guilders has been liquidated to redeem the fiduciary monetary\r\ntender to the amount of about 36 million, further 100 million for\r\nthe purposes of the occupation army, especially the extension of the\r\nairports; further 50 million for raising the raw materials to be\r\nshipped to the Reich, insofar as they are not booty; further for\r\nunrestricted transfer to guarantee the remittance of the savings of\r\nthe Dutch workers brought into the Reich to their families, etc.\r\nFinally the rate of exchange of the fiduciary monetary tender, set at\r\nfirst by the army high command in the proportion of 1 guilder to 1.50\r\nReichsmark, has been reduced to the correct proportion of 1 guilder to\r\n1.33 RM.\r\n\r\nAbove all, however, it was possible to get the consent of the president\r\nof the bank of the Netherlands, Trip, to a measure suggested by\r\nCommissioner General Fischboeck and approved by the General Field\r\nMarshal, namely the unrestricted mutual obligation of accepting each\r\nother's currencies, that means that the Bank of the Netherlands is\r\nbound to take over any amount of Marks offered to it by the Reich Bank\r\nand in return to make available Dutch guilders at the rate of 1.33,\r\nthat is, 1 RM is 75 cents. Only the Reich bank has control over this,\r\nnot the Bank of the Netherlands, which will be notified only about the\r\nindividual transactions. This ruling goes far beyond all pertinent\r\nrulings made hitherto with the political economies of neighboring\r\ncountries, including the Protectorate, and actually represents the\r\nfirst step toward a currency union.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this significance of the agreements, which already\r\ntouches the independence of the Dutch State, it is of special weight\r\nthat the [page 13] president of the Bank, Trip, who is unusually\r\nwell-known in western banking and financial circles, signed this\r\nagreement of his own free will in the above sense.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, military jurisdiction was introduced, and at present\r\nGerman criminal jurisdiction is being set up; for special cases not\r\nonly the Special Court but also SS and Police jurisdiction have been\r\nprovided for as substitutes for court-martial jurisdiction, which\r\nwas not introduced. Subject to German criminal jurisdiction are: all\r\ncitizens of the Reich or the Protectorate without restriction and all\r\nDutch citizens and aliens in cases of crimes against the honor and\r\nsecurity of the Reich, the Armed Forces, etc.\r\n\r\nThe experiences with the Dutch officials show that these people, like\r\nall Dutchmen, are basically difficult. One has to negotiate with them\r\nvery much; if they say no, it does not mean definitely no, if they say\r\nyes they still think the matter over for a long time, but in the end\r\nthey will do as one wants them to. Besides, they want someone else to\r\ncarry the responsibility; since the Dutch still do not really believe\r\nthat England, which for centuries was the overwhelming power in Europe,\r\nis finally eliminated from the continent, in many cases they want a\r\ndirect order which they then obey, so that one day they will be able to\r\nrefer to this pressure. In general, however, one cannot complain about\r\nthe behavior of the officials in the execution of the administration.\r\nOne cannot say that the officials are delaying any vital work. For\r\ninstance, in restoring traffic routes, especially in clearing canals,\r\nthe respective ministry worked extremely to the purpose and fast. In\r\nthe fields, however, entirely liberal methods and principles prevail.\r\n\r\nThe Police itself is much split and is subordinated in the most\r\nimportant parts to the ministry of justice and not to the ministry of\r\nthe Interior. The special troops, the motorized and mounted units, are\r\nrelatively good, the Marechaussee, a sort of troop gendarmerie, is very\r\ngood. Among the latter we have already won some agents in the higher\r\nranks which makes probable a further extension in a sense favorable to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe Marechaussee will therefore be brought to a correspondingly high\r\nstandard by selected non-commissioned officers of the army and will be\r\nthe backbone of the executive.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of two mayors (in the Hague and in the provincial capital\r\nof Zwolle) had an extraordinary effect. The moment will come when\r\nit will be possible to exchange some of the Secretaries General and\r\npossibly also other officials, but in any case mayors.\r\n\r\nConcerning the right of assembly and association, we introduced the\r\nobligation of giving notice. The interdiction comes from the public\r\nprosecutors of the court of appeals (Subordination of the Police to\r\nthe Justice) who are working almost without complaint under the Higher\r\nSS and Police Fuehrer. The states-general were eliminated from public\r\nrepresentative bodies; the provincial states and the town councils\r\nwere kept for the time being, but they are under the supervision of\r\nthe provincial commissioner. Politics in these is not tolerated for\r\nthe present. The reconstruction of the country--except in Rotterdam,\r\nMiddelburg, and Rehnen the devastation is not very extensive--was\r\nplaced in the foreground of a visit to Middelburg the importance of the\r\npreservation of historic monuments as an expression of the will for\r\nformation of a people has been emphasized, and the social side of such\r\naction stressed by raising a fund for reconstruction. In the handling\r\nof this reconstruction fund the reactionary spirit of the Dutch\r\nadministration is especially evident.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to give special attention to the reconstruction of\r\nRotterdam. Rotterdam, thanks to its position at the mouth of the\r\nRhine, the possibility for sea-going vessels to sail far inland,\r\nand the harbor conditions, which are in every respect favorable, is\r\ndoubtless a place which disposes of the best natural port facilities\r\nin Central Europe, which can even be increased by the completion\r\nof the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, as its sphere of action will reach\r\nfrom Rotterdam to Constanta. With regard to developments in the more\r\ndistant future one must consider whether one should not exercise\r\ninfluence on the reconstruction of Rotterdam in such a way that the\r\ncity with this unique opportunity for construction should receive the\r\nimprint of a big sea-port of the Germanic area. The demobilization of\r\nthe Dutch Army, which has now finally been accomplished, was carried\r\nout without complaints. The officers and men not taken over into\r\nother occupations were transferred, with the exception of the higher\r\nranks, to construction service. This is to be the basis for a future\r\nLabor Service. It is led by the Dutch Major Breunesse, who has long\r\nbeen in contact with the men of the Reich Labor Service in the Reich\r\n(Mueller-Brandenburg) and has always taken the part of the Reich. The\r\nimpression this man makes is an excellent one, at present decidedly\r\nnon-political, as is usual among officers, [page 16] ideologically\r\nall right. It is assumed that within three to six months the present\r\nconstruction service can be liquidated, that is, the men will be\r\ninducted into economic operations and there will be a basis for a real\r\nLabor Service. The organization is already being built up with the\r\nco-operation of the head of the Reich Labor Service, Hierl.\r\n\r\nThe extremely ramified and numerous Dutch press has not been submitted\r\nto a preliminary censorship, as that would have destroyed all press\r\nlife immediately. By holding press conferences under the supervision\r\nof Schmidt the big press is managed well and successfully. The danger\r\nof some slips, becoming more and more rare, was accepted in view of\r\nthe necessity of keeping the press alive. Circulation is falling off,\r\nhowever--a not unusual phenomenon, which has the advantage, though,\r\nthat the newspapers get into difficulties and can therefore be folded\r\nup or taken out of the hands of the present owners. The NSB press is\r\nalready completely available, there is a personal influence at the\r\nTelegraph and within the next few days the entire S.D.P. Press is\r\ngoing to be taken over in connection with a corresponding political\r\naction which is already underway. The German newspaper has reached a\r\ncirculation of 30,000. About half of the subscribers are Dutch. A quite\r\nextensive press front is therefore available.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the occupation power the present development\r\ncan be considered satisfactory. The supplies for the occupation army\r\nare being delivered, the work, etc., is being done in order, and\r\nthere are almost no cases of sabotage. There is [page 17] no need at\r\nall to fear active resistance by the population. There are, however,\r\nsigns of rather extensive espionage, at any rate there is contact with\r\nEngland, probably by short-wave radio. In this respect there is close\r\ncooperation between the Counter-Intelligence posts of the Armed Forces\r\nand the Security Police posts, since it seems necessary to ascertain\r\nsuch cases as soon as possible and to punish them exemplarily (death\r\nsentences).\r\n\r\nConcerning the political developments in regard to the assigned task,\r\nI have the following to say: The Dutch have stepped out of their\r\npolitical reserve. Disregarding the continued or rather increased\r\nanimosity among the circles which heretofore formed political interest\r\nfor the Reich is increasing. It is noteworthy in this connection that\r\nthe former opponents, insofar as they are beginning to change their\r\nopinion, want to establish contact not with the N.S.B. but rather\r\ndirectly with the N.S.D.A.P. and the Reich. A conversation with Colijn,\r\nwho thereupon wrote a pamphlet, did much to help overcome the reserve.\r\nThe main points of this pamphlet are summarized in the statement\r\nthat in Continental Europe, England has doubtless been eliminated by\r\nthe Reich and that the Reich will lead this continental Europe. The\r\nNetherlands must adjust itself to that fact if they hope, in closest\r\neconomic cooperation with the Reich, to retain their independence in\r\nclinging to the House of Orange. This attitude of Colijn has had a very\r\ngreat effect, as it was the cue for Protestant and especially Calvinist\r\ncircles to discuss the new situation, whereby Colijn's statement on the\r\nimportance of the Reich was considered as an authoritative declaration,\r\nbut his [page 18] conclusions were subjected to lively criticism.\r\nColijn later in his newspaper (Standard) questioned the correctness of\r\na document of the last White Book. The Standard was thereupon banned\r\nfor 8 weeks and Colijn got a warning. At the moment he is designated\r\nnot only by the N.S.B. but also by the group of Arnold Meijers as a\r\nworn-out politician who himself has to take the blame for developments,\r\nand he is holding back. His importance is not actual but potential.\r\n\r\nAt the moment many efforts toward concentration are to be noted, which\r\nmake it their task to appear as partners in a contract with the Reich.\r\nThe attempt of the system parties to regain influence through Colijn\r\nhas been, at least for the moment, rejected by the public. His place\r\nwas taken by a group of the commissioners of the province of Groningen\r\nLindhorst-Homann and of the Catholic politician De Quai. They presented\r\na proclamation to Reichsamtsleiter Schmidt. He refused to authorize it\r\nand pointed out that a profession of loyalty to the House of Orange\r\ncould not be tolerated by the occupation power. This group was confused\r\nthereby and lost much of its prestige among the people, which had not\r\nbeen too great, anyway.\r\n\r\nRight now a political action against the K.P. (Communist party) and\r\nthe S.D.P. (Social Democrat Party) is in progress. The K.P. does not\r\nexercise any activity, the S.D.P. has its main support in the free\r\ntrade unions. The heads of these free unions have now been dismissed\r\nand the above-mentioned Woudenberg has been appointed provisional head.\r\nThis reorganization took place--as far as we can see--[page 19] without\r\ncomplaint and the former functionaries offered their cooperation\r\nwillingly. In direct connection with this action the political\r\norganizations of the Communist and Social Democrat parties are being\r\nsubordinated to Rost Van Tonningen as liquidation commissioner, who has\r\norders to liquidate the K.P. entirely and to transfer its funds to the\r\nassets of the S.D.P., which are administered by him. By taking over the\r\nleadership of the free unions and the SDP organizations, especially its\r\npress, we gained a broad basis political influence on the Dutch people,\r\nfor this party represented 20 to 22% of the Dutch population.\r\n\r\nArrangements have been made with the N.S.B., according to which the\r\norganizations corresponding to the SA and the SS, as well as the youth\r\norganization will be built up. It will be of special importance that\r\nthrough the disciplined marching of these organizations an appropriate\r\nimpression is made, especially on the working classes but also on the\r\nrest of the Dutch population.\r\n\r\nAside from these arrangements in the political field we have now begun\r\ngathering together pro-German and obliging circles in the field of\r\neconomy especially agriculture, culture, art, and science, first in a\r\nloose social form in order to create a circle of friends of the new\r\nGermany or the new Europe, who will gradually become the carriers of\r\nopinion and will in the corresponding fields. The first step has been\r\ntaken successfully in the field of the press. Under the leadership of\r\nProf. De Gudewagen a sort of press committee has been formed, to which\r\nthe right-thinking press people belong. After initial reluctance,\r\ntoday all the journalists of the Netherlands are aspiring to this\r\nassociation, in which the press people hostile in the past [page\r\n20] toward the Reich are not accepted even if they are considered\r\nespecially leading.\r\n\r\nThe attempt is made to establish contact with the Dutch Indies. There\r\nare daily radio broadcasts on the regular wave length, bringing reports\r\nfrom the homeland, even news about individual persons and families, so\r\nthat we can assume that in time the Dutch people in the Dutch Indies\r\nwill tune their radios to this wave length.\r\n\r\nIt can already be said today with some confidence that it is only\r\na question of time until the Dutch people can be won also in their\r\npolitical formation of will for a program of a close connection of the\r\nindependent Netherlands and the Dutch Indies with the Reich (union of\r\ncurrency and economy). The decision boils down to the question of the\r\nmonarchy. In that question it has gone so far that some leading people\r\nalready realize that Queen Wilhelmina is opposed to this development\r\nand that Crown Princess Juliana is also rather out of the question on\r\naccount of her marriage with Biesterfeld. The royalists therefore now\r\nspeak only of holding to the house of Orange, and individual voices are\r\nalready heard advocating the appointment of a regent to take care of\r\naffairs until the question of the monarchy is ripe for a final decision.\r\n\r\nAny manifestations for the Queen or for the House of Orange, which\r\nis represented only by Crown Princess Juliana, who is married to\r\nBiesterfeld, will no longer be tolerated, with the explanation that\r\nthe Queen persistently remains in the ranks of the enemy and does not\r\noppose the British air-raids on the Netherlands. From the view point of\r\nthe occupation power a manifestation for the Queen must be considered\r\nin the same light as a manifestation for Churchill, for example. [Page\r\n21] This point of view will be enforced with increasing severity. Since\r\nthe Queen apparently hopes to be supported by Dutch Indies circles,\r\nthere is danger that this legitimistic attitude could lead to a break\r\nbetween the Netherlands and the Dutch Indies. The Dutch people show\r\nincreasing understanding for these arguments, and there is really no\r\nlonger any doubt that the Dutch, at least in Europe, are ready to\r\nrenounce the Queen and probably also the crown princess, if the Reich\r\ncould offer them a guarantee that the Dutch Indies will be kept by the\r\nDutch even against possible endeavors of the United States or Japan.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the possibility should be discussed of transferring\r\nthe province of Zeeland to a new territorial formation around Antwerp\r\nand the province of Limburg to a new Gau-division. In this regard it\r\nmust be mentioned that such a transfer at this moment would probably\r\ndestroy all prospects of a political solution. That is certainly\r\ntrue of Zeeland. The people living here are really of Frisian origin\r\nand have nothing in common with the population around Antwerp. In\r\nthe post-war period of 1918-20 they were strongly opposed to an\r\nincorporation into Belgium. It could even be used as a pressure on\r\nthe Netherlands to reach a currency and economy union if we demand\r\nthe cession of Zeeland as the economic passage area for the port\r\nof Antwerp. The Dutch people will certainly be ready to agree to a\r\nfar-reaching economic union if in return they can retain politically\r\nthe province of Zeeland.\r\n\r\n  [Page 22]\r\n\r\n_Statements._\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is stated that--\r\n\r\n1. Order and security are perfectly secured.\r\n\r\n2. The administration is at present sufficiently and for the future\r\nincreasingly under the direction and control of the German authorities.\r\n\r\n3. Economy and traffic have been set going and converted to war\r\nconditions, plans for a large-scale transformation to continental\r\neconomy have been started, the preparation for it is almost universal,\r\nthe supplies of the country have been conducted into the war economy of\r\nthe Reich, the financial sources for it have been widely opened up and\r\njoined with the management of the Reich, all on the basis of extensive\r\ncooperation of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n4. The necessity of deviating from the democratic party system is\r\nbecoming more and more the general opinion. The endeavor to get into\r\na close friendly relationship with the Reich is increasing. That\r\nthe question of the House of Orange arises in this connection is\r\nbecoming more and more evident. The fate of the Dutch Indies is more\r\nsignificant, however.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed in retaining the people belonging to the free trade\r\nunions and to the SDP organizations, and if the NSB makes a further\r\nprogress, one-fourth to one-third of the Dutch people will in\r\nwell-organized form be going the same road as the Reich, whereas the\r\nother groups will be split and undecided. Moreover, the workers and\r\nfarmers--the latter, if the worst comes to the worst [Page 23] by the\r\nsuggestion of the idea of agrarian reform, for almost half of the\r\nfarmland is divided into small tenant farms--will only gain from a\r\nunion with the Reich. The labor service is being used for ideological\r\ntraining, and the intellectual circles are being used in social form as\r\nneeded. The question, in what way the political opinion which is being\r\nformed can be used, remains open. The answer depends partly on the\r\nconditions of the moment.\r\n\r\n  Signed: SEYSS-INQUART\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 998-PS\r\n\r\n  GERMAN CRIMES AGAINST CZECHOSLOVAKIA\r\n\r\n Czechoslovak Official Report for the Prosecution and Trial of the\r\n German Major War Criminals by the International Military Tribunal,\r\n established according to the Agreement of the Four Great Powers of\r\n August 8th, 1945. London, September, 1945. Excerpts from pages 9 to 18.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The Criminal Plan\r\n\r\n (4) _The Chief Instrument: The Sudeten-German Henlein Movement_\r\n\r\n(a) _Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiter Partei_ (DNSAP).\r\n\r\nFundamental parts of the national socialist ideology derived from the\r\nCzechoslovak Germans Knirsch, Krebs and Jung who, in Bohemia in May\r\n1918, had reconstituted the German National Socialist Workers' Party\r\n(Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiter Partei--DNSAP). Hitler's\r\nparty to come was the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei\r\nNSDAP.\r\n\r\nIn permanent contact with the National Socialists of the Reich, the\r\nGerman National Socialists in Czechoslovakia founded an organization\r\ncalled \"Volksport\" (People's Sport) for youth over 21, modeled exactly\r\non the Storm Troops (S.A.) of the Reich.\r\n\r\nHeadstrong youths of the \"Volksport\" sailed nearest the wind. In 1932,\r\nits student ringleaders were charged with planning armed rebellion\r\non behalf of a foreign power and sentenced for conspiring against\r\nthe Republic, for having openly endorsed the 21 points of Hitler's\r\nprogramme, the first of which demanded the union of all Germans in a\r\nGreat German State.\r\n\r\nThis incident was greatly exploited against the so-called Activists\r\n(German parties cooperating with the Czechs), who were accused of\r\ncomplacence to the Czechs and failure to vindicate German rights. It\r\ncoincided with Hitler's accession to power.\r\n\r\nLate in 1933, the National Socialist Party in Czechoslovakia\r\nforestalled its dissolution by voluntary liquidation, and several of\r\nits chiefs escaped across the frontier. This caused in German press and\r\nradio an outburst of violent threats against Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nFor a year the Nazi activity in Czechoslovakia was continued but\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Deutsche Heimatfront._\r\n\r\nOn October 1st, 1934, Konrad Henlein, the \"unpolitical\" gymnastic\r\ninstructor of the German Gymnastic Federation [Turnverband] of the\r\nRepublic, established the \"German Home Front\" [Deutsche Heimatfront].\r\nHe denied any relation to the late German National Socialist Party in\r\nCzechoslovakia and any connection of the \"German Home Front\" with the\r\nNazi Party in Germany as well. He even refused to organize the German\r\nHome Front on party lines, although he built it up on the basis of the\r\nNazi \"Fuehrerprinzip\" (principle of leadership), and himself became\r\nthe \"Fuehrer\" of the \"Heimatfront.\" But he attempted a camouflage:\r\nhe rejected pan-Germanism, he insisted that Fascism and Nazism alike\r\nlost their natural \"raison d'etre\" at the Czechoslovak frontiers;\r\nhe declared himself against the revision of the Versailles Treaty,\r\nhe professed the unconditional respect for individual rights and\r\nliberties, he argued with great fervour that loyalty of the \"Sudeten\r\nGermans\" to the German nation and at the same time to the Czechoslovak\r\nState were not mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _The \"Sudetendeutsche Partei\"_ (SDP).\r\n\r\nThe Czechoslovak election system is based on Party representation.\r\nHenlein, therefore, changed the German Home Front into the\r\n\"Sudetendeutsche Partei\" (Sudeten Germans' Party), for the purpose of\r\nparticipation in the General Elections of May 1935 for the National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nEconomic distress owing to the trade crisis increased the\r\nsusceptibility of the German population in Czechoslovakia for the new\r\nGerman Messiah and Henlein won a resounding victory over all other\r\nGerman parties.\r\n\r\nWhen the election results were made known--the Henleinists won 44 seats\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies to the National Assembly--Henlein sent a\r\nloyalty telegram to President Masaryk.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) _The Policy and Tactics of the \"Sudetendeutsche Partei.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _1935-1936: Still \"for Democracy.\"_\r\n\r\nHenlein continued to present himself as a friend of democracy\r\nespecially in London where he lectured in 1935 at Chatham House in\r\nthe Royal Institute of International Affairs. He stated there that he\r\nrefused the totalitarian principle and that he was in favor of \"an\r\nhonest democracy.\" \"We want a democracy such as is recommended by\r\nMasaryk,\" he emphasized. He denied \"Nazism\" or \"Hitlerism\" to be a\r\ndoctrine \"suitable for exportation,\" he rejected anti-Semitism.\r\n\r\n\r\n (b) _1937: For complete Autonomy of Sudeten Germans but still within\r\n the framework of the Czechoslovak Republic._\r\n\r\nIn 1937 Henlein struck a somewhat shriller note than before demanding,\r\nwithout defining \"complete Sudeten autonomy.\" The \"Sudetendeutsche\r\nPartei\" laid draft proposals before Parliament amounting to little\r\nshort of creating a state within a state. The whole document, though\r\nmoderately worded, was already based on totalitarian principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n (c) _1938: For Nazism and for Incorporation of the Sudeten Areas into\r\n the German Reich._\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Austria (March 1938) the Henleinists openly\r\njubilated. Nearly all German \"Activist parties\" were now stampeded\r\ninto the Henlein camp leaving the fight against the \"Sudentendeutsche\r\nPartei\" only to the German Social Democrats and Communists. The\r\nterrorism of the Henleinists increased. They intensified their campaign\r\nagainst \"Bolshevism.\" Open anti-Semitic propaganda started in the\r\nHenlein press.\r\n\r\nOn April 24th, 1938, Henlein came into the open with his \"Karlsbad\r\nProgramme,\" set forth in his speech made to the Party Congress in\r\nKarlovy Vary. In every line of it could be heard not so much Herr\r\nHenlein himself as his master's voice. In the Karlsbad Programme among\r\nothers the right of the Sudeten Germans to profess \"German political\r\nphilosophy\" in other words, National Socialism, was claimed.\r\n\r\nIn May 1938, Henlein visited Hitler in Berlin and after obtaining his\r\nmaster's instructions was back in London at his old game of intriguing\r\nagainst the Czechoslovak Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Local Government elections in May 1938--well prepared by the\r\nHenleinists by vast propaganda, opened terrorism, unscrupulous using of\r\nmoney, bribery of electors, etc.,--showed 80-90% of votes for Henlein.\r\nSo almost the whole German population stood behind Henlein.\r\n\r\nThe Czech Government continued to negotiate with Henlein, but on\r\nSeptember 14th,--two days before Hitler fulminated in his Nurnberg\r\nspeech against \"this Benes\" and accused him of \"torturing\" and planning\r\nthe \"extermination\" of the Sudeten Germans--he threw off his mask, fled\r\nto the Reich declaring on the wireless: \"We want to go home to the\r\nReich,\" and denouncing \"the Hussite Bolshevik criminals of Prague.\"\r\n\r\nK.H. Frank, interrogated by Colonel Dr. B. Ecer on May 30th, 1945, at\r\nWiesbaden, stated that the slogan \"Heim ins Reich\" (Homewards to the\r\nReich) was backed by 90% of the Sudeten Germans.\r\n\r\nFew people knew before that Henlein went on Hitler's pay roll already\r\nin 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _\"Sudetendeutsche Partei\" changed into a Nazi Party._\r\n\r\nAfter Munich the \"Sudetendeutsche Partei,\" in the areas ceded to\r\nGermany, entered as a whole into the Reich's Nazi Party. In the not\r\nyet occupied parts of the Republic, the \"Sudetendeutsche Partei\"\r\nconstituted itself as \"Nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiter-Partei\r\nin der Tschechoslovakei\" (German Nazi Party in Czechoslovakia).\r\n\r\nAfter the total occupation (March 15th, 1939) of Bohemia and Moravia\r\nthis party too became part of the Reich Nazi Party. (About their\r\nactivity after Munich see Section 7.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) _Henlein's Admission._\r\n\r\nIn a speech made on March 4th, 1941, in Vienna, published in official\r\nNazi papers, Henlein stated: \"In order to protect ourselves against\r\nCzech interference, we were compelled to lie and to deny our allegiance\r\nto the National Socialist cause. We should have preferred advocating\r\nNational Socialism openly. However, it is doubtful whether in doing\r\nso, we would have been able to perform the task of destroying\r\nCzechoslovakia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) _System and Methods of Nazi Pre-War Infiltration._\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Seeds of Discord._\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party's study and research groups had long been instructed\r\nnot only to establish close cooperation with the German minority in\r\nthe Czechoslovak Republic, but also to win over adherents from the\r\nSlovak autonomist opposition. Long before the Austrian Anschluss in\r\nMarch 1938, Nazi circles were not only in close contact with Slovak\r\ntraitors living in exile (most of whom were directly employed by the\r\nHungarian irredentists), but also tried to establish contacts in the\r\norganizational machinery of Hlinka's Slovak Peoples' Party (the Slovak\r\nCatholic Peoples' Party of the late Monsignor Andrew Hlinka). When the\r\ntraitor Bela Tuka (later to become Prime Minister of \"independent\"\r\nSlovakia) was tried for espionage and treason in 1929, the evidence\r\nestablished the Nazi connections with him.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi Party had paid agents among the higher staff of the Hlinka\r\nParty. Their task was to render impossible any understanding between\r\nthe Slovak autonomists and the slovak parties in the Government of\r\nPrague.\r\n\r\nK.H. Frank, interrogated by Col. Dr. B. Ecer on May 30th, 1945, at\r\nWiesbaden, confirmed the close cooperation between the \"Sudetendeutsche\r\nPartei\" (Sudeten German Party, headed by Konrad Henlein; details see\r\nSections 4 and 5) with the Slovakian Peoples' Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Espionage._\r\n\r\nMilitary espionage was conducted by members of the German minority\r\non behalf of Germany. The Republic had to amend in 1936 the \"Act for\r\nProtection of the Republic\" of 1923 to cope with the widespread treason\r\nactivity of the Henleinists and of the Reich Germans from beyond the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nPlans of Henleinists discovered by the police showed that the Henlein\r\nNazis had, in every district, compiled lists of all German democrats,\r\nsocialists and communists as well as of Czechs of all parties, and were\r\nplanning to round up and arrest them on the anticipated arrival of the\r\nReichswehr.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _Murder, terrorism, anti-Semitism._\r\n\r\nThe Nazis from the Reich sent directly to Czechoslovakia their\r\nterrorists and murderers; thus the anti-Nazis, Professor Theodor\r\nLessing and Ing. Formis who escaped after 1933 from Germany and were\r\ngiven refuge in Czechoslovakia, were murdered in Czechoslovakia by\r\nNazi agents, Lessing in 1933 and Formis in 1935. The Nazis from the\r\nReich sent their Gestapo into the border districts to drag Czechoslovak\r\ncitizens across the border to Germany. They also sent money and arms\r\nto the Henleinists who time and again provoked incidents in order just\r\nto keep permanent unrest. They attacked gendarmes, customs officers\r\nand other State officials who time and again suffered casualties. The\r\nHenleinists terrorized the non-Henlein population and in several cases\r\nmurdered political foes.\r\n\r\nAnti-semitic propaganda was carried through in the Henlein press and\r\nboycott set in against Jewish lawyers, doctors, tradesmen, shops, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _Propaganda._\r\n\r\nDisruptive propaganda came from Germany especially through the\r\nGerman broadcasts. Dr. Goebbels launched \"The-Nest-of-Bolshevism\"\r\ncampaign against Czechoslovakia and the lie of\r\n\"Russian-troops-and-airplanes-in-Prague,\" etc. The Nazis from the\r\nReich directed the whispering propaganda of the Henleinists, thus\r\nmaintaining a permanent state of high tension in the war of nerves.\r\n\r\nThe Henleinists spread more or less openly the Nazi ideology among the\r\nGerman population through their press and publications and smuggled\r\nillegal Nazi literature into the border regions from Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) _Headquarters in Germany._\r\n\r\nThe Nazis entertained in Stuttgart the \"Ausland-Organisation der NSDAP\"\r\nfor German propaganda in other countries in cooperation with the\r\nGerman population of those countries. This organization was headed by\r\nGauleiter Bohle, who had the task of administering the \"Gau Ausland\"\r\n(district: foreign countries). A comprehensive system with scientific\r\nmethods of penetration was worked out. In Czechoslovakia the tool of\r\nGerman infiltration through Fifth Columns was the \"Sudetendeutsche\r\nPartei\" (see Sections 4 and 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) _Nazification of German Institutions in the Czechoslovak Republic._\r\n\r\nThe Henleinists penetrated systematically step by step into the whole\r\nlife of the German population of Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nAll institutions underwent gradually \"Gleichschaltung,\" i.e., the\r\nprevailing domination of all Associations, social and cultural\r\ncentres, etc., by the Henleinists. Sport societies, football, light\r\nathletics, rowing clubs, etc., were \"conquered,\" just as associations\r\nof ex-service men, choral societies or associations for diet reform.\r\n\r\nNearly all theatres in German parts of Czechoslovakia were \"conquered\"\r\nby the Nazis, and all German orchestras as well.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the Henleinists were greatly interested in\r\npenetrating into as many economic institutions as possible and to bring\r\nover to their side the directors of banks, the owners or directors\r\nof factories, commercial firms, etc. In cases of Jewish owners or\r\ndirectors they tried to secure the cooperation of possibly the whole\r\nclerical and technical staff of the respective institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(g) _Orders from Berlin._\r\n\r\nThe Henleinists entertained permanent contact with their German masters.\r\n\r\nAttendance of Sudeten Germans at Reich German celebrations,\r\nSaengerfeste (Choral Festivals), Gymnastic Shows and Assemblies, the\r\nLeipzig Fair, etc., were often the pretext for organized meetings to\r\ninstruct the native Fifth Columnists and to inspire their activity.\r\n\r\nWhenever Hitler, in his War of Nerves against Czechoslovakia, needed\r\nincidents, the Henleinists supplied them promptly.\r\n\r\nAs one instance of many we quote Sir Nevile Henderson who reports in\r\nhis book \"Failure of a Mission,\" London, April 1940, the meeting of\r\nChamberlain and Hitler in Berchtesgaden on September 15th, 1938:\r\n\r\n * * * there was a constant influx of German Press telegrams about\r\n incidents in the Sudeten lands. One, I remember, reported that\r\n forty Germans had been killed in a clash somewhere with Czech\r\n gendarmes. A British observer, of whom there were already a number in\r\n Czechoslovakia, and who was immediately sent to verify the facts of\r\n the case, subsequently ascertained that there had, in fact, been one\r\n death.\r\n\r\nHenderson adds that it was a typical example of the method of\r\nexaggeration and actual falsification of news.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) _Intensified Activity of the Henlein Nazis after Munich._\r\n\r\nAfter Munich Henlein's deputy Kundt became the leader of the German\r\nminority still left inside the mutilated Republic and created\r\nunscrupulously as many artificial \"focal points of German culture\"\r\nas possible. Germans from the districts handed over to Germany\r\nwere ordered from Berlin to continue their studies at the German\r\nUniversity in Prague, and to make it a centre of aggressive Nazism. The\r\npost-Munich government had to allow the German minority in Prague and\r\nother Czech parts of the country \"to develop freely in conformity with\r\nthe Nazi theories and not to prohibit its political activity.\"\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that that \"political activity\" pursued only\r\nthe aim to undermine and to weaken the Czechs' resistance against the\r\ncommands from Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Henleinists cooperated with the Gestapo from the Reich infiltrating\r\ninto the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe press was, via facti, subjected to censorship exercised by Germans.\r\n\r\nGerman civil servants who, before Munich, had become members of the\r\nSDP, attained dominating influence in their positions and assisted the\r\nNazi infiltration into Czechoslovak public and private institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n(8) _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThe separation of \"Sudetengebiet\" was the death blow for the economic\r\nindependence of Czechoslovakia. The frontiers imposed on her by the\r\nAgreement of Munich and Vienna cut her railway lines at many places,\r\nthus making impossible any strategic defence of the mutilated country,\r\nwhich soon fell a victim to the German aggression.\r\n\r\nHenlein's Fifth Columns in Czechoslovakia as described above, had their\r\nbig part in assisting Hitler to achieve his aim.\r\n\r\nAs Henlein put it (see Section 5, (e)): \"We should have preferred\r\nadvocating National Socialism openly. However, it is doubtful whether\r\nin doing so we would have been able to perform the task of destroying\r\nCzechoslovakia.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DESTRUCTION OF CZECH CULTURAL LIFE\r\n\r\nPar. 5. Religious Persecution.\r\n\r\n(c) _Protestant Churches._\r\n\r\n  [Page 62]\r\n\r\nReference to Hus, Zizka, and the Hussites and their achievements as\r\nwell as to Masaryk and his Legions were strictly prohibited, even the\r\nreligious text books were changed. Church leaders were especially\r\npersecuted, scores of ministers were imprisoned in concentration camps,\r\namong them the General Secretary of the Students' Christian Movement in\r\nCzechoslovakia. One of the vice-Presidents was executed.\r\n\r\nProtestant Institutions such as the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. were\r\nsuppressed throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAmong the murdered Czech ministers was a pastor of the Czech Brethren\r\nEvangelical Church, who was killed with his wife among the hostages\r\nexecuted for the assassination of Heydrich.\r\n\r\nThe leading Theological School for all Evangelical denominations,\r\nHus Faculty in Prague and all other Protestant training schools for\r\nthe ministry were closed down in November 1939, with the other Czech\r\nuniversities and colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _Czech Orthodox Church._\r\n\r\nThe hardest blow was directed against the Czech Orthodox Church.\r\nThe Orthodox churches in Czechoslovakia were ordered by the Berlin\r\nMinistry of Church Affairs to leave the Pontificat of Belgrade and\r\nConstantinople respectively and to become subordinate to the Berlin\r\nBishop. The Czech Bishop Gorazd was executed together with two other\r\npriests of the Orthodox Church. By a special order of the Protector\r\nDaluege, issued in September 1942, the Orthodox Church of Serbian\r\nConstantinople jurisdiction was completely dissolved in the Czech\r\nlands, its religious activity forbidden and its property confiscated.\r\n\r\nAll Evangelical education was handed over to the civil authorities and\r\nmany Evangelical teachers lost their employment; moreover the State\r\ngrant to salaries of many Evangelical priests was taken away.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) _Jews._\r\n\r\nThe racial persecution of the Jews is dealt with separately (Section\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nIn connection with religious persecutions, we may mention the statement\r\nof K.H. Frank, made on June 11, 1945 when interrogated by Col. Dr. Ecer\r\nat Wiesbaden. Frank stated that in November 1938 the Jewish places of\r\nworship in the \"Sudeten\" province were torn down by express order of\r\nthe Party, i.e. the Party Chancellery of Munich at the head of which at\r\nthat time was Rudolf Hess, and in the autumn of 1941 it was Heydrich\r\nwho ordered all synagogues to be closed, because \"they had served as\r\nmeeting places for aggressive Jewish elements.\" Many synagogues were\r\ndemolished, others transformed into marketing halls or into auction\r\nhalls for the sale of confiscated Jewish furniture and household goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1012-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  SSD--TELEGRAM\r\n\r\n  Anna 4873 3 February 42 1650\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  To the Military Commander of France\r\n  Attention of Infantry General Von Stuelpnagel, Paris.\r\n  Reference: Telegram of 1 Jan. 1942.\r\n\r\nGeneral Field Marshal _Keitel_, after a conference with the Fuehrer,\r\nrefuses to consider the plan of sole judging and arbitrary final\r\ndecision for measures in cases of assault and acts of violence with\r\nexplosives which was proposed from there as long as the measures which\r\nare proposed from there do not take into consideration in their type\r\nand magnitude the fundamental attitude of the Fuehrer for assaults and\r\nviolent acts with explosives which have been reported since Jan. 15,\r\nand which have not yet been clarified but are on the increase.

One\r\ncannot predict it with certainty. I figure on a trade-barrier not on\r\nblockade, and with severance of relations. Most iron determination\r\non our side. Retreat before nothing. Everybody shall have to make a\r\npoint of it that we were determined from the beginning to fight the\r\nWestern powers. Struggle for life or death. Germany has won every\r\nwar as long as she was united. Iron, unflinching attitude of all\r\nsuperiors, greatest confidence, faith in victory, overcoming of the\r\npast by getting used to heaviest strain. A long period of peace would\r\nnot do us any good. Therefore it is necessary to expect everything.\r\nManly bearing.. It is not machines that fight each other. We have the\r\nbetter quality of men. Mental factors are decisive. The opposite camp\r\nhas weaker people. In 1918, the Nation fell down because the mental\r\nprerequisites were not sufficient. Frederic the Great secured final\r\nsuccess only through his mental power.\r\n\r\nDestruction of Poland in the foreground. The aim is elimination of\r\nliving forces, not the arrival at a certain line: Even if war should\r\nbreak out in the West, the destruction of Poland shall be the primary\r\nobjective. Quick decision because of the season.\r\n\r\nI shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war--never mind\r\nwhether it be plausible or not. The victor shall not be asked, later\r\non, whether we told the truth or not. In starting and making a war, not\r\nthe Right is what matters but Victory.\r\n\r\nHave no pity. Brutal attitude. 80 million people shall get what is\r\ntheir right. Their existence has to be secured. The strongest has the\r\nRight. Greatest severity.\r\n\r\nQuick decision necessary. Unshakable faith in the German soldier. A\r\ncrisis may happen only if the nerves of the leaders give way.\r\n\r\nFirst aim; advance to the Vistula and Narew. Our technical superiority\r\nwill break the nerves of the Poles. Every newly created Polish force\r\nshall again be broken at once. Constant war of attrition.\r\n\r\nNew German frontier according to healthy principles. Possibly a\r\nprotectorate as a buffer. Military operations shall not be influenced\r\nby these reflections. Complete destruction of Poland is the military\r\naim. To be fast is the main thing. Pursuit until complete elimination.\r\n\r\nConviction that the German Wehrmacht is up to the requirements. The\r\nstart shall be ordered, probably by Saturday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1015-B-PS\r\n\r\n  SPECIAL STAFF FOR PICTORIAL ART\r\n\r\nReport of work during the period from October 1940 to July 1944\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the decree of the Fuehrer of 17 September 1940 relative\r\nto the seizure of ownerless works of art formerly possessed by Jews in\r\nthe occupied Western territories, the special staff for pictorial art\r\ncommenced at the beginning of October 1940 in Paris with the seizure\r\nof the works of art abandoned by the internationally known Jewish\r\nRothschild family, which was also famous as the possessor of great art\r\ncollections. It was not possible for the various members of the Jewish\r\nRothschild family, nor for many other rich French Jews, to take any\r\nconsiderable part of their part possessions to England and America in\r\ntheir precipitous flight before the German occupation. The staff has\r\nnot only seized very great parts of the art treasures abandoned in\r\nthe Paris City Palaces of the Rothschilds, but it also systematically\r\nsearched the country-seats of the individual members of the Rothschild\r\nfamily, such as the famous Loire castle, for art treasures and thereby\r\nsafeguarded for the Reich very important parts of the world famous\r\nRothschild art collection. The art possessions of the Rothschild's were\r\ntraced not only to cleverly hidden places in the individual castles but\r\nalso to depots and warehouses, as for example in Bordeaux and other\r\ncoastal cities, where these art treasures had already been packed for\r\ntransport to America. In this same manner the art possessions of other\r\nFrench Jews famous as art collectors such as Kann, David-Wlil, Levy\r\nde Benzion and Seligmann were traced by the staff and seized in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\nAfter the seizure of the most famous Jewish art collections in Paris,\r\nall abandoned dwellings of the wealthy Parisian Jews, as well as the\r\nwarehouses of all shipping firms and many other art depots of emigrated\r\nJews, which were very often camouflaged by French gentiles, were\r\nsystematically searched by the special staff for pictorial art and\r\nvery considerable art treasures found in this manner. These seizures\r\nwere carried out on the basis of preliminary exhaustive investigations\r\ninto the address lists of the French police authorities, on the basis\r\nof Jewish handbooks, warehouse inventories and order books for French\r\nshipping firms as well as on the basis of French art and collection\r\ncatalogs. The clearly established Jewish origin of the individual\r\nowners was proved in each case in cooperation with the French police\r\nauthorities and the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service), as well as on\r\nthe basis of the political secure material of the staff itself.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same system, the seizure of ownerless Jewish works\r\nof art was gradually extended over the whole French territory. The\r\ninvestigations of the special staff for pictorial art were often made\r\nextraordinarily difficult by proven sabotage by French authorities,\r\nas well as by camouflaging of Jewish possessions by trusteeship of\r\nFrench gentiles covering up for the Jews. In spite of this, Jewish art\r\npossessions in the occupied French territories was seized to such an\r\nextent as to justify the assumption that, in spite of all opposition\r\nand camouflaging, the most important part of the art possessions which\r\nhad been in the hands of Jews in France, insofar as these had not\r\nalready been removed before the occupation, was safeguarded by the\r\nstaff. _The wholesale removal of irreplaceable European art values was\r\nthereby prevented and the highest artistic products of all European\r\nnations assured for Europe._\r\n\r\nIn the course of this art seizure by the staff in the occupied Western\r\nterritories, the following were seized from 203 locations (collections).\r\n\r\n21903 art objects of all types, as counted and inventoried up to now.\r\n\r\nA seizure record was made for each location, recording the origin of\r\nthe objects with exact individual data. All seized art treasures were\r\nfirst taken to a collection warehouse at the former Jeau de Paume\r\nMuseum and then to rooms of the Louvre which had been placed at their\r\ndisposal. They were scientifically inventoried and photographed by\r\nscientific art workers of the special staff for pictorial art and\r\ncarefully packed there by experts for transport to the Reich. These\r\njobs were especially difficult, since the majority of the collections\r\nand individual art objects were taken over without any inventories or\r\nindications of origin, and the scientific cataloguing had to be carried\r\nout by the scientific art workers of the staff.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 1943, art seizures of the staff have been\r\nextended to include also furniture seizures of the East Ministry,\r\nwhereby a great number of individual valuable art works could be seized\r\nfrom individual dwellings and warehouses.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from March 1941 to July 1944, the special staff for\r\npictorial art brought into the Reich: _29 large shipments_ including\r\n_137 freight cars with 4174 cases of art works_.\r\n\r\nThese shipments were taken to 6 shelters in the Reich, unpacked\r\nand stored with observation of all conservation, air raid and fire\r\nprotection precautions. At the shelters the inventories, which had\r\nserved in Paris only for indentification were supplemented according to\r\nscientific view-points, and the results of the scientific cataloguing\r\nwere recorded on inventory lists and thoroughly indexed. With this\r\nscientific inventory of a material unique in its scope and importance\r\nand of a value hitherto unknown to art research, the special staff\r\nfor pictorial art has conducted a work important to the entire field\r\nof art. _This inventory work will form the basis of an all-inclusive\r\nscientific catalog, in which should be recorded history, scope and\r\nscientific and political significance of this historically unique art\r\nseizure._\r\n\r\nA restoration work shop equipped with all technical aids was\r\nestablished by the special staff at one of the shelters, and has been\r\noccupied with the care and restoration of seized articles of artistic\r\nvalue as well as with their permanent observation at the shelters.\r\nSeveral hundreds of the works of art that had been neglected by their\r\nJewish owners or had earlier been inexpertly restored were restored in\r\nthis workshop and their preservation assured.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all seized articles of artistic value were photographed\r\nby the photography workshop of the special staff and included in a\r\nfilm library. Thereby not only the identity of each individual art\r\nwork was recorded, but also material of permanent value for study and\r\npublication in the field of art was created.\r\n\r\nUp to 15 July 1944 the following had been scientifically inventoried:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _21,903 art works_\r\n\r\n    _5,281 paintings, pastels, water-colors, drawings._\r\n\r\n      _684 miniatures, glass and enamel paintings, books and manuscripts._\r\n\r\n      _583 plastics, terra-cottas, medallions and plaques._\r\n\r\n    _2,477 articles of furniture of value to art history._\r\n\r\n      _583 textiles_ (Gobelins, rugs, embroideries, Coptic materials).\r\n\r\n    _5,825 hand-made art works_ (porcelains, bronze, faiences,\r\n            majolica, ceramics, jewelry, coins, art objects\r\n            made with precious stones).\r\n\r\n    _1,286 East Asiatic art works_ (bronzes, plastics, porcelains,\r\n           paintings, folding screens, weapons).\r\n\r\n       _259 art works of antiquity_ (sculptures, bronzes, vases,\r\n           jewelry, bowls, cut stones, terra-cottas).\r\n\r\nThese figures will be increased, since seizures in the West are not yet\r\ncompleted, and it has not been possible to make a scientific inventory\r\nof part of the seized objects because of the lack of experts.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary artistic and material value of the seized art works\r\ncannot be expressed in figures. The paintings, period furniture of the\r\n17th and 18th centuries, the Gobelins, the antiques and renaissance\r\njewelry of the Rothschilds are objects of such a unique character that\r\ntheir evaluation is impossible, since no comparable values have so far\r\nappeared on the art market.\r\n\r\nA short report, moreover, can only hint at the artistic worth of the\r\ncollection. Among the seized paintings, pastels and drawings there are\r\nseveral hundred works of the first quality, masterpieces of European\r\nart, which could take first place in any museum. Included therein are\r\nabsolutely authenticated signed works of Rembrandt van Rijn, Rubens,\r\nFrans Hals, Vermeer van Delft, Velasquez, Murilio, Goya, Sebastiano del\r\nPiombo, Palma Vecchio, etc.\r\n\r\nOf first importance among the seized paintings are the works of the\r\nfamous French painters of the 18th century, with masterpieces of\r\nBoucher, Watteau, Algaud, Largielliere, Kattier, Fragonard, Pater, D\r\nNloux and de Trcy.\r\n\r\nThis collection can compare with those of the best European museums.\r\nIt includes many works of the foremost French masters, who up to now\r\nhave been only inadequately represented in the best German museums.\r\nVery important also is the representation of masterpieces of the\r\nDutch painters of the 17th and 18th centuries. First of all should be\r\nmentioned the works of van Dyck, Salomon and Jacob Ruisdar Wouvermann,\r\nTerborch, jan Weenix, Gabriel Metsu, Adrian van Ostade, David Teniers,\r\nPieter de Hooch, Willem van der Velde, etc.\r\n\r\nOf foremost importance also are the represented works of English\r\npaintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, with masterpieces of\r\nReynolds, Romney and Gainsborough. Cranach and Amberger, among the\r\nGerman masters, should be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe collection of French furniture of the 17th and 18th centuries is\r\nperhaps even more highly to be evaluated. This contains hundreds of the\r\nbest preserved and, for the most part, signed works of the best known\r\ncabinet-makers from the period between Louis XIV to Louis XVI. Since\r\nGerman cabinet-makers played an important part in this golden age of\r\nFrench cabinetry, now recognized for the first time in the field of\r\nart, this collection is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Gobelins and Persian tapestries contains numerous\r\nworld famous objects. The collection of handicraft works and the\r\nRothschild collection of renaissance jewelry is valuable beyond\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nVery many works of art were seized by the staff from the luggage of\r\nJewish emigrants in Holland as well as in the occupied territories of\r\nFrance and Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Work in the Eastern territories._\r\n\r\nThe activity of the special staff for pictorial art was limited in the\r\noccupied Eastern territories to a scientific and photographic recording\r\nof public collection and their safeguarding and care in cooperation\r\nwith the military and civil services. In the course of the evacuation\r\nof the territory several hundred most valuable Russian Ikons, several\r\nhundred Russian paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, individual\r\narticles of furniture and furniture from castles were saved in\r\ncooperation with the individual army groups, and brought to a shelter\r\nin the Reich.\r\n\r\nA collection of degenerate Bolshevist art, as well as a collection of\r\ndegenerate Western art, was also made for political study purposes. In\r\naddition, a rich collection of material concerning Soviet architecture\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\n25 portfolios of pictures with the most valuable works of the art\r\ncollections seized in the West were presented to the Fuehrer on 20\r\nApril 1943, together with three volumes of a provisional catalog of\r\npaintings and an interim progress report. Additional portfolios of\r\npictures are in preparation.\r\n\r\n  Robert SCHOLZ\r\n  Bereichsleiter\r\n  Chief of the Special Staff for Pictorial Art\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1015-I-PS\r\n\r\n  The Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich\r\n  Berlin W8, 30 May 1942\r\n  Leipziger Str. 3\r\n\r\n  Dear Party member Rosenberg:\r\n\r\nYour Einsatzstab for the seizure of cultural goods in Paris, I believe,\r\nhas been wrongly reported to you as if it were dealing in works of\r\nart itself. I know the task of the Einsatzstab very well and must\r\nassert that there is no agency to which I am able to express such\r\nunrestricted praise for its continued work and readiness as to this\r\nagency proper with all its collaborators. Presumably I have given cause\r\nfor the reputation of dealing in works of art because I have asked some\r\nespecially experienced gentlemen if anywhere during their stay in Paris\r\nor France they should hear of any pictures or other art objects to be\r\nsold by art dealers or private individuals to look at those objects\r\nand to inform me if there should be anything of interest for me. Since\r\nthe latter was often the case, I have then again asked the gentlemen\r\nto do me the favor to acquire the objects for me for which purpose I\r\nhave kept a depot ready for them. If thus some gentlemen got very busy\r\nto make contacts with art dealers it was exclusively a personal favor\r\nwhich was done for me for the benefit of building up my collection.\r\nSince very many prospective buyers endeavor to seize art objects in the\r\noccupied territory, I can well imagine that perhaps out of ignorance of\r\nthe circumstances, but perhaps also out of envy they have caused the\r\ngentlemen of your Einsatzstab to be suspected wrongly.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty to give you this information and to ask you that it\r\nmay remain this way. On the other hand I also support personally the\r\nwork of your Einsatzstab wherever I can do so, and a great part of the\r\nseized cultural goods can be accounted for because I was able to assist\r\nthe Einsatzstab by my organization.\r\n\r\n  With best regards and Heil Hitler!\r\n  Yours\r\n  Signed: Hermann Goering\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1015-GG-PS\r\n\r\n    Statement

Memorandum\r\n\r\n  2.4.41\r\n\r\n  _Subject: The USSR._\r\n\r\nBolshevik Russia, just as the one-time Czarist Russia, is a\r\nconglomeration of peoples of very different types, which has come\r\ninto being through the annexation of states of a related or even of an\r\nessentially alien character.\r\n\r\nA military conflict with the USSR will result in an extraordinarily\r\nrapid occupation of an important and large section of the USSR. It\r\nis very probable that military action on our part will very soon be\r\nfollowed by the military collapse of the USSR. The occupation of these\r\nareas would then present not so many military as administrative and\r\neconomic difficulties. Thus arises the first question:\r\n\r\nIs the occupation to be determined by purely military and/or economic\r\nneeds, or is the laying of political foundations for a future\r\norganization of the area also a factor in determining how far the\r\noccupation shall be extended? If so, it is a matter of urgency to fix\r\nthe _political_ goal which is to be obtained, for it will, without\r\ndoubt, also have an effect on military operations.\r\n\r\nIf the political overthrow of the Eastern Empire, in the weak condition\r\nit would be at the time, is set as the goal of military operations, one\r\nmay conclude that:\r\n\r\n1. The occupation must comprise areas of vast proportions;\r\n\r\n2. From the very beginning, the treatment of individual sections of\r\nterritory should, as regards administration, as well as economics and\r\nideology, be adapted to the political ends we are striving to attain;\r\n\r\n3. Again, extraordinary questions concerning these vast areas, such as,\r\nin particular, the assurance of essential supplies for the continuation\r\nof the war against England, the maintenance of production which this\r\nnecessitates and the general directives for the completely separate\r\nareas, had best be dealt with all in one.\r\n\r\nIt should again be stressed here that, in addition, all the arguments\r\nwhich follow of course only hold good once the supplies from the\r\narea to be occupied, which are essential to Greater Germany for the\r\ncontinuation of the war, has been assured.\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows the East, sees on a map of Russia's population the\r\nfollowing national or geographical units:\r\n\r\na. Greater Russia with Moscow as its centre.\r\n\r\nb. White Russia with Minsk or Smolensk as its capital.\r\n\r\nc. Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\r\n\r\nd. The Ukraine and the Crimea with Kiev as its centre.\r\n\r\ne. The Don area with Rostov as its capital.\r\n\r\nf. The area of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\ng. Russian Central Asia or Russian Turkestan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A. Greater Russia_\r\n\r\nAfter the rule of the Tartars, the Russian Empire, Czarist in\r\ncharacter developed out of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. This nucleus\r\narea possesses even today the greatest driving power. The political\r\naim of operations against the USSR, therefore, would be the permanent\r\nweakening of this area, in order to secure possibilities of expansion\r\nfor the other areas. By means of a temporary occupation of this area,\r\nthis weakening could be brought about in a way comprising the three\r\nfollowing measures:\r\n\r\n1. The total destruction of the Jewish Bolshevik state administration,\r\nwithout helping to set up a new and comprehensive state system;\r\n\r\n2. very extensive utilization of economic resources such as the\r\nremoval of all non-essential stocks, mechanical installations, and, in\r\nparticular, of any available means of transport, small river craft,\r\netc.;\r\n\r\n3. the allocation of considerable sections of this Russian nucleus\r\nterritory to the fresh administrative units which are to be formed, as,\r\nin particular, to White Russia, the Ukraine, and the Don territory.\r\n\r\nIn this way all other areas would be offered at the same time the\r\npossibility of making extensive use of that part of Russia controlled\r\nby Moscow as a dumping ground for undesirable elements of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B. White Russia._\r\n\r\nWhite Russia comprises a part of the USSR which is very backward\r\nculturally as well as economically. At the same time it contains the\r\nsecond largest Jewish community in the USSR, with towns which are\r\ncompletely Jewish, such as Bialystok, Minsk, Polodzk, Vitebsk, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe awakening of an independent life, and the setting up of a living\r\nstate system must be considered as an extremely tedious and difficult\r\nundertaking. White Russia is far more backward in culture than, for\r\ninstance, Lithuania, and more exploited by the Jews than Poland.\r\nNevertheless, having regard to the necessity of weakening the Russian\r\nnucleus area, such an attempt should be advocated.\r\n\r\nThe USSR has confined White Russia to the area between the Polish\r\nNorth-West frontier and approximately as far as the Pronja. But\r\nthe real capital of the whole area would be Smolensk. The half\r\nadministrative district of the same name and also a section of the\r\nadministrative district of Kalinin (formerly Twer) could count,\r\nby population, as belonging to it, or could be added to it for\r\nadministration purposes. In this way the frontier of White Russia\r\nwould be moved forward to within about 250 kilometres of Moscow.\r\n\r\nIf the creation of independent political life is considered desirable,\r\nit would not be advisable to carve up this area to the benefit of the\r\nGeneral-government of Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C. Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania._\r\n\r\nIn the case of these areas the question arises, whether they should be\r\nallotted the special task of becoming a German settlement area of the\r\nfuture, the racially most suitable elements being assimilated.\r\n\r\nIf this is set up as an aim, the areas also require very special\r\ntreatment in the general task.\r\n\r\nThe necessary removal of considerable sections of the intelligentsia\r\nparticularly _Latvian_ ones--to the Russian nucleus area would have\r\nto be organized. The settlement of a German rural population in\r\nconsiderable quantities would have to be started--possibly a large\r\ncontingent of German settlers suitable for this purpose could be taken\r\nfrom among the Volga Germans, after the undesirable elements have been\r\neliminated. There might also be the possibility of the settlements\r\nof Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and--after the war has been brought to a\r\nvictorious end--of Englishmen too, so that, in the course of one or two\r\ngenerations, this area can be joined up with the German nucleus area as\r\na new Germanised country.\r\n\r\nIn this case we should also not have to neglect to deport considerable\r\ngroups of racially inferior sections of the population from Lithuania.\r\n\r\n\r\n_D. The Ukraine (Border territory)._\r\n\r\nKiev became the main centre of the Varangian state with its\r\nsuperimposed Scandinavian character. But even after the rule of the\r\nTartars Kiev was for a long time diametrically opposed to Moscow. Its\r\nindependent national life is based, contrary to the assertions of\r\nMuscovite historians, whose ideas also dominated the whole of European\r\nlearning, on a tradition which is really almost unbroken.\r\n\r\nAs far as this area is concerned, the political task would be the\r\nencouragement of independent national life until, possibly, an\r\nindependent state could be created, with the object, alone or in\r\nconjunction with the Don area and the Caucasus as a _Black Sea Union_,\r\nof holding Moscow constantly in check and ensuring Lebensraum for\r\nGreater Germany to the East. In the economic field, however, this area\r\nwould at the same time, have the task of forming a powerful base for\r\nraw materials and a supplementary nutrition centre for the Greater\r\nGerman Reich.\r\n\r\nStrips of border territory from the Russian nucleus area, too, would\r\nhave to be added to that part which is regarded by the USSR as purely\r\nUkrainian--as has already been mentioned--in order to weaken this\r\nnucleus area and at the same time to keep alive constant opposition to\r\nit. In this matter, parts of the administrative districts of Kursk and\r\nVoronesch might be possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe administrative and economic handling of the whole area would then\r\nhave to be directed towards the attainment of the political aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n_E. The Don Area._\r\n\r\nIt is inhabited by the Don Cossacks. As a nation they are far less\r\nindependent than the Ukrainians, culturally they are saturated with\r\nMoscow ideology, and politically they tend chiefly towards Moscow, but\r\nare more developed than the White Russians. The task in this area would\r\nbe similar to that in White Russia.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it would be desirable to extend this area northwards up\r\nto the Administrative Districts of Szaratow in order to link up its\r\nadministration with that of the territory of the Volga Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_F. The Caucasus._\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus is inhabited by sections of the population which are,\r\nracially, entirely different, and also by national units. The river\r\nplain of the Kuban and Terek, and the present Administrative Districts\r\nof Krasnodar and Ordschjonokidze are inhabited by Cossacks, the\r\nmajority of whom consider themselves to be Ukrainians. The most\r\nadvanced nation as regards culture is the Georgians, between the\r\nGreat and Lesser Caucasus, who can point to a centuries old cultural\r\ntradition and independence of their own. Then comes Aserbeidschan,\r\npeopled by Mussulmen of Ugrotatarian origin, with its centre at Baku.\r\nThe Armenians live in adjacent territory to the South, while the\r\nnorthern mountain slopes are inhabited by quite a number of mountain\r\npeoples of the most varied origins.\r\n\r\nThe area is Russia's oil centre. The material output, and indeed the\r\nexistence of the other mainly agricultural areas of the USSR, such\r\nas the Ukraine, the Don-Kuban, and the Terek district, and also to a\r\ncertain extent the Russian nucleus area, largely depend on keeping this\r\narea in production. Owing to the introduction of the Bolshevik system\r\nof running villages on communal lines without individual ownership, and\r\nof Kolchoses (collective farms), with mechanical cultivation of the\r\nsoil, the production of grain and food depends on the regular supplying\r\nof the necessary fuel. As a result of the sharp drop in the number of\r\ndraught cattle, and the fact that these are, numerically, very unevenly\r\ndistributed, any strangulation of the oil supply--quite apart from the\r\nmaintenance of the motor repair depots and the availability of the\r\nnecessary servicing personnel for this--tends to famine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_G. Russian Central Asia or Russian Turkestan._\r\n\r\nWe can assume that, after the military collapse of the Soviets in\r\nEurope, very small forces would be needed to dispose of the Moscow\r\ntyranny in Central Asia. This area too, is inhabited by peoples of\r\nvery different types, mainly Turano-Mongoloid, and who are followers\r\nof Mohammed. They feel themselves to be in long-standing racial\r\nand religious opposition to the Soviets, and at the same time to\r\nthe Russian people too, without being able, for the time being, to\r\nthrow off the Russian yoke by their own efforts. This should not be\r\nconsidered too difficult to carry out, however, with German help, and\r\nin view of the confusion which would arise among the Soviets.\r\n\r\nThe area is Russia's cotton store, with an annual production, according\r\nto Bolshevik figures, of 400,000-500,000 tons of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe entry of Germans into Central Asia would mean powerful rear support\r\nfor Iran and Afghanistan. It is a matter for conjecture whether these\r\nstates would not possibly be impelled by this means to undertake more\r\nactive operations against India--if there is any such intention--in\r\nthe event of Turkey too, having altered her attitude by that time. The\r\nthreat to the British lines of communication to India thus acquires\r\nreal significance, and will, without doubt, compel Britain to deploy\r\ngreater forces in this area, which she would have to take from Europe\r\nor elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Questions of Economy from the Legal Angle._\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of oil, mainly in the Caucasus, immediately brings with\r\nit the question of its transport, in order to maintain agricultural\r\nproduction in the occupied areas. The question of transport, however,\r\nwhich is of decisive importance to the cultivation of the soil, is\r\nbound up again with settling the coal problem. At the same time, the\r\nquestion of finance in these areas appears of primary importance.\r\n\r\nA question which likewise affects all areas is that of the almost\r\ncomplete abolition, under the Soviet system, of private property. It\r\nis not improbable that this question will have practical consequences\r\nimmediately the area is occupied. Spontaneous action taken by a\r\ncompletely uneducated rural population, if and when they dissolve the\r\nKolchoses by their own efforts, could result in untold material harm.\r\n\r\nFor this reason these problems require to be settled, not regionally,\r\nbut as extraordinary matters for all areas, and local variations, and\r\nperhaps also differing tactical action could easily be combined with\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\nThe following systematic constructional plan is evolved from the points\r\nbriefly outlined here:\r\n\r\n1. the creation of a central department for the occupied areas of the\r\nUSSR, to be confined more or less to wartime.\r\n\r\nWorking in agreement with the higher and supreme Reich authorities, it\r\nwould be the task of this department--\r\n\r\na. to issue binding political instructions to the separate\r\nadministration areas, having in mind the situation existing at the time\r\nand the goal which is to be achieved.\r\n\r\nb. to secure for the Reich supplies essential to the war from all the\r\noccupied areas.\r\n\r\nc. to make preparations for, and to supervise the carrying out, in main\r\noutline, of the primarily important questions for all areas, as for\r\ninstance, those of finance and funds, transport, and the production of\r\noil, coal and food;\r\n\r\n2. the carrying out of sharply defined decentralization in the separate\r\nadministration areas, grouped together by race or by reason of\r\npolitical economy, for the carrying out of the totally dissimilar tasks\r\nassigned to them.\r\n\r\n_As against this, an administrative department, regulating matters\r\nin principle, and to be set up on a purely economic basis, as is at\r\npresent envisaged, might very soon prove to be inadequate, and fail in\r\nits purpose._ Such a central office would be compelled to carry out a\r\ncommon policy for all areas, dictated only by economic considerations,\r\nand this might impede the carrying out of the _political_ task and, in\r\nview of its being run on purely bureaucratic lines, might possibly even\r\nprevent it.\r\n\r\nThe question therefore arises, whether the opinions which have been\r\nset forth should not, purely for reasons of expediency, be taken\r\ninto consideration from the very beginning when organising the\r\nadministration of the territory on a basis of war economy. In view\r\nof the vast spaces and the difficulties of administration which arise\r\nfrom that alone, and also in view of the living conditions created by\r\nBolshevism, which are totally different from those of Western Europe,\r\nthe whole question of the USSR would require different treatment from\r\nthat which has been applied in the individual countries of Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n  2.4.41\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1019-PS\r\n\r\n  Appendix to Memorandum No. 2\r\n\r\n Recommendations as to the personnel for the Reich Commissariats in the\r\n East and for the Political Central Office in Berlin\r\n\r\n  [Found in Rosenberg's files.]\r\n\r\nSurveying the requirements in regard to personnel as a whole, the\r\nfollowing considerations must be taken into account. On psychological\r\nand historical grounds it would not appear politic to put the immediate\r\npolitical direction of the Baltic Provinces into the hands of the\r\nBalts. Although it must be admitted that they know the conditions best\r\nand also know the languages, so many historical memories and complexes\r\nare involved, that it would appear inexpedient if we are to attain our\r\nfinal political goal to allow people who formerly had dealings with the\r\nEstonians, Latvians and Lithuanians once more to appear politically\r\nin positions of authority. On the other hand, it is necessary to\r\nsend people to these parts who are intimately acquainted with the\r\nproblems of the East and North and are also able, from the point of\r\nview of temperament to bring a particular understanding to bear on\r\nthe situation there. When, in addition, there are still interests in\r\nconnection with Scandinavia and Finland, indeed altogether a Hanseatic\r\ntrend, then in the opinion of the undersigned, such persons would be\r\nmost suited for the political direction of the Eastern Provinces. On\r\nthese grounds the undersigned suggests the following to the Fuehrer: As\r\nReich Commissar for the Baltic Provinces and White Russia: Gauleiter\r\nHinrich Lohse, Kiel. Headquarters: _Riga_.\r\n\r\nFurther positions to be filled: a Reich Commissariat for the Ukraine,\r\na Reich Commissariat for the Caucasus and a Reich Commissariat for the\r\nDon and Volga Areas. Here also it would appear necessary to entrust\r\nthis task to people who already have a previous knowledge of the\r\nRussian, Ukrainian and Caucasus problems, who have been in contact\r\nwith the country and people, and if it is at all possible, who speak\r\nRussian, the language with which one can make oneself generally\r\nunderstood there. The undersigned suggests to the Fuehrer as Reich\r\nCommissar for the Ukraine and Caucasus, as they may be suitable:\r\nSecretary of State Backe and Stabsleiter Arno Schickedanz. Party\r\nmember Backe himself comes from the Caucasus and will quickly be\r\nable to acquaint himself with the conditions, speaks fluent Russian\r\nand has never quite broken off his connections with the Caucasus.\r\nPg. Schickedanz has been working in the Russian sphere for 20 years,\r\nformerly with Dr. Scheubner-Richter and then with the undersigned. He\r\nhelped the latter with politically cautious advice, particularly in\r\nconnection with Norway. He knows many of the people concerned with\r\nRussia, the Ukraine and the Caucasus so that he appears suitable\r\nfor one of these posts, in order to survey the political situation\r\ncorrectly and serve the political aims for which we are to strive. If\r\nthe undersigned could make a choice for this recommendation, he would\r\nname Backe for the Caucasus and Schickedanz for the Ukraine. As second\r\nin command to the Reich Commissar in the Caucasus, the Commissioner for\r\nthe 4 year plan would have to name someone to lead an authoritative Oil\r\nCommission. For the Ukraine an agricultural department of particularly\r\ncapable men would have to be established. Headquarters of the Reich\r\nCommissariats would be _Kijew_ and _Tiflis_.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister D. Klagges is recommended as Reich Commissar for the\r\nDon-Volga Area. As a result of his initiative in connection with the\r\nestablishment of the Hermann-Goering Works in Salzgitter he knows the\r\nproblems of mining and as Prime Minister of Brunswick he has collected\r\nall the administrative experience. At the moment the undersigned can\r\ncall to mind no one else who speaks _Russian_. Headquarters of the\r\nReich Commissar: _Rostov_ on Don.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it will eventually become necessary to occupy with troops\r\nnot only Petersburg, but also Moscow. This occupation will definitely\r\ndiffer considerably from that in the Baltic provinces, in the Ukraine\r\nand in the Caucasus. It will be accomplished by suppressing any Russian\r\nand Bolshevik resistance and will necessitate an absolutely ruthless\r\nperson, both as regards the military representation and also the\r\n_eventual_ political direction. The problems arising from this need\r\nnot be detailed here. If it is not intended to maintain a permanent\r\nmilitary administration, the undersigned would recommend the Gauleiter\r\nof East Prussia, Erich Koch as Reich Commissar in _Moscow_.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the problems as a whole shows that in order to\r\novercome them a _Central_ Office to direct the work of the various\r\nReich Commissariats is urgently necessary. First of all in order to\r\nrelieve the Fuehrer, so that he does not have to deal continuously with\r\nfour or five Administrative Offices in the East, and secondly since\r\nit is necessary, from an authoritative and political point of view,\r\nfor all these areas to be surveyed and supervised by _one_ office, and\r\nfor the tasks allotted to be carried out in the manner desired by the\r\nFuehrer by means of directives to the personalities in charge. The\r\nFuehrer instructed the undersigned, on 2nd April 1941, to establish a\r\ncentral political office to deal with work in the East in anticipation\r\nof the eventuality mentioned in the introduction to this memorandum.\r\nBearing in mind the political aims described above, the most important\r\ntask of such a central political office, immediately subordinate to\r\nthe Fuehrer, would be the adaptation or actual preparation of suitable\r\nleaflets, as the first proclamation of the Military Commander. It\r\nwould then have to take care that all proclamations and decrees\r\nissued later by the political directors of the Occupied Territories\r\nconform to the varied aims, that measures resulting from this central\r\nattitude, both cultural and economic, are in agreement with these,\r\nthat mistakes which do not correspond to the political intention are,\r\nif possible, avoided or, if they have already occurred, remedied\r\nin a sensible manner. Furthermore the office would have the task\r\nof writing and editing the necessary enlightening articles on the\r\nhistory and relations with Germany of the various territories, or of\r\nfinding collaborators who can write them. It would also be a good\r\nthing to have translations made of those articles and speeches which\r\ncan be shown to have expressed a German-Ukrainian solution in the\r\ncourse of the national-socialist struggle. Scientific literature on\r\nthis subject has been in preparation by colleagues of the undersigned\r\nfor a considerable time. A basic work has been published (\"Um die\r\nNeugestalt Europas\"--\"The Changed Face of Europe,\" Central Party\r\nPublishers), a new book is in preparation and extensive research on\r\nthe whole continental European question is well under way. In addition\r\nspeeches must be composed in German, Ukrainian, Georgian etc., to be\r\nmade into gramophone records. A large number of loudspeaker cars must\r\nbe available in view of the widespread illiteracy still existing. In\r\naddition this Central Office would already have to have such authority,\r\nthat the most efficient of the top-ranking Reich Authorities concerned,\r\nof the O.K.W. as well as the authorities controlling the 4 year Plan\r\nwould be at the disposal of its chief, so that all future measures\r\nnecessary for the realization of our political goals, political,\r\neconomic, cultural, scientific and propaganda, may be instituted even\r\nnow in such a way as to further these central ideas. Only by such a\r\ncentral direction of _basic_, decisive orders will it be possible\r\nto avoid confusion later on and will the enormous difficulties and\r\nmisunderstandings unavoidably connected with the occupation of almost\r\ndevastated areas be reduced to the minimum. The undersigned therefore\r\nmakes the suggestion to the Fuehrer that _when the eventuality arises_\r\nthis Central _Office_, which is fully empowered and is to be set up,\r\nshould be changed into a component authority immediately subordinate to\r\nthe Fuehrer, i.e.--in order to avoid a repetition of existing official\r\ndesignations--into a General Protectorate for the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories with its seat in Berlin. The Head of this Protectorate\r\ncould then obtain the official designation of \"The Protector-General\r\nof the German Reich for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\" (The name\r\nCommissar-General is already in use, e.g. as the subordinate of the\r\nReich Commissar in Holland.) The Fuehrer would then nominate and recall\r\nthe Reich Commissar for the Baltic Provinces, the Ukraine, Caucasia\r\nand the Don-Volga area (eventually Moscow and Turkestan) on the\r\nrecommendation of the Protector-General. The official communications\r\nof all top-ranking Reich Authorities to the Reich Commissariats in the\r\noccupied territories would go through the Protectorate-General, whereby\r\nall technical, economic, etc., directions would be issued entirely\r\nauthoritatively by the top-ranking Reich officials in question. It is\r\ntherefore _not_ necessary to found a new large Reich Office, but rather\r\na political _centre_ for the East provided with all necessary powers,\r\nin combination with an Inspectorate and State Secretariat to control\r\nall questions concerning the connection between the Protector-General\r\nand the Reich Commissariats and top-ranking Reich Authorities. Should\r\nthe Fuehrer agree to the proposal to alter the political central\r\noffice, which is to be established shortly and with whose direction\r\nthe undersigned is charged, when the eventuality arises into a General\r\nprotectorate under the same direction, then the undersigned recommends\r\nGauleiter Dr. Meyer of Munster as Secretary of State. Dr. Meyer is an\r\nold national-socialist fighter who sees the political problems clearly\r\nand from a national-socialist point of view. He has occupied himself so\r\nexhaustively in the last few years with State Law and administrative\r\nmeasures, that he can also carry out this work in addition to his\r\nburdensome work as Gauleiter. It is clear that from Dr. Meyer\r\nextraordinary service would be asked, but on the other hand he would\r\ncertainly consider such an appointment a particular honour.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has already granted to the undersigned the budget for a\r\ncentral office. If the Fuehrer approves the above trains of thought and\r\nproposals, as they are or in modified form, they could be set in motion\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, the 7th April, 1941\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1024-PS\r\n\r\n  29 April 1941\r\n\r\n General organization and tasks of our office for the general handling\r\n of problems in the Eastern territories\r\n\r\nThe Chief of this office under whom a personal expert plus the\r\nnecessary office staff is to be placed, is to be assisted in\r\nall general problems of the office by his permanently assigned\r\nrepresentative (Gauleiter Dr. Meyer). The permanent representative\r\nheads a main office which organizes the whole interior service as well\r\nas a number of departments which have to work on special problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Political department._\r\n\r\nThis department is charged with the task of further working out the\r\nstaked-out political goals in the several projected _five areas_, and\r\nto sum up the historical reasons for the new partitioning of the whole\r\neast European area. It must result from this work, that the proposed\r\ndistrict shall not be of a haphazard nature, but are due rather to the\r\nhistorical and national developments, and thus represent a political\r\nnecessity for the future. The substantial treatment of those problems\r\nis closely connected with the history and nature of the several\r\n_nationalities_ in the East, which also will have to be treated. To\r\nthis is to be added the appraisal of the individualisms of these\r\nnationalities which live within or out of Europe for the purpose of a\r\nlater outside commitment in the projected administrative districts.\r\n\r\nA general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for which a\r\ntemporary solution will have to be determined (forced labor for the\r\nJews, creation of Ghettos, etc.) The church problems of the whole East\r\nare of a varying nature (character) and require an intensive treatment\r\nin relation to the past, to the now existing laws and to the interested\r\nfuture relationship.\r\n\r\nWhile the work itself is being done, there will arise a great number\r\nof special problems out of the whole of the general problems. With\r\nthe present state of the work, one should not anticipate the special\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nRank of the Chief and his representative: Ministerialdirector\r\nand Ministerialdirigent. Proposed as the Chief of this office:\r\nReichsamtleiter Dr. Georg Leibbrandt. His representative: Consul\r\ngeneral Dr. Brautigam.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Economic-Political Coordination._\r\n\r\nUntil further final decisions have been reached about the substantial\r\ntreatment of economy, technics, traffic, postal service, highway\r\ndept., labor service, this dept. has no immediate pertinent tasks\r\nto solve, such as the political dept. The main task of the dept. of\r\neconomic-political coordination will consist rather of coordinating\r\nthe different above mentioned territories in their demands and their\r\nutilization so that the known political goal can be attained as quickly\r\nas possible in the five large districts by the use of the psychological\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThe top priority of the demands of the occupational force is the\r\nassured supplying of the Germans with raw materials and food. In the\r\nlong run in certain districts this goal may be attained with less\r\nforce, through an understanding, special treatment of the individual\r\nnationalities rather than by this national and political situation, the\r\nsolution of this problem is forced by means of the military or police\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of this dept. of economic-political coordination will have\r\nthe task to coordinate the orders of the plenipotentiary of the Four\r\nYear Plan with the wishes of the economical and financial resources by\r\ncooperation with the representatives of the highway dept. and labor\r\ndept. in order to assure the utmost safety and by using the existing\r\nfiles of the people who know Russia to secure the biggest possible\r\nassistance in all these economic-political necessities. Connected with\r\nthis is the contingency of all the desired amounts of raw materials and\r\nfood, namely in this respect that those districts, in which a political\r\nautonomy and a lasting cooperation is projected are to be considered\r\nmore than other ones for which such a possibility does not seem\r\nindicated for the future. One must proceed in the same way to solve the\r\ncurrency question. After a certain period of transition, it must be\r\ndecided where national currency issuing banks will have to be created\r\nin connection with the overall, political solution, and where this is\r\nnot deemed necessary. The same holds true for postage stamps and other\r\nquestions, which will arise in concrete forms, in connection with the\r\ncourse of this work.\r\n\r\nAccording to the decisions of the Reichsmarshall, the economy is to\r\nbe coordinated under the authority of one person. Consequently, the\r\nrepresentatives of the brands for food, the currency and financial\r\nquestions, the industrial economy and the question of utilization of\r\nlabor are subordinated to the plenipotentiary for the whole economy.\r\nTherefore, the Deputy of the Four-year plan represents all of the\r\neconomic branch in discussion about economic-political coordination,\r\nwhile the representatives of the other mentioned depts. will enter\r\nthe conferences under his direction. In other words the head of the\r\ndepartment of economic-political coordination has to bring about a\r\ncombination [Gesamtheit] with the political goal of\r\n\r\n  1. Safeguarding of the German War Effort and supplies.\r\n\r\n  2. Attaining of political goals in the East.\r\n\r\nThe conferences will take place, if necessary, under the leadership of\r\nthe permanent representative of the Chief, or in the form of a round\r\ntable discussion of the participants under the presidency of the head\r\nof the economic-political coordination dept.\r\n\r\n Position (Rank): Ministerialdirector. Representative:\r\n Ministerialdirigent.\r\n\r\nProposed as the head of the Dept. for economical-political\r\ncoordination: Reichsamtleiter Walter Malletke. Representative\r\nReichshamptstellenleiter Hermann Freiherr von Harder. In addition,\r\na small number of permanent assistants and the necessary office are\r\nenvisaged.\r\n\r\nThe supreme headquarters of the Armed Forces has appointed as\r\nrepresentative to the director of this office the Chief of the\r\nArmed Forces operational staff [Wehrmachts fuehrungstab] General\r\nof the Artillery Jodl, and as his representative Brigadier General\r\nWarlimont. General Jodl or Brig. Gen. Warlimont are to be included in\r\nconferences of the political dept. and the dept. of economic-political\r\ncoordination, held under the chairmanship of the director or his\r\nrepresentative, during which military matters are being discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Legal Dept._\r\n\r\nIt is the task of the Legal Dept. to prepare those drafts for\r\nlaws which are deemed necessary for the governing of the Eastern\r\nterritories, with due consideration to general directives of the\r\ndirector or his representative. If called for, a representative of the\r\nLegal Dept. is to sit in on the conferences of the Political Dept. and\r\nthe dept. of economic-political-coordination in order to keep abreast\r\nwith the problem arising from this subject matter and accordingly to\r\nmake the draft for the necessary decrees or, otherwise, to formulate\r\nthe presented drafts of the various depts. in accordance with the\r\ngeneral goals and future constitutional demands. The ordinances for\r\nthe execution of the decrees of the director of the office are to\r\nbe agreed upon in advance with the head of the Legal Dept; these\r\n(decrees) are to be brought before the representative of the director\r\nin case no argument can be reached. Rank of the head of the dept:\r\nMinisterialdirector. Representative: Ministerialdirigent. Proposed\r\nfor the job; proposal is asked of the Reichsminister and Chief of the\r\nChancellory. Experts of the constitutional conditions in the East\r\nshould be consulted as advisors, first of all Staatsrat Freiherr von\r\nFreitagh Lorringhoven (other proposal: Regierungspresident Dr. Runte\r\nfrom Brusberg.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Dept. for Culture and Science._\r\n\r\nThe work of this dept. does not seem as pressing as the political,\r\neconomic-political and legal-political problems. However, now is the\r\ntime to project the installation of these cultural and educational\r\ninstitutions for those territories that are in need of special care\r\non the part of Germany. The task would be to further those national\r\nsciences and history of literature and universities which conform\r\nwith the political goal. Rank of the director: Ministerialdirector.\r\nRepresentative: Ministerialdirigent. The director has not been proposed\r\nas yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Enlightenment and Press._\r\n\r\nIt is the task of this dept. in an active manner, to publicize the\r\nsubstantially worked out decision of the several depts. for all of\r\nthose circles for which these decisions are meant. Furthermore, to\r\nmaintain the entire connections with the Reichs ministry for the\r\nEnlightenment of the People and Propaganda and to employ the facilities\r\nof this ministry in the fields of radio, public address systems, films,\r\netc., in order to obtain the political goals in the Eastern European\r\narea. Furthermore, the enlightenment of the whole German people and the\r\narmy is to be promoted in such a way as is deemed necessary by the hand\r\nof this office. During press conferences, the representative of the\r\ndept. for enlightenment and press has to acquaint Germany's newspapers\r\nand magazines with the necessary instructions, and to make statements\r\nfor the foreign press, if deemed necessary. This task to be carried\r\nout in agreement with the Chief of the German press. It is furthermore\r\nthe task of the head of this dept. to establish the fastest possible\r\nconnection for communication between the main office and the future\r\nadministrative offices of the Eastern European area. The additional\r\ninfluence upon the foreign nationalities should be the presentation\r\nof the aims of National Socialist Germany, given in the individual\r\nlanguages of the various people.\r\n\r\nRank of the head of the dept.: Ministerial-director. Representative:\r\nMinisterialdirigent. A number of necessary officials and expert and\r\nusual staff. Proposed; General commissioner Fritz Schmidt den Haag.\r\nExperts Dr. Karl Neuscheler, at the present in Meuskan, and Dr. Gamber,\r\nat present in Belgrad (DNB). At present further necessities cannot\r\nbe foreseen and if necessary an enlargement upon the work will be\r\ncontemplated with new demands.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the Fuehrer is to be contacted (asked) whether\r\nor not he desires to be represented at the director of the dept.,\r\nor his representative. Furthermore, it is deemed necessary that the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German police appoints a permanent\r\nrepresentative to this office with whom administrative decrees\r\nconcerning safeguarding by police forces are to be discussed. The\r\nrepresentative of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police\r\ncan be consulted in all conferences pertaining to the security of the\r\nEastern territories.\r\n\r\nThe Reichs commissioner for the solidification of the Germanic National\r\nCharacteristic will also appoint his representative, who, at the\r\nproper time, will take over the task on orders of the head of the\r\nadministrative district, the tasks in those administrative districts\r\nwhere this employment is deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Communications to the Administrative districts in the East_\r\n\r\nEach administrative district in the Eastern European area will\r\nestablish a representative in Berlin, which is to be immediately\r\nsubordinated to the permanent representative of the director of the\r\noffice. These representatives have the task to regulate all questions\r\nof entering and knowing their respective areas and to receive and work\r\nout all wishes of the various Reichs Offices of party and state, which\r\npertain to the represented administrative areas.\r\n\r\nThe directives to the heads of the administrative districts will\r\noriginate only from the head of the office. This representative will\r\ntend all the other pending negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe administrative districts in the East European areas will be\r\norganized according to the needs of the main office, so that in\r\ngeneral, one section of the office in Berlin corresponds to an office\r\nin the administrative districts. This is a process through which will\r\nrequire a much higher specialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1028-PS\r\n\r\n  [Memorandum from Rosenberg file, 7 May 1941]\r\n\r\n  [Translation of Only Typewritten Material]\r\n\r\nAfter the customary removal of Jews from all public offices, the Jewish\r\nquestion will have to have a decisive solution, through the institution\r\nof Ghettos. Insofar as the Jews have not been driven out by the\r\nUkrainians themselves, the small communities must be lodged in large\r\ncamps, in order to be kept busy by means of forced labor, in the same\r\nway as it has already been the practice in Letzmanorstadt (Lodz).\r\n\r\n  [Translation of paragraph, excluding all crossed out words.]\r\n\r\nAfter the customary removal of Jews from all public offices, the\r\nJewish question will have to undergo a decisive solution through the\r\ninstitution of ghettos or labor battalions. Forced labor is to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1029-PS\r\n\r\n Instruction for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries and White\r\n Russia [Ostland]\r\n\r\n  [Found in Rosenberg's files.]\r\n\r\nAll the regions between Narwa and Tilsit have constantly been in close\r\nrelationship with the German people. A 700-year-old history has moulded\r\nthe inner sympathies of the majority of the races living there in a\r\nEuropean direction, and has added this region to the living space of\r\nGreater Germany.\r\n\r\nThe aim of a Reich Commissar for Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania and White\r\nRussia [last two words added in pencil] must be to strive to achieve\r\nthe form of a German Protectorate, and then transform the region into\r\npart of the Greater German Reich by germanising racially possible\r\nelements, colonising Germanic races and banishing undesirable elements.\r\nThe Baltic Sea must become a Germanic inland sea under the guardianship\r\nof Greater Germany.\r\n\r\nFor certain cattle-raising products, the Baltic region was a land of\r\nsurplus, and the Reich Commissar must endeavor to make this surplus\r\nonce more available to the German people, and, if possible, to\r\nincrease it. With regard to the process of germanising or resettling,\r\nthe Esthonian people are strongly germanised to the extent of 50%\r\nby Danish, German and Swedish blood and can be considered as a\r\nkindred nation. In Latvia, the section capable of being assimilated\r\nis considerably smaller than in Esthonia. In this country, stronger\r\nresistance will have to be reckoned with, and banishment on a larger\r\nscale will have to be envisaged. A similar development may have to\r\nbe reckoned with in Lithuania, for here too the emigration of racial\r\nGermans is called for in order to promote very intensive Germanisation\r\n(on the East Prussian border).\r\n\r\nWhite Russia is directly joined to these three territories. For a long\r\ntime, White Russia had a strong Separatist movement, but presumably\r\nBolshevist has succeeded in suppressing it. In any case, White Russia\r\nwill first of all have the difficult task of admitting some of those\r\nelements who are expelled from Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania and from\r\nthe Polish section of the Warthe territory. It seems expedient not to\r\naccommodate the Poles in the General gouvernement but in the East of\r\nWhite Russia (Smolensk District) and to form there a buffer against\r\nRussianism. In addition, the Commissar-General in White Russia would\r\nhave the task of rousing this country, which cannot be considered as a\r\nland of surplus, to productive activity by employment of labour on a\r\nvast scale. [Marginal note in pencil: Every autonomous White Russian\r\nawareness against Russia is to be encouraged.]\r\n\r\nThe task of a Reich Commissar with his seat of office in Riga will\r\ntherefore largely be an extraordinarily _positive_ one. A country\r\nwhich 700 years ago was captured by German Knights, built up by the\r\nHanseatic League, and by reason of a constant influx of German blood,\r\ntogether with Swedish elements, was a predominantly Germanised land,\r\nis to be established as a mighty German borderland. The preliminary\r\ncultural conditions are available everywhere, and the German Reich will\r\nbe able to guarantee the right to a later emigration to all those who\r\nhave distinguished themselves in this war, to the descendants of those\r\nwho gave their lives during the war, and also to all who fought in the\r\nBaltic campaign, never once lost courage, fought on in the hour of\r\ndespair and delivered Baltic civilisation from Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the solution of the colonisation problem is not a Baltic\r\nquestion, but one which concerns Greater Germany, and it must be\r\nsettled on these lines.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissar, together with the other Reich Commissars, must\r\nstrive to introduce the improvement of water-way communication between\r\nthe Black Sea and the Baltic, i.e., start the construction of the\r\nDuena-Dnieper Canal. In this way the circulation of a great European\r\neconomic system can be completed, which will guarantee the future\r\nexchange of goods, and render it independent of any overseas blockade.\r\nThus the Reich Commissar in the Baltic lands will have great problems\r\nto solve in the realm of economics, and particularly in the domain of\r\nracial politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1030-PS\r\n\r\n  8th May 41\r\n\r\n General Instructions for all Reichcommisars in the occupied Eastern\r\n Territories\r\n\r\n  [Found in Rosenberg's files.]\r\n\r\nThe contingency, that the German Reich may find herself confronted by\r\nSoviet Russian policy of aggression and of anti-German alliances, makes\r\nit obligatory to have a clear conception about the political aims of a\r\nGerman counterblow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only possible political goal of war can be the aim to free the\r\nGerman Reich from Pan-Slavic [Grossrussisch] pressure for centuries to\r\ncome. This does not only correspond with German interests, but also\r\nwith historical justice, for Russian Imperialism was in a position to\r\naccomplish its policy of conquest and oppression almost unopposed,\r\nwhilst it threatened Germany again and again. Therefore, the German\r\nReich has to beware of starting a campaign against Russia with a\r\nhistorical injustice, meaning the reconstruction of a Great Russian\r\nEmpire, no matter of what kind. On the contrary, all historical\r\nstruggles of the various nationalities against Moscow and Petersburg\r\nhave to be scrutinized for their bearing on the situation today.\r\nThis has been done on the part of the National Socialist movement to\r\ncorrespond to the Leader's political testament as laid down in his\r\nbook, that now the military and political threat, from the East shall\r\nbe eliminated forever.\r\n\r\nTherefore this huge area must be divided according to its historical\r\nand racial conditions into Reichs-Commissariats, each of which bears\r\nwithin itself a different political aim. The Reich Commissariat\r\nEastland including White-Ruthenia will have the task, to prepare, by\r\nway of development into a Germanized Protectorate, a progressively\r\ncloser cohesion with Germany. The Ukraine shall become an independent\r\nstate in alliance with Germany and Caucasia with the contiguous\r\nNorthern Territories a Federal State with a German plenipotentiary.\r\nRussia proper must put her own house in order for the future. These\r\ngeneral viewpoints are explained in the following instructions for\r\neach Reich Commissar. Beyond that there are still a few general\r\nconsiderations which possess validity for all Reich Commissars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs far as currency policy is concerned, a transitional state similar\r\nto that in other occupied territories shall be provided for, but with\r\nan early beginning of a new orientation, which has to correspond to\r\nthe political goal to be achieved. In the Reich Commissariat Eastland,\r\nwe will have to introduce as currency German marks, in the Reich\r\nCommissariat Ukraine a national \"Karbowanez\" currency (Ukrainian\r\nNational bank), in the Reich Commissariat Caucasia a national currency\r\ntoo for the future Federal State.\r\n\r\nThe German people have achieved, in course of centuries, tremendous\r\naccomplishments in the Eastern European area. Nearly its entire real\r\nestate property was confiscated without indemnification, hundreds of\r\nthousands (in the South, on the Volga) starved or were deported or,\r\nlike in the Baltic territories, were cheated out of the fruits of their\r\ncultural work during the past 700 years. The German Reich will now have\r\nto proclaim the principle, that after the occupation of the Eastern\r\nTerritories, the former German assets have become property of the\r\npeople of Greater Germany, irrespective of the consent of the former\r\nindividual proprietors where the German Reich may reserve the right\r\n(assuming that it has not already been done during resettlement) to\r\narrange a just settlement. The manner of compensation and restitution\r\nof this national property, will be subject to different treatment by\r\neach Reich Commissariat.\r\n\r\nThe moment for declarations of this kind will be determined by the\r\nReich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern territories. [This sentence was\r\nadded in pencil]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of cultural policy, the German Reich is in a\r\nposition to promote and direct national culture and science in many\r\nfields. It will be necessary, that in some territories an uprooting and\r\nresettlement of various racial stocks will have to be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1034-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Rosenberg Chancellery\r\n  Received 22nd June 1941 No. 059\r\n\r\n  Construction and Administration\r\n\r\nMinutes of a discussion with Reichsleiter Rosenberg on Saturday 21st\r\nJune 1941 from 1100-1200 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Present: Reichsleiter Rosenberg\r\n  Gauleiter Dr. Meyer (at the beginning of the discussion)\r\n  Landeshauptmann Kolbow\r\n  Oberregierungsrat Dr. Albrecht\r\n  Brigadefuehrer Girgenson\r\n  Burgkommandant Gohdes\r\n  Reichsamtsleiter Dr. Leibbrandt\r\n  Landespraesident Dreier\r\n\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg asked how many men in all had so far been\r\nmade available for employment in the East--Brigadefuehrer Girgenson\r\nand Party Member Gohdes stated that the German Labour Front was\r\nwilling to provide 261 Regional Commissioners and the Storm Troops\r\n144. Oberregierungsrat Dr. Albrecht informed him that the Reich\r\nMinister of the Interior would provide about 450 officials as Regional\r\nCommissioners--that would still leave 200 positions as Regional\r\nCommissioners to be filled, and these should, as far as possible, be\r\noccupied by personnel from the Schubert staff.\r\n\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg expressed his willingness to take over\r\npolitically suitable individuals from the ranks of these specialists.\r\nTherefore immediate contact should be made with General Schubert\r\nand the Quartermaster General. An order to this effect was given to\r\nOberregierungsrat Dr. Albrecht--Burgkommandant Gohdes wished to ensure\r\nthat considerable reserves of men in a state of operational readiness\r\nshould be held at our disposal in the Reich, to provide for unavoidable\r\nchanges in the theatre of operations.\r\n\r\nGauleiter Dr. Meyer thereupon declared that most of the personnel\r\njust mentioned would only be made available gradually, since most of\r\nthem would first have to be released from the Armed Forces. It was\r\nimportant that lists of the individuals actually available should be\r\nmade immediately, and that these persons should be placed together in\r\nSpecial Purpose Staffs. Then the question was cleared up as to who was\r\nto be responsible to the Reichsleiter for the concentration of the\r\nStaffs. Decision: Burgkommandant Gohdes, S.A.--Brigadefuehrer Girgenson\r\nand Oberregierungsrat Dr. Albrecht, each of whom made personal\r\nsuggestions for his own section, would have to deliberate together\r\non the persons who were to form the different Staffs and submit the\r\nresult of their deliberations to Landespraesident Dreier, who was\r\nresponsible for this. The political section (Dr. Leibbrandt) would\r\nadvise Landespraesident Dreier on the subject. It was clear, that\r\nLandespraesident Dreier was the Head of the Department in whose hands\r\nlay the sole and final responsibility for the composition of the Staffs.\r\n\r\nBurgkommandant Gohdes undertook to arm the men to be appointed, and to\r\ngive them the firing instruction which might be necessary.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of putting the commissioners to be\r\nemployed into uniform, Dr. Rosenberg stated that the organizations\r\ndid not wish to give up their own (field-grey) uniforms and badges.\r\nThe general opinion was that it was impossible for German government\r\nofficials to enter the Eastern territories in different uniforms;\r\nalso, the field-grey colour, in which the Armed Forces in the East\r\nwould have provoked awe and respect for the German people, was held to\r\nbe indispensable for the successful carrying-out of their government\r\nfunctions. Party Member Gohdes said that Reichsorganisationsleiter\r\nDr. Ley recommended the creation of a new unitary uniform for the\r\nCommissioners serving in the East. The Armed Forces were willing to set\r\naside dark-brown cloth for 5,000 uniforms. Reichsleiter Rosenberg took\r\nit upon himself personally to submit the question of supplying uniform\r\nto the decision of the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nArising from the question of supplying uniform, it was then discussed\r\nwhether a special \"Ostfuehrers Corps\" as an organization of the\r\nNational-Socialist Party should be created. An organization of this\r\nkind would then not only have the right to wear a unitary uniform, but\r\nit would imbue its members with the esprit de corps which was necessary\r\nfor the fulfillment of the tasks which were to be carried out in the\r\nEast. If the German was to enter the Eastern territory as master, he\r\nmust be moulded as a unit both inwardly and outwardly. This inner\r\nregimental training could exert a certain positive counter-effect above\r\nall against the moral danger of \"Space-Experience\" and the depressing\r\neffect of foreign nationality. When this subject had been further\r\ndiscussed, it seemed more urgent than ever to achieve the purpose of\r\ncreating an Ostfuehrer-Corps of this kind which would be a unit in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1039-PS\r\n\r\n Report on the Preparatory Work in Eastern European Questions\r\n\r\n  [Found in Rosenberg's files.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the notification of individual Supreme Reich\r\noffices regarding the Fuehrer's decree of 20.4. 1941 a conference\r\nwith the chief of the OKW (armed forces high command) took place.\r\nAfter presentation of the various political aims in the proposed\r\nReichskommissariats and presentation of personal requirements for the\r\nEast, the chief of the OKW explained that a deferment [UK-stellung]\r\nwould be too complicated in this case and that this matter could be\r\ncarried out best by direct cancellation [Abkommandierung] by command\r\nof the chief of the OKW Generalfeldmarschall Keitel. Then issued\r\nan appropriate command which established the basis for the coming\r\nrequirements. He named as deputy and liaison officer General Jodl and\r\nMaj. Gen. Warlimont. The negotiations which then commenced relative\r\nto all questions of the Eastern Territory were carried on by the\r\ngentlemen of the OKW in collaboration with officials of my office. A\r\nconference took place with Admiral Canaris to the effect that under the\r\ngiven confidential circumstances my office could in no way deal with\r\nany representatives of the people of the East-European area. I asked\r\nhim to do this insofar as the military intelligence required it, and\r\nthen to name persons to me who could count as political personalities\r\nover and above the military intelligence in order to arrange for their\r\neventual commitment later. Admiral Canaris said that naturally also my\r\nwish not to recognize any political groups among the emigrants would\r\nbe considered by him and that he was planning to proceed in accordance\r\nwith my indications.\r\n\r\nLater on I informed Generalfeldmarschall von Brauchitsch and\r\nGrossadmiral Raeder about the historical and political conceptions\r\nof the Eastern problem. In further conferences we agreed to appoint\r\na representative of my office to the Supreme commander of the Army,\r\nrespectively to the chief quartermaster and to the army groups for\r\nquestions relative to political configuration and requests of the OKW.\r\nIn the meantime this has been done.\r\n\r\nAlready at the outset there was a discussion with Minister of Economy\r\n[Reichswirtschaftsminister] Funk, who appointed as his permanent\r\ndeputy Ministerialdirektor Dr. Schlotterer. Almost daily conferences\r\nwere then held with Dr. Schlotterer with reference to the war economic\r\nintentions of the Economic Operational Staff [Wirtschaftsfuehrungsstab]\r\nEast. In this connection I had conferences with General Thomas,\r\nState Secretary [Staatssekretaer] Koerner, State Secretary Backe,\r\nMinisterial Director Riecke, General Schubert and others. Far-reaching\r\nagreement was reached in the Eastern questions as regards direct\r\ntechnical work now and in the future. A few problems regarding the\r\nrelationship of the proposed Reich ministry toward the four-year plan\r\nare still open and will be subject, after submission, to a decision\r\nof the Fuehrer. In principle I declared that I in no way intended to\r\nfound an economic department in my office, economics would rather be\r\nhandled substantially and practically by the Reichsmarschall and the\r\npersons appointed by him, however the two responsible department heads,\r\nnamely Ministerial Director Dr. Schlotterer for industrial economics\r\nand Ministerial Director Riecke for food economics, would be placed\r\nin my office as permanent liaison men, to coordinate here political\r\naims with the economic necessities, in a department which would have\r\nto unite yet other persons for such coordinating work, depending on\r\nlater and for work (political leadership of labor unions, construction\r\netc.) After notification of the Reich foreign minister, the latter\r\nappointed Geheimrat Grosskopf as permanent liaison man to my office.\r\nFor the requested representation in the political department of my\r\noffice (headed by Reichsamtsleiter Dr. Leibbrandt) the foreign ministry\r\nreleased General Counsel Dr. Braeutigam, who is known to me for many\r\nyears, speaks Russian, and worked for years in Russia. Negotiations\r\nwhich if necessary will be placed before the Fuehrer are under way\r\nwith the foreign office regarding its wishes for the assignment of its\r\nrepresentatives to the future Reich commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda ministry appointed State Secretary Gutterer as\r\npermanent liaison man, and a complete agreement was reached to\r\nthe effect that the decisions on all political and other essays,\r\nspeeches, proclamations, etc. would be made in my office; a great\r\nnumber of substantial works for propaganda would be delivered and\r\nthe papers prepared by the propaganda ministry would be modified\r\nhere if necessary. The whole practical employment of propaganda will\r\nundisputedly be subject to the Reich ministry of public enlightenment\r\nand propaganda. For the sake of closer cooperation the propaganda\r\nministry assigns yet another person directly to my department\r\n\"Enlightenment and Press\" [Aufklaerung und Presse] and in addition\r\nappoints a permanent press liaison man. All these activities have been\r\ngoing on for some time, and without attracting attention to my office\r\nin any way, this agreement on contents and terminology takes place\r\ncontinually every day.\r\n\r\nThorough discussions took place with Reichsminister Ohnesorge\r\nconcerning future transmission of communication and setting up\r\nof all technical necessities in future occupied territories;\r\nwith Reichsminister Seldte on the supply of labor forces, with\r\nReichsminister Frick (State Secretary Stuckart) in detailed form on\r\nthe assignment of numerous necessary officials for the commissariats.\r\nAccording to the present estimate there will be four Reichs\r\nKommisariats, as approved by the Fuehrer. I shall propose to the\r\nFuehrer for political and other reasons to set up a suitable number\r\nof General Commissariats (24), Main Commissariats (about 80) and\r\nRegional [Gebiet] Commissariats (over 900). A General Commissariat\r\nwould correspond to a former Generalgouvernment, a Main Commissariat to\r\na Main-Government. A Regional Commissariat contains 3 or 4 Districts\r\n[Kreise]. In view of the huge spaces that is the minimum number which\r\nappears necessary for a future civil government and/or administration.\r\nA portion of the officials has already been requested on the basis of\r\nthe above named command of the Chief of the OKW.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner conferences have taken place with the Reich\r\nPhysicians Leader [Reichsaerztefuehrer] Dr. Conti, the Inspector of the\r\nArmy Veterinary Service, and all specialists belonging thereto. The\r\ndifficulties of medical and veterinary supply were thoroughly discussed\r\nand the measures were previewed, in order to insure well-prepared\r\nemployment of the forces mentioned after the end of the operations.\r\nA conference with Reichsminister Dr. Todt resulted in the assignment\r\nfirst of all of 4 higher leaders of the Construction Service, whereupon\r\nDr. Todt proposed to unite administratively under one leadership the\r\nwhole Construction Service.\r\n\r\nDiscussions took place with Reich Leader Amann and his chief of staff\r\nRienhardt regarding the publication of four German newspapers in the\r\nReich Commissariats to start with. Furthermore a number of newspapers\r\nin the prospective native tongues were considered. According to the\r\nlatest information the technical forces, for this work are already at\r\nthe border and may be committed at any time to determine whether the\r\nprerequisites for printing shops are present.\r\n\r\nDiscussions are also under way with Corpsleader Huehnlein and with the\r\nReich youth leadership to assure a necessary and suitable mobilization.\r\nIntensive talks also took place with the Chief of Staff [Stabschef] of\r\nthe SA. He was asked to make available a number of the most reliable\r\nSA leaders for this gigantic territory, which he agreed to do. The\r\npersonnel suggestions together with other suggestions will be submitted\r\nto the Fuehrer. The same agreement has been reached with the Reich\r\norganizational leader [Reichsorganisationsleiter], who has instructed\r\nthe commander of Kroessinsee, Gohdes, to carry out the swelling\r\nchannelling of requested persons, to admit them into Kroessinsee for\r\nschooling and instruction on the whole problem and prepare them in\r\nthe best manner for commitment. On the orders of Dr. Ley party member\r\nMarrenbach was then employed in order to take over already now the\r\nleadership of Russian labor unions in conjunction with the Wehrmacht.\r\nThat appeared as an eminently important problem, particularly also\r\nin connection with the economic leadership, because the labor unions\r\nundoubtedly have been a powerful support of the Soviets and especially\r\nhave the commitment of the German Labor Front appeared necessary under\r\ncertain conditions.\r\n\r\nLengthy discussions regarding the relationship of the Police to the\r\nnew order in the East have taken place. Certain proposed changes\r\nthereto have been suggested by the Reichsfuehrer SS and on his order\r\nby Gruppenfuehrer (SS Lt Gen) Heydrich which do not appear supportable\r\nto me for the complete authority of the German Reich government in the\r\nEast. Also the documents of this problem will have to be laid before\r\nthe Fuehrer for decision.\r\n\r\nAside from these negotiations I received the responsible deputies of\r\nthe entire propaganda, namely Ministerial Director Fritsche, Ambassador\r\nSchmidt, Reich Superintendent of Broadcasting Glasmeier, Dr. Grothe\r\nOKW, and others. Without going into details of political objectives I\r\ninstructed the above-named persons in confidence about the necessary\r\nattitude, with the request to tone down the whole terminology of the\r\npress, without issuing any statements.\r\n\r\nThe works for substantial coverage of the Eastern question prepared\r\nlong ago appeared in my office, which I turned over to the propaganda\r\ndeputies. I enclose a few samples thereof. These pamphlets, which may\r\nlater be turned over to the press for development, deal with the whole\r\nstructure and organization of the USSR, the economic possibilities of\r\nthe East, agriculture, the peoples of the Soviet Union, the work of\r\nthe Komintern since 1889, the Jews in the Soviet Union since 1933,\r\nstatistical results of the poll taken among the Germans in Russia, the\r\nhistory of the Ukraine, of the Caucasus, of Turkestan. Extensive works\r\nare in preparation for the foundation of legal administration: German\r\nlaw in the Ukraine, German art in the Ukraine, influence of the German\r\nlanguage on the Ukrainian language, the Ukrainians from the viewpoint\r\nof the Germans. In addition a number of articles are being prepared\r\nin Russian language which have the purpose of enlightening the people\r\nof the Soviet Union about true conditions in Germany. These articles\r\nare also suitable as the basis for newspaper articles in the newly\r\noccupied territories. Finally, after extensive work, an ethnological\r\nmap of the East based on the most recent statistical reports has been\r\nprinted in great number and made available to all offices. This map\r\ncan be used as the basis of eventual fixing of boundaries in the north\r\nas well as in the south, and offers points of departure for fixing the\r\nboundaries of the future Reich Commissariats.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these conferences, conducted for the most part by\r\nmyself, continuous consultation and organizational preparation is under\r\nway through my office and through those of the liaison men delegated\r\nfrom the other offices of the Party and the State.\r\n\r\nI may say that all the work, inasmuch as it is at all possible under\r\npresent condition, is in full swing. Aside from the General and Chief\r\ncommissariats more than 900 Regional Commissariats are planned, which\r\nmust all be manned by political leaders, representatives of the\r\ndepartment and officials of the Reich Ministry of the Interior. The\r\nwork in the East differs basically from the conditions in the West.\r\nWhereas we can count on every technical installation and a cultured\r\npopulation here in the big cities, that is not the case in the East.\r\nThere literally everything will have to be prepared and taken along,\r\nadditionally for the gigantic spaces--not only an auto park but a\r\ngreat number of typewriters, office material, above all medical\r\nsupplies and much more down to the bed sheets. It does not appear\r\npossible to accomplish such a project suddenly in 14 days, therefore\r\nall these arrangements had to be set in full motion already now on my\r\nresponsibility on the basis of the Fuehrer's decree.\r\n\r\nThe structure of my office itself is temporarily organized as follows\r\nin carrying out the Fuehrer's order. I have requested Gauleiter and\r\nReichsstatthalter Dr. Meyer as my permanent representative. He has\r\nnegotiated personally and thoroughly, through the whole time with\r\nall pertinent offices, in order to develop all aspects down to the\r\ndetails. A political department has been founded for the execution of\r\nthe substantial work, under my co-worker of many years Dr. Leibbrandt\r\n(deputy General Consul Dr. Braeutigam), who prepares the various books\r\nand pamphlets for information. A great number of propaganda leaflets\r\nhave been composed by him which will then have been scattered over\r\nthe Russian front in huge numbers by the armed forces. Also for a\r\nspecific time other leaflets are ready which are addressed directly\r\nto the individual races. I do not care to decide on this date for\r\nmyself, and will lay these originals before the Fuehrer at the first\r\nopportunity with the request to check the contents and determine the\r\ntime of the eventually approved appeals. The political department\r\nis also undertaking a thorough investigation of all these, with the\r\nexception of Russians, who eventually can be used as advisers for the\r\nadministration of the various nationalities. Continuous discussions\r\nabout this subject are under way with representatives of the OKW, the\r\npropaganda ministry, etc. Secondly a department of economic-political\r\ncooperation has been founded under direction of Oberbereichsleiter\r\nMalletke. Department of \"Law, Finance, and Administration\" has been\r\ntaken over by Regierungspraesident Runte. A department for Culture\r\nand Science is as yet unoccupied since the development of this\r\nquestion does not appear urgent. Also the department \"Enlightenment\r\nand Press.\" It is occupied by Major of the Air Force Carl Cranz,\r\ndeputy Job Zimmermann. Integrated here are co-workers who command\r\nthe Russian, Ukrainian, and other languages. The wishes of the Reich\r\nPress Chief [Reichspressechef] for setting up one press chief for each\r\nReichskommissar are under discussion in order to decide them in that\r\nsense if possible.\r\n\r\nThus I hope that when, after preliminary conclusion of the military\r\naction the Fuehrer has the possibility for a report from me, I shall be\r\nable to report to the Fuehrer for reaching preparations, up to those\r\npoints of special and personal nature which the Fuehrer alone can\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1056-PS\r\n\r\n First Section: The Organization of the Administration of Occupied\r\n Eastern Territories\r\n\r\n  [Found in Rosenberg's files.]\r\n\r\n  A. _Construction._\r\n\r\n  I. _Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories._\r\n\r\nThe newly occupied Eastern Territories are subordinated to the Reich\r\nMinister for the Occupied Eastern Territories. By directions of the\r\nFuehrer he establishes a civil administration there upon withdrawal\r\nof the military administration. He heads and supervises the entire\r\nadministration of this area and represents the sovereignty of the Reich\r\nin the occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Ministry for the occupied Eastern Territories is organized\r\ninto the following main departments and departments under the permanent\r\nand general deputy of the Reich Minister:\r\n\r\n    _Main Department I: Central Administration_.\r\n\r\n    _Main Department II: Policies:_\r\n\r\n       Department II a : Policies,\r\n       Department II b : Enlightenment and Press,\r\n       Department II c : Labor and Tax Policies.\r\n\r\n_Main Department III: Administration:_\r\n\r\n  Department III a : General Administration,\r\n  Department III b : Health System,\r\n  Department III c : Veterinary System,\r\n  Department III d : Law,\r\n  Department III e : Finance,\r\n  Department III f : Science and Culture.\r\n\r\n_Main Department IV: Economic-political and Technical Cooperation:_\r\n\r\n  Department IV a : Industrial Economy,\r\n  Department IV b : Food and Farming,\r\n  Department IV c : Forest and Lumber Economy,\r\n  Department IV d : Price-fixing and Price-control,\r\n  Department IV e : Labor,\r\n  Department IV f : Technology,\r\n  Department IV g : Transportation.\r\n\r\nTo the Reich Ministry is assigned a deputy of the Reich Leader SS and\r\nChief of the German Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. _General Territorial Organization._\r\n\r\nThe Occupied Eastern Territories are organized into Reich Commissariats.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissariat \"Ostland\" is subdivided into _General Districts_\r\n[Generalbezirke] which are in turn subdivided into _Main Districts_\r\n[Hauptbezirke] and _Circuit Districts_ [Kreisgebiete].\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the Reich Commissariats will be established according\r\nto political, ethnic, economic and commercial-political aspects.\r\nThe boundaries of the areas of command of the Wehrmacht commanders\r\ncorrespond to those of the Reich Commissariats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III. _Subordinate Offices._\r\n\r\n  _1. Reich Commissars._\r\n\r\nIn the Reich Commissariats, Reich Commissars are responsible for\r\nthe entire civil administration under the supreme authority of\r\nthe Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. According\r\nto the instructions of the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories the Reich Commissar, as a functionary of the Reich\r\nheads and supervises, within his precincts, the entire civil\r\nadministration. Within the scope of these instructions he acts on his\r\nown responsibility.\r\n\r\nSubordinate offices of the Reich Commissar are:\r\n\r\n  General Commissariats,\r\n  Main Commissariats,\r\n  District Commissariats.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the General Districts are established by the\r\nReich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories upon proposal\r\nby the Reich Commissar. The boundaries of the Circuit Territories\r\nare determined by the Reich Commissar upon proposal by the pertinent\r\nGeneral Commissar, in as far as the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories has not reserved this right for himself in\r\nindividual cases. Furthermore the Reich Commissar determines--with\r\napproval of the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories--the sphere of the Main Commissars.\r\n\r\nAn administrative staff is subordinated to the Reich Commissar in his\r\nAdministrative grade. It is organized into:\r\n\r\n    I. Main Department: Central Administration.\r\n\r\n    II. Main Department: Policies:\r\n\r\n       Department II a : Policies,\r\n       Department II b : Labor and Tax Policies,\r\n       Department II c : Administration,\r\n       Department II d : Health system,\r\n       Department II e : Law,\r\n       Department II f : Finance,\r\n       Department II g : Science and Culture.\r\n\r\nIII. Main Department: Economy:\r\n\r\n  Department III a : Industrial Economy,\r\n  Department III b : Food and Farming,\r\n  Department III c : Forestry and Hunting,\r\n  Department III d : Price-fixing and Price-control.\r\n\r\nIV. Main Department: Technology, Transportation, Labor:\r\n\r\n  Department IV a : Technology,\r\n  Department IV b : Transportation,\r\n  Department IV c : Commitment of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the Main Departments have the rank of General Commissars.\r\n\r\nFurthermore a Higher SS- and Police Leader is subordinated directly\r\nand personally to the Reich Commissar. In addition one official of the\r\nReich Railways and one of the Reich Post Office are assigned to the\r\nReich Commissar who are at the same time liaison officials with the\r\ntransport and communications offices of the Wehrmacht commander.\r\n\r\nMain Department Heads, Department Heads, and Consultants are appointed\r\nand dismissed by the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories upon proposal by the Reich Commissar. The Reich Commissar\r\nappoints one of the Main Department Heads to be his chief of staff.\r\nHe has the task of assuring the smooth coordination of the individual\r\ndepartments and is responsible for the internal affairs of the office.\r\nFor this purpose he is entitled to have himself constantly informed\r\nabout their sphere of activity by the Main Department Heads.\r\n\r\nThe Higher SS- and Police Leader is directly subordinated to the Reich\r\nCommissar. However the chief of staff has the general right to secure\r\ninformation from him also. His official title is:\r\n\r\n  \"The Reich Commissar for the Eastern Territory\r\n  The Higher SS- and Police Leader.\"\r\n\r\nGreat stress is to be placed on close cooperation between him, the\r\nChief of Staff, and the other Main Department Heads of the office of\r\nthe Reich Commissar, particularly with the one for Policies.\r\n\r\nInsofar as the Reich Commissar is prevented from performing his duties\r\nfor a prolonged period of time, a deputy will be provided by the Reich\r\nMinister for the Occupied Eastern Territories upon his proposal. This\r\ndeputy signs with the notation: \"for the Reich Commissar.\" The Main\r\nDepartment Heads and Department Heads sign, insofar as the Reich\r\nCommissar has not reserved the final signature for himself, or in case\r\nit is not a matter of so much importance that it must be signed by the\r\nReich Commissar, with the notation: \"By order\" [Im Auftrag]. The Main\r\nDepartment Heads regulate the manner of signing for their department\r\nand consultant heads. These must likewise always sign with \"by order.\"\r\n\r\n  2. _General Commissars._\r\n\r\nThe General Commissar forms the administrative office of intermediate\r\nappeal. Within his jurisdiction he heads the administration according\r\nto the general directives of the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories and the prescriptions of the Reich Commissar.\r\n\r\nHis office is organized like that of the Reich Commissar, except that\r\nin the place of Main Departments, there are Departments whose spheres\r\nof work in turn are organized into Consulting Offices which are\r\ncollected into Groups according to necessity. The General Commissar\r\nappoints one of the Department heads as Chief of Staff who has the\r\ncorresponding position and corresponding rights of the Reich Chiefs of\r\nStaff of the Reich Commissars.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of representation of the General Commissar in cases of\r\nprolonged incapacity, the same provisions apply as for representation\r\nof the Reich Commissar.\r\n\r\nThe SS- and Police Leader assigned to the General Commissar is directly\r\nsubordinated to him; however the Chief of Staff has the general right\r\nof requiring information from him. The SS- and Police Leader employs\r\nthe following official designation:\r\n\r\n  \"The General Commissar . . . .\r\n  The SS- and Police Leader.\"\r\n\r\nDepartment Heads, Group Heads and Consultants sign with the remark: \"By\r\norder.\" The Department Heads regulate the manner of signing for their\r\nconsultants.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3. _Regional Commissars._\r\n\r\nThe Regional Commissar heads the entire administration of the lower\r\nadministration office in the Circuit District in accordance with the\r\ninstructions of the General Commissar and the superior offices. With\r\nhim therefore lies the main weight of the total administrative set-up.\r\nThe officials to whom the Regional Commissar has granted the right of\r\nsigning sign with the notation \"By order.\" The leader of the police\r\nunit assigned to him is directly subordinated to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. _Main Commissars._\r\n\r\nUpon recommendation by the Reich Commissar the Reich Minister for\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories appoints Main Commissars for Main\r\nDistricts formed by the consolidation of several Circuit Districts.\r\nThey are to take care of coordination of administration of the\r\nCircuit Districts placed under him by order of the General Commissar.\r\nThey can have themselves informed concerning all matters by the\r\nDistrict Commissars subordinated to them in all decisive points of\r\nview of the administration and in urgent cases provide them with\r\ninstructions. Cautious use is to be made of this right to instruct,\r\nas the Main Commissars are not to interpose themselves as a special\r\nauthority between the District and General Commissars. In every case\r\nof instruction to a District Commissar the General Commissar is to\r\nbe notified in conjunction with an account of the reasons. The Main\r\nCommissars are to keep themselves informed of all important matters\r\nwithin the sphere of their authority, by means of numerous conferences,\r\nand to inform the General Commissars of important observations.\r\nConduct of business between the General Commissar and the District\r\nCommissar takes place directly. General Commissars inform the Main\r\nCommissars involved in writing about their orders issued to District\r\nCommissars. The same is to take place with bulletins of the District\r\nCommissars. The affairs of the Main Commissars are to be elaborated in\r\nbulletins.\r\n\r\nThe responsible office of the Main Commissar requires an understanding\r\nof the political and economic-political needs of the region to be\r\nsupervised, by an exact knowledge of the existing circumstances. The\r\nMain Commissar, as representative of the General Commissar, is called\r\nupon in his sphere of office to keep Regional and City Commissars\r\nspatially in touch with the General Commissar through constant and\r\nclose liaison with them, and to contribute to the speeding up of\r\nnecessary decisions, namely such as go beyond the boundaries of the\r\nterritory. The activity of a Main Commissar, rightly conceived and\r\npurposefully conducted, shall and must contribute, to give District\r\nand City Commissars increased certainty in their decision, to give\r\nthe latter a materially and spatially strengthened effect, and to\r\nrelieve the General Commissar of part of the burden of supervising\r\nhis subordinated administration. The office of the Main Commissar is\r\npolitically of special significance. It includes the task of leadership\r\nin the official realm subordinated to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Relationship of Superiors in the Service._\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories is the service\r\nsuperior of the Reich Commissar and the officials and the employees\r\nsubordinate to them. The Reich Commissar is the superior of all\r\nofficials and employees of his office and of the offices subordinate\r\nto him. The General Commissar is the superior of the officials and\r\nemployees of his office and of the officials and employees of the\r\noffices of the Main and Regional Commissars. The Main Commissar and the\r\nRegional Commissar are superior of the officials and employees of their\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Jurisdictions._\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissars, General Commissars, Main Commissars and Regional\r\nCommissars (City Commissars) are--aside from the military agencies--the\r\nonly Reich authorities in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Other Reich\r\nauthorities may not be established alongside them. They handle all\r\nquestions of administration of the area which is subordinate to their\r\nsovereignty and all affairs which concern the organization and activity\r\nof the administration including those of the police in the supervision\r\nof the native agencies and organizations, and of the population.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister governs the occupied Eastern Territories by order of\r\nthe Fuehrer. He can make the law for all the territories.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissar directs and supervises the entire German\r\ncivil administration as well as the existing and reestablished\r\nnative administration in his Reich Commissariat. He can decree law\r\n(ordinances) for his territory, insofar as the law has not been or will\r\nnot be decreed by the Reich Minister.\r\n\r\nThe General Commissar directs the administration of his district and\r\nsupervises the Main and Regional Commissars as well as the native\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Commissar directs the administration of his territory as a\r\nsubordinate administrative office and supervises the native offices in\r\nthe lowest and county echelons.\r\n\r\nThe following are particularly important administrative tasks:\r\n\r\n_a._ Police measures,\r\n\r\n_b._ Making the economic forces of the territory available for the\r\nmaintenance of the occupation troops and the purposes of the German war\r\neconomy,\r\n\r\n_c._ Caring for the population,\r\n\r\n_d._ Securing of supplies and installations of all kinds which are\r\nimportant for life and for war,\r\n\r\n_e._ Collaboration with the maintenance as well as reestablishment of\r\ninland water communications of rail and postal communications,\r\n\r\n_f._ Supervision of the civil population, collaboration with the\r\ncounter intelligence [Abwehr], interesting the population in rendering\r\nservice,\r\n\r\n_g._ Dissolution of enemy organizations which might still exist.\r\n\r\nThe Armed Forces Commanders exercise the rights of military sovereignty\r\nand the territorial power of command in their areas of jurisdiction.\r\nTheir demands will be carried out in the civilian sphere by the Reich\r\nCommissars and their subordinate agencies. The military agencies are\r\nneither superior nor subordinate to the agencies of the civilian\r\nadministration. The Armed Forces Commanders can provide even civilian\r\nagencies with directives in urgent cases, however, in accordance with\r\nthe Fuehrer's decree of 5 June 1941. All agencies of the civilian\r\nadministration are obligated to inform the military agencies of all\r\naffairs which might affect the sphere of their assignments.\r\n\r\nConsiderable value is to be laid upon a frictionless collaboration. The\r\nCommissars are to have themselves thoroughly informed by the Armed\r\nForces Commanders, respectively by the agencies subordinated to them\r\nabout their observations, experiences, and the measures already taken\r\nafter taking over the administration. The laws decreed by them and the\r\nadministrative orders given by them remain in effect insofar as the\r\ndecrees and ordinances are not abrogated.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has entrusted Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, as\r\nCommissioner for the Four-year Plan, with the supervision of the\r\ntasks of the war economy in the Occupied Eastern Territories. The\r\neconomic inspectorates and economic commands are active there as his\r\nrepresentatives (see green folio). These economic inspectorates and\r\neconomic commands will be substantially absorbed in the agencies\r\nof the civil administration after the establishment of the civil\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIf basic differences of opinion should arise between the agencies of\r\nthe civil administration and the military agencies or, insofar as\r\nthey still exist, the economic inspectorates and economic commands,\r\nand these cannot be settled in direct conversations, then it is to be\r\nreported to the superior civil authority immediately so that the latter\r\ncan, in cooperation with the superior military agency, bring about an\r\namicable unification.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Business Communications._\r\n\r\nAfter taking over the businesses, the current state of affairs is to\r\nbe reported briefly to the next superior agency, in particular the\r\ntaking over of the administration from the hands of the agencies of the\r\nmilitary administration as well about the state of the population and\r\nthe capacity for work of any existing native authorities. It is further\r\nto be reported which office buildings have been occupied and which\r\nlines of communication are available. The Reich and General Commissars\r\nwill determine the periods at which the subordinate agencies are to\r\nreport regularly about the general situation without prejudice to the\r\nduty to provide individual reports and special delivery reports (at\r\nfirst, at short intervals which can be later lengthened). At first the\r\nReich Commissars will give the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories a comprehensive report on the situation in brief form twice\r\na month, on the first and fifteenth of each month. The Reich Minister\r\nis to be given a report by the Reich Commissar immediately about\r\nincidents of an especially important nature. The General Commissars\r\nand Regional Commissars must report directly to the Reich Minister for\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories by the quickest means particularly\r\nimportant incidents, as, for example, widespread unrest, more\r\nimportant acts of sabotage and strikes, great natural catastrophes and\r\nthe like, and at the same time report them to the next superior agency.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories will publish an\r\nofficial gazette under the title\r\n\r\n  \"Official Gazette of the Reich Minister for the\r\n  Occupied Eastern Territories\" (VBldRM Ost),\r\n\r\nin which all the decrees of the Reich Minister will be published. At\r\nfirst the official gazette will only appear when necessary. In addition\r\nthere will appear the \"Reich Ministerial Gazette of the Reich Ministry\r\nfor the Occupied Eastern Territories (RMBl. dRM Ost),\" in which all\r\nexecutive decrees and other administrative directives of general\r\nvalidity will be published.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissars will publish the decree of the Reich Minister for\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories, as well as their own decrees and\r\ndecrees of general interest, in two or more languages according to need\r\nin official gazette (Gazette of the Reich Commissar for......).\r\n\r\nThe General Commissars will publish official papers, likewise in two\r\nor more languages, in which they will publish their ordinances and\r\norders of general interest as also the police orders of the Regional\r\nCommissars without prejudice to other means of publishing in individual\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThe title of these official papers will read:\r\n\r\n  \"Official paper of the General Commissar in.....\"\r\n\r\nIn cases of doubt the _German_ text of the ordinances, decrees, and\r\norders is valid.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all publications of German agencies are to be made known in\r\notherwise usual form, e.g. by publishing in the press which has already\r\nbeen allowed, by placard, public reading, loudspeaker and the like.\r\n\r\nThe Official Gazette of the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories is to be kept by all the agencies within the Occupied\r\nEastern territories. The same applies for the gazettes of the Reich\r\nCommissars and the official papers of the General Commissars within\r\ntheir official spheres.\r\n\r\n\"The operation procedure for the Reich Ministry for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories\" will be valid for the internal conduct of business\r\nof the agencies of the Reich Commissars; for communications with secret\r\nmatters \"The directives for secret matters for all administrative\r\nauthorities.\"\r\n\r\nThe last is valid until suitable safes are obtained, with the provision\r\nthat secret documents may be kept in strong and well locked wooden\r\nchests, which are to be kept in rooms which are to be kept locked.\r\n\r\nAll incoming documents are to be opened by an especially trustworthy\r\nofficial of the Central Administration and/or of the main office and\r\nthen introduced into the prescribed order of business.\r\n\r\nFurther orders about the internal operating procedure are to be decreed\r\nby the director of the office.\r\n\r\n  Second Section: Working directives for the Civil Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _General._\r\n\r\nThe first task of the Civil Administration in the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories is to represent the interests of the Reich. This\r\nhighest fundamental is to be considered first of all measures and\r\ndeliberations. It is time the occupied Eastern territories are to be\r\nable to lead a certain life of their own in the more distant future in\r\nthis or that not yet determined form. They remain however parts of the\r\nGreater German sphere and are always to be governed from the viewpoint\r\nof this main thought.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of the Hague Rules of Land Warfare which deal with the\r\nadministration of a country occupied by a foreign armed power are not\r\nvalid since the USSR is dissolved and the Reich, as a result, has the\r\nduty of exercising all the powers of government and the other usual\r\npowers of sovereignty in the interest of the inhabitants. All measures\r\ntherefore, which the German administration deems necessary and suitable\r\nfor the execution of this comprehensive task are permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Political Directives._\r\n\r\n(Are being worked on by the political department. See next page).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Administration, Law, Finances._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Administration._\r\n\r\n_a._ The specially assigned administration of the country will already\r\nbe broken up upon the beginning of the Civil Administration. Its\r\nrepresentatives will have fled or have been removed by the Soviets.\r\nVillage Soviets will exist only in individual cases. These are to be\r\ndissolved immediately as a rule.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Reich Commissars are to make sparing use of the authority\r\nto decree laws above all at first, so that the administration is not\r\nchoked by red tape. The exact knowledge of the territory and its\r\ninhabitants, which naturally is not available at present, is essential\r\nfor an extensive legislation. Likewise the fewest possible binding\r\nordinances are to be decreed. The higher authorities must rather take\r\nthe path of work directives which will give the subordinate authorities\r\nsufficient leeway for the consideration of the local conditions.\r\n\r\n_c._ As far as the boundaries of the Regional Commissariat are\r\nconcerned, at first the boundaries of the corresponding Soviet\r\nadministrative regions are to be the basis, since the population is\r\naccustomed to these and bases for any other determination of boundaries\r\nare lacking. As soon as another determination of boundaries appears\r\nmore to the purpose, in the course of time, it can be done later.\r\n\r\n_d._ The handling of cases of sabotage is the concern of the Senior\r\nSS- and police leader, of the SS- and Police leader and/or the police\r\nleaders of the lower echelon. Insofar, however, as collective measures\r\nagainst the population of a definite region appear appropriate, the\r\ndecision about them rests with the competent Commissar on the proposal\r\nof the Police leader. The calling of the population for the tasks of\r\nguarding can be ordered by the Regional Commissar.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of fines of money or goods, as well as the ordering\r\nof the seizure of hostages and the shooting of inhabitants of the\r\nterritory in which the acts of sabotage have taken place, can only be\r\ndone by the General Commissar, insofar as the Reich Commissar himself\r\ndoes not intervene. The most sparing use of the seizing of hostages\r\nis to be made. Above all it is only to be ordered when the desired\r\nresult can be forced by this measure and when the case is such that if\r\nnecessary, in the case of negative results, the consequences of the\r\nseizure can be neutralized.\r\n\r\n_e._ In cities, villages, worker settlements, city settlements, etc.,\r\nthe interest of reliable persons is to be acquired as soon as possible.\r\nFrom the ranks of these reliable persons a local commissioner (similar\r\nto our Buergermeister) and confidential councillors can later be\r\nappointed, so that in this way the local life will be set in motion\r\nagain and the Regional Commissar will have organs under him who will\r\ncarry out his orders. Insofar as such commissioners and confidential\r\ncouncillors have already been set up by the military administration,\r\nthey are to be taken over by the Civil Administration at first. In\r\ncase financial means are necessary for the fulfillment of urgent tasks\r\nwithin individual communities, they are to be supplied by means of\r\ncredits. The credits are to be charged to the banking institutions of\r\nthe country, or, in case this is not possible, to the Reich credit bank.\r\n\r\n_f._ Where an urgent need of the population for provision goods exists,\r\nthis is to be satisfied within the range of possibility so that\r\nfamines can be avoided. It may be desired to grant assistance in money\r\nand in goods to urgently needy persons (unemployed and the like).\r\n\r\n_g._ With the dissolution of the USSR which accompanied the defeat\r\nof this state there is no longer any state structure in the Eastern\r\nRegions and consequently no state citizenship for the inhabitants.\r\nHowever, for practical reasons with respect to citizenship the further\r\nexistence of a common state must be assumed for the time being, so\r\nthat the inhabitants should not be considered as stateless, which\r\nis undesirable for various reasons. The final question of state\r\ncitizenship can only be decided later since it depends on the state\r\ndevelopment in the East. Since this problem can only be solved for the\r\nwhole Eastern Territory, the subordinate authorities must refrain from\r\nevery independent ruling. At a given time the Reich Minister for the\r\nEastern territories will issue appropriate decrees.\r\n\r\nThe racial Germans present in the Eastern territories do not become\r\nGerman Reich citizens automatically with the dissolution of the USSR,\r\nbut rather they are, for the present, placed on a par with the other\r\ninhabitants as regards citizenship. Petitions from racial Germans\r\nfor naturalization are not to be accepted at first, since a general\r\nregulation will be executed. Independent of this is that racial\r\nGermans, confirmed as such without objection, should already enjoy\r\nprivileges which are generally granted only to Reich citizens.\r\n\r\n_h._ The prohibition of entering or leaving the occupied Eastern\r\nterritories which was issued by the Supreme Commander of the\r\nArmy remains effective even after the withdrawal of the military\r\nadministration. Exceptions to this prohibition of entering and leaving\r\nwill be granted by the Permit Office attached to the Reich Minister for\r\nthe Occupied Eastern Territories and Permit Offices attached to the\r\nReich Commissars and if necessary to other authorities of the occupied\r\nEastern territories. Entering and leaving may only be allowed on urgent\r\npolitical, economical or other service reasons.\r\n\r\nThe following are not affected by the prohibition of entering and\r\nleaving:\r\n\r\n(1) Members of the Armed Forces and members of the Armed Forces\r\npersonnel with proper identification and travel orders.\r\n\r\n(2) Members of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories\r\nand of the authorities subordinated to it with valid official\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nNo application need be made to the Permit Office or Permit Branch\r\nOffices for minor frontier traffic. By \"minor frontier traffic\" is\r\nmeant those journeys which have to be made on account of economic\r\ncontacts over the frontier with the neighbouring countries on either\r\nside and are merely to some place lying not more than 50 km. from the\r\nfrontier. Only the lower-ranking administrative authorities, that is\r\nthe Regional Commissars, can give permission for frontier traffic.\r\n\r\nPermits and frontier traffic passes can be issued for single or several\r\njourneys over the frontier. In every case, their validity is limited to\r\na definite period.\r\n\r\nThe examination of claims, for the issue of permits, is made from\r\npolitical, security police and economic points of view. In cases of\r\ndoubt, therefore, the Permit Branch Offices attached to the Reich\r\nCommissars must obtain the approval of the appropriate department of\r\nthe Reich Commissars before the permit is issued.\r\n\r\nThe Permit Branch Offices issue permits merely for journeys from the\r\nformer territory of the USSR. For journeys into the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories, the Permit Office attached to the Reich Minister is, for\r\nthe present, the only competent office.\r\n\r\nThe question, whether a ban on journeys from one Reich Commissariat\r\nto another is to be decreed, cannot yet be decided. Only the Reich\r\nMinister for the Occupied Eastern Territories has the authority to make\r\nthe decision.\r\n\r\n_i._ The attitude of the German authorities to the native population\r\nis determined, on the one hand, by the political and economic aims,\r\nand, on the other, by the attitude of the inhabitants to the Germans.\r\nUnprovoked severe measures against the population of the country are\r\nnot desired and must therefore not be taken.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of security, it may be necessary, especially in towns and\r\ncities, to establish a curfew-hour, which means that, after that hour\r\nthe population may no longer walk the public thoroughfares and squares.\r\nAs the time of the curfew can be decided only in accordance with\r\nlocal requirements, the Regional Commissar must be made responsible\r\nfor imposing it on the instructions of the Reich Commissar and/or the\r\nGeneral Commissar.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the police closing-time, i.e. the time after which\r\ntaverns may no longer be opened and no guests may remain in the tavern\r\nrooms. The establishing of the curfew and of the police closing-time is\r\nto be effected by Police Decree and/or Police Order with appropriate\r\nthreat of punishment. Apart from this, breaking the curfew order is\r\npunishable under the Decree concerning the liability for registration\r\nand limitation of sojourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Health._\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance that the health and veterinary services be\r\nreestablished as quickly as possible. Doctors, veterinary surgeons or\r\nmedical personnel on the spot are to be instructed to continue with\r\ntheir work or start it again. In times of emergency, especially in\r\nthe case of epidemics, a request that doctors, veterinary surgeons\r\nand medical supplies be made available is to be sent to the Military\r\nAuthorities, should it be impossible to overcome the emergency in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Law._\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissars are responsible for controlling the Special Courts\r\nset up and attached to the Reich Commissars. These are also Senior\r\nOfficials of the Prosecuting Authorities attached to these Courts. The\r\nSS Executive and Police Officers and Senior SS Executive and Police\r\nOfficers are in charge of the Courts Martial.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable (in the Eastern regions first of all) that the\r\ncountry's own jurisdiction be reestablished, formed of reliable persons\r\nwhere they can be found. This is all the more necessary in that the\r\nGerman Courts, on account of the scarcity of personnel, can pass\r\njudgment only on offences which are punishable under German Laws and\r\nthe punishment of which is of urgent German interest. The punishment\r\nof other criminals, however, can only remain in abeyance for a short\r\nperiod. The concerns of the civil administration of justice can remain\r\nin the background for the time being and some honorary Courts of\r\nJustice may suffice at first. Wherever the country's own jurisdiction\r\nis still intact, which may be the case in the East, it is to be\r\ninstructed to continue its work immediately after unreliable elements\r\nhave been removed.\r\n\r\nThose arrested by the Soviet Legal Authorities on account of sentence\r\nwhich has been passed may only be released after each individual case\r\nhas been examined.\r\n\r\nThis examination is to be carried out with the greatest speed in regard\r\nto convicted nationalists and other political prisoners. In cases of\r\ndoubt the opinion of the Political Department attached to the Reich\r\nCommissar or the General Commissar or the Executive SS and Police\r\nOfficer should be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe District Commissar is responsible for the supervision of all\r\nprisons, insofar as the Reich Commissar does not decree otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible at the moment to produce a comprehensive new\r\nPenal Code, the Soviet Penal Law (in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania\r\nthe pre-Soviet Laws) are for the time being still applicable to the\r\ncountry's own courts, nevertheless without those regulations which\r\napply to political offences. This also applies with regard to the Civil\r\nLaw, the right of voluntary jurisdiction and to the right of procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Finance._\r\n\r\nIt is intended to draw up a unified General Budget for the complete\r\nAdministration of the Eastern Territories, in other words from the\r\nReich Minister downwards to the District Commissar. Whether there\r\nis any point in separating this plan into separate budgets for the\r\nvarious Reich Commissariats, or whether credit accounts will simply\r\nbe established for the subordinate administrative bodies, can only\r\nbe decided after the whole Administration has been set up. The basic\r\nprinciple of this General Budget must be that the cost of the whole\r\nadministration shall be borne by the country itself. Until such a\r\nbudget has been drawn up and further regulations have been issued\r\nregarding the use of the income derived from taxes and from balances\r\nfrom the State undertakings, the Reich will use credits to cover\r\npublic expenditure. These credits which will be allotted to the Reich\r\nCommissars and from there on to the subordinate offices by the Reich\r\nCommissar for the Occupied Eastern Territories are to be administered\r\nin accordance with the directives as per printed Appendix.\r\n\r\nUntil further notice taxes are to continue to be paid by the\r\ninhabitants in accordance with the existing Soviet taxation system (in\r\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania in accordance with the taxation system\r\nof the pre-Soviet era) if nothing is decided to contrary. The taxation\r\nofficials in question who are still capable of working are to take up\r\ntheir duties immediately and/or continue them. The same applies to the\r\nutilization of the balances from the State undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe country's own authorities are forbidden to dispose of the amounts\r\ncollected without the permission of the German authorities (for the\r\ntime being Reich Commissars).\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Learning and Education._\r\n\r\nSchooling will, in most parts of the country, have ceased due to the\r\nmilitary events. There is in general no particular need for schooling\r\nto be put into operation again quickly, as long as there are other\r\nurgent tasks to carry out. In the East the resumption of schooling in\r\nthe near future should be aimed at, insofar as there are suitable and\r\nreliable teachers to hand. For the time being further directives from\r\nthe Reich Minister should be awaited with regard to Universities and\r\nother Academic Institutions and with regard to cultural establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Economic Administration._\r\n\r\nAs the Reich Marshall in his capacity as Plenipotentiary for the\r\nFour-year Plan has been charged by the Fuehrer with the supreme\r\ncoordination of the Economy of the whole Eastern Region, his directives\r\nare applicable to the economic measures which are laid down in the\r\nprinted collective folder attached. When carrying out these directives\r\nthe general political aim as laid down in figure 2. of this section\r\nshould be minutely observed. If in individual cases, the aims of\r\neconomic policy conflict, in the opinion of the German department\r\ndealing with the matter, with this general political goal, the Reich\r\nCommissar should be informed, where a matter of principle is involved,\r\nand his decision requested.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Engineering and Communications._\r\n\r\nWith regard to urgent constructional measures, particularly the\r\nrepairing and improving of highways, the necessary directives are\r\nlikewise given in the \"Green file,\" published by the Reichsmarschall.\r\nThe departments of the Civil Administration should most emphatically\r\nsupport the carrying out of these directives.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Railways and the Reich Post Office are under the control of\r\nthe military departments for the duration of the war. Thus the Reich\r\nCommissars and the authorities under their orders have no power to\r\nissue instructions to the Reich Railways and the Reich Post Office.\r\nEach Reich Commissar, however, is allotted a delegate of the Reich\r\nRailways and the Reich Post Office who will hear the wishes of the\r\nCivil Administration and submit them to his administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1058-PS\r\n\r\n Extract from a speech of Reichsleiter Rosenberg before the closest\r\n participants in the problem of the East, on 20 June, 1941.\r\n\r\nThe job of feeding the German people stands, this year, without a\r\ndoubt, at the top of the list of Germany's claims on the East; and\r\nhere the southern territories and the northern Caucasus will have\r\nto serve as a balance for the feeding of the German people. We see\r\nabsolutely no reason for any obligation on our part to feed also the\r\nRussian people with the products of that surplus-territory. We know\r\nthat this is a harsh necessity, bare of any feelings. A very extensive\r\nevacuation will be necessary, without any doubt, and it is sure that\r\nthe future will hold very hard years in store for the Russians. A later\r\ndecision will have to determine to which extent industries can still\r\nbe maintained there (wagon factories etc.). The consideration and\r\nexecution of this policy in the Russian area proper is for the German\r\nReich and its future a tremendous and by no means negative task, as\r\nmight appear, if one takes only the harsh necessity of the evacuation\r\nin consideration. The conversion of Russian dynamics towards the East\r\nis a task which requires the strongest characters. Perhaps, this\r\ndecision will also be approved by a _coming_ Russian later, not in 30\r\nbut maybe in a 100 years. For the Russian soul has been torn in the\r\nstruggle of the last 200 years. The original Russians are excellent\r\nartistic craftsmen, dancers and musicians. They have certain hereditary\r\ntalents, but these talents are different from those of the Western\r\npeople. The fight between Turgnjew and Dostejewsky was symbolic for the\r\nnation. The Russian soul found no outlet either way. If we now close\r\nthe West to the Russians, they might become conscious of their own\r\ninborn, proper forces and of the area to which they belong. A historian\r\nwill maybe see this decision in a different light, in hundreds of years\r\nthan it might appear to a Russian today.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1060-PS\r\n\r\n 1938 REICHSGESETZBLATT, PART I, PAGES 249-250, of 16 March 1938\r\n\r\n Supplementary Ordinance to the Law concerning the reunion of Austria\r\n with the German Reich, of 16 March 1938\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the law of 13 March 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I. p. 237)\r\nconcerning the reunion of Austria with the German Reich, I order:\r\n\r\n\r\nParagraph 1\r\n\r\n1.

Such measures were first taken far back\r\nin the Middle Ages; they could be observed as recently as during the\r\nlast few centuries. These restrictions were imposed with the intention\r\nof protecting the aryan population against the Jews.\r\n\r\nIdentical considerations led us as early as February, 1940 to conceive\r\nthe project of creating a Jewish residential district in Warsaw. The\r\ninitial intention was to establish as the Ghetto that part of the City\r\nof Warsaw which has the Vistula as its Eastern frontier. The particular\r\nsituation on prevailing in Warsaw seemed at first to frustrate this\r\nplan. It was moreover opposed by several authorities particularly by\r\nthe City Administration. They pointed in particular that disturbances\r\nin industry and trade would ensue if a Ghetto were founded in Warsaw,\r\nand that it would be impossible to provide the Jews with food if they\r\nwere assembled in a closed area.\r\n\r\nAt a conference held in March 1940, it was decided to postpone the plan\r\nof creating a Ghetto for the time being, owing to the above objections.\r\nAt the same time a plan was considered to declare the District of\r\nLublin the collecting area for all Jews within the Government General,\r\nespecially for the evacuated or fugitive Jews arriving from the Reich.\r\nBut as early as April 1940, the Higher SS and Police Leader, East,\r\nCracow, issued a declaration that there was no intention of assembling\r\nthe Jews within the Lublin District. In the meantime, the Jews had\r\nincreasingly taken to crossing the frontiers without permission and\r\nillegally. This noted especially at the limits of the Districts of\r\nLowicz and Skierniewice. Conditions in the town of Lowicz became\r\ndangerous from the point of view of hygiene as well as from that of\r\nthe Security Police, owing to these illegal migrations of Jews. The\r\nDistrict President of Lowicz therefore, began to install Ghettos in his\r\ndistrict in order to avoid these dangers.\r\n\r\nThe experiences in the district of Lowicz, after Ghettos had been\r\ninstalled, showed that this method is the only one suitable for\r\ndispelling the dangers which emanate repeatedly from the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of erecting a Ghetto in the City of Warsaw as well became\r\nmore and more urgent in the summer of 1940, since more and more troops\r\nwere being assembled in the district of Warsaw after termination of\r\nthe French campaign. At that time the Department for Hygiene urged\r\nthe speedy erection of a Ghetto in the interest of preserving the\r\nhealth of the German Forces and of the native population as well. The\r\noriginal plan of establishing the Ghetto in the suburb of Praga as\r\nintended in February 1940, would have taken at least 4 to 5 months,\r\nsince almost 600,000 persons had to be moved. But since experience\r\nshowed that greater outbreaks of epidemics might be expected in the\r\nwinter months and since for this reason the District Medical Officer\r\nurged that the resettling action ought to be completed by 15 November\r\n1940 at the latest, the plan of establishing a suburban ghetto in\r\nPraga was dropped; and instead, the area which hitherto had been\r\nused as a quarantine area for epidemics was selected for use as a\r\nJewish residential area. In October 1940, the Governor ordered the\r\nCommissioner of the District, President for the City of Warsaw, to\r\ncomplete the resettlement necessary for establishing the Ghetto within\r\nthe City of Warsaw by 15 November 1940.\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto thus established in Warsaw was inhabited by about 400,000\r\nJews. It contained 27,000 apartments with an average of 2-1/2 rooms\r\neach. It was separated from the rest of the city by partition and other\r\nwalls and by walling-up of thoroughfares, windows, doors, open spaces,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIt was administered by the Jewish Board of Elders, who received\r\ntheir instructions from the Commissioner for the Ghetto, who was\r\nimmediately subordinated to the Governor. The Jews were granted\r\nself-administration in which the German supervising authorities\r\nintervened only where German interests were touched. In order to enable\r\nthe Jewish Board of Elders to execute its orders, a Jewish Police force\r\nwas set up, identified by special armbands and a special beret and\r\narmed with rubber truncheons. This Jewish Police force was charged with\r\nmaintaining order and security within the Ghetto and was subordinated\r\nto the German and Polish Police.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt soon became clear, however, that not all dangers had been removed by\r\nthis confining the Jews to one place. Security considerations required\r\nremoving the Jews from the city of Warsaw altogether. The first large\r\nresettlement action took place in the period from 22 July to 3 October\r\n1942. In this action 310,322 Jews were removed. In January 1943 a\r\nsecond resettlement action was carried out by which altogether 6,500\r\nJews were affected.\r\n\r\nWhen the Reichsfuehrer SS visited Warsaw in January 1943 he ordered\r\nthe SS and Police Leader for the District of Warsaw to _transfer\r\nto Lublin the armament factories and other enterprises of military\r\nimportance which were installed within the Ghetto including their\r\npersonnel and machines_. The execution of this transfer order proved\r\nto be very difficult, since the managers as well as the Jews resisted\r\nin every possible way. The SS and Police Leader thereupon decided to\r\nenforce the transfer of the enterprises in a large-scale action which\r\nhe intended to carry out in three days. The necessary preparations had\r\nbeen taken by my predecessor, who also had given the order to start the\r\nlarge-scale action. I myself arrived in Warsaw on 17 April 1943 and\r\ntook over the command of the action on 19 April 1943, 0800 hours, the\r\naction itself having started the same day at 0600 hours.\r\n\r\nBefore the large-scale action began, the limits of the former Ghetto\r\nhad been blocked by an external barricade in order to prevent the Jews\r\nfrom breaking out. This barricade was maintained from the start to the\r\nend of the action and was especially reinforced at night.\r\n\r\nWhen we invaded the Ghetto for the first time, the Jews and the Polish\r\nbandits succeeded in repelling the participating units, including tanks\r\nand armored cars, by a well-prepared concentration of fire. When I\r\nordered a second attack, about 0800 hours, I distributed the units,\r\nseparated from each other by indicated lines, and charged them with\r\ncombing out the whole of the Ghetto, each unit for a certain part.\r\nAlthough firing commenced again, we now succeeded in combing out the\r\nblocks according to plan. The enemy was forced to retire from the roofs\r\nand elevated bases to the basements, dug-outs, and sewers. In order to\r\nprevent their escaping into the sewers, the sewerage system was dammed\r\nup below the Ghetto and filled with water, but the Jews frustrated this\r\nplan to a great extent by blowing up the turning off valves. Late the\r\nfirst day we encountered rather heavy resistance, but it was quickly\r\nbroken by a special raiding party. In the course of further operations\r\nwe succeeded in expelling the Jews from their prepared resistance\r\nbases, sniper holes, and the like, and in occupying during the 20 and\r\n21 April the greater part of the so-called remainder of the Ghetto to\r\nsuch a degree that the resistance continued within these blocks could\r\nno longer be called considerable.\r\n\r\nThe main Jewish battle group, mixed with Polish bandits, had already\r\nretired during the first and second day to the so-called Muranowski\r\nSquare. There, it was reinforced by a considerable number of Polish\r\nbandits. Its plan was to hold the Ghetto by every means in order to\r\nprevent us from invading it. The Jewish and Polish standards were\r\nhoisted at the top of a concrete building as a challenge to us. These\r\ntwo standards, however, were captured on the second day of the action\r\nby a special raiding party. SS Untersturmfuehrer Dehmke fell in this\r\nskirmish with the bandits; he was holding in his hand a hand-grenade\r\nwhich was hit by the enemy and exploded, injuring him fatally. After\r\nonly a few days I realized that the original plan had no prospect\r\nof success, unless the armament factories and other enterprises of\r\nmilitary importance distributed throughout the Ghetto were dissolved.\r\nIt was therefore necessary to approach these firms and to give them\r\nappropriate time for being evacuated and immediately transferred.\r\nThus one of these firms after the other was dealt with, and we very\r\nsoon deprived the Jews and bandits of their chance to take refuge\r\ntime and again in these enterprises, which were under the supervision\r\nof the Armed Forces. In order to decide how much time was necessary\r\nto evacuate these enterprises thorough inspections were necessary.\r\nThe conditions discovered there are indescribable. I cannot imagine\r\na greater chaos than in the Ghetto of Warsaw. The Jews had control\r\nof everything, from the chemical substances used in manufacturing\r\nexplosives to clothing and equipment for the Armed Forces. The managers\r\nknew so little of their own shops that the Jews were in a position\r\nto produce inside these shops arms of every kind, especially hand\r\ngrenades, Molotov cocktails, and the like.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Jews had succeeded in fortifying some of these factories\r\nas centers of resistance. Such a center of resistance in an Army\r\naccommodation office had to be attacked as early as the second day\r\nof the action by an Engineer's Unit equipped with flame throwers and\r\nby artillery. The Jews were so firmly established in this shop that\r\nit proved to be impossible to induce them to leave it voluntarily; I\r\ntherefore resolved to destroy this shop the next day by fire.\r\n\r\nThe managers of these enterprises, which were generally also supervised\r\nby an officer of the Armed Forces, could in most cases make no\r\nspecified statements on their stocks and the whereabouts of these\r\nstocks. The statements which they made on the number of Jews employed\r\nby them were in every case incorrect. Over and over again we discovered\r\nthat these labyrinths of edifices belonging to the armament concerns as\r\nresidential blocks, contained rich Jews who had succeeded in finding\r\naccommodations for themselves and their families under the name of\r\n\"armament workers\" and were leading marvelous lives there. Despite all\r\nour orders to the managers to make the Jews leave those enterprises,\r\nwe found out in several cases that managers simply concealed the Jews\r\nby shutting them in, because they expected that the action would\r\nbe finished within a few days and that they then would be able to\r\ncontinue working with the remaining Jews. According to the statements\r\nof arrested Jews, women also seem to have played a prominent part.\r\nThe Jews are said to have endeavored to keep up good relations with\r\nofficers and men of the armed forces. Carousing is said to have been\r\nfrequent, during the course of which business deals are said to have\r\nbeen concluded between Jews and Germans.\r\n\r\nThe number of Jews forcibly taken out of the buildings and arrested\r\nwas relatively small during the first few days. It transpired that\r\nthe Jews had taken to hiding in the sewers and in specially erected\r\ndug-outs. Whereas we had assumed during the first days that there were\r\nonly scattered dug-outs, we learned in the course of the large-scale\r\naction that the whole Ghetto was systematically equipped with cellars,\r\ndug-outs, and passages. In every case these passages and dug-outs were\r\nconnected with the sewer system. Thus, the Jews were able to maintain\r\nundisturbed subterranean traffic. They also used this sewer network for\r\nescaping subterraneously into the Aryan part of the city of Warsaw.\r\nContinuously, we received reports of attempts of Jews to escape through\r\nthe sewer holes. While pretending to build air-raid shelters they\r\nhad been erecting dug-outs within the former Ghetto ever since the\r\nautumn of 1942. These were intended to conceal every Jew during the\r\nnew evacuation action, which they had expected for quite a time, and\r\nto enable them to resist the invaders in a concerted action. Through\r\nposters, handbills, and whisper propaganda, the communistic resistance\r\nmovement actually brought it about that the Jews entered the dug-outs\r\nas soon as the new large-scale operation started. How far their\r\nprecautions went can be seen from the fact that many of the dug-outs\r\nhad been skilfully equipped with furnishings sufficient for entire\r\nfamilies, washing and bathing facilities, toilets, arms and munition\r\nsupplies, and food supplies sufficient for several months. There were\r\ndifferently equipped dug-outs for rich and for poor Jews. To discover\r\nthe individual dug-outs was difficult for the units, as they had been\r\nefficiently camouflaged. In many cases, it was possible only through\r\nbetrayal on the part of the Jews.\r\n\r\nWhen only a few days had passed, it became apparent that the Jews no\r\nlonger had any intention to resettle voluntarily, but were determined\r\nto resist evacuation with all their force and by using all the weapons\r\nat their disposal. So-called battle groups had been formed, led by\r\nPolish-Bolshevists; they were armed and paid any price asked for\r\navailable arms.\r\n\r\nDuring the large-scale action we succeeded in catching some Jews who\r\nhad already been evacuated and resettled in Lublin or Troolinka, but\r\nhad broken out from there and returned to the Ghetto, equipped with\r\narms and ammunition. Time and again Polish bandits found refuge in the\r\nGhetto and remained there undisturbed, since we had no forces at our\r\ndisposal to comb out this maze. Whereas it had been possible during\r\nthe first days to catch considerable numbers of Jews, who are cowards\r\nby nature, it became more and more difficult during the second half\r\nof the action to capture the bandits and Jews. Over and over again\r\nnew battle groups consisting of 20 to 30 or more Jewish fellows, 18\r\nto 25 years of age, accompanied by a corresponding number of women\r\nkindled new resistance. These battle groups were under orders to put\r\nup armed resistance to the last and if necessary to escape arrest by\r\ncommitting suicide. One such battle group succeeded in mounting a truck\r\nby ascending from a sewer in the so-called Prosta, and in escaping with\r\nit (about 30 to 35 bandits). One bandit who had arrived with this truck\r\nexploded 2 hand grenades, which was the agreed signal for the bandits\r\nwaiting in the sewer to climb out of it. The bandits and Jews--there\r\nwere Polish bandits among these gangs armed with carbines, small arms,\r\nand in one case a light machine gun, mounted the truck and drove away\r\nin an unknown direction. The last member of this gang, who was on guard\r\nin the sewer and was detailed to close the lid of the sewer hole, was\r\ncaptured. It was he who gave the above information. The search for the\r\ntruck was unfortunately without result.\r\n\r\nDuring this armed resistance the women belonging to the battle groups\r\nwere equipped the same as the men; some were members of the Chaluzim\r\nmovement. Not infrequently, these women fired pistols with both hands.\r\nIt happened time and again that these women had pistols or hand\r\ngrenades (Polish \"pineapple\" hand grenades) concealed in their bloomers\r\nup to the last moment to use against the men of the Waffen SS, Police,\r\nor Wehrmacht.\r\n\r\nThe resistance put up by the Jews and bandits could be broken only\r\nby relentlessly using all our force and energy by day and night. _On\r\n23 April 1943 the Reichs Fuehrer SS issued through the higher SS and\r\nPolice Fuehrer East at Cracow his order to complete the combing out of\r\nthe Warsaw Ghetto with the greatest severity and relentless tenacity._\r\nI therefore decided to destroy the entire Jewish residential area\r\nby setting every block on fire, including the blocks of residential\r\nbuildings near the armament works. One concern after the other was\r\nsystematically evacuated and subsequently destroyed by fire. The Jews\r\nthen emerged from their hiding places and dug-outs in almost every\r\ncase. Not infrequently, the Jews stayed in the burning buildings until,\r\nbecause of the heat and the fear of being burned alive they preferred\r\nto jump down from the upper stories after having thrown mattresses and\r\nother upholstered articles into the street from the burning buildings.\r\nWith their bones broken, they still tried to crawl across the street\r\ninto blocks of buildings which had not yet been set on fire or were\r\nonly partly in flames. Often Jews changed their hiding places during\r\nthe night, by moving into the ruins of burnt-out buildings, taking\r\nrefuge there until they were found by our patrols. Their stay in the\r\nsewers also ceased to be pleasant after the first week. Frequently from\r\nthe street, we could hear loud voices coming through the sewer shafts.\r\nThen the men of the Waffen SS, the Police or the Wehrmacht Engineers\r\ncourageously climbed down the shafts to bring out the Jews and not\r\ninfrequently they then stumbled over Jews already dead, or were shot\r\nat. It was always necessary to use smoke candles to drive out the Jews.\r\nThus one day we opened 183 sewer entrance holes and at a fixed time\r\nlowered smoke candles into them, with the result that the bandits fled\r\nfrom what they believed to be gas to the center of the former Ghetto,\r\nwhere they could then be pulled out of the sewer holes there. A great\r\nnumber of Jews, who could not be counted, were exterminated by blowing\r\nup sewers and dug-outs.\r\n\r\nThe longer the resistance lasted, the tougher the men of the Waffen SS,\r\nPolice, and Wehrmacht became; they fulfilled their duty indefatigably\r\nin faithful comradeship and stood together as models and examples\r\nof soldiers. Their duty hours often lasted from early morning until\r\nlate at night. At night, search patrols with rags wound round their\r\nfeet remained at the heels of the Jews and gave them no respite. Not\r\ninfrequently they caught and killed Jews who used the night hours for\r\nsupplementing their stores from abandoned dug-outs and for contacting\r\nneighboring groups or exchanging news with them.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the greater part of the men of the Waffen-SS had\r\nonly been trained for three to four weeks before being assigned to\r\nthis action, high credit should be given for the pluck, courage,\r\nand devotion to duty which they showed. It must be stated that the\r\nWehrmacht Engineers, too, executed the blowing up of dug-outs, sewers,\r\nand concrete buildings with indefatigability and great devotion to\r\nduty. Officers and men of the Police, a large part of whom had already\r\nbeen at the front, again excelled by their dashing spirit.\r\n\r\nOnly through the continuous and untiring work of all involved did we\r\nsucceed in catching a total of 56,065 Jews whose extermination can be\r\nproved. To this should be added the number of Jews who lost their lives\r\nin explosions or fires but whose numbers could not be ascertained.\r\n\r\nDuring the large-scale operation the Aryan population was informed\r\nby posters that it was strictly forbidden to enter the former Jewish\r\nGhetto and that anybody caught within the former Ghetto without valid\r\npass would be shot. At the same time these posters informed the Aryan\r\npopulation again that the death penalty would be imposed on anybody who\r\nintentionally gave refuge to a Jew, especially lodged, supported, or\r\nconcealed a Jew outside the Jewish residential area.\r\n\r\nPermission was granted to the Polish police to pay to any Polish\r\npoliceman who arrested a Jew within the Aryan part of Warsaw one third\r\nof the cash in the Jew's possession. This measure has already produced\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe Polish population for the most part approved the measures taken\r\nagainst the Jews. Shortly before the end of the large-scale operation,\r\nthe Governor issued a special proclamation which he submitted to the\r\nundersigned for approval before publication, to the Polish population;\r\nin it he informed them of the reasons for destroying the former Jewish\r\nGhetto by mentioning the assassinations carried out lately in the\r\nWarsaw area and the mass graves found in Catyn; at the same time they\r\nwere asked to assist us in our fight against Communist agents and Jews\r\n(see enclosed poster).\r\n\r\nThe large-scale action was terminated on 16 May 1943 with the blowing\r\nup of the Warsaw synagogue at 2015 hours.\r\n\r\nNow, there are no more factories in the former Ghetto. All the goods,\r\nraw materials, and machines there have been moved and stored somewhere\r\nelse. All buildings etc., have been destroyed. The only exception is\r\nthe so-called Dzielna Prison of the Security Police, which was exempted\r\nfrom destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAlthough the large-scale operation has been completed, we have to\r\nreckon with the possibility that a few Jews are still living in the\r\nruins of the former Ghetto; therefore, this area must be firmly shut\r\noff from the Aryan residential area and be guarded. Police Battalion\r\nIII/23 has been charged with this duty. This Police Battalion has\r\ninstructions to watch the former Ghetto, particularly to prevent\r\nanybody from entering the former Ghetto, and to shoot immediately\r\nanybody found inside the Ghetto without authority. The Commander of\r\nthe Police Battalion will continue to receive further direct orders\r\nfrom the SS and Police Fuehrer. In this way, it should be possible to\r\nkeep the small remainder of Jews there, if any, under constant pressure\r\nand to exterminate them eventually. The remaining Jews and bandits\r\nmust be deprived of any chance of survival by destroying all remaining\r\nbuildings and refuges and cutting off the water supply.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to change the Dzielna Prison into a concentration camp\r\nand to use the inmates to remove, collect and hand over for reuse the\r\nmillions of bricks, the scrap-iron, and other materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOf the total of 56,065 Jews caught, about 7,000 were exterminated\r\nwithin the former Ghetto in the course of the large-scale action,\r\nand 6,929 by transporting them to T.II, which means 14,000 Jews were\r\nexterminated altogether. Beyond the number of 56,065 Jews an estimated\r\nnumber of 5,000 to 6,000 were killed by explosions or in fires.\r\n\r\nThe number of destroyed dug-outs amounts to 631.\r\n\r\n  _Booty_:\r\n\r\n 7 Polish rifles, 1 Russian rifle, 1 German rifle\r\n\r\n 59 pistols of various calibers\r\n\r\n Several hundred hand grenades, including Polish and home-made ones\r\n\r\n Several hundred incendiary bottles\r\n\r\n Home-made explosives\r\n\r\n Infernal machines with fuses\r\n\r\n A large amount of explosives, ammunition for weapons of all calibers,\r\n including some machine-gun ammunition.\r\n\r\nRegarding the booty of arms, it must be taken into consideration that\r\nthe arms themselves could in most cases not be captured, as the bandits\r\nand Jews would, before being arrested, throw them into hiding places or\r\nholes which could not be ascertained or discovered. The smoking out of\r\nthe dug-out by our men, also often made the search for arms impossible.\r\nAs the dug-outs had to be blown up at once, a search later on was out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nThe captured hand grenades, ammunition, and incendiary bottles were at\r\nonce reused by us against the bandits.\r\n\r\n  _Further booty_:\r\n\r\n 1,240 used military tunics (part of them with medal ribbons--Iron\r\n Cross and East Medal)\r\n\r\n 600 pairs of used trousers\r\n\r\n Other equipment and German steel helmets\r\n\r\n 108 horses, 4 of them still in the former Ghetto (hearse)\r\n\r\n  Up to 23 May 1943 we had counted:\r\n\r\n4.4 million Zloty; furthermore about 5 to 6 million Zloty not yet\r\ncounted, a great amount of foreign currency, e.g. $14,300 in paper and\r\n$9,200 in gold, moreover valuables (rings, chains, watches, etc.) in\r\ngreat quantities.\r\n\r\nState of the Ghetto at the termination of the large-scale operation:\r\n\r\nApart from 8 buildings (Police Barracks, hospital, and accommodations\r\nfor housing working-parties) the former Ghetto is completely destroyed.\r\nOnly the dividing walls are left standing where no explosions were\r\ncarried out. But the ruins still contain a vast amount of stones and\r\nscrap material which could be used.\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 16 May, 1943.\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer in the\r\n  District of Warsaw.\r\n  SS Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 20 April 1943.\r\n  Journal No. 516/43 secret.\r\n\r\n  (Daily reports)\r\n\r\n  SS Service Teletype message\r\n\r\n  _From: The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw_\r\n  Ref.

At 0600 order to Waffen-SS\r\n(strength: 16/850) to comb out the remainder of the Ghetto. Hardly\r\nhad the units fallen in, strong concerted fire-concentration by the\r\nJews and bandits. The tank used in this action and the two heavy\r\narmored cars pelted with Molotov cocktails (incendiary bottles). Tank\r\ntwice set on fire. Owing to this enemy counterattack, we had at first\r\nto take the units back. Losses in first attack: 12 men (6 SS-men, 6\r\nTrawniki-men). About 800 hrs. second attack by the units, under the\r\ncommand of the undersigned. Although the counterattack was reported,\r\nthis time we succeeded in combing out the blocks of buildings according\r\nto plan. We caused the enemy to retire from the roofs and elevated\r\nprepared positions into the cellars or dug-outs and sewers. During\r\nthis combing-out we caught only about 200 Jews. Immediately afterwards\r\nraiding parties were directed to dug-outs known to us with the order\r\nto pull out the Jews and to destroy the dug-outs. About 380 Jews\r\ncaptured. We found out that the Jews had taken to the sewers. Sewers\r\nwere completely inundated, to make staying there impossible. About 1730\r\nhrs. we encountered very strong resistance from one block of buildings\r\nincluding machine-gun fire. A special raiding party invaded that block\r\nand defeated the enemy, but could not catch the resisters. The Jews and\r\ncriminals resisted from base to base, and escaped at the last moment\r\nacross lofts or through subterranean passages. About 2030 hrs. the\r\nexternal barricade was reinforced. All units were withdrawn from the\r\nGhetto and dismissed to their barracks. Reinforcement of the barricade\r\nby 250 Waffen-SS men.

This search is still in progress; its first\r\nobjective will be completed by 1100 hrs. In the meantime it has been\r\nascertained that part of the Ghetto which is no longer inhabited but\r\nnot yet released and which contains several armament factories and the\r\nlike, there are several centers of resistance, which were so strong\r\nthat the tank could not go through. 2 raiding parties defeated these\r\ncenters of resistance and made a passage for the tank men. In this\r\noperation we already had two wounded (Waffen-SS).\r\n\r\nEnemy is much more cautious than yesterday, since he has of course\r\nlearned of the heavy arms at our disposal.\r\n\r\nMy intention is first to comb out completely the remainder of the\r\nGhetto and then to clean out in the same manner the so-called\r\nuninhabited Ghetto, which so far has not been released. It had been\r\nascertained in the meantime that the latter part of the Ghetto contains\r\nat least 10 to 12 dug-outs, some of which are even in armament\r\nfactories. The whole operation is made more difficult because there\r\nare still factories in the Ghetto which must be protected against\r\nbombardment and fire, because they contain machines and tools.\r\n\r\nA further report will follow tonight.\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  /s/ Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n  Certified copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From the SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n  Warsaw, 20 April 1943.\r\n\r\n Ref.

St/Gr 16 07,\r\n re Ghetto Operation--I beg to report as follows:\r\n\r\nThe resistance centers ascertained with the uninhabited but not yet\r\nreleased part of the Ghetto were crushed by a battle group of the\r\nWehrmacht--Engineers and flame throwers. The Wehrmacht had one wounded\r\nin this operation, shot through the lungs. Nine raiding parties broke\r\nthrough as far as the northern limit of the Ghetto. 9 dug-outs were\r\nfound, their inmates crushed when they resisted, and the dug-outs blown\r\nup. What losses the enemy suffered cannot be ascertained accurately.\r\nAltogether the 9 raiding parties caught 505 Jews today; those among\r\nthem who are able-bodied were kept ready for transport to Poniatowo.\r\nAt about 1500 hrs. I managed to arrange that the block of buildings\r\noccupied by the Army Accommodation Office said to be occupied by 4,000\r\nJews is to be evacuated at once. The German manager was asked to call\r\nupon the Jewish workers to leave the block voluntarily. Only 28 Jews\r\nobeyed this order. Thereupon I resolved either to evacuate the block by\r\nforce or to blow it up. The A.A. Artillery--3 2-cm. guns used for this\r\noperation had two men killed. The 10-cm howitzer, which also was used,\r\nexpelled the gangs from their strong fortifications and also inflicted\r\nlosses on them, as far as we were able to ascertain. This action had to\r\nbe broken off owing to the fall of darkness. On 21 April 1943 we shall\r\nattack this resistance center again, as far as possible it will remain\r\nblocked off during the night.\r\n\r\nIn today's action we caught, apart from the Jews reported above,\r\nconsiderable stores of incendiary bottles, hand grenades, ammunition,\r\nmilitary tunics, and equipment.\r\n\r\n  _Losses_:\r\n  2 dead (Wehrmacht)\r\n  7 wounded (6 Waffen SS, 1 Trawniki-man)\r\n\r\nIn one case the bandits had laid pressure mines. I have succeeded in\r\ncausing the firms W.C. Toebens, Schultz and Co., and Hoffman to be\r\nready for evacuation with their entire personnel on 21 April 1943 at\r\n0600 hrs. In this way, I hope to get the way free at last for cleaning\r\nout the Ghetto. The Trustees Toebens has pledged himself to induce the\r\nJews, numbering about 4,000 to 5,000, to follow him voluntarily to\r\nthe assembling point for being resettled. In case this has as little\r\nsuccess as was attained in the case of the Army Accommodation Office,\r\nI am going to clean out this part of the Ghetto as well by force.

The whole of the Ghetto has continued to\r\nbe cordoned off since the start of the operations on 19 April 1943.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the special operation concerning the block of buildings\r\noccupied by the Army Accommodation Office had to be interrupted\r\nyesterday because of darkness, one battle group reinforced by Engineers\r\nand heavy artillery was again sent into the block of buildings, which\r\nwas found to contain an enormous quantity of dug-outs and subterranean\r\npassages firing from time to time. I resolved therefore to blow up\r\nthese passages which we had discovered and subsequently to set the\r\nentire block on fire. Not until the building was well aflame did\r\nscreaming Jews make their appearance, and they were evacuated at once.\r\nWe had no losses in this operation. Precautionary measures were taken\r\nin order to ensure that the conflagration remained localized.\r\n\r\nThe main body of our forces was detailed to cleanse the so-called\r\nuninhabited, but not yet released, part of the Ghetto by proceeding\r\nfrom South to North. Before we started this action, we caught 5,200\r\nJews who had been employed in enterprises under the supervision of the\r\nCommissioner for Armament [Ru Ko-Betrieben] and transported them under\r\narmed guard to the Railway Station which had been chosen for use in the\r\nresettlement. I formed 3 search-parties to which were attached special\r\nraiding parties who had the duty to attack or blow up the dug-outs\r\nwhich were known to us. This operation had to be interrupted when\r\ndarkness set in, after one half of the area mentioned had been combed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nContinued on 22 April 1943, 0700 hrs.\r\n\r\nApart from the Jews who were to be evacuated, 150 Jews or bandits were\r\nkilled in battle and about 80 bandits were killed when their dug-outs\r\nwere blown up. The enemy today used the same arms as on the previous\r\nday, particularly home-made explosives. Samples have been kept by the\r\nSS and Police Fuehrer. For the first time we observed the participation\r\nof members of the Jewish Women's Battle Association (Chaluzim\r\nMovement). We captured rifles, pistols, hand grenades, explosives,\r\nhorses, and parts of SS uniforms.\r\n\r\n  Own losses: 2 policemen, 2 SS-men, 1 Trawniki-man.\r\n  (light wounds)\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n  in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n\r\n  Certified copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From the SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n  Warsaw, 22 April 1943.\r\n\r\n _Ref._ No. I ab St/Gr 16 07--Journal Nr. 530/43 secret.\r\n\r\n _Re_: Ghetto Operation.

Masses of them--entire families--were already\r\naflame and jumped from the windows or endeavored to let themselves down\r\nby means of sheets tied together or the like. Steps had been taken so\r\nthat these Jews as well as the remaining ones were liquidated at once.\r\nDuring the whole night there were shots from buildings which were\r\nsupposed to be evacuated.

When\r\nshooting again started from one block against the men of the Waffen-SS,\r\nthis block also was set on fire, with the result that a considerable\r\nnumber of bandits were scared from their hideouts and shot while trying\r\nto escape. Apart for those, we caught about 180 Jews in the yards of\r\nthe buildings. The main body of our units continued the cleansing\r\naction from the line where we terminated this action yesterday.\r\nThis operation is still in progress. As on the preceding days local\r\nresistance was broken and the dug-outs we discovered were blown up.\r\nUnfortunately there is no way of preventing part of the Jews and\r\nbandits from taking refuge in the sewers below the Ghetto, where we\r\ncan hardly catch them since they have stopped the flooding. The city\r\nadministration is not in a position to frustrate this nuisance. Neither\r\ndid the use of smoke candles or the introduction of creosote into the\r\nwater have the desired result.

Start: 0700 hours.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the former Ghetto had been divided for the purposes of\r\ntoday's combing-out operations into 24 districts. One reinforced\r\nsearching party was detailed to each district with special orders.\r\nThese assignments had to be carried out by 1600 hours.\r\n\r\nResult of this action: 600 Jews and bandits ferreted out and captured,\r\nabout 200 Jews and bandits killed, 48 dug-outs, some of them of a quite\r\nelaborate character, blown up. We captured apart from valuables and\r\nmoney--some gas masks.\r\n\r\nThe units had been informed that we intended to terminate the operation\r\ntoday. In the morning the Jews had already become aware of this\r\ninstruction. This is why a renewed search by the searching parties was\r\nundertaken after an interval of 1 to 1-1/2 hours. The result was, as\r\nalways, that again Jews and bandits were discovered to be in various\r\nblocks. From one block shots were even fired against the cordoning\r\nunits. An attack by a special battle group was ordered and in order to\r\nsmoke the bandits out, every building was now set on fire. The Jews\r\nand bandits held out, every building was now set on fire. The Jews and\r\nbandits held their fire up to the last moment and then concerted their\r\nfire against the units. They even used carbines. A number of bandits\r\nwho were shooting from balconies were hit by our men and crashed down.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, today we discovered a place said to have been the\r\nheadquarters of the \"P PR\"; we found it unoccupied and destroyed it.\r\nIt was on this 5th day of operations that obviously we found the worst\r\nof the terrorists and activists, who so far had always found ways and\r\nmeans to dodge every searching or evacuation action.\r\n\r\nA racial German reported that again some Jews had escaped through the\r\nsewers into the Aryan part of the city. We learned from a traitor that\r\nthere were some Jews in a certain house. A special motorized raiding\r\nparty invaded the building and caught 3 Jews, 2 of them females. During\r\nthis operation their motor-car was pelted with one incendiary bottle\r\nand one explosive; 2 policemen were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation is rendered more difficult by the cunning way in\r\nwhich the Jews and bandits act; for instance, we discover that the\r\nhearses which were used to collect the corpses lying around at the\r\nsame time bring living Jews to the Jewish cemetery, and thus they are\r\nenabled to escape from the Ghetto. Now this way of escape also is\r\nbarred by continuous control of the hearses.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of today's operation about 2200 hours, we discovered\r\nthat again about 30 bandits had passed into a so-called armaments\r\nfactory, where they had found refuge. Since the forces are storing\r\ngoods of great value in this enterprise, this factory was requested\r\nto evacuate the building by noon on 24 April; this will enable us to\r\ncleanse that labyrinth of a building tomorrow.\r\n\r\nToday 3,500 Jews were caught who are to be evacuated from the\r\nfactories. A total of 19,450 Jews have been caught for resettlement or\r\nalready evacuated up to today. Of these about 2,500 Jews are still to\r\nbe loaded. The next train will start on 24 April 1943.\r\n\r\nStrength as of 22 April 1943, without 150 Trawniki men; these\r\nhave already been put at the disposal of the Eastern Command as\r\nreinforcement for another assignment.\r\n\r\n  _Our losses_:\r\n\r\n  2 Police corporals (\"SB\") wounded\r\n  1 Trawniki man wounded.\r\n\r\nThe operation will be continued on 24 April 1943, 1000 hours. This hour\r\nwas chosen so that Jews who may still be in the Ghetto will believe\r\nthat the operation was actually terminated today.\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n  in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Major general of Police.\r\n\r\n  Certified copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 24 April 1943.\r\n\r\n Ref.

Apparently the Jews still in the\r\nGhetto were deceived by the fact that the operation did not start until\r\n1000 hours into believing that the action really had been terminated\r\nyesterday. The search action, therefore, had especially satisfactory\r\nresults today. This success is furthermore due to the fact that the\r\nnoncommissioned officers and men have meanwhile become accustomed to\r\nthe cunning fighting, methods and tricks used by the Jews and bandits\r\nand that they have acquired great skill in tracking down the dug-outs\r\nwhich are found in such great number. The raiding parties having\r\nreturned, we set about to clean a certain block of buildings, situated\r\nin the north-eastern part of the former Ghetto. In this labyrinth of\r\nbuildings there was a so-called armaments firm which reportedly had\r\ngoods worth millions for manufacture and storage. I had notified the\r\nWehrmacht of my intentions on 23 April 1943 about 2100 hours, and had\r\nrequested them to remove their goods by 1200 hours. Since the Wehrmacht\r\ndid not start this evacuation until 1000 hours I felt obliged to\r\nextend the term until 1800 hours. At 1815 hours a search party entered\r\nthe premises, the building having been cordoned off, and found that\r\na great number of Jews were within the building. Since some of these\r\nJews resisted, I ordered the building to be set on fire. Not until all\r\nthe buildings along the street and the back premises on either side\r\nwere well aflame did the Jews, some of them on fire, emerge from these\r\nblocks, some of them endeavored to save their life by jumping into\r\nthe street from windows and balconies, after having thrown down beds,\r\nblankets, and the like. Over and over again we observed that Jews and\r\nbandits, despite the danger of being burned alive, preferred to return\r\ninto the flames rather than risk being caught by us. Over and over\r\nagain the Jews kept up their firing almost to the end of the action;\r\nthus the engineers had to be protected by a machine gun when toward\r\nnightfall they had to enter forcibly a concrete building which had been\r\nvery strongly fortified. Termination of today's operation; on 25 April\r\n1943 at 0145 hours. 1,660 Jews were caught for evacuation, 1,814 pulled\r\nout of dug-outs, about 330 shot. Innumerable Jews were destroyed by the\r\nflames or perished when the dug-outs were blown up. 26 dug-outs were\r\nblown up and an amount of paper money, especially dollars was captured;\r\nthis money has not yet been counted.\r\n\r\nOur forces: as on the preceding day, minus 50 men of the Waffen-SS.\r\n\r\nOur losses: 2 SS men and 1 Trawniki man wounded.\r\n\r\nAltogether there have now been caught in this action 25,500 Jews who\r\nlived in the former Ghetto. Since there are only vague estimates\r\navailable of the actual number of inhabitants I assume that now only\r\nvery small numbers of Jews and bandits still remain within the Ghetto.\r\n\r\nOperation will be continued on 25 April 1943, 1300 hours.\r\n\r\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of teletype messages Nos. 1222 and 1223\r\nof 24 April 1943. As far as can be predicted, the present large-scale\r\noperation will last until Easter Monday inclusive.\r\n\r\nToday large posters were affixed to the walls surrounding the Ghetto,\r\nannouncing that everybody who enters the former Ghetto without being\r\nable to prove his identity will be shot.\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n  in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Major General of Police.\r\n\r\n  Certified copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From: The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 25 April 1943\r\n\r\n Ref.

If any resistance is encountered or if dug-outs cannot\r\nbe reached, the buildings are to be burnt down.\" Apart from the\r\noperations undertaken by these 7 search parties, a special operation\r\nwas undertaken against a center of bandits, situated outside the wall\r\nsurrounding the former Ghetto and inhabited exclusively by Poles.\r\n\r\nToday's operations of the search parties ended almost everywhere in\r\nthe starting of enormous conflagrations. In this manner the Jews were\r\nforced to leave their hideouts and refuges. A total of 1,960 Jews\r\nwere caught alive. The Jews informed us that among them were certain\r\nparachutists who were dropped here and bandits who had been equipped\r\nwith arms from some unknown source. 274 Jews were killed. As in the\r\npreceding days, uncounted Jews were buried in blown up dug-outs and, as\r\ncan be observed time and again, burned with this bag of Jews today. We\r\nhave, in my opinion, caught a very considerable part of the bandits and\r\nlowest elements of the Ghetto. Intervening darkness prevented immediate\r\nliquidation. I am going to try to obtain a train for T II tomorrow.\r\nOtherwise liquidation will be carried out tomorrow. Today also, some\r\narmed resistance was encountered; in a dug-out three pistols and some\r\nexplosives were captured. Furthermore, considerable amounts of paper\r\nmoney, foreign currency, gold coins, and jewelry were seized today.\r\n\r\nThe Jews still have considerable property. While last night a glare\r\nof fire could be seen above the former Ghetto, today one can observe\r\na giant sea of flames. Since we continue to discover great numbers of\r\nJews whenever we search and comb out, the operation will be continued\r\non 26 April 1943. Start: 1000 hours.\r\n\r\nIncluding today, a total of 27,464 Jews of the former Warsaw Ghetto,\r\nhave been captured.\r\n\r\nOur forces: as on the previous day.\r\n\r\n Our losses: 3 members of the Waffen-SS and one member of the Security\r\n Police wounded.\r\n\r\n  _Total losses up to date_:\r\n\r\n         Waffen SS                                 27 Wounded\r\n         Police                                     9 Wounded\r\n         Security Police                            4 Wounded\r\n         Wehrmacht                                  1 Wounded\r\n         Trawniki men                               9 Wounded\r\n                                                  -----------\r\n                                                   50 Wounded\r\n\r\n  and 5 dead:\r\n\r\n         Waffen SS                                    2 Dead\r\n         Wehrmacht                                    2 Dead\r\n         Trawniki men                                 1 Dead\r\n                                                    --------\r\n                                                      5 Dead\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n  in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n\r\n  Certified copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From: The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 26 April 1943.\r\n\r\n Ref.

The operation on 25 April 1943, was terminated at 2200 hrs.\r\n\r\n2. General effects of the execution of this operation.\r\n\r\nThe Poles resident in Warsaw are much impressed by the toughness of our\r\noperations in the former Ghetto. As can be seen from the daily reports,\r\nthe general situation has greatly calmed down since the beginning of\r\nthat operation within the city area of Warsaw. From this fact one may\r\nconclude that the bandits and saboteurs resided in the former Ghetto,\r\nand that now all of them have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the fact may be of some interest, that an illegal\r\nammunition store was seen to explode when we burned down a certain\r\nbuilding in the dwelling area on which we were working at the time.\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer\r\n  in the District of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n\r\n  Certified Copy:\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From: The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n\r\n  Warsaw, 26 April 1943.\r\n\r\n Ref. Nr.: I ab/St/Wdt--16 07 Journal Nr. 551/43 secret.\r\n\r\n To: The Higher SS and Police Fuehrer East, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer and\r\n General of Police _Krueger_--or deputy.\r\n\r\n _Cracow_\r\n\r\nStart of operation: 1000 hrs.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the former Ghetto was once more combed through today by\r\nthe same search parties, each of them allotted to the same district as\r\nbefore. In this way I tried to bring about that the leaders of these\r\nparties work in thoroughfares, blocks of buildings, and courtyards\r\nwhich they know already and that thus they are able to penetrate deeper\r\nand deeper into the maze of dug-outs and subterranean passages. Almost\r\nevery search party reported resistance, which however they broke either\r\nby returning fire or by blowing up the dug-outs. It becomes clearer\r\nand clearer that it is now the turn of the toughest and strongest\r\namong the Jews and bandits. Several times dug-outs have been forcibly\r\nbroken open, the inmates of which had not come to the surface during\r\nthe whole of this operation. In a number of cases the inmates of the\r\ndug-outs were hardly in a condition, when the dug-out had been blown\r\nup, to crawl to the surface. The captured Jews report that many of the\r\ninmates of the dug-outs became insane from the heat, the smoke, and\r\nthe explosions. Several Jews were arrested who had kept close liaison\r\nwith the group of Polish terrorists and collaborated with it. Outside\r\nthe former Ghetto we arrested 29 Jews. During today's operation several\r\nblocks of buildings were burned down. This is the only and final method\r\nwhich forces this trash and subhumanity to the surface. We again\r\ncaptured arms, incendiary bottles, explosive charges and considerable\r\namounts of cash and foreign currency. Today I also arranged that\r\nseveral so-called armament and defense enterprises will evacuate their\r\nstores from the buildings at once, so that these buildings in which the\r\nJews now have taken refuge, under the protection of the army of the\r\nGerman Wehrmacht and police, can be combed out. In one case we again\r\ndiscovered, as previously, that in a building which had been said to\r\ncontain a giant enterprise there existed in fact almost no stores or\r\ngoods. One factory was closed without further ado, and the Jews were\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\nResult of today's operation:\r\n\r\n30 Jews evacuated, 1,330 Jews pulled out of dug-outs and immediately\r\ndestroyed, 362 Jews killed in battle. Caught today altogether: 1,722\r\nJews. This brings the total of Jews caught to 29,186. Moreover, it is\r\nvery probable that numerous Jews have perished in the 13 dug-outs blown\r\nup today and in the conflagrations.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing not one of the Jews caught still remains within\r\nWarsaw. The scheduled transport to T. II had no success. [Note of\r\ntranslator: This probably means that no Jews were available for regular\r\ntransport to the extermination camp.]\r\n\r\n  Strength: as on preceding day.\r\n\r\n  Our losses: none.\r\n\r\nEnd of today's operation at 2145 hrs.

Start: 0900 hrs.\r\n\r\nFor today's operation I formed 24 raiding parties with the same task as\r\non several days of last week; they had to search the former Ghetto in\r\nsmaller groups. These search parties pulled 780 Jews out of dug-outs\r\nand shot 115 Jews who resisted. This operation was terminated about\r\n1500 hrs.; some of the parties had to continue to operate because they\r\nhad found more dug-outs.\r\n\r\nAt 1600 hrs. a special battle group, 320 officers and men strong,\r\nstarted cleansing a large block of buildings situated on both sides\r\nof the so-called Niska Street in the Northeastern part of the former\r\nGhetto. After the search the entire block was set on fire, after having\r\nbeen completely cordoned off. In this action a considerable number of\r\nJews were caught. As before, they remained in the dug-outs, which were\r\neither below the ground or in the lofts of the buildings until the end.\r\nThey fired their arms to the last moment, and then jumped down into the\r\nstreet, sometimes from as far up as the fourth floor, having previously\r\nthrown down beds, mattresses, etc., but not until the flames made any\r\nother escape impossible. A total of 2,560 Jews were caught today within\r\nthe former Ghetto, of whom 547 were shot. Moreover, Jews in a not\r\nascertainable number perished when dug-outs were blown up, or in the\r\nflames. The sum total of Jews, formerly residing in the Ghetto caught\r\nin this action, now amounts to 31,746.\r\n\r\nWe learned from an anonymous letter that there were a considerable\r\nnumber of Jews in a block of buildings adjoining the Northeastern\r\npart of the Ghetto, but outside of it. A special raiding party under\r\nthe command of 1st. Lt. of Police Diehl was dispatched to attack\r\nthese buildings. The raiding party discovered a gang of about 120\r\nmen, strongly armed with pistols, rifles, hand grenades, and light\r\nmachine guns, who resisted. They succeeded in destroying 24 bandits\r\nin battle and arresting 52 bandits. The remainder could not be caught\r\nor destroyed, since darkness intervened. The buildings, however, were\r\nsurrounded at once, so that an escape will hardly be possible. This\r\ncleansing action will be continued tomorrow. Moreover, we arrested\r\n17 Poles, among whom 2 Polish Policemen, who should have been aware,\r\namong other things, of the existence of this gang. In this operation we\r\ncaptured 3 rifles, 12 pistols, partly of heavier caliber, 100 Polish\r\n\"pineapple\" hand grenades, 27 German steel helmets, quite a number\r\nof German uniforms, tunics and coats which were even furnished with\r\nribbon of the East medal, some reserve magazines for machine guns,\r\n300 rounds of ammunition, etc. The leader of the raiding party had a\r\ndifficult task because the bandits were disguised in German uniform,\r\nbut despite this fact, he did his duty with great efficiency. Among the\r\nbandits who were caught or killed, there were some Polish terrorists\r\nwho were identified with certainty. Today we succeeded furthermore in\r\ndiscovering and liquidating one of the founders and leaders of the\r\nJewish-Polish resistance movement. The external appearance of the Jews\r\nwhom we are catching now shows that it is now the turn of those Jews\r\nwho were the leaders of the entire resistance movement. They jumped\r\nfrom the burning windows and balconies, abusing Germany and the Fuehrer\r\nand cursing the German soldiers.\r\n\r\nSS-men who descended into the sewers discovered that a great number of\r\ncorpses of perished Jews are being washed away by the water.\r\n\r\n  _Our strength_:\r\n\r\n                               288 German Police }\r\n                               200 Trawniki-men  }\r\n      From 0700 to 1900 hrs.   140 Polish Police } Cordoning\r\n      From 1900 to 0700 hrs.   288 German Police } forces.\r\n                               250 Waffen-SS     }\r\n                               140 Polish Police }\r\n\r\n  _Strength in the operation_:\r\n\r\n        3/115 German Police\r\n        4/400 Waffen-SS\r\n        1/6   Engineering Serv.\r\n        2/30  Security Police\r\n        2/21  Engineers.\r\n\r\n  _Our losses_:\r\n\r\n        3 wounded:\r\n        2 Waffen-SS\r\n        1 Trawniki-man\r\n\r\nTermination of operation: 2300 hrs.

Start 1000 hrs.\r\n\r\nToday, 10 raiding parties were formed for combing out the whole of\r\nthe Ghetto. These raiding parties again discovered proceeding step by\r\nstep, a number of dug-outs, which were found to have been prepared as\r\nfar ago as the middle of last year for use in the resistance of the\r\nJews. A total of 335 Jews were forcibly pulled out of these dug-outs.\r\nApart from these operations, we continued to cleanse the resistance\r\ncenter used by the Jewish military organization, situated at the\r\nborders of the Ghetto. We succeeded in shooting 10 more bandits, and\r\nin arresting 9, beyond those caught yesterday, and in capturing more\r\narms, ammunition, and military equipment. In the afternoon a battle\r\ngroup again was directed against a block of buildings which had already\r\nbeen combed out; the block was set on fire during this operation. As\r\non previous days, masses of Jews emerged, forced out by the flames and\r\nthe enormous clouds of smoke. At another point an Engineer officer,\r\nattached by the Wehrmacht to the units with great trouble opened a\r\ndug-out situated about 3 meters below ground. From this dug-out, which\r\nhad been ready since October of last year and was equipped with running\r\nwater, toilet, and electric light, we pulled out 274 of the richest\r\nand most influential Jews. Today again we encountered very strong\r\nresistance in many places and broke it. It becomes clearer every day\r\nthat we are now encountering the real terrorists and activists, because\r\nof the duration of the operation.\r\n\r\nResult of today: 1,655 Jews caught for evacuation, of whom 110 were\r\nkilled in battle.\r\n\r\nMany more Jews were killed by the flames; moreover, Jews in an\r\nunascertainable number were destroyed by the dug-outs being blown up.\r\nBy the results of today the number of Jews caught or destroyed rises\r\nto 33,401 altogether. This number does not include the Jews who were\r\nkilled by fire or destroyed in the dug-outs.\r\n\r\n  Our strength: as on the previous day.\r\n  Our losses: 3 wounded (1 Police, 2 Waffen-SS)\r\n\r\nTermination of operation: 2200 hrs.

Start 1000 hrs.\r\nAs on the previous day I formed search parties, who had the special\r\ntask of searching those blocks of buildings which had been recently\r\nseparated. A larger raiding party was detailed to clean a certain block\r\nof buildings (formerly the Hallmann concern) and to burn this block\r\ndown. 36 more dug-outs used for habitation were discovered altogether,\r\nand from them and other hideouts and from the burning buildings, 2,359\r\nJews were caught, of whom 106 were killed in battle.\r\n\r\nCaptured are 2 rifles, 10 pistols, 10 kilograms of explosives, and\r\nammunition of various types.\r\n\r\nWhen a large dug-out was blown up, the entire building collapsed\r\nand everyone of the bandits perished. In the ensuing conflagration\r\nloud detonations and darting flames showed that the building must\r\nhave contained large stores of ammunition and explosives. Some sewer\r\nentrances were blown up. Two exits discovered outside the Ghetto were\r\nalso made unusable by blowing them up or walling them up.\r\n\r\nThe depositions of some of the inmates of the dug-outs are to the\r\neffect that these Jews have been unable to leave the dug-outs for the\r\nlast 10 days and that their food, etc., is now beginning to grow short\r\nbecause the large-scale operation has lasted so long. Furthermore, the\r\nJews testify that bandits appeared at night who were Jews or sometimes\r\nPoles, wearing black masks, who walled the dug-outs up from the outside\r\nand admonished them not to give any signs of life, so that they could\r\ncontinue to live in the Ghetto when the action was finished. Some of\r\nthe armaments factories are being evacuated very slowly. In several\r\ncases one gains the impression that this is done intentionally. Thus I\r\ndiscovered with regard to one firm, Schulz and Co., which I had visited\r\non Easter Monday and then instructed to start evacuation at once and to\r\nhave it completed within 3 days, that up till today, Thursday, nothing\r\nhad been done.\r\n\r\n  _Our strength_: as on the previous day.\r\n  _Our losses_: none.\r\n\r\nTermination of operation at 2100 hrs.

Start 0900 hrs.\r\n\r\nCombing out by search parties was continued. Although some giant blocks\r\nof buildings now are completely burned out, the Jews continue to stay\r\nin the dug-outs 2 to 3 meters below ground. In many cases we are not\r\nable to discover those dug-outs unless some Jew, whom we have already\r\ncaught, gives us a hint as to their whereabouts. Repeatedly, during\r\nthe last few days, Jews have testified that some armed Jews emerge at\r\nnight from some hideouts or dug-outs and threaten the other Jews with\r\nshooting if they give any signs of life. We were able to ascertain\r\nbeyond all doubt that several dug-outs had been closed from the outside\r\nby these bandits, who tried in this manner to prove that they meant\r\nbusiness. Altogether, 30 dug-outs were discovered, evacuated, and blown\r\nup today. Again we caught a great number of bandits and subhumans.\r\nApart from the bombing-out operations effected by small parties, two\r\nlarger battle groups were occupied with bombing out and destroying by\r\nfire several inter-connected blocks of buildings.\r\n\r\nA total of 1599 Jews were caught today, of whom 179 were killed in\r\nbattle. The sum total of Jews caught up to date thereby rises to\r\n37,359. 3,855 Jews were loaded today. The number of Jews in possession\r\nof arms was much higher than before among the Jews caught during the\r\nlast few days. Today, we again captured arms and particularly parts\r\nof German uniforms from them. The operation against Fort Traugutta\r\ndid not have any positive results.

Start 0900 hrs.\r\n\r\n10 searching parties were detailed, moreover a larger battle group\r\nwas detailed to comb out a certain block of buildings, with the added\r\ninstruction to burn that block down. Within this block of buildings\r\nthere existed a so-called armament factory which had not yet been\r\nentirely evacuated, although it had had enough time to do so. It was\r\nnot exempted from the operation. Today's operation a total of 1,026\r\nJews were caught, of whom 245 were killed, either in battle or while\r\nresisting. Moreover, a considerable number of bandits and ringleaders\r\nwere also caught. In one case a Jew who had already been made ready\r\nfor transport fired three shots against a 1st Lieutenant of Police,\r\nbut missed his mark. All the Jews caught today were forcibly pulled\r\nout of dug-outs. Not a single one gave himself up voluntarily, after\r\nhis dug-out had been opened. A considerable part of the Jews caught\r\nwere pulled out of the sewers. We continued systematically blowing up\r\nor blocking up the sewer entrances. In one case the Engineers laid a\r\nstrong concentrated charge and had to proceed to an adjoining entrance\r\nwhere they had something to do. In the meantime a Jew emerged from the\r\nsewer, removed the fuse from the concentrated charge, and appropriated\r\nthe charge. In the further course of this operation we succeeded in\r\ncatching the Jew, still in possession of the concentrated charge.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the movements of the Jews during the night, today\r\nI used for the first time 5 scouting parties, each 1/9 strong, at\r\nirregular intervals during the night. In general, it has to be stated\r\nthat our men need extraordinary diligence and energy to discover the\r\nJews who are still in so-called dug-outs, caves, and in the sewerage\r\nsystem. It can be expected that the remainder of the Jews who formerly\r\ninhabited the Ghetto will now be caught. The sum total of Jews caught\r\nso far has risen to 38,385. Not included in this figure are those\r\nwho died in the flames or in the dug-outs. One patrol discovered an\r\nunascertainable number of corpses floating in a main sewer under the\r\nGhetto. Outside of the Ghetto, in the immediate vicinity of Warsaw, the\r\ngendarmerie has shot a total of 150 Jews who could be proved to have\r\nescaped from Warsaw.\r\n\r\nAgain we captured pistols and explosives.\r\n\r\n  _Our strength, used in operation_:\r\n      Police (German)                   4/102\r\n      Waffen SS                         7/350\r\n      Engineers (Wehrmacht)             2/38\r\n      Engineering Emergency Service     1/6\r\n      Security Police                   2/1\r\n  _Cordoning units_:\r\n      Waffen SS                         300\r\n      German Police                     1/71\r\n      Trawniki                          250\r\n  _Our losses_: 1 policeman--wounded yesterday, died from wounds.\r\n\r\nTermination of today's large-scale action: 2200 hours.

To find more dug-outs, the raiding parties\r\ntook along with them some Jews caught on the previous day to act as\r\nguides. In these operations the raiding parties pulled out 944 Jews\r\nfrom dug-outs; 235 more Jews were shot on this occasion. When the block\r\nof buildings mentioned above was destroyed, 120 Jews were caught and\r\nnumerous Jews were destroyed when they jumped from the attics to the\r\ninner courtyards, trying to escape the flames. Many more Jews perished\r\nin the flames or were destroyed when the dug-outs and sewer entrances\r\nwere blown up. The Jews were removed from two armaments concerns and\r\nthe managers were requested to evacuate within a short time.\r\n\r\nAltogether we caught today: 1,852 Jews. The sum total of Jews caught\r\nthereby rises to 40,237 Jews. 27 dug-outs were discovered, forcibly\r\nopened and destroyed, arms and ammunition captured. When the external\r\nbarricade was shot at and when some Jews who broke out from a sewer\r\nentrance outside the Ghetto made an attack, we suffered 7 losses, 4\r\nPolicemen and 3 Polish Policemen. The scouting parties used during\r\nthe night encountered armed resistance from some Jews who under\r\nthe protection of darkness ventured to emerge from their holes and\r\ndug-outs.

Since we discovered several times today, that\r\nJewesses had pistols concealed in their bloomers, every Jew and bandit\r\nwill be ordered from today on, to strip completely for the search. We\r\ncaptured among other things, one German rifle, model 98, two 08 pistols\r\nand other calibers, also home-made hand grenades. The Jews cannot be\r\ninduced to leave their dug-outs until several smoke candles have been\r\nburned. According to depositions made yesterday and today, the Jews\r\nwere asked during the second half of 1942 to erect air-raid shelters.\r\nAt that time under the camouflage of erecting air-raid shelters, they\r\nbegan to build the dug-outs which they are now inhabiting, in order to\r\nuse them for an anti-Jewish operation.

This\r\nraiding party pulled 550 Jews out of dug-outs and killed in battle 188\r\nJews. Discovering the dug-outs becomes more and more difficult. Often\r\nthey can only be discovered by betrayal through other Jews. If the Jews\r\nare requested to leave their dug-out voluntarily, they hardly ever\r\nobey; they can only be forced to do so by the use of smoke-candles.\r\n\r\nThe main forces were detailed about 1100 hours to comb out, mop up,\r\nand destroy two large blocks of buildings, containing the former\r\nfirms Toebbens, Schulz and Co., and others. After these blocks had\r\nbeen completely cordoned off, we requested the Jews who were still\r\nwithin the buildings to come forward voluntarily. By this measure,\r\nwe caught 456 Jews for evacuation. Not until the blocks of buildings\r\nwere well aflame and were about to collapse did a further considerable\r\nnumber of Jews emerge, forced to do so by the flames and the smoke.\r\nTime and again the Jews try to escape even through burning buildings.\r\nInnumerable Jews whom we saw on the roofs during the conflagration\r\nperished in the flames. Others emerged from the upper stories in the\r\nlast possible moment and were only able to escape death in the flames\r\nby jumping down. Today we caught a total of 2,283 Jews, of whom 204\r\nwere shot and innumerable Jews were destroyed in dug-outs and in the\r\nflames. The sum total of Jews caught rises to 44,089.\r\n\r\nAs is learned from depositions made by the Jews, today we caught\r\npart of the governing body of the so-called \"Party.\" One member of\r\nthe committee which leads the gang will be used tomorrow for mopping\r\nup some more fortified dug-outs with armed Jews inside. When the\r\narmament enterprises were evacuated, we again observed that the goods\r\ncarted away were by no means valuable military equipment, as had been\r\npretended, but trifles, like used furniture and other requisitioned\r\nitems. We took appropriate measures against this at once.\r\n\r\nThe scouting parties who patrolled during the night in the former\r\nGhetto again reported movements of the Jews in the burned out and\r\ndestroyed streets and courtyards. In order to be better able to take\r\nthe Jews by surprise, the scouting parties at night tie rags and other\r\nstuff round their shoes. In skirmishes between the scouting parties and\r\nJews, 30 Jews were shot.\r\n\r\nWe captured 1 carbine, 3 pistols, and some ammunition. During the\r\nconflagration a considerable amount of stored ammunition exploded.\r\n\r\n  _Our strength, used in operation_:\r\n     German Police                              4/101\r\n     Engineering Em.

When the operation terminated,\r\nhowever, quite a number of dug-outs had again been discovered, owing to\r\nthe tracking ability of the men and to betrayal; 40 of these dug-outs\r\nwere destroyed. As far as possible, the Jews in these dug-outs were\r\ncaught (1,070 altogether). The combing out patrols shot about 126\r\nJews. Today again the Jews resisted in several places until they were\r\ncaptured. In several cases the entrances (hatches) of the dug-outs were\r\nforcibly held or bolted from the inside, so that only by using a strong\r\nexplosive charge could we force them open and destroy the inmates.\r\nToday, we again captured arms and ammunition, including one pistol.\r\nFrom one enterprise still in existence (so-called Prosta) 2,850 Jews\r\nwere caught for evacuation.

Although it was hardly to be expected\r\nthat any living person could still exist in those blocks, we discovered\r\nquite a number of dug-outs in which a burning heat had developed. From\r\nthese dug-outs and from other dug-outs which we discovered in other\r\nparts of the Ghetto, we pulled out 1,553 Jews. While resisting, and in\r\na skirmish, 356 Jews were shot. In this skirmish the Jews fired from 08\r\npistols and other calibers and threw Polish \"pineapple\" hand grenades.\r\nOne SS Unterscharfuehrer was wounded and a total of 47 dug-outs were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n2 men of the external cordoning forces were wounded. The Jews who had\r\nbroken out from the Ghetto seem to be returning now with the intention\r\nof assisting the Ghetto Jews by force or liberating them. One Jew who\r\nhad escaped from Lublin was caught just outside of the Ghetto wall. He\r\nwas armed as follows: 1 08 pistol, ample reserve ammunition, 2 Polish\r\n\"pineapple\" hand grenades. It could not be reliably ascertained so far\r\nwhether the so-called \"Party Directorate\" of the Jews (\"PPR\") have\r\nbeen caught or destroyed. We are on their traces. It is to be hoped\r\nthat tomorrow we shall succeed in tracing down this so-called Party\r\nDirectorate.

The firm Toebbens was\r\nrequested to evacuate, this miniature Ghetto by noon on 10 May 1943.\r\nThe so-called library, situated outside the Ghetto, was put at their\r\ndisposal for temporary storage of their raw materials, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sum total of Jews caught so far rises to 47,068.

Today we again encountered\r\narmed resistance in several cases, whereby we lost 1 SS man (wounded).\r\nWe captured 4 pistols of various calibers and some stores of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe location of the dug-out used by the so-called select \"Party\r\nDirectorate\" is now known. It is to be forced open tomorrow. The\r\nJews testify that they emerge at night to get fresh air, since it is\r\nunbearable to stay permanently within the dug-outs owing to the long\r\nduration of the operation. On the average the raiding parties shoot\r\n30 to 50 Jews each night. From these statements it was to be inferred\r\nthat a considerable number of Jews are still underground in the Ghetto.\r\nToday we blew up a concrete building which we had not been able to\r\ndestroy by fire. In this operation we learned that the blowing up of\r\na building is a very lengthy process and takes an enormous amount of\r\nexplosives. The best and only method for destroying the Jews therefore\r\nstill remains the setting of fires.\r\n\r\n  Our strength: as on the preceding day.\r\n  Our losses: 1 Waffen-SS man wounded.\r\n\r\nTermination of operation: 2100 hours, will be continued on 8 May 1943\r\n1000 hours.\r\n\r\n  The SS and Police Fuehrer in the\r\n  District of Warsaw.\r\n  Signed: Stroop\r\n  SS-Brigadefuehrer and Majorgeneral of Police.\r\n  Certified copy;\r\n  SS-Sturmbannfuehrer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  Teletype message\r\n\r\n  From: The SS and Police Fuehrer in the District of Warsaw\r\n  Warsaw, 8 May 1943.\r\n\r\n _Ref.

As reported some days a number of\r\nsubhumans, bandits, and terrorists still remain in the dug-outs, where\r\nheat has become intolerable by reason of the fires. These creatures\r\nknow only too well that their only choice is between remaining in\r\nhiding as long as possible or coming to the surface and trying to wound\r\nor kill off the men of the Waffen-SS, Police, and Wehrmacht who keep up\r\nthe pressure against them.\r\n\r\nWe continued today the operation against the dug-out of the so-called\r\nselect \"Party Directorate\" which we had discovered yesterday, as\r\nreported in my teletype message yesterday. We succeeded in forcing\r\nopen the dug-out of the Party Directorate and in catching about 60\r\nheavily armed bandits. We succeeded in catching and liquidating Deputy\r\nLeader of the Jewish Military Organization \"ZWZ\" and his so-called\r\nChief of Staff. There were about 200 Jews in this dug-out, of whom\r\n60 were caught and 140 were destroyed, partly owing to the strong\r\neffect of smoke-candles, and partly owing to heavy explosive charges\r\nwhich were laid in several places. The Jews whom we caught had already\r\nreported that innumerable Jews had been killed by the effect of the\r\nsmoke-candles. The fight of the first six days was hard, but now we are\r\nable to state that we are catching those Jews and Jewesses who were\r\nthe ringleaders in those days. Every time a dug-out is forced open,\r\nthe Jews in it offer resistance with the arms at their disposal, light\r\nmachine guns, pistols, and hand grenades. Today we again caught quite\r\na number of Jewesses who carried loaded pistols in their bloomers,\r\nwith the safety catch released. Some depositions speak of 3 to 4,000\r\nJews who still remain in underground holes, sewers, and dug-outs. The\r\nundersigned is resolved not to terminate the large-scale operation\r\nuntil the last Jew has been destroyed.\r\n\r\nA total of 1,091 Jews were caught today in dug-outs; about 280 Jews\r\nwere shot in battle, innumerable Jews were destroyed in the 43\r\ndug-outs which were blown up. The sum total of Jews caught has risen to\r\n49,712. Those buildings which had not yet been destroyed by fire, were\r\nset on fire today and we discovered that a few Jews were still hiding\r\nsomewhere within the walls or in the staircases.\r\n\r\n  Our strength:\r\n\r\n    Used in operation:\r\n\r\n      German Police             4/101\r\n      Engineering Em Service    1/6\r\n      Security Police           2/14\r\n      Engineers                 3/69\r\n      Waffen SS                13/527\r\n\r\n  Cordoning forces:\r\n\r\n                        _Day_       _Night_\r\n      German Police     1/87      1/36\r\n      Waffen SS         ----      1/300\r\n      Trawniki          160       ----\r\n      Polish Police     1/160     1/160\r\n\r\n  Our losses:\r\n\r\n      2 Waffen SS dead\r\n      2 Waffen SS wounded\r\n      1 Engineer wounded\r\n\r\nA policeman wounded on 7 May 1943 died today from wounds.

The resistance offered by\r\nthe Jews had not weakened today. In contrast to the previous days, it\r\nseems that those members of the main body of the Jewish battle group\r\nwho are still in existence and have not been destroyed have retired\r\ninto the ruins still within their reach, with the intention of firing\r\nfrom there against our men and inflicting casualties.\r\n\r\nToday we caught a total of 1,183 Jews alive, 187 bandits and Jews\r\nwere shot. Again a not ascertainable number of Jews and bandits were\r\ndestroyed in the blown-up dug-outs. The total of Jews caught up to date\r\nhas risen to 52,693.\r\n\r\nToday at 0900 hours a truck drove up to a certain sewer in the\r\nso-called Prosta. Someone in the truck exploded two hand grenades,\r\nwhich was the signal for the bandits who were standing ready in the\r\nsewer to climb out of it. The bandits and Jews--there are always\r\nsome Polish bandits among them--armed with carbines, small arms, and\r\none machine gun, climbed into the truck and drove away in an unknown\r\ndirection. The last man of the gang, who stood sentry in the sewer\r\nand had the duty of closing the sewer lid, was captured. It is he who\r\ngave the above information. He testified that most of the members\r\nof the gang, which had been divided into several battle groups, had\r\neither been killed in battle or had committed suicide because they\r\nhad realized the futility of continuing the fight. The search for the\r\ntruck, which was ordered at once, had no results. The bandits testified\r\nfurther that the Prosta is now the refuge for the still existing Jews\r\nbecause the Ghetto has become too hot for them. For this reason, I\r\nresolved to deal with the Prosta in the same manner as with the Ghetto,\r\nand to destroy this miniature Ghetto.\r\n\r\nToday, we again captured small arms and some ammunition. The Security\r\nPolice yesterday succeeded in capturing a workshop outside the Ghetto\r\nwhich manufactured 10,000 to 11,000 explosive charges and other\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n  Our strength: as on the preceding day.\r\n  Our losses: 3 SS men wounded.\r\n\r\nOwing to the excellent understanding between us and the Wehrmacht, the\r\ndetachment of Engineers was reinforced. Moreover, a considerable amount\r\nof explosives was put at our disposal.\r\n\r\nTermination of operation: 2200 hours.

The scouting parties shot 12 Jews. On the basis of\r\nthese reports, today I again formed raiding parties who in combing-out\r\noperations discovered, captured, and destroyed a total of 47 dug-outs.\r\nToday again we caught some Jews who had taken refuge in ruins which\r\nwere still protected by a roof. The Jews and bandits are still seeking\r\nthis new refuge, because staying in the dug-outs has become unbearable.\r\nOne dug-out was discovered which contained about 12 rooms equipped with\r\nplumbing, running water, and separate bathrooms for men and women.\r\nConsiderable amounts of food were captured or secured, in order to make\r\nit more and more difficult for them to get necessary food.\r\n\r\nA total of 931 Jews and bandits were caught. 53 bandits were shot. More\r\nof them perished when dug-outs were blown up and when a small block of\r\nbuildings was destroyed by fire. The total of Jews caught up to date\r\nhas risen to 53,667. We captured several pistols, hand grenades, and\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nWe have not been able to smoke out the sewers systematically once more,\r\nsince we are short of smoke-candles. \"OFK\" is ready to provide new\r\nsmoke-candles.\r\n\r\n  _Our strength_:\r\n    Used in operation:\r\n      German Police                  6/126\r\n      Engineering Em.

Today it became clear\r\nthat the Jews and bandits whom we are catching now belong to the\r\nso-called battle groups. All of them are young fellows and females\r\nbetween 18 and 25 years of age. When we captured one, a real skirmish\r\ntook place, in which the Jews not only fired from 08 pistols and Polish\r\nVis pistols, but also threw Polish \"pineapple\" hand grenades at the\r\nWaffen-SS men. After part of the inmates of the dug-out had been caught\r\nand were about to be searched, one of the females as quick as lightning\r\nput her hand under her shirt, as many others had done, and fetched from\r\nher bloomers a \"pineapple\" hand grenade, drew the safety-catch, threw\r\nthe grenade among the men who were searching her, and jumped quickly\r\nto cover. It is only thanks to the presence of mind of the men that no\r\ncasualties ensued.\r\n\r\nThe few Jews and criminals still staying in the Ghetto have for the\r\nlast few days been using the hideouts they can still find among the\r\nruins, retiring at night into the dug-outs whose location is known to\r\nthem, to eat and get provisions for the next day. Lately we have been\r\nunable to extract information on the whereabouts of further dug-outs\r\nfrom the captured Jews. The remainder of the inmates of that dug-out\r\nwhere the skirmish took place were destroyed by using heavier explosive\r\ncharges. From a Wehrmacht concern we evacuated 327 Jews today.

In this way a considerable number of bandits\r\nand Jews were caught, especially as some traces had been discovered\r\nduring the night which were now followed up with good results. The\r\nnight patrols clashed with armed bandits several times. These bandits\r\nfired a machine gun and small arms. In this operation we had four\r\ncasualties--3 Waffen-SS men and 1 Policeman. Repeatedly, shots were\r\nfired from the Aryan part against the external barricade. In the\r\nskirmishes about 30 bandits were shot and 9 Jews and bandits, members\r\nof an armed gang, were captured. One dug-out was taken during the\r\nnight, the Jews captured, and some pistols, among them one of 12-mm\r\ncaliber, were captured. In one dug-out inhabited by 100 persons, we\r\nwere able to capture 2 rifles, 16 pistols, some hand grenades and\r\nincendiary appliances. Of the bandits who resisted, some again wore\r\nGerman military uniform, German steel helmets and \"knobeloecher.\" Apart\r\nfrom the carbines, we captured 60 rounds of German rifle ammunition.\r\nOne raiding party had a skirmish with a gang, 10 to 14 strong, on the\r\nroofs of a block of buildings at the border of the Ghetto (Aryan part).\r\nThe bandits were destroyed; we suffered no losses.\r\n\r\nThe captured bandits repeatedly testify that still not all persons in\r\nthe Ghetto have been caught. They confidently expect that the action\r\nwill soon be over, and that they will then be able to continue to\r\nlive in the Ghetto. Several bandits stated that they had long been in\r\na position to kill off the leader of the action, the \"General,\" as\r\nthey call him, but that they would not do so, since they had orders\r\nto that effect to avoid the risk of a further intensification of the\r\nanti-Jewish measures.\r\n\r\nToday again some concrete buildings in which the bandits find refuge\r\ntime and again were blown up by the engineers.\r\n\r\nIn order to force the bandits in the sewers to come to the surface,\r\n183 sewer entrances were opened at 1500 hours, and smoke-candles were\r\nlowered into them at an ordered x-time, thereupon the bandits, seeking\r\nescape from what they supposed to be poison gas, crowded together in\r\nthe center of the former Ghetto, and we were able to pull them out of\r\nthe sewer entrances there.\r\n\r\nI shall come to a decision after tomorrow's operations regarding\r\ntermination of the action.\r\n\r\nToday SS-Gruppenfuehrer and Lieutenant General of Waffen-SS von Horff\r\nwas present during the operations.\r\n\r\n    _Our strength_:\r\n      Used in operation:\r\n        German Police          4/184\r\n        Engineering Em.

Beyond the number of 56,065 an estimated number of 5 to 6,000\r\nJews were destroyed by being blown up or by perishing in the flames.\r\n\r\n  _No. 2_:\r\n\r\nA total of 631 dug-outs were destroyed.\r\n\r\n  _No. 3_ (_booty_):\r\n\r\n 7 Polish rifles, 1 Russian rifle, 1 German rifle.\r\n\r\n 59 pistols of various calibers.\r\n\r\n Several 100 hand grenades, including Polish and home-made ones.\r\n\r\n A few 100 incendiary bottles.\r\n\r\n Home-made explosive charges.\r\n\r\n Infernal machines with fuses.\r\n\r\n Large amounts of explosives, ammunition for all calibers, including\r\n machine-gun ammunition.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the bag of arms one must take into consideration that\r\nin most cases we were not able to capture the arms themselves, since\r\nthe Jews and bandits before they were captured threw them away into\r\nhideouts and holes which we could not discover or find. The smoke\r\nwhich we had developed in the dug-outs also prevented our men from\r\ndiscovering and capturing the arms. Since we had to blow up the\r\ndug-outs at once we were not in a position to search for the arms later\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe hand grenades, explosive charges, and incendiary bottles captured\r\nwere used at once against the bandits.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we captured:\r\n\r\n 1,240 used uniform tunics (partly equipped with medal ribbons, Iron\r\n Cross, and East Medal).\r\n\r\n 600 pairs of used trousers.\r\n\r\n Pieces of equipment, and German steel helmets.\r\n\r\n 103 horses, 4 of them in the former Ghetto (hearse).\r\n\r\nWe counted up to 23 May 1943:\r\n\r\n 4.4 million Zloty. We captured moreover about 5 to 6 million Zloty,\r\n not yet counted, a considerable amount of foreign currency, including--\r\n\r\n  $14,300 in paper.\r\n  $9,200 in gold.\r\n\r\n Large amounts of valuables (rings, chains, watches etc.)\r\n\r\n  _No. 4_:\r\n\r\nWith the exception of 8 buildings (police barracks, hospital and\r\naccommodations for working parties) the former Ghetto has been\r\ncompletely destroyed.

Accordingly, the concentration camps\r\nwill be classified into the following categories:\r\n\r\n_Category I_: For all prisoners with only little accusation and\r\ndefinitely qualified for correction, also for special cases and\r\nsolitary confinement, the camps:\r\n\r\n  Dachau\r\n\r\n  Sachsenhausen\r\n\r\n  Auschwitz I\r\n\r\n (The latter also applies in part to category II)\r\n\r\n_Category Ia_: For all old prisoners and conditionally qualified for\r\nwork, who can still be used in the medicinal herb gardens, the camp:\r\n\r\n  Dachau\r\n\r\n_Category II_: For prisoners with heavy accusations, but still\r\nqualified for reeducation and correction, the camps:\r\n\r\nBuchenwald\r\n\r\nFlossenbuerg\r\n\r\nAuschwitz II\r\n\r\n_Category III_: For the heavily accused prisoners, at the same time\r\nalso for those who have been previously convicted for criminal\r\noffences, for social prisoners that is to say, those who can hardly be\r\ncorrected, the camp: Mauthausen.\r\n\r\nNot to be included in category Ia are old prisoners not qualified for\r\nwork and in need of medical treatment. They are therefore to remain in\r\nthe specifically provided sections for this purpose of the respective\r\nconcentration camp. More serious cases are to be transferred to the\r\nhospital section of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen.\r\n\r\nA regrouping of the prisoners within the camps according to the new\r\nclassification cannot be undertaken right now in view of the current\r\nmeasures for the execution of the prisoner commitment. New dispositions\r\nwill be made, however, in accordance with the classification.\r\n\r\nI ask therefore, that in the future, with the arrest warrant and\r\nthe transfer to a concentration camp, suggestions be made as to the\r\ncategory of the prisoner with regard to his personality as well as the\r\ndegree of his danger to the State.\r\n\r\nI therefore order that a complete record of the political life,\r\nprevious convictions for criminal offences and conduct of the prisoner\r\nsince the taking over of the power be established, and that request for\r\nassignment into category III be specifically and carefully motivated.\r\n\r\nThis decree does not apply to the district and local police authorities.\r\n\r\n  [seal of the secret state police]\r\n  /s/ HEYDRICH\r\n  certified correct\r\n  /s/ BLEECK\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1063-B-PS\r\n\r\n  Headquarters of the Reichs Security Service\r\n  II C 3 Nr 5028/43-273-2 (General)\r\n\r\n  Berlin 26 July 1943\r\n\r\n To the higher SS and Police Chiefs\r\n\r\n the commanders of the security police and the security service\r\n\r\n the inspectors of the security police and the security service\r\n\r\n the deputy of the chiefs of the secret police and the security service\r\n within the territory of the military commander in Belgium and northern\r\n France in Brussels\r\n\r\n the chiefs of the Einsatzgruppe B and D\r\n\r\nFor the information of:\r\n\r\n the state police headquarters\r\n\r\n the commandants of the security police and the security service\r\n\r\n Reich's security main office--office IV\r\n\r\n  [seal]\r\n  State Police Hq Duesseldorf\r\n  16 Aug 1943\r\n\r\n  Subject: Organization of labor reformatory camps\r\n\r\nThe Reichsfuehrer SS has given his consent that besides concentration\r\ncamps, which come under the jurisdiction of the SS economical\r\nadministration main office, further labor reformatory camps may be\r\ncreated for which the security police alone is competent. These labor\r\nreformatory camps are dependent on the authorization of the Reichs\r\nsecurity main office, which can only be granted in case of emergency\r\n(great number of foreign workers, etc.).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Reichsfuehrer SS has forbidden that prison camps\r\nof all sorts (among others, enlarged police prisons, labor reformatory\r\ncamps, transient camps) be placed under the immediate jurisdiction of\r\nthe higher SS and police chiefs or the commanders and inspectors of the\r\nsecurity police and of the security service. He has ordered that those\r\ncamps come for administration and command under the jurisdiction of the\r\nstate police headquarters, commandants of the security police and the\r\nsecurity service or the immigration and transient agencies. Thus the\r\ngeneral supervision of the superior offices remains undisturbed by this\r\naffiliation.\r\n\r\nThe decrees of 28.5.1941 and 12.12.1941 concerning the organization\r\nof labor reformatory camps remain also in effect.

As of now (so far until 1 Feb. 1943) all eastern workers or such\r\nforeign workers who have been fugitives, or who have broken contracts,\r\nand who do not belong to allied, friendly or neutral States are to be\r\nbrought by the quickest means to the nearest concentration camps. For\r\nthis, the most necessary formalities, as listed under N. 3 must be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn order to eliminate and to avoid complaints, each and every one of\r\nthese measures in the individual cases must be presented to third\r\nauthorities, by giving careful reasons, as being irremissible security\r\npolice measures.\r\n\r\n2. The commanders and the commandants of the security police and the\r\nsecurity service, and the chiefs of the State police headquarters will\r\ncheck immediately on the basis of a close and strict ruling.\r\n\r\n_a._ the prisons.\r\n\r\n_b._ the labor reformatory camps.\r\n\r\nAll prisoners qualified for work, if it is essentially and humanly\r\npossible, will be committed at once to the nearest concentration\r\ncamp, according to the following instructions, for instance also if\r\npenal procedures were to be established in the near future. Only such\r\nprisoners who in the interest of investigation procedures are to remain\r\nabsolutely in solitary confinement can be left there.\r\n\r\n  _Every single laborer counts!_\r\n\r\nThe checking must be taken up at once.

On an order\r\nof the Reichsfuehrer SS, Reichsleiter Heinrich Himmler, most of the\r\npaintings, some still during my term of office, were packed by the SS\r\nand shipped to the Reich. They are worth several millions of marks\r\nand were all taken from the general district of White Ruthenia. The\r\npaintings were supposedly sent to Linz and to Koenigsberg in East\r\nPrussia. I beg to have these valuable collections, insofar as they are\r\nnot needed in the Reich, again placed at the disposal of the general\r\ndistrict of White Ruthenia, in any case, however, to have the money\r\nvalue secured for the Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report made by a Major of the 707th Division who today\r\nhanded the remaining treasures over to me, the SS has left the rest of\r\nthe paintings and works of art to the Wehrmacht for further pillaging,\r\nincluding very valuable paintings and furniture from the 18th and 19th\r\ncenturies, vases, marble objects, clocks, etc. General Stubenrauch\r\nhas taken a valuable part from Minsk with him up to the front.\r\n\"Sonderfuehrer\" whose names have not yet been reported to me, have\r\ncarried away furniture, paintings and art objects * * * in 3 trucks,\r\nwithout giving a receipt. I shall ascertain which unit it was, in order\r\nto carry out the punishment of those who have made themselves guilty\r\nof looting. From the material that was left, local authorities of the\r\nWehrmacht and of the SS took away more art treasures and paintings\r\nwithout my permission; those, however, may still be found in Minsk.\r\n\r\nI request that the national socialist painter, Willi Springer, Berlin\r\nSW 29, Hasenheide 94, be sent here to restore those paintings which\r\nwere in part thoughtlessly damaged by knife slashings, so that under\r\nhis supervision whatever can still be salvaged, should be salvaged.\r\nUnfortunately, many valuable vases, china, cupboards, and period\r\nfurniture from the 18th and 19th centuries were also badly damaged\r\nor destroyed. Altogether it is a question of irreplaceable valuables\r\nworth millions of marks. I request that for the future the Ministry\r\nfor Eastern Affairs take action with the competent authorities of the\r\nWehrmacht so that such vandalism be stopped and that those responsible\r\nto be threatened with the heaviest possible punishment and that such\r\npunishment be inflicted if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric museum also is in a completely devastated state.\r\nValuable precious and semiprecious stones were stolen from the\r\ngeological section. At the university, instruments worth hundreds\r\nof thousands of marks were thoughtlessly destroyed or stolen. May I\r\nsuggest, my dear Reichsleiter, that you report these events to the\r\nFuehrer? White Ruthenia, already rather poor, has suffered a heavy loss\r\nthrough these actions. I hope that specialists will be employed in\r\nLeningrad, and in Moscow, as well as in the old cultural cities in the\r\nUkraine, to prevent occurrences of this kind; otherwise the civilian\r\nadministration shall find everywhere the same devastation as was found\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n\r\n  Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  (signed) Wilhelm KUBE\r\n  Commissar General for White Ruthenia\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1104-PS\r\n\r\n The Personal Reviewer of the Permanent Deputy of the Minister of the\r\n Reich\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 21 November 1941\r\n  _Bi/T Nr 58 A/41 Secret_\r\n  _To Dr. Marquart_\r\n\r\nEnclosed herewith I transmit to you the copy of an incident regarding\r\nthe measures against the Jews in the general-district of Minsk, with\r\nthe request to submit the same to the Minister of the Reich.\r\n\r\nOn order of the Gauleiter I have sent one copy to Lieutenant General of\r\nthe SS, Heydrich, with the request for investigation of the incident.\r\n\r\n  signed: BIGENWALD\r\n  3 enclosures\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Copy /T\r\n\r\n  The Commissioner General for White Ruthenia\r\n  Dept Gauleiter/Ka\r\n  Minsk, 1 November 1941\r\n\r\n To the Reich Commissioner for the Eastern Territories, Gauleiter\r\n Hinrich Lohse, Riga\r\n\r\nToday, money, valuables and other objects were deposited at the cashier\r\nof my office against receipt, in the presence of Government Councillor\r\nDr. Idelberger of the Police Battalion 11. These matters were from\r\nSluzk and other regions which the Police Battalion 11 had included\r\nin its action without my order and without my knowledge. All objects\r\nand the money have been safely deposited by officials of Commissariat\r\nGeneral with the Reich Credit Institute [Reichskreditanstalt] and\r\nare held at the disposal of the Reich Commissioner. Reserve officer\r\n1st Lieutenant of the Police Brodeck attempted in the course of this\r\nincident to purchase gold for private purposes in order to use it for a\r\npersonal affair, as witnessed by Government Councillor Dr. Idelberger,\r\nmy adjutant, SS-2nd Lt Wildenstein and myself.\r\n\r\nI have immediately reported the case to the responsible field command\r\npost at Minsk and requested the arrest of the police officer. 1st Lt\r\nBrodeck was immediately set free by the investigating court martial\r\nofficer as the court martial officer did not find any basis for charges\r\nin this incident. This is contrary to the legal conception of my\r\noffice. Any private dealing in gold is prohibited in the German Reich.\r\nAggravating in this case is furthermore the fact that an officer of the\r\nsame unit is involved which has effected the liquidation of the former\r\npossessors of gold.\r\n\r\n  The Commissioner General for White Ruthenia\r\n  signed: KUBE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  Copy / T\r\n\r\n  The Commissioner General for White Ruthenia\r\n  Dept Gauleiter/Ka\r\n  Minsk, 1 November 1941\r\n  _Personal_\r\n\r\n To the Reich Commissioner for the Eastern Territories Gauleiter\r\n Hinrich LOHSE Riga\r\n\r\nEnclosed I submit a report of the Commissioner for the territory of\r\nSluzk, party member Carl, with the request not to let this matter rest.\r\nHerewith I propose to prosecute the guilty officers commencing with the\r\nbattalion commander of the security police to the last lieutenant.\r\n\r\nFor about the last three weeks, I have discussed the Sluzk action\r\nagainst the Jews with the responsible SS-Brigadier General and\r\nBrigadier-General of the Protection Police, Zenner, Member of the\r\nReichstag, and I have pointed out that the tradesmen should be spared\r\nby all means and that the commissioner responsible for the territory\r\nshould be contacted prior to the action. Above all, any act lowering\r\nthe prestige of the German Reich and its organizations in the eyes of\r\nthe White Ruthenian population should be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe police battalion No 11 from Kauen has as a unit, directly\r\nsubordinate to the armed forces, taken independent action without\r\ninforming me, the SS-Brigadier-General or any other office of the\r\nCommissariat General, thereby impairing most seriously the prestige of\r\nthe German nation. I request to have the commissioner of the territory\r\nCarl and all his officials and collaborators from Riga questioned under\r\noath and to record the hearing. Then, in order to set an example, I\r\nrequest to grant my motion to prosecute the entire staff of officers of\r\nthe police battalion 11.\r\n\r\nI am submitting this report in duplicate so that one copy may be\r\nforwarded to the Reich Minister. Peace and order cannot be maintained\r\nin White Ruthenia with methods of that sort. To bury seriously wounded\r\npeople alive who worked their way out of their graves again, is such\r\na base and filthy act that this incident as such should be reported\r\nto the Fuehrer and Reich Marshal. The civil administration of White\r\nRuthenia makes very strenuous efforts to win the population over to\r\nGermany in accordance with the instructions of the Fuehrer.

The first lieutenant explained that the police\r\nbattalion had received the assignment to effect the liquidation of\r\nall Jews here in the town of Sluzk, within two days. The battalion\r\ncommander with his battalion in strength of four companies, two of\r\nwhich were made up of Lithuanian partisans, was on the march here\r\nand the action would have to begin instantly. I replied to the first\r\nlieutenant that I had to discuss the action in any case first with the\r\ncommander. About half an hour later the police battalion arrived in\r\nSluzk. Immediately after the arrival the conference with the battalion\r\ncommander took place according to my request. I first explained to\r\nthe commander that it would not very well be possible to effect the\r\naction without previous preparation, because everybody had been sent to\r\nwork and that it would lead to terrible confusion. At least it would\r\nhave been his duty to inform me a day ahead of time. Then I requested\r\nhim to postpone the action one day. However, he rejected this with\r\nthe remark that he had to carry out this action everywhere and in all\r\ntowns and that only two days were allotted for Sluzk. Within these\r\ntwo days, the town of Sluzk had to be cleared of Jews by all means.\r\nI immediately protested violently against it, pointing out that a\r\nliquidation of Jews must not be allowed to take place in an arbitrary\r\nmanner. I explained that a large part of the Jews still living in\r\nthe towns were tradesmen and families of tradesmen respectively. But\r\nthese Jewish tradesmen were not simply expendable because they were\r\nindispensable for maintaining the economic life. Furthermore, I pointed\r\nout that White Ruthenian tradesmen are so to say non-existent, that\r\ntherefore all vital plants had to be shut down all at once, if all Jews\r\nwould be liquidated. At the end of our conference, I mentioned that\r\nall tradesmen and specialists, inasmuch as they were indispensable,\r\nhad papers of identification and that these should not be pulled out\r\nof the factories. Furthermore, it was agreed that all Jews still\r\nliving in the town should first be brought into the ghetto in order to\r\nsegregate them, especially with regard to the families of tradesmen\r\nwhich I did not want to have liquidated either. Two of my officials\r\nshould be assigned to segregate them. The commander did not in any\r\nway contradict my idea and I had therefore the firm belief that the\r\naction would be carried out accordingly. However, a few hours after the\r\nbeginning of the action the greatest difficulties already developed. I\r\nnoticed that the commander had not at all abided by our agreement. All\r\nJews without exception were taken out of the factories and shops and\r\ndeported in spite of our agreement. It is true that part of the Jews\r\nwas moved by way of the ghetto where many of them were processed and\r\nstill segregated by me, but a large part was loaded directly on trucks\r\nand liquidated without further delay outside of the town. Shortly after\r\nnoon complaints came already from all sides that the factories could\r\nnot function any more because all Jewish tradesmen had been removed. As\r\nthe commander had proceeded on his way to Baranowitschi I got in touch\r\nwith the deputy commander, a captain, after searching a long time,\r\nand demanded to stop the action immediately because my instructions\r\nhad been disregarded and the damage done so far with respect to the\r\neconomic life could not be repaired any more. The captain was greatly\r\nsurprised at my idea and stated that he had received orders from the\r\ncommander to clear the whole town of Jews without exception in the\r\nsame manner as they had done in other towns. This mopping up had to be\r\nexecuted on political considerations and economic reasons had never\r\nplayed a role anywhere. However, due to my energetic intervention, he\r\nfinally halted the action toward evening.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, as regards the execution of the action, I must point\r\nout to my deepest regret that the latter bordered already on sadism.\r\nThe town itself offered a picture of horror during the action. With\r\nindescribable brutality on the part of both the German police officers\r\nand particularly the Lithuanian partisans, the Jewish people, but\r\nalso among them White Ruthenians, were taken out of their dwellings\r\nand herded together. Everywhere in the town shots were to be heard\r\nand in different streets the corpses of shot Jews accumulated. The\r\nWhite Ruthenians were in greatest distress to free themselves from the\r\nencirclement. Regardless of the fact that the Jewish people, among whom\r\nwere also tradesmen, were mistreated in a terribly barbarous way in the\r\nface of the White Ruthenian people, the White Ruthenians themselves\r\nwere also worked over with rubber clubs and rifle butts. There was no\r\nquestion of an action against the Jews any more. It rather looked like\r\na revolution. I myself with all my officials have been in it without\r\ninterruption all day long in order to save what could yet be saved. In\r\nseveral instances I literally had to expel with drawn pistol the German\r\npolice officials as well as the Lithuanian partisans from the shops.\r\nMy own police was employed for the same mission but had often to leave\r\nthe streets on account of the wild shooting in order to avoid being\r\nshot themselves. The whole picture was generally more than ghastly. In\r\nthe afternoon a great number of abandoned Panje carriages with horses\r\nwere standing in the streets so that I had to instruct the municipal\r\nadministration to take care of the vehicles immediately. Afterwards it\r\nwas ascertained that they were Jewish vehicles ordered by the armed\r\nforces to move ammunition. The drivers had simply been taken off the\r\ncarriages and led away, and nobody had worried in the least about the\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\nI was not present at the shooting before the town. Therefore I cannot\r\nmake a statement on its brutality. But it should suffice, if I point\r\nout that persons shot have worked themselves out of their graves\r\nsome time after they had been covered. Regarding the economic damage\r\nI want to state that the tannery has been affected worst of all. 26\r\nexperts worked there. Of them, fifteen of the best specialists alone\r\nhave been shot. Four more jumped from the truck during the transport\r\nand escaped, while seven others were not apprehended after they fled.\r\nThe plant barely continues to operate today. Five wheelwrights worked\r\nin the wheelwright shop. Four of them have been shot and the shop has\r\nto keep going now with one wheelwright. Additional tradesmen such as\r\ncarpenters, blacksmiths, etc. are still missing. Up till now it was\r\nimpossible for me to obtain an exact survey. I have mentioned already\r\nin the beginning, that the families of tradesmen should be spared too.\r\nBut now it seems that almost in all families some persons are missing.\r\nReports come in from all over, making it clear that in one family\r\nthe tradesman himself, in another family the wife and in the next\r\none again the children are missing. In that way, almost all families\r\nhave been broken up. It seems to be very doubtful whether under these\r\ncircumstances the remaining tradesmen will show any interest in their\r\nwork and produce accordingly, particularly as even today they are\r\nrunning around with bloody and bruised faces due to the brutality. The\r\nWhite Ruthenian people who had full confidence in us, are dumbfounded.\r\nThough they are intimidated and don't dare to utter their free opinion,\r\none has already heard that they take the viewpoint that this day does\r\nnot add to the glory of Germany and that it will not be forgotten. I am\r\nof the opinion that much has been destroyed through this action which\r\nwe have achieved during the last months and that it will take a long\r\ntime until we shall regain the confidence of the population which we\r\nhave lost.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I find myself obliged to point out that the police\r\nbattalion has looted in an unheard of manner during the action, and\r\nthat not only in Jewish houses but just the same in those of the White\r\nRuthenians. Anything of use such as boots, leather, cloth, gold and\r\nother valuables, has been taken away. On the basis of statements of\r\nmembers of the armed forces, watches were torn off the arms of Jews in\r\npublic, on the street, and rings were pulled off the fingers in the\r\nmost brutal manner. A major of the finance department reported that a\r\nJewish girl was asked by the police to obtain immediately 5,000 rubles\r\nto have her father released. This girl is said to have actually gone\r\neverywhere in order to obtain the money.\r\n\r\nAlso within the ghetto, the different barracks which had been\r\nnailed up by the civil administration and were furnished with Jewish\r\nfurniture, have been broken open and robbed. Even from the barracks\r\nin which the unit was quartered, window frames and doors have been\r\nforcibly removed and used for campfires. Although I had a discussion\r\nwith the adjutant of the commander on Tuesday morning concerning the\r\nlooting and he promised in the course of the discussion that none of\r\nthe policemen would enter the town any more, yet I was forced several\r\nhours later to arrest two fully armed Lithuanian partisans because they\r\nwere apprehended looting. During the night from Tuesday to Wednesday\r\nthe battalion left the town in the direction of Baranowitschi.\r\nEvidently, the people were only too glad when this report circulated in\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nSo far the report. I shall come to Minsk in the immediate future, in\r\norder to discuss the affair personally once again. At the present time,\r\nI am not in a position to continue with the action against the Jews.\r\nFirst, order has to be established again. I hope that I shall be able\r\nto restore order as soon as possible and also to revive the economic\r\nlife despite the difficulties. Only, I beg you to grant me one request:\r\n\"In the future, keep this police battalion away from me by all means.\"\r\n\r\n  signed: CARL\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1107-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  The Leader of Directorate Group, Cultural Missions\r\n  _P / 551a/44g_\r\n  Expert: Goepel\r\n  Berlin, 17 May 1944.\r\n\r\n To the Chief of Operational Staff Politic [Fuehrungestabes Politik]\r\n Inter-office Memorandum.\r\n\r\n Subject: Bringing of Museum Objects and Works of Art from the Occupied\r\n Eastern Territories into the Reich.\r\n\r\nInformation received concerning the bringing back of museum objects\r\nand other works of art now public property in the occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories into the Reich has shown that the interests of the ministry\r\nof the East, i.e., of the Reich in this matter are not being presented\r\nwith sufficient stress. There is no reason for leaving these museum\r\nstocks, some of which are extremely valuable, in the hands of various\r\noffices and authorities without establishing unmistakably the claim\r\nof possession, i.e., the right of disposal of the Reich. The atrocity\r\npropaganda of the enemy side has taken up this question at large and\r\nhas retained with it evident success in the incitement against Germany\r\nin this and foreign countries.\r\n\r\nBesides the department of archives in the Reich Ministry, the following\r\nhave brought back works of art from the occupied Eastern Districts\r\n(place of deposit Troppau):\r\n\r\n Reich Commissioner for Ukraine.\r\n\r\n (East and West European Museum--place of deposit Kiew in the district\r\n Reichau (Wehlau)).\r\n\r\n (Museum Charkow--place of deposit Wildenhof near Zinten.

A decree is to go to all offices involved according to which all\r\nworks of art of public property which have been brought back should be\r\nput under direct control of the ministry of the East.\r\n\r\n2.

The places of deposit of these objects of art seized in this way\r\nare to be examined by experts and, if necessary the required measures\r\ntaken to secure these objects from air damage or other destruction. A\r\nchecking at regular intervals of the conditions and intactness of the\r\nstocks should be made as is done at the places of deposit of the German\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\n  MS 18/5\r\n  [v.d.

At the beginning\r\nof October a part of the population had been evacuated especially in\r\nthe parts of the town by the Dnieper and the areas in question were\r\ndeclared \"battle zones\". During October the population of the city\r\nwas further evacuated quarter by quarter. This evacuation took place\r\nby order of the military authorities; it was, however, carried out by\r\nthe civil administration [Stadtkommandantur]. The trolley line and the\r\nrailway trains had already been put in readiness by the German civil\r\nadministration. Nonetheless, the greater proportion of the inhabitants\r\nlistened to the Soviet counter-propaganda, with the result that\r\nthey did not wish to abandon the city; they sought accommodation in\r\nquarters still untouched by the evacuation or went off on foot to the\r\nneighboring areas of the city. There was an uninterrupted stream of\r\nhomeless people wandering through the streets, with a few belongings.\r\nHardship was unavoidable as a result of the evacuation, but it was\r\nstill further increased by the passive resistance of the population.\r\nProtection could not be set up in the evacuated sections of the city,\r\nso there were very soon no locked doors. It was probably mainly\r\nmembers of the local bands dressed in field gray, who are to be held\r\nresponsible for the plundering of empty dwellings, etc. At this time\r\nmuch property belonging to museums and institutions was destroyed.\r\n\r\n2. _The Removal of Cultural Property._ A great deal of material from\r\nmuseums, archives, institutions and other cultural institutions was\r\ntaken out of and away from Kiev in the autumn of 1943, in the proper\r\nway. These actions to safeguard the material were carried out by\r\nthe Special Purpose Staff RR as well as by the individual institute\r\ndirectors etc. at the instigation of the Reich Commissar. At the\r\nbeginning a great deal of the evacuated property was taken only to the\r\nrear areas; later on this material was forwarded to the Reich. When\r\nthe undersigned, towards the end of September, received the mission\r\nfrom the cultural division of the Reich Commissar to take out of Kiev\r\nthe remaining cultural effects, the most worthwhile materials from the\r\ncultural point of view had already been removed. During October some\r\n40 carloads of cultural effects were sent to the Reich. In this case\r\nit was chiefly a question of valuables which belonged to the research\r\ninstitutions of the national Research Centre of the Ukraine. These\r\ninstitutions are continuing their work at the present time in the Reich\r\nand are being directed in such a manner that at a given moment they\r\ncan be brought back into the Ukraine. The cultural valuables which\r\ncould not be promptly safeguarded, were plundered. In this case, it was\r\nalways a question, however, of less valuable material, as the principal\r\nvaluables were taken away in accordance with orders.\r\n\r\nIn October 1943 factory, workshop etc. plants were taken out of Kiev\r\nby order of the Reich Commissar. To what place they were removed I do\r\nnot know. At the time of the entry of Soviet Russia there was nothing\r\nvaluable in this respect left in the city.\r\n\r\n  [Signature] Dr. Ulmann\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1113-PS\r\n\r\n  Higher SS- and Police Leader for the East\r\n  2000/42 g\r\n  11 Jacobstr, Riga, November 6, 1942\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Final Report \"Marshfever\"\r\n\r\n9. _Miciajewicze (p. 2479)_\r\n\r\n  9 Feb--9 Mar 1942\r\n\r\nBy motorized Gendarmery--patrols and a company from the 15th Latvian\r\nPolice Battalion.

The above-mentioned persons are requested to\r\nreport to us on their work, particularly on any difficulties that might\r\narise.\r\n\r\n  signed: GOERING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1118-PS\r\n\r\n  To the Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich\r\n  Berlin W 8, Leipziger Str. 3\r\n  18 June 1942\r\n  U/Sz 1073/42 i\r\n  Dear Reich Marshal:\r\n\r\nFrom your letter of 30 May 1942, I see that Oberfeldfuehrer von Behr\r\nof the German Red Cross informed you of certain matters on which he\r\nhas not been able to report to me yet. I am pleased by the appreciation\r\nwhich you express for my Einsatzstab for the occupied territories.\r\nIt is, for me, self-evident that the members of my Einsatzstab will\r\ncontinue to be at your disposal as much as is at all possible.\r\n\r\nSince the new M-action to secure Jewish house furnishings for the\r\nestablishment of the administration in the East, which is purely a\r\nstate measure, has been added to the former tasks of my Einsatzstab,\r\nit has been necessary to undertake an organizational separation of\r\nduty fields according to my party and state bureaus. In order that the\r\ninterests of the Einsatzstab may be protected within the framework of\r\nthe M-action, I have appointed Oberfeldfuehrer von Behr of the German\r\nRed Cross, head of the bureau West of the Reich Ministry for the\r\nOccupied Eastern Territories, while the party bureau of the Einsatzstab\r\nParis will be restaffed.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the importance of the work of the Einsatzstab in\r\nhistory and in order to relieve my fellow workers, I have directed\r\nthat in the interest of a correct documentary grasp of the securing of\r\nart objects hitherto undertaken, all evidence on this subject will be\r\nchecked. This work is at present in progress.\r\n\r\nSince in certain circles, as you write, the conjecture was expressed\r\nthat one of my bureaus would deal in art objects, I have ordered this\r\ncheck. I have entrusted it to the head of my office for plastic art,\r\nBereichsleiter Scholz, and Abschnittsleiter von Ingram who wears the\r\nKnight's Cross. Furthermore some time ago I explicitly approved the\r\nmeasures of the chief of staff of my Einsatzstab, Stabsfuehrer party\r\nmember Utikal, that party member Dr. Lohse of the office of formative\r\nart is at your disposal for your personal wishes. This will be managed\r\nin the same way in the future. I should like to emphasize explicitly\r\nthat the new arrangement made in my bureaus in the West will in no way\r\nprejudice your wishes, but that the gentlemen of my Einsatzstab are\r\nat your disposal in the same way as before. I may ask you however, to\r\ncontinue to further the work of my Einsatzstab in the same way as you\r\nhave done hitherto, which is so worthy of thanks. I ask you especially\r\nto continue to give the chief of staff of my Einsatzstab, Reich office\r\nleader [Reichsamtsleiter] Utikal, the opportunity to report to you\r\nin especially important cases on the total work of the Einsatzstab.\r\nI have instructed party member Utikal to give you a report on the\r\ndifficulties which have arisen in connection with the Fuehrer edict of\r\n1 March 1942. It is so grotesque that difficulties should arise for my\r\nEinsatzstab from this liberal Fuehrer edict, you should know about it\r\nfor curiosity's sake alone. If you could intercede for my Einsatzstab\r\nin this connection, I would be very grateful to you in the interest of\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nSince you have already deposited sums in a special account for the art\r\nobjects which you have acquired, I would be grateful for information as\r\nto what use you had intended for the funds of this account. Please do\r\nnot take this question amiss or misinterpret it. I believe, however,\r\nthat we agree that the tasks of my Einsatzstab could and can be\r\ncarried out only on the basis of the fight of the NSDAP. Moreover, the\r\nReich Treasurer has liberally made available the means for carrying\r\nout these tasks. Therefore I believe that we also agree that the art\r\nobjects secured from Jewish possessions must be considered sequestered\r\nfor the benefit of the NSDAP. In regard to the research material the\r\nFuehrer has already decided that the supply secured by the Einsatzstab\r\nbe dedicated to the Hohe Schule. It would be no more than right for\r\nthe great values of the secured art treasures to be transferred to\r\nthe NSDAP some day. Of course it remains up to the Fuehrer himself to\r\ndispose of this matter. Since the NSDAP has financed the 20 year battle\r\nagainst Jewry, however, such a settlement would no doubt be admissible.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful to you if you could let me know your opinion on\r\nthis question some time, so that the corresponding suggestions can be\r\nmade to the Fuehrer at the proper time. Since the Reich Treasurer is\r\ncontinually making considerable means available for my Einsatzstab, you\r\ncan understand that I am interested in clearing up this question.\r\n\r\nAs I have been informed there are good working connections with\r\nvarious offices of your jurisdiction, especially in the work of the\r\nEinsatzstab in the East. In the future I shall continue to see to it\r\nthat everything of importance for your field of activity reaches you.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing a document from the work of my Einsatzstab in the East,\r\nwhich may interest you, the personally written biography of the Russian\r\nparachutist K. Kaitanow.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler\r\n  [no signature]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich\r\n  Berlin W8, Leipziger Str. 3, 30 May 1942\r\n  [stamped] Ministerial Office, received\r\n\r\n  4 June 1942, No 01141\r\n  [partly illegible notation] * * * 4 June * * *\r\n  GR (2?) Utikal * * *\r\n\r\n  Dear party member Rosenberg:\r\n\r\nYour Einsatzstab for the seizure of cultural goods in Paris has, I\r\nbelieve, received the false repute of dealing in art goods itself. I\r\nknow the work of the Einsatzstab very well and must say that there\r\nis no bureau which I can praise so unreservedly for its continued\r\nwork and initiative as this bureau with all its staff. I presumably\r\ngave occasion for the repute of dealing in art goods, because I asked\r\nseveral gentlemen who are especially well versed in the field, if\r\nduring their stay in Paris or France they should hear anywhere that\r\npictures or other art objects are to be put on the market by art\r\ndealers or private individuals, to look at these things and let me\r\nknow whether there is anything of interest for me among them. Since\r\nthe latter has often been the case, I then asked the gentlemen to do\r\nme a favor and acquire the things for me, for which purpose I placed a\r\nwarehouse at their disposal. Therefore, if some gentlemen were eager\r\nto establish contact with art dealers, it was exclusively a personal\r\nfavor which was being done for me and which benefits the expansion\r\nof my collection. Since many would-be purchasers are looking for art\r\nobjects in the occupied territory, I can imagine that they, perhaps\r\nin ignorance of the situation, or perhaps out of jealousy, falsely\r\nsuspected the gentlemen of your Einsatzstab.\r\n\r\nI feel obligated to offer you this explanation and to ask you that this\r\nprocedure may continue. On the other hand, I do support the work of\r\nyour Einsatzstab personally, wherever I can, and the fact that I was\r\nable to aid the Einsatzstab through my agencies is responsible for a\r\nlarge part of the seized cultural goods.\r\n\r\n  Greetings and Heil Hitler,\r\n  Your\r\n\r\n  [signed]: HERMANN GOERING\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  To the Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich,\r\n  Prime Minister Hermann Goering\r\n  Berlin W9, Leipziger Platz 7\r\n\r\n  11 January 1943\r\n  Charlottenburg 2\r\n  Bismarckstrasse 1\r\n\r\n  Dear Party member Goering:\r\n\r\nMy most cordial congratulations on your 50th birthday.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I think back to the first fighting years of our\r\nmovement, when I met you as a German officer at Adolf Hitler's. I think\r\nof your unqualified efforts for the Fuehrer and the long years of\r\nbattle, which finally led our movement to victory. Please be assured\r\nhow well I believe I understand what you have accomplished for the\r\npeople and the Fuehrer, and I wish you further determined, unbroken\r\nstrength to hold on to the victorious conclusion of this decisive\r\nbattle for the Reich for the coming years.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of giving you, as a friend of the plastic art, a\r\nDutch painting as a little remembrance for your museum. It was painted\r\nby Jacob Adriaensz Bellevois, comes from the 17th century, and is\r\ncalled \"Seascape\".\r\n\r\nTomorrow I shall offer you my personal congratulations on your\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler,\r\n  Yours respectfully,\r\n  [No signature]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1130-PS\r\n\r\n  Col. i.G. v.

Other documents on the\r\ncontents of the speech are not available here.\r\n\r\nI. On the _treatment of the population_ the Reich Commissar remarked in\r\nthe course of his speech in several places as follows:\r\n\r\n1. We are the master race and must govern hard but just * * *\r\n\r\n2. I will draw the very last out of this country. I did not come to\r\nspread bliss, I have come to help the Fuehrer. The population must\r\nwork, work, and work again * * * for some people are getting excited,\r\nthat the population may not get enough to eat. The population cannot\r\ndemand that. One has only to remember what our heroes were deprived of\r\nin Stalingrad * * * We definitely did not come here to give out manna,\r\nwe have come here to create the basis for victory.\r\n\r\n3. We are a master race, which must remember that the lowliest German\r\nworker is racially and biologically a thousand times more valuable than\r\nthe population here * * *\r\n\r\nII. Furthermore, the speech was primarily an appeal to all party\r\nmembers stationed in the Reich Commissariat of the Ukraine, to conduct\r\nthemselves perfectly in every respect and in any situation. In this\r\nconnection the Reich Commissar said the following among other things:\r\n\r\n1. * * * In the days of the crisis, one could differentiate between\r\nthree groups of people:\r\n\r\n 1. The group of those, that went about asking where one might be able\r\n to buy another suitcase;\r\n\r\n 2. The group of slogan manufacturers with the main slogan: \"One has to\r\n wait and see.\"\r\n\r\n 3. The group of real National Socialists, who said: \"Now of all times\r\n we will not move an inch from here!\"\r\n\r\nWith this third group we say: Whoever wallows in defeatism, who gripes,\r\nwill have trouble with this National Socialist community, gathered\r\nhere; he will get a slap in the face * * * We owe such conduct to the\r\nfront, which we would prefer to join if the Fuehrer would give us\r\npermission * * * There is not a single place at the front, at which the\r\nRussians could have forced us to retreat. The Russian has not been able\r\nto force his will upon us * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n2. * * * Nowdays, one often hears: \"Had we,\" or \"Were we.\" I only tell\r\nthese people one thing: Had one had more faith in Adolf Hitler and\r\nhad one taken a firmer grip at the sword, everything would have been\r\ndifferent * * *\r\n\r\n3. * * * We have brought you, my fellow party members to the Ukraine as\r\npersonalities but not for the purpose that you should write your papers\r\nas in a paper war. I have no objection if you want to get yourselves a\r\nrubber stamp, say \"Not important for the war.\" This stamp you can then\r\napply to those files which you consider superfluous or unnecessary for\r\nthese times. If your superiors do not understand this, tell them so. It\r\nis not the question to build up staffs, but to decrease them. I have\r\nreduced mine in Rowno from 800 to 250 staff members.\r\n\r\n  For the High Command of the Army Group B\r\n\r\n  Chief Quartermaster\r\n\r\n  Faehndrich\r\n\r\n  For correctness of copy:\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n  Lt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1138-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n\r\n  (II 1 d 3000)\r\n  THE REICH COMMISSAR FOR EASTLAND\r\n  RIGA                                Riga, 13 August 1941\r\n\r\n TO: The Reich Minister for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin W 35.\r\n\r\nI beg to enclose an account of planned provisional directives for\r\ntreatment of Jews in the Reichskommissariat Ostland.

It is merely the\r\njob of these preliminary directives to assure these, and for such\r\nlength of time, minimum measures by the General or Regional Commissars,\r\nwhere and for as long as further measures are not possible in the\r\ndirection of the final solution of the Jewish question.\r\n\r\nI. _a._ For the time being only those Jews will be subject to these\r\ndirectives who are citizens of the German Reich, the Protectorate of\r\nBohemia and Moravia, of the former Republics of Poland, Lithuania,\r\nLatvia, Estonia, of the USSR or of its component states, or stateless\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n_b._ Other Jews of foreign nationality, others of mixed blood\r\nand spouses of Jews who are not ready to share the fate of their\r\nJewish spouses are to be denied permission to leave the area of the\r\nReichskommissariat Ostland because it is a military area. They are\r\nto be watched. In addition they can be subjected to the following\r\nmeasures, among others: obligation to report daily, prohibition of\r\nmoving, or assignment to specific dwelling, prohibition of leaving the\r\nmunicipal area limitations on circulation. In case of necessity they\r\nare to be taken into police custody until further decisions can be made.\r\n\r\nII. A Jew is, whoever descends from at least 3 grandparents who were\r\nfull Jews by race.\r\n\r\n A Jew is also whoever descends from one or two grandparents who were\r\n full Jews by race, if he\r\n\r\n_a._ belongs or belonged to the Jewish denomination, or\r\n\r\n_b._ on 20 June 1941 or later was _married_ to, or living in common-law\r\nmarriage with, a person who is Jewish within the purview of these\r\ndirectives, or who now or in future enters into such a relationship.\r\n\r\nIII. In cases of doubt, the district (or municipal) Commissar decides,\r\naccording to his best judgment, who is a Jew within the purview of\r\nthese directives.\r\n\r\nIV. General Commissars will immediately order the following measures,\r\nas soon as or insofar as civil administration has been introduced in\r\ntheir areas:\r\n\r\n_a._ The Jews are to be listed, through imposition of the duty to\r\nreport, by name, sex, age, and address. Furthermore the rosters of\r\nJewish congregations, and the statements of trustworthy natives, will\r\nserve as bases for their listing.\r\n\r\n_b._ It will be decreed that Jews distinctively mark themselves by\r\nprominently visible yellow hexagonal stars of at least 10 cm. in\r\ndiameter worn on the left side of the breast and in the center of the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n_c._ Jews are prohibited from:\r\n\r\n 1. Changing of their home town and their homes without permission of\r\n the area (municipal) Commissar.\r\n\r\n 2. Use of sidewalks, public means of transportation (i.e., railroad,\r\n streetcars, bus, steamer, horse-drawn taxis) and automobiles.\r\n\r\n 3. Use of public facilities and institutions serving the population\r\n (resorts and bathing facilities, parks, meadows, playgrounds, and\r\n athletic fields).\r\n\r\n 4. Attendance at theatres, movies, libraries, museums.\r\n\r\n 5. Attendance at schools of any type.\r\n\r\n 6. The possession of automobiles and radio sets.\r\n\r\n 7. Kosher slaughtering.\r\n\r\n_d._ Jewish doctors and dentists may treat or advise only Jewish\r\npatients. If Ghettos or camps are erected, they are to be distributed\r\namong them for the care of their inmates. Jewish druggists are to be\r\npermitted practice of their profession according to need, but only in\r\nGhettos or camps. Drug stores previously managed by Jews are to be\r\ntransferred to trusteeship of Aryan druggists.\r\n\r\n Practice of their profession is prohibited to Jewish veterinarians.\r\n\r\n_e._ Jews are to be forbidden exercise of the professions and\r\nactivities designated below:\r\n\r\n 1. Activity as attorney, notary-public or legal adviser.\r\n\r\n 2. Operation of banks, money-changing offices and pawn shops.\r\n\r\n 3. Activity as representative, agent, and intermediary.\r\n\r\n 4. Trade in real estate.\r\n\r\n 5. Migratory trade.\r\n\r\n_f._ The following will be decreed for the handling of Jewish property:\r\n\r\n 1. _General._ The property of the Jewish population is to be\r\n confiscated and secured. The previous Jewish legal owner, from the\r\n moment of confiscation, is no longer authorized to dispose of his\r\n property. Legal transactions which violate this prohibition are null\r\n and void.\r\n\r\n 2. _Duty to report._ The entire property of the Jewish population\r\n is to be reported. The deadline for reporting is determined by the\r\n General or area Commissars. It is mandatory for anyone who owns or\r\n stores Jewish property and anyone who, without being owner, proprietor\r\n or custodian, legally or actually disposes of, or can dispose of,\r\n Jewish property, to report it.\r\n\r\n The duty to report not only applies to the legal Jewish owner, but\r\n also to anyone who, for example, administers Jewish property, who has\r\n taken it into safe-keeping or obtained it in any other manner.\r\n\r\n The reporting must be done on a form according to the attached model.\r\n\r\n The General Commissars regulate reporting procedure with regard to\r\n local conditions and determine the officials to whom the reports are\r\n to be submitted. The reports should be submitted, if possible, to the\r\n area commissars. The area commissars are, however, empowered also\r\n to be in charge of the giving out and the receiving of forms; this\r\n applies also to government offices which are not supplied or equipped\r\n by the civil administration. These offices are to forward the forms\r\n handed in to the area Commissars.\r\n\r\n3. _The duty of delivery._ Jewish property is to be delivered on\r\nspecial demand. The demand can take place by general proclamation or\r\nby order to definite individuals. The General Commissars order through\r\nproclamation immediate delivery of the following articles:\r\n\r\n _a._ Domestic and foreign currency.\r\n\r\n _b._ Securities and financial records of every sort, (i.e., stocks,\r\n promissory notes, exchange, debt records, bank and savings-bank books).\r\n\r\n _c._ All articles of value (coined and uncoined gold and silver, other\r\n precious metals, jewelry, precious stones, etc.).\r\n\r\n Articles turned in are to be entered in a serially numbered receipt\r\n book in two copies (carbon) according to the attached model. The\r\n entries are to be signed for by the person delivering the article\r\n and by the receiving office. The carbon copy of the entry is to be\r\n transmitted immediately by the receiving office to the area Commissar.\r\n The delivered articles are to be transmitted to the fund of the area\r\n Commissar and to be safeguarded by the latter. A special order will be\r\n issued on their utilization.\r\n\r\n4. _On the Question of Subsistence_: The Jewish population is left with\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n _a._ that portion of their household articles necessary for scanty\r\n subsistence (furniture, clothing and linen)\r\n\r\n _b._ A daily amount of money 0.20 RM (2 Rubles) for each Jewish member\r\n of the household, the amount of money for a month to be released in\r\n advance.\r\n\r\nV. The following further measures are to be emphatically striven for,\r\nwith due consideration for local and especially economic conditions:\r\n\r\n_a._ Jews are to be cleaned out from the countryside.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Jews are to be removed from all trade, especially from trade\r\nwith agricultural products and other food-stuffs.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Jews are to be forbidden residence in resorts and spas, and\r\nin localities that are economically, militarily, or spiritually of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_d._ Jews are to be concentrated, as much as feasible, in cities or in\r\nsections of large cities, whose population is already predominantly\r\nJewish. Ghettos are to be established there, and the Jews are to be\r\nprohibited from leaving these Ghettos. In the Ghettos they are to be\r\ngiven only as much food as the rest of the population can do without,\r\nbut no more than suffices for scanty nourishment of the Ghetto inmates.\r\nThe same applies to supply with other consumer goods. The inmates of\r\nthe Ghetto regulate their internal conditions by self-administration\r\nwhich is supervised respectively by the city, area Commissar or his\r\ndeputy. Jews can be assigned as police for internal order. They are\r\nto be equipped with rubber truncheons or sticks at most and are to be\r\ndistinguished by the wearing of the white arm bands, with the yellow\r\nJewish Star on the right upper arm. For the external hermetic sealing\r\nof the Ghettos, auxiliary police from among the natives are to be used\r\nas much as is feasible. Permission from the area Commissar must be\r\nobtained before anyone may enter the Ghetto.\r\n\r\n_e._ Jews, capable of working, are to be drafted for forced labor\r\naccording to the need for work. The economic interests of natives\r\nworthy of assistance must not be interfered with by Jewish forced\r\nlabor. Forced labor can be performed in working parties outside the\r\nGhettos or in the Ghettos, or, where Ghettos are not yet established;\r\nalso individually outside (i.e., in the work-shop of the Jew). Pay\r\nneed not correspond to work done; it need only correspond to the need\r\nfor scanty subsistance for the forced laborer and the non-employable\r\nmembers of his family, taking due consideration to his present cash\r\nholdings. (cf. IV f 4 b) Those private establishments and persons, for\r\nwhose account the forced labor is done, pay an appropriate fee to the\r\npay office of the area Commissar which, in turn, disburses pay to the\r\nforced laborers. A special order will be issued for the accounting on\r\namounts of money received.\r\n\r\n6. It is left up to the General Commissars to order measures mentioned\r\nin par. 5 uniformly for their area or to turn over their promulgation\r\nin detail to the Area Commissars. Likewise the General Commissars are\r\nauthorized to issue more detailed orders within the framework of this\r\npolicy or to authorize their area Commissars to do it.\r\n\r\n  DISTRIBUTION:\r\n    Reichskommissariat 12\r\n    Higher SS and Police leaders 20\r\n    General Commissar:\r\n      Estonia 10\r\n      Lithuania 10\r\n      Latvia 10\r\n      White Ruthenia 60\r\n    Surplus supply 28\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1141-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n THE REICHMINISTER AND CHIEF OF THE REICH CHANCELLERY.\r\n\r\n Rk 25018B BERLIN 17 September 1939.\r\n\r\n TO: the President of the Council of Ministers for the Defense of the\r\n Reich [Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung] General Field Marshal\r\n Goering.

I believe we will have to take some steps so that the\r\nmatter will not be procured secretly for the Stahlhelm.\r\n\r\nThis report is not known to anybody else. I intentionally did not\r\ninform even our own long friend. I am enclosing an additional copy for\r\nHess, and ask you to transmit the letter to Hess, by messenger, as I\r\ndo not want to write a letter to Hess for fear that it might be read\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n  With best regards.\r\n  Yours Amo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAIR FORCE ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nPurpose: Preparation of material and training of personnel to provide\r\nfor the case of the armament of the air force.\r\n\r\nEntire management as a civilian organization will be transferred to\r\nColonel von Willberg (at present Commander of Breslau) who, retaining\r\nhis position in the Reichwehr, is going on leave of absence.\r\n\r\nA. Organizing the pilots of civilian airlines in such a way as to\r\nenable their transfer to the air force organization.\r\n\r\nB. Prospects to train crews for military flying. Training to be\r\ndone within the organization for military flying of the Stahlhelm\r\nwhich is being turned over to Colonel Haenel, retired, all existing\r\norganizations for sport flying are to be used for military flying.\r\n\r\nDirections on kinds and tasks of military flying will be issued by the\r\nStahlhelm directorate.\r\n\r\nThe Stahlhelm organization will pay the military pilots MK 50 per hour\r\nflight. These are due to the owner of the plane in case he himself\r\ncarries out the flight.\r\n\r\nThey are to be divided in case of non-owners of the plane between\r\nflight organization proprietor and crew in the proportion of 10 to 20\r\nto 20.\r\n\r\nMilitary flying is now paid better than flying for advertisement (40).\r\nWe therefore have to expect that most proprietors of planes or flying\r\nassociations will go over to the Stahlhelm organization. It must be\r\nachieved that equal conditions will be granted by the RWM, also the\r\nNSDAP organizations.\r\n\r\nMy own note: Hereby the entire organization of military flying is being\r\nturned over to the Stahlhelm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1151-P-PS\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n\r\n  SS Main Management and Administrative Office [WVHA]\r\n  Department D--Concentration Camp--\r\n  D I/1/ AZ: 14 f 13/Ot./U.\r\n  Secret Nr. 177/42\r\n  Oranienburg, 26 March 1942\r\n  [Stamp]\r\n  Concentration Camp Gross-Rosen\r\n  Entered 28 March 1942\r\n  _Subject_: Special Treatment 14 f 13\r\n  _Reference_: None\r\n  _Annex_: None\r\n\r\n To the Camp Commandant of the Concentration Camps, Da., Sar., Bu.,\r\n Mau., Flo., Neu., Aw., Gr.-Ro., Nie., Rav.,\r\n\r\nIt became known through a report of a Camp Commandant that 42 prisoners\r\nout of 51 which were mustered out for the special treatment 14 f 13\r\n\"again became capable of work\" after a period of time and therefore do\r\nnot have to be directed to the special treatment.

He agrees to direction of offices by officers, in\r\nindividual instances, particularly in the case of General Schubert.\r\n_The Reich Marshall will talk personally to the Directors of the\r\nEconomy Inspectorates._ Hanneken is to name the best personnel in\r\nEconomy.\r\n\r\n2. The directives worked out by the Wi for destructive measures to be\r\nundertaken by the Luftwaffe in the \"Fall Barbarossa\" were agreed to by\r\nthe Reich Marshall. One copy was handed to Captain von Brauchitsch to\r\nbe forwarded to the General Staff of the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\n3. _Report on the India-rubber situation._ The Reich Marshall agrees\r\nthat from now on transportation of India-rubber shall be carried out\r\nby ship using blockade runners, also utilizing the Japanese for these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n4. _Report on storage of fuels_ in Holland and security measures\r\nagainst bombing attacks.\r\n\r\n  [in pencil] BDC--GOTHA--Old I\r\n\r\n5.

Report on differences between the Navy [Kriegsmarine] and Ministry\r\nfor Labor concerning the wage increase in Naval dockyards.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall wishes that the measures proposed by Reichtrustee\r\nshould be carried out, will however still call a meeting on the problem\r\npersonally. [IV. Armament (Rue)]\r\n\r\n7. The organizing of additional fire-guards because of increasing\r\ndanger from the air to factories important to war economy\r\n[Wehrwirtschaftsbetriebe] is authorized. [Armament (Rue) III]\r\n\r\n8. The Reich Marshall has already given his directives to the\r\nLuftwaffe in the exports sphere [Auslandslieferungen] concerning the\r\nFinnish deliveries. He wishes _delivery of a number of anti-aircraft\r\ngun-batteries and some airplanes_. [Armament (Rue) II]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian demands for search lights and listening devices shall be\r\nnegotiated once more with General [Generaloberst] Udet. [Economy (WI)]\r\n\r\n9. The Reich Marshall is informed that a large number of foreigners\r\nare still working in the fuel-production [Treibstoffbetriebe]. [III\r\nArmament (Rue)]\r\n\r\nHe wishes that Poles, French and Russians disappear from the fuel and\r\nbuna factories and be replaced by other people. The Reich Minister for\r\nLabor is to institute further action. [--enclosure--finished 21 March]\r\n\r\n10. Report on the demands of Governor General Frank concerning Armed\r\nForces Factories [Wehrmachtsbetriebe] in Poland.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall decides that purely Armed Forces Factories are to\r\nbelong to the Sections of the Armed Forces concerned, the factories\r\nfor raw material to the Reichworks. Appropriate directive shall be\r\nsubmitted to him. [II Armament (Rue)]\r\n\r\n11. Orientation of the Reich Marshall on the negotiations between\r\nFrance and America with regard to fuel supplies to North Africa.\r\n\r\nHe is of the opinion that it is important to get the fuel to Africa, it\r\nis unimportant which ships are used.\r\n\r\nColonel Spalcke informs the Reich Marshall of the orders which General\r\nAntonescu has given to Germany, of the capacities of Rumania and of the\r\ncollaboration as regards fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall's opinion is that Rumania should supply at the most\r\n20 divisions and that the point must be reached where supplies for\r\nthe Rumanian Army in Rumania should eventually be provided by Rumania\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Rumania must be fully utilized to provide means of\r\ntransportation and for the establishing of repair shops on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nConcerning the collaboration as regards fuel with the Neubacher Office,\r\nagreement must be reached first of all between the Four Year Plan, the\r\nMinistry of Economy and the Office for War Mobilization of Economy.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall was then further informed by me of the purchase\r\nof trucks from France and of the negotiations in regard to the\r\nIndia-rubber contract.\r\n\r\nThe Reichmarshall then demanded the following himself:\r\n\r\n 1. He wants to know if the dockyards in Rumania could be used for the\r\n building of submarines. [Armament II (Rue)]\r\n\r\n 2. He wishes a report on the negotiations of the Ministry\r\n for Communications [Verkehrsministerium] with regard to the\r\n transit-difficulties with Russia.

In the last two, economic matters are dealt with by the\r\nIV Econ (IV Wi) of the Army Headquarters Commands, i.e. the liaison\r\nofficer of the industrial armament office within the supreme command\r\nof the armed forces at the army headquarters commands. For the _battle\r\narea_, he has attached to him: technical battalions, reconnaissance and\r\nrecovery troops for raw materials, mineral oil, agricultural machinery,\r\nin particular tractors and means of production.\r\n\r\nIn the territory between the battle and the military rear area,\r\nthe _rear area of the Army_, group IV Econs at the various field\r\ncommands are placed at the disposal of the liaison officer of the\r\nindustrial armaments office in order to support the army headquarter\r\ncommands specialists responsible for supplying the troops from the\r\ncountry's resources and for preparing the subsequent general economic\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nWhile these units move with the troops, economic inspectorates,\r\neconomic commands and their sub-offices remain established in the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nThe new feature inherent in the organization under the command of the\r\nEconomic Staff Oldenburg is that it does not only deal with military\r\nindustry, but comprises the _entire_ economic field. Consequently,\r\nall offices are no longer to be designated as offices of the military\r\nindustries or armaments, but quite generally as economic inspectorates,\r\neconomic commands etc.\r\n\r\nThis also corresponds with the internal organization of the individual\r\noffices which, from the Economic Staff Oldenburg down to the economic\r\ncommands, requires a standard sub-division into three large groups, i.e.\r\n\r\n _Group M_ dealing with troop requirements, armaments, industrial\r\n transport organization\r\n\r\n _Group L_ which concerns itself with all questions of food and\r\n agriculture, and\r\n\r\n _Group W_ which is in charge of the entire field of trade and\r\n industry, including raw materials and suppliers, further questions of\r\n forestry, finance and banking, enemy property, commerce and exchange\r\n of commodities and manpower allocation.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Backe is appointed Commissioner for Food and\r\nAgriculture in the General Staff; the problems falling within the field\r\nof activities of Group W are dealt with by General v. Hanneken.\r\n\r\nBefore giving further details of the particulars of organization and\r\nstaffing of Group M, of which we have to take charge, here is a short\r\nsummary on the plans.\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n  _Local Sub-Division_\r\n\r\n(Map already handed over) may entries explain code-names?\r\n\r\nOf the 5 inspectorates, 4 have been established from the outset, while\r\nthe 5th remains in reserve for an assignment temporarily undecided.\r\n\r\n                                          { Vilna\r\n    1. _Leningrad_ (_Holstein_) { Riga\r\n        with economic commands at         { Reval\r\n                                          { Leningrad\r\n                                          { Murmansk\r\n\r\n        and sub-offices at                     { Wologda\r\n                                               { Archangel\r\n\r\n                                          { Minsk\r\n    2. _Moscow_ (_Saxony_)      { Moscow\r\n        with economic commands at         { Tula\r\n                                          { Gorki\r\n\r\n                                               { Briansk\r\n        and sub-offices at                     { Jaroslawl\r\n                                               { Rybinsk\r\n\r\n                                          { Lddz\r\n                                          { Kiev\r\n                                          { Kishinev\r\n    3. _Kiev_ (_Baden_)         { Odessa\r\n        with economic commands at         { Charkov\r\n                                          { Knjepropetrovsk\r\n                                          { Stalino\r\n                                          { Rostov\r\n                                          { Stalingrad\r\n\r\n                                               { Sevastopol\r\n        and sub-offices at                     { Kerch\r\n                                               { Voronesh\r\n                                               { Kursk\r\n\r\n    Finally\r\n\r\n    4. _Baku_ (_Westphalia_)    { Krasnodar\r\n      with economic commands at           { Grozny\r\n                                          { Tiflis\r\n                                          { Baku\r\n\r\n      and a sub-office at                      Batum.\r\n\r\nBesides the 5th inspectorate, with the code-name of Hesse, an economic\r\ncommand (Borkum) and 2 sub-offices are held in reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe question is now how best to take into account local and technical\r\nrequirements in staffing the individual offices.\r\n\r\nIn the Economic Staff Oldenburg and in the economic inspectorates,\r\nwhich in all essentials have the same organization, a differentiation\r\naccording to geographical points of view appears unnecessary, as in\r\neach of the gigantic fields of activity every type of question arises\r\nand therefore all departments must be staffed.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen will therefore find in the strength reports, which are in\r\ntheir hands, both in the Economic Staff Oldenburg and in all economic\r\ninspectorates, after each C.O. and his personal assistant a _staff\r\ngroup_, which in accordance with the scheme submitted to you contains:\r\n\r\n  the adjutants's office,\r\n  the office for the establishment of the authorities,\r\n  counter-intelligence,\r\n  signals and communications,\r\n  command of the staff quartermaster,\r\n  messing officer, and\r\n  interpreter.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, _Group M_ is to be staffed uniformly with all\r\nbranches of the armed forces (army, navy, air, administration) and the\r\ntransport, technical, general and military supplies divisions. It is\r\nimpossible to effect any economics here.\r\n\r\n_Economic commands_ also start from the common denominator of a normal\r\nstrength which is likewise submitted to you. It is however neither\r\nnecessary, nor desirable to fill it in all economic commands to the\r\nfull extent or in an equal measure; the decisive factors here are the\r\nindividual peculiarities of the various regions.\r\n\r\nIn all economic commands, the posts in the staff group, transport,\r\ntechnical and general offices will have to be filled. But whether\r\nthe individual _branches of the armed forces_ wish to be represented\r\nin the respective economic command will depend essentially on whether\r\nthe branch of the armed forces in question has any interests of any\r\nsignificance to look after in the territory.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that the whole organization requires a\r\ngigantic staff apparatus and that, in view of the general lack of\r\nqualified personnel, only such posts can be filled as are justified by\r\npractical necessity.\r\n\r\nThe branches of the armed forces will therefore have to decide in which\r\nof the 23 economic commands they wish to be represented. To fill all 4\r\noffices of army, navy, air and administration will be necessary only\r\nin a few centrally situated spots. If on the other hand in some cases\r\n_all_ branches of the armed forces require no representation, we would\r\nsubstitute for the planned division into 4 parts, a joint office for\r\narmament industry and staff it from the Office of Industrial Armament.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of speed--the establishment has to be completed by\r\nthe 15th May--we have to request the branches of the armed forces to\r\ncommunicate their decision to the Office of Industrial Armament by\r\nFriday 2nd May.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare to a large extent and to facilitate this decision,\r\nCaptain (Cav.) Jonas, who has a profound knowledge in this field, has\r\ncompiled a list, on which after the name of each economic command he\r\nhas indicated by means of the initial of the branch of the armed forces\r\nin question which of these branches is in his opinion likely * * *\r\nrepresent * * * by an office.\r\n\r\nThe material has been submitted to you in the form of the lengthy\r\ntreatise R., in particular in the form of the economic map and the\r\nlist showing all firms which are important from the point of view of\r\nindustrial armaments. In order, however, to assist the gentlemen to\r\nform their own opinion in the short time at our disposal, Captain (Cav)\r\nJonas will now illustrate the peculiarities of the different areas in\r\nthe field of industrial armament by means of a short lecture.\r\n\r\n  _Lecture Captain (Cav.) Jonas._\r\n  _Further Points to be discussed_\r\n\r\n_a._ In the interests of staff economy, we want to staff some of the\r\nabove-mentioned authorities by enlisting personnel from authorities\r\nalready existing in occupied territories, e.g. the _Moscow Economic\r\nInspectorate_ is to be staffed by the armament industry office (Rue In\r\nA) to be withdrawn from France.\r\n\r\n  _Murmansk Economic Command_ is to be staffed from _Norway_\r\n  _Moscow Economic Command_ by _Troppau Armament Command_\r\n  _Lodz Economic Command_ by _Radom Armament Command_\r\n  _Sevastopol Sub-Office_ by _Aarhus Sub-Office_.\r\n\r\n Even though these units will have to be brought up to the required\r\n strength and supplemented, their employment at least creates a basis\r\n and thus effects a considerable economy in staff.\r\n\r\n_b._ Which members of branches of the armed forces are already\r\nearmarked for Rue VI?\r\n\r\n_c._ In which economic commands are the commander or for instance the\r\nhead of the transport office to be appointed from the members of a\r\nbranch of the armed forces which has an overriding interest?\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1161-PS\r\n\r\n Defense Economics--and--Armament Office [Wehrwirtschafts--und\r\n Ruestungsamt]\r\n\r\n  Az. Stab I a Nr. 1134/40\r\n  Berlin, 31 May 1940\r\n\r\n To Gen Qu (General Headquarters) through VO Major Dr. Just\r\n\r\nI. In the enclosure is forwarded a map on which are marked the\r\nboundaries for the economic teams anticipated in France. The\r\nterritorial distribution of economic teams has followed the same\r\nprinciples as were used in the creation of the teams for Belgium and\r\nHolland. The boundaries are established according to the economic\r\nstructure of the districts. In them are located individual industrial\r\nconcentrations which will be the main fields of work for the teams.\r\nSince the whole area without exception had to be divided up the working\r\nareas of the individual teams appear relatively large, however the\r\nworking power of the teams will not be visibly influenced thereby,\r\nsince only a few additions lie outside the industrial centers.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries are and must be established for the above named\r\nreasons without regard to later commitment of main field commands\r\n[Oberfeldkommandanturen] and/or sections of the AOK (Army High Command).\r\n\r\nII. It is requested that the economic teams be instructed to send\r\ntheir reports directly to Gen Qu and at the same time to Oberkommando\r\nder Wehrmacht Wirtschaft Ruestungsamt. The purpose of the commitment\r\nof the economic teams is the most rapid instruction of the OKW/Wi Rue\r\nAmt concerning existing raw materials which must be brought--trainload\r\nafter trainload--to finishing plants in the occupied territories and\r\nin the Reich, according to the requirements of manufacturing programs.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the last three weeks have shown that the channels\r\nprescribed for this purpose have entirely failed. So far, except for\r\na single message which reached the OKW directly, the OKW has received\r\nno report from the economic teams. This situation must be changed as\r\nquickly as possible by the forwards administrative posts, without\r\nconsideration of possible questions of competence but from the purest\r\nmaterial viewpoint, all the more as the life expectancy of the military\r\ngovernment in Belgium, as also that of Holland, may be of short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n  I.A.\r\n  signature\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1162-PS\r\n\r\n  ORDER\r\n\r\nBY ORDER of the German Wehrmacht all men from 17 up to and including 40\r\nyears old must register for the Labour Service.\r\n\r\nImmediately on receipt of this order ALL men within this age-group must\r\nappear in the street with the required equipment.\r\n\r\nAll other inhabitants, women and children included, must stay in their\r\nhouses until the operation is completed.

Therefore the impression has arisen that the\r\nStalags are getting rid of such prisoners in this way.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly noted that, when marching, for example from the\r\nrailroad station to the camp, a rather large number of PWs collapsed on\r\nthe way from exhaustion, either dead or half dead, and had to be picked\r\nup by a truck following the convoy.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be prevented that the German people take notice of these\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nEven if the transportation to the camps is generally taken care of by\r\nthe Wehrmacht, the population will still attribute this situation to\r\nthe SS.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent, if possible, similar occurrences in the future,\r\nI therefore order that, effective from today on, Soviet Russians,\r\ndeclared definitely suspect and obviously marked by death (for example\r\nwith typhus) and who therefore would not be able to withstand the\r\nexertions of even a short march on foot, shall in the future, as a\r\nmatter of basic principle, be excluded from the transport into the\r\nconcentration camps for execution.\r\n\r\nI request that the leaders of the Einsatzkommandos be correspondingly\r\ninformed of this decision without delay.\r\n\r\n    _Distribution_:\r\n        All offices of the State Police\r\n        To the CO of the SIPO and the SD Metz\r\n        To the CO of the SIPO and the SD Strassburg\r\n    _For the information of_:\r\n        The Reichsfuehrer SS and the Chief of the German police\r\n        The Chief of the SIPO and the SD\r\n        The Chiefs of Departments I to VII\r\n        Gruppenleiter IVD SS Lt Col Dr Weinmann\r\n        The higher SS and Police Chiefs--except in the Hague\r\n        The Inspectors of the SIPO and the SD\r\n        The Commanders in Chief of the SIPO and the SD--except\r\n          in Metz and Strassburg\r\n        The Commanders of the SIPO and the SD\r\n\r\n    The Inspectors of the concentration camps\r\n\r\n    All commandants of the concentration camps\r\n\r\n    For:\r\n\r\n    signed: MUELLER\r\n\r\n    Certified:\r\n\r\n    signed: L.

Their durability, in comparison with new articles is very\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nFurther it must be kept in mind that the employment of prisoners in\r\nspecial measures [Sondermassnahmen] A and B is a great strain on\r\nclothes and footwear and the expected durability must be decreased.\r\n\r\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, I would ask you, Gruppenfuehrer, to\r\nbe so kind as to request that Reich Ministry of Economics to take the\r\nnecessary steps so that further special allotments of yarn and leather\r\nmay be assigned to meet the exceedingly great need for prisoners'\r\nclothing. Mention might also be made to the Reich Ministry of Economics\r\nthat, up to the present, enormous quantities of rags of unusable\r\ncivilian clothes, from the various actions, have been sent for disposal\r\nfrom Auschwitz and other camps to the Reich Ministry of Economics, and\r\nmore are to follow.\r\n\r\n  Head of Administration\r\n  [initial illegible]\r\n  SS Sturmbannfuehrer\r\n  [Burger]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: including approx. 387,000 men and 225,000 women.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1168-PS\r\n\r\n Memorandum from SCHACHT to HITLER, [Identified by SCHACHT on 16\r\n October 1945]\r\n\r\n  May 3, 1935\r\n\r\n  _Financing of Armament_\r\n\r\nThe following explanations are based upon the thought, that the\r\naccomplishment of the armament program with speed and in quantity\r\nis the problem of German politics, that everything else therefore\r\nshould be subordinated to this purpose, as long as the main purpose\r\nis not imperilled by neglecting all other questions. Even after March\r\n16, 1935 the difficulty remains, that one cannot undertake the open\r\npropagandistic treatment of the German people for support of armament\r\nwithout endangering our position internationally (without loss to our\r\nforeign trade). The already nearly impossible financing of the armament\r\nprogram is rendered hereby exceptionally difficult.\r\n\r\nAnother supposition must be also emphasized. The printing press can be\r\nused only for the financing of armament to such a degree, as permitted\r\nby maintaining of the money value. Every inflation increases the\r\nprices of foreign raw materials and increases the domestic prices, is\r\ntherefore like a snail biting its own tail. The circumstance that our\r\narmament had to be camouflaged completely till March 16, 1935 and even\r\nsince this date the camouflage had to be continued to a larger extent,\r\nmaking it necessary to use the printing press (bank note press) already\r\nat the beginning of the whole armament program, while it would have\r\nbeen natural, to start it (the printing press) at the final point of\r\nfinancing. In the portfolio of the Reichsbank are segregated notes (for\r\nthis purpose: armament) of 3,775 millions and 866 millions, altogether\r\n4,641 millions, out of which the armament notes amount to RM 2,374\r\nmillions (Status of April 30, 1935). The Reichsbank has invested the\r\namount of marks under its jurisdiction, but belonging to foreigners\r\nin * * * notes of armament. Our armaments are also financed partly\r\nwith the credits of our political opponents. Furthermore 500 million\r\nReichsmarks were used for financing of armament, which originated out\r\nof Reichsanleihe [Federal loans] placed with savings banks. In the\r\nregular budget the following amounts were provided. For the budget\r\nperiod 1933/34 RM 750 millions, for the budget period 1934/35 RM 1,100\r\nmillions, and for the budget period 1935/36 RM 2,500 millions.\r\n\r\nThe amount of deficits of the budget since 1928 increases after the\r\nbudget 1935/36 to 5-6 millions RM. This total deficit is already\r\nfinanced at the present time by short term credits of the money market.\r\nIt therefore reduces in advance the possibilities of utilization of\r\nthe public market for the armament. The Minister of Finance correctly\r\npoints out at the defense of the budget: As a permanent yearly deficit\r\n* * * is an impossibility; as we cannot figure with security with\r\nincreased tax revenues in amount balancing the deficit and any other\r\nprevious debits, as on the other hand a balanced budget is the only\r\nsecure basis for the impending great task of military policy, for all\r\nthese reasons we have to put in motion a fundamental and conscious\r\nbudget policy which solves the problem of armament financing by\r\norganic and planned reduction of other expenditures not only from the\r\npoint of receipt, but also from the point of expenditure, e.g., by\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\nHow urgent this question is, can be deducted from the following, that\r\na large amount of task has been started by the state and party and\r\nwhich is now in process, all of which are not covered by the budget,\r\nbut from contributions and credits, which have to be raised by industry\r\nin addition to the regular taxes. The existing of various budgets\r\nside by side, which serve more or less public tasks, is the greatest\r\nimpediment for gaining a clear view over the possibilities of financing\r\nthe armaments. A whole number of ministries and various branches of the\r\nparty have their own budgets, and for this reason have possibilities\r\nof incomes and expenses, though based on the sovereignty of finance of\r\nthe state, but not subject to the control of the Minister of Finance\r\nand therefore also not subject to the control of the cabinet. Just\r\nas on the sphere of politics the much too far reaching delegation of\r\nlegislative powers to individuals brought about various states within\r\nthe states, exactly in the same way the condition of various branches\r\nof state and party, working side by side and against each other, has\r\na devastating effect on the possibility of financing. If on this\r\nterritory concentration and unified control is not introduced very\r\nsoon, the solution of the already impossible task of armament financing\r\nis endangered.\r\n\r\nWe have the following tasks:\r\n\r\n(1) A deputy is entrusted finding all sources and revenues, which have\r\nits origin in contributions to the Federal government, to the state and\r\nparty and in profits of public and party enterprises.\r\n\r\n(2) Furthermore experts, entrusted by the Fuehrer, have to examine, how\r\nthese amounts were used and which of these amounts can in the future be\r\nwithdrawn from their previous purpose.\r\n\r\n(3) The same experts have to examine the investments of all public and\r\nparty organizations, to which extent this property can be used for the\r\npurpose of armament financing.\r\n\r\n(4) The federal ministry of finances is to be entrusted to examine the\r\npossibilities of increased revenues by way of new taxes or increasing\r\nof existing taxes.\r\n\r\nThe up-to-date financing of armaments by the Reichsbank under existing\r\npolitical conditions was a necessity and the political success proved\r\nthe correctness of this action. The other possibilities of armament\r\nfinancing have to be started now under any circumstances. For this\r\npurpose all absolutely non-essential expenditures for other purposes\r\nhave not to take place and the total financial strength of Germany,\r\nlimited as it is, has to be concentrated for the one purpose of\r\narmament financing. Whether the problem of financing, as outlined in\r\nprogram, succeeds, remains to be seen, but without such concentration\r\nit will fail with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1183-PS\r\n\r\n  COPY\r\n  The Commissioner for the Four Year Plan\r\n  Department Arbeitseinsatz\r\n  Berlin SW 11, Saarlandstr. 96, 29 Jan 1942\r\n  V a 552/27\r\n  Express Letter!\r\n  To:--\r\n\r\n The Government of the Government-General\r\n\r\n Main Labor Division, _Cracow_:\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissioner for the occupied Norwegian territories,\r\n\r\n Labor and Social Division, _Oslo_\r\n\r\n via the bureau of the Reich Commissioner for the occupied Norwegian\r\n territories.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Commissioner for the occupied Dutch territories, _The Hague_;\r\n\r\nThe Military Administrator for Belgium and Northern France,\r\n\r\n Economic Division, Group VII (Arbeitseinsatz), _Brussels_.\r\n\r\nThe Military Administrator in France,\r\n\r\n Administrative Staff, Economic Division, _Paris_;\r\n\r\nThe Plenipotentiary for Economics in Serbia\r\n\r\n Command Officer, _Semlin near Belgrade_;\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Civilian Administration in _Luxemburg_;\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Civilian Administration in Lorraine, _Metz_;\r\n\r\n  and\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Civilian Administration in Alsace, _Straszburg_.\r\n\r\n Subject: Increased mobilization of man-power for the German Reich from\r\n the occupied territories and preparations for mobilization by force.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the labor shortage which was rendered more acute by\r\nthe draft for the Wehrmacht, and on the other hand, the increased\r\nscope of the armament problem in the German Reich, render it necessary\r\nthat man-power for service in the Reich be recruited from the occupied\r\nterritories to a much greater extent than heretofore, in order to\r\nrelieve the shortage of labor. Therefore, any and all methods must be\r\nadopted which make possible the transportation, without exception and\r\ndelay, for employment in the German Reich, of man-power in the occupied\r\nterritories which is unemployed or which can be released for use in\r\nGermany after most careful screening.\r\n\r\n  To the High Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  Wi Rue Amt Berlin W 35\r\n  [Page 2]\r\n\r\nThis mobilization shall first of all, as heretofore, be carried out\r\non a voluntary basis. For this reason, the recruiting effort for\r\nemployment in the German Reich must be strengthened considerably. But\r\nif satisfactory results are to be obtained, the German authorities,\r\nwho are functioning in the occupied territories, must be able to exert\r\nany pressure necessary to support the voluntary recruiting of labor\r\nfor employment in Germany. Accordingly, to the extent that may be\r\nnecessary, the regulations in force in the occupied territories in\r\nregard to shift in employment and withdrawal of support upon refusal\r\nto work, must be tightened. Supplementary regulations concerning shift\r\nin employment must above all ensure that older personnel who are\r\nfreed must be exchanged for younger personnel to make up for it, so\r\nthat the latter may be made available for the Reich. A far-reaching\r\ndecrease in the amount of relief granted by Public Welfare must also\r\nbe effected in order to induce laborers to accept employment in the\r\nReich. Unemployment relief must be set so low that the amount in\r\ncomparison with the average wages in the Reich and the possibilities\r\nthere for sending remittances home may serve as an inducement to accept\r\nemployment in the Reich. When refusal to accept work in the Reich is\r\nnot justified, the compensation must be reduced to an amount barely\r\nenough for subsistence, or even be cancelled. In this connection,\r\npartial withdrawal of ration cards and assignment to particularly heavy\r\nobligatory labor may be considered.\r\n\r\nHowever, all misgivings must give way before the necessity of supplying\r\nthe deficit in man-power caused by excessive draft calls into the Armed\r\nForces, in order to avoid detriment to the armament industry. For\r\nthis purpose the forcible mobilization of workers from the occupied\r\nterritories cannot be disregarded, in case the voluntary recruiting is\r\nunsuccessful. The mere possibility of mobilization by force will, in\r\nmany cases, make recruiting easier.\r\n\r\n  [Page 3]\r\n\r\nTherefore, I ask you immediately to take any measures in your district\r\nwhich will promote the employment of workers in the German Reich on\r\na voluntary basis. I herewith request you to prepare for publication\r\nregulations applying to forced mobilization of laborers from your\r\nterritory for Germany, so that they may be decreed at once, in case\r\nrecruiting on a voluntary basis will not have the desired result, that\r\nis relief of the man-power shortage in the Reich.

He therefore\r\ndesires that within these territories he should also be authorized to\r\ngive orders concerning measures with regard to the Four Year Plan.\r\nHe is willing, however, to follow those directives which the Reich\r\nMarshall, in his capacity as a delegate for the Four Year Plan, has\r\ngiven personally. Rosenberg, therefore, suggested that the delegate\r\nfor the Four Year Plan should use the Reich Minister for the Occupied\r\nEastern Territories as his Plenipotentiary General for carrying out his\r\ntasks in the newly occupied eastern territories. The latter should then\r\nreceive orders from him (Goering) for that purpose. The Reich Marshall\r\nturned down such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn the event that Reichsleiter Rosenberg's suggestion is disapproved\r\nby the Fuehrer, Rosenberg at least wants to be able to coordinate\r\nmeasures taken by him as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern\r\nTerritories with those measures taken by the delegate of the Four Year\r\nPlan. In order to make sure of that he desires to insert after the word\r\n\"jurisdiction\" [Befugnisse] in Paragraph 1 the words \"via the Reich\r\nMinister for the Eastern Occupied Territories\".\r\n\r\nReichsleiter Rosenberg, furthermore, has misgivings relative to the\r\npublication of this decree, since it left no doubt that Germany was\r\nonly interested in the occupied eastern territories for purposes\r\nof extreme economic exploitation. If that became known in these\r\nterritories the political reaction there will be disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1189-PS\r\n\r\n  in the field 4/11/1941\r\n  Wi Stab Ost Fue/Ia, Az.B.NR. 6730/41\r\n\r\n  Special Instructions No. 44\r\n  Feeding of Civilian Population in the occupied Eastern Territories\r\n\r\n  Weekly Maximum in Grams\r\n\r\n  a. _For population which does no work worth mentioning._\r\n       Meat and meat products  none\r\n       Fat                       70\r\n       Bread                   1500\r\n       Potatoes                2000\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  d. _Children under 14 years old and Jews_:\r\n      Half of the maximum according to a.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1193-PS\r\n\r\n  SECRET\r\n  The Reich Marshall of the Greater German Reich\r\n  Deputy for the Four Year Plan\r\n  _The State Secretary_\r\n  Berlin W 8, Leipziger Str. 3, 14 November 1941\r\n  V.P. 19008/2 Secret.\r\n\r\nIn the annexes I submit, in three copies, a note on the result of a\r\nconference which was held on 7 November 1941 by the Reich Marshall and\r\nwhich concerned the\r\n\r\n  Employment of Soviet Russians\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Reich Marshall has ordered (cf. V of the note) that\r\nthe utilization of those Russians who are not under the armed forces\r\n(prisoners of war and free workers) should be centrally directed in the\r\nReich, including the protectorate and the General Government, as well\r\nas in the Reich Commissariats by his agency Arbeitseinsatz. To perform\r\nits functions, it will avail itself of the general administration\r\nof the Arbeitseinsatz, and in the occupied Eastern territories of\r\nthe organization for the Arbeitseinsatz which is at the disposal of\r\nthe Economic Staff East, respectively the Reich commissar, general\r\ncommissar, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall has made the agency Arbeitseinsatz responsible for a\r\nrapid and appropriate solution of all problems which are connected with\r\nthe utilization of the Russians in the civilian domain. He requests\r\nthat the responsible agencies should acknowledge the importance of\r\nthis matter by fullest cooperation and should help in eliminating the\r\nexisting difficulties to the best of their abilities.\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall expects to receive on 15 December 1941 the first\r\nreport of the agency Arbeitseinsatz as to what extent the directives\r\nissued by him on 7 November have been set into practice.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Koerner\r\n  Authenticated: Schwingle\r\n  Ministry Registrar\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Conference of 7 November 1941 about the\r\n  Employment of Soviet Russians\r\n\r\nThe Reich Marshall gave the following directives for the Arbeitseinsatz\r\nof the Soviet Russians:\r\n\r\nI. _The stronger labor reserves in the zone of the interior are also\r\ndecisive for the war._\r\n\r\nThe Russian workers have proved their productive capacity during the\r\ndevelopment of the huge Russian industry. Therefore it must be made\r\navailable to the Reich from now on. Objections against this order of\r\nthe Fuehrer are of the secondary nature. The disadvantages which can be\r\ncreated by the Arbeitseinsatz have to be reduced to a minimum: the task\r\nespecially of counter-intelligence and security police.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Russian in the zone of operations._\r\n\r\nHe is to be employed particularly in building roads and railroads,\r\nin clearing work, clearing of mines, and in building airports. The\r\nGerman construction battalions have to be dissolved to a great extent\r\n(Example: Air Forces!); the German skilled workers belong to the war\r\nindustry; it is not their task to shovel and to break stones, the\r\nRussian is there for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Russian in the territories of the Reich Commissar and of the\r\nGeneral Government._\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply as in II. Furthermore, stronger utilization\r\nin agriculture; if machines are lacking, human hands have to produce\r\nwhat the Reich has to request from the agricultural sector in the\r\nEast. Furthermore, sufficient native labor has to be provided for the\r\nruthless exploitation of Russian coal mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Russian in the Reich territory including the Protectorate._\r\n\r\nThe number of the employed depends on the requirement. By determining\r\nthe requirement, it is to be considered that workers of other states\r\nwho produce little and eat much are to be shipped out of the Reich\r\nand that in the future the German woman should come less into the\r\nforeground in the labor process. Beside the Russian prisoners of war,\r\nfree Russian workers should also be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _The Russian prisoner of war._\r\n\r\n1. The _selection_ has to take place already in the collecting camps,\r\nbeyond the Reich border. The profession and physical condition are\r\ndecisive. At the same time screening as to nationality and according to\r\nthe requirements of the security police and counter-intelligence must\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\n2. The _transportation_ has to be organized just as the selection\r\nand not improvised. The prisoners are to be forwarded rapidly. Their\r\nfeeding should be orderly and their guarding unconditionally secured.\r\n\r\n3. _Officers_ are to be excluded from the work as much as possible,\r\n_commissars_ as a matter of principle.\r\n\r\n4. The Russian belongs in first line to the following _work places_ (in\r\norder of priorities):\r\n\r\n Mining.\r\n\r\n Railroad maintenance (including repair shops and construction of\r\n vehicles).\r\n\r\n War industry (tanks, artillery pieces, airplane parts).\r\n\r\n Agriculture.\r\n\r\n Building industry.\r\n\r\n Large scale work shops (shoe shops!).\r\n\r\n Special units for urgent, occasional and emergency work.\r\n\r\n5. The following apply to the method of employment: Principally\r\nclosed group employment (at least 20). Exceptions only with express\r\npermission. In the agriculture in first place the great enterprises\r\ncome into consideration; besides rotating employment of closed units in\r\nsmall farms day after day. In industry including mining establishments\r\nof \"Russian enterprises\" as an ideal condition (exclusively Russian\r\nworkers under German supervision) to be striven for.\r\n\r\n6. _Housing_: In closed camps (barracks).\r\n\r\n7. _Guards_: During work, members of the armed forces, but also\r\nGerman workers who have to perform auxiliary police functions. The\r\nstrictest and fastest activity is decisive for security measures. In\r\ngeneral, there are no further steps in the scale of punishment between\r\nrestriction of food and execution according to martial law.\r\n\r\n8. _Clothing_: Creating of a standardized work suit is to the point.\r\nThe first clothing is secured according to the High Command of the\r\nArmed Forces. Wooden shoes are the rule. Underwear is scarcely known to\r\nor customary to the Russians.\r\n\r\n9. _Rations_: The Russian is easily satisfied. Therefore he should be\r\nfed lightly and without serious infractions upon our food balance. He\r\nshould not be spoiled or accustomed to the German food, but he should\r\nbe satisfied and kept in the productive capacity which corresponds to\r\nhis assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _The free Russian worker._\r\n\r\n_Employment and treatment_ will not be handled in practice differently\r\nthan for Russian prisoners of war. In both categories, particularly\r\ngood production can be acknowledged by a limited distribution of luxury\r\nitems. Sufficient, adequate nourishment is also the main thing for the\r\nfree workers.\r\n\r\nAs to the _working conditions_ of the free Russian, the following is to\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\n1. He can receive a _small allowance_.\r\n\r\n2. _His relatives should be provided for._\r\n\r\n3. Since his productive power is placed at the disposal of the employer\r\nat a cheap price, _a financial compensation with the employer_ is to be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n4. _Subjects of the Baltic State_ who are old residents can receive\r\nprivileges. At the most their cash allowance can be made equal to\r\nthe wages which are provided for the Poles who are in the Reich. The\r\ngeneral wage standard in the East has to be taken into consideration in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n5. _Ukrainians_ have no special privileges. The Fuehrer has ordered\r\nthat in the future they should not be released from war captivity.\r\n\r\n6. The Russian employment should under no conditions create a prejudice\r\nin the East as to the problem of salaries. Every financial measure\r\ntaken in this field has to originate from the consideration that the\r\nlowest wages in the East, according to a directive of the Fuehrer,\r\nare prerequisites for the settlement of the cost of war and for the\r\nclearing of the war debts of the Reich after the end of the war.\r\n\r\nInfractions will be punished with strictest measures.\r\n\r\nThis logically applies for every furthering of \"social aspirations\" in\r\nthe Russian colonial territory.\r\n\r\n7. The Russian free workers obtain a _badge_ which makes them\r\nrecognizable as such.\r\n\r\nV. The Reich Marshall reserves for himself a special decree about the\r\n_organization of the Russian Arbeitseinsatz_, number and obligatory\r\nmembership, obligatory registration. All recruiting and every shipment\r\nwhich are not conducted through the organization are prohibited.\r\nRecruiting and employment of prisoners of war are to be conducted in a\r\nunified way and are organizationally to be coupled with one another.\r\n\r\n  Signed: von Normann\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1195-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n  Supreme Command of the Armed Forces\r\n  W.F.St./Abt.L (IV/Qu) Nr. 00630/41 Top Secret.\r\n  Fuehrer's H.Q., 12.4.1941\r\n\r\n _Reference_: OKW/L (IV/Qu) Nr.4434/41 Top Secret of 3 April 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Kdos,\r\nis hereby dealt with).\r\n\r\n2. _The territory beyond the river Mur_ [_Ubermur-Gebiet_]:\r\n\r\nThe territory beyond the river Mur goes as a whole to Hungary\r\nconforming with the historic boundary. A later transfer of the German\r\npopulation in the north-eastern part of this territory has been\r\ntaken into consideration. The handing over of this territory to the\r\nHungarians will be regulated by the Army High Command.\r\n\r\n3. _Banat_:\r\n\r\nThe territory from the point where the river Orava cuts the Hungarian\r\nnational boundary to the entry of the river Tisa in the Danube goes to\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\nThe territory east of the river Tisa will be at first\r\nunder German protection as will the territory south of the\r\nDanube and east of the general line: mouth of the river\r\nMorava-Danube-Pozarevac-Petrovac-Boljavac-Kugarevac-Kalina. This\r\nterritory comprises the Boz copper territory and the adjoining coal\r\ndistrict in the south-east. The above line is to be considered as the\r\nbasis [Anhalt] and provisional demarcation line. At first Military\r\nGovernment under the Army High Command is to be established.\r\n\r\n4. _Southern Serbia_:\r\n\r\nThe territory inhabited by Bulgarian Macedonians, in conformity with\r\nthe ethnographical boundary goes to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nPreliminary delimitation from the military view point will be carried\r\nout by the Army High Command which will prepare the handing over to\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\n5. _Former Serbia_ [_Alt-Serbien_]:\r\n\r\nThe territory of former Serbia will be placed under German military\r\nadministration of the Army High Command.\r\n\r\n6. _Croatia_:\r\n\r\nCroatia becomes an independent state within its ethnographical\r\nboundaries. There will be no interference on the part of Germany with\r\nits home policy.\r\n\r\n7. _Remaining territories including Bosnia and Montenegro_:\r\n\r\nThe political shaping of these territories will be left to Italy. Here\r\nalso the restoration of an independent state of Montenegro can be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The drawing up of boundaries\r\n\r\n1. If the drawing up of boundaries has not been laid down in the above\r\npart I it will be carried out by the Supreme Command of the Armed\r\nForces in agreement with the Foreign Office, the plenipotentiary for\r\nthe Four Year Plan and the Reich-Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nThe Operational Staff of the Armed Forces (L IV/Qu) is the authority\r\nwhich will prepare the drawing up of the boundaries for the Supreme\r\nCommand of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n2. The Army High Command will forward as soon as possible to the\r\nSupreme Command of the Armed Forces W.F.

Col. Dr. Krull.\r\n\r\n Participants: (see enclosed record of attendance) Representatives of\r\n the Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, of the Reich Labor Ministry,\r\n of the Reich Food Ministry, of the Rosenberg Bureau, of the AWA/P.W.\r\n and of the WI Rue Amt, Arb. Amtsdir. Panse, Dr. Bergan and Reg. Rt.\r\n Dr. Kloeden.\r\n\r\nAfter an introduction by Lt. Col. Dr. Krull, Lt. Col. Breyer of\r\nthe P.W. department explained that actually there was in effect a\r\nprohibition by the Fuehrer against bringing Russian PWs into the\r\nReich for mobilization of labor; but that one might count on this\r\nprohibition being relaxed a little. For the time being the prisoners\r\nare to be retained in camps in the occupied territories and in the\r\nGovernment-general; as soon as conditions become overcrowded, they are\r\nto be transported to large camps in the Reich. In case Arbeitseinsatz\r\nshould be permitted in the Reich, certain racial groups would be\r\nexempted (White Russians, Ukrainians, Latvians, Esthonians, Finns,\r\netc.). PWs of Asiatic origin (such as Mongolians) are by no means\r\nto be transported to the Reich for Arbeitseinsatz. Moreover, only\r\nRussian-speaking prisoners will be utilized for the Arbeitseinsatz,\r\nbecause of the possibility of Bolshevist propaganda. Only\r\nArbeitseinsatz as units (Organization Todt, construction battalions),\r\nunder guard will be permitted.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the various departments (including the\r\nrepresentatives of the Commissioner for the Four Year Plan and of the\r\nReich Labor Ministry) unanimously agreed that Labor Mobilization of the\r\nRussians was unqualifiedly necessary. Approximately 500,000 prisoners\r\nare needed (also to make up for the 50,000-100,000 French who are to\r\nbe released)--400,000 in agriculture, 80,000 in construction, 10,000\r\nin mining (especially lignite). The need for an additional 70,000\r\nprisoners in the munitions industry cannot be filled under existing\r\nstipulations and at most may be accomplished only by exchange. These\r\nfigures, which were presented by the representative of the Reich\r\nLabor ministry, were mentioned only from the viewpoint of a possible\r\nslight increase in number of PWs. It must be taken into consideration,\r\nmoreover, that 25% are absorbed by losses and by the camps themselves.\r\n\r\nThe chairman summarized the results of the discussion as indicating\r\nthat all the interested bureaus unqualifiedly advocated and supported\r\nthe demand for utilization of PWs because of manpower needs\r\n[Arbeitseinsatz] in the Reich. The Wi Rue Amt will approach the\r\nCommissioner for the Four Year Plan with a request for relaxation of\r\nthe restrictive regulations and express to the WFS/I its point of view,\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n  [signature illegible]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1206-PS\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n\r\n  Draft\r\n  Rue (IV)      Berlin, November 11 1941\r\n  _6 Copies_, 6th Copy\r\n  NOTES\r\n\r\n on outlines layed down by the Reichsmarschall in the meeting of 7\r\n November 1941 in the Reich Ministry for Air (RLM)\r\n\r\n  SUBJECT: Employment of laborers in war industries.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer's point of view as to employment of prisoners of war in war\r\nindustries has changed basically. So far a total of 5 million prisoners\r\nof war--employed so far 2 million.\r\n\r\nDirectives for employment:\r\n\r\n Frenchmen: Individual employment, transposition into armament industry\r\n [Rue-wirtschaft]\r\n\r\n Serbs: Preferably agriculture\r\n\r\n Poles: If feasible no individual employment achievement of Russian\r\n armament industry surpasses the German one. Assembly line-work, a\r\n great many mechanical devices with relatively few skilled workers.\r\n\r\nReadiness of Russians in the operational area to work is strong. In the\r\nUkraine and other areas discharged prisoners of war already work as\r\nfree labor. In Krivoy Rog, large numbers of workers are available due\r\nto the destruction of the factories.\r\n\r\n  EMPLOYMENT OF RUSSIAN PWs\r\n\r\nAs a rule, employment in groups [geschlossener Arbeitseinsatz] no\r\nindividual employment, not even in agriculture. Guard personnel, not\r\nonly soldiers but also foremen, at least during the working time\r\nproper. As a rule soldiers in the camp.\r\n\r\n_Employment in_:\r\n\r\n 1. Operational area\r\n\r\n 2. Reich Commissariats (occupied territories in the east)\r\n\r\n 3. General Government\r\n\r\n 4. Interior and Protectorate is to be differentiated.\r\n\r\nFor 1: In the _operational area_ take preferable into consideration:\r\n\r\n a. Railroads.\r\n\r\n b. Highway construction.\r\n\r\n Very important that in the Ukraine some roads be built with increased\r\n speed, not by German skilled labor but by Russian PWs.\r\n\r\nc. Clearing work.\r\n\r\nd. Agriculture.\r\n\r\n The Ukraine being conquered, we now finally have to secure the feeding\r\n of the German people. If feasible, also Frenchmen and Belgians are to\r\n be used for directing the Russian farm-workers in the eastern area. If\r\n farm machinery is lacking, employ masses of workers. Transplantation\r\n of German farmers only where actual success can be expected.\r\n\r\ne. Railroad-repair-factories, etc.\r\n\r\nBest supervision: \"Field kitchen.\" Quick evacuation from operational\r\narea are necessary. Losses during transport very heavy (escaping and\r\njoining with partisan and robber bands).\r\n\r\nBarbed wire hard to get. (Discarding of barbed wire fences in East\r\nPrussia desirable.)\r\n\r\nLeave Asiatic people in operational area if possible.\r\n\r\nFrom construction battalions 69,000 workers have been transferred to\r\nthe armament industry: replacement by prisoner of war battalions.\r\n\r\nAgain and again skilled workers are being found in the construction\r\nbattalions (fraisiers etc). Investigation by army desirable. Express\r\nwill of the Fuehrer, that every skilled worker is used in the proper\r\nplace. If necessary, repeated checking should be instituted.\r\n\r\nFor 2: The same applies to employment in _Reich Commissariats_.\r\n\r\nFor 3: The above is also applicable to the _Government General_.\r\n\r\nAttention is to be paid to avoiding of unnecessary transport of\r\nmachinery, as thereby often the available manpower in the Gouvernement\r\nis not fully utilized, and, on the other hand, the machinery cannot be\r\nmade use of for a long time in other places.\r\n\r\nFor 4: In the _Interior and the Protectorate_. It would be ideal if\r\nentire factories could be manned by Russian PWs except the employees\r\nnecessary for direction. For employment in the Interior and the\r\nProtectorate the following are to have priority:\r\n\r\n a. At the top _coal mining industry_.\r\n\r\n Order by the Fuehrer to investigate all mines as to suitability for\r\n employment of Russians. At times manning the entire plant with Russian\r\n laborers.\r\n\r\nb. _Transportation_ (construction of locomotives and cars, repair-shops)\r\n\r\n Railroad-repair and industry workers are to be sought out from the\r\n PWs. Railroad is most important means of transportation in the East.\r\n\r\nc. _Armament industries._\r\n\r\n Preferably factories of armor and guns. Possibly also construction of\r\n parts for airplane engines. Suitable complete sections of factories\r\n to be manned exclusively by Russians. For the remainder employment\r\n in columns. Use in factories of tool machinery, production of farm\r\n tractors, generators, etc.\r\n\r\n In emergency, erect in individual places barracks for occasional\r\n workers which are used as unloading details and similar purposes.\r\n (Reich Minister of the Interior through communal authorities).\r\n\r\nOKW/AWA is competent for _transporting_ Russian PWs, employment through\r\n\"_Planning Board for Employment of all PWs_.\" If necessary, offices of\r\nReich Commissariats.\r\n\r\nNo employment where _danger to men_ or their supply exists, i.e.\r\nfactories exposed to explosives, waterworks, powerworks, etc. No\r\ncontact with German population, especially no \"solidarity.\" German\r\nworker as a rule is foreman of Russians.\r\n\r\n_Food_ is a matter of Four Years' Plan. Supply their own food (cats,\r\nhorses, etc.)\r\n\r\n_Clothes_, _billeting_, _messing_ somewhat better than at home where\r\npart of the people live in caverns.\r\n\r\n_Supply of shoes_ for Russians as a rule wooden shoes, if necessary\r\nRussian shoe repair shops.\r\n\r\nExamination of _physical fitness_, in order to avoid importation of\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n_Clearing of mines_ as a rule by Russians if possible by selected\r\nRussian engineers.\r\n\r\nEmployment offices for _civilian workers_ to be kept separate from\r\nthose for PWs. In this respect the wage-problem is to be considered.\r\nFurthermore families in Russia have to share the support. As a rule\r\nemployment in closed groups [geschlossener Einsatz].\r\n\r\n_Some points as to general Arbeitseinsatz_\r\n\r\nRather employ PWs than _unsuitable foreign workers_. Seize Poles,\r\nDutchmen, etc., if necessary as PWs and employ them as such, if work\r\nthrough free contract cannot be obtained. Strong action.\r\n\r\nGeneral employment of all _German women_ repudiated by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nWhere Russians can be employed, _labor service_ is not to be used.\r\nLabor service to be used where greatest effect is produced, even if the\r\nprinciple of education through labor service is curtailed thereby. War\r\nsituation to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n_As a matter of principle central interests precede local interests_,\r\ntherefore no resistance from Reich commissaries and other local\r\nauthorities against Arbeitseinsatz in the homeland.\r\n\r\n_Savings in wages_ are to be made up by compensatory contributions of\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\n_Express order by the Fuehrer._ Under no circumstances may the _wage\r\nlevel in the East_ be raised or assimulated to the wages in western\r\nGermany. Strong action is imperative against solicitors who offer high\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to issue a basically new regulation of _wages for\r\nforeign workers_.\r\n\r\n_Foreigners not to be treated like German workers_, on the other hand\r\ndo not provoke inferiority complex in foreigners by posters.\r\n\r\nThe _welfare installations_ of the Labor Front [DAF] are _under no\r\ncircumstance_ to be used for PWs or Eastern workers.\r\n\r\nAll agencies are to promote maximum _utilization of Russian manpower_.\r\n\r\nEmployment of Russians not to be improvised, but first to be thoroughly\r\norganized in the operational area. _Speed_ is necessary, as the mass of\r\nmanpower is decreasing daily by losses (lack of food and billets).\r\n\r\nMake provisions to decrease the excessive number of _escaping\r\nprisoners_. Especially in and around Berlin strictest guard necessary.\r\n\r\n  [illegible initials]\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  Chief Rue--1st Copy\r\n  Sect.

The essential contents of his oral report on the single\r\ncases is incorporated in the memorandum of 30 May 1933 drafted by\r\nthe prosecuting authority [Staatsanwaltschaft] of the district Court\r\n[Landgericht] Munich II, which is referred to.\r\n\r\nThe same day, on 29 May 1933, I reported on this subject to the State\r\nMinister of Justice in the presence of Amtsgerichtsdirektor Sprick. The\r\nMinister of Justice called the Prime Minister by telephone and obtained\r\nhis consent that the subject \"Execution of protective custody\" should\r\nbe made an item on the agenda of the meeting of ministers on 31 May\r\n1933; he commissioned me to submit the matter to the State Minister of\r\nthe Interior together with Amtsgerichtsdirektor Sprick and to take all\r\nfurther steps which might become necessary.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on 30 May 1933 a.m., accompanied by AGDirektor Sprick,\r\nI made my report first to Ministerialdirektor Gareis, secretary for\r\npolice matters [Polizeireferent] in the Ministry of the Interior and\r\nthen in the presence of the latter to the State Minister Wagner himself\r\nstating the facts as they had been reported to me by Dr. Wintersberger,\r\nthe chief prosecutor [OStA]. I restated the official findings in the\r\ncases of Schloss, Hausmann, Strauss and Nefzger, pointed out that in\r\naccordance with Article 346 of the Penal Code (StGB) it is mandatory to\r\nmake an inquiry which, by the way, would also serve the true interests\r\nof the state; discussed the legal aspects of the camp regulations\r\n[Lagerordnung] and duly communicated that the Prime Minister, on\r\nrequest by the Minister of Justice, had put the subject on the agenda\r\nof the meeting of ministers of 31 May 1933.\r\n\r\nState Minister Wagner declared that the pacts are not yet cleared\r\nsufficiently to allow the matter to become a subject of discussion\r\nin the meeting of ministers, and that the commandant of the Bavarian\r\npolitical police who was sick at the time, should be heard first as\r\nwell as the camp commandant.\r\n\r\nHe asked the Prime Minister by telephone to delete this item from\r\nthe agenda and gave orders to Ministerialdirektor Gareis to open a\r\ndiscussion of the matter without delay. From the sphere of the Ministry\r\nof the Interior the following are to participate in the discussion:\r\nMinisterialdirektor Gareis, the commandant of the political police,\r\nHimmler, as well as the camp commandant and the camp physician of\r\nthe concentration camp Dachau; from the sphere of the State Minister\r\nof Justice: Amtsgerichtdirektor Sprick, Chief Prosecutor [OStA],\r\nDr. Wintersberger, Dr. Flamm, physician of the District Court\r\n(Landgerichtsarzt) and the undersigned reporter in this matter.\r\n\r\nI have reported the result of my audience with the State Minister\r\nWagner to Ministerialdirektor Degen and Staatsrat Spangenberger on 30\r\nMay 1933 and in the presence of the latter to the State Minister of\r\nJustice on 31 May 1933. I was requested to emphasize at the proposed\r\nmeeting that Article 346 of the Penal Code (StGB) makes an inquiry by\r\nprosecution and police mandatory.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of 31 May 1933 I was told by Min. Dir. Gareis over the\r\ntelephone that in accordance with orders from State Minister Wagner the\r\nproposed discussion would not take place, because he wished to avoid\r\nany sign of intervention in a pending matter, that the chief prosecutor\r\n[OStA] of the District Court [LG] Munich II should contact Himmler,\r\nthe commandant of the political police, as had been suggested in the\r\ncase of Schloss by letter of the Ministry of Justice of 29 May 1933 No.\r\nII 28923, and that the State Ministry of the Interior would take the\r\nnecessary steps as far as its own sphere was concerned in this matter.\r\n\r\nA.G.Dir. Sprick was asked to make this known to the Minister of Justice\r\nwho was just participating in a meeting of ministers [interlineary note\r\nin ink:--on 31 May--] (OStA) Dr. Wintersberger was orally requested\r\nto contact Himmler, commandant of the political police, as soon as\r\npossible, and to report on the result.\r\n\r\n  Munich, 1 June 1933\r\n  (s) DOEBIG\r\n\r\n  2 June 1933 (Friday)\r\n\r\n At 5:15 parley on the matter with Reichsstatthalter von Epp.\r\n\r\n The papers on Schloss, Hausmann, Strauss and Nefzger were available at\r\n this parley on informal request.\r\n\r\n Result of the parley:\r\n\r\n The files of the prosecution Munich II on these 4 cases are submitted\r\n to the State Minister of the Interior in order to get his view first.\r\n In the camp Dachau a change of personnel shall take place.\r\n\r\n  DOEBIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1229-PS\r\n\r\n  TOP SECRET\r\n  [Stamped]      [illegible pencil mark]\r\n  Supreme command of the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n Armed forces Fuehrer Staff (WFST) /department L number 33 264/4C top\r\n secret, for general officers only.\r\n\r\n  [stamped]\r\n  Fuehrer headquarters, September 6, 1940.\r\n  73 [in pencil] [illegible pencil mark]\r\n  _7 copies_\r\n  _4th_ copy\r\n  [in pencil]\r\n\r\n SUBJECT: Material for the intelligence service\r\n\r\n SUBJECT: _Counter intelligence (Abw.)

By\r\nthe end of October the Status shown on the enclosed map is supposed to\r\nbe reached.\r\n\r\nThese regroupings must not create the impression in Russia that we are\r\npreparing an offensive in the East. On the other hand, Russia will\r\nrealise that strong and highly trained German troops are stationed in\r\nthe Gouvernement, in the Eastern provinces, and in the Protektorat;\r\nshe should draw the conclusion that we can at any time protect our\r\ninterests--espec. on the Balkan--with strong forces against Russian\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\nFor the work of our own intelligence service as well as for the answer\r\nto questions of the Russian intelligence service, the following\r\ndirectives apply:\r\n\r\n1. The respective total strength of the German troops in the East is to\r\nbe veiled as far as possible by giving news about a frequent change of\r\nthe army units there. This change is to be explained by movements into\r\ntraining camps, regroupings.\r\n\r\n2. The impression is to be created that the center of the massing of\r\ntroops is in the Southern part of the Gouvernement, in the Protektorat\r\nand in Austria, and that the massing in the North is relatively\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\n3. When it comes to the equipment situation of the units, espec. of the\r\narmored divisions, things are to be exaggerated, if necessary.\r\n\r\n4. By suitable news the impression is to be created that the\r\n_anti-aircraft protection_ in the East has been increased considerably\r\nafter the end of the campaign in the West and that it continues to be\r\nincreased with captured French material on all important targets.\r\n\r\n5. Concerning improvements on _railroads_, _roads_, _airdromes_ _etc._\r\nit is to be stated that the work is kept within normal limits, is\r\nneeded for the improvement of the newly won Eastern territories, and\r\nserves primarily economical traffic.\r\n\r\nThe supreme command of the Army [OKH] decides to what extent correct\r\ndetails, i.e., numbers of regiments, manning of garrisons etc. will be\r\nmade available to the defense for purposes of counter espionage.\r\n\r\n  The chief of the supreme command\r\n  of the armed forces\r\n  by order of\r\n  Signed: JODL\r\n  A certified copy\r\n  F.M.

According to the latest\r\ninformation these are now in France, so that subsequent seizure will be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nScientific treatment of the objects of art took place simultaneously\r\nwith the salvage activities. The result is shown in the catalog with\r\npictorial supplement, which clearly proves the penetration of the East\r\nby the German will for culture.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to speak of an independent Polish development of\r\nart in the historic epochs of style. There are creations of German\r\nimpressions and Dutch or Flemish works which according to their spirit\r\nand character, equally do not express anything but German spirit and\r\nGerman culture. French and Italian works are in the minority.\r\n\r\nThe state of preservation of the secured objects of art was generally\r\npoor. The Poles' hasty salvage efforts prior to the out-break of\r\nhostilities and neglect over a considerable time have caused damage of\r\nall sorts which required immediate remedy. For this reason, our own\r\nshops for restoring purposes, were established in Cracow and Warsaw, so\r\nthat these works of art could receive care corresponding to their value.\r\n\r\nThe catalog contains a qualitative selection corresponding to the\r\nstandards of leading German museums. German art and everything having a\r\nrank within the entire European development of art was given preference.\r\n\r\nArt objects excluded by this qualitative selection were also\r\nscientifically treated, catalogued, and protected against loss or\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1249-PS\r\n\r\n  Copy\r\n  1 June 1942\r\n  The Chief President of the Province of Upper Silesia.\r\n  1.

Severe violations of Poles and Jews against Germans, as well as\r\nother criminal acts by Poles and Jews which seriously endanger the\r\nGerman reconstruction work, can be sentenced by courts-martial, until\r\nfurther notice.\r\n\r\nI reserve for myself the decision as to whether or not the criminal act\r\nis a crime in the sense of paragraph 1.\r\n\r\n  Par. 2.\r\n\r\nThe courts-martial pass sentence of death, transfer to the secret state\r\npolice acquittal.\r\n\r\n  Par. 3.\r\n\r\n1.

Fuehrer's order of 18.10.1942\r\n\r\n Reference: Communication of Counter Intelligence Bureau Defense\r\n Section III 527/2. 44g (C 2) of 21.3.1944.\r\n\r\nThe C-in-C of the Security Police and the SD in Paris reports the\r\narrest of isolated parachutists of _French nationality_ in English\r\nuniform near Plumelec/Morbihan. It is evident from interrogation that\r\n_members of the De Gaulle Army_, after reporting voluntarily to the\r\n\"Service Air Special,\" were taking part in a 14-days special training\r\ncamp, in which were 300 Frenchmen and 300 Englishmen. Apparently only\r\nFrenchmen are used for operations in France. The parachute-jump is made\r\nin groups of ten, each consisting of:\r\n\r\n  1 Lieutenant\r\n  2 wireless operators\r\n  7 sabotage experts.\r\n  Armament: each man\r\n  1 sub-machine gun\r\n  1 pistol\r\n  1 carbine\r\n  1 stabbing weapon.\r\n  Equipment: Sabotage and radio apparatus,\r\n  including Eureka gear i.e.\r\n  D/F beacons.\r\n  (therefore arrested by the SD? [marginal note in pencil])\r\n\r\nThe group which was arrested had orders to carry out railway sabotage\r\nin the district around Rennes. The acts of sabotage were obviously to\r\nbe carried out by the group as a body. In addition, the group was to\r\nawait further orders in some hiding-place.\r\n\r\nApparently they were not ordered to link up with the local resistance\r\norganisations. The arrested men had no civilian identity cards on them.\r\n\r\nThe employment of such groups is for the most part obviously planned\r\nfor regions where, due to the action of the Security Police, there\r\nare no more local resistance or sabotage organisations in existence,\r\nor where the enemy knows that sabotage organisations were only\r\ncounterfeited by tricks of the security police, which had meanwhile\r\nbeen disclosed.\r\n\r\n* * * _I consider it essential that the necessary orders should also be\r\ngiven from there, in order that the lesser units_ of the Armed Forces\r\nmay not--as has often been the case recently--interpret them wrongly\r\nand turn the Commando troops over to the Security Police instead of\r\nslaughtering them in combat as they retreat. It is only a question of\r\nhanding them over to the Security Police when members of Commandos of\r\nthis kind are not captured in battle by the Armed Forces but by other\r\nmeans, e.g., by being handed over by the native police.\r\n\r\nIf a few isolated Commando troops _are spared at first for\r\ninterrogation purposes_, I consider it necessary for the _Security\r\nPolice authorities to take part in_ the interrogation. The further\r\ntreatment of members of Commandos, who are finally to be treated as\r\nkilled in action [Gefallene], is, however, even in these cases, the\r\nresponsibility of the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nI request that the measures taken from there be reported to me.\r\n\r\nBy Order\r\n\r\n  Signed: Mueller\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1279-PS\r\n\r\n  MOST SECRET\r\n\r\n  _WFSt/Qu (Admin. 1)_\r\n  No. 007893/44 Most Secret\r\n  [The number is changed, in pencil, to 009074/44]\r\n  One copy has been destroyed\r\n  [remainder of pencil note illegible] 27/7\r\n  22.7.1944\r\n  2 Copies\r\n  2nd Copy\r\n\r\n _Subject_: Treatment of members of foreign \"military missions\"\r\n captured with partisan groups.\r\n\r\n  Minutes of a meeting\r\n\r\n1.

Such a decision\r\nseems to be indicated even if it does not correspond completely to\r\nthe wording of the Commando-Order or to the previous definition of\r\na commando operation (as an especially under-hand and still unusual\r\nform of warfare which must be combatted with the appropriate counter\r\nmeasures). The principle must be adopted from the start that all\r\nmembers of partisan groups, even in the South-East are fundamentally\r\nguerrillas. Indeed they are treated as prisoners of war for reasons of\r\nexpediency, in order to obtain the largest possible number of deserters\r\nand workers. There is no reason for this with regard to the members of\r\nforeign missions who are not numerous.

Provisionally the Reichsfuehrer SS\r\nand Chief of the German Police in the Reichs Ministry of the Interior\r\nhas taken over leadership personally. He unites in his person the\r\ndirection of the security police and of the \"Security Service of the\r\nReichsfuehrer SS\".\r\n\r\nThe security police is composed of the secret state police (including\r\nfrontier police) and criminal police which in the central instance\r\ntogether with the central offices of the security service are united in\r\nthe Chief Office for Reichs Security [RSHA].\r\n\r\nThereby the governmental security police and the party's SS\r\nintelligence activity complement each other in the unified central\r\nagency both organizationally and in leadership.\r\n\r\nWith the Chief Office for Reichs Security rest the elaboration of all\r\norganizational, personnel, economic, and technical affairs of the\r\nsecurity police and security service; besides this however, the central\r\nagencies of the state police and criminal executives and the central\r\ndirection of the security service information nets are also included.\r\n\r\nIn the field of functional legislation the Chief Office for Reichs\r\nSecurity, insofar as its interests are touched upon, either controls\r\nthe framing of the law or has a part therein.\r\n\r\nThe chief office for Reich security is composed at present of 7\r\noffices, to these several special institutes are attached.\r\n\r\nThe following serve to train the members of the security police and the\r\nsecurity service:\r\n\r\n1.

A conference took place with the Fuehrer to-day which was attended\r\nby:\r\n\r\n The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor, Gauleiter Sauckel,\r\n\r\n The Secretary for Armament and War Production, Speer,\r\n\r\n The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Army, General Field Marshal\r\n Keitel,\r\n\r\n General Field Marshal Milch,\r\n\r\n The Acting Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture, State Secretary\r\n Backe,\r\n\r\n The Minister of the Interior, Reich Fuehrer of the SS, Himmler,\r\n\r\n and myself.\r\n\r\n (The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Economy\r\n had repeatedly asked to be permitted to participate prior to the\r\n Conference, but the Fuehrer did not wish their attendance).\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer declared in his introductory remarks:\r\n\r\nI want a clear picture:\r\n\r\n(1) How many workers are required for the maintenance of German War\r\nEconomy?\r\n\r\n(a) For the maintenance of present output?\r\n\r\n(b) To increase its output?\r\n\r\n(2) How many workers can be obtained from Occupied Countries, or how\r\nmany can still be gained in the Reich by suitable means (increased\r\noutput)?\r\n\r\nFor one thing, it is this matter of making up for losses by death,\r\ninfirmity, the constant fluctuation of workers, and so forth, and\r\nfurther it is a matter of procuring additional workers.\r\n\r\nThe Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor, Sauckel, declared\r\nthat, in order to maintain the present pool of workers, he would have\r\nto add at least 2-1/2 but probably 3 million new workers in 1944.\r\nOtherwise production would fall off. Reichminister _Speer_ declared\r\nthat he needs an _additional_ 1.3 million laborers. However, this\r\nwould depend on whether it will be possible to increase production of\r\niron ore. Should this not be possible, he would need no additional\r\nworkers. Procurement of additional workers from Occupied Territory\r\nwould, however, be subject to the condition that these workers will\r\nnot be withdrawn from armament and auxiliary industries already\r\nworking there. For this would mean a decrease of production of\r\nthese industries which he could not tolerate. Those, for instance,\r\nwho are already working in France in industries mentioned above,\r\nmust be protected against being sent to work in Germany by the\r\nPlenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor. The Fuehrer agreed with\r\nthe opinions of Reichminister Speer and emphasized that the measures\r\ntaken by the Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor should order\r\nno circumstances which would lead to the withdrawal of workers from\r\nArmament and auxiliary industries working in occupied territories,\r\nbecause such a shift of workers would only cause disturbance of\r\nproduction in occupied countries.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer further called attention to the fact that at least 250,000\r\nlaborers will be required for preparations against air attacks in the\r\nfield of civilian air raid protection. For Vienna alone 2000-2500 are\r\nrequired immediately. The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor\r\nmust add at least 4 million workers to the manpower pool, considering\r\nthat he requires 2-1/2 million workers for maintenance of the present\r\nlevel, that Reich Minister Speer needs 1.3 million additional workers,\r\nand that the above-mentioned preparations for security measures against\r\nair attacks call for 0.25 million laborers.\r\n\r\nThe Plenipotentiary for Employment of Labor, Sauckel, declared that\r\nhe will attempt with fanatical determination to obtain these workers.\r\nUntil now, he has always kept his promise as to the number of workers\r\nto be furnished. With the best of intentions, however, he is unable to\r\nmake a definite promise for 1944. He will do everything in his powers\r\nto furnish the requested manpower in 1944. Whether it will succeed\r\ndepends primarily on what _German_ enforcement agents will be made\r\navailable. His project cannot be carried out with domestic enforcement\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nThe Reichfuehrer SS explained that the enforcement agents put at his\r\ndisposal are extremely few, but that he would try helping the Sauckel\r\nproject to succeed by increasing them and working them harder. The\r\nReichfuehrer SS made immediately available 2000 to 2500 men from\r\nconcentration camps for air raid preparations in Vienna.\r\n\r\nGenerally all participants in the conference agreed that it will be\r\npossible to treat additional manpower even at home by activation and\r\nintensification of available labor, especially the Prisoners of War,\r\nprovided they are given awards in form of additional food, clothing,\r\nand so forth. State Secretary Backe will examine to which extent help\r\ncan be given with additional food. Field Marshal _Milch_ remarked that\r\nespecially in agriculture, many women, who are really able to work,\r\nevade it because they receive family-allotments from their husbands\r\nwho were inducted into the Armed Forces, and the wages for work done\r\nwould be deducted from their family allotment. In their primitive way\r\nof thinking they therefore believe that they would have to work for\r\nnothing. Therefore on one hand, wages should not be deducted from the\r\nfamily allotment; on the other hand, it should be ruled that women who\r\nrefuse work would, in consequence, receive no family allotment, or only\r\na reduced family allotment.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer did not comment, declaring that he did not wish to go into\r\ndetails any longer.\r\n\r\n  Results of the Conference:\r\n\r\n(1) The Plenipotentiary for Employment of Labor shall procure at least\r\n4 million new workers from occupied territories.\r\n\r\n(2) These workers may not be taken from armament and auxiliary\r\nindustries in actual production in the occupied territories.\r\n\r\n(3) It is to be examined by what means the output of workers now on\r\nhand can be increased and intensified, especially that of Prisoners of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n(4) The Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor shall get in touch\r\nwith the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs before taking any action.\r\n\r\n  Signed: Dr. Lammers\r\n\r\nII.

(Arrival at Fuehrer Headquarters,\r\n6 January 1944.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1301-PS\r\n\r\n  Financing of the armament\r\n\r\nThe following explanations take as their premise the fact that the\r\nexecution of the armament program is by its speed and extent _the_\r\nmission of German policy, that everything else therefore must be\r\nsubordinated to this purpose, unless the neglect of other questions\r\nwould endanger the main goal. Even after 16 March 1935, the difficulty\r\ncontinues to exist, that one cannot attempt the influencing of the\r\nGerman people by propaganda for support of the armament, without\r\nendangering internationally our position. The financing of the armament\r\nprogram, already almost impossible, is being made especially difficult\r\nby that.\r\n\r\nFurther, another prerequisite must be presented. The printing press\r\ncan only be used for the financing of armament to the extent which the\r\nmaintenance of money value allows. Each inflation increases the prices\r\nof foreign raw materials, and increases the prices within the country;\r\nthus it is a snake, which bites its tail. The fact that our armament\r\nhad to be camouflaged completely until 16 March 1935, and for the\r\nbiggest part even afterwards, has led to that, that the printing press\r\nhas already been made use of at the start of the armament program;\r\nwhereas it would have been natural to put it at the final point of the\r\nfinancing. Of the 3775 millions in the portfolio of the Reichsbank plus\r\n866 millions set aside in bills of exchange==total of 4641 millions,\r\nthe bills of exchange to finance armament represent 2374 millions\r\n(status of 30 April 1935). The Reichsbank has invested most of the\r\nGerman mark sums, available to its administration and belonging to\r\nforeigners, in armament bills of exchange. Thus our armament was partly\r\nfinanced with the property of our political opponents. Also used for\r\nthe financing of the armament program were the 500 millions RM, which\r\ncame together through the Reich loan placed at the savings banks in Jan\r\n1935. In the regular budget the following amounts were provided for the\r\narmed forces: fiscal year 1933/34 RM 750 millions, fiscal year 1934/35\r\nRM 1100 millions, fiscal year 1935/36 RM 2500 millions.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the deficits of the budgets increase since 1928, according\r\nto the estimate 1935/36, up to 5 to 6 billions RM. At present this\r\ntotal deficit is already being financed by short-term credits from the\r\nmoney market. Thus it already burdens in this amount the possibilities\r\nof use of the public market for armament. The Reich Minister of Finance\r\nis justified in saying in his budget explanations: \"Since an annual\r\ndeficit ... is an impossibility permanently, since one cannot count\r\nwith certainty on an increased tax income, covering the deficit and\r\nother previous debts; since on the other hand only a balanced budget\r\noffers a secure basis for our great future task in the armament policy,\r\nfundamentally and consciously--a budget policy must be followed, which\r\nwill solve the problem of financing of armament by organic and planned\r\ndecrease of other expenses, not only from the point of view of income,\r\nbut also of expenses, that means saving.\"\r\n\r\nHow urgent this demand is can further be construed from the fact that\r\nan unending number of tasks were attacked and are in the process\r\nof execution by state and party, all of which cannot be covered by\r\nthe budget but by subscriptions and credits, which must be raised\r\nbesides the regular taxes by business. This simultaneous existence\r\nof various budgets, which however all serve a more or less public\r\npurpose, present the greatest obstacle to the gaining of a clear\r\npicture of the financing possibilities of armament. A whole series of\r\nministries and numerous agencies of the party have their own budget\r\nin addition to their share of the Reich budget, and thus accordingly\r\nincome and expense possibilities, which, although they are based on\r\nthe financial sovereignty of the state, are not subordinated to the\r\ncontrol of the Minister of Finance and thus also not to the control of\r\nthe cabinet. Exactly as in the field of politics, the too far reaching\r\ndelegation of legislative authority to individuals in Germany has led\r\nto the condition of many states within the state, thus the condition\r\nof parallelism and divergence [Nebeneinander und Gegeneinander]\r\nof numerous state and party agencies has absolutely a disastrous\r\neffect on the financing possibility of armament. If in this field,\r\nno concentration and no unified control is introduced finally, one\r\nmust fear the worst for the solution of the almost impossible task of\r\nfinancing of armament.\r\n\r\nThus the following tasks result:\r\n\r\n1. A commissioner must at first determine all sources and incomes,\r\nwhich are derived from Reich, State and Party funds, as well as from\r\nprofits of public or party enterprises.\r\n\r\n2. Then, a commission, appointed by the Fuehrer must investigate how\r\nthese funds were used up to now, and how much can be taken from these\r\nfunds in the future from their present purpose, and made available to\r\nthe financing of armament.\r\n\r\n3. The same commission has to examine the assets of all public and\r\nofficial party organizations, how the assets have been invested, and to\r\nwhat extent these assets can be utilized for the financing of armament.\r\n\r\n4. The Reichministry of Finance is to be commissioned to investigate\r\nthe possibilities of an increased tax income by the introduction of new\r\ntaxes or the increase of existing tax rates.\r\n\r\nThe financing of armament previously by the Reich Bank was a necessity\r\nunder the existing political conditions, and the political success\r\nhas proved the correctness of this action. However, now other methods\r\nof financing of armament must be attempted under all conditions. With\r\nthat, all not absolutely necessary expenses in other fields must\r\nbe refrained from, and the entire, actually small, financial power\r\nof Germany must be concentrated on this one goal, the financing of\r\narmament. Whether the financial problem will succeed with this method\r\nof approach is as yet doubtful, but without such concentration it will\r\nfail with certainty.\r\n\r\nMemorandum 9.III.1936 on the supply situation in the field of fuels and\r\nits effect on the Wehrmacht.\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous throttling and blocking of foreign sources of liquid\r\nfuel has caused an increasingly critical situation of supply of the\r\nGerman market since the beginning of the year 1936.\r\n\r\nThis situation calls for a description of the serious effects on the\r\npreparedness for action of the Wehrmacht and of the extraordinary\r\nmeasures which necessitate a decision in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe supply of the Wehrmacht is based on the home production, the\r\nreserves which can be made available in case of mobilization and the\r\nforeign imports which still for some time must fill the present gaps of\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The German production._\r\n\r\nThe anticipating measures taken during the last 2 years by the Reich\r\nCabinet to increase the home production of fuel, will not bring about\r\nan essential improvement of the supply situation during the current\r\nyear because of the time required for factory construction and the\r\nuninterrupted increase of demand, but cannot bring an appreciable\r\nrelief until the year 1938. The list in enclosure 1 of the requirements\r\nin case of mobilization and of the supply of these requirements by\r\nproduction, as well as the graphs added to the other enclosures, show\r\nthe influence to be expected from the German production on the entire\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe expanding German production favors mainly light fuels, especially\r\nfuel for airplanes, and in addition, oil for airplane engines. As to\r\nthe other kinds required by the Wehrmacht in case of war, we cannot\r\nexpect any improvement for the time being; as to heating oils it may be\r\nanticipated that the situation will deteriorate. The developments of\r\nnew processes (Uhde and Pott), the extent of which will shortly permit\r\nan opinion, offers certain possibilities of auxiliary supply which do\r\nnot appear on the graphs, because the extent of the production possible\r\nuntil 1938 cannot yet be foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the supply on the basis of home production is a fact\r\nwhich cannot be eliminated during the next 2-3 years, even with the\r\ngreatest efforts and in spite of the planning started for additional\r\nexpansion of production.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Reserves._\r\n\r\nTo assure the requirements of the Wehrmacht it becomes necessary\r\nto bridge the supply gaps by reserves. For the first period of\r\nmobilization the Wehrmacht relies on the reserves of business,\r\nespecially of great importing corporations, which also in peace time\r\nconsider stored reserves for about 3 months as indispensable for smooth\r\ndistribution. The Wehrmacht ought to be enabled to count on the amount\r\nof these reserves remaining constant.\r\n\r\nBeyond that the Wehrmacht accumulates its own reserves in large storage\r\nhouses so that considerable national reserves will be available as\r\nbuffers in case of supply difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Dependency of the overall supply on imports._\r\n\r\nThe obstacle to importing encountered to a large extent during the\r\nlast weeks, and which have been brought about by an accumulation of\r\neconomic-political events in foreign trade, endanger not only the\r\nmaintenance of industrial reserves but also the continuation of the\r\nstorage policy of the Wehrmacht. They shake the very foundations of the\r\nmotorization program of industry and consequently also of Wehrmacht\r\nmobilization of mechanized vehicles to the extent planned for in case\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nIn particular large gaps have been opened:\r\n\r\n1. due to the Russian prohibition of exporting petroleum, by which the\r\nbenzol-association supplying about 20% of the German market got into\r\nconsiderable difficulties.\r\n\r\n2. due to suddenly considerably increased demands of the Rumanians,\r\nwho offer fuel only in exchange for foreign bills proper [Bardevisen]\r\nand/or at greatly increased prices in marks. The contribution of\r\nRumanian imports to the supply of German requirements was 40% during\r\nthe last year. The firm Olex which contributes 11% to the German market\r\nhas already been forced, due to the obstruction of Rumanian deliveries,\r\nto decrease its business considerably, and will face a close-down of\r\nits market supply if relief is not procured before June 1936. Due to\r\nthis reduction of imports similar stoppages are to be expected by the\r\nother great organizations of distribution during the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Means to secure the supply._\r\n\r\nIn considering how to meet the situation the following devices are\r\n_unbearable_ for the Wehrmacht:\r\n\r\n1. Reduction of mechanized traffic because this would, in addition to\r\nprecarious economic and psychological effects, bring about a throttling\r\nof German motorization, which in view of the requirements of the\r\nWehrmacht in case of war, would be a shock to mobility and supply of\r\nreplacements.\r\n\r\n2. Just as undesirable is to be considered the diminishing of reserves.\r\nThe industrial reserves constitute the basis for mobilization, which\r\nhas to rely on firm figures which remain about constant. As a decrease\r\nof reserves has already started, the further development in this\r\ndirection is to be counteracted immediately. Aid from the reserves of\r\nthe Wehrmacht cannot be granted because these modest quantities being\r\nultimate reserves cannot be diminished under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nConsequently, only the following means are to be considered:\r\n\r\n1. Conceding to the Rumanian demands of paying imports in marks on a\r\nconsiderably raised price-basis.\r\n\r\n2. Additional payments in foreign bills proper [Bardevisen] of imports\r\nfrom Anglo-Saxon countries.\r\n\r\n3. Investigation to what extent an improvement can be achieved by\r\naccelerating or expanding the facilities for German production.\r\n\r\nThe first course has been followed by the authorization to negotiate\r\nnew contracts on the basis of the Rumanian demands. Adequate and\r\npunctual delivery to the market, however, is not yet assured hereby.\r\n\r\nRe. 2. Foreign bills [Devisen] for the minimum of the indispensable\r\nimport requirements can probably be obtained only by reduction of\r\nimport of other necessities. The narrow limits of the presently assured\r\nraw materials for armament do not allow for a decrease of such imports\r\nwhich are indispensable for the Wehrmacht. In particular we cannot do\r\nwithout the necessary quantities of metals required by the Wehrmacht\r\nfor current procurements.\r\n\r\nRe. 3. As a result of investigations made, essential changes cannot be\r\nexpected at a date within sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Uniform management of the petroleum industry._\r\n\r\nDuring the last few months the Wehrmacht has repeatedly emphasized\r\nthe unavoidable call for a uniform and planned steering of the entire\r\nGerman petroleum industry. The present dangerous situation of the\r\nGerman fuel industry puts this necessity again into the spotlight. The\r\nlack of stern guidance in the present moment must lead to severest\r\ndamages to the public and the defense of the country. The duty of a\r\nmanagement according to plans of the petroleum industry must be in the\r\nfirst line to avert the permanent threat to mechanized traffic and\r\nthe preparedness of the Wehrmacht for action lying in the extensive\r\ndependency on forces outside of the German sphere of control.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n _Enclosure 1_ to \"memorandum on the supply situation in the field of\r\n fuels and its effect on the Wehrmacht\" of 9 March 36.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------+--------------------+----------------------\r\n                               |                    |Supply of requirements\r\n                               |Mob. requirements   |     by production\r\n  -----------------------------+---------+----------+------------+---------\r\n                               |  1936   |   1938   |    1936    |    1938\r\n                               | t/Jahr  |  t/Jahr  |      %     |      %\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  Light fuels for car          |         |          |            |\r\n  engines                      | 900 000 | 1 530 000|      43    |    60.5\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  Light fuels for airplane     |         |          |            |\r\n  engines                      | 460 000 |   600 000|      39    |    61.5\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  (illegible), Fuel oil        | 650 000 | 1 280 000|      11.6  |    22\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  Heating oil                  | 800 000 | 1 200 000|      30.6  |    22\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  Lubricating oil for car      |         |          |            |\r\n  engines                      |  80 000 |   150 000|      22.5  |    23\r\n                               |         |          |            |\r\n  Lubricating oil for airplane |         |          |            |\r\n  engines                      |  35 000 |    55 000|         -  |    22\r\n  -----------------------------+---------+----------+------------+---------\r\n\r\nIIa Needed raw materials 4/28/1936 with consideration of the program\r\nfor the supply of ammunition, amounting to 200 million marks [Mil.

Col. in the General Staff Loeb\r\n\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: shows the development up to now when two years ago,\r\nthe decision for rearmament was made, it was decided to carry out the\r\nfinancing mainly outside the means of the Reichministry of Finance.\r\nThis meant the commitment of the last reserve from the very beginning.\r\nA decision which did not seem without hazards. The memorandum of 3 May\r\n1936 says the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last two years, the program was increased more and\r\nmore in its extent and speed. Thus the requirements to the Reichsbank\r\nwere increased steadily.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary to create, as basis for financing, a steady,\r\nprosperous economy, and therefore renounce the execution of other,\r\npartially irrational ideas and aims of the party. The psychological\r\nprerequisite was not disturbed by the party as such, but by many\r\nindividual groups of the party, again and again; personal attacks\r\nagainst Dr. Schacht and thus against the economy followed. Dr. Schacht\r\nhas emphasized again and again, that one must follow a cultural and\r\nlegal policy, which will leave economy alone. However one must not\r\ndescribe it as greedy and selfish from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAlso money theories of the most variable kind have been published\r\nrepeatedly, thus causing anxiety for the economy; to counteract this\r\nwas practically impossible, as the propaganda machine of the party did\r\nnot permit this.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, Dr. Schacht continued to work, because he stands\r\nwith unswerving loyalty to the Fuehrer, because he fully recognizes\r\nthe basic idea of national socialism and because at the end, the\r\ndisturbances, compared to the great task, can be considered irrelevant.\r\nPreviously, approximately 11 billion marks besides the budget have been\r\nraised for rearmament and re-employment without shaking the rates of\r\nexchange and currency; the rate of interest could be lowered.\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has repeatedly emphasized in personal talks and cabinet\r\nmeetings, that the speed of rearmament must be kept up until the spring\r\nof 1936. This was agreed to and carried out.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: has never heard about this time limitation.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: The main question for the further execution of\r\nthe program is, how much money can be gotten out of business. Some 2\r\nbillion can be consolidated annually by long term loans, 8 to 9 billion\r\ncannot be asked for; the possibility of making available depends on the\r\ndevelopment of the money market. Full concentration of the money market\r\nthrough the Reichsbank is necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the Reichsbank should have to issue more notes than could be born by\r\nthe currency, one must reach back to other factors.\r\n\r\nDr. Schacht will never be part to an inflation; the Fuehrer also has\r\ndecided in this sense. The danger of such a development is imminent. If\r\na road is to be taken, which contains this danger, Dr. Schacht would\r\nlike to drop out on time, so that he does not disturb the new course.\r\n\r\nDr. Schacht considers it impossible, that prices can be fixed by the\r\nstate, if the same money policy is continued.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: What is the basis of currency with the\r\nReichsbank?\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: This question has nothing to do with the gold\r\nstandard. It is a question of something imponderable, to recognize the\r\ntime of which must be left up to fine sensitivity. If by a surplus of\r\nmoney, the danger of devaluation of the mark exists, the state can and\r\nmust take action from the financial side by taxes, etc. Considering\r\nthe material factor, it must be determined, that we are dependent for\r\nnumerous goods on foreign countries. Even small percentages as a whole\r\nhave considerable effect. In many cases, the necessity for import\r\nis caused by trade political relations; therefore the raw-material\r\nsituation may not only be viewed and attacked from the production\r\nwithin Germany. The foreign relations must be decreased all of a\r\nsudden. For instance the negotiations with Standard and Shell were\r\ncarried out on this basis.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: When substitutes [ersatzstoffe] are\r\nsufficient in quantity, we shall no longer need the import, which\r\npresents us such difficulties.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: In a series of cases, to be able to carry out the\r\nimport, work from within Germany was utilized for compensation, for\r\ninstance tankers for oil import corporations.\r\n\r\nHowever it is especially required that nothing be said about intentions\r\nand measures of this field in public, so as not to aggravate the\r\nimporters.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: If the Fuehrer has expressed himself in this\r\ndirection, he did it to counteract the increasing pessimism in the\r\ncountry in respect to this field.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: In any case, all anxiety must be prevented.\r\nForeign exporters have already shown less readiness to deliver against\r\ncertificate of foreign exchange, since they apparently have no\r\nconfidence in the cashing of these certificates.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: Our raw material situation is generally known\r\nto the world. The article published in the papers on 28 April 1936 did\r\nnot contain anything secret. Actually the confidence abroad should\r\nhave been increased by this publication, because generally the opinion\r\nwas held abroad that Dr. Schacht was protected by the Prime Minister\r\nagainst the party.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: The situation at present is thus:\r\n\r\nSome 64 million marks are already claimed by reimbursement.\r\n\r\nWe must buy especially crude rubber and textiles; we have practically\r\nno crude rubber. Cellulose wool is not an adequate substitute,\r\nespecially not for export goods.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for the closing down of manufacturing plants will soon\r\nresult from this accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt must be decided whether the available gold should be all spent at\r\nthe present speed or whether it should already be slowed down.\r\n\r\nSwedish ores are still available for about 3 months. The export to\r\nSweden becomes more difficult, and thus the import possibilities\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: is of the opinion that our export to Sweden\r\ncontinues, so that one can further count on import.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: The raw material supply of Germany amounted at the\r\nbeginning of the war to a value of about 7 to 8 billions; now it is\r\nless than 1 billion.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: has heard repeatedly, that export business\r\nwas refused by the Reichminister for Economy. In the future, the\r\ndepartments will be caused by him to re-examine such occurrences;\r\nperhaps then it will work differently than until now.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: Increase of our export appears improbable in the\r\nnear future. Further obligations arise through the Foreign Office, the\r\nReichsbank, Post Office, Party and other agencies; soon the consular\r\nservice cannot be paid any more.\r\n\r\nThe time will come, when we will have no longer any reserves of either\r\nraw materials or foreign exchange at our disposal.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: If we have war to-morrow, we must help\r\nourselves by substitutes. Then money will not play any role at all. If\r\nthat is the case, then we must be ready to create the prerequisites\r\nfor that in peace. The account just described could have also been\r\npresented, in his opinion, in the meeting this morning.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: Publication is recommended for only the smallest\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: It is necessary to inform the people required\r\nfor the execution.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: In his opinion only the ministers, not the\r\nstate secretaries. In addition, each department must be called in\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: The psychological prerequisites for the\r\ncorrect approach to the work must be created everywhere. The actual\r\nwork is done by the state-secretaries and the experts. In the future\r\none must go much more into detail; confidence in the persons employed\r\nin this is absolute necessity.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: summarizes the explanation by Minister\r\nSchacht: In short, demands on the Reichsbank can no longer be covered;\r\nonly 64 million marks are still available.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: declares that besides these 64 million Reichsmarks\r\nin the private banks, there are another 72 million gold with the\r\nReichsbank.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: continues with the summary: The shortage of\r\nraw material is known in its extent. A considerable increase is no\r\nlonger possible, in the opinion of Minister Schacht.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: The production of raw materials within Germany\r\nfinds its limitation there, when an increase of prices of export goods\r\nis created by it.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: One can separate requirements within Germany\r\nand export. Even the smallest details are important. The following\r\nappears necessary.\r\n\r\n1. Increase of export despite all difficulties.\r\n\r\n2. The raw material coverage within Germany.\r\n\r\n3. The possibly necessary resettlement of workers and food-fundamentals\r\nfor the execution of all measures.\r\n\r\nThese problems all affect each other, so that the participation of all\r\ndepartments is necessary.\r\n\r\nAppropriate example: Position of the farmer, who does not utilize the\r\navailable possibility of intensifying of fertilizing, because the\r\ncapital lost is not bearable for him in case of bad harvests. In such a\r\ncase, the risk lying with the weather must be partially taken from the\r\nfarmer by a special organization.\r\n\r\nThe Reichministry of Finance must also be consulted greatly in\r\nreference to the regular budget. Re-awakening of thriftiness in all\r\nfields belongs to this program.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: The final conclusions made by Dr. Schacht are\r\nclear and convincing, under the condition that the bases for these\r\nconclusions are correct. That must be examined. It must be determined\r\nagain, whether the principles, according to which the present raw\r\nmaterial and foreign currency policy has been carried out with such a\r\nbig success, are unalterable and correct.\r\n\r\nThe time when perhaps an inflation is feared is unclear; actually it is\r\nalready here, even if it has a bearable extent.\r\n\r\nAn increase of export cannot be expected with the present system.\r\nHowever it is to be examined, whether there is not a better system.\r\nThe basis of the present economic policy is deflationary. However it\r\nappears impossible to integrate the deflation into an actually existing\r\ninflation. It must be discussed, whether forced economy of export is to\r\nbe continued.\r\n\r\nIt is to be examined further, whether the money for rearmament can be\r\ndrawn out from the remaining economy. In no case may the condition\r\narise, that the Reichminister for Finance and the Reichminister for\r\nEconomy push the responsibility for the providing of funds to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe difference between 2 billion Reichsmarks, which the Reichsbank\r\nbelieves to be able to raise on a long term basis, and the 8 to 9\r\nbillion Reichsmarks required for armament, cannot be covered by taxes.\r\nTherefore the following suggestion:\r\n\r\n1. The raw material question, which can be solved comparatively simply,\r\nmust be attended to at once by a special committee.\r\n\r\n2. Illuminate critically the export question, so to say, in a\r\nscientific manner.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Krosigk_: Economy of foreign exchange in detail is\r\nnecessary. In that, small things also play a part. Equal saving is\r\nnecessary in spending money within Germany. In contrast to Minister\r\nPopitz, he is of the opinion that expenses for armament must be taken\r\nover more and more by the regular budget. Expenses above this budget\r\nare to be covered\r\n\r\na. by long term consolidation of annually some 2 billion marks.\r\n\r\nb. by short term bills of exchange and similarly.\r\n\r\nThe financing has succeeded up to now by these two means.\r\n\r\nHowever the danger exists, the short-term bills of exchange can no\r\nlonger be negotiated, so that flooding of the Reichsbank with MEFO\r\nbills would have an increased printing of banknotes as consequence.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: In this case, printing of bank notes is only\r\nnecessary if the money is absolutely necessary for payment of wages\r\namong other unavoidable things.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Krosigk_: The decisive question for that is, whether\r\ninflation would actually happen by printing of banknotes to this\r\nextent. He does not believe so. The increase of prices observed so far\r\nwas not caused by monetary reasons, but can be derived from increase\r\nof prices for raw materials and agricultural products. Thus one cannot\r\nspeak of an inflation.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: does not believe that an inflation would\r\nhappen from the monetary angle.\r\n\r\nMeasures which in a state with a parliamentary government would\r\nprobably bring about inflation, do not have to have the same results in\r\na totalitarian state.\r\n\r\nImportant for this is the application of an appropriate propaganda,\r\nso that the co-operation of the propaganda ministry, promised by the\r\nFuehrer, is of great importance.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: gives a summary of the holdings of bills of\r\nexchange in the Reichsbank at present:\r\n\r\n 4,353,000,000.--RM bills of exchange\r\n\r\n 3,731,000,000.--RM of which are in MEFO bills of exchange\r\n\r\n 2,200,000.--MEFO bills of exchange are deposited in clearing accounts.\r\n\r\nMore than 5 billions in bills of exchange are deposited thus, that\r\nthey can be presented immediately in case of disturbances of the money\r\nmarket, caused by any measure. Therefore any disturbance must be\r\nprevented under all conditions.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: agrees to be the \"shield\" for the measure of\r\nfinancial nature, so that no disturbances would happen.\r\n\r\nThe regular budget is to take over the current upkeep of the armed\r\nforces, but not the costs of the reconstruction.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: It is to be examined whether the regular budget\r\ncannot be relieved from interests and amortization quotas of advance\r\ndrawings. Even the observing of the international bank law cannot\r\nprevent the using of these recognized necessary measures in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIf the economy is started by increased export, naturally the\r\ncirculation of money will increase and with that the possibility of\r\nfurther financing.\r\n\r\nIf the money, which had to be put into circulation, is only used for\r\npayment of wages, no inflation can take place.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: orders:\r\n\r\n1. Determination as rapidly as possible of the basis of payment.\r\n\r\n2. Beginning of the execution work in the realm of raw material\r\nproduction within Germany.\r\n\r\n3. Examination of the question of the export system.\r\n\r\nIn the next conference, contemplated for Friday afternoon, the\r\nexamination of the export system is to take place.\r\n\r\nFirst under his chairmanship (Goering's) the ministers Dr. Schacht,\r\nGraf Schwerin von Krosigk and Prof. Dr. Popitz will consult each other.\r\nThen, immediately thereafter, the suggestions voiced there are to be\r\ndiscussed by a board of experts. The following were named for this\r\nboard:\r\n\r\n  By Minister Schacht:\r\n      Reichsbank Director Brinkman\r\n      Reichsbank Director Blessing\r\n      Ministerialdirektor Dr. Sarnow\r\n\r\n  By Minister von Blomberg:\r\n      Dr. Trendelenburg\r\n\r\n  By Minister Popitz:\r\n      Dr. Springorum\r\n      Dr. Sogemeier\r\n\r\n  Further\r\n      Reg. Burgermeister Kroogmann\r\n      Prof. Wayemann\r\n  and others, who will be appointed by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: states that he can expect and demand\r\ndiscipline from the party, so that the protection of the individual\r\nauditor, called, is guaranteed.\r\n\r\n  Close of the conference;

Col in the General Staff Loeb\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: The two sessions of the board of experts held\r\nso far have brought forth interesting discussions. Naturally, opinions\r\nfrequently disagree. The experts are invited to state their concepts in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nToday, discussion concerning the question of substitute-material. What\r\nobjections are made to the production of war-raw materials within the\r\nReich?\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: Principly there is nothing to object; a solution of\r\nthe raw material problem by self-producing is absolutely necessary and\r\nagreed with, theoretically.\r\n\r\nDifficulties are encountered with regard to:\r\n\r\n1. serious monetary strain because of investments. Providing money by\r\ntaxing capital is impossible. Circulation of money can not be increased\r\nbeyond a certain amount. Previous measures executed correctly and\r\nwithout danger to monetary value. Further increase seems precarious;\r\nmatter of confidence. This point of view alone, however, not\r\ndetermining; possible that funds could be drawn from industrial profits.\r\n\r\n2. special scruples, regarding the cases where prices for substitute\r\n[Ersatz] material are far beyond world-market prices, and therefore the\r\nproducts cannot compete (for example: tires made from Buna). Adjustment\r\nwould further increase the excise tax on exports. Inflation cannot be\r\nchosen, as this would immediately upset the state's budget.\r\n\r\nIt must be attempted to produce those raw materials within Germany\r\nwhich are economically favorable; _for other raw materials ready\r\nreserves for the case of mobilization_ [_Mobfall_]. Especially clear\r\nis the situation of flax; the complete covering of the requirement is\r\npossible; however not with hemp.\r\n\r\n_Certain raw materials for war must be stocked._\r\n\r\nThese viewpoints are recognized and followed by the Reich ministry\r\nfor Economy. The execution is mainly dependent on the question of\r\nfunds. Therefore, necessity to save in all fields, to make saved funds\r\navailable for investment.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: All measures are to be considered from the\r\nstandpoint of an assured waging of war.\r\n\r\nReady reserves must ordinarily be accumulated already in peace in\r\ncertain amounts.\r\n\r\nIt is to be attempted to use cheap imported raw materials for export\r\npurposes, expensive raw materials from within Germany. In cases where\r\nthe price differences are small, probably creation of a settlement is\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: This settlement can be carried out either by\r\ncompulsory mixing or by a price settlement by the state of the\r\nexpensive raw materials.\r\n\r\n_In any case, price supervision must be introduced again._\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: Placing of the burden of increased prices on the\r\nconsumer is possible when the difference is only small.\r\n\r\nThe other possible method is sales monopoly or wholesale monopoly of\r\ncertain goods.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: It is recommendable not to influence individual,\r\nlarge fields, for instance textiles, by prices; but to concentrate\r\nfunds for the monetary subsidation of other fields of raw materials.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Krosigk_: The question cannot generally be judged\r\ntheoretically, but only practically with the use of individual examples.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: At first, the specially urgent petroleum\r\nquestion is to be treated.\r\n\r\nGeneral agreement to that.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Krosigk_: Present experience is that the beginning of new\r\nmethods of sale or price guarantee by the Reich results thus, that soon\r\nnew and cheaper production methods are found. This recommends a not too\r\nsudden expansion of production.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: Waiting for new methods is no longer\r\nappropriate. Plan of the Reich forestry office for the utilization of\r\nwood is ready. Import of timber must be cut down in any case; strongest\r\ndemands on German forests to be preferred at present and can be\r\nadvocated.\r\n\r\nIt is to be decided, whether at the beginning, a risk bonus over 6%\r\nprofit is to be granted.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: turns against higher profits than 6%. Guarantee of\r\ninterest-bearing is to be preferred, and must be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Krosigk_: discusses the advantages of the amortization\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Popitz_: In contracts many times rapid cancellation is\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: At the beginning more consideration is recommended,\r\nlater stronger concentration, with profit sharing by the Reich.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: requests that the cancellation periods be\r\nre-examined by a special committee.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: The summary is to be prepared for the next\r\ncommittee meeting about:\r\n\r\n1. Inventory of German Raw Material possibilities.\r\n\r\n2. Form of the present decrease.\r\n\r\n3. Mobilization requirement.\r\n\r\n4. How shall raw materials be handled? Especially clarifications\r\nwhether production within Germany is to start already in peace or\r\nwhether the stocking or reserves is more important.\r\n\r\nSubject of petroleum also can be considered concluded, therefore is to\r\nbe handled immediately.\r\n\r\nIn the next council of Ministers, discussion of the agricultural\r\nquestion, then Minister Darré and State secretary Backe present.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Blomberg_: In the fuel industry it is to be decided\r\nwhether conversion to solid fuels should already be carried out\r\nin peace, or whether, as in France, it is to be prepared for the\r\nmobilization case. If possible and recommendable, increased use of tar\r\ncoke [Schwelkok], no diesel oil for railroads.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: Economy also absolutely necessary and to be\r\ninsisted on in other fields of raw materials.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Blomberg_: Examine as an example substitution of\r\nheavy metal by light metal (for instance cans of aluminum): general\r\nincrease of the use of glass, especially for aerial bombs, maybe\r\nalso for grenades; use of plastics for wide fields, even as far as\r\ntransmissions. Certain hopes can be set on China. Therefore prevent\r\npolitical estrangement. Careful advances in the approaching of Japan\r\nnecessary, at present the recognition of Manchukuo would be disastrous\r\nfor Mr. Klein's current plans in China.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: Common front of China with Japan against\r\nSoviet Russia can probably be produced.\r\n\r\n [in green pencil] I did _not_ express myself so specifically BL/\r\n\r\n_Minister von Blomberg_: Japan is doubtful as a factor of military\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: Furthermore, the danger of Japan's turnabout\r\nalways exists.\r\n\r\nResults of the China affair cannot be viewed clearly because of the\r\nunclear inner political situation.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: always has supported the attempts of Mr. Klein,\r\nbecause he especially hopes for food, raw materials from China.\r\n\r\n_Minister von Blomberg_: recommends further collaboration with the\r\nKaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft, with whom the Reichministry of War had\r\nvery good experiences. At its head is the scientific authority; other\r\nimminent changes for solution proposed by the party unbearable.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: Nomination of Geheimrat Bosch is possible for this\r\npost, when his resignation from the IG is possible.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: General complaints about the deterioration of\r\nGerman science; this is also harmful for export, since the missing\r\nreplacement limits the execution of German engineering missions abroad\r\nand thus German orders from abroad.\r\n\r\n_Minister Popitz_: Seconds these complaints. Actions by the party which\r\nremove the most important people is unbearable. Explanation by examples.\r\n\r\nIn the liberal arts, the consequences are not being felt immediately,\r\nall the more so in the natural sciences. If service etc., should be\r\nlimited to the first two semesters of study, then full time and freedom\r\nfor scientific activity.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: In Prussia then, difficulties are partially\r\nremoved. Influence of the liaison staff not always fortunate. Role of\r\nProfessor Wagner.\r\n\r\nPuts to discussion a taking over of a Spanish tin source, which is\r\nbeing offered from the Swedish side.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: Basically in agreement, particularly when in a\r\npartnership enterprise German achievements will result by deliveries of\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: asks Minister Schacht to conduct negotiations\r\nin this spirit during his visit in Belgrade relative to Jugoslavia in\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\n_Minister Schacht_: The copper mining in Jugoslavia must take place by\r\nexcluding the French, who sell copper for foreign exchange only.\r\n\r\n_Prime Minister Goering_: During the next ministerial session,\r\nthe investigation of the problems in the agricultural sector has\r\nto be conducted in such a way that direct statements of Minister\r\nSchacht/Minister Darré should be made about the single problematic\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n  End of the session 13 o'clock.\r\n\r\nFuel-supply situation (1st draft of a

Top Secret WH\r\n\r\n  4 copies--\r\n  1st copy--draft\r\n  2nd copy--Reich Air Ministry\r\n  3rd copy--Reich Ministry for Finances\r\n  4th copy--President of the Reichsbank\r\n\r\n 1. To the Reich Minister of Air and the Supreme Commander of the Air\r\n Forces General Goering\r\n\r\n  Berlin W 8\r\n  Dear General Goering!\r\n\r\nThe negotiations conducted until now in the commission for foreign\r\nexchange and raw materials which is under your leadership, have\r\nalready shown the necessity of dealing also with the financing of the\r\narmed forces there also. I believe the time has now arrived that the\r\ncommission should take up the treatment of this problem.\r\n\r\nAs a preparation of such a discussion I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n I. _Overstepping of the 1936 budget._\r\n\r\nIt has been proven, particularly from the decree issued 7 March 1936,\r\nthat the sum of about 10 billions of RM which was provided for the\r\nWehrmacht for 1936 is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n1. Additional expenses in the _army_ are needed in first place for\r\n\r\na. the remilitarizing of the Rhineland\r\n\r\nb. the fortification of the Rhineland\r\n\r\nc. the setting up of all the 36 divisions already by 1 Oct 1936\r\n\r\nd. the speeding-up of motorization, particularly the establishment of 4\r\nfully motorized Infantry divisions.\r\n\r\ne. the necessity of markedly increasing the reserve ammunition because\r\nof the increased number of divisions.\r\n\r\nf. industrial preparations in a great variety of fields.\r\n\r\n2. In the _navy_ the required faster increase of personnel, the\r\nbuilding of a 4th entry to Wilhelmshaven and the refortification of\r\nHelgoland cause additional expenses.\r\n\r\n3. _Air Force_\r\n\r\na. According to an order of the Fuehrer, the setting up of all air\r\nforce units has to be completed on 1 April 1937. Therefore considerable\r\nexpenditures have to be made in 1936 which at the time when the\r\nbudget for 1936 was made, were planned for later years only. Special\r\nadditional expenses are caused by the creation of sufficient ground\r\nforce personnel.\r\n\r\nb. In the air force the first introduction of new types has to take\r\nplace in 1937. Therefore the required industrial preparations have to\r\nbegin in 1936.\r\n\r\nIt follows that an additional sum of at least 3.6 billions of RM will\r\nbe needed by the Wehrmacht for 1936.\r\n\r\nOf this about 1 billion RM is allotted to Army and Navy together. In\r\nthe case of the Army and Navy, the execution of the orders and, in\r\nconsequence, the dead-lines for the payments of the deliveries lagged\r\nquite considerably behind the placing of the orders. Therefore it can\r\nbe assumed that these 1 billion RM will not be needed _in cash_ before\r\n1 Apr 1937. However, the orders for these 1 billion RM have been placed\r\nand in the fiscal year 1937 these 1 billion RM will also be needed in\r\ncash.\r\n\r\nIn the air force the additional expenditures amount to 2600 millions\r\nRM. Here the execution of the orders from the budget funds of 1936\r\nas well as of the orders for the additional requirements is in full\r\nprogress. The 2600 millions RM for the air force have to be made\r\navailable in the fiscal year 1936.\r\n\r\nAs yet it cannot be ultimately settled whether the introduction of the\r\ntwo years' service will lead to further additional expenses.\r\n\r\nII. _Requirements for 1937_\r\n\r\nThe preparatory works for the budget of 1937 have not been concluded.\r\nAt present the requirements for 1937 are estimated to be for:\r\n\r\n  1. the army           6.5 billions RM\r\n  2. the navy           1.2 billions RM\r\n  3. the air force      6.0 billions RM\r\n                       ----------------\r\n          Total        13.7 billions RM\r\n\r\nBesides these 13.7 billions RM about 500 millions RM will be needed for\r\nthe Reich defense requirements of the civilian departments.\r\n\r\nIII. _Permanent requirements_\r\n\r\nAccording to a recently conducted survey, the component of the armed\r\nforces will have the following permanent requirement after the rearming\r\nis completed:\r\n\r\n  1. Army               3.6   billions RM\r\n  2. Navy               0.73  billions RM\r\n  3. Air Force          2.507 billions RM\r\n                       ------------------\r\n         Total          6.837 billions RM\r\n\r\nAt present it is hardly possible to make an accurate estimate of the\r\npermanent requirements. In the case of the Army it is very likely that\r\nthe amount for the permanent requirement will be considerably raised.\r\n\r\nLater I will submit further material, particularly a statement about\r\nthe requirements for the years until the completion of the rearming, as\r\nsoon as the necessary inquiries are concluded.\r\n\r\nI submitted copies of this letter to the Reich Minister for Finance,\r\nand to the President of the Reichsbank.\r\n\r\n  Heil Hitler!\r\n  Yours,\r\n  [unsigned]\r\n\r\n 2.

There is only one\r\nthing in our needy position: _the promotion of export_. _Every threat\r\nagainst foreign countries_ however, will show contrary results.\r\n\r\nWe have reverses in the field of fuels until the middle of next\r\nyear, there will not be large amounts in the field of rubber. The\r\nRenn-process in the field of ores is having great difficulties.\r\n\r\nIf we now shout out our decision abroad to make ourselves economically\r\nindependent, then we cut our own throats, because we can no longer\r\nsurvive the necessary transitory period.\r\n\r\nAlso, it must always be pointed out that German materials are at\r\npresent much too expensive to be used for export, and export alone\r\nmakes further armament possible.\r\n\r\nIf the food-basis of the people is not to be endangered, the Fuehrer\r\nmust refrain from his plan.\r\n\r\nPresident Schacht concluded that he again requests urgently to listen\r\nto this warning, and that he forwards it to the minister of war, as he\r\nwill not participate in to-morrow's conference.\r\n\r\n  Thomas 2/9 [in blue pencil]\r\n\r\n  [Translator's note: the following is written in pencil in the\r\n  original:]\r\n\r\n  _THOMAS in his memorandum:_\r\n\r\nThe missing million in cash must be saved, since there is no more\r\npossibility to obtain it by increase of export.\r\n\r\nEnglish armament-ore!

Aluminum supply.\r\n\r\nI. After extensive study of the connected disadvantages, the\r\nReichministry for economy has dropped the principle that one could\r\ndesist from exporting all products with more than 40% foreign raw\r\nmaterials. Therefore an additional need for foreign exchange results\r\nfor the upkeep of the export of 2 million marks with the supervisory\r\nboard for base metals. Furthermore the allotment of cash foreign\r\nexchange to the supervisory board for bast fibres must be increased\r\nfrom 10 million marks to 17 million marks.\r\n\r\nIntendanturrat Nierhoff made reports on the need of the Armed Forces of\r\ntextiles and leather in the year 1937, which has increased considerably\r\nfrom the requirements of the year 1936 (see inclosure). To fulfill\r\nthese Armed Forces requirements, cash foreign exchange is necessary in\r\nthe following amounts:\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+-------------------------------------\r\n                                | Additional Armed Forces requirements\r\n          Group of goods        | of cash foreign exchange in millions\r\n                                |               of marks\r\n  ------------------------------+-------------------------------------\r\n  1.

Aluminum\r\n\r\nReport on the requirements of aluminum for the Armed Forces are\r\ncontained in the summary given to the Reichministry for Economy on 29\r\nAug.\r\n\r\nMajor Czimatis explained that the Reichministry of War did not renounce\r\nthe limitations of the allotments of aluminum to the general industry,\r\nas it was said in the letter of the Reichministry for Economy of 21 Aug\r\n1936, but that the demands for full delivery to the Armed forces for\r\nthe programatic rearmament, especially for the Air Force, will be kept\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe Reichministry for Economy considers the full delivery to industry\r\nurgently necessary also in the interest of the Armed Forces, since by\r\na \"strangulation\" installations important to the Armed Forces (power\r\nissues) would also be affected immediately, and one could therefore\r\ncount on an increased requirement of copper and thus of foreign\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nThe administration of aluminum by the supervisory board for base metals\r\nis being absolutely refused by the Reichministry for Economy.\r\n\r\nGeneraldirektor Schirner reports that the negotiations for the import\r\nof 1000 tons of aluminum from Switzerland against delivery of German\r\nclay and pitch-coke are favorable. Also, the payment of processing\r\nwages is to be done with clay. However, the import of these 1000 tons\r\nis distributed over 6 to 7 months.\r\n\r\n1000 tons more can be obtained in a comparatively short time from the\r\nAluminum Ltd. from Canada. The negotiations for this are still in\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nSchirner reported that the stocks of aluminum in the plants is so high\r\nthat he, in case the Reichministry for Air should agree to a temporary\r\ndecrease of the stocks, could guarantee full delivery for both the\r\nArmed Forces and Industry until the opening of the new plants in Toging\r\nand Bitterfeld.\r\n\r\nLt.

Ploch consents that the stocks be decreased temporarily.\r\n\r\nThe Reichministry for Economy orders that the supervisory board for\r\nbase metals first determine by revision the exact size of the stocks of\r\naluminum for the Duren Metal works and the combined Light Metal works\r\n[Vereinigten leicht Metall Werke].\r\n\r\nHowever, if difficulties should arise in the delivery to the Armed\r\nForces with aluminum, then the Reichministry for Economy is ready to\r\ntake up negotiations again.\r\n\r\n  MW      [initials in pencil]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInclosure\r\n\r\nTextile and Leather Requirements of the Armed Forces\r\n\r\n------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n                                    |           |           |Required\r\n                                    |           |           |additional\r\n                                    |Requirement|Requirement|cash foreign\r\nRaw materials                       |in the year|in the year|exchange\r\n                                    |1936 in    |1937 in    |requirements\r\n                                    |tons       |tons       |in millions\r\n                                    |           |           |of marks\r\n------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\nSheared wool                        |      7 200|     18 152|      24\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nWool scrap [Reisswolle]             |      1 040|      4 900|       3\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCombings                            |         11|         42|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nMohair wool                         |          -|        260|       0.75\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nWool from tanned hides              |           |           |\r\n  [Gerberwolle]                     |        761|      1 236|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nSilk                                |         23|         72|       0.5\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCocoons[4]                          |         72|         72|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nSilk yarns[4]                       |         48|         48|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCotton of which quality cotton      |      8 600|     16 200|\r\nPortiers and shelter halves (Egypt) |           |about 4 000|       4\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCotton scraps                       |        560|        835|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nArtificial silk                     |        310|        670|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCellulose wool                      |      1 080|      3 130|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nCleaned flax [Schwingflachs]        |      3 600|      4 800|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nFlax scrap                          |      7 070|     10 500|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nJute                                |      2 100|      2 100|       -\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nSoft hemp and hard fibers           |      1 100|      1 635|       0.25[5]\r\nof which hard fiber                 |           | about 200 |\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nSleek leather                       |     11 000|     24 000|\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nSkins for uppers                    |      7 100|     13 900|\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nTanned leather                      |           |      4 100|       ----\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\nLeather for soles                   |           |      9 500|       22.5[6]\r\n                                    |           |           |\r\n                                    |           |           | Total 55.00\r\n------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: figures by Reichministry for air]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: for 400 tons soft hemp and 200 tons Manila and Sisal]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: for 22 500 tons hides corresponding to 11 200 tons\r\nleather]\r\n\r\nIt must be considered in the calculation of the foreign exchange\r\nrequirements for the upkeep of the export of woolen goods, that the\r\nwool industry cannot stand more than a 10% decrease of the present\r\namount, if it is to retain its export capability. Instead of Australian\r\nwool, one must reach back to about 50% of the available South-African\r\nwool for exports. The wool available through the limitations of value\r\nof the clearing agreement is entirely used for export. The calculated\r\namount of foreign exchange and the most urgent requirement within\r\nGermany of 12 million marks only applies under the condition that there\r\nare until the end of September still 2 million marks in cash foreign\r\nexchange available.\r\n\r\nOne can count for the requirement of the Armed Forces on an amount of\r\n10,000 tons raw wool, based on existing agreement. 24 million marks in\r\ncash foreign exchange are required for the additional amount of 8,152\r\ntons with the price basis of 3,000-marks per ton.\r\n\r\nIntendanturrat Nierhoff explained: that a decrease of the demands\r\nfor quality for the Armed Forces is no longer bearable. Already 20%\r\ncellulose wool is being earmarked for uniform cloths, and a mixing of\r\n30% scrap wool for over-coats.\r\n\r\nThe amount of foreign exchange of 4 million marks for quality cotton is\r\ntherefore necessary, because one cannot count any more on the hitherto\r\nexisting compensating transactions--especially with Egypt after\r\ncircular 237.\r\n\r\nThe amount of foreign exchange estimated for export of 17 million marks\r\nfor the supervisory board for bast fibres is distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  10 million marks for jute\r\n  6 million marks for Sisal\r\n  1 million marks for Manila\r\n\r\nThe production of hides in Germany is reported as 140,000 tons per\r\nyear. Even with the basis that the consumption of leather within\r\nGermany is decreased to a minimum, the 22,500 ton hides, corresponding\r\nto 11,200 tons leather for the Armed Forces, can only be procured with\r\ncash foreign exchange (22.5 million marks).\r\n\r\nThe raw hide requirement has been determined individually with\r\nconsideration for the time required to tan the individual types of\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [in pencil] Top Secret!\r\n\r\n Conference at General Field Marshal Goering's at 1000, 14 Oct. 38, in\r\n the Reich Air Ministry\r\n\r\n  [in pencil] attention H.G.\r\n\r\nGeneral Field Marshal Goering opened the session by declaring that\r\nhe intended to give directives about the work for the next months.\r\nEverybody knows from the press what the world situation looks like\r\nand therefore the Fuehrer has issued an order to him to carry out\r\na gigantic program compared to which previous achievements are\r\ninsignificant. There are difficulties in the way which he will overcome\r\nwith utmost energy and ruthlessness.\r\n\r\nThe amount of foreign exchange has completely dwindled on account of\r\nthe preparation for the Czech enterprise, and this makes it necessary\r\nthat it should be strongly increased immediately. Furthermore, the\r\nforeign credits have been greatly over-drawn and thus the strongest\r\nexport activity--stronger than up to now--is in the foreground. For the\r\nnext weeks an increased export was first priority in order to improve\r\nthe foreign exchange situation. The Reich Ministry for Economy _should\r\nmake_ a plan about raising the export activity by pushing aside the\r\ncurrent difficulties which prevent export.\r\n\r\nThese gains made through the export are to be used for increased\r\narmament. The armament should not be curtailed by the export activity.\r\nHe received the order from the Fuehrer to increase the armament to\r\nan abnormal extent, the air force having first priority. Within the\r\nshortest time the air force is to be increased five fold, also the navy\r\nshould get armed more rapidly and the army should procure large amounts\r\nof offensive weapons at a faster rate, particularly heavy artillery\r\npieces and heavy tanks. Along with this manufactured armaments must go;\r\nespecially fuel, powder and explosives are moved into the foreground.\r\nIt should be coupled with the accelerated construction of highways,\r\ncanals, and particularly of the railroads.\r\n\r\nTo this comes the Four Years' Plan which is to be reorganized according\r\nto 2 points of view.\r\n\r\nIn the Four Years' Plan in 1st place all the constructions which are\r\nin the service of armament are to be promoted and in 2nd place all the\r\ninstallations are to be created which really spare foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nThe substitutes produced by the Four Years' Plan are to be brought\r\nrapidly into circulation. The Reich Ministry for Economy and the other\r\nagencies should make suggestions by the beginning of November for\r\nrapidly increasing the introduction of the substitutes. The import of\r\nmaterials for which we have substitutes has to be drastically curtailed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Field Marshal Goering enlarged then upon the main problem of\r\nthe session: how can these requirements be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nHe is faced with unheard difficulties. The treasury is empty, the\r\nindustrial capacity is crammed with orders for many years. In spite\r\nof these difficulties he is going to change the situation under all\r\ncircumstances. Memoranda were of no help, he desires only positive\r\nproposals. If necessary, he is going to convert the economy with brutal\r\nmethods in order to achieve his aim. The time has come when private\r\nenterprise can show whether it has a right for continued existence. If\r\nit fails, he is going over to state enterprise without any regard. He\r\nis going to make barbaric use of his plenipotentiary power which was\r\ngiven to him by the Fuehrer.\r\n\r\nAll the wishes and plans of the state, party and other agencies which\r\nare not entirely in this line have to be rejected without pity. Also\r\nthe ideological problems cannot be solved now, there will be time for\r\nthem later. He urgently cautions against making promises to the workers\r\nwhich can not be kept by him. The wishes of the labor front recede\r\nentirely into the background. Industry has to be fully converted. An\r\nimmediate investigation of all productive plants is to be initiated\r\nin order to determine whether they can be converted for armament and\r\nexport or whether they are to be closed down. The problem of the\r\nmachine industry has the first consideration in this respect. There is\r\nno place for printing and laundry machines and other machines of that\r\nkind, they all have to produce machine tools. In the field of machine\r\ntools the priorities of the orders are to be investigated, and wherever\r\npossible, increase in productive capacity is to be introduced. It\r\nfollows without saying that work has to be conducted in 3 shifts.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to decide who is going to carry out this task; the\r\nstate of the self-administrative industry. He requested a proposal\r\nfrom General Director Zangen for the methods to realize these plans.\r\nHe warns all agencies, particularly the labor front, price controller,\r\netc., from interfering with these proposals in any way. He is going to\r\nproceed ruthlessly against every interference on the part of the Labor\r\nFront. The Labor Front would not receive raw materials and workers for\r\nits tasks any more. Similarly all other party requirements have to be\r\nset aside without consideration. Foreign workers can continue being\r\nemployed except in the particularly secret sections of the enterprise.\r\nAt the present time the plants should not be burdened with unnecessary\r\ndemands, such as athletic fields, casinos or similar desires of the\r\nLabor Front. Measures proposed by the Labor Front have to be submitted\r\nto him for approval.\r\n\r\nRaw materials and power are to be subjected to accurate management.\r\nSimilarly the distribution of men has to be organized in an entirely\r\ndifferent way than it has been done until now. The retraining did not\r\nfunction; all agencies failed. The recommitment of the youth into the\r\nindustry will be organized by him on a very large scale. Large state\r\napprenticeships are to be created; besides, the plants will be obliged\r\nto hire a certain number of apprentices. A retraining of hundreds of\r\nthousands of people will have to take place. Much more work will have\r\nto be performed by women than until now. Above all, the young women\r\nhave to be employed much more. Work periods of eight hours do not exist\r\nany more; wherever necessary, overtime is to be performed, double and\r\ntriple shifts are a matter of course. Where the workers will protest,\r\nas in Austria, for example, General Field Marshal Goering will proceed\r\nwith forced labor; he will create camps for forced labor. The Labor\r\nFront should not carry false social ideas among the workers. It is a\r\nfact that one generation has driven the cart into the mud through the\r\nmutiny of the workers and by being guilty of not having shot these\r\nworkers on the spot. Therefore, we had to put the thing in order again.\r\n\r\nMuch is to be done at once in the field of transportation. The Ministry\r\nfor Transportation should submit a request about the construction of\r\nrolling stock and about other requirements. The branch-canal near the\r\nHermann Goering Works is particularly important. It cannot continue\r\nthat the Armed Forces interfere with the car park. If that will\r\ncontinue, he will make a decision, because it is impossible that the\r\npeople should starve on account of it.\r\n\r\nIn the agriculture it is of importance to employ foreign workers.\r\nSimilarly the problem of the agricultural machine has to be promoted.\r\nOf particular importance is the erection of store-houses.\r\n\r\nThe Sudeten land has to be exploited with all the means. General\r\nField Marshal Goering counts upon a complete industrial assimilation\r\nof Slovakia. Czechia and Slovakia would become German dominions.\r\nEverything possible must be taken out. The Oder-Danube Canal has to be\r\nspeeded up. Searches for oil and ore have to be conducted in Slovakia,\r\nnotably by State Secretary Keppler.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of his discussion General Field Marshal Goering took\r\nup the Jewish problem. The Jewish problem had to be tackled now with\r\nall methods, because they have to get out of the economy. However,\r\nthe wild bustle of commissars as it developed in Austria has to be\r\nprevented under all circumstances. These wild actions have to cease\r\nand the settling of the Jewish problem should not be regarded as a\r\nsystem of providing for inefficient party members. Thereupon Ministry\r\nCouncillor Fischboeck was allowed to speak. He revealed that in the\r\nbeginning there were 25,000 commissars in Austria. Today there are\r\nstill 3,500 who are useless almost without exception. In Austria the\r\nparty is of the opinion that Aryanization is a duty of the party and\r\nthat it is connected with the recompensation of the old party members.\r\n\r\nIn Austria there is still a total of 2 billions of Jewish property.\r\nThe large enterprises are being bought up by the Control Bank; it is\r\ndifficult to oust the Jews from the small industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nGeneral Field Marshal Goering took a strong stand against the opinion\r\nthat the Aryanization is the duty of the party. It is the duty of\r\nthe State alone. However, he could not release foreign exchange for\r\nshipping away the Jews. In an emergency situation ghettos should be\r\nerected in the individual large cities.\r\n\r\nState Councillor Schmeer cautioned against more lenient methods in the\r\nfight against the Jews; Jewish labor units should be established, then\r\nthe people would emigrate of their own accord. State Councillor Neumann\r\nwarned and expressed the opinion that one should use more precaution in\r\nthis matter, particularly in Austria.\r\n\r\nThereupon the meeting was quite surprisingly closed by General Field\r\nMarshal Goering without recording the minutes of the meeting or making\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n  HG.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Material for the Conference with Goering on 25 Nov 1938 (General\r\n Keitel, Brig. Gen. Thomas)\r\n\r\n  27 Oct 1938\r\n  W.Wi Id.\r\n\r\nFor the consideration of the assignment of tasks to people, state\r\nand the Armed Forces, judging of the requirements of raw materials,\r\nespecially steel, appears necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is shown as follows, as far as it can be judged from here. The\r\ninclosed summary shows that one must count, according to the Fuehrer's\r\ndirectives, on a steel requirement for armament production, which\r\namounts to 1.08 million tons monthly from 1 Jan 1939 on, that is, it\r\nmust be increased by about 48% of the present contingent. Added to\r\nthis requirement are the increased demands of the Four Years' Plan,\r\nthe demands of export and the amount necessary for the upkeep of the\r\nproduction machine of German economy in the amount of 1.83 million tons\r\nmonthly from 1 Jan 1939 on; thus this results in a total requirement\r\nof 2.9 million tons monthly from 1 Jan 1939 on, against which there is\r\nonly a monthly production of at present 1.8 million tons monthly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it must be pointed out, that with the increased use of\r\nsteel, an increased use of the already scarce non-ferrous metals is\r\nnecessarily coupled; the latter also are closely associated with the\r\nprocurement of foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nThe increased rearmament of the armed forces must further affect deeply\r\nthe supply requirements of the armed forces, especially munitions and\r\nfuels. Therefore, it must be expected that the future requirements of\r\nthe armed forces will exceed the present plans (accelerated program for\r\npowder and explosives, fuel program), which will have an increase of\r\nthe steel requirements not yet planned as result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Secret\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of the Iron and Steel Requirements of the Armed Forces and\r\nIndustry tons per month\r\n\r\n---------------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------\r\n                     |            |            |            |in contrast to\r\n                     | Contingent | Contingent |Requirement |the contingent\r\n                     |of the IVth | of the 1st | from 1 Jan |    of 1st\r\n                     |quarter 1938|quarter 1939|   1939 on  | quarter 1939\r\n---------------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------\r\n                     |            |            |            |\r\nI.

According to the Fuehrer's request.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY\r\n\r\nThe equipping with arms will have first priority, the providing of\r\nammunition and the building of fortifications for the army will be\r\nconsidered in second place only.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY\r\n\r\nThe building of ships, of ports and docks will have first priority over\r\nall other requirements, also over that of providing ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR FORCE\r\n\r\nThe equipping with arms will have first priority, the providing of\r\nammunition will have to be considered in second place only.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, the initiation of new enterprises will have to be\r\ndelayed, the execution of current enterprises and orders will have to\r\nbe distributed over a longer period of time. The allotted quota of raw\r\nmaterials which will be decreased starting 1 Jan 39, will also compel\r\nus to a certain extent to do this. It has to be achieved that\r\n\r\n  in the _Army_\r\n  in the _Navy_\r\n  in the _Air Force_\r\n\r\n during the period from 1 November 1938 to 31 March 1939 (end of the\r\n fiscal year) not more than\r\n\r\n  (_Army_): 3.7 billion RM (used until now 4.9)\r\n  (_Navy_): 650 million RM\r\n  (_Air Force_): 2.5 billion RM\r\n\r\n should be expended in the form of cash and delivery treasury scrips.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet definitely established how much can be allotted for the\r\nnext fiscal year 1939/40 in the form of cash and delivery scrips. At\r\npresent, the branches of the Armed Forces cannot expect greater quotas\r\nthan the following:\r\n\r\n  5.2 billion RM for the Army\r\n  1.4 billion RM for the Navy\r\n  4.9 billion RM for the Air Force\r\n\r\n  signed: Keitel\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  W H\r\n  _58 a 40 38 g K_\r\n  1157/38 g K\r\n  Top Secret\r\n  Copy\r\n  for information\r\n  [illegible signature]\r\n  to\r\n  the Chief of the Air Force\r\n  the Chief of the W Stb\r\n  Chief of the War Industry Staff Adjutant\r\n  1 March 1939\r\n  Draft\r\n  To the adjutant's office of General Field Marshal Goering.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Brig.

The branches of the Armed Forces--particularly the Navy--submitted\r\nrequests for additional amounts of non-ferrous metals and of steel.\r\nGeneral Thomas requests instructions what attitude he should take in\r\nregard to this question during the absence of the General Field Marshal.\r\n\r\n2.

Col. Luther,\r\n  Major v. Gusevius.\r\n\r\n From the Quartermaster General: Major v. Altenstadt, Min. Dir. Sarnow.\r\n\r\n_Major v. a._ develops the idea of the Quartermaster General regarding\r\nthe employment of his organization. The Fuehrer had laid down that he\r\nwould appoint his three commissioners in about four weeks time. Only\r\nthen would he lay down the directives for their activities.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster General thinks it necessary to create a modest\r\neconomic organization in the operational area as well, so as to be\r\nable to supply the needs of the fighting forces. This organization\r\nwould later be replaced by the office of the industrial armaments\r\norganization. This was to a certain extent a measure of self-help by\r\nthe Quartermaster General. He would also employ field-commands, which\r\nwould be manned by individual officials. As soon as the operational\r\narea has moved on, the handing over of large areas has been planned. At\r\nthis time the Quartermaster General's organizations will be withdrawn\r\nand their tasks will be taken over by the industrial armaments\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nRegarding the present organization of the areas he mentioned the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  _Operational Area_: Army area\r\n  Rear area of the Army\r\n  _Political Area_: in which the Wehrmacht commanders\r\n  operate.\r\n\r\nIn the rear area of the army, the Reichsleader of the SS is first of\r\nall responsible for the entire control, except for the economic field.\r\nThe Wehrmacht commanders are made responsible for the exploitation of\r\nthe country's industry. According to the general interpretation, this\r\nonly means a utilization \"for purposes of the Wehrmacht\". Quartermaster\r\nGeneral makes the following proposal:\r\n\r\nThe department IV-Wi at Army Commands will be enlarged, so that they\r\nare able to direct industry in the operational area. For this purpose\r\nthe V.O. are to be strengthened by suitable personnel who can be\r\nemployed in the spheres of banking, customs and finance.\r\n\r\nOKW/industrial armaments department will put its demands to\r\nQuartermaster General. Quartermaster General will pass these demands in\r\nthe form of an order to the V.O. at Army Commands. The IV Wi will of\r\ncourse receive the technical instructions from Industrial Armaments\r\nthrough the official channels, just as Industrial Armaments is also\r\nproviding the organization in the form of IV Wi.\r\n\r\nThe proposal meets with general approval.\r\n\r\nWith regard to basic directives the representative of the Quartermaster\r\nGeneral mentions:\r\n\r\nEach army is followed by a security division. For reasons of expediency\r\nthe industrial armaments commands in the beginning will be attached\r\nto these security divisions. As soon as operations have made further\r\nprogress, the industrial armaments commands will come under the\r\nWehrmacht commanders.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster General thinks it expedient, that the industrial\r\narmament Staff should be near to or actually with the Quartermaster\r\nGeneral whilst operations are in progress. Only thus can it be\r\nguaranteed that the Industrial Armament Staff is kept informed of the\r\nprogress of the operations as a whole, and of the intentions of the\r\nleadership. As soon as operations cease, the Industrial Armaments Staff\r\nwill join the Industrial Armaments Department, as the inspectorates\r\n(with the Reich Commissioners) will then be operating as their economic\r\ndepartment. The main activity of the Industrial Armaments Staff will\r\nthen be properly in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe Quartermaster General does not intend to create a Quartermaster\r\nGeneral organization for the East. He will attach a General Staff\r\nOfficer as representative to each Army Group. The Quartermaster General\r\nintends to go forward in person.\r\n\r\n_Min. Dir. Sarnow_ mentions that there is in existence an agricultural\r\natlas of Russia which contains the latest information about all tractor\r\nstations. This atlas is in the possession of Secretary of State Backe.\r\nAcquaintance with this atlas is of the greatest importance for the V.O.\r\nand the industrial armaments commands. General Thomas orders that this\r\natlas be obtained. On the basis of this publication the Quartermaster\r\nGeneral is to receive information on how to supply the fighting forces\r\nwith circulars containing detailed instructions regarding the armaments\r\ndepartment to provide the Quartermaster General with the contributions\r\nrequired for compiling these circulars for the fighting forces. The\r\nQuartermaster General's representative mentions that it is intended to\r\nattach suitable individuals for the securing of these tractor stations\r\nto the armoured divisions.\r\n\r\nIn these circulars the primary demand made on the fighting forces will\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n a. Securing of all supplies found.\r\n\r\n b. Safeguarding of all tractors and fuel in stock.\r\n\r\n_Quartermaster General_ states that Admiral Canaris has drawn up\r\na list of reliable people with detailed knowledge of the locality\r\nand industry, who are to be employed immediately on entry. For the\r\noccupation of East-Galicia, special oil-detachments are to be provided,\r\nwhere possible from the present West-Galicia, to take over supervision\r\nof the oil installations in the district of Lemberg immediately.\r\n\r\n _The Chief of the department_ sums up:\r\n\r\n1. The most urgent task is the strengthening of IV Wi. The staff of the\r\nindustrial armaments command takes over the responsibility for this.\r\n\r\n2. In the rear of the army area it is the intention to appoint a\r\ncommanding general in the area of each Army Command, under whose\r\ncommand the security divisions will also be placed. Here in the\r\nindustrial armaments commands are to be introduced and attached to\r\nthe security divisions. As soon as this rear army area passes into\r\nthe political area, the armament commands, or the industrial armament\r\ninspectorates, will come under the command of the Wehrmacht Commander.\r\n\r\n3. The Reich Commissioners take over political administration in the\r\nso-called political area.\r\n\r\n4. The inspectorates and industrial armaments commands furthest to\r\nthe rear (western) must be the first to be employed, i.e., must be in\r\nfront. They are the first to reach their final areas.\r\n\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  _1st. copy_\r\n  _2nd. copy_\r\n  Staff of the Industrial Armaments Department\r\n  Working Committee Oldenburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1317-PS\r\n\r\n  Rue Ic\r\n  Berlin, March 1, 1941\r\n  [stamp] TOP SECRET\r\n  5 copies, 1st copy\r\n  _Re_: _Oldenburg_\r\n  Memorandum\r\n\r\n _Conference at Office Chief, General of the Infantry Thomas on\r\n February 28, 1941_\r\n\r\n  _Present_: General of the Infantry Thomas\r\n  Colonel Becht\r\n  Lt.

Matzky\r\n  Major von Gusevius\r\n  Major von Payr\r\n  Major Huch\r\n  Captain Emmerich\r\n  Captain Dr. Hamann\r\n\r\nThe general ordered that a broader plan of organization be drafted for\r\nthe Reich Marshal.\r\n\r\nEssential Points:\r\n\r\n1. The whole organization to be subordinate to the Reich Marshal.\r\n_Purpose_: Support and extension of the measures of the four-year plan.\r\n\r\n2. The organization must include everything concerning war economy,\r\nexcepting only food, which is said to be made already a special mission\r\nof State Secretary Backe.\r\n\r\n3. Clear statement that _the organization is to be independent of the\r\nmilitary or civil administration_. Close cooperation, but instructions\r\ndirect from the central office in Berlin.\r\n\r\n4. Scope of activities to be divided in two steps:\r\n\r\n a. Accompanying the advancing troops directly behind the front lines,\r\n in order to avoid the destruction of supplies and to secure the\r\n removal of important goods.\r\n\r\n b. Administration of the occupied industrial districts and\r\n exploitation of economically complimentary districts.\r\n\r\n5. In view of the extended field of activity, the term _war economy_\r\ninspection is to be used preferably, instead of armament inspection.\r\n\r\n6. In view of the great field of activity, the organization must be\r\ngenerously equipped and personnel must be correspondingly numerous.\r\n\r\n_The main mission of the organization_ will consist of _seizing raw\r\nmaterials_ and _taking over all important concerns_. For the latter\r\nmission reliable persons from German concerns will be interposed\r\nsuitably from the beginning, since successful operation from the\r\nbeginning can only be performed by the aid of their experiences (for\r\nexample, lignite, ore, chemistry, petroleum).\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion of further details, Lt. Col. Luther was instructed\r\nto make an initial draft of such an organization within one week.\r\n\r\nClose cooperation with the individual sections in the building is\r\nessential. An Officer must still be appointed for Wi. and Ro, with whom\r\nthe operational staff can remain in constant contact. Wi is to give\r\neach section chief and Lt. Col. Luther a copy of the new plan regarding\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMajor General Schubert is to be asked to be in Berlin the second half\r\nof next week. Also, the 4 officers who are ordered to draw up the\r\nindividual armament inspections are to report to the Office Chief at\r\nthe end of next week.\r\n\r\n  (signed) Hamann\r\n  _Distribution_:\r\n  Staff 1st Copy\r\n  Rue 2nd Copy\r\n  Lt.

Rations.\r\n\r\nJews will no longer receive the following foods, beginning with the\r\n42nd distribution period (19 October 1942): meat, meat products, eggs,\r\nwheat products (cake, white bread, wheat rolls, wheat flour, etc)\r\nwhole milk, fresh skimmed milk, as well as such foods are distributed\r\nnot on food ration cards issued uniformly throughout the Reich but on\r\nlocal supply certificates or by special announcement of the nutrition\r\noffices on extra coupons of the food cards. Jewish children and young\r\npeople over 10 years of age will receive the bread ration of the normal\r\nconsumer. Jewish children and young people over 6 years of age will\r\nreceive the fat ration of the normal consumer, no honey substitute and\r\nno cocoa powder, and they will not receive the supplement of marmalade\r\naccorded the age classes of 6 to 14 years. Jewish children up to 6\r\nyears receive 1/2 liter of fresh skimmed milk daily.\r\n\r\nAccordingly no meat, egg or milk cards and no local supply certificates\r\nshall be issued to Jews. Jewish children and young people over 10 years\r\nof age will receive the bread cards and those over 6 years of age the\r\nfat cards of the normal consumer. The bread cards issued to Jews will\r\nentitle them to rye flour products only. Jewish children under 6 years\r\nof age shall be issued the supply certificate for fresh skimmed milk.\r\n\"Good for 1/2 liter daily\" shall be noted on it.\r\n\r\nJews cannot be self-providers in the sense of any decrees.\r\n\r\n3. Regulation for sick persons, etc.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for sick and infirm persons, expectant and nursing\r\nmothers and women in childbed do not apply to Jews.\r\n\r\nThe regulations of this decree apply also to Jewish inmates of\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n4. Special allotments.\r\n\r\nJews are excluded from special allotments.\r\n\r\n5. Exchange of food cards for travel and restaurant coupons.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of food cards for travel and restaurant coupons may be\r\nallowed to Jews only in urgent exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n6. Ration-free food.\r\n\r\nFor the purchase of non-rationed food the Jews are not subject to\r\nrestrictions as long as these products are available to the Aryan\r\npopulation in sufficient quantities. Ration-free foods which are\r\ndistributed only from time to time and in limited quantities, such as\r\nvegetable and herring salad, fish paste, etc., are not to be given to\r\nJews. The nutrition offices are authorized to permit Jews to purchase\r\nturnips, plain kind of cabbage etc.\r\n\r\n7. Marking of ration cards.\r\n\r\nRation cards issued to Jews shall be printed over diagonally (i.e.\r\nover all individual coupons) with the repeated over-print \"Jew\". A\r\ncolor in contrast to the basic color of the cards shall be chosen for\r\nthis. Cards and coupons overprinted \"Jew\" do not entitle the bearer to\r\nspecial allotments. Cancellation of these coupons before issue of the\r\ncards is therefore not necessary.\r\n\r\n8. Special shopping time for Jews.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid inconveniences in the supply of the Aryan population,\r\nit is recommended that the nutrition authorities establish special\r\nshopping times for Jews.\r\n\r\n9. Food gift parcels for Jews.\r\n\r\nThe nutrition offices have to charge in full against the rations of the\r\nreceived all gift food parcels from abroad addressed to Jews. Should it\r\nbe products which are rationed but not regularly distributed (such as\r\ncoffee, cocoa, tea, etc.) the entire shipment or in case of a delayed\r\nreport on the receipt of the package, the still unused part--will be\r\nmade available to big consumers, such as hospitals and will be charged\r\nagainst their rations.\r\n\r\nIn the decree of 29 April 1941, of which a copy is enclosed, the Reich\r\nMinister of Finance instructed the Customs Offices to report weekly to\r\nthe competent nutrition offices all gift packages, regardless of the\r\nquantity of the incoming merchandise, when it is known or can suspect\r\nthat the receiver is a Jew. In case the report of the Customs Office\r\nto the nutrition office is delayed until the food received in the gift\r\npackage is consumed, it can still be charged against their rations.\r\n\r\nInsofar as the State Police Offices are informed of these food parcels\r\nfrom abroad addressed to Jews, they will secure the packages and put\r\nthem at the disposal of the nutrition offices [Ernaehrungs-Aemter].\r\n\r\n  For the Secretary of State Reicke\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1352-PS\r\n\r\n  COPY\r\n\r\n The Leader of the Central Landoffice for the Reichfuehrer SS\r\n\r\n Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of German Nationalism\r\n\r\n  Berlin NW7, May 29, 1940\r\n  Friedrichstrasse 110-112\r\n  Tel. 42 38 62\r\n  _Az. K Al_\r\n\r\n Subject: Report on the confiscations in the Bielitz District of May\r\n 22, 1940\r\n\r\n Ref: Your letter of May 22, 1940, Br./Schl. to the Silesian Land Office\r\n\r\n _Kattowitz_ Bernhardstrasse 49\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly pointed out to you that the Land Office is to concern\r\nitself exclusively with the tasks outlined in the Service Directive\r\nof Feb. 1, 1940. In accordance with this, the Land Office, in the\r\ncase under discussion, is also to restrict itself to the seizure and\r\nproposal for confiscation of Polish or Jewish private agriculture\r\nenterprises that are needed in consequence of the construction of\r\nthe concentration camp. I forbid you any participation in measures\r\ngoing beyond this and their preparation, such as, more or less, the\r\nevacuation, management or reoccupation of the enterprises concerned\r\nas well as the accommodation elsewhere of the Polish farm owners. In\r\nthe same way, the Land Office is to do nothing further regarding the\r\nBielitz district villages named in the report than to undertake the\r\nseizure of the Polish and Jewish agriculture enterprises and to propose\r\ntheir confiscation to the State Police. Arrangements which according to\r\nthe Land Office report have been found too sweeping are in every case\r\nto be revoked immediately, in consideration of their invalidity I again\r\npoint out that as against the other Land Offices, the Silesian Land\r\nOffice has the poorest results to show in connection with seizures.\r\n\r\n  Signed: W Baron von Holzschuher,\r\n  SS Group Leader\r\n  Certified a true copy\r\n  Signed: signature\r\n  Administrative Leader.

He said that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to confiscate the agriculture enterprises within a certain\r\narea around the concentration camp, since not only the fields but also\r\nthe farm houses of these border directly on the concentration camp. A\r\nlocal inspection held on the 21st of this month revealed the following:\r\nThere is no room for doubt that the agriculture enterprises bordering\r\non the concentration camp must be confiscated at once. Further than\r\nthis, the camp commandant requests that further plots of farm land be\r\nplaced at his disposal, so that he can keep the prisoners busy. This\r\ntoo can be done without further delay since enough land can be made\r\navailable for the purpose. The owners of the plots are all Poles.\r\n\r\nThe following agreements have been reached by me with the Camp\r\nCommandant and the proper measures prepared. The Director of the Branch\r\nagency in Bielitz will immediately determine the names of the Polish\r\nfarmers and will also divide the land to be confiscated into zones.\r\n\r\nZone 1. Enterprises whose plots border directly on the camp.\r\n\r\nZone 2. Agricultural plots with enterprises which are placed at the\r\ndisposal of the camp for the employment of the prisoners, namely for\r\nabout 2000 prisoners for the time being.\r\n\r\nZone 3. As in zone 2, with the only difference, that the number of\r\nprisoners has increased considerably. Zones 4 and 5 follow them. In the\r\nlast case it must be determined to what extent it is possible to put\r\nthat kind of terrain at the disposal of the camp. The result for Zone I\r\nmust be known within a few days, in order to enable the Land office in\r\nKattowitz to start the confiscation procedures. It will be necessary to\r\nstate the size of the families whose enterprises have been confiscated,\r\neven giving age and sex.\r\n\r\nI had the following discussion with the head of the labor-office in\r\nBielitz.\r\n\r\nThe lack of agricultural laborers still exists in the old Reich.\r\nThe transfer of the previous owners of the confiscated enterprises,\r\ntogether with their entire families, to the Reich is possible without\r\nany further consideration. It is only necessary for the labor office to\r\nreceive the lists of the persons in time, in order to enable it to take\r\nthe necessary steps (collection of transportation, distribution over\r\nthe various regions in need of such labor). Furniture cannot be taken\r\nalong under any circumstances in the course of the confiscation, the\r\nonly things left to the Poles, were, anyway, only the most vital items,\r\nlike bedding, ample food, clothes and other such things.\r\n\r\nIf the confiscation takes place the Poles will be billeted by the labor\r\noffice in barracks, put at its disposal by the camp commandant, until\r\ntheir deportation. The deportation of the Poles of further zones will\r\nfollow along the same lines.\r\n\r\nThis matter has already been discussed in its outlines with the\r\nagricultural management (Ruppert). A farmer will be appointed by\r\nthe Association of Agricultural Management, who will supervise the\r\nagricultural labor of the prisoners at the agricultural enterprises and\r\nwho, naturally, will carry the sole responsibility for the agricultural\r\nmeasures, which he alone determines.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the preparatory measures are finished, a meeting will\r\nbe called on the spot, next week, with the participation of the\r\nagricultural management, in order to clear up and determine completely\r\neverything that might be necessary. The chief of the Branch Agency\r\nBielitz has been ordered to report on Thursday the 23rd of this month\r\nto this office, in order to receive the necessary instructions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have reached the following agreement with the camp\r\ncommandant: As there are a number of villages in the district of\r\nBielitz, which contain racial-German [Volksdeutsche] farmers, the\r\nexisting Poles must be sheltered in those villages in the very\r\nnear future as quickly as possible, in order to realize a quick\r\nconsolidation of German folkdom [Volkstume]. The Poles of the\r\nconfiscated enterprises are taken by the concentration camps then, but\r\nnot as prisoners [Haeftlinge], rather until the Labor Office Bielitz\r\nhas turned them over to the Reich as farm laborers.\r\n\r\nThe following villages are to be considered for the time being: Alzen,\r\nErnstdorf, Batzdorf, Lomnitz.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken with the mayor of Alzen, and he will collect all\r\nthe Poles who possess agricultural property by Saturday, 25th of this\r\nmonth, and submit the list to the Branch Agency Bielitz. The Chief of\r\nthe Branch Agency Bielitz is requested to get that list personally.\r\n\r\nThe confiscation of those Polish enterprises in Alzen will also\r\nbe carried out within the next few days. The Commandant of the\r\nConcentration camp will furnish SS-men and a truck for the execution of\r\nthe action. Should it not yet be possible to take the Poles from Alzen\r\nto Auschwitz, they should be transferred to the empty castle at Zator.\r\n\r\nThe liberated Polish property is to be given to the needy racial-German\r\nfarmers for their use. The Chief of the Branch Agency must therefore\r\non Saturday determine, in cooperation with the local authorities, the\r\nGermans who can be taken into consideration for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe list of the Poles to be turned over to the Reich for agricultural\r\nlabor is to be handed over to the labor office Bielitz, as quickly as\r\npossible. Care is to be taken that the size of the family, etc, is\r\nalso indicated. The Poles in the other German villages of the district\r\nBielitz, are to be determined in the same manner, in cooperation with\r\nthe various mayors, in order to enable the office here to prepare\r\nthe confiscation as quickly as possible. The execution of these\r\nmeasures naturally takes place simultaneously with those at Auschwitz.\r\nA discussion with the district-leader, the district head-farmers\r\nof the association of agricultural management for Eastern Germany\r\n[Kreislandwirt der Ostdeutschen landbewirtschaftungs-Gesellschaft] must\r\nof course, take place, before those measures are carried out.\r\n\r\n  signed: KUSCHE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ku/Ni\r\n  CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\n _Report Re_: Achievement of confiscations of Polish agricultural\r\n enterprises with the purpose to transfer the Poles to the Old Reich\r\n and to employ them as agricultural workers.\r\n\r\nIn the Old Reich again and again the complaint can be heard that a\r\nshortage of agricultural workers exists, and that it cannot be remedied\r\nby any means though Polish farm-workers have been placed at disposal.\r\nThe employment offices have informed farmers and owners of estates who\r\nare looking for workers that it was difficult to get any workers at all\r\nfrom Poland, that the recruiting in the Government-General and also in\r\nthe Eastern territory was initiated and the Poles who had applied were\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, the Country Farmers Leader from Neutitschein called\r\non our Office and told us that in his district many lands were still\r\nnot yet tilled because there is a lack of any workers. The Reich Food\r\nEstate has decreed that everyone can procure himself Polish workers in\r\nthe Eastern territory or in the Government General.\r\n\r\nThis appears preposterous if one knows that the office of the Higher\r\nSS and Police leader as deputy of the Reich commissar for the\r\nstrengthening of German nationality, Land Office Silesia, cannot\r\nperform the confiscations of small and even very small agricultural\r\nenterprises for the reason that we do not know where to put the former\r\nPolish owners. Until now the work regarding the confiscation of Polish\r\nsmall farms has been limited to racial-German villages. I have already\r\nreported on this matter for the county of Blachownia as well as for\r\nthe county of Bielitz-Biala, in connection with the institution of a\r\nconcentration camp in Auschwitz.\r\n\r\nI have made an arrangement with the Chief of an employment agency\r\nto transfer at once for employment into the Old Reich such Poles as\r\nagricultural workers who are designated by us.\r\n\r\nIt is possible without difficulty to accomplish the confiscation\r\nof small agricultural enterprises in the villages in which larger\r\nagricultural enterprises have been already confiscated and are under\r\nthe management of the East German Corporation for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment. For it is by no means difficult for the larger\r\nagricultural estate to manage a few hundred acres, of course consistent\r\nwith its own character without any particular additional expenses. It\r\nis a matter of course that above all Polish arable lands adjacent to\r\nthe land of the estate should be confiscated and added to the estate\r\nfor exploitation. Agricultural-technical or other difficulties by no\r\nmeans can occur. _The former owners of Polish farms together with\r\ntheir families will be transferred to the Old Reich by the employment\r\nagencies for employment as farm-workers._\r\n\r\nIn this way many hundred Polish agricultural workers can be placed\r\nat the disposal of agriculture in the Old Reich in the shortest and\r\nsimplest manner. This way the most pressing shortage is removed that\r\nis now in a very disagreeable manner felt especially in the root-crop\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nBesides, the settlers who are still working in the confiscated and\r\nformerly settled enterprises and who are superfluous are to be removed\r\ninto the Old Reich, for until now they were only a burden for the\r\nrespective enterprise if they are too numerous. In this way, Polish\r\nagricultural workers can be made free for the Old Reich.\r\n\r\nThe confiscations of small enterprises already achieved together with\r\nthe following transfer of the farmer owners as agricultural workers\r\nto the larger estates already in operation have not only brought\r\nexperience but have proved unequivocably that no difficulties are to be\r\nexpected. The measures themselves are only a matter of organization,\r\nand the success of the measures as proposed by me is based on the good\r\nwill of cooperation of the other authorities with the office of the\r\nReich Fuehrer-SS as Reich Commissioner for the strengthening of German\r\nfolkdom. Means of transportation to the railroad can be provided\r\n\r\n 1. by the enterprises of the East-German Corporation of Agricultural\r\n Development\r\n\r\n 2. by the SS NCO school in Lublinitz and the Concentration Camp of\r\n Auschwitz.\r\n\r\nThese two latter places will also detail the necessary SS-men for\r\nthe day of the confiscation etc. In case that a place of assembly is\r\nnecessary for the Polish land-workers who are to be transported into\r\nthe Reich, for there too sufficient rooms and lodgings can be provided\r\n(Kaminiek, Zator Castle, barracks in Auschwitz).\r\n\r\nI have already reported on the accomplishment of confiscations in\r\nBielitz county and initiated the necessary measures.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of accomplishing further measures proposed by me which\r\nenvision particularly the supplying of the farms in the Reich with\r\nPolish agricultural workers, ask that I be given your consent and the\r\nnecessary full authority.\r\n\r\n  (signed) Kusche\r\n  5/22/40.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Kattowitz, 16 May 1940.\r\n  Ku/Ni.\r\n  CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\n Report on the accomplishment of confiscations of agricultural\r\n enterprises in Blachownia County.\r\n\r\nWith the scope of responsibility of the Higher SS--and Police leaders\r\nas the deputy of the Reichs Commissar for the strengthening of German\r\nnationality, Land officer Silesia, a survey was made in Blachownia\r\nCounty since the beginning of April as to how far confiscations of\r\nagricultural enterprises in Polish ownership could be accomplished.\r\n\r\nBefore the outbreak of the war the present county of Blachownia was\r\na part of Czestachowa County (before 1941 this territory belonged\r\nto Russian Poland). Only recently, it was decided to incorporate the\r\npresent county area of Blachownia County into the district of Oppeln.\r\nBlachownia is a rather big market-place which in Polish times was even\r\ncalled a Spa.\r\n\r\nAs the necessary preparations can be considered closed in the following\r\na short survey on the general conditions shall be given as far as they\r\nare at present of interest and importance.\r\n\r\nAt first, contact was made by the Chief of the local agency of the Land\r\nOffice in Lublinitz, with the local authorities of the Party, the State\r\nsuch as the East German Corporation for Agricultural Development and\r\nthe Secret State Police, and after a thorough exposition of the aims\r\nof the Land Office, excellent state of agreement was reached. Before\r\nthis the Land Office of Kattowitz had discussions in the same direction\r\nregarding the Blachownia County with the higher authorities of the\r\nParty and the State District Governor [Regierungspresident], Provincial\r\nGovernor [Oberpresident], Gauleitung.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the local agency at Lublinitz had found out that a number\r\nof villages exist in Blachownia County the inhabitants of which belong\r\nfor the greatest part to the German nationality and that particularly\r\nin recent years the Polish nationality strongly penetrated into these\r\nsmall ethnic German islands.\r\n\r\nBlachownia County comprises about 133,000 inhabitants. Of these, 2,000\r\ncan be considered without further ado as ethnic Germans. The number of\r\nJews is estimated at 6,000. 260 villages are combined in 15 greater\r\ncommunities. In 3 of such greater communities to which also the German\r\nvillages belong, racial German mayors are in office.\r\n\r\n 1. The greater community Lipie: Mayor Mueller, comprising the\r\n racial-German villages of Haukow, Lindow, Natalin and Rosalin,\r\n\r\n 2. The greater community Scharny-Las: Mayor Lorenz, comprising the\r\n racial-German villages of Schwarzwald,\r\n\r\n 3. The greater community Wrozosowa: Mayor Neugebauer, comprising the\r\n racial-German village of Alt-Hutau.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the communities are Polish throughout and have still an\r\nalmost pure Polish administration.\r\n\r\n To 1. In greater Lipie 20 of the 23 villages are destroyed up to\r\n 80%. The ethnic-German families are living in the most primitive\r\n conditions, closely compressed into the few dwelling-houses still\r\n remaining or into other poorly prepared shelters consisting of\r\n destroyed houses even in holes in the ground. The German villages\r\n mentioned were founded about 80 years ago by Germans who came mostly\r\n from Middle-Silesia (Strehlen, district of Breslau). By hard work they\r\n have cleared the woods and created farms.\r\n\r\n To 2. The Germans of this village immigrated about 100 years ago from\r\n the region of Frankfort on Main and have built up by their own work\r\n their economic basis of life.\r\n\r\n To 3. In Alt-Hutau, it is a question above all, of Sudeten\r\n German-weavers, who immigrated in 1812 from Maehrisch-Truebau. Because\r\n of shortage of raw materials for several months the looms have been\r\n idle, so that, on account of the cessation of this so necessary\r\n opportunity for additional income, the economic situation of these\r\n ethnic-Germans is endangered.\r\n\r\nIn course of time, of course, the Poles also have intruded into these\r\nGerman settlements with the purpose at first to weaken Germanism in\r\nits economic existence and finally to drive it out. The agricultural\r\nenterprises of the racial-Germans have sizes from 1-1/2 to 5 hectares.\r\nIn all probability the enterprises have become so small due to\r\npartitioning and above all to economic pressure from the former Polish\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nBy the quick advance of the German troops a terrible massacre of the\r\nethnic Germans by the Poles of the Polish soldiery has been prevented.\r\nBefore the outbreak of the war, the Poles in these German settlements\r\nbehaved very aggressively against the German nationality and everything\r\nwas made ready for its destruction during the disorders of war. Even\r\nif at the present moment the Poles have become a little more quiet\r\nit appears that it concerns only outward appearances. Therefore, it\r\nis absolutely necessary to bring about a strengthening of the German\r\nnationality in the small far advanced German linguistic islands. These\r\nethnic-Germans make the best impressions. For whole decades they have\r\nnot abandoned their German national culture despite terror and so on,\r\nbut have confessed firmly and resolutely. Thus for example, the present\r\nMayor Mueller of Natalin has given to German children during the Polish\r\ntimes lessons in reading and writing on Saturday and Sunday because a\r\nschool for the German minority did not exist. The ethnic-Germans and\r\nabove all the youth know the German language not only orally but even\r\nby the written word.\r\n\r\nIn order to break down the Polish nationality most quickly in the\r\nGerman villages, the Polish agricultural enterprises were confiscated.\r\nTherewith it has to be remarked further that also Polish enterprises\r\nwere destroyed by warfare and the Poles too are partly in a situation\r\nwhich gives grounds for fear in so far that theft of German property\r\nand other encroachments on the part of the Poles may occur. The\r\nconfiscation was done in accordance with the directives of Reich\r\nFuehrer-SS as Reich Commissioner for the strengthening of German\r\nnationality, on 9 May in the villages of Natalin and Rosalin. As the\r\nPolish enterprises were from 2 to about 8 hectares in size and the\r\narable land and the farm-buildings are dispersed within the area. The\r\nCounty agronomist [Kreislandwirt] of the East-German Agricultural\r\nDevelopment Corporation thought that a centralized management of\r\nthe confiscated farms by appointment of a manager was impractical.\r\nHe resolved therefore to give the arable land, livestock and other\r\nproperty to the trusteeship of needy racial-Germans. The agronomist\r\nwho was present at the performance of the confiscation accomplished\r\nthis at once on the spot. However he thought it necessary to take the\r\nformer Polish owners as farm-workers to an estate in Blachownia County\r\nwhich is also managed by the East-German Agricultural Development\r\nCorporation, in order to enable the racial-Germans installed to run\r\nthe Polish enterprises without friction. Today in fact farm-workers\r\nare lacking here, for the former workers were Jews and are useless for\r\nsuch work and moreover, they would endanger an orderly management.\r\nHowever, if the Poles would remain on their former farms the danger\r\nof the worst sort of sabotage to the agricultural property now at the\r\ndisposal of the German Reich would exist. The Poles are paid for their\r\nwork. The execution of the confiscation as well as the transfer of\r\nthe Polish farm-workers to the estate of the East-German Corporation\r\nfor Agriculture Management was accomplished quite quietly and without\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nIn the same way as it was done until now the break-up of Polish\r\nNationality will be shortly accomplished in the other racial-German\r\nvillages as well.\r\n\r\nBecause of the extremely good cooperation with the authorities,\r\nthe party offices and the East German Corporation for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment, and above all with the Secret State Police the\r\nconfiscations etc. will be accomplished absolutely without friction in\r\nthe future, as well especially as preparations of greatest minuteness\r\nwill secure the success from the outset.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of June the soil in the ethnic-German villages of\r\nBlachownia County will be taken entirely from Polish hands and be\r\nconfiscated for the German Reich at the disposal of Reich Fuehrer-SS as\r\nReich Commissioner for the strengthening of German Nationality.\r\n\r\n  (signed) Kusche\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1366-PS\r\n\r\n [Secret Decree of Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery\r\n Lammers of 29 August 1943, RK. 99 MD]\r\n\r\n BUDGET OF THE REICH PROTECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1944\r\n\r\n Introduction\r\n\r\n * * *\r\n\r\nThe Fuehrer has modified the position, duties and authorities of the\r\nReich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia upon the appointment of the\r\nnew Reich Protector.

In view of the present requirements of the Reich for the defense\r\nindustry, it is at present fundamentally impossible to carry on a\r\nlong-term economic policy in the General gouvernement. Rather, it is\r\nnecessary so to steer the economy of the General gouvernement that it\r\nwill, in the shortest possible time, accomplish results representing\r\nthe maximum that can be gotten out of the economic strength of the\r\nGeneral gouvernement for the immediate strengthening of our capacity\r\nfor defense.\r\n\r\n2. In particular the following performances are expected of the total\r\neconomy of the General gouvernement:\r\n\r\na. Intensification of agricultural production esp. in the larger farms\r\n(above 100 ha.) and a planned distribution of the food-stuffs to be\r\nrequisitioned in order to fill the requirements of the troops, units,\r\nand service agencies as well as of the native population, which are not\r\nyet fully covered by the present production.\r\n\r\nb. Fullest exploitation of the forests, in temporary disregard of\r\nforest conservation principles, so as to deliver to the Reich approx.\r\n1 million fm sawmill lumber, 1. 2 million fm of mine timbers and up to\r\n0.4 million rm of fiber wood.\r\n\r\nc. Stepping-up of the raw material production in the industrial\r\nsector, in particular: in the extraction of iron ores and pyrites in\r\norder to cover the local needs of the smelting plants operated in the\r\nGeneral gouvernement; in petroleum extraction; in order to cover the\r\nmilitarily most important requirements of the General gouvernement\r\nand to export the greatest possible quantities to the Reich; in the\r\nchemical industry (nitrogen, phosphate) to provide for the fertilizer\r\nrequirements of agriculture in so far as they can be covered in the\r\nGeneral gouvernement;\r\n\r\nd. Exploitation, if necessary also partial expansion, of the industrial\r\ncapacity existing in the General gouvernement, in order to execute as\r\nrapidly as possible the Wehrmacht orders to be placed by the Reich in\r\nthe General gouvernement while maintaining production of those products\r\nwhich are absolutely vital for the running of the economic machinery in\r\nthe General gouvernement even if the strictest standards are applied;\r\n\r\ne. Maintenance of the productive capacity of those plants to which\r\nWehrmacht orders have not yet been assigned but which are chosen as\r\nreplacement plants for militarily vital factories which have been or\r\nwill be evacuated in the Reich;\r\n\r\nf. Stripping and scrapping of those plants which have neither been made\r\ninto armament plants nor declared to be replacement plants, as well as\r\nof destroyed buildings;\r\n\r\ng. Supply and transportation of at least 1 million male and female\r\nagricultural and industrial workers to the Reich--among them at least\r\n7500 000 [sic] agricultural workers of which at least 50% must be\r\nwomen--in order to guarantee agricultural production in the Reich and\r\nas a replacement for industrial workers lacking in the Reich.\r\n\r\n3. In order to attain the expected performances, provision is to be\r\nmade:\r\n\r\na. that the organizational measures for increasing agricultural\r\nproduction and for the building up of the live stock, extraordinarily\r\ndepleted by the war, are implemented by the insurance of the seed\r\nand fertilizer supply--if necessary by imports from the Reich--; by\r\nsufficient supplies of agricultural machinery from local production in\r\nthe General gouvernement; by a planned development of the water economy\r\nwhich should be simultaneously designed for the requirements of the\r\nwaterways and of the power supply;\r\n\r\nb. that all uneconomic consumption of wood be avoided and that the\r\nshipment of the quantities to be delivered to the Reich is insured;\r\n\r\nc. that within the framework of the stepping-up of the industrial raw\r\nmaterial production the following are guaranteed: financing through\r\nthe most extensive possible utilization of the credit system existing\r\nin the General gouvernement; procurement of the necessary mining and\r\ndrilling equipment, the supplying of the workers with the food and\r\narticles of clothing absolutely essential for the maintenance of their\r\nfull efficiency; the shipment, especially of mineral oil, to the Reich;\r\n\r\nd. that in engaging the industrial capacity of the General gouvernement\r\nwith armament orders from the Reich the following be coordinated:\r\n\r\n nature and volume of the orders\r\n\r\n location and capacity of the plants\r\n\r\n raw material requirements and coverage the latter as far as possible\r\n out of raw material stocks existing in the General gouvernement--\r\n\r\n requirements and provisioning of workers means of transport for\r\n delivery of materials and dispatch of finished products;\r\n\r\n pre-financing of wages in the General gouvernement and transfer of the\r\n proceeds from the Reich;\r\n\r\ne. that exact investigations be made in order to determine the plants\r\nwhich are either required for filling the armament orders or continue\r\nto work for the supplying of the General gouvernement with absolutely\r\nvital goods, or are being maintained as replacement plants, or are\r\nto be stripped and scrapped; and that the putting into operation or\r\ncontinued operation of the plants be uniformly regulated and made\r\nsubject to permit;\r\n\r\nf. that in order to insure the necessary supply of Polish workers in\r\nthe Reich the labor offices harmonize the recruiting with the labor\r\nrequirements in the General gouvernement; that the shipment will take\r\nplace early enough to be completed in the course of April; that the\r\ntransfer of savings of these workers be regulated who came to the Reich\r\nmerely as migratory workers.\r\n\r\n4. For the uniform orientation of the total economy of the General\r\ngouvernement towards the tasks now to be accomplished the following\r\nadditional measures are to be taken:\r\n\r\na. In the food supply of the population it must under all circumstances\r\nbe seen to it that the persons working in plants vital to life and\r\narmaments will maintain their efficiency while the rest of the\r\npopulation will have to remain restricted to a minimum ration as long\r\nas the food shortage lasts.\r\n\r\nb. Any production which, on the basis of raw materials important for\r\narmament, is directed towards objects which in the framework of the\r\npresent plan are not vital, is to be ruthlessly discontinued in so far\r\nas it will not be possible to switch it over to sufficiently abundant\r\nErsatz materials and other materials (e.g. by producing wooden shoes\r\nwhile simultaneously prohibiting the production of leather shoes and\r\nboots for the native population). For the rest, all raw material saving\r\ndecrees prohibitions of production and shipment and orders valid in the\r\nReich are to be carried through in the Generalgouvernement at least to\r\nthe same degree as is done in the Reich.\r\n\r\nc. The shipment of raw materials to the Reich is to be limited to\r\nthose amounts not absolutely needed in the Generalgouvernement to\r\nguarantee militarily vital production. The right of disposing of the\r\nstocks of raw materials, half-finished and finished goods in the\r\nGeneralgouvernement is reserved to your service agency. For the better\r\nregulation of supply small amounts of valuable raw materials will be\r\nbrought into collection depots from scrapped plants and from smaller\r\ndepots.\r\n\r\nd. The supplying of militarily vital plants with coal and the filling\r\nof the most urgent coal requirements of the population are to be\r\nguaranteed by agreements with the proper Reich agencies.\r\n\r\ne. The collection of leather and old material [Erfassung] and the\r\ngathering of scrap are to be pushed forward according to plan. In view\r\nof the especial conditions in the Generalgouvernement, Jewish dealers\r\nwho can be freed for this purpose from forced service etc., may also be\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nf. A transport plan will be drawn up in agreement with the\r\ntransportation authorities with the object of bringing transport\r\ndesires into line with transport possibilities and to arrive at\r\npriority scale which will then be made the basis of all further\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\ng. Price and wage regulations, currency protection and credit policy\r\nwill be harmonized in closest accord between the agencies concerned\r\nwith the object of creating stable conditions as an indispensable\r\nprerequisite for any economic planning.\r\n\r\nh. In order to gain a conception of the presumable shape of the payment\r\ntransactions between the Reich and the General-gouvernement, a payment\r\nbalance sheet is to be drawn up as soon as it is possible to see to\r\nwhat extent armament orders from the Reich can be filled in the General\r\ngouvernement.\r\n\r\n5.

An information trip also brought him to the\r\n\r\n  Army Area B (Donetz)\r\n  Army Area Don\r\n  Army Area Crimea\r\n  Army Area A (Caucasus)\r\n  into the General Commissariat Dniepropstrovsk\r\n  into several District Commissariats.\r\n\r\nConferences took place with all commanders of these army areas, the\r\nchiefs of staff, the chiefs of the departments VII, the chiefs and\r\nexperts of the economic inspectorates and numerous economic teams and\r\nwith field and local commanders.\r\n\r\nIn the field of civil administration, conversations were held with the\r\ncompetent experts as well.\r\n\r\n_Result: Necessity for our Present Eastern Policy._\r\n\r\n_Reasons_: 1. The military results of the fighting of this year in the\r\nEastern area is the fact that the fighting power of the Bolshevist army\r\nhas not been broken yet. One must count on a prolonged duration of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n2. The size of the occupied territory results in a noticeable lack\r\nof security troops as well as fighting troops. The necessity of the\r\nmilitary commitment of the Slav becomes apparent more and more, whether\r\nit be for the combatting of partisans and in the police service, or\r\nwhether it is for use at the front even as will be necessitated by\r\nfuture developments.\r\n\r\n3. The war economic importance of the Occupied Eastern Territories\r\nincreases with the duration of the war. The last inhabitant of the\r\ncountry, able to work, must be utilized in agriculture or in war\r\neconomic factories. His existence must be assured. Losses of a large\r\nnumber mean damage for the front which cannot be repaired.\r\n\r\n4. As in all great wars of all times, one must also reckon with\r\nmilitary reverses in the East. In retaining our present Eastern policy,\r\nwe stand before the danger that one day the dissatisfaction of the\r\npopulation will find an outlet in a general uprising, whereby the\r\nsupply for the front would be endangered most seriously.\r\n\r\n5. It is the opinion of all military commanders as well as of the\r\nleaders of the civil administrative areas, to whom the reporter\r\nwas able to talk, that the present Eastern policy must undergo a\r\nfundamental change in its basic points.\r\n\r\nThe following are the most important problems:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The Food Problem_\r\n\r\nThe food rations granted to the Russian rural population do not\r\nconstitute the assurance of their existence, but only a vegetating for\r\na limited duration. One can never expect the necessary _cooperation_\r\nfor the Armed Forces from a population who does not know whether it\r\nwill still be alive tomorrow, who thus must expect death by starvation\r\nand who lived in the Bolshevist period--with the exception of the year\r\n1933, with its bad harvest--better than today. The military dangers\r\ndescribed at the beginning increase with the deterioration of the food\r\nbasis; the tendency to support the partisans increases; the desire\r\nto experience again the former Bolshevist conditions comes to the\r\nforeground even in those who refute the system ideologically.\r\n\r\nThe rations allotted at present, which in practice are for the most\r\npart not issued complete, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  (Appendix A 3a)\r\n\r\n_City and Country_: The following food situation prevails: The rural\r\npopulations, although it has to hand over more today than in Bolshevist\r\ntimes, still goes rarely hungry. No matter whether it was in the time\r\nof the Mongol rule, or in Tsarist or Bolshevist times, they were\r\nalways exploited, and they know methods of secreting food items, which\r\nguarantee them food despite of all controls. Today they are even able\r\nto deliver at least the most necessary things to the urban population\r\nthrough the black market. The German administration will never be able\r\nto develop a system which will enable a 100% seizure of products on\r\nRussian territory. The territory is too large for this, and the number\r\nof the appointed agricultural leaders is too small.\r\n\r\nHowever, should one of the periodical bad harvests occur in Southern\r\nRussia within the next years, as last in the year 1933, then the\r\npresent lack of reserves would result in a catastrophe in the Eastern\r\nterritory, the effects of which would be unpredictable for the food\r\nsituation in the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe food question in the Eastern territory today is an _urban\r\nproblem_. As already explained in the beginning, we must free\r\nourselves completely from the attitude which we maintained at the\r\ntime, that there were too many people in the territory, and that their\r\nextermination would mean a blessing to Germans! The German Armed\r\nForces in the East live on the work performance of the cities there.\r\nComplaints about the lack of workers after the execution of the Sauckel\r\naction are common.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to maintain our present attitude, it will be the combat\r\nsoldier who will pay with his blood for this mistake.\r\n\r\nGenerally there is no famine yet in the cities at present. The reporter\r\nwas even able to establish in a city like Kharkov, which had been\r\nembattled to the finish, that the food situation is better than in the\r\npast year. This condition can be traced back to the fact that the\r\nurban population, which for the most part has been living in cities of\r\nindustrial areas for only one or two generations, has relatives in the\r\ncountry by whom it is supplied with food items in exchange for consumer\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nutrition--Nomadic Movement--Utilization of Labor._\r\n\r\nHe who flies over or rides through the occupied Eastern area today will\r\nnotice crowds of people moving along the roads; there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of them, and according to the estimate of experts, their\r\nnumber often may reach a million. These crowds are on the move, either\r\nto look for food, or vice versa, to bring food to the cities in order\r\nto sell it.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of food items/consumer goods, which thereby is reached\r\nbetween city and country, is vital in the cities in view of the food\r\nsupply which is insufficiently controlled by the German administration.\r\nSuggestions to suppress this self-support of the urban population\r\nradically are unbearable, because this would result in starvation of\r\nthe urban population, causing decreased work performance and finally a\r\nrevolutionary attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Working Power_\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, a tremendous amount of valuable working\r\npower is being lost for a certain time to the utilization of labor\r\nthrough the nomadic movement.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion therefore is: _First_ securing of livelihood for the\r\nimportant war economically urban population and their relatives, and\r\n_only then_ suppression of this self-support. But not vice versa.\r\n\r\nBecause of reasons of the utilization of labor therefore, all\r\npreparatory measures must be taken without delay in order to guarantee\r\nsufficient supplies for the urban population of the occupied Eastern\r\nterritory which is important to the war economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Family Problem_\r\n\r\nThis must also include members of the family, because the male Slav\r\nworker like the female Slav worker will starve or practically give\r\nup the food to which they are entitled or even the cooked food which\r\nis being furnished in the factory mess halls, in order to save their\r\nchildren, parents, or other relatives from starvation.\r\n\r\nThe claim, that there are not sufficient food items on hand for this\r\nsubsistence is countered by the fact that by way of the nomadic\r\nmovement into the rural areas and the black market in the cities, food\r\nis supplied which until now has prevented specific signs of starvation\r\non a larger scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Occupied Eastern Area no Surplus Territory._\r\n\r\nDespite this the realization that contrary to propagandistic claims\r\nthe Ukraine as well as the areas of the Caucasus and the remaining\r\nEastern area _are not yet surplus areas at present_, from which Germany\r\nand the rest of Europe could already be fed tomorrow. The truth is\r\nthat the additional subsistence of Western Europe today can only\r\nresult in the risk that the Eastern territory will become refractory\r\ntomorrow as a result of its present delivery quota, which has been\r\nincreased considerably in comparison to the Bolshevist period and that\r\nsimultaneously part of the urban population, which is indispensable for\r\nthe war economic tasks will approach a slow ebbing of strength, if not\r\neven death of starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ukraine Industrial Area without Agricultural Surplus_\r\n\r\nThe large number of publications, which are being distributed at\r\npresent in Germany about the Eastern territory, are copies of obsolete\r\nor uncontrolled figures from Tsarist or Bolshevist times, which lack\r\nany knowledge of fact. As every expert will have to realize, the truth\r\nin the Ukraine is that a situation has been created by the Bolshevist\r\nindustrialization and by the accumulation of giant urban populations in\r\nthe Don- and Donetz areas, which consumed the agricultural surpluses,\r\nwhich were at hand during the Tsarist period for the overwhelming part\r\nin their own territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exchange Trade A Regulator_\r\n\r\nA part of the food of the cities is being procured through the black\r\nmarket, which for the most part is barter trade. First of all it is\r\na regulating factor. In the Bolshevist era the urban population was\r\nbetter supplied with consumer goods because of relatively higher\r\nwages at the expense of the Sochos- and Kolchos peasants. Today these\r\nconsumer goods are wandering to the country as barter goods for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dangers of the Black Market Prohibition._\r\n\r\nThe black market has been completely outlawed in individual area as in\r\nthe Army Area North [XVIII.AOK], in Pleskau and, as the commander of\r\nArmy Area Don has informed the reporter, in Transnistria, which had\r\nbeen ceded by Rumania.\r\n\r\nAll these prohibitions had a completely negative result. The goods\r\ndisappeared from the markets, trading was continued in uncontrollable\r\nbackyards, and the urban population lacked the most important food\r\nitems. With a readmission of the markets, these dangerous symptoms\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n_Black Market Prices_\r\n\r\nFollowing are some examples of black market prices in the occupied\r\nEastern territories:\r\n\r\n  _In Areas of the Caucasus_\r\n        1 Egg                 RM     1.--\r\n        1 lb. Butter          RM    15.-- - 20.--\r\n        1 ltr milk            RM     2.60 - 3.40\r\n      100 gr. tea             RM    20.-- - 40.--\r\n        1 apple               RM     1.--\r\n        1 chicken             RM     9.-- - 10.--\r\n        1 lb. meat            RM     5.--\r\n        1 winter overcoat     RM   600.--\r\n        1 pr. shoes           RM   200.-- - 300.--\r\n  _In the city of Kharkov_:\r\n        1 ltr milk            RM     3.-- - 4.--\r\n        1 kg tea              RM  1000.--\r\n        1 piece wartime soap  RM     7.-- - 8.--\r\n        1 ltr Vodka           RM    70.--\r\n        1 cigarette           RM     -.30\r\n        1 pr shoes            RM   400.-- - 500.--\r\n\r\nIn regard to all these prices, however, it must not be forgotten that\r\nthe majority of the scales being executed by means of barter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Armed Forces And Increases in Prices_\r\n\r\nBesides the lack of consumer goods, the German soldier is also\r\nresponsible for the outrageous prices, because by uncontrollable\r\nmeans he is obtaining funds from home besides his pay, which in\r\narmy of a million men add up to an imposing sum. Every expert of\r\nthe conditions knows that the doughboy will today pay any price,\r\nbecause the additional food items are more import to him than\r\nmoney. The suggestion, made to the reporter by various economic\r\ninspectorates, that the soldier in future should receive no\r\n_Reichskreditkassenscheine_, but shall receive a type of _substitute\r\nmoney_ for purchasing in post exchange [Marketendereien], can only\r\nthen be carried out, if the post exchanges can offer to the soldier\r\nadditional food items, which he would otherwise obtain in the black\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for the combat soldier to acquire additional food items\r\nor to purchase them for the homefront must not be hampered, it must not\r\nbe forgotten, that this combat soldier decides the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Combat Soldiers as the Bearer of Useful Barter._\r\n\r\nIt is therefore regrettable, that town commanders often punish the\r\nsoldier severely, who exchanges tobacco goods or minor items of\r\nconsumer goods which he receives from home, for food items with the\r\nlocal population. It has to be considered that the consumer goods in\r\nquestion are in most cases rubbish of the German household, items\r\nwhich can be foregone by the homefront, but which such as needles,\r\ntwine, pocket knives, nails, combs, etc., are necessary in the eastern\r\nterritory and bring good will. The combat soldier, who carried out this\r\nbarter, procures additional food for the front and/or to the homefront,\r\nand at the same time supplies to the East the most necessary consumer\r\ngoods, which cannot be supplied in general today by German authorities.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the market activity in Russian towns must be\r\nretained despite all mentioned disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Price Ceiling in the Black Market._\r\n\r\nIn order not to let the prices rise beyond all limits it is recommended\r\nto have a certain control, a price ceiling which equals the present\r\naverage price; however an experiment which was executed in various\r\ntowns, is not recommended for imitation, whereby merchandise which was\r\nnot sold on the market by evening, is confiscated and sold at the local\r\naverage price.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Establishment of a Central Food Administration._\r\n\r\nDespite all this, market dealing can not be a solution. The food supply\r\nmust be assured by the German administration. Two ways constitute the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n1. Further expansion of the factory kitchens\r\n\r\n2. Mass introduction of community kitchens.\r\n\r\nThis system was built up during the Bolshevist period in a form, which\r\nan unbiased reporter must describe as exemplary. For instance, there\r\nwas in the town of Simferropol, in the Crimea, during the Bolshevist\r\nperiod a food trust which supplied 23 mess halls and 15 factory\r\nkitchens, by which 50,000 of the town's 140,000 inhabitants were fed.\r\nBreakfast, lunch and supper were served and could be eaten right there\r\nand then, or were taken home. The appearance of the population and its\r\nphysical condition at the time of conquest of the territory proved\r\nthat the food was sufficient. A system of feeding to the population\r\nwas carried out here, which is also going into effect in Germany in\r\nnumerous labor camps, and factory canteens, etc., but in its present\r\nstage does not yet approach the Bolshevist system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Example Simferopol_\r\n\r\nA Kriegsveraltungsrat, who came from the Arbeitsfront took over these\r\ninstitutions in the town of Simferopol to a certain extent and operated\r\nthem according to the necessities and conditions of the present. This\r\norganization appears to be so successful that its general introduction\r\ninto the towns of the occupied East must be thought over in manner and\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nAt first, this system is marked that only a _single_ German\r\nadministrative official can be in charge of the entire system without\r\nany further German help.\r\n\r\nA Main Food Administration was established for the whole Crimea.\r\nThe native town administrations supplied the collaborators of this\r\norganization, which, in Simferopol alone, runs today 12 mess halls\r\nand 49 factory kitchens, in which you can eat lunch or take it to\r\nyour home. Those working for the German Armed Forces and also some of\r\ntheir relatives, a total of approximately 30,000 persons of the 70,000\r\ninhabitants of the town, are fed. There is mostly soup, vegetables,\r\nsometimes fish and meat from deceased animals.\r\n\r\nHowever the distribution of the allocated bread coupons frequently\r\nruns up against difficulties, since the bread supply is especially\r\ndifficult in the Crimea. On the other hand an information service of\r\nthe Food Administration itself is excellently organized; it consists of\r\nnative residents, who immediately report, if spoiled, but still edible\r\nfood from army stores, in the case of small truck farm vegetables\r\netc. can be procured. Furthermore each deceased horse or cow within\r\nthe territory of the town or its vicinity is reported immediately and\r\nexamined for suitability.\r\n\r\nA special control section of the Food Administration inspects the mess\r\nhalls, doctors make spot checks of the quality of the food offered.\r\nIn this case also, native help is used. Further sections of the Main\r\nFood Administration are the mill sections, which is in charge of the\r\nprocessing of grain. The section for the issuing of bread and food\r\ncoupons, the bread baking and trading section etc. A procurement\r\nsection which has to secure the release coupons from the competent\r\nGerman authorities and must look further for food, and call for it with\r\nits own vehicles, is in charge of the procurement of merchandise. All\r\nbig consumers, such as hospitals, schools etc., have to submit monthly\r\nreports of supply requirements. Procurement takes place according to a\r\ncommon plan, so that the German agricultural leadership is not hampered\r\nby numerous individual requests.\r\n\r\nThis example must be imitated in its magnitude. In the field of food,\r\nthe organizing capabilities of the Eastern population must be used,\r\nthus relieving simultaneously the German administrative apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe example Simferopol proves that we have to use the Slav in the huge\r\nEastern territories for the organization of food, since he is always in\r\nthe position to discover possibilities of procurement which we cannot\r\ndo because of insufficient help. Self administration, which goes as far\r\nas possible, in the field of food for the urban population is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Schematic All-inclusive Ruling of Fundamental Directives._\r\n\r\nOn account of the gigantic delivery quota of corn, meat, poultry, eggs,\r\noil, to the German Reich, it is obviously not possible in the near\r\nfuture to guarantee to the urban population in the East a 100% supply\r\nof food. In addition, as already explained, there is still a great deal\r\nof food in the hands of the farmers and of some urban residents which\r\nis beyond our control. Thus schematic ruling would therefore lead to\r\nthe result that the Russian towns would receive food which could be\r\nspared in an emergency at the expense of the German and/or the Western\r\nEuropean territories. Thus the final conclusion can only be this that\r\nat the moment, a general systematic ruling which guarantees the minimum\r\nsubsistence level of the entire population cannot be carried out in\r\nthe occupied Eastern territories. On the other hand, the responsible\r\nleaders of the occupied territories must immediately receive the\r\nauthority through directives from competent authority, that they can\r\ntake immediate measures there, where serious dangers arise in the food\r\nsituation of those natives employed in the war economy with freedom of\r\ndecision and responsibility to exceed the presently authorized rations,\r\nwhich secure the minimum subsistence level and prevent the described\r\ndangers (loss of Man Power, Anti-German, and Pro-Bolshevist attitude).\r\nThis system, which gives to the responsible administrative employee\r\nfreedom of action and which has primarily been developed and tried by\r\nthe English administration, based on hundred years of experience must\r\nbe introduced more and more in the German work in the Eastern area.\r\nBasic decisions from central authorities, which can be of unforeseen\r\nconsequence, should only be decided upon then, if the measures have\r\nproved themselves by experiments in a partial sector of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Position Agricultural\r\n\r\nThe food political situation which may become important during the\r\ncoming year, even for the Reich and the whole of Europe, is opposite\r\nto the demand to procure sufficient food for people working in town in\r\nessential industry.\r\n\r\nThe following spot checks of the various Eastern territories give an\r\napproximate picture of the situation:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caucasus_\r\n\r\nEconomic Inspectorates established generally a surplus of farm products\r\nfor the Reich can not be expected from the Caucasian area. At best,\r\nsome cattle, sunflower seeds, wool and cowhides could be delivered.\r\n\r\nAs far as grain is concerned, it must be expected that there will not\r\nbe enough in many cases for the supply of the local population until\r\nthe next harvest. For example, details from the District Voroschilovsk\r\n(Stavropol): the territory covers approximately 540,000 hectars, 60,000\r\nhectars of which are steppe.\r\n\r\nThe total area, growing wheat was 70,000 hectars, 10,000 hectars of\r\nwhich were destroyed by the Bolshevists. Of the total area growing\r\noats, approximately 50% of 8000 hectars are destroyed and full of\r\nweeds. Of 17,000 hectars of barley, 4,000 hectars are destroyed. 8,000\r\nhectar of meadow could not be mowed. The total cultivated area amounts\r\nto only 50-60% to that of 1940. Reason: lack of fuel and labor.\r\n\r\nIn the District Patigorsk, the conditions are still less favorable.\r\n\r\nThe example of the development of the Sovchos Semlianskaia near\r\nVoroschilovsk is also informative. According to this, there were the\r\nfollowing during the Bolshevist time at this Sovchos:\r\n\r\n  104 horses presently 41\r\n  104 cows presently 60\r\n  32,000 sheep presently 8,899\r\n\r\n 5,561 double hundredweights of barley and fodder are required to\r\n keep the present livestock, 650 double hundredweights are available.\r\n Reason: 180 hectars of 750 hectars of wheat were destroyed by the\r\n Bolshevists. 360 of 475 hectars of barley are lost, since it could not\r\n be cut in time because of lack of gasoline, tractors, scythes, and\r\n man power; 20 hectars of oats are completely lost. 5 of 18 tractors\r\n are still on hand. 5,000 of the 8,899 sheep mentioned above must be\r\n surrendered to the Armed Forces in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crimea_\r\n\r\nThe result of the harvest is 191,969 tons of grain. 109,620 tons are\r\nneeded for seed grain, 55,739 tons for fodder and 129,503 for food.\r\nAccordingly, there is a deficit 81,126 tons of grain in the Crimea.\r\nAdded to this is a poor harvest of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Territory Kharkov_\r\n\r\nIn the territory of Kharkov (Army B) the delivery of cattle to the\r\nfront has been so large, that only young cattle is still on hand.\r\nThousands of hectars of the best soil could not be cultivated because\r\nthere were no draft animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ukraine_\r\n\r\nThe total result of the harvest is worse than last year. In detail, the\r\ndelivery quota calls for: 600 ltr. milk from each dairy cow at a price\r\nof 7 Pfg. per liter (during the Bolshevist period it was 90 ltr. at\r\nprice of 15 Kopeken). Every liter delivered voluntarily exceeding this\r\nwas paid with 3 Rbl. Because of the high delivery quota of more than\r\n3 million tons of grain from the whole Ukraine it looks as follows in\r\nsome of the districts of the country.\r\n\r\nRural District Wynica: The harvest gave winter wheat:\r\n\r\n  82 982 double hundredweights\r\n  ------\r\n  55 900 double hundredweights must be surrendered\r\n  25 906 double hundredweights are required for feed grain.\r\n\r\nThis leaves 11,176 double hundredweights for feeding the population,\r\nwhich are by no means sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the General Commissariat Shitomir about 28% of the livestock has to\r\nbe consigned. Normally it would be 18%.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Commissariat Dniepropetrovsk._\r\n\r\nThe presumed consignment of grain amounts to a total of 490,000 tons of\r\nthe total crop of 820,000 tons. Thereby the population receives only 65\r\nkg. per capita of which 30 kg. already were distributed.\r\n\r\n26% of the total arable land is used for winter grains. Of that, 30%\r\nare good, 30% are spotted, and _40% did not come up at all_.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of cultivation are very great because of the shortage\r\nof tractors, fuel, and labor. Thus for 100 hectars 23-25 laborers are\r\nregularly required, but today only 13-14 are available. There are only\r\n4-6 horses to 100 hectars. But the cow teams requires a greater number\r\nof laborers.\r\n\r\nThe consignment of live stock amounts to 50% of the stock. There are\r\nnumerous cases where the farmer has to deliver his dairy cow, his only\r\nreal property from the Bolshevik period.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Agrarian Reform\r\n\r\nThe agrarian reform up to now has been carried out in a different\r\nmanner in the various occupied territories. While the \"Kalchos\" were\r\ndivided and the land given to the farmers for cultivation in the north\r\nand the center, not much was changed in the Bolshevistic conditions as\r\nsuch in the South, especially the Ukraine. The creation of agricultural\r\ncooperatives up to volume of 10% of the total agricultural area can not\r\nbe considered as a basic change of the system.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that in the south with its strongly industrialized\r\ngiant estates a slower pace is advisable in the division of the estate.\r\nThe danger of a decrease in production in cases of a quick division\r\nwould be present.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conception of the Cossacks-Atamane._\r\n\r\nIn addition, another fact has to be taken into consideration, which is\r\nthat old \"Atamanen\" have found in the Cossack areas for instance that\r\nonly old Cossacks were capable of managing an individual farm. The\r\nyoung generation is partially so used to industrial agriculture that\r\nbefore all a certain re-education is necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso in carrying out of the new agricultural reform a general solution,\r\nas already mentioned, must not be striven for from the beginning;\r\nrather the return to individual farming must be carried out with\r\nconsideration of economic and political points of view resulting from\r\nthe particular situation in a particular region of the tremendous\r\nEastern Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Arrangements in the Agrarian Reform._\r\n\r\nThe efficient German administrative expert must have the possibility\r\nof experimentation and his successes and his failures must become the\r\nbasis for final decision of the central office.\r\n\r\nThe discussion, which the reporter was able to have with the\r\nspecialists concerned in the entire eastern areas, resulted in the\r\nfollowing proposed solution:\r\n\r\nThe Russian farmer is without exception land hungry and an opponent of\r\nthe \"Kalchos system.\" He desires private property of land, even though\r\nof limited extent. In contrast to the worker and intellectual he is the\r\nmost honest opponent of the Bolshevik system. If tomorrow he is denied\r\nhis property, then we shall lose the east economic and political power\r\nwith which we could build up the Eastern Area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Land Distribution According to Merit._\r\n\r\nThe demand to immediately allot to all farmers, land as private\r\nproperty, is in spite of these political points of view, of course\r\nunfeasible for the present.\r\n\r\nFirst of all those farmers respectively their families, who themselves\r\nor whose sons have earned special merit in war economy in the fight\r\nagainst partisans, or today or tomorrow at the front, must receive\r\nself-sufficient individual farms.\r\n\r\nAlthough later the distribution of land must be carried out in a\r\ngenerous manner without the qualifying clauses used today.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of the agricultural region in the East must, because\r\nof the political reasons mentioned, as time goes on, become the\r\nproperty of farmer families in order to create a stratum of satisfied\r\nfarmers as sure counter-weight against possible revolutionary ambitions\r\nof labor and intelligentsia in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_State Farms and Farmer's Land_\r\n\r\nBesides these farmers' lands, a great number of state farms should\r\nbe created by the taking over of the Sovchosen and/or the creation\r\nof new estates whose production would have to deliver the excess of\r\nagricultural products necessary for Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Slav as Worker\r\n\r\n_Necessity of Realistic Policy_\r\n\r\nAs initially pictured, every member of the rural population less\r\nmeans a weakening of the labor power as well as fighting power of the\r\nReich. All occurrences of the recent past prove that there is no room\r\nfor ideologies at this time. Where this demand is not heeded because\r\nof ideological reasons, for the sake of future problems, where the\r\nlaw of the best utilization of man-power is violated, the objection\r\nof the soldiers as well as that of responsible civil servants arises\r\nwith justification. Thus we hear again and again from leading Germans\r\nin the East, the regret expressed that we learn too little from the\r\nEnglish, who--under the cover of long term policy--act on the basis of\r\nthe needs of the hour, while we antagonize people in the East and cause\r\nthe greatest difficulties in reconstruction only in order to proclaim\r\ndistant aims, whose accomplishment is in no way certain, but which come\r\nabout on its own accord after a victory.\r\n\r\nHe who just like the reporter, has gone through English schooling\r\nand knows the English manner of treating foreign peoples, can only\r\nconfirm that the greatest mistake of our entire Eastern policy is to\r\nbe found in this field. First of all we have to win the war. Having\r\nwon it, we can shape the area as we see fit. Every proclamation of an\r\naim that repulses those who are of the most use for us in the Eastern\r\narea today, which makes them resent the German leadership, is, from\r\na soldier's point of view, a mistake which has to be continually\r\nrectified by the commitment of German blood.\r\n\r\nThus the Project Sauckel as earned out in the Eastern area has caused\r\nunrest and dissatisfaction which is the equivalent of a lost battle,\r\nthough without doubt it was the final means to cover the requirements\r\nfor workers of the German economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dangerous Excesses._\r\n\r\nBut the executing agencies have committed errors which should have been\r\navoided: De-lousing of Russian girls by men, taking of nude photographs\r\nin forced positions, locking female doctors in cars in order to make\r\nthem available to the transport leaders, transporting of shackled girls\r\nin shirts through Russian localities to the railroad, etc.... (The\r\ncomplete material has been channeled through the proper army regions to\r\nthe OKH.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Important Imponderables._\r\n\r\nIt is of course correct to consider these things without\r\nsentimentality. In spite of that the results of such errors must not be\r\noverlooked. Before everything, the treatment of the Eastern workers in\r\nthe Reich is decisive. According to all previous reports the results in\r\nhousehold and in agriculture are good; in industry bad. The fact that\r\nmale and female workers housed in camps have no leave, that exercise of\r\nreligion etc., in contrast to conditions in the Russian territories, is\r\nprohibited, leads the population of the occupied Eastern territories to\r\nthe conclusion that the Slav is treated and utilized as a slave. The\r\nresult is that when today a commission for the hiring of labor for the\r\nReich appears in a region, everybody, as far as possible, flees into\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nOur propaganda, which attempts to influence the East by an expenditure\r\nof millions of Marks and irreplaceable paper, and also by the\r\nemployment of valuable manpower, which is lost to the Armed Forces,\r\nmust evaporate into thin air under these circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attitude of the Eastern Peoples Important._\r\n\r\nThe Slav will formulate his opinion and attitude on the basis of his\r\nexperiences in the Reich. Here comes the decision, whether millions of\r\nSlavs will reconstruct under German domination and leadership willingly\r\nor whether they, filled with hate, will seek every opportunity to\r\ndestroy this domination, since their conditions make a worthwhile\r\nexistence impossible.\r\n\r\nThe attitude, still present today occasionally in some places, to treat\r\nthe Slav as a slave, whereby beatings are the best means of education,\r\nmust be corrected by immediate orientation, and that the maltreatment\r\nconcerned must be stopped at once by the severest threat of punishment.\r\n\r\nDespite all terror during the Bolshevist period, the social aid\r\nmeasures for the Russian worker and his family were considerably\r\nbetter than is assumed in Germany--as has been proven in the meantime\r\nby unbiased investigations. In addition a purposeful meaning of his\r\nwork in the realm of the community is given to him by unrelenting and\r\nrefined propaganda. One must have much understanding for this, and it\r\nis by no means easy to win this people for us. Whoever represents the\r\nopinion that the attitude of this people is unimportant, sins against\r\nthe German armed power in the face of the war economic and also future\r\nmilitary indespensability of the Eastern peoples and calls for the\r\ndanger that most valuable, forever irreplaceable German blood must be\r\nsacrificed in addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methods of the Utilization of Labor._\r\n\r\nThe utilization of labor of the Slavic workers can be carried out best\r\nin similarity to the Bolshevist example, as various experiments which\r\nthe reporter could observe, prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Successes in Dniepropetrovsk._\r\n\r\nModel successes have been achieved by _Commissioner General Selzner\r\nin Dniepropetrovsk_. The Russian worker, who practically has been\r\nprimarily an armament worker for years, works according to the\r\n_group piecework system_. Not the individual performance, but that\r\nof the group was decisive. This system, the advantages of which are\r\napparent, must be retained and introduced generally. Furthermore,\r\nthe punitive system for contract violators or workers who violate\r\nthe work discipline is ideal. At first, a reprimand is given or a\r\nmonetary fine imposed. In case of repeated violations, additional duty\r\n[Dienstverpflichtung] with exact orientation about further punitive\r\nmeasures is another disciplinary procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Educational Work Camps._\r\n\r\nThe severest punishment is confinement in a educational work camp. The\r\nmaximum length of punishment here is 6 months. Such camps are in all\r\nDistrict Commissariats, sometimes installed as mobile camps and made\r\navailable to the Organization TODT. In the camps, all _beatings_ and\r\nall corporal punishment are _forbidden_ altogether, out of principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coordination of Utilization of Labor and Food._\r\n\r\nThe work is carried out in groups, as in the group piecework. In case\r\nof full work performance, the convicts receive Armed Forces rations,\r\ndiluted three times. If the group of ten men produce in their work\r\nperformance only 50% of the quota, their food is diluted six times,\r\nand they receive 50% less bread. The results are marvelous. The amount\r\nof punishment decreases constantly, work performance increases, the\r\nmorale of the workers is good, considering the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bonus System._\r\n\r\nThe Bonus system proves itself in case of the Eastern workers,\r\nindustrial workers as well as farmers. Thus in the District\r\nDniepropetrovsk, especially good results were achieved in the delivery\r\nof sunflowers, when 1 kg oil was made available to the farmer for every\r\n100 kg of seeds delivered.\r\n\r\nAn especially attractive bonus is the _distribution of tobacco_. In\r\nseveral districts, the tobacco, allocated to certain armament and/or\r\nwar economic plants, is distributed equally up to 90% to the workers,\r\nwhereas the remaining 10% * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Salary, Money, Market--Price Problem\r\n\r\nThe salaries which are being paid at the present time in the Eastern\r\narea are so low, in comparison to the general market prices, that they\r\nare of absolutely no value: Actually, in the entire section, there\r\nexists _no salary problem at all, but merely a food problem_. It is\r\nimpossible to raise the salaries in order to thereby make it possible\r\nfor the workers to purchase the most essential consumer goods. There\r\nis enough money. The reporter experienced repeatedly that for example,\r\nporters, unskilled laborers, etc., were in possession of such amounts\r\nof money as no German General possessed. A raise of salaries would only\r\nconstitute a swelling of the circulation of a medium of exchange and a\r\nfurther price increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparison with the Japanese Experience in China._\r\n\r\nIn the entire Eastern Area, prices are being paid today for food\r\nand consumer goods which are actually inflationary. The reporter,\r\nwho before the war, in 1939 had the assignment to conduct the same\r\ninvestigations on the Chinese-Japanese battle front, today in the\r\nEastern area can only determine that the German administration is\r\nrepeating the same mistakes which Japan had previously exercised in the\r\noccupied Chinese territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combining the Reichs-kreditmark with the Ruble._\r\n\r\nThe greatest financial mistake which we could have made was to combine\r\nthe Reichsmark, respectively the Reichskreditmark with the Ruble,\r\nsimilarly as Japan had done with its leveling, in connection with the\r\nChinese dollar, until after severe set-back, it was at last recognized\r\nthat this had been the greatest mistake which could have been made at\r\nall by the Japanese financial policy.\r\n\r\nThe Reichskreditmark, which, not only in the Eastern, but also in\r\nother occupied territories, is the medium of exchange which the combat\r\nsoldier accepts as standard salary, is today actually of inflationary\r\nvalue. Her fate depends on the Ruble, which is entirely beyond our\r\ncontrol. Today there is no German office which could determine in\r\nwhich amounts the Ruble is circulating, which amounts, thru robbing of\r\nthe inhabitants, have come into additional circulation at the Finance\r\nOffices and which amounts are brought in by the Bolshevists through the\r\nFront, into the occupied territory.\r\n\r\nWe therefore made the same mistake with the same repercussion. Just\r\nas Japan, after several years of the Chinese-Japanese war, decided to\r\nwithdraw from the former use of enemy currency, we too shall have to\r\ntake that step. The quicker this happens, the better it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Karbovanetz Experiment._\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Karbovanetz in the Ukraine, put through as an\r\nattempted solution, must be recognized as such, although it, as local\r\nexperts of the Reichscommissariat themselves confirm, was a useless\r\nattempt. It is so because a partial solution is senseless in the huge\r\nEastern Area and the Karbovanetz is meaningless as long as the other\r\nimmense territories retain the Ruble.\r\n\r\nThe attempt was also doomed to failure because currency problems can\r\nonly be solved together with the consumer goods problem. One can\r\ndetermine and control mediums of exchange; nothing is changed in the\r\nprice fixing, as long as not even a half way satisfactory consumers\r\ngoods offer opposes the continuous flow of mediums of exchange to the\r\nworking country--and city inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe currency political experiment, taken as a whole, must therefore be\r\nconsidered as a failure in the Ukraine. It has only brought unrest to\r\nthe people. Above all, the fact that large banknotes are not redeemable\r\nin Karbovanetz, has resulted in the transport of money into the other\r\nsections, where the notes are changed into small coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Central Solution of Currency Problem_.\r\n\r\nThis case proves particularly well that such efforts towards solution\r\nshould be conducted only centrally, never locally. This example is\r\nfurther proof that, as all the General officers of the Army sector\r\nand Army groups had informed the reporter the greatest danger in the\r\nEastern area was the lack of a central leadership in the Civilian\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Care of the sick--Self Aid Service\r\n\r\nWith a view to the aim, that is to say, the maintenance of the\r\nable-bodied person, the most important beside the sustenance, is the\r\ncare of the sick and the safeguarding of those people who through\r\nlengthy illness have become unfit for work.\r\n\r\nIn some Army sectors, in the meanwhile, precautions for the care of the\r\nsick have been taken, and it is true, not only in the interest of the\r\ncountry inhabitants working for the German Armed Forces, but above all,\r\nin recognition of the Russian Psyche, for their families as well. The\r\nmeasures, carried out in this sense in the various Army sectors, must\r\nbe taken over in general.\r\n\r\nThe lack of medicinal items, in the entire Eastern Area, is\r\nparticularly catastrophic. The number of hospitals, doctors and medical\r\npersonnel is fairly adequate, despite the abductions during the retreat\r\nof the Bolshevists. In order to uphold the standard of the people, for\r\nthe purpose of war economic and military utilization, you must however\r\nwork primarily for the accumulation of medicines for the entire Eastern\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exemplary Solution in the Northern and Central Army Sector_\r\n\r\nOf particular importance is the so-called _Self Aid Service_, which\r\nrepresents a special measure of the first order for the entire Russian\r\narea and which expects to lift the social calibre of the peasantry in\r\nthe Northern and Central Army Sector. It is necessary to spread this\r\norganization to all other occupied territories.\r\n\r\nAs the reporter was able to determine, on the basis of intensive\r\ninvestigations, particularly in this field, measures were taken during\r\nthe Bolshevistic period, which on the average, correspond to the German\r\nconditions. The partially carried out and proposed emergency measures\r\nfor further accomplishments correspond of course in no way to the\r\nformer Bolshevistic and other accomplishments as customary in Germany\r\ntoday. They have in fact the exclusive aim to keep the most important\r\nportions of the Eastern Nations alive and capable of working for the\r\nGerman Armed Forces and the sustenance of the German people.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. The School System\r\n\r\nThe viewpoint represented up to now by numerous German offices in the\r\nEastern area, that the Slavic person should be kept in a condition\r\nwhich could not be primitive enough, cannot practically be carried out.\r\nAll Military posts, all Civilian Administrative offices, with which the\r\nreporter spoke on this problem took the viewpoint that the front, like\r\nthe German war economy, was in need of a worker's replacement, which\r\ncould not be supplied by 3rd or 4th grade primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Breeding of Superfluous Intelligentsia._\r\n\r\nWithout exception, the viewpoint is taken, of course, that it would\r\nbe wrong to heed a Russian intelligentsia, which without possibility\r\nof commitment, dissatisfied and without work, tomorrow would have to\r\nbecome the bearer of National, Revolutionary and Panslavic ideas. It\r\nis here important to keep a proper plan in mind. To point here to\r\nIndia, to England's faulty policy, is premature. The reporter had the\r\nopportunity to study the English colonial policy in India. It is true\r\nthat the English, out of consideration for later working possibilities,\r\nmake it possible for every Hindu to study at any desired school or\r\ncollege. In this manner, a Hindu proletarian intelligentsia was\r\ncreated. However--on the other side of every propaganda--one must admit\r\ntoday that, as the result of this English policy, today, in the darkest\r\nhome of the Empire, one cannot speak of serious uprisings in India and\r\nthat the Indian economy is working one hundred percent for the British\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The British Experiences._\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not decisive as was sometimes believed, if a young\r\nnative inhabitant in a subordinate section has a college education\r\nor is illiterate, but decisive is the fact whether this person is\r\nsatisfied with the extensive utilization of labor and thereby actually\r\nis the best collaborator of the ruling people, or if he, regardless of\r\nwhat educational class he belongs to, dreams only of the downfall of\r\nthis ruling class. The fact that England, as the third people after the\r\nGreek and Roman Empire has succeeded on the basis of a century-long\r\nexperience of her colonial statesmen to gain supporters for herself\r\namong the best of the conquered peoples is the basis of the rule of the\r\nBritish Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The German Language in the East_.\r\n\r\nIf we are prohibiting today the learning of the German language in the\r\noccupied Eastern territories, then this is considered only a sign of\r\nweakness, not that of strength. Military detachments told the reporter\r\nthat they were in many instances asked by the natives why their\r\nchildren were not allowed to study the German language. The Russians\r\nconcluded from this that the Germans intended to leave the Eastern\r\nterritory in the shortest possible period of time. Throughout the\r\nexistence of world history, the conquered have learned the languages of\r\nthe ruling peoples. This law of nature cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nToday it is actually so, that--contrary to the order of the Ministry\r\nfor the East-German is being learned and taught everywhere. Especially\r\nexemplary is the settlement at Selzner in the General Commissariat\r\nDniepropetrovsk, where in the professional schools all professional and\r\ntechnical expressions are taught to the apprentices right away in the\r\nGerman language.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Replacement [Nachwuchs] of Specialists_.\r\n\r\nAside from the general school education the question of _specialist\r\ntraining_ for industrial use plays the decisive part at present.\r\nHere also the way and manner is exemplary in which the solution is\r\nbeing executed in the General Commissariat Dniepropetrovsk with an\r\ninclination toward Bolshevist examples.\r\n\r\nThis concerns handicraft schools with attached retraining shops, which\r\nare connected with practical work in the factory.\r\n\r\nThe youths between the ages of 14-16 years, who have left school,\r\nattend a training course in industrial preparatory school, which lasts\r\ntwo months, after having taken a capability examination with the\r\nemployment office. Then follows practical work in a factory; duration\r\n6 month. This is followed by another training course of 2 month. After\r\nevery attendance of a semester the youth advances into the next higher\r\nwage class. Altogether 12-16 months of training are given.\r\n\r\nThe system turns out useful specialists within the shortest period\r\nof time, even though they are not painstaking craftsmen. The\r\ncontinuation of this method is to be urgently recommended in view of\r\nthe mobilization of labor, and if possible it should be executed by a\r\n_central order for the remaining occupied Eastern territories_.\r\n\r\nIn Dniepropetrovsk itself especially good participants of the training\r\ncourses are finally taken over after the Germans example into an\r\napprenticeship of three years' length, where their final training takes\r\nplace under German supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Retraining in Critical Professions._\r\n\r\nWith the same system the unskilled workers who were left behind by the\r\nBolshevists are being retrained in the critical professions: metal\r\ncraftsmen, construction craftsmen, carpenters, and stone cutters.\r\nFurther schools for car mechanics, tractor drivers, etc., have been\r\nestablished and schools for other professions are being planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medical and Legal Replacement Necessary_.\r\n\r\nBesides this special training for industrial use a thorough training of\r\nthe young generation also in the medical, veterinary, and legal fields\r\nis necessary. Because we need the Slav as a peasant and worker and\r\ntomorrow as a fighting soldier, in order to maintain ourselves against\r\nthe whole world, it is necessary that especially in the medical field\r\nthe required education for the maintenance of the population, whose\r\nlife and work is necessary for our front. The impetus is the greater,\r\nbecause already today the time has arrived, when Ukrainian and/or\r\nRussian doctors are working in the Reich itself as assistant doctors in\r\nGerman hospitals because of the lack of doctors and thereby represent\r\nto the leading doctors a more valuable help than the inexperienced\r\nyoung German generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rising Generation of Farmers._\r\n\r\nJust as important is the rising generation of farmers. In reality, in\r\nthe East, the Specialist Officers [Sonderfuehrer] who cultivated at\r\nhome 10 Mozgen, does not manage half a dozen communal farms [Sovchose]\r\nand state farms [Kolchose] with a total of a hundred thousand hectars,\r\nbut the problems of such agricultural installations are mastered by\r\nthe Bolshevist agronomist subordinate to the former, who has received\r\na preliminary training during the Bolshevist period in order to manage\r\nhuge industrialized agricultural installations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basic Meaning of the School Problem._\r\n\r\nHowever, the question of schools, apart from all practical aspects\r\nof the rising generation of workers is urgent for us, also for\r\npropagandistic considerations. All efforts of the reporter to determine\r\nwhich apart from the practical social measures of Bolshevism, of\r\nthe number of Moscow's ideological propaganda slogans has developed\r\nactually the strongest public appeal, yield the following unmistakable\r\npicture:\r\n\r\nThe entire population of the Soviet Union, even as far back as the\r\nmost remote village--despite all terrors--had the conviction that\r\neach and every one carries the marshal's baton in his knapsack. Every\r\nfarmer's son, every worker's child actually had every opportunity for\r\nadvancement in the countless schools of the Soviets. There was no\r\nvillage in which one or more farmer families could not state proudly\r\nthat their daughter or their son is an engineer or a doctor or chief\r\nagronomist or Commander of the Red Army, etc. _There was an unusually\r\nbroad middle strata of Soviet intelligentsia_, whose highest aspiration\r\nwas the continuation of education, the breaking into the scientific\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs a sole sample taken at random the Sovchos Semlianskaia near\r\nVoreschilovsk is mentioned. The following comprise the administration\r\nof this State property; a director with a monthly salary of 1000\r\nRubles, his deputy 600 Rubles, another agronomist for special\r\nassignments with 600 Rubles, two agronomists for sheep with 450\r\nRubles each, the chief animal agronomist with 850 Rubles, two animal\r\nspecialists with 450 Rubles each, the veterinary with 750 Rubles, two\r\nassistants with 450 Rubles each, the chief shepherd with 350 Rubles,\r\nthe bookkeeper with 750 Rubles, his deputy with 500 Rubles, three more\r\nbookkeepers with 350 Rubles each.\r\n\r\nSuch a staff of \"these of the intelligentsia\" [Intelligenzlern]\r\nadministred 20,000 hectars with 605 workers, including the members of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nThe crass transition from the Bolshevist propaganda of the \"ascent\"\r\n[Aufstieg] into the intelligentsia to our method of closing all schools\r\nis perhaps the very measure which is the most dangerous for our\r\ndomination in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theater and Film_\r\n\r\nIn the same connection the theater and film question is important.\r\nThe incident in Kiev is well known, where, after the presentation of\r\na revue under German stage-direction with nude girls, etc., although\r\nsubdued but completely unmistakable protest reactions by the native\r\ninhabitants were the result. The Russian and the people of the East\r\narea influenced by him, still considered the theater as an educational\r\ninstitution. They expect either education or a political tendency\r\nin the sense of training. In the serious theater, every activity of\r\namusement appears to them as a sacrilege and consequently our revues\r\nand soldier shows as a barbaric action against culture.\r\n\r\nIt is similar with the motion pictures. After the appearance of the\r\nfirst German entertainment films, for a long time the native public\r\nvainly racked its brains over their tendency. All German offices,\r\nall interpreters, all native inhabitants who were linguists were\r\noverwhelmed with pertinent questions. Apparently the peasants agreed on\r\nthe solution that all German films, which, as is known, take place in\r\nan atmosphere of luxury essentially have a marked tendency to glorify\r\ncapitalism and its outward forms.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it is vital to exercise the greatest caution and tact in\r\nthe selection of films for the Eastern area. It is best to exhibit\r\ncultural films, which are received with the greatest elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. The Judicial Problem\r\n\r\n_Collegiate Courts or Single Judges_\r\n\r\nIn various army areas, as well as in the Reich Commissariat Ukraine,\r\na legal code have been created for the arbitration of civil court\r\ndisagreements. As for details, the opinions differ. In the Army Area\r\nNorth and in Army Area Center, collegiate courts have been set up. In\r\nthe Ukraine, the point of view is taken that the single judges are\r\nbetter, because the Slav has the tendency to evade the responsibility.\r\nThere were endless proceedings in the collegiate court without the\r\npossibility of arriving at a clear-cut judgment, but the single judge\r\nis forced to pronounce a sentence on his own responsibility. This\r\nshortens the proceedings and is more favorable in its consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trained Jurists_\r\n\r\nThe experience and conclusion that only trained jurists are fit for\r\nthis judicial office is general and unmistakable. This conclusion\r\nis general. It was explained especially clearly in the General\r\nCommissariat, Dniepropetrowsk by the highest judge, who is continually\r\ntraveling in the country and is professionally best equipped to judge\r\nthe situation. This example also proves that the 3 year elementary\r\nschool [Grundschule] in the Eastern area is unfeasible.\r\n\r\nIn the necessary clarification of the legal code the inheritance law\r\n(testaments) and marital law in particular are very urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Unified Leadership.\r\n\r\nThe complaint of all military offices as well as numerous civil\r\nadministration offices is that today the Ministry for the East is not\r\nuniformly decisive in the Eastern area, but that a half dozen other\r\noffices act independently. In the appendix a chart of the structure of\r\nArmy Group A is included which shows how many and what offices work on\r\ntheir own responsibility, outside of the proper military administration\r\nin its sphere.\r\n\r\nOf course, this independence of individual offices gives them an\r\nextraordinary striking power, but in the long run this division of\r\nauthority cannot be kept up. Even if the mentioned offices retain their\r\ngeneral independence in the future, it must by all means, be achieved\r\nthat the commander of the army areas are given the authority to\r\ndelegate to all these offices the tasks designated for the individual\r\ncommitments after previous consultation. Every military and civil\r\nleader with final responsibility in the Eastern area is weakened in\r\nhis authority and thus also in view to the achieving of his aims\r\nby the fact that there are today, a half dozen officers which act\r\nindependently in his sphere without having to subordinate their own\r\ninterests to the overall interest of the particular sector. This\r\ndivision of jurisdiction is the same over-bureaucratization which we\r\njustly criticize in our enemies and which the Fuehrer has often enough\r\nbranded as the cause of the weakening of our effort.\r\n\r\nIt will have to come that the highest leadership issues directives\r\nwhich are decisive for the civil as well as military administrative\r\ndistricts, whereby a basic law, according to an English model, has to\r\nbe considered always: first of all experiments are made, and only then,\r\nafter examination of the experiences, will the final decisive orders be\r\ngiven by the central office. This knowledge of leadership from century\r\nold experience, as possessed by the British Empire must finally be\r\ntaken over by the proper central administrative authorities in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Administrative Experiment Areas.\r\n\r\nThe Army Area, respectively Army Group A (Caucasus) have organized\r\nexperimental areas of the administrative type, and namely one in the\r\nterritory of the Cuban-Cossacks around Unmanskaia, which includes six\r\nregions with a population of about 150,000 each, the other one in the\r\narea of the Karatschaier.\r\n\r\nThe two closed settlement groups of the Karatschaier are led by a\r\ncommittee of the eldest, each consisting of 8 of the noblest persons of\r\nthe tribe, who are directly subordinated to the local commander in an\r\nadvisory capacity.\r\n\r\nThe cooperative [Kolchos] land is divided up, and given to the farmers\r\nas their property. The old farmland from the Bolshevist period is\r\ntax-free, taxes are levied for the new.\r\n\r\nIn the experimental area of the Cuban-Cossacks, the role of the local\r\ncommander is changed. Six regions are concentrated under one field\r\ncommandant. The District Ataman is subordinated to the field commandant\r\nin an advisory capacity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a special economic liaison staff has been created which is\r\ndirectly subordinated to the economic inspectorate Caucasus. The county\r\nAgricultural Supervisor [Kreislandwirt] must turn to him. The regional\r\nagronomist is also subordinate directly to the liaison staff.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to carry out a certain amount of self administration\r\ndeserve the highest attention in the framework of the reconstruction\r\npolicy in the East. We must learn from experiments. Whatever proves\r\nitself here must be exercised again tomorrow in the best suited areas,\r\nperhaps in the Ukraine, then again in parts of districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. Realist-Political Leadership of the Peoples in the Eastern Area.\r\n\r\nAn ideological goal must be given to the peoples of the Eastern area,\r\nwhere already today and tomorrow even more the last inhabitant is used\r\nfor essential agricultural or war economic task, above that where his\r\nuse in military combat, whether it is against partisan or directly on\r\nthe front has already begun. As long as no such goal is in front of\r\nthe eyes of the Slav, we must expect that all forces, organized in the\r\nmeantime, will turn against the German leadership in case of a military\r\nreverse, with which a far sighted policy always must count upon.\r\n\r\nNever in world history was there such a condition, whereby a large\r\npeople respectively several large peoples gave their entire working\r\npower and their blood in military commitments without knowing what\r\nresults they can achieve by this for themselves, their children and\r\ntheir children's children. The fact that we do not recognize this\r\nthesis of experience of history will cost us tomorrow the blood of\r\nhundreds of thousands of German soldiers. There is no General of the\r\nGerman Armed Forces today who has any understanding that we believe to\r\nbe able to dominate the Slavs without consideration of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Self Administration_\r\n\r\nThis impression of the Eastern peoples that their work and military\r\nutilization in the German service is meaningful, can only be achieved\r\nby giving them self administration in a national-political respect\r\nas a goal. Secret slogans can actually never be kept secret, that is\r\nknown. Today, the conviction is at large all through the Eastern area\r\nthat Germany has the intention to put the Slav on the same level as the\r\nNegro; that the Slav must be biologically exterminated at the first\r\npossible moment, that at best he would be all to seek his livelihood\r\nbeyond the Ural mountains.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge constitutes the greatest danger for the German leader\r\nwho wants to organize the Russian area. Already the fact that the\r\nmarked conviction in the Eastern area is generally known and widespread\r\ntoday, means a weakening of the war economic and soldierly potential\r\nof the Slav, such as no partisan propaganda could achieve to such an\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Primacy of War Necessities_\r\n\r\nAll of these projects exist beyond any ideological attitude. The\r\nmilitary and war economic necessities are the only guides. If we\r\nforsake them, then the German soldier at the front will have to pay for\r\nour political errors in disposition with his blood.\r\n\r\nWe must build, by taking only those measures, beyond all ideology,\r\nwhich may be suitable after a victorious peace, which are useful in\r\nfurthering the working and soldierly commitment of the Slav in our\r\ninterest and thereby conserve German working power and German blood,\r\nand bring German victory closer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppendix A Daily Food Rations in the Occupied Eastern Territories.

The sending away of the\r\n121st and 304th was good. One already more than 50 trains, the other\r\nabout 46 trains.\r\n\r\nDown there in the Balkans a clean-up campaign is under way in Jajce.\r\nWhere the opponent has retreated, he is being pushed. Those mountains\r\nhere are quiet. At * * * across the demarcation line, have thrown back\r\nthe enemy. Here he has attacked very hard, left 37 dead. People are\r\ncontinuously being arrested in Belgrade. One can say that every day\r\nbetween 15 and 30 Mihailovic followers are being shot.\r\n\r\nUp here where the Italians have started to withdraw, the pressure has\r\nalready become somewhat livelier. Here are concentrations,--here is\r\nwhere once in a while the railways are being destroyed, and also in\r\nthis area where the pressure of the enemy against this contemplated\r\nItalian line is increasing.\r\n\r\nDown here another clearing action by the Italians is now in swing.\r\n\r\nIn Finland everything is quiet, also after these fake attacks day\r\nbefore yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTIAL TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1384-PS\r\n\r\n  Conference of the Fuehrer with General Field Marshal Keitel\r\n  and General Zeitzler on 8 June 1943 at the Berghof--\r\n  Extract from stenographic notes.\r\n\r\n[Page 6] The Fuehrer: * * * I can only say: we will never build up a\r\nRussian army, that is a phantom of the first order. Before we will\r\ndo so, it will be much simpler if I get the Russians as workers in\r\nGermany; that is much more decisive. I don't need a Russian army which\r\nI have to strengthen with German corset stays through and through. It\r\nserves my purpose if I get Russian workers instead. Then I can release\r\nthe Germans and reeducate the Russians. For us the most successful\r\nthing lies in the production of the Russian workers who are employed\r\nin Germany; of course, we have to feed them in a different way if we\r\nthrust a maximum amount of work upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Page 12] He said: Here, I lose 500,000 Jews. I must take them away,\r\nbecause the Jews are the element of revolt. But in my area, actually,\r\nthe Jews were the only tradesmen. Now they want to set up high schools\r\nand grammar schools, thereby building here, a national Ukrainian\r\nstate, that should in the future, fight against Russia. I am not even\r\nin a position to have the worker, who must work here, have his boots\r\nrepaired. I can't do that because the tradesmen are no longer here. The\r\nJews are all gone. What is more important, that I train the Ukrainians\r\nhow to mend boots, or that I send them high schools so that they can\r\nbuild up the Ukrainian state?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Page 25] Keitel: Now about the employment of people from deserters\r\ncamps.\r\n\r\nFuehrer: I am of the opinion that they should be transferred to Germany\r\nand used there. They are prisoners of war. If I only could transfer 30,\r\n40 or 50,000 men to the commissioner for coal production! But then they\r\nwill have to be treated really in a decent way.\r\n\r\nZeitzler: I have set as my goal that they should become decent workers\r\nin Germany. We can't do much with deserters at the front. I can commit\r\na few of them as volunteers for replacements. But the majority should\r\ngo to Germany as workers in order to release Germans.\r\n\r\nFuehrer: I can only say: if we do not straighten out our coal affairs,\r\nthe moment will arrive when I shall not be able to produce either\r\nammunition or explosives anymore, nor will we be able to build\r\nsubmarines. This will happen in 100 other fields too. It is idiotic.\r\nBut the moment will arrive. It is already tragic when the Italians come\r\nand ask us why do we not deliver this or that. I have to deliver it. We\r\ncannot, because we haven't got enough coal. That is sloppy, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1386-PS\r\n\r\n  1936 REICHSGESETZBLATT, PART I, 378\r\n  Law concerning the granting of amnesty of 23 April 1936\r\n\r\nThe Reich government has decided to enact the following law, which is\r\nannounced hereby.\r\n\r\n\r\nPar. 1\r\n\r\n1.

The Reich Labor Service is a service of honor for the German people.\r\n\r\n2. It is the duty of all young Germans of both sexes to serve their\r\nnation within the Reich Labor Service.\r\n\r\n3. It is the task of the Reich Labor Service to educate the German\r\nyouth in the spirit of National Socialism for the community of the\r\nnation and the true conception of labor, particularly to inspire them\r\nwith the necessary respect for manual labor.\r\n\r\n4. The purpose of the Reich Labor Service is the execution of work for\r\nthe common benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 2\r\n\r\n1. The Reich Labor Service is subordinated to the Reich Ministry of the\r\nInterior. The Reich Labor leader rules under its jurisdiction over the\r\nReich Labor Service.\r\n\r\n2. The Reich Labor leader is at the head of the Reichsleitung of\r\nthe Labor Service. He dictates its organization, decides about the\r\nmobilization of labor and directs training and education.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nThe Labor Service Duty of the Male Youth\r\n\r\nArticle 3\r\n\r\n1.

As a rule, the eligible recruits will be called for labor duty in\r\nthe year of completion of their 19th year.\r\n\r\n4. Voluntary admission at an earlier age is possible.\r\n\r\n5. Prison terms of more than 30 days will have to be made up for by the\r\nrecruits and volunteers of the Reich Labor Service, if their offense\r\ndoes not make necessary their dismissal from the Reich Labor Service,\r\naccording to Article 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 4\r\n\r\nThe eligible recruits for labor will be conscripted by the\r\n\"Ersatzdienststellen of the Reich Labor Service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 5\r\n\r\n1.

Not eligible for labor service are persons of non-aryan descent or\r\nwho are married to a person of non-aryan descent. The ruling of the\r\nReich Minister of the Interior as in Article 1, part 3 of the Reich Law\r\nfor Civil Servants, dated 8 August 1933 (RGBl I, 575), determines who\r\nis to be considered of non-aryan descent.\r\n\r\n2. Non-aryans who have been declared worthy for armed service\r\n[wehrwuerdig] according to Article 15, part 2 of the Armed Service Law\r\n[Wehrgesetz] can also be accepted for labor service. They cannot occupy\r\nsuperior positions in the labor service, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8\r\n\r\nEligible labor recruits can be deferred from labor service for up to 2\r\nyears, in the case of vital professional reasons up to 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n_The Labor Service Duties of the Female Youth_\r\n\r\nArticle 9\r\n\r\nThe rules concerning the labor service of the female youth will be a\r\nmatter of special legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n_Duties and Privileges of the Members of the Reich Labor Service_\r\n\r\nArticle 10\r\n\r\n1.

Labor service recruits and volunteers can be released before the end\r\nof their term in the following cases:\r\n\r\na. on their request, if a reason for deferment, according to Article 8\r\ncame into existence after induction.\r\n\r\nb. if they are no longer in the possession of the physical or mental\r\ncapacities necessary for the performance of the service.\r\n\r\n2. A premature dismissal of labor service recruits and volunteers\r\nmust be ordered in the case of subsequent discovery of reasons for\r\ninadmissibility to the Reich Labor Service according to Articles 5 or 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 17\r\n\r\n1. Members of the Reich Labor Service who belong to the National\r\nSocialist Party, cannot participate in the activities of the Party or\r\nits sub-divisions.\r\n\r\n2.

The highest authority in the spirit of these regulations is the\r\nReich Labor Leader.\r\n\r\n2. The decisions of the Reich Labor Service concerning the induction\r\n(Articles 5, 6, 7), deferment (Article 8) and dismissal (Articles 12\r\nand 16) are binding for the courts. The same applies to decisions about\r\ntemporary relief of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 24\r\n\r\nThe protection of the incapacitated in performance of the service\r\nand the personnel release after at least ten years of service and\r\ntheir survivors is regulated by the Reich Labor Protection Law\r\n[Reichsarbeitsdienstversorgungsgesetz].\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 25\r\n\r\n1.

Articles 36, 47 and 49 of the Reichs\r\nofficials' law, the law of 4 July 1921 on increased computation of\r\ntime in service accomplished during the war (RGBl p. 825) and the\r\ncorresponding provisions of federal state laws remained unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 9\r\n\r\n1. In the calculation of length of service valid for pension purposes,\r\nexcepting time of service accrued in their last employment, only a term\r\nserved in the Reichs, Federal State, or communal service according\r\nto the existing regulations may be credited to officials dismissed\r\nor retired according to Articles 3 and 4. Also accrediting of this\r\nlength of service is only permissible, if it bears some relationship in\r\npreparation or career to the position last held; such a relationship of\r\nlower career to a higher one is to be regarded as an orderly promotion.\r\nIf the official would have obtained a higher pension by the addition of\r\nlater years of service to time served in an earlier position regularly\r\nobtained by qualifications and preparation, the ruling more favorable\r\nto him takes precedence.\r\n\r\n2. The implementative regulations govern the calculation of time served\r\nwith public corporations and with institutions and undertakings placed\r\nupon the same basis as these public corporations.\r\n\r\n3. Accreditation and certification of time served valid for pension\r\npurposes, which conflict with the carrying out of the provisions of\r\nSection 1, are nullified.\r\n\r\n4. In the case of officials of the Reich and of public corporations,\r\ninstitutions, and agencies under the supervision of the Reich, the\r\nReichsminister of the Interior in agreement with the Reichsminister of\r\nFinance can mitigate hardships; the highest federal state authorities\r\ncan do the same in the case of other officials.\r\n\r\n5. Sections 1 to 4 as well as Article 8 will also be applied to such\r\nofficials who already, before this law came into effect, were retired\r\neither permanently or temporarily upon whom Articles 2 to 4 would have\r\nbeen applied if the officials had been still in service at the time\r\nthis law came into effect. The new accrediting of time of service valid\r\nin the calculation of pensions and the accrediting of pensions and of\r\nwaiting allowances must, at the latest, take place on 30 Sept 1933 with\r\neffect as of 1 Oct 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 10\r\n\r\n1. Guiding principles, which are established for the amount of pay for\r\nofficials will be based upon the calculation of service remunerations\r\nand pension. In case decisions by the competent authorities on the\r\napplying of the guiding principles do not yet exist, they are to be\r\nissued without delay.\r\n\r\n2. After decisions by the competent authorities concerning the\r\napplication of the guiding principle have been made, if officials are\r\nfound to have received higher remunerations than are due them according\r\nto the decisions, they then have to reimburse the surplus amounts\r\nreceived since 1 April 1932 at the pay office where the payments were\r\ngiven out. The argument of no longer existing enrichment (Articles\r\n812vBGB and subs) is excluded.\r\n\r\n3. Subsections 1 and 2 are valid also for persons who have been retired\r\ninside of one year before this law became effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 11.\r\n\r\n1. If, in the accrediting of pay-seniority of officials who leave\r\nthe service on account of Articles 3 and 4, employment outside of\r\nthe Reichs, Federal State, or communal service has been calculated,\r\nthen the pay-seniority is to be newly calculated. Therein only an\r\nemployment in the Reichs, Federal State, or communal service, or\r\naccording to the implementative regulations, in the service of public\r\ncorporations and institutions and undertakings equivalent to the former\r\nmay be accredited. Exceptions can be permitted by the Reichsminister\r\nof the Interior in agreement with the Reichsminister of Finance for\r\nReichs officials; for other officials, by the highest federal state\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n2. If a new accrediting of pay-seniority according to Section 1 comes\r\ninto consideration, then in the case of officials retired or dismissed\r\naccording to Articles 3 and 4, the new determination of pay-seniority\r\nwill be carried out in conjunction with the determination of the\r\npension amount.\r\n\r\n3. The same is valid for the persons named in Article 9, Section 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 12.\r\n\r\n1. The salaries of Reichsministers appointed since 9 Nov 1918, which\r\nare not calculated according to the provisions of Articles 16 to 24 of\r\nthe Reichsminister law of 27 March 1930 (RGBl I P. 96) are to be newly\r\ncalculated. In the new calculation, the above-mentioned provisions of\r\nthe Reichsminister law are to be applied as if they had been already\r\nin effect at the time of the Reichsminister's dismissal from office.\r\nAccording to this law, excess payments received since 1 April 1933 are\r\nto be paid back. The argument of no longer existing enrichment (Article\r\n812 and subs BGB) is inadmissible.\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 will receive application upon the members of the federal\r\nstate government appointed since 9 Nov 1918 with the provision that in\r\nplace of the Reichsminister law the corresponding provisions of the\r\nfederal state law will be in effect; however, payments may only be made\r\nto the amount which results from the application of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of Articles 16 to 24 of the Reichsminister law.\r\n\r\n3. The new calculation of payments must take place before 31 December\r\n1933.\r\n\r\n4. Retroactive payments will not take place.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 13.\r\n\r\nThe survivors payments will be calculated with corresponding\r\napplication of Articles 8 to 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 14.\r\n\r\n1. Against the officials who have been dismissed or transferred upon\r\nthe authority of this law, the institution of civil service punishment\r\nproceedings on account of misdemeanors committed while in office with\r\nthe object of cancellation of pension, survivors benefits, designation\r\nof office, title, official uniform and insignia. The institution of the\r\nproceedings must take place on 31 December 1933 at the latest.\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 is also valid for persons who within one year of the date\r\nthat this law becomes effective have been retired and upon whom the\r\nArticles 2 and 4 would have been applied, if these persons had still\r\nbeen in service when this law came into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 15.\r\n\r\nThe provisions concerning officials will be applied in an appropriate\r\nmanner to employees and workers. The implementative regulations govern\r\ndetailed application.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 16.\r\n\r\nIf unreasonable hardships occur in the carrying out of this law, then\r\nhigher payments or transition money may be granted in accordance with\r\nthe general regulations. The decisions in this matter will be made by\r\nthe Reichsminister of the Interior in agreement with the Reichsminister\r\nof Finance in the case of Reichs officials, in other cases by the\r\nhighest federal state authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 17.\r\n\r\n1. The Reichsminister of the interior will issue in agreement with the\r\nReichsminister of Finance, the necessary regulations for the execution\r\nand carrying through of this law and the general administrative\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n2. If necessary the highest federal state authorities will issue\r\nsupplementary regulations. In this matter they must confine themselves\r\nto the framework of the Reichs regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt. 18.\r\n\r\nWith the expiration of the periods established in this law, the general\r\nprovisions valid for the professional civil services will be again\r\ncompletely valid, without prejudice to the measures taken on the basis\r\nof this law.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 7 April 1933\r\n\r\n  The Reichschancellor\r\n  Adolf Hitler\r\n\r\n  The Reichsminister of the Interior\r\n  Frick\r\n\r\n  The Reichsminister of Finance\r\n  Count Schwerin von Krosigk\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT 1398-PS\r\n\r\n 1933 REICHSGESETZBLATT, PART I, PAGE 433\r\n\r\n Law to Supplement the Law for the Restoration of the Professional\r\n Civil Service of 20 July 1933\r\n\r\nThe Reich government has enacted the following law, which is hereby\r\npromulgated:\r\n\r\nThe Law for the Restoration of Civil Service from 7 April 1933 (RGBl I,\r\npage 175) is supplemented as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

The admission of lawyers who, according to the Law for the\r\nRestoration of the Professional Civil Service, of April 7, 1933 (RGBl,\r\nI 175), are of non-Aryan descent, may be cancelled till September 30,\r\n1933.\r\n\r\nThe provision of clause 1 does not apply to lawyers already admitted\r\nbefore August 1, 1914, or, who, during the World War fought at the\r\nfront for Germany, or her allies, or who lost their fathers or sons in\r\nthe World War.\r\n\r\nArt. 2. Persons who, according to the Law for the Restoration of the\r\nProfessional Civil Service of April 7, 1933 (RGBl. I, p. 175) are of\r\nnon-Aryan descent, may be refused permission to practice law, even if\r\nthere exists none of the reasons enumerated in the Regulations for\r\nLawyers. The same rule applies in cases, as where a lawyer described in\r\nSection 1, clause 2, wishes to be admitted to another court.\r\n\r\nArt. 3. Persons, who were active in the communistic sense are excluded\r\nfrom the admission to the Bar. Admissions already given have to be\r\nrevoked.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. The Justice-Administration can issue an injunction against a\r\nlawyer until it is decided, if use will be made of the right to revoke\r\nthe admission in accordance with Art 1/1, or Art 3. The prescriptions\r\nof Art 9/b/2-4 of the Bar regulation (Reichs-Law-Publication 1933, I,\r\npage 120) apply accordingly to the injunction against representation.\r\n\r\nAgainst lawyers of that type as described in Art. 1/2 the injunction\r\nagainst representation is only then permissible when the use of Art. 3\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\nArt. 5. To revoke the admission to the Bar is considered an important\r\nreason for the cancelling of employment contracts, which were concluded\r\nby the lawyer as employer.\r\n\r\nArt. 6. In case the admission of a lawyer is revoked in accordance\r\nwith this law, then for the cancelling of leases of rooms, which were\r\nrented by the lawyer for himself or his family, the regulations of the\r\nlaw about the cancelling right of persons concerned by the law for the\r\nrenovation of professional bureaucracy, 7 April 1933, (RGBl.

Property of Communists, Enemies of the People and the State\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 1\r\n\r\nIf objects and rights have been seized in favor of a state on the\r\nbasis of the law on the confiscation of communist property of 26 May\r\n33 (RGBl I, page 293) or of the law on the confiscation of property of\r\nenemies of the people and the state of 14 July 1933 (RGBl I, page 479)\r\nbefore the law became effective, the state shall not be responsible for\r\nthe claims which have arisen against the former owner of the seized\r\nproperty or rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 2\r\n\r\n1. Rights, which are still existing at the time this law becomes\r\neffective and apply to confiscated objects, are deemed expired with\r\nthe seizure. The same is true in the case of guarantees on property\r\nwhich has been confiscated.\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 is not being applied if the seized objects have already\r\nbeen sold by the state before this law became effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 3\r\n\r\n1. Corporations are not responsible for liabilities from the time\r\nbefore the confiscation, if all the shares have been transferred by\r\nconfiscation to the property of a state, unless the liabilities were\r\nrecovered by the sequestration decreed for the preparation of the\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\n2. The existing rights of third persons in the property of such\r\ncorporations will be considered as expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 4\r\n\r\nLegal personalities, corporations, or legally incompetent associations,\r\nwhose property has been confiscated, are considered as dissolved by the\r\nseizure. A liquidation does not take place.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 5\r\n\r\nClaims against the owners of property mentioned in Article 4 shall be\r\ndeemed expired through confiscation of the property. The same applies\r\nto individual members or partners of associations. The affidavits and\r\nother liabilities existing in order to insure the safeguarding and\r\nguarantees of such claims are also deemed expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 6\r\n\r\n1. If someone suffered financial loss through sequestration or seizure\r\nof objects and rights on account of the laws mentioned in Article 1, or\r\nthrough their effect, an indemnification from the means of the state in\r\nwhose favor the confiscation or seizure took place can be granted. In\r\nthe sense of this regulation, no one has suffered loss who was affected\r\nby the sequestration or seizure directly.\r\n\r\n2. A person shall not be granted compensation on the basis and with\r\nthe acquisition of this right, which expired with this law, if he has\r\nintentionally or carelessly promoted:\r\n\r\n 1. Communist aspirations.\r\n\r\n 2. Marxist or other movements which have been declared as hostile to\r\n the people and state by the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nIt is not an intentional promotion of aspirations as designated in No.\r\n2, if the victim stood under the control or direction of the state.\r\n\r\n3. An indemnification can also be granted in the cases of (2) No. 2,\r\ni.e. if the victim is needy in the sense of Article 13(2) or if the\r\npredominant viewpoints of the public interest speak for the granting of\r\nindemnification.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7\r\n\r\n1. Indemnification will only be granted if the victim makes a petition\r\nbefore 31 March 1938.\r\n\r\n2. The petition has to be. sent in writing to the competent authority\r\n(Article 9), with reference to the cause of the offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8\r\n\r\n1. The determination of the indemnification takes place in a\r\ndetermination procedure and before determining authorities.\r\n\r\n2. The Reich Minister of the Interior can decree that no determining\r\nprocedures shall take place for certain properties or in certain\r\ndistricts. If such a regulation is issued by the Reich Minister of\r\nthe Interior, the regulations of this section with the exception of\r\nArticles 1, 4 and 5 are not to be applied for the property of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 9\r\n\r\n1. The determining authority in Prussia and Bavaria is the president\r\nof the government (in Berlin the police president), in Saxony the\r\nKreishauptmann, and in the other states the highest authority of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n2. The Reich Minister of the Interior may decide that a common\r\ndetermining authority will be formed for several administrative\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 10\r\n\r\n1. The determining authority for the district in which the sequestered\r\nor seized property, whose indemnification has been proposed, used to\r\nbe, is locally responsible.\r\n\r\n2. The highest authority of the state or the Reich Minister of the\r\nInterior appoints the determining authority, if the property was\r\nlocated in the district of several determining authorities and if\r\nseveral determining authorities of the same state are involved.\r\n\r\n3. The Reich Minister of the Interior is entitled to appoint\r\nexclusively one or more determining authorities for certain kinds of\r\nconfiscated or seized objects and rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 11\r\n\r\n1. The petition to grant indemnification shall be refused, if it has\r\nnot been made within the time determined in Article 7, section 1. The\r\ndetermining authority is obliged to admit the petition, if the victim\r\nproves that he himself or his legal representative or his proxy failed\r\nto make the petition within the appointed period through no fault of\r\ntheir own and inasmuch as it will be repeated within two months after\r\nclearing the obstacle. Petitions cannot be made any more after 31 March\r\n1939.\r\n\r\n2. If the petition to grant indemnification is received by a\r\ndetermining authority, which is locally not responsible (Article 10),\r\nit will fall within the appointed time.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 12\r\n\r\n1. The total amount of indemnifications, which shall be granted because\r\nof sequestration or seizure of property of a certain owner of property,\r\nis limited by the extent of this property. Each economic unit will\r\nbe considered property in the sense of the first sentence, if the\r\nconfiscated property of a person includes several economic units of the\r\nkind designated in Article 2 of the Reichsbewertunsgesetz [Law for the\r\nevaluation of property] of 16 Oct 1934 (RGBl I, page 1035). For the\r\nclassification according to economic units, a determined purpose in the\r\nperiod before the confiscation is of no importance.\r\n\r\n2. In order to estimate the extent of property according to Section 1,\r\nits selling value is decisive.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 13\r\n\r\n1. In determining the indemnifications, the creditors should be\r\ntreated in the succession as is provided for their satisfaction in the\r\nbankruptcy order.\r\n\r\n2. This principle is to be disregarded, if reasons of fairness require\r\nto do so; particularly these victims are to get privileged treatment\r\nwhose livelihood or economic progress is endangered or require an\r\nindemnification in order to fulfill their duties of livelihood on the\r\nbasis of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 14\r\n\r\n1. The determining authority fixes the amount of money to be paid\r\nas indemnification. It can determine installments and the time of\r\npayments. Inasmuch as there is no other clause in the decision of the\r\ndetermining authority, the amount of money is payable to him within one\r\nmonth after the decision has been delivered to the victim.\r\n\r\n2. The determining authority may rule that an indemnification will be\r\neffected by Reich or state-owned mortgage-deeds or by transferring\r\nan object, or that claim of indemnification due to the victim on\r\naccount of the decision of the determining authority will be secured by\r\narranging a lien on land.\r\n\r\n3. The state can propose, until the decision of the determining\r\nauthority has been relayed to the victim, what, in the amount of\r\nthe indemnification which is being granted for an expired lien on\r\nland (Article 2, 6), a new lien on land will be entered into the\r\nland-register in its place. The determining authority has to respect\r\nsuch a move except in the case that this would be particularly unfair\r\ntoward the victim.

Rights on objects of such properties, which have been declared as\r\nforfeited to the Reich, are deemed expired with the declaration of\r\nforfeiture. The same applies to objects on which property rights have\r\nbeen secured.\r\n\r\n2. Section 1 will not be applied, if the objects have already been sold\r\nby the Reich before effectiveness of this law.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 20\r\n\r\nIf someone has suffered a loss of property through sequestration or the\r\ndeclaration of forfeiture (Article 18) or through the effect of this\r\nlaw, he may be granted an indemnification from the funds of the Reich.\r\nThe victim in the sense of this regulation is not he who was directly\r\naffected by the sequestration or declaration of forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 21\r\n\r\nThe regulations of Articles 6 to 17 will be applied respectively\r\naccording to Articles 22 and 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 22\r\n\r\nThe determining authority of the Reich will decide on the petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 23\r\n\r\nAn indemnification will also not be granted (Article 6(2)), if the\r\nvictim has knowingly supported the person deprived of his citizenship\r\nin hurting German interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3.

However, if the legal personality\r\nrepresents a corporation, a limited liability corporation, or company,\r\nthe property administration of the German labor front will only be put\r\nin possession of the shares or business shares; the company continues\r\nits existence with rights and obligations. Sentence 2 is not effective\r\nif the exclusive purpose of the company was the administration of\r\nhouses of labor unions or if a property administration or trustee\r\ncompany of a former association of employers and employees is involved,\r\nthe property of which will be put in possession of the property\r\nadministration of the German labor front as provided in (1).

Inasmuch as the property of a former association of employers and\r\nemployees has already been disposed of through an orderly liquidation\r\nor agreement, it will be left as it is. Pending liquidations and\r\nsettlements will not be continued.\r\n\r\n4. The Reich Minister of the Interior will announce, in agreement with\r\nthe Deputy of the Fuehrer, the Reich Minister of Economy and the Reich\r\nMinister for Labor, the owners of property, possession of which has\r\nbeen transferred to the property administration of the German labor\r\nfront according to (1), (2) first sentence and (2) third sentence.\r\nThese regulations will be announced in the Deutscher Reichsanzeiger and\r\nPreussischer Staatsanzeiger (official publications) until the 30 June\r\n1938.

The German labor front and the property administration of the\r\nGerman labor front are responsible for claims resulting from service\r\nor work status with the owners of property mentioned in Article 24 or\r\nthe German labor front only, if the service or work status has been\r\nextended by the German labor front beyond the 30 Sept 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 26\r\n\r\n1. Rights on objects, which the property administration of the German\r\nlabor front acquires according to Article 24, are expiring. The same\r\napplies to property rights secured in such objects.\r\n\r\n2. Section (1) will not be applied, if the objects have been already\r\nliquidated at the effectiveness of this law or if the rights or the\r\nsecured property have been established after the day to be determined\r\naccording to Article 25 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 27\r\n\r\nIf the victim suffered a loss in property on account of the regulations\r\nof Articles 25 and 26, he can be granted an indemnification from the\r\nfunds of the German labor front and the property administration of the\r\nGerman labor front.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 28\r\n\r\nThe regulations of Articles 5 to 17 will be applied on the basis of\r\nArticles 29 and 30 respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 29\r\n\r\nThe petition to grant an indemnification has to be made in writing by\r\n30 Sept 38 to the determining authority (Article 30) by stating the\r\ncause of the offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 30\r\n\r\n1. The determining authority of the Reich will decide on the motion\r\n(Article 16). The chambers will judge the case in a composition of\r\nthree members including the chairman of whom one member will be\r\nsuggested by the Deputy of the Fuehrer, another one by the Reich\r\nMinister of Economy in conjunction with the Reich Minister for Labor.\r\nThe chairman and the members will be appointed by the Reich Minister of\r\nthe Interior.\r\n\r\n2. Before the decision a representative to be named by the German labor\r\nfront has to be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 31\r\n\r\nInasmuch as economic associations of employers and their institutions\r\nhave been incorporated or joined or dissolved within the framework of\r\nthe legislation on the preliminary erection of the Reich food estate,\r\nthe regulations of this part will not be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4. Final Regulations\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 32\r\n\r\n1. Indemnification will not be granted on the basis of other laws in\r\nthose cases affected by this law. Existing claims expire.\r\n\r\n2. If a party proves by litigation that the pending claim comes under\r\nthis law, the court has to discontinue the procedure and to defer\r\ntemporarily the distraint resulting from an executory decision already\r\nenacted. The court may also issue these regulations under the authority\r\nof the law if it views the pending claim as falling under this law. In\r\nboth cases the court has to inform the proper determining authority by\r\npresenting the records. The rules of the court cannot be contested.\r\n\r\n3. The determining authority may admit the further prosecution of the\r\nclaim by regular legal steps or present the records to the determining\r\nauthority of the Reich for a decision.\r\n\r\n4. If the determining authority or the determining authority of\r\nthe Reich permits the further prosecution of the claim by regular\r\nlegal steps, the court has to lift on request the regulation on the\r\ndiscontinuance of the legal dispute or the temporary suspension of the\r\ndistraint.\r\n\r\n5. The decision of the determining authority of the Reich to deal\r\nwith the claim in a determining procedure does not permit its further\r\nprosecution by legal steps and the distraint of the claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 33\r\n\r\nIf there exists already an executory title on claims which are affected\r\nby this law, the regulations of Article 32 will be applied respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 34\r\n\r\nInasmuch as a legal dispute is being settled by this law, the court\r\ncosts will be cancelled and the extrajudicial costs balanced against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 35\r\n\r\n1. The granting of an indemnification by arbitration will not be\r\nexcluded by the regulations of this law. The determining authority has\r\nto verify the agreement.\r\n\r\n2. If an agreement on the claims and rights affected by this law had\r\nalready been concluded at the time this law became effective, it will\r\nbe left as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 36\r\n\r\n1. If the Reich or a state has transferred confiscated properties\r\nas a whole or in part to another natural or legal personality, the\r\ndetermining authority may impose upon the one who takes possession of\r\nthe property, the duty to give total or partial indemnification to the\r\nentitled persons. In case the Reich or a state will be declared liable\r\nof indemnification, it must at the same time be determined whether and\r\nin what amount the one who takes possession has to pay compensation to\r\nthe Reich or State. The person taking possession of the property has\r\nthe right to appeal against the decision of the determining authority\r\nto the determining authority of the Reich.\r\n\r\n2. Resulting from the valid decisions of the determining authorities,\r\nby which according to (1) obligations will be imposed on the one who\r\ntakes possession, the distraint will be executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 37\r\n\r\nThe decisions of the determining authorities are binding for the\r\nregular courts and other places of judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 38\r\n\r\nArticles 3, 4 and 7 of the law on the confiscation of communist\r\nproperty of 26 May 1933 (RGBl I, p. 293) are no longer valid.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 39\r\n\r\n1. If objects and rights are seized on the basis of the laws designated\r\nin Article 1, the State is responsible for claims against the former\r\nowner of the confiscated objects only with the rights and objects\r\nfallen to it by the confiscation. Rights on objects of seized property\r\ncontinue to exist.\r\n\r\n2. In case of excessive debts, bankruptcy proceedings against the\r\nproperty will be enacted through motion of a state or creditor,\r\naccording to regulations. The referee in bankruptcy has to be appointed\r\nin agreement with the central administration board responsible for the\r\ndistrict of the bankruptcy court and has to be recalled on its request.\r\n\r\n3. The same applies if the property of a person deprived of citizenship\r\n(Article 18) has been declared to fall to the Reich after this law had\r\nbecome effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 40\r\n\r\nThe Reich Minister of the Interior will be authorized to issue\r\nin agreement with the other responsible ministers the legal and\r\nadministrative instruments required in order to execute and supplement\r\nthis law.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, 9 December 1937\r\n\r\n  The Fuehrer and Chancellor of the Reich\r\n  Adolf Hitler\r\n\r\n  The Reich Minister of the Interior\r\n  Frick\r\n\r\n  The Deputy of the Fuehrer\r\n  R.
