Since a direct transliteration would spoil the effect,\r\n  these passages are shown in the simple \"Rotate-13\" code. Details are\r\n  given at the end of the text, before the Errata. A few words of true\r\n  Greek have been transliterated and shown between +marks+. Latin words\r\n  written in Greek script are treated the same way.\r\n\r\n  Letters written in superscript are shown in {braces} or as ordinals:\r\n  A{o} (_Anno_), 5ª (_quinta_). For consistency, the abbreviation f^o\r\n  in manuscript descriptions is shown as fº to match 4º and 8º.\r\n\r\n  Footnotes to the Diary have small letters: [a], [b].

M.A., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present volume contains two curious documents concerning Dr. Dee,\r\nthe eminent philosopher of Mortlake, now for the first time published\r\nfrom the original manuscripts. I. His Private Diary, written in a very\r\nsmall illegible hand on the margins of old Almanacs, discovered a few\r\nyears ago by Mr. W. H. Black, in the library of the Ashmolean Museum at\r\nOxford. II. A Catalogue of his Library of Manuscripts, made by himself\r\nbefore his house was plundered by the populace, and now preserved in the\r\nlibrary of Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this Diary will tend perhaps to set Dee's character\r\nin its true light, more than any thing that has yet been printed. We\r\nhave, indeed, his \"Compendious Rehearsall,\" which is in some respects\r\nmore comprehensive, but this was written for an especial purpose, for\r\nthe perusal of royal commissioners, and he has of course carefully\r\navoided every allusion which could be construed in an unfavourable\r\nlight. In the other, however, he tells us his dreams, talks of\r\nmysterious noises in his chamber, evil spirits, and alludes to\r\nvarious secrets of occult philosophy in the spirit of a true believer.\r\nMr. D'Israeli has given a correct and able view of his character in his\r\n\"Amenities of Literature,\" which is remarkably confirmed in almost every\r\npoint by the narrative now published. \"The imagination of Dee,\" observes\r\nthat elegant writer, \"often predominated over his science; while both\r\nwere mingling in his intellectual habits, each seemed to him to confirm\r\nthe other. Prone to the mystical lore of what was termed the occult\r\nsciences, which in reality are no sciences at all, since whatever\r\nremains occult ceases to be science, Dee lost his better genius.\"\r\nI shall refer the reader to this popular work instead of attempting\r\nan original paper on the subject, which would necessarily be greatly\r\ninferior to that drawn by the masterly hand of the author of the\r\n\"Curiosities of Literature.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue of Dee's Library of Manuscripts, although long since\r\ndispersed, is valuable for the notices which it preserves of several\r\nmiddle-age treatises not now extant. He is said to have expended on this\r\ncollection the sum of three thousand pounds, a very large sum in those\r\ndays for a person of limited income.\r\n\r\n        J. O. H.\r\n  35, Alfred Place,\r\n    March 15th 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. DEE'S DIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1554. Aug. 25th, Barthilmew Hikman born at Shugborowh in\r\nWarwikshyre toward evening.

Treasurer;\r\n  and WILLIAM J. THOMS, Esq. Secretary, for the Year next ensuing.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nDated 1st May, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe Council elected on the 3rd May 1841 are pleased to be able to report\r\nthat the affairs of the Society continue in a condition of unabated\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe number of 1200 Members, to which the Society is limited, has been\r\nmaintained; and there continues to be a large number of Candidates for\r\nadmission upon vacancies.\r\n\r\nThe investment standing in the names of the Trustees for the Society has\r\nbeen increased, since the last General Meeting, from the sum of £408\r\n0_s._ 4_d._, Three per Cent. consols, to £574 13_s._ 8_d._ This increase\r\nhas arisen from the investment of sums received for Compositions; and\r\nthe Council recommend that whatever sum may now be in hand on that\r\naccount, should be added to the investment.\r\n\r\nThe Council have added the following gentlemen to the list of Local\r\nSecretaries:--\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Joseph Bosworth, LL.D. for Nottingham.\r\n\r\n  Richard Rees, Esq. F.S.A. for Cardiff, in the place of\r\n    Captain W. H. Smyth, retired.\r\n\r\n  James Heywood Markland, Esq. F.R.S.

Edited by\r\n  JAMES ORCHARD HALLIWELL, Esq. F.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\nis completed at the press, and will be ready for delivery to the Members\r\nby the end of the present month. The Council have followed the precedent\r\nof former years, in directing that there should be appended to the\r\nlast-mentioned volume a list of the Members of the Society for the past\r\nyear; and, if the General Meeting think proper, this Report and that of\r\nthe Auditors may also be added.\r\n\r\nThe Council have much satisfaction in being able to state that the\r\n\"Apology for the Lollards,\" a work attributed to Wickliffe, which has\r\nbeen so long delayed by reason of the many engagements of the Editor,\r\nthe Rev. Jas. Henthorn Todd, D.D. is now on the eve of completion; and\r\nwill certainly be ready for delivery in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has also been made with the \"Promptorium,\" a Latin\r\nand English Dictionary of words in use during the fifteenth century,\r\nediting by Albert Way, Esq. F.S.A. a work which the Council believe will\r\nbe one of great merit and utility; and a portion of it will be one of\r\nthe publications of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nBesides the Apology for the Lollards and the Promptuary, the following\r\nworks have been ordered to be put to press at the convenience of their\r\nEditors and the Society, and will be published as soon as they are\r\nready.\r\n\r\n  A Collection of Original Letters and Papers of Literary Men of\r\n  England during the Reigns of Elizabeth and James I., including some\r\n  Unpublished Papers of Camden. To be edited by SIR HENRY ELLIS, K.H.,\r\n  F.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n  Latin Romance Narratives and Legends of the thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\n  and fifteenth Centuries, relating to King Arthur and other Heroes of\r\n  the Welsh and Breton cycle of Fiction. To be edited by Sir FREDERIC\r\n  MADDEN, K.H., F.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n  Letters and State Papers relating to the Proceedings of the Earl of\r\n  Leicester in the Low Countries, in the years 1585 and 1586, derived\r\n  from a MS. placed at the disposal of the Society by Frederick Ouvry,\r\n  Esq. and other sources. To be edited by JOHN BRUCE, Esq. F.S.A.\r\n\r\n  The Private Diary of Thomas Cartwright, Bishop of Chester, temp.\r\n  James II.\r\n\r\n  The Romance of Jean and Blonde of Oxford, by Philippe de Reims, an\r\n  Anglo-Norman Poet, of the latter end of the twelfth Century.

LE ROUX\r\n  DE LINCY, editor of the Roman de Brut.\r\n\r\nThe Council have added the following works to the list of Suggested\r\nPublications--\r\n\r\n  A Collection of Original Letters relating to the Dissolution of the\r\n  Monasteries and some other points connected with the Reformation.\r\n  To be edited by THOMAS WRIGHT, Esq.

To be edited by\r\n  JOHN GOUGH NICHOLS, Esq. F.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe Council have to direct the attention of the Society to the\r\nobligations conferred upon it by J. I. Blackburne, Esq. M.P. by giving\r\nthe Society the use of the MS. of the Three Romances, edited by Mr.\r\nRobson.\r\n\r\nAlso by the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, in placing in Mr. Way's hands,\r\nupon the application of the Director, his valuable early printed\r\neditions of the \"Promptorium,\" which Mr. Way wished to use for his\r\nedition of that work; and by the Master and Fellows of Saint Peter's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, for the readiness with which, upon a similar\r\napplication, they lent the Council, for the use of Mr. Way, a valuable\r\nMS., entitled Campus Florum.\r\n\r\nThe same exertions, in behalf of the Society, which former Councils have\r\nacknowledged, have been continued to be made by the Local Secretaries,\r\nand other friends of the Society resident in the country; and the\r\nCouncil trust that such exertions will not be relaxed. To diffuse a\r\nknowledge of the existence and objects of the Society tends, not merely\r\nto promote its welfare, but also to carry out the purpose for which it\r\nwas established, by directing the attention of the possessors of MSS. to\r\nthose collections in which there yet exist, unpublished, inestimable\r\npapers which this Society would be ready and willing to make available.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nichols have continued to the Council the same attentions, and\r\nhave rendered them the same valuable and gratuitous assistance in the\r\ngeneral management of the affairs of the Society, which they have given\r\nfrom its Institution. Nothing can be more honourable to Messrs. Nichols,\r\nor more advantageous to the Society; and the Council are assured, that\r\nit is only necessary for them to state the fact to the Members, in order\r\nto its being duly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Council have to regret the loss, by death, during the last year, of\r\nthe Rt. Hon. THOS. P. COURTENAY, who, in addition to valuable services\r\nas a Member of the Council, was one of the Trustees of the Society, and\r\ngave much attention to its affairs. The Council have filled up the\r\nvacancy in the Trusteeship by electing to that office CHARLES PURTON\r\nCOOPER, Esq. LL.D., Q.C., F.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe Council have also to regret the death of HENRY BOWER, Esq. F.S.A.\r\nthe very zealous and efficient Local Secretary of the Society at\r\nDoncaster; and also of the following other Members:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS BARNES, Esq.\r\n  GEORGE FREDERICK BELTZ, Esq. F.S.A. Lancaster Herald.\r\n  HENRY EYTON, Esq.\r\n  The Rev. THOMAS DUDLEY FOSBROKE, F.S.A.\r\n  F. T. GRAYLING, Esq.\r\n  Lieut.-Col. JOHN HARVEY.\r\n  JOHN HOLMES, Esq. F.S.A. East Retford.\r\n  THEODORE EDWARD HOOK, Esq. F.S.A.\r\n  HENRY MITCHISON, Esq.\r\n  JOHN MOORE, Esq. F.S.A.\r\n  The Right Hon. the Earl of MUNSTER, F.R.S., Pr.As.S.\r\n  The Rev. GEORGE FREDERICK NOTT, D.D., F.S.A.\r\n  EDWARD SKEGG, Esq. F.R.G.S.\r\n  JOHN SYDNEY TAYLOR, Esq.\r\n  Lieut.-Gen. WILLIAM THORNTON.\r\n  HENRY WOODTHORPE, Esq. F.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe Council report that the Treasurer, having found that other\r\nengagements prevented his any longer devoting to the accounts and\r\nfinancial correspondence of the Society the time and attention which,\r\nafter an experience of three years, he found to be absolutely necessary\r\nto be given to them, submitted to the Council the propriety of their\r\naccepting his resignation, or of making some other arrangement with\r\nrespect to the accounts. The Council, regarding the subject as one\r\nvitally affecting the welfare of the Society, proceeded immediately to\r\ntake it into their consideration, and are happy to be able to report\r\nthat they have effected an arrangement by which the accounts are now\r\nkept, and the financial correspondence is attended to, by the Secretary,\r\nthe Treasurer still continuing responsible to the Society. This\r\narrangement will put the Society to a small annual expense, which can\r\nvery well be afforded, and which the Council are persuaded the Members\r\nwill think well bestowed, if it has the effect of preserving accuracy in\r\nthe accounts. The recent arrangements in the Post Office render it easy\r\nfor country Members to transmit their subscriptions by Post Office\r\norders, which course the Council recommend to be adopted, making the\r\nPost Office orders payable to the Treasurer.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of four years of continuing prosperity the Council hope\r\nthat the Camden Society may be regarded as having taken a permanent\r\nstation amongst established publishing associations. Many societies have\r\nbeen founded upon similar principles, and one considerably out-numbers\r\nthis Society in Members: but there is no one which can produce better\r\nevidences of stability and prosperity, or which has greater reason to be\r\nsatisfied with the estimation in which its works are regarded by the\r\npublic. Amongst the Candidates for admission recently entered there are\r\nmany Public Libraries and other bodies, whose desire to participate in\r\nthe advantages of Membership indicates the reputation of the Society,\r\nboth in this and other countries; and the prices maintained by our books\r\nwhen copies get abroad into the market, afford encouraging proof of the\r\ndemand for them on the part of collectors and literary men. In four\r\nyears the Society has issued eighteen volumes, all of them works\r\nexcluded from the ordinary mode of publication, and yet worthy of being\r\npublished, of eminent use to historical inquirers, and likely to retain\r\na place in the permanent literature of the country.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming works are fully calculated to maintain, if not to\r\nincrease, the reputation of the Society, and the Council see no reason\r\nto doubt but that the Society may long usefully and prosperously retain\r\nits station, and the number of its Members.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE AUDITORS,\r\n\r\nDated 30th April, 1842.\r\n\r\nWe, the Auditors appointed to audit the Accounts of the Camden Society,\r\nreport to the Society, that the Treasurer has exhibited to us his\r\naccounts, from the 27th day of April, 1841, to the 30th day of April,\r\n1842, and that we have examined the same, together with the vouchers\r\nrelating thereto, and find the same to be correct and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAnd we further report that the following is a correct Abstract of the\r\nReceipts and Expenditure of the Society during the period to which we\r\nhave referred.\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note:\r\n\r\n  The following Abstract was originally printed in two columns.

The adoption of this course has been suggested by several\r\nof the Local Secretaries; and it is obvious that it will greatly lessen\r\nthe troublesome and not very agreeable duties, which are thrown upon\r\nthose officers by the present practice, will lessen the number of\r\nmistakes, and will greatly promote the prosperity of the Society.\r\n\r\nDated the 30th April, 1842.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\n  LANCELOT SHARPE.\r\n  B.
