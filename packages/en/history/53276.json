The “Clog” or “Perpetual Almanack” having been in common use with our\r\nancient ancestors, a representation and explanation of it seemed\r\nrequisite among the various accounts of manners and customs related in\r\nthe order of the calendar.\r\n\r\nOf the word “clog,” there is no satisfactory etymology in the sense here\r\nused, which signifies an almanack made upon a square stick. Dr. Robert\r\nPlot, who published the “History of Staffordshire,” in 1686, instances a\r\nvariety of these old almanacks then in use in that county. Some he calls\r\n“public,” because they were of a large size, and commonly hung at one\r\nend of the mantle-tree of the chimney; others he calls “private,”\r\nbecause they were smaller, and carried in the pocket. For the better\r\nunderstanding of the figures on these clogs, he caused a family clog “to\r\nbe represented _in plano_, each angle of the square stick, with the\r\nmoiety of each of the flat sides belonging to it, being expressed\r\napart.” From this clog, so represented in Dr. Plot’s history, the\r\nengraving is taken which forms the frontispiece now, on his authority,\r\nabout to be described.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 months contained upon each of the four edges; the number of\r\nthe days in them are represented by the notches; that which begins each\r\nmonth has a short spreading stroke turned up from it; every seventh\r\nnotch is of a larger size, and stands for Sunday, (or rather, perhaps,\r\nfor the first day of each successive natural week in the year.)\r\n\r\nAgainst many of the notches there are placed on the _left_ hand several\r\nmarks or symbols denoting the golden number or cycle of the Moon, which\r\nnumber if under 5, is represented by so many points, or dots; but if 5,\r\na line is drawn from the notch, or day, it belongs to, with a hook\r\nreturned back against the course of the line, which, if cut off at due\r\ndistance, may be taken for a V, the numeral signifying 5. If the golden\r\nnumber be above 5, and under 10, it is then marked out by the hooked\r\nline, which is 5; and with one point, which makes 6; or two, which makes\r\n7; or three, for 8; or four, for 9; the said line being crossed with a\r\nbroad stroke spreading at each end, which represents an X, when the\r\ngolden number for the day, over against which it is put, is 10; points\r\nbeing added (as above over the hook for 5,) till the number arises to\r\n15, when a hook is placed again at the end of the line above the X, to\r\nshow us that number.\r\n\r\nThe figures issuing from the notches, towards the _right_ hand, are\r\nsymbols or hieroglyphics, of either, 1st, the offices, or endowments of\r\nthe saints, before whose festivals they are placed; or 2dly, the manner\r\nof their martyrdoms; or 3dly, their actions, or the work or sport, in\r\nfashion about the time when their feasts are kept.\r\n\r\nFor instance: 1. from the notch which represents January 13th, on the\r\nfeast of St. Hilary, issues a cross or badge of a bishop, as St. Hilary\r\nwas; from March 1st, a harp, showing the feast of St. David, by that\r\ninstrument; from June 29th, the keys for St. Peter, reputed the Janitor\r\nof heaven; from October 25th, a pair of shoes for St. Crispin, the\r\npatron of shoe-makers. Of class 2, are the axe against January 25th, the\r\nfeast of St. Paul, who was beheaded with an axe; the sword against June\r\n24th, the feast of St. John Baptist, who was beheaded; the gridiron\r\nagainst August 10th, the feast of St. Lawrence, who suffered martyrdom\r\non one; a wheel on the 25th of November, for St. Catherine, and a\r\ndecussated cross on the last of that month, for St. Andrew, who are said\r\nalso to have suffered death by such instruments. Of the 3d kind, are the\r\nstar on the 6th of January, to denote the Epiphany; a true lover’s knot\r\nagainst the 14th of February, for Valentine’s-day; a bough against the\r\n2d of March, for St. Ceadda, who lived a Hermit’s life in the woods near\r\nLitchfield; a bough on the 1st of May, for the May-bush, then usually\r\nset up with great solemnity; and a rake on the 11th of June, St.\r\nBarnabas’-day, importing that then it is hay-harvest. So, a pot is set\r\nagainst the 23d of November, for the feast of St. Clement, from the\r\nancient custom of going about that night to beg drink to make merry\r\nwith: for the purification, annunciation, and all other feasts of our\r\nlady, there is always the figure of a heart: and lastly, for December\r\n25th, or Christmas-day, a horn, the ancient vessel in which the Danes\r\nuse to wassail, or drink healths; signifying to us, that this is the\r\ntime we ought to rejoice and make merry.\r\n\r\nII. Respecting this second volume of the _Every-Day Book_, it is\r\nscarcely necessary to say more than that it has been conducted with the\r\nsame desire and design as the preceding volume; and that it contains a\r\nmuch greater variety of original information concerning manners and\r\ncustoms. I had so devoted myself to this main object, as to find no lack\r\nof materials for carrying it further; nor were my correspondents, who\r\nhad largely increased, less communicative: but there were some readers\r\nwho thought the work ought to have been finished in one volume, and\r\nothers, who were not inclined to follow beyond a second; and their\r\napprehensions that it could not, or their wishes that it should not be\r\ncarried further, constrained me to close it. As an “Everlasting\r\nCalendar” of amusements, sports, and pastimes, incident to the year, the\r\n_Every-Day Book_ is complete; and I venture, without fear of disproof,\r\nto affirm, that there is not such a copious collection of pleasant facts\r\nand illustrations, “for daily use and diversion,” in the language; nor\r\nare any other volumes so abundantly stored with original designs, or\r\nwith curious and interesting subjects so meritoriously engraven.\r\n\r\nIII. Every thing that I wished to bring into the _Every-Day Book_, but\r\nwas compelled to omit from its pages, in order to conclude it within\r\nwhat the public would deem a reasonable size, I purpose to introduce in\r\nmy _Table Book_. In that publication, I have the satisfaction to find\r\nmyself aided by many of my “_Every-Day_” correspondents, to whom I\r\ntender respectful acknowledgments and hearty thanks. This is the more\r\ndue to them here, because I frankly confess that to most I owe letters;\r\nI trust that those who have not been noticed as they expected, will\r\nimpute the neglect to any thing rather than insensibility of my\r\nobligations to them, for their valuable favours.\r\n\r\nAlthough I confess myself to have been highly satisfied by the general\r\nreception of the _Every-Day Book_, and am proud of the honour it has\r\nderived from individuals of high literary reputation, yet there is one\r\nclass whose approbation I value most especially. The “mothers of\r\nEngland” have been pleased to entertain it as an every-day assistant in\r\ntheir families; and instructors of youth, of both sexes, have placed it\r\nin school-libraries:--this ample testimonial, that, while engaged in\r\nexemplifying “manners,” I have religiously adhered to “morals,” is the\r\nmost gratifying reward I could hope to receive.\r\n\r\n  _February, 1827._\r\n\r\n  W. HONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  EVERY-DAY BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JANUARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n        Then came old January, wrapped well\r\n        In many weeds to keep the cold away;\r\n        Yet did he quake and quiver like to quell,\r\n        And blow his nayles to warm them if he may;\r\n        For they were numb’d with holding all the day\r\n        An hatchet keene, with which he felled wood,\r\n        And from the trees did lop the needlesse spray;\r\n        Upon a huge great earth-pot steane he stood,\r\n    From whose wide mouth there flowed forth the Romane flood.\r\n\r\n  _Spenser_\r\n\r\n~Laus Deo!~--was the first entry by merchants and tradesmen of our\r\nforefathers’ days, in beginning their new account-books with the new\r\nyear. LAUS DEO! then, be the opening of this volume of the _Every-Day\r\nBook_, wherein we take further “note of time,” and make entries to the\r\ndays, and months, and seasons, in “every varied posture, place, and\r\nhour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJANUARY, besides the names already mentioned,[1] was called by the\r\nAnglo-Saxons _Giuli aftera_, signifying the second _Giul_, or _Yule_,\r\nor, as we should say, the second Christmas.[2] Of _Yule_ itself much\r\nwill be observed, when it can be better said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this month there is an ode with a verse beautifully descriptive of\r\nthe Roman symbol of the year:[3]\r\n\r\n    ’Tis he! the two-fac’d Janus comes in view;\r\n      Wild hyacinths his robe adorn,\r\n      And snow-drops, rivals of the morn\r\n        He spurns the goat aside,\r\n        But smiles upon the new\r\n        Emerging year with pride:\r\n      And now unlocks, with agate key,\r\n      The ruby gates of orient day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nMr. Luke Howard is the author of a highly useful work, entitled “The\r\nClimate of London, deduced from Meteorological Observations, made at\r\ndifferent places in the neighbourhood of the Metropolis: London, 1818.”\r\n2 vols. 8vo. Out of this magazine of fact it is proposed to extract,\r\nfrom time to time, certain results which may acquaint general readers\r\nwith useful knowledge concerning the weather of our latitude, and induce\r\nthe inquisitive to resort to Mr. Howard’s book, as a careful guide of\r\nhigh authority in conducting their researches. That gentleman, it is\r\nhoped, will not deem this an improper use of his labours: it is meant to\r\nbe, as far as regards himself, a humble tribute to his talents and\r\ndiligence. With these views, under each month will be given a state of\r\nthe weather, in Mr. Howard’s own words: and thus we begin.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY WEATHER\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ in the middle of this month continues about 8 h. 20 m. above\r\nthe horizon. The _Temperature_ rises in the day, on an average of\r\ntwenty years, to 40·28° and falls in the night, in the open country to\r\n31·36°--the difference, 8·92°, representing the mean effect of the sun’s\r\nrays for the month, may be termed the _solar variation_ of the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe _Mean Temperature_ of the month, if the observations in this city be\r\nincluded, is 36·34°. But this mean has a range, in ten years, of about\r\n10·25°, which may be termed the _lunar variation_ of the temperature. It\r\nholds equally in the decade, beginning with 1797, observed in London,\r\nand in that beginning with 1807, in the country. In the former decade,\r\nthe month was coldest in 1802, and warmest in 1812, and coldest in 1814.\r\nI have likewise shown, that there was a tendency in the _daily_\r\nvariation of temperature through this month, to proceed, in these\r\nrespective periods of years, in opposite directions. The prevalence of\r\ndifferent classes of winds, in the different periods, is the most\r\nobvious cause of these periodical variations of the mean temperature.\r\n\r\nThe _Barometer_ in this month rises, on an average of ten years, to\r\n30·40 in., and falls to 28·97 in.: the _mean range_ is therefore 1·43\r\nin.; but the extreme range in ten years is 2·38 in. The mean height for\r\nthe month is about 29·79 inches.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing _Winds_ are the class from west to north. The northerly\r\npredominate, by a fourth of their amount, over the southerly winds.\r\n\r\nThe average _Evaporation_ (on a total of 30·50 inches for the year) is\r\n0·832 in., and the mean of De Luc’s hydrometer 80.\r\n\r\nThe mean _Rain_, at the surface of the earth, is 1·959 in.; and the\r\nnumber of days on which snow or rain falls, in this month, averages\r\n14,4.\r\n\r\nA majority of the _Nights_ in this month have constantly the temperature\r\nat or below the foregoing point.[4]\r\n\r\n    Long ere the lingering dawn of that blythe morn\r\n    Which ushers in the year, the roosting cock,\r\n    Flapping his wings, repeats his larum shrill;\r\n    But on that morn no busy flail obeys\r\n    His rousing call; no sounds but sounds of joy\r\n    Salute the ear--the first-foot’s[5] entering step,\r\n    That sudden on the floor is welcome heard,\r\n    Ere blushing maids have braided up their hair;\r\n    The laugh, the hearty kiss, the _good new year_\r\n    Pronounced with honest warmth. In village, grange,\r\n    And burrow town, the steaming flaggon, borne\r\n    From house to house, elates the poor man’s heart,\r\n    And makes him feel that life has still its joys.\r\n    The aged and the young, man, woman, child,\r\n    Unite in social glee; even stranger dogs,\r\n    Meeting with bristling back, soon lay aside\r\n    Their snarling aspect, and in sportive chace,\r\n    Excursive scour, or wallow in the snow.\r\n    With sober cheerfulness, the grandam eyes\r\n    Her offspring round her, all in health and peace;\r\n    And, thankful that she’s spared to see this day\r\n    Return once more, breathes low a secret prayer,\r\n    That God would shed a blessing on their heads.\r\n\r\n  _Grahame_\r\n\r\n  [1] In vol. i. p. 2.\r\n\r\n  [2] Sayers.\r\n\r\n  [3] See vol. i. p. 1.\r\n\r\n  [4] Howard on Climate.\r\n\r\n  [5] The first visitant who enters a house on New-year’s day is called\r\n  the _first-foot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 1.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Saints of the Roman calendars and martyrologies._\r\n\r\nSo far as the rev. Alban Butler, in his every-day biography of Roman\r\ncatholic saints, has written their memoirs, their names have been given,\r\ntogether with notices of some, and especially of those retained in the\r\ncalendar of the church of England from the Romish calendar. Similar\r\nnotices of others will be offered in continuation; but, on this high\r\nfestival in the calendar of nature, particular or further remark on the\r\nsaints’ festivals would interrupt due attention to the season, and\r\ntherefore we break from them to observe that day which all enjoy in\r\ncommon,\r\n\r\n\r\n~New Year’s Day.~\r\n\r\nReferring for the “New-year’s gifts,” the “Candlemas-bull,” and various\r\nobservances of our ancestors and ourselves, to the first volume of this\r\nwork, wherein they are set forth “in lively pourtraieture,” we stop a\r\nmoment to peep into the “Mirror of the Months,” and inquire “Who can see\r\na new year open upon him, without being better for the prospect--without\r\nmaking sundry wise reflections (for _any_ reflections on this subject\r\n_must_ be comparatively wise ones) on the step he is about to take\r\ntowards the goal of his being? Every first of January that we arrive at,\r\nis an imaginary mile-stone on the turnpike track of human life; at once\r\na resting place for thought and meditation, and a starting point for\r\nfresh exertion in the performance of our journey. The man who does not\r\nat least _propose to himself_ to be better _this_ year than he was last,\r\nmust be either very good, or very bad indeed! And only to _propose_ to\r\nbe better, is something; if nothing else, it is an acknowledgment of our\r\n_need_ to be so, which is the first step towards amendment. But, in\r\nfact, to propose to oneself to do well, is in some sort to _do_ well,\r\npositively; for there is no such thing as a stationary point in human\r\nendeavours; he who is not worse to-day than he was yesterday, is better;\r\nand he who is not better, is worse.”\r\n\r\nIt is written, “Improve your time,” in the text-hand set of copies put\r\nbefore us when we were better taught to write than to understand what we\r\nwrote. How often these three words recurred at that period without their\r\nmeaning being discovered! How often and how serviceably they have\r\nrecurred since to some who have obeyed the injunction! How painful has\r\nreflection been to others, who recollecting it, preferred to _suffer_\r\nrather than to _do_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of the paragraph quoted above, expresses forcible remembrance\r\nof his youthful pleasures on the coming in of the new year.--“Hail! to\r\nthee, JANUARY!--all hail! cold and wintry as thou art, if it be but in\r\nvirtue of thy first day. THE DAY, as the French call it, _par\r\nexcellence_, ‘Le jour de l’an.’ Come about me, all ye little schoolboys\r\nthat have escaped from the unnatural thraldom of your taskwork--come\r\ncrowding about me, with your untamed hearts shouting in your unmodulated\r\nvoices, and your happy spirits dancing an untaught measure in your eyes!\r\nCome, and help me to speak the praises of new-year’s day!--_your_\r\nday--one of the three which have, of late, become yours almost\r\nexclusively, and which have bettered you, and have been bettered\r\nthemselves, by the change. Christmay-day, which _was_; New-year’s-day,\r\nwhich _is_; and Twelfth-day, which _is to be_; let us compel them all\r\nthree into our presence--with a whisk of our imaginative wand convert\r\nthem into one, as the conjurer does his three glittering balls--and then\r\nenjoy them all together,--with their dressings, and coachings, and\r\nvisitings, and greetings, and gifts, and “many happy returns”--with\r\ntheir plum-puddings, and mince-pies, and twelfth-cakes, and\r\nneguses--with their forfeits, and fortune-tellings, and\r\nblindman’s-buffs, and sittings up to supper--with their pantomimes, and\r\npanoramas, and new penknives, and pastrycooks’ shops--in short, with\r\ntheir endless round of ever new nothings, the absence of a relish for\r\nwhich is but ill supplied, in after life, by that feverish lingering and\r\nthirsting after excitement, which usurp without filling its place. Oh!\r\nthat I might enjoy those nothings once again in fact, as I can in fancy!\r\nBut I fear the wish is worse than an idle one; for it not only may not\r\nbe, but it ought not to be. “We cannot have our cake and eat it too,” as\r\nthe vulgar somewhat vulgarly, but not less shrewdly, express it. And\r\nthis is as it should be; for if we could, it would neither be worth the\r\neating nor the having.”[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASSAIL!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Wassail Bowl.\r\n\r\n    Health, my lord king, the sweet Rowena said,\r\n    Health, cry’d the chieftain, to the Saxon maid;\r\n    Then gayly rose, and ’midst the concourse wide,\r\n    Kiss’d her hale lips, and plac’d her by his side:\r\n    At the soft scene such gentle thoughts abound,\r\n    That health and kisses ’mongst the guests went round;\r\n    From this the social custom took its rise,\r\n    We still retain, and must for ever prize.\r\n\r\nNow, on New-year’s-day as on the previous eve, the wassail bowl is\r\ncarried from door to door, with singing and merriment. In Devonshire,\r\n\r\n    A massy bowl, to deck the jovial day,\r\n    Flash’d from its ample round a sunlike ray.\r\n    Full many a cent’ry it shone forth to grace\r\n    The festive spirit of th’ Andarton race,\r\n    As, to the sons of sacred union dear,\r\n    It welcomed with _lambs’ wool_ the rising year.\r\n\r\n  _Polwhele._\r\n\r\nMr. Brand says, “It appears from Thomas de la Moore,[7] and old\r\nHavillan,[8] that _was-haile_ and _drinc-heil_ were the usual ancient\r\nphrases of quaffing among the English, and synonymous with the ‘Come,\r\nhere’s to you,’ and ‘I’ll pledge you,’ of the present day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the “Antiquarian Repertory,” a large assemblage of curious\r\ncommunications, published by Mr. Jeffery, of Pall-mall, in 4 vols. 4to.\r\nthere is the following paper relating to an ancient carving represented\r\nin that work, from whence the above engraving is taken. The verses\r\nbeneath it are a version of the old lines in Robert of Gloucester’s\r\nchronicle, by Mr. Jeffery’s correspondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For the Antiquarian Repertory._\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Berlen, near Snodland, in the county of Kent, are the\r\nvestiges of a very old mansion, known by the name of Groves. Being on\r\nthe spot before the workmen began to pull down the front, I had the\r\ncuriosity to examine its interior remains, when, amongst other things\r\nwell worth observation, appeared in the large oak beam that supported\r\nthe chimney-piece, a curious piece of carved work, of which the\r\n_preceding_ is an exact copy. Its singularity induced me to set about an\r\ninvestigation, which, to my satisfaction, was not long without success.\r\nThe large bowl in the middle is the figure of the old wassell-bowl, so\r\nmuch the delight of our hardy ancestors, who, on the vigil of the new\r\nyear, never failed (says my author) to assemble round the glowing\r\nhearth with their cheerful neighbours, and then in the spicy\r\nwassell-bowl (which testifies the goodness of their hearts) drowned\r\nevery former animosity--an example worthy modern imitation. Wassell, was\r\nthe word; Wassell, every guest returned as he took the circling goblet\r\nfrom his friend, whilst song and civil mirth brought in the infant year.\r\nThis annual custom, says Geoffrey of Monmouth, had its rise from Rouix,\r\nor Rowen, or as some will have it, Rowena, daughter of the Saxon\r\nHengist; she, at the command of her father, who had invited the British\r\nking Voltigern to a banquet, came in the presence with a bowl of wine,\r\nand welcomed him in these words, Louerd king wass-heil; he in return, by\r\nthe help of an interpreter, answered, Drinc heile; and, if we may credit\r\nRobert of Gloster,\r\n\r\n    ~Ruste hire and sitte hire adoune and glad dronke hire heil\r\n    And that was tho in this land the verst was-hail\r\n    As in language of Saroyne that we might evere iwite\r\n    And so well he paith the fole about, that he is yut vorgute.~\r\n\r\nThomas De Le Moor, in his “Life of Edward the Second,” says partly the\r\nsame as Robert of Gloster, and only adds, that Wass-haile and Drinc-hail\r\nwere the usual phrases of quaffing amongst the earliest civilized\r\ninhabitants of this island.\r\n\r\nThe two birds upon the bowl did for some time put me to a stand, till\r\nmeeting with a communicative person at Hobarrow, he assured me they were\r\ntwo hawks, as I soon plainly perceived by their bills and beaks, and\r\nwere a rebus of the builder’s name. There was a string from the neck of\r\none bird to the other, which, it is reasonable to conjecture, was to\r\nnote that they must be joined together to show their signification;\r\nadmitting this, they were to be red hawks. Upon inquiry, I found a Mr.\r\nHenry Hawks, the owner of a farm adjoining to Groves; he assured me, his\r\nfather kept Grove farm about forty years since, and that it was built by\r\none of their name, and had been in his family upwards of four hundred\r\nyears, as appeared by an old lease in his possession.\r\n\r\nThe apple branches on each side of the bowl, I think, means no more than\r\nthat they drank good cider at their Wassells. Saxon words at the\r\nextremities of the beam are already explained; and the mask carved\r\nbrackets beneath correspond with such sort of work before the\r\nfourteenth century.\r\n\r\n  T. N.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following pleasant old song, inserted by Mr. Brand, from Ritson’s\r\ncollection of “Antient Songs,” was met with by the Editor of the\r\n_Every-day Book_, in 1819, at the printing-office of Mr. Rann, at\r\nDudley, printed by him for the Wassailers of Staffordshire and\r\nWarwickshire. It went formerly to the tune of “_Gallants come away_.”\r\n\r\nA CARROLL FOR A WASSELL-BOWL.\r\n\r\n    A jolly Wassel-Bowl,\r\n      A Wassel of good ale,\r\n    Well fare the butler’s soul,\r\n      That setteth this to sale;\r\n                      Our jolly Wassel.\r\n\r\n    Good Dame, here at your door\r\n      Our Wassel we begin,\r\n    We are all maidens poor,\r\n      We pray now let us in,\r\n                      With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    Our Wassel we do fill\r\n      With apples and with spice,\r\n    Then grant us your good will\r\n      To taste here once or twice\r\n                      Of our good Wassel.\r\n\r\n    If any maidens be\r\n      Here dwelling in this house,\r\n    They kindly will agree\r\n      To take a full carouse\r\n                      Of our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    But here they let us stand\r\n      All freezing in the cold;\r\n    Good master, give command,\r\n      To enter and be bold,\r\n                      With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    Much joy into this hall\r\n      With us is entered in,\r\n    Our master first of all,\r\n      We hope will now begin,\r\n                      Of our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    And after his good wife\r\n      Our spiced bowl will try,\r\n    The Lord prolong your life,\r\n      Good fortune we espy,\r\n                      For our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    Some bounty from your hands,\r\n      Our Wassel to maintain.\r\n    We’ll buy no house nor lands\r\n      With that which we do gain,\r\n                      With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    This is our merry night\r\n      Of choosing King and Queen,\r\n    Then be it your delight\r\n      That something may be seen\r\n                      In our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    It is a noble part\r\n      To bear a liberal mind,\r\n    God bless our master’s heart,\r\n      For here we comfort find,\r\n                      With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    And now we must be gone,\r\n      To seek out more good cheer;\r\n    Where bounty will be shown,\r\n      As we have found it here,\r\n                      With our Wassel.\r\n\r\n    Much joy betide them all,\r\n      Our prayers shall be still,\r\n    We hope and ever shall,\r\n      For this your great good will,\r\n                      To our Wassel.\r\n\r\nFrom the “Wassail” we derive, perhaps, a feature by which we are\r\ndistinguished. An Englishman eats no more than a Frenchman; but he makes\r\n_yule_-tide of all the year. In virtue of his forefathers, he is given\r\nto “strong drink.” He is a beer-drinker, an enjoyer of “fat ale;” a\r\nlover of the best London porter and double XX, and discontented unless\r\nhe can get “stout.” He is a sitter withal. Put an Englishman “behind a\r\npipe” and a full pot, and he will sit till he cannot stand. At first he\r\nis silent; but as his liquor gets towards the bottom, he inclines\r\ntowards conversation; as he replenishes, his coldness thaws, and he is\r\nconversational; the oftener he calls to “fill again,” the more talkative\r\nhe becomes; and when thoroughly liquefied, his loquacity is deluging.\r\nHe is thus in public-house parlours: he is in parties somewhat higher,\r\nmuch the same. The business of dinner draws on the greater business of\r\ndrinking, and the potations are strong and fiery; full-bodied port, hot\r\nsherry, and ardent spirits. This occupation consumes five or six hours,\r\nand sometimes more, after dining. There is no rising from it, but to\r\ntoss off the glass, and huzza after the “hip! hip! hip!” of the toast\r\ngiver. A calculation of the number who customarily “dine out” in this\r\nmanner half the week, would be very amusing, if it were illustrated by\r\nportraits of some of the indulgers. It might be further, and more\r\nusefully, though not so agreeably illustrated, by the reports of\r\nphysicians, wives, and nurses, and the bills of apothecaries. Habitual\r\nsitting to drink is the “besetting sin” of Englishmen--the creator of\r\ntheir gout and palsy, the embitterer of their enjoyments, the\r\nimpoverisher of their property, the widow-maker of their wives.\r\n\r\nBy continuing the “wassail” of our ancestors, we attempt to cultivate\r\nthe body as they did; but we are other beings, cultivated in other ways,\r\nwith faculties and powers of mind that would have astonished their\r\ngenerations, more than their robust frames, if they could appear, would\r\nastonish ours. Their employment was in hunting their forests for food,\r\nor battling in armour with risk of life and limb. They had no\r\ncounting-houses, no ledgers, no commerce, no Christmas bills, no\r\nletter-writing, no printing, no engraving, no bending over the desk, no\r\n“wasting of the midnight oil” and the brain together, no financing, not\r\na hundredth part of the relationships in society, nor of the cares that\r\n_we_ have, who “wassail” as they did, and wonder we are not so strong as\r\nthey were. There were no Popes nor Addisons in the days of Nimrod.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect fragment of the “wassail” exists in the usage of\r\ncertain corporation festivals. The person presiding stands up at the\r\nclose of dinner, and drinks from a flaggon usually of silver having a\r\nhandle on each side, by which he holds it with each hand, and the\r\ntoast-master announces him as drinking “the health of his brethren out\r\nof the ‘_loving cup_.’” The _loving cup_, which is the ancient\r\n_wassail-bowl_, is then passed to the guest on his left hand, and by him\r\nto _his_ left-hand neighbour, and as it finds its way round the room to\r\neach guest in his turn, so each stands up and drinks to the president\r\n“out of the _loving cup_.”\r\n\r\nThe subsequent song is sung in Gloucestershire on New-year’s eve:--\r\n\r\n    Wassail! Wassail! over the town,\r\n    Our toast it is white, our ale it is brown:\r\n    Our bowl it is made of a maplin tree,\r\n    We be good fellows all; I drink to thee.\r\n\r\n    Here’s to * * * *[9], and to his right ear,\r\n    God send our maister a happy New Year;\r\n    A happy New Year as e’er he did see--\r\n    With my Wassailing bowl I drink to thee.\r\n\r\n    Here’s to * * * *[10], and to his right eye,\r\n    God send our mistress a good Christmas pie:\r\n    A good Christmas pie as e’er I did see--\r\n    With my Wassailing bowl I drink to thee.\r\n\r\n    Here’s to Filpail,[11] and her long tail,\r\n    God send our measter us never may fail\r\n    Of a cup of good beer; I pray you draw near,\r\n    And then you shall hear our jolly wassail.\r\n\r\n    Be here any maids, I suppose here be some;\r\n    Sure they will not let young men stand on the cold stone;\r\n    Sing hey O maids, come trole back the pin,\r\n    And the fairest maid in the house, let us all in.\r\n\r\n    Come, butler, come bring us a bowl of the best:\r\n    I hope your soul in Heaven may rest:\r\n    But if you do bring us a bowl of the small,\r\n    Then down fall butler, bowl, and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hogmany.~\r\n\r\nOf this usage in Scotland, commencing on New-year’s eve, there was not\r\nroom in the last sheet of the former volume, to include the following\r\ninteresting communication. It is, here, not out of place, because, in\r\nfact, the usage runs into the morning of the New Year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAFT DAYS--HOGMANY.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nThe annexed account contains, I believe, the first notice of the\r\n_acting_ in our _Daft Days_. I have put it hurriedly together, but, if\r\nof use, it is at your service.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  JOHN WOOD REDDOCK.\r\n\r\n  _Falkirk, December, 1825._\r\n\r\nDuring the early ages of christianity, when its promulgation among the\r\nbarbarous Celts and Gauls had to contend with the many obstacles which\r\ntheir ignorance and superstition presented, it is very probable that the\r\nclergy, when they were unable entirely to abolish pagan rites, would\r\nendeavour, as far as possible, to twist them into something of a\r\nchristian cast; and of the turn which many heathen ceremonies thus\r\nreceived, abundant instances are afforded in the Romish church.\r\n\r\nThe performance of religious MYSTERIES, which continued for a long\r\nperiod, seems to have been accompanied with much licentiousness, and\r\nundoubtedly was grafted upon the stock of pagan observances.--It was\r\ndiscovered, however, that the purity of the christian religion could not\r\ntolerate them, and they were succeeded by the MORALITIES, the subjects\r\nof which were either historical, or some existing abuse, that it was\r\nwished to aim a blow at. Of this we have an interesting instance in an\r\naccount given by sir William Eure, the envoy of Henry the Eighth to\r\nJames the Fifth, in a letter to the lord privy seal of England, dated\r\n26th of January 1540, on the performance of a play, or morality, written\r\nby the celebrated sir David Lindsay. It was entitled _The Satire of the\r\nThree Estates_, and was performed at Linlithgow, “before the king,\r\nqueene, and the whole counsaill, spirituall and temporall,” on the feast\r\nof Epiphany. It gives a singular proof of the liberty then allowed, by\r\nking James and his court witnessing the exhibition of a piece, in which\r\nthe corruptions of the existing government and religion were treated\r\nwith the most satirical severity.\r\n\r\nThe principal _dramatis personæ_ were a _king_, a _bushop_, a _burges\r\nman_, “armed in harness, with a swerde drawn in his hande,” a _poor\r\nman_, and _Experience_, “clede like ane doctor.” The poor man (who seems\r\nto have represented the people) “looked at the king, and said he was not\r\nking in Scotland, for there was another king in Scotland that hanged\r\n_Johne Armstrong_ with his fellows, _Sym the laird_, and mony other\r\nmae.” He then makes “a long narracione of the oppression of the poor by\r\nthe taking of the corse-presaunte beits, and of the herrying of poor men\r\nby the consistorye lawe, and of mony other abusions of the\r\n_spiritualitie_ and church. Then the bushop raised and rebuked him, and\r\ndefended himself. Then the man of arms alleged the contrarie, and\r\ncommanded the poor man to go on. The poor man proceeds with a long list\r\nof the bushop’s evil practices, the vices of cloisters, &c. This is\r\nproved by EXPERIENCE, who, from a New Testament, showes the office of a\r\nbishop. The man of arms and burges approve of all that was said against\r\nthe clergy, and allege the expediency of a reform, with the consent of\r\nparliament. The bushop dissents. The man of arms and burges said they\r\nwere two and he but one, _wherefore their voice should have the most\r\neffect_. Thereafter the king in the play ratified, approved, and\r\nconfirmed all that was rehearsed.”\r\n\r\nNone of the ancient religious observances, which have escaped, through\r\nthe riot of time and barbarism, to our day, have occasioned more\r\ndifficulty than that which forms the subject of these remarks. It is\r\nremarkable, that in all disputed etymological investigations, a number\r\nof words got as explanatory, are so provokingly improbable, that\r\ndecision is rendered extremely difficult. With no term is this more the\r\ncase, than HOGMENAY. So wide is the field of conjecture, as to the\r\nsignification of this word, that we shall not occupy much space in\r\nattempting to settle which of the various etymologies is the most\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nMany complaints were made to the Gallic synods of the great excesses\r\ncommitted on the last night of the year and first of January, by\r\ncompanies of both sexes dressed in fantastic habits, who ran about with\r\ntheir Christmas boxes, calling _tire lire_, and begging for the lady in\r\nthe straw both money and wassels. The chief of these strollers was\r\ncalled _Rollet Follet_. They came into the churches during the vigils,\r\nand disturbed the devotions. A stop was put to this in 1598, at the\r\nrepresentation of the bishop of Angres; but debarred from coming to the\r\nchurches, they only became more licentious, and went about the country\r\nfrightening the people in their houses, so that the legislature having\r\ninterfered, an end was put to the practice in 1668.\r\n\r\nThe period during the continuance of these festivities corresponded\r\nexactly with the present _daft days_, which, indeed, is nearly a\r\ntranslation of their French name _fêtes de fous_. The cry used by the\r\n_bachelettes_ during the sixteenth century has also a striking\r\nresemblance to the still common cry “hogmenay trololay--gi’ us your\r\nwhite bread and nane o’ your grey,” it being “au gui menez, Rollet\r\nFollet, au gui menez, tiré liré, mainte du blanc et point du bis.”\r\n\r\nThe word _Rollet_ is, perhaps, a corruption of the ancient Norman\r\ninvocation of their hero, Rollo. _Gui_, however, seems to refer to the\r\ndruidical custom of cutting branches from the mistletoe at the close of\r\nthe year, which were deposited in the temples and houses with great\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nA supposition has been founded upon the reference of this cry to the\r\nbirth of our Saviour, and the arrival of the wise men from the east; of\r\nwhom the general belief in the church of Rome is, that they were three\r\nin number. Thus the language, as borrowed from the French may be “homme\r\nest né, trois rois allois!” A man is born, three kings are come!\r\n\r\nOthers, fond of referring to the dark period of the Goths, imagine that\r\nthis name had its origin there. Thus, _minne_ was one of the cups drunk\r\nat the feast of Yule, as celebrated in the times of heathenism, and\r\n_oel_ is the general term for festival. The night before Yule was called\r\nhoggin-nott, or hogenat, signifying the slaughter night, and may have\r\noriginated from the number of cattle slaughtered on that night, either\r\nas sacrifices, or in preparation for the feast on the following day.\r\nThey worshipped the sun under the name _Thor_. Hence, the call for the\r\ncelebration of their sacrifices would be “Hogg-minne! Thor! oel! oel!”\r\nRemember your sacrifices, the feast of Thor! the feast!\r\n\r\nThat the truth lies among these various explanations, there appears no\r\ndoubt; we however turn to hogmenay among ourselves, and although the\r\nmutilated legend which we have to notice remains but as a few scraps, it\r\ngives an idea of the existence of a custom which has many points of\r\nresemblance to that of France during the _fêtes du fous_. It has\r\nhitherto escaped the attention of Scottish antiquaries.\r\n\r\nEvery person knows the tenacious adherence of the Scottish peasantry to\r\nthe tales and observances of _auld lang syne_. Towards the close of the\r\nyear many superstitions are to this day strictly kept up among the\r\ncountry people, chiefly as connected with their cattle and crops. Their\r\nsocial feelings now get scope, and while one may rejoice that he has\r\nescaped difficulties and dangers during the past year, another looks\r\nforward with bright anticipation for better fortune in the year to come.\r\nThe bannock of the oaten cake gave place a little to the currant loaf\r\nand bun, and the _amories_ of every cottager have goodly store of\r\ndainties, invariably including a due proportion of _Scotch drink_. The\r\ncountenances of all seem to say\r\n\r\n    “Let mirth abound; let social cheer\r\n    Invest the dawnin’ o’ the year,\r\n    Let blithsome Innocence appear\r\n                      To crown our joy,\r\n    Nor envy wi’ sarcastic sneer,\r\n                      Our bliss destroy.\r\n\r\n    When merry Yuleday comes, I trow\r\n    You’ll scantlings find a hungry mou;\r\n    Sma’ are our cares, our stomacks fu’\r\n                      O’ gusty gear\r\n    An’ kickshaws, strangers to our view\r\n                      Sin’ fairnyear.\r\n\r\n    Then tho’ at odds wi’ a’ the warl,\r\n    Among oursels we’ll never quarrel\r\n    Though discard gie a canker’d snarl\r\n                      To spoil our glee,\r\n    As lang’s there pith into the barrel\r\n                      We’ll drink and gree!”\r\n\r\n  _Ferguson’s Daft Days._\r\n\r\nIt is deemed _lucky_ to see the new moon with some money (silver) in the\r\npocket. A similar idea is perhaps connected with the desire to enter the\r\nnew year _rife o’ roughness_. The grand affair among the boys in the\r\ntown is to provide themselves with _fausse faces_, or masks; and those\r\nwith crooked horns and beards are in greatest demand. A high paper cap,\r\nwith one of their great grandfather’s antique coats, then equips them as\r\na _guisard_--they thus go about the shops _seeking their hogmenay_. In\r\nthe carses and moor lands, however, parties of guisards have long kept\r\nup the practice in great style. Fantastically dressed, and each having\r\nhis character allotted him, they go through the farm houses, and unless\r\ndenied entrance by being told that the OLD STYLE is kept, perform what\r\nmust once have been a connected dramatic piece. We have heard various\r\neditions of this, but the substance of it is something like the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nOne enters first to speak the prologue in the style of the Chester\r\n_mysteries_, called the _Whitsun plays_, and which appear to have been\r\nperformed during the mayoralty of John Arneway, who filled that office\r\nin Chester from 1268 to 1276. It is usually in these words at present--\r\n\r\n    Rise up gudewife and _shake your feathers!_\r\n    Dinna think that we’re beggars,\r\n    We are _bairns_ com’d to play\r\n    And for to seek our hogmenay;\r\n    Redd up stocks, redd up stools,\r\n    Here comes in a pack o’ fools.[12]\r\n    Muckle head and little wit stand behint the door,\r\n    But sic a set as we are, ne’er were here before.\r\n\r\nOne with a sword, who corresponds with the _Rollet_, now enters and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    Here comes in the great king of Macedon,\r\n    Who has conquer’d all the world but Scotland alone.\r\n    When I came to Scotland my heart grew so cold\r\n    To see a _little nation_ so stout and so bold,\r\n    So stout and so bold, so frank and so free!\r\n    Call upon Galgacus to fight wi’ me\r\n\r\nIf national partiality does not deceive us, we think this speech points\r\nout the origin of the story to be the Roman invasion under Agricola, and\r\nthe name of Galgacus (although _Galacheus_ and _Saint Lawrence_ are\r\nsometimes substituted, but most probably as corruptions) makes the\r\nfamous struggle for freedom by the Scots under that leader, in the\r\nbattle fought at the foot of the Grampians, the subject of this\r\nhistorical drama.\r\n\r\n_Enter Galgacus._\r\n\r\n    Here comes in Galgacus--wha doesna fear my name?\r\n    Sword and buckler by my side, I hope to win the game!\r\n\r\nThey close in a sword fight, and in the “hash smash” the chief is\r\nvictorious. He says:\r\n\r\n    Down Jack! down to the ground you must go--\r\n    Oh O! what’s this I’ve done?\r\n    I’ve killed my brother Jack, my father’s only son!\r\n    Call upon the doctor.\r\n\r\n_Enter Doctor_ (saying)\r\n\r\nHere comes in the best doctor that ever Scotland bred.\r\n\r\n_Chief._ What can you cure?\r\n\r\nThe doctor then relates his skill in surgery.\r\n\r\n_Chief._ What will ye tak to cure this man?\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ Ten pound and a bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n_Chief._ Will six not do?\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ No, you must go higher.\r\n\r\n_Chief._ Seven?\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ That will not put on the pot, &c.\r\n\r\nA bargain however is struck, and the _Doctor_ says to _Jack_, start to\r\nyour feet and stand!\r\n\r\n_Jack._ Oh hon, my back, I’m sairly wounded.\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ What ails your back?\r\n\r\n_Jack._ There’s a hole in’t you may turn your tongue ten times round it!\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ How did you get it?\r\n\r\n_Jack._ Fighting for our land.\r\n\r\n_Doctor._ How mony did you kill?\r\n\r\n_Jack._ I killed a’ the loons save ane, but he ran, he wad na stand.\r\n\r\nHere, most unfortunately, there is a “_hole i’ the ballad_,” a hiatus\r\nwhich irreparably closes the door upon our keenest prying. During the\r\nlate war with France _Jack_ was made to say he had been “fighting the\r\nFrench,” and that the _loon_ who took leg bail was no less a personage\r\nthan NAP. _le grand_! Whether we are to regard this as a dark prophetic\r\nanticipation of what did actually take place, seems really\r\nproblematical. The strange eventful history however is wound up by the\r\nentrance of _Judas_ with the bag. He says:\r\n\r\n    Here comes in Judas--Judas is my name,\r\n    If ye pit nought sillar i’ my bag, for gude-sake mind our wame!\r\n    When I gaed to the castle yett and tirl’t at the pin,\r\n    They keepit the keys o’ the castle wa’, and wad na let me in.\r\n    I’ve been i’ the east carse,\r\n    I’ve been i’ the west carse,\r\n    I’ve been i’ the carse o’ Gowrie,\r\n    Where the clouds rain a’ day wi’ _peas_ and wi’ _beans_!\r\n    And the farmers _theek_ houses wi’ _needles_ and _prins_!\r\n    I’ve seen geese ga’in’ on pattens!\r\n    And swine fleeing i’ the air like peelings o’ onions!\r\n    Our hearts are made o’ steel, but our body’s sma’ as _ware_,\r\n    If you’ve onything to gi’ us, _stap it in there!_\r\n\r\nThis character in the piece seems to mark its ecclesiastical origin,\r\nbeing of course taken from the office of the _betrayer_ in the New\r\nTestament; whom, by the way, he resembles in another point; as extreme\r\njealousy exists among the party, this personage appropriates to himself\r\nthe contents of the bag. The money and _wassel_, which usually consists\r\nof _farles_ of short bread, or cakes and pieces of cheese, are therefore\r\nfrequently counted out before the whole.\r\n\r\nOne of the guisards who has the best voice, generally concludes the\r\nexhibition by singing an “_auld Scottish sang_.” The most ancient\r\nmelodies only are considered appropriate for this occasion, and many\r\nvery fine ones are often sung that have not found their way into\r\ncollections: or the group join in a reel, lightly tripping it, although\r\nencumbered with buskins of straw wisps, to the merry sound of the\r\nfiddle, which used to form a part of the establishment of these\r\nitinerants. They anciently however appear to have been accompanied with\r\na musician, who played the _kythels_, or stock-and-horn, a musical\r\ninstrument made of the thigh bone of a sheep and the horn of a bullock.\r\n\r\nThe above practice, like many customs of the olden time, is now quickly\r\nfalling into disuse, and the revolution of a few years may witness the\r\ntotal extinction of this _seasonable_ doing. That there does still exist\r\nin other places of Scotland the remnants of plays performed upon similar\r\noccasions, and which may contain many interesting allusions, is very\r\nlikely. That noticed above, however, is the first which we remember of\r\nseeing noticed in a particular manner.\r\n\r\nThe kirk of Scotland appears formerly to have viewed these festivities\r\nexactly as the Roman church in France did in the sixteenth century; and,\r\nas a proof of this, and of the style in which the sport was anciently\r\nconducted in the parish of Falkirk, we have a remarkable instance so\r\nlate as the year 1702. A great number of farmers’ sons and farm servants\r\nfrom the “East Carse” were publicly rebuked before the session, or\r\necclesiastical court, for going about in disguise upon the last night of\r\nDecember that year, “acting things unseemly;” and having professed their\r\nsorrow for the sinfulness of the deed, were certified if they should be\r\nfound guilty of the like in time coming, they would be proceeded against\r\nafter another manner. Indeed the scandalized kirk might have been\r\ncompelled to put the _cutty stool_ in requisition, as a consequence of\r\nsuch promiscuous midnight meetings.\r\n\r\nThe observance of the old custom of “_first fits_” upon New-year’s day\r\nis kept up at Falkirk with as much spirit as any where else. Both Old\r\nand New Style have their “_keepers_,” although many of the lower classes\r\nkeep them in rather a “disorderly style.” Soon as the steeple clock\r\nstrikes the ominous _twelve_, all is running, and bustle, and noise;\r\n_hot-pints_ in clear scoured copper kettles are seen in all directions,\r\nand a good noggin to the well-known toast, “A gude new year, and a merry\r\nhan’sel Monday,” is exchanged among the people in the streets, as well\r\nas friends in the houses. On _han’sel Monday_ O. S. the numerous\r\ncolliers in the neighbourhood of the town have a grand main of cocks;\r\nbut there is nothing in these customs peculiar to the season.\r\n\r\n  _Falkirk_, 1825.\r\n\r\n  J. W. R.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL JOCULAR TENURE.\r\n\r\nThe following are recorded particulars of a whimsical custom in\r\nYorkshire, by which a right of _sheep-walk_ is held by the tenants of a\r\nmanor:--\r\n\r\n_Hutton Conyers, Com. York._\r\n\r\nNear this town, which lies a few miles from Ripon, there is a large\r\ncommon, called _Hutton Conyers Moor_, whereof William Aislabie, esq. of\r\nStudley Royal, (lord of the manor of Hutton Conyers,) is lord of the\r\nsoil, and on which there is a large _coney-warren_ belonging to the\r\nlord. The occupiers of messuages and cottages within the several towns\r\nof Hutton Conyers, Baldersby, Rainton, Dishforth, and Hewick, have right\r\nof estray for their sheep to certain limited boundaries on the common,\r\nand each township has a shepherd.\r\n\r\nThe lord’s shepherd has a preeminence of tending his sheep on every part\r\nof the common; and wherever he herds the lord’s sheep, the several other\r\nshepherds are to give way to him, and give up their _hoofing-place_, so\r\nlong as he pleases to depasture the lord’s sheep thereon. The lord holds\r\nhis court _the first day in the year_, to entitle those several\r\ntownships to such right of estray; the shepherd of each township attends\r\nthe court, and does fealty, by bringing to the court a large\r\n_apple-pie_, and a twopenny _sweetcake_, (except the shepherd of Hewick,\r\nwho compounds by paying sixteen pence for ale, which is drank as after\r\nmentioned,) and a _wooden spoon_; each pie is cut in two, and divided by\r\nthe bailiff, one half between the steward, bailiff, and the tenant of\r\nthe coney-warren before mentioned, and the other half into six parts,\r\nand divided amongst the six shepherds of the above mentioned six\r\ntownships. In the pie brought by the shepherd of _Rainton_ an inner one\r\nis made, filled with _prunes_. The cakes are divided in the same manner.\r\nThe bailiff of the manor provides _furmety_ and _mustard_, and delivers\r\nto each shepherd a _slice of cheese_ and a _penny roll_. The _furmety_,\r\nwell mixed with mustard, is put into an earthen pot, and placed in a\r\nhole in the ground, in a garth belonging to the bailiff’s house; to\r\nwhich place the steward of the court, with the bailiff, tenant of the\r\nwarren, and six shepherds, adjourn with their respective _wooden\r\nspoons_. The bailiff provides spoons for the stewards, the tenant of the\r\nwarren, and himself. The steward first pays respect to the _furmety_, by\r\ntaking a large spoonful, the bailiff has the next honour, the tenant of\r\nthe warren next, then the shepherd of _Hutton Conyers_, and afterwards\r\nthe other shepherds by regular turns; then each person is served with a\r\nglass of _ale_, (paid for by the sixteen pence brought by the _Hewick_\r\nshepherd,) and the health of the lord of the manor is drank; then they\r\nadjourn back to the bailiff’s house, and the further business of the\r\ncourt is proceeded in.\r\n\r\nEach pie contains about a peck of flour, is about sixteen or eighteen\r\ninches diameter, and as large as will go into the mouth of an ordinary\r\noven. The bailiff of the manor measures them with a rule, and takes the\r\ndiameter; and if they are not of a sufficient capacity, he threatens to\r\nreturn them, and fine the town. If they are large enough, he divides\r\nthem with a rule and compasses into four equal parts; of which the\r\nsteward claims one, the warrener another, and the remainder is divided\r\namongst the shepherds. In respect to the _furmety_, the top of the dish\r\nin which it is put is placed level with the surface of the ground; all\r\npersons present are invited to eat of it, and those who do not, are not\r\ndeemed loyal to the lord. Every shepherd is obliged to eat of it, and\r\nfor that purpose is to take a _spoon_ in his pocket to the court; for if\r\nany of them neglect to carry a spoon with him, he is to lay him down\r\nupon his belly, and sup the _furmety_ with his face to the pot or dish,\r\nat which time it is usual, by way of sport, for some of the bystanders\r\nto dip his face into the _furmety_; and sometimes a shepherd, for the\r\nsake of diversion, will purposely leave his spoon at home.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW-YEAR’S DAY IN SUSSEX.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nA practice which well deserves to be known and imitated is established\r\nat Maresfield-park, Sussex, the seat of sir John Shelley, bart. M. P.\r\nRewards are annually given on New-year’s day to such of the industrious\r\npoor in the neighbourhood as have not received parish relief, and have\r\nmost distinguished themselves by their good behaviour and industry, the\r\nneatness of their cottages and gardens, and their constant attendance at\r\nchurch, &c. The distribution is made by lady Shelley, assisted by other\r\nladies; and it is gratifying to observe the happy effects upon the\r\ncharacter and disposition of the poor people with which this benevolent\r\npractice has been attended during the few years it has been established.\r\nThough the highest reward does not exceed two guineas, yet it has\r\nexcited a wonderful spirit of emulation, and many a strenuous effort to\r\navoid receiving money from the parish. Immediately as the rewards are\r\ngiven, all the children belonging to the Sunday-school and\r\nnational-school lately established in the parish, are set down to a\r\nplentiful dinner in the servants’ hall; and after dinner they also\r\nreceive prizes for their good conduct as teachers, and their diligence\r\nas scholars.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.S.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nODE TO THE NEW YEAR.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nA Gentleman of Literary Habits and Means.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-day Book._\r\n\r\n    All hail to the birth of the year,\r\n    See golden haired Phœbus afar;\r\n    Prepares to renew his career,\r\n    And is mounting his dew spangled car.\r\n\r\n    Stern Winter congeals every brook,\r\n    That murmured so lately with glee;\r\n    And places a snowy peruke,\r\n    On the head of each bald pated tree.\r\n\r\n    Now wild duck and widgeon abound,\r\n    Snipes sit by the half frozen rills\r\n    Where woodcocks are frequently found,\r\n    That sport such amazing long bills.\r\n\r\n    The winds blow out shrilly and hoarse,\r\n    And the rivers are choking with ice;\r\n    And it comes as a matter of course,\r\n    That Wallsends are rising in price.\r\n\r\n    Alas! for the poor! as unwilling\r\n    I gaze on each famishing group;\r\n    I never miss giving a shilling,\r\n    To the parish subscription for soup.\r\n\r\n    The wood pigeon, sacred to love,\r\n    Is wheeling in circles on high;\r\n    How charming he looks in the grove!\r\n    How charming he looks in the pie!\r\n\r\n    Now gone is St. Thomas’s day,\r\n    The shortest, alas! in the year.\r\n    And Christmas is hasting away,\r\n    With its holly and berries and beer,\r\n\r\n    And the old year for ever is gone,\r\n    With the tabor, the pipe, and the dance;\r\n    And gone is our collar of brawn,\r\n    And gone is the mermaid to France.\r\n\r\n    The scythe and the hour glass of time,\r\n    Those fatal mementos of woe,\r\n    Seem to utter in accents sublime,\r\n    “We are all of us _going to go_!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are truly and agreeably informed by the “Mirror of the Months,” that\r\n“Now periodical works put on their best attire; the old ones expressing\r\ntheir determination to become new, and the new ones to become old; and\r\neach makes a point of putting forth the first of some pleasant series\r\n(such as this, for example!), which cannot fail to fix the most fugitive\r\nof readers, and make him her own for another twelve months at least.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nUnder this head it is proposed to place the “Mean temperature of every\r\nday in the Year for London and its environs, on an average of Twenty\r\nYears,” as deduced by Mr. Howard, from observations commencing with the\r\nyear 1797, and ending with 1816.\r\n\r\nFor the first three years, Mr. Howard’s observations were conducted at\r\nPlaistow, a village about three miles and a half N. N. E. of the Royal\r\nObservatory at Greenwich, four miles E. of the edge of London, with the\r\nThames a mile and a half to the S., and an open level country, for the\r\nmost part well-drained land, around it. The thermometer was attached to\r\na post set in the ground, under a Portugal laurel, and from the lowness\r\nof this tree, the whole instrument was within three feet of the turf; it\r\nhad the house and offices, buildings of ordinary height, to the S. and\r\nS. E. distant about twenty yards, but was in other respects freely\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nFor the next three years, the observations were made partly at Plaistow\r\nand partly at Mr. Howard’s laboratory at Stratford, a mile and a half to\r\nthe N. W., on ground nearly of the same elevation. The thermometer had\r\nan open N. W. exposure, at six feet from the ground, close to the river\r\nLea.\r\n\r\nThe latter observations were made at Tottenham-green, four miles N. of\r\nLondon, which situation, as the country to the N. W. especially is\r\nsomewhat hilly and more wooded, Mr. Howard considers more sheltered than\r\nthe former site; the elevation of the ground is a trifle greater, and\r\nthe thermometer was about ten feet from the general level of the garden\r\nbefore it, with a very good exposure N., but not quite enough detached\r\nfrom the house, having been affixed to the outer door-case, in a frame\r\nwhich gave it a little projection, and admitted the air behind it.\r\n\r\nOn this day, then, the average of these twenty years’ observations gives\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·57.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is, further, proposed to notice certain astronomical and\r\nmeteorological phenomena; the migration and singing of birds; the\r\nappearance of insects; the leafing and flowering of plants; and other\r\nparticulars peculiar to animal, vegetable, and celestial existences.\r\nThese observations will only be given from sources thoroughly authentic,\r\nand the authorities will be subjoined. _Communications_ for this\r\ndepartment will be gladly received.\r\n\r\n  [6] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n  [7] Vita Edw.

At the end of twelve lands, they make twelve fires in a\r\nrow with straw; around one of which, made larger than the rest, they\r\ndrink a cheerful glass of cyder to their master’s health, and success to\r\nthe future harvest; then, returning home, they feast on cakes made of\r\ncaraways, &c. soaked in cyder, which they claim as a reward for their\r\npast labours in sowing the grain.”[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Credulity and Incredulity._\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1825, the flimsiest bubbles of the most\r\nbungling projectors obtained the public confidence; at the close of the\r\nyear that confidence was refused to firms and establishments of\r\nunquestionable security. Just before Christmas, from sudden demands\r\ngreatly beyond the amounts which were ready for ordinary supply, bankers\r\nin London of known respectability stopped payment; the panic became\r\ngeneral throughout the kingdom, and numerous country banks failed, the\r\nfunds fell, Exchequer bills were at a heavy discount, and public\r\nsecurities of every description suffered material depression. This\r\nexigency rendered prudence still more circumspect, and materially\r\nretarded the operations of legitimate business, to the injury of all\r\npersons engaged in trade. In several manufacturing districts,\r\ntransactions of every kind were suspended, and manufactories wholly\r\nceased from work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCHEQUER BILLS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nAs just at this time it may be interesting to many of your readers, to\r\nknow the origin of Exchequer bills, I send you the following account.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1696 and 1697, the silver currency of the kingdom being, by\r\nclipping, washing, grinding, filing, &c. reduced to about half its\r\nnominal value, acts of parliament were passed for its being called in,\r\nand re-coined; but whilst the re-coinage was going on exchequer bills\r\nwere first issued, to supply the demands of trade. The quantity of\r\nsilver re-coined, according to D’Avenant, from the old hammered money,\r\namounted to 5,725,933_l._ It is worthy of remark, that through the\r\ndifficulties experienced by the Bank of England (which had been\r\nestablished only three years,) during the re-coinage, they having taken\r\nthe clipped silver at its nominal value, and guineas at an advanced\r\nprice, bank notes were in 1697 at a discount of from 15 to 20 per cent.\r\n“During the re-coinage,” says D’Avenant, “all great dealings were\r\ntransacted by tallies, bank-bills, and goldsmiths’ notes.

Gerund-grinding and parsing\r\nare usually prepared for at the last moment, until when “the master’s\r\nchair” is only “remembered to be forgotten.” There is entire suspension\r\nof the authority of that class, by whom the name of “Busby” is\r\nvenerated, till “Black Monday” arrives, and chaises and stages convey\r\nthe young Christmas-keepers to the “seat of government.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Dr. Busby’s Chair.~]\r\n\r\n    Him! sui generis, alone,\r\n    Busby! the great substantive noun!\r\n    Whose look was lightning, and whose word\r\n    Was thunder to the boys who heard,\r\n    Is, as regards his long vocation,\r\n    Pictured by this his great location.\r\n    Look on it well, boys, and digest\r\n    The symbols!--learn--and shun the rest!\r\n\r\nThe name of Busby!--not the musical doctor, but a late magisterial\r\ndoctor of Westminster school--celebrated for severe discipline, is a\r\n“word of fear” to all living who know his fame! It is perpetuated by an\r\nengraved representation of his chair, said to have been designed by sir\r\nPeter Lily, and presented by that artist to king Charles II. The arms,\r\nand each arm, are appalling; and the import of the other devices are, or\r\nought to be, known by every tyro. Every prudent person lays in stores\r\nbefore they are wanted, and Dr. Busby’s chair may as well be “in the\r\nhouse” on Twelfth-day as on any other; not as a mirth-spoiler, but as a\r\nsubject which we know to-day that we have “by us,” whereon to inquire\r\nand discuss at a more convenient season. Dr. Busby was a severe, but not\r\nan ill-natured man. It is related of him and one of his scholars, that\r\nduring the doctor’s absence from his study, the boy found some plums in\r\nit, and being moved by lickerishness, began to eat some; first, however,\r\nhe waggishly cried out, “I publish the banns of matrimony between my\r\nmouth and these plums; if any here present know just cause or impediment\r\nwhy they should not be united, you are to declare it, or hereafter hold\r\nyour peace;” and then he ate. But the doctor had overheard the\r\nproclamation, and said nothing till the next morning, when causing the\r\nboy to be “brought up,” and disposed for punishment, he grasped the\r\nwell-known instrument, and said, “I publish the banns of matrimony\r\nbetween this rod and this boy: if any of you know just cause or\r\nimpediment why they should not be united, you are to declare it.”--The\r\nboy himself called out, “I forbid the banns!” “For what cause?” inquired\r\nthe doctor. “Because,” said the boy, “the parties are not agreed!” The\r\ndoctor enjoyed the validity of the objection urged by the boy’s wit, and\r\nthe ceremony was not performed. This is an instance of Dr. Busby’s\r\nadmiration of talent: and let us hope, in behalf of its seasonableness\r\nhere, that it was at Christmas time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The King drinks._\r\n\r\nWe recur once more to this subject, for the sake of remarking that there\r\nis an account of a certain curate, “who having taken his preparations\r\nover evening, when all men cry (as the manner is) _The king drinketh_,\r\nchanting his masse the next morning, fell asleep in his memento; and\r\nwhen he awoke, added, with a loud voice, _The king drinketh_.” This\r\nmal-apropos exclamation must have proceeded from a foreign ecclesiastic:\r\nwe have no account of the ceremony to which it refers having prevailed\r\nin merry England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn excellent pen-and-ink picture of “_Merry England_”[15] represents\r\nhonest old Froissart, the French chronicler, as saying of some English\r\nin his time, that “they amused themselves sadly after the fashion of\r\ntheir country;” whereon the portrayer of _Merry England_ observes, “They\r\nhave indeed a way of their own. Their mirth is a relaxation from\r\ngravity, a challenge to ‘Dull Care’ to ‘be gone;’ and one is not always\r\nclear at first, whether the appeal is successful. The cloud may still\r\nhang on the brow; the ice may not thaw at once. To help them out in\r\ntheir new character is an act of charity. Any thing short of hanging or\r\ndrowning is something to begin with. They do not enter into their\r\namusements the less doggedly because they may plague others. They like a\r\nthing the better for hitting them a rap on the knuckles, for making\r\ntheir blood tingle. They do not dance or sing, but they make good\r\ncheer--‘eat, drink, and are merry.’ No people are fonder of\r\nfield-sports, Christmas gambols, or practical jests. Blindman’s-buff,\r\nhunt-the-slipper, hot-cockles, and snap-dragon, are all approved English\r\ngames, full of laughable surprises and ‘hair-breadth ’scapes,’ and serve\r\nto amuse the winter fireside after the roast beef and plum-pudding, the\r\nspiced ale and roasted crab, thrown (hissing-hot) into the foaming\r\ntankard. Punch (not the liquor, but the puppet) is not, I fear, of\r\nEnglish origin; but there is no place, I take it, where he finds himself\r\nmore at home or meets a more joyous welcome, where he collects greater\r\ncrowds at the corners of streets, where he opens the eyes or distends\r\nthe cheeks wider, or where the bangs and blows, the uncouth gestures,\r\nridiculous anger and screaming voice of the chief performer excite more\r\nboundless merriment or louder bursts of laughter among all ranks and\r\nsorts of people. An English theatre is the very throne of pantomime; nor\r\ndo I believe that the gallery and boxes of Drury-lane or Covent-garden\r\nfilled on the proper occasions with holiday folks (big or little) yield\r\nthe palm for undisguised, tumultuous, inextinguishable laughter to any\r\nspot in Europe. I do not speak of the refinement of the mirth (this is\r\nno fastidious speculation) but of its cordiality, on the return of these\r\nlong-looked-for and licensed periods; and I may add here, by way of\r\nillustration, that the English common people are a sort of grown\r\nchildren, spoiled and sulky, perhaps, but full of glee and merriment,\r\nwhen their attention is drawn off by some sudden and striking object.\r\n\r\n“The _comfort_, on which the English lay so much stress, arises from the\r\nsame source as their mirth. Both exist by contrast and a sort of\r\ncontradiction. The English are certainly the most uncomfortable of all\r\npeople in themselves, and therefore it is that they stand in need of\r\nevery kind of comfort and accommodation. The least thing puts them out\r\nof their way, and therefore every thing must be in its place. They are\r\nmightily offended at disagreeable tastes and smells, and therefore they\r\nexact the utmost neatness and nicety. They are sensible of heat and\r\ncold, and therefore they cannot exist, unless every thing is snug and\r\nwarm, or else open and airy, where they are. They must have ‘all\r\nappliances and means to boot.’ They are afraid of interruption and\r\nintrusion, and therefore they shut themselves up in in-door enjoyments\r\nand by their own firesides. It is not that they require luxuries (for\r\nthat implies a high degree of epicurean indulgence and gratification,)\r\nbut they cannot do without _their comforts_; that is, whatever tends to\r\nsupply their physical wants, and ward off physical pain and annoyance.\r\nAs they have not a fund of animal spirits and enjoyments in themselves,\r\nthey cling to external objects for support, and derive solid\r\nsatisfaction from the ideas of order, cleanliness, plenty, property, and\r\ndomestic quiet, as they seek for diversion from odd accidents and\r\ngrotesque surprises, and have the highest possible relish not of\r\nvoluptuous softness, but of hard knocks and dry blows, as one means of\r\nascertaining their personal identity.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Twelfth-day_, in the times of chivalry, was observed at the court of\r\nEngland by grand entertainments and tournaments. The justings were\r\ncontinued till a period little favourable to such sports.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I., when his son prince Henry was in the 16th\r\nyear of his age, and therefore arrived to the period for claiming the\r\nprincipality of Wales and the duchy of Cornwall, it was granted to him\r\nby the king and the high court of parliament, and the 4th of June\r\nfollowing appointed for his investiture: “the _Christmas_ before which,”\r\nsir Charles Cornwallis says, “his highnesse, not onely for his owne\r\nrecreation, but also that the world might know what a brave prince they\r\nwere likely to enjoy, under the name of Meliades, lord of the isles, (an\r\nancient title due to the first-borne of Scotland,) did, in his name, by\r\nsome appointed for the same purpose, strangely attired, accompanied with\r\ndrummes and trumpets, in the presence, before the king and queene, and\r\nin the presence of the whole court, deliver a challenge to all knights\r\nof Great Britaine.” The challenge was to this effect, “That Meliades,\r\ntheir noble master, burning with an earnest desire to trie the valour of\r\nhis young yeares in foraigne countryes, and to know where vertue\r\ntriumphed most, had sent them abroad to espy the same, who, after their\r\nlong travailes in all countreyes, and returne,” had nowhere discovered\r\nit, “save in the fortunate isle of Great Britaine: which ministring\r\nmatter of exceeding joy to their young Meliades, who (as they said)\r\ncould lineally derive his pedegree from the famous knights of this isle,\r\nwas the cause that he had now sent to present the first fruits of his\r\nchivalrie at his majesties’ feete; then after returning with a short\r\nspeech to her majestie, next to the earles, lords, and knights, excusing\r\ntheir lord in this their so sudden and short warning, and lastly, to the\r\nladies; they, after humble delivery of their chartle concerning time,\r\nplace, conditions, number of weapons and assailants, tooke their leave,\r\ndeparting solemnly as they entered.”\r\n\r\nThen preparations began to be made for this great fight, and each was\r\nhappy who found himself admitted for a defendant, much more an\r\nassailant. “At last to encounter his highness, six assailants, and\r\nfifty-eight defendants, consisting of earles, barons, knights, and\r\nesquires, were appointed and chosen; eight defendants to one assailant,\r\nevery assailant being to fight by turnes eight severall times fighting,\r\ntwo every time with push and pike of sword, twelve strokes at a time;\r\nafter which, the barre for separation was to be let downe until a fresh\r\nonset.” The summons ran in these words:\r\n\r\n  “To our verie loving good ffreind sir Gilbert Houghton, knight, geave\r\n  theis with speed:\r\n\r\n“After our hartie commendacions unto you. The prince, his highnes, hath\r\ncomanded us to signifie to you that whereas he doth intend to make a\r\nchallenge in his owne person at the Barriers, with sixe other\r\nassistants, to bee performed some tyme this Christmas; and that he hath\r\nmade choice of you for one of the defendants (whereof wee have\r\ncomandement to give you knowledge), that theruppon you may so repaire\r\nhither to prepare yourselfe, as you may bee fitt to attend him. Hereunto\r\nexpecting your speedie answer wee rest, from Whitehall this 25th of\r\nDecember, 1609. Your very loving freindes,\r\n\r\nNotingham. | T. Suffolke. | E. Worcester.”\r\n\r\nOn New-year’s Day, 1610, or the day after, the prince’s challenge was\r\nproclaimed at court, and “his highnesse, in his own lodging, in the\r\nChristmas, did feast the earles, barons, and knights, assailants and\r\ndefendants, untill the great Twelfth appointed night, on which this\r\ngreat fight was to be performed.”\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, in the evening, “the barriers” were held at the\r\npalace of Whitehall, in the presence of the king and queen, the\r\nambassadors of Spain and Venice, and the peers and ladies of the land,\r\nwith a multitude of others assembled in the banqueting-house: at the\r\nupper end whereof was the king’s chair of state, and on the right hand a\r\nsumptuous pavilion for the prince and his associates, from whence, “with\r\ngreat bravery and ingenious devices, they descended into the middell of\r\nthe roome, and there the prince performed his first feats of armes, that\r\nis to say, at _Barriers_, against all commers, being assisted onlie with\r\nsix others, viz. the duke of Lenox, the earle of Arundell, the earle of\r\nSouthampton, the lord Hay, sir Thomas Somerset, and sir Richard Preston,\r\nwho was shortly after created lord Dingwell.”\r\n\r\nTo answer these challengers came fifty-six earles, barons, knights, and\r\nesquiers. They were at the lower end of the roome, where was erected “a\r\nvery delicat and pleasant place, where in privat manner they and their\r\ntraine remained, which was so very great that no man imagined that the\r\nplace could have concealed halfe so many.” From thence they issued, in\r\ncomely order, to the middell of the roome, where sate the king and the\r\nqueene, and the court, “to behold the barriers, with the several showes\r\nand devices of each combatant.” Every challenger fought with eight\r\nseveral defendants two several combats at two several weapons, viz. at\r\npush of pike, and with single sword. “The prince performed this\r\nchallenge with wonderous skill and courage, to the great joy and\r\nadmiration of the beholders,” he “not being full sixteene yeeres of age\r\nuntill the 19th of February.” These feats, and other “triumphant\r\nshewes,” began before ten o’clock at night, and continued until three\r\no’clock the next morning, “being Sonday.” The speeches at “the barriers”\r\nwere written by Ben Jonson. The next day (Sunday) the prince rode in\r\ngreat pomp to convoy the king to St James’, whither he had invited him\r\nand all the court to supper, whereof the queen alone was absent; and\r\nthen the prince bestowed prizes to the three combatants best deserving;\r\nnamely, the earl of Montgomery, sir Thomas Darey (son to lord Darey),\r\nand sir Robert Gourdon.[16] In this way the court spent Twelfth-night in\r\n1610.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn _Twelfth-night_, 1753, George II. played at hazard for the benefit of\r\nthe groom porter. All the royal family who played were winners,\r\nparticularly the duke of York, who won 3000_l._ The most considerable\r\nlosers were the duke of Grafton, the marquis of Hartington, the earl of\r\nHolderness, earl of Ashburnham, and the earl of Hertford. The prince of\r\nWales (father of George III.) with prince Edward and a select company,\r\ndanced in the little drawing room till eleven o’clock, and then\r\nwithdrew.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Old Christmas-day._\r\n\r\nAccording to the alteration of the style, OLD Christmas-day falls on\r\nTwelfth-day, and in distant parts is even kept in our time as the\r\nfestival of the nativity. In 1753, Old Christmas-day was observed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Worcester by the _Anti-Gregorians_, full as sociably,\r\nif not so religiously, as formerly. In several villages, the\r\nparishioners so strongly insisted upon having an _Old-style_ nativity\r\nsermon, as they term it, that their ministers could not well avoid\r\npreaching to them: and, at some towns, where the markets are held on\r\n_Friday_, not a butter basket, nor even a _Goose_, was to be seen in the\r\nmarket-place the whole day.[18]\r\n\r\nTo heighten the festivities of Christmas, 1825, the good folks of\r\n“London and its environs” were invited to Sadler’s Wells, by the\r\nfollowing whimsical notice, printed and distributed as a handbill:\r\n\r\n“SOVEREIGNS WILL BE TAKEN, during the Christmas holidays, and as long as\r\nany body will bring them to SADLER’S WELLS; nay so little fastidious are\r\nthe Proprietors of that delectable fascinating snuggery, that, however\r\nincredible it may appear, they, in some cases, have actually had the\r\nliberality to prefer Gold to Paper.

On the first day of the first new moon of the new year, or\r\nso soon afterwards as you observe it, all that you have to do is\r\nthis:--on the first glance you take at “pale Luna’s silvery crest” in\r\nthe western sky, put your hand in your pocket, shut your eyes, and turn\r\nthe smallest piece of _silver_ coin you possess upside down in your said\r\npocket. This will ensure you (if you will but _trust_ its\r\ninfallibility!) throughout the whole year that “summum bonum” of earthly\r\nwishes, a pocket never empty. If, however, you neglect, on the first\r\nappearance of the moon, your case is hopeless; nevertheless and\r\nnotwithstanding, at a future new moon you may pursue the same course,\r\nand it will _be sure_ to hold good during the then current month, but\r\nnot a “whit” longer.\r\n\r\nThis mention of the new moon and its crest brings to mind a few verses I\r\nwrote some time ago, and having searched my scrap-book, (undoubtedly\r\n_not such_ a one as _Geoffery Crayon’s_,) I copied them from thence, and\r\nthey are here under. Although written in the “merry merry month of May,”\r\nthey may be read in the “dreary dark December,” for every new moon\r\npresents the same beautiful phenomenon.\r\n\r\n_A Simile._\r\n\r\n    Hast thou ne’er marked, when first the crescent moon\r\n    Shines faintly in the western horizon,\r\n    O’er her whole orb a slight soft blush o’erspread,\r\n    As though she were abashed to be thus seen\r\n    From the sun’s couch with silver steps retreating?\r\n    Hast thou ne’er marked, that when by slow degrees,\r\n    Night after night, her crescent shape is lost,\r\n    And steadily she gains her stores of light,\r\n    Till half her form resplendently proclaims\r\n    An envious rival to the stars around--\r\n    Then mark’st thou not, that nought of her sweet blush\r\n    Remains to please the gazer’s wistful sight,\r\n    And that she shines increasingly in strength,\r\n    Till she is full-orb’d, mistress of the sky?--\r\n    So is it with the mind, when silently\r\n    Into the young heart’s void steals timorous love.\r\n    Then enter with it fancy’s fairy dreams,\r\n    Visions of glory, reveries of bliss;\r\n    And then they come and go, till comes, alas!\r\n    Knowledge, forced on us, of the “world without!”\r\n    How soon these scenes of beauty disappear!\r\n    How soon fond thought sinks into nothingness!\r\n    How soon the mind discovers that true bliss\r\n    Reposes not on sublunary things,\r\n    But is alone when passion’s blaze is o’er\r\n    In that high happy sphere, where love’s supreme.\r\n\r\nHere it may not be out of place to endeavour to describe, as familiarly\r\nas possible, the cause of the lunar appearance. Hold a piece of\r\nlooking-glass in a ray of sunshine, and then move a small ball through\r\nthe _reflected_ ray: it is easy to conceive that both sides will be\r\nillumined; that side towards the sun by the _direct sunbeam_, and the\r\nside towards the mirror, though less powerfully, by the _reflected\r\nsunbeam_. In a somewhat similar manner, the earth supplies the place of\r\nthe mirror, and as at every new moon, and for several days after the\r\nmoon is in that part of her orbit between the earth and the sun, the\r\nrays of the sun are reflected from the earth to the dark side of the\r\nmoon, and consequently to the inhabitants of that part of the moon, (if\r\nany such there be, and query why should there not be such?) the earth\r\nmust present the curious appearance of a _full_ moon of many times the\r\ndiameter which ours presents.\r\n\r\n  J.

It appeared by the evidence, that he had cheated a tailor\r\nof a suit of velvet clothes, trimmed with gold; a jeweller of upwards of\r\n100_l._ in rings and watches, which he pawned; a coachmaker of a chaise;\r\na carver and cabinet-maker of household goods; a hosier, hatter, and\r\nshoemaker, and, in short, some of almost every other business, to the\r\namount of a large sum. He sometimes appeared like a gentleman attended\r\nwith livery servants; sometimes as a nobleman’s steward; and, in the\r\nsummer time, he travelled the west of England, in the character of\r\nDoctor Rock; and, at the same time, wrote to London for goods, in the\r\nnames of the Rev. Laroche, and the Rev. Thomas Strickland. The evidence\r\nwas full against him; notwithstanding which, he made a long speech in\r\nhis own defence. He was sentenced to six months’ hard labour in\r\nBridewell, and, within that time, to be six times publicly whipped.\r\n\r\nSuch offences are familiar to tradesmen of the present times, through\r\nmany perpetrators of the like stamp; but all of them are not of the same\r\naudacity as Stroud, who, in the month following his conviction, wrote\r\nand published his life, wherein he gives a very extraordinary account of\r\nhis adventures, but passes slightly over, or palliates his blackest\r\ncrimes. He was bred a haberdasher of small wares in Fleet-street,\r\nmarried his mistress’s sister before his apprenticeship determined, set\r\nup in the Poultry, became a bankrupt, in three months got his\r\ncertificate signed, and again set up in Holborn, where he lived but a\r\nlittle while before he was thrown into the King’s Bench for debt, and\r\nthere got acquainted with one Playstowe, who gradually led him into\r\nscenes of fraud, which he afterwards imitated. Playstowe being a\r\nhandsome man, usually passed for a gentleman, and Stroud for his\r\nsteward; at last the former, after many adventures, married a girl with\r\n4000_l._, flew to France, and left Stroud in the lurch, who then retired\r\nto Yorkshire, and lived some time with his aunt, pretending his wife was\r\ndead, and he was just on the brink of marrying advantageously, when his\r\nreal character was traced. He then went to Ireland, passed for a man of\r\nfashion, hired an equipage, made the most of that country, and escaped\r\nto London. His next grand expedition was to the west of England, where\r\nhe still personated the man of fortune, got acquainted with a young\r\nlady, and pursued her to London, where justice overtook him; and,\r\ninstead of wedlock, bound him in the fetters of Bridewell.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, 1752, Stroud received “his last and severest\r\nwhipping, from the White Bear to St. James’s church Piccadilly.”[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·12.\r\n\r\n  [22] See vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\n  [23] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 10.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winter in London._\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, 1812, it is observed, that London was this day\r\ninvolved, for several hours, in palpable darkness. The shops, offices,\r\n&c., were necessarily lighted up; but, the streets not being lighted as\r\nat night, it required no small care in the passenger to find his way,\r\nand avoid accidents. The sky where any light pervaded it, showed the\r\naspect of bronze. Such is, occasionally, the effect of the accumulation\r\nof smoke between two opposite gentle currents, or by means of a misty\r\ncalm. The fuliginous cloud was visible, in this instance, from a\r\ndistance of forty miles. Were it not for the extreme mobility of our\r\natmosphere, this volcano of a hundred thousand mouths would, in winter,\r\nbe scarcely habitable![24]\r\n\r\n_Winter in the Country._\r\n\r\n              All out door work\r\n    Now stands; the waggoner, with wisp-wound feet,\r\n    And wheelspokes almost filled, his destined stage\r\n    Scarcely can gain. O’er hill, and vale, and wood,\r\n    Sweeps the snow-pinioned blast, and all things veils\r\n    In white array, disguising to the view\r\n    Objects well known, now faintly recognised.\r\n    One colour clothes the mountain and the plain,\r\n    Save where the feathery flakes melt as they fall\r\n    Upon the deep blue stream, or scowling lake,\r\n    Or where some beetling rock o’erjutting hangs\r\n    Above the vaulty precipice’s cove.\r\n    Formless, the pointed cairn now scarce o’ertops\r\n    The level dreary waste; and coppice woods,\r\n    Diminished of their height, like bushes seem.\r\n    With stooping heads, turned from the storm, the flocks\r\n    Onward still urged by man and dog, escape\r\n    The smothering drift; while, skulking at a side,\r\n    Is seen the fox, with close downfolded tail,\r\n    Watching his time to seize a straggling prey;\r\n    Or from some lofty crag he ominous howls,\r\n    And makes approaching night more dismal fall.\r\n\r\n  _Grahame._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Mr. Paul Pry in the Character of Mr. Liston.~\r\n\r\n“Just popp’d in, you know!”]\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER\r\n\r\n_from_\r\n\r\n_=PAUL PRY=_.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope I don’t intrude--I have called at Ludgate-hill a great many times\r\nto see you, and made many kind inquiries, but I am always informed you\r\nare “not at home;” and what’s worse, I never can learn when you’ll be\r\n“at home;” I’m constantly told, “it’s very uncertain.” This looks very\r\n_odd_; I don’t think it _correct_. Then again, on asking your people\r\nwhat the _Every-Day Book_ is all about? they say it’s about _every_\r\nthing; but that you know is no answer--is it? I want something more than\r\nthat. When I tell ’em so, and that I’m so much engaged I haven’t time to\r\nread, they say the book is as useful to people engaged in business as to\r\npeople out of business--as if _I_ was in business! I wish to acquaint\r\nevery body, that I am not in business, and never was in business, though\r\nI’ve a deal of business to do; but then it’s for my own amusement, and\r\nthat’s nobody’s business, you know--as I also told ’em. They say it’s\r\nimpossible to describe the contents of the book, but that all the\r\nparticulars are in the Index; that’s just what I wanted; but behold! it\r\nis “not _out_”--that is, it is not _in_--I mean not in the book--you\r\n_take_. Excuse my humorsomeness: I only wish to know when I can get it?\r\nThey say in a few days, but, bless you, I don’t believe ’em; for though\r\nI let ’em know I’ve a world of things to communicate to you, when you’ve\r\ntime to see me, and let me ask you a few questions, they won’t credit\r\n_me_, and why should I credit _them_--I was not born yesterday, I assure\r\nyou. I’m of a very ancient stock, and I’ve some notion you and I are\r\nkinsmen--don’t you think we are? I dare say there’s a likeness, for I’m\r\nsure we are of the same disposition; if you aren’t, how can you find\r\nout so much “about _every_ thing.” If I can make out that you are one of\r\nthe _Pry_ family, it will be mutually agreeable--won’t it? How people\r\nwill stare--won’t they?\r\n\r\nI suppose you’ve heard how I’ve been used by Mr. Liston--my private\r\ncharacter exposed on the public stage, and the whole town roaring at the\r\nwhole of the _Pry_ family. But we are neither to be cried down nor\r\nlaughed down, and so I’d have let the play-goers know, if the managers\r\nhad allowed me to sing a song on New-year’s night, in imitation of Mr.\r\nListon when he’s a playing _me_. Will you believe it--they burst out a\r\nlaughing, and would not let me go on the boards--they said the audience\r\nwould suppose me to be the actor himself; what harm would that have done\r\nthe theatre?--can you tell? They said, it would hurt Mr. Liston’s\r\nfeelings--never considering _my_ feelings! If ever I try to serve them\r\nor their theatre again, I’ll be--_Liston_! They shall be matched,\r\nhowever, if you’ll help me. I’ve copied out my song, and if you’ll print\r\nit in the _Every-Day Book_, it will drive ’em mad. I wish, of all\r\nthings, that Mr. Cruikshank could see me in the character of Liston--he\r\ncould _hit_ me I know--don’t you think he could?--just as I am--“quite\r\ncorrect”--like he did “Guy Faux” last 5th of November. I never laughed\r\nso much in all my life as when I saw _that_. Bless you, I can mimic\r\nListon all to nothing. Do get your friend George to your house some\r\nday--any day he likes--it’s all one to me, for I call _every_ day; and\r\nas I’m an “every-day” _man_, you know, why you might pop me at the head\r\nof the song in your _Every-Day Book_--_that’s_ a joke you know--I can’t\r\nhelp laughing--so droll! I’ve enclosed the song, you see.\r\n\r\n  [The wish of this correspondent is complied with, and the manner\r\n  wherein, it is presumed, he would have sung the song, is hinted at\r\n  parenthetically.]\r\n\r\n=MR.

Every new church that was\r\nfounded was dedicated to some peculiar saint, and was naturally followed\r\nby a public religious celebration, generally on the day of that saint,\r\nor on the Sunday immediately following. Whatever might be the origin,\r\nthe festival part is still observed in most of the villages of several\r\nof the midland and other counties. It is a season much to be remembered,\r\nand is anticipated with no little pleasure by the expecting villagers.\r\nThe joyful note of preparation is given during the preceding week; and\r\nthe clash, and splash, and bustle of cleansing, and whitewashing, and\r\ndusting, is to be seen and heard in almost every cottage. Nor is the\r\nstill more important object of laying in a good solid supply for a\r\nhungry host of visitors forgotten. Happy those who can command _a ham_\r\nfor the occasion. This is a great favourite, as it is a\r\n_cut-and-come-again_ dish, ready at hand at all times. But this is\r\nmostly with the tip-topping part. Few but can boast of a substantial\r\nplum-pudding!--And now the important day is arrived. The merry bells\r\nfrom the steeple announce the event; and groups of friends and\r\nrelations, not forgetting distant cousins and children, are seen making\r\ntheir way, long before the hour of dinner, to the appointed spot. This\r\nis Sunday; and in the afternoon a portion of these strangers, clean and\r\nneatly dressed, are seen flocking to the village church, where the\r\nelevated band in the gallery, in great force both in noise and number,\r\ncontribute lustily to their edification, and the clergyman endeavours to\r\nimprove the solemnity of the occasion by an appropriate address. During\r\nthe early part of the ensuing week, the feast is kept up with much\r\nspirit: the village presents a holiday appearance, and openhousekeeping,\r\nas far as may be, is the order of the day; the bells at intervals send\r\nforth an enlivening peal; all work is nearly suspended; gay stalls of\r\ngingerbread and fruit, according to the season of the year, together\r\nwith swings and roundabouts, spread out their allurements to the\r\nchildren; bowls, quoits, and nine-pins, for the men; and the merry dance\r\nin the evening, for the lasses. Fresh visitors keep dropping in; and\r\nalmost all who can make any excuse of acquaintance are acknowledged, and\r\nare hospitably entertained, according to the means of their village\r\nfriends. As the week advances, these means gradually diminish; and as an\r\nempty house has few attractions, by the end of the week the bustle\r\nceases, and all is still and silent, as if it had never been.\r\n\r\nMan naturally requires excitement and relaxation; but it is essentially\r\nnecessary that they should be adapted to his situation and\r\ncircumstances. The _feast week_, however alluring it may appear in\r\ndescription, is in reality productive of greater evil than good. The\r\nexcitement lasts too long, and the enjoyment, whatever it may be, is\r\npurchased at the sacrifice of too great expense. It is a well-known\r\nfact, that many of the poor who have exerted every effort to make this\r\nprofuse, but short-lived display, have scarcely bread to eat for weeks\r\nafter. But there is no alternative, if they expect to be received with\r\nthe same spirit of hospitality by their friends. The alehouses, in the\r\ninterim, are too often scenes of drunkenness and disorder; and the\r\nlabouring man who has been idle and dissipated for a week, is little\r\ndisposed for toil and temperance the next. Here, then, the illusion of\r\nrural simplicity ends! These things are managed much better where one\r\n_fair day_, as it is called, is set apart in each year, as is the case\r\nin many counties; the excitement, which is intense for ten or twelve\r\nhours, is fully sufficient for the purpose; all is noise and merriment,\r\nand one general and simultaneous burst and explosion, if it may be so\r\nexpressed, takes place. You see groups of happy faces. Every one is\r\nwilling “to laugh he knows not why, and cares not wherefore;” and _one\r\nday’s_ gratification serves him for _every day’s_ pleasing topic of\r\nreference for weeks to come.\r\n\r\n  S.

A group of these\r\nanimals left accidentally in a closet without a fire, during the frost\r\nof 1816, not only survived, but appeared to suffer no injury from being\r\nlocked up in a mass of ice for many days.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEEPING RHETORIC.\r\n\r\nCertain rewards allowed by act of parliament to firemen, turncocks, and\r\nothers, who first appear with their engines and implements at premises\r\nsworn to be on fire, were claimed at the public office,\r\nMarlborough-street, in this month, 1826, and resisted on the ground that\r\nthe chimney, which belonged to a brewery, and was more than eighty feet\r\nhigh, was not, and could not be on fire. A witness to that end, gave a\r\nlively specimen of familiar statement and illustration. He began by\r\ntelling the magistrate, that he was a sweep-chimney by profession--a\r\npiece of information very unnecessary, for he was as black and sooty a\r\nsweep as ever mounted a chimney-top,--and then went on in this\r\nfashion--“This here man, (pointing to the patrol,) your wortship, has\r\ntold a false affidavit. I knows that ere chimley from a hinfant, and she\r\nknows my foot as well as my own mother. The way as I goes up her is\r\nthis--I goes in all round the boiler, then I twistes in the chimley like\r\nthe smoke, and then up I goes with the wind, for, your wortship, there’s\r\na wind in her that would blow you out like a feather, if you didn’t know\r\nher as well as I do, and that makes me always go to the top myself,\r\nbecause there isn’t a brick in her that doesn’t know my foot. So that\r\nyou see, your wortship, no soot or blacks is ever in her: the wind won’t\r\nlet ’em stop: and besides they knows that I go up her regular. So that\r\nshe always keeps herself as clean as a new pin.

I was brought up in that chimley, your wortship, and I can’t\r\nabear to hear such things said--lies of her; and that’s all as I knows\r\nat present, please your wortship.”[26]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe London Christmas evenings of 1826, appear to have been kept out of\r\ndoors, for every place of entertainment was overflowing every night.\r\n\r\nAt this season, from six o’clock in the evening, a full tide of\r\npassengers sets in along every leading street to each of the theatres.\r\nHackney coaches drawl, and cabriolets make their way, and jostle each\r\nother, and private carriages swiftly roll, and draw up to the box door\r\nwith a vigorous sweep, which the horses of hired vehicles are too aged,\r\nor too low in condition to achieve. Within a hundred yards of either\r\nplayhouse, hands are continually thrust into each coach window, with “a\r\nbill of the play,” and repeated cries of “only a penny!” The coachdoor\r\nbeing opened, down fall the steps with a sharp clackity-clack-click, and\r\nthe companies alight, if they can, without the supernumerary aid of\r\nattendant pliers, who offer their over-ready arms to lean upon, and\r\nkindly entreat--“Take care, sir!--mind how you step ma’am--this way if\r\nyou please--this way,” all against your will, and ending with “I hope\r\nyou’ll please to remember a poor fellow!” the “poor fellow” having done\r\nnothing but interrupt you. When past the “pay place,” great coats,\r\numbrellas, shawls or other useful accompaniments to and from “the\r\nhouse,” though real encumbrances within it, may be safely deposited with\r\npersons stationed for their reception, who attach tickets to them, and\r\ndeliver corresponding numbers, which ensure the return of your property\r\non your coming out; sixpence or a shilling being a gratuity for the\r\naccommodation. Then, when the whole is over, there is the strict\r\nblockade of coaches further than the eye can reach; servants looking out\r\nfor the parties they came with, and getting up their masters’ carriages;\r\nand a full cry of hackney coachmen and their representatives,\r\nvociferating “Want a coach, sir? Here’s your coach, sir! Which is it,\r\nsir? Coach to the city, sir! West end, sir! Here! Coach to the city!\r\nCoach to Whitechapel! Coach to Portman-square! Coach to Pentonville!\r\nCoach to the Regent’s Park! This way! this way! Stand clear there!\r\nChariot, or a coach, sir? No chariots, sir, and all the coaches are\r\nhired! There’s a coach here, sir--just below! Coachman, draw up!” and\r\ndrawing up is impossible, and there is an incessant confusion of calls\r\nand complaints, and running against each other, arising out of the\r\nimmediate wants of every body, which can only be successively gratified.\r\nPedestrians make their way home, or to the inns, as fast as possible, or\r\nturn in to sup at the fish-shops, which, in five minutes, are more\r\nlively than their oysters were at any time. “Waiter! Waiter! Yes, sir!\r\nAttend to you directly, sir! Yours is gone for, sir! Why, I’ve ordered\r\nnothing! It’s coming directly, sir! Ginger-beer--why this is poison!\r\nSpruce--why this is ginger-beer! Porter, sir! I told you brandy and\r\nwater! Stewed oysters! I ordered scolloped! When am I to have _my_\r\nsupper? You’ve had it, sir--I beg your pardon, sir, the gentleman that\r\nsat here is gone, sir! Waiter! waiter!” and so on; and he who has\r\npatience, is sure to be indulged with an opportunity of retaining it,\r\namidst loud talking and laughter; varied views of the new pantomime;\r\nconflicting testimony as to the merits of the clown and the harlequin;\r\nthe “new scenery, dresses, and machinery;” likings and dislikings of\r\ncertain actresses; “the lovely” Miss So-and-so, or “that detestable”\r\nwoman, Mrs. Such-an-one, that clever fellow, “Thing-a-merry,” or that\r\nstupid dog, “What-d’ye-call-um.” These topics failing, and the oysters\r\ndiscussed, then are stated and considered the advantages of taking\r\nsomething “to keep’em down;” the comparative merits of Burton, Windsor,\r\nor Edinburgh ale; the qualities of porter; the wholesomeness of smoking;\r\nthe difference between a pipe and a segar, and the preference of one to\r\nthe other; whether brandy or rum, or the clear spirit of juniper, is the\r\nbest preservative of health; which of the company or their friends can\r\ndrink most; whether the last fight was “a cross,” and who of all the men\r\nin the fancy is most “game;” whether the magistrates dare to interfere\r\nwith “the ring;” whether if fighting should be “put an end to”\r\nEnglishmen will have half the courage they had three hundred years ago,\r\nbefore prize fighting existed; whether Thurtell was not “a good one” to\r\nthe last, and whether there’s a better “trump” in the room. On these\r\npoints, or to points like these, the conversation of an oyster room is\r\nturned by sitters after the play, till they adjourn to “spend the\r\nevening” at the “flash-and-foolish” houses which “keep it up” all night\r\nin the peculiar neighbourhood of the public office, Bow-street. This is\r\nmore than mere animal gratification, as the police reports exemplify.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Seasonable Refreshment.~]\r\n\r\n    Capital oysters, I declare!\r\n    Excellent spruce, and ginger beer!\r\n    Don’t you take vinegar? there’s the bread--\r\n    We’ll just have a pipe--and then to bed.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nWhy should not this be deemed a real scene, and as respectable as that\r\njust described. It is quite as lively and as intellectual. The monkey\r\neats, and according to many accounts can catch fish as well as man. It\r\nis told of this animal, that from love of the crab and experience of his\r\nclaws, he gently shakes his tail before the hole of the crab, who, as\r\nsoon as he begins to “pull him by his long tail,” is drawn out by that\r\ndependancy and falls a prey to his decoyer. It is related that a party\r\nof officers belonging to the 25th regiment of infantry, on service at\r\nGibraltar, amused themselves with whiting fishing at the back of the\r\nrock till they were obliged to shift their ground from being pelted from\r\nabove, they did not know by whom. At their new station they caught\r\nplenty of fish, but the drum having unexpectedly beat to arms, they\r\nrowed hastily ashore, and drew their boat high and dry upon the beach.\r\nOn their return they were greatly surprised to find it in a different\r\nposition ashore, and some hooks baited which they had left bare. In the\r\nend it was ascertained that their pelters while they were fishing were a\r\nparty of young monkeys. They were driven off by two or three old ones\r\nwho remained secretly observing the whiting fishing of the officers till\r\nthey had retired. The old monkeys then launched the boat, put to sea,\r\nbaited their hooks, and proceeded to work. The few fish they caught,\r\nthey hauled up with infinite gratification, and when tired they landed,\r\nplaced the boat as nearly as they could in its old position, and went up\r\nthe rock with their prey. General Elliot, while commander at Gibraltar,\r\nnever suffered the monkeys with which the rock abounds to be molested or\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of imitation in monkeys is limited, but not so in man; a\r\nremarkable instance of this is lately adduced in a pleasant little story\r\nof perhaps the greatest performer on our stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garrick._\r\n\r\nAt a splendid dinner-party at lord ----’s they suddenly missed Garrick,\r\nand could not imagine what was become of him, till they were drawn to\r\nthe window by the convulsive screams and peals of laughter of a young\r\nnegro boy, who was rolling on the ground in an ecstasy of delight to see\r\nGarrick mimicking a turkey-cock in the court yard, with his coat-tail\r\nstuck out behind, and in a seeming flutter of feathered rage and pride.\r\nOf our party only two persons present had seen the British Roscius; and\r\nthey seemed as willing as the rest to renew their acquaintance with\r\ntheir old favourite. This anecdote is new: it is related by the able\r\nwriter of a paper concerning “Persons one would wish to have seen,”[27]\r\nas an instance of Garrick’s singleness of purpose when he was fully\r\npossessed by an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 34·45.\r\n\r\n  [25] Howard on Climate.\r\n\r\n  [26] The Times, 5th January, 1826.\r\n\r\n  [27] In the New Monthly Magazine, Jan. 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 13.~\r\n\r\n1826. Hilary Cambridge Term begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. VERONICA.\r\n\r\nSome curious circumstances are connected with the name of this saint,\r\nwho appears to have been a poor ignorant girl, born near Milan, where\r\nshe worked in the fields for her living. Conceiving a desire to become a\r\nnun, she sat up at night to learn to read and write, which, her\r\nbiographer says, for want of an instructor, was a great fatigue to her.\r\nHe proceeds to tell us, that she was relieved from labour of that kind\r\nin the following manner:--“One day, being in great anxiety about her\r\nlearning, the mother of God, in a comfortable vision, bade her banish\r\nthat anxiety, for it was enough if she knew three letters.” So Veronica\r\nbecame a nun, seeking “the greatest drudgery,” desiring “to live always\r\non bread and water,” and dying “at the hour which she had foretold, in\r\nthe year 1497, and the fifty-second of her age. Her sanctity was\r\nconfirmed by miracles.” We gather this from Alban Butler, who subjoins,\r\nby way of note, thus:--\r\n\r\n  “_The print of the holy face of our Saviour on a linen cloth_ is kept\r\n  in St. Peter’s church at Rome, with singular veneration.--Some private\r\n  writers and churches have given the name of St. Veronica to the devout\r\n  woman who is said to have presented this linen to our divine Redeemer,\r\n  but without sufficient warrant.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore saying any thing concerning the earlier St. Veronica, or “this\r\nlinen” whereon Romish writers allege Christ impressed his own portrait\r\nby wiping his face with it, mention may be made of _another_ portrait of\r\nhim which Romish writers affirm he miraculously executed in the same\r\nmanner, and sent to Abgarus, king of Edessa, in the way hereafter\r\nrelated. They have further been so careful as to publish a print of this\r\npretended portrait, with representations around illustrating the history\r\nthey tell of it. An engraving from it immediately follows. The Latin\r\ninscription beneath their print is placed beneath the present\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Effigies Christi Domini.~\r\n\r\n_Ex ipsomet Divino Exemplari_ AD ABGARUM _missa Genuæ in Ecclesia_\r\nS^{ti}.

Being one\r\nof the greatest curiosities in its numerous cabinets of relics, it has a\r\nplace in this work, which, while it records manners and customs,\r\nendeavours to point out their origin, and the means by which they have\r\nbeen continued.

Oxford Hilary Term begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAILORS.\r\n\r\nMariners form a distinct community, with peculiar manners, little known\r\nto their inland fellow countrymen, except through books. In this way\r\nSmollett has done much, and from Mr. Leigh Hunt’s “Indicator,” which may\r\nnot be in every one’s hands, though it ought to be, is extracted the\r\nfollowing excellent description:\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAMEN ON SHORE.\r\n\r\nAnd first of the common sailor.--The moment the common sailor lands, he\r\ngoes to see the watchmaker, or the old boy at the Ship. His first object\r\nis to spend his money: but his first sensation is the strange firmness\r\nof the earth, which he goes treading in a sort of heavy light way, half\r\nwaggoner and half dancing master, his shoulders rolling, and his feet\r\ntouching and going; the same way, in short, in which he keeps himself\r\nprepared for all the rolling chances of the vessel, when on deck. There\r\nis always, to us, this appearance of lightness of foot and heavy\r\nstrength of upper works, in a sailor. And he feels it himself. He lets\r\nhis jacket fly open, and his shoulders slouch, and his hair grow long to\r\nbe gathered into a heavy pigtail; but when full dressed, he prides\r\nhimself on a certain gentility of toe; on a white stocking and a natty\r\nshoe, issuing lightly out of the flowing blue trowser. His arms are\r\nneutral, hanging and swinging in a curve aloof; his hands, half open,\r\nlook as if they had just been handling ropes, and had no object in life\r\nbut to handle them again. He is proud of appearing in a new hat and\r\nslops, with a belcher handkerchief flowing loosely round his neck, and\r\nthe corner of another out of his pocket. Thus equipped, with pinchbeck\r\nbuckles in his shoes (which he bought for gold) he puts some tobacco in\r\nhis mouth, not as if he were going to use it directly, but as if he\r\nstuffed it in a pouch on one side, as a pelican does fish, to employ it\r\nhereafter: and so, with Bet Monson at his side, and perhaps a cane or\r\nwhanghee twisted under his other arm, sallies forth to take possession\r\nof all Lubberland. He buys every thing that he comes athwart,--nuts,\r\ngingerbread, apples, shoe-strings, beer, brandy, gin, buckles, knives, a\r\nwatch, (two, if he has money enough,) gowns and handkerchiefs for Bet,\r\nand his mother and sisters, dozens of “superfine best men’s cotton\r\nstockings,” dozens of “superfine best women’s cotton ditto,” best good\r\ncheck for shirts (though he has too much already), infinite needles and\r\nthread (to sew his trowsers with some day), a footman’s laced hat,\r\nbear’s grease to make his hair grow (by way of joke), several sticks,\r\nall sorts of jew articles, a flute (which he can’t play and never\r\nintends), a leg of mutton which he carries somewhere to roast, and for a\r\npiece of which the landlord of the Ship makes him pay twice what he gave\r\nfor the whole;--in short, all that money can be spent upon, which is\r\nevery thing but medicine gratis; and this he would insist on paying for.\r\nHe would buy all the painted parrots on an Italian’s head, on purpose to\r\nbreak them, rather than not spend his money. He has fiddles and a dance\r\nat the Ship, with oceans of flip and grog; and gives the blind fiddler\r\ntobacco for sweetmeats, and half a crown for treading on his toe. He\r\nasks the landlady with a sigh, after her daughter Nance who first fired\r\nhis heart with her silk stockings; and finding that she is married and\r\nin trouble, leaves five crowns for her; which the old lady appropriates\r\nas part payment for a shilling in advance. He goes to the port playhouse\r\nwith Bet Monson, and a great red handkerchief full of apples,\r\ngingerbread nuts, and fresh beef; calls out for the fiddlers and Rule\r\nBritannia; pelts Tom Sikes in the pit; and compares Othello to the black\r\nship’s cook in his white night-cap. When he comes to London, he and some\r\nmessmates take a hackney-coach, full of Bet Monsons and tobacco pipes,\r\nand go through the streets smoking and lolling out of window. He has\r\never been cautious of venturing on horseback; and among his other sights\r\nin foreign parts, relates with unfeigned astonishment how he has seen\r\nthe Turks ride,--“Only,” says he, guarding against the hearer’s\r\nincredulity, “they have saddle-boxes to hold ’em in, fore and aft; and\r\nshovels like for stirrups.” He will tell you how the Chinese drink, and\r\nthe NEGURS dance, and the monkies pelt you with cocoa-nuts; and how\r\nking Domy would have built him a mud hut and made him a peer of the\r\nrealm, if he would have stopped with him and taught him to make\r\ntrowsers. He has a sister at a “school for young ladies,” who blushes\r\nwith a mixture of pleasure and shame at his appearance; and whose\r\nconfusion he completes, by slipping fourpence into her hand, and saying\r\nout loud that he has “no more copper” about him. His mother and elder\r\nsisters at home doat on all he says and does, telling him however that\r\nhe is a great sea-fellow, and was always wild ever since he was a\r\nhop-o’-my-thumb no higher than the window-locker. He tells his mother\r\nshe would be a duchess in Paranaboo; at which the good old portly dame\r\nlaughs and looks proud. When his sisters complain of his romping, he\r\nsays that they are only sorry it is not the baker. He frightens them\r\nwith a mask made after the New Zealand fashion, and is forgiven for his\r\nlearning. Their mantle-piece is filled by him with shells and shark’s\r\nteeth; and when he goes to sea again, there is no end of tears, and\r\nGod-bless you, and home-made gingerbread.\r\n\r\nHis _officer_ on shore does much of all this, only, generally speaking,\r\nin a higher taste. The moment he lands he buys quantities of jewellery\r\nand other valuables, for all the females of his acquaintance; and is\r\ntaken in for every article. He sends in a cart load of fresh meat to the\r\nship, though he is going to town next day; and calling in at a\r\nchandler’s for some candles, is persuaded to buy a dozen of green wax,\r\nwith which he lights up the ship at evening; regretting that the fine\r\nmoonlight hinders the effect of the colour. A man, with a bundle beneath\r\nhis arm, accosts him in an undertone; and, with a look in which respect\r\nfor his knowledge is mixed with an avowed zeal for his own interest,\r\nasks if his honour will just step under the gangway here, and inspect\r\nsome real India shawls. The gallant lieutenant says to himself, “this\r\nfellow knows what’s what by his face;” and so he proves it by being\r\ntaken in on the spot. When he brings the shawls home, he says to his\r\nsister with an air of triumph, “there Poll, there’s something for you;\r\nonly cost me twelve, and is worth twenty, if it’s worth a dollar.” She\r\nturns pale--“Twenty what, my dear George? Why, you haven’t given twelve\r\ndollars for it, I hope?” “Not I, by the Lord.”--“That’s lucky; because\r\nyou see, my dear George, that all together is not worth more than\r\nfourteen or fifteen shillings.” “Fourteen or fifteen what! Why, it’s\r\nreal India, en’t it? Why the fellow told me so; or I’m sure I’d as\r\nsoon”--(here he tries to hide his blushes with a bluster) “I’d as soon\r\nhave given him twelve douses on the chaps as twelve guineas.”\r\n“Twelve GUINEAS,” exclaims the sister; and then drawling forth\r\n“Why--my--DEAR--George,” is proceeding to show him what the articles\r\nwould have cost him at Condell’s, when he interrupts her by requesting\r\nher to go and choose for herself a tea-table service. He then makes his\r\nescape to some messmates at a coffee-house, and drowns his recollection\r\nof the shawls in the best wine, and a discussion on the comparative\r\nmerits of the English and West Indian beauties and tables. At the\r\ntheatre afterwards, where he has never been before, he takes a lady at\r\nthe back of one of the boxes for a woman of quality: and when after\r\nreturning his long respectful gaze with a smile, she turns aside and\r\nputs her handkerchief to her mouth, he thinks it is in derision, till\r\nhis friend undeceives him. He is introduced to the lady; and ever\r\nafterwards, at first sight of a woman of quality (without any\r\ndisparagement either to those charming personages), expects her to give\r\nhim a smile. He thinks the other ladies much better creatures than they\r\nare taken for; and for their parts, they tell him, that if all men were\r\nlike himself, they would trust the sex again:--which, for aught we know,\r\nis the truth. He has, indeed, what he thinks a very liberal opinion of\r\nladies in general; judging them all, in a manner, with the eye of a\r\nseaman’s experience. Yet he will believe nevertheless in the “true-love”\r\nof any given damsel whom he seeks in the way of marriage, let him roam\r\nas much, or remain as long at a distance as he pleases. It is not that\r\nhe wants feeling; but that he has read of it, time out of mind, in\r\nsongs; and he looks upon constancy as a sort of exploit, answering to\r\nthose which he performs at sea. He is nice in his watches and linen. He\r\nmakes you presents of cornelians, antique seals, cocoa-nuts set in\r\nsilver, and other valuables. When he shakes hands with you, it is like\r\nbeing caught in a windlass. He would not swagger about the streets in\r\nhis uniform, for the world. He is generally modest in company, though\r\nliable to be irritated by what he thinks ungentlemanly behaviour. He is\r\nalso liable to be rendered irritable by sickness; partly because he has\r\nbeen used to command others, and to be served with all possible\r\ndeference and alacrity; and partly, because the idea of suffering pain,\r\nwithout any honour or profit to get by it, is unprofessional, and he is\r\nnot accustomed to it. He treats talents unlike his own with great\r\nrespect. He often perceives his own so little felt that it teaches him\r\nthis feeling for that of others. Besides, he admires the quantity of\r\ninformation which people can get, without travelling like himself;\r\nespecially when he sees how interesting his own becomes, to them as well\r\nas to every body else. When he tells a story, particularly if full of\r\nwonders, he takes care to maintain his character for truth and\r\nsimplicity, by qualifying it with all possible reservations,\r\nconcessions, and anticipations of objection; such as “in case, at such\r\ntimes as, so to speak, as it were, at least, at any rate.” He seldom\r\nuses sea-terms but when jocosely provoked by something contrary to his\r\nhabits of life; as for instance, if he is always meeting you on\r\nhorseback, he asks if you never mean to walk the deck again; or if he\r\nfinds you studying day after day, he says you are always overhauling\r\nyour log-book. He makes more new acquaintances, and forgets his old ones\r\nless, than any other man in the busy world; for he is so compelled to\r\nmake his home every where, remembers his native one as such a place of\r\nenjoyment, has all his friendly recollections so fixed upon his mind at\r\nsea, and has so much to tell and to hear when he returns, that change\r\nand separation lose with him the most heartless part of their nature. He\r\nalso sees such a variety of customs and manners, that he becomes\r\ncharitable in his opinions altogether; and charity, while it diffuses\r\nthe affections, cannot let the old ones go. Half the secret of human\r\nintercourse is to make allowance for each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the officer is superannuated or retires, he becomes, if intelligent\r\nand inquiring, one of the most agreeable old men in the world, equally\r\nwelcome to the silent for his card-playing, and to the conversational\r\nfor his recollections. He is fond of astronomy and books of voyages; and\r\nis immortal with all who know him, for having been round the world, or\r\nseen the Transit of Venus, or had one of his fingers carried off by a\r\nNew Zealand hatchet, or a present of feathers from an Otaheitean\r\nbeauty. If not elevated by his acquirements above some of his humbler\r\ntastes, he delights in a corner-cupboard holding his cocoa-nuts and\r\npunch-bowl; has his summer-house castellated and planted with wooden\r\ncannon; and sets up the figure of his old ship, the Britannia or the\r\nLovely Nancy, for a statue in the garden; where it stares eternally with\r\nred cheeks and round black eyes, as if in astonishment at its situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·20.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes of Climate._\r\n\r\nAn opinion has been long entertained, that there are vicissitudes in the\r\nclimate and temperature of the air unknown to former times, and that\r\nsuch variations exist in America as well as in Europe. It is said that\r\nthe transatlantic changes have been more frequent, and the heat of the\r\nsun not so early or so strongly experienced as formerly. In America,\r\nthese alterations are attributed to a more obvious cause than uncertain\r\nhypothesis, and at not many degrees distance. For instance, the ice in\r\nthe great river St. Lawrence, at Quebec, did not break up till the first\r\nweek in May, 1817, when it floated down the stream in huge masses, and\r\nin vast quantities; these, with other masses from the coast of Labrador,\r\n&c. spread a general coldness many degrees to the southward. But a few\r\nweeks before the snow fell in some parts of New England, and New York,\r\nto a considerable depth, and there were severe frosts. The vessels from\r\nEngland and Ireland, which arrived at Quebec, all concurred in their\r\naccounts of the dangers which they encountered, and the cold which they\r\nsuffered. In fine, it would appear that the ice in those regions had\r\naccumulated to so alarming a degree, as to threaten a material change in\r\nall the adjacent countries, and to verify the theory of some who\r\nimagined that the extreme cold of the north was gradually making\r\nencroachments upon the extreme heat of the south. They have remarked, in\r\nconfirmation of their opinions, that the accounts of travellers and\r\nnavigators, furnish strong reasons for supposing that the islands of ice\r\nin the higher northern latitudes, as well as the glaciers on the Alps,\r\ncontinue perpetually to increase in bulk. At certain times, in the ice\r\nmountains of Switzerland, there occur fissures, which show the immense\r\nthickness of the frozen matter; some of these cracks have measured three\r\nor four hundred ells deep. The great islands of ice, in the northern\r\nseas bordering upon Hudson’s Bay, have been observed to be immersed one\r\nhundred fathoms beneath the surface of the sea, and to have risen a\r\nfifth or sixth part above the surface, measuring, at the same time,\r\nabout a mile and a half in diameter. It has been shown by Dr. Lyster,\r\nthat the marine ice contains some salt, and less air, than common ice,\r\nand that it therefore is more difficult of solution. From these\r\npremises, he endeavours to account for the perpetual augmentation of\r\nthose floating islands. By a celebrated experiment of Mr. Boyle, it has\r\nbeen demonstrated that ice evaporates very fast, in severe frosty\r\nweather, when the wind blows upon it; and as ice, in a thawing state, is\r\nknown to contain six times more cold than water, at the same degree of\r\nsensible coldness, it is easy to conceive that winds sweeping over\r\nislands and continents of ice, perhaps much below _northing_ on\r\nFahrenheit’s scale, and rushing thence into our latitudes, must bring\r\nmost intense degrees of cold along with them. If to this be added the\r\nquantity of cold produced by the evaporation of the water, as well as by\r\nthe solution of ice, it can scarcely be doubted but that the arctic seas\r\nare the principal source of the cold of our winters, and that it is\r\nbrought hither by the regions of the air blowing from the north, and\r\nwhich take an apparently easterly direction, by their coming to a part\r\nof the surface of the earth, which moves faster than the latitude from\r\nwhich they originate. Hence, the increase of the ice in the polar\r\nregions, by increasing the cold of our climate, adds, at the same time,\r\nto the bulk of the glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nReasonings of this kind are supported by the greatest names, and\r\ncountenanced by the authentic reports of the best informed travellers.\r\nMr. Bradley attributes the cold winds and wet weather, which sometimes\r\nhappen in May and June, to the solution of ice islands accidentally\r\ndetached and floating from the north. Mr. Barham, about the year 1718,\r\nin his voyage from Jamaica to England, in the beginning of June, met\r\nwith some of those islands, which were involved in such a fog that the\r\nship was in danger of striking against them. One of them measured sixty\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of December, 1789, there was an instance of ice islands\r\nhaving been wafted from the southern polar regions. It was on these\r\nislands that the Guardian struck, at the commencement of her passage\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope towards Botany Bay. These islands were wrapt\r\nin darkness, about one hundred and fifty fathoms long, and above fifty\r\nfathoms above the surface of the waves. In the process of solution, a\r\nfragment from the summit of one of them broke off, and plunging into the\r\nsea, caused a tremendous commotion in the water, and dense smoke all\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nThese facts were strongly urged upon public attention in the autumn of\r\n1817,[28] as grounds of not only curious and interesting, but likewise\r\nof highly important speculation. A supposed change in the temper, and\r\nthe very character of our seasons, was deemed to have fallen within the\r\nobservation of even young men, or at least middle-aged men; and upon\r\nthis supposition, it was not deemed extravagant to anticipate the\r\ncombined force of the naval world employed in navigating the immense\r\nmasses of ice into the more southern oceans; while to render the notion\r\nmore agreeable, and to enliven the minds of such as might think such\r\nmatters of speculation dull or uninteresting, the project was laid\r\nbefore them in a versified garb, characterising the arctic regions.\r\n\r\n    There in her azure coif, and starry stole,\r\n    Grey Twilight sits, and rules the slumbering pole;\r\n    Bends the pale moon-beams round the sparkling coast,\r\n    And strews, with livid hands, eternal frost!\r\n    There, Nymphs! alight, array your dazzling powers,\r\n    With sudden march alarm the torpid hours;\r\n    On ice-built isles expand a thousand sails,\r\n    Hinge the strong helm, and catch the frozen gales;\r\n    The winged rocks to feverish climates guide,\r\n    Where fainting zephyrs pant upon the tide;\r\n    Pass where to Ceuta Calpe’s thunder roars,\r\n    And answering echoes shake the kindred shores;\r\n    Pass where with palmy plumes Canary smiles,\r\n    And in her silver girdle binds her isles;\r\n    Onward, where Niger’s dusky Naiad laves\r\n    A thousand kingdoms with prolific waves,\r\n    Or leads o’er golden sands her threefold train\r\n    In steamy channels to the fervid main,\r\n    While swarthy nations crowd the sultry coast,\r\n    Drink the fresh breeze, and hail the floating frost;\r\n    Nymphs! veil’d in mist, the melting treasures steer,\r\n    And cool with arctic snows the tropic year.\r\n    So from the burning line, by monsoons driv’n,\r\n    Clouds sail in squadrons o’er the darken’d heav’n,\r\n    Wide wastes of sand the gelid gales pervade,\r\n    And ocean cools beneath the moving shade.\r\n\r\n  _Darwin._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 35·05.\r\n\r\n  [28] See M.

Such communications are\r\nparticularly acceptable; because they show to what extent usages\r\nprevail, and wherein they differ in different parts of the country. It\r\nwill be gratifying to every one who peruses this work, and highly so to\r\nthe editor, if he is obliged by letters from readers acquainted with\r\ncustoms in their own vicinity, similar to those that they are informed\r\nof in other counties, and particularly if they will take the trouble to\r\ndescribe them in every particular. By this means, the _Every-Day Book_\r\nwill become what it is designed to be made,--_a storehouse of past and\r\npresent manners and customs_. Any customs of any place or season that\r\nhave not already appeared in the work, are earnestly solicited from\r\nthose who have the means of furnishing the information. The only\r\ncondition stipulated for, as absolutely indispensable to the insertion\r\nof a letter respecting _facts_ of this nature, is, that the name and\r\naddress of the writer be communicated to the editor, who will subjoin\r\nsuch signature as the writer may choose his letter should bear to the\r\neye of the public. The various valuable articles of this kind which\r\nhave hitherto appeared in the work, however signed by initials or\r\notherwise, have been so authenticated to the editor’s private\r\nsatisfaction, and he is thus enabled to vouch for the genuineness of\r\nsuch contributions.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nIn your last number appeared a very amusing article touching some usages\r\nand customs in Scotland, and communicated from Falkirk. In the\r\ndescription of the boys’ play, ingeniously suggested as typical of the\r\nRoman invasion under Agricola, we, however, read but a varied edition of\r\nwhat is enacted in other parts besides Scotland, and more particularly\r\nin the western counties, by those troops of old Father Christmas boys,\r\nwhich are indeed brief chronicles of the times. I mean, those\r\npaper-decorated, brick-dust-daubed urchins, ’yclept Mummers.\r\n\r\nTo be sure they do not begin,\r\n\r\n    “Here comes in the king of Macedon;”\r\n\r\nbut we have instead,\r\n\r\n    “Here comes old Father Christmas,\r\n    Christmas or Christmas not,\r\n    I hope old Father Christmas never will be forgot.”\r\n\r\nAnd then for the Scottish leader Galgacus, we find,\r\n\r\n    “_Here comes in_ St. George, St. George\r\n    That man of mighty name,\r\n    With _sword and buckler by my side\r\n    I hope to win the game_.”\r\n\r\nThese “western kernes” have it, you see, Mr. Editor, “down along,” to\r\nuse their own dialect, with those of the thistle. Then, too, we have a\r\nfight. Oh! how beautiful to my boyish eyes were their wooden swords and\r\ntheir bullying gait!--then we have a fight, for lo\r\n\r\n    “Here’s come I, the Turkish knight,\r\n    Come from the Soldan’s land to fight,\r\n    And be the foe’s blood _hot_ and bold\r\n    With my sword I’ll make it _cold_.”\r\n\r\nA vile _Saracenic_ pun in the very minute of deadly strife. But they\r\nfight--the cross is victorious, the crescent o’erthrown, and, as a\r\nmatter of course, even in our pieces of mock valour, _duels_ we have\r\ntherein--the doctor is sent for; and he is addressed, paralleling again\r\nour players of “Scotia’s wild domain,” with\r\n\r\n    “Doctor, doctor, can you tell\r\n    What will make a sick man well?”\r\n\r\nand thereupon he enumerates cures which would have puzzled Galen, and\r\nput Hippocrates to a “non-plus;” and he finally agrees, as in the _more\r\nclassical_ drama of your correspondent, to cure our unbeliever for a\r\ncertain sum.\r\n\r\nThe “last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history” consists\r\nin the entrance of the most diminutive of these Thespians, bearing, as\r\ndid Æneas of old, his parent upon his shoulders, and reciting this bit\r\nof good truth and joculation (permitting the word) by way of epilogue:\r\n\r\n    “Here comes I, little Johnny Jack,\r\n    With my wife and family at my back,\r\n    Yet, though my _body is but small_,\r\n    I’m the _greatest rogue amongst ye all_;\r\n    This is my scrip--so for Christmas cheer\r\n    If _you’ve any thing to give throw it in here_.”\r\n\r\nThis may be but an uninteresting tail-piece to your correspondent’s\r\nclever communication, but still it is one, and makes the picture he so\r\nwell began of certain usages more full of point.\r\n\r\nI doat upon old customs, and I love hearty commemorations, and hence\r\nthose mimics of whom I have written--I mean the mummers--are my delight,\r\nand in the laughter and merriment they create I forget to be a critic,\r\nand cannot choose but laugh in the fashion of a Democritus, rather than\r\nweep worlds away in the style of a Diogenes.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

A ludicrous mistake has occurred, however, in the\r\nclassification of the _Dramatis Personæ_. The sapient playwright, it\r\nwould appear, in reading the lines\r\n\r\n    “Tam had got planted unco richt,\r\n    Fast by an ingle bleezin’ finely,\r\n    Wi’ _reaman’ swats_ that drank divinely,”\r\n\r\nvery naturally conceiving ream an’ swats, from the delectable style of\r\ntheir carousing, to be a brace of Tam’s pot companions, actually\r\nintroduced them as such, as we find in the bill that the characters of\r\n“Ream” and “Swats” are to be personated by two of the performers!\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of an anecdote, connected with the same subject, which\r\nhad its origin nearer home. Some time ago we chanced to be in the shop\r\nof an elderly bookseller, when the conversation turned upon the identity\r\nof the characters introduced by Burns in his _Tam O’Shanter_. The\r\nbibliopole, who had spent the early part of his life in this\r\nneighbourhood, assured us that, “exceptin’ Kerr, he kent every body to\r\nleuk at that was mentioned, frae _Tam_ himsel’ doun to his mare\r\n_Maggie_.” This being the first time we had ever heard Mr. Kerr’s\r\ncognomen alluded to, in connection with _Tam O’Shanter_, we expressed\r\nconsiderable surprise, and stated that he undoubtedly must have made a\r\nmistake in the name. “It may be sae, but its a point easily sattled,”\r\nsaid he, _raxing_ down a copy of Burns from the shelf. With “spectacles\r\non nose,” he turned up the poem in question. “Ay, ay,” said he, in an\r\nexulting tone, “I thocht I was na that far wrang--\r\n\r\n    “_Care_ mad to see a man sae happy,\r\n    E’n drowned himself amang the happy.”\r\n\r\nNow, I kent twa or three o’ the Kerr’s that leev’t in the town-head,\r\nbut I never could fin’ out whilk o’ them Burns had in his e’e when he\r\nwrote the poem.”[29]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Thespian ingenuity we are under an obligation for an invention of\r\ngreat simplicity, which may be useful on many occasions, particularly to\r\nliterary persons who are too far removed from the press to avail\r\nthemselves of its advantages in printing short articles for limited\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Dramatic Printing Apparatus._\r\n\r\nItinerant companies of comedians frequently print their play-bills by\r\nthe following contrivance: The form of letter is placed on a flat\r\nsupport, having ledges at each side, that rise within about a thirteenth\r\nof an inch of the inked surface of the letter. The damped paper is laid\r\nupon the letter so disposed, and previously inked, and a roller, covered\r\nwith woollen cloth, is passed along the ledges over its surface; the use\r\nof the ledges is to prevent the roller from rising in too obtuse an\r\nangle against the first letters, or going off too abruptly from the\r\nlast, which would cause the paper to be cut, and the impression to be\r\ninjured at the beginning and end of the sheet. The roller must be passed\r\nacross the page, for if it moves in the order of the lines, the paper\r\nwill bag a little between each, and the impression will be less\r\nneat.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 35·65.\r\n\r\n  [29] Ayr Courier.\r\n\r\n  [30] Dr. Aikin’s Athenæum.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 17.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Snow, &c._\r\n\r\nOn the 16th and 17th of January, 1809, Mr. Howard observed, that the\r\nsnow exhibited the beautiful blue and pink shades at sunset which are\r\nsometimes observable, and that there was a strong evaporation from its\r\nsurface. A circular area, of five inches diameter, lost 150 grains troy,\r\nfrom sunset on the 15th to sunrise next morning, and about 50 grains\r\nmore by the following sunset; the gauge being exposed to a smart breeze\r\non the house top. The curious reader may hence compute for himself, the\r\nenormous quantity raised in those 24 hours, without any visible\r\nliquefaction, from an acre of snow: the effects of the load thus given\r\nto the air were soon perceptible. On the 17th, a small brilliant meteor\r\ndescended on the S. E. horizon about 6 p. m. On the 18th, though the\r\nmoon was still conspicuous, the horns of the crescent were obtuse. On\r\nthe 19th appeared the _Cirrus_ cloud, followed by the _Cirrostratus_. In\r\nthe afternoon a freezing shower from the eastward glazed the windows,\r\nencrusted the walls, and encased the trees, the garments of passengers,\r\nand the very plumage of the birds with ice. Birds thus disabled were\r\nseen lying on the ground in great numbers in different parts of the\r\ncountry. Nineteen rooks were taken up alive by one person at Castle\r\nEaton Meadow, Wilts. The composition of this frozen shower, examined on\r\na sheet of paper, was no less curious than these effects. It consisted\r\nof hollow spherules of ice, filled with water; of transparent globules\r\nof hail; and of drops of water at the point of freezing, which became\r\nsolid on touching the bodies they fell on. The thermometer exposed from\r\nthe window indicated 30,5°. This was at Plaistow. The shower was\r\nfollowed by a moderate fall of snow. From this time to the 24th, there\r\nwere variable winds and frequent falls of snow, which came down on the\r\n22d in flakes as large as dollars, with sleet at intervals. On the 24th\r\na steady rain from W. decided for a thaw. This and the following night\r\nproved stormy: the melted snow and rain, making about two inches depth\r\nof water on the level, descended suddenly by the rivers, and the country\r\nwas inundated to a greater extent than in the year 1795. The River Lea\r\ncontinued rising the whole of the 26th, remained stationary during the\r\n27th, and returned into its bed in the course of the two following days.\r\nThe various channels by which it intersects this part of the country\r\nwere united in one current, above a mile in width, which flowed with\r\ngreat impetuosity, and did much damage. From breaches in the banks and\r\nmounds, the different _levels_, as they are termed, of embanked pasture\r\nland, were filled to the depth of eight or nine feet. The cattle, by\r\ngreat exertions, were preserved, being mostly in the stall; and the\r\ninhabitants, driven to their upper rooms, were relieved by boats plying\r\nunder the windows. The Thames was so full during this time, that no tide\r\nwas perceptible; happily, however, its bank suffered no injury; and the\r\nrecession of the water from the levels proceeded with little\r\ninterruption till the 23d of February, when it nearly all subsided. No\r\nlives were lost in these parts; but several circumstances concurred to\r\nrender this inundation less mischievous than it might have been, from\r\nthe great depth of snow on the country. It was the time of _neap_ tide;\r\nthe wind blew strongly from the _westward_, urging the water _down_ the\r\nThames; while moonlight nights, and a temperate atmosphere, were\r\nfavourable to the poor, whose habitations were filled with water. On the\r\n28th appeared a lunar halo of the largest diameter. On the 29th, after a\r\nfine morning, the wind began to blow hard from the south, and during the\r\nwhole night of the 30th it raged with excessive violence from the west,\r\ndoing considerable damage. The barometer rose, during this hurricane,\r\none-tenth of an inch per hour. The remainder of the noon was stormy and\r\nwet, and it closed with squally weather; which, with the frequent\r\nappearance of the rainbow, indicated the approach of a drier atmosphere,\r\na change on few occasions within Mr. Howard’s recollection more\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nNumerous inundations, consequent on the thaw of the 24th, appear to have\r\nprevailed in low and level districts all along the east side of the\r\nisland: but in no part with more serious destruction of property, public\r\nworks, and the hopes of the husbandman, than in the fens of\r\nCambridgeshire: where, by some accounts, 60,000, by others above 150,000\r\nacres of land, were laid under deep water, through an extent of 15\r\nmiles. It is a fact worth preserving, that about 500 sacks filled with\r\nearth, and laid on the banks of the Old Bedford river, at various\r\nplaces, where the waters were then flowing over, proved effectual in\r\nsaving that part of the country from a general deluge.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Swearing on the Horns at Highgate.~]\r\n\r\n    It’s a custom at Highgate, that all who go through,\r\n    Must be sworn on the horns, sir!--and so, sir, must you!\r\n    Bring the horns! shut the door!--now, sir, take off your hat!--\r\n    When you come here again, don’t forget to mind _that_!\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\n“Have you been sworn at Highgate?” is a question frequently asked in\r\nevery part of the kingdom; for, that such a custom exists in this\r\nvillage is known far and near, though many who inquire, and are asked,\r\nremain ignorant of the ceremony. As the practice is declining, diligence\r\nhas been exercised to procure information on the spot, and from every\r\nprobable source, concerning this remarkable usage.\r\n\r\nThe village of Highgate takes its name from the gate across the public\r\nroad into London, opposite the chapel, which is sometimes erroneously\r\ncalled the church, for it is, in fact, only a chapel of ease to Hornsey\r\nchurch. This road runs through land belonging to the bishopric of\r\nLondon, and was made, by permission of the bishop in former times,\r\nprobably when the whole of this spot, and the circumjacent country, was\r\ncovered with wood, and part of the great forest of Middlesex, which,\r\naccording to Matthew Paris, was infested by wolves, stags, boars, and\r\nother wild beasts, besides robbers. This gate, from being on the great\r\nnorthern eminence towards London, was called the _high_-gate; as the\r\nland became cleared of wood, houses arose near the spot, and hence the\r\nvillage now called _Highgate_. It seems probable, that the first\r\ndwelling erected here was the gate-house. The occupier of the inn of\r\nthat name holds it under a lease from the bishop, under which lease he\r\nalso farms the bishop’s toll. In the year 1769 the old gate-house, which\r\nextended over the road, was taken down, and the present common\r\nturnpike-gate put up. So much, then, concerning Highgate, as\r\nintroductory to the custom about to be related.\r\n\r\n“Swearing on the _horns_,” which now is “a custom more honour’d in the\r\nbreach than in the observance,” prevailed at Highgate as a continual\r\npopular amusement and private annoyance. An old and respectable\r\ninhabitant of the village says, that sixty years ago upwards of eighty\r\nstages stopped every day at the Red Lion, and that out of every five\r\npassengers three were sworn. It is a jocular usage of the place, from\r\nbeyond the memory of man, especially encouraged by certain of the\r\nvillagers, to the private advantage of public landlords. On the drawing\r\nup of coaches at the inn-doors, particular invitations were given to the\r\ncompany to alight, and after as many as could be collected were got into\r\na room for purposes of refreshment, the subject of being “sworn at\r\nHighgate” was introduced, and while a little artifice easily detected\r\nwho had not taken the oath, some perhaps expressed a wish to submit to\r\nthe ceremony. It often happened however, that before these facts could\r\nbe ascertained “the horns” were brought in by the landlord, and as soon\r\nas they appeared, enough were usually present to enforce compliance.\r\n“The horns,” fixed on a pole of about five feet in height, were erected,\r\nby placing the pole upright on the ground, near the person to be sworn,\r\nwho was required to take off his hat, and all present having done the\r\nsame, the landlord then, in a loud voice, swore in the “party\r\nproponent.” What is called the oath is traditional, and varies verbally\r\nin a small degree. It has been taken down in writing from the lips of\r\ndifferent persons who administer it, and after a careful collation of\r\nthe different versions the following may be depended on as correct.--The\r\nlandlord, or the person appointed by him to “swear in,” proclaims\r\naloud--\r\n\r\n“Upstanding and uncovered! Silence!” Then he addresses himself to the\r\nperson he swears in, thus:--\r\n\r\n“TAKE NOTICE what I now say unto you, for _that_ is the first word of\r\nyour oath--mind _that_! You must acknowledge me to be your adopted\r\nFather, I must acknowledge you to be my adopted son (or daughter.) If\r\nyou do not call me father you forfeit a bottle of wine, if I do not call\r\nyou son, I forfeit the same. And now, my good son, if you are travelling\r\nthrough this village of Highgate, and you have no money in your pocket,\r\ngo call for a bottle of wine at any house you think proper to go into,\r\nand book it to your father’s score. If you have any friends with you,\r\nyou may treat them as well, but if you have money of your own, you must\r\npay for it yourself. For you must not say you have no money when you\r\nhave, neither must you convey the money out of your own pocket into your\r\nfriends’ pockets, for I shall search you as well as them, and if it is\r\nfound that you or they have money, you forfeit a bottle of wine for\r\ntrying to cozen and cheat your poor old ancient father. You must not eat\r\nbrown bread while you can get white, except you like the brown the best;\r\nyou must not drink small beer while you can get strong, except you like\r\nthe small the best. You must not kiss the maid while you can kiss the\r\nmistress, except you like the maid the best, but sooner than lose a good\r\nchance you may kiss them both. And now, my good son, for a word or two\r\nof advice. Keep from all houses of ill repute, and every place of public\r\nresort for bad company. Beware of false friends, for they will turn to\r\nbe your foes, and inveigle you into houses where you may lose your money\r\nand get no redress. Keep from thieves of every denomination. And now, my\r\ngood son, I wish you a safe journey through Highgate and this life. I\r\ncharge you, my good son, that if you know any in this company who have\r\nnot taken this oath, you must cause them to take it, or make each of\r\nthem forfeit a bottle of wine, for if you fail to do so you will forfeit\r\na bottle of wine yourself. So now, my son, God bless you! Kiss the horns\r\nor a pretty girl if you see one here, which you like best, and so be\r\nfree of Highgate!”\r\n\r\nIf a female be in the room she is usually saluted, if not, the horns\r\n_must_ be kissed: the option was not allowed formerly. As soon as the\r\nsalutation is over the swearer-in commands “silence!” and then\r\naddressing himself to his new-made “son,” he says, “I have now to\r\nacquaint you with your privilege as a freeman of this place. If at any\r\ntime you are going through Highgate and want to rest yourself, and you\r\nsee a pig lying in a ditch you have liberty to kick her out and take her\r\nplace; but if you see three lying together you must only kick out the\r\nmiddle one and lie between the other two! God save the king!” This\r\nimportant privilege of the freemen of Highgate was first discovered by\r\none Joyce a blacksmith, who a few years ago kept the Coach and Horses,\r\nand subjoined the agreeable information to those whom “he swore in.”\r\n\r\nWhen the situation of things and persons seems to require it, the\r\n“bottle of wine” is sometimes compounded for by a modus of sundry\r\nglasses of “grog,” and in many cases a pot of porter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance essential for a freeman of Highgate to\r\nremember, and “_that_ is the first word of his oath,--mind _that_!” If\r\nhe fail to recollect _that_, he is subject to be resworn from time to\r\ntime, and so often, until he remember _that_. He is therefore never to\r\nforget the injunction before he swears, to take notice what is said,\r\n“for _that_ is the first word of your oath--mind _that_!” Failure of\r\nmemory is deemed want of comprehension, which is no plea in the high\r\ncourt of Highgate--“mind _that_!” That is, that _that_ “that,” is\r\n“_that_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no other formality in the administration or taking of this\r\noath, than what is already described; and the only other requisite for\r\n“a stranger in _Highgate_” to be told, is, that now in the year 1826,\r\nthere are nineteen licensed houses in this village, and that at each of\r\nthese houses the “horns” are kept, and the oath administered by the\r\nlandlord or his deputy.\r\n\r\nTo note the capabilities of each house, their signs are here enumerated,\r\nwith the quality of horns possessed by each.\r\n\r\n1. THE GATE-HOUSE is taken first in order, as being best entitled to\r\npriority, because it has the most respectable accommodation in Highgate.\r\nBesides the usual conveniences of stabling and beds, it has a\r\ncoffee-room, and private rooms for parties, and a good assembly-room.\r\nThe horns there are Stag’s.\r\n\r\n2.

This house now only known as the sign of the\r\n“Bell,” was formerly called the “Bell and Horns.” About fifty years ago,\r\nit was kept by one Anderson, who had his “horns” over his door, to\r\ndenote that persons were sworn there as well as at the Gate-house.\r\nWright, the then landlord of the “Red Lion and Sun,” determined not to\r\nbe outrivalled, and hung out a pair of bullock’s horns so enormous in\r\nsize, and otherwise so conspicuous, as to eclipse the “Bell and Horns;”\r\nat last, all the public houses in the village got “horns,” and swore in.\r\nIt is within recollection that every house in Highgate had “the horns”\r\nat the door as a permanent sign.\r\n\r\n  6. Coach and Horses,      Ram’s horns.\r\n  7. Castle,                Ram’s horns.\r\n  8. Red Lion,              Ram’s horns.\r\n  9. Wrestler’s,           Stag’s horns.\r\n  10. Bull,                Stag’s horns.\r\n  11. Lord Nelson,         Stag’s horns.\r\n  12. Duke of Wellington,  Stag’s horns.\r\n\r\nThis house is at the bottom of Highgate Hill, towards Finchley, in the\r\nangle formed by the intersection of the old road over the hill, and the\r\nroad through the archway to Holloway. It therefore commands the Highgate\r\nentrance into London, and the landlord avails himself of his “eminence”\r\nat the foot of the hill, by proffering his “horns” to all who desire to\r\nbe free of Highgate.\r\n\r\n13. Crown, Stag’s horns. This is the first public house in Highgate\r\ncoming from Holloway.\r\n\r\n  14. Duke’s Head,       Stag’s horns.\r\n  15. Cooper’s Arms,      Ram’s horns.\r\n  16. Rose and Crown,    Stag’s horns.\r\n  17. Angel,             Stag’s horns.\r\n  18. Flask,              Ram’s horns.\r\n\r\nThis old house is now shut up. It is at the top of Highgate Hill, close\r\nby the pond, which was formed there by a hermit, who caused gravel to be\r\nexcavated for the making of the road from Highgate to Islington, through\r\nHolloway. Of this labour old Fuller speaks, he calls it a “two-handed\r\ncharity, providing water on the hill where it was wanting, and\r\ncleanliness in the valley which before, especially in winter, was passed\r\nwith difficulty.”\r\n\r\n  19. Fox and Crown,      Ram’s Horns.\r\n\r\nThis house, commonly called the “Fox” and the “Fox under the Hill,” is\r\nnearly at the top of the road from Kentish Town to Highgate, and though\r\nnot the most remarked perhaps, is certainly the most remarkable house\r\nfor “swearing on the horns.” Guiver, the present landlord, (January\r\n1826) came to the house about Michaelmas 1824, and many called upon him\r\nto be sworn in; not having practised he was unqualified to indulge the\r\nrequisitionists, and very soon finding, that much of the custom of his\r\nhouse depended on the “custom of Highgate,” and imagining that he had\r\nlost something by his indifference to the usage, he boldly determined to\r\nobtain “indemnity for the past, and security for the future.” Thereupon\r\nhe procured habiliments, and an assistant, and he is now an\r\noffice-bearer as regards the aforesaid “manner” of Highgate, and\r\nexercises his faculties so as to dignify the custom. Robed in a domino\r\nwith a wig and mask, and a book wherein is written the oath, he recites\r\nit in this costume as he reads it through a pair of spectacles. The\r\nstaff with “the horns” is held by an old villager who acts as clerk, and\r\nat every full stop, calls aloud, “Amen!” This performance furnishes the\r\nrepresentation of the present engraving from a sketch by Mr. George\r\nCruikshank. He has waggishly misrepresented one of the figures, which\r\nnot being the landlord, who is the most important character, no way\r\naffects the general fidelity of the scenes sometimes exhibited in the\r\nparlour of the Fox and Crown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for females to be “sworn at Highgate.” On such\r\noccasions the word “daughter” is substituted for “son,” and other\r\nsuitable alterations are made in the formality. Anciently there was a\r\nregister kept at the gate-house, wherein persons enrolled their names\r\nwhen sworn there, but the book unaccountably disappeared many years\r\nago.--Query. Is it in Mr. Upcott’s collection of autographs?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be little doubt, that the usage first obtained at the\r\nGate-house; where, as well as in other public houses, though not in all,\r\nat this time, deputies are employed to swear in. An old inhabitant, who\r\nformerly kept a licensed house, says, “In _my_ time nobody came to\r\nHighgate in any thing of a carriage, without being called upon to be\r\nsworn in. There was so much doing in this way at one period, that I was\r\nobliged to hire a man as a ‘swearer-in:’ I have sworn in from a hundred\r\nto a hundred and twenty in a day. Bodies of tailors used to come up here\r\nfrom town, bringing five or six new shopmates with them to be sworn; and\r\nI have repeatedly had parties of ladies and gentlemen in private\r\ncarriages come up purposely to be made free of Highgate in the same\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nOfficers of the guards and other regiments repeatedly came to the\r\nGate-house and called for “the horns.” Dinner parties were formed there\r\nfor the purpose of initiating strangers, and as pre-requisite for\r\nadmission to sundry convivial societies, now no more, the freedom of\r\nHighgate was indispensable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of this custom, there are two or three stories.\r\nOne is, that it was devised by a landlord, who had lost his licence, as\r\na means of covering the sale of his liquors; to this there seems no\r\nground of credit.\r\n\r\nAnother, and a probable account, is, to this effect--That Highgate being\r\nthe place nearest to London where cattle rested on their way from the\r\nnorth for sale in Smithfield, certain graziers were accustomed to put up\r\nat the Gate-house for the night, but as they could not wholly exclude\r\nstrangers, who like themselves were travelling on their business, they\r\nbrought an ox to the door, and those who did not choose to kiss its\r\nhorns, after going through the ceremony described, were not deemed fit\r\nmembers of their society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is imagined by some, because it is so stated in a modern book or two\r\nas likely, that the horns were adopted to swear this whimsical oath\r\nupon, because it was tendered at the parish of _Horns-ey_, wherein\r\nHighgate is situated.\r\n\r\nThe reader may choose either of these origins; he has before him all\r\nthat can be known upon the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn anecdote related by Mrs. Southo of the Red Lion and Sun, may, or may\r\nnot, be illustrative of this custom. She is a native of Hoddesdon in\r\nHertfordshire, where her father kept the Griffin, and she says, that\r\nwhen any fresh waggoner came to that house with his team, a drinking\r\nhorn, holding about a pint, fixed on a stand made of four rams’ horns,\r\nwas brought out of the house, and elevated above his head, and he was\r\ncompelled to pay a gallon of beer, and to drink out of the horn. She\r\nnever heard how the usage originated; it had been observed, and the\r\nstand of rams’ horns had been in the house, from time immemorial.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 35·52.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 18.~\r\n\r\n_St. Priscian._\r\n\r\nIn the church of England calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TWELFTH DAY.\r\n\r\nThis is still observed in some parts of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don Sebastian._\r\n\r\nIn default of holiday making by the editor, who during the Christmas\r\nseason has been employed in finishing the indexes, which will be in the\r\nreaders’ hands in few days to enable them to complete the first volume\r\nof this work, he has now and then turned to his collections to relieve\r\nthe wearisomeness of his occupation, and finding the following anecdote\r\nin “The Times” of Dec. 1825, he subjoins from his stores an\r\nillustration of the curious fact it relates to. “It may be mentioned,”\r\n_The Times_ says, “as a singular species of infatuation, that many\r\nPortuguese residing in Brazil as well as Portugal, still believe in the\r\ncoming of Sebastian, the romantic king, who was killed in Africa about\r\nthe year 1578, in a pitched battle with the emperor Muley Moluc. Some of\r\nthese old visionaries will go out, wrapped in their large cloaks, on a\r\nwindy night, to watch the movements of the heavens, and frequently, if\r\nan exhalation is seen flitting in the air, resembling a falling star,\r\nthey will cry out, “there he comes!” Sales of horses and other things\r\nare sometimes effected, payable at the coming of king Sebastian. It was\r\nthis fact that induced Junot, when asked what he would be able to do\r\nwith the Portuguese, to answer, what can I do with a people who are\r\nstill waiting for the coming of the Messiah and king Sebastian?”\r\n\r\nThis superstitious belief is mentioned in a MS. Journal of a Residence\r\nat Lisbon in 1814, written by an individual personally known to the\r\neditor, who extracts from the narrative as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt is the daily practice at Lisbon for the master of the family to cater\r\nfor the wants of his table himself. According to ancient usage, he must\r\neither employ and pay a porter to carry home his purchases at market, or\r\nsend a servant for them. A certain doctor, well known to be a lover of\r\nfish, and an enthusiastic expectant of Don Sebastian, was watched\r\nseveral days in the fish market by some knavish youths, who contrived a\r\ntrick upon him. One morning, they observed him very intent upon a fine\r\nlarge fish, yet disagreeing with the fishmonger as to its price. One of\r\nthese knaves managed to inform the man, if he would let the doctor have\r\nthe fish at his own price he would pay the difference, and the\r\nfishmonger soon concluded the bargain with the doctor. As soon as he was\r\ngone, one of the party, without the fishmonger’s knowledge, insinuated\r\ndown the fish’s throat a scroll of parchment curiously packed, and\r\nshortly afterwards, the doctor’s servant arrived for his master’s\r\npurchase. On opening the fish, in order to its being cooked, the\r\nparchment deposit was found, and the credulous man, to his astonishment\r\nand delight, read as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Worthy and well-beloved Signor: ---- ----, respected by the saints and\r\nnow revered by men. From our long observation of thine heart’s\r\nintegrity, and in full knowledge of thy faith and firm belief, thou art\r\nselected as the happy instrument of our return; but know, most worthy\r\nSignor, the idea of a white horse in clouds of air, is a mere fable\r\ninvented by weak men. It will be far otherwise, but be thou circumspect\r\nand secret, and to thee these things will be explained hereafter. Know,\r\nthat by the element of water, by which we make this known, we shall\r\nreturn. Not far from Fort St. Juliana is a spot thou knowest well, a\r\nsmooth declivity towards the sea; it is there we first shall touch the\r\nshore of our loved Portugal to-morrow’s night at twelve. Be thou there\r\nalone, and softly gliding on the water’s surface a small boat shall\r\nappear. Be silent and remain quiet on our appearance, for until we can\r\njoin our prayers with thine thou must not speak; load not thyself with\r\ncoin, for soon as dawn appears a troop of goodly horse from Cintra’s\r\nRoad will rise upon thy view. But be not destitute of wherewith to bear\r\nthine expense. All thy future life shall be thy prince’s care.\r\n\r\n  “SEBASTIAN.”\r\n\r\nThe trick succeeded; for the next day the doctor left Lisbon as\r\nprivately as possible, while his trepanners who had watched him quickly\r\nfollowed, two in a boat hired for the purpose, and two on shore, to make\r\na signal. The boat arrived at the appointed hour, and the doctor\r\nexpected nothing less than the landing of the long expected and\r\nwell-beloved Sebastian. It reached the shore, and by those who stepped\r\nout and their confederates concealed on the beach, the doctor was eased\r\nof some doubloons he had with him, received a cool dip in the water, and\r\nwas left on the beach to bewail his folly. The story soon got wind, and\r\nnow (in 1814) there are wags who, when they observe the doctor coming,\r\naffect to see something in the sky; this hint concerning Don Sebastian’s\r\nappearance is usually intimated beyond the reach of the doctor’s cane.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·12.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feast of Lanthorns._\r\n\r\nThis is a festival with the Chinese on the fifteenth day of the first\r\nmonth of their year. It is so called from the great number of\r\n_lanthorns_ hung out of the houses, and in the streets; insomuch that it\r\nrather appears a season of madness, than of feasting. On this day are\r\nexposed lanthorns of all prices, whereof some are said to cost two\r\nthousand crowns. Some of their grandees retrench somewhat every day out\r\nof their table, their dress, their equipage, &c. to appear the more\r\nmagnificent in lanthorns. They are adorned with gilding, sculpture,\r\npainting, japanning, &c. and as to their size, it is extravagant; some\r\nare from twenty-five to thirty feet diameter; they represent halls and\r\nchambers. Two or three such machines together would make handsome\r\nhouses. In lanthorns of these dimensions the Chinese are able to eat,\r\nlodge, receive visits, have balls, and act plays. The great multitude of\r\nsmaller lanthorns usually consist of six faces or lights, each about\r\nfour feet high, and one and a half broad, framed in wood finely gilt and\r\nadorned; over these are stretched a fine transparent silk, curiously\r\npainted with flowers, trees, and sometimes human figures. The colours\r\nare extremely bright; and when the torches are lighted, they appear\r\nhighly beautiful and surprising.\r\n\r\n\r\n_French Lark Shooting._\r\n\r\nTo the gentleman whose letter from Abbeville, descriptive of “Wild fowl\r\nshooting in France,” is on p. 1575 of vol. I., the editor is indebted\r\nfor another on “Lark shooting,” which is successfully practised there by\r\na singular device unknown to sportsmen in this country.[31]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Lark Shooting in France.~]\r\n\r\n    ------------------ As far-off islanders,\r\n    Innocent of trade, unskilled in commerce,\r\n    To whom a glass or toy unknown before\r\n    Is wonderful, give freely, flocks and fruits\r\n    To gain mere baubles; so, these silly birds\r\n    Attracted by the glisten of the twirler,\r\n    Hover above the passing strange decoy,\r\n    Intent to gaze, and fall the gunner’s prey.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\n  _Abbeville._\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nIf I do not send you your wished for wood cuts I at least keep my\r\npromise of letting you hear from me. I told you in my last you should\r\nhave something about our lark-shooting, and so you shall, and at this\r\ntime too; though I assure you writing flying as I almost do, is by no\r\nmeans so agreeable to me as shooting flying, which is the finest sport\r\nimaginable. When I come home I will tell you all about it, for the\r\npresent I can only acquaint you with enough to let you into the secret\r\nof the enjoyment that I should always find in France, if I had no other\r\nattraction to the country. I must “level” at once, for I have no time to\r\nspare, and so “here goes,” as the boy says.\r\n\r\nPartridge and quail shooting cease in this delightful part of the world\r\nabout the middle of October, for by that time the partridges are so very\r\nwild and wary that there is no getting near them. The reason of this is,\r\nthat our fields here are all open without either hedge or ditch, and\r\nwhen the corn and hemp are off, the stubble is pulled up so close by the\r\npoor people for fuel, that there is no cover for partridges; as to the\r\nquails, they are all either “killed off,” or take their departure for a\r\nwilder climate; and then there is nothing left for the French gentry to\r\namuse themselves with but lark-shooting. These birds are attracted to\r\nany given spot in great numbers by a singular contrivance, called a\r\n_miroir_. This is a small machine, made of a piece of mahogany, shaped\r\nlike a chapeau bras, and highly polished; or else it is made of common\r\nwood, inlaid with small bits of looking glass, so as to reflect the suns\r\nrays upwards. It is fixed on the top of a thin iron rod, or upright\r\nspindle, dropped through an iron loop or ring attached to a piece of\r\nwood, to drive into the ground as here represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy pulling a string fastened to the spindle, the _miroir_ twirls, and\r\nthe reflected light unaccountably attracts the larks, who hover over it,\r\nand become a mark for the sportsman. In this way I have had capital\r\nsport. A friend of mine actually shot six dozen before breakfast. While\r\nhe sat on the ground he pulled the twirler himself, and his dogs fetched\r\nthe birds as they dropped. However, I go on in the common way, and\r\nemploy a boy to work the twirler. Ladies often partake in the amusement\r\non a cold dry morning, not by shooting but by watching the sport. So\r\nmany as ten or a dozen parties are sometimes out together, firing at a\r\ndistance of about five hundred yards apart, and in this way the larks\r\nare constantly kept on the wing. The most favourable mornings are when\r\nthere is a gentle light frost, with little or no wind, and a clear\r\nsky--for when there are clouds the larks will not approach. One would\r\nthink the birds themselves enjoyed their destruction, for the\r\nfascination of the twirler is so strong, as to rob them of the usual\r\n“fruits of experience.” After being fired at several times they return\r\nto the twirler, and form again into groupes above it. Some of them even\r\nfly down and settle on the ground, within a yard or two of the\r\nastonishing instrument, looking at it “this way and that way, and all\r\nways together,” as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nLarks in France fetch from three to four sous a piece. In winter,\r\nhowever, when they are plentiful, they are seldom eaten, because here\r\nthey are always dressed with the trail, like snipes and woodcocks; but\r\nfor this mode of cooking they are not fitted when the snow is on the\r\nground, because they are then driven to eat turnip-tops, and other\r\nwatery herbs, which communicate an unpleasant flavour to the trail. Were\r\nyou here at the season, to eat larks in their perfection, and dressed as\r\nwe dress them, I think your praise of the cooking would give me the\r\nlaugh against you, if you ever afterwards ventured to declaim against\r\nthe use of the gun, which, next to my pencil, is my greatest hobby. I\r\nsend you a sketch of the sport, with the boy at the twirler--do what you\r\nlike with it.\r\n\r\nI rather think I did not tell you in my last, that the decoy ducks, used\r\nin wild-fowl shooting, are made of wood--any stump near at hand is\r\nhacked out any how for the body, while a small limb of any tree is\r\nthrust into the stump for the duck’s neck, and one of the side branches\r\nleft short makes his head. These ducks answer the purpose with their\r\nliving prototypes, who fly by moonlight, and have not a perfect view,\r\nand don’t stay for distinctions, like philosophers.\r\n\r\nIt will not be long before I’m off for England, and then, &c.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

It is also generally\r\nknown, that in certain almanacs every part of the human body is\r\ndistributed among the days throughout the year, as subjects of diurnal\r\ninfluence; but it is not perhaps so well known, that every joint of\r\neach finger on each hand was appropriated to some saint. The proof of\r\nthis is supplied by two very old prints, from engravings on wood, at the\r\nBritish Museum. They are among a collection of ancient wood cuts pasted\r\nin a folio volume. It would occupy too much room to give copies of these\r\nrepresentations in fac-simile: the curiously inclined, who have access\r\nto the Museum print-room, may consult the originals; general readers may\r\nbe satisfied with the following description:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Right Hand._\r\n\r\nThe top joint of the _thumb_ is dedicated to GOD; the second joint to\r\nthe Virgin; the top joint of the _fore finger_ to Barnabas, the second\r\njoint to John, the third to Paul; the top joint of the _second finger_\r\nto Simeon Cleophas, the second joint to Tathideo, the third to Joseph;\r\nthe top joint of the _third finger_ to Zaccheus, the second to Stephen,\r\nthe third to Luke; the top joint of the _little finger_ to Leatus, the\r\nsecond to Mark, the third joint to Nicodemus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Left Hand._\r\n\r\nThe top joint of the _thumb_ is dedicated to Christ, the second joint to\r\nthe Virgin; the top joint of the _fore finger_ to St. James, the second\r\nto St. John the evangelist, the third to St. Peter; the first joint of\r\nthe _second finger_ to St. Simon, the second joint to St. Matthew, the\r\nthird to St. James the great; the top joint of the _third finger_ to St.\r\nJude, the second joint to St. Bartholomew, the third to St. Andrew; the\r\ntop joint of the _little finger_ to St. Matthias, the second joint to\r\nSt. Thomas, the third joint to St. Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·92.\r\n\r\n  [32] See vol. i. p. 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 21.~\r\n\r\n_St. Agnes._\r\n\r\nIn the church of England calendar.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n_How to sleep well in cold weather._\r\n\r\nObtain a free circulation of the blood by walking, or other wholesome\r\nexercise, so as to procure a gentle glow over the entire surface of the\r\nbody.

On the 13th of May, 1694, he fell into a profound\r\nsleep, out of which he could by no means be roused by those about him;\r\nbut after a month’s time, he rose of himself, put on his clothes, and\r\nwent about his business as usual. From that time to the 9th of April\r\nfollowing he remained free from any extraordinary drowsiness, but then\r\nfell into another protracted sleep. His friends were prevailed on to try\r\nwhat remedies might effect, and accordingly he was bled, blistered,\r\ncupped, and scarified, but to no purpose. In this manner he lay till the\r\n7th of August, when he awaked, and went into the fields, where he found\r\npeople busy in getting in the harvest, and remembered that when he fell\r\nasleep they were sowing their oats and barley. From that time he\r\nremained well till the 17th of August, 1697, when he complained of a\r\nshivering, and, after some disorder of the stomach, the same day fell\r\nfast asleep again. Dr. Oliver went to see him; he was then in an\r\nagreeable warmth, but without the least sign of his being sensible; the\r\ndoctor then held a phial of sal-ammoniac under his nose, and injected\r\nabout half an ounce up one of his nostrils, but it only made his nose\r\nrun and his eyelids shiver a little. The doctor then filled his nostrils\r\nwith powder of white hellebore, but the man did not discover the least\r\nuneasiness. About ten days after, the apothecary took fourteen ounces of\r\nblood from his arm without his making the least motion during the\r\noperation. The latter end of September Dr. Oliver again visited him, and\r\na gentleman present ran a large pin into his arm to the bone, but he\r\ngave not the least sign of feeling. In this manner he lay till the 19th\r\nof November, when his mother hearing him make a noise ran immediately to\r\nhim, and asked him how he did, and what he would have to eat? to which\r\nhe replied, “very well, I thank you; I’ll take some bread and cheese.”\r\nHis mother, overjoyed, ran to acquaint his brother that he was awake,\r\nbut on their going up stairs they found him as fast asleep as ever. Thus\r\nhe continued till the end of January, at which time he awoke perfectly\r\nwell and very little altered in his flesh, and went about his business\r\nas usual.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·35.\r\n\r\n  [33] See vol. i. p. 141.\r\n\r\n  [34] Phil.

In a\r\nwork like this there is no room for their display, yet he has hastily\r\nessayed the preceding sketch in a short hour. It is proper to say, that\r\nhowever gratifying the representation may be to the reader, the\r\nfriendship that extorted it is not ignorant that scarcely a tithe of\r\neither the time or space requisite has been afforded Mr. Cruikshank for\r\nthe subject. It conveys some notion however of part of the doings on\r\n“the Serpentine in Hyde-park” when the thermometer is below “freezing,”\r\nand every drop of water depending from trees and eaves becomes solid,\r\nand hangs\r\n\r\n    “like a diamond in the sky.”\r\n\r\nThe ice-bound Serpentine is the resort of every one who knows how or is\r\nlearning to skate, and on a Sunday its broad surface is covered with\r\ngazers who have “as much right” to be on it as skaters, and therefore\r\n“stand” upon the right to interrupt the recreation they came to see.\r\nThis is especially the case on a Sunday. The entire of this canal from\r\nthe wall of Kensington-gardens to the extremity at the Knightsbridge end\r\nwas, on Sunday the 15th of January, 1826, literally a mob of skaters and\r\ngazers. At one period it was calculated that there were not less than a\r\nhundred thousand persons upon this single sheet of ice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe coachmen on the several roads, particularly on the western and\r\nnorthern roads, never remembered a severer frost than they experienced\r\non the Sunday night just mentioned. Those who recollected that of 1814,\r\nwhen the Thames was frozen over, and booths raised on the ice, declared\r\nthat they did not feel it so severely, as it did not come on so\r\nsuddenly. The houses and trees in the country had a singular appearance\r\non the Monday, owing to the combination of frost and fog; the trees, and\r\nfronts of houses, and even the glass was covered with thick white frost,\r\nand was no more transparent than ground-glass.\r\n\r\nButchers, in the suburbs, where the frost was felt more keenly than in\r\nthe metropolis, were obliged to keep their shops shut in order to keep\r\nout the frost; many of them carried the meat into their parlours, and\r\nkept it folded up in cloths round the fires, and unfolded it as their\r\ncustomers came in and required it. The market gardeners also felt the\r\nseverity of the weather--it stopped their labours, and some of the men,\r\nattended by their wives, went about in parties, and with frosted greens\r\nfixed at the tops of rakes and hoes, uttered the ancient cry of “Pray\r\nremember the gardeners! Remember the poor frozen out gardeners!”[36]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Apparition._\r\n\r\n    ’Twas silence all, the rising moon\r\n      With clouds had veil’d her light,\r\n    The clock struck twelve, when, lo! I saw\r\n      A very chilling sight.\r\n\r\n    Pale as a snow-ball was its face,\r\n      Like icicles its hair;\r\n    For mantle, it appeared to me\r\n      A sheet of ice to wear.\r\n\r\n    Tho’ seldom given to alarm,\r\n      I’ faith, I’ll not dissemble,\r\n    My teeth all chatter’d in my head,\r\n      And every joint did tremble.\r\n\r\n    At last, I cried, “Pray who are you,\r\n      And whither do you go?”\r\n    Methought the phantom thus replied,\r\n      “My name is Sally Snow;\r\n\r\n    “My father is the Northern Wind,\r\n      My mother’s name was Water;\r\n    Old parson Winter married them,\r\n      And I’m their hopeful Daughter.\r\n\r\n    “I have a lover--Jackey Frost,\r\n      My dad the match condemns;\r\n    I’ve run from home to-night to meet\r\n      My love upon the Thames.”\r\n\r\n    I stopp’d Miss Snow in her discourse,\r\n      This answer just to cast in,\r\n    “I hope, if John and you unite,\r\n      Your union wo’n’t be lasting!\r\n\r\n    “Besides, if you should marry him,\r\n      But ill you’d do, that I know;\r\n    For surely Jackey Frost must be\r\n     A very slippery fellow.”\r\n\r\n    She sat her down before the fire,\r\n      My wonder now increases;\r\n    For she I took to be a maid,\r\n      Then tumbled into pieces!\r\n\r\n    For air, thin air, did Hamlet’s ghost,\r\n      His foremost cock-crow barter;\r\n    But what I saw, and now describe,\r\n      Resolv’d itself to water.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT FROST, 1814.\r\n\r\nThe severest and most remarkable frost in England of late years,\r\ncommenced in December, 1813, and generally called “the Great Frost in\r\n1814,” was preceded by a great fog, which came on with the evening of\r\nthe 27th of December, 1813. It is described as a darkness that might be\r\nfelt. Cabinet business of great importance had been transacted, and lord\r\nCastlereagh left London about two hours before, to embark for the\r\ncontinent. The prince regent, (since George IV.) proceeding towards\r\nHatfield on a visit to the marquis of Salisbury, was obliged to return\r\nto Carlton-house, after being absent several hours, during which period\r\nthe carriages had not reached beyond Kentish-town, and one of the\r\noutriders fell into a ditch. Mr. Croker, secretary of the admiralty, on\r\na visit northward, wandered likewise several hours in making a progress\r\nnot more than three or four miles, and was likewise compelled to put\r\nback. It was “darkness that might be felt.”\r\n\r\nOn most of the roads, excepting the high North-road, travelling was\r\nperformed with the utmost danger, and the mails were greatly impeded.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, the Maidenhead coach coming to London, missed the road near\r\nHartford bridge and was overturned. Lord Hawarden was among the\r\npassengers, and severely injured.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, the Birmingham mail was nearly seven hours in going from\r\nthe Post-office to a mile or two below Uxbridge, a distance of twenty\r\nmiles only: and on this, and other evenings, the short stages in the\r\nneighbourhood of London had two persons with links, running by the\r\nhorses’ heads. Pedestrians carried links or lanterns, and many, who were\r\nnot so provided, lost themselves in the most frequented, and at other\r\ntimes well-known streets. Hackney-coachmen mistook the pathway for the\r\nroad, and the greatest confusion prevailed.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, the increased fog in the metropolis was, at night, truly\r\nalarming. It required great attention and thorough knowledge of the\r\npublic streets to proceed any distance, and persons who had material\r\nbusiness to transact were unavoidably compelled to carry torches. The\r\nlamps appeared through the haze like small candles. Careful\r\nhackney-coachmen got off the box and led their horses, while others\r\ndrove only at a walking pace. There were frequent meetings of\r\ncarriages, and great mischief ensued. Foot passengers, alarmed at the\r\nidea of being run down, exclaimed, “Who is coming?”--“Mind!”--“Take\r\ncare!” &c. Females who ventured abroad were in great peril; and\r\ninnumerable people lost their way.\r\n\r\nAfter the fogs, there were heavier falls of snow than had been within\r\nthe memory of man. With only short intervals, it snowed incessantly for\r\nforty-eight hours, and this after the ground was covered with ice, the\r\nresult of nearly four weeks continued frost. During this long period,\r\nthe wind blew almost continually from the north and north-east, and the\r\ncold was intense. A short thaw of about one day, rendered the streets\r\nalmost impassable. The mass of snow and water was so thick, that\r\nhackney-coaches with an additional horse, and other vehicles, could\r\nscarcely plough their way through. Trade and calling of all kinds in the\r\nstreets were nearly stopped, and considerably increased the distresses\r\nof the industrious. Few carriages, even stages, could travel the roads,\r\nand those in the neighbourhood of London seemed deserted. From many\r\nbuildings, icicles, a yard and a half long, were seen suspended. The\r\nwater-pipes to the houses were all frozen, and it became necessary to\r\nhave plugs in the streets for the supply of all ranks of inhabitants.\r\nThe Thames, from London Bridge to Blackfriars, was completely blocked up\r\nat ebb-tide for nearly a fortnight. Every pond and river near the\r\nmetropolis was completely frozen.\r\n\r\nSkating was pursued with great avidity on the Canal in St. James’s, and\r\nthe Serpentine in Hyde-park. On Monday the 10th of _January_, the Canal\r\nand the Basin in the Green-park were conspicuous for the number of\r\nskaters, who administered to the pleasure of the throngs on the banks;\r\nsome by the agility and grace of their evolutions, and others by tumbles\r\nand whimsical accidents from clumsy attempts. A motley collection of all\r\norders seemed eager candidates for applause. The sweep, the dustman, the\r\ndrummer, the beau, gave evidence of his own good opinion, and claimed\r\nthat of the _belles_ who viewed his movements. In Hyde-park, a more\r\ndistinguished order of visitors crowded the banks of the Serpentine.\r\nLadies, in robes of the richest fur, bid defiance to the wintry winds,\r\nand ventured on the frail surface. Skaters, in great numbers, of\r\nfirst-rate notoriety, executed some of the most difficult movements of\r\nthe art, to universal admiration. A lady and two officers, who performed\r\na reel with a precision scarcely conceivable, received applause so\r\nboisterous as to terrify the fair cause of the general expression, and\r\noccasion her to forego the pleasure she received from the amusement. Two\r\naccidents occurred: a skating lady dislocated the _patella_ or kneepan,\r\nand five gentlemen and a lady were submerged in the frosty fluid, but\r\nwith no other injury than from the natural effect of so cold an embrace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, in consequence of the great accumulation of snow in London,\r\nit became necessary to relieve the roofs of the houses by throwing off\r\nthe load collected upon them. By this means the carriage-ways in the\r\nmiddle of the streets were rendered scarcely passable; and the streams\r\nconstantly flowing from the open plugs, added to the general mass of\r\nice.\r\n\r\nMany coach proprietors, on the northern and western roads, discontinued\r\nto run their coaches. In places where the roads were low, the snow had\r\ndrifted above carriage height. On Finchley-common, by the fall of one\r\nnight, it lay to a depth of sixteen feet, and the road was impassable\r\neven to oxen. On Bagshot-heath and about Esher and Cobham the road was\r\ncompletely choked up. Except the Kent and Essex roads, no others were\r\npassable beyond a few miles from London. The coaches of the western road\r\nremained stationary at different parts. The Windsor coach was worked\r\nthrough the snow at Colnbrook, which was there sixteen feet deep, by\r\nemploying about fifty labourers. At Maidenhead-lane, the snow was still\r\ndeeper; and between Twyford and Reading it assumed a mountainous\r\nappearance. Accounts say that, on parts of Bagshot-heath, description\r\nwould fail to convey an adequate idea of its situation. The Newcastle\r\ncoach went off the road into a pit upwards of eight feet deep, but\r\nwithout mischief to either man or horse. The middle North-road was\r\nimpassable at Highgate-hill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of January, and for some time afterwards, the ice on the\r\nSerpentine in Hyde-park bore a singular appearance, from mountains of\r\nsnow which sweepers had collected together in different situations. The\r\nspaces allotted for the skaters were in circles, squares, and oblongs.\r\nNext to the carriage ride on the north side, many astonishing evolutions\r\nwere performed by the skaters. Skipping on skates, and the Turk-cap\r\nbackwards, were among the most conspicuous. The ice, injured by a\r\npartial thaw in some places, was much _cut up_, yet elegantly dressed\r\nfemales dashed between the hillocks of snow, with great bravery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this time the appearance of the river Thames was most remarkable.\r\nVast pieces of floating ice, laden generally with heaps of snow, were\r\nslowly carried up and down by the tide, or collected where the\r\nprojecting banks or the bridges resisted the flow. These accumulations\r\nsometimes formed a chain of glaciers, which, uniting at one moment, were\r\nat another cracking and bounding against each other in a singular and\r\nawful manner with loud noise. Sometimes these ice islands rose one over\r\nanother, covered with angry foam, and were violently impelled by the\r\nwinds and waves through the arches of the bridges, with tremendous\r\ncrashes. Near the bridges, the floating pieces collected about\r\nmid-water, or while the tide was less forcible, and ranged themselves on\r\neach other; the stream formed them into order by its force as it passed,\r\ntill the narrowness of the channel increased the power of the flood,\r\nwhen a sudden disruption taking place, the masses burst away, and\r\nfloated off. The river was frozen over for the space of a week, and a\r\ncomplete _Frost Fair_ held upon it, as will be mentioned presently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of mail-coaches correspondence had not been so\r\ninterrupted as on this occasion. Internal communication was completely\r\nat a stand till the roads could be in some degree cleared. The entire\r\nface of the country was one uniform sheet of snow; no trace of road was\r\ndiscoverable.\r\n\r\nThe Post-office exerted itself to have the roads cleared for the\r\nconveyance of the mails, and the government interfered by issuing\r\ninstructions to every parish in the kingdom to employ labourers in\r\nreopening the ways.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the midland counties, particularly on the borders of Northamptonshire\r\nand Warwickshire, the snow lay to a height altogether unprecedented. At\r\nDunchurch, a small village on the road to Birmingham, through Coventry,\r\nand for a few miles round that place, in all directions, the drifts\r\nexceeded twenty-four feet, and no tracks of carriages or travellers\r\ncould be discovered, except on the great road, for many days.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge mail coach coming to London, sunk into a hollow of the\r\nroad, and remained with the snow drifting over it, from one o’clock to\r\nnine in the morning, when it was dragged out by fourteen waggon horses.\r\nThe passengers, who were in the coach the whole of the time, were nearly\r\nfrozen to death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, the wind veered to the south-west, and a thaw was speedily\r\ndiscernible. The great fall of the Thames at London-bridge for some days\r\npresented a scene both novel and interesting. At the ebbing of the tide,\r\nhuge fragments of ice were precipitated down the stream with great\r\nviolence, accompanied by a noise, equal to the report of a small piece\r\nof artillery. On the return of the tide, they were forced back; but the\r\nobstacles opposed to their passage through the arches were so great, as\r\nto threaten a total stoppage to the navigation of the river. The thaw\r\ncontinued, and these appearances gradually ceased.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, 28th, and 29th, the roads and streets were nearly\r\nimpassable from floods, and the accumulation of snow. On Sunday the 30th\r\na sharp frost set in, and continued till the following Saturday evening,\r\nthe 5th of February.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Falmouth_ mail coach started from thence for Exeter, after having\r\nproceeded a few miles was overturned, without material injury to the\r\npassengers. With the assistance of an additional pair of horses it\r\nreached the first stage; after which all endeavours to proceed were\r\nfound perfectly useless, and the letters were sent to Bodmin by the\r\nguard on horseback. The Falmouth and Plymouth coach and its passengers\r\nwere obliged to remain at St. Austell.\r\n\r\nAt _Plymouth_, the snow was nearly four feet high in several of the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nAt _Liverpool_, on the 17th of January, Fahrenheit’s thermometer, in the\r\nAthenæum, stood at fifteen degrees; seven below the freezing point. From\r\nthe ice accumulated in the Mersey, boats could not pass over. Almost\r\nall labour without doors was at a stand.\r\n\r\nAt _Gloucester_, Jan. 17. The severity of the frost had not been\r\nexceeded by any that preceded it. The Severn was frozen over, and people\r\nwent to Tewkesbury market across the ice on horseback. The cold was\r\nintense. The thermometer, exposed in a north-eastern aspect, stood at\r\nthirteen degrees, nine below the freezing point. On the eastern coast,\r\nit stood as low as nine and ten; a degree of cold unusual in this\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n_Bristol_, Jan. 18. The frost continued in this city with the like\r\nseverity. The Floating Harbour from Cumberland basin to the Feeder, at\r\nthe bottom of Avon-street, was one continued sheet of ice; and for the\r\nfirst time in the memory of man, the skater made his appearance under\r\nBristol-bridge. The Severn was frozen over at various points, so as to\r\nbear the weight of passengers.\r\n\r\nAt _Whitehaven_, Jan. 18, the frost had increased in severity. All the\r\nponds and streams were frozen; and there was scarcely a pump in the town\r\nthat gave out water. The market was very thinly attended; it having been\r\nfound in many parts impossible to travel until the snow was cut.\r\n\r\nAt _Dublin_, Jan. 14, the snow lay in a quantity unparalleled for half a\r\ncentury. In the course of one day and night, it descended so\r\ninconceivably thick and rapid, as to block up all the roads, and\r\npreclude the possibility of the mail coaches being able to proceed, and\r\nit was even found impracticable to send the mails on horseback. Thus all\r\nintercourse with the interior was cut off, and it was not until the\r\n18th, when an intense frost suddenly commenced, that the communication\r\nwas opened, and several mail bags arrived from the country on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe snow in many of the narrow streets of Dublin, after the footways had\r\nbeen in some measure cleared, was more than six feet. It was nearly\r\nimpossible for any carriage to force a passage, and few ventured on the\r\nhazardous attempt. Accidents, both distressing and fatal, occurred. In\r\nseveral streets and lanes the poorer inhabitants were literally blocked\r\nup in their houses, and in the attempt to go abroad, experienced every\r\nkind of misery. The number of deaths from cold and distress were greater\r\nthan at any other period, unless at the time of the plague. There were\r\neighty funerals on the Sunday before this date. The coffin-makers in\r\nCook-street could with difficulty complete their numerous orders: and\r\nnot a few poor people lay dead in their wretched rooms for several days,\r\nfrom the impossibility of procuring assistance to convey them to the\r\nHospital-fields, and the great difficulty and danger of attempting to\r\nopen the ground, which was very uneven, and where the snow remained in\r\nsome parts, twenty feet deep.\r\n\r\nFrom _Canterbury_, January 25, the communication with the metropolis was\r\nnot open from Monday until Saturday preceding this date, when the snow\r\nwas cut through by the military at Chathamhill, and near Gravesend; and\r\nthe stages proceeded with their passengers. The mail of the Thursday\r\nnight arrived at Canterbury late on Friday evening, the bags having been\r\nconveyed part of the distance upon men’s shoulders. The bags of Friday\r\nand Saturday night arrived together on Sunday morning about ten o’clock.\r\n\r\n_Dalrymple, North Britain_, January 29.--Wednesday, the 26th, was an\r\nepoch ever to be remembered by the inhabitants of this village. The thaw\r\nof that and the preceding day had opened the Doon, formerly “bound like\r\na rock,” to a considerable distance above this; and the melting of the\r\nsnow on the adjacent hills swelled the river beyond its usual height,\r\nand burst up vast fragments of ice and congealed snow. It forced them\r\nforward with irresistible impetuosity, bending trees like willows,\r\ncarrying down Skelton-bridge, and sweeping all before it. The\r\noverwhelming torrent in its awful progress accumulated a prodigious mass\r\nof the frozen element, which, as if in wanton frolic, it heaved out into\r\nthe fields on both sides, covering acres of ground many feet deep.\r\nAlternately loading and discharging in this manner, it came to a door or\r\ntwo in the village, as if to apprize the inhabitants of its powers. The\r\nriver having deserted its wonted channel, endeavoured to make its grand\r\nentry by several courses successively in Saint Valley, and finding no\r\none of them sufficient for its reception, took them altogether, and\r\noverrunning the whole holm at once, appeared here in terrific grandeur,\r\nbetween seven and eight o’clock in the evening, when the moon retreated\r\nbehind a cloud, and the gloom of night added to the horrors of the\r\ntremendous scene. Like a sea, it overflowed all the gardens on the east\r\nside, from the cross to the bridge, and invaded the houses behind by the\r\ndoors and windows, extinguishing the fires in a moment, lifting and\r\ntumbling the furniture, and gushing out at the front doors with\r\nincredible rapidity. Its principal inroad was by the end of a bridge.\r\nHere, while the houses stood as a bank on either side, it came crashing\r\nand roaring up the street in full career, casting forth, within a few\r\nyards of the cross, floats of ice like millstones. The houses on the\r\nwest side were in the same situation with those on the east. At one\r\nplace the water was running on the house-eaves, at another it was near\r\nthe door-head, and midway up the street, it stood three feet and a half\r\nabove the door. Had it advanced five minutes longer in this direction,\r\nthe whole village must have been inundated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this frost a great number of the fish called golden maids, were\r\npicked up on Brighton beach and sold at good prices. They floated ashore\r\nquite blind, having been reduced to that state by the snow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnnexed are a few of the casualties consequent on this great frost. A\r\nwoman was found frozen to death on the Highgate-road. She proved to have\r\nbeen a charwoman, returning from Highgate, where she had been at work,\r\nto Pancras.\r\n\r\nA poor woman named Wood, while crossing Blackheath from Leigh to the\r\nvillage of Charlton, accompanied by her two children, was benighted, and\r\nmissed her way. After various efforts to extricate herself, she fell\r\ninto a hole, and was nearly buried in the snow. From this, however, she\r\ncontrived to escape, and again proceeded; but at length, being\r\ncompletely exhausted, and her children benumbed with cold, she sat down\r\non the trunk of a tree, where, wrapping her children in her cloak, she\r\nendeavoured by loud cries to attract the attention of some passengers.\r\nHer shrieks at length were heard by a waggoner, who humanely waded\r\nthrough the snow to her assistance, and taking her children, who seemed\r\nin a torpid state, in his arms, he conducted her to a public-house; one\r\nof the infants was frozen to death, and the other was recovered with\r\nextreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs some workmen were clearing away the snow, which was twelve feet deep,\r\nat Kipton, on the border of Northamptonshire, the body of a child about\r\nthree years old was discovered, and immediately afterwards the body of\r\nits mother. She was the wife of a soldier of the 16th regiment,\r\nreturning home with her infant after accompanying her husband to the\r\nplace of embarkation. It was supposed they had been a week in the snow.\r\n\r\nThere was found lying in the road leading from Longford to Upham, frozen\r\nto death, a Mr. Apthorne, a grazier, at Coltsworth. He had left Hounslow\r\nat dusk on Monday evening, after having drank rather freely, and\r\nproposed to go that night to Marlow.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Wakefield market, Mr. Husband, of Holroyd Hall, was\r\nfrozen to death, within little more than a hundred yards of the house of\r\nhis nephew, with whom he resided.\r\n\r\nMr. Chapman, organist, and master of the central school at Andover,\r\nHants, was frozen to death near Wallop, in that county.\r\n\r\nA young man named Monk, while driving a stage-coach near Ryegate, was\r\nthrown off the box on a lump of frozen snow, and killed on the spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thermometer during this intense frost was as low as 7° and 8° of\r\nFahrenheit, in the neighbourhood of London. There are instances of its\r\nhaving been lower in many seasons, but so long a continuance of very\r\ncold weather was never experienced in this climate within the memory of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Frost Fair--1814.~\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 30th of January, the immense masses of ice that floated\r\nfrom the upper parts of the river, in consequence of the thaw on the two\r\npreceding days, blocked up the Thames between Blackfriars and London\r\nBridges; and afforded every probability of its being frozen over in a\r\nday or two. Some adventurous persons even now walked on different parts,\r\nand on the next day, Monday the 31st, the expectation was realized.\r\nDuring the whole of the afternoon, hundreds of people were assembled on\r\nBlackfriars and London Bridges, to see people cross and recross the\r\nThames on the ice. At one time seventy persons were counted walking from\r\nQueenhithe to the opposite shore. The frost of Sunday night so united\r\nthe vast mass as to render it immovable by the tide.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, February 1, the river presented a thoroughly solid surface\r\nover that part which extends from Blackfriars Bridge to some distance\r\nbelow Three Crane Stairs, at the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside. The\r\nwatermen placed notices at the end of all the streets leading to the\r\ncity side of the river, announcing a safe footway over, which attracted\r\nimmense crowds, and in a short time thousands perambulated the rugged\r\nplain, where a variety of amusements were provided. Among the more\r\ncurious of these was the ceremony of roasting a small sheep, or rather\r\ntoasting or burning it over a coal fire, placed in a large iron pan. For\r\na view of this extraordinary spectacle, sixpence was demanded, and\r\nwillingly paid. The delicate meat, when _done_, was sold at a shilling a\r\nslice, and termed “_Lapland mutton_.” There were a great number of\r\nbooths ornamented with streamers, flags, and signs, and within them\r\nthere was a plentiful store of favourite luxuries with most of the\r\nmultitude, _gin_, _beer_, and _gingerbread_. The thoroughfare opposite\r\nThree Crane Stairs was complete and well frequented. It was strewed with\r\nashes, and afforded a very safe, although a very rough path. Near\r\nBlackfriars Bridge, however, the way was not equally severe; a plumber,\r\nnamed _Davis_, having imprudently ventured to cross with some lead in\r\nhis hands, sank between two masses of ice, and rose no more. Two young\r\nwomen nearly shared a similar fate; they were rescued from their\r\nperilous situation by the prompt efforts of two watermen. Many a fair\r\nnymph indeed was embraced in the _icy arms_ of old Father Thames;--three\r\nyoung quakeresses had a sort of semi-bathing, near London Bridge, and\r\nwhen landed on terra-firma, made the best of their way through the\r\nBorough, amidst the shouts of an admiring populace. From the entire\r\nobstruction the tide did not appear to ebb for some days more than one\r\nhalf the usual mark.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Feb. 2, the sports were repeated, and the Thames presented\r\na complete “FROST FAIR.” The grand “mall” or walk now extended from\r\nBlackfriars Bridge to London Bridge; this was named the “City-road,” and\r\nwas lined on each side by persons of all descriptions. Eight or ten\r\nprinting presses were erected and numerous pieces commemorative of the\r\n“great frost” were printed on the ice. Some of these frosty typographers\r\ndisplayed considerable taste in their specimens. At one of the presses,\r\nan orange-coloured standard was hoisted, with the watch-word “ORANGE\r\nBOVEN,” in large characters. This was in allusion to the recent\r\nrestoration of the stadtholder to the government of Holland, which had\r\nbeen for several years under the dominion of the French. From this press\r\nthe following papers were issued.\r\n\r\n“FROST FAIR.\r\n\r\n    “Amidst the arts which on the THAMES appear,\r\n    To tell the wonders of this _icy_ year,\r\n    PRINTING claims prior place, which at one view\r\n    Erects a monument of THAT and YOU.”\r\n\r\n_Another:_\r\n\r\n    “You that walk here, and do design to tell\r\n    Your children’s children what this year befell,\r\n    Come, buy this print, and it will then be seen\r\n    That such a year as this has seldom been.”\r\n\r\nAnother of these _stainers of paper_ addressed the spectators in the\r\nfollowing terms, “Friends, now is your time to support the freedom of\r\nthe press. Can the press have greater liberty? here you find it working\r\nin the middle of the Thames; and if you encourage us by buying our\r\nimpressions, we will keep it going in the true spirit of liberty during\r\nthe frost.” One of the articles printed and sold contained the following\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    “Behold, the river Thames is frozen o’er,\r\n    Which lately ships of mighty burden bore;\r\n    Now different arts and pastimes here you see,\r\n    But printing claims the superiority.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord’s prayer and several other pieces were issued from these icy\r\nprinting offices, and bought with the greatest avidity.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Feb. 3, the number of adventurers increased. Swings,\r\nbookstalls, dancing in a barge, suttling-booths, playing at skittles,\r\nand almost every appendage of a fair on land, appeared now on the\r\nThames. Thousands flocked to this singular spectacle of sports and\r\npastimes. The ice seemed to be a solid rock, and presented a truly\r\npicturesque appearance. The view of St. Paul’s and of the city with the\r\nwhite foreground had a very singular effect;--in many parts, mountains\r\nof ice upheaved resembled the rude interior of a stone quarry.\r\n\r\nFriday, Feb. 4. Each day brought a fresh accession of “pedlars to sell\r\ntheir wares;” and the greatest rubbish of all sorts was raked up and\r\nsold at double and treble the original cost. Books and toys, labelled\r\n“bought on the Thames,” were in profusion. The _watermen_ profited\r\nexceedingly, for each person paid a toll of twopence or threepence\r\nbefore he was admitted to “Frost Fair;” some douceur was expected on the\r\nreturn. Some of them were said to have taken six pounds each in the\r\ncourse of a day.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, about five o’clock, three persons, an old man and two\r\nlads, were on a piece of ice above London-bridge, which suddenly\r\ndetached itself from the main body, and was carried by the tide through\r\none of the arches. They laid themselves down for safety, and the boatmen\r\nat Billingsgate, put off to their assistance, and rescued them from\r\ntheir impending danger. One of them was able to walk, but the other two\r\nwere carried, in a state of insensibility, to a public-house, where they\r\nreceived every attention their situation required.\r\n\r\nMany persons were on the ice till late at night, and the effect by\r\n_moonlight_ was singularly novel and beautiful. The bosom of the Thames\r\nseemed to rival the frozen climes of the north.\r\n\r\nSaturday, Feb. 5. This morning augured unfavourably for the continuance\r\nof “FROST FAIR.” The wind had veered to the south, and there was a light\r\nfall of snow. The visitors, however, were not to be deterred by trifles.\r\nThousands again ventured, and there was still much life and bustle on\r\nthe frozen element; the footpath in the centre of the river was hard and\r\nsecure, and among the pedestrians were four donkies; they trotted a\r\nnimble pace, and produced considerable merriment. At every glance, there\r\nwas a novelty of some kind or other. Gaming was carried on in all its\r\nbranches. Many of the itinerant admirers of the profits gained by _E O\r\nTables_, _Rouge et Noir_, _Te-totum_, wheel of fortune, the garter, &c.\r\nwere industrious in their avocations, and some of their customers left\r\nthe lures without a penny to pay the passage over a plank to the shore.\r\nSkittles was played by several parties, and the drinking tents were\r\nfilled by females and their companions, dancing reels to the sound of\r\nfiddles, while others sat round large fires, drinking rum, grog, and\r\nother spirits. Tea, coffee, and eatables, were provided in abundance,\r\nand passengers were invited to eat by way of recording their visit.\r\nSeveral tradesmen, who at other times were deemed respectable, attended\r\nwith their wares, and sold books, toys, and trinkets of almost every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, the concourse thinned; rain began to fall, and the\r\nice to crack, and on a sudden it floated with the printing presses,\r\nbooths, and merry-makers, to the no small dismay of publicans,\r\ntypographers, shopkeepers, and sojourners.\r\n\r\nA short time previous to the general dissolution, a person near one of\r\nthe printing presses, handed the following _jeu d’esprit_ to its\r\nconductor; requesting that it might be printed on the Thames.\r\n\r\n_To Madam Tabitha Thaw._\r\n\r\n  “Dear dissolving dame,\r\n\r\n“FATHER FROST and SISTER SNOW have _Boneyed_ my borders, formed an _idol\r\nof ice_ upon my bosom, and all the LADS OF LONDON come to make merry:\r\nnow as you love mischief, treat the multitude with a few CRACKS by a\r\nsudden visit, and obtain the prayers of the poor upon both banks. _Given\r\nat my own press_, the 5th Feb. 1814.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS THAMES.”\r\n\r\nThe _thaw_ advanced more rapidly than indiscretion and heedlessness\r\nretreated. Two genteel-looking young men ventured on the ice above\r\nWestminster Bridge, notwithstanding the warnings of the watermen. A\r\nlarge mass on which they stood, and which had been loosened by the flood\r\ntide, gave way, and they floated down the stream. As they passed under\r\nWestminster Bridge they cried piteously for help. They had not gone far\r\nbefore they sat down, near the edge; this overbalanced the mass, they\r\nwere precipitated into the flood, and overwhelmed for ever.\r\n\r\nA publican named Lawrence, of the Feathers, in High Timber-street,\r\nQueenhithe, erected a booth on the Thames opposite Brook’s-wharf, for\r\nthe accommodation of the curious. At nine at night he left it in the\r\ncare of two men, taking away all the liquors, except some gin, which he\r\ngave them for their own use.\r\n\r\nSunday, Feb. 6. At two o’clock this morning, the tide began to flow with\r\ngreat rapidity at London Bridge; the thaw assisted the efforts of the\r\ntide, and the booth last mentioned was violently hurried towards\r\nBlackfriars Bridge. There were nine men in it, but in their alarm they\r\nneglected the fire and candles, which communicating with the covering,\r\nset it in a flame. They succeeded in getting into a lighter which had\r\nbroken from its moorings. In this vessel they were wrecked, for it was\r\ndashed to pieces against one of the piers of Blackfriars Bridge: seven\r\nof them got on the pier and were taken off safely; the other two got\r\ninto a barge while passing Puddle-dock.\r\n\r\nOn this day, the Thames towards high tide (about 3 p. m.) presented a\r\nminiature idea of the Frozen Ocean; the masses of ice floating along,\r\nadded to the great height of the water, formed a striking scene for\r\ncontemplation. Thousands of disappointed persons thronged the banks; and\r\nmany a ’prentice, and servant maid, “sighed unutterable things,” at the\r\nsudden and unlooked for destruction of “FROST FAIR.”\r\n\r\nMonday, Feb. 7. Immense fragments of ice yet floated, and numerous\r\nlighters, broken from their moorings, drifted in different parts of the\r\nriver; many of them were complete wrecks. The frozen element soon\r\nattained its wonted fluidity, and old Father Thames looked as cheerful\r\nand as busy as ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe severest English winter, however astonishing to ourselves, presents\r\nno views comparable to the winter scenery of more northern countries. A\r\nphilosopher and poet of our own days, who has been also a traveller,\r\nbeautifully describes a lake in Germany:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Christmas out of doors at Ratzburg._\r\n\r\nBy S. T. COLERIDGE, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe whole lake is at this time one mass of thick transparent ice, a\r\nspotless mirror of nine miles in extent! The lowness of the hills, which\r\nrise from the shores of the lake, preclude the awful sublimity of Alpine\r\nscenery, yet compensate for the want of it, by beauties of which this\r\nvery lowness is a necessary condition. Yesterday I saw the lesser lake\r\ncompletely hidden by mist; but the moment the sun peeped over the hill,\r\nthe mist broke in the middle, and in a few seconds stood divided,\r\nleaving a broad road all across the lake; and between these two walls of\r\nmist the sunlight burnt upon the ice, forming a road of golden fire,\r\nintolerably bright! and the mist walls themselves partook of the blaze\r\nin a multitude of shining colours. This is our second post. About a\r\nmonth ago, before the thaw came on, there was a storm of wind; during\r\nthe whole night, such were the thunders and howlings of the breaking\r\nice, that they have left a conviction on my mind, that there are sounds\r\nmore sublime than any sight _can_ be, more absolutely suspending the\r\npower of comparison, and more utterly absorbing the mind’s\r\nself-consciousness in its total attention to the object working upon it.\r\nPart of the ice, which the vehemence of the wind had shattered, was\r\ndriven shoreward, and froze anew. On the evening of the next day at\r\nsunset, the shattered ice thus frozen appeared of a deep blue, and in\r\nshape like an agitated sea; beyond this, the water that ran up between\r\nthe great islands of ice which had preserved their masses entire and\r\nsmooth, shone of a yellow green; but all these scattered ice islands\r\nthemselves were of an intensely bright blood colour--they seemed blood\r\nand light in union! On some of the largest of these islands, the\r\nfishermen stood pulling out their immense nets through the holes made in\r\nthe ice for this purpose, and the men, their net poles, and their huge\r\nnets, were a part of the glory--say rather, it appeared as if the rich\r\ncrimson light had shaped itself into these forms, figures, and\r\nattitudes, to make a glorious vision in mockery of earthly things.\r\n\r\nThe lower lake is now all alive with skaters and with ladies driven\r\nonward by them in their ice cars. Mercury surely was the first maker of\r\nskates, and the wings at his feet are symbols of the invention. In\r\nskating, there are three pleasing circumstances--the infinitely subtle\r\nparticles of ice which the skaters cut up, and which creep and run\r\nbefore the skate like a low mist and in sunrise or sunset become\r\ncoloured; second, the shadow of the skater in the water, seen through\r\nthe transparent ice; and third, the melancholy undulating sound from the\r\nskate not without variety; and when very many are skating together, the\r\nsounds and the noises give an impulse to the icy trees, and the woods\r\nall round the lake _trinkle_.\r\n\r\n      In the frosty season when the sun\r\n    Was set, and visible for many a mile,\r\n    The cottage windows through the twilight blazed,\r\n    I heeded not the summons;--happy time\r\n    It was indeed for all of us, to me\r\n    It was a time of rapture! clear and loud\r\n    The village clock tolled six! I wheel’d about\r\n    Proud and exulting, like an untired horse\r\n    That cared not for its home. All shod with steel\r\n    We hissed along the polished ice, in games\r\n    Confederate, imitative of the chase\r\n    And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,\r\n    The pack loud bellowing and the hunted hare.\r\n    So through the darkness and the cold we flew,\r\n    And not a voice was idle; with the din,\r\n    Meanwhile the precipices rang aloud,\r\n    The leafless trees and every icy crag\r\n    Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills\r\n    Into the tumult sent an alien sound\r\n    Of melancholy--not unnoticed, while the stars\r\n    Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west\r\n    The orange sky of evening died away.\r\n\r\n      Not seldom from the uproar I retired\r\n    Into a silent bay, or sportively\r\n    Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng\r\n    To cut across the image of a star\r\n    That gleamed upon the ice; and oftentimes\r\n    Where we had given our bodies to the wind,\r\n    And all the shadowy banks on either side\r\n    Came sweeping through the darkness, shunning still\r\n    The rapid line of motion, then at once\r\n    Have I, reclining back upon my heels,\r\n    Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs\r\n    Wheeled by me even as if the earth had rolled\r\n    With visible motion her diurnal round!\r\n    Behind me did they stretch in solemn train\r\n    Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched\r\n    Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.\r\n\r\n  _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n~Skating.~\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of skating in England is obtained from the earliest\r\ndescription of London. Its historian relates that, “when the great fenne\r\nor moore (which watereth the walles of the citie on the north side) is\r\nfrozen, many young men play upon the yce.” Happily, and probably for\r\nwant of a term to call it by, he describes so much of this pastime in\r\nMoorfields, as acquaints us with their mode of skating: “Some,” he says,\r\n“stryding as wide as they may, doe slide swiftly,” this then is sliding;\r\nbut he proceeds to tell us, that “some tye bones to their feete, and\r\nunder their heeles, and shoving themselves by a little picked staffe doe\r\nslide as swiftly as a birde flyeth in the air, or an arrow out of a\r\ncrosse-bow.”[37] Here, although the implements were rude, we have\r\nskaters; and it seems that one of their sports was for two to start a\r\ngreat way off opposite to each other, and when they met, to lift their\r\npoles and strike each other, when one or both fell, and were carried to\r\na distance from each other by the celerity of their motion. Of the\r\npresent wooden skates, shod with iron, there is no doubt, we obtained a\r\nknowledge from Holland.\r\n\r\nThe icelanders also used the shankbone of a deer or sheep about a foot\r\nlong, which they greased, because they should not be stopped by drops of\r\nwater upon them.[38]\r\n\r\nIt is asserted in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” that Edinburgh produced\r\nmore instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other country, and\r\nthat the institution of a skating club there contributed to its\r\nimprovement. “I have however seen, some years back,” says Mr. Strutt,\r\n“when the Serpentine river was frozen over, four gentlemen there dance,\r\nif I may be allowed the expression, a double minuet in skates with as\r\nmuch ease, and I think more elegance, than in a ball room; others again,\r\nby turning and winding with much adroitness, have readily in succession\r\ndescribed upon the ice the form of all the letters in the alphabet.” The\r\nsame may be observed there during every frost, but the elegance of\r\nskaters on that sheet of water is chiefly exhibited in quadrilles, which\r\nsome parties go through with a beauty scarcely imaginable by those who\r\nhave not seen graceful skating. In variety of attitude, and rapidity of\r\nmovement, the Dutch, who, of necessity, journey long distances on their\r\nrivers and canals, are greatly our superiors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·35.\r\n\r\n  [35] See vol.

Hilary Term begins.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARKING.\r\n\r\nIt appears that our ingenious neighbours, the French, are rivalled by\r\nthe lark-catchers of Dunstaple, in the mode of attracting those birds.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _6, Bermondsey New Road_\r\n\r\n  _January 18, 1826._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nIn the present volume of your _Every-Day Book_, p. 91, a correspondent\r\nat Abbeville has given an account of lark-shooting in that country, in\r\nwhich he mentions a machine called a _miroir_, as having been used for\r\nthe purpose of attracting the birds within shot. Perhaps you are not\r\naware that in many parts of England a similar instrument is employed for\r\ncatching the lark when in flight, and at Dunstaple. At that place,\r\npersons go out with what is called a larking glass, which is, if I may\r\nso term it, a machine made somewhat in the shape of a cucumber. This\r\ninvention is hollow, and has holes cut round it, in which bits of\r\nlooking-glass are fitted; it is fixed on a pole, and has a sort of reel,\r\nfrom which a line runs; this line, at a convenient distance, is worked\r\nbackward and forward, so as to catch the rays of the sun: the larks\r\nseeing themselves in the glass, as some think, but more probably blinded\r\nby the glare of it, come headlong down to it, a net is drawn over them,\r\nand thus many are taken, deceived like ourselves with glittering\r\nsemblances. Yes! lords as we deem ourselves of the creation, we are as\r\neasily lured by those who bait our passions or propensities, as those\r\npoor birds. This simple truth I shall conclude with the following lines,\r\nwhich, be they good, bad, or indifferent, are my own, and such as they\r\nare I give them to thee:--\r\n\r\n    As in the fowler’s glass the lark espies\r\n    His feath’ry form from ’midst unclouded skies;\r\n    And pleased, and dazzled with the novel sight,\r\n    Wings to the treacherous earth his rapid flight,\r\n    So, in the glass of self conceit we view\r\n    Our soul’s attraction, and pursue it too,\r\n    In every shape wherein it may arise,\r\n    In gold, or land, or love before our eyes,\r\n    And in the wary net are captive ta’en,\r\n    By the sure hand of woman, or of gain.\r\n\r\n  _S.

PAUL’S DAY.\r\n\r\n_Buck and Doe in St. Paul’s Cathedral._\r\n\r\nFormerly a buck’s head was carried in procession at St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral. This by some antiquaries is presumed to have been the\r\ncontinuation of a ceremony in more ancient times when, according to\r\ncertain accounts, a heathen temple existed on that site. It is\r\nremarkable that this notion as to the usage is repeated by writers whose\r\nexperience in other respects has obtained them well-earned regard: the\r\norigin of this custom, is stated by Stow to the following purport.\r\n\r\nMentioning the opinion already noticed, which, strange to tell, has been\r\nurged ever since his time, he says in its refutation, “But true it is I\r\nhave read an ancient deed to this effect,” and the “effect” is, that in\r\n1274, the dean and chapter of St. Paul’s granted twenty-two acres of\r\nland, part of their manor of Westley, in Essex, to sir William Baud,\r\nknt., for the purpose of being enclosed by him within his park of\r\nCuringham; in consideration whereof he undertook to bring to them on the\r\nfeast day of the Conversion of St. Paul, in winter, a good doe,\r\nseasonable and sweet; and upon the feast of the commemoration of St.\r\nPaul in summer, a good buck, and offer the same to be spent (or divided)\r\namong the canons resident; the doe to be brought by one man at the hour\r\nof procession, and through the procession to the high altar, and the\r\nbringer to have nothing; the buck to be brought by all his men in like\r\nmanner, and they to be paid twelve pence only, by the chamberlain of\r\nthe church, and no more to be required. For the performance of this\r\nannual present of venison, he charged his lands and bound his heirs; and\r\ntwenty seven years afterwards, his son, sir Walter, confirmed the grant.\r\n\r\nThe observance of this ceremony, as to the _buck_, was very curious, and\r\nin this manner. On the aforesaid feast-day of the commemoration, the\r\n_buck_ being brought up to the steps of the high altar in St. Paul’s\r\nchurch at the hour of procession, and the dean and chapter being\r\napparelled in their copes and vestments, with garlands of roses on their\r\nheads, they sent the body of the buck to be baked; and having fixed the\r\nhead on a pole, caused it to be borne before the cross in their\r\nprocession within the church, until they issued out of the west door.\r\nThere the keeper that brought it blew “the death of the buck,” and then\r\nthe horners that were about the city answered him in like manner. For\r\nthis the dean and chapter gave each man fourpence in money and his\r\ndinner, and the keeper that brought it was allowed during his abode\r\nthere, meat, drink and lodging, at the dean and chapter’s charges, and\r\nfive shillings in money at his going away, together with a loaf of\r\nbread, with the picture of St. Paul on it. It appears also that the\r\ngranters of the venison presented to St. Paul’s cathedral two special\r\nsuits of vestments, to be worn by the clergy on those two days; the one\r\nbeing embroidered with bucks, and the other with does.\r\n\r\nThe translator of Dupre’s work on the “Conformity between modern and\r\nancient ceremonies,” also misled by other authorities, presumed that the\r\n“bringing up a fat buck to the altar of St. Paul’s with hunters, horns\r\nblowing, &c. in the middle of divine service,” was of heathen\r\nderivation, whereas we see it was only a provision for a venison feast\r\nby the Romish clergy, in return for some waste land of one of their\r\nmanors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 35·10.\r\n\r\n  [39] See vol. i. p. 175.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_“St. George he was for England.”_\r\n\r\nSo says a well-known old ballad, and we are acquainted, by the following\r\ncommunication, that our patron saint still appears _in_ England,\r\nthrough his personal representatives, at this season of the year.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nI send you an account of the Christmas drama of “St. George,” as acted\r\nin Cornwall, subscribing also my name and address, which you properly\r\ndeem an indispensable requisite.

(not\r\nomitting even the cushion dance,) with more glee than I ever slided\r\nthrough the _chaine anglaise_, or _demi-queue de chat_, and have formed\r\nacquaintance with the master of the revels, or leader of the parish\r\nchoir, (generally a shrewd fellow, well versed in song,) in most of the\r\nwestern parishes in Cornwall; and from them have picked up much\r\ninformation on those points, which personal observation alone had not\r\nsupplied to my satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure that “St. George” with his attendants were personages\r\ntoo remarkable not to attract much of my attention, and I have had their\r\nadventures represented frequently; from different versions so obtained,\r\nI am enabled to state that the performances in different parishes vary\r\nonly in a slight degree from each other.\r\n\r\nSt. George and the other tragic performers are dressed out somewhat in\r\nthe style of morris-dancers, in their shirt-sleeves, and white trowsers\r\nmuch decorated with ribands and handkerchiefs, each carrying a drawn\r\nsword in his hand, if they can be procured, otherwise a cudgel. They\r\nwear high caps of pasteboard, adorned with beads, small pieces of\r\nlooking-glass, coloured paper, &c.; several long strips of pith\r\ngenerally hang down from the top, with small pieces of different\r\ncoloured cloth, strung on them: the whole has a very smart effect.\r\n\r\nFather _Christmas_ is personified in a grotesque manner, as an ancient\r\nman, wearing a large mask and wig, and a huge club, wherewith he keeps\r\nthe bystanders in order.\r\n\r\nThe _doctor_, who is generally the merry-andrew of the piece, is dressed\r\nin any ridiculous way, with a wig, three-cornered hat, and painted face.\r\n\r\nThe other comic characters are dressed according to fancy.\r\n\r\nThe _female_, where there is one, is usually in the dress worn half a\r\ncentury ago.\r\n\r\nThe _hobby-horse_, which is a character sometimes introduced, wears a\r\nrepresentation of a horse’s hide.\r\n\r\nBesides the regular drama of “St. George,” many parties of mummers go\r\nabout in fancy dresses of every sort, most commonly the males in female\r\nattire, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nThis Christmas play, it appears, is, or was in vogue also in the north\r\nof England as well as in Scotland. A correspondent of yours (Mr.\r\nReddock) has already given an interesting account of that in Scotland,\r\nand a copy of that acted at Newcastle, printed there some thirty or\r\nforty years since, is longer than any I have seen in the west. By some\r\nthe play is considered to have reference to the time of the crusades,\r\nand to have been introduced on the return of the adventurers from the\r\nHoly-Land, as typifying their battles. Before proceeding with our drama\r\nin the west, I have merely to observe that the old fashion was to\r\ncontinue many of the Christmas festivities till Candlemas-day, (February\r\n2,) and then “throw cards and candlesticks away.”\r\n\r\n_Battle of St. George._\r\n\r\n[_One of the party steps in, crying out_--\r\n\r\n    Room, a room, brave gallants, room,\r\n    Within this court\r\n    I do resort,\r\n    To show some sport\r\n    And pastime,\r\n    Gentlemen and ladies, in the Christmas time--\r\n\r\n[_After this note of preparation, old Father Christmas capers into the\r\nroom, saying,_\r\n\r\n    Here comes I, old Father Christmas,\r\n      Welcome, or welcome not,\r\n    I hope old Father Christmas\r\n      Will never be forgot.\r\n\r\nI was born in a rocky country, where there was no wood to make me a\r\ncradle; I was rocked in a stouring bowl, which made me round shouldered\r\nthen, and I am round shouldered still.\r\n\r\n  [_He then frisks about the room, until he thinks he has sufficiently\r\n  amused the spectators, when he makes his exit with this speech,_\r\n\r\nWho went to the orchard, to steal apples to make gooseberry pies against\r\nChristmas?\r\n\r\n  [_These prose speeches, you may suppose, depend much upon the\r\n  imagination of the actor._\r\n\r\n_Enter Turkish Knight._\r\n\r\n    Here comes I, a Turkish knight,\r\n    Come from the Turkish land to fight,\r\n    And if St. George do meet me here\r\n    I’ll try his courage without fear.\r\n\r\n    _Enter St. George._\r\n\r\n    Here comes I, St. George; that worthy champion bold,\r\n    And, with my sword and spear, I won three crowns of gold.\r\n    I fought the dragon bold, and brought him to the slaughter,\r\n    By that I gained fair Sabra, the king of Egypt’s daughter.\r\n\r\n    _T.

In some of the performances, two or three other\r\ntragic heroes are brought forward, as the king of Egypt and his son,\r\n&c.; but they are all of them much in the style of that I have just\r\ndescribed, varying somewhat in length and number of characters.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your constant reader,\r\n\r\n  W.

The alteration of the standard this year, in order to its\r\nuniformity throughout the kingdom, however inconvenient to individuals\r\nin its first application, will be ultimately of the highest public\r\nadvantage. The difference between beer, wine, corn, and coal measure,\r\nand the difference of measures of the same denomination in different\r\ncounties, were occasions of fraud and grievance without remedy until the\r\npresent act of parliament commenced to operate. In the twelfth year of\r\nHenry VII. a standard was established, and the table was kept in the\r\ntreasury of the king’s exchequer, with drawings on it, commemorative of\r\nthe regulation, and illustrating its principles. The original document\r\npassed into the collection of the liberal Harley, earl of Oxford, and\r\nthere being a print of it with some of its pictorial representations, an\r\nengraving is here given of the mode of trial which it exhibits as having\r\nbeen used in the exchequer at that period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Trial of Weights and Measures under Henry VII.~]\r\n\r\nFrom the same instrument is also taken the smaller diagram. They are\r\ncurious specimens of the care used by our ancestors to establish and\r\nexemplify rules by which all purchases and sales were to be effected. In\r\nthat view only they are introduced here. Conformity to the new standard\r\nis every man’s business and interest, and daily experience will prove\r\nits wisdom and justice. It would be obviously inexpedient to state any\r\nof the parliamentary provisions in this work, which now merely records\r\none of the most remarkable and laudable acts in the history of our\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·82.\r\n\r\n\r\n~January 28.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Appearance of the Season._\r\n\r\nApology will scarcely be required for introducing a character, who at\r\nthis season of the year comes forth in renovated honours, and may aptly\r\nbe termed one of its _ever-blues_--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Beadle--~]\r\n\r\n    “The great image of authority!”\r\n\r\n  _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\nnot a peculiar of either Farringdons, nor him of Cripplegate, or St.\r\nGiles in the Fields, or of any ward or precinct within the bills: not\r\nthis or that “good man”--but the _universal parish beadle_. “How\r\nChristmas and consolatory he looks! how redolent of good cheer is he! He\r\nis a cornucopia--an abundance. What pudding sleeves!--what a collar,\r\nred, and like a beef steak, is his! He is a walking refreshment! He\r\nlooks like a whole parish, full, important--but untaxed. The children of\r\ncharity gaze at him with a modest smile. The straggling boys look on him\r\nwith confidence. They do not pocket their marbles. They do not fly from\r\ntheir familiar gutter. This is a red-letter day; and the cane is\r\nreserved for to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nFor the pleasant verbal description we are indebted to an agreeable\r\nwriter in the “London Magazine;”[40] his corporal lineaments are\r\n“borrowed” (with permission) from a new caricature,[41] if it may be\r\ngiven so low a name, wherein this figure stands out, the very gem and\r\njewel, in a grouping of characters of all sorts and denominations\r\nassembled with “infinite fancy” and “fun,” to illustrate the designer’s\r\nviews of the age. It is a graphic satire of character rather than\r\ncaricatura; mostly of class-characters, not persons; wherein the\r\nridicule bears heavily, but is broad and comprehensive enough to shift\r\nfrom one neighbour to another.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe print, wherein our beadle is foremost, though not first, is one of\r\nthe pleasantest “drolls” of the century, and seems to hit at all that\r\nis. In this whimsical representation, a painted show-board, at the\r\nwindow of a miserable garret, declares it to be “The Office of the\r\nPeruvian Mining Company.” On the casement of the first floor, in the\r\nsame hereditament of poverty, is a bill of “Eligant rooms to let.” Wigs\r\nin the shop-window illustrate the punning announcement above it--“Nature\r\nimproved by Rickets,” which is the name of the proprietor, a capital\r\nbarber, who stands at the door, and points to a ragged inscription\r\ndepending from the parti-coloured pole of his art, from whence we learn\r\nthat “Nobody is to be s( )aved during di( )ine service, by command of\r\nthe magistracy.” He enforces attention to this fact on an unshaved\r\nitinerant, with “Subscription for putting down Bartlemy fair” placarded\r\non his back. This fellow has a pole in his right hand for “The\r\npreservation of public morals,” and a puppet of punch lolling from his\r\nleft coat pocket. An apple-stall is taken care of by a fat body with a\r\nscreaming child, whose goods appear to be coveted by two little beings\r\nuntutored in the management of the eye. We gather from the “New Times,”\r\non the ground, that the fruit woman is Sarah Crumpage, and that she and\r\nRickets, the former for selling fruit, and the latter for shaving on the\r\nSunday, “were convicted on the oath of the notorious Johnson, and fined\r\nten shillings each.” Next to the barber’s is “the Star eating-house,”\r\nwith “Ladies School” on the first-floor casement, and “Mangleing took\r\nin.” At the angle of the penthouse roofs of these dwellings “an angel’s\r\nhead in stone with pigeon’s wings” deceives a hungry cat into an attempt\r\nto commit an assault upon it from the attic window. Opposite the cook’s\r\ndoor an able-bodied waggoner, with a pennon from his whip, inscribed\r\n“Knowledge is Power,” obscures part of another whereon all that remains\r\nis “NICK’S INSTITUTION.” A “steeled butcher,” his left hand resting at\r\nease within his apron, cleaver hung, and carelessly capped, with a\r\ncountenance indicating no other spirit than that of the still, and no\r\ndisposition to study deeper than the bottom of a porter pot, carries the\r\nflag of the “London University:” a well-fed urchin, his son, hangs by\r\nhis father’s sleeve, and drags along a wheeled toy, a lamb--emblem of\r\nmany a future “lamb his riot dooms to bleed.” A knowing little Jewboy,\r\nwith the flag of the “Converted Jews,” relieves the standard-bearer of\r\nthe “School for Adults” from the weight of his pocket handkerchief, and\r\nhis banner hides the letter “d” on another borne by a person of uneven\r\ntemper in canonicals, and hence for “The Church in danger,” we read “The\r\nChurch in anger.” Close at the heels of the latter is an object almost\r\nas miserable, as the exceedingly miserable figure in the frontispiece to\r\nthe “Miseries of Human Life.” This rearward supporter of “the church in\r\ndanger,” alias in “anger,” is a poor, undersized, famine-worn, badged\r\ncharity boy, with a hat abundantly too large for its hydrocephalic\r\ncontents, and a coat to his heels, and in another person’s shoes, a\r\nworld too wide for his own feet--he carries a crooked little wand with\r\n“No Popery” on it; this standard is so low, that it would be lost if the\r\nstandard-bearer were not away from the procession. A passionate person\r\nin a barrister’s wig, with a shillelagh, displays “Catholic Claims.”\r\nOpposite to a church partly built, is a figure clearly designating a\r\ndistinguished preacher of the established church of Scotland in London,\r\nplanting the tallest standard in the scene upright on the ground, from\r\nwhence is unfurled “No Theatre”--the flag-bearer of “The Caledonian\r\nChapel,” stands behind, in the act of tossing up a halfpenny with the\r\nstandard bearer of “No more State Lotteries.” A black mask bears the\r\n“Liberty of the Press.” A well-fed man with bands beneath his chin,\r\nrears a high pole, inscribed “No fat Livings,” and “The cause of Greece”\r\nfollows. A jovial undertaker in his best grave-clothes, raises a mute’s\r\nstaff, and “No Life in London:” this character looks as if he would bury\r\nhis wife comfortably in a country churchyard, get into the return-hearse\r\nwith his companions, and crack nuts and drink wine all the way to town.\r\nA little personage, booted and buttoned up, carries a staff in his\r\npocket, surmounted by a crown, and a switch to his chin, the tip whereof\r\nalone is visible, his entire face and head being wholly concealed by the\r\nhat; this is “The great Unknown”--he has close behind him “Gall and\r\nSpurs-him.” “No Treadmill” is exhibited by a merry rogue, half disarmed,\r\nwith a wooden leg. At a public house, “The Angel and Punch Bowl,--T.\r\nMoore,” the “United Sons of Harmony” hold wassail; their flag is hung at\r\none of the windows, from whence many panes are absent, and themselves\r\nare fighting at the door, and heartily cheered by the standard bearer of\r\n“No Pugilism.” A ferocious looking fellow, riding on a blind horse,\r\nelevates “Martin for Ever,” and makes cruel cuts with his whip on the\r\nback of a youth who is trying to get up behind him with the banner of\r\n“No climbing Boys.” We are now at a corner messuage, denominated\r\n“Prospect House Establishment for Young Ladies, by the Misses Grace and\r\nPrudence Gregory.” The corner opposite is “Seneca House Academy for\r\nYoung Gentlemen, by Dr. Alex. Sanderson.” Prospect House has an\r\n“Assurance” policy, and from one of its windows one of the “young\r\nladies” drops a work by “H. More”--in eager regard of one of the “young\r\ngentlemen” of Seneca-house, who addresses her from his room, with a\r\nreward of merit round his neck. This Romeoing is rendered more scenical\r\nby a tree, whereon hangs a lost kite, papered with a “Prospectus” of\r\nSeneca-house, from whence it appears that pupils bringing a “knife and\r\nfork,” and paying “Twenty Guineas per ann.,” are entitled to “Universal\r\nErudition,” and the utmost attention to their “Morals and Principles.”\r\nNear this place, the representative of “United Schools” fells to the\r\nearth the flag-bearer of “Peace to the World;” while the able supporter\r\nof “Irish Conciliation,” endeavours to settle the difference by the\r\npowerful use of his pole; the affray being complacently viewed by a\r\nhalf-shod, and half-kilted maintainer of “Scotch Charity.” A demure\r\nlooking girl is charged with “Newgatory Instruction.” At her elbow, a\r\nfemale of the order of disorder, so depicted that Hogarth might claim\r\nher for his own, upholds “Fry for ever,” and is in high converse with a\r\nsable friend who keeps “Freedom for the Blacks.” Hopeless idiocy,\r\ncrawling on its knees by the aid of crutches, presents the “March of\r\nMind.” An excellent slippered fruiterer with a tray of apples and pears,\r\nbeguiles the eyes of a young Gobbleton, who displays “Missionary penny\r\nsubscriptions,” and is suffering his hand to abstract wherewithal for\r\nthe satisfaction of his longings. Here too are ludicrous representations\r\nof the supporters of “Whitefield and Wesley,” “Reform,” &c. and a Jewish\r\ndealer in old clothes, covered in duplicate, with the pawnbroker’s sign\r\nupside down, finds wind for “The Equitable Loan.” A wall round\r\nSeneca-house is “contrived a double debt to pay”--proffering seeming\r\nsecurity to the “sightless eyeballs” of over-fond and over-fearful\r\nparents, and being of real use to the artist for the expression of\r\nideas, which the crowding of his scene does not leave room to picture.\r\nThis wall is duly chalked and covered by bills in antithesis. A line of\r\nthe chalkings, by an elision easily supplied, reads, “Ask for War.” One\r\nof the best exhibitions in the print is a youth of the “Tract Society,”\r\nwith a pamphlet entitled “Eternity,” so rolled as to look like a pistol,\r\nwhich he tenders to a besotted brute wearing candidates’ favours in his\r\nhat, and a scroll “Purity of Election.” The villainous countenance of\r\nthe intoxicated wretch is admirable--a cudgel under his arm, his\r\ntattered condition, and a purse hanging from his pocket, tell that he\r\nhas been in fight, and received the wages of his warfare; in the last\r\nstage of drunkenness he drops upon a post inscribed “under Government.”\r\nAmong books strewed on the ground are “Fletcher’s Appeal,” “Family\r\nShakspeare,” “Hohenlohe,” &c.; at the top is a large volume lettered\r\n“Kant,” which, in such a situation, Mr. Wirgman, and other disciples of\r\nthe German philosopher, will only quarrel or smile at, in common with\r\nall who conceive their opinions or intentions misrepresented. In truth\r\nit is only because the print is already well known among the few\r\nlynx-eyed observers of manners that this notice is drawn up. Its\r\nsatire, however well directed in many ways, is too sweeping to be just\r\nevery way, and is in several instances wholly undeserved. The designer\r\ngives evidence however of great capability, and should he execute\r\nanother it will inevitably be better than this, which is, after all, an\r\nextraordinary production.--In witness whereof, and therefrom, is\r\nextracted and prefixed the “Beadle” hereinbefore mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·37.\r\n\r\n  [40] For December, 1822.\r\n\r\n  [41] The Progress of Cant; designed and etched by one of the authors\r\n  of “Odes and Addresses to Great People;” and published by T.

King George III. died. A contemporary kalendarian, in recording\r\nthis memorable fact, observes, that “the slow and solemn sound of St.\r\nPaul’s bell announced the event a short time after, and was heard to a\r\ngreat distance around the country.” He adds, that he was reminded, by\r\nthis “mournful proclamation of departed royalty,” of the following lines\r\nin Heywood’s “Rape of Lucrece,” written to go to a funeral peal from\r\neight bells:\r\n\r\n    Come list and hark, the bell doth toll\r\n    For some but now departing soul,\r\n    Whom even now those ominous fowle,\r\n    The bat, the nightjar, or screech owl,\r\n    Lament; hark! I hear the wilde wolfe howle\r\n    In this black night that seems to scowle,\r\n    All these my black book shall enscrole.\r\n    For hark! still still the bell doth toll\r\n    For some but now departing soul.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity the same agreeable writer improves to discourse on,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bells._\r\n\r\nThe passing bell owes its origin to an idea of sanctity attached to\r\nbells by the early Catholics, who believed that the sound of these holy\r\ninstruments of percussion actually drove the devil away from the soul of\r\nthe departing Christian. Bells were moreover regarded formerly as\r\ndispelling storms, and appeasing the imagined wrath of heaven, as the\r\nfollowing lines from Barnaby Googe will show:--\r\n\r\n    If that the thunder chaunce to rore and stormie tempest shake,\r\n    A woonder is it for to see the wretches howe they quake,\r\n    Howe that no fayth at all they have, nor trust in any thing,\r\n    The clarke doth all the belles forthwith at once in steeple ring:\r\n    With wondrous sound and deeper farre than he was woont before,\r\n    Till in the loftie heavens darke, the thunder bray no more.\r\n    For in these christned belles they thinke, doth lie such powre and\r\n      might\r\n    As able is the tempest great, and storme to vanquish quight.\r\n    I saw myself at Numburg once, a towne in Toring coast,\r\n    A bell that with this title bolde hirself did prowdly boast:\r\n    By name I Mary called am, with sound I put to flight\r\n    The thunder crackes, and hurtfull stormes, and every wicked spright.\r\n    Such things when as these belles can do, no wonder certainlie\r\n    It is, if that the papistes to their tolling always flie,\r\n    When haile, or any raging storme, or tempest comes in sight,\r\n    Or thunder boltes, or lightning fierce, that every place doth\r\n      smight.\r\n\r\n  _Naogeorgus._\r\n\r\nWe find from Brand, that “an old bell at Canterbury required twenty-four\r\nmen, and another thirty-two men, ad sonandum. The noblest peal of ten\r\nbells, without exception, in England, whether tone or tune be\r\nconsidered, is said to be in St. Margaret’s church, Leicester. When a\r\nfull peal was rung, the ringers were said ‘pulsare classicum.’”\r\n\r\nBells were a great object of superstition among our ancestors. Each of\r\nthem was represented to have its peculiar name and virtues, and many are\r\nsaid to have retained great affection for the churches to which they\r\nbelonged, and where they were consecrated. When a bell was removed from\r\nits original and favourite situation, it was sometimes supposed to take\r\na nightly trip to its old place of residence, unless exercised in the\r\nevening, and secured with a chain or rope. Mr Warner, in his\r\n“Hampshire,” enumerates the virtues of a bell, by translating two lines\r\nfrom the “Helpe to Discourse.”\r\n\r\n    Men’s deaths I tell by doleful knell.\r\n    Lightning and thunder I break asunder.\r\n    On sabbath all to church I call.\r\n    The sleepy head I raise from bed.\r\n    The winds so fierce I doe disperse.\r\n    Men’s cruel rage I do asswage.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Wiltshire legend of a tenor bell having been conjured\r\ninto the river; with lines by the ringer, who lost it through his\r\npertinacious garrulity, and which say:\r\n\r\n    In spite of all the devils in hell\r\n    Here comes our old Bell.[42]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBaron Holberg says he was in a company of men of letters, where several\r\nconjectures were offered concerning the origin of the word _campana_; a\r\n_klocke_, (i. e. bell) in the northern tongues. On his return home, he\r\nconsulted several writers. Some, he says, think the word _klocke_ to be\r\nof the northern etymology; these words, _Ut cloca habeatur in ecclesia_,\r\noccurring in the most ancient histories of the north. It appears from\r\nhence, that in the infancy of Christianity, the word _cloca_ was used in\r\nthe north instead of _campana_. Certain french writers derive the word\r\n_cloca_ from cloche, and this again from _clocher_, i. e. to limp; for,\r\nsay they, as a person who limps, falls from one side to the other, so do\r\n_klocks_ (bells) when rung. Some have recourse to the latin word\r\n_clangor_, others recur to the greek καλεω, I call; some even deduce it\r\nfrom the word _cochlea_, a snail, from the resemblance of its shell to a\r\nbell. As to the latin word _campana_, it was first used in Italy, at\r\nNola in Campania; and it appears that the greater bells only were called\r\n_campana_, and the lesser _nola_. The invention of them is generally\r\nattributed to bishop Paulinus; but this certainly must be understood\r\nonly of the religious use of them; it being plain, from Roman writers,\r\nthat they had the like machines called _tintinnabula_.\r\n\r\nThe use of bells continued long unknown in the east, the people being\r\ncalled to public worship by strokes of wooden hammers; and to this day\r\nthe Turks proclaim the beginning of their service, by vociferations from\r\nthe steeple. Anciently priests themselves used to toll the bell,\r\nespecially in cathedrals and great churches, and these were\r\ndistinguished by the appellation of _campanarii_. The Roman Catholics\r\nchristen their bells, and godfathers assist at the solemnity; thus\r\nconsecrating them to religious use. According to Helgaudus, bells had\r\ncertain names given them like men; and Ingulphus says, “he ordered two\r\ngreat clocks (bells) to be made, which were called Bartholomeus and\r\nBettelinus, and two lesser, Pega and Bega.” The time is perhaps\r\nuncertain when the hours first began to be distinguished by the striking\r\nof a bell. In the empire this custom is said to have been introduced by\r\na priest of Ripen, named Elias, who lived in the twelfth century; and\r\nthis the _Chronicon Anonymi Ripense_ says of him, _hic dies et horas\r\ncampanarum pulsatione distinxit_. The use of them soon became extended\r\nfrom their original design to other solemnities, and especially burials:\r\nwhich incessant tolling has long been complained of as a public\r\nnuisance, and to this the french poet alludes:--\r\n\r\n    Pour honorer les morts, ils font mourir les vivans.\r\n\r\nBesides the common way of tolling bells, there is also ringing, which is\r\na kind of chimes used on various occasions in token of joy. This ringing\r\nprevails in no country so much as in England, where it is a kind of\r\ndiversion, and, for a piece of money, any one may have a peal. On this\r\naccount it is, that England is called _the ringing island_. Chimes are\r\nsomething very different, and much more musical; there is not a town in\r\nall the Netherlands without them, being an invention of that country.\r\nThe chimes at Copenhagen, are one of the finest sets in all Europe; but\r\nthe inhabitants, from a pertinacious fondness for old things, or the\r\nbadness of their ear, do not like them so well as the old ones, which\r\nwere destroyed by a conflagration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev.

EDITOR,--Having read in your paper of to-day, that the king of\r\nFrance “has been pleased to grant to the parish of Notre-Dame, at\r\nNismes, two unserviceable _pieces of cannon_ from the arsenal of\r\nMontpellier, for the purpose of forming a _parish bell_” it has\r\noccurred to me that the following description of the practice of\r\n_baptizing bells_, used by the Roman Catholics, may not be unacceptable\r\nto your readers. This account is a true translation from a book entitled\r\n“_Pontificale Romanum, Autoritate Pontificia, impressum Venetiis, 1698.\r\nLib. ii. Cap. de Benedictione Signi vel Campanæ_.” I have run parallel\r\nwith their method of baptizing children and bells, in twelve\r\nparticulars, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Of the Baptism of a Child._       _Of the Baptism of a Bell._\r\n\r\n                                 I.\r\n\r\n  The child must be first           The bell must be first\r\n  baptized, before it can be        baptized, before it may be hung\r\n  accounted one of the church.      in the steeple.\r\n\r\n                                II.\r\n\r\n  The child must be baptized        The bell must be baptized by a\r\n  by a priest or a minister.        bishop or his deputy.\r\n\r\n                               III.\r\n\r\n  In baptizing a child there        In the baptism of a bell, there\r\n  is used holy water, cream,        is used holy water, oil, salt,\r\n  salt, oil, spittle, &c. &c.       cream, tapers for lights, &c.\r\n\r\n                                IV.\r\n\r\n  In baptism, the child             And so it is in the baptism of\r\n  receiveth a name.                 bells.\r\n\r\n                                 V.\r\n\r\n  The child must have               The bell must have godfathers,\r\n  godfathers, &c., &c.              and they must be persons of great\r\n                                    rank.\r\n\r\n                                VI.\r\n\r\n  The child must be washed in       The bell must be washed in\r\n  water.                            water by the hands of the bishop\r\n                                    and priests.\r\n\r\n                               VII.\r\n\r\n  The child must be crossed in      The bell is solemnly crossed by\r\n  baptism.                          the bishop.\r\n\r\n                              VIII.\r\n\r\n  The child must be anointed.       The bell is anointed by the\r\n                                    bishop.\r\n\r\n                                IX.\r\n\r\n  The child must be baptized        The bell is washed and\r\n  in the name of the Holy           anointed, in the name of the\r\n  Trinity.                          Trinity, by the bishop.\r\n\r\n                                 X.\r\n\r\n  At baptism they pray for the      At the baptism of the bell they\r\n  child.                            pray literally _for the bell_.\r\n\r\n                                XI.\r\n\r\n  At the child’s baptism the        There are more psalms read at the\r\n  scriptures are read.              baptism of a bell than at the\r\n                                    baptism of a child; and a gospel\r\n                                    also.\r\n\r\n                               XII.\r\n\r\n  At child-baptism there are        At the baptism of a bell there are\r\n  public prayers made.              more prayers used, and (excepting\r\n                                    salvation) greater things are prayed\r\n  for, and more blessings on the bell, than on the child. But for the\r\n  better proof of this point, I shall here give part of one of the very\r\n  curious prayers put up for the bell at its baptism:--\r\n\r\n  --------Lord grant that wheresoever this holy bell, thus washed (or\r\n  baptized) and blessed, shall sound, all deceits of Satan, all danger\r\n  of whirlwind, thunders, lightnings, and tempests, may be driven away,\r\n  and that devotion may increase in Christian men when they hear it. _O\r\n  Lord, sanctify it by thy Holy Spirit_; that when it sounds in thy\r\n  people’s ears they may adore Thee! May their faith and devotion\r\n  increase, the devil be afraid, and tremble and fly at the sound of it.\r\n  _O Lord, pour upon it thy heavenly blessing_! that the fiery darts of\r\n  the devil may be made to fly backwards at the sound thereof; that it\r\n  may deliver from danger of wind and thunder, &c., &c. And grant, Lord,\r\n  that all that come to the church at the sound of it, may be free from\r\n  all temptations of the devil. _O Lord, infuse into it the heavenly dew\r\n  of thy Holy Ghost_, that the devil may always fly away before the\r\n  sound of it, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the church of Rome concerning bells is, first, that they\r\nhave merit, and pray God for the living and the dead; secondly, that\r\nthey produce devotion in the hearts of believers; thirdly, that they\r\ndrive away storms and tempests; and, fourthly, that they drive away\r\ndevils.\r\n\r\nThe dislike of evil spirits to the sound of bells, is extremely well\r\nexpressed by Wynkin de Worde, in the _Golden Legend_:--“It is said, the\r\nevil spirytes that ben in the region of th’ ayre, doubte moche when they\r\nhere the belles rongen: and this is the cause why the belles ringen whan\r\nit thondreth, and whan grete tempeste and to rages of wether happen, to\r\nthe ende that the feinds and wycked spirytes should ben abashed and\r\nflee, and cease of the movynge of tempeste.”\r\n\r\nAs to the names given to bells, I beg leave to add, that the bells of\r\nLittle Dunmow Priory, in Essex, new cast A. D. 1501, were baptized by\r\nthe following names:--\r\n\r\nPrima in honore _Sancti Michaelis_ Archangeli.\r\n\r\nSecunda in honore _S. Johannis_ Evangelisti.\r\n\r\nTertia in honore _S. Johannis_ Baptisti.\r\n\r\nQuarta in honore _Assumptionis_ beatæ _Mariæ_.\r\n\r\nQuinta in honore _Sancti Trinitatis_, et omnium Sanctorum.\r\n\r\nIn the _clochier_ near St. Paul’s stood the four greatest bells in\r\nEngland, called _Jesus’s bells_; against these sir Miles Partridge\r\nstaked 100_l._, and won them of Henry VIII. at a cast of dice.\r\n\r\nI conclude with remarking, that the Abbé Cancellieri, of Rome, lately\r\npublished a work relative to bells, wherein he has inserted a long\r\nletter, written by Father Ponyard to M. de Saint Vincens, on the history\r\nof bells and steeples. The Abbé wrote this dissertation on the occasion\r\nof two bells having been christened, which were to be placed within the\r\ntower of the capitol.\r\n\r\n  I am, sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  Sept. 11.\r\n\r\n  R.

E. “wise and good” as he was, and he was both--he is now no\r\nmore--would not willingly have misrepresented the doctrines of the\r\nRomish church, though he abhorred that hierarchy. It seems, however,\r\nthat he may be mistaken in affirming, that the Romish church maintains\r\nof bells that “they have merit, and pray God for the living and the\r\ndead.” His affirmation on this point may be taken in too extensive a\r\nsense: It is no doubt a Romish tenet that there is “much virtue in\r\nbells,” but the precise degree allowed to them at this period, it would\r\nbe difficult to determine without the aid of a council.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Hatherleigh, a small town in Devon, exist two remarkable\r\ncustoms:--one, that every morning and evening, soon after the church\r\nclock has struck five and nine, a bell from the same steeple announces\r\nby distant strokes the number of the day of the month--originally\r\nintended, perhaps, for the information of the unlearned villagers: the\r\nother is, that after a funeral the church bells ring a lively peal, as\r\nin other places after a wedding; and to this custom the parishioners are\r\nperfectly reconciled by the consideration that the deceased is removed\r\nfrom a scene of trouble to a state of rest and peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Colman read his Opera of “_Inkle and Yarico_” to the late Dr.\r\nMosely, the Doctor made no reply during the progress of the piece.

He first gave\r\nhis blessing to the lady Elizabeth, bidding her that when she should see\r\nher brother James, she should tell him that it was his father’s last\r\ndesire that he should no more look upon his brother Charles as his\r\neldest brother only, but be obedient to him as his sovereign; and that\r\nthey should love one another, and forgive their father’s enemies. The\r\nking added, “Sweetheart, you will forget this.” “No,” said she, “I shall\r\nnever forget it as long as I live.” He bid her not grieve and torment\r\nherself for him; for it would be a glorious death he should die, it\r\nbeing for the laws and liberties of this land, and for maintaining the\r\ntrue Protestant religion. He recommended to her the reading of “Bishop\r\nAndrews’s Sermons,” “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” and “Archbishop\r\nLaud’s Book against Fisher.” He further told her, that he had forgiven\r\nall his enemies, and hoped God would likewise forgive them. He bade her\r\ntell her mother, that his thoughts had never strayed from her, and that\r\nhis love should be the same to the last. After this he took the duke of\r\nGloucester, being then a child of about seven years of age, upon his\r\nknees, saying to him, “Sweetheart, now they will cut off thy father’s\r\nhead:” upon which the child looked with great earnestness upon him. The\r\nking proceeding, said, “Mark, child, what I say, they will cut off my\r\nhead, and perhaps make thee a king: but mark what I say, you must not be\r\na king so long as your brothers Charles and James do live; for they will\r\ncut off your brothers’ heads when they can catch them, and cut off thy\r\nhead too at last: and therefore I charge you do not be made a king by\r\nthem.” At which the child fetched a deep sigh, and said, “I will be torn\r\nin pieces first.” Which expression falling from a child so young,\r\noccasioned no little joy to the king. This day the warrant for execution\r\nwas passed, signed by fifty-nine of the judges, for the king to die the\r\nnext day, between the hours of ten in the morning and five in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th, “The king having arrived at the place of execution, made a\r\nlong address to colonel Tomlinson; and afterwards turning to the\r\nofficers, he said, ‘Sirs, excuse me for this same: I have a good cause\r\nand a gracious God: I will say no more.’ Then turning to colonel Hacker,\r\nhe said, ‘Take care that you do not put me to pain;’ and said, ‘This and\r\nplease you--’ A gentleman coming near the axe, he said, ‘Take heed of\r\nthe axe--pray take heed of the axe.’ Then speaking to the executioner\r\n(who was masked) he said, ‘I shall say but very short prayers, and when\r\nI thrust out my hands--.’ Then he asked the bishop for his cap, which,\r\nwhen he had put on, he said to the executioner, ‘Does my hair trouble\r\nyou?’ who desiring it might be all put under his cap, it was put up by\r\nthe bishop and executioner. Turning to the bishop, he said, ‘I have a\r\ngood cause, and a gracious God on my side.’ To which the bishop\r\nanswered, ‘There is but one stage more, which, though turbulent and\r\ntroublesome, yet it is a very short one; it will soon carry you a very\r\ngreat way. It will carry you from earth to heaven; and there you will\r\nfind, to your great joy, the prize you hasten to,--a crown of glory.’\r\nThe king added, ‘I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown,\r\nwhere no disturbance is, no disturbance in the world.’ The bishop\r\nreplied, ‘You are exchanged from a temporal to an eternal crown, a good\r\nexchange.’ Then the king asked the executioner if his hair was well.\r\nAfter which, putting off his cloak, doublet, and his George, he gave the\r\nlatter to the bishop, saying, ‘Remember.’ After this he put on his cloak\r\nagain over his waistcoat, inquiring of the executioner if the block was\r\nfast, who answered it was. He then said, ‘I wish it might have been a\r\nlittle higher.’ But it was answered him, it could not be otherwise now.\r\nThe king said, ‘When I put out my hands this way, then--.’ He prayed a\r\nfew words standing, with his hands and eyes lift up towards heaven, and\r\nthen stooping down, laid his neck on the block. Soon after which the\r\nexecutioner putting some of his hair under his cap, the king thought he\r\nhad been going to strike, bade him stay for the sign. After a little\r\ntime the king stretched forth his hand, and the executioner took off his\r\nhead at one stroke. When his head was held up, and the people at a\r\ndistance knew the fatal stroke was over, there was nothing to be heard\r\nbut shrieks, and groans, and sobs, the unmerciful soldiers beating down\r\npoor people for this little tender of their affection to their prince.\r\nThus died the worthiest gentleman, the best master, the best friend, the\r\nbest husband, the best father, and the best Christian, that the age in\r\nwhich he lived produced.”[44]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Philip Warwick, an adherent to this unfortunate king, says, “His\r\ndeportment was very majestic; for he would not let fall his dignity, no\r\nnot to the greatest foreigners that came to visit him and his court: for\r\nthough he was far from pride, yet he was careful of majesty, and would\r\nbe approached with respect and reverence. His conversation was free; and\r\nthe subject matter of it, on his own side of the court, was most\r\ncommonly rational; or if facetious, not light. With any artist or good\r\nmechanic, traveller, or scholar, he would discourse freely; and as he\r\nwas commonly improved by them, so he often gave light to them in their\r\nown art or knowledge: for there were few gentlemen in the world that\r\nknew more of useful or necessary learning than this prince did; and yet\r\nhis proportion of books was but small, having, like Francis the First of\r\nFrance, learnt more by the ear than by study. His way of arguing was\r\nvery civil and patient; for he never contradicted another by his\r\nauthority, but by his reason; nor did he by petulant dislike quash\r\nanother’s arguments; and he offered his exception by this civil\r\nintroduction, ‘By your favour, Sir, I think otherwise, on this or that\r\nground;’ yet he would discountenance any bold or forward address unto\r\nhim. And in suits, or discourses of business, he would give way to none\r\nabruptly to enter into them, but looked that the greatest persons should\r\nin affairs of this nature address to him by his proper ministers, or by\r\nsome solemn desire of speaking to him in their own persons. His\r\nexercises were manly, for he rid the great horse very well; and on the\r\nlittle saddle he was not only adroit, but a laborious hunter, or\r\nfield-man. He had a great plainness in his own nature, and yet he was\r\nthought, even by his friends, to love too much a versatile man; but his\r\nexperience had thoroughly weaned him from this at last. He kept up the\r\ndignity of his court, limiting persons to places suitable to their\r\nqualities, unless he particularly called for them. Besides the women who\r\nattended on his beloved queen and consort, the lady Henrietta Maria,\r\nsister of the French king, he scarcely admitted any great officer to\r\nhave his wife in the family. His exercises of religion were most\r\nexemplary; for every morning early, and evening, not very late, singly\r\nand alone, in his own bed-chamber, or closet, he spent some time in\r\nprivate meditation, (for he dared reflect and be alone,) and through the\r\nwhole week, even when he went to hunt, he never failed, before he sat\r\ndown to dinner, to have part of the liturgy read to him and his menial\r\nservants, came he ever so hungry or late in: and on Sundays and Tuesdays\r\nhe came, commonly at the beginning of service, well attended by his\r\ncourt lords and chief attendants, and most usually waited on by many of\r\nthe nobility in town, who found those observances acceptably entertained\r\nby him. His greatest enemies can deny none of this; and a man of this\r\nmoderation of mind could have no hungry appetite to prey upon his\r\nsubjects, though he had a greatness of mind not to live precariously by\r\nthem. But when he fell into the sharpness of his afflictions, (than\r\nwhich few men underwent sharper,) I dare say I know it, (I am sure\r\nconscientiously I say it,) though God dealt with him, as he did with St.\r\nPaul, not remove the thorn, yet he made his grace sufficient to take\r\naway the pungency of it; for he made as sanctified an use of his\r\nafflictions as most men ever did. As an evidence of his natural probity,\r\nwhenever any young nobleman or gentleman of quality who was going to\r\ntravel, came to kiss his hand, he cheerfully would give them some good\r\ncounsel leading to moral virtue, especially a good conversation;\r\ntelling them, that if he heard they kept good company abroad, he should\r\nreasonably expect they would return qualified to serve their king and\r\ncountry well at home; and he was careful to keep the youth in his time\r\nuncorrupted. The king’s deportment at his trial, which began on Saturday\r\nthe 20th of January, 1648, was very majestic and steady; and though\r\nusually his tongue hesitated, yet at this time it was free, for he was\r\nnever discomposed in mind; and yet, as he confessed himself to bishop\r\nJuxon, who attended him, one action shocked him very much; for whilst he\r\nwas leaning in the court upon his staff, which had a head of gold, the\r\nhead broke off on a sudden: he took it up, but seemed unconcerned; yet\r\ntold the bishop, it really made a great impression on him; and to this\r\nhour (says he) I know not possibly how it should come. It was an\r\naccident I myself have often thought on, and cannot imagine how it came\r\nabout; unless Hugh Peters, who was truly and really his gaoler, (for at\r\nSt. James’s nobody went to him but by Peters’s leave,) had artificially\r\ntampered upon his staff. But such conjectures are of no use.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Lansdowne collection of MSS. a singular circumstance before the\r\nbattle of Newbury is thus related:--\r\n\r\n“The king being at Oxford went one day to see the public library, where\r\nhe was shown, among other books, a _Virgil_, nobly printed and\r\nexquisitely bound. The lord Falkland, to divert the king, would have his\r\nmajesty make a trial of his fortune by the _sortes Virgilianæ_, which\r\nevery body knows was not an unusual kind of augury some ages past.\r\nWhereupon the king opening the book, the period which happened to come\r\nup was part of Dido’s imprecation against Æneas, which Mr. Dryden\r\ntranslates thus:--\r\n\r\n    Yet let a race untamed, and haughty foes,\r\n    His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose;\r\n    Oppressed with numbers in th’ unequal field,\r\n    His men discouraged and himself expelled,\r\n    Let him for succour sue from place to place,\r\n    Torn from his subjects and his sons’ embrace,\r\n    First let him see his friends in battle slain,\r\n    And their untimely fate lament in vain;\r\n    And when at length the cruel war shall cease,\r\n    On hard conditions may he buy his peace.\r\n    Nor let him then enjoy supreme command,\r\n    But fall untimely by some hostile hand,\r\n    And lie unburied on the barren sand.\r\n\r\n  _Æneid_, b. iv. l. 88.\r\n\r\n“It is said, king Charles seemed concerned at this accident, and that\r\nthe lord Falkland observing it, would likewise try his own fortune in\r\nthe same manner, hoping he might fall upon some passage that could have\r\nno relation to his case, and thereby divert the king’s thoughts from any\r\nimpression the other might have upon him. But the place that Falkland\r\nstumbled upon was yet more suited to his destiny[45] than the other had\r\nbeen to the king’s; being the following expressions of Evander upon the\r\nuntimely death of his son Pallas, as they are translated by the same\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n    O Pallas! thou hast failed thy plighted word\r\n    To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword:\r\n    I warned thee, but in vain; for well I knew\r\n    What perils youthful ardour would pursue.\r\n    That boiling blood would carry thee too far;\r\n    Young as thou wert in dangers--raw in war!\r\n    O curst essay in arms,--disastrous doom,--\r\n    Prelude of bloody fields and fights to come.\r\n\r\n  _Æneid_, b. xi. l. 230.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarkable 30th of January Sermon._\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1755, the rev. John Watson, curate of Ripponden,\r\nin Yorkshire, preached a sermon there which he afterwards published. The\r\ntitle-page states it as “proving that king Charles I. did not govern\r\nlike a good king of England.” He also printed “An Apology for his\r\nConduct yearly on the 30th of January.” In these tracts he says, “For\r\nsome years last past I have preached on the 30th of January, and my\r\nlabours were employed in obviating the mistakes which I knew some of my\r\ncongregation entertained with regard to the character of king Charles\r\nI.; and in proving that if it was judged rebellion in those who took up\r\narms against that unfortunate prince, who had made so many breaches in\r\nthe constitution, it must be an aggravation of that crime, to oppose the\r\njust and wise measures of the present father of his country, king\r\nGeorge. The chief reason for publishing the sermon is to confute a\r\ncommonly received opinion that I applauded therein the act of cutting\r\noff the king’s head, which any one may quickly see to be without\r\nfoundation. For when I say that the resistance he met with was owing to\r\nhis own mal-administration, nothing else can be meant than the\r\nopposition he received from a wise, brave, and good parliament:--not\r\nthat shown him by those furious men who destroyed both the parliament\r\nand him, and whose conduct I never undertook to vindicate. It has been\r\nobserved that I always provide a clergyman to read prayers for me on the\r\n30th of January; but not to read that service is deemed criminal,\r\nbecause in subscribing the 36th canon I obliged myself to use the form\r\nprescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. The office for the 30th of\r\nJanuary is no part of the _Liturgy_ of the church of England. By the\r\nliturgy of the church I mean the contents of _The Book of Common Prayer\r\nand Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of\r\nthe Church_, &c., established by the act of uniformity, in the year\r\n1662; and whatever has been added since, I suppose no clergyman ever\r\nbound himself by subscription to use; the reason is because the law\r\nrequires no more.”\r\n\r\nMr. Watson then says, on the authority of Wheatly, in his “Illustration\r\nof the Common Prayer,” Johnson in his “Clergyman’s Vade Mecum,” and the\r\nauthor of “The Complete Incumbent,” that the services for the 30th of\r\nJanuary and the 29th of May are not confirmed by act of parliament, and\r\nthat penalties do not attach for the non-celebration of the service on\r\nthose days. “I cannot in conscience read those prayers,” says Watson,\r\n“wherein the king is called a _Martyr_. I believe the assertion to be\r\nfalse, and therefore why should I tell a lie before the God of Truth!\r\nWhat is a martyr? He is a witness, for so the word in the original\r\nimparts. Robert Stephens tells us, that they are martyrs who have died\r\ngiving a testimony of divinity to Christ, but if this be true king\r\nCharles can be no martyr, for he was put to death by those who believed\r\nin the divinity of Christ as well as he. What were the grounds then for\r\ngiving him this glorious title? his dying rather than give up\r\nepiscopacy? I think lord Clarendon hath proved the contrary: he\r\nconsented to suspend episcopacy for three years, and that money should\r\nbe raised upon the sale of the church lands, and only the old rent\r\nshould be reserved to the just owners and their successors. My charity\r\nleads me so far, that I hope king Charles meant well when he told the\r\nprincess Elizabeth that he should _die a martyr_, and when he repeated\r\nit on the scaffold. But this might be nothing else but a pleasing\r\ndeception of the mind; and if saying that _he died a martyr_ made him\r\nsuch, then the duke of Monmouth also was the same, for he died with the\r\nsame words in his mouth, which his grandfather, king Charles, had used\r\nbefore. King Charles II. seems to have had no such opinion of the\r\nmatter; for when a certain lord reminded his majesty of his swearing in\r\ncommon discourse, the king replied, ‘_Your martyr swore more than ever I\r\ndid_,’ which many have deemed a jest upon the title which his father had\r\ngot. In fact, we, of this generation, should never have judged, that he\r\nwho swore to preserve the religion, laws, and liberties of his country\r\ninviolate, and yet broke through every one of these restraints--that he,\r\nwho put an English fleet into the hands of the French to crush the\r\nprotestants there, who were struggling to maintain their religion and\r\nliberties--that he, who contrary to the most solemn promises, did\r\nsacrifice the protestant interest in France--that he, who concurred with\r\nLaud in bringing the church of England to a kind of rivalship, for\r\nornaments, &c., with the church of Rome--that he, who could consent,\r\nwhen he married the French king’s daughter, that their children were to\r\nbe educated by their mother until thirteen years of age--that he, who\r\ngave great church preferments to men who publicly preached up popish\r\ndoctrines; and that protected known papists from the penalties of the\r\nlaw, by taking several very extraordinary steps in their behalf--that\r\nhe, who permitted an agent, or a kind of nuncio from Rome, to visit the\r\ncourt publicly, and bestowed such offices as those of lord high\r\ntreasurer, secretary of state, chancellor of the exchequer, &c., on\r\npapists--that he, who by proclamation could command the Lord’s day to be\r\nprofaned (for I can call it no less) by revels, plays, and many sorts of\r\nill-timed recreations, punishing great numbers of pious clergymen for\r\nrefusing to publish what their consciences forbad them to read: and to\r\nname no more--that he, who could abet the Irish massacre, wherein above\r\nthree hundred thousand protestants were murdered in cold blood, or\r\nexpelled out of their habitations. (_Vide_ Temple’s ‘Irish Rebellion,’\r\npage 6) I say, we, at this period of time, should not have thought such\r\na one worthy to be deemed a martyr for the cause of protestantism; but\r\nthat it has been a custom in the church for near a century to call him\r\nso. However, it is time seriously to consider whether it is not proper\r\nto correct this error; at least, it should be shown to be no error if we\r\nmust keep it, for, at present, many of the well-meaning members of the\r\nchurch are offended at it.”\r\n\r\nThe writer cited, goes on to observe, “My second objection against\r\nreading this service is, that I judge it to be contrary both to reason\r\nand the contents of the Bible, to say that ‘the blood of king Charles\r\ncan be required of us or our posterity.’ There is not, I suppose, one\r\nman alive who consented to the king’s death. We know nothing of it but\r\nfrom history, therefore none of us were concerned in the fact; with what\r\nreason then can it be averred that we ought to be responsible for it,\r\nwhen it neither was nor is in our power to prevent it. But what if we\r\ndisclaim the sins of our forefathers, or are the posterity of those who\r\nfought for the king, are we still to be in danger of suffering? Such\r\nseems to be the doctrine of this service, where all, without exception,\r\nare called upon to pray that they ‘may be freed from the vengeance of\r\nhis righteous blood.’ I could prove, from undoubted records, that the\r\nfamily I came from were royalists; but I think it sufficient to say,\r\nthat I never did nor ever will consent, that a king shall be beheaded,\r\nor otherwise put to death; therefore let others say what they will, I\r\nlook upon myself to be innocent, and why should I plead with God as if I\r\nthought myself guilty? But we are told that they ‘were the crying sins\r\nof this nation which brought down this heavy judgment upon us.’ I think\r\nit is more clear, that a series of ill-judged and ill-timed acts, on the\r\npart of the king, brought him into the power of his opposers, and that,\r\nafterwards, the ambition of a few men led him to the scaffold. Let it\r\nonly be remembered, that at the beginning of his reign he entered into a\r\nwar for the recovery of the Palatinate against the consent of his\r\nparliament; and when he could not get them to vote him money enough for\r\nhis purpose he extorted it illegally from his subjects; refusing to\r\njoin the parliament in redressing the grievances of the nation; often\r\nthreatening them; and even counteracting their designs; which, at last,\r\nbred so many disputes, that he overstepped all bounds, and had the\r\nmisprudence to attempt the seizing of five members in the house; on\r\nwhich the citizens came down by land and water, with muskets on their\r\nshoulders, to defend the parliament: soon after which so great a\r\ndistrust arose between the two houses and him, that all likelihood of\r\nagreement wholly ceased. This was the cause whereon to make war--sending\r\nthe queen to Holland to buy arms, himself retiring from the capital, and\r\nsoon after erecting his standard at Nottingham. Not succeeding, he was\r\nmade prisoner, and when many expected his restoration, a violent\r\nopposition in the army broke forth; a design was formed to change the\r\nmonarchy into a republic, and to this, and nothing else, he fell a\r\nsacrifice. If the real cause of the king’s death was the wickedness of\r\nthose times, does it not follow that his death was permitted by God as a\r\npunishment for that wickedness; and if so, why should we fear that God\r\nwill still visit for it? Will the just and merciful Judge discharge his\r\nvengeance on two different generations of men for the offences committed\r\nby one? Such doctrine as this should be banished from every church,\r\nespecially a christian one; for it has no foundation in reason or\r\nrevelation.” The reasons of this clergyman of the established church for\r\nhis dissent from the established usage are still further remarkable.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson states other objections to this service. “In the hymn used\r\ninstead of _Venite exultemus_, it is said, _They fought against him\r\nwithout a cause_: the contrary of which, when it is applied to king\r\nCharles, I think has been owned by every historian. The parliament of\r\nEngland were always more wise and good, than to raise armies against the\r\nkings who gave them no occasion to do so; and I cannot but entertain\r\nthis favourable opinion of that which began to sit in the year 1640.\r\nThere is nothing more true than that the king wanted to govern by an\r\narbitrary power. His whole actions showed it, and he could never be\r\nbrought to depart from this. Either, therefore, his people must have\r\nsubmitted to the slavery, or they must have vindicated their freedom\r\nopenly; there was no middle way. But should they have tamely received\r\nthe yoke? No, surely; for had they done so, they had deserved the worst\r\nof evils; and the bitter effects thereof, in all probability, had not\r\nonly been derived to _us_, but our _posterity_. Happy Britons, that such\r\na just and noble stand was made! May the memories of those great\r\npatriots that were concerned in it be ever dear to Englishmen; and to\r\nall true Englishmen they will!\r\n\r\n“In the same hymn it is likewise affirmed that _False witnesses rose up\r\nagainst him, and laid to his charge things that he knew not_. Which on\r\nthis occasion cannot be truly said, because as the chief fact to be\r\nproved was the king’s being in arms, it cannot be supposed that out of\r\nmore than 200,000 men who had engaged with him, a sufficient number of\r\ntrue witnesses could be wanting. What, therefore, Mr. Wheatly could\r\nthink when he said that his hymn is as solemn a composure, and as\r\npertinent to the occasion as can be imagined or contrived, I cannot\r\ntell. I am sure a broad hint is given therein, that the clergy in king\r\nCharles’s time were a set of wicked people, and that it was through\r\ntheir unrighteousness, as well as that of the laity, that the king lost\r\nhis life. The words are these, ‘For the sins of the people, and the\r\niniquities of the priests, they shed the blood of the just in the midst\r\nof Jerusalem.’ Let those defend this passage who are able, for I own\r\nmyself incapable of doing it consistently.”\r\n\r\nMr. Watson says, “I am not by myself in thinking that this service for\r\nthe 30th of January needs a review; many sensible, worthy men think\r\nfurther--that it is time to drop it; for they see that it is\r\nunseasonable now, and serves no other end than as a bone of contention\r\nin numberless parishes, preventing friendship, and good will being shown\r\ntowards such of the clergy as cannot in all points approve of it;\r\nexcepting that (as I have found by experience) it tends to make bad\r\nsubjects. A sufficient argument this, was there no other, why it should\r\neither be altered, or taken away; but I presume not to dictate; and,\r\ntherefore, I urge this no further: had I not a sincere regard for the\r\nchurch of England, I should have said less; but notwithstanding any\r\nreports to the contrary, I declare myself to be a hearty well-wisher to\r\nher prosperity. Did I not prefer her communion to that of any other, I\r\nwould instantly leave her, for I am not so abandoned as to play the\r\nhypocrite that I detest, and have often detested it to my great loss.\r\nBut I am not of that opinion, that it is for the interest of the church\r\nto conceal her defects; on the contrary, I think I do her the greatest\r\nservice possible by pointing them out, so that they may be remedied to\r\nthe satisfaction of all good men. She ought not to be ashamed of the\r\ntruth, and falsehood will never hurt her.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appears that Mr. Watson’s conduct obtained much notice; for he\r\npreached another sermon at Halifax, entitled “Moderation; or a candid\r\ndisposition towards those that differ from us, recommended and\r\nenforced.” This he also printed, with the avowed view of “promoting of\r\nthat moderation towards all men which becometh us as Christians, is the\r\nornament of our profession, and which we should therefore labour to\r\nmaintain, as we desire to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are\r\ncalled, with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing\r\none another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the\r\nbond of peace.” He proceeds to observe in this discourse, that “whoever\r\nreflects upon the nature of human constitutions, will readily allow the\r\nimpossibility of perfection in any of them; and whoever considers the\r\nmutability of human things, will grant that nothing can be so well\r\ndevised, or so sure established, which, in continuance of time, will not\r\nbe corrupted. A change of circumstances, to which the best constituted\r\nstate is liable, will require such alterations as once would have been\r\nneedless: and improvement of observation will demand such regulations as\r\nnothing else could have discovered to have been right. Of this the wise\r\nfounders of the established church of England were very sensible; they\r\nprudently required no subscription to perfection in the church, well\r\nknowing that they but laid the foundation stone of a much greater\r\nbuilding than they could live to see completed. The Common Prayer, since\r\nit was first properly compiled, in the year 1545, has undergone sixteen\r\nalterations, as defects became visible, and offence was thereby given to\r\nthe promoting of separations and divisions: noble examples these--fit\r\nfor the present age to imitate! for, as ninety years have elapsed since\r\nthe last review, this experienced age has justly discovered that the\r\namendments, at that time made, were not sufficient. I could produce you\r\nmany instances; but I forbear; for I am very sensible how tender a\r\npoint I am discussing. However, I cannot but observe, that for my own\r\npart, upon the maturest and most sober consideration, I take him to be a\r\ngreater friend to Christianity in general, and to this church in\r\nparticular, who studies to unite as many dissenters as may be to us, by\r\na reasonable comprehension, than he who is against it.”\r\n\r\nIt is urged by Mr. Watson, that the church of England herself does not\r\nclaim a perfection which is insisted upon as her distinguishing quality\r\nby some of her over zealous advocates. He says, “The first reformers\r\nwere wise and good men, but the Common Prayer they published was little\r\nbetter than popery itself; many indeed have been the alterations in it\r\nmade since then; but as, through the unripeness of the times, it never\r\nhad any but imperfect emendations, we may reasonably suppose it capable\r\nof still further improvements.” Deeming the service appointed for this\r\nday as inappropriate, and referring to suggestions that were in his time\r\nurged upon public attention for a review of the liturgy, he proceeds to\r\nsay, “There may be men at work that misrepresent this good design; that\r\nproclaim, as formerly, the church’s danger; but let no arts like these\r\ndeceive you; they must be enemies in disguise that do it, or such who\r\nhave not examined what they object to with sufficient accuracy. What is\r\nwished for, your own great Tillotson himself attempted: this truly\r\nvaluable man, with some others but little inferior to himself, being\r\nsensible that the want of a sufficient review drew many members from the\r\nchurch, would have compromised the difference in a way detrimental to no\r\none, beneficial to all; and had he not been opposed by some revengeful\r\nzealots, had certainly completed what all good men have wished for.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the _Every-Day Book_ has Mr. Watson’s private copies of\r\nthese printed tracts, with _manuscript_ additions and remarks on them by\r\nMr. Watson himself. It should seem from one of these notes, in his own\r\nhand-writing, that his opinions were not wholly contemned. Regarding his\r\nlatter discourse, he observes that “the late Dr. Sharp, archdeacon of\r\nNorthumberland, in a pamphlet, called ‘A Serious Inquiry into the Use\r\nand Importance of External Religion;’ quotes this sentence, “_Where\r\nunity and peace are disregarded, devotion must be so too, as it were by\r\nnatural consequences_. I have borrowed these words from a sermon\r\npreached at Halifax, by John Watson, A. M., which, if any man, who has\r\nsixpence to spare, will purchase, peruse, and lay to heart, he will lay\r\nout his time and his money very well.” Archdeacon Sharp was father of\r\nthe late Granville Sharp, the distinguished philanthropist and hebraist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Watson was born at Presburg, in Cheshire, and educated at Brazen\r\nNose college, Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship. He wrote a History\r\nof Halifax, in 2 vols. 4to., 1775; and a History of the Warren Family,\r\nby one of whom he was presented to the rectory of Stockport, where he\r\ndied, aged 59 years. He also wrote a review of the large Moravian hymn\r\nbook, and several miscellaneous pieces. There is a portrait of him by\r\nBasire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy those who believe that Charles was “guiltless of his country’s\r\nblood,” and that the guilt “of his blood” is an entail upon the country\r\nnot yet cut off, it may be remarked as a curious fact, that at about\r\nthat season, eighty years after the king “bowed his head” on the\r\nscaffold at Whitehall, it was “a very sickly time.” It is recorded, that\r\nin 1733 “people were afflicted this month with a _head-ach_ and fever\r\nwhich very few escaped, and many died of; particularly between Tuesday,\r\nthe twenty-third, and Tuesday, the _thirtieth_ of January, there died\r\nupwards of fifteen hundred in London and Westminster.”[46] On the\r\ntwenty-third of January, 1649, the king having peremptorily denied the\r\njurisdiction of the court, the president, Bradshaw, “ordered his\r\ncontempt to be recorded: on the thirtieth of January he was beheaded.”\r\nDuring these days, and the intervening ones, the fatal London head-ach\r\nprevailed in 1733.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the second of March, 1772 Mr. Montague moved in the house of commons\r\nto have so much of the act of 12th C. II. c. 30, as relates to the\r\nordering the thirtieth of January to be kept as a day of fasting and\r\nhumiliation, to be repealed. His motive he declared to be, to abolish,\r\nas much as he could, any absurdity from church as well as state. He said\r\nthat he saw great and solid reasons for abolishing the observation of\r\nthat day, and hoped that it was not too harsh a name to be given to the\r\nservice for the observation of that day, if he should brand it with the\r\nname of impiety, particularly in those parts where Charles I. is likened\r\nto our Saviour. On a division, there being for the motion 97, and\r\nagainst it 125, it was lost by a majority of 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Calves-head Club._\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1735, certain young noblemen and gentlemen met\r\nat a French tavern in Suffolk-street, (Charing Cross,) under the\r\ndenomination of the “Calves-head Club.” They had an entertainment of\r\ncalves’ heads, some of which they showed to the mob outside, whom they\r\ntreated with strong beer. In the evening, they caused a bonfire to be\r\nmade before the door, and threw into it with loud huzzas a calf’s-head\r\ndressed up in a napkin. They also dipped their napkins in red wine, and\r\nwaved them from the windows, at the same time drinking toasts publicly.\r\nThe mob huzzaed as well as “their betters,”--but at length broke the\r\nwindows, and became so mischievous that the guards were called in to\r\nprevent further outrage.[47]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings occasioned some verses in the “Grub-street Journal,”\r\nwherein are the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Strange times! when noble peers secure from riot\r\n    Cann’t keep _Noll’s_ annual festival in quiet.\r\n    Through sashes broke, dirt, stones and brands thrown at em,\r\n    Which, if not _scand_ was _brand-alum-magnatum_--\r\n    Forced to run down to vaults for safer quarters,\r\n    And in cole-holes, their ribbons hide and garters.\r\n    They thought, their feast in dismal fray thus ending,\r\n    Themselves to shades of death and hell descending:\r\n    This might have been, had stout Clare-market mobsters\r\n    With cleavers arm’d, outmarch’d St. James’s lobsters;\r\n    Numsculls they’d split, to furnish other revels,\r\n    And make a _calves-head feast_ for worms and devils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Calves-head Club in Suffolk Street, 1734.~]\r\n\r\nThere is a print entitled “The true Effigies of the Members of the\r\nCalves-head Club, held on the 30th of January, 1734, in Suffolk Street,\r\nin the County of Middlesex.” This date is the year before that of the\r\ndisturbance related, and as regards the company, the health drinking,\r\nhuzzaing, a calf’s head in a napkin, a bonfire, and the mob, the scene\r\nis the same; with this addition, that there is a person in a mask with\r\nan axe in his hand. The engraving above is from this print.\r\n\r\nOn a work entitled the “History of the Calves-head Club,” little\r\nreliance is to be placed for authenticity. It appears, however, that\r\ntheir toasts were of this description: “The pious memory of Oliver\r\nCromwell.” “Damn----n to the race of the Stuarts.” “The glorious year\r\n1648.” “The man in the mask, &c.” It will be remembered that the\r\nexecutioner of Charles I. wore a mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oranges and Bells._\r\n\r\nA literary hand at Newark is so obliging as to send the communication\r\nannexed, for which, in behalf of the reader, the editor offers his\r\nsincere thanks.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  _Newark, Dec. 10, 1825._\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, the anniversary of king Charles’s martyrdom, and\r\non Shrove Tuesday, we have a custom here, which I believe to be\r\nsingular, having never heard of it elsewhere. On those days, there are\r\nseveral stalls placed in the market-place, (as if for a regular market,)\r\nhaving nothing but oranges: you may purchase them, but it is rarely the\r\ncase; but you “raffle” for them, at least that is their expression. You\r\ngive the owner a halfpenny, which entitles you to one share; if a penny,\r\nto two, and so on; and when there is a sufficient sum, you begin the\r\nraffle. A ball nearly round, (about the size of a hen’s egg,) yet having\r\ntwenty-six square sides, each having a number, being one to twenty-six,\r\nis given you: (some balls may not have so many, others more, but I never\r\nsaw them.) You throw the ball down, what I may term, the chimney, (which\r\nis so made as to keep turning the ball as it descends,) and it falls on\r\na flat board with a ledge, to keep it from falling off, and when it\r\nstops you look at the number. Suppose it was twelve, the owner of the\r\nstall uses this expression, “Twelve is the highest, and one gone.” Then\r\nanother throws; if his is a lesser number, they say, “Twelve is the\r\nhighest, and two gone;” if a higher number, they call accordingly. The\r\nhighest number takes oranges to the amount of all the money on the\r\nboard. When they first begin, a halfpenny is put down, then they call\r\n“One, and who makes two?” when another is put down, it is “Two, and who\r\nmakes three?” and so on. At night the practice is kept up at their own\r\nhouses till late hours; and others go to the inns and public-houses to\r\nsee what they can do there.\r\n\r\nAlso every day, at six in the morning, and night, at eight o’clock, we\r\nhave a bell rung for about a quarter of an hour: it is termed six\r\no’clock and eight o’clock bell. On saint days, Saturdays, and Sundays,\r\nthe time is altered to seven o’clock in the morning, and to seven\r\no’clock at night, with an additional ringing at one o’clock at noon.\r\nAgain, at eight o’clock on Sunday morning, all the bells are tolled\r\nround for a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the above, that, if they come within the notice of the\r\n_Every-Day Book_, you would give them insertion, and, if possible,\r\naccount for their origin.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of “bells,” perhaps you can mention how “hand\r\nbells came into the church, and for what purpose.” We have a set in this\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  H.

It\r\nprevails, likewise, in Northumberland, and other northern parts of south\r\nBritain; yet, nowhere, perhaps, is it so federalized as among the\r\ndescendants of those who “ha’ wi’ Wallace bled.” This sport, called\r\n_curling_, is described by the georgical poet, and will be better\r\napprehended by being related in his numbers: it being premised that the\r\ntime agreed on, or the appointment for playing it, is called the\r\n_tryst_; the match is called the _bonspiel_; the boundary marks for the\r\nplay are called the _tees_; and the stones used are called _coits_, or\r\n_quoits_, or _coiting_, or _quoiting-stones_.\r\n\r\n      Now rival parishes, and shrievedoms, keep,\r\n    On upland lochs, the long-expected tryst\r\n    To play their yearly bonspiel. Aged men,\r\n    Smit with the eagerness of youth, are there,\r\n    While love of conquest lights their beamless eyes,\r\n    New-nerves their arms, and makes them young once more.\r\n\r\n      The sides when ranged, the distance meted out,\r\n    And duly traced the tees, some younger hand\r\n    Begins, with throbbing heart, and far o’ershoots,\r\n    Or sideward leaves, the mark: in vain he bends\r\n    His waist, and winds his hand, as if it still\r\n    Retained the power to guide the devious stone,\r\n    Which, onward hurling, makes the circling groupe\r\n    Quick start aside, to shun its reckless force.\r\n    But more and still more skilful arms succeed,\r\n    And near and nearer still around the tee,\r\n    This side, now that, approaches; till at last,\r\n    Two, seeming equidistant, straws, or twigs,\r\n    Decide as umpires ’tween contending coits.\r\n\r\n      Keen, keener still, as life itself were staked,\r\n    Kindles the friendly strife: one points the line\r\n    To him who, poising, aims and aims again;\r\n    Another runs and sweeps where nothing lies.\r\n    Success alternately, from side to side,\r\n    Changes; and quick the hours un-noted fly,\r\n    Till light begins to fail, and deep below,\r\n    The player, as he stoops to lift his coit,\r\n    Sees, half incredulous, the rising moon.\r\n    But now the final, the decisive spell\r\n    Begins; near and more near the sounding stones,\r\n    Some winding in, some bearing straight along,\r\n    Crowd justling all around the mark, while one,\r\n    Just slightly touching, victory depends\r\n    Upon the final aim: long swings the stone.\r\n    Then with full force, careering furious on,\r\n    Rattling it strikes aside both friend and foe,\r\n    Maintains its course, and takes the victor’s place.\r\n    The social meal succeeds, and social glass;\r\n    In words the fight renewed is fought again,\r\n    While festive mirth forgets the winged hours.--\r\n    Some quit betimes the scene, and find that home\r\n    Is still the place where genuine pleasure dwells.\r\n\r\n  _Grahame._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 36·85.\r\n\r\n  [44] Clarendon.\r\n\r\n  [45] Lord Falkland engaged in a thoughtless skirmish and perished in\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  [46] British Chronologist, 177.\r\n\r\n  [47] Gents.

A great adept at the\r\nbusiness, who had been the prime manager at all the wakes in the\r\nneighbourhood for many years, was at last called away from the\r\ndeath-beds of his friends to his own. Shortly before he died he gave\r\nminute directions to his people as to the mode of waking him in proper\r\nstyle. “Recollect,” says he, “to put three candles at the head of the\r\nbed, after you lay me out, and two at the foot, and one at each side.\r\nMind now, and put a plate with the salt on it just a top of my breast.\r\nAnd, do you hear? have plenty of tobacco and pipes enough; and remember\r\nto make the punch strong.

The judges, according to an\r\nancient custom, danced “round the coal fire,” singing an old French\r\nsong.[51]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COAL AND THE DIAMOND\r\n\r\n_A Fable for Cold Weather._\r\n\r\n    A coal was hid beneath the grate,\r\n    (’Tis often modest merit’s fate,)\r\n      ’Twas small, and so, perhaps, forgotten;\r\n    Whilst in the room, and near in size,\r\n      In a fine casket lined with cotton,\r\n    In pomp and state, a diamond lies.\r\n      “So, little gentleman in black,”\r\n    The brilliant spark in anger cried,\r\n      “I hear, in philosophic clack,\r\n    Our families are close allied;\r\n      But know, the splendour of my hue,\r\n    Excell’d by nothing in existence,\r\n      Should teach such little folks as you\r\n    To keep a more respectful distance.”\r\n\r\n    At these reflections on his name,\r\n    The coal soon redden’d to a flame;\r\n    Of his own real use aware,\r\n    He only answer’d with a sneer--\r\n    “I scorn your taunts, good bishop _Blaze_,\r\n      And envy not your charms divine;\r\n    For know, I boast a double praise,\r\n      As I can _warm_ as well as shine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Elizabeth Woodcock.~]\r\n\r\n    She was in prison, as you see,\r\n      All in a cave of snow;\r\n    And she could not relieved be,\r\n      Though she was frozen so.\r\n                      Ah, well a-day!\r\n\r\n    For she was all froze in with frost,\r\n      Eight days and nights, poor soul!\r\n    But when they gave her up for lost,\r\n      They found her down the hole.\r\n                      Ah, well-a-day!\r\n\r\n  _MS. Ballad._\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 2d of February, 1799, Elizabeth Woodcock, aged\r\nforty-two years, went on horseback from Impington to Cambridge; on her\r\nreturn, between six and seven o’clock in the evening, being about half a\r\nmile from her own home, her horse started at a sudden light, probably\r\nfrom a meteor, which, at this season of the year, frequently happens.\r\nShe exclaimed, “Good God! what can this be?” It was a very inclement,\r\nstormy night; a bleak wind blew boisterously from the N. E.; the ground\r\nwas covered by great quantities of snow that had fallen during the day.\r\nMany of the deepest ditches were filled up, whilst in the open fields\r\nthere was but a thin covering; but in roads and lanes, and in narrow and\r\nenclosed parts, it had so accumulated as to retard the traveller. The\r\nhorse ran backwards to the brink of a ditch, and fearing lest the animal\r\nshould plunge into it, she dismounted, intending to lead the animal\r\nhome; but he started again, and broke from her. She attempted to regain\r\nthe bridle; but the horse turned suddenly out of the road, over a common\r\nfield, and she followed him. Having lost one of her shoes in the snow,\r\nand wearied by the exertion she had made, and by a heavy basket on her\r\narm, her pursuit of the horse was greatly impeded; she however\r\npersisted, and having overtaken him about a quarter of a mile from\r\nwhence she alighted, she gained the bridle, and made another attempt to\r\nlead him home. But on retracing her steps to a thicket contiguous to the\r\nroad, she became so much fatigued, and her left foot, which was without\r\na shoe, was so much benumbed, that she was unable to proceed farther.\r\nSitting down upon the ground in this state, and letting go the bridle,\r\n“Tinker,” she said, calling the horse by his name, “I am too much tired\r\nto go any farther; you must go home without me:” and exclaimed, “Lord\r\nhave mercy upon me! what will become of me?” The ground on which she sat\r\nwas upon a level with the common field, close under the thicket on the\r\nsouth-west. She well knew its situation, and its distance from her own\r\nhouse. There was then only a small quantity of snow drifted near her;\r\nbut it accumulated so rapidly, that when Chesterton bell rang at eight\r\no’clock, she was completely hemmed in by it. The depth of the snow in\r\nwhich she was enveloped was about six feet in a perpendicular direction,\r\nand over her head between two and three. She was incapable of any\r\neffectual attempt to extricate herself, and, in addition to her fatigue\r\nand cold, her clothes were stiffened by the frost; and therefore,\r\nresigning herself to the necessity of her situation, she sat awaiting\r\nthe dawn of the following day. To the best of her recollection, she\r\nslept very little during the night. In the morning, observing before her\r\na circular hole in the snow, about two feet in length, and half a foot\r\nin diameter, running obliquely upwards, she broke off a branch of a bush\r\nwhich was close to her, and with it thrust her handkerchief through the\r\nhole, and hung it, as a signal of distress, upon one of the uppermost\r\ntwigs that remained uncovered. She bethought herself that the change of\r\nthe moon was near, and having an almanac in her pocket, took it out,\r\nthough with great difficulty, and found that there would be a new moon\r\nthe next day, February the 4th. Her difficulty in getting the almanac\r\nfrom her pocket arose, in a great measure, from the stiffness of her\r\nfrozen clothes; the trouble, however, was compensated by the consolation\r\nwhich the prospect of so near a change in her favour afforded. Here,\r\nhowever, she remained day after day, and night after night, perfectly\r\ndistinguishing the alterations of day and night, hearing the bells of\r\nher own and the neighbouring villages, particularly that of Chesterton,\r\nwhich was about two miles distant from the spot, and rung in winter time\r\nat eight in the evening and four in the morning, Sundays excepted; she\r\nwas sensible to the sound of carriages upon the road, the bleating of\r\nsheep and lambs, and the barking of dogs. One day she overheard a\r\nconversation between two gipsies, relative to an ass they had lost. She\r\nrecollected having pulled out her snuff-box, and taken two pinches of\r\nsnuff, but felt so little gratification from it, that she never repeated\r\nit. Possibly, the cold might have so far blunted her powers of\r\nsensation, that the snuff no longer retained its stimulus. Finding her\r\nleft hand beginning to swell, in consequence of her reclining on that\r\narm, she took two rings, the tokens of her nuptial vows twice pledged,\r\nfrom her finger, and put them, together with a little money from her\r\npocket, into a small box, judging that, should she not be found alive,\r\nthe rings and money, being thus deposited, were less likely to be\r\noverlooked by the discoverers of her breathless corpse. She frequently\r\nshouted, in hopes that her vociferations might reach any that chanced to\r\npass, but the snow prevented the transmission of her voice. The gipsies,\r\nwho approached her nearer than any other persons, were not sensible of\r\nany sound, though she particularly endeavoured to attract their\r\nattention. A thaw took place on the Friday after the commencement of her\r\nmisfortunes; she felt uncommonly faint and languid; her clothes were\r\nwetted quite through by the melted snow; the aperture before mentioned\r\nbecame considerably enlarged, and she attempted to make an effort to\r\nrelease herself; but her strength was too much impaired; her feet and\r\nlegs were no longer obedient to her will, and her clothes were become\r\nmuch heavier by the water which they had imbibed. She now, for the first\r\ntime, began to despair of being discovered alive; and declared, that,\r\nall things considered, she could not have survived twenty-four hours\r\nlonger. This was the morning of her emancipation. The apartment or cave\r\nof snow formed around her was sufficiently large to afford her space to\r\nmove herself about three or four inches in any direction, but not to\r\nstand upright, it being only about three feet and a half in height, and\r\nabout two in the broadest part. Her sufferings had now increased; she\r\nsat with one of her hands spread over her face, and fetched very deep\r\nsighs; her breath was short and difficult, and symptoms of approaching\r\ndissolution became hourly more apparent. On that day, Sunday, the 10th\r\nof February, Joseph Muncey, a young farmer, in his way home from\r\nCambridge, about half-past twelve o’clock, passed very near the spot\r\nwhere the woman was. Her handkerchief, hanging upon the twigs, where she\r\nhad suspended it, caught his eye; he walked up to the place, and saw the\r\nopening in the snow, and heard a sound issue from it similar to that of\r\na person breathing hard and with difficulty. He looked in, and saw the\r\nwoman who had been so long missing. He did not speak to her, but,\r\nseeing another young farmer and a shepherd at a little distance,\r\ncommunicated to them the discovery he had made; upon which, though they\r\nscarcely credited his report, they went to the spot. The shepherd called\r\nout, “Are you there, Elizabeth Woodcock?” She replied, in a faint and\r\nfeeble accent, “Dear John Stittle, I know your voice; for God’s sake,\r\nhelp me out of this place!” Stittle immediately made his way through the\r\nsnow till he was able to reach her; she eagerly grasped his hand, and\r\nimplored him not to leave her. “I have been here a long time,” she\r\nobserved. “Yes,” answered the man, “ever since Saturday.”--“Ay, Saturday\r\nweek,” she replied; “I have heard the bells go two Sundays for church.”\r\nHer husband was immediately acquainted with the discovery, and proper\r\nmeans were taken for conveying her home. Her husband and some neighbours\r\nbrought a horse and chaise-cart, with blankets to wrap her in. The snow\r\nbeing somewhat cleared away, she asked for a piece of biscuit and a\r\nsmall quantity of brandy, from taking which she found herself greatly\r\nrecruited. As a person took her up to put her into the chaise, the\r\nstocking of the left leg, adhering to the ground, came off, and she\r\nfainted. Nature was greatly exhausted, and the motion, added to the\r\nsight of her husband and neighbours, was too much for her strength and\r\nspirits. When she recovered, she was laid gently in the carriage,\r\ncovered well over with the blankets, and conveyed without delay to her\r\nown house.\r\n\r\nIt appears that when the horse came home, her husband and another person\r\nset out on the road with a lantern, and went quite to Cambridge, where\r\nthey only learnt that she left the inn at six that evening. They\r\nexplored the road afresh that night, and for four succeeding days, and\r\nsearched the huts of the gipsies, whom they suspected might have robbed\r\nand murdered her, till she was unexpectedly discovered in the manner\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Okes, a surgeon, first saw her in the cart, as she was removing\r\nhome. She spoke to him with a voice tolerably strong, but rather hoarse;\r\nher hands and arms were sodden, but not very cold though her legs and\r\nfeet were. She was put to bed, and weak broth given her occasionally.\r\nFrom the time of her being lost she had eaten only snow, and believed\r\nshe had not slept till Friday the 8th. The hurry of spirits, occasioned\r\nby too many visitors, rendered her feverish; and her feet were found to\r\nbe completely mortified. The cold had extended its violent effects from\r\nthe end of the toes to the middle of the instep, including more than an\r\ninch above the heels, and all the bottom of the feet, insomuch, that she\r\nlost all her toes with the integuments from the bottom of one foot. Her\r\nlife was saved, but the mutilated state in which she was left, without\r\neven a chance of ever being able to attend to the duties of her family,\r\nwas almost worse than death itself. She lingered until the 13th of July,\r\n1799, when she expired, after a lapse of five months from the period of\r\nher discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·37.\r\n\r\n  [51] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 3.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Blaise._ _St. Agatha._\r\n\r\nThese two Romish festivals are still retained in the church of England\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\nOf St. Blaise’s festival there is an account in vol. i. p. 207.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for instruction is powerfully exemplified by the following\r\nnarrative. Some who reflect upon it, and discover that there are other\r\nand worse consequences to be apprehended from ignorance than those\r\nrelated below, will consult their own safety, by providing education for\r\nthe children of labouring people, and influencing their attendance where\r\nthey may gain the means of distinguishing right from wrong.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1808, at Great Paxton, in Huntingdonshire, Alice Brown,\r\ncrossing the ice on the river Ouse, fell into the water, and narrowly\r\nescaped drowning, in the sight of her friend, Fanny Amey, a poor\r\nepileptic girl, who, in great terror, witnessed the accident. Alice\r\narrived at her father’s house shivering with cold, and, probably from\r\nsympathetic affection, was herself seized with epilepsy. The fits\r\nreturning frequently, she became emaciated, and incapable of labour. In\r\nApril following, the rev. Isaac Nicholson, curate of the parish,\r\ninquiring after her health, was astonished by her brother informing him\r\nthat her fits and debility were the effect of witchcraft. “She is under\r\nan evil tongue,” said the youth. “As sure as you are alive, sir,”\r\ncontinued a stander-by, “she is bewitched, and so are two other young\r\ngirls that live near her.” The boor related, that at the town he came\r\nfrom in Bedfordshire, a man had been exactly in the same way; but, by a\r\n_charm_, he discovered the witch to be an old woman in the same parish,\r\nand that her reign would soon be over; which happened accordingly, for\r\nshe died in a few days, and the man recovered. “Thomas Brown tried this\r\ncharm last night for his daughter, but it did not succeed according to\r\nour wishes; so they have not at present found out who it is that does\r\nall the mischief.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholson was greatly shocked at the general opinion of the people\r\nthat Alice Brown, Fanny Amey, and Mary Fox were certainly bewitched by\r\nsome person who had bought a familiar or an evil spirit of the devil at\r\nthe expense of the buyer’s soul, and that various charms had been tried\r\nto discover who the buyer was. It was utterly out of his power to remove\r\nor diminish the impressions of his parishioners as to the enchantment;\r\nand on the following Sunday, a few minutes before he went to church, Ann\r\nIzzard, a poor woman about sixty years old, little, but not ill-looking,\r\nthe mother of eight children, five of whom were living, requested leave\r\nto speak to him. In tears and greatly agitated, she told him her\r\nneighbours pretended, that, by means of certain charms, they had\r\ndiscovered that _she_ was the witch. She said they abused her children,\r\nand by their violent threats frightened her so much that she frequently\r\ndropped down to the ground in fainting-fits. She concluded by asserting\r\nher innocence in these words: “I am not a witch, and am willing to prove\r\nit by being weighed against the church bible.” After the sermon, he\r\naddressed his flock on the folly of their opinions, and fatal\r\nconsequences of brooding over them. It appears, however, that his\r\narguments, explanations, and remonstrances were in vain. On Thursday,\r\nthe 5th of May, Ann Izzard was at St. Neot’s market, and her son, about\r\nsixteen years old, was sent there by his master for a load of corn: his\r\nmother and another woman, a shopkeeper in the parish, accompanied him\r\nhome; but, contrary to the mother’s advice, the woman put a basket of\r\ngrocery on the sacks of corn One of the horses, in going down hill,\r\nbecame restive, and overturned the cart; and by this accident the\r\ngrocery was much damaged. Because Ann Izzard had advised her neighbour\r\nagainst putting it in the cart, she charged her with upsetting it by the\r\nblack art, on purpose to spoil the goods. In an hour, the whole village\r\nwas in an uproar. “She has just overturned a loaded cart with as much\r\nease as if it had been a spinning-wheel: this is positive proof; it\r\nspeaks for itself; she is the person that does all the mischief; and if\r\nsomething is not done to put a stop to her baseness, there will be no\r\nliving in the place.” As it grew dark, on the following Sunday, these\r\nbrutal creatures assembled together, and at ten o’clock, taking with\r\nthem the young women supposed to be bewitched, they proceeded to Wright\r\nIzzard’s cottage, which stood in a solitary spot at some distance from\r\nthe body of the village; they broke into the poor man’s house, dragged\r\nhis wife naked from her bed into the yard, dashed her head against the\r\nlarge stones of the causeway, tore her arms with pins, and beat her on\r\nthe face, breast, and stomach with the wooden bar of the door. When the\r\nmob had dispersed, the abused and helpless woman crawled into her\r\ndwelling, put her clothes on, and went to the constable, who said he\r\ncould not protect her for he had not been sworn in. One Alice Russell, a\r\ncompassionate widow, unlocked her door to her at the first call,\r\ncomforted her, bound up her wounds, and put her to bed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the next day she was again dragged forth and her arms\r\ntorn till they streamed afresh with blood. Alive the following morning,\r\nand apparently likely to survive this attack also, her enemies resolved\r\nto duck her as soon as the labour of the day was over. On hearing this\r\nshe fled to Little Paxton, and hastily took refuge in the house of Mr.\r\nNicholson, who effectually secured her from the cruelty of his ignorant\r\nflock, and had the mortification to learn that his own neighbours\r\ncondemned him for “harbouring such a wretch.”\r\n\r\nThe kindness and affection of the widow Russel were the means of\r\nshortening her days. The infatuated populace cried, “The protectors of a\r\nwitch are just as bad as the witch, and deserve the same treatment.” She\r\nneither ate nor slept again from anxiety and fear; but died a martyr to\r\nher humanity in twelve days after her home became the asylum, for a few\r\nhours, of the unhappy Alice Izzard.\r\n\r\nAt the Huntingdon assizes in the August following, true bills of\r\nindictment were found by the grand jury against nine of these ignorant,\r\ninfuriated wretches, for assaults on Wright Izzard and Ann Izzard, which\r\nwere traversed to the following assizes.[52] It does not appear how they\r\nwere disposed of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Burt, an officer of engineers, who, about the year 1730, was\r\nsent into the north of Scotland on government service, relates the\r\nfollowing particulars of an interview between himself and a minister,\r\nwhom he met at the house of a nobleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Witchcraft._\r\n\r\nAfter the minister had said a good deal concerning the wickedness of\r\nsuch a diabolical practice as sorcery; and that I, in my turn, had\r\ndeclared my opinion of it, which you knew many years ago; he undertook\r\nto convince me of the reality of it by an example, which is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nA certain Highland laird had found himself at several times deprived of\r\nsome part of his wine, and having as often examined his servants about\r\nit, and none of them confessing, but all denying it with asseverations,\r\nhe was induced to conclude they were innocent.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to consider was, how this could happen. Rats there were\r\nnone to father the theft. Those, you know, according to your\r\nphilosophical next-door neighbour, might have drawn out the corks with\r\ntheir teeth, and then put in their tails, which, being long and\r\nspongeous, would imbibe a good quantity of liquor. This they might suck\r\nout again, and so on, till they had emptied as many bottles as were\r\nsufficient for their numbers and the strength of their heads. But to be\r\nmore serious:--I say there was no suspicion of rats, and it was\r\nconcluded it could be done by none but witches.\r\n\r\nHere the new inquisition was set on foot, and who they were was the\r\nquestion; but how should that be discovered? To go the shortest way to\r\nwork, the laird made choice of one night, and an hour when he thought it\r\nmight be watering-time with the hags; and went to his cellar without a\r\nlight, the better to surprise them. Then, with his naked broadsword in\r\nhis hand, he suddenly opened the door, and shut it after him, and fell\r\nto cutting and slashing all round about him, till, at last, by an\r\nopposition to the edge of his sword, he concluded he had at least\r\nwounded one of them. But I should have told you, that although the place\r\nwas very dark, yet he made no doubt, by the glare and flashes of their\r\neyes, that they were cats; but, upon the appearance of a candle, they\r\nwere all vanished, and only some blood left upon the floor. I cannot\r\nforbear to hint in this place at Don Quixote’s battle with the\r\n_borachios_ of wine.\r\n\r\nThere was an old woman, that lived about two miles from the laird’s\r\nhabitation, reputed to be a witch: her he greatly suspected to be one of\r\nthe confederacy, and immediately he hasted away to her hut; and,\r\nentering, he found her lying upon her bed, and bleeding excessively.\r\n\r\nThis alone was some confirmation of the justness of his suspicion; but\r\ncasting his eye under the bed, there lay her leg in its natural form.\r\n\r\nI must confess I was amazed at the conclusion of this narration; but ten\r\ntimes more, when, with the most serious air, he assured me that he had\r\nseen a certificate of the truth of it, signed by four ministers of that\r\npart of the country, and could procure me a sight of it in a few days,\r\nif I had the curiosity to see it.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his story, I used all the arguments I was master\r\nof, to show him the absurdity of supposing that a woman could be\r\ntransformed into the shape and diminutive substance of a cat; to vanish\r\nlike a flash of fire; carry her leg home with her, &c.: and I told him,\r\nthat if a certificate of the truth of it had been signed by every member\r\nof the general assembly, it would be impossible for me (however strong\r\nmy inclinations were to believe) to bring my mind to assent to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nAs a small matter of use and curiosity, I beg to acquaint the readers of\r\nthe _Every-Day Book_ with the means of determining the gradual increase\r\nof a plant.\r\n\r\nTake a straight piece of wood, of a convenient height; the upright\r\npiece, marked A B in the figure, may be divided into as many parts as\r\nyou think fit; in the manner of a carpenter’s rule: lay across the top\r\nof this another piece of wood, marked G with a small wheel, or pulley,\r\nat each end thereof, marked C D; they should be so fixed that a fine\r\nthread of silk may easily run through each of them: at the end of this\r\nthread, E, tie a small weight, or poise, and tie the other end of the\r\nthread, F, to the tip-top of the plant, as represented in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo find the daily increase of this plant, observe to what degree the\r\nknot F rises every day, at a particular hour, or to what degree the ball\r\nE descends every day.\r\n\r\nThis little machine may serve several good purposes. By this you will be\r\nable to judge how much nourishment a plant receives in the course of\r\neach day, and a tolerably just notion may be formed of its quality; for\r\nmoist plants grow quicker than dry ones, and the hot and moist quicker\r\nthan the cold and dry.\r\n\r\n  I am, sir,\r\n\r\n  Your constant reader,\r\n\r\n  S.

I. Nicholson, 8vo.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February, 1800, the rev. William Tasker, remarkable for\r\nhis learning and eccentricity, died, aged 60, at Iddesleigh, in\r\nDevonshire, of which church he was rector near thirty years, though he\r\nhad not enjoyed the income of the living till within five years before\r\nhis death, in consequence of merciless and severe persecutions and\r\nlitigations. “An Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain, 1778,” 4to., was\r\nthe first effusion of his poetical talent. His translations of “Select\r\nOdes of Pindar and Horace” add to his reputation with the muses, whose\r\nsmiles he courted by many miscellaneous efforts. He wrote “Arviragus,” a\r\ntragedy, and employed the last years of his checkered life on a “History\r\nof Physiognomy from Aristotle to Lavater,” wherein he illustrated the\r\nGreek philosopher’s knowledge of the subject in a manner similar to that\r\nwhich he pursued in “An Attempt to examine the several Wounds and Deaths\r\nof the Heroes in the Iliad and Æneid, trying them by the Test of Anatomy\r\nand Physiology.” These erudite dissertations contributed to his credit\r\nwith the learned, but added nothing to his means of existence. He\r\nusually wore a ragged coat, the shirt peeping at the elbows, and shoes\r\nof a brownish black, sometimes tied with packthread. Having heard that\r\nhis spirited “Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain” had been read by the\r\nlate king, George III., he presented himself, in his customary habit, on\r\nthe esplanade at Weymouth, where it excited curiosity; and his majesty\r\nasking an attendant who that person was? Mr. Tasker approached, avowed\r\nhis name, and obtained a gratifying reception. His productions evince\r\ncritical skill, and a large portion of poetic furor. But he was\r\nafflicted and unsuccessful; frequently struggling with penury, and\r\nsometimes with oppression. His irritability subjected him to numerous\r\nmortifications, and inflicted on him many pangs unknown to minds of less\r\nfeeling or less delicacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols, in his “Literary Anecdotes,” gives a letter he received\r\nfrom Mr. Tasker, dated from Iddesleigh, in December, 1798, wherein he\r\nsays, “I continue in very ill health, and confined in my dreary\r\nsituation at _Starvation Hall_, forty miles below Exeter, out of the\r\nverge of literature, and where even your extensive magazine [‘The\r\nGentleman’s’] has never yet reached.” The works he put forth from his\r\nsolitude procured him no advancement in the church, and, in the agony of\r\nan excruciating complaint, he departed from a world insensible to his\r\nmerits:--his widow essayed the publication of his works by subscription\r\nwithout effect. Such was the fate of an erudite and deserving parish\r\npriest, whose right estimation of honourable independence barred him\r\nfrom stooping to the meanness of flattery; he preserved his\r\nself-respect, and died without preferment, and in poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n_The Old Lady._\r\n\r\nIf the Old Lady is a widow and lives alone, the manners of her condition\r\nand time of life are so much the more apparent. She generally dresses in\r\nplain silks that make a gentle rustling as she moves about the silence\r\nof her room; and she wears a nice cap with a lace border that comes\r\nunder the chin. In a placket at her side is an old enamelled watch,\r\nunless it is locked up in a drawer of her toilet for fear of accidents.\r\nHer waist is rather tight and trim than otherwise, as she had a fine one\r\nwhen young; and she is not sorry if you see a pair of her stockings on a\r\ntable, that you may be aware of the neatness of her leg and foot.\r\nContented with these and other evident indications of a good shape, and\r\nletting her young friends understand that she can afford to obscure it a\r\nlittle, she wears pockets, and uses them well too. In the one is her\r\nhandkerchief, and any heavier matter that is not likely to come out with\r\nit, such as the change of a sixpence;--in the other is a miscellaneous\r\nassortment, consisting of a pocket-book, a bunch of keys, a needle-case,\r\na spectacle-case, crumbs of biscuit, a nutmeg and grater, a\r\nsmelling-bottle, and according to the season, an orange or apple, which,\r\nafter many days, she draws out, warm and glossy, to give to some little\r\nchild that has well behaved itself. She generally occupies two rooms, in\r\nthe neatest condition possible. In the chamber is a bed with a white\r\ncoverlet, built up high and round to look well, and with curtains of a\r\npastoral pattern, consisting alternately of large plants, and shepherds\r\nand shepherdesses. On the mantle-piece also are more shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses, with dot-eyed sheep at their feet, all in coloured ware,\r\nthe man perhaps in a pink jacket and knots of ribbons at his knees and\r\nshoes, holding his crook lightly in one hand, and with the other at his\r\nbreast turning his toes out and looking tenderly at the\r\nshepherdess:--the woman, holding a crook also, and modestly returning\r\nhis look, with a gipsy-hat jerked up behind, a very slender waist, with\r\npetticoat and hips to counteract, and the petticoat pulled up through\r\nthe pocket-holes in order to show the trimness of her ancles. But these\r\npatterns, of course, are various. The toilet is ancient, carved at the\r\nedges, and tied about with a snow-white drapery of muslin. Beside it are\r\nvarious boxes, mostly japan: and the set of drawers are exquisite things\r\nfor a little girl to rummage, if ever little girl be so\r\nbold,--containing ribbons and laces of various kinds,--linen smelling of\r\nlavender, of the flowers of which there is always dust in the\r\ncorners,--a heap of pocket-books for a series of years,--and pieces of\r\ndress long gone by, such as head-fronts, stomachers, and flowered satin\r\nshoes with enormous heels. The stock of letters are always under\r\nespecial lock and key. So much for the bed-room. In the sitting-room, is\r\nrather a spare assortment of shining old mahogany furniture, or carved\r\narm-chairs equally old, with chintz draperies down to the ground,--a\r\nfolding or other screen with Chinese figures, their round, little-eyed,\r\nmeek faces perking side-wise;--a stuffed bird perhaps in a glass case (a\r\nliving one is too much for her;)--a portrait of her husband over the\r\nmantle-piece, in a coat with frog-buttons, and a delicate frilled hand\r\nlightly inserted in the waistcoat:--and opposite him, on the wall, is a\r\npiece of embroidered literature, framed and glazed, containing some\r\nmoral distich or maxim worked in angular capital letters, with two trees\r\nor parrots below in their proper colours, the whole concluding with an\r\nA B C and numerals, and the name of the fair industrious, expressing it\r\nto be “her work, Jan. 14, 1762.” The rest of the furniture consists of a\r\nlooking-glass with carved edges, perhaps a settee, a hassock for the\r\nfeet, a mat for the little dog, and a small set of shelves, in which are\r\nthe Spectator and Guardian, the Turkish Spy, a Bible and Prayer-book,\r\nYoung’s Night-Thoughts, with a piece of lace in it to flatten, Mrs.\r\nRowe’s Devout Exercises of the Heart, Mrs. Glasse’s Cookery, and perhaps\r\nSir Charles Grandison, and Clarissa. John Buncle is in the closet among\r\nthe pickles and preserves. The clock is on the landing-place between the\r\ntwo room-doors, where it ticks audibly but quietly; and the\r\nlanding-place, as well as the stairs, is carpeted to a nicety. The house\r\nis most in character, and properly coeval, if it is in a retired suburb,\r\nand strongly built, with wainscot rather than paper inside, and lockers\r\nin the windows. Before the windows also should be some quivering\r\npoplars. Here the Old Lady receives a few quiet visitors to tea and\r\nperhaps an early game at cards; or you may sometimes see her going out\r\non the same kind of visit herself, with a light umbrella turning up into\r\na stick and crooked ivory handle, and her little dog equally famous for\r\nhis love to her and captious antipathy to strangers. Her grandchildren\r\ndislike him on holidays; and the boldest sometimes ventures to give him\r\na sly kick under the table. When she returns at night, she appears, if\r\nthe weather happens to be doubtful, in a calash; and her servant, in\r\npattens, follows half behind and half at her side, with a lantern.\r\n\r\nHer opinions are not many, nor new. She thinks the clergyman a nice man.\r\nThe duke of Wellington, in her opinion, is a very great man; but she has\r\na secret preference for the marquis of Granby. She thinks the young\r\nwomen of the present day too forward, and the men not respectful enough:\r\nbut hopes her grand-children will be better; though she differs with her\r\ndaughter in several points respecting their management. She sets little\r\nvalue on the new accomplishments: is a great though delicate connoisseur\r\nin butcher’s meat and all sorts of house-wifery: and if you mention\r\nwaltzes, expatiates on the grace and fine breeding of the minuet. She\r\nlongs to have seen one danced by sir Charles Grandison, whom she almost\r\nconsiders as a real person. She likes a walk of a summer’s evening, but\r\navoids the new streets, canals, &c. and sometimes goes through the\r\nchurch-yard where her other children and her husband lie buried,\r\nserious, but not melancholy. She has had three great æras in her\r\nlife,--her marriage,--her having been at court to see the king, queen,\r\nand royal family,--and a compliment on her figure she once received in\r\npassing from Mr. Wilkes, whom she describes as a sad loose man, but\r\nengaging. His plainness she thinks much exaggerated. If any thing takes\r\nher at a distance from home, it is still the court; but she seldom stirs\r\neven for that. The last time but one that she went was to see the duke\r\nof Wirtemberg: and she has lately been, most probably for the last time\r\nof all, to see the princess Charlotte and prince Leopold. From this\r\nbeatific vision, she returned with the same admiration as ever for the\r\nfine comely appearance of the duke of York and the rest of the family,\r\nand great delight at having had a near view of the princess, whom she\r\nspeaks of with smiling pomp and lifted mittens, clasping them as\r\npassionately as she can together, and calling her, in a sort of\r\ntransport of mixed loyalty and self-love, a fine royal young creature,\r\nand daughter of England.--_Indicator._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Season._\r\n\r\nSudden storms of short duration, the last blusters of expiring winter,\r\nfrequently occur during the early part of the present month. These gales\r\nand gusts are mostly noticed by mariners, who expect them, and therefore\r\nkeep a good “look out for squalls.” The observations of seamen upon the\r\nclouds, and of husbandmen on the natural appearances of the weather\r\ngenerally, would form an exceedingly curious and useful compendium of\r\nmeteorological facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stilling the Sea with Oil._\r\n\r\nDr. Franklin suggests the pouring of oil on the sea to still the waves\r\nin a storm, but, before he lived, Martin wrote an “Account of the\r\nWestern Islands of Scotland,” wherein he says, “The steward of _Kilda_,\r\nwho lives in _Pabbay_, is accustomed in time of a storm to tie a bundle\r\nof puddings, made of the fat of sea-fowl, to the end of his cable, and\r\nlets it fall into the sea behind the rudder; this, he says, hinders the\r\nwaves from breaking, and calms the sea; but the scent of the grease\r\nattracts the whales, which put the vessel in danger.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·34.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 5.~\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Browne Willis, Esq.

He was unexcelled in\r\neagerness of inquiry concerning our national antiquities, and his life\r\nwas devoted to their study and arrangement. Some interesting particulars\r\nconcerning the published labours and domestic habits of this\r\ndistinguished individual, will be given in a subsequent sheet, with one\r\nof his letters, not before printed, accompanied by a fac-simile of his\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·20.\r\n\r\n  [53] See “Every-Day Book,” vol. i. p. 1303.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 6.~\r\n\r\nCOLLOP MONDAY. See vol. i. p. 241.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Season and Smoking._\r\n\r\nAt this time, Dr. Forster says that people should guard against colds,\r\nand, above all, against the contagion of typhus and other fevers, which\r\nare apt to prevail in the early spring. “Smoking tobacco,” he observes,\r\n“is a very salutary practice in general, as well as being a preventive\r\nagainst infection in particular. The German pipes are the best, and get\r\nbetter as they are used, particularly those made of merschaum, called\r\n_Ecume de Mer_. Next to these, the Turkey pipes, with long tubes, are to\r\nbe recommended; but these are fitter for summer smoking, under the shade\r\nof trees, than for the fireside. The best tobacco is the Turkey, the\r\nPersian, and what is called Dutch canaster. Smoking is a custom which\r\nshould be recommended in the close cottages of the poor, and in great\r\npopulous towns liable to contagion.”\r\n\r\n_The Rule of Health._\r\n\r\n    Rise early, and, take exercise in plenty,\r\n    But always take it with your stomach empty.\r\n    After your meals sit still and rest awhile,\r\n    And with your pipe a careless hour beguile.\r\n    To rise at light or five, breakfast at nine,\r\n    Lounge till eleven, and at five to dine,\r\n    To drink and smoke till seven, the time of tea,\r\n    And then to dance or walk two hours away\r\n    Till ten o’clock,--good hour to go to nest,\r\n    Till the next cock shall wake you from your rest.\r\n\r\nOn the virtues of tobacco its users enhance with mighty eloquence, and\r\npuff it bravely.\r\n\r\n_In praise of Tobacco._\r\n\r\n    Much food doth gluttony procure to feed men fat like swine,\r\n    But he’s a frugal man indeed who on a leaf can dine.\r\n\r\n    He needs no napkin for his hands, his finger ends to wipe,\r\n    Who has his kitchen in a box, his roast-meat in a pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·47.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 7.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1826.--SHROVE TUESDAY.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the customs and sports of this day are related in vol i. p.\r\n242-261. It is the last _meat_ day permitted by the papacy before Lent,\r\nwhich commences to-morrow, and therefore in former times, full advantage\r\nwas taken of the expiring opportunity to feast and make merry. Selden\r\nobserves, “that what the church debars us one day, she gives us leave to\r\neat another--first, there is a carnival, and then a Lent.” This period\r\nis also recorded in the homely rhymes of Barnaby Googe.\r\n\r\n_Shrove-tide._\r\n\r\n    Now when at length the pleasant time of Shrove-tide comes in place,\r\n    And cruell fasting dayes at hand approach with solemne grace.\r\n    Then olde and yong are both as mad, as ghestes of Bacchus’ feast,\r\n    And foure dayes long they tipple square, and feede and never reast.\r\n    Downe goes the hogges in every place, and puddings every wheare\r\n    Do swarme: the dice are shakte and tost, and cardes apace they\r\n      teare:\r\n    In every house are showtes and cryes, and mirth, and revell route,\r\n    And daintie tables spred, and all be set with ghestes aboute:\r\n    With sundrie playes and Christmasse games, and feare and shame away,\r\n    The tongue is set at libertie, and hath no kinde of stay.\r\n\r\n  _Naogeorgus._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Seal in Danger._\r\n\r\n_February 7, 1677_, about one in the morning, the lord chancellor\r\nFinch’s mace was stolen out of his house in Queen-street; the seal laid\r\nunder his pillow, so the thief missed it.

They were to unshoe themselves, wash their\r\nhands, and go to church, and make one common prayer. Then was to follow\r\na religious service; after which the priest, having consecrated the\r\nashes, and sprinkled holy water on them, was to throw them on the heads\r\nof the monks, saying, “Remember that you are but dust, and to dust must\r\nreturn.” Then “the procession” was to follow.[56]\r\n\r\nIn former times, on the evening of Ash Wednesday, boys used to run about\r\nwith firebrands and torches.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lent Assizes and Sessions._\r\n\r\nThese follow, in due course, after Hilary Term, which is within a week\r\nof its expiration.

I was\r\nhand in glove with him, I’ll tell you a droll story about him--\r\n\r\n_Court._ Hush, brother. _Culprit_, how will you be tried?\r\n\r\n_Counsel for the Prosecution._ Please your worship, he won’t say a word.\r\n_Stat mutus_--as mute as a fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Court._ How?--what?--won’t the dog speak? Won’t he do what the court\r\nbids him? What’s to be done? Is the dignity of this court to be trifled\r\nwith in such a manner?\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ Please your worships--it is provided by the statute\r\nin these cases, that when a culprit is stubborn, and refuses to plead,\r\nhe is to be made to plead whether he will or no.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Ay? How’s that, pray?\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ Why, the statute says--that he must first of all be\r\n_thumb-screwed_--\r\n\r\n_Court._ Very good.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ If _that_ will not do, he must be laid flat on his\r\nback, and squeezed, like a cheese in a press, with heavy weights.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Very well. And what then?\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ What then? Why, when all the breath is squeezed out\r\nof his body, if he should still continue dumb, which sometimes has been\r\nthe case, he generally dies for want of breath.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Very likely.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ And thereby saves the court a great deal of trouble;\r\nand the nation, the expense of a halter.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Well, then, since the land stands thus--constable, twist a cord\r\nabout the _culprit’s_--\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ Fore-paws.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ _Four_ paws? Why he has but two.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Fore-paws, or fore-feet, blockhead! and strain it as tight as\r\nyou can, ’till you make him open his mouth.\r\n\r\n  [The constable attempted to enforce the order, but in drawing a little\r\n  too hard, received a severe bite.]\r\n\r\n_Constable._ _’Sblood and suet!_ He has snapped off a piece of my nose.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Mr. Constable, you are within the statute of swearing, and owe\r\nthe court one shilling.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ _Zounds and death!_ your worships! I could not help it for\r\nthe blood o’ me.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Now you owe us two shillings.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ That’s a d----d bad plaster, your worships, for a sore\r\nnose!\r\n\r\n_Court._ That being but _half_ an oath, the whole fine amounts to two\r\nshillings and sixpence, or a half-crown bowl. So, without going further,\r\nif you are afraid of his teeth, apply this pair of _nut-crackers_ to his\r\ntail.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ I shall, your worships.\r\n\r\n  [He had better success with the tail, as will now appear.]\r\n\r\n_Prisoner._ _Bow, wow, wow, ow, wow!_\r\n\r\n_Court._ Hold! Enough. That will do.\r\n\r\nIt was now held that though the prisoner expressed himself in a strange\r\nlanguage, yet, as he could speak no other, and as the law can not only\r\nmake _dogs_ to speak, but explain their meaning too, so the law\r\nunderstood and inferred that the prisoner pleaded _not guilty_, and put\r\nhimself upon his trial. _Issue_ therefore being joined, the _Counsel for\r\nthe Prosecution_ proceeded to address the Court; but was stopped by the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n_Prisoner’s Counsel._ I take leave to _demur_ to the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourt. If he is to have a trial _per pares_, you must either suppose\r\ntheir worships to be his _equals_, that is to say, _not_ his _betters_,\r\nwhich would be a great indignity, or else you must have a _venire_ for a\r\njury of _twelve dogs_. I think you are fairly caught in this dilemma.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ By no means. It is easily cured. We’ll send the\r\nconstable with a _Mandamus_ to his _Grace’s kennel_.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ They are _fox hounds_. Not the same species; therefore\r\nnot his equals. I do not object to the _harriers_, nor to a _tales de\r\ncircumstantibus_.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ That’s artful, brother, but it won’t take. I smoke\r\nyour intention of _garbling_ a jury. You know the _harriers_ will be\r\npartial, and acquit your client at any rate. Neither will we have any\r\nthing to do with your _tales_.\r\n\r\n_Mat._ No--no--you say right. I hate your _tales_ and _tale-bearers_.\r\nThey are a rascally _pack_ altogether.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ Besides, the statute gives your worships _ample_\r\njurisdiction in this case; and if it did not _give_ it, your worships\r\nknow how to _take_ it, because the law says, _boni est judicis ampliare\r\njurisdictionem_.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ Then--I _demur_ for irregularity. The prisoner is a\r\n_dog_, and cannot be triable as a _man_--_ergo_, not within the intent\r\nof the statute.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ That’s a poor subterfuge. If the statute respects a\r\n_man_, (_a fortiori_) it will affect a _dog_.\r\n\r\n_Ponser._ You are certainly right. For when I was in the _Turkish_\r\ndominions, I saw an _Hebrew Jew_ put to death for killing a _dog_,\r\nalthough _dog_ was the aggressor.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ A case in point, please your worship. And a very\r\ncurious and learned one it is. And the plain induction from it is this,\r\nthat the _Jew_ (who I take for granted was a _man_) being put to death\r\nfor killing _dog_, it follows that said _dog_ was as respectable a\r\nperson, and of equal rank in society with the said _Jew_; and\r\ntherefore--_ergo_--and moreover--That, said _dog_, so slain, was, to all\r\nand every purpose of legal inference and intendment, neither more nor\r\nless than--a _man_.\r\n\r\n_Court._ We are all clearly of that opinion.\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ Please your worships of the honourable bench. On\r\n_Saturday_ the day of _February inst._ on or about the hour of _five_ in\r\nthe afternoon, the deceased Mr. _Hare_ was travelling quietly about his\r\nbusiness, in a certain highway or road leading towards _Muckingham_; and\r\nthen, and there, the prisoner at the bar being in the same road, in and\r\nupon the body of the deceased, with force and arms, a violent assault\r\ndid make; and further, not having the fear of your worships before his\r\neyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of a devilish fit\r\nof hunger, he the said prisoner did him the said deceased, in the peace\r\nof our lord of the manor then and there being, feloniously, wickedly,\r\nwantonly, and of malice aforethought, tear, wound, pull, haul, touzle,\r\nmasticate, macerate, lacerate, and dislocate, and otherwise evilly\r\nintreat; of all and singular which tearings, woundings, pullings,\r\nhaulings, touzleings, mastications, and so forth, maliciously inflicted\r\nin manner and form aforesaid, the said _Hare_ did languish, and\r\nlanguishing did die, in Mr. _Just-ass Ponser’s_ horsepond, to wit, and\r\nthat is to say, contrary to the statute in that case made and provided,\r\nand against the peace of our said lord, his manor and dignity.\r\n\r\nThis, please your worships, is the purport of the indictment; to this\r\nindictment the prisoner has pleaded _not guilty_, and now stands upon\r\nhis trial before this honourable bench.\r\n\r\nYour worships will therefore allow me, before I come to call our\r\nevidence, to expatiate a little upon the heinous sin, wherewith the\r\nprisoner at the bar is charged. Hem!--To _murder_,--Ehem--To _murder_,\r\nmay it please your worships, in Latin, is--is--_Murderare_;--or in the\r\ntrue and original sense of the word, _Murder-ha-re_. _H--_, as your\r\nworships well know, being not as yet raised to the dignity of a letter\r\nby any act of parliament, it follows that it plainly is no other than\r\n_Murder-a-re_, according to modern refined pronunciation. The very root\r\nand etymology of the word does therefore comprehend in itself a thousand\r\nvolumes in folio, to show the nefarious and abominable guilt of the\r\nprisoner, in the commission and perpetration of this horrid fact. And it\r\nmust appear as clear as sunshine to your worships, that the word\r\n_Murderare_, which denotes the prisoner’s crime, was expressly and\r\noriginally applied to that crime, and to _that_ only, as being the most\r\nsuperlative of all possible crimes in the world. I do not deny that,\r\nsince it first came out of the mint, it has, through corruption, been\r\naffixed to offences of a less criminal nature, such as _killing_ a\r\n_man_, a _woman_, or a _child_. But the sense of the earliest ages\r\nhaving stamped _hare-murder_, or _murder-ha-re_, (as the old books have\r\nit,) with such extraordinary atrociousness, I am sure that _Just-asses_\r\nof your worships’ acknowledged and well-known wisdom, piety, erudition,\r\nand humanity, will not, at this time of the day, be persuaded to hold it\r\nless detestable and sinful. Having said thus much on the nature of the\r\nprisoner’s _guilt_, I mean not to aggravate the charge, because I shall\r\nalways feel due compassion for my _fellow-creatures_, however wickedly\r\nthey may demean themselves.--I shall next proceed, with your worships’\r\nleave, to call our witnesses.--Call _Lawrence Lurcher_ and _Toby\r\nTunnel_.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ I must object to swearing these witnesses.--I can\r\nprove, they were both of them _drunk_, and _non compos_, during the\r\nwhole evening, when this fact is supposed to have been committed.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ That will do you no service. I am very often _drunk_ myself,\r\nand never _more_ in my senses than at such times.\r\n\r\n_Court._ We all agree in this point with brother _Bottle_.\r\n\r\n[Objection overruled and witnesses sworn.]\r\n\r\n_Lurcher._ As I, and _Toby Tunnel_ here, was a going hoam to squire\r\n_Ponser’s_, along the road, one evening after dark, we sees the prisoner\r\nat the bar, or somebody like him, lay hold of the deceased, or somebody\r\nlike him, by the back, an’t please your worships. So, says I, _Toby_,\r\nsays I, that looks for all the world like one of ’squire _Ponser’s_\r\nhares. So the deceased cried out pitifully for help, and jumped over a\r\nhedge, and the prisoner after him, growling and swearing bitterly all\r\nthe way. So, says I, _Toby_, let’s run after ’um. So I scrambled up the\r\nhedge; but _Toby_ laid hold of my leg, to help himself up; so both of us\r\ntumbled through a thick furze bush into the ditch. So, next morning, as\r\nwe was a going by the squire’s, we sees the deceased in his worship’s\r\nhorse-pond.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ Are you sure he was dead?\r\n\r\n_Lurcher._ Ay, as dead as my great grandmother.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ What did you do with the body?\r\n\r\n_Ponser._ That’s not a fair question. It ought not to be answered.\r\n\r\n_Lurcher._ I bean’t ashamed nor afeard to tell, not I. We carried it to\r\nhis worship, squire _Ponser_; and his worship had him roasted, with a\r\npudding in his belly, for dinner, that seame day.\r\n\r\n_Council for Pros._ That is nothing to the purpose. Have you any more\r\nquestions for the witness?\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ Yes, I have. Pray friend, how do you know the body you\r\nfound was the very same you saw on the evening before?\r\n\r\n_Lurcher._ I can’t tell; but I’m ready to take my _bible oath_ on’t.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ That is a _princely_ argument, and I shall ask you\r\nnothing farther.\r\n\r\nMrs. _Margery Dripping_, cook to his worship squire _Ponser_, deposed to\r\nthe condition of the deceased.\r\n\r\nDEFENCE\r\n\r\n_Prisoner’s Counsel._ Please your worships, I am counsel for the\r\nprisoner, who, in obedience to your worships’ commands, has pleaded _not\r\nguilty_; and I hope to prove that his plea is a good plea; and that he\r\nmust be acquitted by the justice of his cause. In the first place, the\r\nwitnesses have failed in proving the prisoner’s identity. Next, they\r\nhave not proved the identity of the deceased. Thirdly, they do not prove\r\nwho gave the wounds. Fourthly, nor to whom they were given. Fifthly, nor\r\nwhether the party died of the wounds, if they were given, as supposed,\r\nto this identical _hare_. For, I insist upon it, that, because _a hare_\r\nwas found in the squire’s horse-pond, _non sequitur_, that he was\r\nkilled, and thrown in by the defendant. Or, if they had proved that\r\ndefendant had maliciously, and _animo furioso_, pursued the deceased\r\ninto the horse-pond, it does not prove the _defendant_ guilty of his\r\ndeath, because he might owe his death to the _water_; and therefore, in\r\nthat case, the _pond_ would be _guilty_; and if _guilty_, triable; and\r\nif triable, _punishable_ for the same, and _not_ my client. And I must\r\nsay, (under favour,) that his _worship_ would likewise be _particeps\r\ncriminis_, for not having filled it up, to prevent such accidents. One\r\nevidence, who never saw the prisoner till now, nor the deceased till\r\nafter the fact supposed to have happened, declares, he is sure the\r\nprisoner killed the deceased. And why? Because he is ready to take his\r\n_bible oath_ on’t. This is, to be sure, a very _logical_ conviction.\r\n\r\n_Court._ It is a very _legal_ one, and that’s better.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ I submit to your wisdoms. But I must conclude with\r\nobserving, that admitting a part of the evidence to be true, viz. that\r\nthe prisoner did meet the deceased on the highway, and held some\r\nconference with him; I say, that supposing this, for argument sake; I do\r\ninsist, that Mr. _Hare_, the deceased, was not following a lawful,\r\nhonest business, at that late hour; but was wickedly and mischievously\r\nbent upon a felonious design, of trespassing on farmer _Carter’s_\r\nground, and stealing, consuming, and carrying off, his corn and his\r\nturnips. I further insist that the defendant, knowing this his felonious\r\nand evil machination, and being resolved to defend the property of his\r\ngood friend and patron from such depredations, did endeavour to divert\r\nhim from it. Which not being able to effect by fair means, he then was\r\nobliged to try his utmost, as a good subject and trusty friend, to seize\r\nand apprehend his person, and bring him, _per habeas corpus_, before\r\nyour worships, to be dealt with according to law. But the deceased being\r\ntoo nimble for him, escaped out of his clutches, and tumbling,\r\naccidentally, in the dark, into his worship’s horse-pond, was there\r\n_drowned_. This is, I do not doubt, a true history of the whole affair;\r\nand proves that, in the strictest construction of law, it can only be a\r\ncase of _per infortunium_--unless your worships should rather incline to\r\ndeem it _felo de se_.\r\n\r\n_Noodle._ _A fall in the sea!_ No such thing: it was only a\r\n_horse-pond_, that’s clear from the evidence.\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ Howsoever your worships may think fit to judge of it, I\r\ndo humbly conceive, upon the whole matter, that the defendant is _not\r\nguilty_; and I hope your worships, in your wisdoms, will concur with me\r\nin opinion, and _acquit_ him.\r\n\r\nThe _Counsel for the Prosecution_ replied in a long speech. He contended\r\nthat Mr. _Hare_, the deceased, was a peaceable, quiet, sober, and\r\ninoffensive sort of a person, beloved by _king_, _lords_, and _commons_,\r\nand never was known to entertain any idea of robbery, felony, or\r\ndepredation, but was innocently taking the air, one afternoon, for the\r\nbenefit of his health, when he was suddenly accosted, upon his majesty’s\r\nhighway, by the prisoner, who immediately, and bloody-mindedly, without\r\nsaying a syllable, made at him, with so much fury in his countenance,\r\nthat the deceased was put in bodily fear; and being a lover of peace,\r\ncrossed the other side of the way: the prisoner followed him close, and\r\npressed him so hard, that he was obliged to fly over hedge and ditch\r\nwith the prisoner at his heels. It was at this very juncture they were\r\nobserved by the two witnesses first examined. The learned counsel\r\nfurther affirmed from circumstances, which he contended amounted to\r\n_presumptive_ evidence, that, after various turnings and windings, in\r\nhis endeavour to escape, his foot slipped, and the prisoner seized him\r\nand inflicted divers wounds; but that the deceased finding means to get\r\naway, took to the pond, in order to swim across; when the prisoner,\r\nrunning round the pond incessantly, prevented his escape: so that, faint\r\nand languishing under his wounds and loss of blood, the hapless victim\r\nthere breathed his last, in manner and form as the indictment sets\r\nforth. He also alleged that, as Mr. _Hare_ lived within his worship’s\r\nterritory, where there are several more of the same family, he could\r\nnot, therefore, be going to farmer _Carter’s_; for that would have been\r\nabsurd, when he might have got corn and turnips enough on his worship’s\r\nown ground. Can there, said the learned gentleman, be a stronger, a\r\nweightier, a surer, a--a--a--?\r\n\r\n_Court._ We understand you. It is as clear as _crystal_.\r\n\r\n  [Their worships in consultation.]\r\n\r\n_Court._ Has the prisoner’s counsel any thing further to offer in his\r\nbehalf?\r\n\r\n_Pris. Counsel._ Call farmer Carter.\r\n\r\nPray, _farmer Carter_, inform the court what you know of the prisoner’s\r\nlife, character, and behaviour.\r\n\r\n_Carter._ I have known the prisoner these several years. He has lived in\r\nmy house great part of the time. He was always sober--\r\n\r\n_Court._ Never the _honester_ for that. Well, go on.\r\n\r\n_Carter._ Sober, honest, sincere, trusty, and careful. He was one of the\r\nbest and most faithful friends I ever knew. He has many a time deterred\r\nthieves from breaking into my house at night, and murdering me and my\r\nfamily. He never hated nor hurt any body but rogues and night-walkers.\r\nHe performed a million of good offices for me, for no other recompense\r\nthan his victuals and lodging; and seemed always happy and contented\r\nwith what I could afford him, however scanty the provision. He has\r\ndriven away many a _fox_ that came to steal my geese and turkies; and,\r\nfor taking care of a flock of sheep, there is not his equal in the\r\ncounty. In short, whenever he dies I shall lose my best friend, my best\r\nservant, and most vigilant protector. I am positive that he is as\r\ninnocent as a babe of the crime charged upon him; for he was with me\r\nthat whole evening, and supped and slept at home. He was indeed my\r\nconstant companion, and we were seldom or never asunder. If your\r\nworships please, I’ll be _bail_ for him from _five pounds to five\r\nhundred_.\r\n\r\n_Court._ That cannot be: it is not a _bailable offence_. Have you any\r\nthing else to say, Mr. _Positive_?\r\n\r\n_Carter._ Say? I think I’ve said enough, if it signified any thing.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ Drag him away out of hearing.\r\n\r\n_Carter._ I will have justice! You, all of ye, deserve hanging more than\r\nyour prisoner, and you all know it too.\r\n\r\n_Court._ Away with him, constable.--_Scum of the earth! Base-born\r\npeasant!_\r\n\r\n  [_Carter_ is hauled out of the court, after a stout resistance.]\r\n\r\n_Court._ _A sturdy beggar!_ We must find out some means of _wiring_ that\r\nfellow!\r\n\r\n_The Counsel for the Prosecution_ prayed sentence of death upon the\r\n_culprit_ at the bar.\r\n\r\n_Court._ How says the _statute_? Are we competent for this?\r\n\r\n_Counsel for Pros._ The _statute_ is, I confess, silent. But silence\r\ngives consent. Besides, this is a case of the first impression, and\r\nunprovided for by law. It is your duty, therefore, as good and wise\r\nmagistrates of the _Hundreds_ of _Gotham_, to supply this defect of the\r\nlaw, and to suppose that the law, where it says nothing, may be meant to\r\nsay, whatever your worships shall be pleased to make it.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ It is now incumbent upon me to declare the opinion of this\r\nhigh and right worshipful court here assembled.\r\n\r\nShall the reptile of a dunghill, a paltry muckworm, a pitch-fork fellow,\r\npresume for to go for to keep a _dog_?--and not only a dog, but a dog\r\nthat murders _hares_? Are these divine creatures, that are religiously\r\nconsecrated to the mouths alone of squires and nobles, to become the\r\nfood of garlic-eating rogues? It is a food, that nature and policy\r\nforbid to be contaminated by their profane teeth. It is by far too\r\ndainty for their _robustious_ constitutions. How are our clayey lands to\r\nbe turned up and harrowed, and our harvests to be got in, if our\r\nlabourers, who should strengthen themselves with _beef_ and _ale_,\r\nshould come to be fed with _hare_, _partridge_, and _pheasant_? Shall we\r\nsuffer our giants to be nourished with mince-meat and pap? Shall we\r\ngive our horses chocolate and muffins? No, gentlemen. The brains of\r\nlabourers, tradesmen, and mechanics, (if they have any,) should ever be\r\nsodden and stupified with the grosser aliments of _bacon_ and\r\n_dumpling_. What is it, but the spirit of _poaching_, that has set all\r\nthe lower class, the _canaille_, a hunting after _hare’s-flesh_? You see\r\nthe effects of it gentlemen; they are all run mad with _politics_,\r\nresist their rulers, despise their magistrates, and abuse _us_ in every\r\ncorner of the kingdom. If you had begun hanging of _poachers_ ten years\r\nago, d’ye think you would have had _one_ left in the whole kingdom by\r\nthis time? No, I’ll answer for it; and your _hares_ would have\r\nmultiplied, till they had been as plenty as _blackberries_, and not left\r\na stalk of corn upon the ground. This, gentlemen, is the very thing we\r\nought to struggle for; that these insolent clowns may come to find, that\r\nthe only _use_ they are good for, is to furnish provision for these\r\nanimals. In short, gentlemen, although it is not totally clear from the\r\nevidence, that the prisoner is _guilty_; nevertheless, _hanged_ he must\r\nand ought to be, _in terrorem_ to all other offenders.\r\n\r\nTherefore let the _culprit_ stand up, and hearken to the judgment of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ Please your worship, he’s up.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ _Porter!_ Thou hast been found _guilty_ of a most daring,\r\nhorrible, and atrocious crime. Thou hast, without being qualified as the\r\nlaw directs, and without licence or deputation from the _lord_ of the\r\n_manor_, been _guilty_ of shedding innocent blood. In so doing, thou\r\nhast broken the peace of the realm, set at naught the laws and statutes\r\nof thy country, and (what is more than all these) offended against these\r\nrespectable personages, who have been sitting in judgment upon thee. For\r\nall this enormity of guilt, thy life doth justly become forfeit, to\r\natone for such manifold injuries done to our most excellent\r\nconstitution. We did intend, in _Christian_ charity, to have given some\r\nmoments for thy due repentance, but, as the hour is late, and _dinner\r\nready_, now hear thy _doom_.\r\n\r\nThou must be led from the bar to the end of the room, where thou art to\r\nbe _hanged_ by the neck to yonder beam, _coram nobis_, till you are\r\n_dead, dead, dead_! _Hangman_, do your duty.\r\n\r\n_Constable._ Please your worships, all is ready.\r\n\r\n_Ponser._ Hoist away, then, hoist away.\r\n\r\n  [_Porter_ is tucked up.]\r\n\r\n_Mat._ Come, it seems to be pretty well over with him now. The constable\r\nhas given him a jerk, and done his business.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ He’s an excellent fellow.\r\n\r\n_Ponser._ The best _informer_ in the whole county.\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ And must be well encouraged.\r\n\r\n_Ponser._ He shall never want a _licence_, whilst _I_ live.\r\n\r\n_Noodle._ Come, shall we go to _dinner_?\r\n\r\n_Bottle._ Ay--he’ll never course _hares_ again in this world. Gentlemen,\r\nthe court is _adjourned_.\r\n\r\n  [_Exeunt omnes._\r\n\r\nEPITAPH,\r\n\r\n  _Composed by Sam.

He was afterwards appointed judge of the vice-admiralty\r\ncourt, and left the island in 1769. The remainder of his long life was\r\nspent in England, and devoted to literature. Mr. Long’s first production\r\nwas the facetious report of the case of “Farmer Carter’s Dog Porter.” He\r\nwrote ably on negro slavery, the sugar trade, and the state of the\r\ncolonies; but his most distinguished work is “The History of Jamaica,”\r\nin three quarto volumes, which contains a large mass of valuable\r\ninformation, much just reasoning, and many spirited delineations of\r\ncolonial scenery and manners, and is almost as rare as the curious and\r\namusing tract that has contributed to the preceding pages. He was born\r\non the 23d of August, 1734, at Rosilian, in the parish of St. Blaize,\r\nCornwall, and died, on the 13th of March, 1813, at the house of his\r\nson-in-law, Henry Howard Molyneux, esq.

From this legend, St. Apollonia is become the patron saint\r\nof persons afflicted by _tooth-ach_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the “Horæ B.

A church at Bononia possesses her _lower_ jaw, “which is\r\nsolemnly worshipped by the legate;” St. Alban’s church at Cologne also\r\nhas her _lower_ jaw--each equally genuine and of equal virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n1555. On the 9th of February in this year, Dr. Rowland Taylor, vicar of\r\nHadleigh in Suffolk, one of the first towns in England that entertained\r\nthe Reformation, suffered death there for resisting the establishment of\r\npapal worship in his church. The engraving beneath is a correct\r\nrepresentation of an old stone commemorative of the event, as it\r\nappeared in 1825, when the drawing was made from it, by a gentleman who\r\nobligingly transmits it for the present purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Martyr’s Stone at Hadleigh in Suffolk.~]\r\n\r\nBesides the rude inscription on this old stone, as it is represented in\r\nthe engraving, there is another on a neat monument erected by the side\r\nof the original in 1818. The lines are as follows: they were supplied\r\nby the Rev. Dr. Hay Drummond, rector of Hadleigh.\r\n\r\n    Mark this rude Stone, where Taylor dauntless stood,\r\n    Where Zeal infuriate drank the Martyr’s blood:\r\n    Hadleigh! that day, how many a tearful eye\r\n    Saw the lov’d Pastor dragg’d a Victim by;\r\n    Still scattering gifts and blessings as he past\r\n    “To the blind pair” his farewell alms were cast;\r\n    His clinging flock e’en here around him pray’d\r\n    “As thou hast aided us, be God thine aid;”\r\n    Nor taunts, nor bribes of mitred rank, nor stake,\r\n    Nor blows, nor flames, his heart of firmness shake;\r\n    Serene--his folded hands, his upward eyes,\r\n    Like Holy Stephen’s, seek the opening skies;\r\n    There, fix’d in rapture, his prophetic sight\r\n    Views Truth dawn clear, on England’s bigot night;\r\n    Triumphant Saint! he bow’d, and kiss’d the rod,\r\n    And soar’d on Seraph-wing to meet his God.\r\n\r\nRowland Taylor was “a doctor in both the civil and canon lawes, and a\r\nright perfect divine.” On induction to his benefice, he resided with his\r\nflock, “as a good shepherd abiding and dwelling among his sheep,” and\r\n“not only was his word a preaching unto them, but all his life and\r\nconversation was an example of unfained christian life, and true\r\nholinesse: he was void of all pride, humble and meeke as any child, so\r\nthat none were so poore, but they might boldly, as unto their father,\r\nresort unto him; neither was his lowlinesse childish or fearfull; but,\r\nas occasion, time, and place required, he would be stout in rebuking the\r\nsinfull and evil doers, so that none was so rich, but he would tell him\r\nplainly his fault, with such earnest and grave rebukes as became a good\r\ncurate and pastor.” He continued in well-doing at Hadleigh during the\r\nreign of king Edward VI. till the days of queen Mary, when one Foster, a\r\nlawyer, and one John Clerk, of Hadley, “hired one Averth, parson of\r\nAldam, a right popish priest, to come to Hadley, and there to give the\r\nonset to begin again the popish masse: to this purpose they builded up,\r\nwith all haste possible, the altar, intending to bring in their masse\r\nagain about the Palme Munday.” The altar was thrown down in the night,\r\nbut on the following day it was replaced, and the Aldam priest entered\r\nthe church, attended by Foster and Clerk, and guarded by men with swords\r\nand bucklers. Dr. Taylor, who was in his study, and ignorant of this\r\nirruption, hearing the church bells ring, repaired thither, and found\r\nthe priest, surrounded by his armed force, ready to begin mass, against\r\nwhom he was unable to prevail, and was himself thrust, “with strong\r\nhand, out of the church.” Two days afterwards, he was summoned by\r\nGardiner, bishop of Winchester, to come before him at London, and answer\r\ncomplaints. His friends counselled him to fly, but Taylor determined to\r\nmeet his enemies, “and, to their beards, resist their false doings.” He\r\ntook his departure amidst their weeping, “leaving his cure with a godly\r\nold priest named sir Richard Yeoman, who afterwards, for God’s truth,\r\nwas burnt at Norwich.” On his appearance, bishop Gardiner, who was also\r\nlord chancellor, reviled him, “calling him knave, traitor, heretike,\r\nwith many other villainous reproaches.” Taylor listened patiently: at\r\nlast he said, “My lord, I am neither traitor nor heretike, but a true\r\nsubject, and a faithfull christian man; and am come, according to your\r\ncommandment, to know what is the cause that your lordship hath sent for\r\nme?” The bishop charged upon him that he was married. “Yea,” quoth\r\nTaylor, “that I thank God I am, and have had nine children, and all in\r\nlawful matrimony; and blessed be God that ordained matrimony.” Then the\r\nbishop charged him with having resisted the priest of Aldam in saying\r\nmass at Hadleigh. Taylor also admitted this, and, after stout dispute,\r\nwas committed to the king’s bench, where he spent his time in praying,\r\nreading the scriptures, writing, preaching, and exhorting the prisoners\r\nto repentance and amendment of life. There he found “master Bradford,”\r\nwhom he comforted by his courage. While imprisoned, he was cited to\r\nappear “in the Arches at Bow church,” and was carried thither, and\r\n“deprived of his benefice because he was married.” On the 20th of\r\nJanuary, 1555, Taylor was again taken before Gardiner and other bishops.\r\nHe gives a long account of his disputations with them on that and like\r\noccasions. They urged him, and others with him, to recant: the prisoners\r\nrefused, and “then the bishops read sentence of death upon them.”\r\n\r\nAfter condemnation, Dr. Taylor was “bestowed in the Clinke till it was\r\ntoward night, and then he was removed to the counter by the Poultry.” On\r\nthe 4th of February, Bonner, bishop of London, came to the counter to\r\ndegrade him; first wishing him to return to the church of Rome, and\r\npromising him to sue for his pardon. Whereunto Taylor answered, “I\r\nwoulde you and your fellowes would turne to Christ; as for me I will not\r\nturn to Antichrist.” “Well,” quoth the bishop, “I am come to degrade\r\nyou, wherefore put on these vestures.” “No,” quoth doctor Taylor, “I\r\nwill not.” “Wilt thou not?” said the bishop. “I shall make thee, ere I\r\ngoe.” Quoth doctor Taylor, “You shall not, by the grace of God.” Then\r\nBonner caused another to put them on his back; and when thus arrayed,\r\nTaylor, walking up and down, said, “How say you, my lord, am I not a\r\ngoodly fool? How say you, my masters; if I were in Cheap, should I not\r\nhave boys enough to laugh at these apish toys, and toying trumpery?” The\r\nbishop proceeded, with certain ceremonies, to his purpose, till at the\r\nlast, when, according to the form, he should have struck Taylor on the\r\nbreast with his crosier, the bishop’s chaplain said, “My lord, strike\r\nhim not, for he will sore strike again.” Taylor favoured the chaplain’s\r\nsuspicion. “The cause,” said he, “is Christ’s; and I were no good\r\nchristian if I would not fight in my master’s quarrel.” It appears that\r\n“the bishop laid his curse upon him, but struck him not;” and after all\r\nwas over, when he got up stairs, “he told master Bradford (for both lay\r\nin one chamber) that he had made the bishop of London afraid; for, saith\r\nhe, laughingly, his chaplain gave him counsell not to strike with his\r\ncrosier-staff, for that I would strike again; and by my troth, said he,\r\nrubbing his hands, I made him believe I would doe so indeed.”\r\n\r\nThus was Taylor still cheerful from rectitude. In the afternoon his\r\nwife, his son, and John Hull his servant, were permitted to sup with\r\nhim. After supper, walking up and down, he impressively exhorted them,\r\nwith grave advice, to good conduct and reliance on Providence. “Then\r\nthey, with weeping tears, prayed together, and kissed one the other; and\r\nhe gave to his wife a book of the church service, set out by king\r\nEdward, which in the time of his imprisonment he daily used; and unto\r\nhis sonne Thomas he gave a latine booke, containing the notable sayings\r\nof the old martyrs, gathered out of _Ecclesiastica Historia_; and in the\r\nend of that booke he wrote his testament and last _vale_.” In this\r\n“vale,” dated the 5th of February, he says to his family, “I goe before,\r\nand you shall follow after, to our long home. I goe to the rest of my\r\nchildren. I have bequeathed you to the onely Omnipotent.” In the same\r\npaper he tells his “dear friends of Hadley, to remain in the light\r\nopened so plainely and simply, truly, throughly, and generally in all\r\nEngland,” for standing in which he was to die in flames.\r\n\r\nIn the morning at two o’clock, the sheriff of London with his officers\r\nbrought him, without light, from the counter to Aldgate. His wife,\r\nsuspecting that he would be carried away thus privately, had watched,\r\nfrom the time they had parted, within the porch of St. Botolph’s church,\r\nhaving her daughter Mary with her, and a little orphan girl named\r\nElizabeth, whom the honest martyr had reared from three years old to her\r\nthen age of thirteen: and when the sheriff and his company came nigh to\r\nwhere they stood, the child Elizabeth cried, “O my dear father! Mother,\r\nmother, here is my father led away.” The darkness being so great that\r\nthe one could not see the other, his wife cried, “Rowland, Rowland,\r\nwhere art thou?” Taylor answered, “Dear wife! I am here,” and he stayed;\r\nand the sheriff’s men would have forced him, but the sheriff said, “Stay\r\na little, my masters, I pray you, and let him speak to his wife.” Then\r\nhe took his daughter Mary in his arms, and he, and his wife, and the\r\norphan girl kneeled and prayed; and the sheriff, and many who were\r\npresent, wept; and he arose and kissed his wife, and shook her by the\r\nhand, and said, “Farewell, my dear wife, be of good comfort, for I am\r\nquiet in my conscience; God shall stir up a father for my children.” He\r\nhad three others, besides his daughter Mary and the young Elizabeth. He\r\nthen kissed Mary, and then Elizabeth, and he bade them, also, farewell\r\nand enjoined them to stand steadfast in their faith. His weeping wife\r\nsaid, “God be with thee, dear Rowland, I will, with God’s grace, meet\r\nthee at Hadleigh.” Then he was led on to the Woolsack inn, at Aldgate,\r\nwhere he was put in a chamber, under the custody of four yeomen of the\r\nguard and the sheriff’s men. Here his wife again desired to see him, but\r\nwas restrained by the sheriff, who otherwise treated her with kindness,\r\nand offered her his own house to abide in; but she preferred to go to\r\nher mother’s, whither two officers conducted her, charging her mother to\r\nkeep her within till their return.\r\n\r\nMeantime so soon as Taylor entered the chamber he prayed; and he\r\nremained at the inn until the sheriff of Essex was ready to receive him.\r\nAt eleven o’clock the inn gates were shut, and then he was put on\r\nhorseback within the gates. When they arrived outside, Taylor saw his\r\nson Thomas standing against the rails, in the care of his man John Hull;\r\nand he said, “Come hither, my son Thomas.” John Hull lifted the child\r\nup, and set him on the horse before his father; and Taylor put off his\r\nhat, and spoke a sentence or two to the people in behalf of matrimony,\r\nand then he lifted up his eyes and prayed for his son, and laid his hat\r\non the child’s head, and blessed him. This done he delivered the child\r\nto John Hull, whom he took by the hand, and he said to him, “Farewell,\r\nJohn Hull, the faithfullest servant that ever man had.” Having so said,\r\nhe rode forth with the sheriff of Essex and the yeomen of the guard to\r\ngo to his martyrdom in Suffolk.\r\n\r\nWhen they came near to Brentwood, one Arthur Taysie, who had been\r\nservant to Taylor, supposing him free, took him by the hand and said,\r\n“Master Doctor, I am glad to see you again at liberty;” but the sheriff\r\ndrove him back. At Brentwood, a close hood was put over Taylor’s face,\r\nwith holes for his eyes to look out at, and a slit for his mouth to\r\nbreathe through. These hoods were used at that place to be put on the\r\nmartyrs that they should not be known, and that they should not speak to\r\nany one, on the road to the burning-places.\r\n\r\nYet as they went, Taylor was so cheerful, and talked to the sheriff and\r\nhis guards in such wise, that they were amazed at his constancy. At\r\nChelmsford they met the sheriff of Suffolk, who was there to carry him\r\ninto his county. At that time he supped with the two sheriffs. The\r\nsheriff of Essex laboured during supper to persuade him to return to\r\nqueen Mary’s religion, telling him that all present would use their suit\r\nto the queen for his pardon, nor doubted they could obtain it. The\r\nsheriff reminded him, that he had been beloved for his virtues, and\r\nhonoured for his learning; that, in the course of nature, he was likely\r\nto live many years; and that he might even be higher esteemed than ever;\r\nwherefore he prayed him to be advised: “This counsel I give you,” said\r\nthe sheriff, “of a good heart and good will towards you;” and, thereupon\r\nhe drank to him; and the yeomen of the guard said, “In like manner,\r\nupon that condition, master Doctor, we all drink to you.” When they had\r\nso done, and the cup came to Taylor, he staid awhile, as studying what\r\nhe might say, and then answered thus: “Master sheriff, and my masters\r\nall, I heartily thank you for your good will. I have hearkened to your\r\nwords and marked well your counsels; and to be plain with you, I do\r\nperceive that I have been deceived myself, and am likely to deceive a\r\ngreat many of their expectation.” At these words they were exceedingly\r\nglad. “Would ye know my meaning plainly?” he said. “Yea, good master\r\nDoctor,” answered the sheriff, “tell it us plainly.” “Then,” said\r\nTaylor, “I will tell you:” and he said, that, as his body was of\r\nconsiderable bulk, and as he thought, if he had died in his bed, it\r\nwould have been buried in Hadleigh church-yard, so he had deceived\r\nhimself; and, as there were a great many worms there abiding, which\r\nwould have mealed handsomely upon him, so they, as well as himself, were\r\ndeceived; “for” said he, “it must be burnt to ashes, and they will\r\nthereby lose their feeding.” The sheriff and his company were thereupon\r\nastonished at him, as being a man without fear of death, and making a\r\njest of the flames. During their progress, many gentlemen and\r\nmagistrates were admitted to see him, and entreated him, in like manner,\r\nbut he remained immovable.\r\n\r\nThus they drew near to Hadleigh: and when they rode over Hadleigh\r\nbridge, a poor man with his five small children awaited their coming.\r\nWhen they saw Taylor, they all fell down on their knees and held up\r\ntheir hands, and cried aloud, “God help and succour thee, as thou hast\r\nmany a time succoured me and my poor children.” The streets of Hadleigh\r\nwere crowded on each side by men and women, of the town and country,\r\nsorely weeping, and with piteous voices loudly bewailing the loss of\r\ntheir pastor, praying that he might be strengthened and comforted in his\r\nextremity, and exclaiming, “What shall become of this wicked world!”\r\nTaylor said, “I have preached to you God’s word and truth, and am come\r\nto seal it with my blood.” When he came to the almshouses, he put some\r\nmoney, that had been bestowed on him during his imprisonment, into a\r\nglove, and this he is said to have given to the poor almsmen as they\r\nstood at their doors, to see their wonted benefactor pass. At the last\r\nof the almshouses he inquired, “Is the blind man, and blind woman, that\r\ndwelt here, alive?” He was answered, “Yes; they are there, within.” Then\r\nhe threw glove and all in at the window, and so rode forth towards the\r\nfield of his death.\r\n\r\nComing where a great multitude were assembled, he asked, “What place is\r\nthis, and what meaneth it that so much people are gathered hither?” It\r\nwas answered, “This is Aldham common, the place where you must suffer.”\r\nHe said, “Thanked be God, I am even at home.” Then he alighted from his\r\nhorse, and with both his hands rent the hood from his head. His hair was\r\nunseemly, for Bonner, when he degraded him, had caused it to be clipped\r\nin manner of a fool’s. At the sight of his ancient and reverend face,\r\nand his long white beard, the people burst into tears, and prayed for\r\nhim aloud. He would have spoken to them, but whenever he attempted, one\r\nor other of the yeomen of the guard thrust a tipstaff into his mouth.\r\n\r\nThen he desired licence to speak, of the sheriff; but the sheriff\r\nrefused him, and bade him remember his promise to the council: “Well,”\r\nquoth Taylor, “promise must be kept.” What the promise was is unknown.\r\nSeating himself on the ground he called to one in the crowd, “Soyce, I\r\npray thee come and pull off my boots, and take them for thy labour; thou\r\nhast long looked for them, now take them.” Then he arose, and putting\r\noff his underclothes, them also he bestowed. This done, he cried with a\r\nloud voice, “Good people! I have taught you nothing but God’s holy word,\r\nand those lessons that I have taken out of God’s blessed book, the Holy\r\nBible; and I am come hither this day to seal it with my blood.” One\r\nHolmes, a yeoman of the guard, who had used him cruelly all the way,\r\nthen struck him a violent blow on the head “with a waster,” and said,\r\n“Is that the keeping of thy promise, thou heretick?” Whereupon Taylor\r\nknelt on the earth and prayed, and a poor, but faithful woman, stepped\r\nfrom among the people to pray with him: the guards would fain have\r\nthrust her away, they threatened to tread her down with their horses,\r\nbut she was undismayed, and would not remove, but remained and prayed\r\nwith him. Having finished his devotions he went to the stake, and kissed\r\nit, and placed himself in a pitch-barrel which had been set for him to\r\nstand in; and he stood with his back upright against the stake, and he\r\nfolded his hands together, and he lifted his eyes towards heaven, and he\r\nprayed continually. Then they bound him with chains, and the sheriff\r\ncalled one Richard Donningham, a butcher, and commanded him to set up\r\nthe faggots, but he said, “I am lame, sir, and not able to lift a\r\nfaggot.” The sheriff threatened to send him to prison, but the man\r\nrefused to obey his command notwithstanding. Then the sheriff appointed\r\nto this labour one Mullcine of Carsey, “a man for his virtues fit to be\r\na hangman.” Soyce, a very drunkard, a man named Warwick, and one Robert\r\nKing, “a deviser of interludes.” These four set up the faggots, and\r\nprepared for making ready the fire, and Warwick cast a faggot at the\r\nmartyr, which lit upon his head and wounded his face, so that the blood\r\nran down. Taylor said, “O, friend! I have harm enough, what needed\r\nthat?” Then, while he repeated the psalm _Miserere_, in English, sir\r\nJohn Shelton struck him on the mouth: “You knave,” said he, “speak\r\nLatin; or I will make thee.” At last they set the faggots on fire, and\r\nTaylor, holding up both his hands, called on God, crying, “Merciful\r\nFather of Heaven! for Jesus Christ our saviour’s sake, receive my soul\r\ninto thy hands!” He stood, during his burning, without crying or moving,\r\ntill Soyce struck him on the head with a halberd, and the brains falling\r\nout, the corpse fell down into the fire.[60]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile some may deem this narrative of Rowland Taylor’s conduct too\r\ncircumstantial, others perhaps may not so deem. It is to be considered\r\nas exemplifying the manners of the period wherein the event occurred,\r\nand may at least be acceptable to many. It will assuredly be approved by\r\na few who regard inflexible adherence to principle, at the hazard of\r\ndeath itself, as preferable to a conscience-consuming subserviency,\r\nwhich, while it truckles to what the mind judges to be false, depraves\r\nthe heart, and saps the foundations of public virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·05.\r\n\r\n  [60] Acts and Monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 10.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biographical Notice._\r\n\r\n1818. On this day died in London, captain Thomas Morris, aged 74, a man\r\nof highly cultivated mind, who was born in its environs, and for whom\r\nwhen young a maternal uncle, of high military rank, procured an\r\nensigncy. He beat for recruits at Bridgewater, and enlisted the\r\naffections of a Miss Chubb of that town, whom he married. He was ordered\r\nwith his regiment to America, where he fought by the side of general\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\nCaptain Morris at one time was taken by the Indians, and condemned to\r\nthe stake; at the instant the women and children were preparing to\r\ninflict its tortures, he was recognised by an old sachem, whose life he\r\nhad formerly saved, and who in grateful return pleaded so powerfully in\r\nhis behalf, that he was unbound and permitted to return to his friends,\r\nwho had given him up for lost. He published an affecting narrative of\r\nhis captivity and sufferings; yet he was so attached to the Indian mode\r\nof life, that he used to declare they were the only human beings worthy\r\nof the name of MEN. On his return from America to England, he quitted\r\nthe army and gave himself to literary studies, and the conversation of a\r\nfew enlightened friends. In the midst of “the feast of reason, and the\r\nflow of soul,” he often sighed for the grand imagery of nature, the\r\ndashing cataracts of Columbia, the wild murmurs of rivers rolling\r\nthrough mountains, woods, and deserts. Having met with some\r\ndisappointments which baffled his philosophy, he sought a spot for\r\nretirement, and found it in a nursery garden, at Paddington. Here in a\r\nsmall cottage, he compared Pope’s translation of Homer with the\r\noriginal, in which he was assisted by Mr. George Dyer, a gentleman well\r\nqualified for so pleasing a task. In this pursuit he passed some years,\r\nwhich he declared were the happiest of his life.\r\n\r\nWith partiality for the dead languages, he was sensible to the vigour\r\nand copiousness of his own: he translated Juvenal into English, and\r\nenriched it with many notes, but it was never printed. He published a\r\nlittle poem, entitled “_Quashy_, or the Coal-black Maid,” a pathetic\r\nWest India story. He lived in the style of a gentleman, and left a\r\nhandsome sum to his children.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·92.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 11.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n1763.

Watching for a convenient opportunity, the door is slyly\r\nopened, and the valentine, attached to an apple or an orange, is thrown\r\nin; a loud rap at the door immediately follows, and the offender, taking\r\nto his heels, is off instantly. Those in the house, generally knowing\r\nfor what purpose the announcing rap was made, commence a search for the\r\njuvenile billet doux: in this manner, numbers are disposed of by each\r\nyouth. By way of teasing the person who attends the door, a white oblong\r\nsquare, the size of a letter, is usually chalked on the step of the\r\ndoor, and, should an attempt be made to pick it up, great amusement is\r\nthus afforded to some of the urchins, who are generally watching.\r\n\r\n  K.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·10.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 14.~\r\n\r\nOLD CANDLEMAS DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valentine._\r\n\r\nReferring to vol. i. from p. 215 to 230, for information concerning the\r\norigin of this festival of lovers, and the manner wherein it is\r\ncelebrated, a communication is subjoined concerning a custom now\r\nobserved in Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENTINE’S DAY AT LYNN.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nIndependent of the homage paid to St. Valentine on this day at Lynn,\r\n(Norfolk,) it is in other respects a red-letter day amongst all classes\r\nof its inhabitants, being the commencement of its great annual mart.\r\nThis mart was granted by a charter of Henry VIII., in the twenty-seventh\r\nyear of his reign, “to begin on the day next after the feast of the\r\npurification of the blessed virgin Mary, and to continue six days next\r\nfollowing,” (though now it is generally prolonged to a fortnight.) Since\r\nthe alteration of the style, in 1752, it has been proclaimed on\r\nValentine’s day. About noon, the mayor and corporation, preceded by a\r\nband of music, and attended by twelve decrepit old men, called from\r\ntheir dress “Red coats,” walk in procession to proclaim the mart,\r\nconcluding by opening the antiquated, and almost obsolete court of\r\n“Piepowder.” Like most establishments of this nature, it is no longer\r\nattended for the purpose it was first granted, business having yielded\r\nto pleasure and amusement. Formerly Lynn mart and Stourbridge\r\n(Stirbitch) fair,[61] were the only places where small traders in this\r\nand the adjoining counties, supplied themselves with their respective\r\ngoods. No transactions of this nature now take place, and the only\r\nremains to be perceived, are the “mart prices,” still issued by the\r\ngrocers. Here the thrifty housewives, for twenty miles round, laid in\r\ntheir annual store of soap, starch, &c., and the booth of “Green” from\r\nLimehouse, was for three generations the emporium of such articles; but\r\nthese no longer attend. A great deal of money is however spent, as\r\nimmense numbers of persons assemble from all parts. Neither is their any\r\nlack of incitements to unburthen the pockets: animals of every\r\ndescription, tame and wild, giants and dwarfs, tumblers, jugglers,\r\npeep-shows, &c., all unite their attractive powers, in sounds more\r\ndiscordant than those which annoyed the ears of Hogarth’s “enraged\r\nmusician.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1796 proved particularly unfortunate to some of the inhabitants\r\nof Marshland who visited the mart. On the evening of February 23, eleven\r\npersons, returning from the day’s visit, were drowned by the upsetting\r\nof a ferryboat; and on the preceding day a man from Tilney, going to see\r\nthe wild beasts, and putting his hand to the lion’s mouth, had his arm\r\ngreatly lacerated, and narrowly escaped being torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the last century, an old building, which, before\r\nthe reformation, had been a hall belonging to the guild of St. George,\r\nafter being applied to various uses, was fitted up as a theatre, (and by\r\na curious coincidence, where formerly had doubtless been exhibited, as\r\nwas customary at the guild feasts, religious mysteries and pageants of\r\nthe catholic age, again was exhibited the mysteries and pageants of the\r\nprotestant age,) during the mart and a few weeks afterwards; but with no\r\ngreat success, as appears by an anecdote related of the celebrated\r\nGeorge Alexander Stevens. Having in his youthful days performed here\r\nwith a strolling company, who shared amongst them the receipts of the\r\nhouse, after several nights’ performance to nearly empty benches, while\r\nperforming the part of Lorenzo, in Shakspeare’s “Merchant of Venice,” he\r\nthus facetiously parodied the speech of Lorenzo to Jessica, in the fifth\r\nact, as applicable to his distressed circumstances:\r\n\r\n    “Oh Jessica! in such a night as this we came to town,\r\n    And since that night we’ve shar’d but half a crown;\r\n    Let you and I then bid these folks good night,\r\n    For if we longer stay, they’ll starve us quite.”\r\n\r\nThis neglect of the drama is not, however, to be attributed to the\r\nvisitors or the inhabitants at the present day, a very elegant and\r\ncommodious theatre having been erected in 1814, at a considerable\r\nexpense, in another part of the town. But even here, a fatality attends\r\nour catholic ancestors, indicative of the instability of all sublunary\r\naffairs. The theatre has been erected on the site of the cloisters and\r\ncemetery of the grey friars’ monastery, the tall, slender tower of which\r\nis still standing near, and is the only one remaining out of ten\r\nmonasteries found in Lynn at the dissolution; where, but for the\r\nlustful rapacity of that tyrannical “defender of the faith,” Henry\r\nVIII., this sacred asylum of our departed ancestors would not have been\r\nprofaned, nor their mouldering particles disturbed, by a building as\r\nopposite to the one originally erected, as darkness is to light. Thus\r\ntime, instead of consecrating, so entirely obliterates our veneration\r\nfor the things of yesterday, that the reflecting mind cannot forbear to\r\nexclaim with the moralist of old,--“_Sic transit gloria mundi._”\r\n\r\n  K.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~David Love, of Nottingham,~\r\n\r\nAged 74, A. D. 1824.]\r\n\r\n    “Here’s David’s likeness for his book,\r\n    All those who buy may at it look,\r\n    As he is in his present state,\r\n    Now printed from a copper-plate.”\r\n\r\nThese lines are beneath the portrait from whence the above engraving is\r\ntaken. It is a very faithful likeness of David Love, only a little too\r\nerect:--not quite enough of the stoop of the old man of 76 in it,--but\r\nit is a face and a figure which will be recognised by thousands in\r\nNottingham and Nottinghamshire. The race of the old minstrels has been\r\nlong extinct;--that of the ballad-singers is fast following it--yet\r\nDavid is both one and the other. He is a bard and a caroller,--a wight\r\nwho has wandered over as many hills and dales as any of the minstrels\r\nand troubadours of old;--a man who has sung, when he had cause enough\r\nfor crying--who has seen many ups and downs, and has seldom failed to\r\nput his trials and hardships into rhyme. He is the poet of poverty and\r\npatience--teaching experience. He has seen the\r\n\r\n    “huts where poor men lie”\r\n\r\nall his life; yet he has never ceased to chant as he proceeded on his\r\npainful pilgrimage, like the “nightingale with a thorn in her breast.”\r\nIt is true, he does not carry his harp to accompany his strains, but he\r\ncarries his life, “The Life, Adventures, and Experience of David Love,\r\nwritten by Himself. Fifth edition:” and well doth it deserve both its\r\ntitle and sale. A curious, eventful story of a poor man’s it is. First\r\nhe is a poor parent-deserted lad; then he has wormed himself into good\r\nservice, and afterwards into a coal-pit, where he breaks his bones and\r\nalmost crushes out life; then he is a traveller, a shopkeeper, a soldier\r\nfighting against the Highland rebels; he falls in love, gets into\r\nwedlock and a workhouse, is never in despair, and never out of trouble;\r\nwith a heart so buoyant, that, like a cork on a boisterous flood,\r\nhowever he might be plunged into the depths, he is sure to rise again to\r\nthe surface, and in all places and cases still pours out his\r\nrhymes--pictures of scenes around him, strange cabins and strange\r\ngroups, love verses, acrostics, hymns, &c.\r\n\r\n    “I have composed many rhymes,\r\n    On various subjects, and the times,\r\n    And call’d the trials of prisoners’ crimes\r\n                       The cash to bring;\r\n    When old I grew, composed hymns,\r\n                       And them did sing.”\r\n\r\nSo David sped, and so he speeds now in his 77th year, only that his\r\ntravels have left him finally fixed at Nottingham. His wars and his\r\nloves have vanished; his circle of action has annually become more and\r\nmore contracted; till, at length, the town includes the whole field of\r\nhis perambulations, and even that is almost more than his tottering\r\nframe can traverse. Yet there he is! and the stranger who visits\r\nNottingham will be almost sure to see him, as represented in the print,\r\ncrossing the market-place, with a parcel of loose papers in his hand;--a\r\nrhyming account of the last Goose Fair, a flood, an execution, or _one_\r\nof David’s own marriages,--for be it known to thee, gentle reader, that\r\nDavid _Love_ has been a true son of the family of the _Loves_. He has\r\nnot sung his amatory lays for naught; he has captivated the hearts of\r\nno less than three damsels, and he has various and memorable experience\r\nin wives.\r\n\r\nDavid, like many of our modern geniuses, is a Scotchman. He tells us\r\nthat he was born near Edinburgh, but the precise place he affects not to\r\nknow. The fact is, he is not very strong in his faith that, as he has\r\ntasted the sweets of a parish, he cannot be removed, and thinks it best\r\nto keep his birth-place secret: but the spot is Torriburn, on the Forth,\r\nthe Scotch Highgate. David “has been to mair toons na Torriburn,” as the\r\nScotch say, when they intimate that they are not to be gulled.\r\n\r\nAfter sustaining many characters in the drama of life whilst yet very\r\nyoung, a schoolmaster among the rest, he fairly flung himself and his\r\ngenius upon the world, and rambled from place to place in Scotland,\r\ncalling around him all the young ears and love-darting eyes by his\r\noriginal ballads. It was a dangerous life, and David did not escape\r\nscatheless.\r\n\r\n    “At length so very bold I grew,\r\n    My songs exposed to public view,\r\n    And crowds of people round me drew,\r\n                   _I was so funny_;\r\n    From side to side I nimbly flew\r\n                   To catch the money.”\r\n\r\nAnd he caught not only money, but matrimony,--and such a wife! alas! for\r\npoor David!\r\n\r\n    “As she always will rule the roast,\r\n    I’d better be tied to a post,\r\n                      And whipped to death,\r\n    Than with her tongue to be so tossed,\r\n                      And bear her wrath.\r\n    She called me both rogue and fool,\r\n    And over me she strove to rule;\r\n    I sat on the repenting stool--\r\n                      There tears I shed;\r\n    Sad my complaint, I said, O dool!\r\n                      That e’er I wed.”\r\n\r\nThe next step evidently enough was enlisting, which he did into the duke\r\nof Buccleugh’s regiment; where, he says, he distinguished himself by\r\nwriting a song in compliment of the regiment and its noble commander,\r\nconcluding with,\r\n\r\n    “Now, at the last, what do you think\r\n    Of the author, David Love?”\r\n\r\nAnd whenever the duke and the officers saw him, they were sure to point,\r\nand say, “What do you think of the author, David Love?” These seem to\r\nhave been David’s golden days. Not only--\r\n\r\n    “One hand the pen, and one the sword did wield,”\r\n\r\nbut he was also an actor of plays for the amusement of the officers.\r\nHowever, his discharge came, and adventures crowded thickly upon him. He\r\ntraversed England in all directions, married a second and a third time,\r\nfigured away in London and Edinburgh, and finally in Nottingham, with\r\nballads and rhymes of his own composing; saw the inside of a prison, was\r\nall but hanged for his suspicious and nomadic poverty, and after all, by\r\nhis own showing, is now to be classed with the most favoured of\r\nmortals:--\r\n\r\n“I am now 76 years of age, and I both see and hear as well as I did\r\nthirty years ago. My wife is aged about fifty, and has been the space of\r\na year in tolerable health. She works hard at her silk-wheel, to assist\r\nme; is an excellent housewife; gossips none: cleanly in cooking, famous\r\nat washing, good at sewing, marking, and mending her own and children’s\r\nclothes. For making markets none can equal her. Consults me in every\r\nthing, to find if I think it right, before she proceeds to buy\r\nprovisions, or clothes; strives to please me in every thing; and always\r\nstudies my welfare, rejoicing when I am in health, grieved when I am\r\npained or uneasy. She is my tender nurse to nourish me, my skilful\r\ndoctress to administer relief when I am in sickness or in pain; in\r\nshort, a better wife a poor man never had.”\r\n\r\nTruly, David, I think so too! A happy man art thou to be possessed of\r\nsuch an incomparable helpmate; and still happier that, unlike many a\r\nprouder bard, thou art sensible of thy blessings.\r\n\r\nTo show that although our minstrel often invokes the muse to paltry\r\nsubjects for paltry gains, yet he can sometimes soar into a higher\r\nregion, I give the following:--\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD’S DREAM.\r\n\r\n_The substance thereof being founded on fact_\r\n\r\n    I’ll tell you who I saw last night,\r\n      As I lay sleeping on my bed;\r\n    A shining creature all in light,\r\n      To me she seemed a heavenly maid.\r\n\r\n    I meet her tripping o’er the dew,\r\n      Fine as a queen of May, mamma;\r\n    She saw, she smiled, she to me flew,\r\n      And bade me come away, mamma.\r\n\r\n    I looked, I loved, I blushed awhile,\r\n      Oh! how could I say no, mamma?\r\n    She spoke so sweet, so sweet did smile,\r\n      I was obliged to go, mamma.\r\n\r\n    For love my tender heart beguiled,\r\n      I felt unusual flames, mamma;\r\n    My inward fancy turned so wild,\r\n      So very strange my dream, mamma.\r\n\r\n    Indeed I was, I know not how,\r\n      Oh had you only been with me;\r\n    Such wonders opened to my view,\r\n      As few but holy angels see.\r\n\r\n    Methought we wandered in a grove,\r\n      All green with pleasant fields, mamma;\r\n    In joyful measures on we move,\r\n      As music rapture yields, mamma.\r\n\r\n    She took me in her snow-white hand,\r\n      Then led me through the air, mamma.\r\n    Far higher above sea and land,\r\n      Than ever eagles were, mamma.\r\n\r\n    The sea and land, with all their store,\r\n      Of rivers, woods, and lofty hills,\r\n    Indeed they did appear no more\r\n      Than little streams or purling rills.\r\n\r\n    I sought my dear papa’s estate,\r\n      But found it not at all, mamma;\r\n    The world in whole seemed not so great\r\n      As half a cannon-ball, mamma.\r\n\r\n    We saw the sun but like a star,\r\n      The moon was like a mustard seed;\r\n    Like Elias in his fiery car,\r\n      All glorious winged with light’ning speed.\r\n\r\n    Swift as our thoughts, oh joyful day.\r\n      We glanced through all the boundless spheres;\r\n    Their music sounding all the way,\r\n      Heaven sweetly rushing in our ears,\r\n\r\n    Now opens, and all we saw before\r\n      Were lost entirely to our view;\r\n    The former things are now no more,\r\n      To us all things appeared new.\r\n\r\n    No death is there, nor sorrow there,\r\n      E’er to disturb the heavenly bliss,\r\n    For death, sin, hell, and sorrow are,\r\n      Entirely lost in the abyss.\r\n\r\n    With wintry storms the ground ne’er pines\r\n      Clothed in eternal bloom, mamma;\r\n    For there the sun of glory shines,\r\n      And all the just with him, mamma.\r\n\r\n    I saw my sister Anna there,\r\n      A virgin in her youthful prime;\r\n    More than on earth her features fair,\r\n      And like the holy angels’ fine.\r\n\r\n    _Her robe was all a flowing stream\r\n      Of silver dipt in light_, mamma,\r\n    But ah! it ’woke me from my dream,\r\n      It shone so strong and bright, mamma.\r\n\r\nWith this specimen of David’s poetical faculties, I leave him to the\r\nkind consideration of the well disposed.\r\n\r\n  _January, 1826._\r\n\r\n  M.

During the debate,\r\nthat river overflowed its banks by reason of a strong spring tide; the\r\nwater was higher than ever known before, and rose above two feet in\r\nWestminster-hall, where the courts being sitting, the judges, &c. were\r\nobliged to be carried out. The water came into all the cellars and\r\nground rooms near the river on both sides, and flowed through the\r\nstreets of Wapping and Southwark, as its proper channel; a general\r\ninundation covered all the marshes and lowlands in Kent, Essex, Suffolk,\r\nNorfolk, and Lincolnshire, and some thousands of cattle were destroyed,\r\nwith several of their owners in endeavouring to save them. The tide\r\nbeing brought in by a strong wind at N. W. was the highest in\r\nLincolnshire of any for 135 years past. Seventeen breaches were made,\r\nabout sunrise, in the banks of the river between Spalding and Wisbech,\r\nwith several between Wisbech and Lynn, and irreparable damage done; some\r\ngraziers having lost all their cattle.

These sittings are\r\ncalled the “sittings after term,” and during these periods, suits,\r\narising out of clashing claims of important interests, are usually\r\ndecided by the verdicts of special juries, and other litigations are\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe origin and progress of every possible action, in a court of law, are\r\nsuccinctly portrayed by “the Tree of Common Law”--an engraving in vol.\r\ni. p. 234.

After\r\nproceeding so far, it will be requisite to pause, and then, as paramount\r\nto the legal advice, common sense should weigh consequences well, before\r\ngiving “instructions to sue,” or “defend,” in\r\n\r\n      ---------- that wide and pathless maze\r\n    Where law and custom, truth and fiction,\r\n    Craft, justice, strife, and contradiction,\r\n    With every blessing of confusion,\r\n    Quirk, error, quibble, and delusion,\r\n    Are all, if rightly understood,\r\n    Like jarring ministers of state,\r\n    ’Mid anger, jealousy, and hate,\r\n    In friendly coalition joined,\r\n    To harmonize and bless mankind.\r\n\r\nTo some “whimsical miscellanies,” subjoined at the place aforesaid, can\r\nbe added or annexed, more or many others, of the same or the like kind.\r\nThe realities of law may be relieved by the pleasures of imagination,\r\nand the heaviness of the “present sittings” be enlivened by a _reported_\r\ncase, in the words of the reporter, (_Stevens’s Lect._) premising,\r\nhowever, that he first publicly stated, with his head in his wig, and\r\nwith a nosegay in his hand,\r\n\r\n“Law is--law,--law is law, and as, in such and so forth, and hereby, and\r\naforesaid, provided always, nevertheless, notwithstanding. Law is like a\r\ncountry dance, people are led up and down in it till they are tired. Law\r\nis like a book of surgery, there are a great many terrible cases in it.\r\nIt is also like physic, they that take least of it are best off.

Farmer A was seized or\r\npossessed of a bull; farmer B was seized or possessed of a ferry-boat.\r\nNow the owner of the ferry-boat, having made his boat fast to a post on\r\nshore, with a piece of hay, twisted rope fashion, or as we say, _vulgo\r\nvocato_, a hay-band. After he had made his boat fast to a post on shore,\r\nas it was very natural for a hungry man to do, he went _up town_ to\r\ndinner; farmer A’s bull, as it was very natural for a hungry bull to do,\r\ncame _down town_ to look for a dinner; and the bull observing,\r\ndiscovering, seeing, and spying out, some turnips in the bottom of the\r\nferry-boat the bull scrambled into the ferry-boat--he eat up the\r\nturnips, and to make an end of his meal, he fell to work upon the\r\nhay-band. The boat being eaten from its moorings, floated down the\r\nriver, with the bull in it: it struck against a rock--beat a hole in the\r\nbottom of the boat, and tossed the bull overboard. Thereupon the owner\r\nof the bull brought his action against the boat, for running away with\r\nthe bull, and the owner of the boat brought his action against the bull\r\nfor running away with the boat.\r\n\r\nAt trial of these causes, Bullum _v._ Boatum, Boatum _v._ Bullum, the\r\ncounsel for the bull began with saying,\r\n\r\n“_My lord_, and you, _gentlemen of the jury_,\r\n\r\n“We are counsel in this cause for the bull. We are indicted for running\r\naway with the boat. Now, my lord, we have heard of running horses, but\r\nnever of running bulls before. Now, my lord, the bull could no more run\r\naway with the boat than a man in a coach may be said to run away with\r\nthe horses; therefore, my lord, how can we punish what is not\r\npunishable? How can we eat what is not eatable? Or how can we drink what\r\nis not drinkable? Or, as the law says, how can we think on what is not\r\nthinkable? Therefore, my lord, as we are counsel in this cause for the\r\nbull, if the jury should bring the bull in guilty, the jury would be\r\nguilty of a bull.”\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the boat affirmed, that the bull should be nonsuited,\r\nbecause the declaration did not specify of what colour he was; for thus\r\nwisely, and thus learnedly spoke the counsel: “My lord, if the bull was\r\nof no colour, he must be of some colour; and if he was not of any\r\ncolour, of what colour could the bull be?” I overruled this objection\r\nmyself (says the reporter) by observing the bull was a white bull, and\r\nthat white is no colour: besides, as I told my brethren, they should not\r\ntrouble their heads to talk of colour in the law, for the law can colour\r\nany thing. The causes went to reference, and by the award, both bull\r\nand boat were acquitted, it being proved that the tide of the river\r\ncarried them both away. According to the legal maxim, there cannot be a\r\nwrong without a remedy; I therefore advised a fresh case to be laid\r\nbefore me, and was of opinion, that as the tide of the river carried\r\nboth bull and boat away, both bull and boat had a right of action\r\nagainst the water-bailiff.\r\n\r\nUpon this opinion an action was commenced, and this point of law arose,\r\nhow, whether, when, and whereby, or by whom, the facts could be proved\r\non oath, as the boat was not _compos mentis_. The evidence point was\r\nsettled by Boatum’s attorney, who declared that for his client he would\r\nswear any thing.\r\n\r\nAt the trial, the water-bailiff’s charter was read, from the original\r\nrecord in true law Latin, to support an averment in the declaration that\r\nthe plaintiffs were carried away either by the tide of flood, or the\r\ntide of ebb. The water-bailiffs charter stated of him and of the river,\r\nwhereof or wherein he thereby claimed jurisdiction, as follows:--_Aquæ\r\nbailiffi est magistratus in choisi, sapor omnibus, fishibus, qui\r\nhabuerunt finnos et scalos, claws, shells, et talos, qui swimmare in\r\nfreshibus, vel saltibus, riveris, lakos, pondis, canalibus et well\r\nboats, sive oysteri, prawni, whitini, shrimpi, turbutus solus_; that is,\r\n_not turbots alone, but turbots and soals_ both together. Hereupon arose\r\na nicety of law; for the law is as nice as a new-laid egg, and not to be\r\nunderstood by addle-headed people. Bullum and Boatum mentioned both ebb\r\nand flood, to avoid quibbling; but it being proved, that they were\r\ncarried away neither by the tide of flood, nor by the tide of ebb, but\r\nexactly upon the top of high water, they were nonsuited; and thereupon,\r\nupon their paying all costs, they were allowed, by the court, to begin\r\nagain, _de novo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·82.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 18.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Revivification of Trees._\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Aikin, in his “Natural History of the Year,” narrates the\r\nfirst vital function in trees on the conclusion of winter. This is the\r\n_ascent of the sap_ after the frost is moderated, and the earth\r\nsufficiently thawed. The absorbent vessels composing the _inner bark_\r\nreach to the extremity of the fibres of the roots, and thus, through\r\nthe roots, imbibe water, which, mixing there with a quantity of\r\nsaccharine matter, forms _sap_, and is from thence abundantly\r\ndistributed through the trunk and branches to every individual bud. The\r\nbirch tree in spring, on being tapped, yields its sap, which is\r\nfermented into wine. The palm tree in the tropics of the same season\r\nyields its sap by the same method, which is made into palm wine, and the\r\nsap of the sugar maple in North America being boiled, yields the maple\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n“This great accession of nourishment (the _sap_) causes the bud to\r\nswell, to break through its covering, and to spread into blossoms, or\r\nlengthen into a shoot bearing leaves. This is the _first_ process, and,\r\nproperly speaking, is all that belongs to the _springing_ or\r\n_elongation_ of trees; and in many plants, that is, all those which are\r\nannual or deciduous, there is no other process; the plant absorbs juices\r\nfrom the earth, and in proportion to the quantity of these juices\r\nincreases in size: it expands its blossoms, perfects its fruit, and when\r\nthe ground is incapable by drought or frost of yielding any more\r\nmoisture, or when the vessels of the plant are not able to draw it up,\r\nthe plant perishes. But in _trees_, though the beginning and end of the\r\nfirst process is exactly similar to what takes places in vegetables, yet\r\nthere is a second process, which at the same time that it adds to their\r\nbulk, enables them to endure and go on increasing through a long series\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n“The _second_ process begins soon after the first, in this way. At the\r\nbase of the footstalk of each leaf a small bud is gradually formed; but\r\nthe absorbent vessels of the leaf having exhausted themselves in the\r\nformation of the bud, are unable to bring it nearer to maturity: in this\r\nstate it exactly resembles a seed, containing within it the rudiments of\r\nvegetation, but destitute of absorbent vessels to nourish and evolve the\r\nembryo. Being surrounded, however, by sap, like a seed in moist earth,\r\nit is in a proper situation for growing; the influence of the sun sets\r\nin motion the juices of the bud and of the seed, and the first operation\r\nin both of them is to send down roots a certain depth into the ground\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining the necessary moisture. The bud accordingly\r\nshoots down its roots upon the inner bark of the tree, till they reach\r\nthe part covered by the earth. Winter now arriving, the cold and defect\r\nof moisture, owing to the clogged condition of the absorbent vessels,\r\ncause the fruit and leaves to fall, so that, except the provision of\r\nbuds with roots, the remainder of the tree, like an annual plant, is\r\nentirely dead: the leaves, the flowers, and fruit are gone, and what was\r\nthe inner bark, is no longer organized, while the roots of the buds form\r\na new inner bark; and thus the buds with their roots contain all that\r\nremains alive of the whole tree. It is owing to this annual renovation\r\nof the _inner bark_, that the tree increases in bulk; and a new coating\r\nbeing added every year, we are hence furnished with an easy and exact\r\nmethod of ascertaining the age of a tree by counting the number of\r\nconcentric circles of which the trunk is composed. A tree, therefore,\r\nproperly speaking, is rather a congeries of a multitude of annual\r\nplants, than a perennial individual.\r\n\r\n“The sap in trees always rises as soon as the frost is abated, that when\r\nthe stimulus of the warm weather in the early spring acts upon the bud,\r\nthere should be at hand a supply of food for its nourishment; and if by\r\nany means the sap is prevented from ascending at the proper time, the\r\ntree infallibly perishes. Of this a remarkable instance occurred in\r\nLondon, during the spring succeeding the hard winter of the year 1794.\r\nThe snow and ice collecting in the streets so as to become very\r\ninconvenient, they were cleared, and many cartloads were placed in the\r\nvacant quarters of _Moorfields_; several of these heaps of snow and\r\nfrozen rubbish were piled round some of the elm-trees that grow there.\r\nAt the return of spring, those of the trees that were not surrounded\r\nwith the snow expanded their leaves as usual, while the others, being\r\nstill girt with a large frozen mass, continued quite bare; for the fact\r\nwas, the absorbents in the lower part of the stem, and the earth in\r\nwhich the trees stood, were still exposed to a freezing cold. In some\r\nweeks, however, the snow was thawed, but the greater number of the trees\r\nwere dead, and those few that did produce any leaves were very sickly,\r\nand continued in a languishing state all summer, and then died.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·92.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 19.~\r\n\r\n1826.--_Second Sunday in Lent._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Bird’s Nest in Spring._\r\n\r\nOf all our native birds, none begins to build so soon as the raven: by\r\nthe latter end of this month it has generally laid its eggs and begun to\r\nsit. The following anecdote, illustrative of its attachment to its nest,\r\nis related by Mr. White in his “Natural History of Selborne.” “In the\r\ncentre of this grove there stood an oak, which, though shapely and tall\r\non the whole, bulged out into a large excrescence about the middle of\r\nthe stem. On this a pair of ravens had fixed their residence for such a\r\nseries of years, that the oak was distinguished by the name of the\r\n_raven-tree_. Many were the attempts of the neighbouring youths to get\r\nat this eyry; the difficulty whetted their inclinations, and each was\r\nambitious of surmounting the arduous task. But when they arrived at the\r\nswelling, it jutted out so much in their way, and was so far beyond\r\ntheir grasp, that the most daring lads were awed, and acknowledged the\r\nundertaking to be too hazardous. So the ravens built on, nest upon nest,\r\nin perfect security, till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to\r\nbe levelled. It was in the month of _February_, when those birds usually\r\nsit. The saw was applied to the butt, the wedges were inserted into the\r\nopening, the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle and mallet,\r\nthe tree nodded to its fall, but still the dam sat on. At last, when it\r\ngave way, the bird was flung from her nest; and though her parental\r\naffection deserved a better fate, was whipped down by the twigs, which\r\nbrought her dead to the ground.”[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·37.\r\n\r\n  [65] Aikin’s Nat.

Ballad._\r\n\r\nMr. Crofton Croker’s “Researches in the South of Ireland,” besides\r\naccounts of scenery and architectural remains, and illustrations of\r\npopular manners and superstition, conveys a very good idea of the roads\r\nand the methods of travelling in that part of the sister kingdom. The\r\nusual conveyance is called a car; its wheels are either a solid block\r\nrounded to the desired size, or they are formed of three pieces of wood\r\nclamped together. The wheels are fixed to a massive wooden axletree;\r\nthis supports the shafts, which are as commonly constructed on the\r\noutside as on the inside of the wheels. In one of these machines Mr.\r\nCroker, with a lady and gentleman who accompanied him on his tour, took\r\ntheir seats. The car and horse were precisely of that description and\r\ncondition in the engraving. Mr. W. H. Brooke painted a picture of this\r\ngentleman’s party, from whence he has obligingly made the drawing for\r\nthe present purpose; the only alteration is in the travellers, for whom\r\nhe has substituted a family on their removal from one cabin to another.\r\n\r\nThis, which is the common Irish car, is used throughout the province of\r\nLeinster, the midland counties, and some parts of the north. The\r\ncountry, or farmer’s car always has the wheels on the outside of the\r\nshafts, with a balustrade or upright railing fixed from the shaft to the\r\nside bars, which rise diagonally from them; this sort of enclosure is\r\nalso at the back. This car is open at top for the convenience of\r\ncarrying hay, corn, vegetables, tubs, packages, and turf, which is\r\ngenerally placed in wicker baskets, called a “kish;” two or four of\r\nthese placed side by side occupy the entire body. The car, with the\r\nwheels between the shafts, is used for like purposes, but has the\r\nadditional honour of being rendered a family conveyance, by cart ropes\r\nintertwisted or crossing each other from the top bars, whereon a\r\nticking, stuffed with straw, and a quilt or coverlid, form a cushion for\r\nthe comfort of the travellers. The car is the common, and indeed the\r\nonly, mode of carrying coals in the city of Dublin to the houses of the\r\nconsumers: from six to nine sacks, making about half a ton, lie very\r\nsnugly across the bars. Of course, as a family conveyance, it is only in\r\nuse among the poorest class in the country.\r\n\r\nThe common car somewhat varies in shape, as will appear from the\r\nfollowing figure, also drawn by Mr. Brooke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt must be added, that though these cars maintain their ground in\r\nuncultivated districts, they are quickly disappearing, in the improved\r\nparts of Ireland, before the Scotch carts introduced by the agricultural\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nThe Irish “jaunting-car,” the “jingle,” the “noddy,” and a variety of\r\nother carriages, which ply for hire in Dublin, are wholly distinct and\r\nsuperior vehicles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following interesting narrative, in the words of its author,\r\nillustrates the nature of the car, the state of the roads, and the\r\n“manners” of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nA JAUNT IN A COUNTRY CAR\r\n\r\n_From Lismore to Fermoy_\r\n\r\nBY T. CROFTON CROKER, ESQ.\r\n\r\nHaving hired a car at Lismore to take us to Fermoy, and wishing to walk\r\npart of the way along the banks of the Blackwater, we desired the driver\r\nto meet us at a given point. On arriving there, the man pretended not to\r\nhave understood we were three in party, and demanded, in consequence, an\r\nexorbitant addition to the sum agreed on. Although we were without any\r\nother means of conveyance for eight Irish miles, it was resolved not to\r\nsubmit to this imposition, and we accordingly withdrew our luggage and\r\ndismissed the car, intending to seek another amongst a few cabins that\r\nappeared at a little distance from the road side. A high dispute ensued\r\nwith the driver, who, of course, was incensed at this proceeding, and\r\nendeavoured to enlist in his cause the few straggling peasants that had\r\ncollected around us; but having taken refuge and placed our trunks in\r\nthe nearest cabin, ourselves and property became sacred, and the\r\ndisposition to hostility, which had been at first partially expressed,\r\ngradually died away. When we began to make inquiries for a horse and car\r\nof any kind to take us into Fermoy, our endeavours were for some time\r\nfruitless. One person had a car, but no horse. Another had a car\r\n_building_, which, if Dermot Leary were as good as his word, would be\r\nfinished next week some time, “God willing.” At length we gained\r\nintelligence of a horse that was “only two miles off, drawing turf: sure\r\nhe could be fetched in less than no time.” But then again, “that big car\r\nof Thaddy Connor’s was too great a load for him entirely. Sure the\r\n_baste_ would never draw the _car_ into Fermoy, let alone their honours\r\nand the trunks.” After some further consultation, a car was discovered\r\nmore adapted to the capabilities of the miserable animal thus called\r\nupon to “leave work and carry wood,” and though of the commonest kind we\r\nwere glad to secure it. By means of our trunks and some straw we formed\r\na kind of lodgment on the car, which, being without springs and on the\r\nworst possible of roads, was not exactly a bed of down. The severe\r\ncontusions we received on precipitating into the numerous cavities,\r\nthough no joke, caused some laughter; on which the driver turned round\r\nwith a most facetious expression of countenance, suggesting that “May be\r\nthe motion did not just agree with the lady, but never fear, she would\r\nsoon get used to it, and be asleep before we got half way to Fermoy.”\r\nThis prediction, it will readily be supposed, was not fulfilled; and I\r\nbelieve it was three days before we recovered from the bruises of that\r\njourney. It is difficulty to say whether our situation will excite mirth\r\nor sympathy in the minds of our readers, but a sketch may do no injury\r\nto the description. [In Mr. Croker’s volume an engraving on wood is\r\ninserted.]\r\n\r\nMany Irish villages boast a post-chaise, the horses for which are not\r\nunfrequently taken from the plough, and the chaise itself submitted to a\r\ntemporary repair before starting, to render it, if the parody of a\r\nnautical phrase may be allowed, “road-worthy;” but the defects are never\r\nthought of one moment before the chaise is required; and the miseries of\r\nposting in Ireland have, with justice, afforded subject for the\r\ncaricaturist. Tired horses or a break-down are treated by a driver,\r\nwhose appearance is the very reverse of the smart jockey-like costume of\r\nan English postilion, with the utmost resignation, as matters of\r\nunavoidable necessity. With a slouched hat--slovenly shoes and\r\nstockings--and a long, loose great coat wrapped round him, he sits upon\r\na bar in front of the carriage and urges on his horses by repeated\r\napplications of the whip, accompanied with the most singular speeches,\r\nand varied by an involuntary burst of his musical talent, whistling a\r\ntune adapted to the melancholy pace of the fatigued animals, as he walks\r\nslowly beside them up the ascent of every hill.\r\n\r\n“Did you give the horses a feed of oats at the village where we stopped\r\nto sketch?” inquired one of my fellow-travellers of the driver, who for\r\nthe last three or four miles had with much exertion urged on the jaded\r\nhacks.\r\n\r\n“I did not, your honour,” was the reply, “but sure, and they know I\r\npromised them a good one at Limerick.”\r\n\r\nNor is this instance of pretended understanding between man and horse\r\nsingular. Riding once in company with a poor farmer from Cork to Mallow,\r\nI advised him to quicken the pace of his steed as the evening was\r\nclosing in, and the lurid appearance of the sky foreboded a storm.\r\n\r\n“Sure then that I would with the greatest pleasure in life for the\r\nhonour I have out of your company, sir; but I promised the _baste_ to\r\nlet him walk, and I never belie myself to any one, much less to a poor\r\ncreature that carries me--for, says the _baste_ to me, I’m tired, as\r\ngood right I have, and I’ll not go a step faster--and you won’t make\r\nme--I scorn it says I, so take your own way.”\r\n\r\nA verbatim dialogue on an Irish break-down happily characterises that\r\naccident: the scene, a bleak mountain, and the time, the return of the\r\ndriver with another chaise from the nearest station which afforded\r\none--seven miles distant.\r\n\r\n“Is the carriage you have brought us safe?”\r\n\r\n(One of the travellers attempts to get in.)\r\n\r\n“Oh never fear, sir; wait till I just bail out the water and put a\r\nlittle sop of hay in the bottom--and sure now and ’tis a queer thing\r\nthat the _ould_ black chaise should play such a trick, and it has gone\r\nthis road eleven years and never broke down _afore_. But no wonder poor\r\n_cratur_, the turnpike people get money enough for mending the roads,\r\nand bad luck to the bit of it they mend, but put it all in their\r\npockets.”\r\n\r\n“What, the road?”\r\n\r\n“_Noe_, your honour, the money.”\r\n\r\nTo such as can bear with composure and indifference lesser and temporary\r\nmisfortunes, those attendant on an Irish tour become objects of\r\nmerriment; the very essence of the innate ingenuity and wit of the\r\npeople is called out by such evils; and the customary benediction\r\nmuttered by the peasant on the meeting a traveller, is changed into the\r\nwhimsical remark or shrewd reply that mock anticipation.\r\n\r\nOf late, jingles, as they are termed, have been established between the\r\nprincipal towns. These are carriages on easy springs, calculated to\r\ncontain six or eight persons. The roof is supported by a slight iron\r\nframe capable of being unfixed in fine weather, and the curtains, which\r\nmay be opened and closed at will, afford complete protection from sun\r\nand rain; their rate of travelling is nearly the same as that of the\r\nstage-coach, and they are both a cheaper and more agreeable conveyance.\r\n\r\nOn our way from Cork to Youghall in one of these machines, we were\r\nfollowed by a poor wretch ejaculating the most dreadful oaths and\r\nimprecations in Irish. His head was of an uncommonly large and stupid\r\nshape, and his idiotic countenance was rendered fierce and wild by a\r\nlong and bushy red beard. On our driver giving him a piece of bread,\r\nfor which he had run beside the jingle at least half a mile, he uttered\r\nthree or four terrific screams, accompanied by some antic and spiteful\r\ngestures. I should not remark this circumstance here were it one of less\r\nfrequent occurrence; but on most of the public roads in the south of\r\nIreland, fools and idiots (melancholy spectacles of humanity!) are\r\npermitted to wander at large, and in consequence of this freedom have\r\nacquired vicious habits, to the annoyance of every passenger: throwing\r\nstones, which they do with great dexterity, is amongst the most\r\ndangerous of their practices, and a case is known to me where the wife\r\nof a respectable farmer, having been struck on the temple by a stone\r\nthrown at her by an idiot, died a few days after. Within my\r\nrecollection, Cove-lane, one of the most frequented parts of Cork, as\r\nleading to the Cove-passage, Carrigaline and Monkstown roads, was the\r\nstation of one of these idiots, who seldom allowed an unprotected woman\r\nto pass without following her, and inflicting the most severe pinches on\r\nher back and arms; yet this unfortunate and mischievous being for many\r\nyears was suffered by the civil power to remain the terror of every\r\nfemale, and that too within view of a public asylum for the reception of\r\nsuch. But to return from this digression.\r\n\r\nThe charges at inferior towns and villages are extravagant in an inverse\r\nproportion to the indifference of their accommodation, and generally\r\nexceed those of the first hotels in the metropolis. Our bill at\r\nKilmallock was any thing but moderate, and yet the house, though the\r\nbest the town afforded, appeared to be one where carmen were oftener\r\nlodged than gentry. The landlady stood at the door, and with a low\r\ncurtsey and a good-humoured smile welcomed us to “the ancient city of\r\nKilmallock;” in the same breath informed us, that she was a gentlewoman\r\nborn and bred, and that she had a son, “as fine an officer as ever you\r\ncould set eyes on in a day’s walk, who was a _patriarch_ (a patriot) in\r\nSouth America;” then leading us up a dark and narrow staircase to the\r\napartment we were to occupy, wished to know our names and business,\r\nwhence we came and where we were going; but left the room on our\r\ninquiring, in the first place, what we could have to eat. After waiting\r\na reasonable time our demands were attended to by a barefooted female,\r\nwho to our anxiety respecting what we could have for supper, replied\r\nwith perfect confidence, “Just any thing you like, sure!”\r\n\r\n“Have you any thing in the house?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed and we have not; but it’s likely I might be able to get an egg\r\nfor ye.”\r\n\r\nAn examination of the bedrooms will not prove more satisfactory; a glass\r\nor soap are luxuries seldom found. Sometimes one coarse and very small\r\ntowel is provided; at Kilmallock, the measurement of mine was half a\r\nyard in length and a quarter in breadth; its complexion, too, evinced\r\nthat it had assisted in the partial ablutions of many unfastidious\r\npersons. Mr. Arthur Young’s constant ejaculation, when he lighted on\r\nsuch quarters in Ireland, usually occurred to my mind, “Preserve me,\r\nFate, from such another!” and I have no doubt he would agree with me,\r\nthat two very essential requisites in an Irish tour are a stock of\r\nlinen, and a tolerable partiality for bacon. But travellers, any more\r\nthan beggars, cannot always be choosers, and those who will not submit\r\nwith patience to the accidents and inconveniences of a journey, must sit\r\nat home and read the road that others travel.\r\n\r\n    “Who alwaies walkes, on carpet soft and gay,\r\n    Knowes not hard hills, nor likes the mountaine way.”[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·17.\r\n\r\n  [66] Mr. Croker’s Researches in the South of Ireland, 1824, 4to.

There are sentiments in it as\r\nuseful to masters and mistresses as their domestics. The following\r\n“Rules” may likewise be perused with advantage by both; they are deemed\r\n“seasonable,” because, as good-livers say, good things are never out of\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rules for Servants._\r\n\r\nI. A good character is valuable to every one, but especially to\r\nservants; for it is their bread, and without it they cannot be admitted\r\ninto any creditable family; and happy it is that the best of characters\r\nis in every one’s power to deserve.\r\n\r\nII. Engage yourself cautiously, but stay long in your place, for long\r\nservice shows worth--as quitting a good place through passion, is a\r\nfolly which is always lamented of too late.\r\n\r\nIII. Never undertake any place you are not qualified for; for pretending\r\nto what you do not understand, exposes yourself, and, what is still\r\nworse, deceives them whom you serve.\r\n\r\nIV. Preserve your fidelity; for a faithful servant is a jewel, for whom\r\nno encouragement can be too great.\r\n\r\nV. Adhere to truth; for falsehood is detestable, and he that tells one\r\nlie, must tell twenty more to conceal it.\r\n\r\nVI. Be strictly honest; for it is shameful to be thought unworthy of\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nVII. Be modest in your behaviour; it becomes your station, and is\r\npleasing to your superiors.\r\n\r\nVIII. Avoid pert answers; for civil language is cheap, and impertinence\r\nprovoking.\r\n\r\nIX. Be clean in your business; for those who are slovens and sluts, are\r\ndisrespectful servants.\r\n\r\nX. Never tell the affairs of the family you belong to; for that is a\r\nsort of treachery, and often makes mischief; but keep their secrets, and\r\nhave none of your own.\r\n\r\nXI. Live friendly with your fellow-servants; for the contrary destroys\r\nthe peace of the house.\r\n\r\nXII. Above all things avoid drunkenness; for that is an inlet to vice,\r\nthe ruin of your character, and the destruction of your constitution.\r\n\r\nXIII. Prefer a peaceable life, with moderate gains, to great advantage\r\nand irregularity.\r\n\r\nXIV. Save your money; for that will be a friend to you in old age. Be\r\nnot expensive in dress, nor marry too soon.\r\n\r\nXV. Be careful of your master’s property; for wastefulness is a sin.\r\n\r\nXVI. Never swear; for that is a crime without excuse, as there is no\r\npleasure in it.\r\n\r\nXVII. Be always ready to assist a fellow-servant; for good nature gains\r\nthe love of every one.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Never stay when sent on a message; for waiting long is painful to\r\nyour master, and a quick return shows diligence.\r\n\r\nXIX. Rise early; for it is difficult to recover lost time.\r\n\r\nXX. The servant that often changes his place, works only to be poor; for\r\n“the rolling-stone gathers no moss.”\r\n\r\nXXI. Be not fond of increasing your acquaintances; for visiting leads\r\nyou out of your business, robs your master of your time, and often puts\r\nyou to an expense you cannot afford. And above all things, take care\r\nwith whom you are acquainted; for persons are generally the better or\r\nthe worse for the company they keep.\r\n\r\nXXII. When out of place, be careful where you lodge; for living in a\r\ndisreputable house, puts you upon a footing with those that keep it,\r\nhowever innocent you are yourself.\r\n\r\nXXIII. Never go out on your own business, without the knowledge of the\r\nfamily, lest in your absence you should be wanted; for “Leave is light,”\r\nand returning punctually at the time you promise, shows obedience, and\r\nis a proof of sobriety.\r\n\r\nXXIV. If you are dissatisfied with your place, mention your objections\r\nmodestly to your master or mistress, and give a fair warning, and do not\r\nneglect your business nor behave ill, in order to provoke them to turn\r\nyou away; for this will be a blemish in your character, which you must\r\nalways have from the last place you served in.\r\n\r\n⁂ _All who pay a due regard to the above precepts, will be happy in\r\nthemselves, will never want friends, and will always meet with the\r\nassistance, protection, and encouragement of the wealthy, the worthy,\r\nand the wise._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding sentences are contained in a paper which a young person\r\ncommitted to heart on first getting a place, and, having steadily\r\nobserved, obtained a character for integrity and worth incapable of\r\nbeing shaken.

This year may be deemed remarkable in the history of modern times,\r\nfor its being the period wherein, for the first time within the memory\r\nof man, a parliament expired by efflux of time. Most of the preceding\r\nparliaments were dissolved, but this attained to its full duration of\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEMAN’S WELL AT ALNWICK.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  _Kensington, Feb. 1826_.\r\n\r\nI hope the following description of an extraordinary custom which has\r\nobtained at Alnwick, in Northumberland, may be considered worthy\r\npreservation in _The Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles from the above town there is a pond, known by the name\r\nof the Freeman’s well; through which it has been customary for the\r\nfreemen to pass from time immemorial before they can obtain their\r\nfreedom. This is considered so indispensable, that no exemption is\r\npermitted, and without passing this ordeal the freedom would not be\r\nconferred. The pond is prepared by proper officers in such a manner, as\r\nto give the greatest possible annoyance to the persons who are to pass\r\nthrough it. Great dikes, or mounds, are erected in different parts, so\r\nthat the candidate for his freedom is at one moment seen at the top of\r\none of them only up to his knees, and the next instant is precipitated\r\ninto a gulf below, in which he frequently plunges completely over head.\r\nThe water is purposely rendered so muddy, that it is impossible to see\r\nwhere these dikes are situated, or by any precaution to avoid them.\r\nThose aspiring to the honour of the freedom of Alnwick, are dressed in\r\nwhite stockings, white pantaloons, and white caps. After they have\r\n“reached the point proposed,” they are suffered to put on their usual\r\nclothes, and obliged to join in a procession, and ride for several miles\r\nround the boundaries of the freemen’s property--a measure which is not a\r\nmere formality for parade, but absolutely indispensable; since, if they\r\nomit visiting any part of their property, it is claimed by his grace the\r\nduke of Northumberland, whose steward follows the procession, to note if\r\nany such omission occurs. The origin of the practice of travelling\r\nthrough the pond is not known. A tradition is current, that king John\r\nwas once nearly drowned upon the spot where this pond is situated, and\r\nsaved his life by clinging to a holly tree; and that he determined, in\r\nconsequence, thenceforth, that before any candidate could obtain the\r\nfreedom of Alnwick, he should not only wade through this pond, but plant\r\na holly tree at the door of his house on the same day; and this custom\r\nis still scrupulously observed. In the month of February, 1824, no less\r\nthan thirteen individuals went through the above formalities.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  T.

Virulent and unmerited attacks upon\r\nhis literary ability, by an unprincipled and malignant reviewer, injured\r\nhis rising reputation, overwhelmed his spirits, and he sunk into\r\nconsumption. In that state he fled for refuge to the climate of Italy,\r\ncaught cold on the voyage, and perished in Rome, at the early age of 25.\r\nSpecimens of his talents are in the former volume of this work. One of\r\nhis last poems was in prospect of departure from his native shores. It\r\nis an\r\n\r\n_Ode to a Nightingale._\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n    My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\r\n      My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\r\n    Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains\r\n      One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:\r\n    ’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,\r\n      But being too happy in thine happiness,--\r\n        That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,\r\n            In some melodious plot\r\n      Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,\r\n        Singest of summer in full-throated ease.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n    O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been\r\n      Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,\r\n    Tasting of Flora and the country green,\r\n      Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!\r\n    O for a beaker full of the warm South,\r\n      Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,\r\n        With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,\r\n            And purple-stained mouth;\r\n      That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,\r\n        And with thee fade away into the forest dim:\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n    Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget\r\n      What thou among the leaves hast never known,\r\n    The weariness, the fever, and the fret\r\n      Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;\r\n    Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,\r\n      Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;\r\n        Where but to think is to be full of sorrow\r\n            And leaden-eyed despairs,\r\n      Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,\r\n        Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n    Away! away! for I will fly to thee,\r\n      Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,\r\n    But on the viewless wings of Poesy,\r\n      Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:\r\n    Already with thee! tender is the night,\r\n      And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,\r\n        Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays;\r\n            But here there is no light,\r\n      Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown\r\n        Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n    I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,\r\n      Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,\r\n    But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet\r\n      Wherewith the seasonable month endows\r\n    The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;\r\n      White-hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;\r\n        Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves;\r\n              And mid-May’s eldest child,\r\n      The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,\r\n        The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n    Darkling I listen; and, for many a time\r\n      I have been half in love with easeful Death,\r\n    Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,\r\n      To take into the air my quiet breath;\r\n      Now more than ever seems it rich to die,\r\n    To cease upon the midnight with no pain,\r\n      While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad\r\n          In such an ecstasy!\r\n    Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain--\r\n      To thy high requiem become a sod.\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n    Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!\r\n      No hungry generations tread thee down;\r\n    The voice I hear this passing night was heard\r\n      In ancient days by emperor and clown:\r\n    Perhaps the self-same song that found a path\r\n      Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,\r\n        She stood in tears amid the alien corn;\r\n            The same that oft-times hath\r\n      Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam\r\n        Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n    Forlorn! the very word is like a bell\r\n      To toll me back from thee to my sole self!\r\n    Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well\r\n      As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.\r\n    Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades\r\n      Past the near meadows, over the still stream,\r\n        Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep\r\n            In the next valley-glades:\r\n    Was it a vision, or a waking dream?\r\n      Fled is that music:--Do I wake or sleep?\r\n\r\nThis ode was included with “Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and\r\nother Poems,” by John Keats, published by Messrs.

W., in Dr. Aikin’s Athenæum, says: “About twelve years ago, during my\r\nstay at Malta, I was introduced to the bey of Bengazi, in Africa, who\r\nwas going with his family and a large retinue of servants to Mecca. He\r\nvery politely offered me and my companion a passage to Egypt. We\r\nembarked on board a French brig which the bey had freighted, and very\r\nunfortunately were captured by an English letter of marque within a few\r\nleagues of Alexandria. The captain, however, was kind enough to allow us\r\nto proceed, and as we lay becalmed for two days, the bey ordered three\r\nor four Turkish flags to be hoisted, and a flask of oil to be thrown\r\noverboard. On inquiring into the purport of the ceremony, we were\r\ninformed that the flask _would float to Mecca_ (a pretty long\r\ncircumnavigation) _and bring us a fair wind!_ As we cast anchor in the\r\nport soon after, of course the ceremony had been propitious; nor did we\r\nseek to disturb the credulity of a man who had treated us so kindly.”\r\n\r\nWe know, however, that there is “credulity “on board English as well as\r\nTurkish vessels; and that if our sailors do not send an oil flask to\r\nMecca, they _whistle for a wind_ in a perfect calm, and many seem as\r\ncertainly to expect its appearance, as a boatswain calculates on the\r\nappearance of his crew when he pipes all hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Navigation in the Clouds._\r\n\r\nAgobard, archbishop of Lyons, in the reign of Charlemagne, and his son,\r\nhas the following passage in his book, “De Grandine.” “In these\r\ndistricts, almost all persons, noble and plebeian, townsmen and rustics,\r\nold and young, believe that hail and thunder may be produced at the will\r\nof man, that is, by the incantations of certain men who are called\r\n_Tempestarii_.” He proceeds: “We have seen and heard many who are sunk\r\nin such folly and stupidity, as to believe and assert, that there is a\r\ncertain country, which they call _Magonia_, whence ships come in the\r\nclouds, for the purpose of carrying back the corn which is beaten off by\r\nthe hail and storms, and which those aërial sailors purchase of the said\r\nTempestarii.” Agobard afterwards affirms, that he himself saw in a\r\ncertain assembly four persons, three men and a woman, exhibited bound,\r\nas if they had fallen from these ships, who had been kept for some days\r\nin confinement, and were now brought out to be stoned in his presence;\r\nbut that he rescued them from the popular fury. He further says, that\r\nthere were persons who pretended to be able to protect the inhabitants\r\nof a district from tempests, and that for this service they received a\r\npayment in corn from the credulous countrymen, which payment was called\r\n_canonicum_.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Shrovetide Custom._\r\n\r\nIt will appear on reading, that the annexed letter came too late for\r\ninsertion under _Shrove Tuesday_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDLOW ROPE PULLING.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book_\r\n\r\n  _Ludlow, Shrove Tuesday,_\r\n\r\n  _Feb. 7, 1826._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nAmong the customs peculiar to this town, that of pulling a rope is not\r\nthe least extraordinary. On Shrove Tuesday the corporation provide a\r\nrope three inches in thickness, and in length thirty-six yards, which is\r\ngiven out by a few of the members at one of the windows of the\r\nMarket-hall at four o’clock; when a large body of the inhabitants,\r\ndivided into two parties, (the one contending for Castle-street and\r\nBroad-street Wards, and the other for Old-street and Corve-street\r\nWards,) commence an arduous struggle; and as soon as either party gains\r\nthe victory by pulling the rope beyond the prescribed limits, the\r\npulling ceases; which is, however, always renewed by a second, and\r\nsometimes by a third contest; the rope being purchased by subscription\r\nfrom the victorious party, and given out again. In the end the rope is\r\nsold by the victors, and the money, which generally amounts to two\r\npounds, or guineas, is expended in liquor. I have this day been an\r\neye-witness to this scene of confusion; the rope was first gained by\r\nOld-street and Corve-street Wards, and secondly by Castle-street and\r\nBroad-street Wards. It is supposed, that nearly 2000 persons were\r\nactively employed on this occasion.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt this singular custom is symbolical of some remarkable\r\nevent, and a remnant of that ancient language of visible signs, which,\r\nsays a celebrated writer, “imperfectly supplies the want of letters, to\r\nperpetuate the remembrance of public or private transactions.” The sign,\r\nin this instance, has survived the remembrance of the occurrence it was\r\ndesigned to represent, and remains a profound mystery. It has been\r\ninsinuated, that the real occasion of this custom is known to the\r\ncorporation, but that for some reason or other, they are tenacious of\r\nthe secret. An obscure tradition attributes this custom to circumstances\r\narising out of the siege of Ludlow by Henry VI, when two parties arose\r\nwithin the town, one supporting the pretensions of the duke of York,\r\nand the other wishing to give admittance to the king; one of the\r\nbailiffs is said to have headed the latter party. History relates, that\r\nin this contest many lives were lost, and that the bailiff, heading his\r\nparty in an attempt to open Dinham gate, fell a victim there.\r\n\r\n  R.

G., not remembering to have met with a\r\nrepresentation of this remarkable seal in any work, and conceiving its\r\nappearance in the _Every-Day Book_ may gratify many readers, obligingly\r\ntransmits a fine impression, taken in February, 1826, from whence the\r\npresent engraving has been made with at least as much fidelity as the\r\nantiquity of the original permitted. “This seal,” he says, “is quite\r\ndistinct from the city seal. It is kept at the Mansion-house, in the\r\ncustody of the gate-porter, and is now used for the purpose of\r\nauthenticating documents forwarded to foreign countries upon affidavit\r\nsworn before the lord mayor: it is also used for sealing the precepts\r\nwhich are issued preparatory to St. Thomas’s-day for the election of\r\ncommon councilmen and ward officers.” The following is the inscription\r\nround the seal, “_Sigillum Officii Majoratus Civitatis Londini_:” this\r\nlegend is indistinct from wear.\r\n\r\nThe history of this seal is especially remarkable, because it is\r\nconnected with the origin of the “dagger” in the city arms. On this\r\nsubject Maitland and other historians have taken so much only from Stow\r\nas seemed to them to suit their purpose; what that author relates,\r\ntherefore, is here extracted verbatim. He introduces it by saying, “In\r\nthe year 1381, William Walworth, then maior, a most provident, valiant,\r\nand learned citizen, did by his arrest of Wat Tyler, (a presumptuous\r\nrebell upon whom no man durst lay hands,) deliver the king and kingdome\r\nfrom the danger of most wicked traitors, and was for his service\r\nknighted in the field as before hath been related.” In opposition to a\r\nnotion which prevailed in his time, and prevails at present, that the\r\n“dagger” in the civic shield was an augmentation of the city arms upon\r\noccasion of Walworth’s prowess in Smithfield, Stow says, “It hath also\r\nbeen, and is now growne to a common opinion, that in reward of this\r\nservice done by the said William Walworth against the rebell, that king\r\nRichard added to the armes of this city (which was argent, a plaine\r\ncrosse gules) a sword, or dagger, (for so they terme it,) whereof I have\r\nread no such record, but to the contrary. I finde that in the fourth\r\nyeere of king Richard the second, in a full assembly made in the upper\r\nchamber of the Guildhall, summoned by this William Walworth, then maior,\r\nas well of aldermen as of the common councell in every ward, for certain\r\naffaires concerning the king, it was there by common consent agreed and\r\nordained, that the old seale of the office of the maioralty of the city\r\nbeing very small, old, unapt, and uncomely for the honour of the city,\r\nshould be broken, and one other new seale bee had; which the said maior\r\ncommanded to be made artificially, and honourably, for the exercise of\r\nthe said office therafter, in place of the other. In which new seale,\r\nbesides the images of Peter and Paul, which of old were rudely engraven,\r\nthere should be under the feet of the said images a shield of the arms\r\nof the said city, perfectly graven, with two lyons supporting the same,\r\nand two sergeants of arms: in the other part, one, and two tabernacles,\r\nin which, above, should stand two angels, between whom (above the said\r\nimages of Peter and Paul) should be set the glorious Virgin. This being\r\ndone, the old seale of the office was delivered to Richard Odiham,\r\nchamberlain, who brake it, and in place thereof was delivered the new\r\nseale to the said maior, to use in his office of maioralty as occasion\r\nshould require. This new seale seemeth to be made before William\r\nWalworth was knighted, for he is not there intituled Sir, as afterwards\r\nhe was: and certain it is, that the same new seale then made, is now in\r\nuse, and none other in that office of the maioralty; which may suffice\r\nto answer the former fable, without showing of any evidence sealed with\r\nthe _old_ seale, which was the crosse, and sword of Saint Paul, and not\r\nthe dagger of William Walworth.”\r\n\r\nOn a partial citation of the preceding extract, in Maitland, it is\r\nobserved by S. G., that “the seal at present in use was made in\r\npursuance of the order above cited, may be deduced from the seal itself.\r\nIn the centre, within a large and square compartment, are the effigies\r\nof Peter and Paul. The former has a mitre or tiara on his head, and is\r\nattired in the pall as bishop of the catholic church, and holds a\r\ncrosier in his left hand. The latter saint is known by his usual\r\nattribute, the sword, which he sustains in his right hand: above each of\r\nthese saints is a rich canopy. Beneath the compartment just described is\r\na shield, bearing the present arms of the city, a cross, with a dagger\r\nin the dexter quarter, supported by two lions. It appears to have been\r\nsurmounted with a low pointed arch. The centre compartment is flanked by\r\ntwo niches, with rich canopies and plinths; in each is a demi-figure\r\nbearing a mace, and having on its head a triangular cap; these figures,\r\naccording to the above description, are intended to represent two\r\nsergeants at arms. The canopies to these niches terminate in angular\r\npedestals, sustaining kneeling statues in the act of paying adoration to\r\nthe Virgin Mary, whose effigy, though much effaced, appears in the\r\ncentre niche at the top of the seal. From these representations on the\r\nseal before us, little doubt can remain that it is the same which has\r\nbeen in use from the time of sir William Walworth to the present day.\r\nThe canopies and stall work are of the period in which it is supposed to\r\nhave been made, and are of similar design with those fine specimens\r\nwhich ornamented the late front of Westminster-hall, and the screen to\r\nthe chapel of Saint Edward the Confessor in the abbey, and which are\r\nstill to be seen in the restored portion of Westminster-hall, as well as\r\nthe _plaster_ altar-screen lately set up in the abbey church.”\r\n\r\nAs Wat Tyler’s insurrection was in 1381, the fourth year of Richard II.,\r\nand as that was the year wherein the old mayoralty seal was destroyed,\r\nand the present seal made, our obliging correspondent, S. G., deems it\r\n“a very reasonable opinion, which many authors have entertained on the\r\nsubject, that the dagger in the city arms was really granted at that\r\nperiod, in commemoration of Walworth having given Tyler the blow with\r\nthat instrument, which was the prelude to his death.” He says it is also\r\nfurther confirmed by the act of the assembly [the common council], which\r\nMaitland quotes [after Stow], inasmuch as one reason which appears to\r\nhave been urged by them for destroying the old seal was on account of\r\nthe same, at that time, being unbecoming the honour of the city, which,\r\nno doubt, referred to the addition of the dagger, which had then lately\r\nbeen made to the arms: and it likewise goes on further to state, in\r\nreference thereto, “that beside the images of Saint Peter and Paul, was\r\nplaced the shield of the arms of the said city well engraved.”\r\n\r\nOur correspondent, S. G., will not conceive offence at a notion which\r\nvaries from his own opinion; and probably, on reperusing the quotation\r\nfrom Stow and the following remarks, he may see some reason to abate his\r\npresent persuasion.\r\n\r\nAs a reason for the old seal, in the fourth year of Richard II., having\r\nbeen ordered by the common council to be broken, Stow says it was “very\r\nsmall, old, unapt, and uncomely for the honour of the city.” His\r\ndescription seems to set forth its diminutive size and age, its “being\r\nvery small, old,” and “unapt,” as the ground whereon they deemed it\r\n“uncomely for the honour of the city,” and therefore caused the old seal\r\nto be destroyed, and a new one to be made. So far this appears to have\r\nbeen Stow’s view of the matter; and should his authority be regarded,\r\nour friend S. G. may appear to have too hastily assumed that the common\r\ncouncil order for the destruction of the old seal, as “unbecoming the\r\nhonour of the city, no doubt referred to the addition of the dagger\r\nwhich had then lately been made to their arms.” Unless Stow’s testimony\r\nbe disputed, it may not only be doubted, but positively denied, that the\r\ndagger “had then lately been added to the city arms.” Stow speaks of it\r\nas a “common opinion,” when he wrote, that upon Walworth’s striking Wat\r\nTyler with his dagger Richard II. therefore “added a sword, or dagger,\r\nfor so they terme it,” he says, to the city arms; “whereof,” he adds, “I\r\nhave read no such record, but to the contrary.” Then he takes pains to\r\nrelate _why_ the ancient seal was destroyed, and having stated the\r\nreasons already cited, he says, “this _new_ seale,” the seal now before\r\nus, “seemeth to be made _before_ William Walworth was knighted, for he\r\nis not there intituled Sir, as he afterwards was.” Afterwards comes\r\nStow’s conclusion upon the whole matter: “Certaine it is,” he says,\r\n“that the same new seale then made, is now in use, and none other in\r\nthat office of the maioralty: which,” mark his words, “which may suffice\r\nto answer the former fable, without shewing of any evidence sealed with\r\nthe _old_ seale, which was the crosse, and sword of St. Paul, and not\r\nthe dagger of William Walworth.” What Stow here calls the “former\r\nfable,” was the “common opinion” stated by himself, “that king Richard\r\nadded to the arms of this city (which [in the notion of those who\r\nentertained the opinion] was argent, a plain cross gules) a sword, or\r\ndagger.” That the city arms before the time of Richard II. was merely\r\n“argent a plain cross gules,” Stow clearly treats as a vulgar\r\nassumption, “whereof,” he says, “I have read no such record, _but_” and\r\nthese following words are most notable, “BUT _to the contrary_.” This,\r\nhis declaration “_to the contrary_” being followed by his particulars,\r\njust laid before the reader, concerning the present seal, Stow says,\r\n“may suffice to answer the former fable, without showing of any evidence\r\nsealed with the _old_ seale:” that is, without showing or producing any\r\ndocument or writing “sealed with the old seale, which,” to clench the\r\nmatter, he positively affirms, “was the crosse, and sword of St. Paul,\r\nand not the dagger of William Walworth.”\r\n\r\nThe cathedral church of the city of London is dedicated to St. Paul, who\r\nsuffered martyrdom by the sword, and “the old seale,” related by Stow to\r\nhave been destroyed, he says, “was the crosse, and _sword_ of St. Paul.”\r\nIt therefore represented the present shield of the city arms, which, on\r\nStow’s showing, existed before the time of Wat Tyler’s insurrection, and\r\nare therefore “the crosse, and sword of St. Paul, and not the dagger of\r\nWilliam Walworth.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the communication with which the liberty of differing has been taken,\r\nin furtherance of its object to elucidate the arms of the metropolis,\r\nour respected correspondent S. G. adds, “The origin of the seal may no\r\ndoubt be traced to the source from whence sir Henry Englefield, in his\r\nwalk through Southampton, derives the seal of the city of Winchester; in\r\nspeaking of which his opinion appears to be, that it was first used in\r\nconsequence of an act passed for the benefit of merchants, in the reign\r\nof Edward I., which was afterwards greatly extended by the statute of\r\nStaples, passed in the 27th year of the reign of Edward III., whereby it\r\nwas enacted that the commerce of wool, leather, and lead should be\r\ncarried on at certain towns, called Staple towns, of which several are\r\nnot seaports--but to each of these inland Staples a port is assigned for\r\nentries. It was also further enacted, that in each Staple there should\r\nbe a _seal_ kept by the mayor of the Staple.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn relation to this seal, Maitland sadly blunders. He says, “The ancient\r\nseal of this city having been laid aside in the fourth of Richard II.,\r\nthe present, whereof the annexed is a representation, was made in the\r\nsame year, 1381.” Then he annexes his “representation,” purporting to be\r\nof this seal, which Stow so accurately describes, but, strange to say,\r\nhe substitutes the “representation” of a seal wholly different. (See his\r\nHistory of London, edit 1772, vol. ii. p. 1193.) It is astonishing that\r\nMaitland should have so erred, for (in vol. i. p. 138.) he describes the\r\nseal almost in Stow’s words, and sufficiently at length to have saved\r\nhim from the palpable mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sealing-Wax._\r\n\r\nOur present common sealing-wax for letters was not invented till the\r\nsixteenth century. The earliest letter in Europe known to have been\r\nsealed with it, was written from London, August 3, 1554, to the\r\nrheingrave Philip Francis von Daun, by his agent in England, Gerrard\r\nHerman. The wax is of a dark red, very shining, and the impression bears\r\nthe initials of the writer’s name, G. H. The next seal known in the\r\norder of time is on a letter written in 1561 to the council of Gorlitz\r\nat Breslau: it is sealed in three places with beautiful red wax. There\r\nare two letters in 1563 from count Louis of Nassau to the landgrave\r\nWilliam IV.; one dated March 3, is sealed with red wax, the other, dated\r\nNovember 7, is sealed with black wax. In 1566 are two letters to the\r\nrheingrave Frederick von Daun, from his steward Charles de Pousol, in\r\nPicardy, dated respectively September the 2d, and September the 7th;\r\nanother from Pousol to the rheingrave, dated Paris, January 22, 1567, is\r\nsealed with red wax of a higher colour and apparently of a coarser\r\nquality. On the 15th of May, 1571, Vulcob, a French nobleman, who the\r\nyear before had been ambassador from the king of France to the court of\r\nWeymar, wrote a letter to that court sealed with red wax; he sealed nine\r\nletters of a prior date with common wax. From an old expense book of\r\n1616, in the records of Plessingburg, “Spanish wax,” and other writing\r\nmaterials, were ordered from a manufacturer of sealing-wax at Nuremburg,\r\nfor the personal use of Christian, margrave of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that, as the oldest seals came from England and\r\nFrance, and as the invention is called “Spanish wax,” it originated with\r\nthe Spaniards; but this is doubted. The first notice of sealing-wax\r\noccurs in a work by Garcia ab Orto, or Horto, entitled “Aromatum et\r\nsimplicium aliquot historia, &c.” first printed in 1563, and afterwards\r\nat Antwerp in 1574, 8vo., in which latter edition it is mentioned at p.\r\n33. The oldest printed receipt for sealing-wax is in a work entitled\r\n“Neu Titularbuch, &c., Durch Samuelen Zimmerman, burger zu Augspurg\r\n1579,” 4to. p. 112. The following is a\r\n\r\n_Translation._\r\n\r\n“To make hard sealing-wax, called Spanish wax, with which if letters be\r\nsealed they cannot be opened without breaking the seal.--Take beautiful\r\nclear resin, the whitest you can procure, and melt it over a slow\r\ncharcoal fire. When it is properly melted, take it from the fire, and\r\nfor every pound of resin add two ounces of cinnabar pounded very fine,\r\nstirring it about. Then let the whole cool, or pour it into cold water.\r\nThus you will have beautiful _red_ wax.\r\n\r\n“If you are desirous of having _black_ wax, add lamp black to it. With\r\nsmalt, or azure, you may make it _blue_; with white lead, _white_; and\r\nwith orpiment, _yellow_.\r\n\r\n“If instead of resin you melt purified turpentine, in a glass vessel,\r\nand give it any colour you choose, you will have a harder kind of\r\nsealing-wax, and not so brittle as the former.”\r\n\r\nIn these receipts there is no mention of gum lac, which is at present\r\nthe principal ingredient in sealing-wax of the best quality. The name\r\n“Spanish wax,” probably imports no more than “Spanish flies,” “Spanish\r\ngum,” and several other “Spanish” commodities; for it was formerly the\r\ncustom to give all new things, particularly those which excited wonder,\r\nor excelled in quality, the appellation of “Spanish.”[69]\r\n\r\nDutch sealing-wax, or wax with “brand well en vast houd,” burn well and\r\nhold fast, impressed on each stick, was formerly in great repute; but\r\nthe legend having been constantly forged was no security against\r\nimposition. The “best Dutch sealing-wax” usually sold in the shops of\r\nLondon, is often worse than that which inferior manufacturers stamp with\r\nthe names of many stationers, who prefer a large profit to a good\r\nreputation. It is not an easy matter, in 1826, to get a stick of\r\nsealing-wax that will “burn well and hold fast.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wafers._\r\n\r\nThe oldest letter yet found with a red wafer was written in 1624, from\r\nD. Krapf, at Spires, to the government at Bayreuth. Wafers are ascribed,\r\nby Labat, to Genoese economy. In the whole of the seventeenth century\r\nthey were only used by private persons; on public seals they commence\r\nonly in the eighteenth century.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Writing Ink._\r\n\r\nThe ancient writing ink was a viscid mass like painter’s colours, and\r\ntherefore letters in ancient manuscript frequently appear in relief.[71]\r\nPliny’s writing ink is mentioned by Dr. Bancroft, according to whom it\r\nconsisted of the simple ingredients in the following receipt. “Any\r\nperson who will take the trouble of mixing pure lamp black with water,\r\nthickened a little by gum, may obtain an ink of no despicable quality in\r\nother respects, and with the advantage of being much less liable to\r\ndecay by age, than the ink now in common use.” It should be observed,\r\nhowever, that every black pigment mixed with gum or size can be soon and\r\neasily washed out again with water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not purposed to make this a “Receipt Book,” yet, as connected with\r\nthis subject, two or three really good receipts may be of essential\r\nservice, at some time or other, to many readers. For instance, artists,\r\nand other individuals who require it, may easily manufacture a black\r\npigment in the following manner, with a certainty of its being genuine,\r\nwhich can scarcely be placed in the article sold at most shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A pure Lamp Black._\r\n\r\nSuspend over a lamp a funnel of tin plate, having above it a pipe to\r\nconvey from the apartment the smoke which escapes from the lamp. Large\r\nmushrooms of a very black carbonaceous matter, and exceedingly light,\r\nwill be formed at the summit of the cone. This carbonaceous part is\r\ncarried to such a state of division as cannot be given to any other\r\nmatter by grinding it on a piece of porphyry. This black goes a great\r\nway in every kind of painting. It may be rendered drier by calcination\r\nin close vessels; and it should be observed that the funnel ought to be\r\nunited to the pipe, which conveys off the smoke, by means of wire,\r\nbecause solder would be melted by the flame of the lamp.[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Receipts for Ink._\r\n\r\nChaptal the eminent chemist, after numerous experiments regarding\r\nwriting ink, concludes, that the best ingredients and proportions are\r\nthe following, viz: two parts of galls, in sorts, bruised, and one part\r\nof logwood chipped; these are to be boiled in twenty-five times their\r\nweight of water for the space of two hours, adding a little water from\r\ntime to time, according to the evaporation. The decoction so made, he\r\nsays, will commonly mark from 3 to 3½ degrees upon the hydrometer of\r\nBeaumé, equal to about 1022 of the common standard. At the same time a\r\nsolution of gum arabic is to be made with warm water, until the latter\r\nwill dissolve no more of the former. This solution will mark 14 or 15\r\ndegrees, equal to about 110. A solution of calcined sulphate of iron is\r\nalso to be made, and concentrated so that it will mark 10 degrees,\r\nequal to about 1071. And to this as much sulphate of copper is to be\r\nadded as will be equal to one-twelfth part of the galls employed to make\r\nthe decoction. The several matters being so prepared, six measures of\r\nthe decoction are to be mixed with four measures of the solution of gum;\r\nand to this mixture from three to four measures of the metallic solution\r\nare to be added, by a little at a time, mixing the several matters each\r\ntime by shaking. Ink so made, will, he says, form no sediment: and he\r\nestimates the proportions of solid matters contained in it to be five\r\nhundred parts of gums, four hundred and sixty-two parts of the extract\r\nof galls and logwood, and four hundred and eighty-one parts of metallic\r\noxides.\r\n\r\nDr. Bancroft, who gives these particulars from Chaptal, proposes the\r\nfollowing, as being generally the most suitable proportions for\r\ncomposing the best and most lasting writing ink, viz:\r\n\r\nTake of good Aleppo galls, in sorts, coarsely powdered, twelve ounces,\r\nand of chipped logwood six ounces; boil these in five quarts of soft\r\nwater two hours, and strain off the decoction whilst hot; then put to\r\nthe residuum as much boiling water as, when properly stirred, strained,\r\nand added to the former, will suffice to make the whole of the decoction\r\nequal to one gallon; add to this five ounces of sulphate of iron, with\r\nthe same quantity of gum arabic, and two ounces of good dry muscovado\r\nsugar; let these be all dissolved, and well mixed by stirring.\r\n\r\nA calcination of the sulphate of iron, which Chaptal, Proust, and some\r\nothers have recommended, Dr. Bancroft does not regard as of much\r\nimportance; for, he says, though the ink may be thereby made to attain\r\nits _utmost_ degree of darkness, almost immediately, yet the strong\r\ndisposition which ink has to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere until\r\nsaturated therewith, will enable it, without such calcination, to attain\r\nan equal degree of blackness, in a day or two, according to the\r\ntemperature of the air, if the latter be allowed free access to it. For\r\nreasons which he also states, he omits the sulphate of copper; though he\r\nobserves that, if any portion of that metal were deemed beneficial, he\r\nshould prefer verdigrise to the sulphate, the latter containing a much\r\nlarger proportion of acid than even the sulphate of iron, and being,\r\ntherefore, more likely to render the ink corrosive. He regards gum as\r\nhighly useful to retard the separation and subsidence of its black part,\r\nor compound of colouring matter and iron, previous to its application to\r\npaper, as well as to hinder it, when used, from spreading and\r\npenetrating too far.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Indelible Writing Ink._\r\n\r\nM. Chaptal remarks, that, since the oxygenated muriatic acid had been\r\nfound capable of discharging the colour of common writing ink, both from\r\nparchment and paper, without injuring their texture, it had been\r\nfraudulently employed to efface particular parts or words of deeds,\r\ncontracts, or other writings, for which others had been substituted,\r\nleaving the signatures untouched. In consequence of these frauds, the\r\ncommercial parts of society, as well as governments, were solicitous for\r\nthe discovery of some composition, which might be employed instead of\r\ncommon writing ink, without its defects; therefore Chaptal, (being then\r\nminister of the interior of France, and possessed of great chemical\r\nscience,) as might be expected, occupied himself particularly with that\r\nsubject; and he states, that up to the then present time, the\r\ncomposition which had been found most useful for this purpose, consisted\r\nof a solution of glue in water, with which a sufficient portion of lamp\r\nblack and a little sea salt were intimately mixed, by rubbing them\r\ntogether on marble. This composition was made sufficiently thin by\r\nwater, to flow readily from the pen; and he describes it as being\r\ncapable of resisting the action, not merely of cold, but of boiling\r\nwater, and also of acids, alkalies, and spirit of wine; and attended\r\nwith no inconvenience but that of abrasion by being rubbed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is observed by Dr. Bancroft, that when lamp black has been\r\nincorporated with common ink, by first rubbing the former in a mortar\r\nwith a mucilage of gum arabic, the writing done with it could not be\r\nrendered invisible by the application of muriatic acid; and, doubtless,\r\nsuch an addition of lamp black would hinder the letters from ever\r\nbecoming illegible by age, at least within any length of time which the\r\npaper and parchment could be expected to last. But ink made with this\r\naddition would require to be frequently shaken or stirred, as the lamp\r\nblack would otherwise be apt to separate and subside.\r\n\r\nIn the making of indelible ink, the receipt for lamp black before given\r\nmay be of considerable importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calico Printing._\r\n\r\nPerhaps no object has more engaged “the ingenious chemist’s art” than\r\nthis, and leave is craved to conclude this diversion from the mayoralty\r\nseal of London, by what may be serviceable to some who are actively\r\nengaged in an extensive branch, from whence our private chambers, and\r\nthe dresses of our wives and daughters, derive continual improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prosubstantive, or Chemical Black, for Calico Printers._\r\n\r\n“Some years ago,” says Dr. Bancroft, “I purchased of a calico printer,\r\npossessing great knowledge of the principles and practice of his art,\r\nthe secret of a composition which he had employed with success, as a\r\nprosubstantive black, and which, as far as I can judge from experiments\r\nupon a small scale, deserved the high commendations which he bestowed\r\nupon it: and though I have never obtained the smallest pecuniary\r\nadvantage from this purchase, in any way, I will here give the full\r\nbenefit of it to the public. The following was his recipe, with some\r\nabbreviations of language: viz. Take two pounds of the best mixed galls,\r\nin powder, and boil them in one gallon of vinegar, until their soluble\r\npart is extracted, or dissolved; then strain off the clear decoction,\r\nand add to the residuum of the galls as much water as will be equal to\r\nthe vinegar evaporated in boiling; stir them a little, and after\r\nallowing the powdered galls time to subside, strain off the clear\r\nliquor, and mix it with the former decoction, adding to the mixture six\r\nounces of sulphate of iron; and this being dissolved, put to it six\r\nounces more of sulphate of iron, after it has been previously mixed\r\nwith, and dissolved by, half of its weight of single aquafortis; let\r\nthis be stirred, and equally dispersed through the mixture, which is to\r\nbe thickened by dissolving therein a sufficient quantity of gum\r\ntragacanth, (of which a very small proportion will suffice.) Calico,\r\nafter being printed or pencilled with this mixture, should, when the\r\nlatter is sufficiently dried, be washed in lime water, to remove the gum\r\nand superfluous colour, and then either streamed or well rinsed in clear\r\nwater. This composition has not been found to weaken, or injure, the\r\ntexture of calico printed or pencilled with it, and the colour is\r\nthought unobjectionable in regard to its blackness and durability.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is added by Dr. Bancroft, that “when sulphate of iron is mixed with\r\naquafortis, the latter undergoes a decomposition; the oxygen of the\r\nnitric acid combining with the iron, and raising it to a much higher\r\ndegree of oxidation; the result of these operations is the production of\r\na fluid which has the consistence and smooth appearance of oil, and\r\nwhich (though the name may not be quite unexceptionable) I will call a\r\nnitro-sulphate of iron. I have been induced to believe, from several\r\ntrials, that a better prosubstantive black than any other within my\r\nknowledge may be formed, by taking a decoction, containing in each\r\ngallon the soluble matter of two pounds of the best galls, in sorts, and\r\nwhen cold, adding to it for each gallon twelve ounces of sulphate of\r\niron, which had been previously mixed with half its weight of single\r\naquafortis, (of which one wine pint should weigh about twenty ounces,)\r\nand, by the decomposition just described, converted to the\r\nnitro-sulphate of iron just mentioned. By thus employing twelve ounces\r\nof sulphate of iron, oxygenated by nitric acid, instead of six ounces of\r\nthe latter, with six ounces of the green sulphate in its ordinary state,\r\nan improvement in the colour seems, by my experiments, to have been\r\ninvariably produced, and without any corroding or hurtful action upon\r\nthe fibres of the cotton.”\r\n\r\nWith these scientific receipts and suggestions it may be agreeable to\r\nclose. Matters of this kind have not been before introduced, nor is it\r\npurposed to repeat them; and those who think they are out of place at\r\npresent, may be asked to recollect whether any of themselves ever\r\nobtained knowledge of any kind that, at some period or other, did not\r\ncome into use?\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·72.\r\n\r\n  [68] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [69] Beckmann.\r\n\r\n  [70] Fosbroke’s Dict. of Antiquities.

On the 20th of February, 1748, the river Sark, near\r\nPhilipston, in the parish of Kirk Andrews upon Eske, and the Liddel,\r\nnear Penton, in the same parish, were both dry. At the same time other\r\nrivers also lost their waters. These remarkable phenomena are naturally\r\naccounted for in the “Gentleman’s Magazine for 1753,” vol. xxiii. p.\r\n156.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 41·39.\r\n\r\n\r\n~February 28.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Johnson._\r\n\r\nIt was recorded in the daily journals, on the 28th of February, 1755,\r\nthat “the university of Oxford, in full convocation, unanimously\r\nconferred the degree of master of arts on the learned Mr. Samuel\r\nJohnson, author of the New English Dictionary.” Such a testimony to\r\ndistinguished merit, from a learned university, was, perhaps, such a\r\nreward as Dr. Johnson appreciated more highly than others of more\r\nseeming worth; the publicity given to it at the time is evidence of the\r\nnotoriety he had attained by his literary labours, and of the interest\r\ntaken in his fame by every class of society. He taught and admonished\r\nall ranks, in a style that charmed by its luxuriant amplification of\r\nsimple truths, when the majority of people refused the wholesome labour\r\nof reflection. Johnson’s ethical writings verify the remark of a shrewd\r\nwriter, that “a maxim is like an ingot of gold, which you may draw out\r\nto any length you please.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gin Lane._\r\n\r\nThe “Historical Chronicle” of the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” notices that\r\non this day, in the year 1736, a proposal was submitted to the house of\r\ncommons “for laying such a duty on distilled spirituous liquors as might\r\nprevent the ill consequences of the poorer sort drinking them to\r\nexcess,” whereon it takes occasion to adduce the following fact: “We\r\nhave observed some signs, where such liquors are retailed, with the\r\nfollowing inscriptions, _Drunk for a penny, dead drunk for twopence,\r\nclean straw for nothing_.” This record establishes the reality of the\r\ninscription in Hogarth’s fearful print of “Gin-lane,” and marks a trait\r\nin the manners of that period, which, to the credit of the industrious\r\nclasses of society, has greatly abated.\r\n\r\nDrunkenness exists nowhere but in the vicious or the irresolute. “Give a\r\npoor man work and you will make him rich.” Give a drunkard work and he\r\nwill only keep sober till he has earned enough to drink again and get\r\npoor. While he is drinking he robs himself of his time; drinking robs\r\nhim of his understanding and health; when he is unfit or disinclined to\r\nwork he will lie to avoid it; and if he succeeds in deceiving, he will\r\nprobably turn thief. Thus a drunkard is not to be relied on either for\r\ntrue speaking, or honest principle; and therefore those who see that\r\ndrinking leads to falsehood and dishonesty, never attach credit to what\r\na drunkard says, nor trust him within reach of their property.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now husbandman and hinds in March prepare,\r\n    And order take, against the teeming year,\r\n    Survey their lands, and keep a good look out\r\n    To get their fields and farms well fenc’d about.\r\n    Now careful gard’ners, during sunny days,\r\n    Admit to greenhouses the genial rays:\r\n    Vines, espaliers, and standard trees demand\r\n    The pruner’s skilful eye, and ready hand;\r\n    And num’rous shoots and roots court the kind toil\r\n    Of transplantation, or another soil.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nIn the “Mirror of the Months” it is observed, that at this season a\r\nstrange commotion may be seen and heard among the winged creatures,\r\nportending momentous matters.

The robin, too,\r\nhas left off, for a brief season, his low plaintive piping, which it\r\nmust be confessed was poured forth for his own exclusive satisfaction,\r\nand, reckoning on his spruce looks and sparkling eyes, issues his quick\r\nperemptory love-call, in a somewhat ungallant and husband-like manner.\r\n\r\nThe sparrows, who have lately been sulking silently about from tree to\r\ntree, with ruffled plumes and drooping wings, now spruce themselves up\r\ntill they do not look half their former size; and if it were not\r\npairing-time, one might fancy that there was more of war than of love in\r\ntheir noisy squabblings.\r\n\r\nNow, also, the ants first begin to show themselves from their\r\nsubterranean sleeping-rooms; those winged abortions, the bats, perplex\r\nthe eyes of evening wanderers by their seeming ubiquity; and the owls\r\nhold scientific converse with each other at half a mile distance.\r\n\r\nNow, quitting the country till next month, we find London all alive,\r\nLent and Lady-day notwithstanding; for the latter is but a day after\r\nall; and he must have a very countrified conscience who cannot satisfy\r\nit as to the former, by doing penance once or twice at an oratorio, and\r\nhearing comic songs sung in a foreign tongue; or, if this does not do,\r\nhe may fast if he please, every Friday, by eating salt fish in addition\r\nto the rest of his fare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this month some birds that took refuge in our temperate climate,\r\nfrom the rigour of the arctic winters, now begin to leave us, and return\r\nto the countries where they were bred; the redwing-thrush, fieldfare,\r\nand woodcock, are of this kind, and they retire to spend their summer in\r\nNorway, Sweden, and other northern regions. The reason why these birds\r\nquit the north of Europe in winter is evidently to escape the severity\r\nof the frost; but why at the approach of spring they should return to\r\ntheir former haunts is not so easily accounted for. It cannot be want of\r\nfood, for if during the _winter_ in this country they are able to\r\nsubsist, they may fare plentifully through the rest of the year; neither\r\ncan their migration be caused by an impatience of warmth, for the season\r\nwhen they quit this country is by no means so hot as the Lapland\r\nsummers; and in fact, from a few stragglers or wounded birds annually\r\nbreeding here, it is evident that there is nothing in our climate or\r\nsoil which should hinder them from making this country their permanent\r\nresidence, as the thrush, blackbird, and other of their congeners,\r\nactually do. The crane, the stork, and other birds, which used formerly\r\nto be natives of our island, have quitted it as cultivation and\r\npopulation have extended; it is probable, also, that the same reason\r\nforbids the fieldfare and redwing-thrush, which are of a timorous,\r\nretired disposition, to make choice of England as a place of sufficient\r\nsecurity to breed in.[73]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this month commences the yeaning season of those gentle animals whose\r\nclothing yields us our own, and engages in its manufacture a large\r\nportion of human industry and ingenuity.

Attested by Sixteen Persons that were Eye-witnesses.\r\nPublished at Dublin, and thence communicated hither. Licensed, 1679.\r\nLondon: printed for L. C., 1679.\r\n\r\nUpon the second day of this present month, being Sunday in the evening,\r\nnear sun-set, several gentlemen and others, hereinafter named, walked\r\nforth into the fields, and the sun going down behind a hill, and\r\nappearing somewhat bigger than ordinary, they discourst about it,\r\ndirecting their eyes towards the place where the sun set.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the company observed in the air, near the place where the\r\nsun went down, an arm of a blackish blew colour, with a ruddy\r\ncomplexioned hand at one end and at the other end a cross piece, with a\r\nring fastned to the middle of it, like one end of an anchor, which stood\r\nstill a while, and then made northwards, and so disappeared; while they\r\nwere startled at the sight which they all saw, and wondred what it\r\nshould be and mean, there appeared at a great distance in the air, from\r\nthe same part of the sky, something like a ship coming towards them; and\r\nso near to them it came, that they could distinctly perceive the masts,\r\nsails, tacklings, and men; she then seemed to tack about, and sailed\r\nwith the stern foremost, northwards, upon a dark, smooth sea, (not seen\r\nbefore,) which stretched itself from south-west to the north-west;\r\nhaving seemed thus to sail for some few minutes, she sunk by degrees\r\ninto the sea, her stern first, and as she sunk, they perceived her men\r\nplainly running up the tackling, in the fore-part of the ship, as it\r\nwere, to save themselves from drowning.\r\n\r\nThe ship disappearing, they all sate down on a green bank, talking of,\r\nand wondring at what they had seen, for a small space, and then appeared\r\n(as that ship had done) a fort, or high place strongly fortifyed, with\r\nsomewhat like a castle on the top of it: out of the sides of which, by\r\nreason of some clouds of smoake, and a flash of fire suddenly issuing\r\nout, they concluded some shot to be made. The fort then immediately was\r\ndivided into two parts, which were in an instant transformed into two\r\nexact ships, like the other they had seen, with their heads towards each\r\nother. That towards the south, seemed to chase the other with its stern\r\nforemost, northwards, till it sunk with its stern first, as the first\r\nship had done. The other ship sayled sometime after, and then sunk with\r\nits head first. It was observed, that men were running upon the decks in\r\nthese two ships, but they did not see them climb up, as in the last\r\nship, excepting one man, whom they saw distinctly to get up with much\r\nhaste upon the very top of the bowsprit of the second ship, as they were\r\nsinking. They supposed the two last ships were engaged and fighting, for\r\nthey saw like bullets rouling upon the sea, while they were both\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe ships being gone, the company rose, and were about to go away, when\r\none of them perswaded the rest to stay, and said, he saw some little\r\nblack thing coming towards them, which he believed would be worth their\r\nobservation, then some of the rest observed the same; whereupon, they\r\nsate down again, and presently there appeared a chariot, somewhat like\r\nthat which Neptune is represented riding in, drawn with two horses,\r\nwhich turned as the ships had done, northward. And immediately after it,\r\ncame a strange frightful creature, which they concluded to be some kind\r\nof serpent, having an head like a snake, and a knotted bunch or bulk at\r\nthe other end, something resembling a snail’s house.\r\n\r\nThis monster came suddenly behind the chariot, and gave it a sudden\r\nviolent blow, then out of the chariot straight leaped a bull and a dog,\r\nwhich following him seemed to bait him: these also went northward, as\r\nthe former phenomena had done, the bull first holding his head downward,\r\nthen the dog, and then the chariot, till they all sunk down one after\r\nanother, about the same place, and just in the same manner as the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThese last meteors being vanished, there were several appearances like\r\nships, and other things, in the same place, and after that like order\r\nwith the former; but the relators were so surprised and pleased with\r\nwhat they had seen, especially with the bull and dog, that they did not\r\nmuch observe them; and besides, they were not so visible as the rest,\r\nthe night drawing on so fast, that they could not well discern them.\r\n\r\nThe whole time of the vision or representation lasted near an hour, and\r\nit was observable, that it was a very clear and a very calm evening, no\r\ncloud seen, no mist, nor any wind stirring. All the phenomena came out\r\nof the west, or south-west. They seemed very small, and afar off, and at\r\nfirst seemed like birds at a good distance, and then being come to the\r\nplace, where there was the appearance of a sea, they were discerned\r\nplainly in their just proportion. They all moved northwards, the ships,\r\nas appeared by their sails, went against the wind; they all sunk out of\r\nsight, much about the same place. When they disappeared, they did not\r\ndilate themselves, and become invisible as clouds do, but every the\r\nleast part of them, was as distinctly seen at the last, as they had been\r\nall along. The height of the scene on which these meteors moved, was\r\nabout as much above the horizon, as the sun is being half an hour high.\r\nOf the whole company, there was not any one but saw all those things, as\r\nabove written; all agreed in their notions and opinions about them, and\r\nwere all the while busie talking concerning what they saw, either much\r\ntroubled, or much pleased, according to the nature of the appearance.\r\n\r\nThe names of the persons who saw the foregoing passage:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Allye, a minister, living near the place.\r\n  Lieutenant Dunstervile and his son.\r\n  Mr. Grace, his son-in-law.\r\n  Lieutenant Dwine,       } Scholars and\r\n  Mr. Dwine, his brother, }  Travellers.\r\n  Mr. Christopher Hewelson.\r\n  Mr. Richard Foster.\r\n  Mr. Adam Hewelson.\r\n  Mr. Bates, a schoolmaster.\r\n  Mr. Larkin.\r\n  Mrs. Dunstervile,\r\n        her daughter-in-law,\r\n        her maiden-daughter.\r\n  Mr. Dwine’s daughter.\r\n  Mrs. Grace, her daughter.\r\n\r\nThis account was given by Mr. C. Hewelson and Mr. R. Foster, two of the\r\nbeforenamed spectators: and when it was related, a servant of Mr. C. H.,\r\nbeing present, did confirm the truth of it; affirming, that he and\r\nothers of the servants being then together at Poins-town, in another\r\nplace, saw the very same sights, and did very much wonder at them.\r\n_Finis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis wonderful wonder is worthy of preservation, for the very reason\r\nthat renders it scarcely worthy of remark. It was a practice, before the\r\nperiod when the preceding tract was printed, for partisans to fabricate\r\nand publish strange narratives in behalf of the side they pretended to\r\naid, with the further view of blackening or injuring those whom they\r\nopposed. Such stories were winked at as “pious frauds,” and found ready\r\nsale among the vulgar. As parties declined, the business of the writers\r\nand venders of such productions declined, and some among them of\r\ndesperate fortune resorted to similar manufactures on any subject likely\r\nto astonish the uninformed. The present “True Account” may be regarded\r\nas a curious specimen of this kind of forgery. The pamphlet was printed\r\nin London; the scene being laid in Ireland, it probably never reached\r\nPoins-town, and if it even travelled thither, the chance is that there\r\nwere only a few who could read it, and certainly none of those few were\r\ninterested in its contradiction. At the present time it is common in\r\nSomersetshire to hear a street-hawker crying, “A wonderful account of an\r\napparition that appeared in Hertfordshire,” and selling his papers to an\r\nadmiring crowd; the same fellow travelling into Hertfordshire, there\r\ncries the very same “Apparition that appeared in Somersetshire;” and his\r\nprinted account equally well authenticates it to a similarly constituted\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·80.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 3.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Winwaloe._\r\n\r\nThis saint is called Winwaloc, by father Cressy, and Winwaloke by father\r\nPorter.\r\n\r\nSt. Winwaloe’s father, named Fragan, or Fracan, was nearly related to\r\nCathoun, one of the kings or princes of Wales. In consequence of Saxon\r\ninvasions, Fragan emigrated from Wales to Armorica, where the spot he\r\ninhabited is “called from him to this day Plou-fragan.” Whether Winwaloe\r\nwas born there or in Wales is uncertain; but he was put under St. Budoc,\r\na British abbot of a monastery in Isleverte, near the isle of Brebat,\r\nfrom whence with other monks he travelled, till they built themselves a\r\nmonastery at Landevenech, three leagues from Brest.\r\n\r\nHe died in 529, at an advanced age.[74]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFather Cressy says, that St. Winwaloe worked many miracles; “among which\r\nthe most stupendous was his raising a young man to life.” He further\r\ntells, that “St. Patrick presented himself to him in a vision, with an\r\nangelicall brightnes, and having a golden diadem on his head,” and told\r\nhim he paid him a visit, to prevent Winwaloe, who desired to see him,\r\n“so tedious a journey by sea and land.” St. Patrick in this interview\r\nforetold St. Winwaloe so much, that the father of his monastery released\r\nhim with the other monks before-mentioned, that they might become\r\nhermits; for which purpose they travelled, till, wanting a ship, St.\r\nWinwaloe struck the sea with his staff, which opened a passage for them,\r\nand they walked through singing, and dryshod, “himself marching in the\r\nfront, the waters on both sides standing like walls.” Father Cressy\r\nsays, that St. Winwaloe never sat in the church; that “every day he\r\nrepeated the hundred and fifty psalms;” that to his bed he had neither\r\nfeathers nor clothes, “but instead of feathers he strewed under him\r\nnutshells, and instead of blankets, sand mingled with pebbles, and two\r\ngreat stones under his head;” that he wore the same clothes night and\r\nday; that his bread was made with half of barley and half of ashes; that\r\nhis other diet was a mixture of meal and cabbage without fat; and that\r\n“he took this refection once, only in two, and sometimes three dayes.”\r\n\r\nBesides other particulars, Cressy adds, that “a town in Shropshire,\r\ncalled even in the Saxons’ time Wenlock, (which seems a contraction from\r\nWinwaloc,) from him took its denomination.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_He vanquisheth the Devil, &c._\r\n\r\nSo father Porter entitles one of his particulars concerning St.\r\nWinwaloe, which he relates in his “Flowers of the Saincts” in these\r\nwords: “The devill envying soe great sanctitie, endeavoured with his\r\nhellish plotts to trouble and molest his pious labours, appeared unto\r\nhim as he prayed in his oratorie, in the most uglie and horrid shapes\r\nthat the master of wickednes could invent, vomitting out of his\r\ninfernall throate manie reprochfull wordes against him; when he nothing\r\ndismayed thereat, courageously proceeded in his devotions, and\r\nbrandishing the chief armes of life, the holy crosse, against that black\r\nmessenger of death, he compelled him to vanish away in confusion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Winwaloe and the cruel Goose._\r\n\r\nBishop Patrick, in his “Reflexions upon the Devotions of the Roman\r\nChurch,” cites from the latin “Acts of the Saints,” a miracle which is\r\nquite as miraculous as either of the preceding. “A sister of St.\r\nWinwaloc had her eye plucked out by a goose, as she was playing. St.\r\nWinwaloc was taught by an angel a sign whereby to know that goose from\r\nthe rest, and having cut it open, found the eye in its entrails,\r\npreserved by the power of God unhurt, and shining like a gem; which he\r\ntook and put it again in its proper place, and recovered his sister; and\r\nwas so kind also to the goose as to send it away alive, after it had\r\nbeen cut up, to the rest of the flock.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWINNOLD FAIR, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\nA correspondent, whose signature has before appeared, transmits the\r\nannexed communication concerning the hamlet of Winnold, and the fair\r\nheld there annually on this day.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nA priory, dedicated to St. Winwaloe, was founded by the family of the\r\nearls of Clare, before the seventh year of king John, (1206,) in a\r\nhamlet, (thence called, by corruption, the hamlet of Whinwall,\r\n_Winnold_, or _Wynhold_,) belonging to the parish of Wereham, in\r\nNorfolk, as a cell to the abbey of Mounstroll, of the order of St.\r\nBennet, in the diocese of Amiens, in France. In 1321, the abbot and\r\nconvent sold it to Hugh Scarlet, of London, who conveyed it to the lady\r\nElizabeth de Burso, the sister and coheir of Gilbert, earl of Clare, and\r\nshe afterwards gave it to West Dereham abbey, situate a few miles from\r\nWereham. At the general dissolution it was valued, with West Dereham, at\r\n252_l._ 12_s._ 11_d._ (Speed,) and 228_l._ (Dugdale.) Little of the\r\npriory is now remaining, except a part which is thought to have been the\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\nA fair for horses and cattle on this day, which was originally kept in\r\nthis hamlet of _Winnold_, has existed probably from the foundation of\r\nthe priory, as it is mentioned in the tenth of Edward III. (1337,) when\r\nthe priory and the fair were given to West Dereham abbey. Though the\r\nabbey and priory, as establishments, are annihilated, the fair (probably\r\nfrom its utility) has continued with reputation to the present day. Soon\r\nafter the dissolution, it was removed to the adjoining parish of\r\nWimbotsham, and continued to be held there till within the last thirty\r\nyears, when it was again removed a few miles further, to the market town\r\nof Downham, as a more convenient spot, and is now kept in a field there,\r\ncalled, for reasons unknown, “the Howdell,” and is at this time a very\r\nlarge horse and cattle fair; but, though it has undergone these\r\nremovals, it still retains its ancient, original appellation of\r\n“_Winnold Fair_.”[75] This fair, which is perhaps of greater antiquity\r\nthan any now kept in the kingdom, will probably preserve the memory of\r\n_St. Winnold_, in the west of Norfolk and the adjoining counties, for\r\ncenturies to come, above the whole host of his canonized brethren. He is\r\nalso commemorated, by the following traditional West Norfolk proverbial\r\ndistich:--\r\n\r\n    “First comes David, next comes Chad,\r\n    And then comes _Winnold_ as though he was mad.”\r\n\r\nnoticing the two previous days in March, (the first and second,) and in\r\nallusion to the prevalence of windy weather at this period. Whether _St.\r\nWinnold_, in the zenith of his fame, was remarkable for an irascibility\r\nof temper, I am not enabled to say; yet it rarely happens when the first\r\nfew days in March are not attended with such boisterous and tempestuous\r\nweather, generally from the north, that he might not improperly be\r\ntermed the Norfolk “Boreas.”\r\n\r\n  K.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·10.\r\n\r\n  [74] Butler.\r\n\r\n  [75] Blomfield’s Norfolk.

It is connected with the sports of childhood\r\nand with the pleasures of youth. We walk abroad to seek it; yet it is\r\nthe very emblem of home.

It is the season of their approach; therefore make\r\nready for their coming, and listen to the fair herald who is eloquent in\r\npraise of their eloquence. She tells us, in her “Flora Domestica,” and\r\nwho dare deny? that “flowers do speak a language, a clear and\r\nintelligible language: ask Mr. Wordsworth, for to him they have spoken,\r\nuntil they excited ‘thoughts that lie too deep for tears;’ ask Chaucer,\r\nfor he held companionship with them in the meadows; ask any of the\r\npoets, ancient or modern. Observe them, reader, love them, linger over\r\nthem; and ask your own heart, if they do not speak affection,\r\nbenevolence, and piety. None have better understood the language of\r\nflowers than the simple-minded peasant-poet, Clare, whose volumes are\r\nlike a beautiful country, diversified with woods, meadows, heaths, and\r\nflower-gardens:\r\n\r\n    Bowing adorers of the gale,\r\n    Ye cowslips delicately pale,\r\n      Upraise your loaded stems;\r\n    Unfold your cups in splendour, speak!\r\n    Who decked you with that ruddy streak,\r\n      And gilt your golden gems?\r\n\r\n    Violets, sweet tenants of the shade,\r\n    In purple’s richest pride arrayed,\r\n      Your errand here fulfil;\r\n    Go bid the artist’s simple stain\r\n    Your lustre imitate, in vain,\r\n      And match your Maker’s skill.\r\n\r\n    Daisies, ye flowers of lowly birth,\r\n    Embroiderers of the carpet earth,\r\n      That stud the velvet sod;\r\n    Open to spring’s refreshing air,\r\n    In sweetest smiling bloom declare\r\n      Your Maker, and my God.”\r\n\r\n  _Clare._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·69.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 6.~\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·22.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Merriment in March.~]\r\n\r\n    The wooden bird on horseback showing,\r\n    By beat of drum with pipers blowing,\r\n    They troop along huzzaing, tooting,\r\n    To hold their annual game of shooting.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nThis is a French sport, which, according to a print from whence the\r\npresent representation was taken, is peculiar to the month of March. The\r\ninscription on the engraving just mentioned, is--\r\n\r\nMARS.\r\n\r\nREJOUISSANCES DU PAPEGUAY.\r\n\r\n    _Les Triomphes d’un Conquérant\r\n    Font voir plus de magnificence:\r\n    Mais au défaut de l’opulence,\r\n    Ceux cy ne coutent point de Sang._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Papeguay,” _Papegai_, or _Papegaut_, is “a wooden bird to shoot at,\r\na shaw fowl.”[76] This wooden bird in the print is carried on a pole by\r\nthe man on horseback, attended by those who are about to partake of the\r\nsport, and preceded by music. It seems to be a rustic amusement, and,\r\nperhaps, some light may be thrown on it by the following account from\r\nMiss Plumtre’s “Residence in France.” She says, that in connection with\r\nthe church of St. John, at Aix, which formerly belonged to the knights\r\nof St. John of Jerusalem, there is a ceremony which used to be called\r\n_Le Bravade de St. Jean d’Aix_, instituted in the year 1272, on the\r\nreturn of the army which had followed Louis IX. or St. Louis, in his\r\nlast expedition to Egypt and the Holy-land. According to Miss Plumptre,\r\nit was held on the eve of St. John the Baptist. A large bird of any kind\r\nwas tethered in a field without the town, so that it could fly only to a\r\ncertain height, and the youth of the place, those only of the second\r\norder of nobles, took aim at him with their bows and arrows in presence\r\nof all the nobility, gentry, and magistracy. He who killed the bird was\r\nking of the archers for the year ensuing, and the two who had gone the\r\nnearest after him were appointed his lieutenant and standard-bearer; he\r\nalso nominated several other officers from among the competitors. The\r\ncompany then returned into the town, the judges of the contest marching\r\nfirst, followed by the victors: bonfires were made in several parts,\r\nround which the people danced, while the king and his officers went from\r\none to the other till they had danced by turns at them all. The same\r\ndiversions were repeated the following day; and both evenings the king,\r\nat the conclusion of them, was attended home by his officers and a\r\nconcourse of people, among whom he distributed largesses to a\r\nconsiderable amount.\r\n\r\nAt the first institution of this ceremony, the intention of which was to\r\nincite the young men to render themselves expert marksmen, the king\r\nenjoyed very extensive privileges during the year; but in latter times\r\nthey had been reduced to those of wearing a large silver medal which was\r\npresented to him at his accession, of enjoying the right of shooting\r\nwherever he chose, of partaking in the grand mass celebrated by the\r\norder of Malta at their church on the festival of St. John, and of being\r\nexempted from lodging soldiers, and paying what was called _Le droit de\r\npiquet_, a tax upon all the flour brought into the town. After the\r\ninvention of the arquebuse, instead of shooting at a live bird with\r\narrows, they fired at a wooden bird upon a pole, and he who could bring\r\nit down was appointed king: any one who brought it down two years\r\ntogether was declared emperor, and in that quality exempted for life\r\nfrom all municipal taxes. This ceremony continued till the revolution.\r\n\r\nIt appears from hence that this custom of shooting at a wooden bird on\r\nSt. John’s eve is very similar to that which the engraving represents,\r\nas the merriment of the _Papeguay_, or wooden bird, belonging to the\r\nmonth of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anecdotes of_\r\n\r\nBROWNE WILLIS,\r\n\r\n_The Antiquarian_.\r\n\r\nTo the portrait of this eminent antiquary at p. 194, is annexed the day\r\nof his birth, in 1682, and the day whereon he died, in 1760. That\r\nengraving of him is after an etching made “in 1781, at the particular\r\nrequest of the Rev. William Cole, from a drawing made by the Rev.\r\nMichael Tyson, from an original painting by Dahl.” Mr. Cole, in a letter\r\nto Mr. Steevens, speaks of the etching thus: “The copy pleases me\r\ninfinitely; nothing can be more exact and like the copy I sent, and\r\nwhich, as well as I can recollect, is equally so to the original.\r\nNotwithstanding the distance of time when Dahl drew his portrait and\r\nthat in which I knew him, and the strange metamorphose that age and\r\ncaprice had made in his figure, yet I could easily trace some lines and\r\ntraits of what Mr. Dahl had given of him.” Agreeably to the promise\r\nalready given, some particulars remain to be added concerning the\r\ndistinguished individual it represents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrowne Willis was grandson of Dr. Thomas Willis, the most celebrated\r\nphysician of his time, and the eldest son of Thomas Willis, esq., of\r\nBletchley, in the county of Bucks. When at Westminster school, “the\r\nneighbouring abbey drew his admiration: here he loved to walk and\r\ncontemplate. The solemnity of the building, the antique appearance, the\r\nmonuments, filled his whole mind. He delighted himself in reading old\r\ninscriptions. Here he first imbibed the love of antiquities, and the\r\nimpression grew indelible.” At seventeen he was admitted a gentleman\r\ncommoner of Christ Church college; in 1705 he represented the town of\r\nBuckingham in parliament, where he constantly attended, and often sat on\r\ncommittees; in 1707 he married; in 1718 he became an active member of\r\nthe society of antiquaries; in 1720 the university of Oxford conferred\r\non him the degree of M. A. by diploma; and in 1740 he received from it\r\nthe degree of LL.D. On the 11th of February, 1760, he was buried in\r\nFenny Stratford chapel, an edifice which, though he founded it himself,\r\nhe was accustomed to attribute to the munificence of others, “who were\r\nin reality only contributors.” Of his numerous antiquarian works the\r\nprincipal are “Notitia Parliamentaria, or an History of the Counties,\r\nCities, and Boroughs in England and Wales,” 3 vols. 8vo. “Mitred Abbies,\r\n&c.” 2 vols. 8vo. “Cathedrals of England,” 3 vols. 4to. and 4 vols.\r\n8vo.--He attained a most extensive erudition in the topographical,\r\narchitectural, and numismatic remains of England by devoting his life to\r\ntheir study, which he pursued with unabated ardour, uncheered by the\r\ncommon hope of deriving even a sufficiency from his various publications\r\nto defray their expenses. In a letter to his friend Dr. Ducarel, when he\r\nwas seventy-four years of age, he says, “I am 100_l._ out of pocket by\r\nwhat I have printed; except my octavo of Parliaments, which brought me\r\n15_l._ profit, though I gave it all away, and above 20_l._ more to build\r\nBuckingham tower steeple; and now, as I hoped for subscription to this\r\nbook, (his last work, the History of the Town and Hundred of Buckingham)\r\nam like to have half the impression on my hands. Sold only 69 copies, of\r\nwhich to gentlemen of Buckinghamshire, only 28.” In the same year, 1756,\r\nhe writes to one of his daughters, “I have worked for nothing; nay,\r\nexcept in one book, have been out of pocket, and at great expense in\r\nwhat I printed.” He considerably impaired his fortune by the\r\nscrupulosity and magnitude of his researches and collections, which he\r\npersevered in till he grew so weak and infirm that he had not strength\r\nto reach down and turn over his books, or draw up particulars with his\r\nown hands. Yet even then, in his seventy-eighth year, he amused himself\r\nby inquiries concerning “Bells,” and obtained returns of the contents of\r\nbelfries in nearly six hundred parishes of the county of Lincoln, which\r\nhe entered in the “Parochiale Anglicanum.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn account of Dr. Willis was read to the society of antiquaries, by his\r\nfriend Dr. Ducarel, who sums up his character in these words:--“This\r\nlearned society, of which he was one of the first revivers, and one of\r\nthe most industrious members, can bear me witness that he was\r\nindefatigable in his researches; for his works were of the most\r\nlaborious kind. But what enabled him, besides his unwearied diligence,\r\nto bring them to perfection, was, his being blessed with a most\r\nexcellent memory. He had laid so good a foundation of learning, that,\r\nthough he had chiefly conversed with records, and other matters of\r\nantiquity which are not apt to form a polite style, yet he expressed\r\nhimself, in all his compositions, in an easy and genteel manner. He was,\r\nindeed, one of the first who placed our ecclesiastical history and\r\nantiquities upon a firm basis, by grounding them upon records and\r\nregisters; which, in the main, are unexceptionable authorities. During\r\nthe course of his long life, he had visited every cathedral in England\r\nand Wales, except Carlisle; which journeys he used to call his\r\n_pilgrimages_. In his friendships none more sincere and hearty; always\r\ncommunicative, and ever ready to assist every studious and inquisitive\r\nperson: this occasioned an acquaintance and connection between him and\r\nall his learned contemporaries. For his mother, the university of\r\nOxford, he always expressed the most awful respect and the warmest\r\nesteem. As to his piety and moral qualifications, he was strictly\r\nreligious, without any mixture of superstition or enthusiasm, and quite\r\nexemplary in this respect: and of this, his many public works, in\r\nbuilding, repairing, and beautifying of churches, are so many standing\r\nevidences. He was charitable to the poor and needy; just and upright\r\ntowards all men. In a word, no one ever deserved better of the society\r\nof antiquaries; if industry and an incessant application, throughout a\r\nlong life, to the investigating the antiquities of this national church\r\nand state, is deserving of their countenance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Every-Day Book_ possesses an unprinted letter written\r\nby Dr. Willis to the learned bishop Tanner, when chancellor of Norwich.\r\nA copy of this letter is subjoined, together with a fac-simile of its\r\ndate and the place from whence it was addressed, in Dr. Willis’s\r\nhand-writing, and a further fac-simile of his autograph at the\r\nconclusion. The epistle is written on a proof impression of “The\r\nIchnography or Platform of the Cathedral Church of Christ Church in\r\nOxford,” one of the plates in Dr. Willis’s “Cathedrals,” relative to\r\nwhich, as well as other works, he sought information from his\r\ndistinguished brother antiquary. This letter is a good specimen of Dr.\r\nWillis’s epistolary style of communication, and of that minuteness of\r\ninvestigation which is indispensable to antiquarian labours: it likewise\r\ntestifies his solicitude for the education of his eldest son “Tom,” who\r\ndied four years before himself, and expresses a natural desire that Dr.\r\nTanner would visit his ecclesiastical foundation at Fenny Stratford.\r\n\r\n  _Copy._\r\n\r\n  To\r\n\r\n  The Rev.

As to the\r\nPrebendarys of Lincoln, since I have wrote 5 or 6 letters to the Bishop\r\nwithout an answer, I am obliged to be contented. I should be glad of\r\nThomas Davies’s Epitaph from Bexwell. He was vicar of Siston co:\r\nLeicester and A.M. as my Account says. I have only 4 or 5 to enquire\r\nafter that I shall be so eager to find, viz. Joshua Clark (Prebendary)\r\nof Cester, who died 1712. I have wrote to his 2 successors and cannot\r\nhear one word: The others I want are John Davenport, Mr. Davies’s\r\npredecessor in Sutton Prebend, and Henry Morland or Merland who died\r\nabout 1704; but I would more particularly enquire after Thomas Stanhope,\r\nwho, about 1668, was installed into the Prebend of Sutton cum\r\nBuckingham--I shall be thankfull for any Information of him, as I am of\r\nall opportunitys of hearing from you, and design to lay by your papers\r\nof Ely to send you again: but I am teized sadly about Bishop Lloyd of\r\nNorwich’s great Seal, and the circumscription round it, and have had 2\r\nletters this week on that account: what my importunate correspondent\r\nwants is, the circle of writing round the Episcopal Seal in which he\r\nwrote his name Gulielimus: I am ashamed to repeat this Impertinence to\r\nwhich I pray a quick answer, especialy as to another subject of the\r\ngreatest consequence of all, which is about placing my Eldest Son at\r\nChrist-church, where I design to make him a commoner, for he must study\r\nhard--I am to consult about a Tutor, and would gladly have one you have\r\na confidence in; there are recommended Mr. Allen, Mr. Bateman, and Mr.\r\nWard; now if you can answer for ever an one of these, and that he will,\r\non your friendshipp or the Dean’s, have a more particular eye to Tom,\r\nwhom I dont design to continue above 2 or 3 years at most, I shall be\r\nvery thankfull for your recommendation. And so pray dear Mr. Chancellor\r\nwrite soon and advise mee, but I hope your affairs will call you to\r\nOxford, and that you will take mee in your way and see Stratford\r\nchapell, which is very near, and your ever obliged and devoted Servant\r\nin all things,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B Willis]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrowne Willis’s letter is franked by Dr. Richard Willis, bishop of\r\nWinchester, who was translated to that see from the bishopric of\r\nSalisbury, in 1723.

Bush\r\nhe was going to Bristol on _St. Austin’s-day_ to see the cathedral, it\r\n_being the dedication day_.” It is added, that “he would lodge in no\r\nhouse at Bath but the Abbey-house: he said, when he was told that Wells\r\ncathedral was 800 years old, there was not a stone of it left 500 years\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nMiss Talbot, “in an unprinted letter to a lady of first-rate quality,”\r\ndated from the rectory house of St. James’s parish, (Westminster,)\r\nJanuary 2, 1739, humorously describes him and says, “As by his little\r\nknowledge of the world, he has ruined a fine estate, that was, when he\r\nfirst had it, worth 2000_l._ per annum, his present circumstances oblige\r\nhim to an odd-headed kind of frugality, that shows itself in the\r\nslovenliness of his dress, and makes him think London much too\r\nextravagant an abode for his daughters; at the same time that his zeal\r\nfor antiquities makes him think an old copper farthing very cheaply\r\nbought for a guinea, and any journey properly undertaken that will bring\r\nhim to some old cathedral _on the saint’s day_ to which it was\r\ndedicated.” Further on, Miss Talbot adds, relative to Dr. Willis on St.\r\nGeorge’s day, “To honour last Sunday _as it deserved_, after having run\r\nabout all the morning to _all the St. George’s churches_, whose\r\ndifference of hours permitted him, he came to dine with us in a tie-wig,\r\nthat exceeds indeed all description. ’Tis a tie-wig (the very colour of\r\nit is inexpressible) that he has had, he says, these nine years; and of\r\nlate it has lain by at his barber’s, never to be put on but once a year,\r\nin honour of the Bishop of Gloucester’s (Benson) birth-day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of Dr. Willis are in Mr. Nichols’s “Literary\r\nAnecdotes,” from which abundant depository of facts, the particulars\r\nhereafter related are likewise extracted, with a view to the information\r\nof general readers. On the same ground, that gentleman’s collection is\r\nmentioned; for--it is not to be presumed that any real inquirer into the\r\n“Literary History” of the last or the preceding century can be ignorant,\r\nthat Mr. Nichols’s invaluable work is an indispensable assistant to\r\nevery diligent investigator. It is certainly the fullest, and is\r\nprobably the most accurate, source that can be consulted for\r\nbiographical facts during that period, and is therefore quoted by name,\r\nas all authors ought to be by every writer or editor who is influenced\r\nby grateful feelings towards his authorities, and honest motives towards\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Willis was whimsically satirized in the following verses by Dr.\r\nDarrell of Lillington Darrell.\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT BALLAD.\r\n\r\nTo the Tune of _Chevy-Chace_.\r\n\r\n    Whilome there dwelt near Buckingham,\r\n        That famous county town,\r\n    At a known place, hight Whaddon Chace,\r\n        A ’squire of odd renown.--\r\n\r\n    A Druid’s sacred form he bore,\r\n        His robes a girdle bound:\r\n    Deep vers’d he was in ancient lore,\r\n        In customs old, profound.\r\n\r\n    A stick torn from that hallow’d tree\r\n        Where Chaucer us’d to sit,\r\n    And tell his tales with leering glee,\r\n        Supports his tott’ring feet.\r\n\r\n    High on a hill his mansion stood\r\n        But gloomy dark within;\r\n    Here mangled books, as bones and blood\r\n        Lie in a giant’s den.\r\n\r\n    Crude, undigested, half-devour’d,\r\n        On groaning shelves they’re thrown;\r\n    Such manuscripts no eye could read,\r\n        Nor hand write--but his own.\r\n\r\n    No prophet he, like Sydrophel,\r\n        Could future times explore;\r\n    But what had happen’d, he could tell,\r\n        Five hundred years and more.\r\n\r\n    A walking Alm’nack he appears,\r\n        Stept from some mouldy wall,\r\n    Worn out of use thro’ dust and years,\r\n        Like scutcheons in his hall.\r\n\r\n    His boots were made of that cow’s hide,\r\n        By Guy of Warwick slain;\r\n    Time’s choicest gifts, aye to abide\r\n        Among the chosen train.\r\n\r\n    Who first receiv’d the precious boon,\r\n        We’re at a loss to learn,\r\n    By Spelman, Camden, Dugdale, worn,\r\n        And then they came to Hearne.\r\n\r\n    Hearne strutted in them for a while;\r\n        And then, as lawful heir,\r\n    Browne claim’d and seiz’d the precious spoil,\r\n        The spoil of many a year.\r\n\r\n    His car himself he did provide,\r\n        To stand in double stead;\r\n    That it should carry him alive,\r\n        And bury him when dead.\r\n\r\n    By rusty coins old kings he’d trace,\r\n        And know their air and mien:\r\n    King Alfred he knew well by face,\r\n        Tho’ George he ne’er had seen.\r\n\r\n    This wight th’ outside of churches lov’d,\r\n        Almost unto a sin;\r\n    Spires Gothic of more use he prov’d\r\n        Than pulpits are within.\r\n\r\n    Of use, no doubt, when high in air,\r\n        A wand’ring bird they’ll rest,\r\n    Or with a Bramin’s holy care,\r\n        Make lodgments for its nest.\r\n\r\n    Ye Jackdaws, that are us’d to talk,\r\n        Like us of human race,\r\n    When nigh you see Browne Willis walk\r\n        Loud chatter forth his praise.\r\n\r\n    Whene’er the fatal day shall come,\r\n        For come, alas! it must,\r\n    When this good ’squire must stay at home,\r\n        And turn to antique dust;\r\n\r\n    The solemn dirge, ye Owls, prepare,\r\n        Ye Bats, more hoarsly screek;\r\n    Croak, all ye Ravens, round the bier,\r\n        And all ye Church-mice squeak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. Cole says, “Browne Willis had a most passionate regard for\r\nthe town of Buckingham, which he represented in Parliament one session,\r\nor part of a session. This he showed on every occasion, and particularly\r\nin endeavouring to get a new charter for them, and to get the bailiff\r\nchanged into a mayor; by unwearied application in getting the assizes\r\nheld once a year there, and procuring the archdeacon to hold his\r\nvisitations, and also the bishop there, as often as possible; by\r\npromoting the building of a jail in the town; and, above all, by\r\nprocuring subscriptions, and himself liberally contributing, to the\r\nraising the tower of the church 24 feet higher. As he cultivated an\r\ninterest opposite to the Temple family, they were never upon good terms;\r\nand made verses upon each other on their several foibles.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same Mr. Cole, by way of notes on the preceding poem, relates the\r\nfollowing anecdotes of Dr. Willis, which are subjoined to it by Mr.\r\nNichols. “Mr. Willis never mentioned the adored town of Buckingham\r\nwithout the addition of _county-town_. His person and dress were so\r\nsingular, that, though a gentleman of 1000_l._ per annum, he has often\r\nbeen taken for a beggar. An old leathern girdle or belt, always\r\nsurrounded the two or three coats he wore, and over them an old blue\r\ncloak. He wrote the worst hand of any man in England,--such as he could\r\nwith difficulty read himself, and what no one, except his old\r\ncorrespondents, could decipher. His boots, which he almost always\r\nappeared in, were not the least singular part of his dress. I suppose it\r\nwill not be a falsity to say they were forty years old, patched and\r\nvamped up at various times. They are all in wrinkles, and don’t come up\r\nabove half way of his legs. He was often called in the neighbourhood,\r\n_Old Wrinkle Boots_. They are humorously historized in the above poem.\r\nThe chariot of Mr. Willis was so singular, that from it he was called\r\nhimself, _The old Chariot_. It was his wedding chariot, and had his arms\r\non brass plates about it, not unlike a coffin, and painted black. He was\r\nas remarkable probably for his love to the walls and structures of\r\nchurches, as for his variance with the clergy in his neighbourhood. He\r\nbuilt, by subscription, the chapel at Fenny Stratford; repaired\r\nBletchley church very elegantly, at a great expense; repaired\r\nBow-Brickill church, desecrated and not used for a century, and added\r\ngreatly to the height of Buckingham church tower. He was not well\r\npleased with any one, who in talking of, or with him, did not call him\r\n_Squire_. I wrote these notes when I was out of humour with him for some\r\nof his tricks. God rest his soul, and forgive us all. Amen!” Cole and\r\nWillis were friends. Our antiquary presented a living to Mr. Cole, who\r\nappears to have been very useful to him as a transcriber, seeker after\r\ndates, and collector of odds and ends. In erudition, discrimination,\r\narrangement, and literary powers, Cole was at an immense distance from\r\nhim. Dr. Willis’s writing he calls “the worst hand of any man in\r\nEngland.” This was not the fact. Cole’s “hand” was formal, and as plain\r\nas print; it was the only qualification he possessed over Dr. Willis,\r\nwhose writing is certainly peculiar, and yet, where it seems difficult,\r\nis readily decipherable by persons accustomed to varieties of method,\r\nand is to be read with ease by any one at all acquainted with its\r\nuniform character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Dr. Willis’s personal appearance, Mr. Cole says, in a letter to Mr.\r\nSteevens, “When I knew him first, about 35 years ago, he had more the\r\nappearance of a mumping beggar than of a gentleman; and the most like\r\nresemblance of his figure that I can recollect among old prints, is that\r\nof Old Hobson the Cambridge carrier. He then, as always, was dressed in\r\nan old slouched hat, more brown than black, a weather-beaten large wig,\r\nthree or four old-fashioned coats, all tied round by a leathern belt,\r\nand over all an old blue cloak, lined with black fustian, which he told\r\nme he had new made when he was elected member for the town of Buckingham\r\nabout 1707.” Cole retained affection for his memory: he adds “I have\r\nstill by me as relics, this cloak and belt, which I purchased of his\r\nservant.” Cole’s letter with this account he consented that Mr. Steevens\r\nshould allow Mr. Nichols to use, adding that he gave the permission “on\r\na presumption, that there was nothing disrespectful to the memory of Mr.\r\nWillis, for what I said I don’t recollect.” On this, Mr. Nichols\r\nremarks, “The _disrespect_ was certainly levelled at the mere external\r\nfoibles of the respectable antiquary, whose goodness of heart, and\r\ngeneral spirit of philanthropy were amply sufficient to bear him out in\r\nthose whimsical peculiarities of dress, which were irresistible sources\r\nof ridicule.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCole, however, may be suspected to have somewhat exaggerated, when he so\r\ngeneralized his description of Dr. Willis, as to affirm that “he had\r\nmore the appearance of a mumping beggar than of a gentleman.” Miss\r\nTalbot, of whom it was said by the duchess of Somerset to lady\r\nLuxborough, “she censures nobody, she despises nobody, and whilst her\r\nown life is a pattern of goodness, she does not exclaim with bitterness\r\nagainst vice,” seems, in her letter to the lady of quality before cited,\r\nto have painted Dr. Willis to the life. She says, “With one of the\r\nhonestest hearts in the world, he has one of the oddest heads that ever\r\ndropped out of the moon. Extremely well versed in coins, he knows hardly\r\nany thing of mankind, and you may judge what kind of education such an\r\none is likely to give to four girls, who have had no female directress\r\nto polish their behaviour, or any other habitation than a great rambling\r\nmansion-house in a country village.”\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed, notwithstanding, to the credit of Mr. Cole, that she\r\nadds, “He is the dirtiest creature in the world;” but then, with such a\r\ncharacter from the mouth of a fine lady, the sex and breeding of the\r\naffirmant must be taken into the account, especially as she assigns her\r\nreasons. “It is quite disagreeable,” she says, “to sit by him at table:\r\nyet he makes one suit of clothes serve him at least two years, and then\r\nhis great coat has been transmitted down, I believe, from generation to\r\ngeneration, ever since Noah.” Thus there may be something on the score\r\nof want of fashion in her estimate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Talbot’s account of Dr. Willis’s daughters is admirable. “Browne\r\ndistinguishes his four daughters into the _lions_ and the _lambs_. The\r\n_lambs_ are very good and very insipid; they were in town about ten\r\ndays, that ended the beginning of last week; and now the _lions_ have\r\nsucceeded them, who have a little spirit of rebellion, that makes them\r\ninfinitely more agreeable than their sober sisters. The _lambs_ went to\r\nevery church Browne pleased every day; the _lions_ came to St. _James’s_\r\nchurch on St. _George’s_ day, (which to Browne was downright heresy, for\r\nreasons just related.) The _lambs_ thought of no higher entertainment\r\nthan going to see some collections of shells; the _lions_ would see\r\nevery thing, and go every where. The _lambs_ dined here one day, were\r\nthought good awkward girls, and then were laid out of our thoughts for\r\never. The _lions_ dined with us on Sunday, and were so extremely\r\ndiverting, that we spent all yesterday morning, and are engaged to spend\r\nall this, in entertaining them, and going to a comedy, that, I think,\r\nhas no ill-nature in it; for the simplicity of these girls has nothing\r\nblameable in it, and the contemplation of such unassisted nature is\r\ninfinitely amusing. They follow Miss Jenny’s rule, of never being\r\nstrange in a strange place; yet in them this is not boldness.” Miss\r\nTalbot says, she could give “a thousand traits of the _lions_,” but she\r\nmerely adds, “I wondered to have heard no remarks on the prince and\r\nprincess; their remarks on every thing else are admirable. As they sat\r\nin the drawing-room before dinner, one of them called to Mr. Secker, ‘I\r\nwish you would give me a glass of sack!’ The bishop of Oxford (Secker)\r\ncame in, and one of them broke out very abruptly, ‘But we heard every\r\nword of the sermon where we sat; and a very good sermon it was,’ added\r\nshe, with a decisive nod. The bishop of Gloucester gave them tickets to\r\ngo to a play; and one of them took great pains to repeat to him, till he\r\nheard it, ‘I would not rob you, but I know you are very rich, and can\r\nafford it; for I ben’t covetous, indeed I an’t covetous.’ Poor girls!\r\ntheir father will make them go out of town to-morrow, and they begged\r\nvery hard that we would all join in entreating him to let them stay a\r\nfortnight, as their younger sisters have done; but all our entreaties\r\nwere in vain, and to-morrow the poor _lions_ return to their den in the\r\nstage-coach. Indeed, in his birth-day tie-wig he looked so like ‘the\r\nfather’ in the farce Mrs. Secker was so diverted with, that I wished a\r\nthousand times for the invention of Scapin and I would have made no\r\nscruple of assuming the character, and inspiring my friends with the\r\nlaudable spirit of rebellion. I have picked out some of the dullest of\r\ntheir traits to tell you. They pressed us extremely to come and\r\nbreakfast with them at their lodgings, four inches square, in\r\nChapel-street, at eight o’clock in the morning, and bring a stay-maker\r\nand the bishop of Gloucester with us. We put off the engagement till\r\neleven, sent the stay-maker to measure them at nine, and Mrs. Secker and\r\nI went and found the ladies quite undressed; so that, instead of taking\r\nthem to Kensington Gardens, as we promised, we were forced, for want of\r\ntime, to content ourselves with carrying them round Grosvenor-square\r\ninto the Ring, where, for want of better amusement, they were fain to\r\nfall upon the basket of dirty sweetmeats and cakes that an old woman is\r\nalways teizing you with there, which they had nearly despatched in a\r\ncouple of rounds. It were endless to tell you all that has inexpressibly\r\ndiverted me in their behaviour and conversation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols contents himself with calling Miss Talbot’s letter “a very\r\npleasant one”--it is delightfully pleasant: that its description may not\r\nbe received in an ill sense, he carefully remarks, that “it would be\r\nthought highly satirical in any body else,” but he roguishly affirms\r\nthat “Dr. Taylor could tell a thousand such stories of Browne Willis and\r\nhis family;” and then he selects another. “In the summer of 1740, after\r\nMr. Baker’s death, his executor came to take possession of the effects,\r\nand lived for some time in his chambers at college. Here Browne Willis\r\nwaited upon him to see some of the MSS. or books; and after a long\r\nvisit, to find and examine what he wanted, the old bed-maker of the\r\nrooms came in; when the gentleman said, ‘What noise was that I heard\r\njust as you opened the door?’ (he had heard the _rustling of\r\nsilk_)--‘Oh!’ says Browne Willis, ‘it is only one of my daughters that I\r\nleft on the staircase. This, we may suppose, was a _lamb_, by her\r\npatient waiting; else a _lion_ would have been better able to resist any\r\npetty rudenesses.’” Afterwards we have another “trait” of the same kind:\r\n“Once after long teasing, the young ladies prevailed on him to give them\r\na London jaunt; unluckily the lodgings were (unknown to them) at an\r\nundertaker’s, the irregular and late hours of whose business was not\r\nvery agreeable to the young ladies: but they comforted themselves with\r\nthe thoughts of the pleasure they should have during their stay in town;\r\nwhen to their great surprise and grief, as soon as they had got their\r\nbreakfast, the old family coach rumbled to the door, and the father bid\r\nthem get in, as he had done the business about which he came to town.”\r\nPoor girls!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. John Kynaston, M.A., fellow of Brazen-nose college, who\r\nhad seen the preceding paragraphs, writes to Mr. Nichols, “Your\r\nanecdotes of the _lions_ and the _lambs_ have entertained me\r\nprodigiously, as I well knew the grizzly sire of both. Browne Willis was\r\nindeed an original. I met with him at Mr. Cartwright’s, at Aynhoe, in\r\nNorthamptonshire, in 1753, where I was at that time chaplain to the\r\nfamily, and curate of the parish. Browne came here on a visit of a week\r\nthat summer. He looked for all the world like an old portrait of the era\r\nof queen Elizabeth, that had walked down out of its frame. He was, too\r\ntruly, the very dirty figure Miss Talbot describes him to be; which,\r\nwith the antiquity of his dress, rendered him infinitely formidable to\r\nall the children in the parish. He often called upon me at the parsonage\r\nhouse, when I happened not to dine in the family; having a great, and as\r\nit seemed, a very favourite point to carry, which was no less than to\r\npersuade me to follow his example, and to turn all my thoughts and\r\nstudies to _venerable antiquity;_ he deemed _that_ the _summum bonum_,\r\nthe height of all human felicity. I used to entertain Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCartwright highly, by detailing to them Browne’s arguments to debauch me\r\nfrom the pursuit of polite literature, and such studies as were most\r\nagreeable to my turn and taste; and by parcelling out every morning\r\nafter prayers (we had daily prayers at eleven in the church) the\r\nprogress Browne had made the day before in the arts of seduction. I\r\namused him with such answers as I thought best suited to his\r\nhobby-horse, till I found he was going to leave us; and then, by a\r\nstroke or two of spirited raillery, lost his warm heart and his advice\r\nfor ever. My egging him on served us, however, for a week’s excellent\r\nentertainment, amid the dulness and sameness of a country situation. He\r\nrepresented me at parting, to Mr. Cartwright, as one incorrigible, and\r\nlost beyond all hopes of recovery to every thing truly valuable in\r\nlearning, by having unfortunately let slip that I preferred, and feared\r\nI ever should prefer, one page of Livy or Tacitus, Sallust or Cæsar, to\r\nall the monkish writers, with Bede at the head of them.\r\n\r\n    -------“quot sunt quotve fuerunt\r\n    Aut quotquot aliis erunt in annis.\r\n    _Sic explicit Historiola de_ Brownio Willisio!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Itinerary of Browne Willis “in search of the _antique_,” must have\r\nbeen excessively amusing. “Among the innumerable stories that are told\r\nof him, and the difficulties and rebuffs he met with in his favourite\r\npursuits, the following may suffice as a specimen:--One day he desired\r\nhis neighbour, Mr. Lowndes, to go with him to one of his tenants, whose\r\nold habitation he wanted to view. A coach driving into the farm-yard\r\nsufficiently alarmed the family, who betook themselves to close\r\nquarters; when Browne Willis, spying a woman at a window, thrust his\r\nhead out of the coach, and cried out, ‘Woman, I ask if you have got no\r\n_arms_ in your house.’ As the transaction happened to be in the\r\nrebellion of 1745, when searches for arms were talked of, the woman was\r\nstill less pleased with her visitor, and began to talk accordingly. When\r\nMr. Lowndes had enjoyed enough of this absurdity, he said, ‘Neighbour,\r\nit is rather cold sitting here; if you will let me put my head out, I\r\ndare say we shall do our business much better.’ So the late Dr. Newcome,\r\ngoing in his coach through one of the villages near Cambridge, and\r\nseeing an old mansion, called out to an old woman, ‘Woman, is this a\r\n_religious house_?’ ‘I don’t know what you mean by a religious house,’\r\nretorted the woman; ‘but I believe the house is as honest an house as\r\nany of yours at Cambridge.’”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, “Riding over Mendip or Chedder, he came to a church\r\nunder the hill, the steeple just rising above them, and near twenty\r\nacres of water belonging to Mr. Cox. He asked a countryman the church’s\r\nname--‘Emburrough.’ ‘When was it dedicated?’ ‘Talk English, or don’t\r\ntalk at all.’ ‘When is the revel or wake?’ The fellow thought, as there\r\nwas a match at quarter-staff for a hat in the neighbourhood, he\r\nintended to make one; and, struck with his mean appearance besides,\r\nchallenged him in a rude way, and so they parted. This anomalous\r\nproposition must have been as embarrassing as the situation presumed in\r\nthe play, ‘Dr. Pangloss in a tandem, with a terrier between his legs!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a very characteristic anecdote of Browne Willis, and Humfrey\r\nWanley, a man of singular celebrity, and library keeper to the literary\r\nearl of Oxford: it is of Wanley’s own relation in his Diary. “Feb. 9,\r\n1725-6. Mr. Browne Willis came, wanting to peruse one of Holmes’s MSS.\r\nmarked L, and did so; and also L 2, L 3, and L 4, without finding what\r\nhe expected. He would have explained to me his design in his intended\r\nbook about our cathedrals; but I said I was about my lord’s necessary\r\nbusiness, and had not leisure to spend upon any matter foreign to that.\r\nHe wanted the liberty to look over Holmes’s MSS. and indeed over all\r\nthis library, that he might collect materials for amending his former\r\nbooks, and putting forth new ones. I signified to him that it would be\r\ntoo great a work; and that I, having business appointed me by my lord,\r\nwhich required much despatch, could not in such a case attend upon him.\r\nHe would have teazed me here this whole afternoon, but I would not\r\nsuffer him. At length he departed in great anger, and I hope to be rid\r\nof him.” It is reported of the lion, that he is scared by the braying of\r\nthe least noble of the beasts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Gibberd performed the “last offices” at the funeral of his\r\nfriend Dr. Willis, who parted from life “without the usual agonies of\r\ndeath.” This gentleman says, “He breathed almost his last with the most\r\nearnest and ardent wishes for my prosperity: ‘Ah! Mr. Gibberd, God bless\r\nyou for ever, Mr. Gibberd!’ were almost the last words of my dying\r\nfriend.” Mr. Gibberd’s character of him may close these notices. “He was\r\nstrictly religious, without any mixture of superstition or enthusiasm.\r\nThe honour of God was his prime view in almost every action of his life.\r\nHe was a constant frequenter of the church, and never absented himself\r\nfrom the holy communion; and as to the reverence he had for places more\r\nimmediately set apart for religious duties, it is needless to mention\r\nwhat his many public works, in building, repairing, and beautifying\r\nchurches, are standing evidences of. In the time of health he called his\r\nfamily together every evening, and, besides his private devotions in the\r\nmorning, he always retired into his closet in the afternoon at about\r\nfour or five o’clock. In his intercourse with men, he was in every\r\nrespect, as far as I could judge, very upright. He was a good landlord,\r\nand scarce ever raised his rents; and that his servants, likewise, have\r\nno reason to complain of their master, is evident from the long time\r\nthey generally lived with him. He had many valuable and good friends,\r\nwhose kindness he always acknowledged. And though, perhaps, he might\r\nhave some dispute, with a few people, the reason of which it would be\r\ndisagreeable to enter into, yet it is with great satisfaction that I can\r\naffirm that he was perfectly reconciled with every one. He was, with\r\nregard to himself, peculiarly sober and temperate; and he has often told\r\nme, that he denied himself many things, that he might bestow them\r\nbetter. Indeed, he appeared to me to have no greater regard to money\r\nthan as it furnished him with an opportunity of doing good. He supplied\r\nyearly three charity schools at Whaddon, Bletchley, and Fenny-Stratford:\r\nand besides what he constantly gave at Christmas, he was never backward\r\nin relieving his poor neighbours with both wine and money when they were\r\nsick, or in any kind of distress.” Thus, then, may end the few memorials\r\nthat have been thrown together regarding an estimable though eccentric\r\ngentleman “of the old school.” If he did not adorn society by his\r\n“manners,” he enriched our stores of knowledge, and posterity have\r\njustly conferred on his memory a reputation for antiquarian attainments\r\nwhich few can hope to acquire, because few have the industry to\r\ncultivate so thorough an intimacy with the venerable objects of their\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn “antiquary” is usually alarming. Those who are not acquainted with\r\nhim personally, imagine that he is necessarily dull, tasteless, and\r\npassionless. Yet this conception might be dissipated by reference to the\r\nmemoirs of the eminent departed, or by courting the society of the\r\ndistinguished living. A citation in the notice of Grose[77] tells us\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    “society droops for the loss of his jest:”\r\n\r\nthat antiquary’s facetiousness enlivened the dullest company, and with\r\nthe convivial he was the most jovial. Pennant’s numerous works bear\r\ninternal evidence of his pleasant mindedness. Jacob Bryant, “famous for\r\nhis extensive learning, erudition,” and profound investigations\r\nconcerning “Heathen Mythology,” and the situation and siege of “Troy,”\r\nwas one of the mildest and most amiable beings: his society was coveted\r\nby youth and age, until the termination of his life, in his eighty-ninth\r\nyear. Among the illustrious lovers of classic or black letter lore, were\r\nthe witty and humorous George Steevens, the editor of Shakspeare; Dr.\r\nRichard Farmer, the learned author of the masterly “Essay on the Genius\r\nand Learning of Shakspeare,” is renowned by the few who remember him for\r\nthe ease and variety of his conversation; Samuel Paterson, the\r\ncelebrated bibliopolist, was full of anecdote and drollery; and the\r\nplacid and intelligent Isaac Reed, the discriminating editor of “the\r\nimmortal bard of Avon,” graced every circle wherein he moved. It might\r\nseem to assume an intimacy which the editor of this work does not\r\npretend to, were he to mention instances of social excellence among the\r\nprying investigators of antiquity yet alive: one, however, he cannot\r\nforbear to name--the venerable octogenarian John Nichols, esq. F.S.A. of\r\nwhom he only knows, in common with all who have read or heard of him, as\r\nan example of cheerfulness and amenity during a life of unwearied\r\nperseverance in antiquarian researches, and the formation of multiform\r\ncollections, which have added more to general information, and created a\r\ngreater number of inquirers on such subjects, than the united labours of\r\nhis early contemporaries.\r\n\r\nStill it is not to be denied, that seclusion, wholly employed on the\r\nfoundations of the dead, and the manners of other times, has a tendency\r\nto unfit _such_ devotees for easy converse, when they seek to recreate\r\nby adventuring into the world. Early-acquired and long-continued\r\nseverity of study, whether of the learned languages, or antiquities, or\r\nscience, or nature, if it exclude other intimacies, is unfavourable to\r\npersonal appearance and estimation. The _mere_ scholar, the _mere_\r\nmathematician, and the _mere_ antiquary, easily obtain reputations for\r\neccentricity; but there are numerous individuals of profound\r\nabstraction, and erudite inquiry, who cultivate the understanding, or\r\nthe imagination, or the heart, who are, in manner, so little different\r\nfrom others, that they are scarcely suspected by the unknown and the\r\nself-sufficient of being better or wiser than themselves. Hence, “in\r\ncompany,” the individual whom all the world agrees to look on as “The\r\nGreat Unknown,” may be scarcely thought of, as “The Antiquary”--the\r\n“President of the Royal Society” pass for “quite a lady’s man”--and ELIA\r\nbe only regarded as “a gentleman that loves a joke!”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND ART.\r\n\r\n“_Buy my images!_”\r\n\r\n“Art improves nature,” is an old proverb which our forefathers adopted\r\nwithout reflection, and obstinately adhered to as lovers of consistency.\r\nThe capacity and meshes of their brain were too small to hold many great\r\ntruths, but they caught a great number of little errors, and this was\r\none. They bequeathed it to “their children and their children’s\r\nchildren,” who inherited it till they threw away the wisdom of their\r\nancestors with their wigs; left off hair powder; and are now leaving off\r\nthe sitting in hot club rooms, for the sake of sleep, and exercise in\r\nthe fresh air. There seems to be a general insurrection against the\r\nunnatural improvement of nature. We let ourselves and our trees grow out\r\nof artificial forms, and no longer sit in artificial arbours, with\r\nentrances like that of the cavern at Blackheath hill, or, as we may even\r\nstill see them, if we pay a last visit to the dying beds of a few old\r\ntea-gardens. We know more than those who lived before us, and if we are\r\nnot happier, we are on the way to be so. Wisdom is happiness: but “he\r\nthat increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.” Knowledge is not wisdom;\r\nit is only the rough material of wisdom. It must be shaped by reflection\r\nand judgment, before it can be constructed into an edifice fitting for\r\nthe mind to dwell in, and take up its rest. This, as our old discoursers\r\nused to say, “brings us to our subject.”\r\n\r\n“_Buy my images!_” or, “Pye m’imaitches,” was, and is, a “London cry,”\r\nby Italian lads carrying boards on their heads, with plaster figures\r\nfor sale. “In _my_ time,” one of these “images” (it usually occupied a\r\ncorner of the board) was a “Polly”--\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~A Parrot.~]\r\n\r\nThis representative of the most “popular” of “all the winged inhabitants\r\nof air,” might have been taken for the likeness of some species between\r\nan owl and the booby-bird; but then the wings and back were coloured\r\nwith a lively green, and the under part had yellow streaks, and the beak\r\nwas of a red colour, and any colour did for the eyes, if they were\r\nlarger than they ought to have been. “In _my_ time” too, there was an\r\n“image” of a “fine bow pot,” consisting of half a dozen green shapes\r\nlike halbert tops for “make believe” leaves, spreading like a half\r\nopened fan, from a knot “that was not,” inasmuch as it was delicately\r\nconcealed by a tawny coloured ball called an orange, which pretended to\r\nrest on a clumsy clump of yellowed plaster as on the mouth of a jar--the\r\nwhole looking as unlike a nosegay in water as possible. Then, too, there\r\nwas a sort of obelisk with irregular projections and curves; the top,\r\nbeing smaller than the bottom, was marked out with paint into a sort of\r\nface, and, by the device of divers colours, it was bonnetted, armed,\r\nwaisted, and petticoated--this was called a “fine lady.” A lengthened\r\nmass became by colourable show, “a dog”--like ingenuity might have\r\ntortured it into a devil. The feline race were of two shapes and in\r\nthree sizes; the middle one--like physic in a bottle, “when taken, to be\r\nwell shaken,” moved its chalk head, to the wonder and delight of all\r\nurchins, until they informed themselves of its “springs of action,” at\r\nthe price of “only a penny,” and, by breaking it, discovered that the\r\nnodding knob achieved its un-cat-like motion, by being hung with a piece\r\nof wire to the interior of its hollow body. The lesser cat was not so\r\n_very_ small, considering its price--“a farthing:”--I speak of when\r\nbattered button tops represented that plentiful “coin of the realm.”\r\nThen there was the largest\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Cat.~]\r\n\r\nThe present representation favours the image too much. Neither this\r\nengraving, nor that of the “parrot,” is sufficiently like--the artist\r\nsays he “could not draw it bad enough:” what an abominable deficiency is\r\nthe want of “an eye”--heigho! Then there were so many things, that were\r\nnot likenesses of any thing of which they were “images,” and so many\r\nyears and cares have rolled over my head and heart, that I have not\r\nrecollection or time enough for their description. They are all gone, or\r\ngoing--“going out” or “gone out” for ever! Personal remembrance is the\r\nfrail and only memorial of the existence of some of these “ornaments” of\r\nthe humble abodes of former times.\r\n\r\nThe masterpieces on the board of the “image-man,” were “a pair,”--at\r\nthat time “matchless.” They linger yet, at the extreme corners of a few\r\nmantle-pieces, with probably a “sampler” between, and, over that, a\r\ncouple of feathers from Juno’s bird, gracefully adjusted into a St.\r\nAndrew’s cross--their two gorgeous eyes giving out “beautiful colours,”\r\nto the beautiful eyes of innocent children. The “images,” spoken of as\r\nstill in being, are of the colossal height of eighteen inches, more or\r\nless: they personate the “human form divine,” and were designed,\r\nperhaps, by Hayman, but their moulds are so worn that the casts are\r\nunfeatured, and they barely retain their bodily semblance. They are\r\nalways painted black, save that a scroll on each, which depends from a\r\nkind of altar, is left white. One of the inscriptions says,\r\n\r\n    “Into the heaven of heavens I have presumed, &c.”\r\n\r\nand all, except the owners, admire the presumption. The “effigy” looks\r\nas if the man had been up the chimney, and, instead of having “drawn\r\nempyrean air,” had taken a glass too much of Hodges’s “Imperial,” and\r\nwrapped himself in the soot-bag to conceal his indulgence and his\r\nperson--this is “Milton.” The other, in like sables, points to his\r\ninscription, beginning,\r\n\r\n    “The cloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces, &c.”\r\n\r\nis an “insubstantial pageant” of “the immortal Shakspeare,”\r\n\r\n    “cheated of feature by dissembling nature,”\r\n\r\nthrough the operation of time.\r\n\r\n    “Such were the forms that o’er th’ _incrusted souls_\r\n    Of our forefathers scatter’d _fond delight_.”\r\n\r\nPrice, and Alison, and Knight, have generalized “taste” for high-life;\r\nwhile those of the larger circle have acquired “taste” from manifold\r\nrepresentations and vehicles of instruction, and comprehend the\r\noutlines, if they do not take in the details of natural objects. This is\r\nmanifested by the almost universal disuse of the “images” described.\r\nWith the inhabitants of every district in the metropolis, agreeable\r\nforms are now absolute requisites, and the demand has induced their\r\nsupply. There are, perhaps, as many casts from the Medicean Venus,\r\nApollo Belvidere, Antinous, the Gladiator, and other beauties of ancient\r\nsculpture, within the parish of St. George, in the East, as in the\r\nparish of St. George, Hanover-square. They are reposited over the\r\nfire-places, or on the tables, of neighbourhoods, wherein the uncouth\r\ncat, and the barbarous parrot were, even “in _my_ time,” desirable\r\n“images.” The moulds of the greater number of these deformities, are\r\nprobably destroyed. It was with difficulty that the “cat” could be\r\nobtained for the preceding column, and an “image” of the “parrot” was\r\nnot procurable from an “image-man.” Invention has been resorted to for\r\nthe gratification of popular desire: two plaster casts of children,\r\npublished in the autumn of 1825, have met with unparalleled sale. To\r\nrecord the period of their origin they are represented in the annexed\r\nengraving, and, perhaps, they may be so perpetuated when the casts\r\nthemselves shall have disappeared, in favour of others more elegant.\r\n\r\n    The “common people” have become uncommon;\r\n      A few remain, just here and there, the rest\r\n    Are polish’d and refined: child, man, and woman,\r\n      All, imitate the manners of the best;\r\n    Picking up, sometimes, good things from their betters,\r\n      As they have done from them. Then they have books;\r\n    As ’twas design’d they should, when taught their letters;\r\n      And nature’s self befriends their very looks:\r\n    And all this must, and all this ought to be--\r\n      The only use of eyes, I know of, is--to _see_.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Street Images in 1826.~\r\n\r\nHeight of each 16 inches and a half.]\r\n\r\nWhen these agreeable figures first appeared, the price obtained for them\r\nwas four shillings. As the sale slackened they were sold for three\r\nshillings; now, in March, 1826, the pair may be bought for two\r\nshillings, or eighteen pence. The consequence of this cheapness is, that\r\nthere is scarcely a house without them.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that society is improving in every direction. As I\r\nhinted before, we have a great deal to learn, and something to unlearn.\r\nIt is in many respects untrue, that “art improves nature;” while in many\r\nimportant respects it is certain, that “nature improves art.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brothers._\r\n\r\nThere are things in nature which the human voice can scarcely trust\r\nitself to relate; which art never can represent, and the pen can only\r\nfeebly describe. Such a scene occurred at Lyons, in the year 1794.\r\n\r\nThe place of confinement to which those were hurried, who had been\r\ncondemned to suffer by the revolutionary tribunal, was called “the Cave\r\nof Death.” A boy not fifteen years of age was sent thither. He had been\r\none of the foremost in a _sortie_ made during the siege, and for this\r\nwas doomed to perish. His little brother, scarcely six years old, who\r\nhad been accustomed to visit him at his former prison, no longer finding\r\nhim there, came and called at the iron grate of the vault. His brother\r\nheard him, and came to the grate: the poor infant passed his little\r\nhands between the vast bars to embrace him, while the elder raising\r\nhimself on the points of his feet could just reach to kiss them. “My\r\ndear brother,” said the child, “art thou going to die, and shall I see\r\nthee no more? why didn’t you tell them that you are not yet\r\nfifteen?”--“I did, brother, I said all that I could say, but they would\r\nhear nothing. Carry a kiss to my mother, and try to comfort her; nothing\r\ngrieves me but that I leave her ill; but don’t tell her yet, that I am\r\ngoing to die.” The child was drowned in tears, his little heart seemed\r\nready to burst:--“Good-by, brother,” he repeated again and again; “but\r\nI’m afraid you didn’t say that you are not yet fifteen.”--He was at\r\nlength so suffocated with sobs that he could speak no more, and went\r\naway. Every one who passed by, seeing his distress, asked him what was\r\nthe matter. “’Tis the wicked men that make me cry,” said he; “they are\r\ngoing to kill my brother who is so good, and who is not yet fifteen.”\r\n\r\n    With any being of a human form,\r\n    Who, reading such a narrative as this\r\n    Could be unshaken to the inmost soul,\r\n    I would not share a roof, nor sit, nor stand,\r\n    Nor converse hold, by word, or look, or pen.\r\n    Well, Reader! thou hast read--hast thou no tears?\r\n    If thou wert stranger to the tale till now,\r\n    And weep’st not--go! I dare not, will not, know thee\r\n    Thy manner may be gentle, but thy heart\r\n    Is ripe for cruelty--Go hence, I say!\r\n\r\n  [76] Chambaud.\r\n\r\n  [77] Vol. i. p. 658.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 7.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Season._\r\n\r\nThe earth has now several productions for our gratification, if we stoop\r\nto gather and examine them. Young botanists should commence their\r\ninquiries before the season pours in its abundance. They who are\r\nadmirers of natural beauties, may daily discover objects of delightful\r\nregard in the little peeping plants which escape the eye, unless their\r\nfirst appearance is narrowly looked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Primrose._\r\n\r\n    Welcome, pale Primrose! starting up between\r\n      Dead matted leaves of ash and oak, that strew\r\n      The every lawn, the wood, and spinney through,\r\n    ’Mid creeping moss and ivy’s darker green;\r\n      How much thy presence beautifies the ground:\r\n    How sweet thy modest, unaffected pride\r\n    Glows on the sunny bank, and wood’s warm side.\r\n      And when thy fairy flowers, in groups, are found,\r\n    The schoolboy roams enchantedly along,\r\n      Plucking the fairest with a rude delight:\r\n    While the meek shepherd stops his simple song,\r\n      To gaze a moment on the pleasing sight;\r\n    O’erjoy’d to see the flowers that truly bring\r\n    The welcome news of sweet returning spring!\r\n\r\n  _Clare._\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by the lady of the “Flora Domestica,” that “this little\r\nflower, in itself so fair, shows yet fairer from the early season of its\r\nappearance; peeping forth even from the retreating snows of winter: it\r\nforms a happy shade of union between the delicate snowdrop and the\r\nflaming crocus, which also venture forth in the very dawn of spring.”\r\nThe elegant authoress observes further: “There are many varieties of the\r\nprimrose, so called, (the polyanthus and auricular, though bearing\r\nother names, are likewise varieties,) but the most common are the\r\nsulphur-coloured and the lilac. The lilac primrose does not equal the\r\nother in beauty: we do not often find it wild; it is chiefly known to us\r\nas a garden-flower. It is indeed the sulphur-coloured primrose which we\r\nparticularly understand by that name: it is _the_ primrose: it is this\r\nwhich we associate with the cowslips and the meadows: it is this which\r\nshines like an earth-star from the grass by the brook side, lighting the\r\nhand to pluck it. We do indeed give the name of primrose to the lilac\r\nflower, but we do this in courtesy: we feel that it is not the primrose\r\nof our youth; not the primrose with which we have played at bo-peep in\r\nthe woods; not the irresistible primrose which has so often lured our\r\nyoung feet into the wet grass, and procured us coughs and chidings.\r\nThere is a sentiment in flowers: there are flowers we cannot look upon,\r\nor even hear named, without recurring to something that has an interest\r\nin our hearts; such are the primrose, the cowslip, the May-flower, the\r\ndaisy, &c. &c.” The poets have not neglected to pay due honours to this\r\nsweet spring-flower, which unites in itself such delicacy of form,\r\ncolour, and fragrance; they give it a forlorn and pensive character. The\r\npoems of Clare are as thickly strewn with primroses as the woods\r\nthemselves; the two following passages are from “The Village Minstrel.”\r\n\r\n    “O, who can speak his joys when spring’s young morn\r\n      From wood and pasture opened on his view,\r\n    When tender green buds blush upon the thorn,\r\n      And the first primrose dips its leaves in dew.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “And while he pluck’d the primrose in its pride,\r\n      He ponder’d o’er its bloom ’twixt joy and pain;\r\n    And a rude sonnet in its praise he tried,\r\n      Where nature’s simple way the aid of art supplied.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·54.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 8.~\r\n\r\nAt this season there is a sweetness in the fresh and open air, which\r\nnever “comes to town.” Residents in cities, therefore, must seek it at\r\nsome distance from their abodes; and those who cannot, may derive some\r\npleasure from a sonnet, by the rural bard quoted just now.\r\n\r\n_Approach of Spring._\r\n\r\n    Sweet are the omens of approaching Spring\r\n      When gay the elder sprouts her winged leaves\r\n    When tootling robins carol-welcomes sing,\r\n      And sparrows chelp glad tidings from the eaves.\r\n    What lovely prospects wait each wakening hour,\r\n      When each new day some novelty displays,\r\n    How sweet the sun-beam melts the crocus flower,\r\n      Whose borrow’d pride shines dizen’d in his rays:\r\n    Sweet, new-laid hedges flush their tender greens:\r\n    Sweet peep the arum-leaves their shelter screens:\r\n      Ah! sweet is all that I’m denied to share:\r\n    Want’s painful hindrance sticks me to her stall;--\r\n      But still Hope’s smiles unpoint the thorns of Care\r\n    Since Heaven’s eternal spring is free from all!\r\n\r\n  _Clare._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·05.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 9.~\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·15.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELEPHANT,\r\n\r\n~As he laid dead at Exeter Change.~]\r\n\r\n    In the position he liked best\r\n    He seem’d to drop, to sudden rest;\r\n    Nor bow’d his neck, but still a sense\r\n    Retain’d of his magnificence;\r\n    For, as he fell, he raised his head\r\n    And held it, as in life, when dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO MR. CROSS, PROPRIETOR OF THE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable incident in the metropolis, since “the panic” in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Royal Exchange, in January, 1826, was the death of\r\nthe celebrated elephant at Exeter Change, in March of the same year; not\r\nthat it is attempted to insinuate comparison between these events, as to\r\ntheir nature or consequences, but it may fairly be observed, that each\r\nproduced what is commonly called “a sensation” in town and country, and\r\nthat each originated in peculiar excitement.\r\n\r\nWishing to record the death of the elephant in this work, and to relate\r\nonly what is true, I resorted to Mr. Cross, whose menagerie has\r\nsustained a bereavement that can only be supplied, if it ever can be\r\nsupplied, at a vast expense, and after a long lapse of time. On\r\nexplaining my wish and purpose, Mr. Cross readily assented to furnish me\r\nwith the information I desired, and communicated the following\r\nparticulars. I committed them to paper during my interviews, and after\r\ndigesting them into order, submitted the whole to his revision. Except\r\nas to mere language and occasional illustrations, the narrative is, in\r\nfact, the narrative of Mr. Cross. It differs in many essential respects\r\nfrom other accounts, but it only so differs, because every statement is\r\naccurately related from Mr. Cross’s lips. Circumstances which occurred\r\nduring his temporary absence at the critical moment, were supplied to me\r\nin his presence by Mr. Tyler, the gentleman who arranged and cooperated\r\nwith Mr. Herring, during the exigency that rendered the destruction of\r\nthe elephant imperative.\r\n\r\nThe first owner of the lordly animal, now no more, was Mr. Harris,\r\nproprietor of Covent-garden theatre. He purchased it in July, 1810, for\r\nnine hundred guineas on its arrival in England, aboard the Astel,\r\nCaptain Hay, and the elephant “came out” as a public performer the same\r\nyear, in the procession of a grand pantomime, called “Harlequin\r\nPadmanaba.” Mrs. Henry Johnstone was his graceful rider, and he was\r\n“played up to” by the celebrated columbine, Mrs. Parker, whose husband\r\nhad a joint interest with Mr. Harris in the new performer. During his\r\n“engagement” at this theatre, Mr. Polito “signed articles” with Messrs.\r\nHarris and Parker for his further “appearance in public” at the Royal\r\nMenagerie, Exeter Change. On the death of Mr. Polito, in 1814, Mr.\r\nCross, who for twenty years had been superintendent of the concern,\r\nbecame its purchaser, and the elephant, thus transferred, remained with\r\nMr. Cross till the termination of his life. From his “last farewell” to\r\nthe public at Covent-garden theatre, he was stationary at the menagerie,\r\nfrom whence he was never removed, and, consequently, he was never\r\nexhibited at any other place.\r\n\r\nOn the elephant’s first arrival from India he had two keepers; these\r\naccompanied him to Exeter Change, and to their controul he implicitly\r\nsubmitted, until the death of one of them, within the first year after\r\nMr. Cross’s proprietorship, when the animal’s increasing bulk and\r\nstrength rendered it necessary to enlarge his den, or rather to\r\nconstruct a new one. The bars of the old one were not thicker than a\r\nman’s arm. With Mr. Harrison, the carpenter, who built his new den, and\r\nwith whom he had formed a previous intimacy, he was remarkably docile,\r\nand accommodated himself to his wishes in every respect. He was\r\noccasionally troublesome to his builder from love of play, but the prick\r\nof a gimblet was an intimation he obeyed, till a desire for fresh frolic\r\nprompted him to further interference, and then a renewal of the hint, or\r\nsome trifling eatable from the carpenter’s pocket, abated the\r\ninterruption. In this way they went on together till the work was\r\ncompleted, and while the elephant retained his senses, he was happy in\r\nevery opportunity that afforded him the society of his friend Harrison.\r\nThe den thus erected will be particularized presently: it was that\r\nwherein he remained till his death.\r\n\r\nAbout six years ago this elephant indicated an excitement which is\r\nnatural to the species, and which prevails every year for a short\r\nseason. At the period now spoken of, his keeper having gone into his den\r\nto exhibit him, the animal refused obedience; on striking him with a\r\nslight cane, as usual, the elephant violently threw him down: another\r\nkeeper seeing the danger, tossed a pitchfork to his comrade, which the\r\nanimal threw aside like a straw. A person then ran to alarm Mr. Cross,\r\nwho hurried down stairs, and catching up a shovel, struck the animal\r\nviolently on the head, and suddenly seizing the prostrated man, dragged\r\nhim from the den, and saved his life.\r\n\r\nThis was the first appearance of those annual paroxysms, wherein the\r\nelephant, whether wild or confined, becomes infuriated. At such a period\r\nit is customary in India to liberate the elephants and let them run to\r\nthe forests, whence, on the conclusion of the fit, they usually return\r\nto their wonted subjection. Such an experiment being impossible with Mr.\r\nCross, he resorted to pharmacy, and, in the course of fifty-two hours,\r\nsucceeded in deceiving his patient into the taking of twenty-four pounds\r\nof salts, twenty-four pounds of treacle, six ounces of calomel, an ounce\r\nand a half of tartar emetic, and six drams of powder of gamboge. To this\r\nhe added a bottle of croton oil, the most potent cathartic perhaps in\r\nexistence; of this, a full dram was administered, which alone is\r\nsufficient for at least sixty full doses to the human being; yet,\r\nthough united with the preceding enormous quantity of other medicine, it\r\noperated no apparent effect. At this juncture Mr. Nyleve, a native East\r\nIndian, and a man of talent, suggested to Mr. Cross the administration\r\nof animal oil, as a medicine of efficacy. Six pounds of marrow from beef\r\nbones were accordingly placed within his reach, as if it had been left\r\nby accident; the liquorish beast, who would probably have refused it had\r\nit been tendered him in his food, swallowed the bait. The result\r\njustified Mr. Nyleve’s prediction. To my inquiry whether the marrow had\r\nnot accelerated an operation which would have succeeded the previous\r\nadministration, Mr. Cross answered, that he believed the beef marrow was\r\nthe really active medicine, because, after an interval of three weeks,\r\nhe gave the same quantity wholly unaccompanied, and the same aperient\r\neffect followed. He never, however, could repeat the experiment; for the\r\nelephant in successive years wholly refused the marrow, however\r\nattempted to be disguised, or with whatever it was mixed.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent years, during these periods of excitement, the paroxysms\r\nsuccessively increased in duration; but there was no increase of\r\nviolence until the present year, when the symptoms became more alarming,\r\nand medicine produced no diminution of the animal’s heightened rage. On\r\nSunday, (the 26th of February,) a quarter of a pound of calomel was\r\ngiven to him in gruel. Three grains of this is a dose for a man; and\r\nthough the entire quantity given to the elephant was more than equal to\r\nsix hundred of those doses, it failed of producing in him any other\r\neffect than extreme suspicion of any food that was tendered to him, if\r\nit at all varied in appearance from what he was accustomed to at other\r\ntimes. On Monday morning some warm ale was offered him in a bucket, for\r\nthe purpose of assisting the operation of the calomel, but he would not\r\ntouch it till Cartmell, his keeper, drank a portion of the liquor\r\nhimself, when he readily took it. The fluid did not appear to accelerate\r\nthe wished-for object; and, in fact, the calomel wholly failed to\r\noperate. Though in a state of constant irritation, he remained tolerably\r\nquiet throughout Monday and Tuesday, until Wednesday, the 1st of March,\r\nwhen additional medicine became necessary, and Mrs. Cross conceived the\r\nthought of giving it to him through some person whom the elephant had\r\nnot seen, and whom therefore he might regard as a casual visiter, and\r\nnot suspect. To a certain extent the feint succeeded. She sent some buns\r\nto him by a strange lad, in one of which a quantity of calomel had been\r\nintroduced. He ate each bun from the boy’s hand till that with the\r\ncalomel was presented; instead of conveying it to his mouth, he\r\ninstantly dropped the bun, and crushed it with his foot. In this way he\r\nwas accustomed to treat every thing of food that he disliked.\r\n\r\nIt was always considered that the elephant’s den was of sufficient\r\nstrength and magnitude to accommodate, and be proof against any attack\r\nhe was able to direct against it, even in his most violent displeasure.\r\nIn the course of the four preceding years the front had sustained many\r\nhundred of his powerful lounges, without any part having been\r\nsubstantially injured, or the smallest portion displaced, or rendered\r\nrickety in the slightest degree; but on this morning, (Wednesday,) about\r\nten o’clock, he made a tremendous rush at the front, wholly unexcited by\r\nprovocation, and broke the tenon, or square end at the top of the hinge\r\nstory-post, to which the gates are hung, from its socket or mortise in\r\nthe massive cross beam above; and, consequently, the strong iron clamped\r\ngates which had hitherto resisted his many furious attacks upon them,\r\nlost their security. Mr. Cross was then absent from the menagerie, and,\r\nin the urgency of the moment, his friend Mr. Tyler, a gentleman of great\r\ncoolness and faculty of arrangement, gave orders for a strong massy\r\npiece of timber to be placed in front of his den, as a temporary fixture\r\nagainst the broken story-post; and offered every thing he could think of\r\nto pamper, and, if possible, to allay the animal’s fury. On Mr. Cross’s\r\narrival he rightly judged, that another such lounge would prostrate the\r\ngates; and, as it was known that Mr. Harrison, the carpenter of the den,\r\nwho formerly possessed great influence over him, had now lost all power\r\nof controuling him, it was morally certain, that if any other persons\r\nattempted to repair the mischief in an effectual way, their lives would\r\nbe forfeited. Mr. Cross, under these circumstances of imminent danger,\r\ninstantly determined to destroy the elephant with all possible\r\ndespatch, as the only measure he could possibly adopt for his own safety\r\nand the safety of the public. Having formed his resolution, he went\r\nwithout a moment’s delay to Mr. Gifford, chemist in the Strand, and\r\nrequested to be supplied with a potent poison, destitute if possible of\r\ntaste or smell. Mr. Gifford, sensible of the serious consequences to Mr.\r\nCross in a pecuniary point of view, entreated him to reflect still\r\nfurther, and not to commit an act of which he might hereafter repent.\r\nMr. Cross assured him that whatever irritation he might manifest,\r\nproceeded from his own feelings of regard towards the elephant,\r\nheightened by a sense of the loss that would ensue upon his purpose\r\nbeing effected; adding, that he had a firm conviction that unless the\r\nanimal’s death was immediately accomplished, loss of human life must\r\nensue. Mr. Gifford replied, that he had never seen or complied more\r\nreluctantly with his wish on any occasion, and he gave him four ounces\r\nof arsenic. Mr. Cross declares that on his way back, the conflict of his\r\nfeelings was so great at that moment, that he imagines no person\r\ncontemplating murder could endure greater agony. The arsenic was mixed\r\nwith oats, and a quantity of sugar being added by way of inducement, it\r\nwas offered to the elephant as his ordinary meal by his keeper. The\r\nsagacious animal wholly refused to touch it.\r\n\r\nHis eyes now glared like lenses of glass reflecting a red and burning\r\nlight. In order to soothe him, some oranges, to which fruit he had great\r\nliking, were repeatedly proffered; but though these were in a pure\r\nstate, he took them, one after the other, as they were presented to him,\r\nand dropping each on the floor of his den instantly squelched it with\r\nhis foot, and having thus disposed of a few he refused to take another.\r\nThis utter rejection of food, with amazing increase of fury, heightened\r\nMr. Cross’s alarm. He again went out, and in great agitation procured\r\nhalf an ounce of corrosive sublimate to be mixed in a quantity of\r\nconserve of roses, securely tied in a bladder, to prevent, if possible,\r\nany scent from the poison, and with some hope that if the animal\r\ndetected any effluvia through the air-tight skin it would be the odour\r\nof roses and sugar, which were substances peculiarly grateful to him.\r\nThe elephant was accustomed to swallow several things lying about within\r\nreach of his proboscis, which, if tendered to him, he would have\r\nrefused; and this habit suggesting the possibility that he might so\r\ndispose of this, which, it was quite certain, if presented would have\r\nbeen rejected, the ball was placed so that he might find it; but the\r\ninstant he perceived it he seemed to detect the purpose; he hastily\r\nseized it, and as hastily letting it fall, violently smashed it with his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe peril was becoming greater every minute. The elephant’s weight was\r\nupwards of five tons, and from such an animal’s excessive rage, in a\r\nplace of insecure confinement, the most terrible consequences were to be\r\nfeared. Mr. Cross therefore intrusted his friend, Mr. Tyler, to direct\r\nand assist the endeavours of the keepers for the controul of the\r\ninfuriated beast. He then despatched a messenger to his brother-in-law,\r\nMr. Herring, in the New Road, Paddington, a man of determined\r\nresolution, and an excellent shot, stating the danger, and requesting\r\nhim to come to the menagerie. As he arrived without arms, they went\r\ntogether to Mr. Stevens, gunsmith, in High Holborn, for rifles. On their\r\nway to him they called at Surgeons-hall, Lincoln’s-Inn Fields, where\r\nthey hoped to see the skeleton of an elephant, in order to form a\r\njudgment of the places through which the shots would be likeliest to\r\nreach the vital parts. In this they were disappointed, the college of\r\nsurgeons not having the skeleton of the animal in its collection; but\r\nMr. Clift, who politely received them, communicated what information he\r\npossessed on the subject. Mr. Stevens lent him three rifles, and at his\r\nhouse Mr. Cross left Mr. Herring to get the pieces ready, after\r\ninstructing him to cooperate with Mr. Tyler, in attempting the\r\ndestruction of the animal, if it should be absolutely necessary before\r\nhe returned himself. From thence Mr. Cross hastened to Great\r\nMarlborough-street, for the advice of Mr. Joshua Brookes, the eminent\r\nanatomist. He found that gentleman in his theatre, delivering a public\r\nlecture. Sense of danger deprived Mr. Cross of the attentions due to\r\ntime and place under ordinary circumstances, and he immediately\r\naddressed Mr. Brookes; “Sir, a word with you, if you please,\r\nimmediately: I have not an instant to lose.” Mr. Brookes concluded his\r\nlecture directly and knowing Mr. Cross would not have intruded upon him\r\nexcept from extreme urgency, withdrew with him, and gave him such\r\ninstructions as the case seemed to require. Mr. Cross, accompanied by\r\none of Mr. Brookes’s pupils, hastened homeward. They were met near the\r\nmenagerie by Mr. Tyler, who entreated Mr. Cross to run to Somerset-house\r\nand obtain military assistance from that place, for that they had been\r\ncompelled to use the rifles in their own defence, and had put a number\r\nof shot in him without being able to get him down. Mr. Brookes’s pupil\r\naccompanied Mr. Tyler, to assist him, if possible, while Mr. Cross\r\nrapidly proceeded to Somerset-house, where he found a sentry on duty,\r\nwho did not dare to quit his post, and referred him to the guard-room,\r\nwhere there were only two other privates and a corporal, who, at first,\r\ndeclared his utter inability to lend him either men or arms; but on the\r\nearnest entreaties of Mr. Cross for aid, and his repeated\r\nrepresentations, that he would be responsible in purse and person, and\r\ncompensate any consequences that could be incurred by a direliction from\r\nthe formalities of military duty on so pressing an occasion, the\r\ncorporal relented, and, with one of the privates, hastened to the\r\nmenagerie.\r\n\r\nMr. Cross now met Herring, of the public office, Bow-street, to whom he\r\ncommunicated the situation of affairs at Exeter Change, and requested\r\nhis assistance in obtaining arms. Herring suggested an application to\r\nBow-street for that purpose. It appears that from accident they were not\r\nprocurable there, and deeming it possible that they might be got at sir\r\nW. Congreve’s office, Mr. Cross ran thither, where he was also\r\ndisappointed. Mr. Brooks, glassman of the Strand, informed Mr. Cross\r\nthere were small arms in the neighbourhood of Somerset-house; these, on\r\nreturning to that place, were discovered to be old howitzers, and,\r\ntherefore, useless. From thence he went on board the police-ship\r\nstationed on the Thames, near Waterloo-bridge, expecting to find\r\nswivels, and was again disappointed; being informed, however, that\r\nswivels were fired during civic processions from Hawes’s soap\r\nmanufactory, on the Surrey side of the river, near Blackfriars-bridge,\r\nhe rowed over and obtained a swivel, with a few balls, and the head of a\r\npoker, and the assistance of one of Mr. Hawes’s men. The use for either,\r\nhowever, ceased to exist; for they arrived at the menagerie within a few\r\nminutes after the conclusion of such a scene as had never been\r\nexhibited in that place nor, probably, in any other in this country. The\r\nelephant was dead.\r\n\r\nTo describe the proceedings of Exeter Change, from the time of Mr.\r\nCross’s leaving it, it is necessary to recur to the period of Mr.\r\nHerring’s appearance thither, on his return from Mr. Stevens’s, in\r\nHolborn, with the three rifles, and one of Mr. Stevens’s assistants. He\r\nfound that the violence of the elephant had increased every minute from\r\nthe period of his departure with Mr. Cross, and that at great personal\r\nhazard Mr. Tyler, with Cartmell and Newsam, and the other keepers, had\r\nprevented him from breaking down the front of the den.\r\n\r\nThe keepers faced him with long pikes or spears, to deter him as much as\r\npossible from efforts to liberate himself from the confinement, which at\r\nordinary periods he had submitted to without restraint. When he lounged\r\nfuriously at the bars, they assailed him with great bravery, and their\r\nthreats and menaces prevented the frequency of his attacks. In this\r\nstate of affairs Mr. Herring concurred with Mr. Tyler, that to wait\r\nlonger for Mr. Cross would endanger the existence of every person\r\npresent; and having communicated the fact to Mrs. Cross, who had the\r\nhighest regard for the animal from his ordinary docility, she was\r\nconvinced, by their representations, that his death must be accomplished\r\nimmediately, and therefore assented to it.\r\n\r\nFor the information of persons not acquainted with the menagerie, it is\r\nnecessary to state that it occupies the entire range of the floor above\r\nExeter Change, the lower part of which edifice withinside is occupied by\r\nshops belonging to Mr. Clarke. This part of the building, on the\r\nbusiness of the day being concluded, is closed every night by the strong\r\nfolding gates at each end, which, when open, allow a free passage to the\r\npublic through the Change. It will be perceived, therefore, that the\r\nflooring above is Mr. Cross’s menagerie, or, at least, that very\r\nimportant part of it which is allotted to his matchless collection of\r\nquadrupeds. A large arrangement of other animals is in other apartments,\r\non a higher story. Nero, not Wombwell’s Nero, which was baited by that\r\nshowman at Warwick, but a lion not only in every respect finer than his\r\nnamesake, and, in short, the noblest of his noble species in England,\r\noccupies a den in the menagerie over the western door of the Change.\r\nOther lions and animals are properly secured in their places of\r\nexhibition, on each side of the room, and the east end is wholly\r\noccupied by the den of the elephant; its floor being supported by a\r\nfoundation of brick and timber more than adequate to the amazing weight\r\nof the animal. The requisite strength and construction of this flooring\r\nnecessarily raise it nearly two feet from the flooring of the other part\r\nof the menagerie, which, though amazingly stable, and capable of bearing\r\nany other beast in perfect safety, would have immediately given way\r\nbeneath the tread of the elephant; and had he forced his den he must\r\nhave fallen through.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as his sudden death was resolved on, Mr. Tyler went\r\ndown to Mr. Clarke, and acquainting him with the danger arising out of\r\nthe immediate necessity, suggested the instant removal of every person\r\nfrom the Change below, and the closing of the Change gates. Mr. Clarke,\r\nand all belonging to his establishment, saw the propriety of their\r\nspeedy departure, and in a few minutes the gates were barred and locked.\r\nBy the adoption of these precautions, if the elephant had broken down\r\nthe floor no lives would have been lost, although much valuable property\r\nwould have been destroyed; and, in the event contemplated, the animal\r\nhimself would have been confined within the basement. Still, however, a\r\nslight exertion of his enormous strength could have forced the gates. If\r\nhe had made his entry into the Strand, it is impossible to conjecture\r\nthe mischief that might have ensued in that crowded thoroughfare, from\r\nhis infuriated passion.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Tyler’s return up stairs from Mr. Clarke, it was evident from the\r\nelephant’s extreme rage, that not a moment was to be lost. Three rifles\r\ntherefore were immediately loaded, and Mr. Herring, accompanied by Mr.\r\nStevens’s assistant entered the menagerie, each with a rifle, and took\r\ntheir stations for the purpose of firing. Mr. Tyler pointed out to the\r\nkeepers the window places, and such recesses as they might fly to if the\r\nelephant broke through, and enjoining each man to select a particular\r\nspot as his own exclusive retreat, concluded by showing the danger of\r\nany two of them running to the same place for shelter. The keepers with\r\ntheir pikes, placed themselves in the rear of Mr. Herring and his\r\nassistant, who stood immediately opposite the den, at about the\r\ndistance of twelve feet in the front. Mr. Herring requested Cartmell to\r\ncall in his usual tone to the elephant when he exhibited him to\r\nvisiters, on which occasions the animal was accustomed to face his\r\nfriends with the hope of receiving something from their hands.\r\nCartmell’s cry of “Chunee! Chunee! Chuneelah!” in his exhibiting tone,\r\nproduced a somewhat favourable posture for his enemies, and he instantly\r\nreceived two bullets aimed from the rifles towards the heart; they\r\nentered immediately behind the shoulder blade, at the distance of about\r\nthree inches from each other. The moment the balls had perforated his\r\nbody he made a fierce and heavy rush at the front, which further\r\nweakened the gates, shivered the side bar next to the dislodged\r\nstory-post, and drove it out into the menagerie. The fury of the\r\nanimal’s assault was terrific, the crash of the timbers, the hallooing\r\nof the keepers in their retreat, the calls for “rifles! rifles!” and the\r\nconfusion and noise incident to the scene, rendered it indescribably\r\nterrific. The assailants rallied in a few seconds, and came pointing\r\ntheir spears with threats. Mr. Tyler having handed two other rifles,\r\nthey were discharged as before; and, as before, produced a similar\r\ndesperate lounge from the enraged beast at the front of his den. Had it\r\nbeen effective, and he had descended on the floor, his weight must have\r\ninevitably carried it, together with himself, his assailants, and the\r\ngreater part of the lions, and other animals, into the Change below, and\r\nby possibility have buried the entire menagerie in ruins. “Rifles!\r\nrifles!” were again called for, and from this awful crisis it was only\r\nin the power of Mr. Tyler and some persons outside, to load quick enough\r\nfor the discharge of one rifle at a time. The maddened animal turned\r\nround in his den incessantly, apparently with the design of keeping his\r\nhead from the riflemen, who after the first two discharges could only\r\nobtain single shots at him. The shutter inside of a small grated window,\r\nwhich stood in a projection into the den, at one of the back corners,\r\nwas now unshipped, and from this position Mr. Herring fired several\r\nshots through the grating. The elephant thus attacked in the rear as\r\nwell as the front, flew round the den with the speed of a race-horse,\r\nuttering frightful yells and screams, and stopping at intervals to bound\r\nfrom the back against the front. The force of these rushes shook the\r\nentire building, and excited the most terrifying expectation that he\r\nwould bring down the entire mass of wood and iron-work, and project\r\nhimself among his assailants.\r\n\r\nAfter the discharge of about thirty balls, he stooped and sunk\r\ndeliberately on his haunches. Mr. Herring, conceiving that a shot had\r\nstruck him in a vital part, cried out--“He’s down, boys! he’s down!” and\r\nso he was, but it was only for a moment: he leapt up with renewed\r\nvigour, and at least eighty balls were successively discharged at him\r\nfrom different positions before he fell a second time. Previous to that\r\nfall, Mr. Joshua Brookes had arrived with his son, and suggested to Mr.\r\nHerring to aim especially at the ear, at the eye, and at the gullet.\r\n\r\nThe two soldiers despatched from Somerset-house by Mr. Cross came in a\r\nshort time before Mr. Brookes, and discharged about three or four rounds\r\nof ball cartridge, which was all the amunition they had. It is a\r\nremarkable instance of the animal’s subjection to his keeper, that\r\nthough in this deranged state, he sometimes recognised Cartmell’s usual\r\ncry of “Chunee! Chunee! Chuneelah!” by sounds with which he was\r\naccustomed to answer the call, and that more than once, when Cartmell\r\ncalled out “Bite Chunee! bite!” which was his ordinary command to the\r\nelephant to kneel, he actually knelt, and in that position received the\r\nballs in the parts particularly desired to be aimed at. Cartmell,\r\ntherefore, kept himself as much as possible out of view as one of the\r\nassailants, in order that his voice might retain its wonted ascendency.\r\nHe and Newsam, and their comrades took every opportunity of thrusting at\r\nhim. Cartmell, armed with a sword at the end of a pole, which he\r\nafterwards affixed to a rifle, pierced him several times.\r\n\r\nOn the elephant’s second fall he lay with his face towards the back of\r\nthe den, and with one of his feet thrust out between the bars, so that\r\nthe toes touched the menagerie floor. At this time he had from a hundred\r\nand ten to a hundred and twenty balls in him; as he lay in a posture,\r\nCartmell thrust the sword into his body to the hilt. The sanguinary\r\nconflict had now lasted nearly an hour; yet, with astonishing alacrity,\r\nhe again rose, without evincing any sign that he had sustained vital\r\ninjury, though it was apparent he was much exhausted. He endeavoured to\r\nconceal his head by keeping his rear to the front; and lest he should\r\neither make a successful effort at the gate, or, on receiving his\r\ndeath-wound, fall backwards against it, which would inevitably have\r\ncarried the whole away, the keepers availed themselves of the juncture\r\nto rapidly lash the gates of his den with a chain and ropes so securely,\r\nthat he could not force them without bringing down the entire front.\r\n\r\nMr. Herring now directed his rifle constantly to the ear: one of these\r\nballs took so much effect, that the elephant suddenly rushed round from\r\nthe blow, and made his last furious effort at the gates. Mr. Tyler\r\ndescribes this rush as the most awful of the whole. If the gates had not\r\nbeen firmly lashed, the animal must have come through; for, by this last\r\neffort, he again dislodged them, and they were kept upright by the chain\r\nand ropes alone. Mr. Herring from this time chiefly directed his fire at\r\nthe gullet; at last he fell, but with so much deliberation, and in a\r\nposition so natural to his usual habits, that he seemed to have lain\r\ndown to rest himself. Mr. Herring continued to fire at him, and spears\r\nwere ran into his sides, but he remained unmoved, nor did he stir from\r\nthe first moment of his fall. Four or five discharges from a rifle into\r\nhis ear produced no effect: it was evident that he was without sense,\r\nand that he had dropped dead, into the posture wherein he always lay\r\nwhen alive.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such an animal, of such prodigious size and strength, was\r\ndestroyed in such a place, without an accident, from the commencement to\r\nthe close of the assault, is a subject of real astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Mr. Cross’s menagerie, after the removal of the\r\nelephant, was equally and almost as agreeably surprising. A partial\r\ndissection took place on the Sunday, and in the course of the same day\r\nthe body of the animal, with the skeleton, hide, and every particle of\r\nthe remains, were removed. A stranger entering the place on Tuesday,\r\nignorant of the recent event, could not have suspected such an\r\noccurrence. The menagerie was destitute of offensive smell, and, in\r\nevery respect, preserved its usual appearance of order and cleanliness.\r\nThus much is testified by the editor of the _Every-Day Book_ from\r\npersonal observation; and, if he were not too unwell to write more, he\r\nwould add some interesting particulars respecting “Chuneelah,” which\r\nare necessarily deferred till the next sheet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA representation of the outside front of the den seeming essential to\r\nthe right understanding of the narrative, an engraving of it is added\r\nfrom a drawing made by Mr. John Cleghorn, the architectural draftsman,\r\nfor that purpose. It is minutely correct in form and proportion, and\r\nshows the bar which the elephant broke and displaced in his last lounge.\r\nThough of solid oak, six inches square, it broke beneath his rush like a\r\nslight stick.\r\n\r\nThis engraving will be particularly referred to hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Den of the Elephant at Exeter Change.~]\r\n\r\nThe posture of the animal as he lay dead, is shown by the engraving at\r\nthe head of this article.\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting anecdotes concerning elephants are extracted and\r\nsubjoined from the Philosophical Transactions, Grose’s Voyage to the\r\nEast Indies, Shaw’s Zoology, Goldsmith’s Animated Nature, the\r\nGentleman’s Magazine, and other works and collections, some of which are\r\nnamed in the extracts themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the “London Magazine,” for 1761, there is an imperfect description of\r\na large elephant, which is there called a “monstrous creature,”\r\npresented by the court of Persia to the king of Naples at that period.\r\nThere is a detailed account of the animal by M. Nollet, in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” of the French Royal Academy. The “London”\r\neditor was so struck by this elephant’s enormous consumption of food,\r\nthat he observes, “as the keeping of an elephant is so expensive, we may\r\nconclude that no old or full-grown one will ever be brought here for a\r\nshow.” It is true that Mr. Cross’s elephant, on his arrival in this\r\ncountry, was neither old nor full-grown; but his exhibition falsifies\r\nthe English editor’s presumption, that the great outlay for such an\r\nanimal’s keep would be an effectual bar to such enterprise as we have\r\nseen manifested by Mr. Cross, whose elephant was in size, and other\r\nrespects, greatly superior to the “enormous” elephant of his majesty of\r\nthe Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBosinian observes, that the bullets to be made use of in hunting and\r\nkilling the elephants, must be of _iron_, lead being too soft in its\r\ntexture to do any execution. He says, “elephants are very difficult to\r\nbe killed, unless the ball happens to light betwixt the eyes and the\r\nears; to which end the bullet ought to be iron also. Their skin is as\r\ngood proof against the common musket lead balls, as a wall; and if they\r\nhit the mentioned place become entirely flat.” Afterwards he says,\r\n“Those who pretended thoroughly to understand the elephant-shooting,\r\ntold us, that we ought to have shot iron bullets, since those of lead\r\nare flatted, either by their bones, or the toughness of their skin.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1767, a cutler at Sheffield in Yorkshire, in sawing an\r\nelephant’s tooth into proper laminæ or scantlings of ivory, met with a\r\nresistance which he had great difficulty to overcome. After he had got\r\nthrough the obstruction, it proved to be an _iron_ bullet, lodged in the\r\nvery body of the tooth, without any visible mark externally of the place\r\nwhere it entered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1801, Mr. Charles Combe described to the Royal Society, an elephant’s\r\ntusk with the iron head of a spear thoroughly imbedded in it. From its\r\nposition, he presumed it to have been forced by manual strength,\r\nthrough that part of the skull contiguous to the tusk; and that pursuing\r\nthe natural course of the cavity, it pointed downwards towards the apex\r\nof the tusk.\r\n\r\nOther substances foreign to the natural growth of the tusks of\r\nelephants, are frequently, found within them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not until after the discharge of a hundred or perhaps double the\r\nnumber of rifles, that the elephant is slain in India, when he is chased\r\nby persons inured to the danger, and determined on his destruction. It\r\nwill not excite astonishment, therefore, that Mr. Cross’s noble animal\r\nshould have retained life under the firing of one hundred and fifty-two\r\nshots. There is an account of a splendid hunting party of a late Nawab\r\nAsuf-ud-Dowlah, who, with an immense retinue, took the field for the\r\npurpose of destroying every animal they met with. On a large plain\r\novergrown with grass they discovered a wild elephant. The Nawab\r\nimmediately formed a semicircle, with four hundred tame elephants, who\r\nwere directed to advance and surround him. When the semicircle of\r\nelephants got within three hundred yards of the wild one, he looked\r\namazed, but not frightened. Two large and fierce elephants were ordered\r\nto advance against him, but they were repulsed by a dreadful shock, and\r\ndrove by the Nawab, who, as the wild one passed, ordered some of the\r\nstrongest female elephants to go alongside and endeavour to entangle him\r\nwith nooses and running knots; the attempt, however, was vain, as he\r\nsnapped every rope, and none of the tame elephants could stop his\r\nprogress. The Nawab, perceiving it impossible to catch him, ordered his\r\ndeath, and immediately a volley of above a hundred shots were fired.\r\nMany of the balls hit him, but he seemed unconcerned, and moved on\r\ntowards the mountains. An incessant fire was kept up for nearly half an\r\nhour; the Nawab and most of his omras, or lords, used rifles, which\r\ncarried two or three ounce balls but they made very little impression,\r\nand scarcely penetrated beyond the skin. Our author, who was mounted on\r\na female elephant, went up repeatedly within ten yards of the wild one,\r\nand fired his rifle at his head; the blood gushed out, but the skull was\r\ninvulnerable. Some of the Kandahar horses then galloped up and wounded\r\nthe beast in several places. At length, being much exhausted with the\r\nloss of blood, from the number of wounds which he had received, he\r\nslackened his pace, and became quite calm and serene, as if determined\r\nto meet his approaching end. The horsemen, seeing him weak and slow,\r\ndismounted, and with their swords commenced a furious attack on the\r\ntendons of his hind legs, which were soon divided, and the operation\r\ncompletely disabled the poor animal from proceeding any further: he\r\nstaggered, and then fell without a groan. The hatchet-men now advanced,\r\nand began to cut away his large ivory tusks, while the horsemen and\r\nsoldiers in the most unfeeling manner attacked the dying creature with\r\ntheir swords. We can readily believe the writer, when he says the sight\r\nwas very affecting. The noble animal still breathed, and breathed\r\nwithout a groan. He rolled his eyes in anguish on the surrounding crowd,\r\nand, making a last effort to rise, expired with a sigh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore gunpowder was invented, elephants were used by the nations of\r\nAsia and Africa for the purposes of war, and the kings of Ceylon, Pegu,\r\nand Arracan, have from time immemorial employed them for this use. Sharp\r\nsword-blades were fastened to their trunks, and upon their backs were\r\nfixed small wooden castles, containing five or six men, armed with\r\njavelins, and other missile weapons. The Greeks and Romans, however,\r\nsoon learnt the best method of defence against these enormous warriors.\r\nThey opened their ranks to let them pass through, and directed their\r\nwhole attack against their riders. But since fire-arms have become the\r\nprincipal instruments of war, elephants, who are terrified both by the\r\nfire, and the noise of their discharge, would be of more detriment than\r\nadvantage to the party that should employ them. Some of the Indian\r\nkings, however, still use armed elephants in their wars. In Cochin, and\r\nother parts of Malabar, all the soldiers that do not fight on foot are\r\nmounted upon elephants. This is also the case in Tonquin, Siam, and\r\nPegu, where the use of fire-arms is but little known. The leader of the\r\nelephant sits astride upon his neck, and the combatants sit or stand\r\nupon other parts of his body. The elephants also prove very serviceable\r\nin passing rivers, and carry the baggage over on their backs. When their\r\nleaders have loaded them with a burden of several hundred weight, they\r\ntie cords to it, by which the soldiers hold fast and swim, or are drawn\r\nacross the river. In battle, a heavy iron chain is sometimes fastened to\r\nthe end of their trunk, which they swing about with such rapidity, as\r\nrenders it impossible for an enemy to approach them. Another service\r\nwhich these animals perform in war, consists in forcing open the gates\r\nof besieged towns or fortresses. This they do, by stemming themselves\r\nwith their haunches against the gates, and moving from side to side till\r\nthey have broken the hinges, and forced open the gate. In order to\r\nprevent this, the besieged have generally large nails fixed in the\r\ngates, and projecting to a considerable length.\r\n\r\nElephants are also employed for transporting heavy ordnance over\r\nmountains, in doing which they show a singular degree of ingenuity. When\r\noxen or horses are harnessed to a piece of ordnance, it requires the\r\nexertion of all their strength to draw it up an ascent. The elephant, in\r\nsuch cases, pushes the carriage forward with his forehead, and after\r\nevery push, stems his knees against the wheels, whereby he prevents it\r\nfrom rolling back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWild elephants were caught and trained at an early period; since we find\r\nArrian, who flourished about the 104th year of Christ, giving us the\r\nfollowing account of the manner of taking elephants in India. The\r\nIndians enclose a large spot of ground, with a trench about twenty feet\r\nwide, and fifteen high, to which there is access but in one part, and\r\nthis is a bridge, and is covered with turf; in order that these animals,\r\nwho are very subtle, may not suspect what is intended. Of the earth that\r\nis dug out of the trench, a kind of wall is raised, on the other side of\r\nwhich a little kind of chamber is made, where people conceal themselves\r\nin order to watch these animals, and its entrance is very small. In this\r\nenclosure two or three tame female elephants are set. The instant the\r\nwild elephants see or smell them, they run and whirl about so much, that\r\nat last they enter the enclosure; upon which the bridge is immediately\r\nbroken down, and the people upon the watch fly to the neighbouring\r\nvillages for help. After they have been broken for few days by hunger\r\nand thirst, people enter the enclosure upon the tame elephants, and\r\nwith these they attack them. As the wild ones are by this time very much\r\nweakened, it is impossible for them to make a long resistance. After\r\nthrowing them on the ground, men get upon their backs, having first made\r\na deep wound round their necks, about which they throw a rope, in order\r\nto put them to great pain in case they attempt to stir. Being tamed in\r\nthis manner, they suffer themselves to be led quietly to the houses with\r\nthe rest, where they are fed with grass and green corn, and tamed\r\ninsensibly by blows and hunger, till such time as they obey readily\r\ntheir master’s voice, and perfectly understand his language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a description of the process of catching wild elephants, related by\r\nJohn Corse, Esq. in the “Asiatic Researches,” he interests the reader by\r\nan account of the escape of one which had been tamed, and of his\r\nsubmission to his keeper when he was recaptured. He says, in June, 1787,\r\nJâttra-mungul, a male elephant taken the year before, was travelling in\r\ncompany with some other elephants towards Chittigong, laden with a tent,\r\nand some baggage for the accommodation of Mr. Buller and myself on the\r\njourney. Having come upon a tiger’s track, which elephants discover\r\nreadily by the smell, he took fright and ran off to the woods in spite\r\nof the efforts of his driver. On entering the wood, the driver saved\r\nhimself by springing from the elephant, and clinging to the branch of a\r\ntree, under which he was passing: when the elephant had got rid of his\r\ndriver, he soon contrived to shake off his load. As soon as he ran away,\r\na trained female was despatched after him, but could not get up in time\r\nto prevent his escape; she, however, brought back his driver, and the\r\nload he had thrown off, and we proceeded, without any hope of ever\r\nseeing him again.\r\n\r\nEighteen months after this, when a herd of elephants had been taken, and\r\nhad remained several days in the enclosure, till they were enticed into\r\nthe outlet, and there tied, and led out in the usual manner, one of the\r\ndrivers, viewing a male elephant very attentively, declared that he\r\nresembled the one which had run away. This excited the curiosity of\r\nevery one to go and look at him; but when any person came near, the\r\nanimal struck at him with his trunk, and, in every respect, appeared as\r\nwild and outrageous as any of the other elephants. At length, an old\r\nhunter, coming up and examining him narrowly, declared he was the very\r\nelephant that had made his escape.\r\n\r\nConfident of this, he boldly rode up to him, on a tame elephant, and\r\nordered him to lie down, pulling him by the ear at the same time. The\r\nanimal seemed quite taken by surprise, and instantly obeyed the word of\r\ncommand, with as much quickness as the ropes with which he was tied\r\npermitted; uttering at the same time a peculiar shrill squeak through\r\nhis trunk, as he had formerly been known to do; by which he was\r\nimmediately recognised by every person who had ever been acquainted with\r\nthis peculiarity.\r\n\r\nThus we see that this elephant, for the space of eight or ten days,\r\nduring which he was in the haddah, and even while he was tying in the\r\noutlet, appeared equally wild and fierce as the boldest elephant then\r\ntaken; so that he was not even suspected of having been formerly taken,\r\ntill he was conducted from the outlet. The moment, however, he was\r\naddressed in a commanding tone, the recollection of his former obedience\r\nseemed to rush upon him at once; and, without any difficulty, he\r\npermitted a driver to be seated on his neck, who in a few days made him\r\nas tractable as ever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBruce relates the Abyssinian mode of destroying the elephant from his\r\nown observation, during his return from Gondah, and while sojourning\r\nwith Ayto Confu. His narrative is in these words.\r\n\r\nThough we were all happy to our wish in this enchanted mountain, the\r\nactive spirit of Ayto Confu could not rest. He was come to hunt the\r\nelephant, and hunt him he would. All those that understood any thing of\r\nthis exercise had assembled from a great distance, to meet Ayto Confu at\r\nTcherkin. He and Engedan, from the moment they arrived, had been\r\noverlooking from the precipice their servants training and managing\r\ntheir horses in the market-place below. Great bunches of the finest\r\ncanes had been brought from Kawra for javelins; and the whole house was\r\nemployed in fitting heads to them in the most advantageous manner. For\r\nmy part, though I should have been very well contented to have remained\r\nwhere I was, yet the preparations for sport of so noble a kind roused my\r\nspirits, and made me desirous to join in it.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, an hour before day, after a hearty breakfast, we mounted on\r\nhorseback, to the number of about thirty, belonging to Ayto Confu. But\r\nthere was another body, both of horse and foot, which made hunting the\r\nelephant their particular business. These men dwell constantly in the\r\nwoods, and know very little of the use of bread, living entirely upon\r\nthe flesh of the beasts they kill, chiefly that of the elephant or\r\nrhinoceros. They are exceedingly thin, light, and agile, both on\r\nhorseback and foot; are very swarthy, though few of them black; none of\r\nthem woolly-headed, and all of them have European features. They are\r\ncalled _Agageer_, a name of their profession, not of their nation, which\r\ncomes from the word _agar_, and signifies to hough or hamstring with a\r\nsharp weapon. More properly it means the cutting of the tendon of the\r\nheel, and is a characteristic of the manner in which they kill the\r\nelephant, which is shortly as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo men, absolutely naked, without any rag or covering at all about\r\nthem, get on horseback; this precaution is for fear of being laid hold\r\nof by the trees or bushes in making their escape from a very watchful\r\nenemy. One of these riders sits upon the back of the horse, sometimes\r\nwith a saddle, and sometimes without one, with only a switch, or short\r\nstick in one hand, carefully managing the bridle with the other; behind\r\nhim sits his companion, who has no other arms but a broad-sword, such as\r\nis used by Sclavonians, and which is brought from Trieste. His left hand\r\nis employed grasping the sword by the handle; about fourteen inches of\r\nthe blade is covered with whipcord. This part he takes in his right\r\nhand, without any danger of being hurt by it; and, though the edges of\r\nthe lower part of the sword are as sharp as a razor, he carries it\r\nwithout a scabbard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the elephant is found feeding, the horseman rides before him\r\nas near his face as possible; or, if he flies, crosses him in all\r\ndirections, crying out, “I am such a man and such a man; this is my\r\nhorse, that has such a name; I killed your father in such a place, and\r\nyour grandfather in such another place; and I am now come to kill you;\r\nyou are but an ass in comparison of them.” This nonsense he verily\r\nbelieves the elephant understands, who, chased and angry at hearing the\r\nnoise immediately before him, seeks to seize him with his trunk, or\r\nproboscis; and, intent upon this, follows the horse everywhere, turning\r\nand turning round with him, neglectful of making his escape by running\r\nstraight forward, in which consists his only safety. After having made\r\nhim turn once or twice in pursuit of the horse, the horseman rides close\r\nup alongside of him, and drops his companion just behind on the off\r\nside; and while he engages the elephant’s attention upon the horse, the\r\nfootman behind gives him a drawn stroke just above the heel, or what in\r\nman is called the tendon of Achilles. This is the critical moment; the\r\nhorseman immediately wheels round, takes his companion up behind him,\r\nand rides off full speed after the rest of the herd, if they have\r\nstarted more than one; and sometimes an expert agageer will kill three\r\nout of one herd. If the sword is good, and the man not afraid, the\r\ntendon is commonly entirely separated; and if it is not cut through, it\r\nis generally so far divided, that the animal, with the stress he puts\r\nupon it, breaks the remaining part asunder. In either case, he remains\r\nincapable of advancing a step, till the horseman’s return, or his\r\ncompanions coming up pierce him through with javelins and lances: he\r\nthen falls to the ground, and expires with loss of blood.\r\n\r\nThe agageer nearest me presently lamed his elephant, and left him\r\nstanding. Ayto Engedan, Ayto Confu, Guebra Mariam, and several others,\r\nfixed their spears in the other before the agageer had cut his tendons.\r\nMy agageer however, having wounded the first elephant, failed in the\r\npursuit of the second; and being close upon him at the entrance of the\r\nwood, he received a violent blow from the branch of a tree which the\r\nelephant had bent by his weight, and, after passing, allowed it to\r\nreplace itself; when it knocked down both the riders, and very much hurt\r\nthe horse. This, indeed, is the great danger in elephant-hunting; for\r\nsome of the trees, that are dry and short, break by the violent pressure\r\nof so immense a body moving so rapidly, and fall upon the pursuers, or\r\nacross the roads. But the greatest number of these trees being of a\r\nsucculent quality, they bend without breaking, and return quickly to the\r\nformer position, when they strike both horse and man so violently, that\r\nthey often beat them to pieces. Dexterous too as the riders are, the\r\nelephant sometimes reaches them with his trunk, with which he dashes the\r\nhorse against the ground, and then sets his feet upon him, till he tears\r\nhim limb from limb with his proboscis; a great many hunters die this\r\nway. Besides this, the soil at this time of the year is split into deep\r\nchasms, or cavities, by the heat of the sun, so that nothing can be more\r\ndangerous than the riding.\r\n\r\nThe elephant once slain, they cut the whole of the flesh off his bones\r\ninto thongs, like the reins of a bridle, and hang these like festoons\r\nupon the branches of trees, till they become perfectly dry, without\r\nsalt; and then they lay them up for their provisions in the season of\r\nthe rains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very interesting account of the affection of a young elephant for its\r\nmother, concludes Bruce’s description of this cruel amusement.\r\n\r\nThere now remained but two elephants of those that had been discovered,\r\nwhich were a she one with a calf. The agageer would willingly have let\r\nthese alone, as the teeth of the female are very small, and the young\r\none is of no sort of value, even for food, its flesh shrinking much upon\r\ndying; but the hunters would not be limited in their sport. The people\r\nhaving observed the place of her retreat, thither we eagerly followed.\r\nShe was very soon found, and as soon lamed by the agageers; but when\r\nthey came to wound her with their darts, as every one did in turn, to\r\nour very great surprise, the young one, which had been suffered to\r\nescape unheeded and unpursued, came out from the thicket, apparently in\r\ngreat anger, running upon the horses and men with all the violence it\r\nwas master of. I was amazed, and as much as ever I was, upon such an\r\noccasion, afflicted at seeing the great affection of the little animal\r\ndefending its wounded mother, heedless of its own life or safety. I\r\ntherefore cried to them for God’s sake to spare the mother, though it\r\nwas then too late; and the calf had made several rude attacks upon me,\r\nwhich I avoided without difficulty; but I am happy to this day in the\r\nreflection that I did not strike it. At last, making one of his attacks\r\nupon Ayto Engedan, it hurt him a little upon the leg; upon which he\r\nthrust it through with his lance, as others did after, and then it fell\r\ndead before its wounded mother, whom it had so affectionately defended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bodies of elephants are frequently oiled, to prevent the effects of\r\nthe sun on them. They are fond of the water in hot weather, and seem\r\ndelighted when they are rubbed with a brick, or any hard substance, on\r\nthe upper part of the head. They are very sure-footed, have an active,\r\nshuffling gait, and generally travel about three or four miles an hour,\r\nbut may be urged on to six when goaded by a man who runs behind the\r\nanimal for that purpose. They are very fond of sugar-canes, and the\r\nleaves of the banyan; they can free a cocoa-nut from its tough coat,\r\ncrack it, and take out the nut free from the shell. A small race of\r\nelephants, from five to six feet in height, are much used about the\r\ncourt in the northern part of India. When the elephant passes through a\r\ncrowd, he is very careful to open a way with his trunk, that he may not\r\ninjure any one. This observation is strengthened by M. d’Obsonville, who\r\ninforms us that the baron de Lauriston was induced to go to Laknaor, the\r\ncapital of the Soubah, or viceroyalty of that name, at a time when an\r\nepidemic distemper was making the greatest ravages amongst the\r\ninhabitants. The principal road to the palace gate was covered with the\r\nsick and dying, extended on the ground, at the very moment when the\r\nnabob must necessarily pass. It appeared impossible for the elephant to\r\ndo otherwise than tread upon and crush many of these poor wretches in\r\nhis passage, unless the prince would stop till the way could be cleared;\r\nbut he was in haste, and such tenderness would be unbecoming in a\r\npersonage of his importance. The elephant, however, without appearing to\r\nslacken his pace, and without having received any command for that\r\npurpose, assisted them with his trunk, removed some, and stepped over\r\nthe rest with so much address and assiduity, that not one person was\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe proboscis of the elephant is the most distinguishing character in\r\nhis formation. It is hollow all along, but with a partition running from\r\none end of it to the other; so, though outwardly it appears like a\r\nsingle pipe, it is inwardly divided into two. This fleshy tube is\r\ncomposed of nerves and muscles, covered with a proper skin of a blackish\r\ncolour, like that of the rest of the body. It is capable of being moved\r\nin every direction, of being lengthened and shortened, of being bent or\r\nstraightened, so pliant as to embrace any body it is applied to, and yet\r\nso strong, that nothing can be torn from the gripe. To aid the force of\r\nthis grasp, there are little eminences, like a caterpillar’s feet, on\r\nthe underside of this instrument, which, without doubt, contribute to\r\nthe sensibility of the touch as well as to firmness of the hold. Through\r\nthis trunk the animal breathes, drinks, and smells, as through a tube;\r\nand at the very point of it, just above the nostrils, there is an\r\nextension of the skin, about five inches long, in the form of a finger,\r\nand which, in fact, answers all the purposes of one; for, with the rest\r\nof the extremity of the trunk, it is capable of assuming different forms\r\nat will, and, consequently, of being adapted to the minutest objects. By\r\nmeans of this the elephant can take a pin from the ground, untie the\r\nknots of a rope, unlock a door, and even write with a pen. “I have\r\nmyself seen,” says Ælian, “an elephant writing Latin characters on a\r\nboard, in a very orderly manner, his keeper only showing him the figure\r\nof each letter. While thus employed, the eyes might be observed\r\nstudiously cast down upon the writing, and exhibiting an appearance of\r\ngreat skill and erudition.” It sometimes happens that the object is too\r\nlarge for the trunk to grasp; in such a case the elephant makes use of\r\nanother expedient, as admirable as any of the former. It applies the\r\nextremity of the trunk to the surface of the object, and, sucking up its\r\nbreath, lifts and sustains such a weight as the air in that case is\r\ncapable of suspending. In this manner this instrument is useful in most\r\nof the purposes of life; it is an organ of smelling, of touching, and of\r\nsuction; it not only provides for the animal’s necessities and comforts,\r\nbut it also serves for its ornament and defence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Corse affirms, that the usual height of the male Asiatic elephant is\r\nfrom eight to ten feet, and, in one instance only, he saw one of ten\r\nfeet six inches. The young one at its birth is thirty-five inches; one\r\ngrew eleven inches in the first year; eight, six, and five, in the three\r\nsucceeding years. The full growth is at nineteen years. He says,\r\nelephants that have escaped from confinement have not sagacity to avoid\r\nbeing retaken, and they will breed in confinement. The young, he\r\nobserves, begin to nibble and suck the breast soon after birth, pressing\r\nit with the trunk, which, by mutual instinct, they know will make the\r\nmilk flow more readily into their mouths while sucking. Elephants never\r\nlie down to give their young ones suck; and it often happens, when the\r\ndam is tall, that she is obliged, for some time, to bend her body\r\ntowards her young, to enable him to reach the nipple with his mouth;\r\nconsequently, if ever the trunk were used to lay hold of the nipple, it\r\nwould be at this period, when he is making laborious efforts to reach it\r\nwith his mouth, but which he could always easily do with his trunk if it\r\nanswered the purpose. In sucking, the young elephant always grasps the\r\nnipple, which projects horizontally from the breast, with his mouth. Mr.\r\nCorse often observed this; and so sensible were the attendants of it,\r\nthat, with them, it is a common practice to raise a small mound of\r\nearth, about six or eight inches high, for the young one to stand on,\r\nand to save the mother the trouble of bending her body every time she\r\ngives suck, which she cannot readily do when tied to her picket. Tame\r\nelephants are never suffered to remain loose in India, as instances\r\noccur of the mother leaving even her young and escaping into the woods.\r\nAnother circumstance deserves notice: if a wild elephant happens to be\r\nseparated from her young for only two days, though giving suck, she\r\nnever afterwards recognises it. This separation happened, sometimes,\r\nunavoidably, when they were enticed, separately, into the kiddah.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElephants in India are taught to reverence the various sovereigns to\r\nwhom they belong, when they appear in his presence. They are then\r\ntrained to warfare, and rushing upon the enemy, as if conscious of their\r\nsuperior strength, beat down all before them. They have even been known\r\nto brave the hottest fire of the enemy’s artillery. Beauleu, in his\r\n“Voyage to the East Indies,” mentions that the king of Achen places his\r\nwhole strength in nine hundred elephants, which are bred to tread fire\r\nunder their feet, and to be unmoved at the shot of cannon, and likewise\r\nto salute the king when they pass by his apartments, by bending their\r\nknees, and raising their trunks three times. This traveller adds, that\r\nthey are influenced by exemplary punishment; and gives an instance of\r\nthe fact. The king of Achen, he says, having ordered the embarkation of\r\na hundred elephants for the siege of Dehly, when they were brought to\r\nthe coast not one of them would enter the ship. The king being\r\nacquainted with their behaviour, went in person to the shore, and after\r\nexpressing passion and rage at their disobedience, ordered one of them\r\nto be cut asunder in the presence of the rest; on which they all\r\npeaceably embarked, and were more than ordinary tractable during the\r\nwhole voyage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_White_ elephants are reverenced throughout the east, and the Chinese\r\npay them a certain kind of worship. The Burmese monarch is called the\r\n“king of the white elephants,” and is regarded under that title with\r\nmore than the ordinary veneration which oriental despotism exacts from\r\nits abject dependants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little island of Elephanta, opposite to the fort of Bombay, derives\r\nits name from a sculptured figure in stone, of the natural colour, and\r\nordinary size, of the animal. It is elevated on a platform of stone of\r\nthe same colour, and on the back of this granite elephant was a smaller\r\none, apparently of the same stone, which had been broken off. There is\r\nno history, nor any well grounded tradition, relative to this statue.\r\nThe island itself is distinguished for extraordinary antiquities,\r\nparticularly a magnificent temple hewn out of the solid rock, adorned by\r\nthe arts of sculpture and painting with statues and pictures, probably\r\nof more remote age than the earliest efforts of Greek or Roman genius.\r\nMany of these venerable representations suffered irreparable injury, and\r\nvast numbers were wholly destroyed, by the barbarian ravages of the\r\nPortuguese, who formerly obtained possession of the place, and dragged\r\nfield-pieces to the demolition of these the most curious, and, possibly,\r\nthe most ancient monuments of oriental grandeur. Queen Catharine of\r\nPortugal, who held the island in dower, was so sensible of the\r\nimportance of this spot, that she imagined it impossible that any\r\ntraveller on that side of India would return without exploring the\r\nwonders of the “Cave of Elephanta.” The island is destitute of all other\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat elephants are susceptible of the most tender attachment to each\r\nother, is evinced by the following occurrence, which is recorded in a\r\nFrench journal:--Two very young elephants, a male and a female, were\r\nbrought from the island of Ceylon to Holland. They had been separated\r\nfrom each other in order to be conveyed from the Hague to the Museum of\r\nNatural History, in Paris, where a spacious stable had been constructed\r\nfor them. This was divided into two partitions, which communicated to\r\neach other by means of a trap-door. Both of the divisions were\r\nsurrounded with strong wooden paling. The morning after their arrival\r\nthey were brought into this habitation: the male elephant was introduced\r\nfirst. With an air of suspicion he examined the place, tried each of the\r\nbeams by shaking it with his trunk to see if it was fast. He endeavoured\r\nto turn round the large screws which held them on the outside, but this\r\nhe found impracticable. When he came to the trap-door between the two\r\npartitions, he discovered that it was secured only by a perpendicular\r\niron bolt, which he lifted up, pushed open the door, and went into the\r\nother partition, where he ate his breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty that these animals had been separated in\r\norder to be conveyed singly to Paris, and having now not seen each other\r\nfor several months, the joy they expressed at meeting again is not to be\r\ndescribed. They immediately ran to each other, uttered a cry of joy that\r\nshook the whole building, and blew the air out of their trunks with such\r\nviolence, that it seemed like the blast of a smith’s bellows. The\r\npleasure which the female experienced seemed to be the most lively; she\r\nexpressed it by moving her ears with astonishing rapidity, and tenderly\r\ntwining her trunk round the body of the male. She laid it particularly\r\nto his ear, where she held it for a considerable time motionless, and\r\nafter having folded it again round his whole body, she applied it to her\r\nown mouth. The male in like manner folded his trunk round the body of\r\nthe female; and the pleasure which he felt at their meeting seemed to be\r\nof a more sentimental cast, for he expressed it by shedding an abundance\r\nof tears. Afterwards they had constantly one stable in common, and the\r\nmutual attachment between them excited the admiration of every beholder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following example shows that elephants are capable also of forming\r\nattachments to animals of a different species.\r\n\r\nAn elephant which the Turkish emperor sent as a present to the king of\r\nNaples, in the year 1740, displayed a particular attachment towards a\r\nram, that was confined, together with some other animals, in his\r\nstable. He even permitted him to butt at him with his horns, as these\r\nanimals are wont to do. But if the ram abused the liberty he gave him,\r\nthe only punishment he inflicted upon him for it was, that he took him\r\nup with his trunk, and threw him upon a dung-heap, though if any of the\r\nother animals attempted to take liberties with him, he dashed them with\r\nsuch violence against the wall, that he killed them on the spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn elephant, rendered furious by the wounds he had received in an\r\nengagement at Hambour, rushed into the plain uttering the most hideous\r\ncries. A soldier, whose comrades made him sensible of his danger by\r\ncalling to him, was unable on account of his wounds, to retreat with\r\nsufficient expedition out of the way of the enraged animal. But the\r\nelephant, when he came to him, seemed to be apprehensive lest he should\r\ntrample him with his feet, raised him with his trunk, and having laid\r\nhim gently on one side, continued his progress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Mahie, on the coast of Malabar, the owner of an elephant lent him out\r\nfor hire. His occupation consisted in drawing timber for building out of\r\na river, which he performed very dexterously with his trunk, under the\r\nguidance of a boy. He then piled the beams upon each other with such\r\nregularity, that no human being could have done it better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElephants do not merely obey the commands of their keeper while he is\r\npresent, but they perform also in his absence the most singular\r\noperations when they have previously been made acquainted with the\r\nnature of them. I once saw, says M. d’Obsonville, two elephants employed\r\nin demolishing a wall, in obedience to the orders previously received\r\nfrom their cornacks, who had encouraged them to undertake the task by a\r\npromise of fruit and brandy. They united their powers, placed their\r\ntrunks together, which were defended by a covering of leather, and\r\npushed with them against the strongest part of the wall; repeated their\r\nefforts, carefully watching at the same time the effect of the\r\nequilibrium, which they followed till the whole was sufficiently loose,\r\nwhen they exerted their whole strength in one more push, after which\r\nthey speedily retreated out of the reach of danger, and the whole wall\r\nfell to the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBosmann relates, that in December, 1700, an elephant came at six o’clock\r\nin the morning towards Fort Mina, on the Gold Coast, and took his road\r\nalong the river at the foot of Mount St. Jago. Some of the negroes ran\r\nunarmed about him, which he permitted without appearing to be in the\r\nleast degree suspicious of them. But a Dutch officer shot at him, and\r\nwounded him over his eye. The animal did not alter his course, but\r\npricking his ears, proceeded to the Dutch garden, where he saw the\r\ndirector-general and other officers belonging to the fort, sitting under\r\nthe shade of some palm-trees. He had torn down about a dozen of these\r\ntrees with the greatest facility, when upwards of an hundred bullets\r\nwere discharged at him. He bled over his whole body, but still kept his\r\nlegs, and did not halt in the least. A negro now, to plague the\r\nelephant, pulled him by the tail, at which the animal, being provoked,\r\nseized him with his trunk, threw him to the ground, and thrust his tusks\r\ntwice through his body. As soon as the negro was killed, he turned from\r\nhim, and suffered the other negroes to take away his body unmolested. He\r\nnow remained upwards of an hour longer in the garden, and seemed to have\r\ndirected his attention to the Dutchmen who were sitting at a distance of\r\nfifteen or sixteen paces from him. As these had expended their\r\nammunition, and feared that the elephant might attack them, they made\r\ntheir retreat. In the mean time the elephant was come to another gate,\r\nand although the garden-wall consisted of a double row of stones, he\r\neasily threw it down, and went out by the breach. He then walked slowly\r\nto a rivulet, and washed off the blood with which he was covered: after\r\nthat he returned to the palm-trees, and broke some boards that were\r\nplaced there for the purpose of building a vessel. The Dutchmen had in\r\nthe mean time procured a fresh supply of powder and ball, and their\r\nrepeated shots at length put the elephant out of condition to make\r\nfurther resistance. They then with great difficulty cut off his trunk,\r\nupon which the elephant, who till then had not uttered a sound, set up a\r\nhideous roar, threw himself down under a tree, and expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Further particulars concerning Elephants generally.~\r\n\r\nThe elephant is not an enemy to any other animal. It is said that the\r\nmouse is the only quadruped that is an enemy to him, and that this\r\nlittle quadruped holds him in perpetual fear. He sleeps with the end of\r\nhis proboscis so close to the earth, that nothing but the air he\r\nbreathes can get between; for the mouse is affirmed to enter its\r\norifice, when he finds it possible, and, making his way to the\r\nelephant’s vital parts in search of food or shelter, by that means\r\ndestroys the mighty tenement wherein his own littleness is ensconced.\r\n\r\nThe great dean of St. Paul’s, if he may be so called without\r\ndisparagement to Colet, has two noble stanzas on this subject on “The\r\nProgress of the Soul.” They were read to the editor of the _Every-Day\r\nBook_, by one of the kindest of human beings, himself a poet, from his\r\nown copy of the book wherein the hand of a friend, the greatest living\r\npoet, and perhaps the greatest mind of our country hath penned, that\r\n“Donne’s rhythm was as inexplicable to the many as blank verse, spite of\r\nhis rhymes.--Not one in a thousand of his readers have any notion how\r\nhis lines are to be read. To read Dryden, Pope, &c. you need only count\r\nsyllables; but to read Donne you must measure _time_, and discover the\r\n_time_ of each word by the sense and passion.” Having presumed on the\r\nwonted indulgence of friendship, by this transcription from the\r\nmanuscript notes of a borrowed volume, for counsel and caution in the\r\npresent reader’s behalf, the verses are submitted to his regard.\r\n\r\n    Natures great master-piece, an Elephant,\r\n    The onely harmelesse great thing; the giant\r\n    Of beasts; who thought none had, to make him wise,\r\n    But to be just, and thankful, loth t’ offend\r\n    (Yet nature hath given him no knees to bend)\r\n    Himself he up-props, on himself relies,\r\n    And foe to none; suspects no enemies,\r\n    Still sleeping stood; vext not his fantasie\r\n    Black dreams, like an unbent bow carelessly\r\n      His sinewy Proboscis did remisly lie.\r\n\r\n    In which as in a gallery this mouse\r\n    Walk’d and survey’d the rooms of this vast house,\r\n    And to the brain, the soul’s bed chamber, went,\r\n    And gnaw’d the life cords there; Like a whole town\r\n    Clean undermin’d the slain beast tumbled down;\r\n    With him the murth’rer dies, whom envy sent\r\n    To kill, not scape; for onely he that meant\r\n    To die, did ever kill a man of better roome;\r\n    And thus he made his foe, his prey and tombe:\r\n    Who cares not to turn back, may any whither come.\r\n\r\n  _Donne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “elephant,” according to Randle Holme, is regarded, in heraldry, as\r\n“the emblem of vigilance, _nec jacet in somno_; but, like a faithful\r\nwatchman, sleeps in a sentinel’s posture; it denoteth strength,\r\ningenuity, and ambition of people’s praise; it signifieth also meekness\r\nand devotion.” He mentions an elephant _argent_ on a shield _gules_,\r\nthat “this coat is born by the name of Elphinston.” Describing that\r\n“they (the elephant) are a great and vast creature,” he says, that “an\r\nelephant’s head erased _gules_,” on a shield _argent_, “is borne, by the\r\nname of Brodric.” In explanation of this bearing, Holme’s knowledge\r\nseems to have been more correct in heraldry than in natural history, for\r\nhe declares that “this should be termed a she-elephant, or the head of a\r\nfemale elephant; by reason his tusks or teeth stand upwards, and the\r\nmale stands downwards; but this,” says our lamenting herald, “is a thing\r\nin heraldry not observed.” He positively affirms, that “it were\r\nsufficient distinction for a coat of arms between families” (!) as much\r\na distinction “as the bearing of a ram and a ewe, or a lion with red\r\nclaws, and another with yellow; and much more (distinctive) than ermyne\r\nand ermynites, (they) being both one, save (that) the last hath one hair\r\nof red on each side of every one of the poulderings: a thing little\r\nregarded, makes a great alteration in arms.” His discrepant distinctions\r\nbetween the male and female are exceedingly amusing, and he is quite as\r\ndiverting with their trunks. He figures their “snowts inwards, or snowts\r\n_respected_,” which, he says, is “a term used when things (either quick\r\nor dead) are, as it were, regarding or looking one at another.” Then he\r\ngives a bearing “_Argent_ out of a coronet _or_; two proboscides (or\r\ntrunks) of two elephants reflected endorsed, _gules_, each adorned with\r\nthree trefoils, _vert_. This” says Holme, “is a very great bearing\r\namongst the Dutch, as their books of herauldry inform me; for there is\r\nscores of those families, bear the elephant’s trunk thus: some adorned\r\nwith roses, leaves, pendants, crosses, or with other varieties of\r\nthings, each set at a certain distance from the trunk by a footstalk.\r\nNow,” he goes on to say, with a hand most carefully pointing to the\r\nimportant fact, thus--“☞Now, in the blazon of such coates, you must\r\nfirst observe the _reflection_ of the proboscides, whether the snowts\r\nstand respected, or endorsed; and then to tell the exact number of\r\nthings, each one is endorsed withall: for in some, they will have one\r\nthing apeece, others 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. Some, again, will have (with the\r\nsides, and others without the sides, adorning,) such and such things set\r\nin the concave or hole of the snowt.” He refers to precedents for these\r\nessential particulars, and in a page, wherein he assigns “the left _arm_\r\nof a devil, or fiend with a devil-like _foot_,” for “the coat of\r\n_Spittachar_,” he gives to “the name of Oberstagh,” on a field _argent_,\r\n“the proboscide of an elephant erected and couped, bowed or imbowed,\r\n_or_; maned, or haired, to the middle, _azure_; and collared at the\r\nbottom with an hawk’s bill fixed thereunto, _gules_; out of the snowte,\r\na Dutch fane pendant _sable_.” So likewise by taking, for your guide,\r\nhis descriptions under a “demy talbot, his feet converted, turned, or\r\nmetamorphosed into elephants’ snowts, with two flowers de lis _issuant_,\r\nyou shall have demy men, women, lions, and other creatures born with\r\nseveral sorts of things in the places of hands and feet.” We will not,\r\nhowever, travel on his “elephants’ snouts in coat armour,” beyond a\r\nfield _or_, with “the proboscide of an elephant, erected, flexed and\r\nrecurved _gules_, issuing out of a pierced place; towards the basis\r\nthereof, a rose-sprig vertant et revertant, about the trunk to the\r\nmiddle thereof _proper_.” According to Holme, this elegant bearing may\r\nbe claimed by any reader who has the happiness to bear “the name of Van\r\nSnotflough.” Concerning, however, “snowts bowed, and imbowed, erected\r\nand couped,” Holme guardedly adds that “these things, though I from my\r\nauthor, and from their similitude to an elephant’s trunk, have all along\r\ntermed them so, yet, in my judgment they would pass better for horns,\r\nand I take them to be absolute horns.” Thus, “at one fell swoop,” when\r\ndestitute readers may be large with speculation raised by our friend\r\nHolme, he disturbs their fond regards, and they who contemplate glorious\r\n“atchievements” with the “proboscides of elephants,” must either content\r\nthemselves with “absolute horns,” or gaze on empty “fields.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn several parts of India, elephants are employed to perform upon\r\ncriminals the office of an executioner. With their trunks they break the\r\nlimbs of the culprit, trample him to death, or impale him upon their\r\ntusks, according as they are ordered by their master.\r\n\r\nThis use of elephants in the east, and their sagacity, is alluded to by\r\none of our poets:--\r\n\r\n    Borri records their strength of parts,\r\n    Extent of thought, and skill in arts;\r\n    How they perform the law’s decrees,\r\n    And save the state the hangman’s fees:\r\n    And how by travel understand\r\n    The language of another land.\r\n    Let those who question this report\r\n    To Pliny’s ancient page resort;\r\n    How learn’d was that sagacious breed,\r\n    Who now, like them, the Greek can read.\r\n\r\n  _Gay._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of “The Chase” elegantly describes one of the devices by\r\nwhich the elephant is caught in his own domains:--\r\n\r\n        On distant Ethiopia’s sunburnt coasts,\r\n    The black inhabitants a pitfall frame,\r\n    With slender poles the wide capacious mouth,\r\n    And hurdles slight, they close; o’er these is spread\r\n    A floor of verdant turf, with all its flowers\r\n    Smiling delusive, and from strictest search\r\n    Concealing the deep grave that yawns below.\r\n    Then boughs of trees they cut, with tempting fruit\r\n    Of various kinds surcharg’d, the downy peach,\r\n    The clustering vine, and of bright golden rind\r\n    The fragrant orange. Soon as evening grey\r\n    Advances slow, besprinkling all around\r\n    With kind refreshing dews the thirsty globe,\r\n    The stately elephant from the close shade\r\n    With step majestic strides, eager to taste\r\n    The cooler breeze, that from the sea-beat shore\r\n    Delightful breathes, or in the limpid stream\r\n    To lave his panting sides; joyous he scents\r\n    The rich repast, unweeting of the death\r\n    That lurks within. And soon he sporting breaks\r\n    The brittle boughs, and greedily devours\r\n    The fruit delicious. Ah! too dearly bought;\r\n    The price is life. For now the treacherous turf\r\n    Trembling gives way; and the unwieldy beast\r\n    Self sinking, drops into the dark profound.\r\n    So when dilated vapours, struggling, heave\r\n    Th’ incumbent earth; if chance the cavern’d ground\r\n    Shrinking subside, and the thin surface yield,\r\n    Down sinks at once the ponderous dome, ingulph’d\r\n    With all its towers.\r\n\r\n  _Somervile._\r\n\r\nAccording to Bayle, the Romans called elephants _Boves Lucas_, because,\r\nas it is reported, they saw them for the first time in Lucania, during a\r\ngreat battle with Pyrrhus. The issue of the conflict was extremely\r\ndoubtful, for the ground on both sides was lost and won seven times;\r\nbut, at last, the Epirotes got the victory by means of their elephants,\r\nwhose smell frighted the Roman horses. In a subsequent engagement they\r\nwere fatal to Pyrrhus; they threw his troops into disorder, and the\r\nRomans were victorious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Elephantiasis_ is a disease in man, deriving its name from the\r\nelephant, who is also afflicted with a similar disorder. It is also\r\ncalled the Arabian leprosy. Medical treatises describe its appearances,\r\nmode of cure in the human being. As few readers possess elephants, it\r\nwill not be necessary to say more of it, than that it is cutaneous; and\r\nthat to prevent it in the elephant, the Indians apply oil to the\r\nanimal’s skin, which, to preserve its pliancy, they frequently bathe\r\nwith the unctuous fluid.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the elephant’s skin, which are not callous, are seized\r\nupon by flies, and they torture the animal exceedingly. His tail is too\r\nshort to reach any portion of his body, and his trunk alone is\r\ninsufficient to defend him from myriads of his petty enemies. In his\r\nnative forests he snaps branches from the trees, and with his trunk\r\nbrushes off his tormentors, and fans the air to prevent their settling\r\non him. In a confined state, he converts a truss of hay into a wisp for\r\nthe same purpose; and he often gathers up the dust with his trunk and\r\ncovers the sensible places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is related by M. Navarette, that at Macassar, an elephant driver had\r\na cocoa nut given him, which, out of wantonness, he struck twice against\r\nhis elephant’s forehead to break, and that, the day following, the\r\nanimal saw some cocoa nuts exposed in the street for sale, one of which\r\nhe took up with his trunk, and beat it about the driver’s head, till the\r\nman was completely dead. “This comes,” says our author, “of jesting with\r\nelephants.”\r\n\r\nA sentinel at the Menagerie in Paris, used often to desire the visitors\r\nnot to give the elephants any thing to eat. This admonition was\r\nparticularly disagreeable to the female elephant, and she took a great\r\ndislike to the sentinel. She had several times endeavoured to make him\r\ndesist from interfering, by squirting water over his head, but without\r\neffect. One day, when several persons came to see these animals, one of\r\nthem offered a piece of bread to the female, which being perceived by\r\nthe sentinel, just as he was opening his mouth to repeat his usual\r\nadmonition, the elephant stepped opposite to him, and threw a large\r\nquantity of water into his face. This excited the laughter of all the\r\nby-standers; but the sentinel coolly wiped his face, placed himself a\r\nlittle on one side, and was as usual very vigilant. Not long after he\r\nagain found occasion to repeat his former admonition to the spectators;\r\nbut scarcely had he done it when the elephant tore his musket out of his\r\nhand, wound her trunk round it, trod upon it, and did not deliver it\r\nagain to him till after she had twisted it completely into the form of a\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA person resident in Ceylon, near a place where elephants were daily led\r\nto water, often used to sit at the door of his house, and occasionally\r\nto give to one of these animals some fig-leaves, a food to which\r\nelephants are very partial. Once he took it into his head to play the\r\nelephant a trick. He wrapped a stone round with fig-leaves, and said to\r\nthe cornack (the keeper of the elephants) “This time I will give him a\r\nstone to eat, and see how it will agree with him.” The cornack answered,\r\n“that the elephant would not be such a fool as to swallow the stone.”\r\nThe man, however, reached the stone to the elephant, who taking it with\r\nhis trunk applied it to his mouth, and immediately let it fall to the\r\nground. “You see,” said the cornack, “that I was right.” Saying these\r\nwords, he drove away his elephants, and after having watered them, was\r\nconducting them again to their stable. The man who had played the\r\nelephant the trick with the stone was still sitting at his door, when,\r\nbefore he was aware, the animal made at him, threw his trunk round him,\r\nand dashing him to the ground trampled him immediately to death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll Naples, says Sonnini, in one of his notes to Buffon’s “Natural\r\nHistory,” has witnessed the docility and sagacity of an elephant that\r\nbelonged to the king. He afforded great assistance to the masons that\r\nwere at work upon the palace, by reaching them the water they required,\r\nwhich he fetched in large copper vessels from a neighbouring well. He\r\nhad observed that these vessels were carried to the brazier’s when they\r\nwanted any repair. Observing, therefore, one day that the water ran out\r\nat the bottom of one of them, he carried it of his own accord to the\r\nbrazier, and having waited while it was repairing, received it again\r\nfrom him, and returned to his work. This elephant used to go about the\r\nstreets of Naples without ever injuring any one: he was fond of playing\r\nwith children, whom he took up with his trunk, placed them on his back,\r\nand set them down again on the ground without their ever receiving the\r\nsmallest hurt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable instance of an elephant’s attachment to a very\r\nyoung child. The animal was never happy but when it was near him: the\r\nnurse used, therefore, very frequently to take the child in its cradle,\r\nand place it between his feet, and this he became at length so\r\naccustomed to, that he would never eat his food except when it was\r\npresent. When the child slept he used to drive off the flies with his\r\nproboscis, and when it cried he would move the cradle backward and\r\nforward, and thus again rock it to sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nÆlian relates that a man of rank in India, having very carefully trained\r\nup a female elephant, used daily to ride upon her, and gave her many\r\nproofs of his attachment to her. The king of the country, who had heard\r\nof the extraordinary gentleness and capacity of this animal, demanded\r\nher of her owner; but he, unwilling to part with his favourite, fled\r\nwith her to the mountains. By order of the king he was pursued, and the\r\nsoldiers that were sent after him having overtaken him when he was at\r\nthe top of a steep hill, he defended himself by throwing stones at them,\r\nin which he was faithfully assisted by the elephant, who had learnt to\r\nthrow stones with great dexterity. At length, however, the soldiers\r\ngained the summit of the hill, and were about to seize the fugitive,\r\nwhen the elephant rushed amongst them with the utmost fury, trampled\r\nsome of them to death, dashed others to the ground with her trunk, and\r\nput the rest to flight. She then placed her master, who was wounded in\r\nthe contest, upon her back, and conveyed him to a place of security.\r\nThere are numerous well-attested anecdotes of similar instances of the\r\naffection of elephants towards their owners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf elephants meet with a sick or wounded animal of their own species,\r\nthey afford him all the assistance in their power. Should he die, they\r\nbury him, and carefully cover his body with branches of trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring a war in the East Indies, an elephant, that had received a\r\nflesh-wound from a cannon-ball, was conducted twice or thrice to the\r\nhospital, where he stretched himself upon the ground to have his wounds\r\ndressed. He afterwards always went thither by himself. The surgeon\r\nemployed such means as he thought would conduce to his cure; he several\r\ntimes even cauterized the wound, and although the animal expressed the\r\npain which this operation occasioned him, by the most piteous groaning,\r\nyet he never showed any other sentiments towards the operator than\r\nthose of gratitude and affection. The surgeon was fortunate enough to\r\ncompletely cure him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a further anecdote of this animal’s gratitude. A soldier at\r\nPondicherry, who was accustomed, whenever he received a portion that\r\ncame to his share, to carry a certain quantity of it to an elephant,\r\nhaving one day drank rather too freely, and finding himself pursued by\r\nthe guards, who were going to take him to prison, took refuge under the\r\nelephant’s body and fell asleep. In vain did the guard try to force him\r\nfrom this asylum: the elephant protected him with his trunk. The next\r\nmorning the soldier recovering from his drunken fit, shuddered to find\r\nhimself stretched under the belly of this huge animal. The elephant,\r\nwhich, without doubt, perceived the embarrassment of the poor fellow,\r\ncaressed him with his trunk, in order to dissipate his fears, and make\r\nhim understand that he might now depart in safety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the poet of “The Seasons” refers to the\r\nsagacity of the elephant, his seclusion in his natural state, the arts\r\nby which he is ensnared, the magnificence of his appearance in oriental\r\nsolemnities, and his use in warfare:--\r\n\r\n         Peaceful, beneath primeval trees, that cast\r\n    Their ample shade o’er Niger’s yellow stream,\r\n    And where the Ganges rolls his sacred wave;\r\n    Or mid the central depth of blackening woods,\r\n    High rais’d in solemn theatre around,\r\n    Leans the huge elephant: wisest of brutes!\r\n    O truly wise! with gentle might endow’d,\r\n    Though powerful, not destructive! Here he sees\r\n    Revolving ages sweep the changeful earth,\r\n    And empires rise and fall; regardless he\r\n    Of what the never-resting race of men\r\n    Project: thrice happy! could he ’scape their guile,\r\n    Who mine, from cruel avarice, his steps;\r\n    Or with his towery grandeur swell their state,\r\n    The pride of kings! or else his strength pervert,\r\n    And bid him rage among the mortal fray,\r\n    Astonish’d at the madness of mankind.\r\n\r\n  _Thomson._\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of September, 1763, captain Sampson presented an elephant,\r\nbrought by him from Bengal, to his majesty, at the queen’s house. It was\r\nconducted from Rotherhithe that morning at two o’clock, and two blacks\r\nand a seaman rode on his back. The animal was about eight feet high.\r\n\r\nThe zebra, now well known from its being frequently brought into this\r\ncountry, was at that time almost a “stranger in England.” One of them\r\nhaving been given to her late majesty queen Charlotte, obtained the\r\nname of the “queen’s ass,” and was honoured by a residence in the tower,\r\nwhither the elephant was also conveyed. Their companionship occasioned\r\nsome witticisms, of which there remains this specimen.\r\n\r\nEPIGRAM\r\n\r\n_On the Elephant’s being placed in the same table with the Zebra._\r\n\r\n    Ye critics so learn’d, whence comes it to pass\r\n    That the elephant wise should be plac’d by an ass?\r\n    This matter so strange I’ll unfold in a trice,\r\n    Some asses of state stand in need of advice\r\n    To screen them from justice, lest in an ill hour,\r\n    In the elephant’s stead they be sent to the tower.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of captain Sampson’s present to the king, several\r\naccounts of the elephant were written. One of them says, that “the\r\nlargest and finest elephants in the world are those in the island of\r\nCeylon; next to them, those of the continent of India; and lastly, the\r\nelephant of Africa.” The Moors, who deal in these animals throughout the\r\nIndies, have a fixed price for the ordinary sort, according to their\r\nsize. They measure from the nail of the fore foot to the top of the\r\nshoulder, and for every cubit high they give after the rate of 100_l._\r\nof our money. An African elephant of the largest size measures about\r\nnine cubits, or thirteen feet and a half in height, and is worth about\r\n900_l._, but of the breed of Ceylon, four times that sum.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTavernier, in proof of the superiority of the elephant of Ceylon, says,\r\n“One, I will tell you, hardly to be believed, but that which is a\r\ncertain truth, which is, that when any other king, or rajah, has one of\r\nthese elephants of Ceylon, if they bring them any other breed in any\r\nother place whatever, so soon as the other elephants behold the Ceylon\r\nelephants, by an instinct of nature, they do them reverence, by laying\r\ntheir trunks upon the ground, and raising them up again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough Cæsar does not mention the fact in his commentaries, yet it is\r\ncertain that he brought elephants with him to England, and that they\r\ncontributed to his conquest of our predecessors. Polyænus in his\r\n“Stratagems,” says, “Cæsar in Britain attempted to pass a great river,\r\n(supposed the Thames:) Casolaunus, (in Cæsar, Cassivellaunus) king of\r\nthe Britons, opposed his passage with a large body of horse and\r\nchariots. Cæsar had in his company a vastly large elephant, (μεγιστος\r\nἑλεφας) a creature before that time unknown to the Britons. This\r\nelephant he fenced with an iron coat of mail, built a large turret on\r\nit, and putting up bowmen and slingers, ordered them to pass first into\r\nthe stream. The Britons were dismayed at the sight of such an unknown\r\nand monstrous beast, (ἁοραλον κ’ ὑπεροφες θηριον) they fled, therefore,\r\nwith their horses and chariots, and the Romans passed the river without\r\nopposition, terrifying their enemies by this single creature.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1730, or 1731, some workmen digging the great sewer in Pall Mall,\r\n“over against the King’s Arms tavern,” discovered at the depth of\r\ntwenty-eight feet, several bones of an elephant. The strata below the\r\nsurface were ten or twelve feet of artificial soil; below that four or\r\nfive feet of yellow sand, varying in colour till they came to the bed\r\nwherein the bones were found, which consisted of exceedingly fine sand\r\nsimilar to that dug on Hampstead heath.\r\n\r\nAbout eighteen years previously, elephants’ bones were discovered in\r\ndigging in St. James’s-square; and about fourteen years before that some\r\nwere found in the same place. These various animal remains in that\r\nneighbourhood lay at about the same depth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1740, the remains of an elephant were discovered by some labourers\r\nwhile digging a trench in the park of Frances Biddulph, esq. at Benton,\r\nin Sussex. The bones did not lie close together as those of a skeleton\r\nusually do. It was evident that the various parallel strata of the earth\r\nhad never been disturbed; it was concluded that these animal deposits\r\nhad remained there from the period of the deluge, when it was presumed\r\nthat they had been conveyed and there, left, on the subsidence of the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1756, the workmen of a gentleman, digging upon a high hill near\r\nMendip for ochre and ore, discovered, at the depth of 315 feet from the\r\nsurface, four teeth, not tusks, and two thighbones with part of the\r\nhead of an elephant. Remains of the same animal have been at periods\r\ndiscovered at Mersey Island in Essex, at Harwich, at Chartham near\r\nCanterbury, at Bowden Parva, in Norfolk, Suffolk, Northamptonshire, and\r\nin various other parts of Great Britain and Ireland. Elephant’s teeth\r\nwere discovered at Islington, in digging a gravel pit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShakspeare, in “Troilus and Cressida,” compares the slowness of Ajax to\r\nthat of the elephant; and in the same play he again compares him to the\r\nsame animal, and afterwards continues the comparison.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe, that the elephant was adopted at that period\r\nas the sign of a public inn. Antonio in “Twelfth Night” tells\r\nSebastian,--\r\n\r\n    “In the south suburbs at the Elephant\r\n    Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,\r\n    While you beguile your time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    NATURALISTS’ CALENDER.\r\n\r\n    Mean Temperature 39·65.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ~March 10.~\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Benjamin West._\r\n\r\n    A few anecdotes of this eminent painter,\r\n    who died on the 10th of March, 1820,\r\n    are related in vol. i. p. 346.

D. vicar of that parish. He was descended from a respectable family,\r\noriginally from Scotland, a branch of which was settled in Ireland. His\r\nfather, who had been educated in Trinity-college, Dublin, held, at the\r\ntime of his son’s birth, the living of Edernin, and a prebend in the\r\ncathedral of Ferns. Dr. Gregory was born on April 14, 1754, but whether\r\nin Dublin or in Lancashire, of which county his mother was a native, is\r\nuncertain. When twelve years of age, at the death of his father, he was\r\nremoved to Liverpool, where his mother fixed her residence, desiring to\r\nplace him in commerce; but a taste for literature being his ruling\r\npropensity, he studied in the university of Edinburgh, in 1776 entered\r\ninto holy orders, and his first station in the church was in the\r\ncapacity of a curate at Liverpool. His attachments were chiefly among\r\nthe liberal and literary. In conjunction with Mr. Roscoe, and other\r\ncongenial spirits, Dr. Gregory had the merit of publicly exposing the\r\ncruelty and injustice of the slave trade in the principal seat of that\r\ntraffic. In 1782, he removed to London, and obtained the curacy of St.\r\nGiles’s, Cripplegate, which, on account of the weight of its parochial\r\nduty, he left in three years, though by a general invitation he was\r\nrecalled as morning preacher in 1788; and on the death of the vicar in\r\n1802, a request was presented to the dean and chapter of St. Paul’s,\r\nsigned by every inhabitant, that he might succeed to the vacancy. In the\r\nmean time he pursued with indefatigable industry those literary\r\noccupations, which, in various ways, have benefited the public. Dr.\r\nGregory was a useful writer who, without aiming, except rarely, at the\r\nreputation of original composition, performed real services to letters,\r\nby employing a practised style, an exercised judgment, and extensive\r\ninformation, in works of compilation or abridgement, adapted to the use\r\nof that numerous class who desire to obtain knowledge in a compendious\r\nmanner. His publications were successfully planned and ably executed. He\r\nserved at different times the curacy and lectureship of St. Botolph, the\r\nlectureship of St. Luke’s, and a weekly lectureship of St. Antholin’s,\r\nand was elected evening preacher at the Foundling hospital, which the\r\nstate of his health obliged him to resign. The bishop of London\r\npresented him with a small prebend in the cathedral of St. Paul’s, which\r\nhe relinquished on receiving the rectory of Stapleford, Herts. In 1804,\r\nhe was presented by Lord Sidmouth (then Mr. Addington) with the valuable\r\nliving of West Ham, in Essex, when he resigned every other clerical\r\ncharge except that of Cripplegate, to which parish he was attached by\r\nwarm feelings of gratitude.\r\n\r\nAt West Ham he passed four years, discharging with fidelity his duties\r\nas a clergyman and a magistrate, and occupying his leisure with\r\nliterature. Life was endeared to him by domestic enjoyments in the bosom\r\nof an amiable and affectionate family, and by the society of many\r\nfriends, whom he was much valued for his perpetual readiness to serve\r\nand oblige, and the unaffected cheerfulness of his conversation. Without\r\nany decided cause of illness, the powers of his constitution suddenly\r\nand all together gave way; every vital function was debilitated, and\r\nafter a short confinement, he expired with the calm resignation and\r\nanimating hopes of a christian. Among his numerous works are, “Essays,\r\nhistorical and moral,” a “Translation of Lowth’s Lectures on the Sacred\r\nPoetry of the Hebrews,” a “Church History,” from which he acquired\r\ncelebrity with the inquiring, “The Economy of Nature,” and a well-known\r\n“Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.”[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nThe interment of the late duchess of Rutland, at Bottesford, the family\r\nburialplace, has had a more than usual number of persons to visit its\r\nmany sepulchral monuments. One of them to the memory of Francis Manners,\r\nearl of Rutland, who lies buried here, is very splendid. It represents\r\nhim with his countess in a kneeling posture, and two children who are\r\nsupposed to have been _bewitch’d to death_. The inscription to that\r\neffect I read, and procured a copy of the particulars from an old book\r\nwhich is always read to visiters by the sexton; and which, as to the\r\nexecution of the alleged criminals at Lincoln, on the 12th of March,\r\n1618, I find to be correct, and send it for your use.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  B. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n  _Newark, Feb. 22, 1826._\r\n\r\nThe only alteration in the transcript is a variation from inaccurate\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT\r\n\r\n_From the Church Book of Bottesford._\r\n\r\nWhen the Right Hon. Sir Francis Manners succeeded his Brother Roger in\r\nthe Earldom of Rutland, and took possession of Belvoir Castle, and of\r\nthe Estates belonging to the Earldom, He took such Honourable measures\r\nin the Courses of his Life, that He neither displaced Tenants,\r\ndischarged Servants, nor denied the access of the poor; but, making\r\nStrangers welcome, did all the good offices of a Noble Lord, by which he\r\ngot the Love and good-will of the Country, his Noble Countess being of\r\nthe same disposition: So that Belvoir Castle was a continual Place of\r\nEntertainment, Especially to Neighbours, where Joan Flower and her\r\nDaughter were not only relieved at the first, but Joan was also admitted\r\nChairwoman and her daughter Margarett as a Continual Dweller in the\r\nCastle, looking to the Poultry abroad, and the washhouse at Home; and\r\nthus they Continued till found guilty of some misdemeanor which was\r\ndiscovered to the Lady. The first complaint against Joan Flower the\r\nMother was that she was a Monstrous malicious Woman, full of Oaths,\r\nCurses, and irreligious Imprecations, and, as far as appeared, a plain\r\nAtheist. As for Margarett, her Daughter, she was frequently accused of\r\ngoing from the Castle, and carrying Provisions away in unreasonable\r\nQuantities, and returning in such unseasonable Hours that they could not\r\nbut Conjecture at some mischief amongst them; and that their\r\nextraordinary Expences tended both to rob the Lady and served also to\r\nmaintain some debauched and Idle Company which frequented Joan Flower’s\r\nHouse. In some time the Countess misliking her (Joan’s) Daughter\r\nMargarett, and discovering some Indecencies in her Life, and the Neglect\r\nof her Business, discharged her from lying any more in the Castle, yet\r\ngave her forty Shillings, a Bolster, and a Mattress of wool, commanding\r\nher to go Home. But at last these Wicked Women became so malicious and\r\nrevengeful, that the Earl’s Family were sensible of their wicked\r\nDispositions; for, first, his Eldest Son Henry Lord Ross was taken sick\r\nafter a strange Manner, and in a little time Died; and, after, Francis\r\nLord Ross was Severely tortured and tormented by them, with a Strange\r\nsickness, which caused his Death. Also, and presently after, the Lady\r\nCatherine was set upon by their Devilish Practices, and very frequently\r\nin Danger of her Life, in strange and unusual Fits; and, as they\r\nconfessed, both the Earl and his Countess were so Bewitched that they\r\nshould have no more Children. In a little time after they were\r\nApprehended and carried to Lincoln Jail, after due Examination before\r\nsufficient Justices and discreet Magistrates.\r\n\r\nJoan Flower before her Conviction called for bread and butter, and\r\nwished it might never go through her if she were guilty of the Matter\r\nshe was Accused of; and upon mumbling of it in her Mouth she never spoke\r\nmore, but fell down and Died, as she was carried to Lincoln Jail, being\r\nextremely tormented both in Soul and Body, and was Buried at Ancaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Examination of Margarett Flower the 22nd of January, 1618._\r\n\r\nShe confessed that, about four years since, her Mother sent her for the\r\nright Hand glove of Henry Lord Ross, and afterwards her Mother bid her\r\ngo again to the Castle of Belvoir, and bring down the glove, or some\r\nother thing, of Henry Lord Ross’s; and when she asked for what, her\r\nMother answered to hurt My Lord Ross; upon which she brought down a\r\nglove, and gave it to her Mother, who stroked _Rutterkin_ her cat (the\r\nImp) with it, after it was dipped in hot water, and, so, pricked it\r\noften after; which Henry Lord Ross fell sick, and soon after Died. She\r\nfurther said that finding a glove, about two or three years since of\r\nFrancis Lord Ross’s, she gave it to her mother, who put it into hot\r\nwater, and afterwards took it out, and rubbed it on Rutterkin (the Imp,)\r\nand bid him go upwards, and afterwards buried it in the yard, and said\r\n“a mischief light on him but he will mend again.” She further confessed\r\nthat her Mother and her and her sister agreed together to bewitch the\r\nEarl and his Lady, that they might have no more children; and being\r\nasked the cause of this their malice and ill-will, she said that, about\r\nfour years since, the Countess, taking a dislike to her, gave her forty\r\nshillings, a Bolster, and a mattress, and bid her be at Home, and come\r\nno more to dwell at the Castle; which she not only took ill, but grudged\r\nit in her heart very much, swearing to be revenged upon her, on which\r\nher Mother took wool out of the Mattress, and a pair of gloves which\r\nwere given her by Mr. Vovason, and put them into warm water, mingling\r\nthem with some blood, and stirring it together; then she took them out\r\nof the water, and rubbed them on the belly of Rutterkin, saying, “the\r\nLord and the Lady would have Children but it would be long first.” She\r\nfurther confessed that, by her Mother’s command, she brought to her a\r\npiece of a handkerchief of the Lady Catherine, the Earl’s Daughter, and\r\nher Mother put it into hot water, and then, taking it out, rubbed it\r\nupon Rutterkin, bidding him “fly and go,” whereupon Rutterkin whined and\r\ncryed “Mew,” upon which the said Rutterkin had no more power of the Lady\r\nCatherine to hurt her.\r\n\r\nMargarett Flower and Phillis Flower, the Daughters of Joan Flower, were\r\nexecuted at Lincoln for Witchcraft, March 12, 1618.\r\n\r\nWhoever reads this history should consider the ignorance and dark\r\nsuperstition of those times; but certainly these women were vile\r\nabandoned wretches to pretend to do such wicked things.\r\n\r\n“_Seek not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor wizards, nor unto\r\nwitches that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their\r\nGod._” Isaiah xix.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis entry in the church book of Bottesford is certainly very curious.\r\nIts being read at this time, to the visitors of the monuments, must\r\nspread the “wonderful story” far and near among the country people, and\r\ntend to the increase of the sexton’s perquisites; but surely if that\r\nofficer be allowed to disseminate the tale, he ought to be furnished\r\nwith a few sensible strictures which he might be required to read at the\r\nsame time. In all probability, the greater number of visitants are\r\nattracted thither by the surprising narrative, and there is at least one\r\nhand from whom might be solicited such remarks as would tend to obviate\r\nundue impressions.

It generally\r\ncommences at three o’clock, and is continued till dusk. The boundaries\r\nare fixed and the parties chosen. I believe, as is usual in the sister\r\nkingdom, county-men play against other county-men. Some fine specimens\r\nof wrestling are occasionally exhibited, in order to delay the two men\r\nwho are rivals in the pursuit of the ball; meantime the parties’ friends\r\nhave time to pursue the combat, and the quick arrival of the ball to the\r\ngoal is generally the consequence, and a lusty shout is given by the\r\nvictors.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy, football was commonly played on a Sunday morning, before\r\nchurch time, in a village in the west of England, and the church-piece\r\nwas the ground chosen for it.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

The celebrated\r\ncomposer, C. M. Von Weber, opens his opera of horrors, “Der Freischütz,”\r\nwith a scene of shooting for the popingay. This is a proof that it is\r\ncommon in Germany, where the successful candidate is elected a petty\r\nsovereign for the day. The necessity and use of such a custom in a\r\ncountry formed for the chase, is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe author of the “Waverley” novels, in his excellent tale of “Old\r\nMortality,” introduces a scene of shooting for the popingay, as he terms\r\nit. It was usual for the sheriff to call out the feudal array of the\r\ncounty, annually, to what was called the _wappen-schaws_. The author\r\nsays, “The sheriff of the county of Lanark was holding the wappen-schaw\r\nof a wild district, called the Upper Ward of Clydesdale, on a traugh or\r\nlevel plain, near to a royal borough, the name of which is in no way\r\nessential to my story, upon the morning of the 5th of May, 1679, when\r\nour narrative commences. When the musters had been made, and duly\r\nreported, the young men, as was usual, were to mix in various parts, of\r\nwhich the chief was to shoot at the _popingay_, an ancient game formerly\r\npractised with archery, and then with firearms. This was the figure of a\r\nbird, decked with party-coloured feathers, so as to resemble a popingay\r\nor parrot. It was suspended to a pole, and served for a mark, at which\r\nthe competitors discharged their fusees and carbines in rotation, at the\r\ndistance of sixty or seventy paces. He whose ball brought down the mark,\r\nheld the proud title of captain of the popingay for the remainder of the\r\nday, and was usually escorted in triumph to the most reputable\r\ncharge-house in the neighbourhood, where the evening was closed with\r\nconviviality, conducted under his auspices.” From the accuracy and\r\nresearch of the author, I am inclined to take it for granted, that this\r\nsport was common in Scotland.\r\n\r\nA friend informs me it is common in Switzerland, and I have no doubt\r\nobtained pretty generally over Europe. In conclusion, allow me to remark\r\nthat in my opinion the man on horseback, with the popingay on the pole,\r\nis returning as victor from the sport; the pole in the distance\r\nevidently had the honour of supporting the popingay, until it was\r\ncarried away by the aim of the marksman.\r\n\r\n  I am, sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  T.

He will be happy to be\r\ninformed of any other misconception or inaccuracy, because it will\r\nassist him in his endeavours to render the work a faithful record of\r\nmanners and customs.

It is an advantage resulting from the volume\r\nalready before the public, that it acquaints its readers with the kind\r\nof information desired to be conveyed, more readily than the prospectus\r\nproposed to their consideration. If each reader will only contribute\r\nsomething to the instruction and amusement of the rest, the editor has\r\nno doubt that he will be able to present a larger series of interesting\r\nnotices and agreeable illustrations, than any work he is at present\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _February 6, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--I send you the account of two more games, or in-doors sports, in\r\nvogue among the country people in Cornwall. Of the latter, Mr. D.\r\nGilbert has made slight mention in the introduction to his carols,\r\nsecond edition; but he states that these games, together with\r\ncarol-singing, may be considered as obsolete, which is by no means the\r\ncase: even yet in most of the western parishes, (and of these I can\r\nspeak from personal observation,) the carol-singers, not only sing their\r\n“auntient chaunts” in the churches, but go about from house to house in\r\nparties. I am told the practice is the same in many other parts of the\r\ncounty, as it is also in various places throughout the kingdom. I have\r\nadded a slight notice respecting Piccadilly, which (if worth inserting)\r\nmay be new to some of your readers; but, now for our Cornish sports: I\r\nstate them as I found them, and they are considered provincial.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the _Tinkeler’s_ (tinker’s) shop.--In the middle of the\r\nroom is placed a large iron pot, filled with a mixture of soot and\r\nwater. One of the most humourous of the set is chosen for the master of\r\nthe shop, who takes a small mop in his left hand, and a short stick in\r\nhis right; his comrades each have a small stick in his right hand; the\r\nmaster gives each a separate name, as _Old Vulcan_, _Save-all_,\r\n_Tear’em_, _All-my-men_, _Mend-all_, &c. After these preliminaries, all\r\nkneel down, encircling the iron vessel. The master cries out, “Every one\r\n(that is, all together, or ‘one and all,’ as the Cornish say,) and I;”\r\nall then hammer away with their sticks as fast as they can, some of them\r\nwith absurd grimaces. Suddenly the master will, perhaps, cry out,\r\n“_All-my-men_ and I;” upon this, all are to cease working, except the\r\nindividual called _All-my-men;_ and if any unfortunate delinquent fails,\r\nhe is treated with a salute from the mop well dipped in the black\r\nliquid: this never fails to afford great entertainment to the\r\nspectators, and if the master is “well up to the sport,” he contrives\r\nthat none of his comrades shall escape unmarked; for he changes rapidly\r\nfrom _All-my-men_ and I, to _Old Vulcan_ and I, and so on, and sometimes\r\nnames two or three together, that little chance of escaping with a clean\r\nface is left.\r\n\r\n_The Corn-market._--Here, as before, an experienced reveller is chosen\r\nto be the master, who has an assistant, called _Spy-the-market_. Another\r\ncharacter is _Old Penglaze_, who is dressed up in some ridiculous way,\r\nwith a blackened face, and a staff in his hand; he, together with part\r\nof a horse’s hide girt round him, for the hobby-horse, are placed\r\ntowards the back of the market. The rest of the players sit round the\r\nroom, and have each some even price affixed to them as names; for\r\ninstance, _Two-pence_, _Four-pence_, _Six-pence_, _Twelve-pence_, &c.\r\nThe master then says “Spy-the-market,” to which the man responds,\r\n“Spy-the-market;” the master repeats, “Spy-the-market;” the man says,\r\n“Aye, sirrah.” The master then asks the price of corn, to which\r\nSpy-the-market, may reply any price he chooses, of those given to his\r\ncomrades, for instance, “Twelve-pence.” The master then says,\r\n“Twelve-pence,” when the man hearing that price answers “Twelve-pence,”\r\nand a similar conversation ensues, as with Spy-the-market before, and\r\nTwelve-pence names his price, and so the game proceeds; but if, as\r\nfrequently happens, any of the prices forget their names, or any other\r\nmistakes occur in the game, the offender is to be sealed, a ceremony in\r\nwhich the principal amusement of the game consists; it is done as\r\nfollows,--the master goes to the person who has forfeited, and takes up\r\nhis foot, saying, “Here is my seal, where is old Penglaze’s seal?” and\r\nthen gives him a blow on the sole of the foot. Old Penglaze then comes\r\nin on his horse, with his feet tripping on the floor, saying, “Here I\r\ncomes, neither riding nor a foot;” the horse winces and capers, so that\r\nthe old gentleman can scarcely keep his seat. When he arrives at the\r\nmarket, he cries out, “What work is there for me to do?” The master\r\nholds up the foot of the culprit and says, “Here, Penglaze, is a fine\r\nshoeing match for you.” Penglaze dismounts; “I think it’s a fine colt\r\nindeed.” He then begins to work by pulling the shoe off the unfortunate\r\n_colt_, saying “My reward is a full gallon of moonlight, besides all\r\nother customs for shoeing in this market;” he then gives one or two hard\r\nblows on the shoe-less foot, which make its proprietor tingle, and\r\nremounts his horse, whose duty it is now to get very restive, and poor\r\nPenglaze is so tossed up and down, that he has much difficulty to get to\r\nhis old place without a tumble. The play is resumed until Penglaze’s\r\nseal is again required, and at the conclusion of the whole there is a\r\nset dance.\r\n\r\nPICCADILLY.--The pickadil was the round hem, or the piece set about the\r\nedge or skirt of a garment, whether at top or bottom; also a kind of\r\nstiff collar, made in fashion of a band, that went about the neck and\r\nround about the shoulders; hence the term “wooden peccadilloes,”\r\n(meaning the pillory) in “Hudibras,” and see Nares’s “Glossary,” and\r\nBlount’s “Glossographia.” At the time that ruffs, and consequently\r\n_pickadils_, were much in fashion, there was a celebrated ordinary near\r\nSt. James’s, called _Pickadilly_, because, as some say, it was the\r\noutmost, or skirt-house, situate at the _hem_ of the town; but it more\r\nprobably took its name from one Higgins, a tailor, who made a fortune by\r\npickadils, and built this with a few adjoining houses. The name has by a\r\nfew been derived from a much frequented shop for sale of these articles;\r\nthis probably took its rise from the circumstance of Higgins having\r\nbuilt houses there, which, however, were not for selling ruffs; and\r\nindeed, with the exception of his buildings, the site of the present\r\nPiccadilly was at that time open country, and quite out of the way of\r\ntrade. At a later period, when Burlington-house was built, its noble\r\nowner chose the situation, then at some distance from the extremity of\r\nthe town, that _none might build beyond him_. The ruffs formerly worn by\r\ngentlemen were frequently double-wired, and stiffened with yellow\r\nstarch; and the practice was at one time carried to such an excess that\r\nthey were limited by queen Elizabeth “to a nayle of a yeard in depth.”\r\nIn the time of James I. they still continued of a preposterous size, so\r\nthat previous to the visit made by that monarch to Cambridge in 1615,\r\nthe vice-chancellor of the university thought fit to issue an order,\r\nprohibiting “the fearful enormity and excess of apparel seen in all\r\ndegrees, as, namely, strange peccadilloes, vast bands, huge cuffs,\r\nshoe-roses, tufts, locks, and tops of hair, unbeseeming that modesty and\r\ncarriage of students in so renowned an university.” It is scarcely to be\r\nsupposed that the ladies were deficient in the size of their ruffs; on\r\nthe contrary, according to Andrews, (Continuation of Henry’s History of\r\nEngland, vol. ii. 307,) they wore them immoderately large, made of lawn\r\nand cambric, and stiffened with yellow starch, for the art of using\r\nwhich, in the proper method, they paid as much as four or five pounds,\r\nas also twenty shillings for learning “to seethe starche,” to a Mrs.\r\nDingen Van Plesse, who introduced it, as well as the use of lawn, which\r\nwas so fine that it was a byword, “that shortly they would wear ruffes\r\nof a spider’s web.” The poking of these ruffs gracefully was an\r\nimportant attainment. Some satirical Puritans enjoyed the effects of a\r\nshower of rain on the ruff-wearers; for “then theyre great ruffes stryke\r\nsayle, and downe they falle, as dish-clouts fluttering in the winde.”\r\nMrs. Turner, who was one of the persons implicated in the death of sir\r\nThomas Overbury, is said to have gone to the place of execution in a\r\nfashionable ruff, after which their credit was very much diminished.\r\n\r\n  I am, sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  W. S.\r\n\r\nP.

For the first time, he believes, he\r\nventures to allude to any inconvenience he has felt while conducting it;\r\nnor does he hint at difficulty now from lack of materials, for he has\r\nabundance; but it is a truth, which he is persuaded many of his readers\r\nwill be happy to mitigate, that at the present moment he is himself so\r\nvery unwell, and has so much indisposition in his family to distract his\r\nmind, that he cannot arrange his collections; services, therefore,\r\nunder such circumstances, will be peculiarly acceptable. If one or two\r\nof his correspondents should refer him to communications which their\r\nkindness have already placed in his hands, he answers, that he is really\r\ntoo ill to seek them amongst his papers. From this it will be seen how\r\nvery much he really needs, and how much he covets, assistance. He\r\nventures to think that he shall not have made this public appeal in\r\nvain, and he again calls on the friends and readers of his labours to\r\nsend him their aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·51.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 17.~\r\n\r\n_1826, Cambridge Term ends._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~St. Patrick’s Day--a Pattern.~]\r\n\r\n    “An Irishman all in his glory was there,\r\n    With a sprig of shillelagh and shamrock so green.”\r\n\r\nIt happens that several _fairs_, similar to those in the country parts\r\nof England as to tents and booths, are held in Ireland on Saint\r\nPatrick’s day, and then its hilarity is heightened by the publicity of\r\nthe celebration.\r\n\r\nThe usual fair day or “_patron_,” or, as it is usually pronounced,\r\n_pattern_ or _patten_, is a festive meeting to commemorate the virtues\r\nof a patron saint. It is a kind of rural fete with drinking and dancing,\r\nwhereto (in Ireland) is added fighting, “unless the neighbouring\r\nmagistrates personally interfere, or the spirits of the people are\r\nrepressed by a conscious participation in plots and conspiracies.” This\r\nis the character of these festivals by an Irish writer, who relates an\r\nanecdote resulting from one of these festivals: “We were waiting (he\r\nsays,) in the vain hope that the weather would clear up, and allow us a\r\nfine evening for return, when a poor stranger from Joyce country came\r\nbefore ‘his honour’ as a magistrate. His black eye, swelled face, and\r\nhead and shoulders covered with clotted blood, too plainly told the\r\nhistory of his sufferings; and his woeful countenance formed a strange\r\nand ludicrous contrast with his account of the pleasures of the\r\npreceding evening.” He had obtained these features at a _patron_. “The\r\npoor fellow had travelled many a weary mile across the mountains to\r\nshare its rustic mirth and revelry: but, ‘plaze your honour, there was a\r\nlittle bit of fighting in it,’ and as no true follower of St. Macdarragh\r\ncould refuse to take a part in such a peaceful contest, he had received,\r\nand no doubt given, many a friendly blow; but his meditations on a\r\nbroken head during the night, had both cooled his courage and revived\r\nhis prudence, and he came to swear before ‘his honour’ a charge of\r\nassault and battery against those who had thus woefully demolished his\r\nupper works.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe constant use of the “shillelagh” by Irishmen at a “patron,” is a\r\npuzzling fact to Englishmen, who, on their own holidays, regard a\r\n“shillelagh” as a malicious weapon. In the hand of an Irishman, in his\r\nown country, at such a season, it is divested of that character; this\r\nsingular fact will be accounted for, when the origin of the custom comes\r\nto be considered. At present, nothing more is requisite than to add,\r\nthat the “shillelagh” is seldom absent on St. Patrick’s day, celebrated\r\nas a _patron_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome account of the commemoration of this festival, and of the tutelar\r\nsaint of Ireland and his miracles, is already given in vol. i. p. 363.\r\nTo this may be added the annexed notices relative to the day, obtained\r\nfrom an Irish gentleman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a tradition that St. Patrick first landed at _Croagh Patrick_, a\r\nhigh and beautiful mountain in the county of Mayo, from which place he\r\nbanished all venomous animals into the sea, and to this day, multitudes\r\nof the natives who are catholics, make pilgrimages to Croagh Patrick,\r\nunder the persuasion of efficacy in these journies to atone for\r\nmisdeeds, or mitigate the penalties attached to sin.\r\n\r\nIt is a very popular tradition that when St. Patrick was dying, he\r\nrequested his weeping and lamenting friends to forego their grief, and\r\nrather rejoice at his comfortable exit, for the better furtherance of\r\nwhich, he advised each one to take “a drop of something to drink;” and\r\nthat this last injunction of the saint in reverence to his character was\r\ncomplied with. However this may be, it is a custom on his anniversary to\r\nobserve the practice to supererogation; for the greater number of his\r\npresent followers, who take a little “crathur” for the purpose of\r\ndissipating woeful reminiscencies, continue to imbibe it till they “lisp\r\nand wink.”\r\n\r\nSome years ago, “Patrick’s day” was welcomed, in the smaller country\r\ntowns or hamlets, by every possible manifestation of gladness and\r\ndelight. The inn, if there was one, was thrown open to all comers, who\r\nreceived a certain allowance of oaten bread and fish. This was a\r\nbenevolence from the host, and to it was added a “Patrick’s pot,” or\r\nquantum of beer; but, of late years, whiskey is the beverage most\r\nesteemed. The majority of those who sought entertainment at the village\r\ninn, were young men who had no families, whilst those who had children,\r\nand especially whose families were large, made themselves as snug as\r\npossible by the turf fire in their own cabins.\r\n\r\nWhere the village or hamlet could not boast of an inn, the largest cabin\r\nwas sought out, and poles were extended horizontally from one end of the\r\napartment to the other; on these poles, doors purposely unhinged, and\r\nbrought from the surrounding cabins were placed, so that a table of\r\nconsiderable dimensions was formed, round which all seated themselves,\r\neach one providing his own oaten bread and fish. At the conclusion of\r\nthe repast, they sat for the remainder of the evening over a “Patrick’s\r\npot,” and finally separated quietly, and it is to be hoped in perfect\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Dublin, “Patrick’s day” is still regarded as a festival\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest ranks of society. There is an annual ball\r\nand supper at the lord lieutenant’s residence in the castle, and there\r\nare private convivial assemblies of the most joyous character. On this\r\nday every Irishman who is alive to its importance, adorns his hat with\r\nbunches of shamrock, which is the common trefoil or clover, wherewith,\r\naccording to tradition, St. Patrick converted the Irish nation to belief\r\nin the doctrine of the trinity in unity. In the humbler ranks, it is the\r\nuniversal practice to get a morning dram as a preparation for the\r\nduties of the festival. They then attend chapel and hear high mass.\r\nAfter the ceremonies and observances peculiar to the Romish worship,\r\nthey again resort to the whiskey shop, and spend the remainder of the\r\nday in devotions to Bacchus, which are mostly concluded, with what in\r\nEngland would be called, by persons of this class, “a row.”\r\n\r\nOn Patrick’s day, while the bells of churches and chapels are tuned to\r\njoyous notes, the piper and harper play up “Patrick’s day in the\r\nmorning;” old women, with plenteous supplies of trefoil, are heard in\r\nevery direction, crying “Buy my shamrocks, green shamrocks,” and\r\nchildren have “Patrick’s crosses” pinned to their sleeves. These are\r\nsmall prints of various kinds; some of them merely represent a cross,\r\nothers are representations of Saint Patrick, trampling the reptiles\r\nunder his feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appears from this account, and from general narrations, that St.\r\nPatrick is honoured on his festival by every mode which mirth can devise\r\nfor praise of his memory. The following whimsical song is a particular\r\nfavourite, and sung to “his holiness” by all ranks in the height of\r\nconvivial excitement:--\r\n\r\n_St. Patrick was a Gentleman._\r\n\r\n    St. Patrick was a gentleman, and he came from decent people:\r\n    In Dublin town he built a church and on it put a steeple;\r\n    His father was a Wollaghan, his mother an O’Grady,\r\n    His aunt she was a Kinaghan, and his wife a widow Brady.\r\n        Tooralloo tooralloo, what a glorious man our saint was,\r\n        Tooralloo, tooralloo, O whack fal de lal, de lal, &c.\r\n\r\n    Och! Antrim hills are mighty high and so’s the hill of Howth too;\r\n    But we all do know a mountain that is higher than them both too;\r\n    ’Twas on the top of that high mount St. Patrick preach’d a sermon,\r\n    He drove the frogs into the bogs, and banished all the vermin.\r\n        Tooralloo, &c.\r\n\r\n    No wonder that we Irish lads, then, are so blythe and frisky;\r\n    St. Patrick was the very man that taught us to drink whiskey;\r\n    Och! to be sure, he had the knack and understood distilling,\r\n    For his mother kept a sheebeen shop, near the town of Enniskillen.\r\n        Tooralloo, &c.\r\n\r\nThe day after St. Patrick’s day is “Sheelah’s day,” or the festival in\r\nhonour of Sheelah. Its observers are not so anxious to determine who\r\n“Sheelah” was, as they are earnest in her celebration. Some say she was\r\n“Patrick’s wife,” others that she was “Patrick’s mother,” while all\r\nagree that her “immortal memory” is to be maintained by potations of\r\nwhiskey. The shamrock worn on St. Patrick’s day should be worn also on\r\nSheelah’s day, and, on the latter night, be drowned in the last glass.\r\nYet it frequently happens that the shamrock is flooded in the last glass\r\nof St. Patrick’s day, and another last glass or two, or more, on the\r\nsame night, deluges the over-soddened trefoil. This is not “quite\r\ncorrect,” but it is endeavoured to be remedied the next morning by the\r\ndisplay of a fresh shamrock, which is steeped at night in honour of\r\n“Sheelah” with equal devotedness.\r\n\r\nThat Saint Patrick was not married is clear from the rules of the Roman\r\ncatholic church, which impose celibacy on its clergy. A correspondent\r\nsuggests that the idea of his matrimonial connection, arose out of a\r\nburlesque, or, perhaps, ironical remark, by females of the poorer class\r\nin Ireland, to retaliate on their husbands for their excesses on the\r\n17th of March; or, perhaps, from the opportunity the effects of such\r\nindulgence afforded them, these fair helpmates are as convivial on the\r\nfollowing morning, as their “worser halves” were the preceding day.\r\n“Sheelah” is an Irish term, generally applied to a slovenly or muddling\r\nwoman, more particularly if she be elderly. In this way, probably, the\r\nday after St. Patrick’s obtained the name of “Sheelah’s day,” _speciale\r\ngratia_, without any reference to the calendar of saints. The saint\r\nhimself, if we determine from the sacrifices to his memory, is deemed a\r\nkind of christian Bacchus; and, on like home-made authority, “Sheelah”\r\nis regarded as his consort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor of this work especially regrets that few of the peculiarities\r\nregarding this festival which are familiar to Irishmen have been\r\ncommunicated to him. He has received letters expressing surprise that so\r\nlittle has been observed concerning their country. Such complaints have\r\nbeen made under initials, and therefore he could not answer them: the\r\ncomplainants he has no doubt could have contributed largely themselves,\r\nand from them he would have required information. As many Irish usages\r\nare fast dying away, he hopes and earnestly solicits to be favoured with\r\nparticulars, which he is persuaded the collections or recollections of\r\nhis Irish readers can readily furnish, and which he will be most happy\r\nin having intrusted to him for publication. Any illustrations of Irish\r\ncharacter and manners, especially if drawn up by natives of Ireland,\r\nwill be highly valued.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn St. Patrick’s day, 1740, the butchers in Clare-market, London, hung\r\nup a grotesque figure of an Irishman. A great number of Irishmen came to\r\npull it down, when a fierce battle ensued, much mischief was done, and\r\nseveral persons were dangerously wounded; but a file of musqueteers\r\nhaving been fetched from St. James’s, some of the rioters were taken\r\ninto custody, and three of them were committed by col. De Veil to\r\nNewgate.[83]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA correspondent who signs, “IKEY PINGLE,” communicates a copy of a\r\nsingular monumental inscription in the churchyard of Grimmingham, in\r\nNorfolk.

To accounts of remarkable\r\nceremonies peculiar to the day, and its present observance, it is proper\r\nto add the mode wherein it is celebrated by the papal pontiff at Rome.\r\nAn eye-witness to the pageant relates as follows:--\r\n\r\nAbout half-past nine in the morning, the pope entered the Sistine\r\nchapel, attired in a robe of scarlet and gold, which he wore over his\r\nordinary dress, and took his throne. The cardinals, who were at first\r\ndressed in under-robes of a violet colour (the mourning for cardinals),\r\nwith their rich antique lace, scarlet trains, and mantles of ermine,\r\nsuddenly put off these accoutrements, and arrayed themselves in most\r\nsplendid vestments, which had the appearance of being made of carved\r\ngold. The tedious ceremony of each separately kissing the pope’s hand,\r\nand making their three little bows, being gone through, and some little\r\nchaunting and fidgetting about the altar being got over, two palm\r\nbranches, of seven or eight feet in length, were brought to the pope,\r\nwho, after raising over them a cloud of incense, bestowed his\r\nbenediction upon them: then a great number of smaller palms were\r\nbrought, and a cardinal, who acted as the pope’s aid-de-camp on this\r\noccasion, presented one of these to every cardinal as he ascended the\r\nsteps of the throne, who again kissed the pope’s hand and the palm, and\r\nretired. Then came the archbishops, who kissed both the pope’s hand and\r\ntoe, followed by the inferior orders of clergy, in regular gradations,\r\nwho only kissed the toe, as they carried off their palms.\r\n\r\nThe higher dignitaries being at last provided with palms, the deacons,\r\ncanons, choristers, cardinals, train-bearers, &c. had each to receive\r\nbranches of olive, to which, as well as to the palms, a small cross was\r\nsuspended. At last, all were ready to act their parts, and the\r\nprocession began to move: it began with the lowest in clerical rank, who\r\nmoved off two by two, rising gradually in dignity, till they came to\r\nprelates, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals, and terminated by the\r\npope, borne in his chair of state (_sedia gestatoria_) on men’s\r\nshoulders, with a crimson canopy over his head. By far the most striking\r\nfigures in the procession were the bishops and patriarchs of the\r\nArmenian church. One of them wore a white crown, and another a crimson\r\ncrown glittering with jewels. The mitres of the bishops were also set\r\nwith precious stones; and their splendid dresses, and long wavy beards\r\nof silver whiteness, gave them a most venerable and imposing appearance.\r\n\r\nThe procession issued forth into the Sala Borgia (the hall behind the\r\nSistine chapel), and marched round it, forming nearly a circle; for by\r\nthe time the pope had gone out, the leaders of the procession had nearly\r\ncome back again; but they found the gates of the chapel closed against\r\nthem, and, on admittance being demanded, a voice was heard from within,\r\nin deep recitative, seemingly inquiring into their business, or claims\r\nfor entrance there. This was answered by the choristers from the\r\nprocession in the hall; and after a chaunted parley of a few minutes,\r\nthe gates were again opened, and the pope, cardinals, and priests,\r\nreturned to their seats. Then the passion was chaunted; and then a most\r\ntiresome long service commenced, in which the usual genuflections, and\r\ntinkling of little bells, and dressings and undressings, and walking up\r\nand coming down the steps of the altar, and bustling about, went on; and\r\nwhich at last terminated in the cardinals all embracing and kissing each\r\nother, which is considered the kiss of peace.\r\n\r\nThe palms are artificial, plaited of straw, or the leaves of dried\r\nreeds, so as to resemble the real branches of the palm-tree when their\r\nleaves are plaited, which are used in this manner for this ceremony in\r\nthe catholic colonies of tropical climates. These artificial palms,\r\nhowever, are topped with some of the real leaves of the palm-tree,\r\nbrought from the shores of the gulf of Genoa.[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Palm Sunday in Spain._\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of the celebration of this day in the\r\ncathedral of Seville:--\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, the melancholy sound of the _passion-bell_\r\nannounces the beginning of the solemnities for which the fast of Lent is\r\na preparation. This bell, the largest of several which are made to\r\nrevolve upon pivots, is moved by means of two long ropes, which by\r\nswinging the bell into a circular motion, are twined, gently at first,\r\nround the massive arms of a cross, of which the bell forms the foot, and\r\nthe head its counterpoise. Six men then draw back the ropes, till the\r\nenormous machine receives a sufficient impetus to coil them in an\r\nopposite direction; and thus alternately, as long as ringing is\r\nrequired. To give this bell a tone appropriate to the sombre character\r\nof the season, it has been cast with several large holes disposed in a\r\ncircle round the top--a contrivance which without diminishing the\r\nvibration of the metal, prevents the distinct formation of any musical\r\nnote, and converts the sound into a dismal clangour.\r\n\r\nThe chapter, consisting of about eighty resident members, in choral\r\nrobes of black silk with long trains and hoods, preceded by the inferior\r\nministers, by thirty clergymen, in surplices, whose deep bass voices\r\nperform the plain or Ambrosian chaunt, and by the band of\r\nwind-instruments and singers, who execute the more artificial strains of\r\nmodern or counterpoint music, move in a long procession round the\r\nfarthest aisles, each holding a branch of the oriental, or date palm,\r\nwhich overtopping the heads of the assembled multitude, nod gracefully,\r\nand bend into elegant curves at every step of the bearers. For this\r\npurpose a number of palm-trees are kept with their branches tied up\r\ntogether, that, by the want of light, the more tender shoots may\r\npreserve a delicate yellow tinge. The ceremony of blessing these\r\nbranches is solemnly performed by the officiating priest, previously to\r\nthe procession, after which they are sent by the clergy to their\r\nfriends, who tie them to the iron bars of the balconies, to be, as they\r\nbelieve, a protection against lightning.\r\n\r\nIn the long church-service for this day, the organ is silent, the voices\r\nbeing supported by hautboys and bassoons. All the altars are covered\r\nwith purple or grey curtains. The holy vestments, during this week, are\r\nof the first-mentioned colour, except on Friday, when it is changed for\r\nblack. The four accounts of our saviour’s passion, appointed as gospels\r\nfor this day, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, are dramatized in the\r\nfollowing manner:--Outside of the gilt-iron railing which encloses the\r\npresbytery, are two large pulpits of the same materials, from one of\r\nwhich, at the daily high mass, the sub-deacon chaunts the epistle, as\r\nthe deacon does the gospel from the other. A movable platform with a\r\ndesk, is placed between the pulpits on the _passion-days;_ and three\r\npriests or deacons, in _albes_--the white vestment, over which the\r\ndalmatic is worn by the latter, and the _casulla_ by the former--appear\r\non these elevated posts, at the time when the gospel should be said.\r\nThese officiating ministers are chosen among the singers in holy orders,\r\none a bass, another a tenor, and the third a counter-tenor. The tenor\r\nchaunts the narrative without changing from the keynote, and makes a\r\npause whenever he comes to the words of the interlocutors mentioned by\r\nthe evangelist. In those passages the words of our saviour are sung by\r\nthe bass in a solemn strain. The counter-tenor, in a more florid style,\r\npersonates the inferior characters, such as Peter, the maid, and Pontius\r\nPilate. The cries of the priests and the multitude are represented by\r\nthe band of musicians within the choir.[85]\r\n\r\n\r\nPALM SUNDAY CUSTOM\r\n\r\n_in Lincolnshire_.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is from a correspondent on the spot where the\r\ncustom is still preserved.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--There is a singular ceremony at Caistor church, Lincolnshire,\r\nevery Palm Sunday, which you may think worth describing from this\r\naccount of it.\r\n\r\nA deputy from Broughton brings a very large ox-whip, called here a\r\ngad-whip. _Gad_ is an old Lincolnshire measure of ten feet; the stock of\r\nthe gad-whip is, perhaps, of the same length. The whip itself is\r\nconstructed as follows. A large piece of ash, or any other wood, tapered\r\ntowards the top, forms the stock; it is wrapt with white leather half\r\nway down, and some small pieces of mountain ash are enclosed. The thong\r\nis very large, and made of strong white leather. The man comes to the\r\nnorth porch, about the commencement of the first lesson, and cracks his\r\nwhip in front of the porch door three times; he then, with much\r\nceremony, wraps the thong round the stock of the whip, puts some rods of\r\nmountain ash lengthwise upon it, and binds the whole together with\r\nwhip-cord. He next ties to the top of the whip-stock a purse containing\r\ntwo shillings, (formerly this sum was in twenty-four silver pennies,)\r\nthen taking the whole upon his shoulder, he marches into the church,\r\nwhere he stands in front of the reading desk till the commencement of\r\nthe second lesson: he then goes up nearer, waves the purse over the head\r\nof the clergyman, kneels down on a cushion, and continues in that\r\nposition, with the purse suspended over the clergyman’s head, till the\r\nlesson is ended. After the service is concluded, he carries the whip,\r\n&c. to the manor-house of Undon, a hamlet adjoining, where he leaves it.\r\nThere is a new whip made every year; it is made at Broughton, and left\r\nat Undon.\r\n\r\nCertain lands in the parish of Broughton are held by the tenure of this\r\nannual custom, which is maintained to the present time.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  G.

They survived their confinement, and\r\nthe facts relating to it were published by Ignazio Somis, professor in\r\nthe university of Turin. With the case of these poor creatures, that,\r\nrelated at p. 176, of our Elizabeth Woodcock, who remained so imprisoned\r\neight days, is scarcely to be compared.

On his return home, the farmer’s servants, who\r\nregularly messed at the same table, and seldom honoured him with the\r\nname of master, inquired “Weel, Sandy, hae ye sell’t the lambs?” “Atweel\r\nhae I, and I gat saxpence mair a-head for them than ony body in the\r\nmarket.” “And a’ weel paid siller?” “Na, the siller’s no paid yet, but\r\nits sure eneuch.” “Wha’s your merchant, and, and what’s your security?”\r\n“Troth I never spiered, but he’s a decent lookin’ man wi tap boots, and\r\na bottle-green coat.” The servants, at this, laughed outright, and\r\ntauntingly told him he would never get a farthing. Sandy, however,\r\nthought differently, and having accidentally hurt his leg so as to\r\nprevent him from travelling, he sent a shepherd to Langholm, with\r\ninstructions to look for a man with a bottle-green coat, whom he was\r\nsure he said, to find standing near a certain sign. The shepherd did as\r\nhe was bid, and, strange to say, discovered a person standing at the\r\nidentical spot, who, on learning his errand, inquired kindly for his\r\nmaster, and paid the money to the uttermost farthing. Sandy, who piqued\r\nhimself on his skill in physiognomy, heard the news without emotion, and\r\nmerely said, “I wad at any time trust mair to looks than words, and whan\r\nI saw Colly smeiling about hun sae kindly, I ken’t weel eneuch he\r\ncouldna be a scoundrel.” This result differs from one which might have\r\nbeen expected.

One of the company, a great snuff-taker, and good\r\nmathematician, proposed the following, (as he thought,) puzzling\r\nquestion;\r\n\r\n“If I take so many (a given quantity) of pinches of snuff every quarter\r\nof an hour, how many pinches shall I have taken in fifteen years?”\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman in little more than a minute gave his answer.\r\n\r\nThe snuff-taker called for pen, ink, and paper, to examine the answer,\r\nwhen after a considerable time he declared it erroneous; upon hearing\r\nwhich, the calculator asked the snuff-taker if he had allowed for the\r\nleap-years? being answered in the negative, the snuff-taker was\r\nrequested to add them, when the calculator’s answer was found to be\r\ncorrect to a single pinch, to the no small astonishment and delight of\r\nthe assembled party.\r\n\r\n  A. S.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding anecdote is wholly new, and, after a “pinch of snuff,” the\r\neditor introduces a topic somewhat corresponding.\r\n\r\n\r\n“TOBACCO.”\r\n\r\n“EX FUMO dare lucem.”\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco, “that stinking weed so much abused to God’s\r\ndishonour,” as Stow expresses himself, having become so common, as to be\r\nalmost “naturalized on English ground;” perhaps a short article on the\r\nsubject at this seasonable period, may not be unacceptable to the\r\nnumerous readers of the _Every-Day Book_. Let me however be understood\r\nin the outset.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to write a historical--nor yet critical--nor yet a\r\npoetical essay on my subject--no! I merely wish to “cull a few _leaves_”\r\nfrom the “fragrant herb,” and leave them for you to _burn_, or your\r\nreaders to _cut up_, or _smoke_, at their good pleasure. Dropping all\r\nmetaphor, the subject is worth attention, and treated with judgment,\r\nmight be rendered highly interesting. Resigning all pretension however\r\nto that quality, I have merely collected a few “passages,” which, I\r\nhope, will be considered worthy of a place in your interesting\r\nmiscellany.\r\n\r\n“Commencing our commencement,” says the old French proverb, my medical\r\ndictionary, (Hooper’s) has the following under this head:--\r\n\r\n“Tobacco. See Nicotiana.”\r\n\r\n“Nicotiana. (From M. Nicot, who first brought it into Europe.) Tobacco.”\r\n\r\n“1st. The name of a genus of plants in the Linnean system. Class\r\n_Pentandria_; order, _Monogynia_.”\r\n\r\n“2nd. The former pharmacopæial name of the officinal tobacco,” &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  _Hooper’s Medical Dictionary_,\r\n  4th edit. p. 594.\r\n\r\nIn that elegant work, “Flora Domestica,” the botanical summary says,\r\n“This genus is named from Jean Nicot of Nismes, agent from the king of\r\nFrance to Portugal, who procured the seeds from a Dutchman, and sent\r\nthem to France. Tobacco, from the island Tobago. The French have many\r\nnames for it; as, le tabac: Nicotiane from its first introducer; petum\r\n[the original Indian appellation;] herbe du grand prieur; herbe à la\r\nReine; herbe sacrìe; herbe propre à tous maux; herbe de St. Croix; &c.\r\n&c. _Italian_, tabacco; terna bona.”\r\n\r\n  _Flora Domestica_, 1823. p. 365.\r\n\r\nOf these names, the Italian one of “terna bona,” is very singular, and\r\nas _arbitrary_ as need be, for example, what connection can there be\r\nbetween tobacco, and the “grand prior,” the “queen’s,” or the “holy\r\ncross?” “Propre à tous maux,” is _rather_ too comprehensive an\r\nappellation; I have copied but few of these names, many as there may\r\nappear to be.\r\n\r\nOf all the subjects which have employed the pens of writers, perhaps no\r\none has called forth so great a diversity of opinion as this; and we may\r\nperhaps go further, and say, that no other (save only, _love_ and _war_)\r\nhas attracted so much notice since its introduction. Popes, poets,\r\nhistorians, kings, and physicians, have dwelt upon its use and abuse,\r\nand even historians have condescended to mention it. But to proceed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its first introduction into England, Hume says, “chap.\r\nxli. Eliz. 1558, 1603,” at the close of the narration of Drake’s attack\r\non the Spanish provinces in the West Indies. “It is thought that Drake’s\r\nfleet first introduced the use of tobacco into England.”\r\n\r\nIn an after part of his work “Appendix, James I. 1603-1625,” he adds,\r\n\r\n“After supplying themselves with provisions more immediately necessary\r\nfor the support of life, the new planters began the cultivating of\r\ntobacco; and James notwithstanding his antipathy to that drug, which he\r\naffirmed to be pernicious to men’s morals as well as health, gave them\r\npermission to enter it in England; and he inhibited by proclamation all\r\nimportation of it from Spain.”\r\n\r\nAt this period originated the story of the wetting poor sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, received from the hands (and bucket) of his servant; this,\r\nhowever, is too common to deserve transferring to your pages. The\r\nfollowing facts, however, are not so generally known. “On the first\r\nintroduction of tobacco, our ancestors carried its use to an enormous\r\nexcess, smoking even in the churches, which made pope Urban VIII. in\r\n1624, publish a decree of excommunication against those who used such an\r\nunseemly practice; and Innocent XII. A. D. 1690, solemnly excommunicated\r\nall those who should take snuff or tobacco, in St. Peter’s church at\r\nRome.” _Flora Domestica_, p. 367.\r\n\r\nThis excess is perhaps only equalled by the case of William Breedon,\r\nvicar of Thornton, Bucks, “a profound divine, but absolutely the most\r\npolite person for nativities in that age;” of whom William Lilly,\r\n“student in astrology,” says, “when he had no tobacco, (and I suppose\r\ntoo much drink,) he would cut the bell ropes and smoke them.”--_History\r\nof Lilly’s Life and Times_, p. 44.[86]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the eulogist of tobacco, who, on column 195 of your present volume,\r\ndefies “all daintie meats,” and\r\n\r\n    ----“keeps his kitchen in a box,\r\n    And roast meat in a pipe,”\r\n\r\ntake as an antidote the following from Peter Hausted’s Raphael Thorius:\r\nLondon, 1551.\r\n\r\n    Let it be damn’d to Hell, and call’d from thence,\r\n    Proserpine’s wine, the Furies’ frankincense,\r\n    The Devil’s addle eggs.\r\n\r\nHawkins Brown, esq., parodying Ambrose Philips, writes thus prettily to\r\nhis pipe:--\r\n\r\n    Little tube of mighty power,\r\n    Charmer of an idle hour,\r\n    Object of my warm desire;\r\n    Lip of wax, and eye of fire;\r\n    And thy snowy taper waist,\r\n    With my finger gently brac’d; &c.\r\n\r\nIn our own times the following have appeared.\r\n\r\n“La Pipe de Tabac,” a French song to music, by Geweaux, contains the\r\nfollowing humorous stanzas:--\r\n\r\n    “Le soldat baille sous la tente,\r\n      Le matelot sur le tillac,\r\n    Bientôt ils ont l’âme contente,\r\n      Avec la pipe de tabac;\r\n    Si pourtant survient une belle,\r\n      A l’instant le cœur fait tìc tac,\r\n    Et l’Amant oublie auprès d’elle,\r\n      Jusqu’à la pipe de tabac.\r\n\r\n    “Je tiens cette maxime utile,\r\n      De ce fameux Monsieur de Crac,\r\n    En campagne comme à la ville,\r\n      Font tous l’amour et le tabac,\r\n    Quand ce grand homme allait en guerre\r\n      Il portait dans son petit sac,\r\n    Le doux portrait de sa bergère,\r\n      Avec la pipe de tabac.”\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying English version, they are thus imitated:--\r\n\r\n    See, content, the soldier smiling\r\n      Round the vet’ran smoking crew\r\n    And the tar, the time beguiling,\r\n      Sighs and whiffs, and thinks of Sue.\r\n    Calm the bosom; naught distresses;--\r\n      Labour’s harvest’s nearly ripe;--\r\n    ‘Susan’s health;’--the brim he presses,--\r\n      Here alone he quits his pipe.\r\n\r\n    Faithful still to every duty\r\n      Ne’er his faithful heart will roam;\r\n    Mines of wealth, and worlds of beauty,\r\n      Tempt him not from Susan’s home.\r\n    From his breast--wherever steering,\r\n      Oft a sudden tear to wipe,\r\n    Susan’s portrait,--sorrow cheering,\r\n      First he draws--and then his pipe!\r\n\r\nOur immortal Byron, in his poem of “The Island,” sings thus the praises\r\nof “the Indian weed:”--\r\n\r\n    Sublime tobacco!--which from east to west\r\n    Cheers the tar’s labours, or the Turkman’s rest;\r\n    Which on the Moslem’s ottoman divides\r\n    His hours,--and rivals opium and his brides;\r\n    Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,\r\n    Though not less loved, in Wapping or the Strand;\r\n    Divine in hookas, glorious in a pipe\r\n    When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe;\r\n    Like other charmers, wooing the caress\r\n    More dazzlingly when daring in full dress;\r\n    Yet thy true lovers more admire by far,\r\n    Thy naked beauties---- Give me a cigar!\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, you should deem this communication worthy of your notice, I\r\nshall feel inclined to pursue my researches farther; and, whatever the\r\nresult, allow me in the mean time to subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n  Your well-wisher,\r\n\r\n  FUMO.\r\n\r\nP.

At\r\nSeville a white veil conceals the officiating priest and ministers,\r\nduring mass, until the words in the service “the veil of the temple was\r\nrent in twain” are chaunted. At this moment the veil disappears, as if\r\nby enchantment, and the ears of the congregation are stunned with the\r\nnoise of concealed fireworks, which are meant to imitate an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe evening service, named _Tinieblas_, (darkness) is performed this day\r\nafter sunset. The cathedral, on this occasion, exhibits the most solemn\r\nand impressive aspect. The high altar, concealed behind dark grey\r\ncurtains which fall from the height of the cornices, is dimly lighted by\r\nsix yellow wax candles, while the gloom of the whole temple is broken in\r\nlarge masses by wax torches, fixed one on each pillar of the centre\r\naisle, about one-third of its length from the ground. An elegant\r\ncandlestick of brass, from fifteen to twenty feet high, is placed, on\r\nthis and the following evening, between the choir and the altar, holding\r\nthirteen candles, twelve of yellow, and one of bleached wax, distributed\r\non the two sides of the triangle which terminates the machine. Each\r\ncandle stands by a brass figure of one of the apostles. The white candle\r\noccupying the apex is allotted to the virgin Mary. At the conclusion of\r\neach of the twelve psalms appointed for the service, one of the yellow\r\ncandles is extinguished, till, the white taper burning alone, it is\r\ntaken down and concealed behind the altar. Immediately after the\r\nceremony, the _Miserere_, (Psalm 50.) set, every other year, to a new\r\nstrain of music, is sung in a grand style. This performance lasts\r\nexactly an hour. At the conclusion of the last verse the clergy break up\r\nabruptly without the usual blessing, making a thundering noise by\r\nclapping their movable seats against the frame of the stalls, or\r\nknocking their ponderous breviaries against the boards, as the rubric\r\ndirects.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of March, 1687, Jean Baptiste Lully, the eminent musical\r\ncomposer, died at Paris. He was born of obscure parents at Florence, in\r\n1634, and evincing a taste for music, a benevolent cordelier, influenced\r\nby no other consideration than the hope of his becoming eminent in the\r\nscience, undertook to teach him the guitar. While under his tuition, a\r\nFrench gentleman, the chevalier Guise, arrived at Florence, commissioned\r\nby Mlle. de Montpensier, niece to Louis XIV., to bring her some pretty\r\nlittle Italian boy as a page. The countenance of Lully did not answer to\r\nthe instructions, but his vivacity, wit, and skill on an instrument, as\r\nmuch the favourite of the French as of the Italians, determined the\r\nchevalier to send him to Paris. On his arrival, he was presented to the\r\nlady; but his figure obtained for him so cool a reception, that she\r\ncommanded him to be entered in her household books as an under-scullion.\r\nLully was at this time ten years old. In the moments of his leisure from\r\nthe kitchen, he used to scrape upon a wretched fiddle. He was overheard\r\nby a person about the court, who informed the princess he had an\r\nexcellent taste for music, and a master was employed to teach him the\r\nviolin, under whom in the course of a few months, he became so great a\r\nproficient, that he was elevated to the rank of court-musician. In\r\nconsequence of an unlucky accident he was dismissed from this situation;\r\nbut, obtaining admission into the king’s band of violins, he applied\r\nhimself so closely to study, that in a little time he began to compose.\r\nHis airs were noticed by the king, Lully was sent for, and his\r\nperformance of them was thought so excellent, that a new band was\r\nformed, called _les petits violons_, and under his direction it\r\nsurpassed the band of twenty-four, till that time celebrated throughout\r\nEurope. This was about the year 1660, when the favourite entertainments\r\nat the French court were dramatic representations, consisting of dancing\r\nintermixed with singing and speaking in recitative; they were called\r\n_ballets_, and to many of them Lully was employed in composing the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nIn 1669, an opera in the French language, on the model of that at\r\nVenice, being established at Paris, Lully obtained the situation of\r\ncomposer and joint director, left his former band, instituted one of his\r\nown, and formed the design of building a new theatre near the Luxemburg\r\npalace, which he accomplished, and opened in November, 1670.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, Lully, having been appointed surperintendent to the\r\nking’s private music, had neglected the practice of the violin; yet,\r\nwhenever he could be prevailed with to play, his excellence astonished\r\nall who heard him.\r\n\r\nIn 1686, the king recovering from an indisposition that threatened his\r\nlife, Lully composed a “_Te Deum_,” which was not more remarkable for\r\nits excellence, than the unhappy accident with which its performance was\r\nattended. In the preparations for the execution of it, and the more to\r\ndemonstrate his zeal, he himself beat the time. With the cane that he\r\nused for this purpose, he struck his foot, which caused so much\r\ninflammation, that his physician advised him to have his little toe\r\ntaken off; and, after a delay of some days, his foot; and at length the\r\nwhole limb. At this juncture, an empiric offered to perform a cure\r\nwithout amputation. Two thousand pistoles were promised him if he should\r\naccomplish it, but his efforts were vain; and Lully died.\r\n\r\nLully’s confessor in his last illness required as a testimony of his\r\nsincere repentance, and as the condition of his absolution, that he\r\nshould throw the last of his operas into the fire. After some excuses,\r\nLully acquiesced, and pointing to a drawer in which the rough draft of\r\n“_Achilles and Polixenes_” was deposited, it was taken out and burnt,\r\nand the confessor went away satisfied. Lully grew better and was thought\r\nout of danger, when one of the young princes came to visit him: “What,\r\nBaptiste,” says he to him, “have you thrown your opera into the fire?\r\nYou were a fool for thus giving credit to a gloomy Jansenist, and\r\nburning good music.” “Hush! hush! my lord,” answered Lully, in a\r\nwhisper, “I knew very well what I was about, I have another copy of it!”\r\nThis pleasantry was followed by a relapse; and the prospect of\r\ninevitable death threw him into such pangs of remorse, that he submitted\r\nto be laid on ashes with a cord round his neck; and, in this situation,\r\nhe chaunted a deep sense of his late trangression.\r\n\r\nLully contributed greatly to the improvement of French music. In his\r\novertures he introduced fugues, and was the first who, in the choruses,\r\nmade use of the side and kettle drums. It is difficult to characterize\r\nhis style, which seems to have been derived from no other source than\r\nhis own invention.\r\n\r\nHis compositions were chiefly operas and other dramatic entertainments,\r\nadapted to the desires of Louis XIV., who was fond of dancing, and had\r\nnot taste for any music but airs, in the composition of which a stated\r\nnumber of bars was the chief rule to be observed. Of harmony or fine\r\nmelody, or of the relation between poetry and music, he seems to have\r\nhad no conception; and these were restraints upon Lully’s talents.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been the inventor of that species of composition, the\r\noverture; for, though the symphonies or preludes of Carissimi, Colonna,\r\nand others, are, in effect, overtures, yet they were compositions of a\r\nmild and placid kind, while Lully’s are animated and full of energy.[88]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the character of Lully’s compositions, when unrestricted\r\nby the royal command and the bad taste of the court, he was one day\r\nreproached with having set nothing to music but languid verses. He flew\r\nto his harpsichord, and wildly running over the keys, sung, with great\r\nviolence of gesture, the following terrific lines from Racine’s tragedy\r\nof “Iphigenie:”\r\n\r\n    “Un prêtre environne d’une foule cruelle\r\n    Portera sur ma fille, une maine criminelle\r\n    Dechirera son sein, et d’un œil curieux\r\n    Dans son cœur palpitant consultera les Dieux.”\r\n\r\nWhen cardinal d’Estrees was at Rome, he highly praised Corelli’s sonatas\r\nto that eminent composer. “Sir,” replied Corelli, “if they have any\r\nmerit it is because I have studied Lully.” Handel has imitated Lully in\r\nmany of his overtures.[89]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·79.\r\n\r\n  [87] Doblado’s Letters from Spain.\r\n\r\n  [88] Biograph.

The\r\nRomish church this day institutes certain ceremonies to commemorate the\r\nwashing of the disciples’ feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Celebration of the day at Seville._\r\n\r\nThe particulars of these solemnities are recorded by the rev. Blanco\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of the high mass, are especially intended as a\r\nremembrance of the last supper, and the service, as it proceeds, rapidly\r\nassumes the deepest hues of melancholy. The bells, in every steeple,\r\nfrom one loud and joyous peal, cease at once, and leave a peculiar heavy\r\nstillness, which none can conceive but those who have lived in a\r\npopulous Spanish town long enough to lose the sense of that perpetual\r\ntinkling which agitates the ear during the day and great part of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn every church a “host,” consecrated at the mass, is carried with great\r\nsolemnity to a temporary structure, called the _monument_, which is\r\nerected with more or less splendour, according to the wealth of the\r\nestablishment. It is there deposited in a silver urn, generally shaped\r\nlike a sepulchre, the key of which, hanging from a gold chain, is\r\ncommitted by the priest to the care of a chief inhabitant of the parish,\r\nwho wears it round his neck as a badge of honour, till the next\r\nmorning. The key of the cathedral monument is intrusted to the\r\narchbishop, if present, or to the dean in his absence.\r\n\r\nThe striking effect of the last-mentioned structure, the “monument” in\r\nthe cathedral, is not easily conceived. It fills up the space between\r\nfour arches of the nave, rising in five bodies to the roof of the\r\ntemple. The columns of the two lower tiers, which, like the rest of the\r\nmonument, imitate white marble filletted with gold, are hollow, allowing\r\nthe numerous attendants who take care of the lights that cover it from\r\nthe ground to the very top, to do their duty during four-and-twenty\r\nhours, without any disturbance or unseemly bustle. More than three\r\nthousand pounds of wax, besides one hundred and sixty silver lamps, are\r\nemployed in the illumination.\r\n\r\nThe gold casket set with jewels, which contains the host, lies deposited\r\nin an elegant temple of massive silver, weighing five hundred and ten\r\nmarks, which is seen through a blaze of light on the pediment of the\r\nmonument. Two members of the chapter in their choral robes, and six\r\ninferior priests in surplices, attend on their knees before the shrine,\r\ntill they are relieved by an equal number of the same classes at the end\r\nof every hour. This adoration is performed without interruption from the\r\nmoment of depositing the host in the casket till that of taking it out\r\nthe next morning. The cathedral, as well as many others of the\r\nwealthiest churches, are kept open and illuminated the whole night.\r\n\r\nOne of the public sights of the town, on this day, is the splendid cold\r\ndinner which the archbishop gives to twelve paupers, in commemoration of\r\nthe apostles. The dinner is to be seen laid out on tables filling up two\r\nlarge rooms in the palace. The twelve guests are completely clothed at\r\nthe expense of their host; and having partaken of a more homely dinner\r\nin the kitchen, they are furnished with large baskets to take away the\r\nsplendid commons allotted to each in separate dishes, which they sell to\r\nthe _gourmands_ of the town. Each, besides, is allowed to dispose of his\r\nnapkin, curiously made up into the figure of some bird or quadruped,\r\nwhich people buy as ornaments to their china cupboards, and as specimens\r\nof the perfection to which some of the poorer nuns have carried the art\r\nof plaiting.\r\n\r\nAt two in the afternoon, the archbishop, attended by his chapter,\r\nrepairs to the cathedral, where he performs the ceremony, which, from\r\nthe notion of its being literally enjoined by our saviour, is called the\r\n_mandatum_. The twelve paupers are seated on a platform erected before\r\nthe high altar, and the prelate, stripped of his silk robes, and\r\nkneeling successively before each, washes their feet in a large silver\r\nbason.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the processions, known by the name of _cofradías_,\r\n(confraternities) begin to move out of the different churches to which\r\nthey are attached. The head of the police appoints the hour when each of\r\nthese pageants is to appear in the square of the town hall, and the\r\n_audiencia_ or court of justice. From thence their route to the\r\ncathedral, and out of it, to a certain point, is the same for all. These\r\nstreets are lined by two rows of spectators of the lower classes, the\r\nwindows being occupied by those of a higher rank. An order is previously\r\npublished by the town-crier, directing the inhabitants to decorate their\r\nwindows, which they do by hanging out the showy silk and chintz\r\ncounterpanes of their beds. As to the processions themselves, except one\r\nwhich has the privilege of parading the town in the dead of night, they\r\nhave little to attract the eye or affect the imagination. Their chief\r\nobject is to convey groups of figures, as large as life, representing\r\ndifferent scenes of our saviour’s passion.\r\n\r\nThere is something remarkable in the established and characteristic\r\nmarks of some figures. The Jews are distinguished by long aquiline\r\nnoses. Saint Peter is completely bald. The dress of the apostle John is\r\ngreen, and that of Judas Iscariot yellow; and so intimately associated\r\nis this circumstance with the idea of the traitor, that it has brought\r\nthat colour into universal discredit. It is probably from this\r\ncircumstance, (though yellow may have been allotted to Judas from some\r\nmore ancient prejudice,) that the inquisition has adopted it for the\r\n_sanbenito_, or coat of infamy, which persons convicted of heresy are\r\ncompelled to wear. The red hair of Judas, like Peter’s baldness, seems\r\nto be agreed upon by all the painters and sculptors in Europe. _Judas’\r\nhair_ is a usual name in Spain; and a similar application, it should\r\nseem, was used in England in Shakspeare’s time. “His hair,” says\r\nRosalind, in _As you like it_, “is of the dissembling colour:” to which\r\nCelia answers--“Something browner than Judas’s.”\r\n\r\nThe midnight procession derives considerable effect from the stillness\r\nof the hour, and the dress of the attendants on the sacred image. None\r\nare admitted to this religious act but the members of that fraternity;\r\ngenerally young men of fashion. They all appear in a black tunic, with a\r\nbroad belt so contrived as to give the idea of a long rope tied tight\r\nround the body; a method of penance commonly practised in former times.\r\nThe face is covered with a long black veil, falling from a sugar-loaf\r\ncap three feet high. Thus arrayed, the nominal _penitents_ advance, with\r\nsilent and measured steps, in two lines, dragging a train six feet long,\r\nand holding aloft a wax-candle of twelve pounds, which they rest upon\r\nthe hip-bone, holding it obliquely towards the vacant space between\r\nthem. The veils, being of the same stuff with the cap and tunic, would\r\nabsolutely impede the sight but for two small holes through which the\r\neyes are seen to gleam, adding no small effect to the dismal appearance\r\nof such strange figures. The pleasure of appearing in a disguise, in a\r\ncountry where masquerades are not tolerated by the government, is a\r\ngreat inducement, to the young men for subscribing to this religious\r\nassociation. The disguise, it is true, does not in the least relax the\r\nrules of strict decorum which the ceremony requires; yet the mock\r\npenitents think themselves repaid for the fatigue and trouble of the\r\nnight by the fresh impression which they expect to make on the already\r\nwon hearts of their mistresses, who, by preconcerted signals, are\r\nenabled to distinguish their lovers, in spite of the veils and the\r\nuniformity of the dresses.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely forty years since the disgusting exhibition of people\r\nstreaming in their own blood, was discontinued by an order of the\r\ngovernment. These _penitents_ were generally from among the most\r\ndebauched and abandoned of the lower classes. They appeared in white\r\nlinen petticoats, pointed white caps and veils, and a jacket of the same\r\ncolour, which exposed their naked shoulders to view. Having, previous to\r\ntheir joining the procession, been scarified on the back, they beat\r\nthemselves with a cat-o’nine-tails, making the blood run down to the\r\nskirts of their garment. It may be easily conceived that religion had\r\nno share in these voluntary inflictions. There was a notion afloat,\r\nthat this act of penance had an excellent effect on the\r\nconstitution.[90]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pope commemorates the washing of the disciples’ feet by officiating\r\nin person. A modern traveller who was present at the ceremony\r\nsays,--“There were _thirteen_ instead of twelve; the one being the\r\nrepresentative of the angel that once came to the table of twelve that\r\nSt. Gregory was serving. The twelve were old priests, but the one who\r\nperformed the part of the angel was very young. They were all dressed in\r\nloose white gowns, and white caps on their heads, and clean woollen\r\nstockings, and were seated in a row along the wall, under a canopy. When\r\nthe pope entered and took his seat at the top of the room, the whole\r\ncompany of them knelt in their places, turning towards him; and on his\r\nhand being extended in benediction, they all rose again and reseated\r\nthemselves. The splendid garments of the pope were then taken off; and\r\nclad in a white linen robe which he had on under the others, and wearing\r\nthe bishop’s mitre instead of the tiara, he approached the pilgrims,\r\ntook from an attendant cardinal a silver bucket of water, knelt before\r\nthe first of them, immersed one foot in the water, put water over it\r\nwith his hand, and touched it with a square fringed cloth; kissed the\r\nleg, and gave the cloth, and a sort of white flower or feather, to the\r\nman; then went on to the next. The whole ceremony was over, I think, in\r\nless than two minutes, so rapidly was this act of humility gone through.\r\nFrom thence the pope returned to his throne, put on his robes of white\r\nand silver again, and proceeded to the Sala di Tavola: the thirteen\r\npriests were seated in a row at the table, which was spread with a\r\nvariety of dishes, and adorned with a profusion of flowers. The pope\r\ngave the blessing, and walking along the side of the table opposite to\r\nthem, handed each of them bread, then plates, and lastly, cups of wine.\r\nThey regularly all rose up to receive what he presented; and the pope\r\nhaving gone through the forms of service, and given them his parting\r\nbenediction, left them to finish their dinner in peace. They carry away\r\nwhat they cannot eat, and receive a small present in money besides.”[91]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 43·15\r\n\r\n  [90] Doblado’s Letters from Spain.\r\n\r\n  [91] Rome in the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 24.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD FRIDAY.\r\n\r\nThis annual commemoration is the only one observed in England, with the\r\nexception of Christmas, by the suspension of all business, and the\r\nclosing of shops. The late bishop Porteus having particularly insisted\r\non this method of keeping Good Friday, the reverend Robert Robinson of\r\nCambridge wrote a remarkable pamphlet, entitled, “The History and\r\nMystery of Good Friday,” wherein he urges various statements and\r\narguments against the usage. This tract has been published from time to\r\ntime by Mr. Benjamin Flower. The controversy is referred to, because the\r\nwritings of the bishop and his opponent state the grounds on both sides.\r\nIt is to be remarked likewise, that several dissenters openly engage in\r\ntheir usual avocations, contrary to the general practice, which does not\r\nappear to be enforced by the church of England, farther than by notices\r\nthrough the parochial beadle and other officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hot-cross Buns._\r\n\r\nOn the popular cry of “hot-cross buns,” and the custom of eating them\r\nto-day, there are particulars in vol. i. p. 402; and in the illustration\r\nof the ancient name and use of the _bun_, a few interesting passages are\r\nadded. “The offerings which people in ancient times used to present to\r\nthe gods, were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple;\r\nespecially every species of consecrated bread, which was denominated\r\naccordingly. One species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the\r\ngods, was of great antiquity, and called _boun_. The Greeks, who changed\r\nthe _nu_ final into a _sigma_, expressed it in the nominative Βους, but\r\nin the accusative more truly _boun_, Βουν. Hesychius speaks of the\r\n_boun_, and describes it a kind of cake with a representation of two\r\nhorns. Julius Pollux mentions it after the same manner, a sort of cake\r\nwith horns. Diogenes Laertius, speaking of the same offering being made\r\nby Emperocles, describes the chief ingredients of which it was\r\ncomposed:--‘he offered up one of the sacred libra, called a _boun_,\r\nwhich was made of fine flour and honey.’ It is said of Cecrops, he first\r\noffered up this sort of sweet bread. Hence we may judge of the antiquity\r\nof the custom, from the times to which Cecrops is referred. The prophet\r\nJeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering when he is speaking of\r\nthe Jewish women at Pathros, in Egypt, and of their base idolatry; in\r\nall which their husbands had encouraged them: the women, in their\r\nexpostulation upon his rebuke, tell him, ‘Did we make her cakes to\r\nworship her?’ &c. Jer. xliv. 18, 19. Ib. vii. 18.[92]”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irish Custom._\r\n\r\nIn the midland districts of Ireland, viz. the province of Connaught, on\r\nGood Friday, it is a common practice with the lower orders of Irish\r\ncatholics to prevent their young from having any sustenance, even to\r\nthose at the breast, from twelve on the previous night to twelve on\r\nFriday night, and the fathers and mothers will only take a small piece\r\nof dry bread and a draught of water during the day. It is a common sight\r\nto see along the roads between the different market towns, numbers of\r\nwomen with their hair dishevelled, barefooted, and in their worst\r\ngarments; all this is in imitation of Christ’s passion.[93]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, as a catholic country, excessive attention prevails to the\r\nremarkable instances in the passion of Christ, which terminated in the\r\ncrucifixion; and a revelation from Christ himself, to three nuns\r\ncanonized by the Romish church, has been devised to heighten the fervour\r\nof the ignorant. The Irish journals of 1770, contain the copy of a\r\nsingular paper said to have been sold to devotees at a high price, viz.\r\n\r\n         H\r\n       I | S\r\n  HOLY---+---JUBILEE, 1770.\r\n         |\r\n         |\r\n\r\n“This revelation was made by the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, to\r\nthose three saints, viz. St. Elizabeth, St. Clare, and St. Bridget,\r\nthey being desirous to know something in particular of the blessed\r\npassion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n“First, I received 30 cuffs; 2dly, when I was apprehended in the garden,\r\nI received 40 blows: 3dly, I journeying to Annas’s house, got 7 falls:\r\n4thly, they gave me 444 blows of whips upon my shoulders: 5thly, they\r\nraised me up from the ground, by the hair of the head, 330 times: 6thly,\r\nthey gave me 30 blows against my teeth: 7thly, I have breathed 8888\r\nsighs: 8thly, they drew me by my beard 35 times: 9thly, I received one\r\nmortal wound at the foot of the cross: 10th, 666 blows they gave me when\r\nI was bound to the pillar of stone: 11th, they set a crown of thorns\r\nupon my head: 12th, they have spitted at me 63 times: 13th, the soldiers\r\ngave me 88 blows of whips: 14th, they gave me gall and vinegar to drink:\r\n15th, when I hanged on the cross I received five mortal wounds.\r\n\r\n“All men or women that will say seven paters, seven aves, and a creed\r\ndaily, in honour of the blessed passion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist, for the space of 15 years, they shall obtain five graces: first,\r\nthey shall receive plenary indulgence and remission of their sins; 2dly,\r\nthey will not suffer the pains of purgatory; 3dly, if it happen that\r\nthey die before 15 years be ended, they shall obtain grace as well as if\r\nthey had suffered martyrdom; 4thly, in point of death, I will not come\r\nmyself alone, to receive his own soul, but also his parents, if they be\r\nin purgatory; finally, I will convert them into everlasting bliss.\r\n\r\n“This revelation hath those virtues, that whosoever shall carry it about\r\nhim, shall be free from his enemies, neither will he die of any sudden\r\ndeath; and if there be any woman with child, that carry this revelation\r\nabout her, she shall feel no pain in child-birth; and in whatsoever part\r\nof the house this revelation shall lye, it shall not be infected with\r\nany contagious diseases, or any other evil: and whosoever shall carry it\r\nabout him, the glorious virgin Mary will show herself to him 46 days\r\nbefore his death.”\r\n\r\n    H\r\n  I | S\r\n  --+--\r\n    |\r\n    |\r\n\r\n\r\nThe custom of preaching at St. Paul’s cross on Good Friday and other\r\nholidays, and some account of the cross itself is communicated in the\r\nfollowing letter of a correspondent, who will be recognised by his\r\ninitials to have been a contributor of former interesting articles.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Kennington, March 10, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following account of a sermon, annually preached on Good\r\nFriday at St. Paul’s cross, with a brief notice of that structure, will\r\nI hope be considered worthy preservation in your valuable miscellany.\r\n\r\nIt was, for a considerable period, a custom on Good Friday in the\r\nafternoon, for some learned man, by appointment of the bishop, to preach\r\na sermon at Paul’s cross, which was situated in the midst of the\r\nchurchyard on the north side towards the east end. The sermon generally\r\ntreated of Christ’s passion; and upon the ensuing Monday, Tuesday, and\r\nWednesday in Easter week, other learned men used to preach in a similar\r\npulpit, at the Spital, now the Old Artillery Ground, Spitalfields; the\r\nsubject of their discourse was the articles of Christ’s resurrection.\r\nThen, on Low Sunday, another divine was at Paul’s cross, to make a\r\nrehearsal of the four former sermons, either commending or disproving\r\nthem as in his judgment he thought fit; all this done, (which by the by\r\nwas no easy task,) he was to make a sermon himself, which in all were\r\nfive sermons in one. At these sermons, so severally preached, the mayor,\r\nwith his brethren the aldermen, were accustomed to be present in their\r\n“violets,” at St. Paul’s on Good Friday, and in their “scarlets,” both\r\nthey and their ladies, at the Spital, in the holidays, except Wednesday\r\nin violet; and the mayor, with his brethren, on Low Sunday, in scarlet,\r\nat Paul’s cross. Since the Restoration these sermons were continued, by\r\nthe name of the Spital sermons, at St. Bride’s, with the like solemnity,\r\non Easter Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, every year.\r\n\r\nRespecting the antiquity of this custom, I learn from Maitland, that, in\r\nthe year 1398, king Richard having procured from Rome confirmation of\r\nsuch statutes and ordinances as were made in the parliament begun at\r\nWestminster and ended at Shrewsbury, he caused the same confirmation to\r\nbe read and pronounced at Paul’s cross, and at St. Mary, Spital, in the\r\nsermons before all the people. Philip Malpas, one of the sheriffs, in\r\nthe year 1439, the eighteenth of Henry VII., gave twenty shillings a\r\nyear to the three preachers at the Spital. Stephen Foster, mayor, in the\r\nyear 1454, gave forty shillings to the preachers of Paul’s cross and\r\nSpital. Opposite the pulpit at the Spital, was a handsome house of two\r\nstories high, for the mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, and other persons of\r\ndistinction, to sit in, to hear the sermons preached in the Easter\r\nholidays; in the part above, stood the bishop of London and other\r\nprelates.\r\n\r\nIn foul and rainy weather, these solemn sermons were preached in a place\r\ncalled _the shrowds_, which was by the side of the cathedral church\r\nunder covering, but open in front.--_Ellis’s St. Paul’s Cathedral, p.\r\n52._\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of these St. Paul’s cross sermons, many of the\r\ncitizens were liberal benefactors; as Aylmer, bishop of London, the\r\ncountess dowager of Shrewsbury, Thomas Russell, George Bishop, who gave\r\nten pounds a year, &c.; and for further encouragement of those\r\npreachers, in the year 1607, the lord mayor and court of aldermen then\r\nordered, “that every one that should preach there, considering the\r\njournies some of them might take from the universities, or elsewhere,\r\nshould at his pleasure be freely entertained, for five days space, with\r\nsweet and convenient lodging, fire, candle, and all other necessaries,\r\nviz. from Thursday before their day of preaching, to Thursday morning\r\nfollowing.” This provision had a good effect, and the custom continued\r\nfor some time, added to which the bishop of London, or his chaplain,\r\nwhen he sent to any one to preach, signified the place whither he might\r\nsojourn at his coming up, and be entertained freely. Towards this charge\r\nof the city, George Palin, a merchant of London, gave two hundred pounds\r\nto defray expenses.\r\n\r\nAt some future time a few observations on crosses will be introduced; at\r\npresent I shall confine myself to the history of St. Paul’s cross, which\r\nwas used, not only for the instruction of mankind by the doctrine of the\r\npreacher, but for every purpose, political or ecclesiastical; for giving\r\nforce to oaths; for promulgating laws; or rather, the royal pleasure;\r\nfor the emission of papal bulls; for anathematizing sinners; for\r\nbenedictions; for exposing penitents under censure of the church; for\r\nrecantations; for the private ends of the ambitious; and for defaming\r\nthose who had incurred the displeasure of the crown. _Pennant, 4to.\r\n394._\r\n\r\nTo enter minutely into all the events connected with the history of this\r\ncross would be a work of considerable labour and difficulty, added to\r\nwhich, space could not be well spared in a work of the present nature. I\r\nshall therefore only notice some of the most remarkable that occur in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Sermon at St. Paul’s Cross on Good Friday.~]\r\n\r\nThis cross was strongly built of timber, mounted upon steps of stone,\r\nand covered with lead. The earliest mention of it occurs in the year\r\n1259, when king Henry III. commanded a general assembly to be made at\r\nthe cross, where he in person commanded the mayor that on the morrow he\r\nshould cause to be sworn before the alderman, every youth of twelve\r\nyears of age or upward, to be true to the king and his heirs kings of\r\nEngland. In the same year Henry III. caused to be read at this cross a\r\nbull obtained from pope Urban IV. as an absolution for him and for all\r\nthat were sworn to maintain the articles made in the parliament at\r\nOxford. In the year 1299, the dean of St. Paul’s cursed at the cross\r\nall those which had searched in the church of St. Martin in the Fields\r\nfor a hoard of gold, &c.\r\n\r\nThis pulpit cross was by tempest of lightning and thunder, much defaced\r\nThomas Kempe, bishop of London, from 28 Hen. VI. to 5 Hen. VII., new\r\nbuilt the pulpit and cross.\r\n\r\nThe following is curious:--\r\n\r\n“On the 8th day of March, 1555, while a doctor preached at the cross, a\r\nman did penance for transgressing Lent, holding two pigs ready drest,\r\nwhereof one was upon his head, having brought them to sell.”--[_Strype’s\r\nEcclesiastical Memorials._]\r\n\r\nBefore this cross, in 1483, was brought, divested of all her splendour,\r\nJane Shore, the charitable, the merry concubine of Edward IV., and after\r\nhis death, of his favourite the unfortunate lord Hastings. After the\r\nloss of her protectors, she fell a victim to the malice of the\r\ncrook-backed tyrant Richard III. He was disappointed (by her excellent\r\ndefence) of convicting her of witchcraft, and confederating with her\r\nlover to destroy him. He then attacked her on the side of frailty. This\r\nwas undeniable. He consigned her to the severity of the church: she was\r\ncarried to the bishop’s palace, clothed in a white sheet, with a taper\r\nin her hand, and from thence conducted to the cathedral, and the cross,\r\nbefore which she made a confession of her only fault. “In her penance\r\nshe went,” says Holinshed, “in countenance and pase demure, so womanlie,\r\nthat albeit she were out of all araie, save her kirtle onlie, yet went\r\nshe so faire and lovelie, namelie, while the woondering of the people\r\ncast a comelie rud in hir cheeks (of whiche she before had most misse),\r\nthat hir great shame was hir much praise among those that were more\r\namorous of hir bodie than curious of hir soule. And manie good folkes\r\nthat hated hir living (and glad were to see sin corrected), yet pitied\r\nthey more hir penance than rejoised therin, when they considered that\r\nthe Protector procured it more of a corrupt intent, than anie virtuous\r\naffection.”--[_Hardyng’s Chron._ 4to. Lond. 1812. p. 499.] She lived to\r\na great age, but in great distress and poverty; deserted even by those\r\nto whom she had, during prosperity, done the most essential services.\r\n\r\nIn 1538, “The 24th of February being Sunday, the Rood of Boxeley, in\r\nKent, called the ‘Rood of Grace,’ made with divers vices, to move the\r\neyes and lips, was shewed at Pawle’s Cross by the preacher, which was\r\nthe bishop of Rochester, and there it was broken and plucked to\r\npieces.”--[_Stow’s Annals_, p. 575.]\r\n\r\n“On the 17th of November, 1595, a day of great triumph for the long and\r\nprosperous raigne of her majestie (queen Elizabeth) at London, the\r\npulpit crosse in Pawle’s churchyard was new repayred, painted, and\r\npartly inclosed with a wal of bricke: Doctour Fletcher, bishop of\r\nLondon, preached there in prayse of the queene, and prayer for her\r\nmajestie, before the lord mayor, aldermen, and citizens, in their best\r\nliveries. Which sermon being ended, upon the church leades the trumpets\r\nsounded, the cornets winded, and the quiristers sung an antheme. On the\r\nsteeple many lights were burned: the Tower shot off her ordinance, the\r\nbels were rung, bonefires made,” &c.--[_Stow’s Annals_, p. 770.]\r\n\r\nPennant says, the last sermon which was preached at this place was\r\nbefore James I., who came in great state from Whitehall, on Midlent\r\nSunday, 1620; but Mr. Ellis, the learned and indefatigable editor of the\r\nnew edition of Dugdale’s “History of St. Paul’s Cathedral,” says, there\r\nis a sermon in print, entitled, “The White Wolfe, preached at Paul’s\r\nCrosse, February 11, 1627;” and according to the continuator of “Stow’s\r\nAnnals,” Charles I., on the 30th of May, 1630, having attended divine\r\nservice in the cathedral, “went into a roome, and heard the sermon at\r\nPaule’s Crosse.”--[_Stow’s Annals_, p. 1045.]\r\n\r\nThus this cross stood till it was demolished, in 1643, by order of\r\nparliament, executed by the willing hands of Isaac Pennington, the\r\nfanatical lord mayor of London for that year, who died in the Tower a\r\nconvicted regicide.\r\n\r\nThe engraving at the head of this article is from a drawing in the\r\nPepysian library, and appears to have been the same that was erected\r\n_circa_ 1450.\r\n\r\nThere is a large painting of this cross as it appeared on Sunday, 26th\r\nof March, 1620, when king James I., his queen, Charles, prince of Wales,\r\nthe archbishop of Canterbury, &c. attended with their court. It has been\r\nengraved in Wilkinson’s “Londina Illustrata.”\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  T. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Good Friday at Lisbon._\r\n\r\nTo a protestant, the observance of this holiday in catholic countries is\r\nespecially remarkable. In 1768, the late rev. George Whitefield\r\npublished “An Account of some Lent and other Extraordinary Processions\r\nand Ecclesiastical Entertainments seen at Lisbon; in four Letters to an\r\nEnglish Friend.” Very early in the morning of Good Friday, he had gone\r\non board a vessel at Bellem for the purpose of sailing, but the wind\r\ndying away he returned ashore. “But how was the scene changed! Before,\r\nall used to be noise and hurry; now all was hushed and shut up in the\r\nmost awful and profound silence. No clock or bell had been heard since\r\nyesterday noon, and scarce a person was to be seen in the street all the\r\nway to Lisbon. About two in the afternoon we got to the place where (I\r\nhad heard some days ago) an extraordinary scene was to be exhibited: it\r\nwas ‘the crucifixion of the Son of God, represented partly by dumb\r\nimages, and partly by living persons, in a large church belonging to the\r\nconvent of St. De Beato.’ Several thousands crowded into it, some of\r\nwhich, as I was told, had been waiting there ever since six in the\r\nmorning. I was admitted, and very commodiously situated to view the\r\nwhole performance. We had not waited long before the curtain was drawn\r\nup. Immediately, upon a high scaffold, hung in the front with black\r\nbaize, and behind with silk purple damask laced with gold, was exhibited\r\nto our view an image of the Lord Jesus, at full length, crowned with\r\nthorns, and nailed on a cross, between two figures of like dimensions,\r\nrepresenting the two thieves. At a little distance on the right hand was\r\nplaced an image of the virgin Mary, in plain long ruffles, and a kind of\r\nwidow’s weeds. The veil was purple silk, and she had a wire glory round\r\nher head. At the foot of the cross lay, in a mournful pensive posture, a\r\nliving man dressed in woman’s clothes, who personated Mary Magdalen; and\r\nnot far off stood a young man, in imitation of the beloved disciple. He\r\nwas dressed in a loose green silk vesture and bob-wig. His eyes were\r\nfixed on the cross, and his two hands a little extended. On each side,\r\nnear the front of the stage, stood two sentinels in buff, with\r\nformidable caps and long beards; and directly in the front stood another\r\nyet more formidable, with a large target in his hand. We may suppose him\r\nto be the Roman centurion. To complete the scene, from behind the purple\r\nhangings came out about twenty little purple-vested winged boys, two by\r\ntwo, each bearing a lighted wax taper in his hand, and having a crimson\r\nand gold cap on his head. At their entrance upon the stage, they gently\r\nbowed their heads to the spectators, then kneeled and made obeisance,\r\nfirst to the image on the cross, and then to that of the virgin Mary.\r\nWhen risen, they bowed to each other, and then took their respective\r\nplaces over against one another, on steps assigned for them on the front\r\nof the stage. Opposite to this, at a few yards’ distance, stood a black\r\nfriar in a pulpit hung with mourning. For a while he paused, and then\r\nbreaking silence, gradually raised his voice till it was extended to a\r\npretty high pitch, though I think scarcely high enough for so large an\r\nauditory. After he had proceeded in his discourse about a quarter of an\r\nhour, a confused noise was heard near the great front door; and turning\r\nmy head, I saw four long-bearded men, two of whom carried a ladder on\r\ntheir shoulders; and after them followed two more, with large gilt\r\ndishes in their hands, full of linen, spices, &c.; these, as I imagined,\r\nwere the representatives of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimatlian. On a\r\nsignal given from the pulpit, they advanced towards the steps of the\r\nscaffold; but, upon their first attempting to mount it, at the watchful\r\ncenturion’s nod, the observant soldiers made a pass at them, and\r\npresented the points of their javelins directly to their breasts. They\r\nare repulsed. Upon this, a letter from Pilate is produced. The centurion\r\nreads it, shakes his head, and with looks that bespoke a forced\r\ncompliance, beckons the sentinels to withdraw their arms. Leave being\r\nthus obtained, they ascend; and having paid their homage by kneeling\r\nfirst to the image on the cross and then to the virgin Mary, they\r\nretired to the back of the stage. Still the preacher continued\r\ndeclaiming, or rather, as was said, explaining the mournful scene.\r\nMagdalen persists in wringing her hands, and variously expressing her\r\npersonated sorrow; while John (seemingly regardless of all besides)\r\nstood gazing on the crucified figure. By this time it was nearly three\r\no’clock, and the scene was drawing to a close. The ladders are ascended,\r\nthe superscription and crown of thorns taken off; long white rollers put\r\nround the arms of the image; and then the nails knocked out which\r\nfastened the hands and feet. Here Mary Magdalen looks most languishing,\r\nand John, if possible, stands more thunderstruck than before. The orator\r\nlifts up his voice, and almost all the hearers expressed their concern\r\nby weeping, beating their breasts, and smiting their cheeks. At length\r\nthe body is gently let down; Magdalen eyes it, and gradually rising,\r\nreceives the feet into her wide spread handkerchief; while John (who\r\nhitherto had stood motionless like a statue), as the body came nearer\r\nthe ground, with an eagerness that bespoke the intense affection of a\r\nsympathizing friend, runs towards the cross, seizes the upper part of\r\nit into his clasping arms, and, with his disguised fellow-mourner, helps\r\nto bear it away. And here the play should end, was I not afraid that you\r\nwould be angry with me if I did not give you an account of the last act,\r\nby telling you what became of the corpse after it was taken down. Great\r\npreparations were made for its interment. It was wrapped in linen and\r\nspices, &c. and being laid upon a bier richly hung, was carried round\r\nthe churchyard in grand procession. The image of the virgin Mary was\r\nchief mourner; and John and Magdalen, with a whole troop of friars with\r\nwax tapers in their hands, followed. Determined to see the whole, I\r\nwaited its return, and in about a quarter of an hour the corpse was\r\nbrought in, and deposited in an open sepulchre prepared for the purpose;\r\nbut not before a priest, accompanied by several of the same order, in\r\nsplendid vestments, had perfumed it with incense, sang to, and kneeled\r\nbefore it. John and Magdalen attended the obsequies, but the image of\r\nthe virgin Mary was carried away, and placed in the front of the stage,\r\nin order to be kissed, adored, and worshipped by the people. And thus\r\nends this Good Friday’s tragi-comical, superstitious, idolatrous droll.\r\nI am well aware that the Romanists deny the charge of idolatry; but\r\nafter having seen what I have seen this day, as well as at sundry other\r\ntimes since my arrival here, I cannot help thinking but a person must be\r\ncapable of making more than metaphysical distinctions, and deal in very\r\nabstract ideas indeed, fairly to evade the charge.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Good Friday at Seville._\r\n\r\nThe rev. Blanco White relates the celebration of the day at Seville in\r\nthe following terms:--\r\n\r\nThe altars, which, at the end of yesterday’s mass, were publicly and\r\nsolemnly stripped of their clothes and rich table-hangings by the hands\r\nof the priest, appear in the same state of distressed negligence. No\r\nmusical sound is heard, except the deep-toned voices of the psalm, or\r\nplain chant singers. After a few preparatory prayers, and the dramatized\r\nhistory of the passion, already described, the officiating priest (the\r\narchbishop at the cathedral), in a plain albe or white tunic, takes up a\r\nwooden cross six or seven feet high, which, like all other crosses, has\r\nfor the last two weeks of Lent been covered with a purple veil, and\r\nstanding towards the people, before the middle of the altar, gradually\r\nuncovers the sacred emblem, which both the clergy and laity worship upon\r\ntheir knees. The prelate is then unshod by the assistant ministers, and\r\ntaking the cross upon his right shoulder, as our saviour is represented\r\nby painters on his way to Calvary, he walks alone from the altar to the\r\nentrance of the presbytery or chancel, and lays his burden upon two\r\ncushions. After this, he moves back some steps, and approaching the\r\ncross with three prostrations, kisses it, and drops an oblation of a\r\npiece of silver into a silver dish. The whole chapter, having gone\r\nthrough the same ceremony, form themselves in two lines, and repair to\r\nthe monument, from whence the officiating priest conveys the deposited\r\nhost to the altar, where he communicates upon it without consecrating\r\nany wine. Here the service terminates abruptly; all candles and lamps\r\nare extinguished; and the tabernacle, which throughout the year contains\r\nthe sacred wafers, being left open, every object bespeaks the desolate\r\nand widowed state of the church from the death of the saviour to his\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies of Good Friday being short, and performed at an early\r\nhour, both the gay and the devout would be at a loss how to spend the\r\nremainder of the day but for the grotesque _passion sermons_ of the\r\nsuburbs and neighbouring villages, and the more solemn performance known\r\nby the name of _Tres Horas_,--three hours.\r\n\r\nThe practice of continuing in meditation from twelve to three o’clock of\r\nthis day,--the time which our saviour is supposed to have hung on the\r\ncross,--was introduced by the Spanish Jesuits, and partakes of the\r\nimpressive character which the members of that order had the art to\r\nimpart to the religious practices by which they cherished the devotional\r\nspirit of the people. The church where the _three hours_ are kept is\r\ngenerally hung in black, and made impervious to daylight. A large\r\ncrucifix is seen on the high altar, under a black canopy, with six\r\nunbleached wax candles, which cast a sombre glimmering on the rest of\r\nthe church. The females of all ranks occupy, as usual, the centre of the\r\nnave, squatting or kneeling on the matted ground, and adding to the\r\ndismal appearance of the scene by the colour of their veils and\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\nJust as the clock strikes twelve, a priest in his cloak and cassock\r\nascends the pulpit, and delivers a preparatory address of his own\r\ncomposition. He then reads the printed meditations on the _seven words_,\r\nor sentences, spoken by Jesus on the cross, allotting to each such a\r\nportion of time as that, with the interludes of music which follow each\r\nof the readings, the whole may not exceed three hours. The music is\r\ngenerally good and appropriate, and if a sufficient band can be\r\ncollected, well repays to an amateur the inconvenience of a crowded\r\nchurch, where, from the want of seats, the male part of the congregation\r\nare obliged either to stand or kneel. It is, in fact, one of the best\r\nworks of Haydn, composed a short time ago for some gentlemen of Cadiz,\r\nwho showed both their taste and liberality in thus procuring this\r\nmasterpiece of harmony for the use of their country. It has been lately\r\npublished in Germany under the title of the “Sette Parole.”\r\n\r\nEvery part of the performance is so managed, that the clock strikes\r\nthree about the end of the meditation, on the words, _It is finished_.\r\nThe picture of the expiring saviour, powerfully drawn by the original\r\nwriter of the _Tres Horas_, can hardly fail to strike the imagination\r\nwhen listened to under the influence of such music and scenery; and\r\nwhen, at the first stroke of the clock, the priest rises from his seat,\r\nand in a loud and impassioned voice, announces the consummation of the\r\nawful and mysterious sacrifice, on whose painful and bloody progress the\r\nmind has been dwelling so long, few hearts can repel the impression, and\r\nstill fewer eyes can conceal it. Tears bathe every cheek, and sobs heave\r\nevery female bosom. After a parting address from the pulpit, the\r\nceremony concludes with a piece of music, where the powers of the great\r\ncomposer are magnificently displayed in the imitation of the disorder\r\nand agitation of nature which the evangelists relate.\r\n\r\nThe _passion sermons_ for the populace might be taken for a parody of\r\nthe _three hours_. They are generally delivered in the open air, by\r\nfriars of the Mendicant orders, in those parts of the city and suburbs\r\nwhich are chiefly, if not exclusively, inhabited by the lower classes.\r\nSuch gay young men, however, as do not scruple to relieve the dulness of\r\nGood Friday with a ride, and feel no danger of exposing themselves by\r\nany unseasonable laughter, indulge not unfrequently in the frolic of\r\nattending one of the most complete and perfect sermons of this kind at\r\nthe neighbouring village of Castilleja.\r\n\r\nA movable pulpit is placed before the church door, from which a friar,\r\npossessed of a stentorian voice, delivers an _improved_ history of the\r\npassion, such as was revealed to St. Bridget, a Franciscan nun, who,\r\nfrom the dictation of the virgin Mary, has left us a most minute and\r\ncircumstantial account of the life and death of Christ and his mother.\r\nThis yearly narrative, however, would have lost most of its interest but\r\nfor the scenic illustrations, which keep up the expectation and rivet\r\nthe attention of the audience. It was formerly the custom to introduce a\r\nliving saint Peter--a character which belonged by a natural and\r\ninalienable right to the baldest head in the village--who acted the\r\napostle’s denial, swearing by _Christ_, he did not know the man. This\r\nedifying part of the performance is omitted at Castilleja; though a\r\npractised performer crows with such a shrill and natural note as must be\r\nanswered with challenge by every cock of spirit in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe flourish of a trumpet announces, in the sequel, the publication of\r\nthe sentence passed by the Roman governor; and the town crier delivers\r\nit with legal precision, in the manner it is practised in Spain before\r\nan execution. Hardly has the last word been uttered, when the preacher,\r\nin a frantic passion, gives the crier the _lie direct_, cursing the\r\ntongue that has uttered such blasphemies. He then invites an angel to\r\ncontradict both Pilate and the Jews; when, obedient to the orator’s\r\ndesire, a boy gaudily dressed, and furnished with a pair of gilt\r\npasteboard wings, appears at a window, and proclaims _the true verdict\r\nof heaven_. Sometimes, in the course of the preacher’s narrative, an\r\nimage of the virgin Mary is made to meet that of Christ, on his way to\r\nCalvary, both taking an affectionate leave in the street. The\r\nappearance, however, of the virgin bearing a handkerchief to collect a\r\nsum for her son’s burial, is never omitted; both because it melts the\r\nwhole female audience into tears, and because it produces a good\r\ncollection for the convent. The whole is closed by the _descendimiento_,\r\nor unnailing a crucifix, as large as life, from the cross, an operation\r\nperformed by two friars, who, in the character of Joseph of Arimathea\r\nand Nicodemus, are seen with ladders and carpenters’ tools letting down\r\nthe jointed figure, to be placed on a bier and carried into the church\r\nin the form of a funeral.\r\n\r\nI have carefully glided over such parts of this absurd performance as\r\nwould shock many an English reader, even in narrative. Yet, such is the\r\nstrange mixture of superstition and profaneness in the people for whose\r\ngratification these scenes are exhibited, that, though any attempt to\r\nexpose the indecency of these shows would rouse their zeal “to the\r\nknife,” I cannot venture to translate the jokes and sallies of wit that\r\nare frequently heard among the Spanish peasantry upon these sacred\r\ntopics.[94]\r\n\r\nJudas is a particular object of execration on Good Friday, in the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese navy. An eye-witness relates the following\r\noccurrences at Monte Video. “The three last days had been kept as days\r\nof sorrow; all the ships in the harbour expressed it by having their\r\ncolours hoisted only half-mast high, as a token of mourning, and the\r\nyards crossed as much as possible, to make them resemble a crucifix,\r\nwhile apparent solemnity prevailed both on shore and in the harbour; but\r\nimmediately on a signal, when the minute arrived, all being in waiting,\r\nthe yards were squared, the colours hoisted wholly up, and the guns\r\nfired from all the ships in the harbour, while the bells on shore were\r\nset ringing promiscuously, as fast as possible; and at the bowsprit, or\r\nyard-arm of the ships was suspended an effigy of Judas, which they began\r\nto dip in the river, acting with the greatest possible enthusiasm and\r\nridiculous madness, beating it on the shoulders, dipping it, and then\r\nrenewing their former ridiculous conduct.”[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relics of the Crucifixion._\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More, in his “Dialogue concernynge Heresyes, 1528,” says, “Ye\r\nmight upon Good Friday, every yere this two hundred yere, till within\r\nthis five yere that the turkes have taken the towne, have sene one of\r\nthe thornes that was in Cristes crowne, bud and bring forth flowers in\r\nthe service time, if ye would have gone to Rodes.” The printing press\r\nhas done more mischief to miracles of this sort than the Turks.\r\n\r\nPatience seems to have been wearied in supplying relics to meet the\r\nenormous demand. Invention itself became exhausted; for the cravings of\r\ncredulity are insatiable. If angels are said to weep at man’s “fantastic\r\ntricks before high heaven,” protestants may smile, while, perhaps, many\r\ncatholics deplore the countless frauds devised by Romish priests of\r\nknavish minds, for cajoling the unwary and the ignorant. “The greater\r\nthe miracle the greater the saint,” has been assuredly a belief; and,\r\naccording to that belief, the greater the relics, the greater the\r\npossessors must have appeared, in the eyes of the vulgar. In this view\r\nthere is no difficulty in accounting for hordes of trumpery in shrines\r\nand reliquaries.\r\n\r\nThe instruments of the crucifixion--the very inscription on the\r\ncross--the crown of thorns--the nails--the lance--are shown to the\r\npresent hour, as the _true_ inscription, the _true_ thorns, the _true_\r\nnails, and the _true_ lance. So also there are exhibitions of the _true_\r\nblood, yet it is a printed truth, that what is exposed to worshippers in\r\nchurches by ecclesiastics for _true_ blood, is doubted of by the rev.\r\nAlban Butler. In a note to his article on “The Invention of the Holy\r\nCross,” he states a ground for his incredulity, quite as singular as\r\nthat whereon holders of the _true_ blood maintain their faith. His words\r\nare: “The _blood_ of Christ, which is kept in some places, of which the\r\nmost famous is that at Mantua, seems to be what has sometimes issued\r\nfrom the miraculous bleeding of some crucifix, when pierced in derision\r\nby Jews or Pagans, instances of which are recorded in authentic\r\nhistories.”[96] Though, as a catholic priest and biographer well\r\nacquainted with these “authentic histories,” Mr. Butler might have set\r\nthem forth, yet he abstains from the disclosure; and hence on their\r\nsuperior credibility in his eyes, to the credibility of the declarations\r\nand testimonials urged by the owners of the blood itself, we may choose\r\nbetween _their_ requisition to believe that the blood is the _true_\r\nblood, and Mr. Butler’s belief, that it is the blood of bleeding\r\ncrucifixes. So stands the question of credibility.\r\n\r\nConcerning the alleged implements of the crucifixion, it would be\r\ncurious to examine particulars; but we are limited in room, and shall\r\nonly recur to one--\r\n\r\n\r\n  “THE HOLY LANCE.”\r\n\r\nRespecting this weapon, reference should be first made to the great\r\nauthority cited above. Mr. Butler, speaking of other instruments of\r\nChrist’s crucifixion, which he maintains to be genuine, says:--\r\n\r\n“The _holy lance_ which opened his sacred side, is kept at Rome, but\r\nwants the point. Andrew of Crete says, that it was buried, together with\r\nthe cross. At least, St. Gregory of Tours, and venerable Bede, testify,\r\nthat, in their time, it was kept at Jerusalem. For fear of the Saracens\r\nit was buried privately at Antioch; in which city it was found, in 1098,\r\nunder ground, and wrought many miracles, as Robert the monk, and many\r\neye-witnesses, testify. It was carried first to Jerusalem, and soon\r\nafter to Constantinople. The emperor, Baldwin II., sent the point of it\r\nto Venice, by way of pledge for a loan of money. St. Lewis, king of\r\nFrance, redeemed this relick by paying off the sum it lay in pledge for,\r\nand caused it to be conveyed to Paris, where it is still kept in the\r\nholy chapel. The rest of the lance remained at Constantinople, after the\r\nTurks had taken that city, till, in 1492, the sultan Bajazet sent it by\r\nan ambassador, in a rich and beautiful case, to pope Innocent VIII.,\r\nadding, that the point was in the possession of the king of France.”\r\n\r\nThis is Mr. Butler’s account of the “_holy lance_,” without the omission\r\nof a word, which should be recollected for reasons that will be obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Longinus._\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to observe, that there is not any account of this\r\nsaint in Alban Butler’s “Lives of the Saints,” though (in the _Breviar\r\nRoman. Antiq._ 1543) the 15th of March is dedicated to him for his\r\nfestival, and though the saint himself is declared, in the Romish\r\nbreviary, to have been the Roman soldier who pierced the side of the\r\nsaviour with the lance; and that, “being almost blind by the blood which\r\nfell, it is supposed on his eyes, he immediately recovered his sight and\r\nbelieved;” and that, furthermore, “forsaking his military profession he\r\nconverted many to the faith,” and under the president Octavius suffered\r\nmartyrdom.[97]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cardinal Vigerius._\r\n\r\nThis dignitary, who died in 1516, was bishop of Præneste, and\r\narch-priest of the Vatican church. He wrote a book to prove that\r\nChrist’s tunic ought to give place to the eminence of Longinus’s lance.\r\nThe occasion of the work unfolds the history of the _holy lance_. In\r\n1488, the sultan Bajazet II., being in fear of his brother, who had\r\nbecome prisoner to the king of France, offered that sovereign, if he\r\nwould keep his brother in France, all the relics which his late father\r\nMahomet had found in Constantinople when he took that city. Bajazet’s\r\nletter came too late; the court of France had already promised to put\r\nhis brother in the custody of Innocent VIII. “When the sultan knew this,\r\nhe wrote to the pope, and endeavoured to gain him by presents, and\r\namongst others by the iron of the lance that pierced our saviour’s side,\r\nwhich he had before offered to the grand master, and assured him of the\r\npunctual payment of 40,000 ducats every year, on condition that he would\r\nnot let his brother go upon any pretence whatsoever.” It appears,\r\nhowever, that Bajazet retained the relic called the “seamless coat,” and\r\nthat this gave rise to a great dispute in Italy, as to whether the _holy\r\nlance_ presented to the pope, or the _holy coat_, which Bajazet reserved\r\nfor himself, was the most estimable; and hence it was assigned to\r\ncardinal Vigerius to make it clear that the pope had the best relic. He\r\nexecuted the task to the satisfaction of those who contended for the\r\nprecedence of the lance.[98]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE LANCE.\r\n\r\nUtrum horum?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore speaking further on the lance itself, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat Alban Butler has told us, “the holy lance kept at Rome _wants the\r\npoint_,” and that after various adversities, the point was “conveyed to\r\nParis, where it is still kept in the holy chapel.” But Richard Lassels,\r\nwho in his “Voyage of Italy, 1670,” visited the church of St. Peter’s,\r\nRome, says, the cupola of that church rests upon “vast square pillars a\r\nhundred and twenty feet in compass, and capable of stairs within them,\r\nand large sacristyes above for the holy reliques that are kept in them;\r\nto wit--the _top_ of the lance wherewith our saviour’s side was\r\npierced--under the _top_ of the lance the statue of Longinus.” So that\r\nat Rome, where according to Mr. Butler, the “holy lance” itself is kept,\r\nhe omits to mention that there is a _top_ of the lance, besides the\r\nother _top_ “in the holy chapel” at Paris. In that cathedral, too, we\r\nhave the statue of St. Longinus, whom Mr. Butler also, for good reasons\r\nno doubt, omits to mention in his twelve volumes of “Lives of the\r\nSaints.”\r\n\r\nBut there is _another_ “holy lance.” It is kept in the church of the\r\nhospital of Nuremberg, with the crown and sceptre and other regalia of\r\nCharlemagne. Misson so particularly distinguishes it, that his account\r\nshall be given verbatim. After mentioning the sword of Charlemaigne,\r\nwhich its keepers pretend “was brought by an angel from heaven;” he\r\nsays, “they also keep many relics in this church; and among others St.\r\nLongin’s lance.” There is no reason to doubt, therefore, that the\r\necclesiastics of Nuremberg deemed Longinus a saint, as well as the\r\necclesiastics of St. Peter’s at Rome. Misson goes on to say, “They are\r\nnot ignorant that this pretended lance is to be seen in above ten other\r\nplaces of the world; but, they say, theirs came from Antioch; it was St.\r\nAndrew who found it; one single man with it discomfited a whole army; it\r\nwas the thing of the world which Charlemaigne loved most. The other\r\nlances are counterfeits, and this is the _true_ one.” It is requisite to\r\nobserve Misson’s very next words, which, though they do not seem\r\nconnected with this “true lance” of Nuremberg, are yet connected with\r\nthe issue. He proceeds to say, “They have also an extraordinary\r\nveneration for a piece of the cross, in the midst of which there is a\r\nhole that was made by one of the nails. They tell us, that heretofore,\r\nthe emperors placed their greatest hopes of prosperity and success, both\r\nin peace and war, in the possession of this enlivening wood, with the\r\nnail and other relics that are kept at Nuremberg.” Misson then adds, by\r\nway of note, the following\r\n\r\n_List of these Relics._\r\n\r\n  The lance.\r\n\r\n  The piece of the wood of the cross.\r\n\r\n  One of the nails.\r\n\r\n  Five thorns of the crown that was put on Christ’s head.\r\n\r\n  Part of the chains with which St. Peter and St. Paul were bound at\r\n  Rome.\r\n\r\n  A little piece of the manger.\r\n\r\n  A tooth of St. John Baptist.\r\n\r\n  One of St. Anne’s arms.\r\n\r\n  The towel with which Christ wiped the feet of his apostles.\r\n\r\n  A piece of St. John the Evangelist’s gown.\r\n\r\n  A piece from the table cloth which Christ used at his last supper with\r\n  his disciples.\r\n\r\nThese relics, accompanying Misson’s account of the “_true_ lance” of\r\nNuremberg, are here enumerated, because his statement as to the\r\nexistence of the lance, in connection with those relics, is corroborated\r\nby a rare print, sixteen inches and a quarter wide, by thirteen inches\r\nhigh, published by the ecclesiastics of Nuremberg, in the possession of\r\nthe editor of the _Every-Day Book_. It represents the whole of these\r\nrelics at one view, except the five thorns. The true lance, being placed\r\nin the print angle-ways, measures nineteen inches and three quarters,\r\nfrom the point of the sheath to the rim of the iron shaft. The preceding\r\ncolumn contains a reduced fac-simile of this “true” relic. It is not\r\ndenied that the “holy lance” at Paris, “where it is still kept in the\r\nholy chapel,” is also “true”--they are without a shadow of doubt,\r\n_equally_ “true.” See Butler and Misson, and Misson and Butler.\r\n\r\nBy the by, it must be remembered, that the genuine lantern which Judas\r\ncarried, was also “kept at Rome,” when Misson was there; and that, at\r\nthe same time, Judas’s lantern was also at St. Denis in France--both\r\ngenuine.[99]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe romance of “Spomydon,” printed by Wynkyn de Worde, celebrates the\r\nexploits of Charlemagne, for the recovery or the relics of the passion\r\nin the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    ~Cherles--wanne fro the hethen houndes\r\n    The spere and nayles of crystes woundes\r\n    And also the croune of thorne\r\n    And many a ryche relyke mo\r\n    Maugre of them he wanne also\r\n    And kylled them euen and morne.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pilate._\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition at Vienne, that in the reign of the emperor\r\nTiberius, Pontius Pilate was exiled to that city, where he died not long\r\nafter, of grief and despair, for not having prevented the crucifixion of\r\nthe saviour; and his body was thrown into the Rhone. There it remained,\r\nneither carried away by the force of the current, nor consumed by decay,\r\nfor five hundred years; until the town being afflicted with the plague,\r\nit was revealed to the then archbishop, in a vision, that the calamity\r\nwas occasioned by Pilate’s body, which unknown to the good people of\r\nVienne was lying at the foot of a certain tower. The place was\r\naccordingly searched and the body drawn up entire, but nothing could\r\nequal its intolerable odour. Wherefore, it was carried to a marsh two\r\nleagues from the town, and there interred; but for a long series of\r\nyears after, strange noises were reported by certain people to issue\r\nfrom this place continually; these sounds were believed to be the groans\r\nof Pontius Pilate, and the cries of the devils tormenting him. They also\r\nimagined, the neighbourhood of his body to be the cause of violent\r\nstorms of thunder and lightning which are frequent at Vienne; and as\r\nthe tower, where the body was found, has been several times struck by\r\nlightning, it has acquired the name of the tower of _Mauconseil_.[100]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the subjoined letter of a correspondent, who\r\ncommunicates his name to the editor, that remains of the ancient\r\ndisguises are still to be seen in the proceedings of those persons in\r\nthis country, who, towards the termination of the fast of Lent, collect\r\nmaterials for good cheer to make an Easter festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTE EGGS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Liverpool, Good Friday, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--Having been much entertained lately by your accounts of\r\n“festivals, and fairs, and plays,” I am induced to contribute, in some\r\nsmall degree, to the store of amusement in your interesting every-day\r\nmiscellany. The subject on which I am to treat, is a custom that\r\nprevails in the neighbourhood of West Derby, on this day; it is known by\r\nthe denomination of “paste egging,” and is practised by the humbler\r\nclasses of the juvenile peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe parties who are disposed to partake in the fun, disguise themselves\r\nin the most fantastic habiliments--such as clothes turned inside out,\r\nwith strange patches on, some with masks, veils, ribbands, &c.; some\r\nwith faces blacked, and (perhaps, your fair readers may not excuse me\r\nfor telling them that,) even the females disguise their sex! Thus\r\nequipped, they betake themselves (in numbers of from about four to a\r\ndozen of both sexes) to the different farm-houses, and solicit\r\ncontributions towards the “festival” of Easter Sunday. The beginning of\r\nmy tale seems to indicate the sort of gifts that are expected; these\r\ngifts are generally made up of great numbers of eggs and oatmeal cakes.\r\nOne of the party usually carries a basket for the cakes, another for the\r\neggs, and (as our best feasts can scarcely be got up without a portion\r\nof the _one_ thing needful,) a third is the bearer of a small box for\r\npecuniary contributions.\r\n\r\nConscious of the _charms_ of _music_, they generally exhilarate their\r\nbenefactors with some animated songs, appropriate to the occasion, and\r\nsung in excellent taste; and by these means seldom fail to return\r\nhomeward with a plentiful supply of their “paste egg,” and no trivial\r\naid in money. With these materials, a festival is got up on Easter\r\nSunday evening.

The\r\nportico, colonnades, and vestibules, both of the church and palace,\r\nassume the air of the court of a military despot. Every epoch in the\r\nmilitary costume is there gaudily exhibited. Halberdiers in coats of\r\nmail, and slate-coloured pantaloons, which pass upon the faithful for\r\npolished steel armour; the Swiss in their antique dresses of buff and\r\nscarlet, and lamberkeens; the regular troops in their modern uniforms;\r\nthe _guardia nobile_, the pope’s _voltigeurs_, all feathers and\r\nfeebleness, gold and glitter; generals of the British army, colonels and\r\nsubalterns of every possible yeomanry, with captains and admirals of the\r\nnavy, and a host of nondescripts, laymen, and protestant clergymen, who\r\n‘for the nonce’ take shelter under any thing resembling an uniform, that\r\nmay serve as a _passe-partout_, where none are courteously received but\r\nsuch as wear the livery of church or state militant;--all move towards\r\nthe portals of the Sistine chapel, which, with their double guards,\r\nresemble the mouth of a military pass, dangerous to approach, and\r\ndifficult to storm. The ladies press with an imprudent impetuosity upon\r\nthe guards, who, with bayonets fixed and elbows squared, repress them\r\nwith a resistance, such as none but female assailants would dare to\r\nencounter a second time. Thousands of tickets of admission are shown\r\naloft by upraised hands, and seconded by high-raised voices; while the\r\nofficer of the guard, who can read and tear but one at a time, leaves\r\nthe task of repulsion to the Swiss, who manfully second their ‘_allez\r\nfous en_’ with a physical force, that in one or two instances\r\nincapacitated the eager candidates for further application. A few\r\nEnglish favoured by the minister, and all the princes and diplomatists\r\nresident at Rome, pioneered by their guards of honour, make their way\r\nwithout let or molestation. One side of the space, separated from the\r\nchoir by a screen, is fitted up for them apart; the other is for the\r\nwhole female congregation, who are crushed in, like sheep in a fold. The\r\nmen, if in uniform or full court dresses, are admitted to a tribune\r\nwithin the choir; while the inferior crowd, left to shift for\r\nthemselves, rush in with an impetuosity none can resist; for though none\r\nare admitted at all to the chapel without tickets, yet the number of\r\napplicants (almost exclusively foreign) is much too great for the\r\nlimited capacity of the place. A scene of indescribable confusion\r\nensues. The guards get mingled with the multitude. English peers are\r\noverturned by Roman canons. Irish friars batter the old armour of the\r\nmailed halberdiers with fists more formidable than the iron they attack.\r\nItalian priests tumble over tight-laced dandies; and the ‘_Via via_’ of\r\nthe Roman guard, and the ‘_Fous ne restez pas issi_’ of the Swiss mingle\r\nwith screams, supplications and reproofs, long after the solemn service\r\nof the church has begun. The procession of the sacrament to the Paoline\r\nchapel succeeds; its gates are thrown open, and its dusky walls appear\r\nilluminated with thousands of tapers, twinkling in the rays of the\r\nnoonday sun, through an atmosphere of smoke. Few are able to enter the\r\nilluminated chapel, or to behold the deposition of the sacrament; and\r\nmany who are informed of the programme of the day, by endeavouring to\r\ncatch at all the ceremonies, scarcely attain to any.”[101]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Easter Eve in Spain._\r\n\r\nMr. Blanco White says, that the service in the cathedral of Seville\r\nbegins this morning without either the sound of bells or of musical\r\ninstruments. The _paschal chandle_ is seen by the north side of the\r\naltar. It is, in fact, a pillar of wax, nine yards in height, and thick\r\nin proportion, standing on a regular marble pedestal. It weighs eighty\r\n_arrobas_, or two thousand pounds, of twelve ounces. This candle is cast\r\nand painted new every year, the old one being broken into pieces on the\r\nSaturday preceding Whitsunday, the day when part of it is used for the\r\nconsecration of the baptismal font. The sacred torch is lighted with the\r\n_new fire_, which this morning the priest strikes out of a flint, and it\r\nburns during service till Ascension-day. A chorister in his surplice\r\nclimbs up a gilt-iron rod, furnished with steps like a flag-staff, and\r\nhaving the top railed in, so as to admit of a seat on a level with the\r\nend of the candle. From this _crow’s nest_, the young man lights up and\r\ntrims the wax pillar, drawing off the melted wax with a large iron\r\nladle.\r\n\r\nHigh mass begins this day behind the great veil, which for the two last\r\nweeks in Lent covers the altar. After some preparatory prayers, the\r\npriest strikes up the hymn _Gloria in excelsis Deo_. At this moment the\r\nveil flies off, the explosion of fireworks in the upper galleries\r\nreverberates in a thousand echoes from the vaults of the church, and the\r\nfour-and-twenty large bells of its tower awake, with their discordant\r\nthough gladdening sounds, those of the one hundred and forty-six\r\nsteeples which this religious town boasts of. A brisk firing of\r\nmusketry, accompanied by the howling of the innumerable dogs, which,\r\nunclaimed by any master, live and multiply in the streets, adds strength\r\nand variety to this universal din. The firing is directed against\r\nseveral stuffed figures, not unlike Guy Fawkes of the fifth of\r\nNovember, which are seen hanging by the neck on a rope, extended across\r\nthe least frequented streets. It is then that the pious rage of the\r\npeople of Seville is vented against the arch-traitor Judas, whom they\r\nannually hang, shoot, draw, and quarter in effigy.\r\n\r\nThe church service ends in a procession about the aisles. The priest\r\nbears the host in his hands, visible through glass as a picture within a\r\nmedallion. The sudden change from the gloomy appearance of the church\r\nand its ministers, to the simple and joyous character of this\r\nprocession, the very name of _pasqua florída_, the flowery passover,\r\nand, more than the name, the flowers themselves, which well-dressed\r\nchildren, mixed with the censer-bearers, scatter on the ground, crowd\r\nthe mind and heart with the ideas, hopes, and feelings of renovated\r\nlife, and give to this ceremony, even for those who disbelieve the\r\npersonal presence of a Deity triumphant over death, a character of\r\ninexpressible tenderness.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Papal Conversion of the Jews._\r\n\r\nThe day before Easter Sunday at Rome, two or more Jews are procured to\r\nbe baptized. An eye-witness of a couple of these converts, says, “The\r\ntwo devoted Israelites prepared for this occasion, attired in dirty\r\nyellow silk gowns, were seated on a bench within the marble front of the\r\nbaptistery, which resembles a large bath, both in form and shape,\r\nconning their prayers out of a book, with most rueful visages. Fast to\r\ntheir sides stuck their destined godfathers, two black-robed doctors of\r\ndivinity, as if to guard and secure their spiritual captives. The\r\nancient vase at the bottom of the font, in which, according to an absurd\r\nlegend, Constantine was healed of his leprosy by St. Sylvester, stood\r\nbefore them filled with water, and its margin adorned with flowers. The\r\ncardinal bishop, who had been employed ever since six o’clock in the\r\nbenediction of fire, water, oil, wax, and flowers, now appeared,\r\nfollowed by a long procession of priests and crucifixes. He descended\r\ninto the font, repeated a great many prayers in Latin over the water,\r\noccasionally dipping his hand into it. Then a huge flaming wax taper,\r\nabout six feet high, and of proportionate thickness, painted with\r\nimages of the virgin and Christ, which had previously been blessed, was\r\nset upright in the vase; more Latin prayers were mumbled--one of the\r\nJews was brought, the bishop cut the sign of the cross in the hair, at\r\nthe crown of his head, then, with a silver ladle, poured some of the\r\nwater upon the part, baptizing him in the usual forms, both the\r\ngodfathers and he having agreed to all that was required of them. The\r\nsecond Jew was then brought, upon whom the same ceremonies were\r\nperformed; this poor little fellow wore a wig, and, when the cold water\r\nwas poured on his bare skull, he winced exceedingly, and made many wry\r\nfaces. They were then conveyed to the altar of the neighbouring chapel,\r\nwhere they were confirmed, and repeated the creed. The bishop then made\r\nthe sign of the cross upon their foreheads, with holy oil, over which\r\nwhite fillets were immediately tied to secure it; he then pronounced a\r\nlong exhortation, in the course of which he frightened them so that the\r\nlittle Jew with a wig began to cry most bitterly, and would not be\r\ncomforted. This being over, the Jews were conducted, with great\r\nceremony, from the baptistery to the door of the church, where they\r\nstopped, and, after some chanting by the bishop, they were allowed to\r\npass the threshold; they were then seated within the very pale of the\r\naltar, in order that they might witness a succession of various\r\nceremonies.”[103]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greek Preparation for Easter._\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Conner describes the ceremonies of the Greek church at\r\nJerusalem on Easter-eve. “I went to the church to spend the night there,\r\nthat I might view all the different observances. It is a general belief\r\namong the Greeks and Armenians, that, on Easter-eve, a fire descends\r\nfrom heaven into the sepulchre. The eagerness of the Greeks, Armenians,\r\nand others, to light their candles at this holy fire, carried an immense\r\ncrowd to the church, notwithstanding the sum which they were obliged to\r\npay. About nine at night, I retired to rest, in a small apartment in the\r\nchurch. A little before midnight, the servant roused me to see the Greek\r\nprocession. I hastened to the gallery of the church. The scene was\r\nstriking and brilliant. The Greek chapel was splendidly illuminated.\r\nFive rows of lamps were suspended in the dome; and almost every\r\nindividual of the immense multitude held a lighted candle in his hand.”\r\nThe ceremonies on Easter Sunday were very grand.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·85.\r\n\r\n  [101] Lady Morgan’s Italy.\r\n\r\n  [102] Doblado’s Letters.\r\n\r\n  [103] Rome in the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n~March 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTER SUNDAY.\r\n\r\nThere is little trace in England of the imposing effect of this festival\r\nin papal terms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is affirmed, that at Queen’s-college, Oxford, the first dish brought\r\nto the table on Easter-day, is a red herring, riding away on horseback,\r\nthat is to say, a herring placed by the cook, something after the\r\nlikeness of a man on horseback, set on a corn sallad.[104] This is the\r\nonly vestige of the pageants which formerly were publicly exhibited by\r\nway of popular rejoicing for the departure of the forty days Lent fast,\r\nand the return to solid eating with the Easter festival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe custom of eating a gammon of bacon at Easter, still maintained in\r\nsome parts of England, is founded on the abhorrence our forefathers\r\nthought proper to express, in that way, towards the Jews at the season\r\nof commemorating the resurrection.[105]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lifting_ at Easter, and _pace_ or _paste_ eggs, with other usages\r\nderived from catholic customs, are described and traced in vol. i. p.\r\n421.\r\n\r\nSince these “Caps well fit; by Titus in Sandgate and Titus every where,”\r\na curious little duodecimo, printed at Newcastle in 1785, has come into\r\nthe editor’s hands, from whence is extracted the following--\r\n\r\n_Paste Egg Tale_\r\n\r\n    Once--yes once, upon a _Paste-Egg-Day_,\r\n    Some lords and ladies met to play;\r\n    For then such pastimes bore the bell.\r\n    Like old _Olympicks_--full as well;\r\n    And now, our gentry on the green,\r\n    Throng’d forth, to see, and to be seen,\r\n    Moment this, for assignation,\r\n    And all the courtesy of fashion.\r\n\r\n    A poor _old woman_, passing by,\r\n    Gaz’d at the _ring_ with curious eye\r\n    Sometimes frowning, sometimes smiling.\r\n    In thought approving--or reviling.\r\n    Not yet quite froze, by want or age,\r\n    Her fancy could at times engage;\r\n    Her age might reckon eighty-five,\r\n    But curiosity alive,\r\n    She fix’d her barnacles to nose\r\n    The better to observe the shows.\r\n\r\n    Discover’d soon--some wags stept forth,\r\n    And ask’d her, what such sights were worth,\r\n    What did she think of genteel modes,\r\n    Where half believ’d themselves half-Gods?\r\n    And t’other half, so wondrous wise,\r\n    Believe that bliss--in _trifling_ lies?\r\n    They begg’d that she would frank declare\r\n    What she thought such people were?\r\n\r\n    The grey-hair’d matron rubb’d her eyes,\r\n    Then turn’d her glasses to the skies;\r\n    As if to catch some thought in cue,\r\n    To give them truth and laughter too.\r\n    Next, humbly beg’d for some _Paste Eggs_,\r\n    With leave to sit,--to rest her legs.\r\n    Then down she squats, and round they throng,\r\n    Impatient for some _jokelike_ song;\r\n\r\n    Of eggs they brought her number nine,\r\n    All nicely mark’d, and colour’d fine,\r\n    One, was blacker than the sloe,\r\n    Another, white as driven snow.\r\n    Red, crimson, purple, azure, blue,\r\n    Green, pink, and yellow, rose to view.\r\n    She closely _peel’d_ them, one by one,\r\n    Broke this, and that, till all were done.\r\n    Then shrugg’d her shoulders,--wav’d her head,\r\n    But not one syllable she said.\r\n\r\n    Amaz’d, at silence so profound;\r\n    The quality press closer round;\r\n    And gently urg’d her, more and more,\r\n    To answer what they ask’d before?\r\n    And how did one so ripe in years,\r\n    Estimate a life like theirs?\r\n    What semblance, worthy observation,\r\n    Suited the heirs of dissipation?\r\n    Whilst she, kept pressing up and down\r\n    As seeking how their wish to crown.\r\n    What had she apropos to say\r\n    Of persons so superbly gay?\r\n\r\n    In throth--quo’ she, I’m short and plain\r\n    Long speaking only gives me pain;\r\n    And faith I have ye, gentlefolks,\r\n    As clear in view, as whites or yokes,\r\n    So like those eggs--I can but smile,\r\n    In every cast of light and style.\r\n    Your transient colours, fleet as theirs,\r\n    Your _flimsiness_, in spite of airs;\r\n    In substance, scarce more rare or new,\r\n    Some _parboil’d_--some _par-rotten too_:\r\n    Of little worth, in wisdom’s eye,\r\n    And thrown, at last, like egg-shells by.\r\n\r\n    They heard--they frown’d--but fled the green,\r\n    As if a thunderbolt had been.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lostwithiel Custom._\r\n\r\nA very singular custom formerly prevailed at Lostwithiel, in Cornwall,\r\non Easter Sunday. The freeholders of the town and manor having assembled\r\ntogether, either in person or by their deputies, one among them, each in\r\nhis turn, gaily attired and gallantly mounted, with a sceptre in his\r\nhand, a crown on his head, and a sword borne before him, and\r\nrespectfully attended by all the rest on horseback, rode through the\r\nprincipal street in solemn state to the church. At the churchyard stile,\r\nthe curate, or other minister, approached to meet him in reverential\r\npomp, and then conducted him to church to hear divine service. On\r\nleaving the church, he repaired, with the same pomp and retinue, to a\r\nhouse previously prepared for his reception. Here a feast, suited to the\r\ndignity he had assumed, awaited him and his suite; and, being placed at\r\nthe head of the table, he was served, kneeling, with all the rites and\r\nceremonies that a real prince might expect. This ceremony ended with the\r\ndinner; the prince being voluntarily disrobed, and descending from his\r\nmomentary exaltation, to mix with common mortals. On the origin of this\r\ncustom, but one opinion can be reasonably entertained, though it may be\r\ndifficult to trace the precise period of its commencement. It seems to\r\nhave originated in the actual appearance of the prince, who resided at\r\nRestormel castle in former ages; but on the removal of royalty, this\r\nmimic grandeur stepped forth as its shadowy representative, and\r\ncontinued for many generations as a memorial to posterity of the\r\nprincely magnificence with which Lostwithiel had formerly been\r\nhonoured.[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIDDENDEN MAIDS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Tenterden, February, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--I beg to enclose you a specimen of a _Biddenden cake_, and a\r\nprinted account, which you may perhaps think worth insertion in the\r\n_Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\nThe small town of Biddenden is about four miles from Tenterden, on the\r\nright of the road. It is at present populous, though the clothing\r\nmanufacture, which first occasioned the increase of the population of\r\nthis part of the county, in the reign of Edward III. when the Flemings\r\nfirst introduced it, has for many years failed here: several good\r\nhouses, still remaining, discover the prosperity of the former\r\ninhabitants. The church is a handsome regular building, and its tower a\r\nstructure of a considerable height and strength; a portion of the old\r\npart is still remaining. In this there is a free grammar school, endowed\r\nwith a good house and garden, and a salary of 20_l._ per annum. Two\r\nmaiden sisters left some land adjoining the glebe to the parish, of the\r\nrent of 20_l._ a year, which is held by the churchwardens, and\r\ndistributed in bread to the poor on Easter-day. A representation of the\r\ndonors is impressed on the leaves, and on the cakes, which were formerly\r\nthrown from the roof of the church.\r\n\r\nIn the high chancel against the north wall is a monument, with a bust in\r\nwhite marble, executed by Scheemaker, of sir John Norris, who died in\r\n1749; admiral of the British fleets, and vice-admiral of England.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

But, altogether setting aside that wood cut,\r\nthe annexed engraving is an exact representation of the baker’s impress\r\non the cake sent to the editor, and is of the exact size of the cake. A\r\nverbatim copy of the “printed account” on a half sheet of demy,\r\ncirculated at this time, is subjoined to the present engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Biddenden Cake.~]\r\n\r\nCOPY OF THE PRINTED NARRATIVE BEFORE REFERRED TO.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW AND ENLARGED ACCOUNT OF THE\r\n\r\nBIDDENDEN MAIDS IN KENT,\r\n\r\nBORN JOINED AT THE HIPS AND SHOULDERS:\r\n\r\n_With a well authenticated Account of a similar Phenomenon of Two\r\nBrothers._\r\n\r\n  On Easter Sunday in every year after Divine Service in the afternoon\r\n  at the PARISH OF BIDDENDEN, in the County of Kent, there are by the\r\n  Churchwardens, given to Strangers about 1000 Rolls, with an impression\r\n  on them similar to the Plate. The origin of this Custom is thus\r\n  related.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1100 at Biddenden, in Kent, were born ELIZABETH and MARY\r\n  CHULKHURST, _Joined together by the Hips and Shoulders, and who lived\r\n  in that state, Thirty Four Years!!_ at the expiration of which time,\r\n  one of them was taken ill and after a short period died; the surviving\r\n  one was advised to be separated from the corpse which she absolutely\r\n  refused by saying these words, “_as we came together, we will also go\r\n  together_,” and about six hours after her sister’s decease, she was\r\n  taken ill and died also. _A Stone near the Rector’s Pew marked with a\r\n  diagonal line is shewn as the place of their interment._\r\n\r\n    ~The moon on the east oriel shone, Through slender shafts of shapely\r\n      stone,\r\n    The silver light, so pale and faint, Shewed the twin sisters and\r\n      many a saint,\r\n    Whose images on the glass were dyed; Mysterious maidens side by\r\n      side.\r\n    The moon beam kissed the holy pane, And threw on the pavement a\r\n      mystic stain.~\r\n\r\n  It is further stated, that by their will, they bequeathed to the\r\n  Churchwardens of the Parish of Biddenden, and their successors,\r\n  Churchwardens for ever, certain pieces or parcels of Land in the\r\n  Parish, containing about 20 Acres, which is hired at 40 Guineas per\r\n  annum, and that in commemoration of this wonderful Phenomenon of\r\n  Nature, the Rolls and about 300 Quartern Loaves and Cheese in\r\n  proportion, should be given to the Poor Inhabitants of the Parish.\r\n\r\n  This account is entirely traditionary, the Learned Antiquarian HASTED,\r\n  in his account of the Charities of the Parish, states the Land “was\r\n  the gift of two Maidens, of the name of _Preston_: and that the print\r\n  of the women on the cakes has only been used within these 80 years,\r\n  and was made to represent two poor widows, as the general objects of a\r\n  charitable benefaction.” It is probable that the investigation of the\r\n  learned Antiquary, brought to light some record of the name of the\r\n  Ladies, for in the year 1656, the Rev. W. Horner, then Rector of the\r\n  Parish, claimed the Land, as having been given to augment his glebe,\r\n  but was non-suited in the court of Exchequer. In the pleadings\r\n  preserved in the Church, the names of the Ladies are not stated, not\r\n  being known. _There are also two other Places where such Phenomena are\r\n  said to have occurred._\r\n\r\n  If these statements weaken the credibility of the tradition, the\r\n  following account of a _Lusus Naturæ_, compiled from the London\r\n  Medical Repository, for 1821, page 138, will unquestionably confirm\r\n  the opinion of many as to the probability of the Phenomenon of the\r\n  Biddenden Maids,--Mr. Livingstone, the Surgeon of the British Factory\r\n  at Canton, relates that there was shewn at Macao, _A-ke_, a boy about\r\n  sixteen years of age, to whom was attached another Male Child, united\r\n  at the pit of the stomach by the neck, as if his head was plunged into\r\n  _Ake’s_ breast. At the time of their birth they were nearly of an\r\n  equal size, but the parasite has not much increased since that period.\r\n  The skin of _A-ke_ joins regularly and smoothly, the neck of the\r\n  parasite, so that he can turn his brother on either of his sides upon\r\n  himself, but the natural position is breast to breast; on the whole\r\n  the parasite is well formed being about two feet in length.--_A-ke_\r\n  thinks that at one period their feelings were reciprocal, but for some\r\n  time he has not perceived it except in one particular act, when his\r\n  brother never fails to do the same, he however feels the slightest\r\n  touch applied to his brother.\r\n\r\n  _A-ke_ has generally a sickly appearance, but excepting the parasite,\r\n  is well formed; about 4 feet 10 inches high; is easily fatigued in\r\n  walking or ascending a flight of steps being obliged to support his\r\n  brother with his hands. When fatigued he breathes with difficulty, and\r\n  is only relieved by laying down.\r\n\r\n  CHAMBERS AND EXALL, Printers, (_King’s Arms Printing Office_)\r\n  TENTERDEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding “account” is an enlargement of a preceding one of the same\r\nsize, on a larger type, with this imprint, “BIDDENDEN: Printed and Sold\r\nby R.

Weston’s paper does not\r\ncontain the story of “_A-ke_,” which is well calculated to make the\r\nlegend of the “Biddenden Maids,” pass current with the vulgar.\r\n\r\nOur Tenterden correspondent adds, in a subsequent letter, that, on\r\nEaster Sunday, Biddenden is completely thronged. The public houses are\r\ncrowded with people attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by\r\nthe usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent\r\nin rude festivity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo elucidate this annual custom as fully as possible, all that Mr.\r\nHasted says of the matter is here extracted:--\r\n\r\n“Twenty acres of land, called the Bread and Cheese Land, lying in five\r\npieces, were given by persons unknown, the yearly rents to be\r\ndistributed among the poor of this parish. This is yearly done on Easter\r\nSunday in the afternoon, in six hundred cakes, each of which have the\r\nfigures of two woman impressed on them, and are given to all such as\r\nattend the church; and two hundred and seventy loaves, weighing three\r\npounds and a half a piece, to which latter is added one pound and an\r\nhalf of cheese, are given, to the parishoners only, at the same time.\r\n\r\n“There is a vulgar tradition in these parts, that the figures on the\r\ncakes represent the donors of this gift, being two women, twins, who\r\nwere joined together in their bodies, and lived together so, till they\r\nwere between twenty and thirty years of age. But this seems without\r\nfoundation. The truth seems to be, that it was the gift of two maidens\r\nof the name of Preston, and that the print of the women on the cakes has\r\ntaken place only within these fifty years, and was made to represent two\r\npoor widows as the general objects of a charitable benefaction. William\r\nHorner, rector of this parish in 1656 brought a suit in the exchequer\r\nfor the recovery of these lands, as having been given for an\r\naugmentation of his glebe land, but he was nonsuited. The lands are\r\nbounded on the east by the glebe, on the south by the highway, and one\r\npiece on the north of the highway; they are altogether of the yearly\r\nvalue of about 31_l._ 10_s._”[107]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAllusion is made by the rev. Mr. Fosbroke, to a custom in the thirteenth\r\ncentury of seizing all ecclesiastics who walked abroad between Easter\r\nand Pentecost, because the apostles were seized by the Jews after\r\nChrist’s passion; and making them purchase their liberty by money.[108]\r\n\r\nMr. Brand relates, “that on Easter Sunday, is still retained at the city\r\nof Durham in the Easter holidays: on one day the men take off the\r\nwomen’s shoes, or rather buckles, which are only to be redeemed by a\r\npresent: on another day the women make reprisals, taking off the men’s\r\nin like manner.” The annexed letter shows that the practice in that city\r\nis not quite out of fashion, though buckles are.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Durham, March 3, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--To contribute towards the information you desire to convey\r\nconcerning popular customs, &c. I will describe one, much practised in\r\nDurham, which I think you have not noticed in the former volume of your\r\ninteresting work.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday it is a common custom here, for a number of boys to\r\nassemble in the afternoon, and as soon as the clock strikes four, scour\r\nthe streets in parties, and accost every female they may happen to meet,\r\nwith “pay for your shoes if you please,” at the same time, stooping to\r\ntake them off; which, if they do, and do not immediately get a penny or\r\ntwo-pence, they will actually carry off by main force. I have known the\r\nboys have, at least, a dozen odd shoes; but generally, something is\r\ngiven, which in the evening they either spend in public houses, or\r\ndivide. On Easter Monday, the women claim the same privilege towards the\r\nmale sex. They begin much earlier in the day, and attack every man and\r\nboy they can lay hold of to make them _pay for their shoes_; if the men\r\nhappen to wear boots, and will not pay any thing, the girls generally\r\nendeavour to seize their hats and run off. If a man catches the girl\r\nwith the hat, it is usually thrown or handed about to the great\r\namusement of the spectators, till the person is baffled out of a\r\nsixpence to redeem the right of wearing it again: but this, like all\r\nother old customs, has greatly fallen off lately, and is now chiefly\r\npractised by a few children.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA contributor to the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in August, 1790, says that,\r\nat Rippon, in Yorkshire, “on Easter Sunday, as soon as the service of\r\nthe church is over, the boys run about the streets, and lay hold of\r\nevery woman or girl they can, and take their buckles from their shoes.\r\nThis farce is continued till the next day at noon, when the females\r\nbegin, and return the compliment upon the men, which does not end till\r\nTuesday evening; nay, I was told that, some years ago, no traveller\r\ncould pass through the town without being stopped and having his spurs\r\ntaken away, unless redeemed by a little money, which is the only way to\r\nhave your buckles returned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pressing in Church._\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 1596, during the reign of queen\r\nElizabeth, the lord mayor and aldermen of London received the royal\r\ncommand to raise a thousand men with the utmost expedition; wherefore\r\nthey repaired with their deputies, constables, and other officers, to\r\nthe churches, and having caused the doors to be shut, took the people\r\nduring divine service from their worship, till the number was completed,\r\nand having armed them, the men, so raised and equipped, were marched the\r\nsame night for Dover, in order to their embarkation for France; but in\r\nthe mean time, Elizabeth having received advice of the reduction of\r\nCalais by the Spaniards, they were countermanded, and returned to the\r\ncity in about a week after their departure.[109]\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTER DAY CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n_At Twickenham and Paddington._\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Lysons, “There was an ancient custom at Twickenham, of\r\ndividing two great cakes in the church upon Easter-day among the young\r\npeople; but it being looked upon as a superstitious relic, it was\r\nordered by parliament, 1645, that the parishioners should forbear that\r\ncustom, and, instead thereof, buy loaves of bread for the poor of the\r\nparish with the money that should have bought the cakes. It appears that\r\nthe sum of £1. _per annum_ is still charged upon the vicarage for the\r\npurpose of buying penny loaves for poor children on the Thursday after\r\nEaster. Within the memory of man they were thrown from the\r\nchurch-steeple to be scrambled for; a custom which prevailed also, some\r\ntime ago, at Paddington, and is not yet totally abolished.” A\r\ncorrespondent imagines that the Paddington custom of throwing bread from\r\nthe church-steeple, which exists also in other parishes, was derived\r\nfrom largesses bestowed on the poor by the Romish clergy on occasion of\r\nthe festival, and that it has been continued since the Reformation, and,\r\ntherefore, since the institution of poor rates, without due regard to\r\nits original object.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biddenden Custom._\r\n\r\nSince the former sheet was printed, an article occurs to the editor in\r\nthe “Gentleman’s Magazine,” which it seems proper to notice. The writer\r\nthere states, that “Biddenden is a parish of great extent, as most\r\nparishes in the _weald_ of Kent are;” that this part of the country is\r\ncalled the _weald_, “from the growth of large timber, oak particularly;”\r\nthat the town of Biddenden is about five miles equi-distant from three\r\nseveral market towns, Cranbrook, Smarden, and Tenterden; and is distant\r\nabout fifteen miles from Maidstone. On the same authority, is now added\r\nthat it does not furnish any antique inscriptions, nor does the weald in\r\ngeneral yield the inquirer any thing antique or invaluable to repay his\r\nsearch. In the reign of queen Elizabeth, John Mayne, esq. endowed a good\r\nhouse and garden with 20_l._ per annum, for a free grammar school, which\r\nowing to the salary being fixed at that amount by the founder, is\r\nneither eligible to persons qualified under the regulations, nor is it\r\ncapable of being increased. The visitation of the school, was formerly\r\nin the archbishop of Canterbury, but is so no longer, and the\r\nschoolmaster is appointed by the lord. The archbishop is patron of the\r\nrectory, which, in the reign of Henry VIII., was valued so high as\r\n35_l._ The fair here is on the 8th of November. Mr. Urban’s\r\ncorrespondent noticing “the two maided-sisters who grew together from\r\nthe waist downwards,” refers to accounts of similar wonders, and\r\nwaggishly ends his list by directing to the “Memoirs of Scriblerus, by\r\nA. Pope,” as an authority corroborative of the apocryphal “Biddenden\r\nMaids.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTE EGGS.\r\n\r\nA correspondent, T. A., mentions this custom in Cheshire: “Children go\r\nround the village and beg eggs for their Easter dinner; they accompany\r\nit by a short song, which I am sorry I am unable to present to you, but\r\nthe burthen of it is addressed to the farmer’s dame, and asking ‘an egg,\r\nbacon, cheese, or an apple, or any good thing that will make us merry,’\r\nends with\r\n\r\n    ‘And I pray you, good dame, an Easter egg.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Cumberland and Westmorland, and other parts of the north of England,\r\nboys beg, on Easter eve, eggs to play with, and beggars ask for them to\r\neat. These eggs are hardened by boiling, and tinged with the juice of\r\nherbs, broom-flowers, &c. The eggs being thus prepared, the boys go out\r\nand play with them in the fields; rolling them up and down, like bowls,\r\nupon the ground, or throwing them up, like balls, into the air.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR CUPPING\r\n\r\nIn the Peak of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Tideswell, Derbyshire, March 31, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The pleasure and instruction I have derived from the perusal of\r\nyour interesting miscellany, induce me to offer to your notice a custom\r\nin this neighbourhood denominated _Sugar-cupping_, which, like similar\r\nremnants of the “olden time,” is gradually running into disuse.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday, being Easter-day, I walked to the “Dropping Tor,” the\r\nrendezvous of the “sugar-cuppers,” but, owing to the extreme inclemency\r\nof the weather, no one was there, nor was it, I believe, once visited\r\nduring the day. From frequent inquiry of the oldest persons in the\r\nneighbourhood, I can learn nothing but that, on Easter Sunday, they were\r\nused, when children, to go to the “Dropping Tor,” with a cup in one\r\npocket and a quarter of a pound of sugar in the other, and having caught\r\nin their cups as much water as was desired from the droppings of the\r\nspring, they dissolved the sugar in it, and drank it. The natural\r\nconsequences resulting from the congregation of a quantity of “young men\r\nand maidens” followed, and they returned home. I was anxious to discover\r\nsome jargon repeated by the youthful pilgrims, as an invocation to the\r\nsaint of the spring, or otherwise; but I could not collect any thing of\r\nthe kind. I conjecture this custom to be peculiar to this part. If you,\r\nor any of your correspondents, can furnish more satisfactory information\r\nrespecting it, some of your readers will not regret I have troubled you\r\nwith the hint.\r\n\r\n  With respect, I am,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  A PEAKRIL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFurther notice of this usage at “the Peak,” will be acceptable to the\r\neditor, who is neither acquainted with the practice nor its origin. At\r\nsome _wells_ it is customary, on certain days, for persons to strew\r\nflowers, or hang garlands on the brink. Accounts of this nature,\r\nespecially if accompanied by a drawing of the place, are very desirable.\r\nWe have hitherto had no water customs, yet springs were very early\r\nobjects of veneration. These remains of ancient respect will be duly\r\nrespected when communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTER DAY AT ROME.\r\n\r\nOn this day the pope himself goes in grand procession to the cathedral\r\nof St. Peter, and assists at the high mass. The church is lined with the\r\n_guarda nobile_, in their splendid uniforms of gold and scarlet, and\r\nnodding plumes of white ostrich feathers, and the Swiss guards, with\r\ntheir polished cuirasses and steel helmets. The great centre aisle is\r\nkept clear by a double wall of armed men, for the grand procession, the\r\napproach of which is proclaimed by the sound of trumpet from the farther\r\nend of the church. Priests advance, loaded with still augmenting\r\nmagnificence, as they ascend to the higher orders. Cloth of gold, and\r\nembroidery of gold and silver, and crimson velvet, and mantles of\r\nspotted ermine, and flowing trains, and attendant train-bearers, and\r\nmitres and crucifixes glittering with jewels, and priests and\r\npatriarchs, and bishops and cardinals, dazzle the eye, and fill the\r\nwhole length of St. Peter’s. Lastly, comes the pope, in his crimson\r\nchair of state, borne on the shoulders of twenty _palfrenieri_, arrayed\r\nin robes of white, and wearing the tiara, or triple crown of the\r\nconjoined Trinity, with a canopy of cloth of silver floating over his\r\nhead; preceded by two men, carrying enormous fans, composed of large\r\nplumes of ostrich feathers, mounted on long gilded wands. He stops to\r\npay his adorations to the miraculous Madonna in her chapel, about\r\nhalf-way up; and this duty, which he never omits, being performed, he is\r\nslowly borne past the high altar, liberally giving his benediction with\r\nthe twirl of the three fingers as he passes.\r\n\r\nHe is then set down upon a magnificent stool, in front of the altar, on\r\nwhich he kneels, and his crown being taken off, and the cardinals taking\r\noff their little red caps, and all kneeling in a row, he assumes the\r\nattitude of praying. Having remained a few minutes, he is taken to a\r\nchair prepared for him, to the right of the throne. There he reads from\r\na book, and is again taken to the altar, on which his tiara has been\r\nplaced; and, bareheaded, he repeats--or as, by courtesy, it is called,\r\nsings--a small part of the service, throws up clouds of incense, and is\r\nremoved to the crimson-canopied throne. High mass is celebrated by a\r\ncardinal and two bishops, at which he assists. During the service, the\r\nItalians seem to consider it quite as much of a pageant as foreigners,\r\nbut neither a new nor an interesting one; they either walk about, and\r\ntalk, or interchange pinches of snuff with each other, exactly as if it\r\nhad been a place of amusement, until the tinkling of a little bell,\r\nwhich announces the elevation of the host, changes the scene. Every knee\r\nis now bent to the earth, and every voice hushed; the reversed arms of\r\nthe military ring with an instantaneous clang on the marble pavement, as\r\nthey sink on the ground, and all is still as death. This does not last\r\nabove two minutes till the host is swallowed. Thus begins and ends the\r\nonly part that bears even the smallest outward aspect of religion. The\r\nmilitary now pour out of St. Peter’s, and form an extensive ring before\r\nits spacious front, behind which the horse guards are drawn up, and an\r\nimmense number of carriages, filled with splendidly dressed women, and\r\nthousands of people on foot, are assembled. Yet the multitude almost\r\nshrunk into insignificance in the vast area of the piazza; and neither\r\npiety nor curiosity collect sufficient numbers to fill it. The tops of\r\nthe colonnades all round, however, are thronged with spectators; and it\r\nis a curious sight to see a mixture of all ranks and nations,--from the\r\ncoronetted heads of kings, to the poor cripple who crawls along the\r\npavement,--assembled together to await the blessing of their fellow\r\nmortal. Not the least picturesque figures among the throng are the\r\n_contadini_, who, in every variety of curious costume, flock in from\r\ntheir distant mountain villages, to receive the blessing of the holy\r\nfather, and whose bright and eager countenances, shaded by their long\r\ndark hair, turn to the balcony where the pope is to appear. At length\r\nthe two white ostrich-feather fans, the forerunners of his approach, are\r\nseen; and he is borne forward on his throne, above the shoulders of the\r\ncardinals and bishops, who fill the balcony. After an audible prayer he\r\narises, and, elevating his hands to heaven, invokes a solemn benediction\r\nupon the multitude, and the people committed to his charge. Every head\r\nuncovers; the soldiers, and many of the spectators, kneel on the\r\npavement to receive the blessing. It is given with impressive\r\nsolemnity, but with little of gesture or parade. Immediately the\r\nthundering of cannon from the castle of St. Angelo, and the peal of\r\nbells from St. Peter’s, proclaim the joyful tidings to the skies. The\r\npope is borne out, and the people rise from their knees.[111]\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEK EASTER.\r\n\r\nThe “Picture of Greece in 1825,” by Messrs. Emerson and Humphreys, and\r\ncount Pecchio, contains some particulars of the celebration of the Greek\r\nchurch. They say,\r\n\r\n“To-day being the festival of Easter, Napoli presented a novel\r\nappearance, viz. a clean one. This feast as the most important in the\r\nGreek church, is observed with particular rejoicings and respect. Lent\r\nhaving ceased, the ovens were crowded with the preparations for\r\nbanquetting. Yesterday every street was reeking with the blood of lambs\r\nand goats; and to-day, every house was fragrant with odours of pies and\r\nbaked meats; all the inhabitants, in festival array, were hurrying along\r\nto pay their visits and receive their congratulations; every one, as he\r\nmet his friend, saluted him with a kiss on each side of his face, and\r\nrepeated the words Χριστος ανεστη--‘Christ is risen.’ The day was spent\r\nin rejoicings in every quarter; the guns were fired from the batteries,\r\nand every moment the echoes of the Palamede were replying to the\r\nincessant reports of the pistols and trophaics of the soldiery. On these\r\noccasions, the Greeks (whether from laziness to extract the ball, or for\r\nthe purpose of making a louder report, I know not,) always discharge\r\ntheir arms with a bullet: frequent accidents are the consequence.\r\nTo-day, one poor fellow was shot dead in his window, and a second\r\nseverely wounded by one of these random shots. In the evening, a grand\r\nceremony took place in the square: all the members of the government,\r\nafter attending divine service in the church of St. George, met opposite\r\nthe residence of the executive body; the legislative being the most\r\nnumerous, took their places in a line, and the executive passing along\r\nthem from right to left, kissing commenced with great vigour, the latter\r\nbody embracing the former with all fervour and affection. Amongst such\r\nan intriguing factious senate as the Greek legislation, it requires\r\nlittle calculation to discern that the greater portion of these\r\nsalutations were Judas’s kisses.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKISH EASTER.\r\n\r\nThe journals of 1824, contain the following extract, from a private\r\nletter, dated Tangiers, in Africa:--“The day after my arrival I was\r\npresent at the celebration of this country’s Easter, a religious\r\nceremony which greatly resembles our Easter, and is so called.--At break\r\nof day, twenty salutes of cannon announce the festival. At this signal,\r\nthe pacha proceeds to a great plain ranged outside the city, where he is\r\nreceived by all the troops of the garrison, ranged under arms. An\r\nunfortunate ram is laid upon an altar there; the pacha approaches it,\r\nand plunges a knife into its throat; a Jew then seizes the bleeding\r\nanimal, hoists it on his shoulders, and runs off with it to the mosque.\r\nIf the animal still lives at the moment he arrives there, which very\r\nseldom fails to occur, the year will be a good one: if the contrary\r\nhappens, great lamentations and groanings are made--the year will be\r\nbad. As soon as the victim is dead, a great carnage begins. Every Moor\r\nsacrifices, according to his means, one or more sheep, and this in the\r\nopen street; the blood streams down on all sides; men and women imbrue\r\nthemselves in it as much as they please; they cry, sing, dance, and\r\nendeavour to manifest the joy that animates them in a thousand forms. As\r\nsoon as night appears, the town resounds with discharges of musketry,\r\nand it is not till the end of eight days that this charming festival\r\nconcludes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHECY CONCERNING EASTER.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the flood of information which has been poured over the\r\ncountry during the last half century, superstition, at once the child\r\nand mother of ignorance, still holds no inconsiderable sway over the\r\nminds of men. It is true, that the days of ghosts and apparitions are\r\nnearly over, but futurity is as tempting as ever, and the seventh son of\r\na seventh son is still potent enough to charm away the money and\r\nbewilder the senses of the credulous, and Nixon’s and Mother Shipton’s\r\nprophecies still find believers. The coincidences by which these\r\nlegendary predictions are sometimes fulfilled, are often curious. The\r\npresent year may be said to witness the accomplishment of one. It has\r\nbeen said--\r\n\r\n    When _my Lord_ falls in _my Lady’s_ lap,\r\n    England beware of some mishap.\r\n\r\nMeaning thereby, that when the festival of _Easter_ falls near to\r\n_Lady-day_, (the 25th of March,) this country is threatened with some\r\ncalamity. In the year 1818, Easter-day happened on the 22d of March, and\r\nin the November of that year, queen Charlotte died. In 1826, Easter-day\r\nhappening on the 26th of March, distress in the commercial world may be\r\nregarded as a fulfilment of the prediction. Spanish history affords a\r\ncurious instance of this kind. It is related, that Peter and John de\r\nCarvajal, who were condemned for murder, (A. D. 1312,) on circumstantial\r\nevidence, and that very frivolous, to be thrown from the summit of a\r\nrock, Ferdinand IV., then king of Spain, could by no means be prevailed\r\nupon to grant their pardon. As they were leading to execution, they\r\ninvoked God to witness their innocence, and appealed to his tribunal, to\r\nwhich they summoned the king to appear in thirty days’ time. He laughed\r\nat the summons; nevertheless, some days after, he fell sick, and went to\r\na place called Alcaudet to divert himself and recover his health, and\r\nshake off the remembrance of the summons if he could. Accordingly, the\r\nthirtieth day being come, he found himself much better, and after\r\nshowing a great deal of mirth and cheerfulness on that occasion with his\r\ncourtiers, and ridiculing the illusion, retired to rest, but was found\r\ndead in his bed the next morning. (See Turquet’s general History of\r\nSpain 1612, p. 458, cited in Dr. Grey’s notes to Hudibras, part iii.\r\ncanto 1. lines 209, 210.)\r\n\r\nThe same author (Dr. Grey,) quotes from Dr. James Young, (Sidrophel\r\nvapulans, p. 29,) that Cardan, a celebrated astrologer lost his life to\r\nsave his credit; for having predicted the time of his own death, he\r\nstarved himself to verify it: or else being sure of his art, he took\r\nthis to be his fatal day, and by those apprehensions made it so. The\r\nprophecy of George Wishart, the Scottish martyr, respecting the death of\r\ncardinal Beatoun, is a striking feature in a catalogue of coincidences.\r\nIn such light may be cited the stories of the predicted death of the\r\nduke of Buckingham, in the time of Charles I., that of lord Lyttleton in\r\nlater days, and many others.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon, who, on many points illuminated the sixteenth with the light\r\nof the nineteenth century, after referring in his chapter on prophecies\r\n(see his Essays) to the fulfilment of many remarkable fulfilments,\r\ndelivers his opinion on that point in the following words:--“My judgment\r\nis, that they ought all to be despised, and ought to serve but for\r\nwinter talk by the fireside. Though when I say despised, I mean for\r\nbelief.----That that hath given them grace, and some credit consisteth\r\nin these things. 1st. that men mark when they hit, and never when they\r\nmiss; as they do, also of dreams. 2d. that probable conjectures and\r\nobscure traditions many times turn themselves into prophecies: while the\r\nnature of man which coveteth divination, thinks it no peril to foretell\r\nthat, which indeed they do but collect.----The 3d. and last (which is\r\nthe great one) is, that almost all them, being infinite in number, have\r\nbeen impostures, and by idle and crafty brains, merely contrived and\r\nfeigned after the event passed.”\r\n\r\n  J.

It fell on that day in 1818, and cannot happen on that\r\nday till the year 2285.\r\n\r\nThe _latest possible_ day whereon Easter can happen, is the 25th of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nWe can have no squabble this year concerning the _true time_ of Easter.\r\nThe result of the papers on that subject in the first volume of your\r\nexcellent publication, vindicated the time fixed for its celebration, in\r\nthis country, upon those principles which infallibly regulate the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn common with all I am acquainted with, who have the pleasure of being\r\nacquainted with your _Every-Day Book_, I wish you and your work the\r\nlargest possible success. I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  ALPHA.\r\n\r\nP.S.

The journeyman who works on Easter Monday\r\nshould lose his _caste_, and be sent to the Coventry of mechanics,\r\nwherever that may be. In fact, it cannot happen. On Easter Monday ranks\r\nchange places; Jobson is as good as sir John; the “rude mechanical” is\r\n“monarch of all he surveys” from the summit of Greenwich-hill, and when\r\nhe thinks fit to say “it is our royal pleasure to be drunk!” who shall\r\ndispute the proposition? Not I, for one. When our English mechanics\r\naccuse their betters of oppressing them, the said betters should reverse\r\nthe old appeal, and refer from Philip sober to Philip drunk; and then\r\nnothing more could be said. But now, they _have_ no betters, even in\r\ntheir own notion of the matter. And in the name of all that is\r\ntransitory, envy them not their brief supremacy! It will be over before\r\nthe end of the week, and they will be as eager to return to their labour\r\nas they now are to escape from it; for the only thing that an\r\nEnglishman, whether high or low, cannot endure patiently for a week\r\ntogether, is, unmingled amusement. At this time, however, he is\r\ndetermined to try. Accordingly, on Easter Monday all the narrow lanes\r\nand blind alleys of our metropolis pour forth their dingy denizens into\r\nthe suburban fields and villages, in search of the said amusement, which\r\nis plentifully provided for them by another class, even less enviable\r\nthan the one on whose patronage they depend; for of all callings, the\r\nmost melancholy is that of purveyor of pleasure to the poor.\r\n\r\nDuring the Monday our determined holiday-maker, as in duty bound,\r\ncontrives, by the aid of a little or not a little artificial stimulus,\r\nto be happy in a tolerably exemplary manner. On the Tuesday, he\r\n_fancies_ himself happy to-day, because he _felt_ himself so yesterday.\r\nOn the Wednesday he cannot tell what has come to him, but every ten\r\nminutes he wishes himself at home, where he never goes but to sleep. On\r\nThursday he finds out the secret, that he is heartily sick of doing\r\nnothing; but is ashamed to confess it; and then what is the use of going\r\nto work before his money is spent? On Friday he swears that he is a fool\r\nfor throwing away the greatest part of his quarter’s savings without\r\nhaving any thing to show for it, and gets gloriously drunk with the rest\r\nto prove his words; passing the pleasantest night of all the week in a\r\nwatchhouse. And on Saturday, after thanking “his worship” for his good\r\nadvice, of which he does not remember a word, he comes to the wise\r\ndetermination, that, after all, there is nothing like working all day\r\nlong in silence, and at night spending his earnings and his breath in\r\nbeer and politics! So much for the Easter week of a London\r\nholiday-maker.\r\n\r\nBut there is a sport belonging to Easter Monday which is not\r\nconfined to the lower classes, and which fun forbid that I should\r\npass over silently. If the reader has not, during his boyhood,\r\nperformed the exploit of riding to the turn-out of the stag on\r\nEpping-forest--following the hounds all day long at a respectful\r\ndistance--returning home in the evening with the loss of nothing but his\r\nhat, his hunting whip, and his horse, not to mention a portion of his\r\nnether person--and finishing the day by joining the lady mayoress’s ball\r\nat the Mansion-house; if the reader has not done all this when a boy, I\r\nwill not tantalize him by expatiating on the superiority of those who\r\nhave. And if he _has_ done it, I need not tell him that he has no cause\r\nto envy his friend who escaped with a flesh wound from the fight of\r\nWaterloo; for there is not a pin to choose between them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPPING HUNT.\r\n\r\nIn 1226, king Henry III. confirmed to the citizens of London, _free\r\nwarren_, or liberty to hunt a circuit about their city, in the warren of\r\nStaines, &c.; and in ancient times the lord mayor, aldermen, and\r\ncorporation, attended by a due number of their constituents, availed\r\nthemselves of this right of chace “in solemn guise.” From newspaper\r\nreports, it appears that the office of “common hunt,” attached to the\r\nmayoralty, is in danger of desuetude. The Epping hunt seems to have lost\r\nthe lord mayor and his brethren in their corporate capacity, and the\r\nannual sport to have become a farcical show.\r\n\r\nA description of the Epping hunt of Easter Monday, 1826, by one “Simon\r\nYoungbuck,” in the _Morning Herald_, is the latest report, if it be not\r\nthe truest; but of that the editor of the _Every-Day Book_ cannot judge,\r\nfor he was not there to see: he contents himself with picking out the\r\npoints; should any one be dissatisfied with the “hunting of that day,”\r\nas it will be here presented, he has only to sit down, in good earnest,\r\nto a plain matter-of-fact detail of all the circumstances from his own\r\nknowledge, accompanied by such citations as will show the origin and\r\nformer state of the usage, and such a detail, so accompanied, will be\r\ninserted--\r\n\r\n    “For want of a better _this_ must do.”\r\n\r\nOn the authority aforesaid, and that, without the introduction of any\r\nterm not in the _Herald_, be it known then, that before, and at the\r\ncommencement of the hunt aforesaid, it was a cold, dry, and dusty\r\nmorning, and that the huntsmen of the east were all abroad by nine\r\no’clock, trotting, fair and softly, down the road, on great nine-hand\r\nskyscrapers, nimble daisy-cutting nags, flowing-tailed chargers, and\r\nponies no bigger than the learned one at Astley’s; some were in\r\njob-coaches, at two guineas a-day; some in three-bodied nondescripts,\r\nsome in gigs, some in cabs, some in drags, some in short stages, and\r\nsome in long stages; while some on no stages at all, footed the road,\r\nsmothered by dust driven by a black, bleak north-easter full in the\r\nteeth. Every gentleman was arrayed after his own particular taste, in\r\nblue, brown, or black--in dress-coats, long coats, short coats, frock\r\ncoats, great coats, and no-coats;--in drab-slacks and slippers;--in\r\ngray-tights, and black-spurred Wellingtons;--in nankeen\r\nbomb-balloons;--in city-white cotton-cord unmentionables, with jockey\r\ntoppers, and in Russian-drill down-belows, as a _memento_ of the late\r\nczar. The ladies all wore a _goose-skin_ under-dress, in compliment to\r\nthe north-easter.\r\n\r\nAt that far-famed spot, the brow above Fairmead bottom, by twelve\r\no’clock, there were not less than three thousand merry lieges then and\r\nthere assembled. It was a beautiful set-out. Fair dames “in purple and\r\nin pall,” reposed in vehicles of all sorts, sizes, and conditions,\r\nwhilst seven or eight hundred mounted members of the hunt wound in and\r\nout “in restless ecstasy,” chatting and laughing with the fair,\r\nsometimes rising in their stirrups to look out for the long-coming cart\r\nof the stag, “whilst, with off heel assiduously aside,” they “provoked\r\nthe caper which they seemed to hide.” The green-sward was covered with\r\never-moving crowds on foot, and the pollard oaks which skirt the bottom\r\non either side were filled with men and boys.\r\n\r\nBut where the deuce is the stag all this while? One o’clock, and no\r\nstag. _Two_ o’clock, and no stag!--a circumstance easily accounted for\r\nby those who are in the secret, and the secret is this. There are\r\nbuttocks of boiled beef and fat hams, and beer and brandy in abundance,\r\nat the Roebuck public-house low down in the forest; and ditto at the\r\nBaldfaced Stag, on the top of the hill; and ditto at the Coach and\r\nHorses, at Woodford Wells; and ditto at the Castle, at Woodford; and\r\nditto at the Eagle, at Snaresbrook; and if the stag had been brought out\r\nbefore the beef, beer, bacon, and brandy, were eaten and drank, where\r\nwould have been the use of providing so many good things? So they carted\r\nthe stag from public-house to public-house, and showed him at threepence\r\na head to those ladies and gentlemen who never saw such a thing before,\r\nand the showing and carting induced a consumption of eatables and\r\ndrinkables, an achievement which was helped by a band of music in every\r\nhouse, playing hungry tunes to help the appetite; and then, when the\r\neatables and drinkables were gone, and paid for, they turned out the\r\nstag.\r\n\r\nPrecisely at half-past two o’clock, the stag-cart was seen coming over\r\nthe hill by the Baldfaced Stag, and hundreds of horsemen and gig-men\r\nrushed gallantly forward to meet and escort it to the top of Fairmead\r\nbottom, amidst such whooping and hallooing, as made all the forest echo\r\nagain; and would have done Carl Maria Von Weber’s heart good to hear.\r\nAnd then, when the cart stopped and was turned tail about, the horsemen\r\ndrew up in long lines, forming an avenue wide enough for the stag to run\r\ndown. For a moment, all was deep, silent, breathless anxiety; and the\r\ndoors of the cart were thrown open, and out popped a strapping\r\nfour-year-old red buck, fat as a porker, with a chaplet of flowers round\r\nhis neck, a girth of divers coloured ribbons, and a long blue and pink\r\nstreamer depending from the summit of his branching horns. He was\r\nreceived, on his alighting, with a shout that seemed to shake heaven’s\r\nconcave, and took it very graciously, looking round him with great\r\ndignity as he stalked slowly and delicately forward, down the avenue\r\nprepared for him; and occasionally shrinking from side to side, as some\r\nsupervalorous cockney made a cut at him with his whip. Presently, he\r\ncaught a glimpse of the hounds and the huntsmen, waiting for him at the\r\nbottom, and in an instant off he bounded, sideways, through the rank,\r\nknocking down and trampling all who crowded the path he chose to take;\r\nand dashing at once into the cover, he was out of sight before a man\r\ncould say “Jack Robinson!” Then might be seen, gentlemen running about\r\nwithout their horses, and horses galloping about without their\r\ngentlemen; and hats out of number brushed off their owners’ heads by the\r\nrude branches of the trees; and every body asking which way the stag was\r\ngone, and nobody knowing any thing about him; and ladies beseeching\r\ngentlemen not to be too venturesome; and gentlemen gasping for breath\r\nat the thoughts of what they were determined to venture; and myriads of\r\npeople on foot running hither and thither in search of little eminences\r\nto look from; and yet nothing at all to be seen, though more than enough\r\nto be heard; for every man, and every woman too, made as loud a noise as\r\npossible. Meanwhile the stag, followed by the keepers and about six\r\ncouple of hounds, took away through the covers towards Woodford.\r\nFinding himself too near the haunts of his enemy, man, he there turned\r\nback, sweeping down the bottom for a mile or two, and away up the\r\nenclosures towards Chingford; where he was caught nobody knows how, for\r\nevery body returned to town, except those who stopped to regale afresh,\r\nand recount the glorious perils of the day. Thus ended the _Easter Hunt_\r\nof 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Minerva.~\r\n\r\n_From a Chrysolite possessed by Lord Montague._]\r\n\r\nThe Minervalia was a Roman festival in March, commencing on the 19th of\r\nthe month, and lasting for five days. The first day was spent in\r\ndevotions to the goddess; the rest in offering sacrifices, seeing the\r\ngladiators fight, acting tragedies, and reciting witticisms for prizes.\r\nIt conferred a vacation on scholars who now, carried schooling money, or\r\npresents, called Minerval, to their masters.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cicero there were five Minervas.\r\n\r\n1. Minerva, the mother of Apollo.\r\n\r\n2. Minerva, the offspring of the Nile, of whom there was a statue with\r\nthis inscription:--“I am all that was, is, and is to come; and my veil\r\nno mortal hath yet removed.”\r\n\r\n3. Minerva, who sprung armed from Jupiter’s brain.\r\n\r\n4. Minerva, the daughter of Jupiter and Corypha, whose father Oceanus\r\ninvented four-wheeled chariots.\r\n\r\n5. Minerva, the daughter of Pallantis, who fled from her father, and is,\r\ntherefore, represented with wings on her feet, in the same manner as\r\nMercury.\r\n\r\nThe second Minerva, of Egypt, is imagined to have been the most ancient.\r\nThe Phœnicians also had a Minerva, the daughter of Saturn, and the\r\ninventress of arts and arms. From one of these two, the Greeks derived\r\ntheir Minerva.\r\n\r\nMinerva was worshipped by the Athenians before the age of Cecrops, in\r\nwhose time Athens was founded, and its name taken from Minerva, whom the\r\nGreek called Ἁθηνη. It was proposed to call the city either by her name\r\nor that of Neptune, and as each had partizans, and the women had votes\r\nequal to the men, Cecrops called all the citizens together both men and\r\nwomen; the suffrages were collected; and it was found that all the women\r\nhad voted for Minerva, and all the men for Neptune; but the women\r\nexceeding the men by one voice, Athens was called after Minerva. A\r\ntemple was dedicated to her in the city, with her statue in gold and\r\nivory, thirty-nine feet high, executed by Phydias.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Life is darken’d o’er with woe.”--_Der Freischütz._\r\n\r\n~Mr. Matthews at Home, 1826.~]\r\n\r\nIt would be as difficult for most persons, who think Mr. Matthews acts\r\neasily, to act as he does, as it would be difficult to make such persons\r\ncomprehend, that his ease is the result of labour, and that his present\r\nperformance is the result of greater labour than his exhibitions of\r\nformer years. An examination of the process by which he has attained the\r\nextraordinary ability to “_command_ success,” would be a fatiguing\r\ninquiry to most readers, though a very curious one to some. He has been\r\ncalled a “mimic;” this is derogation from his real powers, which not\r\nonly can represent the face, but penetrate the intellect. An expert\r\nswimmer is not always a successful diver: Mr. Matthews is both. His\r\nfaculty of observation “surpasses show.” He leaves the features he\r\ncontemplates, enters into the mind, becomes joint tenant of its\r\nhereditaments and appurtenances with the owner, and describes its secret\r\nchambers and closets. This faculty obtained lord Chesterfield his fame,\r\nand enabled him to persuade the judgment; but he never succeeded by his\r\nvoice or pen in raising the passions, like Mr. Matthews, who, in that\r\nrespect, is above the nobleman. The cause of this superiority is, that\r\nMr. Matthews is the creature of feeling--of excitation and depression.\r\nThis assertion is made without the slightest personal knowledge or even\r\nsight of him off the stage; it is grounded on a generalized view of some\r\npoints in human nature. If Mr. Matthews were not the slave of\r\ntemperament, he never could have pictured the Frenchman at the Post\r\nOffice, nor the gaming Yorkshireman. These are prominences seized by his\r\nwhole audience, on whom, however, his most delicate touches of character\r\nare lost. His high finish of the Irish beggar woman with her “poor\r\nchild,” was never detected by the laughers at their trading duett of\r\n“Sweet Home!” The exquisite pathos of the _crathur’s_ story was lost. To\r\nplease a large assemblage the points must be broad. Mr. Matthews’s\r\ncountenance of his host drawing the cork is an excellence that discovers\r\nitself, and the entire affair of the dinner is “pleasure made easy” to\r\nthe meanest capacity. The spouting child who sings the “Bacchanal Song”\r\nin “Der Freischütz” from whence the engraving is taken, is another\r\n“palpable hit,” but amazingly increased in force to some of the many who\r\nheard it sung by Phillips. The “tipsy toss” of that actor’s head, his\r\nrollocking look, his stamps in its chorus, and the altogetherness of his\r\nstyle in that single song, were worth the entirety of the drama--yet he\r\nwas seldom encored. To conclude with Mr. Matthews, it is merely\r\nrequisite to affirm that his “At Home” in the year 1826, evinces rarer\r\ntalent than the merit of a higher order which he unquestionably\r\npossesses. He is an adept at adaptation beyond compeer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLESHILL CUSTOM.\r\n\r\nThey have an ancient custom at Coleshill, in the county of Warwick, that\r\nif the young men of the town can catch a hare, and bring it to the\r\nparson of the parish before ten o’clock on Easter Monday, the parson is\r\nbound to give them a calve’s head, and a hundred eggs for their\r\nbreakfast, and a groat in money.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nRIDING THE BLACK LAD.\r\n\r\nAn account of an ancient usage still maintained under this name at\r\nAshton-under-Lyne, will be found in the annexed letter.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Ashton-under-Lyne, March, 1826._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\nA singular custom prevails at this town on Easter Monday. Every year on\r\nthat day a rude figure of a man made of an old suit of clothes stuffed\r\nwith rags, hay, &c. is carried on a horse through all the streets. The\r\npeople who attend it call at every public-house, for the purpose of\r\nbegging liquor for its thirsty attendants, who are always numerous.\r\nDuring its progress the figure is shot at from all parts. When the\r\njourney is finished, it is tied to the market cross, and the shooting is\r\ncontinued till it is set on fire, and falls to the ground. The populace\r\nthen commence tearing the effigy in pieces, trampling it in mud and\r\nwater, and throwing it in every direction. This riot and confusion are\r\nincreased by help of a reservoir of water being let off, which runs down\r\nthe streets, and not unfrequently persons obtain large quantities of\r\nhay, rags, &c. independent of that which falls from the effigy. The\r\ngreatest heroes at this time are of the coarsest nature.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this custom is of so ancient a nature that it admits of no\r\nreal explanation: some assert that it is intended as a mark of respect\r\nto an ancient family--others deem it a disrespect. Dr. Hibbert considers\r\nit to have the same meaning as the gool-riding in Scotland, established\r\nfor the purpose of exterminating weed from corn, on pain of forfeiting a\r\nwether sheep for every stock of gool found growing in a farmer’s corn.\r\nGool is the yellow flower called the corn Marygold.\r\n\r\nIt is further supposed, that this custom originated with one of the\r\nAssheton’s, who possessed a considerable landed property in this part of\r\nLancashire. He was vice-chancellor to Henry VI., who exercised great\r\nseverity on his own lands, and established the gool or guld riding. He\r\nis said to have made his appearance on Easter Monday, clad in black\r\narmour, and on horseback, followed by a numerous train for the purpose\r\nof claiming the penalties arising from the neglect of farmers clearing\r\ntheir corn of the “carr gulds.” The tenants looked upon this visit with\r\nhorror, and tradition has still perpetuated the prayer that was offered\r\nfor a deliverance from his power:--\r\n\r\n    “Sweet Jesu, for thy mercy’s sake,\r\n      And for thy bitter passion;\r\n    Save us from the axe of the Tower,\r\n      And from Sir Ralph of Assheton.”\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that, on one of his visits on Easter Monday, he was shot\r\nas he was riding down the principal street, and that the tenants took no\r\ntrouble to find out the murderer, but entered into a subscription, the\r\ninterest of which was to make an effigy of disgrace to his memory. At\r\nthe present day, however, the origin is never thought of. The money is\r\nnow derived from publicans whose interest it is to keep up the custom.\r\nAn old steel helmet was used some years ago, but it is now no more; a\r\ntin one is used instead.\r\n\r\nThis custom is applied to another purpose. The occupation of the last\r\ncouple married in the old year are represented on the effigy. If a\r\ntailor, the shears hang dangling by his side; if a draper, the cloth\r\nyard, and so on. The effigy then at the usual time visits the happy\r\ncouple’s door, and unless the bearers are fed in a handsome manner, the\r\ndividing gentlemen are not easily got rid of. Some authors state that it\r\nis the first couple in the new year; but this is incorrect, as there is\r\nalways great pressing for marrying on new year’s day, in order to be\r\nsufficiently early in the year.\r\n\r\nSuch is the custom of _Blake Lad Monday_--or _Riding the Black Lad_, a\r\ncustom which thousands annually witness, and numbers come from great\r\ndistances to see. It is the most thronged, and the most foolish, day the\r\nAshtonians can boast of.\r\n\r\n  C. C.----G. M. R. C. S. E.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is observed by the historian of “Manchester and Salford,” that the\r\nmost prevalent of several traditions, as to the origin of this custom,\r\nis, that it is kept up to perpetuate the disgraceful actions of sir\r\nRalph Ashton, who in the year 1483, as vice-constable of the kingdom,\r\nexercised great severity in this part of the country. From a sum issued\r\nout of the court to defray the expense of the effigy, and from a suit of\r\narmour, which till of late it usually rode in, together with other\r\ntraditional particulars, there is another account of the custom.\r\nAccording to this, in the reign of Edward III., at the battle of\r\nNeville’s Cross, near Durham, his queen, with the earl of Northumberland\r\nas general, gained a complete victory over the Scots, under David, king\r\nof Scotland, and in this battle one Thomas Ashton of Ashton-under-Lyne,\r\nof whom no other particulars are known, served in the queen’s army, rode\r\nthrough the ranks of the enemy, and bore away the royal standard from\r\nthe Scottish king’s tent. For this act of heroism, Edward III. knighted\r\nhim; he became sir Thomas Ashton, of Ashton-under-Lyne; and to\r\ncommemorate his valour, he instituted the custom above described, and\r\nleft ten shillings yearly (since reduced to five) to support it, with\r\nhis own suit of black velvet, and a coat of mail, the helmet of which\r\nyet remains.”[113] It will be observed in our correspondent’s account,\r\nthat the helmet has at last disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n“OLD VINEGAR,”\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n“_Hard Metal Spoons_.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Conway, who cried “hard metal spoons to sell or change,” is\r\nmentioned by Mr. J. T. Smith, as “a man whose cry is well-known to the\r\ninhabitants of London and its environs;” but since Mr. Smith wrote, the\r\n“cry” of Conway has ceased from the metropolis, and from the remembrance\r\nof all, save a few surviving observers of the manners in humble life\r\nthat give character to the times. He is noticed here because he\r\nintroduces another individual connected with the history of the season.\r\nAdopting Mr. Smith’s language, we must speak of Conway as though his\r\n“cry” were still with us. “This industrious man, who has eleven walks in\r\nand about London, never had a day’s illness, nor has once slept out of\r\nhis own bed; and let the weather be what it may, he trudges on, and only\r\ntakes his rest on Sundays. He walks, on an average, twenty-five miles a\r\nday; and this he has done for nearly forty-four years. His shoes are\r\nmade from old boots, and a pair will last him about six weeks. In his\r\nwalks he has frequently found small pieces of money, but never more than\r\na one pound note. He recollects a windmill standing near Moorfields, and\r\nwell remembers _Old Vinegar_.”[114] Without this notice of Conway, we\r\nshould not have known “Old Vinegar,” who made the rings for the boxers\r\nin Moorfields, beating the shins of the spectators, and who, after he\r\nhad arranged the circle, would cry out “mind your pockets all round.” He\r\nprovided sticks for the cudgel players, whose sports commenced on Easter\r\nMonday. At that time the “Bridewell boys” joined in the pastime, and\r\nenlivened the day by their skill in athletic exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nWETTING THE BLOCK.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe first Monday in March being the time when shoemakers in the country\r\ncease from working by candlelight, it used to be customary for them to\r\nmeet together in the evening for the purpose of _wetting the block_. On\r\nthese occasions the master either provided a supper for his men, or made\r\nthem a present of money or drink; the rest of the expense was defrayed\r\nby subscriptions among themselves, and sometimes by donations from\r\ncustomers. After the supper was ended, the block candlestick was placed\r\nin the midst, the shop candle was lighted, and all the glasses being\r\nfilled, the oldest hand in the shop poured the contents of his glass\r\nover the candle to extinguish it: the rest then drank the contents of\r\ntheirs standing, and gave three cheers. The meeting was usually kept to\r\na late hour.\r\n\r\nThis account of the custom is from personal observation, made many years\r\nago, in various parts of Hampshire, Berkshire, and the adjoining\r\ncounties.

Excessive\r\nfasting begat excessive feasting, and there was no feast in old times\r\nwithout excessive drinking. A morning head-ache from the contents of the\r\ntankard was cured by “a hair of the same dog,”--a phrase well understood\r\nby hard-drinkers, signifying that madness from drinking was to be cured\r\nby the madness of drinking again. It is in common use with drinkers of\r\npunch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the days in this month seem\r\n\r\n    “For talking age and youthful lovers made.”\r\n\r\nThe genial breezes animate declining life, and waft “visions of glory”\r\nto those who are about to travel the journey of existence on their own\r\naccount.

The air is mild and balmy, with, now and then, a cool\r\ngush by no means unpleasant, but, on the contrary, contributing towards\r\nthat cheering and peculiar feeling which we experience only in spring.\r\nThe sky is clear, the sun flings abroad not only a gladdening splendour,\r\nbut an almost summer glow. The world seems suddenly aroused to hope and\r\nenjoyment. The fields are assuming a vernal greenness,--the buds are\r\nswelling in the hedges,--the banks are displaying amidst the brown\r\nremains of last year’s vegetation, the luxuriant weeds of this. There\r\nare arums, ground-ivy, chervil, the glaucous leaves, and burnished\r\nflowers of the pilewort,\r\n\r\n                 “The first gilt thing,\r\n    Which wears the trembling pearls of spring;”\r\n\r\nand many another fresh and early burst of greenery. All unexpectedly\r\ntoo, in some embowered lane, you are arrested by the delicious odour of\r\nviolets--those sweetest of Flora’s children, which have furnished so\r\nmany pretty allusions to the poets, and which are not yet exhausted;\r\nthey are like true friends, we do not know half their sweetness till\r\nthey have felt the sunshine of our kindness; and again, they are like\r\nthe pleasures of our childhood, the earliest and the most beautiful.\r\nNow, however, they are to be seen in all their glory--blue and\r\nwhite--modestly peering through their thickly clustering leaves. The\r\nlark is carolling in the blue fields of air; the blackbird and thrush\r\nare again shouting and replying to each other from the tops of the\r\nhighest trees. As you pass cottages, they have caught the happy\r\ninfection. There are windows thrown open, and doors standing a-jar. The\r\ninhabitants are in their gardens, some cleaning away rubbish, some\r\nturning up the light and fresh-smelling soil amongst the tufts of\r\nsnowdrops and rows of glowing yellow crocuses, which every where abound;\r\nand the children, ten to one, are busy peeping into the first\r\nbird’s-nest of the season--the hedge-sparrow’s, with its four blue eggs,\r\nsnugly, but unwisely, built in the pile of old pea-rods.\r\n\r\nIn the fields the labourers are plashing and trimming the hedges, and in\r\nall directions are teams at plough. You smell the wholesome, and we may\r\ntruly say, aromatic soil, as it is turned up to the sun, brown and rich,\r\nthe whole country over. It is delightful as you pass along deep hollow\r\nlanes, or are hidden in copses, to hear the tinkling gears of the\r\nhorses, and the clear voices of the lads calling to them. It is not\r\nless pleasant to catch the busy caw of the rookery, and the first meek\r\ncry of the young lambs. The hares are hopping about the fields, the\r\nexcitement of the season overcoming their habitual timidity. The bees\r\nare revelling in the yellow catkins of the sallow. The woods, though yet\r\nunadorned with their leafy garniture, are beautiful to look on. They\r\nseem flushed with life. Their boughs are of a clear and glossy lead\r\ncolour, and the tree-tops are rich with the vigorous hues of brown, red,\r\nand purple; and if you plunge into their solitudes, there are symptoms\r\nof revivification under your feet, the springing mercury, and green\r\nblades of the blue-bells--and perhaps, above you, the early nest of the\r\nmissel-thrush perched between the boughs of a young oak, to tinge your\r\nthoughts with the anticipation of summer.\r\n\r\nThese are mornings not to be neglected by the lover of nature; and if\r\nnot neglected, then, not to be forgotten, for they will stir the springs\r\nof memory, and make us live over again times and seasons, in which we\r\ncannot, for the pleasure and the purity of our spirits, live too much.\r\n\r\n  _Nottingham._\r\n\r\n  W.

She afterwards became duchess of\r\nBolton.\r\n\r\nTO ERR is a blemish entailed upon mortality, and indiscretion seldom or\r\nnever escapes without censure, the more heavy, as the character is more\r\nremarkable; and doubled, nay trebled, by the world, if that character is\r\nmarked by success: then malice shoots against it all her stings, and the\r\nsnakes of envy are let loose. To the humane and generous heart then must\r\nthe injured appeal, and certain relief will be found in impartial\r\nhonour. Miss Fisher is forced to sue to that jurisdiction to protect her\r\nfrom the baseness of little scribblers, and scurvy malevolence. She has\r\nbeen abused in public papers, exposed in print shops, and, to wind up\r\nthe whole, some wretches, mean, ignorant, and venal, would impose upon\r\nthe public by daring to publish her memoirs. She hopes to prevent the\r\nsuccess of their endeavours, by declaring that nothing of that sort has\r\nthe slightest foundation in truth.\r\n\r\n  C.

The letter has been\r\nobligingly transcribed and communicated by our kind correspondent, T.

Lying a bed is a sad destroyer of health,\r\nand getting up early a vast improver of time. It is an old and a _true_\r\nsaying, that “an hour in the morning before breakfast, is worth two all\r\nthe rest of the day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn “The Examiner” of the 31st of March, 1822, there is the following\r\npleasant little story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\nOne morning at daybreak a father came into his son’s bedchamber, and\r\ntold him that a wonderful stranger was to be seen. “You are sick,” said\r\nhe, “and fond of great shows. Here are no quack-doctors now, nor keeping\r\nof beds. A remarkable being is announced all over the town, who not only\r\nheals the sick, but makes the very grass grow; and what is more, he is\r\nto rise out of the sea.” The boy, though he was of a lazy habit, and did\r\nnot like to be waked, jumped up at hearing of such an extraordinary\r\nexhibition, and hastened with his father to the door of the house, which\r\nstood upon the sea-shore. “There,” said the father, pointing to the sun,\r\nwhich at that moment sprung out of the ocean like a golden world,\r\n“there, foolish boy, you who get me so many expenses with your lazy\r\ndiseases, and yourself into so many troubles, behold at last a remedy,\r\ncheap, certain, and delightful. Behold at last a physician, who has only\r\nto look in your face every morning at this same hour, and you will be\r\nsurely well.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL MEDICAL PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nCountry people who are unusually plain in notion, and straight forward\r\nin conduct, frequently commit the care of their health to very odd sort\r\nof practitioners.\r\n\r\nA late celebrated empiric, in Yorkshire, called the _Whitworth Doctor_,\r\nwas of so great fame as to have the honour of attending the brother of\r\nlord Thurlow. The name of this _doctor_ was Taylor: he and his brother\r\nwere _farriers_ by profession, and to the last, if both a two-legged and\r\na four-legged patient were presented at the same time, the _doctor_\r\nalways preferred the four-legged one. Their _practice_ was immense, as\r\nmay be well imagined from the orders they gave the druggist; they dealt\r\nprincipally with Ewbank and Wallis, of York, and a _ton_ of Glauber’s\r\nsalt, with other articles in proportion, was their usual order. On a\r\nSunday morning the _doctors_ used to bleed gratis. The patients, often\r\nto the number of an hundred, were seated on benches round a room, where\r\ntroughs were placed to receive the blood. One of the _doctors_ then went\r\nand tied up the arm of each patient, and was immediately followed by the\r\nother who opened the vein. Such a scene is easier conceived than\r\ndescribed. From their medical practice, the nice formality of scales and\r\nweights was banished; all was “_rule of thumb_.” An example of their\r\npractice may elucidate their claim to celebrity: being sent for to a\r\npatient who was in the last stage of a consumption, the learned doctor\r\nprescribed _a leg of mutton_ to be boiled _secundum artem_, into very\r\nstrong broth, a _quart_ of which was to be taken at proper intervals:\r\nwhat might have been its success is not to be related, as the patient\r\ndied before the first dose was got down. As _bone-setters_ they were\r\nremarkably skilful, and, perhaps, to their _real merit_ in this, and the\r\n_cheapness_ of their medicines, they were indebted for their great local\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Public Ledger” of the 31st of March, 1825, contains\r\n\r\n\r\n_A crooked Coincidence_.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet published in the year 1703, has the following strange\r\ntitle:--“The deformity of sin cured, a sermon, preached at St.\r\nMichael’s, Crooked Lane, before the Prince of Orange; by the Rev.

This may be the real derivation; the former is the most\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“April,” says the author of the _Mirror of the Months_, “is spring--the\r\nonly spring month that we possess--the most juvenile of the months, and\r\nthe most feminine--the sweetest month of all the year; partly because it\r\nushers in the May, and partly for its own sake, so far as any thing can\r\nbe valuable without reference to any thing else. It is, to May and June,\r\nwhat ‘sweet fifteen,’ in the age of woman, is to passion-stricken\r\neighteen, and perfect two-and-twenty. It is worth two Mays, because it\r\ntells tales of May in every sigh that it breathes, and every tear that\r\nit lets fall. It is the harbinger, the herald, the promise, the\r\nprophecy, the foretaste of all the beauties that are to follow it--of\r\nall, and more--of all the delights of summer, and all the ‘pride, pomp,\r\nand circumstance of glorious autumn.’ It is fraught with beauties that\r\nno other month can bring before us, and\r\n\r\n    ‘It bears a glass which shows us many more.’\r\n\r\nIts life is one sweet alternation of smiles and sighs and tears, and\r\ntears and sighs and smiles, till it is consummated at last in the open\r\nlaughter of May.”\r\n\r\nBy the same hand we are directed to observe, “what a sweet flush of new\r\ngreen has started up to the face of this meadow! And the new-born\r\ndaisies that stud it here and there, give it the look of an emerald sky,\r\npowdered with snowy stars. In making our way to yonder hedgerow, which\r\ndivides the meadow from the little copse that lines one side of it, let\r\nus not take the shortest way, but keep religiously to the little\r\nfootpath; for the young grass is as yet too tender to bear being trod\r\nupon; and the young lambs themselves, while they go cropping its crisp\r\npoints, let the sweet daisies alone, as if they loved to look upon a\r\nsight as pretty and as innocent as themselves.” It is further remarked\r\nthat “the great charm of this month, both in the open country and the\r\ngarden, is undoubtedly the infinite _green_ which pervades it every\r\nwhere, and which we had best gaze our fill at while we may, as it lasts\r\nbut a little while,--changing in a few weeks into an endless variety of\r\nshades and tints, that are equivalent to as many different colours. It\r\nis this, and the budding forth of every living member of the vegetable\r\nworld, after its long winter death, that in fact constitutes _the\r\nspring_; and the sight of which affects us in the manner it does, from\r\nvarious causes--chiefly moral and associated ones; but one of which is\r\nunquestionably physical: I mean the sight of so much tender green after\r\nthe eye has been condemned to look for months and months on the mere\r\nnegation of all colour, which prevails in winter in our climate. The eye\r\nfeels cheered, cherished, and regaled by this colour, as the tongue does\r\nby a quick and pleasant taste, after having long palated nothing but\r\ntasteless and insipid things.--This is the principal charm of spring, no\r\ndoubt. But another, and one that is scarcely second to this, is, the\r\nbright flush of blossoms that prevails over and almost hides every thing\r\nelse in the fruit-garden and orchard. What exquisite differences and\r\ndistinctions and resemblances there are between all the various blossoms\r\nof the fruit-trees; and no less in their general effect than in their\r\nseparate details! The almond-blossom, which comes first of all, and\r\nwhile the tree is quite bare of leaves, is of a bright blush-rose\r\ncolour; and when they are fully blown, the tree, if it has been kept to\r\na compact head, instead of being permitted to straggle, looks like one\r\nhuge rose, magnified by some fairy magic, to deck the bosom of some fair\r\ngiantess. The various kinds of plum follow, the blossoms of which are\r\nsnow-white, and as full and clustering as those of the almond. The peach\r\nand nectarine, which are now full blown, are unlike either of the above;\r\nand their sweet effect, as if growing out of the hard bare wall, or the\r\nrough wooden paling, is peculiarly pretty. They are of a deep blush\r\ncolour, and of a delicate bell shape, the lips, however, divided, and\r\nturning backward, to expose the interior to the cherishing sun. But\r\nperhaps the bloom that is richest and most _promising_ in its general\r\nappearance is that of the cherry, clasping its white honours all round\r\nthe long straight branches, from heel to point, and not letting a leaf\r\nor a bit of stem be seen, except the three or four leaves that come as a\r\ngreen finish at the extremity of each branch. The other blossoms, of the\r\npears, and (loveliest of all) the apples, do not come in perfection till\r\nnext month.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\nThe beauties of the seasons are a constant theme with their\r\ndiscoverers--the poets. Spring, as the reproductive source of “light and\r\nlife and love,” has the preeminence with these children of nature. The\r\nauthors of “_The Forest Minstrel_ and other poems,” William and Mary\r\nHowitt, have high claims upon reflective and imaginative minds, in\r\nreturn for the truth and beauty contained in an elegant volume, which\r\ncultivates the moral sense, and infuses a devotional spirit, through\r\nexquisite description and just application. The writers have traversed\r\n“woods and wilds, and fields, and lanes, with a curious and delighted\r\neye,” and “written not for the sake of writing,” but for the indulgence\r\nof their overflowing feelings. They are “members of the Society of\r\nFriends,” and those who are accustomed to regard individuals of that\r\ncommunity as necessarily incapable of poetical impression, will be\r\npleased by reading from Mr. Howitt’s “Epistle Dedicatory” what he says\r\nof his own verses, and of his helpmate in the work:--\r\n\r\n    And now ’tis spring, and bards are gathering flowers;\r\n      So I have cull’d you these, and with them sent\r\n    The gleanings of a nymph whom some few hours\r\n      Ago I met with--some few years I meant--\r\n    Gathering “true-love” amongst the wild-wood bowers;\r\n      You’ll find some buds all with this posy blent,\r\n    If that ye know them, which some lady fair\r\n    Viewing, may haply prize, for they are wond’rous rare.\r\n\r\nArtists have seldom represented friends--“of the Society of\r\nFriends,”--with poetical feeling. Mr. Howitt’s sketch of himself, and\r\nher whom he found gathering “true-love,” though they were not clad\r\nperhaps “as worldlings are,” would inspire a painter, whose art could be\r\nroused by the pen, to a charming picture of youthful affection. The\r\nhabit of some of the young men, in the peaceable community, maintains\r\nits character, without that extremity of the fashion of being out of\r\nfashion, which marks the wearer as remarkably formal; while the young\r\nfemales of the society, still preserving the distinction prescribed by\r\ndiscipline, dress more attractively, to the cultivated eye, than a\r\nmultitude of the sex who study variety of costume. Such lovers, pictured\r\nas they are imagined from Mr. Howitt’s lines, would grace a landscape,\r\nenfoliated from other stanzas in the same poem, which raise the fondest\r\nrecollections of the pleasures of boyhood in spring.\r\n\r\n    Then did I gather, with a keen delight,\r\n      All changes of the seasons, and their signs:\r\n    Then did I speed forth, at the first glad sight\r\n      Of the coy spring--of spring that archly shines\r\n    Out for a day--then goes--and then more bright\r\n      Comes laughing forth, like a gay lass that lines\r\n    A dark lash with a ray that beams and burns,\r\n    And scatters hopes and doubts, and smiles and frowns, by turns.\r\n\r\n    On a sweet, shining morning thus sent out,\r\n      It seem’d what man was made for, to look round\r\n    And trace the full brook, that, with clamorous route,\r\n      O’er fallen trees, and roots black curling, wound\r\n    Through glens, with wild brakes scatter’d all about;\r\n      Where not a leaf or green blade yet was found\r\n    Springing to hide the red fern of last year,\r\n    And hemlock’s broken stems, and rustling rank grass sere.\r\n\r\n    But hazel catkins, and the bursting buds\r\n      Of the fresh willow, whisper’d “spring is coming;”\r\n    And bullfinches forth flitting from the woods,\r\n      With their rich silver voices; and the humming\r\n    Of a new waken’d bee that pass’d; and the broods\r\n      Of ever dancing gnats, again consuming,\r\n    In pleasant sun-light, their re-given time;\r\n    And the germs swelling in the red shoots of the lime.\r\n\r\n    All these were tell-tales of far brighter hours,\r\n      That had been, and again were on their way;\r\n    The breaking forth of green things, and of flowers,\r\n      From the earth’s breast; from bank and quickening spray\r\n    Dews, buds, and blossoms; and in woodland bowers,\r\n      Fragrant and fresh, full many a sweet bird’s lay,\r\n    Sending abroad, from the exultant spring,\r\n    To every living heart a gladsome welcoming.\r\n\r\n  _Howitt._\r\n\r\n  [117] Vol. i. p. 407.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 1.~\r\n\r\nALL FOOL’S DAY.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of the present work, (p. 409,) there is an account\r\nof the singular usage of fool-making to-day, which may be further\r\nillustrated by a few lines from an almanac of 1760:--\r\n\r\n    The first of April, some do say,\r\n    Is set apart for All Fool’s-day;\r\n    But why the people call it so,\r\n    Nor I, nor they themselves, do know.\r\n    But on this day are people sent\r\n    On purpose for pure merriment;\r\n    And though the day is known before,\r\n    Yet frequently there is great store\r\n    Of these forgetfuls to be found,\r\n    Who’re sent to flance Moll Dixon’s round;\r\n    And having tried each shop and stall,\r\n    And disappointed at them all,\r\n    At last some tell them of the cheat,\r\n    And then they hurry from the street,\r\n    And straightway home with shame they run,\r\n    And others laugh at what is done.\r\n    But ’tis a thing to be disputed,\r\n    Which is the greatest fool reputed,\r\n    The man that innocently went,\r\n    Or he that him designedly sent.\r\n\r\n  _Poor Robin._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe custom of making April fools prevails all over the continent. A lady\r\nrelates that the day is further marked in Provence by every body, both\r\nrich and poor, having for dinner, under some form or other, a sort of\r\npeas peculiar to the country, called _pois chiches_. While the convent\r\nof the Chartreux was standing, it was one of the great jokes of the day\r\nto send novices thither to ask for these peas, telling them that the\r\nfathers were obliged to give them away to any body who would come for\r\nthem. So many applications were in consequence made in the course of the\r\nday for the promised bounty, that the patience of the monks was at last\r\nusually exhausted, and it was well if the vessel carried to receive the\r\npease was not thrown at the head of the bearer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is an amusing anecdote connected with the church of the convent of\r\nthe Chartreux, at Provence. It was dedicated to St. John, and over the\r\nportico were colossal statues of the four evangelists, which have been\r\nthrown down and broken to pieces, and the fragments lie scattered about.\r\nThe first time Miss Plumptre with her party visited this spot, they\r\nfound an old woman upon her knees before a block of stone, muttering\r\nsomething to herself:--when she arose up, curiosity led them to inquire,\r\nwhether there was any thing particular in that stone; to which she\r\nreplied with a deep sigh, _Ah oui, c’est un morceau de Saint Jean_, “Ah\r\nyes, ’tis a piece of Saint John.” The old lady seemed to think that the\r\nsaint’s intercession in her behalf, mutilated as he was, might still be\r\nof some avail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Xylander’s Plutarch there is a passage in Greek, relative to the\r\n“Feast of Fools,” celebrated by the Romans, to this effect, “Why do they\r\ncall the Quirinalia the Feast of Fools? Either, because they allowed\r\nthis day (as Juba tells us) to those who could not ascertain their own\r\ntribes, or because they permitted those who had missed the celebration\r\nof the Fornacalia in their proper tribes, along with the rest of the\r\npeople, either out of negligence, absence, or ignorance, to hold their\r\nfestival apart on this day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Romans on the first day of April abstained from pleading causes, and\r\nthe Roman ladies performed ablutions under myrtle trees, crowned\r\nthemselves with its leaves, and offered sacrifices to Venus. This custom\r\noriginated in a mythological story, that as Venus was drying her wetted\r\nhair by a river side, she was perceived by satyrs, whose gaze confused\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n    But soon with myrtles she her beauties veiled,\r\n    From whence this annual custom was entail’d.\r\n\r\n  _Ovid._\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWCASTLE.\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Common Council Book._\r\n\r\n“April 1, 1695. All-Saints’ parish humbly request the metal of the\r\nstatue, towards the repair of their bells.”\r\n\r\nThis refers to a statue of James II. pulled down from the Exchange in\r\nconsequence of lord Lumley having entered the town and declared for a\r\nfree parliament. It was an equestrian figure in copper, of the size of\r\nCharles I. at Charing-cross. The mob demolished the statue, dragged it\r\nto the quay, and cast it into the river. As the parish of All-Saints\r\ndesired to turn the deposit to some account, the parish of St. Andrews\r\npetitioned for a share of the spoil, and it appears by the subjoined\r\nextract from the council books, that each was accommodated.\r\n\r\n“Ordered that All-Saints have the metal belonging to the horse of the\r\nsaid statue, except a leg thereof, which must go towards the casting of\r\na new bell for St. Andrew’s parish.”\r\n\r\nA print of the statue was published “on two large sheets of Genoa\r\npaper,” price 5_s._ by Joseph Barber of Newcastle. There is an engraving\r\nfrom it in “Local Records, by John Sykes, bookseller, Newcastle, 1824,”\r\na book which consists of a chronological arrangement of curious and\r\ninteresting facts, and events, that have occurred exclusively in the\r\ncounties of Durham and Northumberland, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Berwick,\r\nwith an obituary and anecdotes of remarkable persons.

The different sorts of nests of each\r\nspecies, adapted to the wants of each, and springing out of their\r\nrespective instincts, combined with the propensity to construct, would\r\nform a curious subject of research for the natural historian. Every part\r\nof the world furnishes materials for the aërial architects: leaves and\r\nsmall twigs, roots and dried grass, mixed with clay, serve for the\r\nexternal; whilst moss, wool, fine hair, and the softest animal and\r\nvegetable downs, form the warm internal part of these commodious\r\ndwellings:--\r\n\r\n    Of vernal songsters--some to the holly hedge,\r\n    Nestling, repair, and to the thicket some;\r\n    Some to the rude protection of the thorn\r\n    Commit their feeble offspring: the cleft tree\r\n    Offers its kind concealment to a few,\r\n    Their food its insects, and its moss their nests:\r\n    Others apart, far in the grassy dale\r\n    Or roughening waste, their humble texture weave:\r\n    But most in woodland solitudes delight,\r\n    In unfrequented glooms or shaggy banks,\r\n    Steep, and divided by a babbling brook,\r\n    Whose murmurs soothe them all the livelong day,\r\n    When by kind duty fixed. Among the roots\r\n    Of hazel, pendent o’er the plaintive stream,\r\n    They frame the first foundation of their domes,\r\n    Dry sprigs of trees, in artful fabric laid,\r\n    And bound with clay together. Now ’tis naught\r\n    But restless hurry through the busy air,\r\n    Beat by unnumbered wings. The swallow sweeps\r\n    The slimy pool, to build the hanging house\r\n    Intent: and often from the careless back\r\n    Of herds and flocks a thousand tugging bills\r\n    Pluck hair and wool; and oft, when unobserved,\r\n    Steal from the barn a straw; till soft and warm,\r\n    Clean and complete, their habitation grows.\r\n\r\n  _Thomson._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The cavern-loving wren sequestered seeks\r\n    The verdant shelter of the hollow stump,\r\n    And with congenial moss, harmless deceit,\r\n    Constructs a safe abode. On topmost boughs\r\n    The glossy raven, and the hoarsevoiced crow,\r\n    Rocked by the storm, erect their airy nests.\r\n    The ousel, lone frequenter of the grove\r\n    Of fragrant pines, in solemn depth of shade\r\n    Finds rest; or ’mid the holly’s shining leaves,\r\n    A simple bush the piping thrush contents,\r\n    Though in the woodland concert he aloft\r\n    Trills from his spotted throat a powerful strain,\r\n    And scorns the humbler quire. The lark too asks\r\n    A lowly dwelling, hid beneath a turf,\r\n    Or hollow, trodden by the sinking hoof;\r\n    Songster of heaven! who to the sun such lays\r\n    Pours forth, as earth ne’er owns. Within the hedge\r\n    The sparrow lays her skystained eggs. The barn,\r\n    With eaves o’erpendant, holds the chattering tribe:\r\n    Secret the linnet seeks the tangled copse:\r\n    The white owl seeks some antique ruined wall,\r\n    Fearless of rapine; or in hollow trees,\r\n    Which age has caverned, safely courts repose:\r\n    The thievish pie, in twofold colours clad,\r\n    Roofs o’er her curious nest with firmwreathed twigs,\r\n    And sidelong forms her cautious door; she dreads\r\n    The taloned kite, or pouncing hawk; savage\r\n    Herself, with craft suspicion ever dwells.\r\n\r\n  _Bidlake._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 43·37.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP WEATHER GUIDE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Cornhill, March, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following observations on the leechworm were made by a\r\ngentleman who kept one several years for the purpose of a weather-glass:\r\n\r\nA phial of water, containing a leech, I kept on the frame of my lower\r\nsash window, so that when I looked in the morning I could know what\r\nwould be the weather of the following day. If the weather proves serene\r\nand beautiful, the leech lies motionless at the bottom of the glass, and\r\nrolled together in a spiral form.\r\n\r\nIf it rains, either before or after noon, it is found crept up to the\r\ntop of its lodging, and there it remains till the weather is settled. If\r\nwe are to have wind, the poor prisoner gallops through its limped\r\nhabitation with amazing swiftness, and seldom rests till it begins to\r\nblow hard.\r\n\r\nIf a storm of thunder and rain is to succeed, for some days before it\r\nlodges, almost continually, without the water, and discovers very great\r\nuneasiness in violent throes and convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn the frost, as in clear summer weather, it lies constantly at the\r\nbottom; and in snow, as in rainy weather, it pitches its dwelling upon\r\nthe very mouth of the phial.\r\n\r\nWhat reasons may be assigned for these circumstances I must leave\r\nphilosophers to determine, though one thing is evident to every body,\r\nthat it must be affected in the same way as that of the mercury and\r\nspirits in the weather-glass. It has, doubtless, a very surprising\r\nsensation; for the change of weather, even days before, makes a visible\r\nalteration upon its manner of living.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may not be amiss to note, that the leech was kept in a common\r\neight-ounce phial glass, about three-quarters filled with water, and\r\ncovered on the mouth with a piece of linen rag. In the summer the water\r\nis changed once a week, and in the winter once a fortnight. This is a\r\nweather-glass which may be purchased at a very trifling expense, and\r\nwhich will last I do not know how many years.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

On inquiry into the cause of\r\nthis proceeding, I was informed by an intelligent gentleman residing in\r\nthe neighbourhood, that though one and the _same_ handle produced the\r\n_same_ water from the _same_ well through _either of the spouts_, yet\r\nthe populace, and even better informed people, had for a number of years\r\nconceived an idea, which had been handed down from father to son, that\r\nthe water when drawn from the hindermost spout would be of an _unlucky_\r\nand _poisonous_ nature; and this vulgar prejudice is from time to time\r\nkept afloat, inasmuch, as by its being never used, a kind of dusty fur\r\nat length collects, and the water, when suffered from curiosity to pass\r\nthrough, at first runs foul; and this tends to carry conviction still\r\nfurther to these ignorant people, who with the most solemn assurances\r\ninformed me, it was certain death to taste of the water so drawn, and no\r\nargument could divest them of their superstitious conceit, though the\r\nwell had been repeatedly cleaned out, before them, by order of the\r\nmagistrates, and the internal mechanism of the pump explained. We need\r\nnot be surprised at the bigotted ignorance of the ruder ages, either in\r\nthis country or in less civilized regions, when we witness facts so\r\ngrossly superstitious obtaining in our own time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 45·67.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 6.~\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\nThis period of the year is so awakening to intellectual powers, that for\r\na few days some matters of fact are occasionally deferred in favour of\r\nimaginative and descriptive effusions occasioned by the season.\r\n\r\nTHE POET’S PEN.\r\n\r\n(_From the Greek of Menecrates._)\r\n\r\n    I was an useless reed; no cluster hung\r\n    My brow with purple grapes, no blossom flung\r\n    The coronet of crimson on my stem;\r\n    No apple blushed upon me, nor (the gem\r\n    Of flowers) the violet strewed the yellow heath\r\n    Around my feet, nor Jessamine’s sweet wreath\r\n    Robed me in silver: day and night I pined\r\n    On the lone moor, and shiver’d in the wind.\r\n    At length a poet found me.

ANDREW’S.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote, under the article “Black Friars,” in Brand’s\r\n“History of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,” as a specimen of the extreme\r\nperversion of mind in the Romish clergy of former times, is curious, and\r\nmay amuse your readers as much as it has me.\r\n\r\nRichard Marshall, who had been one of the brethren, and also prior of\r\nthe house, in the year 1521, at St. Andrew’s, Scotland, informed his\r\naudience there, that _Pater noster_ should be addressed to God and not\r\nto the saints. The doctors of St. Andrew’s, in their great wisdom, or\r\nrather craftiness, appointed a preacher to oppose this tenet, which he\r\ndid in a sermon from Matt. v. 3. “Blessed are the poor in spirit.”\r\n“Seeing,” says he, “we say good day, _father_, to any old man in the\r\nstreet, we may call a saint, _pater_, who is older than any alive: and\r\nseeing they are in _heaven_, we may say to any of them, ‘_hallowed_ be\r\nthy name;’ and since they are in the _kingdom_ of heaven, we may say to\r\nany of them ‘_thy kingdom come_:’ and seeing their will is _God’s will_,\r\nwe may say, ‘_thy will_ be done,’” &c. When the friar was proceeding\r\nfurther, he was hissed and even obliged to leave the city. Yet we are\r\ntold, the dispute continued among the doctors about the _pater_. Some\r\nwould have it said to God _formaliter_, to the saints _materialiter_;\r\nothers, to God _principaliter_, to the saints _minus principaliter_; or\r\n_primario_ to God, _secundario_ to the saints; or to God _strictè_, and\r\nto the saints _latè_. With all these distinctions they could not agree.\r\nIt is said, that Tom, who was servant to the sub-prior of St. Andrew’s,\r\none day perceiving his master in trouble, said to him, “Sir, what is the\r\ncause of your trouble?” The master answered, “We cannot agree about the\r\nsaying of the _pater_.” The fellow replied, “To whom should it be said\r\nbut to God alone?” The master asks, “What then shall we do with the\r\n_saints_?” To which Tom rejoined, “Give them _ave’s_ and _crede’s_\r\nenough, that may suffice them, and too well too.” The readers of the\r\n_Every-Day Book_ will probably think that Tom was wiser or honester than\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\n  J.

In the fields, the bulbous\r\ncrowfoot, _ranunculus bulbosus_, begins to blow. Daisies become pretty\r\ncommon, and dandelions are seen here and there by road sides, and in\r\nfields, on a warm soil, are pretty abundant. The pilewort, _ficaria\r\nverna_, still decorates the thickets and shady green banks with its\r\nbright yellow stars of gold. It may be observed generally, that the\r\nflowers found at this time belong to the primaveral Flora; those of the\r\nvernal being as yet undeveloped. By the sides of rivers, streams, and\r\nponds, along the wet margins of ditches, and in moist meadows, and\r\nmarshes, grows the marsh marigold, _caltha palustris_, whose golden\r\nyellow flowers have a brilliant effect at a small distance.\r\n\r\n                           Prolific gales\r\n    Warm the soft air, and animate the vales.\r\n    Woven with flowers and shrubs, and freshest green,\r\n    Thrown with wild boldness o’er the lovely scene\r\n    A brilliant carpet, of unnumbered dyes,\r\n    With sweet variety enchants the eyes.\r\n    Thick are the trees with leaves; in every grove\r\n    The feathered minstrels tune their throats to love.\r\n\r\n  _Kleist._\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ANTIQUITIES,\r\n\r\nand a\r\n\r\nLETTER OF LORD THURLOW’S.\r\n\r\nA gentleman indulges the editor with the following account of a singular\r\nhousehold utensil, and a drawing of it, from whence a correct engraving\r\nhas been made; together with a letter from the late lord chancellor\r\nThurlow, which from his distinguished hand on a singular occurrence,\r\nmerits preservation.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _April 3, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--I shall be happy to communicate any thing in my power, connected\r\nwith antiquities to the _Every-Day Book_, which I have taken from the\r\nbeginning and been highly pleased with; and, first, I send you a drawing\r\nfor insertion, if you think it worthy, of a carving, in my possession,\r\non an ancient oak board, two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Ancient Carving.~]\r\n\r\nIt represents the letters ~I. h. c.~ in the centre, surrounded by this\r\nlegend, viz.\r\n\r\n    “_An harte that is wyse wyll obstine from\r\n    sinnes and increas in the workes of God._”\r\n\r\nAs this legend reads backward, and all the carving is incuse, it was\r\nevidently intended to give impression to something; I imagine pastry.\r\n\r\nAn original letter is now before me, from lord chancellor Thurlow, to a\r\nNorfolk farmer, who had sent him a hare, and two and a half brace of\r\npartridges, enclosed in a large turnip of his own growth.

To gratify the ears and eyes of the young, we have\r\nmore street organs and shows in spring than in the autumn, and the\r\nadventures of that merry fellow “Punch in the Puppet-show,” are\r\nrepresented to successive crowds in every street, whence his exhibitors\r\nconceive they can extract funds for the increase of their treasury.\r\n\r\nA kind hand communicates an article of curious import, peculiarly\r\nseasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCH IN THE PUPPET SHOW.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--I do not know, whether in the absence of more interesting matter,\r\na few remarks on an old favourite may be allowed. The character I am\r\nabout to mention, has I am sure at one time or another delighted most of\r\nyour readers, and I confess to be still amused with his vagaries--I mean\r\n“that celebrated wooden Roscius, _Mister Punch_.” It is very difficult\r\nto trace accurately the origin and variation of any character of this\r\ndescription; and I shall, therefore, only offer some unconnected\r\nnotices.\r\n\r\nIn some of the old mysteries, wherein you are so well read, “the devil”\r\nwas the _buffoon_ of the piece, and used to indulge himself most freely\r\nin the gross indecencies tolerated in the earlier ages. When those\r\nmysteries began to be refined into moralities, the _vice_ gradually\r\nsuperseded the former clown, if he may be so designated; and at the\r\ncommencement of such change, frequently shared the comic part of the\r\nperformance with him. The _vice_ was armed with a dagger of lath, with\r\nwhich he was to belabour the devil, who, sometimes, however, at the\r\nconclusion of the piece, carried off the _vice_ with him. Here we have\r\nsomething like the club wielded by Punch, and the wand of harlequin, at\r\nthe present time, and a similar finish of the devil and Punch, may be\r\nseen daily in our streets.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the sixteenth century the drama began to assume a\r\nmore regular form, and the vice, in his turn, had to make way for the\r\nclown or fool, who served to fill up the space between the acts, by\r\nsupposed extemporaneous witticisms; holding, occasionally, trials of wit\r\nwith any of the spectators who were bold enough to venture with him. The\r\nlast play, perhaps, in which the regular fool was introduced, was “The\r\nWoman Captain” of Shadwell, in the year 1680. Tarleton, in the time of\r\nShakspeare, was a celebrated performer of this description. The fool was\r\nfrequently dressed in a motley or party-coloured coat, and each leg clad\r\nin different coloured hose. A sort of hood covered his head, resembling\r\na monk’s cowl: this was afterwards changed for a cap, each being usually\r\nsurmounted with the neck and head of a cock, or sometimes only the\r\ncrest, or comb; hence the term _cockscomb_. In his hand he carried the\r\nbauble, a short stick, having at one end a fool’s head, and at the\r\nother, frequently a bladder with peas or sand, to punish those who\r\noffended him. His dress was often adorned with morris-bells, or large\r\nknobs. We may observe much similarity to this dress, in the present\r\ncostume of Punch. He degenerated into a wooden performer, about the time\r\nthat the regular tragedy and comedy were introduced, i. e. in the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. Strolling players were prohibited a\r\nfew years afterwards, and some of those performers who had not skill or\r\ninterest enough to get a situation in any established company, went\r\nabout the country with puppet shows, or “motions,” as they were then\r\ncalled, wherein Punch was a prominent character, though not by that\r\nname, which was a subsequent importation, originally Policinello, or\r\nPunchinello; and when this name was introduced from the continent, some\r\nmodifications were made also in the character to whom the name was\r\nattached. The civil wars, and subsequent triumph of puritanism,\r\ndepressed theatrical proceedings, and Punch with other performers was\r\nobliged to hide himself, or act by stealth; but in the jovial reign of\r\nCharles II., he, and his brother actors, broke out with renewed\r\nsplendour, and until the time of George I. he maintained his rank\r\nmanfully, being mentioned with considerable _respect_ even by the\r\n“Spectator.” About this time, however, harlequinades were introduced,\r\nand have been so successfully continued, that poor Punch is contented to\r\nwalk the streets like a snail, with his house on his back, though still\r\npossessing as much fun as ever.\r\n\r\nPantomime, in its more extended sense, was known to the Greek and Roman\r\nstages, being introduced on the latter by Pylades and Bathyllus, in the\r\ntime of Augustus Cæsar. From that time to the present, different\r\nmodifications of this representation have taken place on the continent,\r\nand the lofty scenes of ancient pantomime, are degenerated to the\r\n_bizarre_ adventures of harlequin, pantaloon, zany, pierrot, scaramouch,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe first pantomine performed by grotesque characters in this country,\r\nwas at Drury-lane theatre, in the year 1702. It was composed by Mr.\r\nWeaver, and called “The Tavern Bilkers.” The next was performed at\r\nDrury-lane in 1716, and it was also composed by Mr. Weaver, in imitation\r\nof the ancient pantomime, and called “The Loves of Mars and Venus.”\r\n\r\nIn 1717, the first harlequinade, composed by Mr. Rich, was performed at\r\nthe theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, called, “Harlequin Executed.” This\r\nperformer, who acted under the name of Lun, was so celebrated for his\r\ntaste in composing these entertainments, and for his skill, as a\r\nharlequin, that they soon became established in the public favour. He\r\nflourished until the year 1761, and all his productions succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe harlequin on the French stage differed from ours, for he had\r\nconsiderable license of speech, somewhat similar to the theatric fools\r\nof the sixteenth century. Many of the witticisms of Dominique, a\r\ncelebrated harlequin in the time of Louis XIV. are still on record; it\r\nis said, indeed, that before his time, harlequin was but a grotesque\r\nignorant character, but that he being a man of wit, infused it into his\r\nrepresentation, and invented the character of Pierrot as a foolish\r\nservant, to fill up the piece. The old character of zany was similar to\r\nour modern clown, who now is generally the possessor of all the wit in\r\nthe performance. The name of pantaloon is said to have been derived from\r\nthe watch-word of the Venetians, _pianta leone;_ if so, (which is\r\ndoubtful) it must have been applied in derision of their fallen state,\r\nas compared with their former splendour. A more doubtful origin has been\r\ngiven of the name of harlequin; a young Italian actor of eminence in\r\nthis style of character, came to Paris in the time of Henry III. of\r\nFrance, and having been received into the house of the president,\r\nAchilles de Harlai, his brother actors, are said to have called him\r\nharlequino, from the name of his master. There was a knight called\r\nHarlequin, an extravagant dissipated man, who spent his substance in the\r\nwars of Charles Martel, against the Saracens, and afterwards lived by\r\npillage. Tradition says he was saved from perdition in consequence of\r\nhis services against the infidels, but condemned for a certain time to\r\nappear nightly upon earth, with those of his lineage.\r\n\r\nBut, as to derivations, some have derived the term merry-andrew, from\r\nthe time of the Druids, _an Drieu_, i.e. Arch-Druid,--others, from the\r\ncelebrated Andrew Borde, the writer and empiric. The merry-andrew used\r\nat fairs to wear a patched coat like the modern harlequin, and sometimes\r\na hunch on his back. It has been remarked that the common people are apt\r\nto give to some well-known facetious personage, the name of a favourite\r\ndish; hence, the jack-pudding of the English; the _jean-potage_ of the\r\nFrench; the _macaroni_ of the Italians, &c.\r\n\r\nA word or two more about Punch, and I have done. There are some\r\nhand-bills in the British Museum, of the time of queen Ann, from whence\r\nI made a few extracts some time ago. They principally relate to the\r\nshows at Bartlemy fair, and I observe at “Heatly’s booth,” that “the\r\nperformances will be compleated with the merry humors of sir John\r\nSpendall and Punchinello;” and James Miles, at “the Gun-Musick booth,”\r\namong other dances &c., exhibited “a new entertainment between a\r\nscaramouch, a harlequin, and a punchinello, in imitation of bilking a\r\nreckoning,--and a new dance by four scaramouches, after the Italian\r\nmanner,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe famous comedian Edwin, (the Liston of his day) acted the part of\r\nPunch, in a piece called “The Mirror,” at Covent-garden theatre: in this\r\nhe introduced a burlesque song by C. Dibdin, which obtained some\r\ncelebrity; evidently through the merit of the actor, rather than the\r\nsong, as it has nothing particular to recommend it.\r\n\r\n      Can’t you see by my hunch, sir,\r\n        Faddeldy daddeldy dino,\r\n      I am master Punch, sir,\r\n        Riberi biberi bino,\r\n    Fiddeldy, diddeldy, faddeldy, daddeldy,\r\n    Robbery, bobbery, ribery, bibery,\r\n    Faddeldy, daddeldy, dino,\r\n    Ribery, bibery, bino.\r\n          That merry fellow\r\n          Punchinello,\r\n          Dancing here, you see, sir,\r\n          Whose mirth not hell\r\n          Itself can quell\r\n          He’s ever in such glee, sir,\r\n    Niddlety, noddlety, niddlety, noddlety, niddlety, noddlety, nino.\r\n          Then let me pass, old Grecian,\r\n          Faddeldy, daddeldy, dino.\r\n          To the fields Elysian,\r\n          Bibery, bibery, bino.\r\n    Fiddledy, diddledy, faddledy, daddledy,\r\n    Robbery, bobbery, ribery, bibery,\r\n    Faddledy, daddledy, dino,\r\n    Ribery, bibery, bino.\r\n          My ranting, roaring Pluto,\r\n          Faddledy, daddledy, dino,\r\n          Just to a hair will suit oh,\r\n          Bibery, bibery, bino.\r\n          Faddledy, daddledy, &c.\r\n          Each jovial fellow,\r\n          At Punchinello,\r\n          Will, laughing o’er his cup roar,\r\n          I’ll rant and revel,\r\n          And play the devil,\r\n          And set all hell in an uproar,\r\n          Niddlety, noddlety, nino.\r\n              Then let me pass, &c.\r\n\r\nI therewith conclude this hasty communication, begging you to shorten it\r\nif you think proper.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  W.

This\r\ndrama which is of Italian origin, the editor of the _Every-Day Book_, in\r\nhis volume on “Ancient Mysteries,” has ventured to conjecture, may have\r\nbeen derived from the adventures of the street Punch. The supposition\r\nis somewhat heightened by Edwin’s song as the Punch of Covent-garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·32.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 11.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~St. Mary Islington Old Church~\r\n\r\n“Merry Islington.”]\r\n\r\n\r\nISLINGTON PARISH DINNER.\r\n\r\nIn March, an anonymous correspondent obligingly enclosed, and begged my\r\nacceptance of a ticket, for a parish dinner at Islington, on the 11th of\r\nApril, 1738. It would have been rudeness to decline the civility, and as\r\nthe editor was not prepared to join the guests at the great dinner, “not\r\nwhere they eat, but where they are eaten,” he appropriates the ticket to\r\nthe use for which it was intended by the donor, T. H. of St.\r\nJohn-street.\r\n\r\nIt would do the reader’s heart good to see this ticket--“printed from a\r\ncopper plate,” ten inches high, by seven inches wide--as large as a lord\r\nmayor’s ticket, and looking much better, because engraved by Toms, a\r\nfine firm artist of “the good old _school_,” which taught truth as an\r\nessential, and prohibited refinements, not existing in nature or\r\nsensible objects, as detraction of character.\r\n\r\nIt would do the reader’s heart good, I say, to see the dinner ticket I\r\nam now looking at. First, above the invitation--which is all that the\r\nlover of a dinner first sees--and therefore, because nothing precedes\r\nit, “above _all_,”--is a capital view of the _old_ parish church, and\r\nthe churchyard, wherein “lie the remains” of most of the company who\r\nattended the parish dinner--it being as certain that the remains of the\r\nrest of the company, occupy other tenements, of “the house appointed for\r\nall living,” as that they all lived, and ate and drank, and were merry.\r\n\r\nThis is not a melancholy, but a natural view. It may be said, there is\r\n“a time for all things,” but if there be any time, wherein we fear to\r\nentertain death, we are not fully prepared to receive him as we ought.\r\nIt is true, that with “the cup of kindness” at our lips, we do not\r\nexpect his friendly “shake,” before we finish the draught, yet the\r\nliquor will not be the worse for our remembering that his is a previous\r\nengagement; and, as we do not know the hour of appointment, we ought to\r\nbe ready at _all_ hours. The business of life is to die.\r\n\r\nI am not a member of a parish club, but I have sometimes thought, if I\r\ncould “do as others do,” and “go to club,” I should elect to belong to\r\nan old one, which preserved the minutes of its proceedings, and its\r\nmuniments, from the commencement. My first, and perhaps last, serious\r\nmotion, would be, “That each anniversary dinner ticket of the club, from\r\nthe first ticket to the last issued, should be framed and glazed, and\r\nhung on the walls of the club room, in chronological order.” Such a\r\nseries would be a never-failing source of interest and amusement. If the\r\nparish club of Islington exists, a collection of its tickets so\r\ndisposed, might be regarded as annals of peculiar worth, especially if\r\nmany of its predecessors in the annual office of “stewards for the\r\ndinner,” maintained the consequence of the club in the eyes of the\r\nparish, by respectability of execution and magnitude in the anniversary\r\nticket, commensurate with that of the year 1738, with Toms’s view of the\r\nold parish church and churchyard. I regret that these cannot be here\r\ngiven in the same size as on the ticket; the best that can be effected,\r\nis a reduced fac-simile of the original, which is accomplished in the\r\naccompanying engraving. Let any one who knows the new church of\r\nIslington, compare it with the present view of the old church, and say\r\nwhich church he prefers. At this time, however, the present church may\r\nbe more suitable to Islington, grown, or grown up to, as it is, until\r\nit is a part of London; but who would not wish it still a village, with\r\nthe old edifice for its parish church. That Islington is now more\r\nopulent and more respectable, may be very true; but opulence\r\nmonopolizes, and respectability is often a vain show in the stead of\r\nhappiness, and a mere flaunt on the ruins of comfort. The remark is, of\r\ncourse, general, and not of Islington in particular, all of whose\r\nopulent or respectable residents, may really be so, for aught I know to\r\nthe contrary. Be it known to them, however, on the authority of the old\r\ndinner ticket, that their predecessors, who succeeded the inhabitants\r\nfrom whose doings the village was called “merry Islington,” appear to\r\nhave dined at a reasonable hour, enjoyed a cheerful glass, and lived in\r\ngood fellowship.\r\n\r\nImmediately beneath the view of the old church on the ticket, follows\r\nthe stewards’ invitation to the dinner, here copied and subjoined\r\nverbatim.\r\n\r\n\r\n~St. Mary, Islington.~\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYou are desir’d to meet many others, NATIVES of this place, on TUESDAY,\r\ny^{e} 11th Day of April, 1738, at Mrs. ELIZ.

Wherefore, learn to take heed against rain,\r\nby the tale ensuing.\r\n\r\n    _Of the herdsman that said, “Ride apace, ye shall have rain.”_\r\n\r\nA certain scholar of Oxford, which had studied the judicials of\r\nastronomy, upon a time as he was riding by the way, there came by a\r\nherdman, and he asked this herdman how far it was to the next town;\r\n“Sir,” quoth the herdman, “it is rather past a mile and an half; but,\r\nsir,” quoth he, “ye need to ride apace, for ye shall have a shower of\r\nrain ere ye come thither.” “What,” quoth the scholar, “maketh ye say so?\r\nthere is no token of rain, for the clouds be both fair and clear.” “By\r\nmy troth,” quoth the herdsman, “but ye shall find it so.”\r\n\r\nThe scholar then rode forth, and it chanced ere he had ridden half a\r\nmile further, there fell a good shower of rain, that the scholar was\r\nwell washed, and wet to the skin. The scholar then turned him back and\r\nrode to the herdman, and desired him to teach him that cunning. “Nay,”\r\nquoth the herdman, “I will not teach you my cunning for naught.” Then\r\nthe scholar proffered him eleven shillings to teach him that cunning.\r\nThe herdman, after he had received his money, said thus:--“Sir, see you\r\nnot yonder black ewe with the white face?” “Yes,” quoth the scholar.\r\n“Surely,” quoth the herdman, “when she danceth and holdeth up her tail,\r\nye shall have a shower of rain within half an hour after.”\r\n\r\nBy this ye may see, that the cunning of herdmen and shepherds, as\r\ntouching alterations of weathers, is more sure than the judicials of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon this story it seemeth right to conclude, that to stay at home, when\r\nrain be foreboded by signs natural, is altogether wise; for though thy\r\nlodging be poor, it were better to be in it, and so keep thy health,\r\nthan to travel in the wet through a rich country and get rheums\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\n_Home._\r\n\r\n    Cling to thy home!

The deep\r\nand peculiar hollow tone of this bird in the breeding season, can hardly\r\nbe mistaken for that of any other: it differs essentially from the note\r\nof the same bird when on the wing.\r\n\r\n    The bittern booms along the sounding marsh,\r\n    Mixt with the cries of heron and mallard harsh.\r\n\r\nThe bittern sits all day hid among the reeds and rushes with its head\r\nerect; at night it rises on the wing, and soars to a vast height in a\r\nspiral direction. Those who desire to see it must pursue a swampy route,\r\nthrough watery fens, quagmires, bogs, and marshes. The heron, _ardea\r\nmajor_, has now a nest, and is seen sailing about slowly in the air in\r\nsearch of its fishy prey, travelling from one fish pond to another, over\r\na large tract of country. It is a bird of slow and heavy flight, though\r\nit floats on large and expansive wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 46·57.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 14.~\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\nGenial weather at the commencement of the year, dresses the meadows with\r\nthe common and beautiful flowers that delight childhood.\r\n\r\n_The Cowslip._\r\n\r\n      Cowslip, of all beloved, of all admired!\r\n    Thee let me sing, the homely shepherd’s pride;\r\n    Fit emblem of the maid I love, a form\r\n    Gladdening the sight of man; a sweet perfume,\r\n    Sending its balmy fragrance to the soul\r\n    Daughter of Spring and messenger of May,\r\n    Which shall I first declare, which most extol,\r\n    Thy sovereign beauties, or thy sovereign use?\r\n    With thee the rural dame a draught prepares,\r\n    A nectarous draught, more luscious to my taste\r\n    Than all thy boasted wine, besotted Bacchus!\r\n    Maidens with thee their auburn tresses braid;\r\n    Or, with the daisy and the primrose pale,\r\n    Thy flowers entwining, weave a chaplet fair,\r\n    To grace that pole round which the village train\r\n    Lead on their dance to greet the jocund May;\r\n    Jocund I’ll call it, for it lends a smile\r\n    To thee, who never smil’st but once a year.\r\n    I name thee not, thou poor unpitied wretch!\r\n    Of all despised, save him whose liberal heart\r\n    Taught him to feel your wrongs, and plead your cause,\r\n    Departed Hanway!

The cold spells of winter, that had\r\nkept him so long tongue-tied, and frozen the deep fountains of his\r\nheart, yield before the mild breath of spring, and he is voluble once\r\nmore. It is as if the flood of song had been swelling within his breast\r\never since it last ceased to flow; and was now gushing forth\r\nuncontroullably, and as if he had no will to controul it: for when it\r\ndoes stop for a space, it is suddenly, as if for want of breath. In our\r\nclimate the nightingale seldom sings above six weeks; beginning usually\r\nthe last week in April. I mention this because many, who would be\r\ndelighted to hear him, do not think of going to listen for his song till\r\nafter it has ceased. I believe it is never to be heard after the young\r\nare hatched.--Now, too, the pretty, pert-looking blackcap first appears,\r\nand pours forth his tender and touching love-song, scarcely inferior, in\r\na certain plaintive inwardness, to the autumn song of the robin. The\r\nmysterious little grasshopper lark also runs whispering within the\r\nhedgerows; the redstart pipes prettily upon the apple trees; the\r\ngolden-crowned wren chirps in the kitchen-garden, as she watches for the\r\nnew sown seeds; and lastly, the thrush, who has hitherto given out but a\r\ndesultory note at intervals, to let us know that he was not away, now\r\nhaunts the same tree, and frequently the same branch of it, day after\r\nday, and sings an “English Melody” that even Mr. Moore himself could not\r\nwrite appropriate words to.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·16.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 16.~\r\n\r\nC. L., whose papers under these initials on “Captain Starkey,”[118] “The\r\nAss, No. 2,[119]” and “Squirrels,”[120] besides other communications,\r\nare in the first volume, drops the following pleasant article “in an\r\nhour of need.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONTHS.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nRummaging over the contents of an old stall at a half _book_, half _old\r\niron shop_, in an alley leading from Wardour-street to Soho-square\r\nyesterday, I lit upon a ragged duodecimo, which had been the strange\r\ndelight of my infancy, and which I had lost sight of for more than forty\r\nyears:--the “QUEEN-LIKE CLOSET, or RICH CABINET:” written by Hannah\r\nWoolly, and printed for R. C. & T. S. 1681; being an abstract of\r\nreceipts in cookery, confectionary, cosmetics, needlework, morality, and\r\nall such branches of what were then considered as female\r\naccomplishments. The price demanded was sixpence, which the owner (a\r\nlittle squab duodecimo of a character himself) enforced with the\r\nassurance that his “own mother should not have it for a farthing less.”\r\nOn my demurring at this extraordinary assertion, the dirty little vendor\r\nreinforced his assertion with a sort of oath, which seemed more than the\r\noccasion demanded: “and now (said he) I have put my soul to it.” Pressed\r\nby so solemn an asseveration, I could no longer resist a demand which\r\nseemed to set me, however unworthy, upon a level with his dearest\r\nrelations; and depositing a tester, I bore away the tattered prize in\r\ntriumph. I remembered a gorgeous description of the twelve months of the\r\nyear, which I thought would be a fine substitute for those poetical\r\ndescriptions of them which your _Every-Day Book_ had nearly exhausted\r\nout of Spenser. This will be a treat, thought I, for friend HONE. To\r\nmemory they seemed no less fantastic and splendid than the other. But,\r\nwhat are the mistakes of childhood!--on reviewing them, they turned out\r\nto be only a set of common-place receipts for working the seasons,\r\nmonths, heathen gods and goddesses, &c. in _samplars_! Yet as an\r\ninstance of the homely occupations of our great-grandmothers, they may\r\nbe amusing to some readers: “I have seen,” says the notable Hannah\r\nWoolly, “such Ridiculous things done in work, as it is an abomination to\r\nany Artist to behold. As for example: You may find in some Pieces,\r\n_Abraham_ and _Sarah_, and many other Persons of Old time, Cloathed, as\r\nthey go now a-daies, and truly sometimes worse; for they most resemble\r\nthe Pictures on Ballads.

Then\r\nfor the Hearth of your Chimney, you may lay some Orpan-Sprigs in order\r\nall over, and it will grow as it lies; and according to the Season, get\r\nwhat flowers you can, and stick in as if they grew, and a few sprigs of\r\nSweet-Bryer: the Flowers you must renew every Week; but the Moss will\r\nlast all the Summer, till it will be time to make a fire; and the Orpan\r\nwill last near two Months. A Chimney thus done doth grace a Room\r\nexceedingly.”\r\n\r\nOne phrase in the above should particularly recommend it to such of your\r\nfemale readers, as, in the nice language of the day, have done growing\r\nsome time: “little toad stools, &c. and any thing that is _old and\r\npretty_.” Was ever antiquity so smoothed over? The culinary recipes have\r\nnothing remarkable in them, besides the costliness of them. Every thing\r\n(to the meanest meats) is sopped in claret, steeped in claret, basted\r\nwith claret, as if claret were as cheap as ditch water. I remember Bacon\r\nrecommends opening a turf or two in your garden walks, and pouring into\r\neach a bottle of claret, to recreate the sense of smelling, being no\r\nless grateful than beneficial. We hope the chancellor of the exchequer\r\nwill attend to this in his next reduction of French wines, that we may\r\nonce more water our gardens with right Bourdeaux. The medical recipes\r\nare as whimsical as they are cruel. Our ancestors were not at all\r\neffeminate on this head. Modern sentimentalists would shrink at a cock\r\nplucked and bruised in a mortar alive, to make a cullis; or a live mole\r\nbaked in an oven (_be sure it be alive_) to make a powder for\r\nconsumption.--But the whimsicalest of all are the directions to\r\nservants--(for this little book is a compendium of all duties,)--the\r\nfootman is seriously admonished not to stand lolling against his\r\nmaster’s chair, while he waits at table; for “to lean on a chair, when\r\nthey wait, is a particular favour shown to any superior servant, as the\r\nchief gentleman, or the waiting woman when she rises from the table.”\r\nAlso he must not “hold the plates before his mouth to be defiled with\r\nhis breath, nor touch them on the right [inner] side.” Surely Swift must\r\nhave seen this little treatise.\r\n\r\n  C. L.\r\n\r\nHannah concludes with the following address, by which the self-estimate\r\nwhich she formed of her usefulness, may be calculated:--\r\n\r\n    “_Ladies_, I hope you’re pleas’d and so shall I\r\n    If what I’ve writ, you may be gainers by;\r\n    If not; it is your fault, it is not mine,\r\n    Your benefit in this I do design.\r\n    Much labour and much time it hath me cost,\r\n    Therefore I beg, let none of it be lost.\r\n    The money you shall pay for this my book,\r\n    You’ll not repent of, when in it you look.\r\n    No more at present to you I shall say,\r\n    But wish you all the happiness I may.”\r\n\r\n  H. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, 1788, died, at the age of eighty-one, the\r\nfar-famed count de Buffon, a man of uncommon genius and surprising\r\neloquence, and often styled the “French Pliny,” because, like that\r\nphilosopher, he studied natural history. Buffon was, perhaps, the most\r\nastonishing interpreter of nature that ever existed.[121] His\r\ndescriptions are luminous and accurate, and every where display a spirit\r\nof philosophical observation; but the grand defect of his work is want\r\nof method, and he rejects the received principles of classification, and\r\nthrows his subjects into groups from general points of resemblance. It\r\nmay be more strongly objected, that many of his allusions are\r\nreprehensible; and, as regards himself, though he pretended to respect\r\nthe ties of society, he constantly violated private morals. As an\r\ninstance of his vanity, it is reported that he said, “the works of\r\neminent geniuses are few; they are only those of Newton, Bacon,\r\nLeibnitz, Montesquieu, and _my own_.” He was ennobled by patent; and no\r\nless distinguished by academical honours, than by his own talents. He\r\nleft a son, who, in 1793, was guillotined under Robespierre.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUBBLES.\r\n\r\nWorthless speculations, in recent times, have distressed and ruined\r\nthousands by their explosion; and yet this has happened with the\r\nexperience of former sufferers before us as matter of history. In the\r\nreign of James I., speculators preyed on public credulity under the\r\nauthority of the great seal, till the government interposed by annulling\r\nthe patents. In the reigns of Anne and George I., another race of\r\nswindlers deluded the unthinking with private lotteries and schemes of\r\nall sorts. The consequences of the South Sea bubble, at a later period,\r\nafflicted every family in the nation, from the throne to the labourer’s\r\nhut. So recently as the year 1809, there were similar attempts on a less\r\nscale, with similar results. The projects of 1824-5, which lingered till\r\n1826, were mining companies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the reign of George I., a Mr. Fallowfield issued “proposals for\r\nmaking iron,” wherein he introduces some reflections on the miscarriages\r\nof Mr. Wood’s project of “making iron with _pulverised ore_.”\r\nFallowfield had obtained a patent for making iron with _peat_, but\r\ndelayed some time his putting it in practice, because of the mighty\r\nbustle made by Mr. Wood and his party. The proceedings of the latter\r\nprojector furnish a fact under the present day.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the following statement, that Mr. Wood persisted till\r\nhis scheme was blown into air by his own experiments.\r\n\r\nApril 16, 1731. “The proprietors assert that the iron so _proposed_ to\r\nbe made, and which they actually _did make_ at Chelsea, on Monday, the\r\n16th instant, is not brittle, but tough, and fit for all uses, and is\r\nto be manufactured with as little waste of metal, labour, and expense,\r\nas any other iron; and that it may and can be made for less than 10_l._\r\na ton, which they will make apparent to any curious inquirer.”\r\n\r\nWhether this “call” upon the “curious inquirer” was designed to\r\nintroduce “another call” upon the shareholders is not certain, but the\r\ncall was answered by those to whom it was ostensibly addressed; for\r\nthere is a notice of “Mr. Wood’s operators failing in their last trial\r\nat Chelsea, the 11th instant (May;) their iron breaking to pieces when\r\nit came under the great hammer.”[123] They excused it by saying the\r\ninspectors had purposely _poisoned_ the iron! Had the assertion been\r\ntrue, Wood’s project might have survived the injury; but it died of the\r\npoison on the 3d of May, 1731, notwithstanding the affirmations of the\r\nproprietors, that “they actually did make iron at Chelsea, on Monday the\r\n16th of April.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 47·95.\r\n\r\n  [118] Vol. i 965.\r\n\r\n  [119] Ibid. 1358.\r\n\r\n  [120] Ibid. 1386.\r\n\r\n  [121] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n  [122] General Biog.

He was the son of an innkeeper at Oxford,\r\nwhere he was born in 1605; and after studying at Lincoln-college, became\r\na page to Greville, lord Brooke, a literary nobleman, who encouraged his\r\nattainments. He cultivated acquaintance with the poetic muse, and the\r\neminent wits of his time. His imagination, depraved by sensuality, was\r\nunequal to extensive flights in pure regions. He wrote chiefly to the\r\ntaste of the court, prepared masques for its entertainment, and, on the\r\ndeath of Ben Jonson, had the honour of the laureateship. He served in\r\nthe army of Charles I. against the parliament; was made\r\nlieutenant-general of the ordnance, knighted by the king at the siege of\r\nGloucester, and, on the decline of the royal cause, retired to France,\r\nwhere he became a Roman catholic. In attempting to conduct a French\r\ncolony to Virginia, he was captured by a parliament cruiser, and\r\nimprisoned in Cowes Castle, where he employed himself on “Gondibert,” a\r\nheroic poem, which he never finished. On this occasion his life was\r\nsaved by Milton; and, when public affairs were reversed, Davenant repaid\r\nthe service by protecting Milton.[124]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDavenant’s face was deformed by the consequences of vicious indulgence.\r\nThe deficiency of feature exemplified in his portrait, is referred to by\r\na note on a celebrated line in lord Byron’s “Curse of Minerva.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Davenant and Shakspeare._\r\n\r\nPope is said to have placed Davenant, as a poet, above Donne;[125] but,\r\nnotwithstanding the authority, it is questionable whether Pope’s\r\njudgment could have so erred. He is further said to have observed, that\r\nDavenant “seemed fond of having it taken for truth,” that he was “more\r\nthan a poetical child of Shakspeare;” that he was Shakspeare’s godson;\r\nand that Shakspeare in his frequent journies between London and his\r\nnative place, Stratford-upon-Avon, used to lie at Davenant’s, the Crown,\r\nin Oxford. He was very well acquainted with Mrs. Davenant; and her son,\r\nafterwards sir William, was supposed to be more nearly related to him\r\nthan as a godson only. One day when Shakspeare had just arrived, and the\r\nboy sent for from school to him, a head of one of the colleges (who was\r\npretty well acquainted with the affairs of the family) met the child\r\nrunning home, and asked him, whither he was going in so much haste? The\r\nboy said, “To my godfather, Shakspeare.” “Fie, child,” says the old\r\ngentleman, “why are you so superfluous? have you not learned yet that\r\nyou should not use the name of God _in vain_?” The imputation is very\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 47·00.\r\n\r\n  [124] General Biog.

Without further preface, a large broadside\r\npublication, published at the time, is introduced to the reader’s\r\nattention, as an article of great rarity and singular curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe year wherein this procession took place, is not ascertainable from\r\nthe broadside; but, from the mode of printing and other appearances, it\r\nseems to have been some years before that which is represented in a\r\nlarge two-sheet “Geometrical View of the Grand Procession of Scald\r\nMiserable Masons, designed as they were drawn up over against\r\nSomerset-house, in the Strand on the 27th of April, 1742. Invented, and\r\nengraved, by A. Benoist.”\r\n\r\nIt should be further observed, that the editor of the _Every-Day Book_\r\nis not a mason; but he disclaims any intention to discredit an order\r\nwhich appears to him to be founded on principles of good-will and kind\r\naffection. The broadside is simply introduced on account of its\r\nscarcity, and to exemplify the rudeness of former manners. It is headed\r\nby a spirited engraving on wood, of which a reduced copy is placed\r\nbelow, with the title that precedes the original print subjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Solemn and Stately Procession~\r\n\r\nOF THE SCALD MISERABLE MASONS,\r\n\r\n_As it was martiall’d, on Thursday, the 18th of this Instant, April_.]\r\n\r\nThe engraving is succeeded by a serio-comic Address, commencing thus:--\r\n\r\n  THE REMONSTRANCE _of the Right Worshipful the_ GRAND MASTER, &c. _of\r\n  the_ SCALD MISERABLE MASONS.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS by our Manifesto some time past, dated from our Lodge in\r\nBrick-street, WE did, in the most explicite manner, vindicate the\r\nancient rights and privileges of this society, and by incontestable\r\narguments evince our superior dignity and seniority to all other\r\ninstitutions, whether Grand-Volgi, Gregorians, Hurlothrumbians,\r\nUbiquarians, Hiccubites, Lumber-Troopers, or Free-Masons; yet,\r\nnevertheless, a few persons under the last denomination, still arrogate\r\nto themselves the usurped titles of Most Ancient and Honourable, in open\r\nviolations of truth and justice; still endeavour to impose their false\r\nmysteries (for a premium) on the credulous and unwary, under pretence of\r\nbeing part of our brotherhood; and still are determin’d with drums,\r\ntrumpets, gilt chariots, and other unconstitutional finery, to cast a\r\nreflection on the primitive simplicity and decent economy of our ancient\r\nand annual peregrination: WE therefore think proper, in justification of\r\nOurselves, publicly to disclaim all relation or alliance whatsoever,\r\nwith the said society of Free-Masons, as the same must manifestly tend\r\nto the sacrifice of our dignity, the impeachment of our understanding,\r\nand the disgrace of our solemn mysteries: AND FURTHER, to convince the\r\npublic of the candour and openness of our proceedings, WE here present\r\nthem with a key to our procession; and that the rather, as it consists\r\nof many things emblematical, mystical, hieroglyphical, comical,\r\nsatirical, political, &c.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS many, persuaded by the purity of our constitution, the nice\r\nmorality of our brethren, and peculiar decency of our rites and\r\nceremonies, have lately forsook the gross errors and follies of the\r\nFree-Masonry, are now become true _Scald Miserables_: It cannot but\r\nafford a most pleasing satisfaction to all who have any regard to truth\r\nand decency, to see our procession increased with such a number of\r\nproselytes; and behold those whose vanity, but the last year, exalted\r\nthem into a borrowed equipage, now condescend to become the humble cargo\r\nof a sand-cart.\r\n\r\n  [Then follows the following:]\r\n\r\n  A KEY or EXPLANATION of _the Solemn and Stately Procession of the_\r\n  SCALD MISERABLE MASONS.\r\n\r\n  _Two Tylers_, _or Guarders_,\r\n\r\n  In yellow Cockades and Liveries, being the Colour ordained for the\r\n  Sword Bearer of State.

A considerable number were found\r\nin London, Westminster, Southwark, and the suburbs, with the names of\r\nforty-five “masterless men and cutpurses,” whose practice was to rob\r\ngentlemen’s chambers and artificers’ shops in and about London. They\r\nalso discovered seven houses of entertainment for such in London; six in\r\nWestminster, three in the suburbs, and two in Southwark. Among the rest\r\nthey found out one Watton, a gentleman born, and formerly a merchant of\r\nrespectability but fallen into decay. This person kept an alehouse at\r\nSmart’s quay, near Billingsgate; but for some disorderly conduct it was\r\nput down. On this he began a new business, and opened his house for the\r\nreception of all the cutpurses in and about the city. In this house was\r\na room to learn young boys to cut purses. Two devices were hung up; one\r\nwas a pocket, and another was a purse. The pocket had in it certain\r\ncounters, and was hung round with hawks’ bells, and over them hung a\r\nlittle sacring bell.[127] The purse had silver in it; and he that could\r\ntake out a counter without any noise, was allowed to be a public\r\n_foyster_;[128] and he that could take a piece of silver out of the\r\npurse without noise of any of the bells, was adjudged a clever\r\n_nypper_.[129] These places gave great encouragement to evil doers in\r\nthese times, but were soon after suppressed.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·77.\r\n\r\n  [127] A small bell used in the ceremony of the mass, and rung on the\r\n  elevation of the consecrated host.\r\n\r\n  [128] A pickpocket.\r\n\r\n  [129] A pickpurse, or cutpurse, so called from persons having their\r\n  purses hanging in front from their girdle.\r\n\r\n  [130] Maitland.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 22.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA JEW IS A THIEF!\r\n\r\n    “So runs the proverb; so believes the world.”\r\n\r\nAt least so say a great many who call themselves Christians, and who are\r\nwilling to believe all evil of the Jews, who, in compliment to their own\r\nquestionable goodness, they “religiously” hate, with all the soul of\r\n“irreligion.” The following account of an individual of the Jewish\r\npersuasion, well known to many observers of London characters, may\r\ndisturb their position: it is communicated by a gentleman who gives his\r\nname to the editor with the article.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEW NEAR JEWIN-STREET.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThey who are in the habit of observing the remarkable beings that\r\nperambulate the streets of this metropolis, either for profit or\r\npleasure, must have observed “J. Levy,” not, to use a common phrase, “an\r\n_every-day_ character,” but one who, for singularity of personal\r\nappearance, oddity of dress, simplicity of manner, and constant\r\nindustry, deserves a place in your _Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\nFor the last eighty years has Levy trudged the streets of “London and\r\nits environs,”--followed, latterly, by a dirty lame Jew boy, carrying a\r\nhuge mahogany closed-up box, containing watches manufactured by makers\r\nof all degrees, from Tomkin to Levy of Liverpool--with jewellery of the\r\nmost costly kind, to trinkets of Birmingham manufacture; and, strange to\r\nsay, though his dealings have been extensive to a degree beyond\r\nimagination, he has hitherto given universal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA few evenings since, as I was smoking my accustomed “_every-day_\r\ncigar,” at a respectable house in Jewin-street, and looking quietly at\r\nthe different sorts of persons forming the company assembled, a violent\r\nthumping upon the floor of the passage leading to the parlour, which was\r\ncontinued at an interval of every third second, announced the approach\r\nof some one who clearly imagined himself of no little importance, and\r\nthoroughly disturbed the quaker-like serenity of appearance which then\r\nprevailed in the room. “How is my dear good lady, and all her little\r\nones? and her respectable husband?” inquired the stranger on the\r\noutside. Without waiting for a reply to the two questions, the door was\r\nsuddenly thrown wide open, and in came a tall thin figure of a man, with\r\na face plainly denoting that it had seen at least ninety winters, and\r\nbearing a beard of a dirty gray colour, some inches in length, and\r\ndivided in the centre, but coming from under and above the ears, over\r\nwhich was tied a gaudy red and yellow silk handkerchief, and a huge pair\r\nof heavy costly-looking silver spectacles, which “ever and anon” he\r\nraised from his nose. He wore a coat which had once been blue, the\r\nskirts whereof almost hung to the ground, and were greatly in the\r\nfashion of a Greenwich pensioner’s; a velvet waistcoat with a double row\r\nof pearl buttons, to which was appended, through one of the buttonholes,\r\na blue spotted handkerchief, reaching down to his knees, a pair of tight\r\npantaloons, which evidently had been intended for another, as they\r\nscarcely gained the calf of his leg, and from the fobs whereof were\r\nsuspended two watch-chains with a profusion of seals; and, on his head,\r\nwas a hat projecting almost to points in the centre and back, but narrow\r\nin the sides. In his right hand a huge but well-made stick, wielded and\r\npushed forward upon the ground by a powerful effort, had been the noisy\r\nherald of his approach.\r\n\r\nOn entering the room, he cast an inquiring look upon his astonished and\r\nquiet auditors, and stood for a moment to see the effect of his\r\nappearance: then, after an awful pause, lifting his spectacles to his\r\nnose, and almost thrusting his old but piercing eyes over the cases,\r\nwith a tiger-like step he advanced to the full front of a quiet,\r\ninoffensive, Jack-Robinson-sort-of-a-man who was smoking his pipe, and,\r\nthrowing his stick under his left arm, he took off his huge hat, thereby\r\ndiscovering a small velvet cap on the top of his head, and holding out\r\nhis right hand he exclaimed, “Well, my good friend, how are you? my eyes\r\nare weak, but I can always, yes, always, discern a good friend: how are\r\nyou? how is your good lady? I hope she is in good health, and all the\r\nlittle ones.” The astonished “Christian” looked as if he could have\r\nswallowed the pipe from which he was smoking, on being thus addressed by\r\nthe bearded descendant of Moses, and being absolutely deprived of\r\nspeech, cast an inquiring look of dismay around on his neighbours, who\r\nso far from commiserating his feelings, actually expressed by smiling\r\ncountenances, the pleasure they took in the rencontre. This was adding\r\noil to the fire, when suddenly turning full in the face of the Jew, who\r\nstill held out his hand for a friendly shrug, he exclaimed with a voice\r\nof phrenzy, “My wife knows thee not! I know thee not! My children know\r\nthee not! Leave me! go!” The Jew’s hand was quickly withdrawn, while his\r\nalarmed countenance expressed the terror of his poor soul. The\r\nhumiliated Jew said not a word, but quietly took his seat in the further\r\ncorner of the room, and thence cast his eyes on a clock which was\r\naffixed to the wall, as if afraid of looking on a living object. He\r\nremained some minutes in this pitiable situation. At last, he took from\r\nhis pocket, three or four watches, which he regularly applied to his\r\near, and afterwards wound up; then laying them upon the table, he\r\ntriumphantly looked at the company, and--by his eyes--boldly challenged\r\nthem to produce a wealth, equal to that he exposed to their view.\r\nApparently satisfied, in his own mind, of his superiority as to wealth,\r\nover the man who had so cruelly denied all knowledge of him, he called\r\nin a kind, but a suppressed voice to the servant in attendance,--“Well,\r\nmy dear! bring me a glass of good gin and water, sweet with sugar, mind\r\nlittle girl, and I will gratefully thank you; it will comfort my poor\r\nold heart.” “You shall have it, sir,” said the admiring girl, directing\r\nher attention to the exposed jewellery. They were the first kind words\r\nheard in that room by poor Levy, and they seemed to draw tears from his\r\neyes; for, from his pocket, he brought forth as many handkerchiefs, of\r\nthe most opposite and glowing colours, as the grave digger in Hamlet\r\ncasts off waistcoats, all of which he successively applied to his eyes.\r\nThe girl quickly returned with the required gin and water, and, after\r\nrepeated stirring and tasting, casting an eager look at her, he, with\r\nthe most marked humility, begged “one little, _little_ bit more sugar,\r\nand it would be _beautifuls_,” which was of course granted, and the\r\ngirl at parting was more liberally rewarded by the poor despised Jew,\r\nthan by any other person in the room. Commiserating the feelings of a\r\nseemingly poor, and ancient man, whose religion and singularity of\r\nmanner were his only crime, I spoke to him, and was highly delighted to\r\nfind him infinitely superior to any about him; that is to say, so far as\r\nI could judge, for the greater number plainly showed, that they\r\nconsidered silence a sign of wisdom; probably it was so--with them.\r\n\r\nUpon Levy leaving the room, I found he had lived in one house, in the\r\nneighbourhood, for upwards of sixty years, and borne an irreproachable\r\ncharacter; that no man has ever called on him a second time for money\r\ndue; that from goodness of heart, he has often gave away the fruits of\r\nhis industry, and deprived himself of personal luxuries, to add to the\r\ncomforts of others, without considering whether they were Jew or\r\nGentile; that in his own house, he is liberal of his wine, and of\r\nattention to his guests; and that he does not deny, though he is far\r\nfrom publishing, that he has acquired wealth. And, yet, this honourable\r\nand venerable man, after having reached his ninety-third year, because\r\nof his eccentric costume and appearance, was deprived of the comforts of\r\npassing a happy hour, after the fatigues of the day. This I trust for\r\nthe credit of christianity, and for his sake, is not a circumstance of\r\n“_every-day_.”\r\n\r\n  E. W.

GEORGE’S DAY.\r\n\r\n1826. _King’s birth-day kept._\r\n\r\nFor an account of St. George the patron saint of England, and how he\r\nfought and conquered a cruel dragon, and thereby saved the princess of\r\nSylene from being devoured, see vol. i. p. 496-502.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn St. George’s day, people of fashion were accustomed, even to the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, to wear coats of cloth of blue,\r\nbeing the national colour in honour of the national saint. This,\r\nhowever, seems to be a reasonable conjecture for the custom. Mr.\r\nArchdeacon Nares, and other antiquaries, are at a loss for the real\r\norigin of the usage, which is ancient. In old times there were splendid\r\npageants on this festival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Leicester, the “riding of the George” was one of the principal\r\nsolemnities of the town. The inhabitants were bound to attend the mayor,\r\nor to “ride against the king,” as it is expressed, or for “riding the\r\nGeorge,” or for any other thing to the pleasure of the mayor and worship\r\nof the town. St. George’s horse, harnessed, used to stand at the end of\r\nSt. George’s chapel, in St. Martin’s church, Leicester.[131]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Dublin, there are orders in the chain book of the city, for the\r\nmaintenance of the pageant of St. George to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n1. The mayor of the preceding year was to provide the emperor and\r\nempress with their horses and followers for the pageant; that is to say,\r\nthe emperor with two doctors, and the empress with two knights and two\r\nmaidens, richly apparelled, to bear up the train of her gown.\r\n\r\n2. The mayor for the time being was to find St. George a horse, and the\r\nwardens to pay 3_s._ 4_d._ for his wages that day; and the bailiffs for\r\nthe time being were to find four horses with men mounted on them well\r\napparelled, to bear the pole axe, the standard, and the several swords\r\nof the emperor and St. George.\r\n\r\n3. The elder master of the guild was to find a maiden well attired to\r\nlead the dragon, and the clerk of the market was to find a golden line\r\nfor the dragon.\r\n\r\n4. The elder warden was to find four trumpets for St. George, but St.\r\nGeorge himself was to pay their wages.\r\n\r\n5. The younger warden was obliged to find the king of Dele, (Sylene,)\r\nand the queen of Dele, (Sylene,) as also two knights, to lead the queen,\r\nand two maidens in black apparel to bear the train of her gown. He was\r\nalso to cause St. George’s chapel to be well hung with black, and\r\ncompletely apparelled to every purpose, and to provide it with cushions,\r\nrushes, and other requisites, for the festivities of the day.[132]\r\n\r\nThese provisions and preparations refer to the narrative of the\r\nadventures of St. George already given in vol. i. p. 497.\r\n\r\nSt. George’s day at the court of St. James’s is a grand day, and,\r\ntherefore, a collar day, and observed accordingly by the knights of the\r\ndifferent orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collar of S. S._\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity for mentioning the origin of the collar worn by\r\nthe judges.\r\n\r\nThis collar is derived from S^{ts}. Simplicius and Faustinus, two Roman\r\nsenators, who suffered martyrdom under Dioclesian. The religious society\r\nor confraternity of St. Simplicius wore silver collars of double S. S.;\r\nbetween which the collar contained twelve small pieces of silver, in\r\nwhich were engraven the twelve articles of the creed, together with a\r\nsingle trefoil. The image of St. Simplicius hung at the collar, and from\r\nit seven plates, representing the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. This\r\nchain was worn because these two brethren were martyred by a stone with\r\na chain about their necks, and thus thrown into the Tiber. Sir John Fenn\r\nsays, that collars were in the fifteenth century ensigns of rank, of\r\nwhich the fashions ascertained the degrees. They were usually formed of\r\nS. S. having in the front centre a rose, or other device, and were made\r\nof gold or silver, according to the bearer. He says, that knights only\r\nwore a collar of S. S; but this is a mistake.\r\n\r\nAt the marriage of prince Arthur, son of Henry VII., in 1507, “Sir\r\nNicholas Vaux ware a collar of Esses, which weyed, as the goldsmiths\r\nthat made it reported, 800 pound of nobles.” The collar worn by the\r\njudges is still a collar of S. S. divested of certain appendages.[133]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mint mark in 1630, under Charles I., was St. George; in the reign of\r\nJames I. it was a cross of St. George, surmounting a St. Andrew’s\r\ncross.[134]\r\n\r\n\r\n“GOD SAVE THE KING.”\r\n\r\nThe origin of this air has exercised the researches of numberless\r\nindividuals; whether it has been thoroughly ascertained seems doubtful;\r\nbut it may be suitable to introduce a translation of the words into the\r\nWelsh language, by a celebrated antiquary of the principality, Dr. Owen\r\nPugh. It is printed, verbatim, from a private copy which the editor was\r\nfavoured with by Dr. Pugh in the course of the last summer.\r\n\r\nCORONI SIOR IV.\r\n\r\n    DUW cadwa erom ni,\r\n    Mewn fyniant, clod, a bri,\r\n                        Ein Brenin SIOR;\r\n\r\n    Hir yna o lesâad\r\n    Teyrnasa àr ei wlad,\r\n    Ein gobaith da, ein tad,\r\n                        Ein haelav bor.\r\n\r\n    Ei syn elynion o\r\n    Bob màn gàn warth àr fo\r\n                        Aent hwy i lawr;\r\n\r\n    Dilëa di mòr iawn\r\n    Amcanion brad sy lawn,\r\n    Ac yna deua dawn\r\n                        Dainoni mawr.\r\n\r\n    Màl haul o dirion des\r\n    Tròs BRYDAIN taena les\r\n                        Hir oes ein ior;\r\n\r\n    Ein breintiau, er ein mael,\r\n    Areilied ev yn hael,\r\n    A delo ìni gael\r\n                        Oes hir i SIOR!\r\n\r\n  IDRISON.\r\n\r\n  _Myhevin, 5, 1820._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSt. George’s day was selected at a very early period for the\r\nestablishment of horse-races. An obliging correspondent communicates\r\nsome interesting particulars of their institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HORSE RACING.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Kennington, April 16, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following notice of an ancient race, formerly held near\r\nChester, is, I conceive, worthy preservation in your interesting work,\r\nwhich, I hope, in course of time, will treasure up records of every\r\ncustom, game, or ancient observance, formerly so common in “merry\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lysons, in his “Magna Brittania,” says, there are some old articles\r\nof a race for two bells among the corporation records, the earliest date\r\nof which was in 1512.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTER RACES.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 or 10, Mr. William Lester, mercer, being mayor of Chester, and\r\nMr. Robert Ambrye or Amory, ironmonger, sheriff of the city, at his, the\r\nlast mentioned person’s, own cost, did cause three silver bells to be\r\nmade of good value, which bells he appointed to be run for with horses\r\n“upon _St. George’s Day_, upon the Roode Dee from the new tower to the\r\nnetes, there torning to run up to the watergate, that horse which come\r\nfirst there to have the beste bell; the second to have the seconde bell\r\nfor that year putting in money, and for to--and shuerties to deliver in\r\nthe bells that day twelvemonth.” The other bell was run for the same day\r\nupon the like conditions. This gave rise to the adage of “bearing the\r\nbell.” The bells and a bowl seem to have been brought down to the course\r\nwith great pomp, as the following copy shows, carefully transcribed from\r\nthe original among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum.[135]\r\n\r\n“The maner of the showe, that is, if God spare life and healthe, shall\r\nbe seene by all the behoulders upon S^{ct} George’s day next, being the\r\n23d of Aprill 1610, and the same with more addytion, to continew, being\r\nfor the kyng’s crowne and dignitye, and the homage to the kynge and\r\nprynce, with that noble victor St. George, to be continued for ever, God\r\nsave the Kynge.\r\n\r\n  _It._ ij men in greene evies,[136] set with worke upon their other\r\n  habet, with black heare and black beards, very awgly to behould, and\r\n  garlands upon their heads, with great clubbs in their hands, with\r\n  firr[137] works to scatter abroad, to mantain way for the rest of the\r\n  showe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ one on horseback with the buckler and head-peece of St. George,\r\n  and iij men to guide him, with a drum before him, for the hon. of\r\n  England.\r\n\r\n  _It._ one on horsebacke called Fame, with a trumpet in his hand, and\r\n  iij to guide him, and he to make an oration with his habit, in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ one called Mercury, to descend from above in a cloude, his\r\n  winges and all other matters in pompe, and heavenly musicke with him,\r\n  and after his oration spoken, to ryde on horsebacke with the musicke\r\n  before him.\r\n\r\n  _It._ j called Chester, with an oration and drums before him, his\r\n  habit in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ j on horseback, with the kynge’s armes upon a shield in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ j on horseback, concerninge the kyng’s crowne and dignity, with\r\n  an oration in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ j on horseback with a bell dedicated to the kinge, being double\r\n  gilt, with the kyng’s armes upon, carried upon a septer in pompe, and\r\n  before him a noise of trumpets in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ one on horseback, with the Prince’s armes upon a shield in\r\n  pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ one on horseback, with an oration from the prynce in pompe.\r\n\r\n  _It._ j on horseback, with the bell dedicated to the princes.

They are now held the first entire week in May,\r\nwhich comes as near the original time (old St. George’s day) as\r\npossible. They generally attract a vast assemblage of the fashionable\r\nworld, and the city subscribes liberally to keep up the respectability\r\nof the races.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  ~A.~\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD GUILDFORD CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nMr. Editor,--In “A Tour through the whole Island of Great Britain,” 4\r\nvols. 12mo., there is the following notice of an accident on St.\r\nGeorge’s day, which you will oblige a constant reader by inserting in\r\nthe _Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\n  J. H.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the 23d of April, 1740, the upper church at Guildford, in\r\nSurrey, fell down. It was an ancient building, and not long before,\r\nseven hundred and fifty pounds were expended upon it in repairs. There\r\nwas preaching in it on the Sunday before, and workmen were employed in\r\ntaking down the bells, who, providentially, had quitted the spot about a\r\nquarter of an hour before the accident happened, so that not one person\r\nreceived any hurt, though numbers were spectators. Three bells had been\r\ntaken down, and the other three fell with the steeple, which broke the\r\nbody of the church to pieces, though the steeple received but little\r\ndamage by the fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING IN THE CITY,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nJEMMY WHITTLE.\r\n\r\nAt Laurie and Whittle’s print-shop “nearly opposite St. Dunstan’s\r\nchurch, Fleet-street,” or rather at Jemmy Whittle’s, for he was the\r\nmanager of the concern--I cannot help calling him “Jemmy,” for I knew\r\nhim afterwards, in a passing way, when _every_ body called him Jemmy;\r\nand after his recollection failed, and he dared no longer to flash his\r\nmerriment at the “Cock,” at Temple-bar, and the “Black Jack,” in\r\nPortugal-street, but stood, like a sign of himself, at his own door,\r\nunable to remember the names of his old friends, they called him “_poor_\r\nJemmy!”--I say, I remember at Jemmy Whittle’s there was always a change\r\nof prints in spring-time. Jemmy liked, as he said, to “give the public\r\nsomething alive, fresh and clever, classical and correct!” One print,\r\nhowever, was never changed; this was “St. Dunstan and the Devil.” To any\r\nwho inquired why he always had “that _old_ thing” in the window, and\r\nthought it would be better out, Jemmy answered, “No, no, my boy! that’s\r\n_my_ sign--no change--church and state, you know!--no politics, you\r\nknow!--I hate politics! there’s the church, you know, [pointing to St.\r\nDunstan’s,] and here am I, my boy!--it’s _my_ sign, you know!--no\r\nchange, my boy!” Alas, how changed! I desired to give a copy of the\r\nprint on St. Dunstan’s day in the first volume of the _Every-Day Book_,\r\nand it could not be found at “the old shop,” nor at any printsellers I\r\nresorted to. Another print of Jemmy Whittle’s was a favourite with me,\r\nas well as himself; for, through every mutation of “dressing out” his\r\nwindow it maintained its place with St. Dunstan. It was a mezzotinto,\r\ncalled\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Laughing Boy.~]\r\n\r\n    “In summer’s heat, and winter’s cold.”\r\n\r\nDuring all seasons this print was exhibited, “fresh, and fresh.” At that\r\ntime prints from the Flemish and Dutch masters, and humorous matters of\r\nall kinds, were public favourites. From my early liking to the “Laughing\r\nBoy,” and because, with the merit of good design, it is a superior\r\nspecimen of popular taste at the time I speak of, a copy is at the\r\nservice of that reader, who may perhaps think with “poor Jemmy Whittle,”\r\nthat an agreeable subject is always in season, and that as a worse might\r\nhave been presented, this speaking relatively, is really very pretty.\r\n\r\nI am now speaking of five and thirty years ago, when shop windows,\r\nespecially printsellers’, were set out according to the season. I\r\nremember that in spring-time “Jemmy Whittle,” and “Carrington Bowles, in\r\nSt. Paul’s Church-yard,” used to decorate their panes with twelve prints\r\nof flowers of “the months,” engraved after Baptiste, and “coloured after\r\nnature,”--a show almost, at that time, as gorgeous as “Solomon’s Temple,\r\nin all its glory, all over nothing but gold and jewels,” which a man\r\nexhibited to my wondering eyes for a halfpenny.\r\n\r\nSpring arrives in London--and even east of Temple-bar--as early as in\r\nthe country. For--though there are neither hawthorns to blossom, nor\r\ndaisies to blow--there is scarcely a house “in the city,” without a few\r\nflower pots inside or outside; and when “the seeds come up,” the\r\nLondoner knows that the spring is “come to town.” The almanac, also,\r\ntells him, that the sun rises earlier every day, and he makes his\r\napprentices rise easier; and the shop begins to be watered and swept\r\nbefore breakfast; and perchance, as the good man stands at his door to\r\nlook up, and “wonder what sort of a day it will be,” he sees a basket\r\nwith primroses or cowslips, and from thence he hazards to assert, at\r\n“the house he uses” in the evening, that the spring is very forward;\r\nwhich is confirmed, to his credit, by some neighbour, who usually sleeps\r\nat Bow or Brompton, or Pentonville or Kennington, or some other adjacent\r\npart of “the country.”\r\n\r\nTo the east of Temple-bar, the flower-girl is “the herald of spring.”\r\nShe cries “cowslips! sweet cowslips!” till she screams “bow-pots! sweet,\r\nand pretty bow-pots!” which is the sure and certain token of full spring\r\nin London. When _I_ was a child, I got “a bow-pot” of as many\r\nwall-flowers and harebells as I could then hold in my hand, with a sprig\r\nof sweet briar at the back of the bunch, for a halfpenny--_such_ a\r\nhandful; but, now, “they can’t make a ha’penny bow-pot--there’s nothing\r\nunder a penny;” and the penny bow-pot is not half so big as the ha’penny\r\none, and somehow or other the flowers don’t smell, to _me_, as they used\r\nto do.----\r\n\r\nIt will not do however to run on thus, for something remains to be said\r\nconcerning the patron of the day; and, to be plain with the reader, the\r\nrecollections of former times are not always the most cheering to the\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE.\r\n\r\nThere are some circumstances in the history of Russia which abate our\r\npretensions to our celebrated saint. In that country he is much revered.\r\nHis figure occurs in all the churches, represented as usual, riding on a\r\nhorse, and piercing a dragon with his lance. This device also forms part\r\nof the arms of the Russian sovereign, and is on several of the coins.\r\nCertain English historians have conjectured, that Ivan Vassilievitch\r\nII., being presented with the garter by queen Elizabeth, assumed the\r\nGeorge and the dragon for his arms, and ordered it to be stamped upon\r\nthe current money. But it does not appear that the tzar was created a\r\nknight of the garter; and it is certain that the sovereigns of Moscow\r\nbore this device before they had the least connection with England. In\r\nHackluyt, vol. i. p. 255, Chanceler, the first Englishman who discovered\r\nRussia, speaks of a despatch sent in 1554, from Ivan Vassilievitch to\r\nqueen Mary:--“This letter was written in the Moscovian tongue, in letter\r\nmuch like to the Greeke letters, very faire written in paper, with a\r\nbroade seale hanging at the same, sealed in paper upon waxe. This seale\r\nwas much like the broad seale of England, having on the one side the\r\n_image of a man on horseback in complete harnesse fighting with a\r\ndragon_.”\r\n\r\nRussian coins of a very early date represent the figure of a horseman\r\nspearing a dragon; one particularly, of Michael Androvitz appears to\r\nhave been struck in 1305, forty years before the institution of the\r\norder of the garter in England. From this period, numerous Russian coins\r\nare successively distinguished by the same emblem. Various notions have\r\nbeen put forth concerning the origin of the figure; but it seems\r\nprobable that the Russians received the image of St. George and the\r\ndragon either from the Greeks or from the Tartars, by both of whom he\r\nwas much revered; by the former as a christian saint and martyr, and by\r\nthe latter as a prophet or a deity. We know from history, that in the\r\nfourth or fifth century he was much worshipped amongst the Greeks; and\r\nthat afterwards the crusaders, during their first expedition into the\r\nHoly Land, found many temples erected to his honour. The Russians,\r\ntherefore, who were converted to christianity by the Greeks, certainly\r\nmust have received at the same time a large catalogue of saints, which\r\nmade an essential part of the Greek worship, and there can be no reason\r\nto imagine that St. George was omitted.\r\n\r\nIn a villa of prince Dolgorucki, near Moscow, is an old basso-relievo of\r\nSt. George and the dragon, found in a ruined church at Intermen, in the\r\nCrimea; it had a Greek inscription almost erased, but the words ΑΙΟΟ\r\nΓΕΟΡΓΟΟ, or St. George, and the date 1330, were still legible. As it\r\nappears from this basso-relievo that he was worshipped in the Crimea so\r\nnear the court of Russia when the great dukes resided at Kiof, his\r\nintroduction into that country is easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nStill, it is very likely that the Russians received from the Tartars the\r\nimage of a horseman spearing a serpent, as represented upon their most\r\nancient coins, and which formed a part of the great duke’s arms, towards\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century. The Russians had none before\r\nthey were conquered by the Tartars; and soon after they were brought\r\nunder the Tartar yoke, they struck money. The first Russian coins bear a\r\nTartar inscription, afterwards, with Tartar letters on one side, and\r\nRussian characters on the other; and there is still preserved in the\r\ncabinet of St. Petersburgh, a piece of money, exhibiting a horseman\r\npiercing a dragon, with the name of the great duke in Russian, and on\r\nthe reverse a Tartar inscription.\r\n\r\nThe story of a saint or a deity spearing a dragon, was known all over\r\nthe east; among the Mahometans, a person called Gergis or George, under\r\na similar figure, was much revered as a prophet; and similar emblems\r\nhave been discovered among many barbarous nations of the east. Whether\r\nthese nations took it from the Greeks, or the latter from them, cannot\r\nbe ascertained; for of the real existence of such a person as St.\r\nGeorge, no positive proofs have ever been advanced.\r\n\r\nBut whether the Russians derived St. George from the Greeks or the\r\nTartars, it is certain that his figure was adopted as the arms of the\r\ngrand dukes, and that the emblem of the saint and the dragon, has been\r\nuniformly represented on the reverse of the Russian coins.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the arms, Herberstein, in his account of his embassy to\r\nMoscow in 1518, under Vassili Ivanovitch, has given a wooden print of\r\nthat prince, at the bottom of which are engraved his arms, representing\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\na naked man on horseback, piercing a serpent with his lance. The\r\nequestrian figure in this device has a Tartar-like appearance, and is so\r\ncoarse and rude, that it seems to have been derived from a people in a\r\nfar more uncivilized state of society than the Greeks: add to this, that\r\nthe Greeks always represented St. George clad in armour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·27.\r\n\r\n  [131] Fosbroke’s Dict. of Antiquities.\r\n\r\n  [132] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [133] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [134] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [135] Harl.

MARK’S EVE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n\r\nJOE BROWN--THE CHURCH WATCH.\r\n\r\nSir,--As you solicit communications of local usages or customs, I send\r\nyou some account of the “Watching the church” on St. Mark’s E’en, in\r\nYorkshire. According to the superstitions of some other counties, the\r\neve of St. John’s day is the privileged night for unquiet spirits to\r\nrevisit the upper world, and flit over the scenes of their mortal\r\nexistence. But, in Yorkshire, it was believed by the superstitious and\r\nthe peasantry within these twenty years, and is so still perhaps, that\r\nif a person have the hardihood to place himself within the porch of the\r\nchurch, or in a position which commands the church door, on the ghostly\r\ne’en of St. Mark, (it must be St. Mark, O. S.,) he will see the souls of\r\nthose whose bodies are to be buried at that church the following year,\r\napproach the church in the dead waste and middle of the night. The doors\r\nare flung open by some invisible hand just at twelve o’clock, and the\r\nspirits enter in the rotation their mortal bodies are to die in. This\r\nhour is an epitome of the year; those who are to die soon, enter the\r\nfirst--and those who will almost survive the year, do not approach until\r\nnearly one o’clock, at which time the doors are carefully closed and\r\nsecured as they were in the day. Another remarkable feature in the\r\nshadowy pageant is this; those that come to an untimely end, are\r\nrepresented by their ghostly proxies, in the very article of\r\ndissolution. If a person is to be hanged, or to hang himself, as Burns\r\nsays in his “Tam O’Shanter,”\r\n\r\n    “Wi’ his last gasp his gab will gape.”\r\n\r\nIf the person is to be drowned, his representative will come as if\r\nstruggling and splashing in water, and so on in other cases of premature\r\ndeath. I must likewise mention, that the “church-watcher” pretends he is\r\nfixed in a state of impotence to his seat, during the ghostly hour, and\r\nonly receives the use of his powers of locomotion when the clock strikes\r\none. Another peculiarity attends this nocturnal scene: the souls of\r\nthose who are to be seriously indisposed, likewise join the procession;\r\nthey peep into the church, face about, and return to their wonted\r\nresidences in their slumbering mortal habitations. But the souls of the\r\n_condemned_ enter the church, and are not observed to return.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy at home, I recollect a man who was said to watch the church;\r\nhis name was “Joe Brown.” This man used to inspire my youthful fancy\r\nwith great awe. I was not the only one who regarded him with fear: he\r\ncontrived by a certain mysterious behaviour, to impress weak and\r\nyouthful minds with feelings which bordered upon terror. His person is\r\nvividly imprinted on my memory; his face was broad, his features coarse,\r\nand he had what is called a hare-lip, which caused him to speak through\r\nthe nose, or to _snaffle_, as they term it in Yorkshire. He never would\r\ndirectly acknowledge that he watched the church; but a mysterious shrug\r\nor nod tended to convey the assertion. Two circumstances which took\r\nplace in my remembrance, served to stamp his fame as a ghost-seer. At\r\nthe fair-tide, he quarreled with a young man, who put him out of the\r\nroom in which they were drinking; he told his antagonist that he would\r\nbe under the sod before that day twelve months, which happened to be the\r\ncase. The other circumstance was this; he reported a young man would be\r\ndrowned, who lived in the same street in which my father’s house was\r\nsituated. I well recollect the report being current early in the year.\r\nOn Easter Sunday, a fine young man, a bricklayer’s apprentice went to\r\nbathe in the river Ouse, (which runs by C----d, my native town,) and was\r\ndrowned; this fulfilled his prediction, and made him be regarded with\r\nwonder. Whether excited by the celebrity such casual forebodings\r\nacquired him, or whether a knavish propensity lurked at the bottom of\r\nhis affected visionary abstractedness, this last of the\r\n“church-watchers” turned out an arrant rogue; the latter years of his\r\nexecrable existence were marked with rapine and murder. For a time he\r\nassumed the mask of religion, but the discipline of the sect he joined\r\nwas too strict to suit his dishonest views. He was expelled the society\r\nfor mal-practices, quickly joined himself to another, and afterwards\r\nassociated with a loose young man, who, if alive, is in New South Wales,\r\nwhither he was transported for life. They commenced a system of petty\r\nplunder, which soon increased to more daring acts of robbery and\r\nburglary. They withdrew to a distance from C----d for a time; a warrant\r\nwas out against them for a burglary, of which they were the suspected\r\nperpetrators. They went to a small town where they were not known, and\r\nassumed the disguise of fortune-tellers. “Old Joe” was the “wise man,”\r\nand affected to be dumb, whilst his younger confederate, like a flamen\r\nof old, interpreted his mystic signs. They lodged at a house kept by two\r\naged sisters, spinsters. They found that these females were possessed of\r\na little money, and kept it in a box. One night they gave their\r\nhostesses sweetened ale, in which they had infused a quantity of\r\nlaudanum. One of the poor women never woke again, but the other lived.\r\nThese men were taken up and examined, but liberated for want of proof.\r\nThey afterwards were suspected of having shot the Leeds and Selby\r\ncarrier in the night; at length they were taken for stealing some hams,\r\nand in consequence of their bad character, sentenced to transportation\r\nfor life. The termination of Joe’s life was remarkable; Sampson like, he\r\ndrew destruction on his own head. When about to be embarked for Botany\r\nBay, Joe, either touched by conscience, or through reluctance to leave\r\nEngland, made a confession of his crimes. He and his companion were\r\nremoved from the Isle of Wight to York castle. Joe alone was put on his\r\ntrial, and, though not convicted on his own confession, corroborating\r\ncircumstances of his guilt were produced, and the sister of the poisoned\r\nfemale appeared against him. He was found guilty of the murder, and\r\nexecuted at York, at the Lent assizes of 1809. Sir Simon Le Blanc was\r\nthe judge.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer, perhaps, on the vile actions of this last of the\r\n“church-watchers” than will be amusing to the reader; but he seemed\r\ncompletely identified with the local superstitions of the county. In\r\nsome degree he made them subservient to further his roguish designs, by\r\nassuming the goblin appearance of the “Barguest,” and, with his\r\nauxiliary, turned it to no bad account. This preternatural appearance\r\nalarmed the superstitious, who fled, pursued by the supposed demon. In\r\ntheir panic haste they would leave their doors or gates open, and the\r\nrogues never failed to turn these oversights to good account, plundering\r\nthe house or robbing the premises. This statement is strictly true, they\r\nrobbed several people in this novel and ingenious manner. By the by, it\r\nmay be observed, that the “Barguest” is an out-of-door goblin, believed\r\nby the vulgar to haunt the streets and lanes of country towns and\r\nvillages. Its alleged appearance indicates death, or some great\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Monday, April 24, 1825, the late Henry Fuseli, Esq., R. A. was buried\r\nin St. Paul’s cathedral, and a circumstance occurred at his funeral\r\nwhich ought to be known. A gentleman, whose intimacy with Mr. Fuseli\r\nseems to have been overlooked by the managers of the funeral, was\r\ndesirous of paying the last sad tribute of respect to the remains of his\r\nfriend. He waited the arrival of the body at the cathedral gate, and,\r\nafter the authorized mourners had alighted, joined with others in\r\nfollowing the procession. At the instant that the train from the\r\nmourning coaches had entered the great west doors, they were slammed to\r\nfrom within against all who bore not the undertaker’s habiliments of\r\nwoe, and it was announced that the rest were to go round to the north\r\ndoor. At that door admittance was refused to all who would not pay\r\n“twopence a piece.” Those who “paid twopence” were thus permitted to\r\nhasten and rejoin the train. The corpse on being borne down the stairs\r\nof the vault was then followed as before. Here the door of the vault was\r\nsuddenly thrust against all who were not mourners, _ex officio_, and a\r\nshilling demanded from each of the sympathizing attendants who had not\r\non the funeral garments. Compliance with this further exaction qualified\r\nthem to see the “funeral performed.” This was personally communicated to\r\nthe editor by the gentleman referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·97.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 25.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARK.[139]\r\n\r\nSt. Mark’s day was anciently kept a fast through all the country, and no\r\nflesh eaten upon it. Also upon this, and the three first days of Cross,\r\nor the Rogation week, there were processions by the prior and monks of\r\nDurham to one of the parish churches, and a sermon preached at each.\r\nUpon Holy Thursday was a procession with two crosses, borne before the\r\nmonks, and each in rich copes; the prior in one of cloth of gold, so\r\nmassy that his train was supported. Shrines and relics were also\r\ncarried. Of the two litanies performed twice in the year, the greater\r\nand the less, the first, on St. Mark’s day, was instituted by Gregory on\r\naccount of a pestilence, called also the _black cross_, from the black\r\nclothes worn from weeping and penance; or “peraventure, because they\r\ncovered the crosse and auters with blessed hayres.” The smaller litany\r\nwas sung three days before the Ascension, and was called the rogations,\r\nprocessions, &c., because then a general procession was made, the cross\r\nborne, and bells rung. In the procession of some churches there was a\r\ndragon with a great tail filled full of chaff, which was emptied on the\r\nthird day, to show that the devil after prevailing the first and second\r\nday, before and under the law, was on “the thyrde day of grace, by the\r\npassion of Jhesu criste, put out of his reame.”[140]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 49·57.\r\n\r\n  [139] See vol. i. p. 512, 521, &c.\r\n\r\n  [140] Fosbroke’s British Monachism.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAND STORM.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--Permit me to call your attention to the following description of a\r\nstorm, which may be acceptable to the readers of the _Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL BEAUFOY’S ACCOUNT\r\n\r\n_of a Remarkable Storm._\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 26th of April, 1818, about half-past twelve o’clock, the\r\nneighbourhood of Stanmore was visited by a tremendous storm of hail,\r\nrain, and wind, accompanied by some unusual phenomena. The elevated\r\nsituation of Bushey heath afforded me peculiar facilities for viewing\r\nits progress and effects, which occupied in space about five miles in a\r\ndirect line, and in time about twenty minutes. The morning had been\r\nclose and sultry, the heavens sufficiently clear to enable me to observe\r\nthe transit of the sun over the meridian, the wind variable, the\r\nbarometer 29,000 inches, the thermometer 61°, the hygrometer 52°, and\r\nthe variation of the needle 24° 41′ 46′′ west. I shortly observed the\r\nheavens in the south-east quarter much overcast, and some dense black\r\nclouds forming in that direction, which immediately discharged rain in\r\ntorrents, followed by tremendous hail, lightning, and thunder. In about\r\nhalf an hour the fury of the storm had somewhat abated, when my\r\nattention was attracted to the south-east by an amazing commotion among\r\nthe clouds, which appeared to roll over and into each other with\r\nconsiderable rapidity. Beneath these dark clouds there appeared a small\r\nwhite one, moving with surprising velocity towards the north-west; at\r\nthe same time whirling round in a horizontal direction with prodigious\r\nquickness, accompanied with a horrid noise, which I can only compare to\r\na stunning and most discordant whistle. The form of this white cloud\r\nwas, in the first instance, that of a very obtuse cone with its apex\r\ndownwards, which, during its rotary motion, occasionally approached and\r\nretired from the earth; the tail of the cone elongating continually as\r\nit receded, but on approaching the surface of the ground expanding like\r\nthe lower part of an hour-glass; when it appeared to collect all the\r\nsurrounding air into its immediate vortex, as it rebounded with such\r\nviolence as to root up trees, unroof houses and hayricks, throw down\r\nwalls and in short every thing that impeded its progress. The effects\r\nwere, however, exceedingly partial and irregular, depending apparently\r\non the distance of the mouth of the funnel from such objects as chanced\r\nto come in the course of direction; as also on the area included within\r\nthe vortex, at the times it exerted its powers of destruction. This\r\nwhirlwind appears to have commenced near Mrs. Dickson’s farm, situated\r\nabout one mile to the west of the village of Kenton, in Middlesex; and\r\nfrom thence proceeded in a north by west direction, by compass, over\r\nBellemont, through the orchard adjoining the widow Woodbridge’s cottage,\r\nover Mr. Roberts’s field, Mr. Riddock’s nursery, Mr. Martin’s\r\npleasure-grounds, Mr. Utterson’s plantations, and the marquis of\r\nAbercorn’s to Mr. Blackwell’s premises, where it changed its direction\r\nfrom north by west, to north by east, passing over Bushey village,\r\nthrough Mr. Bellas’s farm and orchard, and finally exhausting its fury\r\nabout a mile and a half further. At Mr. Dickson’s farm it removed some\r\nridge tiles, and part of the thatch of outhouses and hayricks; and on\r\nreaching widow Woodbridge’s orchard it had obtained much greater force,\r\nas it levelled the fruit trees and tore away a greater part of the\r\ntiling of the cottage, against which it carried a wooden building\r\nseveral feet with great violence. In passing through Mr. Roberts’s field\r\nit blew down eleven large elms, the breadth of the tornado at this place\r\nnot exceeding one hundred yards, as was evident from the trifling injury\r\nsustained by the other trees to the right and left. Crossing the road\r\nleading to Stanmore, it entered Mr. Riddock’s nursery, where it did\r\nconsiderable injury to the young trees, and almost entirely stripped one\r\nside of the house, carrying away the thatch of the hayricks, and\r\nunroofing some of the outhouses. A large may-bush that stood in front of\r\nthe greenhouse of Mr. Martin was rooted up, but neither the building nor\r\nglass received the smallest injury; while a shed at the back of the\r\nhouse, and likewise the cow-house which almost adjoined, had many tiles\r\ncarried away. It next entered Mr. Utterson’s plantations, and destroyed\r\nfifty trees, appearing to have selected particular ones to wreak its\r\nfury; for while one was torn up by the roots, those around it were\r\nuntouched, and some were broken in two places as though they had been\r\ntwice subjected to the action of the vortex. On approaching Mr.\r\nUtterson’s cottage the storm divided into two parts, one proceeded to\r\nthe right, the other to the left, as was shown by the thatch remaining\r\nundisturbed, while trees standing both in front and behind the house\r\nwere thrown down. At the extremity of the house the storm seems to have\r\nagain united, as it tore away some wooden paling though completely\r\nsheltered by the building, stripping the tiles of lower outhouses, and\r\nthrowing down a considerable part of the garden wall. At the marquis of\r\nAbercorn’s it passed close by an elm, one of whose branches it carried\r\naway, the remainder being untouched; and it then threw down about\r\nseventy-five yards of garden wall, and leaving an interval of the same\r\nextent uninjured, destroyed thirty more; this seems to imply that the\r\nstorm had here a second time divided. Near this spot one of the\r\nmarquis’s workmen was thrown down by the violence of the wind, and after\r\nbeing rolled over repeatedly, was at length compelled to hold by the\r\ngrass to prevent his being carried further. In passing over the\r\ndovehouse the pigeons were whirled to the ground, and a quantity of\r\npaling was torn up and blown to a great distance. The current of wind\r\nnow proceeded across the road to Mr. Blackwell’s brick-kiln, tearing\r\nfrom its hinges and tumbling into a ditch a fieldgate; levelling\r\nsixty-five feet of the garden wall in one direction, and also the upper\r\npart of another wall running in right angles, in the opposite. The\r\nouthouses at this place were much damaged, but the dwelling-house was\r\nnot touched. After leaving the garden it assailed a large beech, which\r\nmeasured at the base eighteen feet in circumference. My eye happened to\r\nbe fixed on this tree at the moment; the wind commenced by giving its\r\nlarge head a considerable twist, and in an instant tore it up by the\r\nroots. After passing over the gravel pits at Harrow Weald, and a part of\r\nthe village of Bushey, where it nearly unroofed a house, it continued\r\nits course without doing any further mischief until it reached Mr.\r\nBellas’s farm. At this place its effects were very destructive among the\r\nfruit-trees and large elms, besides tearing away the tiles and thatch of\r\nthe house, buildings, and ricks; for here the storm appears to have\r\ncontracted to a width of sixty yards, and its impetuosity to have\r\nincreased in proportion as its breadth diminished. After passing in a\r\nnorth by east direction about a mile and a half further than Mr.\r\nBellas’s farm, its fury most probably subsided, as the only further\r\nmischief I have been able to trace was the destruction of two small elms\r\nin a hedgerow, and whose support had been weakened by digging away the\r\nearth from their roots. I observed when the clouds or vapour from which\r\nall this storm proceeded, enveloped the upper part of the cone in which\r\nMr. Blackwell burns his bricks, the cone appeared to be surrounded with\r\na thick mist, and most violently agitated. I also observed that in its\r\npassage over the gravel pits, it tore up the earth and gravel, not in a\r\nuniform manner, but, as it were, by jumps, leaving intervals between the\r\nvarious points of contact of sometimes one hundred yards and upwards;\r\nand the dreadful whistling noise continued unabated until the cessation\r\nof the storm. This phenomena was at one time within less than a quarter\r\nof a mile of my house; but the trees in the garden were not much\r\naffected by it, though I have reason to believe, from the testimony of\r\nseveral persons, on whose veracity I can rely, that the violence of the\r\nstorm was such as to force them to lay hold of hedges to prevent their\r\nbeing thrown down. Mr. Blackwell, in particular, mentioned that in\r\nreturning from church with one of his children, in order to secure\r\nhimself and boy from being carried away, he was obliged to hold by a\r\nstake. It is further stated on the most respectable authority, that\r\ncattle were seen lifted, or rather driven, from one end of the field to\r\nthe other. There is reason to believe that one or more meteoric stones\r\nfell during the storm; for one of the late marquis of Abercorn’s\r\ngardeners told me he had observed “a large stone about the size of his\r\nfist, descend in nearly a perpendicular direction, after a very dazzling\r\nflash of lightning, not followed by thunder.” At my request he readily\r\nshowed the spot on which it apparently fell; but the place being full of\r\nholes the search was unsuccessful; or it might have fallen into a pond\r\nsituated near the place. I, as well as others, after a flash of\r\nlightning, heard a noise similar to the firing of a large rocket, or\r\nresembling a number of hard substances shot out of a cart.[141]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 49·35.\r\n\r\n  [141] Thomson’s Annals.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 27.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA SPRING WALK ON THE SURREY HILLS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--Having, like Falstaff, “babbled o’ green fields,” I resolved to\r\nvisit them; and a few mornings ago, taking with me a certain talisman\r\nwith his majesty’s head thereon, I bent my steps through the now\r\npopulous town of Walworth, famous, like London, for its “Sir William,”\r\nand in whose history are many things well worthy your notice. Proceeding\r\nthence through Camberwell, I ascended the hill at whose foot quietly\r\nstands the Sunday resort of many town immured beings, the public-house\r\nyclept “the Fox-under-the-Hill.” Here the works of man are intruding on\r\nthe country in villas of various shapes and dimensions, the sight of\r\nwhich would make the former possessors of the land, if they loved their\r\nfields, and could look around them, feel as did the American chief, who\r\ndining one day with some British officers at a house which commanded a\r\nview of the vast lakes and forests formerly the inheritance of his\r\nfathers, was observed to eye the scene before him with melancholy\r\nscrutiny.--“Chieftain,” remarked General ----, “you are sad!” “I am;”\r\nwas his answer, “and how can I be otherwise, when I think of the time\r\nwhen all I look on was the property of my nation; but ’tis gone; the\r\nwhite men have got it, and we are a houseless and a homeless people. The\r\nwhite man came in his bark, and asked leave to tie it to a tree; it was\r\ngiven him--he then asked to build him a hut; it was granted--but how was\r\nour kindness repaid? his hut became a fort, his bark brought in her womb\r\nthe children of the thunder to our shores--they drove us from forest to\r\nforest, from mountain to mountain, they destroyed our habitations and\r\nour people, they rooted up our trees, and have left us but the desert--I\r\n_am_ sad; and how can I be otherwise?” I return from this digression to\r\nascend Herne Hill, the Elysium of many of our merchants and traders,\r\nwhose dwellings look the abodes of happy mortals,--beings, seeking, in\r\nretirement from the busy world, to repay themselves for the anxieties\r\nand fatigues of life with peace and competence.\r\n\r\n    O, how blest is he who here\r\n    Can calmly end life’s wild career;\r\n    He who in the torrid zone,\r\n    Hath the spirit’s wasting known,\r\n    Or pin’d where winter ’neath the pole,\r\n    Through the body wrings the soul,\r\n    Losing in this peaceful spot\r\n    Memory of his former lot.\r\n    And O, how happy were it mine,\r\n    To build me here, ere life decline,\r\n    A cot, ’mid these sequestered grounds,\r\n    With every year three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of Herne Hill I envy you--but I am not a money-getting man, so\r\nit is useless to wish for such a treasure. Proceeding onward, I wind\r\ndown the southern declivity of this lovely Olympus--it _has_ been, ere\r\nnow, to me, a Parnassus, but that is past, and the hoofs of Lancefield’s\r\nsteeds have superseded those of Pegasus.--On the left a quiet green\r\nlane, such as Byron would have loved, leads to Dulwich, famous for its\r\ncollege, and the well paid and well fed inhabitants thereof, and its\r\ngallery of pictures. On the right is an opening as yet unprofaned by\r\nbrick and mortar--the only place now left, from whence a traveller can\r\nview the soft scenery around. I go down this vista, and am rewarded with\r\na beauteous prospect of variegated hills, vallies, meadows, &c. &c. I\r\nagain approach the steep, retracing my path; and descending further,\r\ngreen fields and still greener hedges are on each side of me, studded\r\nwith various wild flowers. At every step I hear the rich music of\r\nnature; the sky-lark is above me singing, heedless if the gled[142] be\r\nin the blue cloud; and at least a score of robins with their full bright\r\neyes, and red bosoms, hopping about me, singing as stout as if it was\r\nwinter, and looking quite as bold. There is a mixture of cheerfulness\r\nand melancholy in their song, which to me is pleasing; now loud and\r\nshrill, and now a long rolling sound like the rising of the wind.\r\nAdvancing, I come in sight of the New Church of Norwood with its\r\nunsightly steeple. Ichabod! the glory of the church has departed. I\r\nnever observe the new churches on the Surrey side of the river, without\r\nimagining their long bodies and short steeples look, from a distance,\r\nlike the rudders of so many sailing barges. Where is the grand\r\noriel--the square tower? what have we in their stead? a common granary\r\ncasement, and a shapeless spire. I again move onward rather tired, and\r\nturning to the left, after a short uphill journey with a charming view\r\non all sides, arrive at “the Woodman,” where the talisman I spoke of\r\nshowed its power, by instantly procuring me good eating and other\r\nrefreshing solace. Here a man might sit for an hour unwearied, better in\r\nhead and heart from the loveliness of the scenery beneath him; and here\r\nI repose,--\r\n\r\n    Inhaling as the news I read\r\n    The fragrance of the Indian weed.\r\n\r\nYou are, I have heard, no smoker; yet there is “a something” in a pipe\r\nwhich produces that tranquillity of mind you so much need; if alone it\r\nis a companion, bringing quiet thoughts and pleasing visions; it is a\r\ngood friend if not abused, and is, above all, a promoter of\r\ndigestion--no bad quality. Below me, yet wearing its livery of brown,\r\nlies the wood, the shadowy haunt of the gypsey tribe ere magisterial\r\nauthority drove them away. Many a pleasant hour have I spent in my\r\nyounger days with its Cassandras, listening to their prophetic voices,\r\nand looking at their dark eyes.\r\n\r\n    O, the dusky hands are ne’er forgot,\r\n      That my palm trac’d,\r\n    Of her I clasp’d, in that calm spot,\r\n      Around the waist;\r\n    I feel the thrill\r\n    Of her fingers still,\r\n      Her dark eyes on me beam,\r\n    O, what joyous thoughts my bosom fill\r\n      Of that sweet dream.\r\n\r\nBut--as the song says--\r\n\r\n    “Farewell to Glenowen\r\n    For I must be going.”\r\n\r\nI proceed; Sydenham lies before me, beyond it in softened distance,\r\nBeckenham and Bromley meet the eye, with Dulwich below--and half hidden,\r\nand afar off, is smoky London, with the Abbey towers and St. Paul’s dome\r\nlooking gloomily grand. In the foreground lies a rich variety of upland\r\nand dale, studded with snow white dwellings. Leaving the wood on my\r\nleft, I reach the reservoir of the canal, and read no less than three\r\nboards threatening with the severest penalties all intruders. Again I am\r\nsurrounded with sky-larks; I watch one leave the grass, he is up nearly\r\na quarter of an hour, and here I meet a man with a dozen or more nests\r\nof young birds, blackbirds, thrushes, and robins, which is very early\r\nfor the latter. Pacing slowly up a quiet lane to the left of the canal,\r\nI arrive at a few delightful cottages on the brow of the hill; below\r\nthem to the south--\r\n\r\n    A lovely prospect opens wide,\r\n    Wave-like hills on every side,\r\n    By human hands diversified.\r\n\r\nSomewhere near the canal, at a brickmaker’s hut, poor Dermody, the Irish\r\npoet, retired sick, and in poverty. Turning to the left I view Forest\r\nHill, the sweetest haunt of my poetic hours, but here, as at every other\r\ndesirable spot for meditation, frowns the warning board, placed by the\r\nhand of envious monopoly--\r\n\r\n    “The law will punish all who enter here.”\r\n\r\nNun Head Hill, the favourite resort of smoke-dried artisans, and other\r\nLondoners, is taken from them, and a narrow path is all that remains for\r\ntheir Sunday promenade. Ruminating on the change I move on, and espying\r\na gap in the hedge, enter a field, where, reclining on the long grass, I\r\nmuse, till, like the shadowy kings in Macbeth, my cares and sorrows pass\r\nbefore me. I listen! it is the music of heaven--numerous skylarks tower\r\naloft, the best I have yet heard; ye that wish for good ones catch them\r\nhere--which advice, if they heard, would doubtless bring them down on me\r\nwith beak and claw. Hark! it is the tit-lark, the harbinger of the\r\nnightingale; he is just come over, and the other will quickly follow:\r\nhe drops from the tallest tree, and sings till earth receives him.\r\nHis song is short, but very sweet; nothing can equal his\r\nrising “Weet--weet--weet--weet--weet--weet--weet,” and dying\r\n“Feer--feer--feer--feer--feer--feer--feer,” and his lengthened\r\n“Snee----jug--jug--jug.” It is from him that the best notes of your\r\ncanaries are obtained; he will sing till July. About the fifteenth, the\r\nfowler will go out, and the nightingale will sell his freedom for a\r\nmeal-worm--how many of us mortals do the same to gratify our appetites!\r\nThe bird now caught will be a good one, which is more than I can say of\r\nthe mortal. He will not yet have paired with the hen, she not having\r\nmade her appearance. The males arrive first, at least so say the\r\ncatchers, but I doubt if they emigrate at all. The tame ones in cages\r\nwhen they leave off song get extremely fat, and are half stupid till\r\nthe season returns; perhaps the wild ones do the same, and retire into\r\nsecrecy during the winter. I merely surmise that such may be the case.\r\n\r\nEvening drawing on, and the wind edging round to the northward, I bend\r\nmy course through Peckham, and again enter the busy haunts of man,\r\nwhere, reaching my home, I sit down and write this for your columns,\r\nhoping it may be acceptable.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.\r\n\r\n  _Kent Road,_\r\n\r\n  _April 14, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 50·20.\r\n\r\n  [142] Hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 28.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIn 1658, during this month, the accomplished colonel Richard Lovelace\r\ndied in the Gatehouse at Westminster, whither he had been committed for\r\nhis devotion to the interests and fortunes of the Stuart family.

Robert Peel, by the Hand-loom Weavers\r\nof Blackburn,” they say--\r\n\r\n“Our dwellings are totally destitute of every comfort.\r\n\r\n“Every article of value has disappeared, either to satisfy the cravings\r\nof hunger, or to appease the clamour of relentless creditors.\r\n\r\n“Thousands who were once possessed of an honest independence gained by\r\nlaborious industry, are now sunk in the lowest depths of poverty.\r\n\r\n“Were the humane man to visit the dwellings of four-fifths of the\r\nweavers, and see the miserable pittance which sixteen hours’ hard labour\r\ncan procure, even of those who are fully employed, divided between the\r\nwretched parents and their starving little ones, he would sicken at the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n“When we look upon our starving wives and children, and have no bread to\r\ngive them, we should consider ourselves still more degraded than we are,\r\nas undeserving the name of Englishmen, were we to withhold our complaint\r\nfrom his majesty’s government, or to abstain from speaking in proper\r\nterms of what we consider the present unparalleled distress which exists\r\namong the weavers; and we implore you, sir, by all the ties which bind\r\nthe patriot to his country, by that anxiety for the welfare of England\r\nwhich you have frequently evinced, to use that influence which you\r\npossess with his majesty’s government towards procuring an amelioration\r\nof the condition of the most injured and oppressed class of his\r\nmajesty’s subjects.”\r\n\r\nThe rev. Joseph Fletcher of Mile-end corroborates these statements by\r\nlocal acquaintance with the districts, and affirms of his own knowledge,\r\nthat “the recent causes of commercial distress have produced\r\nunparalleled misery.”\r\n\r\n“In the town of Blackburn and its vicinity, it has reached its highest\r\npoint of aggravation. At the present crisis, upwards of seven thousand\r\nlooms are unemployed in Blackburn, and nearly fourteen thousand persons\r\nhave been compelled to depend on the bounty of the inhabitants; and as,\r\naccording to the late census, Blackburn contains about twenty-one\r\nthousand inhabitants, two-thirds of the population are in a state of\r\nutter destitution.\r\n\r\n“The remaining number of the middle and higher classes of society, bears\r\na far less proportion to the population than in any part of the kingdom,\r\nwhile the same disproportion exists amidst a teeming and immense\r\npopulation in the villages and hamlets of the district.\r\n\r\n“Thus, the accessible sources of relief are diminished, and the means of\r\nalleviation are not in the power of those whose very dependence for\r\ntheir own supply rests on the destitute themselves.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of the very poor man, while he endures the privations of\r\nhis ordinary condition, is the mere absence of bodily disease; and he\r\npatiently awaits the time when his life shall depart, and his body shall\r\nbe buried at the parish expense, and his family shall walk from his\r\nfuneral into the workhouse. This is his state in the best of times; but,\r\nin a season of general calamity to his class, when the barely sufficient\r\nsources of existence fail, his death is no provision for his wife and\r\nchildren; then the poor are rated for the maintenance of the poor; whole\r\nparishes became paupers; and the district must necessarily be supported\r\nby voluntary contributions throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling of the very poor man is always cheerless; but the abode of\r\nindigence, reduced to starvation, is a cave of despair. Thousands of\r\nfamilies are perishing for lack of food at the moment when this is\r\nwritten. From him who has a little, a little is required--and from him\r\nwho has much, much is required--that the plague of famine be stayed. The\r\ncase is beyond the reach of legislation, but clearly within the power of\r\nassociated benevolence to mitigate. A cry of hunger is gone forth--is\r\nthe ear deaf, that it cannot hear?--are the hands that have been often\r\neffectually stretched forth, shortened that they cannot save?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POOR MAN’S HOME.\r\n\r\n“_Home is home, though it is never so homely._” Exceptions to this\r\nposition are taken by ELIA, who, as regards the poor man, deems it a\r\n“fallacy,” to which “crowded places of cheap entertainment, and the\r\nbenches of alehouses, if they could speak, would bear mournful\r\ntestimony.”--“To them the very poor man resorts for an image of the\r\nhome, which he cannot find at home. For a starved grate, and a scanty\r\nfiring, that is not enough to keep alive the natural heat in the fingers\r\nof so many shivering children with their mother, he finds in the depth\r\nof winter always a blazing hearth, and a hob to warm his pittance of\r\nbeer by. Instead of the clamours of a wife, made gaunt by famishing, he\r\nmeets with a cheerful attendance beyond the merits of the trifle which\r\nhe can afford to spend. He has companions which his home denies him, for\r\nthe very poor man can ask no visiters. He can look into the goings on of\r\nthe world, and speak a little to politics. At home there are no politics\r\nstirring but the domestic. All interests, real or imaginary, all topics\r\nthat should expand the mind of man, and connect him with a sympathy to\r\ngeneral existence, are crushed in the absorbing consideration of food to\r\nbe obtained for the family. Beyond the price of bread, news is senseless\r\nand impertinent. At home there is no larder. Here there is at least a\r\nshow of plenty; and while he cooks his lean scrap of butcher’s meat\r\nbefore the common bars, or munches his humble cold viands, his relishing\r\nbread and cheese with an onion, in a corner, where no one reflects upon\r\nhis poverty, he has sight of the substantial joint providing for the\r\nlandlord and his family. He takes an interest in the dressing of it; and\r\nwhile he assists in removing the trivet from the fire, he feels that\r\nthere is such a thing as beef and cabbage, which he was beginning to\r\nforget at home. All this while he deserts his wife and children. But\r\nwhat wife, and what children? Prosperous men, who object to this\r\ndesertion, image to themselves some clean contented family like that\r\nwhich they go home to. But look at the countenance of the poor wives who\r\nfollow and persecute their good man to the door of the public-house,\r\nwhich he is about to enter, when something like shame would restrain\r\nhim, if stronger misery did not induce him to pass the threshold. That\r\nface, ground by want, in which every cheerful, every conversable\r\nlineament has been long effaced by misery,--is that a face to stay at\r\nhome with? is it more a woman, or a wild cat? alas! it is the face of\r\nthe wife of his youth, that once smiled upon him. It can smile no\r\nlonger. What comforts can it share? what burdens can it lighten? Oh, it\r\nis a fine thing to talk of the humble meal shared together. But what if\r\nthere be no bread in the cupboard? The innocent prattle of his children\r\ntakes out the sting of a man’s poverty. But the children of the very\r\npoor do not prattle. It is none of the least frightful features in that\r\ncondition, that there is no childishness in its dwellings. Poor people,\r\nsaid a sensible old nurse to us once, do not bring up their children;\r\nthey _drag_ them up. The little careless darling of the wealthier\r\nnursery, in their hovel is transformed betimes into a premature\r\nreflecting person. No one has time to dandle it, no one thinks it worth\r\nwhile to coax it, to soothe it, to toss it up and down, to humour it.\r\nThere is none to kiss away its tears. If it cries, it can only be\r\nbeaten. It has been prettily said, that a babe is fed with milk and\r\npraise. But the aliment of this poor babe was thin, unnourishing; the\r\nreturn to its little baby-tricks, and efforts to engage attention,\r\nbitter ceaseless objurgation. It never had a toy, or knew what a coral\r\nmeant. It grew up without the lullaby of nurses; it was a stranger to\r\nthe patient fondle, the hushing caress, the attracting novelty, the\r\ncostlier plaything, or the cheaper off-hand contrivance to divert the\r\nchild; the prattled nonsense, (best sense to it,) the wise\r\nimpertinencies, the wholesome lies, the apt story interposed, that puts\r\na stop to present sufferings, and awakens the passion of young wonder.\r\nIt was never sung to, no one ever told to it a tale of the nursery. It\r\nwas dragged up, to live or to die as it happened. It had no young\r\ndreams. It broke at once into the iron realities of real life. A child\r\nexists not for the very poor as any object of dalliance; it is only\r\nanother mouth to be fed, a pair of little hands to be betimes inured to\r\nlabour. It is the rival, till it can be the co-operator, for food with\r\nthe parent. It is never his mirth, his diversion, his solace; it never\r\nmakes him young again, with recalling his young times. The children of\r\nthe very poor have no young times. It makes the very heart to bleed to\r\noverhear the casual street-talk, between a poor woman and her little\r\ngirl, a woman of the better sort of poor, in a condition rather above\r\nthe squalid beings which we have been contemplating. It is not of toys,\r\nof nursery books, of summer holidays (fitting that age); of the promised\r\nsight, or play; of praised sufficiency at school. It is of mangling and\r\nclear starching, of the price of coals, or of potatoes. The questions of\r\nthe child, that should be the very outpourings of curiosity in idleness,\r\nare marked with forecast and melancholy providence. It has come to be a\r\nwoman, before it was a child. It has learned to go to market; it\r\nchaffers. It haggles, it envies, it murmurs; it is knowing, acute,\r\nsharpened; it never prattles. Had we not reason to say that the home of\r\nthe very poor is no home?”[143]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 49·02.\r\n\r\n  [143] New Monthly Magazine, March, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n~April 30.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1745, the battle of Fontenoy was fought between\r\nthe allied armies of England, Holland, and Austria, under the command of\r\nthe duke of Cumberland, and a superior French army, under marshal count\r\nDe Saxe. Here the advantage of the day was to the French; the duke of\r\nCumberland left his sick and wounded to the humanity of the victors, and\r\nLouis XV. obtained the mastery of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe battle was commenced with the formal politeness of a court minuet.\r\nCaptain Lord Charles Hay, of the English guards, advanced from the ranks\r\nwith his hat off; at the same moment, lieutenant count D’Auteroche, of\r\nthe French guards, advanced also, uncovered, to meet him. Lord Charles\r\nbowed:--“Gentleman of the French guards,” said he, “fire!” The count\r\nbowed to lord Charles. “No my lord,” he answered, “we never fire first!”\r\nThey again bowed; each resumed his place in his own ranks; and after\r\nthese testimonies of “high consideration,” the bloody conflict\r\ncommenced, and there was a carnage of twelve thousand men on each side.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 50·57.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Also, in calendars, the month of May\r\n    Is marked the month of Love--two lovers stray,\r\n      In the old wood-cuts, in a forest green,\r\n    Looking their love into each other’s eyes\r\n    And dreaming happiness that never dies;\r\n      And there they talk unheard, and walk unseen,\r\n    Save by the birds, who chant a louder lay\r\n    To welcome such true lovers with the May.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nThe month of May was deemed by the Romans to be under the protection of\r\nApollo; and it being the month wherein they made several expiations,\r\nthey prohibited marrying in May. On the first day of May the Roman\r\nladies sacrificed to _Bona Dea_, the Good Goddess, or the Earth,\r\nrepresented in the _Frontispiece_ to the first volume of the _Every-Day\r\nBook_, with the zodiacal signs of the celestial system, which influences\r\nour sphere to produce its fruits in due order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is in May that “Spring is with us once more pacing the earth in all\r\nthe primal pomp of her beauty, with flowers and soft airs and the song\r\nof birds every where about her, and the blue sky and the bright clouds\r\nabove. But there is one thing wanting, to give that happy completeness\r\nto her advent, which belonged to it in the elder times; and without\r\nwhich it is like a beautiful melody without words, or a beautiful flower\r\nwithout scent, or a beautiful face without a soul. The voice of man is\r\nno longer heard, hailing her approach as she hastens to bless him; and\r\nhis choral symphonies no longer meet and bless _her_ in return--bless\r\nher by letting her behold and hear the happiness that she comes to\r\ncreate. The soft songs of women are no longer blended with her breath as\r\nit whispers among the new leaves; their slender feet no longer trace\r\n_her_ footsteps in the fields and woods and wayside copses, or dance\r\ndelighted measures round the flowery offerings that she prompted their\r\nlovers to place before them on the village green. Even the little\r\nchildren themselves, that have an instinct for the spring, and feel it\r\nto the very tips of their fingers, are permitted to let May come upon\r\nthem, without knowing from whence the impulse of happiness that they\r\nfeel proceeds, or whither it tends. In short,\r\n\r\n    ‘All the earth is gay;\r\n    Land and sea\r\n    Give themselves up to jollity,\r\n    And with the heart of May\r\n    Doth every beast keep holiday:’\r\n\r\nwhile man, man alone, lets the season come without glorying in it; and\r\nwhen it goes he lets it go without regret; as if ‘all seasons and their\r\nchange’ were alike to him; or rather, as if he were the lord of all\r\nseasons, and they were to do homage and honour to him, instead of he to\r\nthem! How is this? Is it that we have ‘sold our birthright for a mess of\r\npottage?’--that we have bartered ‘our being’s end and aim’ for a purse\r\nof gold? Alas! thus it is:\r\n\r\n    ‘The world is too much with us; late and soon,\r\n      Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:\r\n      Little we see in nature that is ours;\r\n    We have given our hearts away--a sordid boon!’\r\n\r\n--But be this as it may, we are still able to _feel_ what nature is,\r\nthough we have in a great measure ceased to _know_ it; though we have\r\nchosen to neglect her ordinances, and absent ourselves from her\r\npresence, we still retain some instinctive reminiscences of her beauty\r\nand her power; and every now and then the sordid walls of those mud\r\nhovels which we have built for ourselves, and choose to dwell in, fall\r\ndown before the magic touch of our involuntary fancies, and give us\r\nglimpses into ‘that imperial palace whence we came,’ and make us yearn\r\nto return thither, though it be but in thought.\r\n\r\n    ‘Then sing ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!\r\n      And let the young lambs bound\r\n      As to the tabor’s sound!\r\n    We _in thought_ will join your throng,\r\n      Ye that pipe and ye that play,\r\n      Ye that through your hearts to-day\r\n      Feel the gladness of the MAY!’”[144]\r\n\r\n  [144] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 1.~\r\n\r\n_St. Philip and St. James._[145]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY DAY.\r\n\r\nAs we had some agreeable intimacies to-day last year, we will seek our\r\ncountry friends in other rural parts, this “May morning,” and see “how\r\nthey _do_.”\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the custom of going “a Maying,” described in volume i., a\r\nsong still used on that occasion is subjoined:--\r\n\r\nTHE MAYER’S CALL.\r\n\r\n    Come, lads, with your bills,\r\n      To the wood we’ll away,\r\n    We’ll gather the boughs,\r\n      And we’ll celebrate May.\r\n\r\n    We’ll bring our load home,\r\n      As we’ve oft done before,\r\n    And leave a green bough,\r\n      At each good master’s  }\r\n            good neighbour’s } door.\r\n            pretty maid’s    }\r\n\r\n    To-morrow, when work’s done,\r\n      I hold it no wrong,\r\n    If we go round in ribands,\r\n      And sing them a song.\r\n\r\n    Come, lads, bring your bills,\r\n      To the wood we’ll away,\r\n    We’ll gather the boughs,\r\n      And we’ll celebrate May.\r\n\r\nThere is a rural ditty chanted in villages and country towns,\r\npreparatory to gathering the May:--\r\n\r\nTHE MAY EVE SONG.\r\n\r\n    If we should wake you from your sleep,\r\n      Good people listen now,\r\n    Our yearly festival we keep,\r\n      And bring a Maythorn bough.\r\n\r\n    An emblem of the world it grows,\r\n      The flowers its pleasures are,\r\n    But many a thorn bespeaks its woes,\r\n      Its sorrow and its care.\r\n\r\n    Oh! sleep you then, and take your rest,\r\n      And, when the day shall dawn,\r\n    May you awake in all things blest--\r\n      A May without a thorn.\r\n\r\n    And when, to-morrow we shall come\r\n      Oh! treat us not with scorn;\r\n    From out your bounty give us some--\r\n      Be May without a thorn.\r\n\r\n    May He, who makes the May to blow,\r\n      On earth his riches sheds,\r\n    Protect thee against every woe,\r\n      Shower blessings on thy heads.\r\n\r\nAfter “bringing home the May,” here is another lay:--\r\n\r\nTHE MAYER’S SONG.\r\n\r\n    On the Mayers deign to smile,\r\n      Master, mistress, hear our song,\r\n    Listen but a little while,\r\n      We will not detain you long.\r\n\r\n    Life with us is in its spring,\r\n      We enjoy a blooming May,\r\n    Summer will its labour bring,\r\n      Winter has its pinching day.\r\n\r\n    Yet the blessing we would use\r\n      Wisely--it is reason’s part--\r\n    Those who youth and health abuse,\r\n      Fail not in the end to smart.\r\n\r\n    Mirth we love--the proverb says,\r\n      Be ye merry but be wise,\r\n    We will walk in wisdom’s ways,\r\n      There alone true pleasure lies.\r\n\r\n    May, that now is in its bloom,\r\n      All so fragrant and so fair,\r\n    When autumn and when winter come,\r\n      Shall its useful berries bear.\r\n\r\n    We would taste your home-brew’d beer,--\r\n      Give not, if we’ve had enough,--\r\n    May it strengthen, may it cheer,\r\n      Waste not e’er the precious stuff.\r\n\r\n    We of money something crave,\r\n      For ourselves we ask no share,\r\n    John and Jane the whole shall have,\r\n      They’re the last new married pair.\r\n\r\n    May it comfort to them prove,\r\n      And a blessing bring to you;\r\n    Blessings of connubial love,\r\n      Light on all like morning dew.\r\n\r\n    So shall May, with blessings crown’d,\r\n      Welcom’d be by old and young,\r\n    Often as the year comes round,\r\n      Shall the May-day song be sung.\r\n\r\n    Fare ye well, good people all,\r\n      Sweet to-night may be your rest,\r\n    Every blessing you befall,\r\n      Blessing others you are blest.\r\n\r\nAs the day advances, a ballad suitable to the “village sports” is sung\r\nby him who has the honour to crown his lass as the “May-day queen.”--\r\n\r\nTHE WREATH OF MAY.\r\n\r\n    This slender rod of leaves and flowers,\r\n      So fragrant and so gay,\r\n    Produce of spring’s serener hours,\r\n      Peculiarly is May.\r\n\r\n    This slender rod, the hawthorn bears,\r\n      And when its bloom is o’er,\r\n    Its ruby berries then it wears,\r\n      The songster’s winter store.\r\n\r\n    Then, though it charm the sight and smell,\r\n      In spring’s delicious hours,\r\n    The feather’d choir its praise shall tell,\r\n      ’Gainst winter round us lowers.\r\n\r\n    O then, my love, from me receive,\r\n      This beauteous hawthorn spray,\r\n    A garland for thy head I’ll weave,\r\n      Be thou my queen of May.\r\n\r\n    Love and fragrant as these flowers,\r\n      Live pure as thou wert born,\r\n    And ne’er may sin’s destructive powers,\r\n      Assail thee with its thorn.\r\n\r\nOne more ditty, a favourite in many parts of England, is homely, but\r\nthere is a prettiness in its description that may reconcile it to the\r\nadmirers of a “country life:”--\r\n\r\nTHE MAY DAY HERD.\r\n\r\n    Now at length ’tis May-day morn,\r\n    And the herdsman blows his horn;\r\n    Green with grass the common now,\r\n    Herbage bears for many a cow.\r\n\r\n    Too long in the straw yard fed,\r\n    Have the cattle hung their head,\r\n    And the milk did well nigh fail,\r\n    The milk-maid in her ashen pail.\r\n\r\n    Well the men have done their job,\r\n    Every horn has got its knob;\r\n    Nor shall they each other gore,\r\n    Not a bag, or hide, be tore.\r\n\r\n    Yet they first a fight maintain,\r\n    Till one cow the mastery gain;\r\n    They, like man, for mastery strive,\r\n    They by others’ weakness thrive.\r\n\r\n    Drive them gently o’er the lawn,\r\n    Keep them from the growing corn;\r\n    When the common they shall gain,\r\n    Let them spread wide o’er the plain.\r\n\r\n    Show them to the reedy pool,\r\n    There at noon their sides they’ll cool,\r\n    And with a wide whisking tail,\r\n    Thrash the flies as with a flail.\r\n\r\n    Bring them gently home at eve,\r\n    That their bags they may relieve,\r\n    And themselves of care divest,\r\n    Chew the cud and take their rest.\r\n\r\n    Now the dairy maid will please,\r\n    To churn her butter, set her cheese;\r\n    We shall have the clotted cream,\r\n    The tea-table’s delightful theme.\r\n\r\n    Raise the song, then, let us now,\r\n    Sing the healthful, useful cow,\r\n    England well the blessing knows,\r\n    A land with milk that richly flows.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay-day is a _Spring_ day.\r\n\r\nSpring--“the _innocent_ spring,” is the firstling of revolving nature;\r\nand in the first volume, is symbolized by an infant. In that engraving\r\nthere is a sort of appeal to parental feeling; yet an address more\r\ntouching to the heart is in the following little poem:--\r\n\r\n_A Mother to her First-born._\r\n\r\n    ’Tis sweet to watch thee in thy sleep,\r\n      When thou, my boy, art dreaming;\r\n    ’Tis sweet, o’er thee a watch to keep,\r\n    To mark the smile that seems to creep\r\n      O’er thee like daylight gleaming.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis sweet to mark thy tranquil breast,\r\n      Heave like a small wave flowing;\r\n    To see thee take thy gentle rest,\r\n    With nothing save fatigue opprest,\r\n      And health on thy cheek glowing.\r\n\r\n    To see thee now, or when awake,\r\n      Sad thoughts, alas! steal o’er me;\r\n    For thou, in time, a part must take,\r\n    That may thy fortunes mar or make,\r\n      In the wide world before thee.\r\n\r\n    But I, my child, have hopes of thee,\r\n      And may they ne’er be blighted!--\r\n    That I, years hence, may live to see\r\n    Thy name as dear to all as me,\r\n      Thy virtues well requited.\r\n\r\n    I’ll watch thy dawn of joys, and mould\r\n      Thy little mind to duty--\r\n    I’ll teach thee words, as I behold\r\n    Thy faculties like flowers unfold,\r\n      In intellectual beauty.\r\n\r\n    And then, perhaps, when I am dead,\r\n      And friends around me weeping--\r\n    Thoul’t see me to my grave, and shed\r\n    A tear upon my narrow bed,\r\n      Where I shall then be sleeping!\r\n\r\n  BARTON WILFORD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Maypole nearest to the metropolis, that stood the longest within the\r\nrecollection of the editor, was near Kennington-green, at the back of\r\nthe houses, at the south corner of the Workhouse-lane, leading from the\r\nVauxhall-road to Elizabeth-place. The site was then nearly vacant, and\r\nthe Maypole was in the field on the south side of the Workhouse-lane,\r\nand nearly opposite to the Black Prince public-house. It remained till\r\nabout the year 1795, and was much frequented, particularly by milk\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA delightfully pretty print of a merry-making “round about the\r\n_Maypole_,” supplies an engraving on the next page illustrative of the\r\nprevailing tendency of this work, and the simplicity of rural manners.\r\nIt is not so sportive as the dancings about the Maypoles near London\r\nformerly; there is nothing of the boisterous rudeness which must be well\r\nremembered by many old Londoners on May-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Country Maypole.~]\r\n\r\n    It is a pleasant sight, to see\r\n    A little village company\r\n    Drawn out upon the first of May\r\n    To have their annual holiday:--\r\n    The pole hung round with garlands gay;\r\n    The young ones footing it away;\r\n    The aged cheering their old souls\r\n    With recollections and their bowls;\r\n    Or, on the mirth and dancing failing,\r\n    Their oft-times-told old tales re-taleing.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nThe innocent and the unaspiring may always be happy. Their pleasures\r\nlike their knitting needles, and hedging gloves, are easily purchased,\r\nand when bestowed are estimated as distinctions. The late Dr. Parr, the\r\nfascinating converser, the skilful controverter, the first Greek\r\nscholar, and one of the greatest and most influential men of the age,\r\nwas a patron of May-day sports. Opposite his parsonage-house at Hatton,\r\nnear Warwick, on the other side of the road, stood the parish Maypole,\r\nwhich on the annual festival was dressed with garlands, surrounded by a\r\nnumerous band of villagers. The doctor was “first of the throng,” and\r\ndanced with his parishioners the gayest of the gay. He kept the large\r\ncrown of the Maypole in a closet of his house, from whence it was\r\nproduced every May-day, with fresh flowers and streamers preparatory to\r\nits elevation, and to the doctor’s own appearance in the ring. He always\r\nspoke of this festivity as one wherein he joined with peculiar delight\r\nto himself, and advantage to his neighbours. He was deemed eccentric,\r\nand so he was; for he was never proud to the humble, nor humble to the\r\nproud. His eloquence and wit elevated humility, and crushed insolence;\r\nhe was the champion of the oppressed, a foe to the oppressor, a friend\r\nto the friendless, and a brother to him who was ready to perish. Though\r\na prebend of the church with university honours, he could afford to make\r\nhis parishoners happy without derogating from his ecclesiastical\r\ndignities, or abatement of self-respect, or lowering himself in the eyes\r\nof any who were not inferior in judgment, to the most inferior of the\r\nvillagers of Hatton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFormerly a pleasant character dressed out with ribands and flowers,\r\nfigured in village May-games under the name of\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACK-O’-THE-GREEN.]\r\n\r\nThe Jack-o’-the-Greens would sometimes come into the suburbs of London,\r\nand amuse the residents by rustic dancing. The last of them, that I\r\nremember, were at the Paddington May-dance, near the “Yorkshire Stingo,”\r\nabout twenty years ago, from whence, as I heard, they diverged to\r\nBayswater, Kentish-town, and adjoining neighbourhoods. A\r\nJack-o’-the-Green always carried a long walking stick with floral\r\nwreaths; he whisked it about in the dance, and afterwards walked with it\r\nin high estate like a lord mayor’s footman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn this first of the month we cannot pass the poets without listening to\r\ntheir carols, as we do, in our walks, to the songs of the spring birds\r\nin their thickets.\r\n\r\nTO MAY.\r\n\r\n    Welcome! dawn of summer’s day,\r\n    Youthful, verdant, balmy May!\r\n    Sunny fields and shady bowers,\r\n    Spangled meads and blooming flowers,\r\n    Crystal fountains--limpid streams,\r\n    Where the sun of nature beams,\r\n    As the sigh of morn reposes,\r\n    Sweetly on its bed of roses!\r\n    Welcome! scenes of fond delight,\r\n    Welcome! eyes with rapture bright--\r\n    Maidens’ sighs--and lovers’ vows--\r\n    Fluttering hearts--and open brows!\r\n    And welcome all that’s bright and gay,\r\n    To hail the balmy dawn of May!\r\n\r\n  _J. L. Stevens._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of our bards makes noble melody in this glorious month.\r\nMr. Leigh Hunt selects a delightful passage from Chaucer, and compares\r\nit with Dryden’s paraphrase:--\r\n\r\nIt is sparkling with young manhood and a gentle freshness. What a burst\r\nof radiant joy is in the second couplet; what a vital quickness in the\r\ncomparison of the horse, “starting as the fire;” and what a native and\r\nhappy case in the conclusion!\r\n\r\n    The busy lark, the messenger of day,\r\n    Saleweth[146] in her song the morrow gray;\r\n    And fiery Phœbus riseth up so bright,\r\n    That all the orient laugheth of the sight;\r\n    And with his stremès drieth in the greves[147]\r\n    The silver droppès hanging in the leaves;\r\n    And Arcite, that is in the court real[148]\r\n    With Theseus the squier principal,\r\n    Is risen, and looketh on the merry day;\r\n    And for to do his observance to May,\r\n    Remembring on the point of his desire,\r\n    He on the courser, starting as the fire;\r\n    Is risen to the fieldès him to play,\r\n    Out of the court, were it a mile or tway.\r\n    And to the grove, of which that I you told,\r\n    By àventure his way he gan to hold,\r\n    To maken him a garland of the greves,\r\n    Were it of woodbind or of hawthorn leaves,\r\n    And loud he sung against the sunny sheen:\r\n    “O May, with all thy flowers and thy green,\r\n    Right welcome be thou, fairè freshè May:\r\n    I hope that I some green here getten may.”\r\n    And from his courser, with a lusty heart,\r\n    Into the grove full hastily he start,\r\n    And in a path he roamed up and down.\r\n\r\nDryden falls short in the freshness and feeling of the sentiment. His\r\nlines are beautiful; but they do not come home to us with so happy and\r\ncordial a face. Here they are. The word morning in the first line, as\r\nit is repeated in the second, we are bound to consider as a slip of the\r\npen; perhaps for mounting.\r\n\r\n    The morning-lark, the messenger of day,\r\n    Saluteth in her song the morning gray;\r\n    And soon the sun arose with beams so bright,\r\n    That all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight\r\n    He with his tepid rays the rose renews,\r\n    And licks the drooping leaves, and dries the dews;\r\n    When Arcite left his bed, resolv’d to pay\r\n    Observance to the month of merry May:\r\n    Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode,\r\n    That scarcely prints the turf on which he trod:\r\n    At ease he seemed, and prancing o’er the plains,\r\n    Turned only to the grove his horses’ reins,\r\n    The grove I named before; and, lighted there,\r\n    A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair\r\n    Then turned his face against the rising day,\r\n    And raised his voice to welcome in the May\r\n    “For thee, sweet month, the groves green liveries wear,\r\n    If not the first, the fairest of the year:\r\n    For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours,\r\n    And Nature’s ready pencil paints the flowers:\r\n    When thy short reign is past, the feverish sun\r\n    The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on.\r\n    So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight,\r\n    Nor goats with venom’d teeth thy tendrils bite,\r\n    As thou shalt guide my wandering steps to find\r\n    The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind.”\r\n    His vows address’d, within the grove he stray’d.\r\n\r\n“How poor,” says Mr. Hunt, “is this to Arcite’s leaping from his courser\r\n‘with a lusty heart.’ How inferior the common-place of the ‘fiery\r\nsteed,’ which need not involve any actual notion in the writer’s mind,\r\nto the courser ‘starting as the fire;’--how inferior the turning his\r\nface to ‘the rising day,’ and ‘raising his voice,’ to the singing ‘loud\r\nagainst the sunny sheen;’ and lastly, the whole learned invocation and\r\nadjuration of May, about guiding his ‘wandering steps’ and ‘so may thy\r\ntender blossoms’ &c. to the call upon the fair fresh May, ending with\r\nthat simple, quick-hearted line, in which he hopes he shall get ‘some\r\ngreen here;’ a touch in the happiest taste of the Italian vivacity.\r\nDryden’s genius, for the most part, wanted faith in nature. It was too\r\ngross and sophisticate. There was as much difference between him and his\r\noriginal, as between a hot noon in perukes at St. James’s, and one of\r\nChaucer’s lounges on the grass, of a May morning. All this worship of\r\nMay is over now. There is no issuing forth in glad companies to gather\r\nboughs; no adorning of houses with ‘the flowery spoil;’ no songs, no\r\ndances, no village sports and coronations, no courtly-poetries, no sense\r\nand acknowledgment of the quiet presence of nature, in grove or glade.\r\n\r\n    O dolce primavera, o fior novelli,\r\n    O aure o arboscelli, o fresche erbette,\r\n    O piagge benedette, o colli o monti,\r\n    O valli o fiumi o fonti o verde rivi,\r\n    Palme lauri ed olive, edere e mirti;\r\n    O gloriosi spirti de gli boschi;\r\n    O Eco, o antri foschi o chiare linfe,\r\n    O faretrate ninfe o agresti Pani,\r\n    O Satiri e Silvani, o Fauni e Driadi,\r\n    Naiadi ed Amadriadi, o Semidee,\r\n    Oreadi e Napee,--or siete sole.\r\n\r\n  _Sannazzar._\r\n\r\n    O thou delicious spring, O ye new flowers,\r\n    O airs, O youngling bowers; fresh thickening grass,\r\n    And plains beneath heaven’s face; O hills and mountains,\r\n    Vallies, and streams, and fountains; banks of green,\r\n    Myrtles, and palms serene, ivies, and bays;\r\n    And ye who warmed old lays, spirits o’ the woods,\r\n    Echoes, and solitudes, and lakes of light;\r\n    O quivered virgins bright, Pans rustical,\r\n    Satyrs and Sylvans all, Dryads, and ye\r\n    That up the mountains be; and ye beneath\r\n    In meadow or flowery heath,--ye are alone.\r\n\r\n“This time two hundred years ago, our ancestors were all anticipating\r\ntheir May holidays. Bigotry came in, and frowned them away; then\r\ndebauchery, and identified all pleasure with the town; then avarice, and\r\nwe have ever since been mistaking the means for the end.--Fortunately,\r\nit does not follow, that we shall continue to do so. Commerce, while it\r\nthinks it is only exchanging commodities, is helping to diffuse\r\nknowledge. All other gains,--all selfish and extravagant systems of\r\nacquisition,--tend to over-do themselves, and to topple down by their\r\nown undiffused magnitude. The world, as it learns other things, may\r\nlearn not to confound the means with the end, or at least,(to speak more\r\nphilosophically,) a really poor means with a really richer. The veriest\r\ncricket-player on a green has as sufficient a quantity of excitement, as\r\na fundholder or a partizan; and health, and spirits, and manliness to\r\nboot. Knowledge may go on; must do so, from necessity; and should do so,\r\nfor the ends we speak of: but knowledge, so far from being incompatible\r\nwith simplicity of pleasures, is the quickest to perceive its wealth.\r\nChaucer would lie for hours looking at the daisies. Scipio and Lælius\r\ncould amuse themselves with making ducks and drakes on the water.\r\nEpaminondas, the greatest of all the active spirits of Greece, was a\r\nflute-player and dancer. Alfred the Great could act the whole part of a\r\nminstrel. Epicurus taught the riches of temperance and intellectual\r\npleasure in a garden. The other philosophers of his country walked\r\nbetween heaven and earth in the colloquial bowers of Academus; and ‘the\r\nwisest heart of Solomon,’ who found every thing vain because he was a\r\nking, has left us panegyrics on the spring and ‘the voice of the\r\nturtle,’ because he was a poet, a lover, and a wise man.”[149]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAubrey remarks, that he never remembers to have seen a Maypole in\r\nFrance; but he says, “in Holland, they have their May-booms, which are\r\nstreight young trees, set up; and at Woodstock, in Oxon, they every\r\nMay-eve goe into the parke, and fetch away a number of hawthorne-trees,\r\nwhich they set before their dores: ’tis pity that they make such a\r\ndestruction of so fine a tree.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the old antiquary takes us to Woodstock, and a novel by the “Great\r\nUnknown,” bears that title, we will “inn” there awhile, agreeably to an\r\ninvitation of a correspondent who signs Ωνωφιλτατος, and who promises\r\nentertainment to the readers of the _Every-Day Book_, from an account of\r\nsome out-of-the-way doings at that place, when there were out-of-the-way\r\ndoings every where. Our friend with the Greek name is critical; for as\r\nregards the “new novel,” he says, that “_Woodstock_ would have been much\r\nbetter if the author had placed the incidents before the battle of\r\nWorcester, and supposed that Charles had been drawn over to England to\r\nengage in some plot of Dr. Rochecliffes, which had proved unsuccessful.\r\nThis might have spared him one great anachronism, (placing the pranks of\r\nthe merry devil of Woodstock in 1651, instead of 1649,) at the same time\r\nthat it would throw a greater air of probability over the story; for the\r\nreader who is at all acquainted with English history, continually feels\r\nhis pleasure destroyed by the recollection that in Charles’s escapes\r\nafter the battle of Worcester, he never once visited Woodstock. Nor does\r\nthe merry devil of Woodstock excite half the interest, or give us half\r\nthe amusement he would have done, if the author had lately read the\r\nnarrative I am now about to copy. He seems to have perused it at some\r\ndistance of time, and then to have written the novel with imperfect\r\nrecollection of the circumstances.--But let me begin my story; to wit,\r\nan article in the ‘British Magazine’ for April, 1747, which will I\r\nsuppose excite some curiosity, and is in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  “THE GENUINE HISTORY\r\n\r\n  _of the_\r\n\r\n  “GOOD DEVIL OF WOODSTOCK,\r\n\r\n  “_Famous in the world in the year 1649 and never accounted for, or at\r\n  all understood to this time._”\r\n\r\nThe teller of this “Genuine History” proceeds as hereafter verbatim.\r\n\r\nSome original papers having lately fallen into my hands under the name\r\nof “Authentic Memoirs of the Memorable Joseph Collins of Oxford,\r\ncommonly known by the name of Funny Joe, and now intended for the\r\npress,” I was extremely delighted to find in them a circumstantial and\r\nunquestionable account of the most famous of all invisible agents, so\r\nwell known in the year 1649, under the name of the good devil of\r\nWoodstock, and even adored by the people of that place for the vexation\r\nand distress it occasioned some people they were not much pleased with.\r\nAs this famous story, though related by a thousand people, and attested\r\nin all its circumstances beyond all possibility of doubt by people of\r\nrank, learning, and reputation, of Oxford and the adjacent towns, has\r\nnever yet been accounted for or at all understood, and is perfectly\r\nexplained in a manner that can admit of no doubt in these papers, I\r\ncould not refuse my readers their share of the pleasure it gave me in\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nAs the facts themselves were at that time so well known that it would\r\nhave been tedious to enumerate them, they are not mentioned in these\r\npapers; but that our readers may have a perfect account of the whole\r\ntransaction, as well as the secret history of it, I shall prefix a\r\nwritten account of it, drawn up and signed by the commissioners\r\nthemselves, who were the people concerned, and which I believe never was\r\npublished, though it agrees very well with the accounts Dr. Plot and\r\nother authors of credit give of the whole affair. This I found affixed\r\nto the author’s memorial, with this title:--\r\n\r\n“_A particular account of the strange and surprising apparitions and\r\nworks of spirits, which happened at_ Woodstock, _in_ Oxfordshire, _in\r\nthe months of_ October _and_ November, _in the year of our Lord Christ\r\n1649, when the honourable the commissioners for surveying the said\r\nmanor-house, park, woods, and other demesnes belonging to that manor,\r\nsat and remained there. Collected and attested by themselves._\r\n\r\n“The honourable the commissioners arrived at Woodstock manor-house,\r\nOctober 13th, and took up their residence in the king’s own rooms. His\r\nmajesty’s bed-chamber they made their kitchen, the council hall their\r\npantry, and the presence chamber was the place where they sat for\r\ndespatch of business. His majesty’s dining-room they made their wood\r\nyard, and stowed it with no other wood but that of the famous royal\r\noak[150] from the high park, which, that nothing might be left with the\r\nname of the king about it, they had dug up by the roots, and bundled up\r\ninto faggots for their firing.\r\n\r\n“October 16. This day they first sat for the despatch of business. In\r\nthe midst of their first debate there entered a large black dog (as they\r\nthought) which made a terrible howling, overturned two or three of their\r\nchairs, and doing some other damage, went under the bed, and there\r\ngnawed the cords. The door this while continued constantly shut, when\r\nafter some two or three hours, Giles Sharp, their secretary, looking\r\nunder the bed, perceived that the creature was vanished, and that a\r\nplate of meat which one of the servants had hid there was untouched, and\r\nshowing them to their honours, they were all convinced there could be no\r\nreal dog concerned in the case; the said Giles also deposed on oath that\r\nto his certain knowledge there was not.\r\n\r\n“October 17. As they were this day sitting at dinner in a lower room,\r\nthey heard plainly the noise of persons walking over their heads, though\r\nthey well knew the doors were all locked, and there could be none there;\r\npresently after they heard also all the wood of the king’s oak brought\r\nby parcels from the dining-room, and thrown with great violence into the\r\npresence chamber, as also the chairs, stools, tables, and other\r\nfurniture, forcibly hurled about the room, their own papers of the\r\nminutes of their transactions torn, and the ink-glass broken. When all\r\nthis had some time ceased, the said Giles proposed to enter first into\r\nthese rooms, and in presence of the commissioners of whom he received\r\nthe key, he opened the door, and entering with their honours following\r\nhim, he there found the wood strewed about the room, the chairs tossed\r\nabout and broken, the papers torn, and the ink-glass broken over them,\r\nall as they had heard, yet no footsteps appeared of any person whatever\r\nbeing there, nor had the doors ever been opened to admit or let out any\r\npersons since their honours were last there. It was therefore voted\r\n_nem. con._ that the person who did this mischief could have entered no\r\nother way than at the keyhole of the said doors.\r\n\r\n“In the night following this same day, the said Giles and two other of\r\nthe commissioners’ servants, as they were in bed at the same room with\r\ntheir honours, had their bed’s feet lifted up so much higher than their\r\nheads, that they expected to have their necks broken, and then they were\r\nlet fall at once with such violence as shook them up from the bed to a\r\ngood distance; and this was repeated many times, their honours being\r\namazed spectators of it. In the morning the bedsteads were found cracked\r\nand broken, and the said Giles, and his fellows, declared they were sore\r\nto the bones with the tossing and jolting of the beds.\r\n\r\n“October 19. As they were all in bed together, the candles were blown\r\nout with a sulphurous smell, and instantly many trenchers of wood were\r\nhurled about the room, and one of them putting his head above the\r\nclothes, had not less than six forcibly thrown at him, which wounded him\r\nvery grievously. In the morning the trenchers were all found lying about\r\nthe room, and were observed to be the same they had eaten on the day\r\nbefore, none being found remaining in the pantry.\r\n\r\n“October 20. This night the candles were put out as before, the curtains\r\nof the bed in which their honours lay, were drawn to and fro many times\r\nwith great violence; their honours received many cruel blows, and were\r\nmuch bruised beside with eight great pewter dishes, and three dozen\r\nwooden trenchers which were thrown on the bed, and afterwards heard\r\nrolling about the room.\r\n\r\n“Many times also this night they heard the forcible falling of many\r\nfaggots by their bed side, but in the morning no faggots were found\r\nthere, no dishes or trenchers were there seen neither, and the aforesaid\r\nGiles attests that by their different arranging in the pantry, they had\r\nassuredly been taken thence and after put there again.\r\n\r\n“October 21. The keeper of their ordinary and his bitch lay with them;\r\nthis night they had no disturbance.\r\n\r\n“October 22. Candles put out as before. They had the said bitch with\r\nthem again, but were not by that protected; the bitch set up a very\r\npiteous cry, the clothes of their beds were all pulled off, and the\r\nbricks, without any wind, were thrown off the chimney tops into the\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n“October 24. The candles put out as before. They thought all the wood of\r\nthe king’s oak was violently thrown down by their bedsides; they counted\r\nsixty-four faggots that fell with great violence, and some hit and shook\r\nthe bed, but in the morning none were found there, nor the door of the\r\nroom opened in which the said faggots were.\r\n\r\n“October 25. The candles put out as before. The curtains of the bed in\r\nthe drawing-room were forcibly drawn many times; the wood thrown out as\r\nbefore; a terrible crack like thunder was heard, and one of the servants\r\nrunning to see if his masters were not killed, found at his return three\r\ndozen of trenchers laid smoothly upon his bed under the quilt.\r\n\r\n“October 26. The beds were shaken as before, the windows seemed all\r\nbroken to pieces, and the glass fell in vast quantities all about the\r\nroom. In the morning they found the windows all whole, but the floor\r\nstrewed with broken glass, which they gathered and laid by.\r\n\r\n“October 29.[151] At midnight, candles went out as before; something\r\nwalked majestically through the room and opened and shut the window;\r\ngreat stones were thrown violently into the room, some whereof fell on\r\nthe beds, others on the floor; and at about a quarter after one a noise\r\nwas heard as of forty cannon discharged together, and again repeated at\r\nabout eight minutes distance. This alarmed and raised all the\r\nneighbourhood, who coming into their honours’ room gathered up the great\r\nstones, fourscore in number, many of them like common pebbles and\r\nboulters, and laid them by where they are to be seen to this day at a\r\ncorner of the adjoining field. This noise, like the discharge of cannon,\r\nwas heard throughout the country for sixteen miles round. During these\r\nnoises, which were heard in both rooms together, both the commissioners\r\nand their servants gave one another over for lost and cried out for\r\nhelp, and Giles Sharp snatching up a sword had well nigh killed one of\r\ntheir honours, taking him for the spirit as he came in his shirt into\r\nthe room. While they were together the noise was continued, and part of\r\nthe tiling of the house and all the windows of an upper room were taken\r\naway with it.\r\n\r\n“October 30. At midnight, something walked into the chamber treading\r\nlike a bear: it walked many times about, then threw the warming-pan\r\nviolently on the floor, and so bruised it that it was spoiled. Vast\r\nquantities of glass were now thrown about the room, and vast numbers of\r\ngreat stones and horses’ bones thrown in; these were all found in the\r\nmorning, and the floor, beds, and walls, were all much damaged by the\r\nviolence they were thrown in.\r\n\r\n“November 1. Candles were placed in all parts of the room, and a great\r\nfire made; at midnight, the candles all yet burning, a noise like the\r\nburst of a cannon was heard in the room, and the burning billets were\r\ntossed all over the room and about the beds, that had not their honours\r\ncalled in Giles and his fellows, the house had been assuredly burnt; an\r\nhour after the candles went out as usual, the crack of many cannon was\r\nheard, and many pails full of green stinking water were thrown on their\r\nhonours in bed; great stones were also thrown in as before, the bed\r\ncurtains and bedsteads torn and broken: the windows were now all really\r\nbroken, and the whole neighbourhood alarmed with the noises; nay, the\r\nvery rabbit-stealers that were abroad that night in the warren, were so\r\nfrightened at the dismal thundering, that they fled for fear, and left\r\ntheir ferrets behind them.\r\n\r\n“One of their honours this night spoke, and in the name of God asked\r\nwhat it was and why it disturbed them so. No answer was given to this,\r\nbut the noise ceased for a while, when the spirit came again, and as\r\nthey all agreed brought with it seven devils worse than itself. One of\r\nthe servants now lighted a large candle, and set it in the doorway\r\nbetween the two chambers, to see what passed, and as he watched it he\r\nplainly saw a hoof striking the candle and candlestick into the middle\r\nof the room, and afterwards making three scrapes over the snuff of the\r\ncandle to scrape it out. Upon this, the same person was so bold as to\r\ndraw a sword; but he had scarce got it out when he perceived another\r\ninvisible hand had hold of it too, and pulled with him for it, and at\r\nlength prevailing, struck him so violently on the head with the pummel,\r\nthat he fell down for dead with the blow. At this instant was heard\r\nanother burst like the discharge of a broadside of a ship of war, and at\r\nabout a minute or two’s distance each, no less than nineteen more such;\r\nthese shook the house so violently that they expected every moment it\r\nwould fall upon their heads. The neighbours on this were all alarmed,\r\nand running to the house, they all joined in prayers and psalm-singing,\r\nduring which the noise still continued in the other rooms, and the\r\ndischarge of cannon without though no one was there.”\r\n\r\nDr. Plot concludes his relation of this memorable event with observing,\r\nthat though tricks have been often played in affairs of this kind, many\r\nof these things are not reconcileable to juggling; such as--1. The loud\r\nnoises beyond the power of man to make without such instruments as were\r\nnot there. 2. The tearing and breaking the beds. 3. The throwing about\r\nthe fire. 4. The hoof treading out the candle; and, 5. The striving for\r\nthe sword, and the blow the man received from the pummel of it.\r\n\r\nTo see, however, how great men are sometimes deceived, we may recur to\r\nthis one tract, where among other things there is one entitled “_The\r\nsecret history of the good devil of Woodstock_,” in which we find it\r\nunder the author’s own hand, that he, Joseph Collins, commonly called\r\nfunny Joe, was himself this very devil; that he hired himself as a\r\nservant to the commissioners under the feigned name of Giles Sharp, and\r\nby the help of two friends, an unknown trap-door in the ceiling of the\r\nbedchamber, and a pound of common gunpowder, played all these amazing\r\ntricks by himself, and his fellow servants, whom he had introduced on\r\npurpose to assist him, had lifted up their own beds.\r\n\r\nThe candles were contrived by a common trick of gunpowder put in them,\r\nto put themselves out by a certain time.\r\n\r\nThe dog who began the farce was, as he swore, no dog, but truly a bitch\r\nwho had the day before whelped in that room and made all this\r\ndisturbance in seeking for her puppies; and which when she had served\r\nhis purpose, he let out and then looked for. The story of the hoof and\r\nsword himself alone was witness to, and was never suspected as to the\r\ntruth of them though mere fictions. By the trap-door his friends let\r\ndown stones, faggots, glass, water, &c. which they either left there or\r\ndrew up again as best suited with him; and by this way let themselves in\r\nand out without opening the doors and going through the key-holes; and\r\nall the noises he declares he made by placing quantities of white\r\ngunpowder over pieces of burning charcoal on plates of tin, which as\r\nthey melted went off with that violent explosion.\r\n\r\nOne thing there was beyond all these he tells us, which was also what\r\ndrove them from the house in reality, though they never owned it. This\r\nwas they had formed a reserve of part of the premises to themselves, and\r\nhid their mutual agreement, which they had drawn up in writing, under\r\nthe earth in a pot in a corner of the room in which they usually dined,\r\nin which an orange tree grew: when in the midst of their dinner one day\r\nthis earth of itself took fire and burned violently with a blue flame,\r\nfilling the room with a strong sulphurous stench; and this he also\r\nprofesses was his own doing, by a secret mixture he had placed there the\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nI am very happy in having an opportunity of setting history right about\r\nthese remarkable events; and would not have the reader disbelieve my\r\nauthor’s account of them, from his naming either white gunpowder going\r\noff when melted, or his making the earth about the pot take fire of its\r\nown accord; since, however improbable these accounts may appear to some\r\nreaders, and whatever secrets they might be in Joe’s time, they are well\r\nknown now in chemistry. As to the last, there needs only to mix an equal\r\nquantity of iron filings, finely powdered, and powder of pure brimstone,\r\nand make them into a paste with fair water. This paste, when it has lain\r\ntogether about twenty-six hours, will of itself take fire, and burn all\r\nthe sulphur away, with a blue flame and great stink. For the others,\r\nwhat he calls white gunpowder, is plainly the thundering powder called\r\n_pulvis fulminans_ by our chemists. It is made only of three parts of\r\nsaltpetre, two parts of pearl-ashes, or salt of tartar, and one part of\r\nflower of brimstone, mixed together and beat to a fine powder; a small\r\nquantity of this held on the point of a knife over a candle will not go\r\noff till it melts, and then give a report like a pistol; and this he\r\nmight easily dispose of in larger quantities, so as to make it go off of\r\nitself, while he was with his masters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this diversion at Woodstock, wherein if we have exceeded be it\r\nremembered that Aubrey carried us thither, we return to the diversions\r\nof the month.\r\n\r\n    Ye shepherdesses, in a goodly round,\r\n    Purpled with health, as in the greenwood shade,\r\n    Incontinent ye thump the echoing ground,\r\n    And deftly lead the dance along the glade;\r\n    (O may no showers your merry makes affray!)\r\n    Hail at the opening, at the closing day,\r\n    All hail, ye Bonnibels, to your own season, May.\r\n\r\n    Nor ye absent yourselves, ye shepherd swains,\r\n    But lead to dance and song the liberal May,\r\n    And while in jocund ranks you beat the plains,\r\n    Your flocks shall nibble and your lambkins play,\r\n    Frisking in glee.

Mariette,” with the preceding lines subjoined. It is wholly a rustic\r\naffair. In an English village such an event would have been celebrated\r\nto the simple sounds from a pipe and tabor, or at most a fiddle; but\r\nour neighbours of the continent perform the ceremony by beat of drum and\r\nsound of trumpet. Their merriments are showy as themselves; ours are of\r\na more sober character, and in the country seem nearer to a state of\r\npastoral simplicity.\r\n\r\n    My brown Buxoma is the featest maid,\r\n    That e’er at wake delightsome gambol play’d,\r\n    Clean as young lambkins or the goose’s down,\r\n    And like the goldfinch in her Sunday gown.\r\n    The witless lamb may sport upon the plain,\r\n    The frisking kid delight the gaping swain,\r\n    The wanton calf may skip with many a bound,\r\n    And my cur, Tray, play deftest feats around;\r\n    But neither lamb, nor kid, nor calf, nor Tray\r\n    Dance like Buxoma on the first of May.\r\n\r\n  _Gay._\r\n\r\nAlso, on May-day we have the superstitions of innocence, or ignorance if\r\nthe reader please--no matter which, it is the same thing.

This is generally a white thorn, of\r\nabout four or five feet high, and they carry it to the street or place\r\nof their residence, in the centre of which they dig a hole, and having\r\nplanted the bush, they go round to every house and collect money. They\r\nthen buy a pound or more of candles, and fasten them to various parts of\r\nthe tree or bush, in such a manner so as to avoid burning it. Another\r\nportion of “the collection” is expended in the purchase of a heap of\r\nturf, sufficient for a large fire, and, if the funds will allow, an old\r\ntar barrel. Formerly it was not considered complete without having a\r\nhorse’s skull and other bones to burn in the fire. The depots for these\r\nbones were the tanners’ yards in a part of the suburbs, called\r\nKilmainham; and on May morning, groups of boys drag loads of bones to\r\ntheir several destinations. This practice gave rise to a threat, yet\r\nmade use of:--“I will drag you like a horse’s head to the bone-fire.”\r\nAbout dusk when no more money can be collected, the bush is trimmed, the\r\nturf and bones are made ready to set on fire, the candles are all\r\nlighted, the bush fully illuminated, and the boys giving three huzzas,\r\nbegin to dance and jump round it. If their money will afford the\r\nexpenditure, they have a pot of porter to drink round. After an hour or\r\nso, the heap of turf and bones are set fire to, and when the candles are\r\nburnt out, the bush is taken up and thrown into the flames. They\r\ncontinue playing about until the fire is burnt out; each then returns to\r\nhis home; and so ends their May-day.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three miles from Dublin, on the great northern road, is a\r\nvillage called Finglass; it is prettily situated, and is the only place\r\nI know of in the neighbourhood of Dublin, where May-day is kept up in\r\nthe old style. A high pole is decorated with garlands, and visiters come\r\nin from different parts of the country, and dance round it to whatever\r\nmusic chance may have conducted there. The best male and female dancer\r\nare chosen king and queen, and placed on chairs.\r\n\r\nWhen the dancing is over, they are carried by some of the party to an\r\nadjacent public-house, where they regale themselves with ham, beef,\r\nwhiskey-punch, ale, cakes, and porter, after which they generally have a\r\ndance in-doors, and then disperse.\r\n\r\nThere is an old song relating to the above custom, beginning--\r\n\r\n    Ye lads and lasses all to-day,\r\n    To Finglass let us haste away;\r\n    With hearts so light and dresses gay\r\n      To dance around the Maypole.--\r\n\r\n  A. O. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is communicated by T. A. that it was formerly a custom in Cheshire\r\nfor young men to place _birchen boughs_ on May-day over the doors of\r\ntheir mistresses, and marke the residence of a scold by an _alder\r\nbough_. There is an old rhyme which mentions peculiar boughs for various\r\ntempers, an _owler_ (alder) for a scolder, a _nut_ for a slut, &c. Mr.\r\nOrmerode, the county historian, presumes the practice is disused; but he\r\nmentions that in the main street of Weverham, in Cheshire, are two\r\nMaypoles, which are decorated on this day with all due attention to the\r\nancient solemnity: the sides are hung with garlands, and the top\r\nterminated by a birch, or other tall slender tree with its leaves on;\r\nthe bark being peeled, and the stem spliced to the pole, so as to give\r\nthe appearance of one tree from the summit.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF MAY DAY.\r\n\r\nOur usages on this day retain the character of their ancient origin.\r\n\r\nThe Romans commenced the festival of Flora on the 28th of April, and\r\ncontinued it through several days in May. Ovid records the mythological\r\nattributes and dedication of the season to that goddess:--\r\n\r\n    Fair Flora! now attend thy sportful feast,\r\n    Of which some days I with design have past;--\r\n    A part in April and a part in May\r\n    Thou claims’t, and both command my tuneful lay;\r\n    And as the confines of two months are thine\r\n    To sing of both the double task be mine.\r\n    Circus and stage are open now and free--\r\n    Goddess! again thy feast my theme must be.\r\n    Since new opinions oft delusive are\r\n    Do thou, O Flora, who thou art declare;\r\n    Why should thy poet on conjectures dwell?\r\n    Thy name and attributes thou best can’st tell.\r\n    Thus I.--to which she ready answer made,\r\n    And rosy sweets attended what she said;\r\n    Though, now corrupted, Flora be my name,\r\n    From the Greek Chloris that corruption came:--\r\n    In fields where happy mortals whilome stray’d\r\n    Chloris my name, I was a rural maid;\r\n    To praise herself a modest nymph will shun,\r\n    But yet a god was by my beauty won.\r\n\r\nFlora then relates, that Zephyr became enamoured of her as Boreas had\r\nbeen, that “by just marriage to his bed,” she was united to Zephyr, who\r\nassigned her the dominion over Spring, and that she strews the earth\r\nwith flowers and presides over gardens. She further says, as the deity\r\nof flowers,--\r\n\r\n                           I also rule the plains.\r\n    When the crops flourish in the golden field;\r\n    The harvest will undoubted plenty yield;\r\n    If purple clusters flourish on the vine,\r\n    The presses will abound with racy wine;\r\n    The _flowering_ olive makes a beauteous year,\r\n    And how can _bloomless_ trees ripe apples bear?\r\n    The _flower_ destroyed of vetches, beans, and peas,\r\n    You must expect but small or no increase;\r\n    The gift of honey’s mine, the painful bees,\r\n    That gather sweets from _flowers_ or _blooming_ trees,\r\n    To scented shrubs and violets I invite,\r\n    In which I know they take the most delight;\r\n    A _flower_ an emblem of young years is seen,\r\n    With all its leaves around it fresh and green;\r\n    So youth appears, when health the body sways,\r\n    And gladness in the mind luxuriant plays.\r\n\r\nFrom these allegorical ascriptions, the Roman people worshipped Flora,\r\nand celebrated her festivals by ceremonies and rejoicings, and\r\nofferings of spring flowers and the branches of trees in bloom, which\r\nthrough the accommodation of the Romish church to the pagan usages,\r\nremain to us at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON, UNDER THE WREKIN.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nIt has been usual for the people in this neighbourhood to assemble on\r\nthe Wrekin-hill, on the Sunday after May-day, and the three successive\r\nSundays, to drink a health “to all friends round the Wrekin;” but as on\r\nthis annual festival, various scenes of drunkenness and other\r\nlicentiousness were frequently exhibited, its celebration has, of late,\r\nbeen very properly discouraged by the magistracy, and is going\r\ndeservedly to decay.\r\n\r\n  _February, 1826._\r\n\r\n  W. P.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY DAY STORY-TELLING.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _April_ 25, 1826.\r\n\r\nSir,--At a village in Westmoreland called Temple Sowerby, perhaps if not\r\nthe _most_, at least _one_ of the most beautiful in the north of\r\nEngland, there has been, “from time whereof the memory of man is not to\r\nthe contrary,” and still is, a custom on the first day of May for a\r\nnumber of individuals to assemble on the green, and there propose a\r\ncertain number as candidates for contesting the various prizes then\r\nproduced, which consist of a grindstone as the head prize; a hone or\r\nwhetstone, for a razor, as the second; and whetstones of an inferior\r\ndescription, for those who can only reach a state of mediocrity in “the\r\nnoble art of lying.”\r\n\r\n_The people_ are the judges: each candidate in rotation commences a\r\n_story_, such as his fertile genius at the moment prompts; and the more\r\nmarvellous or improbable his story happens to be, so much the greater\r\nchance is there of his success.\r\n\r\nAfter being _amused_ in this manner for a considerable length of time,\r\nand awarding the prizes to the most deserving, the host of candidates,\r\njudges, and other attendants, adjourn to the inns, where the sports of\r\nthe day very often end in a few splendid battles.\r\n\r\nThere is an anecdote, very current in the place, of a late bishop of\r\nCarlisle passing through in his carriage on this particular day, when\r\nhis attention being attracted by the group of persons assembled\r\ntogether, very naturally inquired the cause. His question was readily\r\nanswered by a full statement of facts which brought from his lordship a\r\nsevere lecture on the iniquity of such a proceeding; and at the\r\nconclusion, he said, “For my part I never told a lie in my life.” This\r\nwas immediately reported to the judges, upon which, without any dissent,\r\nthe hone was awarded to his lordship as most deserving of it; and, as is\r\nreported, it was actually thrown into his carriage.\r\n\r\nFor the truth of the anecdote I cannot venture to assert; but the\r\nexistence of the custom is a well-known fact to many of your readers in\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORAL GAMES OF TOULOUSE.\r\n\r\nOver a door in the consistory of the Hôtel de Ville at Toulouse, is a\r\nsmall marble figure of Clemence Isaure. In this consistory, the meetings\r\nwere held for distributing the prizes in the floral games; the figure\r\nhad flowers in her hand, but they are broken off. Below it on a tablet\r\nof brass, is a Latin inscription, in Roman capitals, but with so many\r\nabbreviations, and some of these of a nature so unintelligible, that the\r\nmeaning is scarcely to be deciphered. This much, however, is to be\r\ncollected from it, that Clemence Isaure is represented to have been the\r\ndaughter of L. Isaurus, of the ancient and illustrious family of the\r\nIsauræ of Toulouse; that the institution of the “floral games” is\r\nascribed to her; that she is said to have built the Hôtel de Ville at\r\nher own expense; to have bequeathed to the city the markets for corn,\r\nwine, fish, and vegetables; and to have left the remainder of her\r\nproperty in perpetuity to the city for the support of the floral games;\r\nyet, it does not mention her age, or at what period she lived, or\r\nwhether she was maiden, wife, or widow.\r\n\r\n“_Le Roman de Clemence Isaure_,” an old ballad story, represents her to\r\nhave been a fair lady of Toulouse, with whom the handsome Lautrec was\r\ndeeply enamoured, and that she returned his love with equal passion.\r\nAlphonso, her father, having chosen another husband for Clemence, she\r\nresisted the union, declaring that her life was at his disposal, but\r\nthat as long as she should live, her heart must be wholly Lautrec’s.\r\nThen Alphonso caused her to be chained, and shut her up in a strong\r\ntower, and threatened Lautrec’s life if he could get him into his power;\r\nand Lautrec, having found the place of his mistress’s imprisonment, like\r\na true lover despised her cruel father’s threats, and went to the tower\r\nand repeated his vows and sorrows to the fair Clemence, who came to the\r\ngrate and told him of his danger, and prayed him to enter into the\r\nservice of the French king, and follow military glory, and chase the\r\nrecollection of their loves and their misfortunes; and as a pledge, she\r\npresented him with three flowers, a violet, an eglantine, and a\r\nmarigold. The first she gave him as her colour, that he might appear as\r\nher knight; the second was her favourite flower; and the third an emblem\r\nof the chagrin and sorrow by which her heart was consumed. Then Clemence\r\nkissed the flowers, and let her tears fall on them, and threw them to\r\nher lover, and her father appeared, and Lautrec gathered up the flowers,\r\nand hastily withdrew. In obedience to the injunctions of his mistress,\r\nhe departed from Toulouse for the French king’s court; but before he had\r\nproceeded far on his journey, he heard that the English were marching\r\nagainst the city; and he returned when the inhabitants were flying\r\nbefore the enemy, and abandoning the ramparts, and leaving them\r\ndefenceless: and only one old man resisted and valiantly maintained his\r\nground. Then Lautrec fled to his assistance, and discovered him to be\r\nAlphonso, the father of Clemence: and at the moment when a fatal stroke\r\nwas aimed at the old man, he rushed forward and received the mortal\r\nwound himself, and died in Alphonso’s arms, and gave him the flowers he\r\nreceived from Clemence, and conjured him to deliver them to his\r\ndaughter, and to console her under the distress his fate would bring\r\nupon her. And Alphonso relented, and in great sorrow carried the flowers\r\nto Clemence, and related the untimely death of Lautrec; and her\r\nafflictions were too heavy for her to bear, and she fell a victim to\r\ndespair and anguish, and followed her lover to the grave. But in\r\nremembrance of their sad story, she bequeathed her whole property to\r\nthe city of Toulouse for the celebration of annual games, at which,\r\nprizes of golden flowers, like those she had given to Lautrec, were to\r\nbe distributed to the skilful troubadours who should compose the best\r\npoem, upon the occasion. This is the history of the gallant Lautrec and\r\nthe fair Clemence, in the poetical romance.\r\n\r\nBut according to Pierre Caseneuve, the author of an “Inquiry into the\r\nOrigin of the Floral Games at Toulouse,” there is strong reason to doubt\r\nwhether such a person as Clemence ever existed. Among the archives of\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville are several chronicles of the floral games, the\r\noldest of which states, that in the year 1324, seven of the principal\r\ninhabitants of Toulouse, desirous to promote the fame and prosperity of\r\nthe city, resolved to establish an annual festival there, for the\r\ncultivation of the Provençal poetry, a spirit of piety, and suavity of\r\nmanners. They therefore proposed that all persons skilled in Provençal\r\npoetry, should be invited to assemble at Toulouse every year in the\r\nbeginning of May, to recite their compositions, and that a violet of\r\ngold should be given to him whose verses the judges should determine the\r\nmost worthy; and a circular letter in the Provençal poetry was dispersed\r\nover the province of Languedoc, inviting competitors to assemble in the\r\nbeginning of May the following year, to celebrate this festival.\r\n\r\nThe poetical compositions were not to be confined to the lays of lovers\r\nreciting their passion, and the fame of their mistresses; but the honour\r\nof God, and glorifying his name, was to be their first object. It was\r\nwished that poetry should conduce to the happiness of mankind, and by\r\nfurnishing them a source of innocent and laudable amusement, make time\r\npass pleasantly, repress the unjust sallies of anger, and dissipate the\r\ndark vapours of sadness. For these reasons it was termed, by the\r\ninstitutors, the “Gay Science.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this invitation, a large concourse of competitors\r\nresorted to Toulouse; and in May, 1325, the first festival of the floral\r\ngames was celebrated. Verses were recited by the candidates before a\r\nnumerous assembly. The seven persons with whom the meeting originated,\r\npresided under the title of the chancellor of the “Gay Science,” and\r\nhis six assessors, and there also sat with them, the capitouls or chief\r\nmagistrates of the town as judges; and there was a great assemblage of\r\nknights, of gentlemen, and of ladies. The prize was given to the\r\ncandidate whose verses were determined by the majority of the judges to\r\nbe the most worthy.\r\n\r\nThe “floral games” of Toulouse continued to be celebrated in like\r\nmanner, at the sole expense of the institutors, till the magistrates\r\nseeing the advantage they were of to the town, by the vast concourse of\r\npeople brought thither, and considering that their continuance must be\r\nprecarious while they depended upon the ability and disposition of a few\r\nindividuals for their support, resolved to convert the institution into\r\na public concern; and, with the concurrence of the principal\r\ninhabitants, it was determined that the expense should in future be\r\ndefrayed by the city, that to the original prize two others should be\r\nadded, a silver eglantine, and a silver marigold; and that occasional\r\nones might be distributed at the option of the judges to very young\r\npoets, as stimulants to them to aim at obtaining the principal prizes.\r\n\r\nAfter about thirty years it was judged expedient to appoint a committee,\r\nwho should draw up such a code of statutes as might include every\r\npossible case that could occur, and these statutes were laid before the\r\njudges for their approbation.\r\n\r\nAmong these decrees the principal were, that no prize could be given to\r\na heretic, a schismatic, or an excommunicated person; that whoever was a\r\ncandidate for any of the prizes, should take a solemn oath that the\r\npoetry was his own composition, without the least assistance from any\r\nother person; that no woman should be admitted to the competition,\r\nunless her talents in composing verses were so celebrated as to leave no\r\ndoubt of her being capable of writing the poetry offered:--that no one\r\nwho gained a prize was allowed to be a candidate again till after a\r\nlapse of three years, though he was expected in the intervening years to\r\ncompose verses for the games, and recite them; and that if any or all\r\nthe prizes remained undisposed of, from no verses being produced that\r\nwere judged worthy of them, the prizes were to remain over to the next\r\nyear, then to be given away in addition to the regular prizes of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nUnder these and other regulations the “floral games” became celebrated\r\nthroughout Europe; and within fifty years from their first institution\r\nthey were the resort of all persons of distinction. In 1388, the\r\nreigning king of Arragon sent ambassadors to Charles the Sixth of\r\nFrance, with great pomp and solemnity, requesting that some of the poets\r\nof the “floral games” at Toulouse might be permitted to come to the\r\ncourt, and assist in establishing similar games there; promising that,\r\nwhen they had fulfilled their mission, they should receive rewards equal\r\nto their merits, and consistent with his royal munificence.\r\n\r\nThis account of the institution of the “floral games” is from the oldest\r\nregisters relative to them; wherein there is no mention made of the lady\r\nClemence Isaure till 1513, nearly two hundred years after their\r\ninstitution; and it is well known that the statue of the lady Clemence\r\nin the consistory, was not put up till the year 1557. In that year it\r\nhad been proposed in the college of the Gay Science to erect a monument\r\nto her memory in the church of La Dorade, where she was reputed to have\r\nbeen buried; but this idea was afterwards changed for putting up her\r\nstatue in the room where the “floral games” were held. From that time\r\nthe statue was always crowned with flowers at the time of the\r\ncelebration of the games, and a Latin oration pronounced in honour of\r\nher. A satirical sonnet in the Provençal language upon the idea of\r\nerecting either a monument or a statue to a lady who never had any\r\nexistence in the world, is preserved in Pierre Caseneuve’s “Inquiry into\r\nthe Origin of the Floral Games.”\r\n\r\nBut by whomsoever the “floral games” of Toulouse were instituted, it is\r\nremarkable, that the festival was constantly observed for more than four\r\ncenturies and a half without interruption. It did not cease to be\r\ncelebrated till the revolution. It was not, however, continued entirely\r\naccording to the original institution, since for a considerable time the\r\nuse of the Provençal language, in the poetry for the prizes, had been\r\nabandoned, and the French substituted for it. At what period this change\r\ntook place does not seem to be well ascertained. The number of prizes,\r\ntoo, was increased to five, the principal of which was still the golden\r\nviolet; but instead of one eglantine, and one marigold of silver, two\r\nof each were given. The violet was appropriated to the best ode; the\r\nothers were for a piece in heroic poetry, for one in pastoral poetry,\r\nfor a satirical piece, and for a sonnet, a madrigal, a song, or some\r\nother minor effusion.\r\n\r\nThree of the deputies to the parliament had for some time presided at\r\nthese games, instead of the chancellor of the Gay Science with his six\r\nassessors; and with them were associated the capitouls, or chief\r\nmagistrates of the town. All the other magistrates, and the whole body\r\nof the parliament, attended in their robes of office, with the principal\r\ngentlemen of the town, and a brilliant assemblage of ladies in full\r\ndress. These were ranged round the room in seats raised like an\r\namphitheatre, and the students of the university sat on benches in the\r\ncentre. The room was ornamented with festoons of flowers and laurel, and\r\nthe statue of Clemence Isaure was crowned with them. After the oration\r\nin honour of her was pronounced, the judges, having previously consulted\r\ntogether in private, and assigned the prizes to the pieces which they\r\nthought most worthy of them, stood up, and, naming the poem to which one\r\nwas given, pronounced with an audible voice, “Let the author come\r\nforward.” The author then presented himself; when his name was declared,\r\nit was followed by a grand flourish of music. The same ceremony was\r\nrepeated as each piece was announced. The whole concluded with each\r\nauthor publicly reading his poem.\r\n\r\nMany of these prize poems are to be found in different collections.\r\nSeveral prizes were in latter times adjudged to females, without any\r\nstrict investigation having been previously made into the possibility of\r\nthe pieces to which they were decreed being female compositions. It was\r\nowing to having gained a silver eglantine at one of these festivals that\r\nthe celebrated Fabre d’Eglantine assumed the latter part of his name. He\r\nwas a Languedocian by birth, a native of Limoux, a small town about four\r\nleagues from Toulouse.[152]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout such encouragements to be poetical, as were annually offered by\r\nthe conductors of the “floral games” at Toulouse, our kind feelings\r\nhave been cultivated, and our literature is enriched by a race of poets,\r\nwhom we may venture to array against the united armies of continental\r\nbards. It may be doubted whether a May prize of Toulouse was ever\r\nawarded for sweeter verses, than Matt. Prior’s on Chloe’s May flowers.\r\n\r\nTHE GARLAND.\r\n\r\n    The pride of every grove I chose\r\n      The violet sweet and lily fair,\r\n    The dappled pink, and blushing rose,\r\n      To deck my charming Chloe’s hair.\r\n\r\n    At morn the nymph vouchsaf’d to place\r\n      Upon her brow the various wreath;\r\n    The flowers less blooming than her face,\r\n      The scent less fragrant than her breath.\r\n\r\n    The flowers she wore along the day,\r\n      And every nymph and shepherd said,\r\n    That in her hair they looked more gay\r\n      Than glowing in their native bed.\r\n\r\n    Undrest at evening, when she found\r\n      Their odour lost, their colours past,\r\n    She changed her look, and on the ground\r\n      Her garland and her eye she cast.\r\n\r\n    The eye dropt sense distinct and clear,\r\n      As any muse’s tongue could speak,\r\n    When from its lid a pearly tear\r\n      Ran trickling down her beauteous cheek.\r\n\r\n    Dissembling what I knew too well,\r\n      “My love, my life,” said I, “explain\r\n    This change of humour; pr’ythee tell:\r\n      That falling tear--what does it mean?”\r\n\r\n    She sighed; she smil’d; and, to the flowers\r\n      Pointing, the lovely moralist said,\r\n    “See, friend, in some few fleeting hours\r\n      See yonder, what a change is made!\r\n\r\n    “Ah, me! the blooming pride of May,\r\n      And that of beauty are but one,\r\n    At morn both flourish bright and gay;\r\n      Both fade at evening, pale and gone.\r\n\r\n    “At dawn poor Stella danc’d and sung;\r\n      The amorous youth around her bowed,\r\n    At night her fatal knell was rung;\r\n      I saw and kissed her in her shroud.\r\n\r\n    “Such as she is, who died to-day;\r\n      Such I, alas! may be to-morrow;\r\n    Go, Damon, bid thy muse display\r\n      The justice of thy Chloe’s sorrow.”\r\n\r\n  _Prior._\r\n\r\nA beautiful ode by another of our poets graces the loveliness of the\r\nseason, and finally “points a moral” of sovereign virtue to all who\r\nneed the application, and will take it to heart.\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\n    Lo!

At the summit may be seen a company of bakers, and\r\nother craftsmen, dressed in kilts, dancing round a Maypole. On the more\r\nlevel part “next _door_,” is usually an itinerant vender of whiskey, or\r\nmountain (not May) dew, your approach to whom is always indicated by a\r\nnumber of “bodies” carelessly lying across your path, not dead, but\r\ndrunk. In another place you may descry two parties of Irishmen, who, not\r\ncontent with gathering the superficial dew, have gone “deeper and deeper\r\nyet,” and fired by a liberal desire to communicate the fruits of their\r\nindustry, actively pelt each other with clods.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings commence with the daybreak. The strong lights thrown\r\nupon the various groups by the rising sun, give a singularly picturesque\r\neffect to a scene, wherein the ever-varying and unceasing sounds of the\r\nbagpipes, and tabours and fifes, _et hoc genus omne_, almost stun the\r\near. About six o’clock, the appearance of the gentry, toiling and\r\n_pechin_ up the ascent, becomes the signal for serving men and women to\r\nmarch to the right-about; for they well know that they must have the\r\nhouse clean, and every thing in order earlier than usual on May-morning.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock the “fun” is all over; and by nine or ten, were it\r\nnot for the drunkards who are staggering towards the “gude town,” no one\r\nwould know that any thing particular had taken place.\r\n\r\nSuch, my dear sir, is the gathering of May-dew. I subjoin a sketch of a\r\ngroup of dancers, and\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  P. P., Jun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is noticed in the “Morning Post” of the second of May, 1791, that the\r\nday before, “being the first of May, according to annual and\r\nsuperstitious custom, a number of persons went into the fields and\r\nbathed their faces with the dew on the grass, under the idea that it\r\nwould render them beautiful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay-dew was held of singular virtue in former times. Pepys on a certain\r\nday in May makes this entry in his diary:--\r\n\r\n“My wife away, down with Jane and W. Hewer to Woolwich, in order to a\r\nlittle ayre, and to lie there to night, and so _to gather May-dew\r\nto-morrow morning_, which Mrs. Turner hath taught her is the only thing\r\nin the world to wash her face with; and” Pepys adds, “I am contented\r\nwith it.” His “reasons for contentment” seem to appear in the same line;\r\nfor he says, “I (went) by water to Fox-hall, and there walked in\r\nSpring-garden;” and there he notices “a great deal of company, and the\r\nweather and garden pleasant: and it is very pleasant and cheap going\r\nthither, for a man may go to spend what he will, or nothing--all as one:\r\nbut to hear the nightingale and other birds; and here a fiddler, and\r\nthere a harp; and here a jew’s-trump, and here laughing, and there fine\r\npeople walking, is mighty diverting,” says Mr. Pepys, while his wife is\r\ngone to lie at Woolwich, “in order to a little ayre, and to _gather\r\nMay-dew_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGERARD’S HALL MAYPOLE.\r\n\r\n_Basing Lane._\r\n\r\nWhence this lane derived its name of _Basing_, Stow cannot tell. It runs\r\nout of Bread-street, and was called the Bakehouse, but, “whether meant\r\nfor the king’s bakehouse, or bakers dwelling there, and baking bread to\r\nserve the market in Bread-street, where the bread was sold, I know not,”\r\nsays Stow; “but sure I am, I have not read of Basing or of Gerard, the\r\ngyant, to have any thing there to doe.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that this Maypole was fabled to have been “the justing staff of\r\nGerard, a gyant.” Stow’s particulars concerning it, and his account of\r\nGerard’s-hall, which at this time is an inn for Bath and West of England\r\ncoaches and other conveyances, are very interesting. He says, “On the\r\nsouth side of this (Basing) lane is one great house, of old time builded\r\nupon arched vaults, and with arched gates of stone, brought from Cane in\r\nNormandie; the same is now a common ostrey for receit of travelers,\r\ncommonly and corruptly called Gerard’s-hall, of a gyant said to have\r\ndwelled there. In the high roofed hall of this house, sometime stood a\r\nlarge Firre-Pole, which reached to the roofe thereof, and was said to be\r\none of the staves that Gerard the gyant used in the warres, to runne\r\nwithall. There stood also a ladder of the same length, which (as they\r\nsaid) served to ascend to the top of the staffe. Of later yeeres this\r\nhall is altered in building, and divers roomes are made in it.\r\nNotwithstanding, the pole is removed to one corner of the hall, and the\r\nladder hanged broken upon a wall in the yard. The hosteler of that house\r\nsaid to mee, the pole lacked half a foote of forty in length. I measured\r\nthe compasse thereof, and found it fifteene inches. Reason of the pole\r\ncould the master of the hostery give me none, but bade mee reade the\r\nChronicles, for there he heard of it. Which answer,” says Stow, “seemed\r\nto me insufficient: for he meant the description of Britaine, for the\r\nmost part drawne out of John Leyland, his commentaries (borrowed of\r\nmyselfe) and placed before Reynes Wolfe’s Chronicle, as the labours of\r\nanother.” It seems that this chronicle has “a chapter of gyants or\r\nmonstrous men--of a man with his mouth sixteene foote wide, and so to\r\nGerard the gyant and his staffe,” which Stow speaks of as “these\r\nfables,” and then he derives the house called Gerard’s-hall, from the\r\nowner thereof, “John Gisors, maior of London, in the yeere 1245,” and\r\nsays, “The pole in the hall might bee used of old time (as then the\r\ncustome was in every parish) to bee set up in the summer, a Maypole,\r\nbefore the principall house in the parish or streete, and to stand in\r\nthe hall before the scrine, decked with hollie and ivie at the feast of\r\nChristmas. The ladder served for the decking of the Maypole, and reached\r\nto the roof of the hall.”\r\n\r\nTo this is added, that “every mans house of old time was decked with\r\nholly and ivie in the winter, especially at Christmas;” whereof, gentle\r\nreader, be pleased to take notice, and do “as they did in the old time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe think we remember something about milkmaids and their garlands in our\r\nboyish days; but even this lingering piece of professional rejoicing is\r\ngone; and instead of intellectual pleasures at courts, manly games among\r\nthe gentry, the vernal appearance every where of boughs and flowers, and\r\nthe harmonious accompaniment of ladies’ looks, all the idea that a\r\nLondoner now has of May-day, is the dreary gambols and tinsel-fluttering\r\nsqualidness of the poor chimney-sweepers! What a personification of the\r\ntimes;--paper-gilded dirt, slavery, and melancholy, bustling for another\r\npenny!\r\n\r\nSomething like celebrations of May-day still loiter in more remote parts\r\nof the country, such as Cornwall, Devonshire, and Westmoreland; and it\r\nis observable, that most of the cleverest men of the time come from such\r\nquarters, or have otherwise chanced upon some kind of insulation from\r\nits more sophisticated common-places.--Should the subject come before\r\nthe consideration of any persons who have not had occasion to look at it\r\nwith reference to the general character of the age, they will do a\r\ngreat good, and perhaps help eventually to alter it, by fanning the\r\nlittle sparks that are left them of a brighter period. Our business is\r\nto do what we can, to remind the others of what they may do, to pay\r\nhonours to the season ourselves, and to wait for that alteration in the\r\ntimes, which the necessity of things must produce, and which we must\r\nendeavour to influence as genially as possible in its approach.[153]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Leslie’s pencil, there is a picture of May-day, “in the old\r\ntime”--the “golden days of good queen Bess”--whereon a lady, whose muse\r\ndelights in agreeable subjects, has written the following descriptive\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\nON MAY DAY.\r\n\r\n_By Leslie._\r\n\r\n    Beautiful and radiant May,\r\n    Is not this thy festal day?\r\n    Is not this spring revelry\r\n    Held in honour, queen, of thee?\r\n    ’Tis a fair: the booths are gay,\r\n    With green boughs and quaint display\r\n    Glasses, where the maiden’s eye\r\n    May her own sweet face espy;\r\n    Ribands for her braided hair,\r\n    Beads to grace her bosom fair;\r\n    From yon stand the juggler plays\r\n    With the rustic crowd’s amaze;\r\n    There the morris-dancers stand,\r\n    Glad bells ringing on each hand;\r\n    Here the Maypole rears its crest,\r\n    With the rose and hawthorn drest;\r\n    And beside are painted bands\r\n    Of strange beasts from other lands.\r\n    In the midst, like the young queen,\r\n    Flower-crowned, of the rural green,\r\n    Is a bright-cheeked girl, her eye\r\n    Blue, like April’s morning sky,\r\n    With a blush, like what the rose\r\n    To her moonlight minstrel shows;\r\n    Laughing at her love the while,--\r\n    Yet such softness in the smile,\r\n    As the sweet coquette would hide\r\n    Woman’s love by woman’s pride.\r\n    Farewell, cities! who could bear\r\n    All their smoke and all their care,\r\n    All their pomp, when wooed away\r\n    By the azure hours of May?\r\n    Give me woodbine, scented bowers\r\n    Blue wreaths of the violet flowers,\r\n    Clear sky, fresh air, sweet birds, and trees,\r\n    Sights and sounds, and scenes like these!\r\n\r\n  L.

I however mention a custom at Northampton\r\non the first of May, with some hope that I am not troubling you with a\r\n“twice-told tale.”\r\n\r\nThe girls from the neighbouring villages of Kingsthorpe, &c. on the\r\nmorning of May-day, come into the town with May garlands, which they\r\nexhibit from house to house, (to show, as the inhabitants say, what\r\nflowers are in season,) and usually receive a trifle from each house.\r\nThe garland is composed of two hoops crossing each other vertically,\r\nand covered with flowers and streamers of various coloured ribands;\r\nthese are affixed to a staff about five feet long by which it is\r\ncarried, and in each of the apertures between the hoops is placed a\r\nsmartly dressed doll.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch will convey some idea of the garland. There are\r\nnumerous streamers attached to it, of all the colours of the rainbow.\r\nShould you think this notice worth inserting, I shall feel obliged by\r\nyour substituting any signature you please for my name, which, agreeable\r\nto your request to correspondents who communicate accounts of customs,\r\n&c., I subjoin.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  B.

B. The procession will start from the Bedford Arms,\r\n  Charlotte-street, Bedford-square, at eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the first of May, 1826, (pursuant to the above notice,) the\r\nfirst anniversary dinner of the “United Society of Master Chimney\r\nSweepers,” took place at the Eyre tavern, St. John’s-wood, Marylebone.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock, two hundred of their apprentices proceeded in\r\ngreat regularity through the principal streets and squares at the west\r\nend of the town, accompanied by an excellent band of music. The clean\r\nand wholesome appearance of the lads, certainly, reflected much credit\r\non their masters, and attracted crowds of persons to the above tavern,\r\nwhere the boys were regaled with a substantial repast of roast beef and\r\nplum-pudding; after which the masters themselves sat down to a very\r\nexcellent dinner provided for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the cloth being removed, and the usual routine of loyal toasts drank,\r\nthe chairman addressed his brother tradesmen, congratulating them on the\r\nformation of a society that was calculated to do such essential service\r\nto the trade in general. It would be the means of promoting the welfare\r\nof their apprentices,--which was a feeling he was convinced every one of\r\nthem had at heart,--who, instead of being permitted to loiter and dance\r\nabout the streets on the first of May, dressed up in tawdry apparel, and\r\nsoliciting money, should in future be regaled with substantial fare on\r\neach forthcoming day of the anniversary of the society, in order to put\r\nan end to the degrading practice which had for such a length of time\r\nstigmatized the trade. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n“Success to the United Society of Chimney Sweepers,” having been drank\r\nwith thunders of applause,\r\n\r\nMr. BENNETT, of Welbeck-street, addressed the company on the subject of\r\ncleansing chimnies with the machine, the introduction of which he was\r\nconfident would never answer the intended purposes. He urged the\r\nabsolute necessity of employing climbing boys in their trade; and\r\ninstanced several cases in which the machines were rendered perfectly\r\nuseless: most of the chimnies in the great houses at the west end of\r\nthe town were constructed in such a manner that it was utterly\r\nimpossible to clear them of soot, unless a human being was sent up for\r\nthat purpose. He admitted that some houses had chimnies which were built\r\nperpendicular; but even in those were frequently to be met with what the\r\ntrade called “cores,” which were large pieces of mortar that projected\r\nout from the brick-work, and that collected vast quantities of soot on\r\ntheir surface, so that no machine could get over the difficulty. When\r\nthe subject of the climbing boys was before the house of lords, he (Mr.\r\nBennett) was sent for by the earl of Hardwicke, who was desirous of\r\npersonally ascertaining whether the practice of allowing boys to ascend\r\nchimnies could be dispensed with entirely. He (Mr. Bennett) had attended\r\nat his lordship’s residence with the machine, which was tried in most of\r\nthe chimnies in the house, but the experiment failed; one of his\r\napprentices having been ultimately obliged to ascend for the purpose of\r\nextricating the machine from impediments which were only to be\r\nsurmounted by the activity of climbing boys. The result was, that his\r\nlordship subsequently expressed his opinion that the machines could\r\nnever answer the purposes for which they were originally intended, and\r\ntherefore had his chimnies swept by the old method. Mr. Bennett\r\nconcluded by making some observations on the harsh manner in which the\r\ntrade had been aspersed. He said it had been insinuated that their\r\napprentices, in consequence of being permitted to ascend chimnies, were\r\noften rendered objects for the remainder of their lives. There were, he\r\nadmitted, a few solitary instances of accidents happening in their trade\r\nas well as in every other. He now only wished that their opponents might\r\nhave an opportunity of witnessing the healthy and cheerful state in\r\nwhich their apprentices were.\r\n\r\nA master chimney-sweeper, with great vehemence of action and manner,\r\nsaid, “I am convinced, Mr. Chairman, that it is a thing impossible to do\r\naway with our climbing boys. For instance, look at the duke of York’s\r\nfifty-one new chimnies. Let me ask any one of you in company, is it\r\npossible a machine could be poked up any one of them? I say, no; and for\r\nthis reason--that most of them run in a horizontal line, and then\r\nabruptly turn up, so that you see a machine would be of no more use than\r\nif you were to thrust up an old broomstick; and I mean to stick to it,\r\nthat our opponents may as well try to put down chimney-sweepers in the\r\nold way, as the Equitable Loan Bank Company endeavoured to cut up the\r\nbusiness of the pawnbrokers. (Applause.) When I look round the table,\r\n(said the speaker,) and see such respectable gentlemen on my right and\r\non my left, and in front of me, who dares to say that the United Society\r\nof Master Chimney Sweepers are not as respectable a body of tradesmen as\r\nany in London? and although, if I may be excused the expression, there\r\nis not a gentleman now present that has not made his way in the\r\n‘profession,’ by climbing up chimnies. (There was a universal nod of\r\nassent at this allusion.) Therefore, continued the speaker, the more\r\npraise is due to us, and I now conclude by wishing every success to our\r\nnew society.” The above animated address was received with the loudest\r\nplaudits.\r\n\r\nSeveral other master chimney-sweepers addressed the company, after which\r\nthe ladies were introduced into the room, and dancing commenced, which\r\nwas kept up to a late hour.[154]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the first of May, 1807, the slave trade in the West Indies was\r\nproscribed by the British parliament, and we see by the proceedings at\r\nthe Eyre tavern, St. John’s-wood, that on the first of May, 1826, an\r\neffort was made to continue the more cruel black slavery of white\r\ninfants. Some remarks reported to have been made by these gentlemen in\r\nbehalf of their “black art,” require a word or two.\r\n\r\nWe are told that after the usual routine of loyal toasts, the chairman\r\ncongratulated his “brother tradesmen” on the formation of a society that\r\nwas calculated to do “essential service to _the trade_ in general.”\r\nThere can be no doubt that “the king” was the first name on their list\r\nof toasts, yet it happens that his majesty is at the head of an\r\nassociation for _abolishing_ their “trade.” The first names on the roll\r\nof “The Society for suspending Climbing Boys by the use of the\r\nScandiscope,” are those of the “patron,” and the president,\r\nvice-presidents, committee, and treasurer. These are chiefly prelates,\r\npeers, and members of the house of commons; but the “patron” of the\r\nsociety is “the king,” in opposition to whom, in the capacity of\r\n“patron,” Mr. Bennett, the master-sweep, of Welbeck-street, urges the\r\n“absolute necessity” of employing climbing boys. One of his reasons is,\r\nthat in some chimnies the bricklayers have “cores” of mortar whereon the\r\nsoot accumulates so that no machine can get over the difficulty; but\r\nthis only shows the “absolute necessity” of causing the “cores” to be\r\nremoved from chimnies already so deformed, and of making surveyors of\r\nfuture houses responsible for the expenses of alteration, if they suffer\r\nthem to be so improperly constructed. Mr. Bennett says, that lord\r\nHardwicke was convinced “the machines could never answer the purposes\r\nfor which they were originally intended, and therefore had his chimnies\r\nswept by the old method.” If his lordship _did_ express that opinion, it\r\nis in opposition to the opinion of the king, as “patron,” the late\r\nbishop of Durham, the present bishop of Oxford, the duke of Bedford, the\r\nlords Grosvenor, Morley, Harrowby, Gwydir, Auckland, and other\r\ndistinguished individuals, who as president and vice-presidents of the\r\nsociety, had better opportunities of determining correctly, than Mr.\r\nBennett probably afforded to earl Hardwicke.\r\n\r\nAnother “master chimney-sweeper” is reported to have said, “look at the\r\nduke of York’s fifty-one new chimnies:--most of them run in a horizontal\r\nline, and then abruptly turn up, so that, you see, a machine would be of\r\nno more use than if you were to thrust up an old broomstick:” and then\r\nhe asks, “who dares to say that the United Society of Master Chimney\r\nSweepers are not as respectable a body of tradesmen as any in London?”\r\nand triumphantly adds, that “there is not a gentleman now present that\r\nhas not made his way in the _profession_ by climbing up chimnies.” To\r\nthis “there was a universal nod of assent.” But a universal admission by\r\nall “the gentlemen present” that they had climbed to respectability by\r\nclimbing up chimnies, is of very little weight with those who observe\r\nand know that willing slaves become the greatest and most effective\r\noppressors; and as to the duke of York’s new chimnies, it is not\r\ncredible his royal highness can be informed that the present\r\nconstruction of his chimnies necessarily dooms unborn infants to the\r\ncertain fate of having the flesh torn from their joints before they can\r\nsweep such chimnies. The scandalous default of a surveyor has subjected\r\nthe duke of York to the odium of being quoted as an authority in\r\nopposition to a society for abolishing a cruel and useless trade,\r\nwherein servitude is misery, and independence cannot be attained but by\r\nthe continual infliction of blows and torture on helpless children. Yet\r\nas an act of parliament abated the frequency of conflagrations, by\r\nempowering district surveyors to cause the erection of party walls, so a\r\nfew clauses added to the building act would authorize the surveyors to\r\nenforce the building of future chimnies without “cores,” and of a form\r\nto be swept by the “Scandiscope.” Master chimney-sweepers would have no\r\nreason to complain of such enactment, inasmuch as they would continue to\r\nfind employment, till the old chimnies and the prejudices in favour of\r\ncruelty to children, disappeared by effluxion of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe engraving at the head of this article is altered from a lithographic\r\nprint representing a “Scandiscope.” Perhaps the machine may be better\r\nunderstood from the annexed diagram. It simply consists of a whalebone\r\nbrush, and wooden cylinders strung on rope, and put into action by the\r\nmethod described beneath the larger engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. George Smart obtained two gold medals from the Society of Arts for\r\nthis invention. The names of the machine chimney-sweepers in different\r\nparts of London may be obtained from Mr. Wilt, secretary of the\r\n“Society for superseding Climbing Boys,” No. 125, Leadenhall-street; the\r\ntreasurer of the institution is W. Tooke, esq., F. R. S. Any person may\r\nbecome a member, and acquaint himself with the easy methods by which the\r\nmachine is adopted to almost any chimney. As the climbing\r\nchimney-sweepers are combining to oppose it, all humane individuals will\r\nfeel it a duty to inquire whether they should continue willing\r\ninstruments in the hands of the “profession” for the extension of the\r\npresent cruel practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late Mrs. Montagu gave an annual dinner to the poor climbing boys\r\nwhich ceased with her death.\r\n\r\n    And is all pity for the poor sweeps fled,\r\n    Since Montagu is numbered with the dead?\r\n    She who did once the many sorrows weep,\r\n    That met the wanderings of the woe-worn sweep!\r\n    Who, once a year, bade all his griefs depart,\r\n    On May’s sweet morn would doubly cheer his heart!\r\n    Washed was his little form, his shirt was clean,\r\n    On that _one_ day his real face was seen,\r\n    His shoeless feet, _now_ boasted pumps--and new.\r\n    The brush and shovel gaily held to view!\r\n    The table spread, his every sense was charmed,\r\n    And every savoury smell his bosom warmed;\r\n    His light heart joyed to see such goodly cheer,\r\n    And much he longed to taste the mantling beer:\r\n    His hunger o’er--the scene was little heaven--\r\n    If riches thus can bless, what blessings might be given!\r\n    But, she is gone! none left to soothe their grief,\r\n    Or, once a year, bestow their meed of beef!\r\n    Now forth he’s dragged to join the beggar’s dance;\r\n    With heavy heart, he makes a slow advance,\r\n    Loudly to clamour for that tyrant’s good,\r\n    Who gives with scanty hand his daily food!\r\n\r\nIt is the _interest_ of the “United Society of Master Chimney Sweepers”\r\nto appear liberal to the wretched beings who are the creatures of their\r\nmercy; of the variation and degrees of that mercy, there is evidence\r\nbefore the committee of the house of commons. Sympathy for the oppressed\r\nin the breast of their oppressors is reasonably to be suspected. On the\r\nminutes of the “Society for superseding Climbing Boys,” there are cases\r\nthat make humanity shudder; against their recurrence there is no\r\nsecurity but the general adoption of machines in chimnies--instead of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Montgomery’s “Chimney Sweeper’s Friend, and Climbing Boys’ Album,”\r\nis a volume of affecting appeal, dedicated to the king, “in honour of\r\nhis majesty’s condescending and exemplary concern for the effectual\r\ndeliverance of the meanest, the poorest, and weakest of British born\r\nsubjects, from unnatural, unnecessary, and unjustifiable personal\r\nslavery and moral degradation.” It contains a variety of beautiful\r\ncompositions in prose and verse: one of them is--\r\n\r\nTHE CHIMNEY SWEEPER.\r\n\r\n_Communicated by_ Mr. Charles Lamb, _from a very rare and curious little\r\nwork_, Mr. Blake’s “Songs of Innocence.”\r\n\r\n    When my mother died I was very young,\r\n    And my father sold me, while yet my tongue\r\n    Could scarcely cry, “Weep! weep! weep!”\r\n    So your chimnies I sweep, and in soot I sleep.\r\n\r\n    There’s little Tom Toddy, who cried when his head,\r\n    That was curl’d like a lamb’s back, was shaved, so I said,\r\n    “Hush, Tom, never mind it for when your head’s bare,\r\n    You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.”\r\n\r\n    And so he was quiet, and that very night\r\n    As Tom was a sleeping, he had such a sight,\r\n    That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,\r\n    Were all of them locked up in coffins so black.\r\n\r\n    And by came an angel, who had a bright key,\r\n    And he opened the coffins, and set them all free;\r\n    Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,\r\n    And wash in a river, and shine in the sun,\r\n\r\n    Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,\r\n    They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;\r\n    And the angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy\r\n    He’d have God for his father, and never want joy.\r\n\r\n    And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,\r\n    And got with our bags and our brushes to work;\r\n    Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm,\r\n    So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dining with Duke Humphrey_,\r\n\r\nMAY DAY HONOURS TO HIM.\r\n\r\nIn old St. Paul’s cathedral “within a proper chappel purposely made for\r\nhim,” and in a proper tomb, sir John Beauchamp, constable of Dover, and\r\nwarden of the cinque ports, was buried in the year 1358. “This deceased\r\nnobleman,” says Stow, “by ignorant people hath been erroneously\r\nmistermed and said to be duke Humfrey, the good duke of Gloucester, who\r\nlyeth honourably buried at Saint Albans in Hartfordshire, twenty miles\r\nfrom London; in idle and frivolous opinion of whom, some men, of late\r\ntimes, have made a solemne meeting at his tombe upon Saint Andrewe’s day\r\nin the morning (before Christmasse) and concluded on a breakfast or\r\ndinner, as assuring themselves to be servants, and to hold diversity of\r\noffices under the good duke Humfrey.”\r\n\r\nStow’s continuator says, “Likewise, on _May-day_, tankard bearers,\r\nwatermen, and some other of like quality beside, would use to come to\r\nthe same tombe early in the morning, and, according as the other,\r\ndeliver serviceable presentation at the same monument, by strewing\r\nherbes, and sprinkling faire water on it, as in the duty of servants,\r\nand according to their degrees and charges in office: but (as Master\r\nStow hath discreetly advised such as are so merrily disposed, or simply\r\nprofess themselves to serve duke Humfrey in Pauls) if punishment of\r\n_losing their dinners_ daily, there, be not sufficient for them, they\r\nshould be sent to St. Albans, to answer there for their disobedience,\r\nand long absence from their so highly well deserving lord and master, as\r\nin their merry disposition they please so to call him.”\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this mock solemnity on May-day, and the feast\r\nof St. Andrew, on pretence of attending a festival in Paul’s, on the\r\ninvitation of a dead nobleman in another place, gave rise to the saying\r\nconcerning “dining with duke Humfrey.” It is still used respecting\r\npersons who inquire “where shall I dine?” or who have lost, or are\r\nafraid of “losing their dinners.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTERS’ MAY FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars of a very curious celebration is remarkable,\r\nas being a description of the old mode of festivous enjoyment,\r\n“according to order,” and the wearing of garlands by the stewards, with\r\n“whifflers” in the procession.[155] It is extracted from Randle Holme’s\r\n“Storehouse of Armory, 1688.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stationers’ Hall May Feast._\r\n\r\nThe Printers, Journeymen, with the Founders and Ink-makers have every\r\nyear a general Feast, which is kept in the Stationers Hall on or about\r\nMay Day. It is made by 4 Stewards, 2 Masters, and 2 Journeymen; and with\r\nthe Collection of half a Crown a piece of every Guest, the charges of\r\nthe whole Feast is defrayed.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 of the Clock in the Morning on the Feast day, the Company\r\ninvited meet at the place appointed, and from thence go to some Church\r\nthereabouts in this following Order. First, 4 Whifflers (as Servitures)\r\nby two and two, walking before with white Staves in their Hands, and red\r\nand blew Ribbons hung Belt-wise upon their Shoulders: these make way for\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nThen walks the Beadle of the Company of Stationers, with the Companies\r\nStaff in his Hand, and Ribbons as afore.\r\n\r\nThen the Minister, whom the Stewards have engaged to Preach the Sermon,\r\nand his Reader or Clerk.\r\n\r\nThen the Stewards walk, by two and two, with long white wands in their\r\nHands, and all the rest of the Company follow in like order, till they\r\nenter the Church, &c. Service ended, and a Sermon suitable for the\r\noccasion finished, they all return to their Hall in the same order,\r\nwhere upon their entrance each Guest delivers his Ticket to a Person\r\nappointed, which gives him admittance; where every one Feasts himself\r\nwith what he likes best, being delighted all the while with Musicks and\r\nSongs, &c.\r\n\r\nAfter Dinner the Ceremony of Electing new Stewards for the next Year\r\nbegins: then the Stewards withdraw into another Room, and put Garlands\r\nof Laurel or Box on their Heads, and white wands in their Hands, and are\r\nUshered out of the withdrawing Room thus;--\r\n\r\nFirst, the Companies Beadle with his Staff in his Hand, and Musick\r\nsounding before him;\r\n\r\nThen one of the Whifflers with a great Bowl of White wine and Sugar in\r\nhis right Hand, and his Staff in the left: after him follows the eldest\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\nThen another Whiffler as aforesaid, before the second Steward; in like\r\nmanner another Whiffler before the third; and another before the fourth\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they walk, with Musick sounding before them, three times round\r\nthe Hall; and, in the fourth round, the first Steward takes the Bowl\r\nfrom his Whiffler, and Drinks to one (whom before he resolved on) by the\r\nTitle of _Mr. Steward Elect_; and taking the Garland off his own\r\nHead, puts it on the Steward Elect’s Head, at which all the Company clap\r\ntheir Hands in token of Joy.\r\n\r\nThen the present Steward takes out the Steward elect, and Walks with\r\nhim, hand in hand, (giving him the right Hand,) behind the three other\r\nStewards, another round the Hall; and in the next round as aforesaid,\r\nthe second Steward drinks to another with the same Ceremony as the first\r\ndid; and so the third, and so the fourth. And then all walk one round\r\nmore, hand in hand, about the Hall, that the Company may take Notice of\r\nthe Stewards Elect: and so ends the Ceremony of the Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Old Watch Tower~\r\n\r\nOF THE CITY WALL.]\r\n\r\nThis is a front view of a watch tower, or one of the barbicans, on the\r\ncity wall, which was discovered near Ludgate-hill on the first of May,\r\n1792.

A. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following poetical Composition appeared in the Morning Herald of May\r\n1, 1800; and it is reprinted at the very particular request of several\r\npersons, votaries of the Opera, Fashion, Wit, and Poetry, who were\r\ndesirous that it should be preserved in a less perishable form than that\r\nof a Newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of THE ARM-CHAIRS being placed in the Pit at the Opera\r\nHouse was this. Before the opening of the Opera House this season, _it\r\nwas generally understood_, that HIS MAJESTY had graciously signified to\r\nLord Salisbury his concern, that any of the Subscribers should be\r\ndeprived of their Boxes on the nights when HIS MAJESTY honoured the\r\nTheatre with his presence. This being communicated to Mr. Taylor, he\r\nobserved that the ROYAL objection might easily be obviated, by detaching\r\nthe last Row from the Pit, on these occasions, for the reception of the\r\nSubscribers. This was done accordingly, and _a Row of_ ARM-CHAIRS, _with\r\nLocks and Keys to the bottoms of them_, were placed there, which on\r\nevery other night were to be free for general accommodation. But about\r\ntwo months after, the Arm-Chairs were removed, and a long bench was\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nOn this great event, the Editor has no _Intercepted Letters_ to lay\r\nbefore the public _by authority_, and therefore he has not applied to\r\nMr. Canning for a Preface, nor for Notes to Mr. Gifford. There is no\r\nEgyptian _Fast_ to be solemnized, nor _Festival_ to be celebrated. He\r\ncan assure them also, that neither the Mustapha Raschid Effendi and\r\nMustapha Ressichi Effendi for the Grand Vizir; nor General Dessaix and\r\nCitizen Poussielgue for General Kleber, were Commissioners on signing\r\nthis Convention. But THE EVACUATION OF THE ARM-ED CHAIRS was effected\r\nwithout bloodshed or loss on either side, by LORD GALLOWAY and Mr. BELL,\r\nCommissioners on the part of the Amateurs and Conoscenti, and by Signor\r\nLORENZO DA PONTE, Poet to the Opera House, and Mr. SOLOMON, Leader of\r\nthe Band, Commissioners on the part of General Taylor and the Dramatic\r\nField Marshal THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY. _The Arm-ed Chairs_ were\r\nsurrendered three days after the signing of the Capitulation, without\r\nthe intervention of any gallant _Knight_[156] from Sweden or from Malta.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus far is from the preface, and after a few remarks and a “_Scena_” in\r\nItalian, the poem alluded to, and here reprinted verbatim, is introduced\r\nin the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  _March 19, 1800._\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  _A month or two ago, Lord Galloway came to the Opera, and on the\r\n  Pit-door near the Orchestra being opened, he perceived, to his\r\n  confusion and astonishment, that a long Bench was substituted in the\r\n  place of the_ ROW OF ARM-CHAIRS _at the bottom of the Pit, the\r\n  principal or central of which he had filled for so many nights with\r\n  discernment and dignity, and to the general satisfaction of every\r\n  person present. His Lordship conceiving, rather hastily, that this\r\n  measure was intended as a personal slight to himself, retired\r\n  disconcerted, without taking his seat; and, as he is a votary of the\r\n  Muses, penned the following Lamentation, which he sent to Lord\r\n  Salisbury the next day, and recovered his wonted good humour,\r\n  cheerfulness, and gayety._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  PANDOLFO ATTONITO!\r\n\r\n  OR,\r\n\r\n  LORD GALLOWAY’S\r\n\r\n  POETICAL LAMENTATION\r\n\r\n  ON THE\r\n\r\n  _REMOVAL OF THE ARM-CHAIRS_\r\n\r\n  FROM THE\r\n\r\n  PIT AT THE OPERA HOUSE!\r\n\r\n    WHAT!--the proud honours of the chair\r\n    Must I no more, with CECIL(_a_), share?--\r\n        Still be my soul serene\r\n    _Virtù_, or virtue’s but a name,\r\n    Brutus and Galloway exclaim,\r\n        And sighing quit the scene.\r\n\r\n    Too sure I heard a warning knell,\r\n    And told my Critic Brother BELL(_b_)\r\n        The fall of seats(_c_) and _stocks_;\r\n    Yet fondly sooth’d by BOLLA’S airs,\r\n    Thought TAYLOR’S _bottom_, and his chairs\r\n        Secure with keys and locks.(_d_)\r\n\r\n    But ah! how Fortune loves to joke!\r\n    Expell’d am I, who sung and spoke\r\n        As loud as at the Fair:(_e_)\r\n    While yearly, with six thousand pound,\r\n    The Commons ADDINGTON have bound\r\n        Their Servant TO THE CHAIR.\r\n\r\n    My purer taste, my classic eye,\r\n    Unzon’d Thalia could descry,\r\n        Who stepp’d beyond her place:\r\n    How oft I warn’d, in either house,\r\n    That charms _too plain_ at last would rouse\r\n        The _Mitre_ and the _Mace_!\r\n\r\n    I with Pandolfo watch’d the sphere,\r\n    When Mars on Venus shone so clear,\r\n        That Saturn(_f_) felt the shock:\r\n    Grave SHUTE and HENRY shrunk at Love,\r\n    And at the loose flesh-colour’d glove,\r\n        That blush’d _at twelve o’clock_.\r\n\r\n    I said, some folks would thunder Greek\r\n    At HILLIGSBERG’S _Morale lubrique_,\r\n        And PARISOT’S _costume_!(_g_)\r\n    Where shall Paull_inia_, tight and round,(_h_)\r\n    In vest appropriate now be found,\r\n        With India’s palm and plume?\r\n\r\n    Old Q--NSB--RY feels his dotard qualm,\r\n    Terpsichorè can pour no balm\r\n        O’er _half_ his visual ray;\r\n    Nor WILLIAM(_i_) can console the Sag,\r\n    Nor Elisée(_k_) his pain assuage,\r\n        Nor Yarmouth smooth his way.\r\n\r\n    When MARINARI’S(_l_) magic hand\r\n    Traced the bold view in fabled land,\r\n        For Fawns and Wood-nymphs meet\r\n    Ah, soon, I cried, may SAL’SB’RY think,\r\n    ’Tis just, that they who dance should drink,\r\n        And they who sing, should eat.

Welner, a German chemist, retired to his house in the\r\ncountry, there to devote himself, without being disturbed, to the study\r\nand examination of poisonous substances for the purpose of producing a\r\ncomplete “_Toxicology_,” established by undeniable proof. He tried his\r\npoisons upon himself, and appeared insensible to the great alterations\r\nwhich such dangerous trials produced upon his health. At the latter end\r\nof the month of October, he invented some unknown poisonous mixture; and\r\nwished to be assured of its effect. The following is the account which\r\nhe gives of it in the last page of his manuscript:--“A potion composed\r\nof--(here the substances are named, and the doses indicated)--is mortal;\r\nand the proof of it is--_that I am dying!_”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 52·55.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 3.~\r\n\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF THE CROSS.\r\n\r\nFor the origin of this church of England holiday, see vol. i. p. 611.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A PIE SAT ON A PEAR TREE.”\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _May 3, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--There is a custom at Yarmouth dinners, which in my opinion would\r\nbe “more honoured in the breach than the observance.” After the cloth\r\nhas been removed, and the ladies have retired, some one in the company,\r\nwho is an adept in the game, sings the following lines,--\r\n\r\n    “A pie sat on a pear tree,\r\n    A pie sat on a pear tree,\r\n    A pie sat on a pear tree,\r\n    Heigh oh! heigh oh! heigh oh!”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion, the person sitting next to the singer continues the\r\nstrain thus,--\r\n\r\n    “And once so merrily hopp’d she;”\r\n\r\nduring which the first singer is obliged to drink a bumper, and should\r\nhe be unable to empty his glass before the last line is sung, he must\r\nbegin again until he succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty consists in swallowing the liquor fast enough, many\r\ngetting tipsy before they are able to accomplish it.

The language, indeed, has retained its\r\nolden character, but of peculiar customs little is known. In Lysons’\r\n“Magna Britannia,” the practices of rush-bearing, of hanging up white\r\ngloves and garlands of roses in the churches, at the funerals of young\r\nmaidens,--of foot-ball plays, now confined to Derby, and this\r\nwell-dressing of Tissington are the sum total of those notices under the\r\nhead of “Country Customs.” A correspondent communicated to the\r\n_Every-Day Book_ in March, a custom existing near Tideswell; and I have\r\nseen it stated in a provincial paper, that a right is claimed in the\r\nPeak Forest of marrying after the fashion of Gretna Green, and that such\r\na wedding actually took place not very long ago. Something more of this\r\nshould be known.\r\n\r\nTissington well-dressing is a festivity, which not only claims a high\r\nantiquity, but is one of the few country fêtes which are kept up with\r\nany thing like the ancient spirit. It is one which is heartily loved and\r\nearnestly anticipated. One which draws the hearts of those who were\r\nbrought up there, but whom fortune has cast into distant places,\r\nhomewards with an irresistible charm. I have not had the pleasure of\r\nwitnessing it, but I have had that of seeing the joy which sparkled in\r\nthe eyes of the Tissingtonians as they talked of its approach, and of\r\ntheir projected attendance. Long before the time arrives, they have\r\ncanvassed the neighbourhoods where they reside, for flowers to take with\r\nthem: and these flowers, in all the instances which have come under my\r\nnotice have been _red daisies_, and none else. If, however, John\r\nEdwards, in his poem, “The Tour of the Dove,” be correct, others must be\r\nused, and those wild flowers:--\r\n\r\n    “Still Dovedale yield thy flowers to deck the fountains\r\n      Of Tissington, upon its holyday;\r\n    The customs long preserved among the mountains\r\n      Should not be lightly left to pass away.\r\n    They have their moral; and we often may\r\n      Learn from them how our wise forefathers wrought,\r\n    When they upon the public mind would lay\r\n      Some weighty principle, some maxim brought\r\n    Home to their hearts, the healthful product of deep thought.”\r\n\r\nIn a note he adds;--“The custom of decorating wells with flowers, and\r\nattending them with religious services and festive rejoicings on Holy\r\nThursday, is not peculiar to Tissington. Many other wells have been\r\ncommitted to the patronage of the saints, and treated with reverence;\r\nsome on account of the purity, and others for the medicinal virtues of\r\ntheir waters. St. Alkmund’s well at Derby, is an instance of the former\r\nclass, where the name has been continued long after the superstition\r\nwhich gave it has passed away. In the dark ages of popery, this\r\nveneration for holy wells was carried to an idolatrous excess, insomuch,\r\nthat in the reigns of Edgar and Canute, it was found necessary to issue\r\nedicts prohibiting well-worship. But the principle of veneration for\r\nwaters, if restricted within its proper bounds, is amiable: indeed, it\r\nseems to have been implanted in the breast of man in all ages. A\r\nfountain is the emblem of purity and benevolence. From the days when the\r\npatriarchs journeyed in the wilderness, down to the present\r\nperiod--whether bursting from the arid sands of the African desert, or\r\nswelling out its genial waters amid the Greenland snows--its soft\r\nmelody, its refreshing virtues, and its transparency, have ever been a\r\nsubject of delight and interest to the human race. Who could have\r\napproached the Bethesda of the Jews with a callous heart? Who could have\r\nlistened to the song of Israel with indifference, when her princes had\r\ndigged the well, and her nobles and lawgiver stood around it?”\r\n\r\nRhodes, who has traversed almost every part of the peak with\r\nindefatigable zeal, gives the following account in his “Peak Scenery.”\r\n“An ancient custom still prevails in the village of Tissington, to which\r\nindeed it appears to be confined, for I have not met with any thing of a\r\nsimilar description in any other part of Derbyshire. It is denominated\r\n_well-flowering_, and Holy Thursday is devoted to the rites and\r\nceremonies of this elegant custom. This day is regarded as a festival;\r\nand all the wells in the place, five in number, are decorated with\r\nwreaths and garlands of newly-gathered flowers, disposed in various\r\ndevices. Sometimes boards are used, which are cut to the figure intended\r\nto be represented, and covered with moist clay, into which the stems of\r\nthe flowers are inserted to preserve their freshness; and they are so\r\narranged as to form a beautiful mosaic work, often tasteful in design,\r\nand vivid in colouring: the boards, thus adorned, are so placed in the\r\nspring, that the water appears to issue from amongst beds of flowers. On\r\nthis occasion the villagers put on their best attire, and open their\r\nhouses to their friends. There is service at the church, where a sermon\r\nis preached: afterwards a procession takes place, and the wells are\r\nvisited in succession: the psalms for the day, the epistle and gospel\r\nare read, one at each well, and the whole concludes with a hymn which is\r\nsung by the church singers, and accompanied by a band of music. This\r\ndone, they separate, and the remainder of the day is spent in rural\r\nsports and holiday pastimes.\r\n\r\nThe custom of well-flowering as it exists at Tissington, is said to be a\r\npopish relic; but in whatever way it originated, one would regret to see\r\nit discontinued. That it is of great antiquity cannot be disputed; it\r\nseems to have existed at different periods of time, in countries far\r\nremote from each other. In the earliest ages of poetry and romance,\r\nwherever fountains and wells were situated, the common people were\r\naccustomed to honour them with the title of saints. In our own country\r\ninnumerable instances occur of wells being so denominated.” “Where a\r\nspring rises or a river flows,” says Seneca, “there should we build\r\naltars, and offer sacrifices.” At the fountain of Arethusa in Syracuse,\r\nof which every reader of poetry and history has often heard, great\r\nfestivals were celebrated every year. In Roman antiquity the\r\n_fontinalia_ were religious feasts, held in honour of the nymphs of\r\nwells and fountains; the ceremony consisted in throwing nosegays into\r\nfountains, and putting crowns of flowers upon wells. Many authorities\r\nmight be quoted in support of the antiquity of this elegant custom,\r\nwhich had its origin anterior to the introduction of christianity. It\r\nwas mingled with the rites and ceremonies of the heathens, who were\r\naccustomed to worship streams and fountains, and to suppose that the\r\nnymphs, whom they imagined the goddesses of the waters, presided over\r\nthem. Shaw in his “History of the Province of Morray,” says, that\r\n“heathen customs were much practised amongst the people there;” and he\r\ncites as an instance, “that they performed pilgrimages to wells, and\r\nbuilt chapels to fountains.”\r\n\r\n“From this ancient usage, which has been continued through a long\r\nsuccession of ages, and is still in existence at Tissington, arose the\r\npractice of sprinkling the Severn and the rivers of Wales with flowers,\r\nas alluded to by Dyer in his poem of the _Fleece_ and by Milton in his\r\n_Comus_.--\r\n\r\n    --------------With light fantastic toe the nymphs\r\n    Thither assembled, thither every swain;\r\n    And o’er the dimpled stream a thousand flowers,\r\n    Pale lilies, roses, violets and pinks,\r\n    Mixed with the green of burnet, mint, and thyme,\r\n    And trefoil, sprinkled with their sportive arms:\r\n    Such custom holds along the irriguous vales,\r\n    From Wreakin’s brow to archy Dolvoryn.\r\n\r\n  _Dyer._\r\n\r\n    ----------------The shepherds at their festivals\r\n    Carol her good deeds loud in rustic lays,\r\n    And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream,\r\n    Of pancies, pinks, and gaudy daffodils.\r\n\r\n  _Milton._”\r\n\r\nI hope some of your correspondents will contribute to our information by\r\naccounts of well-dressings in other parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAFTESBURY “BYZANT.”\r\n\r\nThe town of Shaftesbury from its situation on the top of a high hill, is\r\nentirely destitute of springs; except at the foot of the hills in St.\r\nJames’s parish, where are two wells, in the possession of private\r\npersons. At the foot of Castle-hill were formerly some water-works, to\r\nsupply the town, their reservoir was on the top of the Butter cross; but\r\nthe inhabitants have from time immemorial been supplied with water\r\nbrought on horse’s backs, or on people’s heads, from three or four large\r\nwells, a quarter of a mile below the town in the hamlet of Motcomb, and\r\nparish of Gillingham; on which account there is this particular custom\r\nyearly observed by ancient agreement, dated 1662, between the lord of\r\nthe manor of Gillingham, and the mayor and burgesses of Shaftesbury. The\r\nmayor is obliged the Monday before Holy Thursday to dress up a prize\r\nbesom, or _byzant_, as they call it, somewhat like a May garland in\r\nform, with gold and peacock’s feathers, and carry it to Enmore Green,\r\nhalf a mile below the town, in Motcomb, as an acknowledgment for the\r\nwater; together with a raw calf’s head, a pair of gloves, a gallon of\r\nbeer, or ale, and two penny loaves of white wheaten bread, which the\r\nsteward receives, and carries away to his own use. The ceremony being\r\nover, the “byzant” is restored to the mayor, and brought back by one of\r\nhis officers with great solemnity. This “byzant” is generally so richly\r\nadorned with plate and jewels, borrowed from the neighbouring gentry, as\r\nto be worth not less than 1500_l._[175]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESSION OF THE CAMEL.\r\n\r\nHoly Thursday was formerly a day of great festivity at Beziers, in\r\nFrance, and was celebrated with a variety of little sports.\r\n\r\n“The Procession of the Camel” constituted one part of them. A figure\r\nrepresenting that animal, with a man in the inside, was made to perform\r\nridiculous tricks. The municipal officers, attended by the companies of\r\nthe different trades and manufactures, preceded the camel. It was\r\nfollowed by a cart, over which were branches of trees twined into an\r\narbour, filled with people: the cart was drawn by mules ornamented with\r\nbunches of flowers and ribands; a number of people stuck over with\r\nflowers and little twigs of trees, who were called the “wild men,”\r\nfollowed the cart and closed the procession. After parading about the\r\ntown all day, towards evening the whole company repaired to the chapel\r\nof the Blue Penitents, where it was met by the chapter of the cathedral,\r\nwho had previously also gone in procession round the town, and then a\r\nlarge quantity of bread was given away by the chapter among the poor.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the ceremonies of the day was, that the peasants from\r\nthe country assembled in the streets with crooks in their hands, and\r\nranging themselves in long files on each side, made mock skirmishes with\r\ntheir crooks, aiming strokes at each other, and parrying them with great\r\ndexterity. Each of these skirmishes ended with a dance to the fife and\r\ntabourine. The inhabitants threw sugar-plums and dried fruits at each\r\nother from their windows, or as they passed in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe day usually concluded by a favourite dance among the young men and\r\nwomen, called _la danse des treilles_. Every dancer carried a _cerceau_,\r\nas it is called, that is a half hoop, twined with vine branches; and\r\nranging themselves in long files on each, side of the street, formed\r\ndifferent groups. The young men were all dressed in white jackets and\r\ntrowsers, and the young women in white jackets with short petticoats,\r\nand ornaments of flowers and ribands. These sports of Beziers were\r\nsuspended during the revolution.[176]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 52·77.\r\n\r\n  [175] Hutchins’s Dorset.\r\n\r\n  [176] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 5.~\r\n\r\n\r\n“A PARTICULAR FACT.”\r\n\r\nTHE INDEXES, &c. _to the_ EVERY-DAY BOOK, VOL. I. _were published on the\r\n5th of May, 1826_.\r\n\r\nThe new preface to the volume is particularly addressed to the notice of\r\n_correspondents_, and I shall be particularly obliged if _every reader_\r\nof the work will favour it with attentive perusal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed of Joseph Baretti, who died on this day in the\r\nyear 1789, that he was the friend and associate of Johnson, who\r\nintroduced him to the Thrale family, and whom he assisted in the\r\ncompilation of his “Dictionary of the English Language.”\r\n\r\nBaretti was a native of Turin; he had received a good education, and\r\ninherited paternal property, which in his youth he soon gambled away,\r\nand resorted to a livelihood by teaching Italian to some English\r\ngentlemen at Venice; whence he repaired to England, and distinguished\r\nhimself as a teacher of Italian. By his employment under Dr. Johnson, he\r\nacquired such a knowledge of our language as to be enabled to compile\r\nthe “Italian and English Dictionary,” which is still in use. He then\r\nrevisited his native country, and after an absence of six years returned\r\nthrough Spain and Portugal, and in 1768 published “An Account of the\r\nManners and Customs of Italy,” in reply to some querulous strictures on\r\nthat country in the “Letters from Italy” by surgeon Sharp, which\r\nBaretti’s book effectually put down, with no small portion both of\r\nhumour and argument. Not long afterwards, he was accosted in the\r\nHaymarket by a woman, whom he repulsed with a degree of roughness which\r\nwas resented by her male confederates, and in the scuffle, he struck one\r\nof them with a French pocket dessert knife. On this, the man pursued and\r\ncollared him; when Baretti, still more alarmed, stabbed him repeatedly\r\nwith the knife, of which wounds he died on the following day. He was\r\nimmediately taken into custody, and tried for murder at the Old Bailey,\r\nwhen Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Garrick, Reynolds, and Beauclerk gave\r\ntestimony to his good character; and although he did not escape censure\r\nfor his too ready resort to a knife, he was acquitted. Domesticated in\r\nthe Thrale family, he accompanied them and Dr. Johnson to Paris, but in\r\na fit of unreasonable disgust, quitted them the next year; and in the\r\nlatter part of his life was harassed with pecuniary difficulties, which\r\nwere very little alleviated by his honorary post of foreign secretary to\r\nthe Royal Academy, and an ill-paid pension of eighty pounds per annum\r\nunder the North administration. Among other works he published one with\r\nthe singular title of “Tolondron: Speeches to John Bowles about his\r\nedition of Don Quixote, together with some account of Spanish\r\nLiterature.” This was his last production; his constitution was broken\r\nby uneasiness of mind and frequent attacks of the gout, and he died in\r\nMay, 1789.\r\n\r\nBaretti was rough and cynical in appearance, yet a pleasant companion;\r\nand of his powers in conversation Johnson thought very highly.\r\n\r\nHe communicated several of Dr. Johnson’s letters to the “European\r\nMagazine,” and intended to publish several more; but on his decease his\r\npapers fell into the hands of ignorant executors, who barbarously\r\ncommitted them to the flames.[177]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that with Johnson’s scrupulous attachment to the\r\ndoctrines and ceremonies of the church of England, he was sincerely\r\nattached to Baretti, whose notions on religious matters widely differed\r\nfrom the opinions of “the great lexicographer.” Johnson seems to have\r\nbeen won by his friend’s love of literature and independence of\r\ncharacter. Baretti often refused pecuniary aid when it was greatly\r\nneeded by his circumstances: his morals were pure, and his conduct,\r\nexcept in the unhappy instance which placed his life in jeopardy, was\r\nuniformly correct.

The manner in which these fish are caught is somewhat\r\ncurious; it is a sort of hunting at sea. The nets are extended in the\r\nwater so as to close upon the fish when they come within reach of them,\r\nand then the boats chase them to that part where they are taken: they\r\nhave great force in their tails, so that much caution is required in\r\ngetting them aboard. Vernet among his other sea-pieces has a very good\r\none of this fishery. There are four principal places near Marseilles\r\nwhere it is carried on, called the _madragues_, which are rented out to\r\nthe fishers, by the town, at a considerable advantage. When Louis XIII.\r\nvisited Marseilles in 1662, he was invited to a thunny fishing at the\r\nprincipal madrague of Morgion, and found the diversion so much to his\r\ntaste, that he often said it was the pleasantest day he had spent in his\r\nwhole progress through the south.\r\n\r\nThe thunnies come in such shoals, that in the height of the season, that\r\nis, in the months of May and June, from five to six hundred are\r\nsometimes taken in a day at one madrague only: they commonly weigh from\r\nabout ten to twenty or twenty-five pounds each, but they have been known\r\nto weigh even as much as fifty pounds. They are very delicious food, but\r\nthe flesh is so solid that it seems something between fish and meat; it\r\nis as firm as sturgeon, but beyond all comparison finer flavoured. They\r\ndress this fish in France in a great variety of ways, and always\r\nexcellent: it makes capital soup, or it is served as a ragout, or plain\r\nfried or broiled; pies are made of it, which are so celebrated as to be\r\nsent all over France; they will keep good for six weeks or two months.\r\nThere is also a way of preserving it to keep the whole year round with\r\nsalt and oil, called _thon mariné_: this is eaten cold, as we eat\r\npickled salmon, and is delicious. Besides the great season in May and\r\nJune, they are caught in considerable numbers in the autumn, about\r\nNovember, which is the great season for making the pies. A large\r\nquantity of them were sent to Paris against Buonaparte’s coronation.\r\nStragglers of these fish are occasionally taken the whole year round.\r\nThey are an ugly fish to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe palamede, though much smaller than the thunny, seems so much of the\r\nsame nature that some persons have supposed it only the young thunny;\r\nbut naturalists say that it is a distinct species of fish. It is\r\nmentioned by Gibbon in his description of Constantinople, as, at the\r\ntime of the foundation of that city, the most celebrated among the\r\nvariety of excellent fish taken in the Propontis.[178]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·70.\r\n\r\n  [178] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 8.~\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE FURRY.”\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of May, at Helston, in Cornwall, is held what is called\r\n“the Furry.” The word is supposed by Mr. Polwhele to have been derived\r\nfrom the old Cornish word _fer_, a fair or jubilee. The morning is\r\nushered in by the music of drums and kettles, and other accompaniments\r\nof a song, a great part of which is inserted in Mr. Polwhele’s history,\r\nwhere this circumstance is noticed. So strict is the observance of this\r\nday as a general holiday, that should any person be found at work, he is\r\ninstantly seized, set astride on a pole, and hurried on men’s shoulders\r\nto the river, where he is sentenced to leap over a wide place, which he\r\nof course fails in attempting, and leaps into the water. A small\r\ncontribution towards the good cheer of the day easily compounds for the\r\nleap. About nine o’clock the revellers appear before the grammar-school,\r\nand demand a holiday for the schoolboys. After which they collect\r\ncontributions from house to house. They then _fade_ into the country,\r\n(fade being an old English word for _go_,) and, about the middle of the\r\nday, return with flowers and oak branches in their hats and caps. From\r\nthis time they dance hand in hand through the streets, to the sound of\r\nthe fiddle, playing a particular tune, running into every house they\r\npass without opposition. In the afternoon, a select party of the ladies\r\nand gentlemen make a progress through the street, and very late in the\r\nevening repair to the ball-room. A stranger visiting the town on the\r\neighth of May, would really think the people mad; so apparently wild and\r\nthoughtless is the merriment of the day.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt of “the Furry” originating from the “Floralia,”\r\nanciently observed by the Romans on the fourth of the calends of\r\nMay.[179]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Every pot has two handles.” This means “that one story’s good, till\r\nanother story’s told;” or, “there is no evil without its advantages.”\r\n\r\nIf it is generally “good” to anticipate festival days in the _Every-Day\r\nBook_, it is an “evil” to be “behind-hand;” and yet “advantages” have\r\nsometimes resulted from it. For instance, the day of “the _Furry_” at\r\nHelston, elapsed before this sheet was sent to press; but a\r\ncorrespondent who was present at the festival on that day in the present\r\nyear, 1826, sends an account of the manner wherein it is conducted at\r\npresent; and though the former “story’s good,” his particular\r\ndescription of the last _Furry_, is a lively picture of the pleasant\r\nmanner, wherein it continues to be celebrated: thus is illustrated the\r\nancient saying, that “every pot has two handles.”\r\n\r\nIt would be ill acknowledgment of the annexed letter to abridge it, by\r\nomitting its brief notice of the origin of the Furry, already adverted\r\nto, and therefore the whole is inserted verbatim.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELSTON “FURRY, OR FLORA DAY.”\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--Having for several years past resided in Cornwall, (from whence I\r\nhave lately returned,) I beg to inform you of _one_ of their gayest days\r\nof amusement, which is regularly kept up in the borough of Helston on\r\nthe eighth day of May.\r\n\r\nIt originated from the Roman custom of paying an early tribute of\r\nrespect to the _goddess_ Flora; the garlands of flowers worn on the\r\noccasion confirms this opinion. This festival commences at an early\r\nhour: the morning is enlivened by the sound of “drum and fife;” and\r\nmusic, harmony, and dance are the sports of “high and low”--“from morn\r\nto night.” Some of the oldest townsmen chant some _ancient ditties_--not\r\nvery comprehensible, “nor is the melody thereof enchanting.”\r\n\r\nThe hilarity of the day precludes the possibility of doing business;\r\nevery consideration but mirth, music, and feasting is set at naught.\r\nShould any persons be found at work, they are instantly seized, set\r\nastride on a pole, and jolted away on men’s shoulders, amidst thousands\r\nof huzzas, &c., and at last sentenced to leap _over_ the river, (which\r\nby the by is none of the narrowest,) the result which therefore\r\nfrequently happens is--they jump _into it_. The payment of a certain\r\nfine towards the expenses of the day saves them from this cooling.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the morning the mob gathers round the various seminaries, and\r\ncountless voices demand a holiday for all in them, which is acceded to:\r\na collection from the housekeepers is then commenced towards the general\r\nfund. While this is going on, the young folks of both sexes go to the\r\ngardens of the neighbourhood, and return at twelve with their heads\r\ndressed out with gay flowers, oak branches, &c. On entering the town\r\nthey are joined by a band of music; they dance through the streets to\r\nthe “Flora Tune.” In their progress they go through every house and\r\ngarden they please without distinction; all doors are opened, and, in\r\nfact, it is thought much of by the householders to be thus favoured.\r\n\r\nThe _older_ branch of the population dance in the same manner, for it is\r\nto be noticed they have select parties, and at different hours; no two\r\nsets dance together, or at the same time. Then follows the gentry, which\r\nis really a very pleasing sight on a fine day from the noted\r\nrespectability of this rich borough. In this set the sons and daughters\r\nof some of the first and noblest families of Cornwall join. The\r\nappearance of the ladies is enchanting. Added to their personal charms,\r\nin ball-room attire, each tastefully adorned with beautiful spring\r\nflowers, in herself appears to the gazer’s eye a _Flora_, and leads us\r\nto conceive the whole a scene from fairy land. The next set is, the\r\nsoldiers and their lasses; then come the tradesmen and their wives;\r\njourneymen and their sweethearts; and, “though last not least,” the male\r\nand female servants in splendid livery; best bibs and tuckers are in\r\nrequest, and many pretty brunettes are to be found in their Sunday\r\nfinery, with healthy smiling looks, which on such a day as this are sure\r\nto make sad havoc with the hearts of the young men.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a grand ball is always held at the assembly rooms; to\r\nwhich, this year, were added the performance of the “Honey Moon” at the\r\ntheatre, by Dawson’s company of comedians, Powell’s celebrated troop of\r\nhorse at the Circus, and Mr. Ingleby’s sleight of hand at the rooms. The\r\nborough was thronged with visiters from all parts of the country. It is\r\na pleasing task to conclude by being able to state, that Aurora rose on\r\nthe ninth without any account of accident or disappointment being\r\nexperienced by any of its numerous attendants. I have many other\r\nanecdotes of Cornwall, which I shall forward you in case you deem them\r\nworthy a place in your _Every-Day Book_, to which I wish the success it\r\nreally deserves.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your’s truly,\r\n\r\n  SAM SAM’S SON.\r\n\r\n_London, May 16, 1826._\r\n\r\n⁂ This communication was almost past the time; yet, as we set out with a\r\nproverb, we may end with “better late than never;” and, “not to ride a\r\nfree horse to death,” but merely to “drive the nail that will go,”\r\nthanks are offered to “Sam Sam’s Son,” with the hope of early receiving\r\nhis “future agreeable favours.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·07.\r\n\r\n  [179] Guide to Mount’s Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 9.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA MATCH.\r\n\r\nA New York paper of the ninth of May, 1817, announces that in\r\nMontgomery county, Mr. Jesse Johnson, being eighteen or nineteen years\r\nof age, and four feet one inch high, and weighing about seventy-five\r\npounds, was married to Miss Nancy Fowler, about twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, six feet two inches high, and weighing about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds. “Sure such _a pair_ were never seen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·20.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 10.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1736, Henry Justice, of the Middle Temple, Esq., was tried at\r\nthe Old Bailey, for stealing books out of Trinity-college library in\r\nCambridge. He attempted to defeat the prosecution by pleading, that in\r\nthe year 1734, he was admitted fellow-commoner of the said college,\r\nwhereby he became a member of that corporation, and had a property in\r\nthe books, and therefore could not be guilty of felony, and read several\r\nclauses of their charter and statutes to prove it.

As to himself, considering his circumstances, he had rather\r\ngo abroad, having lived in credit till this unhappy mistake, as he\r\ncalled it, and hoped the university would intercede for him. The\r\ndeputy-recorder commiserated his case, told him how greatly his crime\r\nwas aggravated by his education and profession, and then sentenced him\r\nto be transported to some of his majesty’s plantations in America for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 53·87.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 11.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON GYMNASTIC SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of this institution is of so great importance to the\r\nhealth and manners of the metropolis, that to pass it unregarded would\r\nbe inexcusable. Much of mental infirmity proceeds from bodily infirmity.\r\nWithout activity, the entire human being is diseased. A disposition to\r\ninactivity generates imbecility of character; diligence ceases,\r\nindolence prevails, unnatural feelings generate unnatural desires, and\r\nthe individual not only neglects positive duties, but becomes sensual\r\nand vicious. The “London Gymnastic Society,” therefore, in a national\r\npoint of view is of the highest regard. A letter, subjoined, will be\r\nfound to represent some of its exercises and advantages in an agreeable\r\nand interesting manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYMNASTIC EXERCISES.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--On the twenty-second of March, not less than fifteen hundred\r\npersons assembled at the Mechanics’ Institute for the purpose of forming\r\na “London Gymnastic Society.” This event is likely to have very\r\nimportant and useful results to the community, and, therefore, within\r\nthe plan of the _Every-Day Book_ to record. I have no intention to\r\ndescribe what passed on the occasion, any further than by stating that a\r\nseries of resolutions in support of the proposed object were unanimously\r\nadopted; and as great misconception prevails as to the nature of\r\ngymnastic exercises, some light on the subject, beyond that conveyed in\r\nyour first volume, may be interesting.\r\n\r\nThe grounds on which the use of exercise generally are recommended, are\r\nprecisely those from which the benefits of this particular class are to\r\nbe inferred; with this advantage in favour of gymnastics, that they\r\ncombine the advantages of almost every other species. If it be desirable\r\nthat the body should be strengthened, the limbs acquire flexibility, the\r\nmuscles be brought into full play, and the spirits be invigorated,\r\ngymnastics must be allowed to be salutary for such are their ordinary\r\neffects. Moreover, if it be desirable that a man should become\r\nacquainted with his physical capabilities, in order that he may be\r\nencouraged to exert them on suitable occasions, within the compass of\r\nsafety, and be aware when he is in danger of trespassing beyond the\r\nproper limit, gymnastics must be beneficial, for they instruct him where\r\nthat limit lies, and give him entire confidence within it. And so\r\ngradual are the steps by which the pupil is led on towards proficiency,\r\nnow mastering a small difficulty, then advancing to one a little\r\ngreater, then to another, and another, that at last he accomplishes the\r\nevolution which at one time appeared to him of greatest difficulty with\r\nmore facility than he at first accomplished the first lesson; while all\r\nthe time he has been acquiring in the process increased capability,\r\nstrength, confidence, and presence of mind. For the utility of these\r\nexercises does not end in the gymnasium; it only begins there. The\r\nperformances of the evolutions are _means_ by which great ends are\r\nattained; the vigour acquired in performing them, being afterwards\r\nuseful wherever vigour may be required.\r\n\r\nIn the _preliminary exercises_, the pupil is taught to accustom himself\r\nto extend his arms and legs in various natural positions, in quick\r\nsuccession; sometimes exerting the arms only, the legs resting passive,\r\nsometimes the reverse; and sometimes exerting both legs and arms\r\ntogether. These exercises are not so strictly preliminary as to require\r\nthe pupil to become perfect in them before he engages in others. On the\r\ncontrary, he may with advantage, at a very early stage, combine them\r\nwith those of greater difficulty; and also at an advanced stage, find it\r\nuseful occasionally to recur to them. But let us proceed to the bars.\r\n\r\nThe _bars_ consist of two pieces of wood placed parallel, in a\r\nhorizontal position, on supporters, extending breast-high from the\r\nground. The pupil having raised himself erect between the bars (they are\r\nsomething less than two feet apart, and about five feet in length)\r\npasses from one end to the other by the help of his hands only, moving\r\none hand forward at a time, as the feet are moved in walking. He next\r\nplaces himself in the centre between the bars, and keeping his legs\r\nstraight and close together projects them over the right hand bar, and\r\nso arrives on the ground. He then does the same on the left side, then\r\non the right side backwards, either with or without previously swinging,\r\nthen on the left side backwards in the same way. He next resumes his\r\nposition at the end of the bars; but instead of walking or treading\r\nalong the bars with his hands, as in the first exercise, he this time\r\nlifts both hands together, and passes to the other end by short jumps.\r\nHe then returns to the centre of the bars, and retaining hold of them,\r\nprojects his body over the left hand bar, from which position, by\r\nslightly springing, he projects himself over that on his right. This\r\nevolution he performs also on both sides, and later in his progress\r\nbackwards also. Then there is the half moon, or semi-circle, which is\r\nperformed by projecting the legs over one of the bars in front, and then\r\nbringing them back, and swinging them over the same bar behind. As the\r\npupil advances, he is enabled to project himself over the bars\r\nunassisted by the lower part of his arms; also to rest the lower part of\r\nhis arms on the bars, and from that position to raise himself erect by\r\nthe hands only, repeating the evolution several times in succession, to\r\npass from one side of the bar to the other, without touching the ground,\r\nand many other evolutions all conducing in one way or another to the\r\nstrength and elasticity of his frame.\r\n\r\nThe _horizontal_ poles are placed at various heights from the ground,\r\naccording to the height of the pupil, and the exercises to be performed\r\non them. Those chiefly used are a few inches above the head. One of the\r\nfirst lessons on the pole is analogous to the first on the parallel\r\nbars, the pupil passing from one end of the pole to the other, by the\r\nhelp of his hands only, first by moving one hand at a time as in\r\nwalking, afterwards by moving both hands together. Grasping the pole\r\nwith both hands, the pupil is taught to raise himself in various ways\r\nabove it--to pass over it--to pass from one side of the pole to the\r\nother, &c. &c. The exercises on the pole are equal in diversity to those\r\non the bars, perhaps on the whole more arduous, and certainly equally\r\nbeneficial. I believe the arms and back are particularly strengthened by\r\nthis diversion of the exercises.\r\n\r\nLeaving the pole, let us attend a moment to the _masts_, the _ropes_,\r\nand the _ladders_. These are of various heights and dimensions. The\r\npupil first learns to climb the rope and mast by the assistance of his\r\nhands and feet, afterwards by his hands only, and by degrees he learns\r\nto ascend the latter without the assistance of his feet or legs. The\r\nleaping with and without a pole, jumping, running, throwing the\r\njavelin, the use of the broad sword, &c., do not require description as\r\nthey are more or less familiar to every one. I therefore confine myself\r\nto naming them, and observing that familiar as some of them are, the\r\nregulations under which they are practised tend greatly to increase\r\ntheir utility.[180]\r\n\r\nThere is still a division of these exercises which I have not mentioned,\r\nand which deserves a full description, and that is, the exercises on the\r\nhorse--a wooden horse--without head or tail--but, as I feel myself quite\r\nunable to bear anything like adequate testimony to the merits of this\r\nvery useful and quiet quadruped, I must reluctantly leave his eulogium\r\nto others more competent. It is a subject I cannot well get upon, being\r\nbut a very indifferent equestrian.\r\n\r\n  I remain, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  A PARALLEL BARRISTER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo all individuals of sedentary occupations, in great towns and cities,\r\ngymnastic exercises are of immense benefit. It is difficult to convince,\r\nbut it is a duty to attempt persuading them, that their usual habits\r\nwaste the spirits, destroy health, and shorten life. Hundreds of\r\nLondoners die every year for want of exercise.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that we should cultivate gymnastics “after the\r\nmanner of the ancients,” but only so much as may be requisite to\r\nmaintain the even tenour of existence. The state of society in towns,\r\ncontinually imposes obstructions to health, and offers inducements to\r\nthe slothful, in the shape of palliatives, which ultimately increase\r\n“the miseries of human life.” Exercise is both a prevention and a\r\nremedy; but, we must not mistake--diligence is not, therefore, exercise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur present pastimes are almost all within doors; the old ones were in\r\nthe open air.

Oxford Term ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MAY DAY.\r\n\r\n_Scottish Beltein._\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--I confess I was not a little astonished a few days ago, on\r\nbecoming acquainted with a custom evidently heathenish in its origin,\r\nwhich exists in the united kingdom, where, it must be admitted, great\r\nadvances have been made in morals and religion, as well as in science\r\nand general knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe fact I allude to is in Dr. Jamieson’s “Dictionary of the Scottish\r\nLanguage.” He mentions a festival called _Beltane_, or _Beltein_,\r\nannually held in Scotland on old May-day. A town in Perthshire is called\r\n“Tillee Beltein;” i. e. the eminence (or high place) of the fire of\r\nBaal. Near this are two druidical temples of upright stones with a well,\r\nadjacent to one of them, still held in great veneration for its\r\nsanctity, and on that account visited by vast numbers of superstitious\r\npeople. In the parish of Callander (same county) upon “Beltein day,”\r\nthey cut a circular trench in the ground, sufficient to enclose the\r\nwhole company assembled. “They kindle a fire and dress a repast of eggs\r\nand milk in the consistence of a custard; they knead a cake of oatmeal,\r\nwhich is toasted at the embers against a stone.” After the custard is\r\neaten, they divide the cake into as many equal parts as there are\r\npersons present, and one part is made _perfectly black_ with charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe bits of cake are put into a bonnet and are drawn blindfold, and he\r\nwho draws the black bit is considered as “_devoted to be sacrificed to\r\nBaal_, and is obliged to _leap three times through the flame_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pennant in his “Tour in Scotland, 1769,” gives a similar account\r\nwith varying ceremonies.\r\n\r\n“In Ireland,” says Mr. Macpherson, “_Beltein_ is celebrated on the\r\ntwenty-first of June at the time of the solstice. There they make fires\r\non the tops of the hills, and every member of the family is made to\r\n_pass through the fire_, as they reckon this ceremony to ensure good\r\nfortune during the succeeding year. This resembles the rite used by the\r\nRomans in Palilia.”--“_Beltein_ (adds Mr. M.) is also observed in\r\nLancashire.”\r\n\r\nThis “custom” being entirely new to me, and appearing so much to\r\nillustrate many passages in the Bible which refer to the idolatry of the\r\nancients, I forward it to you agreeably to your printed invitation.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. K. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAND MAYPOLE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--In your account of the Maypole which stood in the Strand, you have\r\nstated that the said Maypole upon its decay was obtained of the parish\r\nby sir I. Newton, and placed at Wanstead for support of his telescope;\r\nbut in the preface to the ninth edition of Derham’s “Astro-Theology,”\r\npublished 1750, he says, “And now for a close I shall take this\r\nopportunity of publicly owning, with all honour and thankfulness, the\r\ngenerous offer made me by some of my friends, eminent in their stations,\r\nas well as skill and abilities in the laws, who would have made me a\r\npresent of the Maypole in the Strand, (which was to be taken down,) or\r\nany other pole I thought convenient for the management of Mr. Huygens’s\r\nglass; but as my incapacity of accepting the favour of those noble\r\nMecænates hath been the occasion of that glass being put into better\r\nhands, so I assure myself their expectations are abundantly answered by\r\nthe number and goodness of the observations that have been and will be\r\nmade therewith.”\r\n\r\nAs you will perceive by the expression “which was to be taken down,” it\r\nmust have been standing at the time of publication of his book, and as\r\nsir I. Newton died in 1726, the “compilation” from which you extracted\r\nyour account must be erroneous. The name of the philosopher to whom the\r\nglass belonged, you will also perceive to be misspelled. I should not\r\nhave troubled you with these trifling corrections, but as I am sure your\r\nadmirable work will pass through many editions, you may not in the\r\nfuture ones refuse to make the alteration.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  _May 17, 1826._\r\n\r\n  J. S.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am obliged to J. S. for his endeavour to rectify what he deems an\r\nerror; but it rather corroborates than invalidates the fact stated in\r\nvol. i. p. 560, on the authority of the work there referred to.\r\n\r\nJ. S. quotes “the _ninth_ edition of Derham’s ‘Astro-Theology,’\r\npublished 1750,” and infers that the Strand Maypole “must have been\r\nstanding at the time of publishing his book;” and so it was; but it was\r\nno more in being when the “ninth edition” of his book was published,\r\nthan Derham himself was, who died in 1735. The first edition of “his\r\nbook” was published in 1714, and Derham _then_ wrote of it as _then_\r\nstanding, and the citation of J. S. shows that it was _then_\r\ncontemplated to present Derham with the Maypole for Huygens’s glass,\r\nwhich from “incapacity” he could not accept, and was therefore the\r\noccasion of the glass “being put into better hands.” These “better\r\nhands” were sir Isaac Newton’s; the object of the intended present of\r\nthe Maypole to Derham was for Huygens’s glass; and it is reasonable to\r\nbelieve that as sir Isaac had the glass, so also he had the Maypole to\r\nappropriate to the purpose of the glass.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though I think J. S. has failed in proving my authority to\r\nbe erroneous, and that he himself is mistaken, I repeat that I am\r\nobliged by his intention; and I add, that I shall feel obliged to any\r\none who will take the trouble of pointing out any error. I aim to be\r\naccurate, and can truly say that it costs me more time to establish the\r\nfacts I adduce, than to write and arrange the materials after I have\r\nconvinced myself of their authority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MONTH.\r\n\r\n_May Morning._\r\n\r\n      But who the melodies of morn can tell?\r\n      The wild brook babbling down the mountain side;\r\n      The lowing herd; the sheepfold’s simple bell;\r\n      The pipe of early shepherd dim descried\r\n      In the lone valley; echoing far and wide\r\n      The clamorous horn along the cliffs above;\r\n      The hollow murmur of the ocean tide;\r\n    And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.\r\n\r\n      The cottage curs at early pilgrim bark;\r\n      Crown’d with her pail the tripping milk-maid sings;\r\n      The whistling ploughman stalks afield; and, hark!\r\n      Down the rough slope the ponderous waggon rings;\r\n      Through rustling corn the hare astonished springs;\r\n      Slow tolls the village clock the drowsy hour;\r\n      The partridge bursts away on whirring wings;\r\n      Deep mourns the turtle in sequestered bower;\r\n    The shrill lark carols clear from her aërial tow’r.\r\n\r\n  _Beattie._\r\n\r\n_May Evening._\r\n\r\n    Sweet was the sound when oft at evening’s close,\r\n    By yonder hill the village murmur rose;\r\n    There, as I passed with careless steps and slow,\r\n    The mingling notes came softened from below;\r\n    The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,\r\n    The sober herd that lowed to meet their young,\r\n    The noisy geese that gabbled o’er the pool,\r\n    The playful children just let loose from school,\r\n    The watch-dog’s voice that bayed the whispering wind,\r\n    And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind,\r\n    These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,\r\n    And filled each pause the nightingale had made.\r\n\r\n  _Goldsmith._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·12.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 14.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1826.

ANTHONY’S CHURCH, CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nIn an old tract printed against church ceremonies during “the troubles\r\nof England,” there is an account of “fearfull judgements that God hath\r\nshewed upon churches,” one whereof is alleged by the puritan author to\r\nhave been manifested on this day. His account is curious, and the fact\r\nbeing historical, is here related in his own words, viz.\r\n\r\n  On _VVhitsunday_ last, 1640, in the parish of _Anthony_ in _Cornwall_,\r\n  when people were kneeling at the _Communion_, great claps of thunder\r\n  were heard, as though divers Cannons had been shot off at once, and\r\n  extraordinary, and most fearfull flashes of Lightnings, and a terrible\r\n  and unspeakable strange sound, to the great amazement of the people;\r\n  and when the _Minister_ was turning towards the _Communion Table_, to\r\n  give the _Cup_, after he had given the _Bread_, he saw (to his\r\n  thinking) a flaming fire about his body, and withall, heard a terrible\r\n  and unspeakable sound, and had no hurt, save that the outside of one\r\n  of his legs was scalded: presently after, divers balls of fire came\r\n  into the _Church_ and struck one _Ferdinando Reepe_ on the sole of his\r\n  left foot, with such a violence, as he thought his foot had been split\r\n  in pieces, and was for a while deprived of his senses: One _John\r\n  Hodge_ was stricken in the knees and thighs, and lower parts of his\r\n  body, so as he thought every part of his body to be unjoynted: One\r\n  _Dorothy Tubbe_ was stricken so, as she thought her legs and knees\r\n  were struck off from her body: One _Anthony Peeke_ was fearfully\r\n  struck in all the lower parts of his body, and thought that he had\r\n  been shot thorow, and was lift up from kneeling, and set upon the form\r\n  by which hee kneeled: One _Susan Collins_ was struck in the lower\r\n  parts of her body, so as it seemed to her, to be struck off from the\r\n  upper part, and was scalded on the wrist of the right hand: A great\r\n  fire, far redder then any lightning, came into the _Church_, and\r\n  struck one _Nicholas Shelton_ on both sides of his head, as though he\r\n  had been struck with two flat stones, and did shake his body, as\r\n  though it would shake it in pieces, whereby he lost his sight and his\r\n  senses: One _Roger Nile_ was struck on the backbone, on the right\r\n  side, and on the anckle on the inside of his left leg, so as for a\r\n  while, he was not able to stand; after the fire, there was heard in\r\n  the _Church_, as it were, the hissing of a great shot; and after that\r\n  a noise, as though divers Cannons had been shot off at once, to make\r\n  one single and terrible report; the noise did not descend from above,\r\n  but was heard, and seemed to begin close at the Northside of the\r\n  _Communion Table_: After this fire and noise, then followed a\r\n  loathsome smell of _Gunpowder_ and _Brimstone_, and a great smoak. The\r\n  _Church_ had no harm, save that seven or eight holes and rents were\r\n  made in the wall of the Steeple, some on the inside, and some on the\r\n  outside; impressions on the stones in divers places, as if they were\r\n  made by force of shot, discharged out of a great Ordnance, so as in\r\n  divers places, light might be seen through the walls. In this storm\r\n  was no body kill’d, save one Dog in the Belfree, and another at the\r\n  feet of one kneeling to receive the _Cup_; As soon as this fearfull\r\n  storm was over, they that were weak, not able to stand, were (through\r\n  the mercy of God) restored to their strength; and they that were\r\n  frantick, to their senses; and he that was blind, was restored to his\r\n  sight; and came all to the _Lords Table_, and received the _VVine_,\r\n  and went all in the afternoon to give God thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 53·47.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1826.

The young man then took his place in the ring, and\r\nthe young woman proceeded round it as he had done before, until she\r\ndropped the handkerchief behind one of the young men. As soon as this\r\nwas done she would bound away with the swiftness of a roe, followed by\r\nthe young man, and if, as was sometimes the case, she proved to be the\r\nlightest of foot, considerable merriment was afforded to the bystanders\r\nin witnessing the chase through its different windings, dodgings, and\r\ncircumlocutions, which ended in the lady’s capture, with a kiss for the\r\ngentleman’s trouble.\r\n\r\nI believe many matches in the humble walks of life may date their origin\r\nfrom this custom; and however the opulent and refined may be disposed to\r\nobject to a promiscuous assemblage of the sexes, I am doubtful whether\r\nthey can point out any plan which shall rival in innocence and gaiety\r\nthose of our forefathers, many of which are gone, and as\r\n_pseudo_-delicacy and refinement are now the order of the day, I fear\r\nthat they never can return again.\r\n\r\n  _Cannon-street._\r\n\r\n  R.

These representations are about two feet square, and are fixed at\r\nthe top of a pole about two yards high, decorated with flowers, &c. The\r\nprocession walks from the guildhall to a high hill in the vicinity of\r\nthe city, called Greenhill, (but which is now nearly surrounded by\r\nhouses,) where a temporary booth has been erected, with a small space of\r\nground enclosed at the front with boards. This booth is also decorated\r\nwith flowers, and hence the fair has derived the appellation of “The\r\nGreenhill Bower.” On arriving at this booth, the gates of the enclosed\r\npark are opened and the procession enters. The different little machines\r\nare placed around the enclosure, and then put in motion by the separate\r\n“operatives,” in the presence of the higher portion of the corporation,\r\nwho award which of the machines presents the greatest ingenuity, and\r\nprizes are distributed accordingly. This takes place about the middle of\r\nthe day. The machines remain, and are put in motion and exhibited by\r\ntheir owners until the evening. The booth itself is filled with\r\nrefreshments; and men being stationed at the gates to prevent the\r\nentrance of the disorderlies, every well-dressed person is admitted at\r\nonce, and some cakes, &c. are given gratuitously away; the corporation I\r\nbelieve being at this expense. The various shows are ranged in different\r\nparts of the hill, and as none make their appearance there but such as\r\nhave already graced “Bartholomew,” it will be endless for me to say\r\nanother word on this part of the subject, as by reference to your\r\nnotices of September 3, 1825, will more fully and at large appear, and\r\nwhere your reader will find, although enough, yet “not to spare.” I am,\r\n&c.

DEWHURST.\r\n\r\n  _63, Upper Thornhaugh-street,_\r\n\r\n  _Bedford-square._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cumberland Hirings._\r\n\r\nThe “hirings” for farmers’ servants half yearly at Whitsuntide and\r\nMartinmass, though not altogether peculiar to the county of Cumberland,\r\nare however, I conceive, entitled to notice. Those who come to be hired\r\nstand in a body in the market-place, and to distinguish themselves hold\r\na bit of straw or green sprig in their mouths. When the market is over\r\nthe girls begin to file off and gently pace the streets, with a view of\r\ngaining admirers, whilst the young men with similar designs follow them;\r\nand having “eyed the lasses,” each picks up a sweetheart, conducts her\r\nto a dancing-room, and treats her with punch, wine, and cake. Here they\r\nspend their afternoon, and part of their half-year’s wages, in drinking\r\nand dancing, unless, as it frequently happens, a girl becomes the\r\nsubject of contention, when the harmony of the meeting is interrupted,\r\nand the candidates for her love settle the dispute by blows. When the\r\ndiversions of the day are concluded, the servants generally return to\r\ntheir homes for a few holidays before they enter on their new servitude.\r\nAt fairs, as well as hirings, it is customary for all the young people\r\nin the neighbourhood to assemble and dance at the inns and alehouses. In\r\ntheir dances, which are jigs and reels, exertion and agility are more\r\nregarded than ease and grace. But little order is observed in these\r\nrustic assemblies: disputes frequently arise, and are generally\r\nterminated by blows. During these combats the weaker portion of the\r\ncompany, with the minstrels, get on the benches, or cluster in corners,\r\nwhilst the rest support the combatants; even the lasses will often\r\nassist in the battle in support of their relations or lovers, and in the\r\nlast cases they are desperate. When the affray is over the bruised\r\npugilists retire to wash, and the tattered nymphs to re-adjust their\r\ngarments. Fresh company arrives, the fiddles strike up, the dancing\r\nproceeds as before, and the skirmish which had commenced without\r\nmalice, is rarely remembered. In their dancing parties the attachments\r\nof the country people are generally formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nENSHAM, OXON.\r\n\r\n_Old Custom._\r\n\r\nTill within the last century, an old custom prevailed in the parish of\r\nEnsham, Oxfordshire, by which the townspeople were allowed on Whit\r\nMonday to cut down and carry away as much timber as could be drawn by\r\nmen’s hands into the abbey-yard, the churchwardens previously marking\r\nout such timber by giving the first chop; so much as they could carry\r\nout again, notwithstanding the opposition of the servants of the abbey\r\nto prevent it, they were to keep for the reparation of the church. By\r\nthis service they held their right of commonage at Lammas and\r\nMichaelmas; but about the beginning of the last century, this practice\r\nwas laid aside by mutual consent.[181]\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDLINGTON, OXON.\r\n\r\nThere is a custom at Kidlington, in Oxfordshire, on Monday after Whitson\r\nWeek, to provide a fat live lamb; and the maids of the town, having\r\ntheir thumbs tied behind them, run after it, and she that with her mouth\r\ntakes and holds the lamb, is declared _Lady of the Lamb_; which being\r\ndressed, with the skin hanging on, is carried on a long pole before the\r\nlady and her companions to the green, attended with music, and a morisco\r\ndance of men, and another of women, where the rest of the day is spent\r\nin dancing, mirth, and merry glee. The next day the lamb is part baked,\r\nboiled, and roast, for the lady’s feast, where she sits majestically at\r\nthe upper end of the table, and her companions with her, with music and\r\nother attendants, which ends the solemnity.[182]\r\n\r\n\r\nNECTON, NORFOLK.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nVarious purse clubs, or benefit societies, annual feasts, and other\r\nmerry-makings, having from time immemorial produced a Whitsuntide\r\nholiday amongst the inhabitants of numerous villages in Norfolk, in\r\n1817, colonel, at that time major, Mason, in order to concentrate these\r\nfestivities, and render _Necton_, (his place of family residence,) the\r\nfocus of popular attraction to the neighbouring villagers, established a\r\n_guild_ or festival for rural sports, on Whit Monday and Tuesday.\r\nHaving, during the late war, while with his regiment (the East Norfolk\r\nMilitia) had an opportunity of observing the various celebrations of\r\nWhitsuntide, in different parts of the kingdom, he was thus enabled to\r\nconstitute _Necton guild_, a superior holiday festival. Arranged under\r\nhis immediate patronage, and conducted by his principal tenantry, it\r\nsoon became, and still continues, the most respectable resort of\r\nWhitsuntide festivities in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the festival, the following printed notice is usually\r\ncirculated\r\n\r\n“WHITSUN HOLIDAYS\r\n\r\n“On the afternoons of Whit Monday and Whit Tuesday next, a guild for\r\nrural games, Maypole dances, &c. will be held in the grounds of William\r\nMason, Esq., Necton.\r\n\r\n“The guild being entirely distinct from a fair, no stalls, stands, or\r\nbooths, or other conveniences for the sale of goods, will be suffered to\r\nbe brought upon the grounds, but by those who have special leave for\r\nthat purpose, in writing, given on application to John Carr, master\r\nbeadle.\r\n\r\n“The guild will open each day at two P. M., and canteens, (where\r\nrefreshments of all sorts may be had, and cold dinners supplied,) will\r\nclose each night by sound of bell at eleven.\r\n\r\n“N. B.--As this guild is regularly policed, it is hoped that the\r\nhilarity of the festival will continue to be preserved as heretofore, by\r\nthe order and obliging conduct of all those who come to mix in the\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n  “Signed by *  *  * Mayor.\r\n\r\n  “*  *  *  *  Past Mayor.\r\n\r\n  “GOD SAVE THE KING.”\r\n\r\nThe field selected for the purpose is beautifully and picturesquely\r\nsituated, opposite the park of Necton-hall. Near the centre is a raised\r\nmound of earth fenced round to protect it from the pressure of the\r\ncrowd, on which is erected a “Maypole,” crowned with a streamer or\r\npennant, and encircled by numerous garlands of flowers and evergreens,\r\nsuspended longitudinally from the top to the bottom of the pole:--this\r\nis called the Maypole-stand. At a convenient distance are placed the\r\nstalls, canteens, and booths; the principal of which, tastefully\r\ndecorated with evergreens, is called “the mayor’s booth,” and is solely\r\nappropriated to his friends and the select party of the company; care\r\nbeing taken to prevent improper intrusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Necton Guild.~]\r\n\r\nFrom the “mayor’s booth,” early on Whit Monday afternoon, the ceremony\r\nof commencing or proclaiming the guild emanates in the following order\r\nof procession:--\r\n\r\n  Constable of Necton in a red scarf, with his staff of office.\r\n  Beadles or special constables with staves, two and two.\r\n  Master beadle of the guild, with a halberd.\r\n  Six boys and girls, Maypole dancers, two and two, hand in hand.\r\n  Band of Music.\r\n  Maskers, or morris-dancers, fancifully attired, two and two.\r\n  Pursuivant with a truncheon, habited in a tabard, on which is\r\n  depictured an allegorical representation of the arms of Necton.\r\n  Sword-bearer in grotesque dress, on horseback.\r\n  Standard bearer on horseback.\r\n  THE MAYOR OF THE GUILD,\r\n  On horseback, in full dress suit and purple robes with his chain of\r\n  office.\r\n  Standard bearer on horseback.\r\n  The mayor elect on horseback.\r\n  Standard bearer on horseback.\r\n  Principal tenantry on horseback, two and two.\r\n  Beadles of the guild.\r\n  Maskers or morris-dancers, fancifully attired, two and two.\r\n  Six boys and girls, Maypole dancers, two and two, hand in hand.\r\n  Beadles of the guild.\r\n  Band of music.\r\n  Man bearing a standard.\r\n  Members of Royal Oak Friendly Society, with purple and light blue\r\n  favours in their hats, two and two.\r\n  Members of the Necton Old Club Friendly Society with light blue\r\n  favours in their hats, two and two.\r\n\r\nTaking a circuitous route through the field into the park, upon arriving\r\nat the principal entrance to the hall, where the colonel and his friends\r\nare waiting the approach of the procession, the mayor alights, and thus\r\naddresses the patron:--\r\n\r\n    “Honourable sir,--\r\n                   “The period now arriv’d,\r\n    In which the tokens of my mayoralty\r\n    Must be resign’d,--I make it my request,\r\n    You should appoint as mayor elect, this year,\r\n    Our worthy friend and colleague, Mr. * * * *\r\n    But in resigning, beg best thanks to give\r\n    For the diversion of our last year’s guild;--\r\n    Hoping the festival will as much this year,\r\n    By weather and kind friends be happy blest.”\r\n\r\nTo this the colonel replies, “by thanking the mayor for his past\r\nservices,--for the good order and regularity observed during the last\r\nfestival,--and the pleasure it will afford him to make the new\r\nappointment.”--They then enter the vestibule, where the mayor resigning\r\nhis robes and tokens of office, the mayor elect is then invested with\r\nthem. After returning to the door, the colonel congratulates the new\r\nmayor on entering his office, &c. to which his worship thus replies:--\r\n\r\n    “Honourable sir,--\r\n                      “With pleasure I receive\r\n    Th’ official tokens of my mayoralty,\r\n    Which now in place of our late worthy mayor,\r\n    Alderman * * * * I do most willingly take:\r\n    Be well assured, as much as in me lies,\r\n    I will good rule and order strict maintain,\r\n    That peace and pleasure may together tend\r\n    To make our guild, two days of even mirth\r\n    Hoping all here assembled at the hall,\r\n    Anon will join us in the festive scene,\r\n    And bidding all most welcome to our guild:\r\n    I thus respectful beg to take my leave,\r\n    That I may tend my duties in the field.”--\r\n\r\nThe procession then returns by the same route and in the same order,\r\nwith the exception of the _new_ and the _past_ mayors who have changed\r\nplaces. The rustic sports then commence;--the master beadle, ringing a\r\nbell, proclaims the sport and the prize, the competitors for which are\r\ndesired to “come upon the Maypole-stand.”--The sports usually selected,\r\nare\r\n\r\n  Wrestling-matches.\r\n  Foot-races.\r\n  Jingling-matches.\r\n  Jumping in sacks.\r\n  Wheel-barrow races, blindfold.\r\n  Spinning matches.\r\n  Whistling matches.\r\n  Grinning ditto, through a horse-collar.\r\n  Jumping matches.\r\n  &c. &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThese are occasionally enlivened with Maypole dances, by the boys and\r\ngirls of the village, selected and dressed for the occasion, and also by\r\nthe maskers or morris-dancers. When the shades of evening prevent the\r\ncontinuance of these sports, the spacious “mayor’s booth” is then the\r\nobject of attraction. Well lighted, and the floor boarded for the\r\noccasion, country dances commence, which are generally kept up with\r\ngreat spirit and harmony, till the master beadle with his bell announces\r\nthe time arrived for closing the booths and canteens, “by order of the\r\nmayor.” A few minutes, and sometimes (by permission) a little longer,\r\nterminates the amusement, which is always concluded, on both evenings,\r\nby the whole company joining in the national anthem of “God save the\r\nking.”\r\n\r\nThat “Necton guild” is considered as a superior establishment to a\r\nrustic fair, or other merry-making, by the numerous, respectable, and\r\nfashionable companies who generally attend from all parts of the\r\nneighbourhood. Undisturbed by those scenes of intoxication and disorder,\r\nusually prevalent at village fairs, the greatest harmony prevails\r\nthroughout, and the superior attention and accommodation afforded by the\r\npatron and directors of the festival, to all classes of well-behaved and\r\nrespectable visiters, cannot fail to render “Necton guild,” a popular\r\nand attractive resort of Whitsuntide festivities.\r\n\r\nI have attempted a sketch of the Maypole stand, &c. from my own\r\nknowledge, for I have usually rambled to Necton one or two evenings of\r\neach year, since the “guild” was established, and hence I have given you\r\nthe particulars from actual observation, though I am indebted to a\r\nfriend, who is a diligent and accurate recorder of customs for the\r\nspeeches, &c. I must further observe, that the mound of earth I have\r\nendeavoured to represent is permanent in the field, and about three\r\nfeet high, though I have erroneously represented it as higher from lack\r\nof eye in drawing, to which indeed I make no pretension. The dancers are\r\nthe morris-dancers in grotesque dresses; the men with fanciful figured\r\nprint waistcoat and small clothes, decked with bows; and the women in\r\ncoloured skirts, trimmed like stage dresses for Spanish girls, with\r\nFrench toques instead of caps.\r\n\r\nI find you have removed the publishing office since I wrote last, but I\r\nhope you do not mean to withdraw yourself from the work. Should you\r\ncontinue “the soul” of the _Every-Day Book_ “body,” you shall hear from\r\nme again, whenever and as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n  K.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ⁂ _To obviate the possibility of misapprehension in consequence of\r\n  the_ EVERY-DAY BOOK _being published by Messrs._ HUNT _and_ CLARKE, _I\r\n  take this opportunity of observing, that those gentlemen have no other\r\n  concern in the work than that of being its publishers, and that it has\r\n  never ceased from my entire management from the time they undertook\r\n  that service for me on my own solicitation.

HONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITSUN ALES.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to read the notices of these ancient revels in our\r\ntopographical histories. One of them gives the following account of a\r\nCornish merriment.\r\n\r\n“For the _church-ale_, two young men of the parish are yerely chosen by\r\ntheir last foregoers to be wardens, who, dividing the task, make\r\ncollection among the parishioners, of whatsoever provision it pleaseth\r\nthem voluntarily to bestow. This they employ in brewing, baking, and\r\nother acates, against Whitsuntide, upon which holidays the neighbours\r\nmeet at the church house, and there merily feed on their owne victuals,\r\neach contributing some petty portion to the stock, which, by many\r\nsmalls, groweth to a meetly greatness; for there is entertayned a kind\r\nof emulation between these wardens, who, by his graciousness in\r\ngathering, and good husbandry in expending, can best advance the\r\nchurche’s profit. Besides, the neighbour parishes at those times\r\nlovingly visit one another, and frankly spend their money together. The\r\nafternoons are consumed in such exercises as olde and yonge folk (having\r\nleysure) doe accustomably weare out the time withall. When the feast is\r\nended, the wardens yeeld in their accounts to the parishioners; and such\r\nmoney as exceedeth the disbursement is layd up in store, to defray any\r\nextraordinary charges arising in the parish, or imposed on them for the\r\ngood of the countrey or the prince’s service; neither of which commonly\r\ngripe so much, but that somewhat stil remayneth to cover the purse’s\r\nbottom.”[183]\r\n\r\nAnother says, “There were no rates for the poor in my grandfather’s\r\ndays; but for Kingston St. Michael (no small parish) the church-ale of\r\nWhitsuntide did the business. In every parish is (or was) a church-house\r\nto which belonged spits, crocks, &c. utensils for dressing provision.\r\nHere the housekeepers met, and were merry, and gave their charity. The\r\nyoung people were there too, and had dancing, bowling, shooting at\r\nbutts, &c. the ancients sitting gravely by, and looking on. All things\r\nwere civil, and without scandal.”[184]\r\n\r\nMr. Douce tells us, that “At present the Whitsun ales are conducted in\r\nthe following manner. Two persons are chosen, previously to the meeting,\r\nto be lord and lady of the ale, who dress as suitably as they can, to\r\nthe characters they assume. A large empty barn, or some such building,\r\nis provided for the lord’s hall, and fitted up with seats to accommodate\r\nthe company. Here they assemble to dance and regale in the best manner\r\ntheir circumstances and the place will afford; and each young fellow\r\ntreats his girl with a riband or favour. The lord and lady honour the\r\nhall with their presence, attended by the steward, sword-bearer,\r\npurse-bearer, and mace-bearer with their several badges or ensigns of\r\noffice. They have likewise a train-bearer or page, and a fool or jester,\r\ndrest in a party-coloured jacket, whose ribaldry and gesticulation,\r\ncontribute not a little to the entertainment of some part of the\r\ncompany. The lord’s music, consisting of a pipe and tabor, is employed\r\nto conduct the dance. Some people think this custom is a commemoration\r\nof the ancient Drink-lean, a day of festivity, formerly observed by the\r\ntenants, and vassals of the lord of the fee, within his manor; the\r\nmemory of which, on account of the jollity of those meetings, the people\r\nhave thus preserved ever since. The glossaries inform us, that this\r\nDrink-lean was a contribution of tenants, towards a potation or ale,\r\nprovided to entertain the lord or his steward.”[185]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    At Islington\r\n      A fair they hold,\r\n    Where cakes and ale\r\n      Are to be sold.\r\n    At Highgate, and\r\n      At Holloway\r\n    The like is kept\r\n      Here every day.\r\n    At Totnam Court\r\n      And Kentish Town,\r\n    And all those places\r\n      Up and down.\r\n\r\n  _Poor Robin_, 1676.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPARD REVEL.\r\n\r\nThe “Reading Mercury” of May 24, 1819, contains the following\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n“_Peppard Revel_ will be held on Whit Monday, May 31, 1819; and for the\r\nencouragement of young and old gamesters, there will be a good hat to be\r\nplayed for at cudgels; for the first seven couple that play, the man\r\nthat breaks most heads to have the prize; and one shilling and sixpence\r\nwill be given to each man that breaks a head, and one shilling to the\r\nman that has his head broke.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·35.\r\n\r\n  [181] Topographical, &c.

As a further mark of his quality, he mounted a cockade in\r\nhis hat, and several brass curtain rings on his fingers. Thus decorated,\r\nand with a staff in his hand to support his feeble frame, he constantly\r\ntottered through Durham; every street of which ancient city acknowledged\r\nhis distinction.\r\n\r\nAt this time it is difficult to conjecture the origin of Thomas French’s\r\ntitle. He assumed it with the decline of his understanding, until which\r\nperiod he had been a labouring man, and supported himself by the work of\r\nhis hands. In right of his dukedom, he publicly urged his claims to\r\nimmense possessions. It was his constant usage to stop and accost every\r\none he knew, or could introduce himself to, on points of business,\r\nconnected with the Baubleshire estates. Though at no time master of a\r\nshilling, he incessantly complained of having been defrauded of vast\r\namounts, in cash and bank bills; and parties whom he suspected of these\r\ntransactions, he threatened to punish with the utmost rigour of the law.\r\nHe seldom saw a goodly horse, or a handsome carriage, without claiming\r\nit, and insisted on his rights so peremptorily and pertinaciously, as to\r\nbe exceedingly vexatious to the possessors of the property. He\r\nfearlessly exhibited charges of misappropriation against individuals of\r\nall ranks and conditions. According to his grace’s representations,\r\nevery covetable personalty in Durham and its vicinage, had been\r\nclandestinely obtained from Baubleshire; nor did he make any secret of\r\nhis intimate and frequent correspondence with the king, on the subject\r\nof raising men for carrying on the war, and other important affairs of\r\nstate. He likewise expressed his opinions on other men’s characters and\r\nconduct without reserve; and notwithstanding his abject poverty, his\r\npointed observations frequently inflicted wounds, for which it would\r\nhave been folly to express resentment.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Baubleshire was occupied with his numerous concerns, till\r\nwithin three or four days of his death, when he took to his bed; and\r\nover burdened by old age, peaceably lay down with the other departed\r\ndignitaries of the earth. The present portrait and particulars of him\r\nare from a print lithographed at Durham, where he took his title, and\r\nwhere he still lives in ephemeral fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·30.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 17.~\r\n\r\n1826.

The character of his infirmity was\r\nchildishness; he would play at marbles, spin his top, run his hoop, and\r\njoin the little boys in the village, with whom he was a great favourite,\r\nin all their sports. As a boy he was rational, but when he assumed the\r\nman, which he would now and then do, the poor fellow was a sad picture\r\nof misery. He would sit upon the steps of an old house, and ask if you\r\ndid not hear the thunder; then he would start as if to restrain the fury\r\nof a horse, and he would suddenly become mild again, and say, “I have\r\nseen her grave!” and he would weep like a child for hours. The story of\r\nhis early life I have heard my father thus relate:--\r\n\r\n“When I went to school with Joe Moody, he was a fine fellow, and\r\nremarkable for his good temper and lively disposition; he could run from\r\nus all, and was one of the best cricketers in the town. After he had\r\nleft school he became acquainted with Harriet F----; she was a very\r\nlovely girl, young and amiable, and had been sought by more than one\r\nrespectable farmer in the neighbourhood; but Joe was preferred by her,\r\nand by her parents. I need not say how endeared to each other they were;\r\nthe sequel shows it too plainly. In a few days they were to have been\r\nmade happy; friends were invited to the wedding, and a rich old aunt was\r\nto be of the party. Joe proposed that Harriet and himself should go and\r\nfetch this old lady; a mark of respect which was readily agreed to. With\r\nhopes high, and hearts of gaiety, the young folks set off on a fine\r\nsummer’s morning, with feelings which only youth and love can know. Who\r\ncan say this shall be a day of happiness? They had scarcely lost sight\r\nof home when the sky became overcast, and in a few minutes a dreadful\r\nstorm burst over their heads. The thunder and lightning were terrific,\r\nand the high spirited horse became unmanageable. Poor Joe endeavoured to\r\nrestrain its fury, but in vain; it left the track of the road; the hood\r\nof the chaise struck against the projecting branch of a tree, and both\r\nwere thrown out with extreme violence to the earth. Joe soon recovered,\r\nand his first care was his Harriet--she was a corpse at his feet! Poor\r\nJoe spoke not for some weeks; and the first return of imperfect sense,\r\nwas shown by his swimming a little cork boat which he found.”\r\n\r\nThis humour was encouraged, and often his melancholy weeping mood was\r\nturned by a kind proposition to play a game at marbles. He would come to\r\nmy father’s house sometimes, and borrow a penny to buy marbles, a string\r\nfor a kite, or some trifling toy. He never had his hair cut: it was very\r\nblack and glossy; and used to curl and hang about his shoulders like the\r\nhair of Charles II., whom he resembled somewhat in the face. Joe went\r\nregularly to church, and as regularly to the grave of his Harriet. In\r\nrainy or tempestuous weather, he would sit upon the steps of the door\r\nwhere he first met her, and ask of passing strangers whether they had\r\nseen her. He had a fine voice and taste for singing, with which he would\r\nsometimes amuse himself, but it generally led him to melancholy. Joe\r\nfeared but one person in the village, a Mr. S----, who once beat him at\r\nschool in a boyish fight.\r\n\r\nI went to Ballingdon last summer, and asked for Joe: an old man told me\r\nhe died suddenly on seeing a horse run away--he showed me his grave.\r\n\r\n  W.

The passions\r\nare the real, though unsteady and eccentric guides of our motions; of\r\nthese, fear is the most predominant; and in its hour of operation, has\r\nthe most commanding power. Why is it, that a man in a state of inebriety\r\nwill be little the worse for bruises which would cost the same man\r\nsober, his life? It is not the alcohol that gives life its tenacity, but\r\nit is the consequent absence of fear which prevents imaginary, being\r\nadded to real dangers. Like love, it feeds its own flame. In all ages,\r\nwhen earthly objects have ceased to terrify, men have conjured up\r\nphantoms for their minds’ excitation, which, when reason told them, were\r\nfalse, because invisible to the senses, they clothed with superhuman\r\nattributes; still, however, taking advantage of every incident their\r\nfancy misrepresented, to prove, at least, their material effects. Such\r\nis witchcraft; which in Scotland, not many years ago, was as generally\r\nbelieved in as Christianity, and which many, who have been excluded from\r\nthe polish of society, believe in still. Those who ventured to impugn\r\nthe doctrine, were held to be what the mob did not understand, but what\r\nthey believed to be something of extraordinary iniquity--“PAPISTS.”\r\n\r\nThe month of May has always been deemed peculiarly favourable for\r\nsupernatural appearances. No one will marry in May: but on the first\r\nmorning of that month, maidens rise early to gather May-dew, which they\r\nthrow over their shoulder in order to propitiate fate in allotting them\r\na good husband. If they can succeed by the way in catching a snail by\r\nthe horns, and throwing it over their shoulder, it is an omen of good\r\nluck; and if it is placed on a slate, then likewise it will describe by\r\nits turning, the initials of their future husband’s name.\r\n\r\nAnciently, the month of May was ushered in with many solemn rites, and\r\nthe first day had the name of “Beltane.” The “Beltane time” was a season\r\nof boisterous mirth and riotous festivity. There is still a fair at the\r\ntown of Peebles, which goes by the name of the Beltane fair. Our king,\r\nJames I., says,\r\n\r\n    “At Beltane quhar ilk bodie bownis\r\n      To Peblis to the play,\r\n    To hear ye sing and ye soundis\r\n      The solace suth to say.”\r\n\r\nThe mob elected a “king and queen of May,” and dressed them\r\nfantastically to preside over their ceremonies. There were also peculiar\r\ngames, and “Clerks’ Plays,” with which the multitude amused themselves\r\nat this season.\r\n\r\nAmong other superstitious observances for which May is reckoned\r\nfavourable, there is a custom of visiting certain wells, which were\r\nbelieved to possess a charm, for “curing of sick people,” during that\r\nmonth. In 1628, a number of persons were brought before the Kirk Session\r\nof Falkirk, accused of going to Christ’s well on the Sundays of May, to\r\nseek their health, and the whole being found guilty were sentenced to\r\nrepent “in linens” three several sabbaths. “And it is statute and\r\nordained that if any person, or persons, be found superstitiously and\r\nidolatrously, after this, to have passed in pilgrimage to Christ’s well,\r\non the Sundays of May to seek their health, they shall repent in _sacco_\r\n(sackcloth) and linen three several sabbaths, and pay twenty lib (Scots)\r\n_toties quoties_, for ilk fault; and if they cannot pay it, the baillies\r\nshall be recommended to put them in ward, and to be fed on bread and\r\nwater for aught days.”[186] They were obliged, for the preservation of\r\nthe charm, to keep strict silence on the way, to and from the well, and\r\nnot to allow the vessel in which the water was, to touch the ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1657, a mob of parishioners were summoned to the session, for\r\nbelieving in the powers of the well of Airth, a village about six miles\r\nnorth of Falkirk, on the banks of the Forth, and the whole were\r\nsentenced to be publicly rebuked for the sin.--“Feb. 3, 1757, Session\r\nconvenit. Compeared Bessie Thomson, who declairit scho went to the well\r\nat Airth, and that schoe left money thairat, and after the can was\r\nfillat with water, they keepit it from touching the ground till they cam\r\nhom.” “February 24.--Compeired Robert Fuird who declared he went to the\r\nwell of Airth, and spoke nothing als he went, and that Margrat Walker\r\nwent with him, and schoe said ye beleif about the well, and left money\r\nand ane napkin at the well, and all was done at her injunction.”\r\n“Compeared Bessie Thomson declarit schoe fetchit hom water from the said\r\nwell and luit it not touch the ground in homcoming, spoke not as sha\r\nwent, said the beleif at it, left money and ane napkin thair; and all\r\nwas done at Margrat Walker’s command,” “Compeired Margrat Walker who\r\ndenyit yat scho was at yat well befoir and yat scho gave my directions.”\r\n“March 10. Compeared Margrat Forsyth being demandit if scho went to the\r\nwell of Airth, to fetch water thairfrom, spok not by ye waye, luit it\r\nnot touch ye ground in homcoming? if scho said ye belief? left money and\r\nane napkin at it?

Compeired Ro^{t} Cochran, declairit, he\r\nwent to the well at Airth and ane other well, bot did neither say ye\r\nbeleif, nor leave money.” “Compeired Grissal Hutchin, declairit scho\r\ncommandit the lasses yat went to yat well, say ye beleif, but dischargit\r\nhir dochter.” “March 21. Compeired Robert Ffuird who declairit yat\r\nMargrat Walker went to ye well of Airth to fetch water to Robert Cowie,\r\nand when schoe com thair, scho laid down money in Gods name, and ane\r\nnapkin in Ro^{t} Cowie’s name.” “Compeired Jonet Robison who declairit\r\nyat when scho was seik, Jean Mathieson com to hir and told hir, that the\r\nwater of the well of Airth was guid for seik people, and yat the said\r\nJean hir guid sister desyrit hir fetch sum of it to hir guid man as he\r\nwas seik, bot scho durst never tell him.” These people were all\r\n“publicly admonishit for superstitious carriage.” Yet within these few\r\nyears, a farmer and his servant were known to travel fifty miles for the\r\npurpose of bringing water from a charmed well in the Highlands to cure\r\ntheir sick cattle.\r\n\r\nThe records contain some curious notices concerning witchcraft, which\r\nare all certified to “my lord’s court,” the baronial juridical\r\nconservator of the public peace; but, if we may judge from the\r\nre-appearance of the parties, none, much to the laird of Callander’s\r\nhonour, ever were punished. I may afterwards give some of these for the\r\namusement of the readers of the _Every-Day Book_, who will likewise find\r\nin the “Scots’ Magazine” for March, 1814, an account of trials for\r\nwitchcraft at Borroustaunness, which ended in six poor creatures’\r\ncondemnation on the twenty-third of December, 1679, to “be wirried at a\r\nsteak till they be dead, and then to have their bodies burnt to ashes!”\r\n\r\nThe reputed consequences of the _blink of an ill-ee_, are either death,\r\nor some horrible debility; for which there are some preventitives, such\r\nas rolling a red silk thread round the finger or the neck, or keeping a\r\nslip of rowntree (mountain ash) in the bonnet; and last, not least,\r\nthere is a “gruel, thick and slab,” which is reckoned efficacious in\r\naverting “Skaith.” At this day, even in the twenty-sixth year of the\r\nnineteenth century, an old woman in Falkirk earns a comfortable\r\nlivelihood by the sale of “_Skaith Saw_.”\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT KIER\r\n\r\n  _Falkirk, May 16, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·42.\r\n\r\n  [186] Session Records, June 12, 1628.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 21.~\r\n\r\n1826.

I also\r\nenclose a fac-simile of his hand writing, which was presented to me by a\r\nvery obliging friend, Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth, Esq., F. S. A.,\r\nand author of a very splendid and elaborate “History of the County\r\nPalatinate of Durham.”\r\n\r\n  Your’s truly,\r\n\r\n  JOHN SYKES\r\n\r\n  _Newcastle, Tyne, April 25, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. Emerson\r\n\r\nHurworth\r\n\r\nOct. 1. 1771.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Emerson was born at Hurworth, a pleasant village, about three\r\nmiles from Darlington, in the county of Durham, on the 14th of May,\r\n1701. The preceptor of his early years was his own father, of whom he\r\nlearned writing and arithmetic, and probably the rudiments of Latin.\r\nAfter having studied mathematics with much ardour under able masters, at\r\nNewcastle and York, he returned to Hurworth, and again benefited by the\r\nknowledge of his father, who was a tolerable master of the mathematics.\r\nSome degree of Emerson’s celebrity may be attributed to the treatment\r\nwhich he received from Dr. Johnson, rector of Hurworth, whose niece he\r\nhad married. The doctor had engaged to give five hundred pounds to his\r\nniece, who lived with him, as a marriage portion; but when reminded of\r\nthe promise, he choose to forget that it had been made, and treated our\r\nyoung mathematician as a person beneath his notice.\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary disappointment Emerson (who had an independent spirit, and\r\nwhose patrimony though not large, was equal to all his wants) would\r\neasily have surmounted, but the contemptuous treatment stung him to the\r\nsoul. He immediately went home, packed up his wife’s clothes, and sent\r\nthem to the doctor, saying, that he would scorn to be beholden to such a\r\nfellow for a single rag; vowing at the same time that he would be\r\nrevenged, and prove himself to be the _better man of the two_. His first\r\npublication, however, did not meet with immediate encouragement, and\r\nmost probably his other works would never have appeared, at least in the\r\nauthor’s lifetime, if Edward Montague, Esq., his great admirer and\r\nfriend, had not procured him the patronage of Mr. John Nourse,\r\nbookseller and optician, who being himself skilled in the more abstruse\r\nsciences, immediately engaged Emerson to furnish a regular course of\r\nmathematics for the use of students, and in the summer of 1763, Emerson\r\nmade a journey to London, to settle and fulfil the agreement.\r\n\r\nHis devotion to the philosophy of sir Isaac Newton was so uncommonly\r\nstrong, that every oppugner of this great man was treated by Emerson as\r\ndull, blind, bigotted, prejudiced, or mad, and the fire and impetuosity\r\nof his temper would on these occasions betray him into language far\r\ndistant from the strictness of mathematical demonstration. Mr. E. was in\r\nperson something below the common size, but firm, compact, well made,\r\nvery active and strong. He had a good open expressive countenance, with\r\na ruddy complexion, a keen and penetrating eye, and an ardour and\r\neagerness of look that was very demonstrative of the texture of his\r\nmind. His dress was grotesque frequently; sometimes mean and shabby. A\r\nvery few hats served him through the whole course of his life; and when\r\nhe purchased one (or indeed any other article of dress) it was perfectly\r\nindifferent to him whether the form or fashion of it was of the day, or\r\nof half a century before. One of these hats of immense superficies, had,\r\nby length of time, lost its elasticity, and its brim began to droop in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent his being able to view the objects before\r\nhim in a direct line. This was not to be endured by an optician; he\r\ntherefore took a pair of sheers, and cut it off by the body of the hat,\r\nleaving a little to the front, which he dexterously rounded into the\r\nresemblance of the nib of a jockey’s cap. His wigs were made of brown,\r\nor of a dirty flaxen coloured hair, which at first appeared bushy and\r\ntortuous behind, but which grew pendulous through age, till at length it\r\nbecame quite straight, having probably never undergone the operation of\r\nthe comb; and either through the original mal-formation of the wig, or\r\nfrom a custom he had of frequently thrusting his hand beneath it, the\r\nback part of his head and wig seldom came into very close contact. His\r\ncoat or more properly jacket, or waistcoat with sleeves to it, which he\r\ncommonly wore without any other waistcoat, was of drab colour; his linen\r\nwas more calculated for warmth and duration than show, being spun and\r\nbleached by his wife, and woven at Hurworth. In cold weather he had a\r\ncustom of wearing his shirt with the wrong side before, and buttoned\r\nbehind the neck, yet this was not an affectation of singularity, (for\r\nEmerson had no affectation, though his customs and manners were\r\nsingular,) he had a reason for it; he seldom buttoned more than two or\r\nthree buttons of his waistcoat, leaving all the rest open; in wind,\r\nrain, or snow, therefore, he must have found the aperture at the breast\r\ninconvenient if his shirt had been put on in the usual manner. When he\r\ngrew aged, in cold weather, he used to wear what he called\r\n_shin-covers_: these were pieces of old sacking, tied with strings above\r\nthe knee, and depending down to the shoe, in order to prevent his legs\r\nfrom being scorched when he sat too near the fire. This singularity of\r\ndress and figure, together with his character for profound learning, and\r\nknowledge more than human, occasioned the illiterate and ignorant to\r\nconsider him as a cunning man, or necromancer, and various stories have\r\nbeen related of his skill in the _black art_. He affected an appearance\r\nof infidelity on religious matters, and was an example to the vulgar,\r\nnot a little reprehensible. His diet was as simple and plain as his\r\ndress, and his meals gave little interruption either to his studies,\r\nemployments, or amusements. He catered for himself, and pretty\r\nconstantly went to Darlington, to make his own markets; yet, when he had\r\nprovided all the necessary articles, he not unfrequently neglected to\r\nreturn home for a day or two, seating himself contentedly in some public\r\nhouse, where he could procure good ale and company, and passing the\r\nhours in various topics of conversation. His style of conversation was\r\ngenerally abrupt and blunt, and often vulgar and ungrammatical. This\r\noccasioned a supposition, that his prefaces were not written by himself,\r\nan opinion that was one day mentioned to him, and the disparity of his\r\nconversation and writing pointed out as the reason. After a momentary\r\npause, he exclaimed, with some indignation, “A pack of fools! who would\r\nwrite my prefaces but myself.” Mr. Emerson often tried to practise the\r\neffect of his mathematical speculations, by constructing a variety of\r\ninstruments, mathematical, mechanical, and musical, on a small scale. He\r\nmade a spinning-wheel for his wife, which is represented in his book of\r\nmechanics. He was well skilled in the science of music, the theory of\r\nsounds, and the various scales both ancient and modern. He was a great\r\ncontributor to the “Lady’s Diary,” under the signature of “Merones,” and\r\nfor many years unknown, until a transposition of letters discovered his\r\nname.[187] During the greater part of his life, his health had been\r\nstrong and uninterrupted; but as he advanced into the vale of years,\r\ninternal complaints allowed him but little intermission of pain, and at\r\nlength deprived him of breath on the twenty-first of May, 1782, aged\r\neighty-one years and one week. He was buried in the churchyard of his\r\nnative village where he died. About a twelvemonth before his decease, he\r\nwas prevailed on after much importunity, to sit for his portrait, which\r\nwas taken by Mr. Sykes, for his friend Mr. Cloudsley of Darlington,\r\nsurgeon. It is said to be a most striking likeness.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·32.\r\n\r\n  [187]\r\n\r\n      “Beneath the shelter of the silent elm,\r\n    His native elm (to sapience still a friend)\r\n    MERONES loves, and meditates beneath\r\n    The verdure of thy leaves: see there\r\n    How silently he sits! and lost in thought,\r\n    Weighs in his mind some great design! revolves\r\n    He now his _Subtile Fluxions_? or displays\r\n    By truest signs the _Sphere’s Projection_ wide?\r\n    Wide as thy sphere, Merones, be thy fame.”\r\n\r\n  See a poem on the old Elm at Hurworth, in _Gent.

Immediately after any lady, or respectable\r\nfarmer or tradesman’s wife became mother of a child, the steward called\r\nat the house, and begged permission for “sops and ale;” which was always\r\ngranted, and conducted in the following order:--Three tables were placed\r\nin some convenient room; one of which was covered with the above napkin,\r\nand had a china bowl and plates, with silver handled knives and forks\r\nplaced on it; and in the bowl were put biscuits sopped with wine, and\r\nsweetened with fine sugar. The second table was also covered with a\r\ncloth, with china, or other earthern plates, and a bowl with beer sops,\r\nsweetened with fine sugar, and decent knives and forks. The third table\r\nwas placed without any cloth; and on it were put the wooden bowl,\r\nknives, forks, and trenchers, as before described, with the candlesticks\r\nand sugar cups; and in the bowl were beer sops, sweetened with the\r\ncoarsest sugar. As soon as the evening service was over, having had\r\nprevious notice from the steward, the company assembled, and were placed\r\nin the following order:--those persons whose wives were mothers of\r\ntwins, were placed at the upper or first table; those whose wives had a\r\nchild or children, at the second table; and such persons as were\r\nmarried, and had no children, together with the old bachelors, were\r\nplaced at the third table, which was styled _the bachelors’ table_,\r\nunder which title the gentlemen who sat at it, were addressed for that\r\nevening, and the gentlemen at the first table were styled _benchers_.\r\nProper toasts were given, adapted for the occasion, and the company\r\nalways broke up at eight o’clock, generally very cheerful and\r\ngood-humoured.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·87.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 23.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThis is the anniversary of one of the great duke of Marlborough’s most\r\ncelebrated engagements, the battle of Ramilles, a place near Namur in\r\nthe Netherlands, where, on this day, in the year 1706, he gained a\r\nmemorable victory over the French. It was in this battle that colonel\r\nGardiner, then an ensign in the nineteenth year of his age, received a\r\nshot in his mouth, from a musket ball, which, without destroying any of\r\nhis teeth, or touching the fore part of his tongue, went through his\r\nneck, and came out about an inch and a half on the left side of the\r\nvertebræ. He felt no pain, but dropped soon after, and lay all night\r\namong his dying companions; he recovered in an almost miraculous manner,\r\nand became, from a most profligate youth, a character eminent for\r\npiety.[188]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·57.\r\n\r\n  [188] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 24.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK KETCH AND NEWGATE.\r\n\r\nOn this day, in 1736, five felons in Newgate were to have been executed;\r\nbut the prison was so insecure, that, during the night, one of them\r\n“took up a board and got out of his cell, and made his escape.” The\r\nother four were taken to Tyburn and suffered their sentence; and Jack\r\nKetch “on his return from doing his duty at Tyburn, robbed a woman of\r\nthree shillings and sixpence.”[189]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 56·42.\r\n\r\n  [189] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 25.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCORPUS CHRISTI DAY.\r\n\r\nOn Corpus Christi day, at about a quarter before one o’clock at noon,\r\nthe worshipful company of skinners (attended by a number of boys which\r\nthey have in Christ’s Hospital school, and girls strewing herbs before\r\nthem) walk in procession from their hall on Dowgate-hill, to the church\r\nof St. Antholin’s, in Watling-street, to hear service.

CHARLES II.

WAS CONCEALED AFTER THE BATTLE OF WORCESTER.]\r\n\r\nThis engraving, from a rare print of great value, represents\r\nBoscobel-house, in the state it was when Charles II. and colonel Carlos\r\ntook refuge there. They remained in the house till they became alarmed\r\nfor their safety.\r\n\r\nDr Stukely mentions the straits to which Charles was reduced during his\r\nconcealment at this place. “Not far from Boscobel-house, just by a\r\nhorse track passing through the wood, stood the royal oak, into which\r\nthe king and his companion, colonel Carlos, climbed by means of the\r\nhenroost ladder, when they judged it no longer safe to stay in the\r\nhouse; the family reaching them victuals with the nuthook. The tree is\r\nnow enclosed in with a brick wall, the inside whereof is covered with\r\nlaurel, of which we may say, as Ovid did of that before the Augustine\r\npalace, ‘mediamque tuebere quercum.’ Close by its side grows a young\r\nthriving plant from one of its acorns. Over the door of the enclosure, I\r\ntook this inscription in marble:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Felicissimam arborem quam in asylum potentissimi Regis Caroli II.\r\n  Deus O.

At that time it had green\r\nlanes and bowling-alleys to delight the gentry, and attract the citizens\r\nof the metropolis. It is now, in 1826, covered with houses, and without\r\na single public place of reputable entertainment; not even a\r\nbowling-green.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·72.\r\n\r\n  [191] Gentleman’s Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\n~May 31.~\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF AN ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of the elephant belonging to Mr. Cross, at Exeter\r\nChange, described in the present volume, may be paralleled the\r\ndestruction of another on this day in the year 1820. The particulars are\r\nrelated in the “London Magazine” of April 1, 1826; they seem to have\r\nbeen translated from a “Notice sur l’Elephant mort a Geneve le 31 Mai\r\ndernier,” in the “_Almanach Historique, nommé Messager Boiteux_ pour\r\nl’An de grace, 1821,” which has been sent to the editor of the\r\n_Every-Day Book_ for the purpose of enabling him to lay the annexed\r\nengraving before the readers of London, from a print in that “Almanac,”\r\nwhich is printed in quarto “á Vevey, chez Freres Lœrtscher.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May, 1820, for about a fortnight a fine Bengal elephant (Elephas\r\nIndicus, Cuvier--Elephas Maximus, Linn.) had been exhibited at Geneva.\r\nThe elephants of this species are taller than those of Africa. They have\r\nan elevated cranium, which has two protuberances on its summit; the\r\nfrontal bone is rather concave, and the head proportionably longer;\r\ntheir tusks are smaller than those of the African elephant. The animal\r\nin question had but one; he had lost the other by some accident. He was\r\nnine feet high, and of a dark-brown colour, he was ten years old, and\r\nhad been bought in London six years before. Mademoiselle Garnier, (the\r\nniece of his proprietor,) to whom he was much attached, always travelled\r\nwith him. She was the proprietor of an elephant which had broken loose\r\nat Venice a few years previously, and was killed by a cannon-shot, after\r\nit had committed considerable ravages in that city.\r\n\r\nThe present elephant was of a much gentler character, and had excited a\r\ngeneral interest during its stay in Geneva, by its docility and\r\nintelligence; it performed all the usual tricks which are taught these\r\nanimals, with a promptitude of obedience, a dexterity, and almost a\r\ngrace, which were quite remarkable. Whenever mademoiselle Garnier\r\nwitnessed his exercises, her presence seemed to call forth all these\r\nqualities to an extraordinary degree. According to her statement he was\r\nso familiar and social that he had more than once appeared on the stage\r\nat Lille, Antwerp, &c. playing the principal part in a procession, and\r\nseeming proud to carry the lady who acted the princess, before whom he\r\nwould kneel to take her on his back. So far from being frightened at the\r\nlights, the music, and the noise of the house, he seemed delighted to\r\ntake a part in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to liberty, and much as he loved it, he yet endured\r\nconfinement with patience, and when his keeper came to fasten him up\r\nfor the night, he used to stretch out his foot to receive the iron ring\r\nby which he was chained till morning, to a post deeply fixed in the\r\nearth. Unlike these animals in England, he did not travel in a cage, but\r\nwas led from one town to another by night; he had three drivers, his\r\nkeeper, properly so called, and two others, one of whom had always\r\ninspired him with more fear than attachment.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his stay at Geneva he had exhibited symptoms\r\nof excitement and restlessness, arising from two causes--the one, the\r\nfrequent discharges of musketry from the soldiers who were exercised\r\nnear his habitation, at which he was greatly irritated; the other, the\r\nparoxysms to which these animals are subject for several weeks in the\r\nspring. Nevertheless, he had never disobeyed nor menaced his keepers.\r\n\r\nHis departure was fixed for the 31st of May. He left Geneva at midnight,\r\nthe gates and drawbridges having been opened for that purpose by\r\npermission of the syndic of the guard, the magistrate at the head of the\r\nmilitary police. He was driven by his keeper and his two assistants, who\r\ncarried a lantern. Mademoiselle Garnier was to follow in the morning. He\r\nmade no difficulty in crossing the drawbridge, and took the road to\r\nSwitzerland apparently in high spirits. But about a quarter of a league\r\nfrom the town he appeared out of humour with the keeper, and disposed to\r\nattack him. The man ran away towards the city; the elephant pursued him\r\nup to the gate, which the officer on guard opened, on his own\r\nresponsibility, wisely calculating that it would be more easy to secure\r\nhim within the town than without it, and that he might do immense\r\nmischief on the high roads, especially as it was the market-day at\r\nGeneva. He re-entered the town without hesitation, pursuing, rather than\r\nfollowing his keeper and guides, between whom and himself all influence,\r\nwhether of attachment or of fear, seemed at an end. From this moment he\r\nwas his own master.\r\n\r\nHe walked for some time in the place de Saint Gervais, appearing to\r\nenjoy his liberty and the beauty of the night. He lay down for a few\r\nminutes on a heap of sand, prepared for some repairs in the pavement,\r\nand played with the stones collected for the same purpose. Perceiving\r\none of his guides, who was watching him from the entrance of one of the\r\nbridges over the Rhone, he ran at him, and would have attacked him, and\r\nprobably done him some serious injury, if he had not escaped.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Garnier having been informed of what had passed, hastened\r\nto the spot, and trusting to the attachment he had always shown for her,\r\nwent up to him with great courage, with some dainties of which he was\r\nparticularly fond, and speaking to him with gentleness and confidence,\r\nled him into a place enclosed with walls near the barrack he had\r\ninhabited, into which he could not be induced to return. This place,\r\ncalled the Bastion d’Hollande, adjoined a shed containing caissoons,\r\nwaggons, and gun-carriages; there were also cannon-balls piled up in an\r\nadjoining yard. Being left alone, and the gate shut upon him, he amused\r\nhimself with trying his strength and skill upon every thing within his\r\nreach; he raised several caissoons and threw them on their sides, and\r\nseemed pleased at turning the wheels; he took up the balls with his\r\ntrunk, and tossed them in the air, and ran about with a vivacity which\r\nmight have been ascribed either to gaiety or to irritation.\r\n\r\nAt two in the morning, the syndic of the guard being informed of the\r\ncircumstance, went to the spot to consult on the measures to be taken.\r\nMademoiselle Garnier in a state of the utmost distress and agitation,\r\nentreated that the elephant might be killed in the most speedy and\r\ncertain way possible. The syndic, sharing in the general feeling of\r\ninterest the noble and gentle creature had excited in the town, opposed\r\nher desire. He represented that the animal was now in a place of\r\nsecurity against all danger, whether to the public or himself; and that\r\nas his present state of irritation was, in its very nature, transient,\r\nand would soon yield to a proper regimen; but mademoiselle Garnier\r\nremembered the occurrences at Venice, and felt the whole weight and\r\nresponsibility of the management of the animal was on herself alone; for\r\nthe keeper and guides had decidedly refused to attend upon him again,\r\nand she persisted in her demand. The magistrate would not give his\r\nconsent until it was put into writing and signed.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment arrangements were made for destroying him. The chemists\r\nwere laid under contribution for drugs, while two breaches were made in\r\nthe wall, at each of which a four-pounder was placed, which was to be\r\nthe _ratio ultima_ if the poison failed.\r\n\r\nM. Mayor, eminent as a surgeon, and for his learning in natural history,\r\nand one of the directors of the museum, had taken great delight in\r\nvisiting the elephant during his stay, and the animal had evinced a\r\nparticular affection for him. This induced the magistrate to request M.\r\nMayor to administer the poison. M. Mayor, after mixing about three\r\nounces of prussic acid with about ten ounces of brandy, which was the\r\nanimal’s favourite liquor, called him by his name to one of the\r\nbreaches. The elephant came immediately, seized the bottle with his\r\ntrunk, and swallowed the liquor at one draught, as if it had been his\r\nusual drink. This poison, the operation of which, even in the smallest\r\ndoses, is usually tremendously rapid, did not appear to produce any\r\nsensible effect on him; he walked backwards with a firm step to the\r\nmiddle of the enclosure, where he lay down for some moments. It was\r\nthought that the poison was beginning to act, but he soon rose again,\r\nand began to play with the caissoons, and to walk about in the courtyard\r\nof the arsenal. M. Mayor, presuming that the prussic acid which had been\r\nkept some time had lost its strength, prepared three boluses of an ounce\r\nof arsenic each, mixed with honey and sugar. The elephant came again at\r\nhis call, and took them all from his hand. At the expiration of a\r\nquarter of an hour, he did not appear at all affected by them. A fresh\r\ndose was then offered him; he took it, smelt at it for some minutes,\r\nthen threw it to a distance, and began again to play all sorts of\r\ntricks. Sometimes he came to the breach, and, twining his trunk round\r\nthe mouth of the cannon, pushed it back as if he had some indistinct\r\nnotion of the danger which threatened him.\r\n\r\nIt was five in the morning when the first dose of poison was\r\nadministered; an hour had elapsed, and no symptom of its internal action\r\nappeared. Meanwhile the market time drew near, the space around the\r\nwalls was rapidly filling with inquisitive spectators, and the order was\r\ngiven to fire. The gunner seized the moment in which the elephant, who\r\nhad advanced to the breach, was retiring, and presented his side. The\r\nmouth of the cannon almost touched him. The ball entered near the ear\r\nbehind the right eye, came out behind the left ear, went through a thick\r\npartition on the opposite side of the enclosure, and spent itself\r\nagainst a wall. The animal stood still for two or three seconds then\r\ntottered, and fell on his side without convulsion or movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Death of the Elephant at Geneva, May 31, 1820.~]\r\n\r\nThe above engraving, from that in the foreign almanac already mentioned,\r\nrepresents the manner wherein his death was effected.\r\n\r\nThe event circulated through the town with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n“They have killed the elephant!” “What had the noble creature done? he\r\nwas so good, so gentle, so amiable!” “What a pity!” The people ran with\r\none accord to the spot, to satisfy themselves with a nearer view. The\r\neagerness was so great that the authorities were obliged to take steps\r\nfor keeping order in the crowd, and a small sum of money was demanded\r\nfrom each for the benefit of the proprietor. The same evening, by\r\narrangements entered into with mademoiselle Garnier, for securing the\r\nremains of the animal for the museum, the surgeons proceeded to open the\r\nbody, which they continued to dissect for several successive days. The\r\noperations were executed by M. Mayor, the chevalier Bourdet, a\r\nnaturalist and traveller, and M. Vichet, an eminent pupil of the\r\nveterinary surgeon of Alfort. They took an exact measurement of the\r\nanimal. They traced its silhouette on the wall; and made separate casts\r\nof its head, and the two feet of one side. All the principal viscera,\r\nexcept the liver, which decomposed too rapidly, and the brain, which was\r\nshattered by the ball, were carefully removed and preserved in a\r\nsolution of oxygenated muriate of mercury. The spleen was six feet long.\r\nThe muscular or fleshy parts, as the season would not allow of their\r\nslow dissection, were taken away rather by the hatchet than the\r\nbistoury. They were given to the public, who were extremely eager and\r\nanxious to eat elephant’s flesh, and much tempted by its excellent\r\nappearance, dressed as it was with every variety of sauce. They seemed\r\nperfectly regardless of the poison, which indeed had not time to\r\ndevelope itself in the muscular system. Three or four hundred persons\r\nate of it without injury, excepting one or two individuals, who brought\r\non a fit of indigestion by indulging to excess. The osseous carcass was\r\nput into a state of maceration previous to re-composing the skeleton, in\r\norder to its deposit in the museum of natural history. The interest\r\ntaken in that establishment was so strong, that the large sum required\r\nto secure possession of the entire carcass, was raised by subscription\r\nin a few days. The skin was found too thick to be tanned by the ordinary\r\nprocess, and as the epidermis began to detach itself naturally, it was\r\ncarefully separated from the dermis, which it was not essential to\r\npreserve entire. The epidermis retained its proper consistency, in order\r\nto be supplied by a well-known process in covering the artificial\r\ncarcass, constructed under the direction of Messrs. Mayor and Bourdet.\r\n\r\nIf mademoiselle Garnier had not succeeded in enticing the animal to the\r\nplace where his destruction was effected, the mischief he might have\r\noccasioned by remaining at large, till the inhabitants of Geneva had\r\nrisen from their beds to their daily occupations, can scarcely be\r\nimagined; especially as it was on a market-day, when the city is usually\r\nthronged with country people, and most persons are necessarily out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May Custom at Buckingham._\r\n\r\nRINGING THE OLD BAILIFF OUT.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--On this day, unusual bustle set the town of Buckingham alive. It\r\nwas the festive consecration of the first Sunday after May-day. Having\r\ntaken care of my horse and left the inn, I heard a band of music\r\napproaching the church, which is a cheerful edifice, standing on an\r\neminence with a painted glass window. The bells rung merrily, and the\r\nsunshine gave lustre to the surrounding country, beautified by light and\r\nshade. The main street was presently lined with townspeople and\r\nvillagers. My inquiries as to the cause of this “busy hum of men” were\r\nsoon satisfied by the cry that, “They’re ringing the old bailiff out!”\r\nAs the musicians (not of the opera band, nor of the Hanover rooms,) came\r\nnearer with the accumulating procession, I with difficulty learned the\r\ntheme of their endeavours to be Weber’s “Hark! follow!” I never heard\r\nany thing surpass this murder of melody. Had Weber been present, he\r\nwould not have regretted he had given the MS. of Der Freischütz, to\r\ndischarge a trifling debt, which I am informed was really the case. Such\r\ndiscord, however, worked no “incantation” here. All faces smiled, all\r\nhearts appeared glad. The cavalcade moved in pairs. First two small\r\nchildren in white with garlands, then, behind them, two, a size larger;\r\nthen others, increasing in growth and tallness, till six wreathed\r\nmaidens and their swains moved onwards, dancing and shaking their curly\r\nlocks in sportive glee around the Maypole, decorated in the habiliments\r\nof nature’s sweetest and choicest spring flowers and boughs. Dolls of\r\nvarious dresses were placed in the midst, as though they looked out of\r\nbowers for the arrival of kindred playfellows. Then came his worship,\r\nthe bailiff, a sir John Falstaff-like sort of person, swelling with\r\npleasurable consequence; the shining mace borne on the shoulder\r\nintimated his dignity. What a happy day of honour, of triumph, and\r\ngreatness to him! Then followed the leading men of the town, the\r\nburgesses in their corporate robes and nosegays. Their friends paraded\r\naside in their Sunday clothes, like “ladies of olden days” and “squires\r\nof high degree.” Favours and flags played on the fresh air, inviting\r\nrural enjoyment. Many rosy-faced damosels in their “best bibs and\r\ntuckers” illustrated the time by appearing at the windows; infants were\r\nheld up to behold, and the aged crept to the doors, to take a glimpse of\r\nwhat they might not live to see repeated. As the procession arrived at\r\nthe churchyard gate, soldiers were arranged in line, preparing to meet\r\nand unite in the gaiety of the day. It is thus pleasant to view the\r\nmilitary and civil powers, peacefully ornamenting the general harmony of\r\nthe season. The subordinates and illustrators of this annual custom,\r\nopened a passage at the church door, and the bailiff led the way into\r\nhis seat. The bells rested their metal tongues, and the music ceased\r\nawhile. People of all descriptions, in all directions, hurried to their\r\nrespective pews, with accommodating civility to strangers. The curate\r\nopened his book and his duties, the clerk unsheathed his spectacles,\r\nconfined his nostrils, and the service was reverently performed, with a\r\nsuitable discourse and decent melody. After this was ended, the bailiff\r\nand his friends returned in like order as they came, perambulating the\r\nprecincts of the town. Then the glory of all true Britons, was\r\nmanifested by the clatter of knives and forks, at the favourite depôt\r\nfor provisions, and genuine hilarity closed the “ringing out of the old\r\nbailiff,” and the ringing in of the new one.\r\n\r\n  J.

During this period he composed the\r\nwell known “_Dulce domum_,” being the recollections of the pleasures he\r\nwas wont to join in, at that season of the year. Grief at the disgrace\r\nand the disappointment he endured, so heavily affected him, that he did\r\nnot live to witness the return of his companions, at the end of their\r\nholydays.\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of the above, annually on the evening preceding the\r\nWhitsun holydays, the master, scholars, and choristers of the above\r\ncollege, attended by a band of music, walk in procession round the court\r\nof the college and the pillar to which it is alleged the unfortunate\r\nyouth was tied, and chant the verses which he composed in his\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nDULCE DOMUM!\r\n\r\n      Concinamus, O sodales!\r\n    Eja! quid silemus?\r\n      Nobile canticum!\r\n    Dulce melos, domum!\r\n    Dulce domum, resonemus.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        Domum, domum, dulce domum;\r\n        Domum, domum, dulce domum!\r\n        Dulce, dulce, domum!\r\n        Dulce domum, resonemus!\r\n\r\n      Appropinquat ecce! felix\r\n        Hora gaudiorum,\r\n      Post grave tedium\r\n      Advenit omnium\r\n        Meta petita laborum.\r\n                         Domum, domum, &c.\r\n\r\n      Musa, libros mitte, fessa,\r\n        Mitte pensa dura,\r\n      Mitte negotium\r\n      Jam datur otium,\r\n        Me mea mittito cura.\r\n                         Domum, domum, &c.\r\n\r\n      Ridet annus, prata rident;\r\n        Nosque rideamus,\r\n      Jam repetit domum,\r\n      Daulius advena:\r\n        Nosque domum repetamus,\r\n                         Domum, domum, &c.\r\n\r\n      Heus!

Mr.\r\nBrand, who adds, of the song, that “it is no doubt of very remote\r\nantiquity, and that its origin must be traced, not to any ridiculous\r\ntradition, but to the tenderest feelings of human nature.” He refers for\r\nthe English verses to the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” for March, 1796, where\r\nthey first appeared, and calls them “a spirited translation.” On looking\r\ninto that volume, it seems they were written by one of Mr. Urban’s\r\ncorrespondents, who signs “J. R.” and dates from “New-street,\r\nHanover-square.” Dr. Milner says, that from “amongst many translations\r\nof this Winchester ode,” the present “appears best to convey the sense,\r\nspirit, and measure, of the original; the former versions were unworthy\r\nof it.” He alleges that the existence of the original can only be traced\r\nup to the distance of about a century; yet its real author, and the\r\noccasion of its composition, are already clouded with fables.[192]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN VOCAL MUSIC.\r\n\r\nBy the favour of a correspondent in North America, we are enabled to\r\nextract from the “Colonial Advocate” of Queenston, the following\r\ninteresting article, by a Scotch resident, on the state of melody in the\r\nregion he inhabits. It particularly relates to May.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTTISH SONGS.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Scotia! o’er the swelling sea\r\n    From childhood’s hopes, from friends, from thee,\r\n    On earth where’er thy offspring roam,\r\n    This day their hearts should wander home.\r\n      Her sons are brave, her daughters fair,\r\n      Her gowan glens no slave can share,\r\n      Then from the feeling never stray,\r\n      That loves the land that’s far away.”\r\n\r\n  _Sung by Mr. Maywood, on St. Andrew’s day, in New York._\r\n\r\nI have often thought it a pity that there is no feature in which Canada,\r\nand indeed America in general, exhibits more dissimilarity to Scotland,\r\nthan in its want of vocal music. On the highland hills, and in the\r\nlowland vallies, of Caledonia, we are delighted with the music of the\r\nfeathered choristers, who fill heaven in a May morning with their matin\r\nsongs. The shepherd whistles “The Yellow Hair’d Laddie”--the shepherdess\r\nsings “In April when primroses deck the sweet plain”--all nature seems\r\nin harmony. But here all is dulness and monotony,\r\n\r\n    “We call on pleasure--and around\r\n    A mocking world repeats the sound!”\r\n\r\nEven the emigrant seems to have forgotten his native mountains; and in\r\nthe five years in which I have sojourned in America, I have not once\r\nheard “Roslin Castle” sung by a swain on a blithe summer’s day. Here\r\nthey are all dull plodding farmers, as devoid of sober melody as the\r\nhuge forests which surround them are void of grace and beauty: talk to\r\nthem of poetry and music, and they will sit with sad civility, “as\r\nsilent as Pygmalion’s wife.”\r\n\r\nNow and then you may hear a hoarse raven of an old woodchopper in the\r\nbarroom of a filthy tavern, roaring in discordant notes, “Yankee\r\nDoodle:” or, in a church or meeting-house, you may behold fifteen or\r\ntwenty men and women picked out of the congregation, stuck up in a\r\nparticular part of the house and singing the praises of redeeming love,\r\nwith the voices of so many stentors. The affectation they display,\r\ncannot fail to disgust you: the form of godliness is present, but the\r\npower thereof is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe memory of a native Scotsman retraces back those halcyon days, when\r\ngladness filled the corn-field--when sober mirth and glee crowned the\r\nmaiden feast--when the song went merrily round at Yule, to chase away\r\nthe winter frosts; and coming to the day of universal rest from labour,\r\ncalls to mind the venerable precentor with his well-remembered solemn\r\ntunes, where _old and young_, infancy and advanced age, willingly joined\r\ntogether in singing his praise--where the fiddle and the flute, the harp\r\nand the organ, were useless--where no set people stood up in a corner,\r\nas if to say, “we, the aristocracy of this congregation, can offer a\r\nsweeter and more acceptable sacrifice than you, with our melodious\r\nvoices so much better attuned than yours.”\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, appear irreverend in me, to say a word of sacred music\r\nin an essay intended for Scottish songs; but I thought the contrast\r\nwould not be complete without this allusion. A late essayist “On vulgar\r\nprejudices against Literature,” uses a fine argument in favour of native\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n“Let us ask,” says he, “has Britain a greater claim to distinction among\r\nthe nations of the world, from any one circumstance, however celebrated\r\nit be in arts and arms, than from its being the birthplace of\r\nShakspeare? And if the celebration of the anniversary of Waterloo be\r\nheld in the farthest settlements of India, so is the anniversary of the\r\nbirth of Robert Burns, the pastoral poet of Scotland:--\r\n\r\n    “Encamped by Indian rivers wild,\r\n    The soldier, resting on his arms,\r\n    In Burns’s carol sweet recalls\r\n    The scenes that blest him when a child,\r\n    And glows and gladdens at the charms\r\n    Of Scotia’s woods and waterfalls.”\r\n\r\nWhen kingdoms, and states, and cities pass away, what then proves to be\r\nthe most imperishable of their records, the most durable of their\r\nglories? Is it not the lay of the poet? the eloquence of the patriot?\r\nthe page of the historian? Is it not the genius of the nation, imprinted\r\non these, the most splendid of its annals, and transmitted, as a legacy,\r\nand a token of its vanished glory, to the after ages of mankind? And\r\nnow, when the glories of Greece and Rome are but shadows, does not our\r\nblood stir within us at the recital of their mighty achievements, and of\r\ntheir majestic thoughts, which, but for the page of the chronicler would\r\nhave been long ere now a blank and a vacancy; glory departed without a\r\ntrace, or figures traced upon the sand, and washed away by the returns\r\nof the tide:--\r\n\r\n    “Oh! who shall lightly say that fame,\r\n    Is nothing but an empty name?\r\n    When, but for those, our mighty dead,\r\n      All ages past a blank would be,\r\n    Sunk in oblivion’s murky bed,\r\n      A desert bare, a shipless sea.\r\n\r\n    They are the distant objects seen;\r\n    The lofty marks of what hath been,\r\n    Oh! who shall lightly say that fame\r\n    Is nothing but an empty name?\r\n\r\n    Where memory of the mighty dead\r\n      To earth-worn pilgrims’ wistful eye\r\n    The brightest rays of cheering shed,\r\n      That point to immortality.”\r\n\r\nThe blue hills and mountains, among which Byron first caught the\r\nenthusiasm of song; the green vallies and brown heaths where Scott\r\nlearnt to tell of Flodden field, and deeds of other days, in verse,\r\nlasting as the source of the deep Niagara, yet return an echo to the\r\nwell-known “Daintie Davie” of Robert Burns.\r\n\r\n    As down the burn they took their way,\r\n      And through the flowery dale,\r\n    His cheek to hers he aft did lay,\r\n      And love was aye the tale.\r\n\r\n    With “Mary, when shall we return,\r\n      Sic pleasure to renew?”\r\n    Quoth Mary, “Love, I like the burn,\r\n      And aye shall follow you.”\r\n\r\nHow I should delight to hear such an artless tale sung on the braes of\r\nQueenston, or the green knowes and fertile plains around Ancaster.\r\n\r\nI once in Montreal heard a gentleman from little York (a native of\r\nPerthshire) sing “Daintie Davie” in fine style; but it was the old set,\r\nand as it is a very good song, I think the first stanza and chorus may\r\n“drive dull care away” from half a dozen of my readers as well as a good\r\nhit at that silly body, our _sapient_ attorney-general, or a squib at\r\nhis forkhead Mr. Solicitor, would have done:--\r\n\r\n    “Now rosy May comes in wi’ flowers\r\n    To deck her gay green spreading bowers,\r\n    And now comes in my happy hours,\r\n      To wander wi’ my Davie.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus._\r\n\r\n    “Meet me on the warlock knowe,\r\n      Daintie Davie, Daintie Davie,\r\n    There I’ll spend the day with you,\r\n      My ain dear Daintie Davie.”\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, I wrote to a correspondent in Scotland, to send to\r\nDundas about ten reams of our best Scottish, English, and Irish ballads,\r\nand to avoid any that were exceptionable in point of morality. This\r\nperson has since arrived in America; but his ideas on the propriety of\r\nintroducing ballads into a new country, I found to be different from\r\nmine--otherwise I had by this time employed several “wights of Homer’s\r\ncraft” to disperse the twenty thousand halfpenny songs I then ordered.\r\nIt would have, perhaps, sown the seeds of music in our land, and\r\nhundreds of American presses, may be, would have spread abundantly the\r\npleasing stanzas, until accursed slavery had stopt the strain in the\r\nsouthern regions of republican tyranny.\r\n\r\nI can call to mind the time, as well as if it were yesterday, when I\r\nfirst heard “The Maid of Lodi:” it was at a Scottish wedding, at\r\nArthurstone. Sir Ewan, the aged sire of the brave colonel Cameron, who\r\nfell at Waterloo, was present with his lady; and, gentle reader, I think\r\nit was the youthful minister of the next parish who sung, accompanied by\r\nthe bride’s youngest sister. It was followed by “Blythe, blythe,” which\r\nI must give the reader from memory. News is scarce this week--the king\r\nof France is dead, and surely the tidings of the next’s coronation will\r\nnot arrive in time to fill a paragraph in the “Advocate” for a month to\r\ncome--so let us have--\r\n\r\n    _Blythe, blythe and merry was she:\r\n      Blythe was she but and ben;\r\n    Blythe by the banks of Ern--\r\n      Blythe in Glenturret glen._\r\n\r\n    By Aughtertye grows the aik,\r\n      By Yarrow banks the birken shaw;\r\n    But Phemie was the bonniest lass\r\n      The flowers of Yarrow ever saw.\r\n        Blythe, blythe, &c.\r\n\r\n    Her looks were like a flower in May,\r\n      Her smile was like a simmer morn;\r\n    She tripped by the banks of Ern,\r\n      As light’s a bird upon a thorn.\r\n        Blythe, blythe, &c.\r\n\r\n    Her bonnie face it was sae maek\r\n      As ony lamb upon a lee:\r\n    The evening sun was ne’er so sweet\r\n      As was the blink o’ Phemie’s e’e\r\n        Blythe, blythe, &c.\r\n\r\n    The highland hills I’ve wander’d wide,\r\n      And o’er the lowlands I hae been;\r\n    But Phemie was the bonniest lass\r\n      That ever trode the dewy green\r\n        Blythe, blythe, &c.\r\n\r\nA young farmer then gave us “The Lothian Lassie;” and as my recollection\r\nis pretty good, I shall put Canadian Scots girls in the way to mind it\r\nas well as me, by repeating the first stanza: would I could sing it as I\r\nhave heard it sung:--\r\n\r\n    Last May a braw wooer cam’d down the lang glen,\r\n      And sair wi’ his love he did deave me;\r\n    I said there was naething I hated like men,\r\n      The deuce gae wi’ ’m to believe me, believe me,\r\n      The deuce gae wi’ ’m to believe me.\r\n\r\nWhat a chaste pleasure--what a gladdening influence over the most\r\nstoical mind, any of the following songs yield, when well sung to their\r\nown tunes, by a half dozen young ladies in the parlour, or by a chorus\r\nof bonnie lassies in the kitchen, as the former pursue their sewing and\r\nknitting, and the latter birr their wheels, and stir the sowens in an\r\nevening, in the opulent farmer’s dwelling; or when heard in the most\r\nhumble cottage of a Scottish peasant. Well might the farmer’s dog,\r\nLuath, say, “And I for e’en down joy hae barkit wi’ them.”\r\n\r\nLet these classes come to Upper Canada to-morrow, and they will tire of\r\nits dulness. Nature’s face is fair enough; but after the traveller\r\nleaves the last faint sounds of the Canadian boatsman’s song, as it dies\r\non the still waters of the St. Lawrence, music will be done with.--I had\r\nforgotten however, I must now quote the songs alluded to; and I well can\r\nfrom memory:--\r\n\r\n   1. Gloomy winter’s now awa’.\r\n\r\n   2. Roy’s wife of Aldivalloch.\r\n\r\n   3. Beneath the pretty hawthorn that blooms in the vale.\r\n\r\n   4. And she showed him the way for to woo.\r\n\r\n   5. I gaed a waefu’ gate yestreen.\r\n\r\n   6. John Anderson, my Joe, John, when we were first acquent.\r\n\r\n   7. Thy cheek is o’ the rose’s hue,\r\n      My only joe and dearie, O.\r\n\r\n   8. Coming o’er the craigs o’ Kyle.\r\n\r\n   9. O, lassie, art thou sleeping yet;--and the answer.\r\n\r\n  10. There’s nae luck about the house,\r\n      There’s nae luck ava’;\r\n      There’s little pleasure in the house,\r\n      When our gudeman’s awa’.\r\n\r\n  11. The sun had gone down o’er the lofty Ben Lomond.\r\n\r\n  12. My uncle’s dead--I’ve lands enew.\r\n\r\n  13. For lack of gold she’s left me, O.\r\n\r\n  14. O’ a the airths the wind can blaw.\r\n\r\n  15. When honey-dyed bells o’er the heather was spreading.\r\n\r\n  16. Loudon’s bonny woods and braes.\r\n\r\n  17. The Highland Laddie.\r\n\r\n  18. Upon a simmer’s afternoon.\r\n      Awee afore the sun gaed down.\r\n\r\n  19. There’s cauld kail in Aberdeen, the new way.\r\n\r\n  20. Mirk and rainy was the night.\r\n\r\n  21. My Pattie is a lover gay.\r\n\r\n  22. I’m wearin’ awa’, Jean,\r\n      Like sna’ when its thaw, Jean.\r\n\r\n  23. Its Logie o’ Buchan, o’ Logie the laird.\r\n\r\n  24. With the garb of old Gaul, and the fire of old Rome.\r\n\r\n  25. Come under my plaide.\r\n\r\n  26. O’ Bessie Bell and Mary Gray.\r\n\r\n  27. Ye banks and braes of bonny Doon.\r\n\r\n  28. The laird of the drum, a wooing has gone,--\r\n      And awa’ in the morning early:\r\n      And he has spied a weel fa’red May,\r\n      A shearing her father’s barley.\r\n\r\n  29. My bonny Lizzie Baillie.\r\n\r\n  30. Green grow the rushes, O!\r\n\r\nI must have done--I have named so many songs to put my readers in mind\r\nof\r\n\r\n    “Auld lang syne;”\r\n\r\nand I could add as many more, of truly Scottish origin, that I should\r\nlike to see in Canada, as would fill up the “Advocate;” but I must\r\nstop--the politicians would complain. I have heard a few of these well\r\nsung in Canada--the last, a lintie in Queenston braes sings now and\r\nthen. Would there were ten thousand such in Upper Canada!\r\n\r\nThe English version of the following line, is not near so pretty as the\r\nScots original, which goes thus:--\r\n\r\n    “I once was a bachelor, both early and young,\r\n    And I courted a fair maid with a flattering tongue:\r\n    I courted her, I wooed her, I honoured her then,\r\n    And I promised to marry her, but never told her when.\r\n            O, I never told her when,” &c.\r\n\r\nWith this may be contrasted a verse of sir Walter Scott’s Mary, in “The\r\nPirate:”--\r\n\r\n    “O were there an island,\r\n      Though ever so wild,\r\n    Where woman could smile, and\r\n      No man be beguiled--\r\n    Too tempting a snare\r\n      To poor mortals were given,\r\n    And the hope would fix there,\r\n      That should anchor on heaven.”\r\n\r\nThis is beguiling on both sides; but the latter stanzas finely express\r\nan idea fit for an oriental paradise.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of ballads which, though akin to those I have\r\nnamed, are in many points essentially different:--and the first of this\r\nclass,\r\n\r\n    “Duncan Gray came here to woo,”\r\n\r\nwhen sung in chorus, would be almost enough to cause the venerable age\r\nof eighty-eight to shake a foot all over Scotland. A merry party, of\r\nwhich I was one, once tried “Duncan,” on the Table Rock at Niagara\r\nFalls; and when we came to that line, where the poor neglected lover\r\n\r\n    “Spak o’ loupin ower a linn,”\r\n\r\nI thought we should have all died with laughing, the scene was so in\r\nunison with the stanza. Moore’s two lovers, who--\r\n\r\n             “’thout pistol or dagger, a\r\n    Made a desperate dash down the Falls of Niagara,”\r\n\r\nis good; but it is nothing to “Duncan Gray,” sung by half a dozen tenor\r\nvoices on the Table Rock.\r\n\r\nI mean, when I have leisure, to continue these reminiscences of Scottish\r\nsong, and as I at this time must have taxed the patience, and tried the\r\npoliteness of my numerous Irish and English readers, I will, in some\r\nfuture number, leave Ramsay, Burns, Tannahill, and Ferguson--for Chaucer\r\nand Shakspeare, Goldsmith and Moore.\r\n\r\nTannahill has some pieces, scarce excelled by any of our Scottish\r\npoets--he has also a virtue which endears him to me beyond even Robert\r\nBurns. He does not often laud in song the drinking of ardent liquors.\r\nIf, as a printer, I were to publish an American edition of Burns, I\r\nthink I would leave his songs in praise of Highland whisky out. They\r\nhave done much harm in his native land; and to spread them here, would\r\nbe like firing a match.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF MAY\r\n\r\nThis month may close with a delightful sonnet, from one of the best\r\nbooks put forth in recent years for daily use and amusement.\r\n\r\nSUMMER.\r\n\r\n    Now have young April and the blue eyed May\r\n      Vanished awhile, and lo! the glorious June\r\n      (While nature ripens in his burning noon,)\r\n    Comes like a young inheritor; and gay,\r\n    Altho’ his parent months have passed away;\r\n      But his green crown shall wither, and the tune\r\n      That ushered in his birth be silent soon,\r\n    And in the strength of youth shall he decay.\r\n    What matters this--so long as in the past\r\n      And in the days to come we live, and feel\r\n      The present nothing worth, until it steal\r\n        Away and, like a disappointment, die?\r\n        For Joy, dim child of Hope and Memory,\r\n    Flies ever on before or follows fast.\r\n\r\n  _Literary Pocket Book_\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 57·97.\r\n\r\n  [192] Milner’s Hist. of Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The shepherds, now, from every walk and steep,\r\n    Where grateful feed attracts the dainty sheep,\r\n    Collect their flocks, and plunge them in the streams\r\n    And cleanse their fleeces in the noontide beams.\r\n    This care perform’d, arrives another care\r\n    To catch them, one by one, their wool to shear:\r\n    Then come the tying, clipping, tarring, bleating;\r\n    The shearers’ final shout, and dance, and eating.\r\n    From hence the old engravers sometimes made\r\n    This lovely month a shearer, at his trade:\r\n    And hence, the symbol to the season true,\r\n    A living hand so traces June to you.\r\n\r\nThe “Mirror of the Months,” the pleasantest of “the year-books,” except\r\n“The Months” of Mr. Leigh Hunt, tells us that with June,--“Summer is\r\ncome--come, but not to stay; at least, not at the commencement of this\r\nmonth: and how should it, unless we expect that the seasons will be kind\r\nenough to conform to the devices of man, and suffer themselves to be\r\ncalled by what name and at what period _he_ pleases? He must die and\r\nleave them a legacy (instead of they him) before there will be any show\r\nof justice in this. Till then the beginning of June will continue to be\r\nthe latter end of May, by rights; as it was according to the _old\r\nstyle_. And, among a thousand changes, in what one has the old style\r\nbeen improved upon by the new? Assuredly not in that of substituting the\r\n_utile_ for the _dulce_, in any eyes but those of almanac-makers. Let\r\nall lovers of spring, therefore, be fully persuaded that, for the first\r\nfortnight in June, they are living in May. We are to bear in mind that\r\nall shall thus be gaining instead of losing, by the impertinence of any\r\nbreath, but that of heaven, attempting to force spring into summer, even\r\nin name alone.”\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting thus to introduce the following passages, and invite\r\nthe reader to proceed with the author, and take a bird’s eye view of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpring may now be considered as employed in completing her toilet, and,\r\nfor the first weeks of this month, putting on those last finishing\r\ntouches which an accomplished beauty never trusts to any hand but her\r\nown. In the woods and groves also, she is still clothing some of her\r\nnoblest and proudest attendants with their new annual attire. The oak\r\nuntil now has been nearly bare; and, of whatever age, has been looking\r\nold all the winter and spring, on account of its crumpled branches and\r\nwrinkled rind. Now, of whatever age, it looks young, in virtue of its\r\nnew green, lighter than all the rest of the grove. Now, also, the\r\nstately walnut (standing singly or in pairs in the fore-court of ancient\r\nmanor-houses, or in the home corner of the pretty park-like paddock at\r\nthe back of some modern Italian villa, whose white dome it saw rise\r\nbeneath it the other day, and mistakes for a mushroom,) puts forth its\r\nsmooth leaves slowly, as “sage grave men” do their thoughts; and which\r\nover-caution reconciles one to the beating it receives in the autumn,\r\nas the best means of at once compassing its present fruit, and making it\r\nbear more; as its said prototypes in animated nature are obliged to have\r\ntheir brains cudgelled, before any good can be got from them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese appearances appertain exclusively to the spring. Let us now\r\n(however reluctantly) take a final leave of that lovely and love-making\r\nseason, and at once step forward into the glowing presence of\r\nsummer--contenting ourselves, however, to touch the hem of her rich\r\ngarments, and not attempting to look into her heart, till she lays that\r\nopen to us herself next month: for whatever schoolboys calendar-makers\r\nmay say to the contrary, Midsummer never happens in England till July.\r\n\r\nTo saunter, at mid June, beneath the shade of some old forest, situated\r\nin the neighbourhood of a great town, so that paths are worn through it,\r\nand you can make your way with ease in any direction, gives one the idea\r\nof being transferred, by some strange magic, from the surface of the\r\nearth to the bottom of the sea! (I say it gives one this idea; for I\r\ncannot answer for more, in matters of so arbitrary a nature as the\r\nassociation of ideas.) Over head, and round about, you hear the sighing,\r\nthe whispering, or the roaring (as the wind pleases) of a thousand\r\nbillows; and looking upwards, you see the light of heaven transmitted\r\nfaintly, as if through a mass of green waters. Hither and thither, as\r\nyou move along, strange forms flit swiftly about you, which may, for any\r\nthing you can see or hear to the contrary, be exclusive natives of the\r\nnew world in which your fancy chooses to find itself: they may be\r\n_fishes_, if that pleases; for they are as mute as such, and glide\r\nthrough the liquid element as swiftly. Now and then, indeed, one of\r\nlarger growth, and less lubricated movements, lumbers up from beside\r\nyour path, and cluttering noisily away to a little distance, may chance\r\nto scare for a moment your submarine reverie. Your palate too may\r\nperhaps here step in, and try to persuade you that the cause of\r\ninterruption was not a fish but a pheasant. But in fact, if your fancy\r\nis one of those which are disposed to “listen to reason,” it will not be\r\nable to lead you into spots of the above kind without your gun in your\r\nhand,--one report of which will put all fancies to flight in a moment,\r\nas well as every thing else that has wings. To return, therefore, to\r\nour walk,--what do all these strange objects look like, that stand\r\nsilently about us in the dim twilight, some spiring straight up, and\r\ntapering as they ascend, till they lose themselves in the green waters\r\nabove--some shattered and splintered, leaning against each other for\r\nsupport, or lying heavily on the floor on which we walk--some half\r\nburied in that floor, as if they had lain dead there for ages, and\r\nbecome incorporate with it? what do all these seem, but wrecks and\r\nfragments of some mighty vessel, that has sunk down here from above, and\r\nlain weltering and wasting away, till these are all that is left of it!\r\nEven the floor itself on which we stand, and the vegetation it puts\r\nforth, are unlike those of any other portion of the earth’s surface, and\r\nmay well recall, by their strange appearance in the half light, the\r\nfancies that have come upon us when we have read or dreamt of those\r\ngifted beings, who, like Ladurlad in Kehama, could walk on the floor of\r\nthe sea, without waiting, as the visiters at watering-places are obliged\r\nto do, for the tide to go out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStepping forth into the open fields, what a bright pageant of summer\r\nbeauty is spread out before us!--Everywhere about our feet flocks of\r\nwild-flowers\r\n\r\n    “Do paint the meadow with delight.”\r\n\r\nWe must not stay to pluck and particularize them; for most of them have\r\nalready had their greeting--let us pass along beside this flourishing\r\nhedge-row. The first novelty of the season that greets us here is\r\nperhaps the sweetest, the freshest, and fairest of all, and the only one\r\nthat could supply an adequate substitute for the hawthorn bloom which it\r\nhas superseded. Need the eglantine be named? the “sweet-leaved\r\neglantine;” the “rain-scented eglantine;” eglantine--to which the sun\r\nhimself pays homage, by “counting his dewy rosary” on it every morning;\r\neglantine--which Chaucer, and even Shakspeare--but hold--whatsoever the\r\npoets themselves may insinuate to the contrary, to read poetry in the\r\npresence of nature is a kind of impiety: it is like reading the\r\ncommentators on Shakspeare, and skipping the text; for you cannot attend\r\nto both: to say nothing of nature’s book being a _vade mecum_ that can\r\nmake “every man his own poet” for the time being; and there is, after\r\nall, no poetry like that which we create for ourselves.\r\n\r\nBegging pardon of the eglantine for having permitted any thing--even her\r\nown likeness in the poet’s looking-glass--to turn our attention from her\r\nreal self,--look with what infinite grace she scatters her sweet\r\ncoronals here and there among her bending branches; or hangs them,\r\nhalf-concealed, among the heavy blossoms of the woodbine that lifts\r\nitself so boldly above her, after having first clung to _her_ for\r\nsupport; or permits them to peep out here and there close to the ground,\r\nand almost hidden by the rank weeds below; or holds out a whole archway\r\nof them, swaying backward and forward in the breeze, as if praying of\r\nthe passer’s hand to pluck them. Let who will praise the hawthorn--now\r\nit is no more! The wild rose is the queen of forest flowers, if it be\r\nonly because she is as unlike a queen as the absence of every thing\r\ncourtly can make her.\r\n\r\nThe woodbine deserves to be held next in favour during this month;\r\nthough more on account of its _intellectual_ than its personal beauty.\r\nAll the air is faint with its rich sweetness; and the delicate breath of\r\nits lovely rival is lost in the luscious odours which it exhales.\r\n\r\nThese are the only _scented_ wild flowers that we shall now meet with in\r\nany profusion; for though the violet may still be found by looking for,\r\nits breath has lost much of its spring power. But, if we are content\r\nwith mere beauty, this month is perhaps more profuse of it than any\r\nother, even in that department of nature which we are now\r\nexamining--namely, the fields and woods.\r\n\r\nThe woods and groves, and the single forest trees that rise here and\r\nthere from out the bounding hedge-rows, are now in full foliage; all,\r\nhowever, presenting a somewhat sombre, because monotonous, hue, wanting\r\nall the tender newness of the spring, and all the rich variety of the\r\nautumn. And this is the more observable, because the numerous plots of\r\ncultivated land, divided from each other by the hedge-rows, and looking,\r\nat this distance, like beds in a garden divided by box, are nearly all\r\nstill invested with the same green mantle; for the wheat, the oats, the\r\nbarley, and even the early rye, though now in full flower, have not yet\r\nbecome tinged with their harvest hues. They are all alike green; and the\r\nonly change that can be seen in their appearance is that caused by the\r\ndifferent lights into which each is thrown, as the wind passes over\r\nthem. The patches of purple or of white clover that intervene here and\r\nthere, and are now in flower, offer striking exceptions to the above,\r\nand at the same time load the air with their sweetness. Nothing ran be\r\nmore rich and beautiful in its effect on a distant prospect at this\r\nseason, than a great patch of purple clover lying apparently motionless\r\non a sunny upland, encompassed by a whole sea of green corn, waving and\r\nshifting about it at every breath that blows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hitherto full concert of the singing birds is now beginning to\r\nfalter, and fall short. We shall do well to make the most of it now; for\r\nin two or three weeks it will almost entirely cease till the autumn. I\r\nmean that it will cease as a full concert; for we shall have single\r\nsongsters all through the summer at intervals; and those some of the\r\nsweetest and best. The best of all, indeed, the nightingale, we have now\r\nlost. So that the youths and maidens who now go in pairs to the\r\nwood-side, on warm nights, to listen for its song, (hoping they may\r\n_not_ hear it,) are well content to hear each other’s voice instead.\r\n\r\nWe have still, however, some of the finest of the second class of\r\nsongsters left; for the nightingale, like Catalani, is a class by\r\nitself. The mere chorus-singers of the grove are also beginning to be\r\nsilent; so that the _jubilate_ that has been chanting for the last month\r\nis now over. But the Stephenses, the Trees, the Patons, and the Poveys,\r\nare still with us, under the forms of the woodlark, the skylark, the\r\nblackcap, and the goldfinch. And the first-named of these, now that it\r\nno longer fears the rivalry of the unrivalled, not seldom, on warm\r\nnights, sings at intervals all night long, poised at one spot high up in\r\nthe soft moonlit air.\r\n\r\nWe have still another pleasant little singer, the field cricket, whose\r\nclear shrill voice the warm weather has now matured to its full\r\nstrength, and who must not be forgotten, though he has but one song to\r\noffer us all his life long, and that one consisting but of one note; for\r\nit is a note of joy, and _will_ not be heard without engendering its\r\nlike. You may hear him in wayside banks, where the sun falls hot,\r\nshrilling out his loud cry into the still air all day long, as he sits\r\nat the mouth of his cell; and if you chance to be passing by the same\r\nspot at midnight, you may hear it then too.[193]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet by him who holds this “Mirror,” we must not be “charmed” from our\r\nrepose, but take the advice of a poet, the contemporary and friend of\r\nCowper.\r\n\r\n    Let us not borrow from the hours of rest,\r\n    For we must steal from morning to repay.\r\n    And who would lose the animated smile\r\n    Of dawning day, for the austere frown of night?\r\n    I grant her well accoutred in her suit\r\n    Of dripping sable, powder’d thick with stars,\r\n    And much applaud her as she passes by\r\n    With a replenish’d horn on either brow!\r\n    But more I love to see awaking day\r\n    Rise with a fluster’d cheek; a careful maid,\r\n    Who fears she has outslept the custom’d hour,\r\n    And leaves her chamber blushing. Hence to rest;\r\n    I will not prattle longer to detain you\r\n    Under the dewy canopy of night.\r\n\r\n  _Hurdis._\r\n\r\n  [193] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 1.~\r\n\r\nOvid assigns the first of June to “Carna,” _the goddess of the hinge_;\r\nwho also presided over the vital parts of man, especially the liver and\r\nthe heart. Massey, commenting on his taste, cannot divine the\r\nconnection between such a power and the patronage of _hinges_. “False\r\nnotions,” he says, “in every mode of religion, lead men naturally into\r\nconfusion.”\r\n\r\n    Carna, the goddess of the hinge, demands\r\n    _The first of June_; upon her power depends\r\n    To open what is shut, what’s shut unbar;\r\n    And whence this power she has, my muse declare\r\n    For length of time has made the thing obscure,\r\n    Fame only tells us that she has that power.\r\n    Helernus’ grove near to the Tiber lies,\r\n    Where still the priests repair to sacrifice;\r\n    From hence a nymph, whose name was Granè, sprung,\r\n    Whom many, unsuccessful, courted long;\r\n    To range the spacious fields, and kill the deer,\r\n    With darts and mangling spears, was all her care;\r\n    She had no quiver, yet so bright she seemed,\r\n    She was by many Phœbus’ sister deemed.\r\n\r\n  _Ovid._\r\n\r\n  The poet then relates that Janos made this Granè (or Carna) _goddess\r\n  of the hinge_;\r\n\r\n    And then a white thorn stick he to her gave,\r\n    By which she ever after power should have,\r\n    To drive by night all om’nous birds away,\r\n    That scream, and o’er our houses hov’ring stray.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 57·05.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 2.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROGUE IN GRAIN, _June 2, 1759_.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Newark, Notts, May 17, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--It appears to me that there have been in “old times,” which we\r\nsuppose “good times,” rogues in grain.

Hans was the author of a celebrated\r\nwork, published in 1729, on the topography and natural history of that\r\ncountry. Paul conducted a new edition of his father’s book, and\r\npublished a journal of his own residence in Greenland, from 1721 to\r\n1788. He died at the age of eighty-one.[195]\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS INSCRIPTION, _Discovered by a Traveller_.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bart, grandson of the renowned Jean Bart, during his stay at\r\nMalta, where he had put in from a cruise in the Mediterranean, met with\r\na Carmelite, who had been into Persia as a missionary. This person told\r\nhim he had availed himself of an opportunity which offered to gratify\r\nhis curiosity, by visiting the ruins of the ancient and celebrated\r\nPersepolis. Chance discovered to him a marble, on which were inscribed\r\nsome Arabic characters. As he was acquainted with this language, he\r\ntranslated the inscription into Latin. The following is the\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |   dicas   |   scis   |  dicit   |   scit   |  audit   | expedit  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  facias   |  potes   |  facit   |  potest  |  facit   |  credit  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  credas   |  audis   |  credit  |  audit   |  credit  |  fieri   |\r\n  |           |          |          |          |          |  potest  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  | expendas  |  habes   | expendit |  habet   |  petit   |   habet  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |  judices  |  vides   | judicat  |  videt   | judicat  |   est    |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |    non    |   quod   | nam qui  |   quod   |   sæpe   |   quod   |\r\n  |           |  cumque  |          |  cumque  |          |    non   |\r\n  +-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe key is to be obtained thus; the first word of the last line must be\r\ntaken and joined to the first word of the first line; then the second\r\nword of the last line to the second word of the first line, and so on to\r\nthe end. Afterwards, we must begin again by taking the first word of the\r\nnext line, and the following moral precepts will be the result:\r\n\r\n1. Non dicas quodcumque scis, nam qui dicit quodcumque scit sæpe audit\r\nquod non expedit.\r\n\r\nDo not tell whatever thou knowest, for he who tells whatever he knows,\r\noften hears more than is agreeable.\r\n\r\n2. Non facias quodcumque potes, nam qui facit, quodcumque potest sæpe\r\nfacit quod non credit.\r\n\r\nDo not do whatever thou canst, for he who does whatever he can, often\r\ndoes more than he imagines.\r\n\r\n3. Non credas quodcumque audis, nam qui credit quodcumque audit sæpe\r\nquod non fieri potest.\r\n\r\nDo not believe whatever thou hearest, for he who believes whatever he\r\nhears, will often believe what is impossible.\r\n\r\n4. Non expendas quodcumque habes, nam qui expendit quodcumque habet sæpe\r\npetit quod non habet.\r\n\r\nDo not spend whatever thou hast, for he who spends whatever he has, will\r\noften be compelled to ask for what he has not.\r\n\r\n5. Non judices quodcumque vides, nam qui judicat quodcumque videt sæpe\r\njudicat quod non est.\r\n\r\nDo not judge on whatever thou seest, for he who judges on whatever he\r\nsees, will often form an erroneous judgment.[196]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 3, 1611. “THE LADY ARABELLA” ESCAPED FROM HER CONFINEMENT.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Kennington, May 23, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,---Annexed is an original unprinted letter, from the lady Arabella\r\nSeymour, whose misfortunes were of a peculiar kind, and from peculiar\r\ncauses; those causes are to be traced to that tyrannic dread that weak\r\nsovereigns always have of any persons approaching their equals, either\r\nin mind, or by family ties.

She was born about the year 1578, and brought up\r\nin privacy, under the care of her grandmother, the old countess of\r\nLennox, who, for many years, resided in England. Her double relation to\r\nroyalty was obnoxious to the jealousy of queen Elizabeth, and the\r\ntimidity of king James I., who equally dreaded her having legitimate\r\nissue, and restrained her from allying herself in a suitable manner.\r\nElizabeth prevented her from marrying Esme Stuart, her kinsman, and heir\r\nto the titles and estates of her family, and afterwards imprisoned her\r\nfor listening to some overtures from the son of the earl of\r\nNorthumberland. James, by obliging her to reject many splendid offers of\r\nmarriage, unwarily encouraged the hopes of inferior pretenders, among\r\nwhom, says Mr. Lodge, was the fantastical William Fowler, secretary to\r\nAnne of Denmark. Thus circumscribed, she renewed a connection with\r\nWilliam Seymour, grandson to the earl of Hertford, which, being\r\ndiscovered in 1609, both parties were summoned to appear before the\r\nprivy council, where they received a severe reprimand. This mode of\r\nproceeding produced the very consequence which the king meant to avoid;\r\nfor the lady, sensible that her reputation had been wounded by the\r\ninquiry, was in a manner forced into a marriage, which becoming publicly\r\nknown, she was committed to close custody, in the house of sir Thomas\r\nParry, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, at Vauxhall, and her\r\nhusband, Mr. Seymour, sent to the Tower. In this state of separation,\r\nhowever, they concerted means for an escape, which both effected on the\r\nsame day, _June 3, 1611_. Seymour got safely to Flanders; but his poor\r\nwife was retaken in Calais roads, and brought back to the former prison\r\nof her husband, the Tower, where the sense of these undeserved\r\noppressions operating severely on her high spirit, she became a lunatic,\r\nand languished in that wretched state, augmented by the horrors of a\r\nprison, till her death, which occurred on the 27th of September, 1615.\r\nThus ends the eventful story of poor Arabella, a woman, (if we may\r\ncredit her portrait, prefixed to Lodge’s third volume of “Illustrations\r\nof British History,”) of commanding and elegant appearance, and\r\nundoubtedly of a firm and vigorous mind; and it is well observed by that\r\nauthor, that “had the life of Arabella Stuart been marked by the same\r\ncriminal extravagancies, as well as distinguished by similar misfortunes\r\nand persecutions, her character would have stood at least as forward on\r\nthe page of history as that of her royal aunt, Mary of Scotland.” The\r\nabove letter was, probably, written from the Tower, though, I am sorry\r\nto say, there is neither direction nor superscription, and, therefore,\r\nto whom can be only matter of surmise.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  ~A.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVES OF “THE LADY ARABELLA.”\r\n\r\nFrom an article in the “Curiosities of Literature,” illustrations may be\r\nderived to the article of our correspondent ~A.~ “The whole life of this\r\nlady seems to consist of secret history, which, probably, we cannot now\r\nrecover:--her name scarcely ever occurs without raising that sort of\r\ninterest which accompanies mysterious events.” She is reputed to have\r\nbeen learned, and of a poetical genius; yet of her poetry there are no\r\nspecimens, and her erudition rests on Evelyn’s bare mention of her name\r\nin his list of learned women.\r\n\r\nOn the death of queen Elizabeth, the pope conceived the notion of\r\nrestoring the papacy in England, by uniting the lady Arabella to an\r\nItalian cardinal, of illegitimate descent from our Edward IV. His\r\nholiness presumed if he qualified the cardinal for marriage, by\r\ndepriving him from the priesthood, the junction of Arabella’s\r\nrelationship to Henry VII., with the churchman’s “natural” pretensions,\r\nmight secure the crown! Her attachment to the catholic religion is\r\ndoubtful. Perhaps her disposition was rightly estimated by father\r\nParsons: he imagined “her religion to be as tender, green, and flexible,\r\nas is her age and sex; and to be wrought hereafter, and settled\r\naccording to future events and times.” The pope’s plot failed. Winwood\r\nsays, “the lady Arabella hath not been found inclinable to popery.” He\r\nwrote after the “future events,” contemplated by Parsons, had “wrought.”\r\n\r\nAnother project for making the lady Arabella queen was after the\r\nenthronement of James. The conspirators requested her by letter to\r\naddress herself to the king of Spain; she laughed at the letter and sent\r\nit to James, who, as regarded her, did not think of it more seriously,\r\nand so failed a second plot, wherein the name of the illustrious Raleigh\r\nwas implicated.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1604, there appears to have been a third design to make her\r\nqueen, though not of this country. The earl of Pembroke writes to the\r\nearl of Shrewsbury--“A great ambassador is coming from the king of\r\nPoland, whose chief errand is to demand my lady Arabella in marriage for\r\nhis master. So may your princess of the blood grow a great queen.” If\r\nthis was the object of the embassy, nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nBefore the death of queen Elizabeth, the marriage of the lady Arabella\r\nwith her kinsman lord Esme Stuart, whom he had created duke of Lennox,\r\nand designed for his heir, was proposed by James himself, but Elizabeth\r\n“forbad the bans” by imprisoning the proposed bride, who was suspected\r\nto have favoured a son of the earl of Northumberland, against whom\r\nElizabeth again interposed. She had other offers. “To the lady Arabella,\r\ncrowns and husbands were like a fairy banquet seen at moonlight, opening\r\non her sight, impalpable and vanishing at the moment of approach.”\r\n\r\nThe distresses of this unhappy creature were heightened by her\r\ndependence on the crown. She was the cousin of James, and it was his\r\nnarrow policy to constrain her from a match suitable to her rank, or\r\nperhaps to keep her single for life. Her supplies were unequal: at one\r\ntime she had a grant of the duty on oats; at length he assigned her a\r\npension of 1600_l._: but whenever he suspected a natural desire in her\r\nheart she was out of favour. No woman was ever more solicited to the\r\nconjugal state, or seems to have been so little averse to it. “Every\r\nnoble youth who sighed for distinction, ambitioned the notice of the\r\nlady Arabella.”\r\n\r\nHer renewal of an early attachment to Mr. William Seymour, second son of\r\nlord Beauchamp, and grandson of the earl of Hertford, forms a story\r\nwhich “for its misery, its pathos, and its terror, even romantic fiction\r\nhas not executed.” It was detected, and the lady Arabella and Seymour\r\nwere summoned before the privy council, where Seymour was “censured for\r\nseeking to ally himself with the royal blood, although that blood was\r\nrunning in his own veins.” In his answer, “he conceived that this noble\r\nlady might, without offence, make the choice of any subject within this\r\nkingdom.” He says, “I boldly intruded myself into her ladyship’s\r\nchamber, in the court, on Candlemass day last, at what time I imparted\r\nmy desire unto her, which was entertained; but with this caution on\r\neither part, that both of us resolved not to proceed to any final\r\nconclusion without his majesty’s most gracious favour first obtained:\r\nand this was our first meeting.” The lovers gravely promised to suppress\r\ntheir affections, with what sincerity is not known, for they married\r\nsecretly; and in July the lady Arabella was arrested, and confined at\r\nthe house of sir Thomas Parry, at Lambeth, and Seymour committed to the\r\nTower, “for contempt in marrying a lady of the royal family without the\r\nking’s leave.”\r\n\r\nArabella wrote a letter to the king, which was “often read without\r\noffence, nay, it was even commended by his highness, with the applause\r\nof prince and council.” She adverted to her wrongs, and required justice\r\nwith a noble fortitude, though in respectful terms. She says, “I do most\r\nheartily lament my hard fortune, that I should offend your majesty the\r\nleast, especially in that whereby I have long desired to merit of your\r\nmajesty, as appeared before your majesty was my sovereign: and though\r\n_your majesty’s neglect of me_, my good liking to this gentleman that is\r\nmy husband, and my fortune, drew me to a contract before I acquainted\r\nyour majesty, I humbly beseech your majesty to consider how impossible\r\nit was for me to imagine it could be offensive to your majesty, having\r\n_few days before given me your royal consent to bestow myself on any\r\nsubject of your majesty’s_ (which likewise your majesty had done long\r\nsince). Besides, never having been either prohibited any, or spoken to\r\nfor any, in this land, by your majesty _these seven years_ that I have\r\nlived in your majesty’s house, I could not conceive that your majesty\r\nregarded my marriage at all; whereas if your majesty had vouchsafed to\r\ntell me your mind, and accept the free-will offering of my obedience, I\r\nwould not have offended your majesty, of whose gracious goodness I\r\npresume so much, that _if it were now as convenient in a worldly\r\nrespect, as malice may make it seem, to separate us, whom God hath\r\njoined_, your majesty would not do evil that good might come thereof,\r\nnor make me, that have the honour to be so near your majesty in blood,\r\nthe first precedent that ever was, though our princes may have left some\r\nas little imitable, for so good and gracious a king as your majesty, as\r\nDavid’s dealing with Uriah.”\r\n\r\nShe moved the queen, through lady Jane Drummond, to interest James in\r\nher favour. A letter from lady Jane communicates his majesty’s coarse\r\nand conceited reply, and she concludes by frankly telling the captive\r\nwife, “the wisdom of this state, with the example how some of your\r\nquality in the like case has been used, makes me fear that ye shall not\r\nfind so easy end to your troubles as ye expect or I wish.”\r\n\r\nTo lady Drummond’s prophetic intimation, Arabella answers by sending the\r\nqueen a pair of gloves “in remembrance of the poor prisoner that wrought\r\nthem, in hopes her royal hands will vouchsafe to wear them:” and she\r\nadds, that her case “could be compared to no other she ever heard of,\r\n_resembling no other_.” She contrived to correspond with Seymour, but\r\ntheir letters were discovered, and the king resolved to change her place\r\nof confinement.\r\n\r\nJames appointed the bishop of Durham to be his jailor on the occasion.\r\n“Lady Arabella was so subdued at this distant separation, that she gave\r\nway to all the wildness of despair; she fell suddenly ill, and could not\r\ntravel but in a litter, and with a physician. In her way to Durham, she\r\nwas so greatly disquieted in the first few miles of her uneasy and\r\ntroublesome journey, that they would proceed no further than to\r\nHighgate. The physician returned to town to report her state, and\r\ndeclared that she was assuredly very weak, her pulse dull and\r\nmelancholy, and very irregular; her countenance very heavy, pale, and\r\nwan; and though free from fever, he declared her in no case fit for\r\ntravel. The king observed, ‘It is enough to make any sound man sick to\r\nbe carried in a bed in that manner she is; much more for her _whose\r\nimpatient and unquiet spirit heapeth upon herself far greater\r\nindisposition of body than otherwise she would have_.’ His resolution\r\nhowever was, that ‘she should proceed to Durham, _if he were king_!’ ‘We\r\nanswered,’ replied the doctor, ‘that we made no doubt of her\r\nobedience.’--‘Obedience is that required,’ replied the king, ‘which\r\nbeing performed, I will do more for her than she expected.’” Yet he\r\nconsented to her remaining a month at Highgate. As the day of her\r\ndeparture approached, she appeared resigned. “But Arabella had not,\r\nwithin, that tranquillity with which she had lulled her keepers. She and\r\nSeymour had concerted a flight, as bold in its plot, and as beautifully\r\nwild, as any recorded in romantic story. The day preceding her\r\ndeparture, Arabella found it not difficult to persuade a female\r\nattendant to consent that she would suffer her to pay a last visit to\r\nher husband, and to wait for her return at an appointed hour. More\r\nsolicitous for the happiness of lovers than for the repose of kings,\r\nthis attendant, in utter simplicity, or with generous sympathy, assisted\r\nthe lady Arabella in dressing her in one of the most elaborate\r\ndisguisings. ‘She drew a pair of large French-fashioned hose or trowsers\r\nover her petticoats; put on a man’s doublet or coat; a peruke, such as\r\nmen wore, whose long locks covered her own ringlets; a black hat, a\r\nblack cloak, russet boots with red tops, and a rapier by her side,’ Thus\r\naccoutred, the lady Arabella stole out with a gentleman about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon. She had only proceeded a mile and a half, when\r\nthey stopped at a poor inn, where one of her confederates was waiting\r\nwith horses, yet she was so sick and faint, that the ostler, who held\r\nher stirrup, observed, that ‘the gentleman could hardly hold out to\r\nLondon.’ She recruited her spirits by riding; the blood mantled in her\r\nface, and at six o’clock our sick lover reached Blackwall, where a boat\r\nand servants were waiting. The watermen were at first ordered to\r\nWoolwich; there they were desired to push on to Gravesend, then to\r\nTilbury, where, complaining of fatigue, they landed to refresh; but,\r\ntempted by their freight, they reached Lee. At the break of morn they\r\ndiscovered a French vessel riding there to receive the lady; but as\r\nSeymour had not yet arrived, Arabella was desirous to lie at anchor for\r\nher lord, conscious that he would not fail to his appointment. If he\r\nindeed had been prevented in his escape, she herself cared not to\r\npreserve the freedom she now possessed; but her attendants, aware of the\r\ndanger of being overtaken by a king’s ship, overruled her wishes, and\r\nhoisted sail, which occasioned so fatal a termination to this romantic\r\nadventure. Seymour indeed had escaped from the Tower; he had left his\r\nservant watching at his door to warn all visiters not to disturb his\r\nmaster, who lay ill with a raging toothache, while Seymour in disguise\r\nstole away alone, following a cart which had just brought wood to his\r\napartment. He passed the warders; he reached the wharf, and found his\r\nconfidential man waiting with a boat, and he arrived at Lee. The time\r\npressed; the waves were rising; Arabella was not there; but in the\r\ndistance he descried a vessel. Hiring a fisherman to take him on board,\r\nto his grief, on hailing it, he discovered that it was not the French\r\nvessel charged with his Arabella; in despair and confusion he found\r\nanother ship from Newcastle, which for a good sum altered its course,\r\nand landed him in Flanders.”\r\n\r\nOn the lady Arabella’s escape, “couriers were despatched swifter than\r\nthe winds wafted the unhappy Arabella, and all was hurry in the\r\nseaports. They sent to the Tower to warn the lieutenant to be doubly\r\nvigilant over Seymour, who, to his surprise, discovered that his\r\nprisoner had ceased to be so for several hours. James at first was for\r\nissuing a proclamation in a style so angry and vindictive, that it\r\nrequired the moderation of Cecil to preserve the dignity while he\r\nconcealed the terror of his majesty. By the admiral’s detail of his\r\nimpetuous movements, he seemed in pursuit of an enemy’s fleet; for the\r\ncourier is urged, and the postmasters are roused by a superscription,\r\nwhich warned them of the eventful despatch, ‘Haste, haste, post haste!\r\nHaste for your life, your life!’ To these words, in a letter from the\r\nearl of Essex to the lord high admiral at Plymouth, were added the\r\nexpressive symbol of _a gallows prepared with a halter_, thus\r\n\r\n  +--+--+\r\n  |  |  |\r\n  |  |  |\r\n  |  |  |.”\r\n  |     |\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, as is well expressed, that “the union and flight of\r\nthese two doves, from their cotes, shook with consternation the grey\r\nowls of the cabinet:” even “prince Henry partook of this cabinet panic.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile “we have left the lady Arabella alone and mournful on the\r\nseas, not praying for favourable gales to convey her away, but still\r\nimploring her attendants to linger for her Seymour; still straining her\r\nsight to the point of the horizon for some speck which might give a hope\r\nof the approach of the boat freighted with all her love. Alas! never\r\nmore was Arabella to cast a single look on her lover and her husband!\r\nShe was overtaken by a pink in the king’s service, in Calais roads; and\r\nnow she declared that she cared not to be brought back again to her\r\nimprisonment should Seymour escape, whose safety was dearest to her!”\r\n\r\n    Where London’s Tow’re its turrets show\r\n      So stately by the Thames’s side,\r\n    Fair Arabella, child of woe!\r\n      For many a day had sat and sighed.\r\n\r\n    And as shee heard the waves arise,\r\n      And as shee heard the bleake windes roare,\r\n    As fast did heave her heartfelte sighes,\r\n      And still so fast her teares did poure![197]\r\n\r\nDuring a confinement of four years the lady Arabella “sunk beneath the\r\nhopelessness of her situation, and a secret resolution in her mind to\r\nrefuse the aid of her physicians, and to wear away the faster, if she\r\ncould, the feeble remains of life.” The particulars of her “dreadful\r\nimprisonment” are unknown, but her letters show her affliction, and that\r\nshe often thought on suicide, and as often was prevented by religious\r\nfortitude. “I could not,” she says, “be so unchristian as to be the\r\ncause of my own death.”\r\n\r\nShe affectingly paints her situation in one of her addresses to James.\r\n“In all humility, the most wretched and unfortunate creature that ever\r\nlived, prostrates itselfe at the feet of the most merciful king that\r\never was, desiring nothing but mercy and favour, not being more\r\nafflicted for any thing than for the losse of that which hath binne this\r\nlong time the onely comfort it had in the world, and which, if it weare\r\nto do again, I would not adventure the losse of for any other worldly\r\ncomfort; _mercy_ it is I desire, and that for _God’s sake_!”\r\n\r\nShe “finally lost her reason,” and died in prison distracted. “Such is\r\nthe history of the lady Arabella. A writer of romance might render her\r\none of those interesting personages whose griefs have been deepened by\r\ntheir royalty, and whose adventures, touched with the warm hues of love\r\nand distraction, closed at the bars of her prison-grate--a sad example\r\nof a female victim to the state!\r\n\r\n    ‘Through one dim lattice, fring’d with ivy round,\r\n      Successive suns a languid radiance threw,\r\n    To paint how fierce her angry guardian frown’d,\r\n      To mark how fast her waning beauty flew!’”\r\n\r\nHer husband, Seymour, regained his liberty. Charles I. created him\r\nmarquis of Hertford; and, under Charles II., the dukedom of Somerset,\r\nwhich had been lost to his family by attainder for ancient defections,\r\nwas restored to it in his person. He “retained his romantic passion for\r\nthe lady of his first affections; for he called the daughter he had by\r\nhis second lady by the ever beloved name of ARABELLA STUART.”[198]\r\n\r\nNothing remains to mark the character of this noble-minded female, but\r\nthe scanty particulars from whence the present are gathered, with some\r\nletters and a few rhapsodies written while her heart was breaking, and\r\nher understanding perishing. At that period she wrote the letter here\r\nbrought to light towards gratifying a natural curiosity for every thing\r\nrelating to her character and person; with the same intent her\r\nhandwriting is faithfully traced, and subjoined from her subscription to\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY JANE DRUMMOND.\r\n\r\nThe lady Arabella’s suitor to her majesty lady Jane Drummond, was third\r\ndaughter of Patrick, third lord Drummond. She married Robert, the second\r\nearl of Roxburghe, and was mother to Hary, lord Ker. She possessed\r\ndistinguished abilities, was one of the ladies of the queen’s\r\nbedchamber, and governess to the royal children. She died October 7,\r\n1643. Her funeral was fixed on by the royalists as a convenient pretext\r\nto assemble for a massacre of the leading covenanters, but the numbers\r\nproved too inconsiderable for the attempt. She was hurried in the family\r\nvault in the chapel-royal, Holyrood-house: the vault was long open to\r\npublic view. The editor of “Heriot’s Life,” in 1822, gives her autograph\r\nas “Jane Drummond,” and speaks of having seen her coffin and remains\r\nthirty years before, shortly after which period he believes the vault to\r\nhave been closed. In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” of February, 1799, plate\r\nII., there is a fac-simile of her autograph, as countess of Roxburghe,\r\nfrom her receipt, dated May 10, 1617, for “500_l._, part of the sum of\r\n3000_l._, of his majesty’s free and princely gift to her, in\r\nconsideration of long and faithful service done to the queen, as one of\r\nthe ladies of the bedchamber to her majesty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·15.\r\n\r\n  [195] General Biographical Dictionary.\r\n\r\n  [196] Communicated by Mr. Johnson, of Newark.\r\n\r\n  [197] “Arabella Stuart,” in Evans’s Old Ballads; supposed to have been\r\n  written by Mickle.\r\n\r\n  [198] Mr. D’Israeli.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE CELEBRATION.\r\n\r\nThis was king George the Third’s birth-day, and therefore during his\r\nreign was kept at court, and in many towns throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt Bexhill, on the coast of Sussex, where the inhabitants, who scarcely\r\nexceed 800, are remarkable for longevity and loyalty, on the 4th of\r\nJune, 1819, they celebrated the king’s birth-day in an appropriate and\r\nremarkable manner. Twenty-five old men, inhabitants of the parish, whose\r\nunited ages amounted to 2025, averaging eighty-one each (the age of the\r\nking) dined together at the Bell Inn, and passed the day in a cheerful\r\nand happy manner. The dinner was set on table by fifteen other old men,\r\nalso of the above parish, whose united ages amounted to seventy-one\r\neach, and six others, whose ages amounted to sixty-one each, rang the\r\nbells on the occasion. The old men dined at one o’clock; and at\r\nhalf-past two a public dinner was served up to the greater part of the\r\nrespectable inhabitants to the number of eighty-one, who were also the\r\nsubscribers to the old men’s dinner. The assembly room was decorated\r\nwith several appropriate devices; and some of the old men, with the\r\ngreater part of the company, enjoyed themselves to a late hour.[199]\r\n\r\n\r\nBELL RINGING\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nHAND BELLS IN CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--In pp. 161-2, vol. ii., your correspondent H. H. N. N. of Newark,\r\ninforms us of the custom of ringing a bell at six o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and eight in the evening; likewise of a set of “hand bells”\r\nkept in the church there; and desires to be informed of their use.\r\nAlthough I cannot inform him of the particular origin of ringing the\r\nbell at particular hours in that town, yet by stating the practice in\r\nsome other towns, it may, perhaps, contribute to unravel its meaning.\r\nWith regard to the “hand bells,” it seems probable that they were\r\noriginally placed in churches for the use of the ringers, who employed\r\ntheir leisure in practising and amusing themselves in the evenings when\r\nnot engaged in the belfry, as is the case at the present time in some\r\nparts of London. Although I do not recollect where the hand bells are\r\nused in town, yet I have more than once lately heard it mentioned in\r\nFenchurch-street and its neighbourhood, that the ringers were in the\r\npractice of amusing themselves with hand bells at a public-house where\r\nthey assembled for the purpose of practising; and it is more than\r\nprobable, that some of your readers in that neighbourhood can furnish\r\nyou with further particulars.\r\n\r\nIn most of the towns in the west of England, they have a custom of\r\nringing one of the church bells (generally the treble bell) in the\r\nmorning and evenings. Among other towns I noticed at _Dorchester_,\r\nDorset, the practice of ringing a bell at six in the morning in the\r\nsummer, and seven in the winter, at one o’clock at noon, and at eight in\r\nthe evening, concluding after ringing at eight o’clock with striking as\r\nmany strokes as the month is days old; and this practice I was there\r\ninformed was for calling people to work in the morning, the time for\r\ndinner, and for leaving work in the evening.\r\n\r\nAt another town in Dorsetshire, _Sherborne_, they have an almost endless\r\n“ding-dong,” “twing-twang,” or “bim-bome,” throughout the day. Happening\r\nto be lately there on a market-day (Saturday) I was awakened in the\r\nmorning, at _four_ o’clock, by the ringing of the “church treble bell;”\r\nat _six_ o’clock the church “chimes” were in play; at a quarter before\r\n_seven_ the “almshouse bell” began, and continued to ring till _seven_,\r\nwhich is said to be for the purpose of calling the scholars of king\r\nEdward the Sixth’s grammar school to their studies, who were no sooner\r\nassembled than the “school bell” announced the master’s approach. At\r\n_half-past eight_ the “almshouse bell” summoned the almsmen and women to\r\nprayers; at _nine_ the “chimes;” at _eleven_ the “wholesale market\r\nbell;” at _twelve_ the “chimes;” at _one_ the “school bell” for dinner;\r\nat _half-past one_ the “retail market bell;” at _three_ the “chimes,”\r\nand the church “great bell”[200] tolled twice at a short interval, when,\r\nwhat is appositely enough called the “tanging bell,” rang until the\r\nminister and religiously inclined had assembled for prayer; at _four_\r\nthe “almshouse bell;” at _six_ the “chimes;” at _seven_ the “school\r\nbell” for supper; at _eight_ the “church bell,” which rang a quarter of\r\nan hour, and concluded by giving eight strokes; at _nine_ the “chimes,”\r\nand the “school bell” for bed.\r\n\r\nSo much bell ringing and tolling naturally led to an inquiry of the\r\nseveral causes that gave rise to it. By some, the first morning and\r\neight o’clock bell is called the “curfew bell,” and the practice of\r\nringing it is said to have been continued from the time of William the\r\nConqueror, who, by one of his laws, ordered the people to put out their\r\nfires and lights, and go to bed at the eight o’clock curfew bell; and\r\nothers affirmed it to be, for the purpose of summoning the people to\r\ntheir labours.\r\n\r\nThe practice of ringing a church bell in the morning and evening is\r\ncommon in most towns where they have a bell, although its origin is\r\nseldom inquired about or noticed. I have often made inquiries on the\r\nsubject, and have always received one of the above answers, and am\r\ninclined rather to believe its origin is the “curfew bell,” although it\r\nnow serves more the purpose of warning people to their labours, than for\r\nthe “extinction and relighting of all fire and candle lights.”\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  R.

FIRST MONDAY IN JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heriot’s Hospital, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\nA solemn festival in the Scottish metropolis is ordained by the\r\n“Statutes of George Heriot’s Hospital,” (cap. ii.) in the following\r\nwords:--“But especially _upon the first Monday in June_, every year,\r\nshall be kept a solemn commemoration and thanksgiving unto God, in this\r\nform which followeth. In the morning, about eight of the clock of that\r\nday, the lord provost, all the ministers, magistrates, and ordinary\r\ncouncil of the city of Edinburgh, shall assemble themselves in the\r\ncommittee-chamber of the said hospital; from thence, all the scholars\r\nand officers of the said hospital going before them two by two, they\r\nshall go, with all the solemnity that may be, to the Gray Friars church\r\nof the said city, where they shall hear a sermon preached by one of the\r\nsaid ministers, every one yearly in their courses, according to the\r\nantiquity of their ministry in the said city. The principal argument of\r\nthe sermon shall be to these purposes: To give God thanks for the\r\ncharitable maintenance which the poor maintained in the hospital\r\nreceived by the bounty of the said founder, of whom shall be made\r\nhonourable mention. To exhort all men of ability, according to their\r\nmeans, to follow his example: To urge the necessity of good works,\r\naccording to men’s power, for the testimony of their faith: And to clear\r\nthe doctrine of our church from all the calumnies of our adversaries,\r\nwho give us out to be the impugners of good works. After the sermon\r\nended, all above named shall return to the hospital, with the same\r\nsolemnity and order they came from it, where shall be paid to the\r\nminister who preached, to buy him books, by the treasurer of the\r\nhospital for the time being, out of the treasury or rents of the\r\nhospital, the sum of      .”\r\n\r\nBy appointment of the governors, Mr. Robert Douglas, one of the\r\nministers of Edinburgh, preached a sermon on the first Monday of June,\r\nof the year 1659, in commemoration of the founder; for this sermon he\r\nreceived the sum of one hundred marks “to buy him books,” agreeably to\r\nthe statutes. From that time the usage has been continued annually, the\r\nministers of Edinburgh preaching in rotation, according to their\r\nseniority of office, in the old Gray Friars church.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the statue of the founder is fancifully decorated with\r\nflowers. Each of the boys receives a new suit of clothes; their\r\nrelations and friends assemble; and the citizens, old and young, being\r\nadmitted to view the hospital, the gaiety of the scene is highly\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a custom with the boys to dress Heriot’s statue with\r\nflowers on the first of May, and to renew them on this anniversary\r\nfestival when they received their new clothes.[202]\r\n\r\nIt should seem, therefore, that the floral adornment of the statue\r\nannually on this day, is derived from its ancient dressing on the first\r\nof May.\r\n\r\nThe statue stands beneath the centre tower of the north or principal\r\nfront, and over the middle of a vaulted archway leading to the\r\ncourt-yard of the hospital. Grose says, the Latin inscription above the\r\nfigure signifies, “that Heriot’s person was represented by that image,\r\nas his mind was by the surrounding foundation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Heriot was jeweller to king James VI., subsequently James I., of\r\nEngland. He was born about June, 1563, eldest son to George Heriot, one\r\nof the company of goldsmiths in Edinburgh. The elder Heriot died in\r\n1610, having been a commissioner in the convention of estates and\r\nparliament of Scotland, and a convener of the trades of Edinburgh at\r\nfive different elections of the council. The goldsmiths were then the\r\nmoney-dealers in Scotland; they consequently ranked among the most\r\nrespectable citizens, and to this profession the subject of this memoir\r\nwas brought up by his father.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt appears that so late as the year 1483, the goldsmiths of Edinburgh\r\nwere classed with the “hammermen” or common smiths. They were\r\nsubsequently separated, and an act of the town council on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of August, 1581, conferred on the goldsmiths a monopoly of\r\ntheir trade, which was confirmed by a charter from James VI., in the\r\nyear 1586.\r\n\r\nA century afterwards, in 1687, James VII. invested the goldsmiths with\r\nthe power of searching, inspecting, and trying all jewels set in gold,\r\nin every part of the kingdom; a license to destroy all false or\r\ncounterfeit work; to punish the transgressors by imprisonment or fines,\r\nand seize the working tools of all unfree goldsmiths within the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn January, 1587, George Heriot married Christian, the daughter of Simon\r\nMarjoribanks, an Edinburgh merchant. On this occasion, his father gave\r\nhim 1000 marks, with 500 more to fit out his shop and purchase\r\nimplements and clothes, and he had 1075 marks with his wife. Their\r\nunited fortunes amounted to about 214_l._ 11_s._ 8_d._, which Heriot’s\r\nlast biographer says, was “a considerable sum in those days; but\r\nrendered much more useful by the prospect of his father’s business,\r\nwhich would at this time naturally be transferred to the younger and\r\nmore active man.”\r\n\r\nIn May, 1588, Heriot became a member of the incorporation of goldsmiths.\r\n“Scotland which was then an independent kingdom, with a court in the\r\nmetropolis, though poor in general, was probably in a state not less\r\nfavourable to the success of Heriot’s occupation than at present. A rude\r\nmagnificence peculiar to the age, atoned for want of elegance, by the\r\nmassy splendour of its ornaments. The nobles were proud and extravagant\r\nwhen their fortunes would permit; and Ann of Denmark, the reigning\r\nqueen, was fond of show and gallantry.” During this period, Heriot was\r\nemployed by the court. In 1597, he was made goldsmith to the queen, and\r\nso declared “at the crosse, be opin proclamatione and sound of trumpet.”\r\nShortly after, he was appointed jeweller and goldsmith to the king, with\r\na right to the lucrative privileges of that office.\r\n\r\nHeriot rose to opulence, and lost his wife; he afterwards married\r\nAlison, eldest daughter of James Primrose, clerk to the privy-council,\r\nand grandfather of the first earl of Roseberry. On the accession of\r\nJames to the throne of England, he followed the court to London, where\r\nhe continued to reside almost constantly. He obtained eminence and\r\nwealth, and died there on the twelfth of February, 1624, in the sixtieth\r\nyear of his age, and was buried at St. Martin’s in the Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Queen Ann of Denmark’s Jewels._\r\n\r\nIn a volume of original accounts and vouchers relative to Heriot’s\r\ntransactions with the queen, there are several charges which illustrate\r\nthe fashion of the times in these expensive decorations, viz.--\r\n\r\nFor making a brilliant in form of a ship.\r\n\r\nFor gold and making of a _Valentine_.\r\n\r\nA ring with a heart and a serpent, all set about with diamonds;\r\n\r\nTwo pendants made like moore’s heads, and all sett with diamonds;\r\n\r\nA ring with a single diamond, set in a heart betwixt two hands.\r\n\r\nTwo flies with diamonds.\r\n\r\nA great ring in the form of a perssed eye and a perssed heart, all sett\r\nwith diamonds.\r\n\r\nOne great ring, in forme of a frog, all set with diamonds, _price two\r\nhundreth poundis_.\r\n\r\nA jewell in forme of a butterfly.\r\n\r\nA jewell in forme of a lillye, sett of diamonds.\r\n\r\nAn anker sett with diamonds.\r\n\r\nA jewell in form of a honey-suckle.\r\n\r\nA pair of pendants, made lyke two drums, sett with diamondis.\r\n\r\nA jewel, in forme of a jolley flower, sett with diamonds.\r\n\r\nA jewell in forme of a horne of aboundance, set with 6 rose diamondis,\r\nand 12 table diamondis.\r\n\r\nA ring of a burning heart set with diamondis.\r\n\r\nA ring, in forme of a scallope shell, set with a table diamond, and\r\nopening on the head.\r\n\r\nA pair of pendentis of two handis, and two serpentis hanging at them.\r\n\r\nA parrate of diamondis.\r\n\r\nA ring of a love trophe set with diamondis.\r\n\r\nTwo rings, lyke black flowers, with a table diamond in each.\r\n\r\nA daissie ring sett with a table diamond.\r\n\r\nA jewell in fashione of a bay leaf, opening for a pictur, and set with\r\ndiamondis on the one syde.\r\n\r\nA pair of lizard pendantis, set with diamondis.\r\n\r\nA jewell for a hatt, in forme of a bay leafe, all set with diamonds.\r\n\r\nA little watch set all over with diamonds, 170_l._\r\n\r\nA ryng sett all over with diamondis, made in fashion of a lizard,\r\n120_l._\r\n\r\nA ring set with 9 diamonds, and opening on the head with the king’s\r\npicture in that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET HARTSYDE.\r\n\r\nIn an account of “jewells and other furnishings,” which were “sould and\r\ndeliuered to the Queene’s most excellent ma^{tie.} from the x^{th.} of\r\nApril, 1607, to the x^{th.} of February followinge, by George Heriote,\r\nher Highnes’ jewellor,” there is the following\r\n\r\n“_Item_, deliuered to _Margarett Hartsyde_ a ring sett all about with\r\ndiamonds, and a table diamond on the head, _which she gaue me to\r\nvnderstand was by her Ma^{ts.} direction_, price\r\n\r\n  xxx _li._”\r\n\r\nThis item in reference to Margaret Hartsyde is remarkable, because it\r\nappears that this female, who had been in the royal household, was tried\r\nin Edinburgh on the 31st of May, 1608, for stealing a pearl, worth\r\n110_l._ sterling belonging to the queen. She pretended that she retained\r\nthese pearls to adorn dolls for the amusement of the royal infants, and\r\nbelieved that the queen would never demand them; but it appeared that\r\nshe used “great cunning and deceit in it,” and disguised the jewels so\r\nas not to be easily known, and offered them to her majesty in sale. The\r\nking by special warrant declared her infamous, sentenced her to pay\r\n400_l._ sterling as the value of the jewels, and condemned her to be\r\nimprisoned in Blackness castle till it was paid, and to confinement in\r\nOrkney during her life. In December, 1619, eleven years afterwards,\r\n“compeared the king’s advocate, and produced a letter of rehabilitation\r\nand restitution of Margaret Hartsyde to her fame.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Heriot’s Hospital.~]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a memorial of queen Anne of Denmark’s fondness for dogs in a\r\nlarge whole-length portrait of her, surrounded by those animals, which\r\nshe holds in leashes. In Heriot’s accounts there are charges for their\r\nfurniture: e. g.\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for the garnishing of vj doge collers, weighing in silver xix\r\n  ounces                                               iiij _li._ xv_s._\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for the workmanshipe of the said collers       ij _li._ x_s._\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, boght to the said collers ij ounces iij quarters of silver\r\n  lace, at v_s._ vj_d._ ounce                           xv_s._ i_d._ ob.\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for making _w_p of the said collers at ij_s._ the peice\r\n                                                                xij_s._”\r\n\r\nHer majesty’s perfumes seem to have derived additions from Heriot. He\r\nfurnished her with “5 ounces and a half of fyne civett, at _li._ 4 the\r\nounce:” also\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for fower ounces of fyne musk de Levant, at xxxviij_s._ the\r\n  ounce                                                vij _li._ xij_s._\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for a glass of balsome,                              ij _li._\r\n\r\n  “_Item_, for a glass of whyte balsome, and a glasse of black balsome\r\n                                                          j _li._ x_s._”\r\n\r\nThere are no particulars of the private life of Heriot. From small\r\nbeginnings, he died worth 50,000_l._, and acquired lands and houses at\r\nRoehampton, in Surrey, and St. Martin’s in the Fields, London. It does\r\nnot appear that he had children by either of his wives, but he had two\r\nillegitimate daughters. To one of these, named in his will as “Elizabeth\r\nBand, now an infant of the age of ten years or therabout, and remaining\r\nwith Mr. Starkey at his house at Windsor,” he gave his copyholds in\r\nRoehampton. To the other, whom he mentions as “Margaret Scot, being an\r\ninfant about the age of four years, now remaining with one Rigden, a\r\nwaterman, at his house in the parish of Fulham,” he left his two\r\nfreehold messuages in St. George’s in the Fields, which he had lately\r\npurchased of sir Nicholas Fortescue, knight, and William Fortescue, his\r\nson: his leasehold terms in certain garden plots in that parish, held of\r\nthe earl of Bedford, he bequeathed to Margaret Scot; and he directed\r\n200_l._ to be laid out at interest, and paid to them severally when of\r\nage or married. He gave 10_l._ to the poor of St. Martin’s parish,\r\n20_l._ to the French church there, and 30_l._ to Gilbert Primrose,\r\npreacher at that church; and after liberally providing for a great\r\nnumber of his relations, he bequeathed the residue of his estate to the\r\nprovosts, bailiffs, ministers, and ordinary town-council of Edinburgh,\r\nfor the time being, for and towards the founding and erecting of a\r\nhospital in the said town, and purchasing lands in perpetuity, to be\r\nemployed in the maintenance and education of so many poor freemen’s\r\nsons of the town as the yearly value of the lands would afford means to\r\nprovide for. He appointed the said town council perpetual governors of\r\nthe institution, which he ordained should be governed by such orders or\r\nstatutes as he made in his lifetime, or as should be formed and signed\r\nafter his decease by Dr. Balcanquel, one of his executors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Heriot’s Statue at his Hospital, Edinburgh.~]\r\n\r\n    “So stands the statue that _adorns_ the _gate_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHERIOT’S HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe residue of Heriot’s estate amounted to 23,625_l._ 10_s._ 3_d._ which\r\nsum was paid by his executors, on the 12th of May, 1627, to the\r\ntown-council of Edinburgh. He had directed a large messuage in\r\nEdinburgh, between Gray’s close and Todrick’s wynd, to be appropriated\r\nto the hospital; but the governors, in conjunction with Dr. Balcanquel,\r\nfinding it unfit for the purpose, purchased of the citizens of\r\nEdinburgh, eight acres and a half of land near the Grass Market, in a\r\nfield called the “High Riggs,” and they commenced to lay the foundation\r\nof the present structure on the 1st of July, 1628, according to a plan\r\nof Inigo Jones. The stones were brought from Ravelstone, near Edinburgh;\r\nand the building was conducted by William Aytoune, an eminent mason or\r\narchitect, with considerable deviations from Inigo Jones’s design, in\r\naccommodation to the supervening taste of Heriot’s trustees. In 1639,\r\nthe progress of the work was interrupted by the troubles of the period\r\ntill 1642. When it was nearly completed, in 1650, Cromwell’s army\r\noccupied it as an infirmary for the sick and wounded. It remained in\r\nsuch possession till general Monk, in 1658, on the request of a\r\ncommittee of governors, removed the soldiers to the new infirmary in the\r\nCanongate, at the expense of Heriot’s trustees; and on the 11th of\r\nApril, 1659, the hospital being ready, thirty boys were admitted. In the\r\nfollowing August they were increased to forty; in 1661, to fifty-two; in\r\n1753, to one hundred and thirty; in 1763, to one hundred and forty; and\r\nin 1822, the establishment maintained one hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe children of Heriot’s eldest daughter, Elizabeth Band, were among the\r\nearly objects who benefited by the endowment. She had married in\r\nEngland, but being reduced to great difficulties, resorted to Edinburgh\r\nfor relief. The magistrates allowed her one thousand merks Scots\r\nannually, till her sons were admitted into their grandfather’s hospital.\r\nShe had 20_l._ afterwards to support her journey to London, and a\r\npresent of one thousand merks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHeriot’s hospital cost 30,000_l._ in the erection. The first managers\r\npurchased the barony of Broughton, a burgh of regality, about a quarter\r\nof a mile northward of the city, a property which, from local\r\ncircumstances, seemed likely to rise in value. On this and other\r\nadjacent land, the “new town” of Edinburgh now stands. The greater part\r\nof the valuable grounds from the bottom of Carlton-hill eastward,\r\nreaching to Leith, and to the east road to Edinburgh, is the property of\r\nthe hospital, which will derive great additional revenue when the\r\nbuildings on these lands complete the connection of Leith with\r\nEdinburgh. In 1779, Heriot’s hospital possessed a real income of\r\n1800_l._ per annum: its annual income in 1822 was supposed to have\r\namounted to upwards of 12,000_l._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe statutes of the hospital ordain, that the boys should be taught “to\r\nread and write Scots distinctly, to cypher, and cast all manner of\r\naccounts,” and “the Latin rudiments, but no further.” The governors,\r\nhowever, have wisely gone so much “further,” as to cause the boys to be\r\ninstructed in Greek, mathematics, navigation, drawing, and other matters\r\nsuitable to the pursuits they are likely to follow in life. The majority\r\nof the boys are apprenticed to trades in Edinburgh, with an allowance of\r\n10_l._ a year for five years, amounting to an apprentice fee of 50_l._;\r\nand to each, who on the expiration of his servitude produces a\r\ncertificate of good conduct from his master, 5_l._ is given to purchase\r\na suit of clothes. Those destined for the learned professions are sent\r\nto the university for four years, with an allowance of 30_l._ annually.\r\nSix or eight are generally at college, in addition to ten bursers\r\nselected by the governors from other seminaries, who have each an annual\r\nallowance of 20_l._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge Heriot confided to his intimate friend “Mr. Walter Balcanquel,\r\ndoctor in divinity and master of the Savoy,” the framing and ordaining\r\nof the rules for the government of his hospital; and accordingly in\r\n1627, Dr. Balcanquel, “after consulting with the provosts, baillies,\r\nministers, and council of Edinburgh,” compiled the statutes by which the\r\ninstitution continues to be governed. By these it is directed that “this\r\ninstitution, foundation, and hospital, shall for all time to come,\r\nperpetually and unchangeably be called by the name of _George Heriot his\r\nHospital_,” and that “there shall be one common seal for the said\r\nhospital engraven with this device, _Sigillum Hospitalis Georgii\r\nHeriot_, about the circle, and in the middle the pattern of the\r\nhospital.”\r\n\r\nAnd “because no body can be well governed without a head, there shall\r\nbe one of good respect chosen _master_ of the hospital, who shall have\r\npower to govern all the scholars and officers;” and therefore the\r\ngovernors are enjoined to have a special care, “that he be a man fearing\r\nGod; of honest life and conversation; of so much learning as he be fit\r\nto teach the catechism; a man of that discretion, as he may be fit to\r\ngovern and correct all that live within the house; and a man of that\r\ncare and providence, that he may be fit to take the accounts of the\r\nsame; a man of that worth and respect, as he may be fit to be an\r\nassessor with the governors, having a suffrage given unto him in all\r\nbusinesses concerning the hospital. He shall be an unmarried man,\r\notherwise let him be altogether uncapable of being master. He shall have\r\nyearly given unto him a new gown. Within the precincts of the hospital\r\nhe shall never go without his gown: in the hall he shall have his diet,\r\nhe and the schoolmaster, in the upper end, at a little table by\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThe _schoolmaster_, whose duties in teaching are already expressed by\r\nthe quality of the learning defined to the boys, also “must be\r\nunmarried.”\r\n\r\nIt is charged on the consciences of the electors, “that they choose no\r\nburgess’s children, if their parents be well and sufficiently able to\r\nmaintain them, since the intention of the founder is only to relieve the\r\npoor; they must not be under seven years of age complete, and they shall\r\nnot stay in the hospital after they are of the age of sixteen years\r\ncomplete: they shall be comely and decently apparelled, as becometh,\r\nboth in their linens and clothes; and their apparel shall be of sad\r\nrusset cloth, doublets, breeches, and stockings or hose, and gowns of\r\nthe same colour, with black hats and strings, which they shall be bound\r\nto wear during their abode in the said hospital, and no other.”\r\n\r\nFurther, it is provided, that “there shall be _a pair of stocks_ placed\r\nat the end of the hall in the hospital, in which the master shall\r\ncommand to be laid any officer, for any such offences as in his\r\ndiscretion shall seem to deserve it; and the master likewise shall have\r\nauthority to lay in the same stocks any vagrant stranger of mean\r\nquality, who, within the precincts of the hospital, shall commit any\r\nsuch offence as may deserve it: the officer for executing the master’s\r\ncommand; in this point of justice, shall be the porter of the\r\nhospital.” The _porter_ is to be “a man, unmarried, of honest report--of\r\ngood strength, able to keep out all sturdy beggars and vagrant\r\npersons;--he shall have every year a new gown, which he must wear\r\ncontinually at the gate; and if, at any time, he dispose himself to\r\nmarry, he shall demit his place, or else be deprived of the same.”\r\n\r\nThe last of many officers ordained is “one _chirurgeon-barber_, who\r\nshall cut and poll the hair of all the scholars in the hospital; as also\r\nlook to the cure of all those within the hospital, who any way shall\r\nstand in need of his art.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese extracts are rather curious than important; for it is presumed,\r\nthat any who are interested in acquiring further knowledge, will consult\r\nthe statutes “at large.” They are set forth in “The Life of George\r\nHeriot,” published at Edinburgh in 1822, from whence the preceding\r\nparticulars of the hospital and its founder are derived. They especially\r\nprovide for the strict religious instruction of the boys--“while in the\r\nhospital the greatest care is bestowed on them in regard to morals and\r\nhealth; they have certain hours allowed them daily for exercise; and\r\ntheir amusements generally partake of a manly character.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be quoted as an amusing incident in the annals of the\r\nestablishment, that “a singular occurrence took place with the boys of\r\nHeriot’s hospital in 1681-2, the year in which the earl of Argyle was\r\ntried, and convicted of high treason, for refusing the test oath without\r\ncertain qualifications. We extract the following account of it from\r\n_Lord Fountainhill’s Chronological Notes of Scottish Affairs_, just\r\npublished: ‘Argyle was much hated for oppressing his creditors, and\r\nneither paying his own nor father’s debts, but lord Halifax told Charles\r\nII. he understood not the Scots law, but the English law would not have\r\nhanged _a dog_ for such a crime.’ Every lawyer of common sense, or\r\nordinary conscience, will be of the same opinion. Lord Clarendon, when\r\nhe heard the sentence, blessed God that he lived not in a country where\r\nthere were such laws, but he ought to have said such judges. The very\r\nhospital children made a mockery of the reasoning of the crown lawyers.\r\nThe boys of Heriot’s hospital resolved among themselves, that the\r\n_house-dog_ belonging to the establishment held _a public office_, and\r\nought to take the _test_. The paper being presented to the mastiff, he\r\nrefused to swallow the same unless it was rubbed over with butter. Being\r\na second time tendered, buttered as above mentioned, the dog swallowed\r\nit, and was next accused and condemned, for having taken the test with a\r\nqualification, as in the case of Argyle!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG OF HERIOT’S HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nThere is “_An Account of the Arraignment, Tryal, Escape, and\r\nCondemnation of the_ DOG _of_ Heriot’s Hospital _in_ Scotland, _that was\r\nsupposed to have been hang’d, but did at last slip the halter_.”\r\n\r\nFrom this exceedingly rare folio paper of two pages, “_Printed for the\r\nauthor_, M. D. 1682,” now before the editor of the _Every-Day Book_, he\r\nproceeds to extract some exponences in the case of “the dog of Heriot’s\r\nhospital,” by which “the reasoning of the crown lawyers,” in the case of\r\nthe duke of Argyle, was successfully ridiculed.\r\n\r\nIts waggish author writes in the manner of a letter, “to show you that\r\nthe act, whereby all publick officers are obleadged to take the Test is\r\nrigorously put in execution; and therby many persons, baith in Kirk and\r\nState, throughout the haill Kingdome, by reasone they are not free to\r\ntake the said Test, are incontinently turned out of their places.”\r\n\r\nHe then relates that this severity occasioned “the loune ladds belonging\r\nto the hospittal of Hariot’s Buildings in Edenbrough, to divert\r\nthemselves with somewhat like the following tragi-commedy.”\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to state, that they “fell intil a debate amongist\r\nthemselves, whither or no, ane mastiffe Tyke, who keept the outmost\r\ngate, might not, by reasone of his office of trust, come within the\r\ncompass of the act, and swa, be obleadged to take the Test, or be turned\r\nout of his place.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, “the tyke thereupon was called, and interrogat, whither\r\nhe wold take the test, or run the hazard of forfaulting his office.”\r\n\r\nThough propounded again and again, “the silly curr, boding no ill,\r\nanswered all their queries with silence, whilk had been registrat as a\r\nflat refusal, had not on of the lounes, mair bald then the rest, taken\r\nupon him to be his advocat, who standing up, pleaded that silence might\r\nas wel be interpreted assent, as refusal, and therupon insisted that it\r\nmight be tendered to him in a way maist plausible, and in a poustar\r\nmaist agreeable to his stomack.”\r\n\r\nThe debate lasted till all agreed “that ane printed copy should be\r\nthrumbled, of as little boulke as it could, and therafter smured over\r\nwith tallow, butter, or what else might make maist tempting to his\r\nappetit: this done he readily took it, and after he had made a shift, by\r\nrowing it up and down his mouth, to separat what was pleasant to his\r\npallat, and when all seemed to be over, on a sudden they observed\r\nsomehat (ilke piece after another) droped out of his mouth, qwhilk the\r\nadvocats on the other side said was the test, and that all his irksome\r\nchamping and chowing of it, was only, if possible, to seperat the\r\nconcomitant nutriment, and that this was mikel worse then an flat\r\nrefusal, and gif it were rightly examined, would, upon Tryal, be found\r\nno less then Leising-making.”\r\n\r\nThe tyke’s advocate “opponed, that his enemies having the rowing of it\r\nup, might perhaps (through deadly spite) have put some crooked prin\r\nintil it; and that all the fumbling and rowing of it up and down his\r\nmouth, might be by reason of the prin, and not through any scunnering at\r\nthe test itself; and that there was nought in the hail matter, that\r\nlooked like Leising-making, except by interpretation, and his\r\nadversaries allowed to be the only interpreters.” Finally, he required\r\nthat his client should have a fair trial before competent judges,\r\n“qwhilk was unanimously granted;” and on the trial “ther fell out warm\r\npleading.”\r\n\r\nThe advocates against the tyke set forth, “that he was ou’r malapert, to\r\ntake so mikel upon him; and that the chaming and cherking of the test\r\nbelonged nought to him, nor to none like him, who served only in\r\ninferior offices; that his trust and power reached nought so far, and by\r\nwhat he had done, he had made himself guilty of mair nor abase refusal\r\nas was libelled.”\r\n\r\nThose who defended the tyke, pleaded “that he could be guilty of nather,\r\nsince he had freely taken it in his mouth, willing to have swallowed it\r\ndown; and that ther was no fault in him, but in its self, that it passed\r\nnot; since it fell a sqwabeling, one part of it hindering another;” that\r\nif it would “have agreed in its self to have gone down all one way, he\r\nwold blaithly swallowed it, as he had done many untouthsome morsel\r\nbefore, as was well known to all the court.”\r\n\r\nTo this was answered, that “all his former good service could not excuse\r\nhis present guilt.”\r\n\r\n“Guilt!” quoth another, “if that be guilt he hath many marrows, and why\r\nshould he be worse handled than all the rest?”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding what was urged in the tyke’s behalf, the jury found he\r\nhad so mangled the test, and abused it, that it was “interpretative\r\ntreason,” and found him “guilty of Leising-making:” wherefore he was\r\nordered to close prison till he should be again called forth and receive\r\nsentence “to be hanged like a dog.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was removing from the court, there chanced “a curate” to be\r\npresent, and ask, “what was the matter, what ailed them at the dog?”\r\nwhereto one answered, “that he, being in publick trust, was required to\r\ntake the test, and had both refused it and abused it, whereupon he was\r\nto be hanged;” whereat the curate, storming, said, “They deserved all to\r\nbe hanged for such presumptuous mockery;” but the boys, laughing aloud,\r\ncried with one consent, that “he, and his brethren, deserved better to\r\nbe hanged than any of them, or the tyke eather, since _they_ had\r\nswallowed that which the tyke refused.”\r\n\r\nThe verdict created no small dissension; “some suspected deadly fewd in\r\nthe chanselor of the jury, alleadging that ane enemy was not fit to be a\r\njudg; this was answered, that he was of more noble extract then to stain\r\nhis honor with so base an act, and that his own reputation wold make him\r\nfavored; another objected that a tyke’s refusing so good a test, might\r\nbe ill example to creatures of better reason; to this a pakie loun\r\nanswered, that it could not be good, since Lyon Rampant, King of Tykes,\r\nnor none of his royal kin, wold not so much as lay ther lips, to it far\r\nless to swallow it, and therefore----”\r\n\r\nHere the speaker was interrupted “by one that was a principal limmer\r\namong them (a contradiction reconciler) who would needs help him with a\r\nlogical distinction, wherby he, like an Aberdeen’s man, might cant and\r\nrecant again.”\r\n\r\nThere were other conjectures, “requiring the judgment of the learn’d to\r\ndetermine which has been maist suitable:” e.g.\r\n\r\nOne fancied, that “the tyke might take the test _secundum quid_, though\r\nnot _simpliciter_;”\r\n\r\nAnother, that he might take it “_in sensu diviso_, though not _in sensu\r\ncomposito_;”\r\n\r\nA third, that “though it was deadly to take it with _verbal\r\ninterpretatione_, yet it might be taken safe enough with _mental\r\nreservatione_;”\r\n\r\nA fourth thought, that “though his stomach did stand at it, _in sensu\r\nunivoco_, yet it might easily digest it _in sensu et æquivoco_;”\r\n\r\nIn this manner suppositions multiplied, and to one who proposed a\r\n“jesuitical” distinction, it was answered, that “the tyke would neither\r\nsup kail with the div’l, nor the pope, and therefore needed not his long\r\nspoon; well, said ane other, this is mair nor needs, since we are all\r\nsure that the tyke could not have kept his office so long, but he most\r\nneeds have swallowed many a buttered bur before this time, and it was\r\nbut gaping a little wider and the hazard was over.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” quoth his neighbour, “the hazard was greater than ye imagine, for\r\nthe test, as it was rowed up, had many plyes and implications in it, one\r\ncontrary to another; and swa the tyke might been querkened ere it had\r\nbeen all over, ilk ply, as it were, rancountering another, wresling and\r\nfighting.”\r\n\r\nThen it was proposed, as the tyke had actually swallowed the better\r\npart, if not the whole test, that though he had brought it up again, yet\r\nit were better to try if he would swallow it again; “but this project\r\nwas universally rejected, baith by the maist charitable, as bootless,\r\nand by the mair severe, or too great a favor.”\r\n\r\nAs regarded the condemned tyke, “matters being thus precipitat, and all\r\nhopes of reprieve uncertain, a wylie loun advised him to lay by the\r\nsheep’s (which had done him so little good) and put on the fox’s skin;”\r\nwherefore, like a sensible dog, “hiding his own tail between his legs,\r\nand griping another’s train, he passed through all the gates\r\nundiscovered and swa was missing:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Thus he was forc’d when light did fail,\r\n    To give them the flap with a fox’s tail.’”\r\n\r\nWhat became of him was unknown, and “the news of the tyke’s escape being\r\nblazed abroad, the court assembleth to consult what was then anent to be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nBy one it was said that “the affronting escape, and other misdemeaners\r\nof that tyke were so great, that the highest severity was too little;”\r\n\r\nAnother said, “sine he is gone, let him go, what have we more to do, but\r\nput another in his place;”\r\n\r\nA third said, “his presumptuous and treasonable carriage, would be of\r\nill example to others, unless due punishment followed thereupon;”\r\n\r\nA fourth said, “had he not been confident of his own innocency he wold\r\nnever have byden a tryal, and since he met with such a surprising\r\nverdict, what could he do less than flee for his life? wold not the best\r\nin the court, if he had been in his circumstances done the like?”\r\n\r\nA fifth said, “if he had been condemned, and hanged in time, he had not\r\nplayed us this prank, but seeing we have missed himself, let us seaze\r\nwell on what he hath left behind him.”\r\n\r\nThen further debate ensued, and, thereupon, the conclusion; which was\r\nordered to be published as follows:--\r\n\r\n~Proclamation.~\r\n\r\n  “WHEREAS _ane cutt lugged, brounish coloured Mastiff Tyke, called\r\n  Watch, short leged, and of low stature; who being in Office of Public\r\n  Trust, was required to take the Test, and when it was lawfully\r\n  tendered to him, he so abused it, and mangled it; whereupon he, after\r\n  due Tryal for his presumption, was convict of Treason, and sincesyn\r\n  hath broken Prison_, whereupon _the Court adjudges him, To be hanged\r\n  like a Dog, whenever he shall be apprehended; and in the mean time\r\n  declares his Office, his hail Estat heiratable and moveable, and all\r\n  causualties belonging to him, to be echeated and forfaulted, and\r\n  ordeans the colectors of the Court to uplift his Rents and\r\n  Causualties, and to be countable to the Court, both for diligence and\r\n  intermission, and also discharges all persons to reset or harbor the\r\n  Fugitive Trator, and likeways, gives assurance to all persons, who\r\n  shall either apprehend him, or give true information of him, swa that\r\n  thereupon he bees apprehended, the person swa doing, shall have 500l.\r\n  for his pains._ Given at our Court, &c.”\r\n\r\n_A Remark._\r\n\r\nA great deal of the ingenious argument in this extremely scarce\r\nwitticism, was probably adduced by the “Heriot’s boys,” when they\r\nindulged in the practical humour of administering the test to the\r\nhospital dog as an “office bearer.” Independent of its ability, and\r\nbecause the editor of these sheets does not remember to have met with it\r\nin any collection of papers on public affairs, he has rather largely\r\nextracted from it, hoping that, as it is thus recorded, it will not be\r\naltogether misplaced. Of course, every reader may not view it in that\r\nlight; but there are some who know, that such materials frequently\r\nassist the historian to the proof of questionable facts, and that they\r\nare often a clue to very interesting discoveries: by such readers,\r\napology will not be required for the production.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been said of George Heriot, that “his vanity exceeded his\r\ncharity.”[203] But an assertion justly urged respecting many founders\r\nwho sought posthumous notoriety by sordid disregard to the welfare of\r\nsurviving relatives, cannot be applied to George Heriot. It was not\r\nuntil he had bestowed ample largesses on his kinsfolk, that he\r\nmunificently endowed his native town with a provision for rearing the\r\nchildren of its citizens. To stay the fame of the deed, was not in the\r\npower of the hand that bestowed the gift; and when the magistrates of\r\nEdinburgh honour Heriot’s memory, they incite others to emulate his\r\nvirtue. Their predecessors received his donation with a spirit and views\r\ncorrespondent to those of the donor: as faithful stewards they husbanded\r\nhis money, and laid it out to so great advantage, that when the hospital\r\nwas completed, though the building alone cost more than the amount of\r\nHeriot’s bequest, the fund had accumulated to defray the charges, and\r\nleave a considerable surplus for the maintenance of the inmates; with a\r\nprospect, which time has realized, of further increase from the\r\nincreasing value of the land they purchased and annexed to the\r\nfoundation as its property for ever. It did not escape the penetration\r\nof Heriot’s mind, and, in fact, he must naturally have taken into\r\naccount, that such an institution in the metropolis of Scotland would\r\nderive contributions from other sources, and flourish, as it yet\r\nflourishes, a treasure-house of charity.\r\n\r\nThe prudent and calculating foresight by which Heriot rendered his\r\nfortune splendid, was exercised in deliberating the management of the\r\ninmates on his projected establishment. He had the wisdom to distrust\r\nthe quality of his judgment on matters wherein his observation and\r\nknowledge were necessarily limited, and committed the drawing up of the\r\nstatutes to his friend Dr. Balcanquel. There is no evidence to what\r\nextent the founder himself had any share in these rules for effectuating\r\nhis intentions; but when the age wherein they were compiled is regarded,\r\nit will scarcely be alleged that he could have elected from his friends,\r\na better executor of the best of his good wishes.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of such experience as Dr. Balcanquel’s, in his capacity\r\nof master of the Savoy, is strong testimony of Heriot’s discrimination\r\nand manly sense. The statutes of Dr. Balcanquel, who had assisted at the\r\nsynod of Dort, and was successively dean of Westminster and Durham, are\r\nfree from the overlegislating disposition of his times, which while it\r\nsought to distinguish, confused the execution of purposes. To the\r\nliberal laws, and the liberal spirit wherein they have been interpreted,\r\nsome of the most highly-gifted natives of Edinburgh owe the cultivation\r\nof their talents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEach of the windows of Heriot’s hospital is remarkable for being\r\nornamented in a different manner, with the exception of two on the west\r\nside whereon the carvings exactly agree. The north gate is adorned with\r\nwreathed columns, and devices representing the modes of working in the\r\nbusiness of a jeweller and goldsmith.[204]\r\n\r\nHeriot’s boys, with a daring which seems to require some check, on\r\naccount of its risk, and the injury it must necessarily occasion in the\r\ncourse of time, have a practice of climbing this front by grasping the\r\ncarvings. The insecurity of this progress to a fearful eminence, has\r\nsurprised and alarmed many a spectator “frae the south.”\r\n\r\nInscriptions of various benefactions are placed in the council-room.\r\nThere is one which records the liberality of a well-known gentleman,\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n  1804\r\n  Dr. John Gilchrist,\r\n  several Years Professor of\r\n  the Hindostanee Language in the\r\n  College of Fort William, Bengal,\r\n  presented 100_l._ sterling\r\n  to this Hospital,\r\n  as a small testimony\r\n  of Gratitude for\r\n  his Education in so\r\n  valuable a Seminary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are several engravings of his portrait. One of them by J. Moffat,\r\nEdinburgh, engraved in 1820, after a picture by Scougal, in the\r\ncouncil-room of the edifice, is inscribed “GEORGE HERIOT, Jeweller to\r\nKing James VI., who, besides founding and endowing his stately hospital\r\nat Edinburgh, bequeathed to his relations above 60,000_l._ sterling.\r\nObiit. 1623. Ætatis Anno 63.” His arms on this print are surmounted by\r\nthe motto, “I distribute cheerfully.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the “Fortunes of Nigel,” by the author of “Waverely,” Heriot is\r\nintroduced, with a minute description of his dress and person, seemingly\r\nderived from real data, whereas there is little other authority for such\r\nmarkings, than the imagination of the well-known “Great Unknown.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe striking magnificence of Heriot’s hospital is recorded by an\r\nexpression of too great force to be strictly accurate. It was observed\r\nby a foreigner, before the palace of Holyrood-house was built by Charles\r\nII., that there was at Edinburgh a palace for beggars, and a dungeon for\r\nkings.[205]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of June, 1826, Carl Maria Von Weber, the eminent musical\r\ncomposer, died in London, of a long standing pulmonary affection,\r\nincreased probably by the untowardness of our climate. He gave a concert\r\nten days before, wherein he composed an air, and accompanied Miss\r\nStephens on the pianoforte, to the following\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n_From Lalla Rookh._\r\n\r\n    From Chindara’s warbling fount I come,\r\n    Call’d by that moonlight garland’s spell;\r\n    From Chindara’s fount, my fairy home,\r\n    Where in music, morn and night, I dwell.\r\n    Where lutes in the air are heard about,\r\n    And voices are singing the whole day long,\r\n    And every sigh the heart breathes out\r\n    Is turn’d, as it leaves the lips, to song!\r\n               Hither I come\r\n               From my fairy home,\r\n    And if there’s a magic in Music’s train,\r\n               I swear by the breath\r\n               Of that moonlight wreath,\r\n    Thy lover shall sigh at thy feet again.\r\n\r\n    For mine is the lay that lightly floats,\r\n    And mine are the murmuring, dying notes,\r\n    That fall as soft as snow on the sea,\r\n    And melt in the heart as instantly!\r\n    And the passionate strain that, deeply going,\r\n    Refines the bosom it trembles through,\r\n    As the musk-wind over the waters blowing,\r\n    Ruffles the waves, but sweetens it too!\r\n               So, hither I come\r\n               From my fairy home,\r\n    And if there’s a magic in Music’s train,\r\n               I swear by the breath\r\n               Of that moonlight wreath,\r\n    Thy lover shall sigh at thy feet again.\r\n\r\nThese words seem to have been kindred to Von Weber’s feelings. His last\r\nopera was “Oberon:” its performance at Covent-garden derives increased\r\ninterest from his premature decease. Mr. Planché adapted it for our\r\nstage, and published it as represented and superintended by its\r\nillustrious composer. There are two genuine editions of this drama, one\r\nin octavo, at the usual price, and the other in a pocket size, at a\r\nshilling, with an excellent portrait of Von Weber.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 57·72.\r\n\r\n  [202] Gentleman’s Magazine, 1745, p. 686.\r\n\r\n  [203] In a communication descriptive of Edinburgh, in the Gent.

He cried up anglers as the very perfection of human\r\nnature. They were the most meek, loving, and patient of God’s creatures.\r\nThey were too much imbued with nature’s tranquillizing spirit to be\r\nambitious; too excellent christians to be jealous; and all this, good,\r\nsimple-hearted fellow as he was, because he was such a man himself. I\r\nhave naturally great faith in the influence of nature, and, therefore,\r\nthough I never could resist a smile at Izaak’s zealous eulogies on the\r\nart--calling all times, people, and places, to do honour to it; pressing\r\nkings, prophets, apostles, and even Jesus Christ himself, into the ranks\r\nof his admired anglers--yet, I involuntarily permitted his warm and\r\nopen-hearted eloquence to more than half persuade me of the superior\r\nnatures of his piscatorial protegées; in short, that they were such men\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\nIn one of my summer rambles through the peak of Derbyshire I entered\r\nDovedale. It was in June, and on one of the most delightful evenings of\r\nthat delightful month. There had been rain in the day, and the calm\r\nsplendour of the declining sun fell upon a scene not more fantastically\r\nsublime in its features, than it was beautiful in its freshness. The air\r\nwas deliciously cool, balmy, and saturated with the odour of flowers.\r\nThe deep grass in the bottom of the valley was heavy with its\r\nluxuriance. The shrubs waved and sparkled, with their myriad drops, upon\r\nlofty crags and stern precipices; and the Dove, that most beautiful of\r\nswift and translucent streams, went sounding on its way with a voice of\r\ngladness in full accordance with every thing around it. I have seen it\r\nmany times,--and the finest scenes, often seen, are apt to lose some of\r\ntheir effect,--yet I never felt more completely the whole fascination of\r\nthe place. It put me, as such things are apt to do, into a ruminating\r\nand poetical mood,--a humour to soliloquize and admire, and to see\r\nthings perhaps a little more fancifully than an etymologist, or a\r\nmathematician might.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly when that species of ephemera, the drake-fly, the glory\r\nof trouts and of trout-takers, was in season. They were fluttering by\r\nthousands over the stream, and dropping every moment into it, where many\r\na luxuriating mouth was ready to receive them. The anglers were half as\r\nnumerous as they; from the bottom of Dove-dale to Berresford Hall, the\r\nwhilom residence of Cotton, and the resort of Walton, scarcely a hundred\r\nyards but “maintained its man.” I pleased myself with fancying I saw\r\namongst them many a face which belonged to a disciple of Izaak worthy of\r\nthe master and the art, and, had I not entered into talk with them, I\r\nmight have thought so now.\r\n\r\nBut, I asked one if there was not once a very famous angler, who\r\nfrequented the Dove. “Oh aye!” said he, “I know whom you mean; you mean\r\nold Dennel Hastings. For fishing and _shuting_ he was the cob of all\r\nthis country!” Alas! poor Izaak! I thought; but I glanced at the man’s\r\nfish-basket as I passed. It was empty, and I set him down as a fellow\r\nnot more ignorant of Izaak than of the patient mystery. But soon after,\r\nI cast my eye upon an old and venerable figure. His basket was stored\r\nwith beautiful trouts, till the lid would not shut down. His grey hair\r\nclustered thick and bushily beneath his well-worn hat, as if it was\r\naccustomed to grow in the sun and the breeze, and to be “wet with the\r\ndews of heaven.” His features were such as the father of anglers himself\r\nmight have worn,--good; and apparently accustomed to express a mixed\r\nspirit of _bonhommie_ and simplicity, but were then sharpened into the\r\ndeepest intensity of an angler’s vigilant enjoyment. This, thought I, is\r\nsurely the man, and I asked him if he had read “Walton’s Complete\r\nAngler.” Yes, he had it, and he had Major’s new edition, too: and,\r\nturning to me with an air of immense knowingness and importance,\r\nsaid--“If he was alive now he could not take a single fin.” “No,” I\r\nreplied, “how is that? He _could_ take plenty in his day; and though I\r\ndo not deny that there may have been great improvement in the art, yet,\r\nskill _then_ successful would be equally so _now_, unless there has been\r\na revolution amongst the fish, and they have grown wiser. “Ay, there you\r\nhave it,” he added, the fish are wiser: they wont take the same baits.”\r\nI instinctively glanced at the bait then upon the hook of my oracle,\r\nand--heaven and earth! it was Walton’s favourite bait--the drake-fly. I\r\nwalked on. The romance of angling was destroyed. The glory, like a\r\nmorning dream, had passed away from the whole piscatorial race; and,\r\nfrom esteeming an angler after the fashion of Izaak Walton, I fell into\r\ngreat temptation of deeming him something worse than, as exhibited in\r\nSwift’s definition, “a stick and a string, a worm at one end and a fool\r\nat the other.”\r\n\r\n  _Nottingham._\r\n\r\n  W.

The journals\r\nteem with astonishing accounts--people wonder as they read--and, by and\r\nby, they will “wonder at their own wonder.” Perhaps the most interesting\r\naccount of his first appearance is the following:--\r\n\r\nHOT! HOT!--ALL HOT!\r\n\r\nMonsieur Chabert (the celebrated continental salamander) exhibited his\r\npower in withstanding the operation of the fiery element, at White\r\nConduit Gardens, yesterday evening (June 7, 1826). In the first\r\ninstance, he refreshed himself with a hearty meal of phosphorus, which\r\nwas, at his own request, supplied to him very liberally, by several of\r\nhis visiters, who were previously unacquainted with him. He washed down\r\nthis infernal fare with solutions of arsenic and oxalic acid, thus\r\nthrowing into the background the long-established fame of Mithridates.\r\nHe next swallowed with great _goût_ several spoonsful of boiling oil,\r\nand, as a dessert to this delicate repast, helped himself with his naked\r\nhand to a considerable quantity of molten lead. There are, we know,\r\npreparations which so indurate the cuticle as to render it insensible to\r\nthe heat either of boiling oil or melting lead, and the fatal qualities\r\nof certain poisons may be destroyed, if the medium through which they\r\nare imbibed, as we suppose to be the case here, is a strong alkali. We\r\ncannot, however, guess in what manner Monsieur Chabert effected this\r\nneutralization; and it is but fair to state, that the exhibitor offered\r\nto swallow Prussic acid, perhaps the most powerful of known poisons, the\r\neffect of which is instantaneous, if any good-natured person could\r\nfurnish him with a quantity of it. During the period when this part of\r\nthe entertainment (if entertainment it can be called) was going on, an\r\noven, about six feet by seven, was heated. For an hour and a quarter,\r\nlarge quantities of faggots were burnt in it, until at length it was hot\r\nenough for the bed-chamber of his Satanic Majesty. “O for a muse of\r\n_fire_!” to describe what followed. Monsieur Chabert, who seems to be a\r\npiece of living asbestos, entered this stove, accompanied by a\r\nrump-steak and a leg of lamb, when the heat was at about 220. He\r\nremained there, in the first instance, for ten minutes, till the steak\r\nwas properly done, conversing all the time with the company through a\r\ntin tube, placed in an orifice formed in the sheet-iron door of the\r\noven. Having swallowed a cup of tea, and having seen that the company\r\nhad done justice to the meat he had already cooked, he returned to his\r\nfiery den, and continued there until the lamb was properly done. This\r\njoint was devoured with such avidity by the spectators, as leads us to\r\nbelieve, that had Monsieur Chabert himself been sufficiently baked, they\r\nwould have proceeded to a Caribbean banquet. Many experiments, as to the\r\nextent to which the human frame could bear heat, without the destruction\r\nof the vital powers, have been tried from time to time; but so far as we\r\nrecollect, Monsieur Chabert’s fire-resisting qualities are greater than\r\nthose professed by the individuals who, before him, have undergone this\r\nspecies of ordeal. It was announced some time ago, in one of the French\r\njournals, that experiments had been tried with a female, whose\r\nfire-standing qualities had excited great astonishment. She, it appears,\r\nwas placed in a heated oven, into which, live dogs, cats, and rabbits,\r\nwere conveyed. The poor animals died, in a state of convulsion, almost\r\nimmediately, while the _fire queen_ bore the heat without complaining.\r\nIn that instance, however, the heat of the oven was not so great as that\r\nwhich Monsieur Chabert encountered. If Monsieur Chabert will attach\r\nhimself to any of the insurance companies, he will, we have no doubt,\r\n“save more goods out of the fire” than ever _Nimming Ned_ did.[207]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs regards the taking of poisons by this person, the “Morning Chronicle”\r\naccount says, “Monsieur Chabert’s first performance was the swallowing a\r\nquantity of phosphorus, which, we need not inform our readers, is one\r\nof the most violent poisons. Happening to stand near the exhibitor’s\r\ntable, he invited us to weigh out the phosphorus, and taste the _pure\r\nwater_ with which he washed down the aconite. We accordingly\r\nadministered to the gentleman a dose of sixty-four grains, enough, we\r\nimagine, to have proved a quietus to even Chuny himself. We observed,\r\nhowever, that the _pure water_ was strongly impregnated with an _alkali_\r\n(soda), and we need scarcely observe, that any of the fixed alkalies\r\nwould have the effect of neutralizing the phosphorus, and destroying its\r\npernicious effects in the stomach. There was a similar exhibition of\r\nswallowing a quantity of arsenic, some of which was fused over charcoal,\r\nto convince the bystanders, by the smell, that it was the real poison.\r\nTo us, however, it appeared that it was merely metallic arsenic, the\r\nswallowing of which might be done with impunity--at least, to the extent\r\nto which Monsieur Chabert received it into his stomach. We thought this\r\npart of the exhibition rather offensive and silly, for it was obvious\r\nthat the quality of the drugs, professed to be poison, was submitted to\r\nno fair test; and there were several links deficient in the chain of\r\nreasoning necessary to convince an intelligent person that the professed\r\nfeat was really performed.” Supposing this statement correct, there is\r\nnothing surprising in Monsieur Chabert’s trick.\r\n\r\n“But,” the same writer adds, “it was different with the pyrotechnic\r\nexhibition.--Monsieur Chabert first poured nitric acid upon metallic\r\nfilings, mixed (we suppose) with sulphur, to form pyrites; these he\r\nsuffered fairly to ignite in the palm of his hand, and retained the\r\nburning mass some time, although a small quantity ignited in our hand\r\nquickly made us glad to plunge it into water. Monsieur Chabert then\r\ndeliberately rubbed a hot shovel over his skin, through his hair, and\r\nfinally upon the tongue. This was very fairly done. The next feat was\r\nthat of swallowing boiling oil. We tried the thermometer in the oil, and\r\nfound it rose to 340 degrees. Monsieur Chabert swallowed a few table\r\nspoonsful of this burning liquid, which perhaps might have cooled to\r\nabout 320 degrees, between the taking the oil from the saucepan and the\r\nputting it into his mouth. A gentleman in the company came forward, and\r\ndropping lighted sealing-wax upon Monsieur Chabert’s tongue, took the\r\nimpression of his seal. This we suppose is what is called _sealing a\r\nman’s mouth_.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more astonishing in this than in the trick with the\r\npoisons. The little black-letter “Booke of Secretes of Albertus Magnus,\r\nimprinted at London by H. Iackson,” which discovers many “merveyls of\r\nthe world,” happens to be at hand, and two of them may throw some light\r\non the kind of means by which Monsieur Chabert performed his pyrotechnic\r\nexhibition; _viz._\r\n\r\n  1. _When thou wilt that thou seeme a inflamed, or set on fyre from thy\r\n  head unto thy fete and not be hurt._\r\n\r\n  Take white great malowes or holy-hocke, myxe them with the white of\r\n  egges; after anoynte thy body with it, and let it be untill it be\r\n  dryed up; and, after, anoynte the with alume, and afterwards caste on\r\n  it smal brymstone beaten unto poulder, for the fyre is inflamed on it,\r\n  and hurteth not; and if thou make upon the palme of thy hand thou\r\n  shalt bee able to hold the fyre without hurt.\r\n\r\n  2. _A merveylous experience, which maketh menne to go into the fyre\r\n  without hurte, or to bere fyre, or red hott yron in their hand,\r\n  withoute hurte._\r\n\r\n  Take the juyce of Bismalua, and the whyte of an egge, and the sede of\r\n  an hearbe called Psillium, also Pulicarius herba, and breake it unto\r\n  powder, and make a confection, and mixe the juyce of Radysh with the\r\n  whyte of an egge.\r\n\r\n  Anoynt thy body or hande with this confection, and let it be dryed and\r\n  after anoynte it againe; after that, thou mayest suffer boldely the\r\n  fyre without hurt.\r\n\r\nThis, without multiplying authorities, may suffice to show, that a man\r\nmay continue to work great marvels in the eyes of persons who are\r\nuninformed, by simple processes well known centuries ago. The editor of\r\nthe _Every-Day Book_ was once called on by a lady making tea, to hand\r\nthe boiling water in his “best manner:” he took the kettle from the\r\nfire, and placing its bottom on his right hand, bore it with extended\r\narm across the room to his fair requisionist, who very nearly went into\r\nfits, and some of the female part of the company fainted: they expected\r\nhis hand to be thoroughly burned; when, in fact, no other inconvenience\r\nwill result to any one who chooses to present a tea-kettle in that way\r\nthan the necessity of wiping the soil from the hand by a damp cloth.\r\nSome of the most common things are wonderful to those who have never\r\nseen them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to M. Chabert, the “Morning Chronicle” account says, “But now came\r\n_the grand and terrific exhibition_--_the entering the oven_--for which\r\nexpectation was excited to the highest pitch. We had the curiosity to\r\napply the unerring test of the thermometer to the inside of the oven,\r\nand found the maximum of heat to be 220 deg. M. Chabert, being dressed\r\nin a loose black linen robe, rendered, he assured us, as fireproof as\r\nasbestos, by a chemical solution, entered the oven amidst the applause\r\nof the spectators. He continued like a modern Shadrach in the fiery\r\nfurnace, and after a suspense of about 12 minutes, again appeared to the\r\nanxious spectators, triumphantly bearing the beef-steak fully dressed,\r\nwhich he had taken into the oven with him raw. M. Chabert also exhibited\r\nto us the thermometer, which he had taken into the oven with him at 60\r\ndeg., and which was now up to 590 deg. We need not say that _the bulb\r\nhad been kept in the burning embers_, of which it bore palpable signs.\r\nThis was a mere trick, unworthy of the exhibition, for Mons. Chabert\r\nreally bore the oven heated to 220 deg. for full twenty minutes. Whether\r\nwe were emulous of _Paul Pry_, and peeped under the iron door of the\r\noven, and beheld the beef-steak and leg of mutton cooking upon a heap of\r\ncharcoal and embers concealed in the corner of the oven, we must not\r\nsay, ‘it were too curious to consider matters after that manner.’ We are\r\nonly doing justice to Monsieur Chabert in saying, that he is the best of\r\nall fire-eaters we have yet seen, and that his performance is truly\r\nwonderful, and highly worthy of the public patronage. A man so\r\nimpervious to fire, may ‘make assurance doubly sure, and take a bond of\r\nfate.’”\r\n\r\nStay, stay! Not quite so fast. M. Chabert is a man of tricks, but his\r\nonly real trick failed to deceive; this was placing the bulb of the\r\nthermometer in burning embers, to get the mercury up to 590, while, in\r\nfact, the heat he really bore in the oven was only 220; which, as he\r\nbore that heat for “full twenty minutes,” the writer quoted deems\r\n“really wonderful.” That it was not wonderful for such an exhibitor to\r\nendure such a heat, will appear from the following statements.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January, 1774, Dr. Charles Blagden, F.R.S., received\r\nan invitation from Dr. George Fordyce, to observe the effects of air\r\nheated to a much higher degree than it was formerly thought any living\r\ncreature could bear. Dr. Fordyce had himself proved the mistake of Dr.\r\nBoerhaave and most other authors, by supporting many times very high\r\ndegrees of heat, in the course of a long train of important experiments.\r\nDr. Cullen had long before suggested many arguments to show, that life\r\nitself had a power of generating heat, independent of any common\r\nchemical or mechanical means. Governor Ellis in the year 1758 had\r\nobserved, that a man could live in air of a greater heat than that of\r\nhis body; and that the body, in this situation, continues its own cold;\r\nand the abbé Chappe d’Auteroche had written that the Russians used their\r\nbaths heated to 60 deg. of Reaumur’s thermometer, about 160 of\r\nFahrenheit’s. With a view to add further evidence to these extraordinary\r\nfacts, and to ascertain the real effects of such great degrees of heat\r\non the human body, Dr. Fordyce tried various experiments in heated\r\nchambers without chimneys, and from whence the external air was\r\nexcluded. One of these experiments is thus related.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. Blagden’s Narrative._\r\n\r\nThe honourable captain Phipps, Mr. (afterwards sir Joseph) Banks, Dr.\r\nSolander, and myself, attended Dr. Fordyce to the heated chamber, which\r\nhad served for many of his experiments with dry air. We went in without\r\ntaking off any of our clothes. It was an oblong square room, fourteen\r\nfeet by twelve is length and width, and eleven in height, heated by a\r\nround stove, or cockle, of cast iron, which stood in the middle, with a\r\ntube for the smoke carried from it through one of the side walls. When\r\nwe first entered the room, about two o’clock in the afternoon, the\r\nquicksilver in a thermometer, which had been suspended there stood\r\nabove the 150th degree. By placing several thermometers in different\r\nparts of the room we afterwards found, that the heat was a little\r\ngreater in some places than in others; but that the whole difference\r\nnever exceeded 20 deg. We continued in the room above 20 minutes, in\r\nwhich time the heat had risen about 12 deg., chiefly during the first\r\npart of our stay. Within an hour afterwards we went into this room\r\nagain, without seeing any material difference, though the heat was\r\nconsiderably increased. Upon entering the room a third time, between\r\nfive and six o’clock after dinner, we observed the quicksilver in our\r\nonly remaining thermometer at 198 deg.; this great heat had so warped\r\nthe ivory frames of our other thermometers, that every one of them was\r\nbroken. We now staid in the room, all together, about 10 minutes; but\r\nfinding that the thermometer sunk very fast, it was agreed, that for the\r\nfuture only one person should go in at a time, and orders were given to\r\nraise the fire as much as possible. Soon afterwards Dr. Solander entered\r\nthe room alone, and saw the thermometer at 210 deg., but, during three\r\nminutes that he staid there, it sunk to 196 deg. Another time, he found\r\nit almost five minutes before the heat was lessened from 210 deg., to\r\n196 deg. Mr. Banks closed the whole, by going in when the thermometer\r\nstood above 211 deg.; he remained seven minutes, in which time the\r\nquicksilver had sunk to 198 deg.; but cold air had been let into the\r\nroom by a person who went in and came out again during Mr. Banks’s stay.\r\nThe air heated to these high degrees felt unpleasantly hot, but was very\r\nbearable. Our most uneasy feeling was a sense of scorching on the face\r\nand legs: our legs, particularly, suffered very much, by being exposed\r\nmore fully than any other part to the body of the stove, heated red-hot\r\nby the fire within. Our respiration was not at all affected; it became\r\nneither quick nor laborious; the only difference was a want of that\r\nrefreshing sensation which accompanies a full inspiration of cool air.\r\nOur time was so taken up with other observations, that we did not count\r\nour pulses by the watch: mine, to the best of my judgment by feeling it,\r\nbeat at the rate of 100 pulsations in a minute, near the end of the\r\nfirst experiment; and Dr. Solander’s made 92 pulsations in a minute,\r\nsoon after we had gone out of the heated room. Mr. Banks sweated\r\nprofusely, but no one else: my shirt was only damp at the end of the\r\nexperiment. But the most striking effects proceeded from our power of\r\npreserving our natural temperature. Being now in a situation in which\r\nour bodies bore a very different relation to the surrounding atmosphere\r\nfrom that to which we had been accustomed, every moment presented a new\r\nphenomenon. Whenever we breathed on a thermometer, the quicksilver sunk\r\nseveral degrees. Every expiration, particularly if made with any degree\r\nof violence, gave a very pleasant impression of coolness to our\r\nnostrils, scorched just before by the hot air rushing against them when\r\nwe inspired. In the same manner our now cold breath agreeably cooled our\r\nfingers, whenever it reached them. Upon touching my side, it felt cold\r\nlike a corpse; and yet the actual heat of my body, tried under my\r\ntongue, and by applying closely the thermometer to my skin, was 98 deg.,\r\nabout a degree higher than its ordinary temperature. When the heat of\r\nthe air began to approach the highest degree which the apparatus was\r\ncapable of producing, our bodies in the room prevented it from rising\r\nany higher; and, when it had been previously raised above that point,\r\ninevitably sunk it. Every experiment furnished proofs of this: towards\r\nthe end of the first, the thermometer was stationary: in the second, it\r\nsunk a little during the short time we staid in the room: in the third,\r\nit sunk so fast as to oblige us to determine that only one person should\r\ngo in at a time; and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander each found, that his\r\nsingle body was sufficient to sink the quicksilver very fast, when the\r\nroom was brought nearly to its maximum of heat.\r\n\r\nThese experiments, therefore, prove in the clearest manner, that the\r\nbody has a power of destroying heat. To speak justly on this subject, we\r\nmust call it a power of destroying a certain degree of heat communicated\r\nwith certain quickness. Therefore, in estimating the heat which we are\r\ncapable of resisting, it is necessary to take into consideration not\r\nonly what degree of heat would be communicated to our bodies, if they\r\npossessed no resisting power, by the heated body, before the equilibrium\r\nof heat was effected; but also what time that heat would take in\r\npassing from the heated body into our bodies. In consequence of this\r\ncompound limitation of our resisting power, we bear very different\r\ndegrees of heat in different mediums. The same person who felt no\r\ninconvenience from air heated to 211 deg. could not bear quicksilver at\r\n120 deg. and could just bear rectified spirit of wine at 130 deg. that\r\nis, quicksilver heated to 120 deg. furnished, in a given time, more heat\r\nfor the living powers to destroy, than spirits heated to 130 deg. or air\r\nto 211 deg. And we had, in the heated room where our experiments were\r\nmade, a striking, though familiar instance of the same. All the pieces\r\nof metal there, even our watch-chains, felt so hot that we could\r\nscarcely bear to touch them for a moment, whilst the air, from which the\r\nmetal had derived all its heat, was only unpleasant. The slowness with\r\nwhich air communicates its heat was further shown, in a remarkable\r\nmanner, by the thermometers we brought with us into the room; none of\r\nwhich, at the end of twenty minutes, in the first experiment, had\r\nacquired the real heat of the air by several degrees. It might be\r\nsupposed, that by an action so very different from that to which we are\r\naccustomed, as destroying a large quantity of heat, instead of\r\ngenerating it, we must have been greatly disordered. And indeed we\r\nexperienced some inconvenience; our hands shook very much, and we felt a\r\nconsiderable degree of languor and debility; I had also a noise and\r\ngiddiness in my head. But it was only a small part of our bodies that\r\nexcited the power of destroying heat with such a violent effort as seems\r\nnecessary at first sight. Our clothes, contrived to guard us from cold,\r\nguarded us from the heat on the same principles. Underneath we were\r\nsurrounded with an atmosphere of air, cooled on one side to 98 deg. by\r\nbeing in contact with our bodies, and on the other side heated very\r\nslowly, because woollen is such a bad conductor of heat. Accordingly I\r\nfound, toward the end of the first experiment, that a thermometer put\r\nunder my clothes, but not in contact with my skin, sunk down to 110 deg.\r\nOn this principle it was that the animals, subjected by M. Tillet to the\r\ninteresting experiments related in the “Memoirs of the Academy of\r\nSciences” for the year 1764, bore the oven so much better when they\r\nwere clothed, than when they were put in bare: the heat actually\r\napplied to the greatest part of their bodies was considerably less in\r\nthe first case than in the last. As animals can destroy only a certain\r\nquantity of heat in a given time, so the time they can continue the full\r\nexertion of this destroying power seems to be also limited; which may be\r\none reason why we can bear for a certain time, and much longer than can\r\nbe necessary to fully heat the cuticle, a degree of heat which will at\r\nlength prove intolerable. Probably both the power of destroying heat,\r\nand the time for which it can be exerted, may be increased, like most\r\nother faculties of the body, by frequent exercise. It might be partly on\r\nthis principle, that, in M. Tillet’s experiments, the girls, who had\r\nbeen used to attend the oven, bore, for ten minutes, an heat which would\r\nraise Fahrenheit’s thermometer to 280 deg.

Between the above-named hours, on the three\r\nfirst Sundays of this month, and the two last of the preceding, you may\r\n(weather willing) gladden your gaze with such a galaxy of beauty and\r\nfashion (I beg to be pardoned for the repetition, for fashion _is_\r\nbeauty) as no other period or place, Almack’s itself not excepted, can\r\nboast: for there is no denying that the fair rulers over this last-named\r\nrendezvous of the regular troops of _bon ton_ are somewhat too\r\n_recherchée_ in their requirements. The truth is, that though the said\r\nrulers will not for a moment hesitate to patronise the above proposition\r\nunder its simple form, they entirely object to that subtle\r\ninterpretation of it which their sons and nephews would introduce, and\r\non which interpretation the sole essential difference between the two\r\nassemblies depends. In fact, at Almack’s fashion is beauty; but at\r\nKensington Gardens beauty and fashion are one. At any rate, those who\r\nhave not been present at the latter place during the period above\r\nreferred to, have not seen the finest sight (with one exception) that\r\nEngland has to offer.\r\n\r\nVauxhall Gardens, which open the first week in this month, are somewhat\r\ndifferent from the above, it must be confessed. But they are unique in\r\ntheir way nevertheless. Seen in the darkness of noonday, as one passes\r\nby them on the top of the Portsmouth coach, they cut a sorry figure\r\nenough. But beneath the full meridian of midnight, what is like them,\r\nexcept some parts of the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments? Now, after the\r\nfirst few nights, they begin to be in their glory, and are, on every\r\nsuccessive gala, illuminated with “ten thousand _additional_ lamps,” and\r\ninclude all the particular attractions of every preceding gala since the\r\nbeginning of time!\r\n\r\nNow, on fine evenings, the sunshine finds (or rather loses) its way into\r\nthe galleries of Summer theatres at whole price, and wonders where it\r\nhas got to.\r\n\r\nNow, boarding-school boys, in the purlieus of Paddington and Mile End,\r\nemploy the whole of the first week in writing home to their distant\r\nfriends in London a letter of not less than eight lines, announcing\r\nthat the “ensuing vacation will commence on the ---- instant;” and\r\noccupy the remaining fortnight in trying to find out the unknown\r\nnumerals with which the blank has been filled up.\r\n\r\nFinally, now, during the first few days, you cannot walk the streets\r\nwithout waiting, at every crossing, for the passage of whole regiments\r\nof little boys in leather breeches, and little girls in white aprons,\r\ngoing to church to practise their annual anthem-singing, preparatory to\r\nthat particular Thursday in this month, which is known all over the\r\nworld of charity-schools by the name of “walking day;” when their little\r\nvoices, ten thousand strong, are to utter forth sounds that shall dwell\r\nfor ever in the hearts of their hearers. Those who have seen this sight,\r\nof all the charity children within the bills of mortality assembled\r\nbeneath the dome of Saint Paul’s, and heard the sounds of thanksgiving\r\nand adoration which they utter there, have seen and heard what is\r\nperhaps better calculated than anything human ever was, to convey to the\r\nimagination a faint notion of what we expect to witness hereafter, when\r\nthe hosts of heaven shall utter with _one voice_, hymns of adoration\r\nbefore the footstool of the Most High[209].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTWILIGHT.\r\n\r\n    How fine to view the Sun’s departing ray\r\n    Fling back a lingering lovely after-day;\r\n    The moon of summer glides serenely by,\r\n    And sheds a light enchantment o’er the sky.\r\n    These, sweetly mingling, pour upon the sight\r\n    A pencilled shadowing, and a dewy light--\r\n    A softened day, a half unconscious night.\r\n    Alas! too finely pure on earth to stay,\r\n    It faintly spots the hill, and dies away.\r\n\r\n  _Thatcham._\r\n\r\n  J. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER FOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nIt seems seasonable to introduce an engraving of a very appropriate\r\nornament of a shop window, which will not surprise any one so much as\r\nthe proprietor, who, whatever may be thought to the contrary, is wholly\r\nunknown to the editor of this work.\r\n\r\nAs a summer decoration, there is scarcely any thing prettier than this\r\nlittle fountain. Gilt fish on the edge of the lower basin spout jets of\r\nwater into the upper one, which constantly overflows, and, washing the\r\nmoss on its stand, falls into its first receiver. These vessels are of\r\nglass, and contain live fish; and on the surface of the larger, white\r\nwaxen swans continue in gentle motion. Vases of flowers and other\r\nelegancies are its surrounding accompaniments.\r\n\r\nThis representation exemplifies the rivalry of London tradesmen to\r\nattract attention. Their endeavours have not attained the height they\r\nare capable of reaching, but the beautiful forms and graceful displays\r\ncontinually submitted to the sight of passengers, evince a disposition\r\nwhich renders our shops the most elegant in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~A Fountain in June, 1826.~\r\n\r\n_In the window of Mr. Farrel, Pastrycook, Lambs-Conduit-Street,\r\nLondon._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·15.\r\n\r\n  [209] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 10.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF GOD, NEWCASTLE.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, 1412, King Henry IV. granted his royal license to\r\nan hospital called the _Maison de Dieu_, or “House of God,” erected by\r\nRoger Thornton, on the Sandhill, Newcastle, for the purpose of providing\r\ncertain persons with food and clothing.

Before it was pulled down in 1823, the\r\n“Merchant’s Court” was established over it, and at this time a new\r\nbuilding for the company of Free Merchants, &c., is erected on its site.\r\n\r\nThe son of the founder of the old hospital granted the use of its hall\r\nand kitchen “for a young couple when they were married to make their\r\nwedding dinner in, and receive the offerings and gifts of their friends,\r\nfor at that time houses were not large.” Mr. Sykes, in his interesting\r\nvolume of “Local Records,” remarks, that “this appears an ancient custom\r\nfor the encouragement of matrimony.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·37.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 11.~\r\n\r\nBLESSINGS OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n    Hast thou e’er seen a garden clad\r\n    In all the robes that Eden had;\r\n    Or vale o’erspread with streams and trees,\r\n    A paradise of mysteries;\r\n    Plains with green hills adorning them,\r\n    Like jewels in a diadem?\r\n\r\n    These gardens, vales, and plains, and hills,\r\n    Which beauty gilds and music fills,\r\n    Were once but deserts.

The sheep-shearings are the\r\nonly _stated_ periods of the year at which we hear of festivities, and\r\ngatherings together of the lovers and practisers of English husbandry;\r\nfor even the harvest-home itself is fast sinking into disuse, as a\r\nscene of mirth and revelry, from the want of being duly encouraged and\r\npartaken in by the great ones of the earth; without whose countenance\r\nand example it is questionable whether eating, drinking, and sleeping,\r\nwould not soon become vulgar practices, and be discontinued accordingly!\r\nIn a state of things like this, the Holkham and Woburn sheep-shearings\r\ndo more honour to their promoters than all their wealth can purchase and\r\nall their titles convey. But we are getting beyond our soundings:\r\nhonours, titles, and “states of things,” are what we do not pretend to\r\nmeddle with, especially when the pretty sights and sounds preparatory to\r\nand attendant on sheep-shearing, as a mere rural employment, are waiting\r\nto be noticed.\r\n\r\nNow, then, on the first really summer’s day, the whole flock being\r\ncollected on the higher bank of the pool formed at the abrupt winding of\r\nthe nameless mill-stream, at the point, perhaps, where the little wooden\r\nbridge runs slantwise across it, and the attendants being stationed\r\nwaist-deep in the midwater, the sheep are, after a silent but obstinate\r\nstruggle or two, plunged headlong, one by one, from the precipitous\r\nbank; when, after a moment of confused splashing, their heavy fleeces\r\nfloat them along, and their feet, moving by an instinctive art which\r\nevery creature but man possesses, guide them towards the opposite\r\nshallows, that steam and glitter in the sunshine. Midway, however, they\r\nare fain to submit to the rude grasp of the relentless washer, which\r\nthey undergo with as ill a grace as preparatory schoolboys do the same\r\noperation. Then, gaining the opposite shore heavily, they stand for a\r\nmoment till the weight of water leaves them, and, shaking their\r\nstreaming sides, go bleating away towards their fellows on the adjacent\r\ngreen, wondering within themselves what has happened.\r\n\r\nThe shearing is no less lively and picturesque, and no less attended by\r\nall the idlers of the village as spectators. The shearers, seated in\r\nrows beside the crowded pens, with the seemingly inanimate load of\r\nfleece in their laps, and bending intently over their work; the\r\noccasional whetting and clapping of the shears; the neatly-attired\r\nhousewives, waiting to receive the fleeces; the smoke from the\r\ntar-kettle, ascending through the clear air; the shorn sheep escaping,\r\none by one, from their temporary bondage, and trotting away towards\r\ntheir distant brethren, bleating all the while for their lambs, that do\r\nnot know them; all this, with its ground of universal green, and\r\nfinished every-where by its leafy distances, except where the village\r\nspire intervenes, forms together a living picture, pleasanter to look\r\nupon than words can speak, but still pleasanter to think of, when _that_\r\nis the nearest approach you can make to it.[210]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn this day, in the year 1734, the duke of Berwick, while visiting the\r\ntrenches at the siege of Philipsburgh, near Spire, in Germany, was\r\nkilled, standing between his two sons by a cannon-ball. He was the\r\nillegitimate son of the duke of York, afterwards James II., whom he\r\naccompanied in his flight from England, in 1688. His mother was Arabella\r\nChurchill, maid of honour to the duchess of York, and sister to the\r\nrenowned Marlborough.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Berwick on quitting the country, entered into the service of\r\nFrance, and was engaged in several battles against the English or their\r\nallies in Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. At his death he\r\nwas in the sixty-fourth year of his age. No general of his time excelled\r\nhim in the art of war except his uncle, the duke of Marlborough.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·40.\r\n\r\n  [210] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n  [211] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 13.~\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS\r\n\r\n“Of the Times,”\r\n\r\nNEW AND OLD.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Liverpool, 6th June, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The pages of _The Every-Day Book_, notwithstanding a few\r\nexceptions, have afforded me unqualified pleasure, and having observed\r\nyour frequent and reiterated requests for communications, I have been\r\ninduced to send you the following doggrels.\r\n\r\nI ought to promise that they formed part of the sign of an alehouse,\r\nformerly standing in Chapel-street, near St. Nicholas church in this\r\ntown, but which is now taken down to make room for a costly pile of\r\nwarehouses since erected on the site.\r\n\r\nThe sign represented (_elegantly_, of course) a man standing in a cart\r\nladen with fish, and holding in his right hand what the artist intended\r\nto represent a salmon. The lines are to be supposed to be spoken by the\r\ndriver:--\r\n\r\n    This salmon has got a tail\r\n    It’s very like a whale,\r\n    It’s a fish that’s very merry,\r\n    They say it’s catch’d at Derry;\r\n    It’s a fish that’s got a heart,\r\n    It’s catch’d and put in Dugdale’s cart.\r\n\r\nThis truly classic production of the muse of Mersey continued for\r\nseveral years to adorn the host’s door, until a change in the occupant\r\nof the house induced a corresponding change of the sign, and the\r\nfollowing lines graced the sign of “The Fishing Smack:”--\r\n\r\n    The cart and salmon has stray’d away,\r\n    And left the fishing-boat to stay.\r\n    When boisterous winds do drive you back,\r\n    Come in and drink at the Fishing Smack.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am upon the subject of “signs,” I cannot omit mentioning a\r\npunning one in the adjoining county (Chester) on the opposite side of\r\nthe Mersey, by the highway-side, leading from Liscard to Wallasea.

I recollect\r\nhim myself, and once saw the present venerable Earl of Fitzwilliam, on\r\nStamford race-course, humorously inquire of him how he got his\r\nconveyance, in allusion to the undermentioned circumstance, and present\r\nhim with a guinea.--I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  BENJ. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nJohn Kilburn, a person well known on the turf as a list seller, &c., was\r\nat a town in Bedfordshire, and, as the turf phrase is, “quite broke\r\ndown.” It was during harvest, and the week before Richmond races\r\n(Yorkshire), whither he was travelling, and near which place he was\r\nborn: to arrive there in time he hit on the following expedient.--He\r\napplied to an acquaintance of his, a blacksmith, to stamp on a padlock\r\nthe words ‘Richmond Gaol,’ with which, and a chain fixed to one of his\r\nlegs, he composedly went into a corn-field to sleep. As he expected, he\r\nwas soon apprehended and taken before a magistrate, who, after some\r\ndeliberation, ordered two constables to guard him in a carriage to\r\nRichmond. No time was to be lost, for Kilburn said he had not been\r\ntried, and hoped they would not let him lay till another assize. The\r\nconstables, on their arrival at the gaol, accosted the keeper with\r\n“Sir, do you know this man?” “Yes, very well, it is Kilburn; I have\r\nknown him many years.” “We suppose he has broken out of your gaol, as he\r\nhas a chain and padlock on with your mark. Is not he a prisoner?” “I\r\nnever heard any harm of him in my life.” “Nor,” says Kilburn, “have\r\nthese gentlemen: Sir, they have been so good as to bring me out of\r\nBedfordshire, and I will not put them to further inconvenience. I have\r\ngot the key of the padlock, and I will not trouble them to unlock it. I\r\nam obliged to them for their kind behaviour.” He travelled in this way\r\nabout one hundred and seventy miles.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote has been seen before, perhaps, but it is now given on\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·67.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER MERRIMENT.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--You have inserted in vol. i. p. 559, an interesting account of the\r\n_Morris Dance_ in the “olden times,” and I was rather disappointed on a\r\nperusal of your extensive Index, by not finding a “few more words”\r\nrespecting the Morris Dancers of our day and generation. I think this\r\ncustom is of Moorish origin, and might have been introduced into this\r\ncountry in the middle ages. Bailey says, “the Morris Dance is an antic\r\ndance performed by five men and a boy, dressed in girl’s clothes.” The\r\ngirlish part of it is, however, more honoured in “the breach than the\r\nobservance.”\r\n\r\nIn June, 1826, I observed a company of these “bold peasantry, the\r\ncountry’s pride,” in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell. They consisted of\r\neight young men, six of whom were dancers; the seventh played the pipe\r\nand tabor; and the eighth, the head of them, collected the pence in his\r\nhat, and put the precious metal into the slit of a tin painted box,\r\nunder lock and key, suspended before him. The tune the little\r\nrural-noted pipe played to the gentle pulsations of the tabor, is called\r\n\r\n    “Moll in the wad and I fell out,\r\n    And what d’ye think it was about”\r\n\r\nThis may be remembered as one of the once popular street songs of the\r\nlate Charles Dibdin’s composition. The dancers wore party-coloured\r\nribands round their hats, arms, and knees, to which a row of small\r\nlatten bells were appended, somewhat like those which are given to amuse\r\ninfants in teeth-cutting, that tinkled with the motion of the wearers.\r\nThese rustic adventurers “upon the many-headed town,” came from a\r\nvillage in Hertfordshire. Truly natural and simple in appearance, their\r\nfeatures, complexion, dress, and attitude, perfectly corresponded. Here\r\nwas no disguise, no blandishment, no superhuman effort. Their shape was\r\nnot compressed by fashion, nor did their hearts flutter in an artificial\r\nprison. Nature represented them about twenty-five years of age, as her\r\nseasoned sons, handing down to posterity, by their exercises before the\r\npresent race, the enjoyment of their forefathers, and the tradition of\r\nhappy tenantry “ere power grew high, and times grew bad.” The “set-to,”\r\nas they termed it, expressed a vis-à-vis address; they then turned,\r\nreturned, clapped their hands before and behind, and made a jerk with\r\nthe knee and foot alternately,\r\n\r\n    “Till toe and heel no longer moved.”\r\n\r\nThough the streets were dirty and the rain fell reluctantly, yet they\r\nheeded not the elemental warfare, but\r\n\r\n    “Danced and smiled, and danced and smiled again:”\r\n\r\nhence their ornaments, like themselves, looked weather-beaten. Crowds\r\ncollected round them. At 12 o’clock at noon, this was a rare opportunity\r\nfor the schoolboys let out of their seats of learning and confinement.\r\nThe occasional huzza, like Handel’s “Occasional Overture,” so pleasing\r\nto the ear of liberty, almost drowned the “Morris.” But at intervals the\r\nlittle pretty pipe drew the fancy, as it were, piping to a flock in the\r\nvalley by the shade of sweet trees and the bosom of the silver brook. O!\r\nmethought, what difference is here by comparison with the agile-limbed\r\naërials of St. James’s and these untutored clowns! Yet something\r\ndelightful comes home to the breast, and speaks to the memory of a\r\nrural-born creature, and recals a thousand dear recollections of hours\r\ngone down the voyage of life into eternity! To a Londoner, too, the\r\nnovelty does not weary by its voluntary offering to their taste, and\r\napposition to the season.\r\n\r\nLubin Brown, the piper, was an arch dark-featured person; his ear was\r\nalive to Doric melody; and he merrily played and tickled the time to his\r\nnote. When he stopped to take breath, his provincial dialect scattered\r\nhis wit among the gapers, and his companions were well pleased with\r\ntheir sprightly leader. Spagnioletti, nor Cramer, could do no more by\r\nsound nor Liston, nor Yates, by grimace. I observed his eye ever alert\r\nto the movement and weariness of his six choice youths. He was a\r\nchivalrous fellow: he had won the prize for “grinning through a horse\r\ncollar” at the revel, thrown his antagonist in the “wrestling ring,” and\r\n“jumped twenty yards in a sack” to the mortification of his rivals, who\r\nlay vanquished on the green. The box-keeper, though less dignified than\r\nMr. Spring, of Drury-lane, informed me that “he and his companions in\r\nsport” had charmed the village lasses round the maypole, and they\r\nintended sojourning in town a week or two, after which the box would be\r\nopened, and an equitable division take place, previously to the\r\ncommencement of mowing and hay-harvest. He said it was the third year of\r\ntheir pilgrimage; that they had never disputed on the road, and were\r\nwelcomed home by their sweethearts and friends, to whom they never omit\r\nthe carrying a seasonable gift in a very humble “Forget me not!” or\r\n“Friendship’s Offering.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Editor, I subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n  Yours, very sincerely.\r\n\r\n  J.

Among the “Original Papers,” published by Macpherson, is a letter\r\nof the duke’s to king James II., whom he “deserted in his utmost need”\r\nfor the service of king William, wherein he betrays to his old master\r\nthe design of his new one against Brest in 1694. This communication, if\r\nintercepted, might have terminated the duke’s career, and we should\r\nhave heard nothing of his “wars in Flanders.” It appears, further, that\r\nthe duke’s intrigues were suspected by king William, and were the real\r\ngrounds of his imprisonment in the Tower two years before.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·12.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 17.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. BOTOLPH.\r\n\r\nThis English saint, whose festival is on this day, with his brother\r\nAdulph, another saint, travelled into Belgic Gaul, where Adulph became\r\nbishop of Maestricht, and Botolph returned home with news of the\r\nreligious houses he had seen abroad, and recommendations from the two\r\nsisters of Ethelmund, king of the south Saxons, who resided in France,\r\nto their brother in England. Ethelmund gave him a piece of land near\r\nLincoln, called Icanhoe, “a forsaken uninhabited desert, where nothing\r\nbut devills and goblins were thought to dwell: but St. Botolphe, with\r\nthe virtue and sygne of the holy crosse, freed it from the possession of\r\nthose hellish inhabitants, and by the means and help of Ethelmund, built\r\na monasterie therein.” Of this establishment of the order of St.\r\nBenedict, St. Botolph became abbot. He died on this day in June, 680,\r\nand was buried in his monastery, which is presumed by some to have been\r\nat Botolph’s bridge, now called Bottle-bridge, in Huntingdonshire; by\r\nothers, at Botolph’s town, now corruptly called Boston in Lincolnshire;\r\nand again, its situation is said to have been towards Sussex. Boston\r\nseems, most probably, to have been the site of his edifice.\r\n\r\nSt. Botolph’s monastery having been destroyed by the Danes, his relics\r\nwere in part carried to the monastery of Ely, and part to that of\r\nThorney. Alban Butler, who affirms this, afterwards observes that\r\nThorney Abbey, situated in Cambridgeshire, founded in 972, in honour of\r\nSt. Mary and St. Botolph, was one of those whose abbots sat in\r\nparliament, that St. Botolph was interred there, and that Thorney was\r\nanciently called Ancarig, that is, the Isle of Anchorets. It may here be\r\nremarked, however, that Westminster was anciently called Thorney, from\r\nits having been covered by briars; and that the last-written “History of\r\nBoston” refers to Capgrave, as saying, “that in the book of the church\r\nof St. Botolph, near Aldersgate, London, there is mention how a part of\r\nthe body of St. Botolph was, by king Edward of happy memory, conferred\r\non the church of St. Peter in _Westminster_.” Father Porter, in his\r\n“Flowers of the Saincts,” says, “it hath been found written in the booke\r\nof St. Botolphe’s church, near Aldersgate, in London, that part of his\r\nholy bodie was by king Edward given to the abbey of _Winchester_.” The\r\neditor of the _Every-Day Book_ possessed “the register book of the\r\nchurch of St. Botolph, near Aldersgate,” when he wrote on “Ancient\r\nMysteries,” in which work the manuscript is described: it wanted some\r\nleaves, and neither contained the entry mentioned by Capgrave, nor\r\nmentioned the disposition of the relics of St. Botolph. Besides the\r\nplaces already noticed, various others throughout the country are named\r\nafter St. Botolph, and particularly four parishes of the city of London,\r\nnamely, in Aldersgate before mentioned, Aldgate, Billingsgate, and\r\nBishopsgate. Butler says nothing of his miracles, but Father Porter\r\nmentions him as having been “famous for miracles both in this life and\r\nafter his death.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY’S DRESS IN 1550.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman whose museum furnished the Biddenden cake, obligingly\r\ntransmits an extract from some papers in his collection, relative to a\r\nwedding on this day.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--Perhaps the following account of the dresses of a lady in olden\r\ntime may be interesting to your readers:--\r\n\r\nThe wedding-clothes of Miss Eliz.

He was born at Cork, in 1727, and educated in\r\nthe college of St. Omers, till his 18th year, and was at the head of the\r\nLatin class when he quitted the school. He was likewise well acquainted\r\nwith the Greek language. On his return to Ireland he was sent to London,\r\nand placed under the protection of a mercantile relation; but literature\r\nand the stage soon drew his attention, and wholly absorbed his mind. The\r\nsuccess of his first tragedy, “The Orphan of China,” enabled him to\r\ndischarge some pecuniary obligations he had incurred, and he made\r\nseveral attempts to acquire reputation as an actor; but, though he\r\ndisplayed judgment, he wanted powers, and was brutally attacked by\r\nChurchill, from motives of party prejudice. Mr. Murphy in a very\r\nhumorous ode to the naiads of Fleet-ditch, intituled “Expostulation,”\r\nvindicated his literary character. He withdrew from the stage, studied\r\nthe law, made two attempts to become a member of the Temple and of\r\nGray’s-inn, and was rejected, on the illiberal plea that he had been\r\nupon the stage. More elevated sentiments in the members of Lincoln’s-inn\r\nadmitted him to the bar, but the dramatic muse so much engaged his\r\nattention, that the law was a secondary consideration. He wrote\r\ntwenty-two pieces for the stage, most of which were successful, and\r\nseveral are stock pieces. He first started into the literary world with\r\na series of essays, intituled “The Gray’s-inn Journal.” At one period he\r\nwas a political writer, though without putting his name to his\r\nproductions. He produced a Latin version of “The Temple of Fame,” and of\r\nGray’s “Elegy,” and a well-known translation of the works of Tacitus. He\r\nwas the intimate of Foote and Garrick, whose life he wrote. He had many\r\nsquabbles with contemporary wits, particularly the late George Steevens,\r\nEsq.; but, though he never quietly received a blow, he was never the\r\nfirst to give one. Steevens’s attack he returned with abundant interest.\r\nHis friend Mr. Jesse Foot, whom he appointed his executor, and to whom\r\nhe entrusted all his manuscripts, says, “He lived in the closest\r\nfriendship with the most polished authors and greatest lawyers of his\r\ntime; his knowledge of the classics was profound; his translations of\r\nthe Roman historians enlarged his fame; his dramatic productions were\r\ninferior to none of the time in which he flourished. The pen of the poet\r\nwas particularly adorned by the refined taste of the critic. He was\r\nauthor of ‘The Orphan of China,’ ‘The Grecian Daughter,’ ‘All in the\r\nWrong,’ ‘The Way to keep Him,’ ‘Know your own Mind,’ ‘Three Weeks after\r\nMarriage,’ ‘The Apprentice,’ ‘The Citizen,’ and many other esteemed\r\ndramatic productions.” He had a pension of 200_l._ a year from\r\ngovernment during the last three years of his life; and was a\r\ncommissioner of bankrupts. His manners were urbane, and if he sometimes\r\nshowed warmth of temper, his heart was equally warm towards his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 60·17.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1826.--GENERAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nThe united kingdom may be said to be in uproar, wherever the electors\r\nare solicited for their “sweet voices.” One place latterly seems to be\r\nwithout a candidate; viz. “the ancient and honorable borough of\r\nGarrett,” situate near the Leather Bottle in Garrett Lane, in the parish\r\nof Wandsworth, in the county of Surrey.

Mosley, “from an original painting taken on the spot by\r\nDavid Ogborne,” which print represents the procession of the\r\nlast-mentioned claimants on their return from Dunmow church with the\r\nflitch.\r\n\r\nOgborne’s print, from whence the preceding engraving is taken, bears\r\nthis inscription:--\r\n\r\n“An exact Perspective View of DUNMOW, late the Priory in the county of\r\nEssex, with a Representation of the Ceremony & Procession in that\r\nMannor, on Thursday the 20 of June 1751 when _Thomas Shakeshaft_ of the\r\nParish of Weathersfield in the county aforesaid, Weaver, & _Ann_ his\r\nWife came to demand and did actually receive a Gammon of Bacon, having\r\nfirst kneelt down upon two bare stones within the Church door, and taken\r\nthe said Oath pursuant to the ancient custom in manner & form prescribed\r\nas aforesaid.” A short account of this custom precedes the above\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand speaks of his possessing Ogborne’s print, and of its having\r\nbecome “exceedingly rare;” he further cites it as being inscribed “Taken\r\non the spot and engraved by David Ogborne.” Herein he mistakes; for, as\r\nregards Ogborne, both old and modern impressions are inscribed as\r\nalready quoted in the preceding column: in the old impression “C. Mosley\r\nsculp^{t}.” stands below “the oath” in verse, at the right hand corner\r\nof the _plate_; and in the modern one it is erased from that part and\r\nplaced at the same corner above “the oath,” and immediately under the\r\nengraving; the space it occupied is supplied by the words “Republish’d\r\nOct^{r} 28^{th}. 1826 by R. Cribb, 288 Holborn”: its original note of\r\npublication remains, viz. “Publish’d according to Act of Parliament\r\nJan^{ry}. 1752.” The print is now common.\r\n\r\nMr. Brand, or his printer, further mistakes the name of the claimant on\r\nthe print, for, in the “Popular Antiquities” he quotes it “Sha_p_eshaft”\r\ninstead of “Sha_k_eshaft;” and he omits to mention a larger print, of\r\ngreater rarity in his time, “sold by John Bowles Map & Printseller in\r\nCornhill,” entitled “The Manner of claiming the Gamon of Bacon &c. by\r\nTho^{s}. Shakeshaft, and Anne his wife” which it thus represents:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The last taking of the Oath at Dunmow,~ FOR THE GAMMON\r\nOF BACON.]\r\n\r\nFORM OF THE OATH.\r\n\r\n    You shall swear by Custom of Confession,\r\n    If ever you made nuptial trangression:\r\n    Be you either married man or wife,\r\n    By household brawles or contentious strife,\r\n    Or otherwise in bed, or at boord,\r\n    Offend each other in deed, or word;\r\n    Or since the parish _Clerk_ said _Amen_,\r\n    You wish’t yourselves unmarried agen:\r\n    Or in a twelve moneths time and a day\r\n    Repented not in thought any way:\r\n    But continued true and just in desire\r\n    As when you joyned hands in the holy quire\r\n    If to these conditions without all feare,\r\n    Of your own accord you will freely sweare,\r\n    A whole _Gammon of Bacon_ you shall receive,\r\n    And bear it henceforth with love and good leave.\r\n    For this is our _Custome_ at _Dunmow_ well known,\r\n    Though the pleasure be ours, the _Bacon’s_ your own.\r\n\r\nOn the taking of this oath, which is cited by an old county\r\nhistorian,[212] and somewhat varies from the verses beneath the\r\nbefore-mentioned prints, the swearers were entitled to the flitch, or\r\ngammon.\r\n\r\nThe “Gentleman’s Magazine,” of 1751, mentions that on this day “John\r\nShakeshanks, woolcomber, and Anne his wife, of the parish of\r\nWeathersfield, in Essex, appeared at the customary court at\r\nDunmow-parva, and claim’d the bacon according to the custom of that\r\nmanor.” This is all the notice of the last claim in that miscellany, but\r\nthe old “London Magazine,” of the same year, adds, that “the bacon was\r\ndelivered to them with the usual formalities.” It is remarkable that in\r\nboth these magazines the parties are named “Shakeshanks.” On reference\r\nto the court-roll, the real name appears to be Shakeshaft.\r\n\r\nOgborne’s print affirms that this custom was instituted in or about the\r\nyear 1111, by Robert, son of Richard Fitz Gilbert, Earl of Clare: but as\r\nregards the date, which is in the time of Henry I., the statement is\r\ninaccurate; for if it originated with Robert Fitzwalter, as hereafter\r\nrelated, he did not live till the time of “King Henry, son of King\r\nJohn,” who commenced his reign in 1199, and was Henry III.\r\n\r\nConcerning the ceremony, the print goes on to describe, that after\r\ndelivering the bacon, “the happy pair are taken upon men’s shoulders, in\r\na chair kept for that purpose, and carried round the scite of the\r\npriory, from the church to the house, with drums, minstrells, and other\r\nmusick playing, and the gammon of bacon borne on a high pole before\r\nthem, attended by the steward, gentlemen, and officers of the manor,\r\nwith the several inferior tenants, carrying wands, &c., and a jury of\r\nbachelors and maidens (being six of each sex) walking two and two, with\r\na great multitude of other people, young and old, from all the\r\nneighbouring towns and villages thereabouts, and several more that came\r\nfrom very great distances (to the amount of many thousands in the\r\nwhole), with shouts and acclamations, following.”[213]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chair in which the successful candidates for “the bacon” were\r\nseated, after obtaining the honourable testimony of their connubial\r\nhappiness, is made of oak, and though large, seems hardly big enough for\r\nany pair, but such as had given proofs of their mutual good-nature and\r\naffection. It is still preserved in Dunmow Church, and makes part of the\r\n_admiranda_ of that place. It is undoubtedly of great antiquity,\r\nprobably the official chair of the prior, or that of the lord of the\r\nmanor, in which he held the usual courts, and received the suit and\r\nservice of his tenants. There is an engraving of the chair in the\r\n“Antiquarian Repertory,” from whence this notice of it is extracted: it\r\nin no way differs from the chief chairs of ancient halls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf “the bacon,” it is stated, on Ogborne’s print, that “before the\r\ndissolution of monasteries, it does not appear, by searching the most\r\nancient records, to have been demanded above three times, and, including\r\nthis (demand of Shakeshaft’s) just as often since.” These demands are\r\nparticularized by Dugdale, from a manuscript in the College of\r\nArms,[214] to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n“Robt. Fitzwalter, living long beloved of king Henry, son of king John,\r\nas also of all the realme, betook himself in his latter dayes to prayer\r\nand deeds of charity, gave great and bountifull alms to the poor, kept\r\ngreat hospitality, and re-edified the decayed prison (priory) of Dunmow,\r\nwhich one Juga (Baynard), a most devout and religious woman, being in\r\nher kinde his ancestor, had builded; in which prison (priory) arose a\r\ncustome, begun and instituted, eyther by him, or some other of his\r\nsuccessours, which is verified by a common proverb or saying, viz.--That\r\nhe which repents him not of his marriage, either sleeping or waking, in\r\na year and a day, may lawfully go to Dunmow and fetch a gammon of bacon.\r\nIt is most assured that such a custome there was, and that this bacon\r\nwas delivered with such solemnity and triumphs as they of the priory and\r\nthe townsmen could make. I have enquired of the manner of it, and can\r\nlearne no more but that it continued untill the dissolution of that\r\nhouse, as also the abbies. And that the party or pilgrim for bacon was\r\nto take his oath before prior and convent, and the whole town, humbly\r\n_kneeling in the church-yard upon two hard pointed stones_, which\r\nstones, some say, are there yet to be seen in the prior’s church-yard;\r\nhis oath was ministered with such long process, and such solemne singing\r\nover him, that doubtless must make his pilgrimage (as I may term it)\r\npainfull: after, he was taken up upon men’s shoulders, and carried,\r\nfirst about the priory church-yard, and after, through the town with all\r\nthe fryers and brethren, and all the town’s-folke, young and old,\r\nfollowing him with shouts and acclamations, with his bacon borne before\r\nhim, and in such manner (as I have heard) was sent home with his bacon;\r\nof which I find that some had a gammon, and others a flecke, or a\r\nflitch; for proof whereof I have, from the records of the house, found\r\nthe names of three several persons that at several times had it.”\r\n\r\nAnno 23. Henry VI. 1445, one Richard Wright of Badbury, near the city of\r\nNorwich in the county of Norfolk, labourer (Plebeius) came to Dunmow and\r\nrequired the bacon, to wit, on the 27th of April, in the 23d year of the\r\nreign of King Henry VI. and according to the form of the charter was\r\nsworn before John Cannon, prior of the place and the convent, and very\r\nmany other neighbours, and there was delivered to him, the said Richard\r\na side or flitch of bacon.\r\n\r\nAnno 7 Edw. IV. 1467, one Stephen Samuel of Ayston-Parva, in the county\r\nof Essex, husbandman, on the day of the Blessed Virgin in Lent (25th\r\nMarch) in the 7th year of king Edward IV. came to the priory of Dunmow,\r\nand required a gammon of bacon; and he was sworn before Roger Bulcott,\r\nthen prior of the place and the convent, and also before a multitude of\r\nother neighbours, and there was delivered to him a gammon of bacon.\r\n\r\nAnno 2 Hen. VIII. 1510, Thomas le Fuller of Cogshall, in the county of\r\nEssex, came to the priory of Dunmow, and on the 8th day of September,\r\nbeing Sunday, in the 2d year of king Henry VIII. according to the form\r\nof the charter, was sworn before John Tils, then Prior of the house and\r\nthe convent, and also before a multitude of neighbours, and there was\r\ndelivered to him, the said Thomas, a gammon of bacon.\r\n\r\n“Hereby it appeareth,” Dugdale says, “that it was according to a\r\ncharter, or donation, given by some conceited benefactor to the house;\r\nand it is not to be doubted, but that at such a time, the bordering\r\ntowns and villages resorted, and were partakers of their pastimes, and\r\nlaughed to scorne the poore man’s pains[215].”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter from F.

According to Sir William Jones, “the Hindu Asbrono\r\nmer Varaha lived when the solstices were in the first degrees of Cancer\r\nand Capricorn.” It is now above 2000 years since the solstices thus\r\ncoincided, and, at present, the sign Cancer begins near the two stars\r\nwhich form the upper foot in the constellation Gemini, and terminates\r\nabout the fourth degree within the eastern boundary of the constellation\r\nCancer. In the Zodiac of Dendera this sign is represented by a\r\n_scarabæus_ or beetle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fruits._\r\n\r\nTo the eye and palate of the imagination, this month and the next are\r\nricher than those which follow them; for now you can “_have_ your fruit\r\nand _eat_ it too;” which you cannot do then. In short, now the fruit\r\nblossoms are all gone, and the fruit is so fully _set_ that nothing can\r\nhurt it; and what is better still, it is not yet stealable, either by\r\nboys, birds, or bees; so that you are as sure of it as one can be of any\r\nthing, the enjoyment of which is not actually past. Enjoy it now, then,\r\nwhile you may; in order that, when in the autumn it _disappears_, on the\r\neve of the very day you had destined for the gathering of it (as every\r\nbody’s fruit does), _you_ alone may feel that you can afford to lose it.\r\nEvery heir who is worthy to enjoy the estate that is left to him in\r\nreversion, _does_ enjoy it whether it ever comes to him or not.\r\n\r\nOn looking more closely at the Fruit, we shall find that the\r\nStrawberries, which lately (like bold and beautiful children) held out\r\ntheir blossoms into the open sunshine, that all the world might see\r\nthem, now, that their fruit is about to reach maturity, hide it\r\ncarefully beneath their low-lying leaves, as conscious virgins do their\r\nmaturing beauties;--that the Gooseberries and Currants have attained\r\ntheir full growth, and the latter are turning ripe;--that the Wall-fruit\r\nis just getting large enough to be seen among the leaves without looking\r\nfor;--that the Cherries are peeping out in white or “cherry-cheeked”\r\nclusters all along their straight branches;--and that the other\r\nstandards, the Apples, Pears, and Plums, are more or less forward,\r\naccording to their kinds.[217]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·49.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LONGEST DAY.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    Cradled in glory’s ether-space,\r\n      By Venus nursed till morn,--\r\n    The light unrolls thy golden life\r\n      And thou art sweetly born.\r\n\r\n    O lovely Day of bloom and shine,\r\n      Of heat, and air, and strain!\r\n    Millions rejoice and millions die\r\n      Within thy halcyon reign.\r\n\r\n    Hopes, fears, and doubts, the passions move;\r\n      ’Twas yesterday the same:--\r\n    To-morrow! thou wilt join the dead,\r\n      And only live by name--\r\n\r\n    Jupiter guides thee through the skies\r\n      To Hope’s eternal shore:\r\n    The sun departs--Thou, Longest Day--\r\n      Thou wilt be seen no more!\r\n\r\n    Methuselah of England’s year!\r\n      Thou Parr of Time--Farewell!\r\n    St. Thomas, shortest of thy race,\r\n      Shall ring thine annual knell.\r\n\r\n  J.

If its\r\nagreeable writer, and his good-natured readers, can excuse the omission,\r\nthe birds and the editor will be equally obliged.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REARING AND TREATMENT OF YOUNG BIRDS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    Now, thro’ the furrows where the skylarks build,\r\n    Or by the hedge-rows green, the fowler strays,\r\n    Seeking the infant bird.\r\n\r\nSir,--As the time has arrived for taking the young from the feathered\r\ntribe, it may not be amiss to say a few words by way of advice to the\r\nuninitiated, concerning the rearing, and training of these amusing\r\ncreatures, who repay our cares with their rich melody.\r\n\r\nWe may now get Chaffinches, Goldfinches, Linnets, Larks, &c. in the\r\nstreets, or at the different shops at a very small expense, either\r\nsingly, or by the nest, according to their ages, but I should recommend\r\nall who wish to purchase young birds to go to a regular dealer, who sell\r\nthem quite as cheap, and warrant them cocks. Buy them when they begin to\r\nfeed themselves--or, if younger, when you have them home, put them in a\r\ncage, rather roomy:--then for Linnets, Goldfinches, or Chaffinches, mix\r\nrape-seed, bruised, and bread, steeped in boiling water--with which,\r\nwhen cooled, you may feed them, putting it into their mouths from the\r\nend of a stick, about every two hours; water they will not require, the\r\nfood being sufficiently moist for them. When you find them peck at the\r\nstick, and take their food eagerly from it, which they will do at about\r\na fortnight old, place some food about the cage with clean dry gravel,\r\nscattering among it some dry seed bruised; they will pick it up, and so\r\nbe weaned off the moist food, which is no longer proper for them--also\r\nplace water in the pot. This, as regards their feeding, is all you have\r\nto do, while they remain healthy--if sick, you must treat them according\r\nto the nature of their complaint. I think their sickness at this early\r\nstage of their existence is either caused by cold, or by the oily nature\r\nof their food, it being too strong for their stomachs; to remedy this,\r\nmix a little of the fine gravel with it, this will help their digestion.\r\nSometimes the seed will scour them, in that case, boiled milk, or rust\r\nof iron put into their water is a remedy. So much as concerns the\r\nhard-billed tribe.\r\n\r\nIf your fancy runs on soft-billed birds, such as the skylark, woodlark,\r\nnightingale, or robin, you must feed them with egg, and bread moistened\r\nwith water; or beef, raw or cooked; changing it as they grow and begin\r\nto feed themselves, to dry egg chopped small, and crumbled bread;\r\nthrowing in with it German paste, until you find them contented with the\r\nlatter. All these birds will live healthy, and sing stout, on this food,\r\nexcept the nightingale; he _must_ have beef and egg. The remedy for\r\nsickness and scouring is as before; if the paste binds them, give them\r\nraw beef, or chopped fig; the latter is good for all birds, keeping them\r\nin beautiful feather, and cool in body. When a month old, cage them off\r\nin their proper cages.\r\n\r\nGive your captives good food, and clear water; keep their dwellings free\r\nfrom vermin, which you may always do by having a spare cage to turn\r\nthem into once a week, while you search the other, and destroy the\r\ndevouring race of red lice that breed in their crevices and corners.\r\n\r\nSquirt a mouthful of water over your birds now and then, it will do them\r\ngood; this will much assist them in their moulting, and make them throw\r\ntheir feathers faster, particularly larks, nightingales, and robins. The\r\nlatter may have their water-pans to fix inside the cage, so that they\r\ncan dabble in them, when they like; this will save the trouble of taking\r\nthem out to clean their feet. Larks _must_ be taken out once a week, or\r\ntheir claws will become clogged with dirt, and rot off. The cleaning\r\ntheir feet is but very little trouble; dip them in warm water, and rub\r\nthe dirt gently off with your thumb and finger. As these innocent\r\ncreatures delight you with the beauty of their feathers, and sweetness\r\nof their song, too much cannot be done for their comfort.\r\n\r\nHoping this little dissertation (if I may so call it) will be useful,\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  S.R.J.\r\n\r\nI conclude with the following\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\n_On hearing a Thrush singing in the rain._\r\n\r\n    How sweet the song of the awakened thrush--\r\n    Mellow’d by distance, comes upon the ear,\r\n    Tho’ gather’d clouds have made the heavens drear,\r\n    And the rain hisses in the hazel bush,\r\n    Wherein he warbles with a voice as clear\r\n    As if blue skies were over, and he near\r\n    The one that lov’d him--sweet, yet sad to hear!\r\n    For it remindeth me of one I’ve heard,\r\n    Singing to other ears, herself unseen,\r\n    In her own bower, like that delightful bird,\r\n    While yet her bosom’s hopes were fresh and green,\r\n    One, whom I heard again in after years,\r\n    When sorrow smote her,--singing midst her tears.\r\n\r\n  S. R. J.\r\n\r\n  _May, 1826._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor has often wished, for the sake of feathered posterity, that\r\nhe could ensure their liberty; but he can no more do that, than persuade\r\nthose who think they have “vested rights” in the bodies of certain of\r\nthe airy race, to open their cages and “set the prisoners free.” It is\r\nin his power, however, to assist a little in ameliorating their\r\ncondition, by urging re-perusal and strict attention to the preceding\r\nletter. He is himself particularly struck with the direction, “_squirt_\r\na _mouthful_ of water over your birds now and then--it will do them\r\n_good_.” He ventures with becoming diffidence to suggest, whether to\r\n_syringe_ a _little_ may not be as beneficial as to “_squirt_ a\r\n_mouthful_.” This is the only exception he dares to hint, and it is to\r\nbe marked as a qualified one, and, under a sense of inexperience, made\r\n“at a hazard.” But he agrees that “a _nightingale_,”--a _caged_\r\nnightingale, alas!--“_must_ have beef and egg;” and “that larks _must_\r\nbe taken out once a week”; and--he may be wrong--if they fly away, so\r\nmuch the better. He is strongly of opinion that birds are like\r\nhimself--they cannot “bear confinement,” and be happy.\r\n\r\n  [217] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 22.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1826. GENERAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nParliament having existed to its utmost legal duration, the electors\r\nexercised, or withheld the exercise of their franchise, according to\r\ntheir individual wishes or hopes, desires or fears, intelligence or\r\nignorance; or as feelings of independence directed, or influence over\r\nweakness misdirected. Contests were as numerous and fierce as usual;\r\nand, as might have been expected, in some places, the numerical state of\r\nthe poll-books intimated more of intellectual enlargement than the final\r\nresults. No new arguments or means were resorted to. The following\r\nparagraph is only inserted as an instance, that to buy as cheap, and\r\nsell as dear as possible, as a principle of trade, was not thoroughly\r\nlost sight of by dealers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Price of Provisions during Elections._\r\n\r\nDuring the election at Sudbury, four cabbages sold for 10_l._, and a\r\nplate of gooseberries fetched 25_l._; the sellers, where these articles\r\nwere so dear, being voters. At Great Marlow, on the contrary, things\r\nwere cheap, and an elector during the election bought a sow and nine\r\nyoung pigs for a penny.[218]\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION FOR GARRETT.\r\n\r\nThe “County History” says, that the Hamlet of _Garrett_ is in the road\r\nfrom _Wandsworth_ to _Tooting_. About two centuries ago it appears to\r\nhave been a single house called the _Garvett_. In it was the\r\nmansion-house of the Brodrick family, pulled down about fifty years ago;\r\nthe ground is let to a market gardener; part of the garden wall remains.\r\nGarrett now contains about fifty houses, amongst which are some\r\nconsiderable manufactures. This used to be for many years the scene of a\r\n_mock election_, and much indecency on the meeting of every new\r\nparliament, when several characters in low life appeared as candidates,\r\nbeing furnished with fine clothes and gay equipages by the publicans,\r\nwho made a good harvest. The last of these, known by the name of Sir\r\nHarry Dimsdale, was a deformed dwarf, little better than an idiot, who\r\nused to cry muffins in the streets about St. Ann’s, Soho, and died about\r\n1809. It has been dropped at the two last general elections; but the\r\nmemory of it will be preserved by Foote’s diverting farce of “The Mayor\r\nof Garrett.”--There are three prints displaying the proceedings on\r\noccasion of this election.[219]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the preceding statement, which is almost in the words of Lysons,\r\nGarrett has been increased, and may be said, in 1826, to contain double\r\nthe number of houses. Lysons and Bray call it a “hamlet;” and this\r\ndenomination, if taken to mean “a small village,” is applicable to this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFor particulars concerning the “Mock Election,” with a view to insertion\r\nin the _Every Day-Book_, Garrett itself has been visited, and persons\r\nseen there, and in the neighbourhood, who took part in the proceedings,\r\nand well remember them. Their statements of this public burlesque will\r\nbe laid before the reader presently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary, it may be remarked that in the election for Garrett,\r\nthere was a whimsical assumption of office, and an arbitrary creation of\r\nofficers and characters unknown in the elections of other boroughs. In\r\nparticular, there was a “Master of the Horse.” The person so dignified\r\nat its latter elections was pointed out as the oldest individual in\r\nWandsworth, who had figured in the “solemn mockery,” and as, therefore,\r\nmost likely to furnish information, from “reminiscences” of his “ancient\r\ndignity.” He was described as “Old Jack Jones the sawyer;” and it was\r\nadded, “You’ll find him by the water side; turn down by the church; he\r\nis lame and walks with a crutch; any body’ll tell you of him; he lives\r\nin a cottage by the bridge; if you don’t find him at home, he is most\r\nlikely at the Plume of Feathers, or just in the neighbourhood; you’ll be\r\nsure to know him if you meet him--he is a thorough oddity, and can tell\r\nall about the Garrett Election.” The “Plume” was resorted to, and “old\r\nJack Jones” obligingly sought by Mr. Attree the landlord, who for that\r\npurpose peregrinated the town; and the “Master of the Horse” made his\r\nentry into the parlour with as much alacrity as his wooden assistants\r\nhelped him to. It was “the accustomed place,” wherein he had told his\r\nstory “many a time and oft;” and having heard, “up town” that there was\r\n“somebody quite curious about the Garrett Election,” he was dragging his\r\n“slow length along,” when “mine host of the _Feathers_” met him on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nJohn Jones may be described as “one of the _has_ beens.” In his day he\r\nwas tall of stature, stout of body, and had done as much work as any man\r\nof his time--when he was at it. But, then, he had overstrained himself,\r\nand for some years past had not been able to do a stroke of work; and he\r\nhad seen a deal of “ran-dan,” and a racketty life had racketted his\r\nframe, and\r\n\r\n    -------------------------“Time\r\n    Had written strange defeatures on his brow.”\r\n\r\nAfter the first civilities, and after he had deposited his crutch and\r\nstick by the side of a chair, and himself in an adjoining one, and after\r\nthe glowing pleasure from seeing a fresh face had subsided, and been\r\nreplaced by a sense of the importance which attaches to the possession\r\nof something coveted by another, he talked of the “famous doings,” and\r\n“such sights as never were seen before, nor never would be seen again;”\r\nand he dimmed the hope of particular information, by “quips, and quirks,\r\nand wanton wiles;” and practised the “art of ingeniously tormenting,” by\r\ndeclarations of unbounded knowledge, and that “he _could_ a tale\r\nunfold,” but would not; because, as he said, “why should I make other\r\npeople as wise as I am?” Yet there was a string which “discoursed most\r\nexcellent music”--it was of himself and of the fame of his exploits. His\r\n“companions in arms” had been summoned to their last abiding-place, and,\r\nalas,\r\n\r\n    “They left him alone in his glory!”\r\n\r\nJohn Jones’s topic was not a dry one, nor was John Jones dry, but in\r\nthe commencement he had “preferred a little porter to any thing else in\r\nthe world,” except, and afterwards accepted, “a drop of something by\r\nitself;” and, by degrees, he became communicative of all he could\r\nrecollect. In the course of the present article his information will be\r\nembodied, with other memoranda, towards a history of the elections of\r\nthe “borough of Garrett.”\r\n\r\nHad an artist been present at the conversation, he might have caught the\r\nfeatures of the “Ex-master of the Horse,” when they were heightened by\r\nhis subject to a humorous expression. He was by no means unwilling to\r\n“have his head taken off;” but he deemed the “execution” an affair of so\r\nmuch importance as to solemnize his features from their wonted hilarity\r\nwhile speaking, to the funereal appearance which the writer has\r\ndepicted, and the engraver perpetuated, in the following\r\nrepresentation:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~John Jones, of Wandsworth,~\r\n\r\nMASTER OF THE HORSE AT THE LAST ELECTIONS FOR GARRETT.]\r\n\r\nAs a memorial of a remarkable living character, this portrait may be\r\nacceptable; he is the only person alive at Wandsworth, of any\r\ndistinction in the popular elections of its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account respecting Garrett is in “A Morning’s\r\nWalk to Kew”--\r\n\r\n_By Sir Richard Phillips._\r\n\r\nWandsworth having been the once-famed scene of those humorous popular\r\nelections of a mayor, or member for GARRAT; and the subject serving to\r\nillustrate the manners of the times, and abounding in original features\r\nof character, I collected among some of its elder inhabitants a variety\r\nof amusing facts and documents, relative to the eccentric candidates and\r\ntheir elections.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Wandsworth, a road extends nearly two miles to the village\r\nof Lower Tooting, and nearly midway are a few houses, or hamlet, by the\r\nside of a small common, called _Garrat_, from which the road itself is\r\ncalled _Garrat Lane_. Various encroachments on this common led to an\r\nassociation of the neighbours about three-score years since, when they\r\nchose a president, or _mayor_, to protect their rights; and the time of\r\ntheir first election being the period of a new parliament, it was agreed\r\nthat the mayor should be re-chosen after every general election. Some\r\nfacetious members of the club gave, in a few years, local notoriety to\r\nthis election; and, when party spirit ran high in the days of _Wilkes\r\nand Liberty_, it was easy to create an appetite for a burlesque election\r\namong the lower orders of the Metropolis. The publicans at Wandsworth,\r\nTooting, Battersea, Clapham, and Vauxhall, made a purse to give it\r\ncharacter; and Mr. Foote rendered its interest universal, by calling one\r\nof his inimitable farces, “_the Mayor of Garrat_.” I have indeed been\r\ntold, that Foote, Garrick, and Wilkes, wrote some of the candidates’\r\naddresses, for the purpose of instructing the people in the corruptions\r\nwhich attend elections to the legislature, and of producing those\r\nreforms by means of ridicule and shame, which are vainly expected from\r\nsolemn appeals of argument and patriotism.\r\n\r\nNot being able to find the members for Garrat in Beatson’s Political\r\nIndex, or in any of the Court Calendars, I am obliged to depend on\r\ntradition for information in regard to the early history of this famous\r\nborough. The first mayor of whom I could hear was called Sir John\r\nHarper. He filled the seat during two parliaments, and was, it appears,\r\na man of wit, for, on a dead cat being thrown at him on the hustings,\r\nand a bystander exclaiming that it stunk worse than a fox, Sir John\r\nvociferated, “that’s no wonder, for you see it’s a _poll_-cat.” This\r\nnoted baronet was, in the metropolis, a retailer of brick-dust; and,\r\nhis Garrat honours being supposed to be a means of improving his trade\r\nand the condition of his ass, many characters in similar occupations\r\nwere led to aspire to the same distinctions.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Sir Jeffery Dunstan, who was returned for three\r\nparliaments, and was the most popular candidate that ever appeared on\r\nthe Garrat hustings. His occupation was that of buying OLD WIGS, once an\r\narticle of trade like that in old clothes, but become obsolete since the\r\nfull-bottomed and full-dressed wigs of both sexes went out of fashion.\r\nSir Jeffery usually carried his wig-bag over his shoulder, and, to avoid\r\nthe charge of vagrancy, vociferated, as he passed along the street, “old\r\nwigs;” but, having a person like Esop, and a countenance and manner\r\nmarked by irresistible humour, he never appeared without a train of\r\nboys, and curious persons, whom he entertained by his sallies of wit,\r\nshrewd sayings, and smart repartees; and from whom, without begging, he\r\ncollected sufficient to maintain his dignity of mayor and knight. He was\r\nno respecter of persons, and was so severe in his jokes on the\r\ncorruptions and compromises of power, that this street-jester, was\r\nprosecuted for using what were then called seditious expressions; and,\r\nas a caricature on the times, which ought never to be forgotten, he was\r\nin 1793 tried, convicted, and imprisoned! In consequence of this affair,\r\nand some charges of dishonesty, he lost his popularity, and, at the\r\ngeneral election for 1796, was ousted by Sir Harry Dimsdale,\r\nmuffin-seller, a man as much deformed as himself. Sir Jeffery could not\r\nlong survive his fall; but, in death as in life, he proved a satire on\r\nthe vices of the proud, for in 1797 he died, like Alexander the Great,\r\nand many other heroes renowned in the historic page--of suffocation from\r\nexcessive drinking!\r\n\r\nSir Harry Dimsdale dying also before the next general election, and no\r\ncandidate starting of sufficient originality of character, and, what was\r\nstill more fatal, the victuallers having failed to raise a PUBLIC PURSE,\r\nwhich was as stimulating a bait to the _independent_ candidates for\r\nGarrat, as it is to the _independent_ candidates for a certain assembly;\r\nthe borough of Garrat has since remained vacant, and the populace have\r\nbeen without a _professed_ political buffoon.\r\n\r\nNone but those who have seen a London mob on any great holiday can form\r\na just idea of these elections. On several occasions, a hundred thousand\r\npersons, half of them in carts, in hackney-coaches, and on horse and\r\nass-back, covered the various roads from London, and choked up all the\r\napproaches to the place of election. At the two last elections, I was\r\ntold, that the road within a mile of Wandsworth was so blocked up by\r\nvehicles, that none could move backward or forward during many hours;\r\nand that the candidates, dressed like chimney-sweepers on May-day, or in\r\nthe mock fashion of the period, were brought to the hustings in the\r\ncarriages of peers, drawn by six horses, the owners themselves\r\ncondescending to become their drivers[220]!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore relating certain amusing facts which have never before appeared\r\nin print, or giving further particulars respecting Sir Jeffery Dunstan\r\nand Sir Henry Dimsdale, it seems fitting to add from the “Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine” of 1781, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Wednesday June 25, the septennial mock election for Garrat was held\r\nthis day; and upwards of 50,000 people were, on that ludicrous occasion,\r\nassembled at Wandsworth.”\r\n\r\nIn the same volume there is an article which, as it is the only other\r\nnotice in that useful miscellany concerning this celebrated usage, and\r\nas there is not any notice of it in other magazines of the time, is here\r\nannexed.\r\n\r\n  _July, 25._\r\n\r\nMr. URBAN.--The learned antiquary finds a pleasure in tracing the origin\r\nof ancient customs, even when time has so altered them as totally to\r\nobliterate their use. It may therefore not be unpleasing to the\r\ngenerality of your readers, while it is yet recent in memory, to record\r\nin your Magazine the laudable motive that gave rise to the farcical\r\ncustom of electing a Mayor of Garrat, which is now become truly\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nI have been told, that about thirty years ago, several persons who lived\r\nnear that part of Wandsworth which adjoins to Garrat Lane, had formed a\r\nkind of club, not merely to eat and drink, but to concert measures for\r\nremoving the encroachments made on that part of the common, and to\r\nprevent any others being made for the future. As the members were most\r\nof them persons in low circumstances, they agreed at every meeting to\r\ncontribute some small matter, in order to make up a purse for the\r\ndefence of their collective rights. When a sufficient sum of money was\r\nsubscribed, they applied to a very worthy attorney in that\r\nneighbourhood, who brought an action against the encroachers in the name\r\nof the president (or, as they called him, the MAYOR) of the club. They\r\ngained their suit with costs; the encroachments were destroyed; and ever\r\nafter, the president, who lived many years, was called “The Mayor of\r\nGarrat.”\r\n\r\nThis event happening at the time of a general election, the ceremony\r\nupon every new parliament, of choosing _outdoor_ members for the borough\r\nof Garrat, has been constantly kept up, and is still continued, to the\r\ngreat emolument of all the publicans at Wandsworth, who annually\r\nsubscribe to all incidental expenses attending this mock election.\r\n\r\n  M. G.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late eminent antiquary, Dr. Ducarel, made inquiries respecting this\r\ncustom of the late Mr. W. Massey of Wandsworth, who answered them in the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n  _Wandsworth, June 25, 1754._\r\n\r\nDR. DUCAREL.--I promised to give you an account of the mock election for\r\nGarrat, a district within the compass of the parish of Wandsworth. I\r\nhave been informed, that about 60 or 70 years ago, some watermen,\r\nbelonging to this town, went to the Leather Bottle, a public house at\r\nGarrat, to spend a merry day, which, being the time of a general\r\nelection for members of Parliament, in the midst of their frolick they\r\ntook it into their heads to chuse one of their company a representative\r\nfor that place; and, having gone through the usual ceremonies of an\r\nelection, as well as the occasion would permit, he was declared duly\r\nelected. Whether the whimsical custom of swearing the electors upon a\r\nbrick-bat, ‘quod rem cum aliqua muliere, intra limites istius pagi,\r\nhabuissent,’ was then first established, or that it was a waggish\r\nafter-thought, I cannot determine, but it has been regarded as the due\r\nqualification of the electors for many elections last past.\r\n\r\nThis local usage, from that small beginning, has had a gradual\r\nincrease; for no great account was made of it, that I can remember or\r\nhear of, before the two elections preceding this last, which has been\r\nperformed with uncommon pomp and magnificence, in the plebeian mode of\r\npageantry. And, as it has been taken notice of in our public newspapers,\r\nit may probably have a run, through those channels, to many parts of the\r\nkingdom, and, in time, become the inquiry of the curious, _when_ and\r\n_why_ such a mock usage was commenced.\r\n\r\nI have herewith sent you copies of some of the hand-bills of the\r\ncandidates, that were printed and plentifully dispersed (in imitation of\r\nthe _grand monde_) before the election came on, by which you may judge\r\nof the humour in which the other parts of it were conducted. Their\r\npseudo-titles, as you will observe, are Lord Twankum, Squire\r\nBlow-me-down, and Squire Gubbins. Lord Twankum’s right name is John\r\nGardiner, and is grave-digger to this parish; Blow-me-down is ----\r\nWillis, a waterman; and Squire Gubbins, whose name is ---- Simmonds,\r\nkeeps a publichouse, the sign of the Gubbins’ Head, in Blackman-street,\r\nSouthwark.\r\n\r\nSome time hence, perhaps, also it may be a matter of inquiry what is\r\nmeant by the Gubbins’ Head. This Simmonds formerly lived at Wandsworth,\r\nand went from hence to keep a public-house in Blackman-street; he being\r\na droll companion in what is called low-life, several of his old\r\nacquaintance of this town used to call at his house, when they were in\r\nLondon, to drink a pot or two; and, as he generally had some cold\r\nprovisions (which by a cant name he usually called “his gubbins”), he\r\nmade them welcome to such as he had, from whence he obtained that name;\r\nand putting up a man’s head for the sign, it was called the “Gubbins’\r\nHead.” A hundred years hence, perhaps, if some knowledge of the occasion\r\nof the name of this sign should not be preserved in writing, our future\r\nantiquaries might puzzle themselves to find out the meaning of it. I\r\nmake no question, but that we have many elaborate dissertations upon\r\nantique subjects, whose originals, being obscure or whimsy, like this,\r\nwere never truly discovered. This leads me to the commendation of the\r\nutility of your design in recording singular accidents and odd usages,\r\nthe causes and origin of which might otherwise be lost in a long tract\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Garrett Election_, 1826.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the desire of certain admirers of certain popular customs\r\nto get up another burlesque election for Garrett; the last was thirty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of a Notice, now executing (June 23, 1826) at a\r\nsign-painters, on a board ten feet high, for the purpose of being\r\npublicly exhibited. It need scarcely be observed that the commencing\r\nword of this very singular composition, which ought to be _Oyez_, is\r\nimproperly spelt and divided, and “yes” is unaccountably placed between\r\n_three_ inverted commas; the transcript is verbatim, and is arranged in\r\nthis column as the original is on the signboard.\r\n\r\n  _O ‘‘‘Yes’’’_\r\n  NOTICE\r\n  _That on_ THURSDAY\r\n  6th _July_, 1826\r\n  _In conformity of_\r\n  THE HIGH\r\n  _AUTHORITIES_,\r\n  _Of the UNITED_\r\n  KINGDOM\r\n  _will assemble_\r\n  THROUGHOUT\r\n  ~the~ EMPIRE\r\n  _and particularly_\r\n  _at the_ ~Hustings~ _at_\r\n  GARRAT,\r\n  _to whit, conformable_\r\n  _to the Custom_\r\n  _Of_ OUR ANCIENT\r\n  LIBERTY.\r\n  SIR JOHN\r\n  PAUL PRY,\r\n  _now offers himself_\r\n  _to a Generous_\r\n  PUBLIC\r\n  GOD SAVE THE\r\n  KING\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last representative of Garrett was a “remarkable character” in the\r\nstreets of the metropolis for many years. His ordinary costume was very\r\ndifferent from the court dress he wore on the hustings, wherein he is\r\nhere represented--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Sir Jeffery Dunstan, M. P. for Garrett,~\r\n\r\nCOSMOPOLITE, AND MUFFIN-SELLER.]\r\n\r\nThe individual who figured as conspicuously as the most conspicuous,\r\nand who may be regarded as the last really _humorous_ candidate at this\r\nelection was\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Sir Jeffery Dunstan, M. P. for Garrett,~\r\n\r\nAND ITINERANT DEALER IN OLD WIGS.]\r\n\r\nThe kind of oratory and the nature of the argument employed by the\r\ncandidates in their addresses to their constituents, can scarcely be\r\nbetter exemplified than by the following\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF SIR JEFFERY DUNSTAN.\r\n\r\n_My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen_,\r\n\r\n  A landed property being the only unexceptionable qualification that\r\n  entitles me to a seat in the august parliament of Great Britain, I\r\n  presume my estate in the Isle of Mud will, in point of propriety,\r\n  secure to me your votes and interests, to represent you in the ensuing\r\n  parliament.\r\n\r\nLadies and gem’men, I propose, for the good of mankind, to anticipate a\r\nfew promises like other great men, but which I will strictly adhere to,\r\nthat is, as long as I find it’s my interest so to do.\r\n\r\nFirst, in regard to his Majesty’s want of money, I am determined to make\r\nhim easy on that point--(Lord bless him!)--by abolishing the use of it\r\nentirely, and reducing the price of gold, it being the worst canker to\r\nthe soul of man; and the only expedient I can think of to prevent\r\nbribery and corruption, an evil which all the great _big wigs_ of\r\nWestminster cannot prevent, notwithstanding all their gravity and\r\nknowledge, as the late proceedings against governor Green Peas can fully\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\nNext, as my worthy constituents may be assured, I shall use all my\r\nhonest endeavours to get a majority in the house. I shall always take\r\nthe popular side of the question; and to do all I can to oblige that\r\njewel of a man, Sugar-Plumb Billy, I shall assist him in paying off the\r\nnational debt, without wetting a sponge. My scheme for this, ladies and\r\ngem’men, is to unmarry all those who choose it, on such terms as the\r\nminister shall think fit. This being a glorious opportunity for women of\r\nspirit to exert themselves, and regain their long lost empire over their\r\nhusbands, I hope they will use all their coaxing arts to get me elected\r\nin their husband’s place; and this will greatly increase the influence\r\nof the crown, and vastly lower India bonds.\r\n\r\nAs I detest the idea of a placeman, I pledge myself not to accept of\r\nanything less than the government of Duck Island, or the bishoprick of\r\nDurham, for I am very fond of a clean shirt, and lawn sleeves, I think,\r\nlook well; besides, the _sine qua non_ is the thing I aim at, like\r\nother great men. The India Company, too, I will convey from\r\nLeadenhall-street to Westminster, and, according to my own _wig_\r\nprinciples, I will create all the directors’ and nabobs’ titles, and,\r\nbesides, show them how to get what they have been long aiming at--the\r\nway to Botany Bay. I shall likewise prove the Excise Office to be the\r\ngreatest smuggle in the nation, for they smuggled the ground from the\r\npublic on which their office stands, and for which I shall conjure up\r\nOld Gresham’s ghost, to read them a lecture upon thieving.\r\n\r\nLike the great men, I pledge my honour, life, and fortune, that I will\r\nremove all heavy taxes, and by a glorious scheme, contrived by me and my\r\nfriend Lord George Gordon, I shall, by a philosophical, aristocratical\r\nthermometer, or such-like hydraulics, discover the longitude among the\r\nJews of Duke’s Place, and the secret of Masonry.\r\n\r\nCity honours I never courted, nor would I give an _old wig_ to be drawn\r\nin idle state through Cheapside’s foggy air on a 9th of November.--No, I\r\nwould rather sit by the side of my great friend Mr. Fox, in the Duke of\r\nDevonshire’s coach, and make another coalition, or go with him to India,\r\nand be a governor’s great man; for,\r\n\r\n    Hated by fools, and fools to hate,\r\n    Was always Jeffery Dunstan’s fate.\r\n\r\nThough my Lord George has turned Jew, and wears a broom about his\r\nchin[221], I never intend to do so until his informer is dead, or the\r\ntime elapsed of his imprisonment in the county castle, when we shall\r\nboth go into Duke’s Place, and be sworn true friends; then woe be to the\r\ninforming busy bookseller of Spitalfields, who was lately turned out of\r\nthe Snogo for eating pork with the rind on. Depend upon it his windows\r\nshall chatter more Hebrew than he ever understood. All this shall be\r\ndone by me, in spite of him. Yes, by me, your humble servant,\r\n\r\n  SIR JEFFERY DUNSTAN, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nExparte DIMSDALE, Bart.\r\n\r\n“_Two single Gentlemen roll’d into one._”\r\n\r\nTAKE NOTICE.\r\n\r\n~Whereas~, on or upon the last page but one of the last sheet, that is\r\nto say, columns 829 and 830 of the _Every-Day Book_, there are _two_\r\nwhole length portraits, each whereof is subscribed, or inscribed\r\nbeneath, with _one_ name.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS each, and both, is and are, thereby, that is to say, by the\r\nsaid _one_ name, called, or purported to be called, “Sir _Jeffery\r\nDunstan_, M.P. for Garrett, &c.”\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS the said two engravings are portraits of two several,\r\nseparate, and distinct individuals.\r\n\r\nAND WHEREAS it is hereby declared to be true and certain, and not to be\r\ngainsayed or denied, that _two_ neither are, nor is, nor can be, one.\r\n\r\n~Therefore~, ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN are hereby intended, and required\r\nto be instructed, and informed thereof.\r\n\r\nAND FURTHER, that the first, or top, or uppermost portrait, although\r\nsubscribed “Sir Jeffery Dunstan, &c.” is to be seen, taken, and\r\nreceived, as and for the true and faithful likeness of sir _Harry\r\nDimsdale_, Bart.

The hope has been realized to a certain extent, and there will now\r\nbe placed before the reader the communications of correspondents, and\r\nwhatever has been obtained from personal intercourse with those who\r\nremember the old elections for Garrett.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo mention the earliest within remembrance, it is proper to say that\r\nthis public burlesque was conducted in 1777 with great spirit; sir John\r\nHarper was then elected, and a man in armour rode in that procession.\r\nThe name of this champion was “Jem Anderson,” a breeches-maker of\r\nWandsworth, and a wonderful humorist.\r\n\r\nAt sir John Harper’s election, on the 25th of June, 1781, he had six\r\nrivals to contend with. A printed bill now before the editor, sets forth\r\ntheir titles and qualifications in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n“THE GARRATT ELECTION.\r\n\r\n  “_The Possessions and Characters of the Seven Candidates that put up\r\n  for that Great and Important Office, called_\r\n\r\n  THE MAYOR OF GARRETT.\r\n\r\n  “Sir Jeffery Dunstan, sir William Blase, sir Christopher Dashwood, sir\r\n  John Harper, sir William Swallowtail, sir John Gnawpost, and sir\r\n  Thomas _Nameless_.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday, the 25th instant, being the day appointed for the Garrat\r\nelection, the candidates proceeded from different parts of London to\r\nGarrat-green, Wandsworth.\r\n\r\n“Sir Jeffery Dunstan: he is a man of low stature, but very great in\r\ncharacter and abilities; his principal view is to serve his king and\r\ncountry, his worthy friends and himself.\r\n\r\n“The next gentleman that offered himself was sir William Blase, a man of\r\ngreat honour and reputation, and was of high rank in the army, serving\r\nhis king and country near forty years, and had the honour to be a\r\ncorporal in the city trainbands, the last rebellion.\r\n\r\n“The third, admiral Dashwood, well known in the county of Surry, to many\r\nwho has felt the weight of his hand on their shoulders, and shewing an\r\nexecution in the other.\r\n\r\n“Sir John Harper is a man of the greatest abilities and integrity, and\r\nhis estate lies wherever he goes; his wants are supplied by the oil of\r\nhis tongue, and is of the strictest honour: he made an oath against work\r\nwhen in his youth, and was never known to break it.\r\n\r\n“Sir William Swallow-tail is an eminent merchant in the county of Surry,\r\nand supplies most of the gardeners with strawberry-baskets, and others\r\nto bring their fruit to market.\r\n\r\n“Sir John Gnawpost is a man well known to the public; he carries his\r\ntraffic under his left arm, and there is not a schoolboy in London or\r\nWestminster but what has had dealings with him:--His general cry is\r\n‘twenty if you win, and five if you lose.’\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas _Nameless_,”--of reputation unmentionable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the candidates from the original printed “Hustings\r\npaper,” it is proper to state that its description of them is followed\r\nby a woodcut representing two figures--one, of sir Jeffery Dunstan, in\r\nthe costume and attitude of his portrait given at column 830, but\r\nholding a pipe in his right hand, and one of another candidate, who, for\r\nwant of a name to the figure, can scarcely be guessed at; he is in a\r\ncourt dress, with a star on the right breast of his coat, his right arm\r\ngracefully reposing in the pocket of his unmentionables, and his left\r\nhand holding a bag, which is thrown over his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nBeneath that engraving is\r\n\r\n  “The speech of sir _Jeffery Dunstan_, Bart. delivered from the\r\n  hustings.\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n“I am heartily glad to see so great a number of my friends attend so\r\nearly on the great and important business of this day. If I should be so\r\nhappy as to be the object of your choice, you may depend on it that your\r\ngreat requests shall be my sole study both asleep and awake. I am\r\ndetermined to oppose lord N(ort)h in every measure he proposes; and that\r\nmy electors shall have porter at threepence a pot; that bread shall be\r\nsold at four pence a quartern loaf, and corn be brought fairly to\r\nmarket, not stived up in granaries to be eat by rats and mice; and that\r\nneither Scotchmen or Irishmen shall have a seat in our parliament.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, as I am not an orator or personable man, be assured I am an\r\nhonest member. Having been abused in the public papers, I am resolved,\r\nif it cost me a thousand pounds, to take the free votes of the electors.\r\nIt is true, it has cost me _ten shillings_ for a coach, to raise which,\r\nI have pawned my cloathes; but that I regard not, since I am now in a\r\nsituation to serve my king, whom I wish God to bless, also his precious\r\nqueen, who, under the blessing of a king above, hath produced a progeny\r\nwhich has presaged a happy omen to this country.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I can assure you with the greatest truth, that the cloaths I\r\nhave on are all my own, for the meanness of borrowing cloaths to appear\r\nbefore you, my worthy electors, I highly detest; and bribery and other\r\nmeanness I abhor;--but if any gentleman chuse to give me any thing, I\r\nam ready to receive their favours.”\r\n\r\nThe above oration is headed by “_This is my original speech_;” below it\r\nis added as follows:--\r\n\r\n“N. B. When sir John Harper’s man arrived on the hustings with flying\r\ncolours, he began to insult sir Jeffery, who immediately made him walk\r\nsix times round the hustings, ask his honour’s pardon, drop his colours\r\nand dismount.”\r\n\r\nWith this information the bill concludes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA song printed at the time, but now so rare as not to be met with,\r\nfurther particularizes some of the candidates at this election. In the\r\nabsence of an original copy, the parol evidence of “old John Jones of\r\nWandsworth,” has been admitted as to certain verses which are here\r\nrecorded accordingly.\r\n\r\nGARRETT ELECTION SONG, 1781.\r\n\r\n_Recited by the_ “ex-master of the horse,” _at the_ “Plume of Feathers,”\r\n_Wandsworth, on the 14th of June, 1826_.\r\n\r\n    At Garratt, lackaday, what fun!\r\n    To see the sight what thousands run!\r\n    Sir William Blase, and all his crew,\r\n    Sure, it was a droll sight to view.\r\n\r\n    Sir William Blase, a snob by trade,\r\n    In Wandsworth town did there parade;\r\n    With his high cap and wooden sword\r\n    He look’d as noble as a lord!\r\n\r\n    Sir William Swallowtail came next\r\n    In basket-coach, so neatly drest;\r\n    With hand-bells playing all the way,\r\n    For Swallowtail, my boys, huzza!\r\n\r\n    Sir Christopher Dashwood so gay,\r\n    With drums and fifes did sweetly play;\r\n    He, in a boat, was drawn along,\r\n    Amongst a mighty gazing throng.\r\n\r\n    In blue and gold he grand appeared,\r\n    Behind the boat old Pluto steer’d;\r\n    The Andrew, riding by his side,\r\n    Across a horse, did nobly stride.\r\n\r\n    On sir John Harper next we gaze\r\n    All in his carriage, and six bays,\r\n    With star upon his breast, so fine,\r\n    He did each candidate outshine.\r\n\r\n    And when he on the hustings came\r\n    He bow’d to all in gallant strain,\r\n    The speech he made was smart and cute,\r\n    And did each candidate confute.\r\n\r\n    In this procession to excel,\r\n    The droll sir William acted well;\r\n    And when they came to Garrett green,\r\n    Sure what laughing there was seen!\r\n\r\n    No Wilkes, but liberty, was there;\r\n    And every thing honest and fair,\r\n    For surely Garrett is the place,\r\n    Where pleasure is, and no disgrace!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir William Swallowtail was one William Cock, a whimsical basket-maker\r\nof Brentford, who deeming it proper to have an equipage every way\r\nsuitable to the honour he aspired to, built his own carriage, with his\r\nown hands, to his own taste. It was made of wicker, and drawn by four\r\nhigh hollow-backed horses; whereon were seated dwarfish boys,\r\nwhimsically dressed for postilions. In allusion to the American war, two\r\nfootmen rode before the carriage tarred and feathered, the coachman wore\r\na wicker hat, and sir William himself, from the seat of his vehicle,\r\nmaintained his mock dignity in grotesque array, amidst unbounded\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe song says, that sir William Swallowtail came “with hand-bells\r\nplaying all the way,” and “old John Jones,” after he “rehearsed” the\r\nsong, gave some account of the player on the hand-bells.\r\n\r\nThe hand-bell player was Thomas Cracknell, who, at that time, was a\r\npublican at Brentford, and kept the “Wilkes’s Head.” He had been a\r\ncow-boy in the service of lady Holderness; and after he took that\r\npublic-house, he so raised its custom that it was a place of the first\r\nresort in Brentford “for man and horse.” With an eye to business, as\r\nwell as a disposition to waggery, he played the hand-bells in support of\r\nsir William Swallowtail, as much for the good of the “Wilkes’s Head” as\r\nin honour of his neighbour Cock, the basket-maker, who, with his\r\nfollowers, had opened Cracknell’s house. Soon after the election he let\r\nthe “Wilkes’s Head,” and receiving a handsome sum for good-will and\r\ncoming-in, bound himself in a penalty of 20_l._ not to set up within ten\r\nmiles of the spot. In the afternoon of the day he gave up possession, he\r\nwent to his successor with the 20_l._ penalty, and informed him he had\r\ntaken another house in the neighbourhood. It was the sign of the “Aaron\r\nand Driver,” two race-horses, of as great celebrity as the most favoured\r\nof the then Garrett candidates. Cracknell afterwards became a rectifier\r\nor distiller at Brentford.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir John Harper was by trade a weaver, and qualified, by power of face\r\nand speech, and infinite humour, to sustain the burlesque character he\r\nassumed. His chief pretensions to represent Garrett were grounded on his\r\nreputation, circulated in printed hand-bills, which described him as a\r\n“rectifier of mistakes and blunders.” He made his grand entry through\r\nWandsworth, into Garrett, in a phaeton and six bays, with postilions in\r\nscarlet and silver, surrounded by thousands of supporters, huzzaing, and\r\ndeclaring him to be “able to give any man an answer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOCK ELECTION FOR GARRETT.\r\n\r\n~Sir John Harper’s Election, 1781.~]\r\n\r\n    Long as we live there’ll be no more\r\n    Such scenes as these, in days of yore,\r\n    When little folks deem’d great ones less,\r\n    And aped their manners and address;\r\n    When, further still to counterfeit,\r\n    To mountebanks they gave a seat,\r\n    By virtue of a mobbing summons,\r\n    As members of the House of Commons.\r\n    Through Garrett, then, a cavalcade,\r\n    A long procession, longer made.\r\n    For why, the way was not so wide\r\n    That horsemen, there, abreast, could ride,\r\n    As they had rode, when they came down,\r\n    In order due, to Wandsworth town;\r\n    Whence, to the Leather Bottle driven,\r\n    With shouts that rent the welkin given,\r\n    And given also, many blows\r\n    In strife, the great “Sir John” arose\r\n    On high, in high phaeton, stood,\r\n    And pledged his last, best, drop of blood,\r\n    As sure as he was “Harper,” to\r\n    Undo all things that wouldn’t do,\r\n    And vow’d he’d do, as well as undo,\r\n    He’d do--in short, he’d do--what none do:\r\n    Although his speech, precisely, is\r\n    Unknown, yet here, concisely, is\r\n    Related all, which, sought with pains,\r\n    Is found to be the last remains,\r\n    Of all, at Garrett, done and said;\r\n    And more than elsewhere can be read.\r\n\r\nThe preceding engraving is from a large drawing, by Green, of a scene at\r\nthis election in 1781, taken on the spot. Until now, this drawing has\r\nnot been submitted to the public eye.\r\n\r\nIn the above accurate representation of the spot, the sign of the\r\nLeather Bottle in Garrett-lane is conspicuous. Its site at that time was\r\ndifferent from that of the present public-house bearing that name.\r\n\r\nIt is further observable, that “Harper for ever” is inscribed on the\r\nphaeton of the mock candidate for the mock honours of the mock electors;\r\nand that the candidate himself is in the act of haranguing his worthy\r\nconstituents, some of whose whimsical dresses will give a partial idea\r\nof the whimsical appearance of the assembled multitude. Every species of\r\nextravagant habiliment seems to have been resorted to. The little\r\nhumourist in a large laced cocked hat, and his donkey in trappings, are\r\nparticularly rich, and divide the attention of the people on foot with\r\nsir John Harper himself. The vender of a printed paper, in a large wig,\r\nleers round at him in merry glee. The sweeps, elevated on their bit of\r\n“come-up,” are attracted by the popular candidate, whose voice seems\r\nrivalled by the patient animal, from whose back they are cheering their\r\nfavourite man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this election, we find the never-to-be-forgotten sir Jeffery Dunstan,\r\nwho it is not right to pass without saying something more of him than\r\nthat on this occasion he was a mere candidate, and unsuccessful. He\r\nsucceeded afterwards to the seat he sought, and will be particularly\r\nnoticed hereafter; until when, it would perhaps be more appropriate to\r\ndefer what is about to be offered respecting him; but the distinguished\r\nfavour of a communication from C. L. on such a subject, seems to\r\nrequire a distinguished place; his paper is therefore selected to\r\nprematurely herald the fame of the celebrated crier of “old wigs” in odd\r\nfashioned days, when wigs were a common and necessary addition to every\r\nperson’s dress.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCE OF SIR JEFFERY DUNSTAN\r\n\r\nBY C. L.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nTo your account of sir Jeffery Dunstan in columns 829-30 (where, by an\r\nunfortunate Erratum the effigies of _two Sir Jefferys_ appear, when the\r\nuppermost figure is clearly meant for sir Harry Dimsdale) you may add,\r\nthat the writer of this has frequently met him in his latter days, about\r\n1790 or 1791, returning in an evening, after his long day’s itinerancy,\r\nto his domicile--a wretched shed in the most beggarly purlieu of Bethnal\r\nGreen, a little on this side the Mile-end Turnpike. The lower figure in\r\nthat leaf most correctly describes his then appearance, except that no\r\ngraphic art can convey an idea of the general squalor of it, and of his\r\nbag (his constant concomitant) in particular. Whether it contained “old\r\nwigs” at that time I know not, but it seemed a fitter repository for\r\nbones snatched out of kennels, than for any part of a Gentleman’s dress\r\neven at second hand.\r\n\r\nThe Ex-member for Garrat was a melancholy instance of a great man whose\r\npopularity is worn out. He still carried his sack, but it seemed a part\r\nof his identity rather than an implement of his profession; a badge of\r\npast grandeur; could any thing have divested him of _that_, he would\r\nhave shown a “poor forked animal” indeed. My life upon it, it contained\r\nno curls at the time I speak of. The most decayed and spiritless\r\nremnants of what was once a peruke would have scorned the filthy case;\r\nwould absolutely have “burst its cearments.” No, it was empty, or\r\nbrought home bones, or a few cinders possibly. A strong odour of burnt\r\nbones, I remember, blended with the scent of horse-flesh seething into\r\ndog’s meat, and only relieved a little by the breathings of a few brick\r\nkilns, made up the atmosphere of the delicate suburban spot, which this\r\ngreat man had chosen for the last scene of his earthly vanities. The cry\r\nof “old wigs” had ceased with the possession of any such fripperies; his\r\nsack might have contained not unaptly a little mould to scatter upon\r\nthat grave, to which he was now advancing; but it told of vacancy and\r\ndesolation. His quips were silent too, and his brain was empty as his\r\nsack; he slank along, and seemed to decline popular observation. If a\r\nfew boys followed him, it seemed rather from habit, than any expectation\r\nof fun.\r\n\r\n            Alas! how changed from _him_,\r\n    The life of humour, and the soul of whim,\r\n    Gallant and gay on Garrat’s hustings proud.\r\n\r\nBut it is thus that the world rewards its favourites in decay. What\r\nfaults he had, I know not. I have heard something of a peccadillo or so.\r\nBut some little deviation from the precise line of rectitude, might have\r\nbeen winked at in so tortuous and stigmatic a frame. Poor Sir Jeffery!\r\nit were well if some M. P.’s in earnest have passed their parliamentary\r\nexistence with no more offences against integrity, than could be laid to\r\nthy charge! A fair dismissal was thy due, not so unkind a degradation;\r\nsome little snug retreat, with a bit of green before thine eyes, and not\r\na burial alive in the fetid beggaries of Bethnal. Thou wouldst have\r\nended thy days in a manner more appropriate to thy pristine dignity,\r\ninstalled in munificent mockery (as in mock honours you had lived)--a\r\nPoor Knight of Windsor!\r\n\r\nEvery distinct place of public speaking demands an oratory peculiar to\r\nitself. The forensic fails within the walls of St. Stephen. Sir Jeffery\r\nwas a living instance of this, for in the flower of his popularity an\r\nattempt was made to bring him out upon the stage (at which of the winter\r\ntheatres I forget, but I well remember the anecdote) in the part of\r\n_Doctor Last_.[222] The announcement drew a crowded house; but\r\nnotwithstanding infinite tutoring--by Foote, or Garrick, I forget\r\nwhich--when the curtain drew up, the heart of Sir Jeffery failed, and he\r\nfaultered on, and made nothing of his part, till the hisses of the house\r\nat last in very kindness dismissed him from the boards. Great as his\r\nparliamentary eloquence had shown itself; brilliantly as his off-hand\r\nsallies had sparkled on a hustings; they here totally failed him.\r\nPerhaps he had an aversion to borrowed wit; and, like my Lord\r\nFoppington, disdained to entertain himself (or others) with the forced\r\nproducts of another man’s brain. Your man of quality is more diverted\r\nwith the natural sprouts of his own.\r\n\r\n  C. L.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GARRETT OATH.\r\n\r\nAlmost all that can be said of the oath of qualification, administered\r\nto the electors at the Garrett hustings, has been already said in the\r\nletter to Dr. Ducarel, on column 826. It was printed, and from one of\r\nthese once manifold documents, which are now so rare as not to be\r\nattainable in a perfect state, the following title, &c. is copied\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\n  “The\r\n  OATH\r\n  of\r\n  QUALIFICATION\r\n  for the\r\n  _Ancient Borough of_\r\n  GARRAT\r\n  _According as it stands in the\r\n  Old Record handed down to us_\r\n  By the\r\n  GRAND VOLGEE\r\n  by order of the Great\r\n  CHIN KAW CHIPO\r\n  _First_ EMPEROR of the MOON\r\n  Anno Mundi 75.\r\n\r\n“THAT you have been admitted peaceably and quietly into possession of a\r\nFreehold--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Here the original, referred to, is so defective as not to be copyable.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n----“within the said manor of GARRAT; and that you did (_bona fide_)\r\nkeep (_ad rem_) possession ---- (_durante bene placito_) without any\r\nlet, suit, hindrance, or molestation whatever ----\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “SWORN (_coram nobis_) at our       }\r\n  Great Hall on Garrat Green,         }\r\n  covered with the plenteous harvest  }\r\n  of the Goddess Ceres, and dedicated }\r\n  to the Jovial God Comus.”           }\r\n\r\nMore than this it is not possible to give of the Garrett oath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring a Garrett election all Wandsworth was in an uproar. It was the\r\nresort of people of all descriptions, and the publicans entertained them\r\nas conveniently as possible; yet, on one occasion, the influx of\r\nvisiters was so immense that every ordinary beverage was exhausted, and\r\nwater sold at twopence a glass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy “old John Jones,” “the doings at Wandsworth” on the election day are\r\ndescribed as “past description.”\r\n\r\nBesides the “hustings” at Garrett, scaffoldings and booths were erected\r\nin Wandsworth at every open space: these were filled with spectators to\r\nthe topmost rows, and boys climbed to the tops of the poles; flags and\r\ncolours were hung across the road; and the place was crowded by a dense\r\npopulation full of activity and noise. For accommodation to view the\r\nhumours of the day extraordinary prices were paid to the proveditors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn Jones remembers “when Foote the player came to Wandsworth, to have\r\na full view of all the goings on.” According to his account, the English\r\nAristophanes “paid nine guineas for the fore room at surgeon Squire’s,\r\nfacing the church, for himself and his friends to sit in and see the\r\nfun.” There was an immense scaffolding of spectators and mob-orators, at\r\nthe corner by the churchyard, opposite the window where Foote and his\r\ncompanions were seated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been already noticed, that Foote dramatised this mock election by\r\nhis “Mayor of Garratt:” the first edition, printed in 1764, is called “a\r\ncomedy in two acts; as it is performed at the theatre-royal in\r\nDrury-lane.” On turning to the “dramatis personæ,” it will be found he\r\nperformed Major Sturgeon himself, and, likewise, Matthew Mug in the same\r\npiece: Mrs. Clive playing Mrs. Sneak to Weston’s Jerry Sneak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFoote’s “Mayor of Garratt” may be deemed an outline of the prevailing\r\ndrollery and manners of the populace at Wandsworth: a scene or two here\r\nwill be amusing and in place. This dramatist sketched so much from the\r\nlife, that it is doubtful whether every marked character in his “comedy”\r\nhad not its living original. It is certain, that he drew Major Sturgeon\r\nfrom old Justice Lamb, a fishmonger at Acton, and a petty trading\r\njustice, whose daughter was married by Major Fleming, a gentleman also\r\n“in the commission of the peace,” yet every way a more respectable man\r\nthan his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nReferring, then, to Foote’s “comedy,” sir Jacob Jollup, who has a house\r\nat Garratt, holds a dialogue with his man Roger concerning the company\r\nthey expect--\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Are the candidates near upon coming?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Nic Goose, the tailor from Putney, they say, will be here in\r\n  a crack, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Has Margery fetch’d in the linen?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Yes, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Are the pigs and the poultry lock’d up in the barn?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Safe, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ And the plate and spoons in the pantry?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Yes, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Then give me the key; the mob will soon be upon us; and all\r\n  is fish that comes to their net. Has Ralph laid the cloth in the hall?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Yes, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Then let him bring out the turkey and chine, and be sure\r\n  there is plenty of mustard; and, d’ye hear, Roger, do you stand\r\n  yourself at the gate, and be careful who you let in.\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ I will, sir Jacob. [_exit._\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ So, now I believe thing: are pretty secure.--\r\n\r\n  _Mob._ [_Without._] Huzza!\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter Roger._\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ What’s the matter now, Roger?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ The electors desire to know if your worship has any body to\r\n  recommend?\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ By no means; let them be free in their choice: I shan’t\r\n  interfere.\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ And if your worship has any objection to Crispin Heeltap, the\r\n  cobler, being returning officer?\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ None, provided the rascal can keep himself sober. Is he\r\n  there?\r\n\r\n  _Roger._ Yes, sir Jacob. Make way there! stand further off from the\r\n  gate: here is madam Sneak in a chaise along with her husband.\r\n\r\nSir Jacob has work enough on his hands with his relations, and other\r\nvisiters, who have arrived to see the election from his mansion; he\r\ncalls his “son Bruin” to come in;--“we are all seated at table man; we\r\nhave but just time for a snack; the candidates are near upon coming.”\r\n\r\nThen, in another scene,--\r\n\r\n  _Enter Mob, with Heeltap at their head; some crying “a Goose,” others\r\n  “a Mug,” others “a Primmer.”_\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Silence, there; silence!\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ Hear neighbour Heeltap.\r\n\r\n  _2 Mob._ Ay, ay, hear Crispin.\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ Ay, ay, hear him, hear Crispin: he will put us into the model\r\n  of the thing at once.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Why then, silence! I say.\r\n\r\n  _All._ Silence.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Silence, and let us proceed, neighbours, with all the decency\r\n  and confusion usual on these occasions.\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ Ay, ay, there is no doing without that.\r\n\r\n  _All._ No, no, no.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Silence then, and keep the peace; what! is there no respect\r\n  paid to authority? Am not I the returning officer?\r\n\r\n  _All._ Ay, ay, ay.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Chosen by yourselves, and approved of by sir Jacob?\r\n\r\n  _All._ True, true.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Well then, be silent and civil; stand back there that\r\n  gentleman without a shirt, and make room for your betters. Where’s\r\n  Simon Snuffle the sexton?\r\n\r\n  _Snuffle._ Here.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Let him come forward; we appoint him our secretary: for Simon\r\n  is a scollard, and can read written hand; and so let him be respected\r\n  accordingly.\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ Room for master Snuffle.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Here, stand by me: and let us, neighbours, proceed to open the\r\n  premunire of the thing: but first, your reverence to the lord of the\r\n  manor: a long life and a merry one to our landlord, sir Jacob huzza!\r\n\r\n  _Mob._ Huzza!\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ How fares it, honest Crispin?\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Servant, master Sneak. Let us now open the premunire of the\r\n  thing, which I shall do briefly, with all the loquacity possible; that\r\n  is, in a medium way; which, that we may the better do it, let the\r\n  secretary read the names of the candidates, and what they say for\r\n  themselves; and then we shall know what to say of them. Master\r\n  Snuffle, begin.\r\n\r\n  _Snuffle._ [_Reads._] “To the worthy inhabitants of the ancient\r\n  corporation of Garratt: gentlemen, your votes and interest are humbly\r\n  requested in favour of Timothy Goose, to succeed your late worthy\r\n  mayor, Mr. Richard Dripping, in the said office, he being”----\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ This Goose is but a kind of gosling, a sort of sneaking\r\n  scoundrel. Who is he?\r\n\r\n  _Snuffle._ A journeyman tailor from Putney.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ A journeyman tailor! A rascal, has he the impudence to\r\n  transpire to be mayor? D’ye consider, neighbours, the weight of this\r\n  office? Why, it is a burthen for the back of a porter; and can you\r\n  think that this cross-legg’d cabbage-eating son of a cucumber, this\r\n  whey-fac’d ninny, who is but the ninth part of a man, has strength to\r\n  support it?\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ No Goose! no Goose!\r\n\r\n  _2 Mob._ A Goose!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Hold your hissing, and proceed to the next.\r\n\r\n  _Snuffle._ [_Reads._] “Your votes are desired for Matthew Mug.”\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ A Mug! a Mug!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Oh, oh, what you are ready to have a touch of the tankard; but\r\n  fair and soft, good neighbours, let us taste this master Mug before we\r\n  swallow him; and, unless I am mistaken, you’ll find him a bitter\r\n  draught.\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ A Mug! a Mug!\r\n\r\n  _2 Mob._ Hear him; hear master Heeltap.\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ A Mug! a Mug!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Harkye, you fellow with your mouth full of Mug, let me ask you\r\n  a question: bring him forward. Pray is not this Matthew Mug a\r\n  victualler?\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ I believe he may.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ And lives at the sign of the Adam and Eve?\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ I believe he may.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Now, answer upon your honour and as you are a gentleman, what\r\n  is the present price of a quart of home-brew’d at the Adam and Eve?\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ I don’t know.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ You lie, sirrah: an’t it a groat?\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ I believe it may.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Oh, may be so. Now, neighbours, here’s a pretty rascal; this\r\n  same Mug, because, d’ye see, state affairs would not jog glibly\r\n  without laying a farthing a quart upon ale; this scoundrel, not\r\n  contented to take things in a medium way, has had the impudence to\r\n  raise it a penny.\r\n\r\n  _Mob._ No Mug! no Mug!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ So, I thought I should crack Mr. Mug. Come, proceed to the\r\n  next, Simon.\r\n\r\n  _Snuffle._ The next upon the list is Peter Primmer, the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Ay, neighbours, and a sufficient man: let me tell you, master\r\n  Primmer is a man for my money; a man of learning, that can lay down\r\n  the law: why, adzooks, he is wise enough to puzzle the parson; and\r\n  then, how you have heard him oration at the Adam and Eve of a Saturday\r\n  night, about Russia and Prussia. ’Ecod, George Gage, the exciseman, is\r\n  nothing at all to un.\r\n\r\n  _4 Mob._ A Primmer.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Ay, if the folks above did but know him. Why, lads, he will\r\n  make us all statesmen in time.\r\n\r\n  _2 Mob._ Indeed!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Why, he swears as how all the miscarriages are owing to the\r\n  great people’s not learning to read.\r\n\r\n  _3 Mob._ Indeed!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ “For,” says Peter, says he, “if they would but once submit to\r\n  be learned by me, there is no knowing to what a pitch the nation might\r\n  rise.”\r\n\r\n  _1 Mob._ Ay, I wish they would.\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ Crispin, what, is Peter Primmer a candidate?\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ He is, master Sneak.\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ Lord I know him, mun, as well as my mother: why, I used to\r\n  go to his lectures to Pewterers’-hall, ’long with deputy Firkin.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Like enough.\r\n\r\n  _Mob._ [_Without._] Huzza!\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Gad-so! the candidates are coming. [_Exeunt Mob, &c._\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter Sir Jacob Jollup, Bruin, and Mrs. Bruin, through the garden\r\n  gate._\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ Well, son Bruin, how d’ye relish the corporation of Garratt?\r\n\r\n  _Bruin._ Why, lookye, sir Jacob, my way is always to speak what I\r\n  think; I don’t approve on’t at all.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. B._ No?\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ And what’s your objection?\r\n\r\n  _Bruin._ Why, I was never over fond of your May-games: besides\r\n  corporations are too serious things; they are edgetools, sir Jacob.\r\n\r\n  _Sir J._ That they are frequently tools, I can readily grant: but I\r\n  never heard much of their edge.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we find the knight exclaiming--\r\n\r\n_Sir J._ Hey-day! What, is the election over already?\r\n\r\n_Enter Crispin, Heeltap, &c._\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Where is master Sneak!\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ Here, Crispin.\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ The ancient corporation of Garratt, in consideration of your\r\n  great parts and abilities, and out of respect to their landlord, sir\r\n  Jacob, have unanimously chosen you mayor.\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ Me? huzza! Good lord, who would have thought it? But how came\r\n  master Primmer to lose it?\r\n\r\n  _Heel._ Why, Phil Fleam had told the electors, that master Primmer was\r\n  an Irishman; and so they would none of them give their vote for a\r\n  foreigner.\r\n\r\n  _Sneak._ So then I have it for certain.\r\n\r\n  [_Huzza!_\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION FOR GARRETT,\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1781.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Sir William and Lady Blase’s Equipage,~\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE SPREAD EAGLE AND THE RAM AT WANDSWORTH, ON THE ROAD TO\r\nGARRETT.]\r\n\r\nThis engraving is from another large unpublished drawing by Green, and\r\nis very curious. Being topographically correct, it represents the signs\r\nof the inns at Wandsworth as they then stood; the Spread Eagle carved on\r\na pillar, and the Ram opposite painted and projecting. The opening, seen\r\nbetween the buildings on the Spread Eagle side, is the commencement of\r\nGarrett-lane, which runs from Wandsworth to Tooting, and includes the\r\nmock borough of Garrett.\r\n\r\nThis animated scene is full of character. The boat is drawn by horses,\r\nwhich could not be conspicuously represented here without omitting\r\ncertain bipeds; it is in the act of turning up Garrett-lane. Its chief\r\nfigure is “my lady Blase” dressed beyond the extreme, and into broad\r\ncaricature of the fashion of the times. “I remember her very well,” says\r\nMrs. ----, of Wandsworth, “and so I ought, for I had a good hand in the\r\ndressing of her. I helped to put together many a good pound of wool to\r\nmake her hair up. I suppose it was more than three feet high at least:\r\nand as for her stays, I also helped to make them, down in Anderson’s\r\nbarn: they were neither more nor less than a washing tub without the\r\nbottom, well covered, and bedizened outside to look like a stomacher.\r\nShe was to be the lady of sir William Blase, one of the candidates, and,\r\nas she sat in his boat, she was one of the drollest creatures, for size\r\nand dress, that ever was seen. I was quite a girl at the time, and we\r\nmade her as comical and as fine as possible.”\r\n\r\nIn Green’s drawing, here engraven in miniature, there is an excellent\r\ngroup, which from reduction the original has rendered almost too small\r\nto be noticed without thus pointing it out. It consists of a fellow, who\r\nappears more fond of his dog than of his own offspring; for, to give the\r\nanimal as good a sight of lady Blase as he had himself, he seats him on\r\nhis own shoulders, and is insensible to the entreaty of one of his\r\nchildren to occupy the dog’s place. His wife, with another child by her\r\nside, carries a third with its arms thrust into the sleeves of her\r\nhusband’s coat, which the fellow has pulled off, and given her to take\r\ncare of, without the least regard to its increase of her living burthen.\r\nBefore them are dancing dogs, which have the steady regard of a “most\r\nthinking” personage in a large wig. Another wigged, or, rather, an\r\nover-wigged character, is the little crippled “dealer and chapman,” who\r\nis in evident fear of a vociferous dog, which is encouraged to alarm him\r\nby a mischievous urchin. The one-legged veteran, with a crutch and a\r\nglass in his hand, seems mightily to enjoy the two horsemen of the mop\r\nand broom. We see that printed addresses were posted, by an elector\r\ngiving his unmixed attention to one of them pasted on the Ram sign-post.\r\nThe Pierrot-dressed character, with spectacles and a guitar, on an ass\r\nled by a woman, is full of life; and the celebrated “Sam House,” the\r\nbald-headed publican of Westminster, with a pot in his hand, is here\r\nenjoying the burlesque of an election, almost as much, perhaps, as he\r\ndid the real one in his own “city and liberties” the year before, when\r\nhe distinguished himself, by his activity, in behalf of Mr. Fox, whose\r\ncause he always zealously supported by voice and fist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last Westminster election, wherein Sam House engaged, was in 1784,\r\nwhen on voting, and being asked his trade by the poll-clerk, he\r\nanswered, “I am a publican and republican.” This memorable contest is\r\ndescribed by the well-known colonel Hanger. He says:--\r\n\r\n“The year I came to England the contested election for Westminster,\r\n(Fox, Hood, and Wray, candidates,) took place. The _walking_ travellers,\r\n_Spillard_ and _Stewart_; the _Abyssinian Bruce_, who _feasted on\r\nsteaks_ cut from the _rump_ of a _living_ ox; and various others, who,\r\nin their extensive travels, encountered _wild beasts_, _serpents_, and\r\n_crocodiles_; _breakfasted_ and _toasted muffins_ on the _mouth_ of a\r\n_Volcano_; whom hunger compelled to banquet with joy on the _leavings_\r\nof a _lion_ or _tiger_, or on the _carcase_ of a dead _alligator_; who\r\nboast of smoking the pipe of peace with the _little carpenter_, and the\r\n_mad dog_; on having lived on terms of the strictest intimacy with the\r\n_Cherokees_, the _Chickasaws_, the _Chuctaws_, and with all the _aws_\r\nand _ees_ of that immense continent, who from the more temperate shore\r\nof the Mississippi, have extended their course to the burning soil of\r\nIndia, and to the banks of the Ganges; from the frozen ocean to the\r\nbanks of the more genial Po;--may boast _their_ experience of the world,\r\nand _their_ knowledge of human life: but _no one_, in my opinion, has\r\nseen _real life_, or can know it, unless he has taken an active part in\r\na _contested election for Westminster_!\r\n\r\n“In no school can a man be taught a better lesson of human life;--there\r\ncan he view human nature in her basest attire; riot, murder, and\r\ndrunkenness, are the order of the day, and _bribery_ and perjury walk\r\nhand in hand:--for men who had no pretensions to vote, were to be found\r\nin the garden in as great plenty as turnips, and at a very moderate rate\r\nwere induced to poll.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman, to make himself of any considerable use to either party,\r\nmust possess a number of engaging, familiar, and condescending\r\nqualities; he must help a porter up with his load, shake hands with a\r\nfisherman, pull his hat off to an oyster wench, kiss a ballad-singer,\r\nand be familiar with a beggar. If, in addition to these amiable\r\nqualities, he is a tolerable good boxer, can play a good stick, and in\r\nthe evening drink a pailful of all sorts of liquors, in going the rounds\r\nto solicit voters at their various clubs, then, indeed, he is a most\r\nhighly finished useful agent. In all the above accomplishments and\r\nsciences, except drinking, which I never was fond of, I have the vanity\r\nto believe that I arrived nearer to perfection than any of my rivals. I\r\nshould be ungrateful, indeed, if I did not testify my thanks to those\r\ngallant troops of high rank and distinguished fame--the knights of the\r\nstrap, and the black diamond knights, (the Irish chairmen and coal\r\nheavers,) who displayed such bravery and attachment to our cause.”[223]\r\n\r\nThis was the cause to which Sam House was attached; and, perhaps, there\r\nwas not greater difference between the scenes described by Hanger, and\r\nthose at Garrett, than between the same scenes, and more recent ones, on\r\nsimilar occasions in the same city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat has hitherto been related concerning the Garrett election, in 1781,\r\nis in consequence of the editor having had recourse to the remarkable\r\ndrawings from whence the present engravings have been made. From that\r\ncircumstance he was strongly induced to inquire concerning it, and, as a\r\nfaithful historian, he has recorded only what he is able to\r\nauthenticate. A few facts relating to the elections between that period\r\nand a much later one, are so blended as to defy positive appropriation\r\nto particular dates, from want of accurate recollection in the persons\r\nrelating them; they are, therefore, annexed, as general traits of the\r\nusual mode of conducting these burlesques.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt one of the Garrett elections, after 1781, there was a sir Christopher\r\nDash’em started as candidate. “Old John Jones” says he was a waterman,\r\nthat his real name was Christopher Beachham, (perhaps Beauchamp,) that\r\nhe was a fellow of “exceeding humour” and ready wit, and, as an instance\r\nof it, that being carried before a magistrate for cutting fences and\r\nposts, the justice was informed that the delinquent was no other than\r\nthe celebrated sir Christopher Dash’em.--“Oh,” said the justice, “you\r\nare sir Christopher Dash’em, are you?”--“It’s what they please to style\r\nme,” observed sir Christopher.--“Oh! oh!” remarked the magistrate, “I\r\nhave _heard_ of your _character_ a long while ago.”--“Then,” said sir\r\nChristopher, “I’ll be greatly obliged to your worship to tell me where\r\nit is, for I _lost_ it a long while ago.”\r\n\r\nSir Solomon Hiram, another Garrett candidate, was a shrewd, clever\r\ncarpenter, of Battersea, named Thomas Solomon. It was his constant\r\nsaying, that he “never bowed to wooden images,” by which he meant rank\r\nwithout talent. He succeeded in his election. The motto on his carriages\r\nwas “Gin gratis! Porter for nothing!”\r\n\r\nOur living chronicler, “John Jones,” says, that on the day of election,\r\nsir Solomon Hiram was “dressed like an old king, in a scarlet coat with\r\ngold lace, large sleeves with very large hanging cuffs; a wig such as\r\nGeorge the Second wore, with large falling curls, and the tail in a silk\r\nbag: he held a roll of parchment in his hand, and looked for all the\r\nworld--like a king.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor must “old John Jones” himself be forgotten, for he rode as “master\r\nof the horse” at four elections in a marvellous proper dress. He was\r\nmounted on the largest dray horse that could be got, in the full\r\nregimentals of the Surrey yeomanry, grey, blue, and red: he had a cap on\r\nhis head twenty-three inches high; and bore in his hand a sword seven\r\nfeet long and four inches wide, like the sword of the “ancient and\r\nhonourable Lumber Troop.” His boots were up to his hips, and he wore\r\nwooden spurs thirteen inches long, with steel rowels three inches in\r\ndiameter. The mane of his horse was plaited with ears of corn, denoting\r\na plentiful harvest and the coming cheapness of bread; and he had two\r\npages to lead his horse.\r\n\r\nThe “Garrett cavalry” or troop of “horse guards,” of which “John Jones”\r\nwas the commander, were forty boys of all ages and sizes, for whom\r\nflannel uniforms were purposely made, of the exact pattern of the Surrey\r\nyeomanry. They wore enormous cockades made of shavings, and were put\r\na-straddle on horses of all sizes, and sorted thereto, as much as\r\npossible, by contraries. The smallest boys were on the largest horses,\r\nand the biggest boys on the least. It was their duty to join the\r\ncandidates’ procession, and with the “master of the horse” at their\r\nhead, proceed to the hustings in order “to preserve the freedom of\r\nelection.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Richmond theatre, about thirty years ago, Foote’s “Mayor of Garratt”\r\nwas performed for the benefit of Follett, a celebrated comedian and\r\nclown, and he was so happy as to secure sir Solomon Hiram, with every\r\nperson who figured at Garratt, to represent the election as it had been\r\nreally held just before. Sir Solomon came on the stage “just like a\r\nKing,” with “old John Jones” on his right, as “master of the horse,” and\r\n“Robert Bates,” another great officer, on his left, all in their full\r\nelection uniforms. The house was crowded to excess. Sir Solomon\r\ndelivered all his speeches, “old John Jones” commanded and manœuvred his\r\ntroop of horse, and every thing was performed that had been exhibited at\r\nWandsworth, or on the hustings, by the real characters in the election.\r\nThere was so great an audience, that the audience crowded on the stage,\r\nand it was with difficulty that the scenes were shifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JEFFERY DUNSTAN.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1785, sir John Harper, who had succeeded to the\r\nrepresentation of Garrett, by the unbiassed choice of the electors,\r\nvacated his seat by death, and sir Jeffery Dunstan again became a\r\ncandidate for their suffrages.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished individual was a child of chance--a foundling. He was\r\npicked up in the year 1759 at a churchwarden’s door in St. Dunstan’s in\r\nthe East, and not being owned, was reared in the workhouse so as\r\nultimately to attain about two-thirds the usual height of manhood, with\r\nknock-knees, and a disproportionately large head. At twelve years old,\r\nhe was bound apprentice for nine years to the art, trade, mystery, and\r\noccupation of a green grocer; this was a long time to serve, and\r\nJeffery, soaring to independence, adopted as a principle that “time was\r\nmade for slaves, and not for freemen;” he therefore broke through time\r\nand servitude, and ran away to Birmingham. It was his pride that, though\r\nthe hard labour in the factories of the “workshop of Europe” increased\r\nthe malformation of his person, it added strength to his mind; and in\r\n1776, he returned to London with his knees and ideas knocking together\r\nmuch more than before. He soon afterwards formed a matrimonial\r\nconnection, and had two daughters, whom he called “Miss Nancy” and “Miss\r\nDinah,” and who testified their filial politeness by uniformly calling\r\nhim “papa.”\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of sir Jeffery’s life, he was a friend to “good\r\nmeasures”--especially those for “spirituous liquors;” and he never saw\r\nthe inside of a pot without going to the bottom of it. This\r\ndetermination of character created difficulties to him: for his freedom\r\nwas not always regulated by the doctrines of the great Blackstone “on\r\nthe rights of persons,” and consequences ensued that were occasionally\r\ninjurious to sir Jeffery’s face and eyes. The same enlightened judge’s\r\nviews of “the rights of things” do not seem to have been comprehended by\r\nsir Jeffery: he had long made free with the porter of manifold pots, and\r\nat length he made free with a few of the pots. For this he was\r\n“questioned,” in the high commission court of oyer and terminer, and\r\nsuffered an imprisonment, which, according to his manner of life, and\r\nhis notions of the liberty of the subject, was frivolous and vexatious.\r\nOn his liberation, he returned to an occupation he had long followed,\r\nthe dealing in “old wigs,” and some circumstances developed in the\r\ncourse of the preceding inquiry seem to favour a supposition, that the\r\nbag he carried had enabled him to conceal his previous “free trade” in\r\npots. But, be that as it might, it is certain that to his armorial\r\nbearings of four wigs, he added a quart pot for a crest.\r\n\r\nFrom the period that he obtained a “glorious minority” by his opposition\r\nto sir John Harper for Garrett, he looked for the first opening in the\r\nrepresentation of that borough with a view to fill it himself. On the\r\ndeath of sir John, he issued an address to the electors, committees were\r\nformed, and an active canvass was commenced at every public-house to\r\nwhich the constituent body resorted for refreshment and solace. On the\r\nday of election, sir Jeffery left London in a splendid phaeton, with a\r\nbody of friends in every possible description of vehicle, from a\r\ncoal-waggon to a wheel-barrow drawn by dogs; the procession extended a\r\nmile in length, and sir Jeffery Dunstan was elected by an immense\r\nmajority. At successive elections he was successively successful, and\r\nmaintained his seat for Garrett until his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the answers to the editor’s request for particulars concerning\r\nthe Garrett election, is the following letter:--\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--After frequently promising to do something for the _Every-Day\r\nBook_, I yesterday threw hastily together a few particulars regarding\r\n“sir Jeffery Dunstan:” they are authentic and at your service. Sir\r\nJeffery, towards the latter part of his life, had a hoarse rough voice\r\nand bad utterance, from having lost the whole of his front teeth. The\r\nmanner of his losing them is curious enough, and worth relating. He was\r\none evening reciting his speeches at the “London Hospital” public-house,\r\nWhitechapel, where some young students were amusing themselves, who,\r\nseeing “sir Jeffery” in “merry mood,” hit upon a plan to have the teeth\r\nout of his head. A bargain was soon struck, ten shillings were clubbed\r\namong them, a pint of “Hodges’s best” was brought in--sir Jeffery sat\r\ndown in the chair, and out came tooth the first--in the same manner out\r\ncame another--and so, time after time, the wicked wags proceeded till\r\nthey got them all.\r\n\r\nAt this house sir Jeffery was near losing his life, in addition to his\r\nteeth. He was “in the chair,” as usual, which was placed on the table,\r\nand he was supported by his friends “Ray the tinker,” who now lies in\r\nthe same grave with him, and a “sir Charles Hartis,” a deformed fidler,\r\nand an unsuccessful candidate for Garratt honours. Such a _trio_ was\r\nscarcely ever seen, and very attractive. The sixpences collected from\r\nvisiters, on entering, lay in a plate on the table, and “sir Jeffery”\r\nwas on his legs giving them “old wigs,” in his best style, when, being\r\ntop-heavy with liquor, he suddenly lost his balance, and over he went.\r\n“Ray the tinker” was upset, and the fiddle of “sir Charles” knocked into\r\nthe fire; in a moment the candles were put out, and all was darkness and\r\nconfusion; when a light was brought, sir Jeffery and the money were both\r\nmissing, and he was considered the purloiner: but the fact was, some\r\nknaves who had an eye to the cash, took advantage of sir Jeffery’s fall,\r\nblew out the lights, stole the money, and picking up “sir Jeff” at the\r\nsame moment, dragged him out of the house to fix the fraud on him. The\r\npoor fellow was found the next morning by some workmen almost frozen to\r\ndeath and pennyless, in a miserable hole, into which they had dropped\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nSir Jeffery wore his shirt open, and the collar turned down. This was in\r\nhim a sort of pride; for he would frequently in an exulting manner say\r\n_to inferiors_, “I’ve got a _collar_ to my shirt, sir.” In life his\r\nface was dark and dirty, but when coffined, says Mr. Thomas Michael, his\r\nskin was remarkably fair and clear.\r\n\r\nSir Jeffery once kept an ass that had but one ear, the other being close\r\ncropped off; with this poor creature, who carried the “wigs, &c.” he for\r\nmany years collected a crowd but a few paces from the writer’s\r\nhabitation. His wit and smart sayings flew about. Now the joke fell on\r\nhimself, and now on his one-eared ass. Then he varied the cry of “old\r\nwigs,” by mimicking another’s singing-cry of, “lilly, lilly, lilly,\r\nlilly white--sand oh!” After the pence had well tumbled in, he would\r\nretire to his favourite retreat, the “Horse and Leaping Bar,” to dine on\r\n“duck and green peas,” or “roast goose and apple sauce,” &c.\r\n\r\nAt this house, which is on the south side of the high street, “sir\r\nJeff,” in a “regular” manner, got “regularly drunk.” Here he sung the\r\n“London cries;” recited his mock speeches on the corruptions of\r\nparliament; and, placed in an arm chair on the table, nightly afforded\r\nsport to a merry company.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had sir Jeffery ceased to breathe, than the resurrection men\r\nwere on the alert to obtain his body. They had nearly succeeded prior to\r\ninterment, by drawing him through the window of the room in which he\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nThe surgeons of the day were eager to obtain a prize, but their hopes\r\nwere disappointed by the late John Liptrap, esq. who had the body\r\nremoved to a place of safety. This gentleman paid all the expences of\r\nsir Jeffery’s funeral; a grave ten feet deep was dug close to the north\r\nwall of the watchhouse of St. Mary, Whitechapel, where he now lies. The\r\nhead of the coffin somewhat undermines the church-rail, and the public\r\nfootway. His wife lies at his feet, and his daughter Dinah, sleeps the\r\n“sleep of death” at his side.\r\n\r\n“Miss Nancy,”--sir Jeffery used to say, “Miss Nancy, make the gentlemen\r\na curtsey,”--“Miss Nancy” survived them all; she married a costermonger,\r\nor to speak a little more politely, a knight of the “whip and hamper,”\r\nwho is said to have added to his avocations that of snatching bodies for\r\nthe surgeons, till death, the final snatcher, snatched him. Miss Nancy\r\nstill survives.\r\n\r\nRespecting sir Jeffery Dunstan’s death, his grave digger, Thomas\r\nMichael, relates this story. Sir Jeffery had called in at the sign of\r\nthe Red Lion, opposite the London Hospital, a house where low company\r\nresorted. It was then kept by one George Float (who afterwards met a\r\npremature death himself) who supplied sir Jeffery with liquor at the\r\nexpense of others, till he was completely “_non compos_.” He was then\r\ncarried to the door of his house on the north side of the “Ducking\r\npond,” and there left to perish, for he was found a corpse on the same\r\nspot the next morning.\r\n\r\nIt was strongly suspected that sir Jeffery’s death was purposely caused\r\nby resurrection men, for the liquor he was made to swallow was drugged.\r\nOne of this fraternity endeavoured to stop the burial of the body, by\r\npretending a relation from Ireland was on his way to claim it. The\r\nfellow disguised himself, and endeavoured to personate a native of that\r\ncountry, but the fraud was detected.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  _June 19, 1823._\r\n\r\n  T. W. L.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis obliging correspondent, who knew so much respecting sir Jeffery\r\nDunstan, was likely to furnish more; particular inquiries were therefore\r\naddressed to him by letter, and he has since obligingly communicated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nFOR THE EVERY-DAY BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Sir Jeffery Dunstan’s descendants._--_Sir Jeffery’s\r\n  Hut._--_Whitechapel Obelisk._--_Dipping for old wigs._\r\n\r\nTo oblige Mr. Hone I set out in pursuit of “Miss Nancy,” who is now\r\ncalled “lady Ann,” thinking she might be able to furnish me with\r\nparticulars regarding her father, “sir Jeffery,” and the “Garrett\r\nelection.” Near the sign of the “Grave Maurice,” in the “road side” of\r\nWhitechapel, I addressed myself to a clean, elderly looking woman, whose\r\nbrow bespoke the cares of three score years at least, and asked her if\r\nshe could inform me whether sir Jeffery’s daughter, “Miss Nancy” was\r\nliving or not? “Lord bless you, sir!” said she, “living! aye; I saw her\r\npass with her cats-meat barrow not five minutes ago; and just now I saw\r\nrunning by, a little girl, the fourth generation from sir Jeffery.” I\r\nsoon ascertained that “lady Ann” lived with her son and his wife, at No.\r\n7, North-street, opposite the Jews’ burying ground, where I knocked\r\nboldly, and, to my surprise, was answered by a fine dark little girl of\r\neleven, that her grandmother could not be seen, because she was “very\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening, by appointment I called, and saw the same\r\nlittle girl again, and was told her father was “drunk also,” and that\r\nher mother had instructed her to say, that many similar applications had\r\nbeen made, and “a deal of money offered,” for the information I sought;\r\nwhich spoke in plain terms they had nothing to communicate, or if they\r\nhad, a good price must be paid for it.\r\n\r\nRecollecting that I had been informed that a good likeness of “sir\r\nJeffery” was to be seen at the “Blind Beggar,” near the turnpike, and\r\nsupposing it not unlikely, from that circumstance, that the landlord of\r\nthat house might know more of the man than I did myself, I resorted\r\nthither. The bar was crowded with applicants for “full proof,” and “the\r\nbest cordials.” I took my station at the lower end, and calling for a\r\nglass of ale, it was served me by Mr. Porter himself, when I took the\r\nopportunity of asking him if he had not a portrait of sir Jeffery\r\nDunstan in his parlour; he said there had been one there till lately,\r\nbut that during the alterations it was removed. On my right hand was a\r\nman with a pint of ale and a glass in his hand, and a woman with him,\r\nseated on the top of a barrel. At this juncture the man called out to\r\nthe landlord, “is it not somebody that ‘_I knows_,’ that you are talking\r\nabout?” An answer was given in the affirmative. I looked at the man, and\r\nperceiving that he was about my own age, observed that his years, like\r\nmine, did not warrant much personal knowledge of the person of whom we\r\nhad been speaking. “Why,” said Mr. Porter, smiling, “that is his\r\ngrandson; that is sir Jeffery’s grandson.” I, too, could not help\r\nsmiling on calling to mind that this was the very man that was “also\r\ndrunk,” and that this, his money-loving wife, who had denied me an\r\ninterview, I was addressing. I told them the nature of my visit to their\r\nhouse. She said her daughter had informed her of every thing. I then, to\r\nuse a nautical phrase, “boxed all points of the compass,” without\r\neffect. They evidently knew nothing, or did not care to know; the wife,\r\nhowever, told me that her sister, who was either dead, or “abroad,” knew\r\n“all sir Jeffery’s speeches from the beginning to end;” and the husband\r\nrecounted ’squire Liptrap’s kindness in many times escorting and\r\nprotecting, by a file of soldiers, his grandfather to his home; and\r\nsaid, moreover, that _he_ himself was blamed for not claiming the\r\n_goold_ (gold) picked up with the foundling which is now accumulating in\r\nthe funds of St. Dunstan’s parish.\r\n\r\nI urged, “that none of us had any thing to boast of in point of\r\nancestry, and that were I sir Jeffery’s grandson, my _great_\r\ngrandfather’s _great_ natural talent and ready flow of wit would induce\r\nme to acknowledge him as my _great_ ancestor under any circumstances.”\r\nThis produced nothing more than that his grandfather, “though he could\r\nneither read nor write, could speak many languages.” I left them--the\r\nhusband, as we say, “top heavy,” the wife expostulating to get him home,\r\nand at the same time observing they must be up by three o’clock in the\r\nmorning “to be off with the cart.”\r\n\r\nOn my road homewards, I turned up Court-street to “Ducking-pond side,”\r\nto take a view of “sir Jeffery’s hut;” it is adjoining his late patron’s\r\ndistillery, who permitted him to live there rent free. The door is\r\nbricked up, and it now forms part of a chandler’s shop. The thick black\r\nvolumes of smoke from the immense chimnies were rolling above my head to\r\nthe west, while beneath, in the same direction, came the pestiferous\r\nstench from those deadly slaughtering places for horses, that lie\r\nhuddled together, on the right. It brought to my mind Mr. Martin’s story\r\nin the “House,” of the poor starving condemned “animals” and the “truss\r\nof hay.” I turned hastily away from the scene, and I conjure thee,\r\nreader, go not near it, for it breathes\r\n\r\n    “Pestilence, rottenness, and death.”\r\n\r\nIn my preceding notice of “sir Jeffery and his ass,” perhaps I have not\r\nbeen sufficiently explicit. In the “season,” he would sometimes carry\r\nthe best of fruit in his hampers for sale, as well as his “bag of wigs.”\r\nThe allusion to the “duck and green peas,” &c. was a sort of joke, which\r\nsir Jeffery used constantly, in his witty way, to put off to\r\n“standers-by” when “lady Ann,” or “Miss Dinah,” came from their “lady\r\nmother” to inform him that his dinner was ready.\r\n\r\nAn elderly friend of mine perfectly well recollects sir Jeffery’s\r\n“one-eared ass,” his hamper of russetings, and sir Jeffery himself, with\r\nhis back placed against the side of the stone obelisk which then stood\r\nat the corner of the road, opposite Whitechapel church rails. There he\r\nkept the boys and girls at bay with the ready use of his hands; while\r\nhis ready tongue kept the elder folks constantly laughing. But where is\r\nthe stone obelisk. Gone--like sir Jeffery. The spirit of destruction,\r\nmiscalled improvement, wantonly threw it down. It fell in the pride of\r\nits age and glory, before Time’s effacing hand had marked it. Away with\r\ndestroyers, I say! They may have bettered the condition of the pathway\r\nby substituting an iron railway for one of wood, but have they done so\r\nby removing that excellent unoffending barrier, the “pillar of stone,”\r\nand placing in its stead a paltry old cannon choaked with a ball?\r\n\r\nI recollect in my boyish days I never passed that “obelisk” without\r\nlooking up, and reading on its sculptured sides, “twelve miles to\r\nRomford,” “seventeen to Epping.” Then it told the traveller westward,\r\nthe exact distance to the Royal Exchange and Hyde Park-corner. All\r\nbeyond it, in an easterly direction, to my youthful fancy, was fairy\r\nland; it spoke of pure air, green fields, and trees; of gentle\r\nshepherdesses, and arcadian swains. Delightful feelings, which only\r\nthose who are born and bred in towns can fully enter into! It had\r\noriginally a tongue of another description, for it seemed to say, in\r\nlegible characters, “this is the east-end corner of the metropolis,”--at\r\nleast it marked it as strongly as ever Hyde Park-corner did the west.\r\nPardon the digression, reader, and I will conclude.\r\n\r\nWhen sir Jeffery raised the cry of “old wigs,” the collecting of which\r\nformed his chief occupation, he had a peculiarly droll way of clapping\r\nhis hand to his mouth, and he called “old wigs, wigs, wigs!” in every\r\ndoorway. Some he disposed of privately, the rest he sold to the dealers\r\nin “Rag-fair.” In those days, “full bottoms” were worn by almost every\r\nperson, and it was no uncommon thing to hear sea-faring persons, or\r\nothers exposed to the cold, exclaim, “Well, winter’s at hand, and I must\r\ne’en go to Rosemary-lane, and have ‘_a dip_ for a wig.’” This “dipping\r\nfor wigs” was nothing more than putting your hand into a large barrel\r\nand pulling one up; if you liked it you paid your shilling, if not, you\r\ndipped again, and paid sixpence more, and so on. Then, also, the\r\ncurriers used them for cleaning the waste, &c. off the leather, and I\r\nhave no doubt would use them now if they could get them.\r\n\r\nSir Jeffery’s ideas of “quality” ran very high at all times, and were\r\nnever higher than when his daughter Nancy, “beautiful Miss Nancy,” was\r\nmarried to “lord Thompson,” a dustman.--“Twenty coaches,” said sir\r\nJeffery, “to lady Ann’s wedding, madam, and all filled with the first\r\nnobility.” A dustman on his wedding-day, in our days, is content with a\r\nseat in a far different vehicle, and being carried on his brethren’s\r\nshoulders to collect a little of the “needful” to get drunk with at\r\nnight. To the honour of “lord Thompson” be it said, after such a noble\r\nalliance, he soon “cut” the fraternity, and, as I have before observed,\r\nbecame a knight of the “whip and hamper,” _vulgo_ “a costermonger.”\r\n\r\n  _June 23, 1826._\r\n\r\n  T.

No committee determined on the claims of the “rival\r\ncandidates;” but the friends of sir George, an eminent dealer in apples\r\nand small vegetables near Stangate, maintained that he was the rightful\r\nmember in spite of sir Harry Dimsdale’s majority, which was alleged to\r\nhave been obtained by “bribery and corruption.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever distaste refinement may conceive to such scenes, it must not be\r\nforgotten that they constitute a remarkable feature in the manners of\r\nthe times.

JOHN’S EVE.\r\n\r\nAn ancient custom is still maintained by the inhabitants of Ripon, in\r\nYorkshire. On midsummer-eve, every housekeeper, who, in the course of\r\nthe year, has changed his residence into a new neighbourhood, spreads a\r\ntable before his door in the street, with bread, cheese, and ale, for\r\nthose who choose to resort to it. The guests, after staying awhile, if\r\nthe master is of ability, are invited to supper, and the evening is\r\nconcluded with mirth and good humour. The origin of this usage is\r\nunknown, but it probably was instituted for the purpose of introducing\r\nnew comers to an early acquaintance with their neighbours; or, with the\r\nmore laudable design of settling differences, by the meeting and\r\nmediation of friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late rev. Donald M‘Queen, of Kilmuir, in the Isle of Sky, in certain\r\nreflections on ancient customs preserved in that island, mentions what\r\nhe observed at this season in Ireland, where he conceives the catholic\r\nreligion to have accommodated itself to the ancient superstitions of the\r\nnatives, and grafted Christianity on pagan rites. He remarks, that “the\r\nIrish have ever been worshippers of fire and of Baal, and are so to this\r\nday. The chief festival in honour of the sun and fire is upon the 21st\r\nof June (23d?) when the sun arrives at the summer solstice, or rather\r\nbegins its retrograde motion.”\r\n\r\nMr. M‘Queen says, “I was so fortunate in the summer of 1782 as to have\r\nmy curiosity gratified. At the house where I was entertained, it was\r\ntold me that we should see at midnight the most singular sight in\r\nIreland, which was _the lighting of fires_ in honour of the sun.\r\nAccordingly, exactly at midnight, the _fires_ began to appear; and going\r\nup to the leads of the house, which had a widely extended view, I saw,\r\non a radius of thirty miles, all around, the fires burning on every\r\neminence which the country afforded. I had a farther satisfaction in\r\nlearning, from undoubted authority, that the people _danced round the\r\nfires_, and at the close went through these fires, and made their sons\r\nand daughters, together with their cattle, pass through the fire, and\r\nthe whole was concluded with religious solemnity.”[224]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eve of the summer solstice was a season of divinations in early\r\ntimes, and with one of these, described by a living bard, the day may\r\nconclude.\r\n\r\n_St. John’s Eve._\r\n\r\n      St. John the Baptist’s eve, how clear and bright\r\n      Sinks the broad sun upon the waveless sea!\r\n      Above, below, around him, shedding light,\r\n      All glorious and beautiful to see:\r\n      Garish as day, with night’s tranquillity\r\n      Reposing on all things.--“Then bid farewell\r\n      To household duties and its drudgery--\r\n      Come, one and all, and this fair maid shall tell\r\n    Who shall be wise henceforth, from this our festival.”\r\n\r\n      At this fair summons men and women were\r\n      Wont to assemble to decide their fate:\r\n      The first begotten child with rose-deck’d hair\r\n      Clad as a bride--her features all sedate,\r\n      Like one of holy calling--walk’d in state,\r\n      Before a bacchanal procession, loud\r\n      In their mirth--dancing with glee elate--\r\n      And shouting as they went--a motley crowd\r\n    Spreading along the shore, like shadow from a cloud.\r\n\r\n      And when arrived where they were summoned, they\r\n      With water from the ocean, to the brim\r\n      Fill a small vessel as the first essay\r\n      Towards making into _one_ the future--(dim\r\n      And dark as ’tis)--perceptible--to him\r\n      Alone this boon.--When a young virgin, fair,\r\n      With knocking heart that maketh her head swim\r\n      Lest she, her hopes, have wither’d--from her hair\r\n    Taketh a rose (her emblem) she had braided there;\r\n\r\n      And in the vessel drops it: Then the next,\r\n      Lovely as Hebe, from her faery zone,\r\n      Loosens the band that clasps it--somewhat vext\r\n      That like the rose it floats not--as ’tis known,\r\n      Or so imagined, that the charm hath flown\r\n      From what’s beneath the surface--so she deem’d\r\n      E’en when the next a diamond had thrown\r\n      Into the vessel, which, though sunken, seemed\r\n    A star upon the surface--it so upward gleamed.\r\n\r\n      After the fair ones, one and all, have cast\r\n      The bauble that each prized as somewhat dear,\r\n      The youths o’eranxious lest they be surpass’d\r\n      By maidens in their zealous acts sincere,\r\n      (Who crowd about them as they hover near\r\n      The sacred vase, observing them the while;)\r\n      Drop gold, and gems, and crystals for the ear,\r\n      Adorn’d with quaint devices, to beguile\r\n    With love, the heart that’s languishing, and free from guile.\r\n\r\n      Now all are gathered round in silence deep,\r\n      Heart throbbing maids, (like knots of flowers fair,\r\n      That bow unto the moon, whose soft rays sleep\r\n      Upon their beauty,) and youths flush’d with care\r\n      And keen anxiety, press forward there:\r\n      Meanwhile, the little cherub-bride draws nigh,\r\n      And from the vessel with her small hand fair,\r\n      Brings forth the gem that gladdens some one’s eye,\r\n    That grants to him or her the gift of prophecy.\r\n\r\n  _Barton Wilford._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·62.\r\n\r\n  [224] Cited by Brand.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 24.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. JOHN’S DAY.\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Day._\r\n\r\nThere are several interesting notices of usages on this day and\r\nmidsummer-eve, in vol. i. from col. 825 to 855. To the account of the\r\n“old London watch” there cited, from “Stow’s Survey,” should be added\r\nfrom Mr. Douce’s notes, quoted by Mr. Brand, that the watch “was laid\r\ndown in the twentieth year of Henry VIII;” and that “the chronicles of\r\nStow and Byddel assign the sweating sickness as a cause for\r\ndiscontinuing the watch.” Mr. Douce adds, that “Niccols says the watches\r\non midsummer and St. Peter’s-eve were laid down by licence from the\r\nking, ‘for that the cittie had then bin charged with the leavie of a\r\nmuster of 15,000 men.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK BONFIRES.\r\n\r\nA large paper copy of Brand’s “Popular Antiquities,” with MS. notes upon\r\nit by a gentleman of great reputation as an antiquary, and who has\r\npublicly distinguished himself by erudite dissertations on certain\r\nusages of ancient times, was some time ago most obligingly forwarded by\r\nthat gentleman to the editor of the _Every-Day Book_, with permission to\r\nuse the valuable manuscript additions. Hitherto it happened, from\r\npeculiar circumstances, that the advantage has not been available, but\r\nthis and future sheets will be enriched from that source. The gentleman\r\nreferred to cites from--“an Indenture of covenant between Thomas Oken of\r\n_Warwick_ and his twelve feoffees, dated the 20th of January, 13\r\nElizabeth,” (1571,) the following clause:--\r\n\r\n“Also that (the feoffees) their heirs or assignes shall lykewise\r\nyerelie, for ever, after the deceasse of the said Thomas Oken,\r\ndistribute, or cause to be distributed, and paide, out of the yerelie\r\nrevenewes of the forsaid lands and teneme’tes, to and amongest the\r\n_neyhgboures of the bonfire of the said T.

The streets are very early lined with soldiers; and, by\r\neight o’clock, every house-top and window is filled with spectators, at\r\nleast forty thousand exclusive of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock, after high mass at the great church, the show begins,\r\nby the townsmen being classed according to the different trades, walking\r\ntwo and two, each holding a burning wax candle, and at least a yard\r\nlong, and each dressed not in their best apparel, but in the oldest and\r\noddest fashion of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nAfter the several companies is a pageant containing an emblematical\r\nrepresentation of its trade, and this pageant is followed by patron\r\nsaints, most of which are of solid silver adorned with jewels. Bands of\r\nmusic, vocal and instrumental, attend the companies, the chorusses of\r\nwhich are very solemn.\r\n\r\nThen followed the friars and regular clergy, two and two, in the habits\r\nof their different orders, slow in their motion, and with the appearance\r\nof solemn piety.\r\n\r\nThen came the abbot in a most magnificent dress, richly adorned with\r\nsilver and gold, his train supported by two men in the dress of\r\ncardinals. The host was borne before him by an old white-bearded man of\r\na most venerable aspect, surrounded by a great number of boys in white\r\nsurplices, who strewed frankincense and myrrh under his feet; and four\r\nmen supported a large canopy of wrought silver over his head, while four\r\nothers sustained a large silver lantern, with a light in it at the end\r\nof a pole.\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded to the bottom of the street, where there was\r\nelevated a grand altar, ascended by a flight of steps; there the\r\nprocession stopped, while the abbot came from under his canopy and took\r\nthe host from the old man: ascending the altar, he held up the host in\r\nhis elevated hands, and the vast multitude instantly fell on their\r\nknees, from the house-tops down to the dirt in the streets below.\r\n\r\nAfter this solemnity, gaiety in the face of every one appeared, and the\r\nprocession recommenced.\r\n\r\nOther pageants came forth, from the great church, followed by a vast\r\nmoving machine, consisting of several circular stages to represent\r\n_Heaven_; on the bottom stages appeared many friars and nuns, each\r\nholding white lilies in their hands, and on the uppermost stage but one\r\nwere two figures, representing _Adam_ and _Eve_, and several winged\r\nangels, in white flowing garments. On the uppermost stage was one figure\r\nonly, to represent God, on whom all the eyes of the lower figures were\r\ndirected, with looks of adoration and humility; this machine was drawn\r\nby horses.\r\n\r\nNext followed an enormous figure to represent _Hell_. It was something\r\nlike an elephant, with a large head and eyes, and a pair of horns, on\r\nwhich several little devils, or rather boys dressed like devils, were\r\nsitting; the monster was hollow within, and the lower jaw was movable,\r\nby moving of which it frequently exhibited the inward contents, which\r\nwas filled with full-grown devils, who poured out liquid fire from the\r\n“jaws of hell.” At the same time, the figure was surrounded by a great\r\nnumber of external devils dressed in crape, with hideous masks and\r\ncurled tails.\r\n\r\nBetween the figures which represented “heaven” and “hell,” several young\r\nladies passed with wreaths of flowers on their heads, and palms in their\r\nhands, riding in elegant carriages. After _Hell_ followed old Lucifer\r\nhimself, armed with a pitchfork, and leading St. Michael the archangel\r\nin chains. Michael and Lucifer were followed by a person dressed in a\r\nkind of harlequin’s coat hung round with bells, holding a hoop in his\r\nhands, through which he frequently jumped, and showed many other feats\r\nof activity; but what, or who he represented I cannot say (except it\r\nwere a _fool_).\r\n\r\nThen came a grand carriage, covered with a superb canopy, from the\r\nmiddle of which hung a little dove; under the dove was a table covered\r\nwith a carpet, at which were sitting two women dressed in white, with\r\nwings, pointing upwards to the dove. They represented the salutation of\r\nthe Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nNext followed a group of dancing boys surrounding a stable, in which was\r\nseen the Virgin Mary again, and the child in the manger. This machine\r\nwas followed by another fool, like the former, with a hoop of bells.\r\n\r\nThe next machine was a fish, fifteen feet long, moved by men, on wheels,\r\nconcealed within; upon its back sat a boy, richly dressed, and playing\r\nupon a harp. The gold, silver, and jewels, which decorated this fish,\r\nwere valued at ten thousand pounds and were finished by the city\r\nmerchants, whose sons and daughters were the principal actors in the\r\nshow. After the fish came another fool, with a hoop, as before.\r\n\r\nThen appeared Joseph as flying from Egypt; a woman representing a virgin\r\nwith a young child upon her lap, and mounted on an ass, which was led by\r\nJoseph, who had a basket of tools on his back, and a long staff in his\r\nhand. Joseph and his spouse were attended by several devils, who beat\r\noff the people that crowded too close upon the procession: these two\r\nwere followed by a fourth fool, or hoop-dancer.\r\n\r\nThen came a large and magnificent carriage, on which sat a person\r\nrepresenting the _grand monarque_ sitting on a throne, dressed in his\r\nrobes, with a crown, ball, and sceptre, lying before him on a table\r\ncovered with embroidered velvet. His most christian majesty was attended\r\nby several devils, hoop-dancers, and banner-bearers.\r\n\r\nThen followed another machine bearing the _queen_ in her royal robes,\r\nattended by a great many ladies and maids of honour; the jewels of her\r\ncrown were said to be of vast value; on this stage there was a grand\r\nband of music, and many dancers richly attired.\r\n\r\nThen followed Bacchus, a large fat figure, dressed in coloured silk,\r\nattended by a great number of bacchanals holding goblets up to their\r\nmouths as in the act of drinking, with a few more devils and\r\nhoop-dancers.\r\n\r\nThen followed a kind of a sea triumph, in the front of which appeared\r\nNeptune with his trident and crown, in a large shell, surrounded by boys\r\ndressed in white, who were throwing out and drawing in a deep sea-lead,\r\nas sounding for land.\r\n\r\nSix men followed in white shirts, with poles twenty-five feet long,\r\ndecorated with bells and flowers; frequently shaking their poles, or\r\nendeavouring to break them; for he who could break one was exempted a\r\nwhole year from all parish duty.\r\n\r\nThe pole-bearers were followed by a large ship, representing a ship of\r\nwar drawn on wheels by horses, with sails spread, colours flying, and\r\nbrass guns on board fired off very briskly: on the quarter-deck stood\r\nthe admiral, captain and boatswain, who, when he whistled, brought forth\r\nthe sailors, some dancing, others heaving the log, and the tops filled\r\nwith boys.\r\n\r\nThe ship was followed by the representation of a large wood, with men in\r\nit dressed in green; a green scaly skin was drawn over their own, and\r\ntheir faces were masked to appear as savages, each squirting water at\r\nthe people from large pewter syringes. This piece of machinery, which\r\nwas very noble, was the production of the Jesuit’s college, and caused\r\ngreat jollity among the common people.\r\n\r\nThe wood was followed by a very tall man, dressed like an infant in a\r\nbody-coat, and walking in a go-cart, with a rattle in his hand.\r\n\r\nThis infant was followed by a man forty-five feet high, with a boy\r\nlooking out of his pocket, shaking a rattle and calling\r\nout.--“grandpapa! grandpapa!” He was clothed in blue and gold, which\r\nreached quite to the ground, and concealed a body of men who moved it\r\nand made it dance.\r\n\r\nAfter him followed a figure nearly of the same stature, mounted on a\r\nhorse of suitable size for the enormous rider, which made a most\r\nstriking and elegant appearance, both man and horse being executed in a\r\nmasterly manner. It was made in a moving posture, two of the feet being\r\nraised from the ground.\r\n\r\nThen followed a woman of equal stature, and not inferior in elegance to\r\nthose which preceded; she had a watch at her side as large as a\r\nwarming-pan, and her head and breast richly decorated with jewels; her\r\neyes and head turned very naturally; and as she moved along she\r\nfrequently danced, and not inelegantly.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” says its describer, “ended the _Cow-mass_, a show scarce\r\nexceeded by any in the known world.”[225]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Midsummer Wrestling._\r\n\r\nIn the church of Bradmore, Nottinghamshire, is a monument for sir Thomas\r\nParkyns, who is represented standing in a posture for wrestling, and in\r\nanother part he appears thrown by Time, with the following lines,\r\nwritten by Dr. Friend:--\r\n\r\n    “Quem modo stravisti longo in certamine, Tempus,\r\n    Hic recubat Britonum clarus in orbe pugil.\r\n    Jam primum stratus; præter te vicerat omnes;\r\n    De te etiam victor, quando resurget, erit.”\r\n\r\nWhich may be thus translated:--\r\n\r\n    Here lies, O Time! the victim of thy hand,\r\n    The noblest boxer on the British strand:\r\n    His nervous arm each bold opposer quell’d,\r\n    In feats of strength by none but thee excell’d:\r\n    Till, springing up, at the last trumpet’s call,\r\n    He conquers thee, who wilt have conquer’d all.\r\n\r\nThe inscription underneath takes notice of his wife’s fortune, and the\r\nestates he purchased; that he rebuilt his farm-houses, was skilled in\r\narchitecture and medicine, and that he wrote a book on wrestling, called\r\n“_The Cornish Hug Wrestler_.”\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was remarkable for his skill in that exercise; he trained\r\nmany of his servants and neighbours to it, and when those manly (though\r\nnow thought unpolished) diversions were in fashion, he exhibited his\r\npupils in public with no small _éclat_.\r\n\r\nBy his will he left a guinea to be wrestled for at Bradmore every\r\n_midsummer-day_, and money to the ringers, of whom he also made one. He\r\ndisplayed his learning in several curious inscriptions. Over a seat by\r\nthe road-side, _Hic sedeas, viator si tu defessus es ambulando_. The\r\nhonour of a visit from a judge on the circuit, was commemorated at the\r\nhorse-block by, _Hinc Justiciarius Dormer equum ascendere solebat_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n1340.

The\r\nEnglish took two hundred and thirty of the ships, and killed thirty\r\nthousand Frenchmen, and two of their admirals.

It is cut, bound up in sheaves, and\r\ncarried away immediately to the thrashing-floor, where it is stacked up.\r\nThe thrashing-floor, or _aire_, (to give it the name by which it is\r\ncalled in the country,) is out in the open field; it is of a circular\r\nform, and paved sometimes with stone, sometimes with a stiff clay beaten\r\ndown till it becomes nearly as hard as stone. In the parts near the\r\n_aire_, while one man cuts the corn and binds the sheaves, another takes\r\nthem upon his back, two or three at a time, and carries them away to the\r\n_aire_; when the distance is somewhat greater, the sheaves are loaded\r\nupon an ass or mule; and when the distance is considerable, then a cart\r\nis employed, provided the ground be not too steep to admit of it, which\r\nhappens not unfrequently. In no case is the corn left standing where it\r\nis cut, but carried away immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen all is in this manner collected at the _aire_, it is spread out\r\nthick upon it, and one or two horses or mules blindfolded, with a man\r\nstanding in the middle and holding the reins, are made to run round and\r\nround, till the corn is separated from the straw; after which the one is\r\nput into sacks and stored up in the granary, and the other put into a\r\nloft for winter food for the cattle. No such thing as a barn is to be\r\nseen, at least in the southern parts of Province.\r\n\r\nRain during harvest is so very unusual, that this whole process may be\r\ncarried on without fear of interruption from wet, or of the corn being\r\ninjured for want of shelter.\r\n\r\nThe scripture injunction, “not to muzzle the ox that treadeth out the\r\ncorn,” is explained by seeing this mode of thrashing. It is said both to\r\nbe a more expeditious and effectual process than the flail; but it\r\nappears very hard work to the animals, especially being performed under\r\nthe influence of such a burning sun. Our mode of thrashing is, perhaps,\r\nequally hard work to mankind.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of harvest, which is considered as lasting till the corn\r\nis all thrashed and laid up, the peasant makes the cornstack his bed: he\r\nsleeps upon it, attended by his dog, as a precaution against nocturnal\r\ndepredators; and the air and ground are both so dry, that he has nothing\r\nto apprehend from damps.[228]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of June, 1752, died cardinal Julius Alberoni. He was\r\nborn in 1664; his father, a gardener near Parma, who obtained for him a\r\nsmall post in the cathedral where he took priests orders, was enabled by\r\nthe fortune of war to serve Campistron, the French poet, who was\r\nsecretary to the duke of Vendome, and who introduced him to that\r\nwarrior, to whom Alberoni betrayed the granaries of his countrymen.\r\nVendome perceived his talent for political intrigue, and in reward of\r\nthis treason, appointed him to conduct a correspondence with the\r\nprincess d’Ursins who governed the affairs of Spain. In quality of agent\r\nto the duke of Parma, Alberoni was settled at the Spanish court, and\r\ncontrived to marry the princess to Philip V. The new queen gave him her\r\nconfidence, and obtained for him a cardinal’s hat; he was made a grandee\r\nof Spain, and became prime minister, in which capacity he endeavoured to\r\nexcite the Turks against the emperor, attempted the restoration of the\r\npretender to the throne of England, aimed at dispossessing the duke of\r\nOrleans from the regency of France, and securing it for Philip V., and\r\nby these and other ambitious endeavours, raised a host of enemies\r\nagainst Philip, who could only obtain peace with France and England on\r\ncondition of banishing Alberoni. He left Spain with immense property in\r\nhis possession, and with the will of Charles II. by which Philip derived\r\nhis title to the Spanish monarchy. The document was recovered from him\r\nby force, and the pope caused him to be arrested at Geneva for\r\nintriguing against the Turks. He went to Rome; the college of cardinals\r\ninquired into his conduct, and confined him for a year to the Jesuits’\r\ncollege, and Clement XII. appointed him legate to Romana, where, at the\r\nage of seventy, he plotted the destruction of the little republic of San\r\nMarino, and was ludicrously defeated when he imagined brilliant success.\r\nAlberoni was baffled in almost every scheme of national aggression. He\r\naccumulated great wealth, a universal reputation for political intrigue,\r\nand at the age of eighty-seven, died rich and infamous.[229]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASON.\r\n\r\n“Now” in this month, as in the month of July, and as, for example, in\r\nJune, 1826, “we occasionally have one of those sultry days which make\r\nthe house too hot to hold us, and force us to seek shelter in the open\r\nair, which is hotter;--when the interior of the blacksmith’s shop looks\r\nawful, and we expect the foaming porter pot to hiss, as the brawny\r\nforger dips his fiery nose into it;--when the birds sit open-mouthed\r\nupon the bushes; and the fishes fry in the shallow ponds; and the sheep\r\nand cattle congregate together in the shade, and forget to eat;--when\r\npedestrians along dusty roads quarrel with their coats and waistcoats,\r\nand cut sticks to carry them across their shoulders; and cottagers’s\r\nwives go about their work gown-less; and their daughters are anxious to\r\ndo the same, but that they have the fear of the vicar before their\r\neyes;--when every thing seen beyond a piece of parched soil quivers\r\nthrough the heated air; and when, finally, a snow-white swan, floating\r\nabove its own image, upon a piece of clear cool water into which a\r\nweeping-willow is dipping its green fingers, is a sight not to be turned\r\nfrom suddenly.”[230]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 60·15.\r\n\r\n  [228] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n  [229] General Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1.\r\n\r\n  [230] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 27.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fire in Lincoln’s Inn._\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of June, 1752, about one in the morning, a fire\r\nbroke out in Lincoln’s-inn new square, by which No. 10 and 11 were\r\nentirely consumed. The chambers of R. Wilbraham, the hon. Edward Harley,\r\nhon. Charles York, E. Hoskyns, -- Chomley, Edmund Sawyer, master in\r\nchancery, and -- Ansell, Esqs. all in No. 10, with the papers, books,\r\nplate, furniture, and wearing apparel were totally destroyed. In the\r\nnext staircase, No. 11, were Mr. John Sharpe, solicitor to the treasury,\r\nand Messrs. Edward Booth, Ambler, Fazakerly, Fellers, and Wilmot. The\r\nloss and difficulties in which many families were involved, the titles\r\nto whose properties were lodged with the above gentlemen, were not to be\r\ncomputed. Mr. Wilbraham had lately purchased an estate of great value,\r\nthe title-deeds of which, among other numberless deeds, mortgages, &c.\r\nwere burnt. His clerk, Mr. Pickering, lost above eleven hundred pounds\r\nin money and bank notes of his own and others, and securities for thirty\r\nthousand pounds more, also all the title-deeds of lord Leigh’s estate.\r\nWhen the fire was discovered most of the watch were asleep or drunk, and\r\nthe wife of an upholder in Carey-street, whose husband left his bed to\r\nassist the sufferers, hanged herself in his absence.[231]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1752, was living at Clee-hall, near Ludlow, in Salop, lady Wadeley at\r\nthe great age of 105.

A.R.S., keeper of the\r\nBritish Institution; greatly respected for his superior talents as a\r\nmezzotinto engraver, for the purity and universality of his taste in\r\nworks of art, for the general urbanity of his manners, and for that\r\ninvariable benignity of disposition, which, in popular language, is\r\nusually styled “goodness of heart.”\r\n\r\nMr. Green, besides his distinguished merit as an artist, acquired\r\nconsiderable reputation as an author, by publishing, in 1796, a valuable\r\nwork, entitled, “The History and Antiquities of the City and Suburbs of\r\nWorcester,” in two quarto volumes; a performance of great research and\r\nlabour.

Exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n~June 30.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON PORTER.\r\n\r\nAll the world knows that London is famous for porter; it is not of this\r\nporter we speak to-day, but of a personage who derives his quality from\r\nthe means by which he has attained the honour of doing credit to the\r\ncorporation. The individual alluded to, was publicly made known by a\r\npolice report of the thirtieth of June, 1826, viz.--\r\n\r\nMr. Alderman Wood came to the Mansion-house for the purpose of\r\ncontradicting a statement which appeared in the _Courier_ newspaper,\r\nthat he had persecuted a poor man, named Brown, and procured his\r\ndischarge, for sticking up bills against him (Alderman Wood). He thought\r\nit worth while not to let such a statement go unanswered; for he never\r\nexercised such an influence in the course of his life, and he never\r\nheard of such a man until the charge was made in the newspaper. He\r\nwished to know whether there really was such a man connected with the\r\nMansion-house establishment.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor said, he believed there was such a man, not belonging to\r\nthe Mansion-house, but to the Mansion-house porter. The fact was, that\r\ntheir porter, like the porter to the “Castle of Indolence,” had become\r\nso exceedingly fat, that he had employed a valet to do the only work\r\nwhich there was for him to do--namely, to sweep the gateway. This valet\r\nwas the aforesaid Brown, in whom the liberty of the subject, and the\r\nconstitution, was alleged to have been violated. How, or why, he had\r\nquitted the Mansion-house, the porter alone could tell.\r\n\r\nThe porter was then sent for, and he waddled into the justice-room. In\r\nanswer to his lordship’s inquiries, he stated that he had employed Brown\r\nat half-a-crown per week, to sweep the door and do other work for him.\r\n\r\nThe LORD MAYOR.--When did he absent himself from his duty?--The porter\r\nreplied, it was about three weeks ago.\r\n\r\nThe LORD MAYOR.--Did you discharge him from his office on constitutional\r\ngrounds, or for acting against Mr. Alderman Wood?\r\n\r\nThe PORTER.--Bless your worship, no: I can’t tell why he went off.\r\n\r\nAlderman Wood professed himself satisfied with this contradiction: he\r\nthought the affair unworthy of farther attention. He had been\r\nchallenged to prove his statement respecting the bills, and he had\r\nproved it.[234]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this description of the “initial” to the Mansion-house, he seemed\r\n“a fit and proper person” to be taken by a “limner,” and represented, by\r\nthe art of the engraver, to the readers of the _Every-Day Book_. An\r\nartist every way qualified was verbally instructed to view him; but\r\ninstead of transmitting his “faithful portrait,” he sent a letter, of\r\nwhich the following is a\r\n\r\nCOPY.\r\n\r\n_To Mr. Hone._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I went this morning to the Mansion-house and had an interview\r\nwith the porter, but _that_ porter was very different to what I expected\r\nto have found. Instead of a very fat lazy fellow, fatted by indolence, I\r\nfound a short active little man, about five feet high, not fat, nor\r\nlean, but _a comfortable size_, dressed in black, powdered hair, and top\r\nboots, pleasing and easy in his manners, and such a one that every one\r\nwould suppose would get an inferior person to do his dirty work. There\r\nis nothing extraordinary in him to be remarkable, therefore I made no\r\nsketch of him; but proceeded to Limehouse on a little business, and from\r\nthence home, and feel so excessively tired that I send this scrawl,\r\nhoping you will excuse me coming myself.\r\n\r\n  Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n  ---- ----\r\n\r\nBetween this gentleman’s “view of the _subject_,” and the preceding\r\n“report,” there is a palpable difference; where the mistake lies, it is\r\nnot in the power of the editor to determine. The letter-writer himself\r\nis “of a comfortable size,” and is almost liable to the suspicion of\r\nhaving seen the porter of the Mansion-house, from the opposite passage\r\nof the Mansion-house tavern, as through an inverted telescope. The lord\r\nmayor’s alleged comparison of the porter at his own gate, with the\r\nporter of the “Castle of Indolence,” may justify an extract of the\r\nstanzas wherein “_that_ porter,” and “his man,” are described.\r\n\r\n        Wak’d by the crowd, slow from his bench arose\r\n        A comely full spread porter, swoln with sleep:\r\n        His calm, broad, thoughtless aspect, breath’d repose\r\n        And in sweet torpour he was plunged deep,\r\n        Nor could himself from ceaseless yawning keep;\r\n        While o’er his eyes the drowsy liquor ran,\r\n        Thro’ which his half-wak’d soul would faintly peep--\r\n        Then taking his black staff, he call’d his man,\r\n      And rous’d himself as much as rouse himself he can.\r\n\r\n        The lad leap’d lightly at his master’s call:\r\n        He was, to weet, a little rogueish page,\r\n        Save sleep and play who minded naught at all,\r\n        Like most the untaught striplings of the age.\r\n        This boy he kept each band to disengage,\r\n        Garters and buckles, task for him unfit,\r\n        But ill becoming his grave personage,\r\n        And which his portly paunch would not permit,\r\n    So this same limber page to all performed it.\r\n\r\n        Meantime the master-porter wide display’d\r\n        Great store of caps, of slippers, and of gowns;\r\n        Wherewith he those that enter’d in array’d.\r\n        Loose, as the breeze that plays along the downs,\r\n        And waves the summer-woods when evening frowns,\r\n        O fair undress, best dress! it checks no vein,\r\n        But every flowing limb in pleasure drowns,\r\n        And heightens ease with grace, this done, right fain\r\n    Sir porter sat him down, and turned to sleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·40.\r\n\r\n  [234] The Times, July 1, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our saxon fathers did full rightly call\r\n    This month of July “Hay-monath,” when all\r\n    The verdure of the full clothed fields we mow,\r\n    And turn, and rake, and carry off; and so\r\n    We build it up, in large and solid mows.\r\n    If it be good, as every body knows,\r\n    To “make hay while the sun shines,” we should choose\r\n    Right “times for all things,” and no time abuse.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nIn July we have full summer. The “Mirror of the Months” presents its\r\nvarious influences on the open face of nature. “The rye is yellow, and\r\nalmost ripe for the sickle. The wheat and barley are of a dull green,\r\nfrom their swelling ears being alone visible, as they bow before every\r\nbreeze that blows over them. The oats are whitening apace, and quiver,\r\neach individual grain on its light stem, as they hang like rain-drops in\r\nthe air. Looked on separately, and at a distance, these three now wear a\r\nsomewhat dull and monotonous hue, when growing in great spaces; but\r\nthese will be intersected, in all directions, by patches of the\r\nbrilliant emerald which now begins to spring afresh on the late-mown\r\nmeadows; by the golden yellow of the rye, in some cases cut, and\r\nstanding in sheaves; by the rich dark green of the turnip-fields; and\r\nstill more brilliantly by sweeps, here and there, of the bright yellow\r\ncharlock, the scarlet corn-poppy, and the blue succory, which, like\r\nperverse beauties, scatter the stray gifts of their charms in proportion\r\nas the soil cannot afford to support the expenses attendant on them.”\r\n\r\nOn the high downs, “all the little molehills are purple with the flowers\r\nof the wild thyme, which exhales its rich aromatic odour as you press it\r\nwith your feet; and among it the elegant blue heath-bell is nodding its\r\nhalf-dependent head from its almost invisible stem,--its perpetual\r\nmotion, at the slightest breath of air, giving it the look of a living\r\nthing hovering on invisible wings just above the ground. Every here and\r\nthere, too, we meet with little patches of dark green heaths, hung all\r\nover with their clusters of exquisitely wrought filigree flowers,\r\nendless in the variety of their forms, but all of the most curiously\r\ndelicate fabric, and all, in their minute beauty, unparalleled by the\r\nproudest occupiers of the parterre. This is the singular family of\r\nplants that, when cultivated in pots, and trained to form heads on\r\nseparate stems, give one the idea of the forest trees of a Lilliputian\r\npeople.” Here, too, are the “innumerable little thread-like spikes that\r\nnow rise from out the level turf, with scarcely perceptible seed-heads\r\nat top, and keep the otherwise dead flat perpetually alive, by bending\r\nand twinkling beneath the sun and breeze.”\r\n\r\nIn the green lanes “we shall find the ground beneath our feet, the\r\nhedges that enclose us on either side, and the dry banks and damp\r\nditches beneath them, clothed in a beautiful variety of flowers that we\r\nhave not yet had an opportunity of noticing. In the hedge-rows (which\r\nare now grown into impervious walls of many-coloured and many-shaped\r\nleaves, from the fine filigree-work of the white-thorn, to the large,\r\ncoarse, round leaves of the hazel) we shall find the most remarkable of\r\nthese, winding up intricately among the crowded branches, and shooting\r\nout their flowers here and there, among other leaves than their own, or\r\nhanging themselves into festoons and fringes on the outside, by unseen\r\ntendrils. Most conspicuous among the first of these is the great\r\nbind-weed, thrusting out its elegantly-formed snow-white flowers, but\r\ncarefully concealing its leaves and stem in the thick of the shrubs\r\nwhich yield it support. Nearer to the ground, and more exposed, we shall\r\nmeet with a handsome relative of the above, the common red and white\r\nwild convolvolus; while all along the face of the hedge, clinging to it\r\nlightly, the various coloured vetches, and the enchanter’s night-shade,\r\nhang their flowers into the open air; the first exquisitely fashioned,\r\nwith wings like the pea, only smaller; and the other elaborate in its\r\nconstruction and even beautiful, with its rich purple petals turned back\r\nto expose a centre of deep yellow; but still, with all its beauty, not\r\nwithout a strange and sinister look, which at once points it out as a\r\npoison-flower. It is this which afterwards turns to those bunches of\r\nscarlet berries which hang so temptingly in autumn, just within the\r\nreach of little children, and which it requires all the eloquence of\r\ntheir grandmothers to prevent them from tasting. In the midst of these,\r\nand above them all, the woodbine now hangs out its flowers more\r\nprofusely than ever, and rivals in sweetness all the other field scents\r\nof this month.\r\n\r\n“On the bank from which the hedgerow rises, and on _this_ side of the\r\nnow nearly dry water-channel beneath, fringing the border of the green\r\npath on which we are walking, a most rich variety of field-flowers will\r\nalso now be found. We dare not stay to notice the half of them, because\r\ntheir beauties, though even more exquisite than those hitherto\r\ndescribed, are of that unobtrusive nature that you must stoop to pick\r\nthem up, and must come to an actual commune with them, before they can\r\nbe even seen distinctly; which is more than our desultory and fugitive\r\ngaze will permit,--the plan of our walk only allowing us to pay the\r\npassing homage of a word to those objects that _will_ not be overlooked.\r\nMany of the exquisite little flowers, now alluded to generally, look,\r\nas they lie among their low leaves, only like minute morsels of\r\nmany-coloured glass scattered upon the green ground--scarlet, and\r\nsapphire, and rose, and purple, and white, and azure, and golden. But\r\npick them up, and bring them towards the eye, and you will find them\r\npencilled with a thousand dainty devices, and elaborated into the most\r\nexquisite forms and fancies, fit to be strung into necklaces for fairy\r\nTitania, or set in broaches and bracelets for the neatest-handed of her\r\nnymphs.\r\n\r\n“But there are many others that come into bloom this month, some of\r\nwhich we cannot pass unnoticed if we would. Conspicuous among them are\r\nthe centaury, with its elegant cluster of small, pink, star-like\r\nflowers; the ladies’ bedstraw, with its rich yellow tufts; the\r\nmeadow-sweet--sweetest of all the sweetners of the meadows; the wood\r\nbetony, lifting up its handsome head of rose-coloured blossoms; and,\r\nstill in full perfection, and towering up from among the low groundlings\r\nthat usually surround it, the stately fox-glove.\r\n\r\n“Among the other plants that now become conspicuous, the wild teasal\r\nmust not be forgotten, if it be only on account of the use that one of\r\nthe summer’s prettiest denizens sometimes makes of it. The wild teasal\r\n(which now puts on as much the appearance of a flower as its rugged\r\nnature will let it) is that species of thistle which shoots up a strong\r\nserrated stem, straight as an arrow, and beset on all sides by hard\r\nsharp-pointed thorns, and bearing on its summit a hollow egg-shaped\r\nhead, also covered at all points with the same armour of threatening\r\nthorns--as hard, as thickly set, and as sharp as a porcupine’s quills.\r\nOften within this fortress, impregnable to birds, bees, and even to\r\nmischievous boys themselves, that beautiful moth which flutters about so\r\ngaily during the first weeks of summer, on snow-white wings spotted all\r\nover with black and yellow, takes up its final abode,--retiring thither\r\nwhen weary of its desultory wanderings, and after having prepared for\r\nthe perpetuation of its ephemeral race, sleeping itself to death, to the\r\nrocking lullaby of the breeze.\r\n\r\n“Now, too, if we pass near some gently lapsing water, we may chance to\r\nmeet with the splendid flowers of the great water lily, floating on the\r\nsurface of the stream like some fairy vessel at anchor, and making\r\nvisible, as it ripples by it, the elsewhere imperceptible current.\r\nNothing can be more elegant than each of the three different states\r\nunder which this flower now appears; the first, while it lies unopened\r\namong its undulating leaves, like the halcyon’s egg within its floating\r\nnest; next, when its snowy petals are but half expanded, and you are\r\nalmost tempted to wonder what beautiful bird it is that has just taken\r\nits flight from such a sweet birth-place; and lastly, when the whole\r\nflower floats confessed, and spreading wide upon the water its pointed\r\npetals, offers its whole heart to the enamoured sun. There is I know not\r\nwhat of awful in the beauty of this flower. It is, to all other flowers,\r\nwhat Mrs. Siddons is to all other women.”[235]\r\n\r\n  [235] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 1.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKLETOP.\r\n\r\n_Munden._--_Farren._\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1826.--Mr. Farren appeared in the part of _Old Cockletop_, in\r\nO’Keefe’s farce of _Modern Antiques_, at the Haymarket theatre. This\r\nwill be recollected as a crack character of Munden’s; and it was one\r\nwhich he had hit so happily, that it became almost impossible for any\r\nother actor to play it very successfully after him. There was a sort of\r\nelfin antic--a kind of immateriality about the crotchets of Munden in\r\n_Cockletop_. His brain seemed to have no more substance in it than the\r\nweb of a spider; and he looked dried up in body and mind, almost to a\r\ntransparency; he might have stood in a window and not been in the\r\nway--you could see the light through him. Farren is the bitterest old\r\nrascal on the stage. He looks, and moves always, as if he had a blister\r\n(that wanted fresh dressing) behind each ear; but he does not touch the\r\nentirely withered, crazy-brained, semi-bedlamite old rogue, in the way\r\nthat Munden did. Munden contrived to give all the weakness possible to\r\nextreme age in _Cockletop_, without exciting an iota of compassion. All\r\nthat there was of him was dry bones and wickedness. You could not help\r\nseeing that he would be particularly comical under the torture; and you\r\ncould not feel the slightest compunction in ordering that he should\r\nundergo it. There never was any thing like his walking up and down\r\nDrury-lane stage in astonishment, and concluding he must be “at next\r\ndoor,” when he returns home from his journey, and finds all his servants\r\nin mourning! And the cloak that he wore too! And the appendage that he\r\ncalled his “stormcap!” He looked like a large ape’s skin stuffed with\r\nhay, ready to hang up in an apothecary’s shop! You ran over all the old\r\nfools that you knew, one after the other, to recollect somebody like\r\nhim, but could not succeed! Farren plays _Foresight_ as well as Munden;\r\nand he plays _Cockletop_ very successfully; but it is hardly possible\r\nfor one eminent actor to follow another in _trifling_ characters, where\r\nthe first has made a hit rather by his own inventions than by any thing\r\nwhich the author has set down for him. Munden’s dancing in the\r\nghost-scene with the servants, and his conclusion--striking an attitude,\r\nwith the fingers of one hand open like a bunch of radish, as the\r\nfiddler, used to keep the audience in convulsions for two minutes.\r\nFarren avoided this trick, probably lest he should be charged with\r\nimitation; but acknowledged talent like his may use a latitude: he has\r\noriginality enough to warrant his at least not avoiding the device which\r\nhas been used by any actor, purely because it has been used by somebody\r\nelse before him. Some passages that he gave were quite as good as\r\nMunden. In the scene where he fancies himself taken ill, the pit was in\r\ntwo minds to get up and cheer. He made a face like a bear troubled\r\nsuddenly with symptoms of internal commotion! one who had eaten a\r\nbee-hive for the sake of the honey, and began to have inward misgivings\r\nthat there must have been bees mixed up along with it. And Farren\r\npossesses the gift too--a most valuable one in playing to an English\r\naudience--of exhibiting the suffering without exciting the smallest\r\nsympathy! Whenever there is any thing the matter with him, you hope\r\nhe’ll get worse with all your soul; and, if he were drowning--with\r\n_that_ face!--he must die:--you could not, if you were to die yourself,\r\ntake one step, for laughing, to save him.[236]\r\n\r\n_July._\r\n\r\n    The sun comes on apace, and thro’ the signs\r\n      Travels unwearied; as he hotter grows,\r\n    Above, the herbage, and beneath, the mines,\r\n      Own his warm influence, while his axle glows;\r\n    The flaming lion meets him on the way,\r\n    Proud to receive the flaming god of day.\r\n\r\n    In fullest bloom the damask rose is seen,\r\n      Carnations boast their variegated die,\r\n    The fields of corn display a vivid green,\r\n      And cherries with the crimson orient vie,\r\n    The hop in blossom climbs the lofty pole,\r\n    Nor dreads the lightning, tho’ the thunders roll.\r\n\r\n    The wealth of Flora like the rainbow shows,\r\n      Blending her various hues of light and shade,\r\n    How many tints would emulate the rose,\r\n      Or imitate the lily’s bright parade!\r\n    The flowers of topaz and of sapphire vie\r\n    With all the richest tinctures of the sky.\r\n\r\n    The vegetable world is all alive,\r\n      Green grows the gooseberry on its bush of thorn,\r\n    The infant bees now swarm around the hive,\r\n      And the sweet bean perfumes the lap of morn,\r\n    Millions of embryos take the wing to fly,\r\n    The young inherit, and the old ones die.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis summer all--convey me to the bower,\r\n      The bower of myrtle form’d by Myra’s skill,\r\n    There let me waste away the noontide hour,\r\n      Fann’d by the breezes from yon cooling rill,\r\n    By Myra’s side reclin’d, the burning ray\r\n    Shall be as grateful as the cool of day.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·07.\r\n\r\n  [236] The Times, July 3, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 2.~\r\n\r\n\r\n_Will Wimble._\r\n\r\nOn the second of July, 1741, died at Dublin, Mr. Thomas Morecroft, “a\r\nbaronet’s younger son, the person mentioned by the ‘Spectator’ in the\r\ncharacter of _Will Wimble_.”\r\n\r\nThis notice is from the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for 1741, as also is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nOn the same day, in the same year, the earl of Halifax married Miss\r\nDunck, with a fortune of one hundred thousand pounds.

It was observed of Mrs. Wainwright,\r\nwho was then eighty-nine years of age, that she could properly say,\r\n“Rise, daughter, go to thy daughter; for thy daughter’s daughter has a\r\nson.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wainwright was sister to Dr. Ashton and his brother mentioned\r\nabove, whose father and mother were twice married, “first before a\r\njustice of peace by Cromwell’s law, and afterwards, as it was common, by\r\na parson; they lived sixty-four years together, and during the first\r\nfifty years in one house, at Bradway, in Derbyshire, where, though they\r\nhad twelve children and six servants in family, they never buried\r\none.”[237]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·12.\r\n\r\n  [237] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 3.~\r\n\r\nDog days begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n“ALL--FOR A PENNY!”\r\n\r\nOn the third of July, 1751, William Dellicot was convicted at the\r\nquarter-sessions for Salisbury, of petty larceny, for stealing one\r\npenny; whereby his effects, consisting of bank-notes to the amount of\r\n180_l._, and twenty guineas in money, were forfeited to the bishop, as\r\nlord of the manor; but his lordship humanely ordered 100_l._ of the\r\nmoney to be put to interest for the benefit of the wretch’s daughter;\r\n20_l._ to be given to his aged father, and the remainder to be returned\r\nto the delinquent himself.[238]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGENT’S PARK.\r\n\r\nA correspondent’s muse records an accommodation, which may be extended\r\nto other resorts, with the certainty of producing much satisfaction in\r\nwearied pedestrians.\r\n\r\nCONGRATULATORY VERSES TO THE NEW SEATS IN THE REGENT’S-PARK, 1826\r\n_versus_ CHAIRS.\r\n\r\n    I covet not the funeral chair\r\n      Th’ Orlean maid was burnt in, when\r\n    Enthusiasts’ voices rent the air\r\n      To clasp their Joan of Arc again.\r\n\r\n    I, learned Busby’s chair, chuse not,[239]\r\n      Nor of a boat in stormy seas,\r\n    Nor on a bridge--the stony lot\r\n      Of travellers not afraid to freeze.\r\n\r\n    I covet not the chair of state,\r\n      Nor that St. Peter’s papal race\r\n    Exalted for Pope Joan the great,\r\n      But seek and find an easier place.\r\n\r\n    To halls and abbeys knights repaired,\r\n      And barons to their chairs retired;\r\n    The goblet, glove, and shield, were reared,\r\n      As war and love their cause inspired.\r\n\r\n    Saint Edward’s chair the minster keeps,\r\n      An antique chair the dutchess bears;[240]\r\n    The invalid--he hardly sleeps,\r\n      Though poled through Bath in easy chairs.[241]\r\n\r\n    The chairs St. James’s-park contains,\r\n      The chairs at Kew and Kensington,\r\n    Have rested weary hearts and brains\r\n      That charmed the town, now still and gone.\r\n\r\n    I covet not the chair of guilt\r\n      Macbeth upbraided for its ghost;\r\n    Nor Gay’s, on which much ink was spilt,\r\n      When he wrote fables for his host.\r\n\r\n    What of Dan Lambert’s?--Oberon’s chair?\r\n      Bunyan’s at Bedford?--Johnson’s seat?\r\n    Chaucer’s at Woodstock?--Bloomfield’s bare?\r\n      Waxed, lasting, ended, and complete.[242]\r\n\r\n    Though without back, and sides, and arms,\r\n      Thou, REGENT’S SEAT! art doubly dear!\r\n    Nature appears in youthful charms\r\n      For all that muse and travel here.\r\n\r\n    Canal, church, spire, and Primrose hill,\r\n      With fowl and beast and chary sound,\r\n    Invite the thought to peace, for still\r\n      Thou, like a friend, art faithful found.\r\n\r\n    A seat, then, patience seems to teach,\r\n      Untired the weary limbs it bears;\r\n    To all that can its comforts reach,\r\n      It succours through the round of years.\r\n\r\n    Whatever hand, or name, is writ\r\n      In pencil on thy painted face;\r\n    Let not one word of ribald wit\r\n      Produce a blush, or man disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n“BUSBY’S CHAIR.”\r\n\r\nTalking of this--a word or two on “_Sedes Busbeiana_.”\r\n\r\nThe humorous representation of “Dr. Busby’s chair,” (on p. 34 of this\r\nvolume,) personifying the several parts of grammar, as well as some of a\r\nschoolmaster’s _more serious_ occupation, said to have been from an\r\noriginal by sir Peter Lely, is ascertained by the editor to have been a\r\nmere _bagatelle_ performance of a young man some five-and-twenty years\r\nago.

Prejudice against this most useful class of\r\npersons is strong, and it is only fair to record an instance of\r\nintegrity which, after all, is as general, perhaps, among hackneymen, as\r\namong those who ride in their coaches.\r\n\r\n  HONESTY REWARDED.--A circumstance took place on Tuesday, (July 4,\r\n  1826,) which cannot be made too generally known among\r\n  hackney-coachmen, and persons who use those vehicles.\r\n\r\nA gentleman took a coach in St. Paul’s churchyard, about twenty minutes\r\nbefore twelve, and was set down in Westminster exactly at noon. Having\r\ntransacted his business there, he was proceeding homeward a little\r\nbefore one, when he suddenly missed a bank note for three hundred\r\npounds, which he had in his pocket on entering the coach. He had not\r\nobserved either the number or date of the note, or the number of the\r\ncoach. He therefore returned to the bankers in the city, and ascertained\r\nthe number and date of the note, then proceeded to the bank of England,\r\nfound that it had not been paid, and took measures to stop its payment,\r\nif presented. After some further inquiry, he applied about half-past\r\nthree, at the hackney-coach office, in Essex-street, in the Strand, and\r\nthere to his agreeable surprise, he found that the coachman had already\r\nbrought the note to the commissioners, at whose suggestion the gentleman\r\npaid the coachman a reward of fifty pounds. The name of the honest\r\ncoachman should be known: it is John Newell, the owner and driver of the\r\ncoach No. 314, and residing in Marylebone-lane.\r\n\r\nIt should also be known, that persons leaving property in\r\nhackney-coaches, may very generally recover it by applying without delay\r\nat the office in Essex-street. Since the act of parliament requiring\r\nhackney-coachmen to bring such articles to the office came into effect,\r\nwhich is not four years and a half ago, no less than one thousand and\r\nfifty-eight articles have been so brought, being of the aggregate value\r\nof forty-five thousand pounds, and upwards.[243]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDescend we from the coach, and, leaving the town, take a turn with a\r\nrespected friend whither he would lead us.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD PATHS.\r\n\r\n(_For the Every-Day Book._)\r\n\r\nI love our real old English footpaths. I love those rustic and\r\npicturesque stiles, opening their pleasant escapes from frequented\r\nplaces, and dusty highways, into the solitudes of nature. It is\r\ndelightful to catch a glimpse of one on the village green, under the old\r\nelder-tree by some ancient cottage, or half hidden by the overhanging\r\nboughs of a wood. I love to see the smooth dry track, winding away in\r\neasy curves, along some green slope, to the churchyard, to the embosomed\r\ncottage, or to the forest grange. It is to me an object of certain\r\ninspiration. It seems to invite one from noise and publicity, into the\r\nheart of solitude and of rural delights. It beckons the imagination on,\r\nthrough green and whispering corn fields, through the short but verdant\r\npasture; the flowery mowing-grass; the odorous and sunny hayfield; the\r\nfestivity of harvest; from lovely farm to farm; from village to village;\r\nby clear and mossy wells; by tinkling brooks, and deep wood-skirted\r\nstreams; to crofts, where the daffodil is rejoicing in spring, or\r\nmeadows, where the large, blue geraneum embellishes the summer wayside;\r\nto heaths, with their warm, elastic sward and crimson bells, the\r\nchithering of grasshoppers, the foxglove, and the old gnarled oak; in\r\nshort, to all the solitary haunts, after which the city-pent lover of\r\nnature pants, as “the hart panteth after the water-brooks.” What is\r\nthere so truly English? What is so linked with our rural tastes, our\r\nsweetest memories, and our sweetest poetry, as stiles and fieldpaths?\r\nGoldsmith, Thomson, and Milton have adorned them with some of their\r\nrichest wreaths. They have consecrated them to poetry and love. It is\r\nalong the footpath in secluded fields,--upon the stile in the embowered\r\nlane,--where the wild-rose and the honey-suckle are lavishing their\r\nbeauty and their fragrance, that we delight to picture to ourselves\r\nrural lovers, breathing in the dewy sweetness of a summer evening vows\r\nstill sweeter. It is there, that the poet seated, sends back his soul\r\ninto the freshness of his youth, amongst attachments since withered by\r\nneglect, rendered painful by absence, or broken by death; amongst dreams\r\nand aspirations which, even now that they pronounce their own fallacy,\r\nare lovely. It is there that he gazes upon the gorgeous sunset,--the\r\nevening star following with silvery lamp the fading day, or the moon\r\nshowering her pale lustre through the balmy night air, with a fancy that\r\nkindles and soars into the heavens before him,--there, that we have all\r\nfelt the charm of woods and green fields, and solitary boughs waving in\r\nthe golden sunshine, or darkening in the melancholy beauty of evening\r\nshadows. Who has not thought how beautiful was the sight of a village\r\ncongregation pouring out from their old grey church on a summer day, and\r\nstreaming off through the quiet meadows, in all directions, to their\r\nhomes? Or who, that has visited Alpine scenery, has not beheld with a\r\npoetic feeling, the mountaineers come winding down out of their romantic\r\nseclusions on a sabbath morning, pacing the solitary heath-tracks,\r\nbounding with elastic step down the fern-clad dells, or along the course\r\nof a riotous stream, as cheerful, as picturesque, and yet as solemn as\r\nthe scenes around them?\r\n\r\nAgain I say, I love fieldpaths, and stiles of all species,--ay, even the\r\nmost inaccessible piece of rustic erection ever set up in defiance of\r\nage, laziness, and obesity. How many scenes of frolic and merry\r\nconfusion have I seen at a clumsy stile! What exclamations, and charming\r\nblushes, and fine eventual vaulting on the part of the ladies, and what\r\nan opportunity does it afford to beaux of exhibiting a variety of\r\ngallant and delicate attentions. I consider a rude stile as any thing\r\nbut an impediment in the course of a rural courtship.\r\n\r\nThose good old _turn-stiles_ too,--can I ever forget them? the hours I\r\nhave spun round upon them, when a boy; or those in which I have almost\r\nlaughed myself to death at the remembrance of my village pedagogue’s\r\ndisaster! Methinks I see him now. The time a sultry day;--the domine a\r\ngoodly person of some eighteen or twenty stone;--the scene a footpath\r\nsentinelled with turn-stiles, one of which held him fast, as in utter\r\namazement at his bulk. Never shall I forget his efforts and agonies to\r\nextricate himself, nor his lion-like roars, which brought some labourers\r\nto his assistance, who, when they had recovered from their convulsions\r\nof laughter, knocked off the top, and let him go. It is long since I saw\r\na turnstile, and I suspect the Falstaffs have cried them down. But,\r\nwithout a jest, stiles and fieldpaths are vanishing every where. There\r\nis nothing upon which the advance of wealth and population has made so\r\nserious an inroad. As land has increased in value, wastes and heaths\r\nhave been parcelled out and enclosed, but seldom have footpaths been\r\nleft. The poet and the naturalist, who before had, perhaps, the greatest\r\n_real_ property in them, have had no allotment. They have been totally\r\ndriven out of the promised land. Nor is this all. Goldsmith complained,\r\nin his day, that--\r\n\r\n              “The man of wealth and pride\r\n    Takes up a space that many poor supplied;\r\n    Space for his lake, his park’s extended bounds,\r\n    Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;\r\n    The robe, that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,\r\n    Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;\r\n    His seat, where solitary sports are seen,\r\n    Indignant spurns the cottage from the green.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is but too true that “the pressure of contiguous pride” has\r\ndriven farther and farther, from that day to this, the public from the\r\nrich man’s lands. “They make a solitude and call it peace.” Even the\r\nquiet and picturesque footpath that led across his lawn, or stole along\r\nhis wood-side, giving to the poor man, with his burden, a cooler and a\r\nnearer cut to the village, is become a nuisance. One would have thought\r\nthat the rustic labourer with his scythe on his shoulder, or his\r\nbill-hook and hedging mittens in his hand, the cottage dame in her black\r\nbonnet and scarlet cloak, the bonny village maiden in the sweetness of\r\nhealth and simplicity, or the boy strolling along full of life and\r\ncuriosity, might have had sufficient interest, in themselves, for a\r\ncultivated taste, passing occasionally at a distance across the park or\r\nlawn not only to be tolerated, but even to be welcomed as objects\r\nagreeably enlivening the stately solitude of the hall. But they have\r\nnot. And what is more, _they_ are commonly the most jealous of\r\npedestrian trespassers who seldom visit their own estates, but permit\r\nthe seasons to scatter their charms around their villas and rural\r\npossessions without the heart to enjoy, or even the presence to behold\r\nthem. How often have I myself been arrested in some long-frequented\r\ndale, in some spot endeared by its own beauties and the fascinations of\r\nmemory, by a board, exhibiting, in giant characters, _Stopped by an\r\norder of Sessions!_ and denouncing the terms of the law upon\r\ntrespassers. This is a little too much. I would not be querulous for the\r\npoor against the rich. I would not teach them to look with an envious\r\nand covetous eye upon their villas, lawns, cattle, and equipage; but\r\nwhen the path of immemorial usage is closed, when the little streak,\r\nalmost as fine as a mathematical line, along the wealthy man’s ample\r\nfield, is grudgingly erased, it is impossible not to feel indignation at\r\nthe pitiful monopoly. Is there no village champion to be found bold\r\nenough to put in his protest against these encroachments, to assert this\r\npublic right--for a right it is, as authentic as that by which the land\r\nitself is held, and as clearly acknowledged by the laws? Is there no\r\nlocal “Hampden with dauntless breast” to “withstand the little tyrant of\r\nthe fields,” and to save our good old fieldpaths? If not, we shall, in a\r\nfew years, be doomed to the highways and the hedges: to look, like\r\nDives, from a sultry region of turnpikes, into a pleasant one of verdure\r\nand foliage which we may not approach. Already the stranger, if he lose\r\nhis way, is in jeopardy of falling into the horrid fangs of a\r\nsteel-trap; the botanist enters a wood to gather a flower, and is shot\r\nwith a spring-gun; death haunts our dells and copses, and the poet\r\ncomplains, in regretful notes, that he--\r\n\r\n    “Wanders away to field and glen\r\n    Far as he may for the gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nI am not so much of a poet, and so little of a political economist, as\r\nto lament over the progress of population. It is true that I see, with a\r\n_poetical_ regret, green fields and beautiful fresh tracts swallowed up\r\nin cities; but my joy in the increase of human life and happiness far\r\noutbalances that imaginative pain. But it is when I see _unnecessary\r\nand arbitrary_ encroachments upon the _rural_ privileges of the public\r\nthat I grieve. Exactly in the same proportion as our population and\r\ncommercial habits gain upon us, do we need all possible opportunities to\r\nkeep alive in us the spirit of nature.\r\n\r\n    “The world is too much with us, late and soon\r\n    Getting and spending; we lay waste our powers,\r\n    Little there is in nature that is ours.”\r\n\r\n  _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\nWe give ourselves up to the artificial habits and objects of ambition,\r\ntill we endanger the higher and better feelings and capacities of our\r\nbeing; and it is alone to the united influence of religion, literature,\r\nand nature, that we must look for the preservation of our moral\r\nnobility. Whenever, therefore, I behold one of our old fieldpaths\r\nclosed, I regard it as another link in the chain which Mammon is winding\r\naround us,--another avenue cut off by which we might fly to the lofty\r\nsanctuary of nature for power to withstand him.\r\n\r\n  H.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLS AND BELL RINGING AT BURY ST. EDMUND’S.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Lambeth, July 13, 1826._\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,--To your late interesting notices of “Bells” and\r\n“Bell-ringing,” the following singular letter, which appears in a\r\nSuffolk paper, may be added. I happen to know something of this\r\n“jangling;” and when I resided in the town of Bury St. Edmund’s some\r\nyears back, was compelled to listen to “the most hideous noise” of St.\r\nJames’s lofty opponents. But “who shall decide when doctors\r\ndisagree?”--Why, Mr. Editor,--_we_ will. It is a hardship, a cruelty, a\r\nusurpation, a “tale of woe.” Listen to St. James’s statement, and then\r\nlet us raise our bells, and ring a “righte sounde and merie” peal, such\r\nas will almost “split the ears of the groundlings.”--\r\n\r\n  “_To the Editor of the Bury Post._\r\n\r\n“Sir,--Since we have been repeatedly asked why St. James’s ringers lost\r\nthe privilege of ringing in St. Mary’s steeple, as far as it lies in our\r\npower we will answer it. Ever since the year 1714, up to the period of\r\n1813, the ringing in this town was conducted by one company only, who\r\nhad the liberty of ringing at both steeples; and in St. Mary’s steeple\r\nthere are recorded two peals rung by the Bury company, one of which was\r\nrung in 1779, and the other in 1799. In 1813, the bells of St. Mary’s\r\nwanting some repairs, the ringers applied to the churchwardens, and they\r\nhaving declined doing any thing to them, the ringers ceased from ringing\r\naltogether until the bells were repaired. At length an offer was made to\r\nthe churchwardens to raise a _young_ company, which offer was accepted\r\nby them, and the bells were partially repaired. In consequence of which\r\na company was raised, and a part of it consisted of old men who were\r\nincapable of learning to ring; youth being the only time when such an\r\nart can be acquired. It was agreed that when this company could ring one\r\ncourse of eight (or 112 changes), that each one should receive one\r\npound, which they have never asked for, well knowing they were never\r\nentitled to it; at the same time, it appears evident that the parish\r\nconsented they should learn to ring. In 1817, only two years and a half\r\nafter the company was raised, three bells were obliged to be rehung, at\r\nnearly twenty pounds’ expense. Taking an account of the annual repairs\r\nof the bells, and the repairs in 1814, the three years of sixteen-change\r\nringers cost the parish nearly thirty pounds, which would have rehung\r\nthe whole peal, being a deal more than what the old ringers would have\r\ncaused them to be repaired for in 1814. We, the present company of St.\r\nJames’s ringers, are well aware that St. Mary’s company had the offer to\r\nlearn to ring in September, 1814, which we made no opposition to; and if\r\nSt. Mary’s had learnt, we would have gladly taken them by the hand as\r\nbrother ringers; but after twelve years’ arduous struggle in\r\nendeavouring to learn to ring, they are no forwarder than the first week\r\nthey began. They could only then ring (no more than they can now)\r\nsixteen changes, and that very imperfectly, being but a very small part\r\nof the whole revolution of changes on eight bells, which consist of\r\n40,320. We, St. James’s ringers, or ‘old ringers,’ as we have been\r\ncommonly called, often get blamed for the _most hideous noise_ made in\r\nSt. Mary’s steeple; and after the jangling of the bells, miscalled\r\nringing, which they afforded the other evening, we indulge in the hope\r\nthat our future use of the steeple will be generally allowed.\r\n\r\n  “We are, Sir, most gratefully,\r\n\r\n  “Your humble servants,\r\n\r\n  “ST. JAMES’S RINGERS.”\r\n\r\nAh! much respected “St. James’s company,” do “indulge the hope” of\r\nmaking St. Mary’s bells speak eloquently again. If my pen can avail, you\r\nshall soon pull “Old Tom’s” tail in that steeple; and all his sons,\r\ndaughters, and kindred around him, shall lift up their voices in\r\nwell-tuned chorus, and sing “hallelujahs” of returning joy. “Those\r\nevening bells, those evening bells,” which used to frighten all the dogs\r\nand old women in the parish, and which used to make me wish were\r\nsuspended round the ringers’ necks, shall utter sweet music and respond\r\ndelightedly to lovers’ vows and tales whispered in shady lanes and\r\ngroves, in the vicinity of your beautiful town. You, worthy old bellmen,\r\nwho have discoursed so rapidly on the marriages of my father, and uncle,\r\nand cousin, and friend, and acquaintance, who would have (for a guinea!)\r\npaid the same compliment to myself, (although I was wedded in a distant\r\nland, and like a hero of romance and true knight-errant, claimed my fair\r\nbride, without consulting “father or mother, sister or brother,”) and\r\nmade yourselves as merry _at my expense_, as my pleasantest friends or\r\nbitterest enemies could have wished, had I hinted such a thing!\r\n\r\nOh! respectable churchwardens--discharge the “_young_ company,” who\r\nchant unfeelingly and unprofitably. Remember the “old ringers!”\r\n\r\n    “Pity the sorrows of the poor old men.”\r\n\r\nRespect talent--consider their virtues--patronise that art which “can\r\nonly be attained when young”--and which the “_young_ company” _cannot_\r\nattain--(does this mean they are stupid?)--and console the “old\r\nringers,” and let them pull on until they are pulled into their graves!\r\nThink how they have _moved_ the venerable tower of old St. James’s with\r\ntheir music[244]--nay, until the very bricks and stones above, wished to\r\nbecome more intimately acquainted with them! Do not let a stigma be\r\ncast upon them--for, should the good town’s-people imagine the “most\r\nhideous noise” was caused by the “old ringers,” their characters are\r\ngone for ever--they dare not even look at you through a sheet of paper!\r\nHow “many a time and oft” have they fired their _feux de joie_ on the\r\nking’s birthday--how many thousand changes pealed for the alderman’s\r\nannual feast--how many “tiddle-lol-tols” played on the celebration of\r\nyour election--parish dinners, &c. &c. Then think of their\r\nfine--half-minute--scientific--eloquent “tolls” for the death of the\r\n“young--the brave--and the fair!” Oh!--respectable gentlemen in\r\noffice--“think of these things.”\r\n\r\nI can aver, the ringers of St. Mary’s are only to be equalled in the\r\n_variety_ of their tunes, and unaccountable changes, by “the most\r\nhideous noise” of our Waterloo-road bellmen. I suppose they _are_ a\r\n“_young_ company.” I can only say, then, I wish they were _old_, if\r\nthere were any chance of their playing in tune and time.\r\n\r\nAnd now, farewell, my good “old ringers” of St. James’s. I have done all\r\nI can for you, and will say there is as much difference between your\r\nringing and the “_young_ company” at St. Mary’s, as there is between the\r\nfiddling of the late Billy Waters and Signor Spagnoletti, the leader of\r\nthe large theatre in the Haymarket!\r\n\r\nFarewell! May you have possession of St. Mary’s steeple by the time you\r\nsee this in the _Every-Day Book_; and may the first merry peal be given\r\nin honour of your considerate and faithful townsman--\r\n\r\n  S.

The custom\r\nmay, for aught I know to the contrary, be still continued, though I\r\nsuspect it has become obsolete, and my conjecture is strengthened by not\r\nobserving in your _Every-Day Book_ any mention of this civic excursion,\r\nor “_Swan-hopping_,” as I believe it was called. My reason for reviving\r\nthe memory of it now, is to introduce an authentic anecdote. Your\r\ninvitations to correspondents have been frequent; and should I be\r\nfortunate enough to assist you to a column in a way that will be\r\ngratifying to you and your numerous readers, I shall rejoice in the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  N. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n_City Swan-hopping._\r\n\r\nThe following curious circumstance occurred, several years ago, at a\r\ntavern in the vicinity of Putney-bridge. Several members of one of the\r\ncity companies having accompanied the chief magistrate on an excursion\r\nup the river, quitted his lordship, and landed at the house in question.\r\nA boat containing a party of six ladies, elegantly dressed, and rowed by\r\ntwo watermen, in scarlet jackets, put in at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe happy citizens relieved from the controul of their dames, could not\r\nresist this opportunity of showing their gallantry and politeness. They\r\nstepped forward and offered their aid to assist the ladies in landing;\r\nthe offer was accepted; and this act of civility was followed by others.\r\nThey walked, talked, and laughed together, till dinner was announced.\r\nThe gentlemen went to the larger room; the ladies sat down to a repast\r\nlaid out for them by their order in a smaller one.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the ladies again returned to the lawn, where the\r\ngentlemen occasionally joined them and continued their civilities till\r\nthe watermen informed them the tide served for their return to town. The\r\ngentlemen then assisted the ladies on board, and wished them a safe\r\nvoyage. Soon after they called for their bill, which was handed to the\r\nchairman in due form; but it is impossible to express the surprise which\r\nmarked his countenance on reading the following items:--“Dinner, desert,\r\nwine, tea, &c. for the ladies, 7_l._ 10_s._;” together with a charge of\r\ntwelve shillings for servants’ refreshments. The landlord was sent for\r\nand questioned as to this charge, who said the ladies had desired the\r\nbill should be delivered to their _spouses_, who would settle it. An\r\nexplanation now took place, when it appeared the parties were strangers\r\nto each other; for these sprightly dames, taking advantage of the\r\noccasional civilities of the gallant and unsuspecting _swan-hoppers_,\r\nhad imposed themselves on honest _Boniface_, nothing loth perhaps to be\r\nimposed on, as the wives of the city company, and, as such, had been\r\nserved with an elegant dinner, desert, wine, &c. which they had left\r\ntheir _husbands_ to pay for. The discovery at first disconcerted the\r\ngentlemen, but the wine they had drank having opened their hearts and\r\ninspired them with liberality, they took the trick put upon them in good\r\npart, and paid the bill; and the recollection of the _wives_ of the city\r\ncompany, long afterwards afforded them an ample subject for conversation\r\nand laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL POETRY.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following beautiful lines were written in the summer of the\r\nyear 1808, at Sheffield, and have not been published; as they are no\r\nmean effusion, perhaps they will not disgrace your interesting little\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  _July 9, 1826._\r\n\r\n  C.

The editor has very few omissions of this kind to\r\napologize for: if he has prematurely, and therefore unduly, introduced\r\nsome communications which arrived too late for their proper days, he may\r\nbe excused, perhaps, in consideration of the desire expressed by some\r\ncorrespondents, that their papers should appear in a “reasonable” time\r\nor not at all. Unhappily he has experienced the mishap of a “reasonable”\r\ndifference, with one or two of his contributors. From the plan of this\r\nwork, certain matters-of-fact could only range, with propriety, under\r\ncertain days; while it has been conceived of, by some, as a magazine\r\nwherein any thing could come, at any time. In this dilemma he has done\r\nthe best in his power, and introduced, in a few instances, papers of\r\nthat nature out of place. On two or three occasions, indeed, it seemed a\r\ncourtesy almost demanded by the value of such articles, that they should\r\nnot await the rotation of the year. The following curiously descriptive\r\naccount of a remarkable local custom is from a Somersetshire gentleman,\r\nwho could be relied on for a patient endurance of nine months, till\r\nthis, its due season arrived.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Bristol, October 19, 1825._\r\n\r\nSir,--Having observed in your _Every-Day Book_, p. 837, vol i. mention\r\nof an ancient custom of dividing lands, which formerly took place on the\r\nSaturday before old midsummer-day, in the parish of Puxton, in\r\nSomersetshire, (taken from Mr. Collinson’s history of that county,) I\r\nnow send you a more explicit and enlarged account, with the marks as\r\nthey were cut in each person’s allotment.\r\n\r\nThe two large pieces of common land called Dolemoors, which lie in the\r\nparishes of Congresbury, Week St. Lawrence and Puxton, were allotted in\r\nthe following manner. On the Saturday preceding midsummer-day O. S. the\r\nseveral proprietors (of the estates having any right in those moors) or\r\ntheir tenants, were summoned at a certain hour in the morning, by the\r\nringing of one of the bells at Puxton, to repair to the church, in order\r\nto see the chain (kept for the purpose of laying out Dolemoors)\r\nmeasured. The proper length of such chain was ascertained by placing one\r\nend thereof at the foot of the arch, dividing the chancel from the body\r\nof the church, and extending it through the middle aisle, to the foot of\r\nthe arch of the west door under the tower, at each of which places marks\r\nwere cut in the stones for that purpose. The chain used for this purpose\r\nwas only eighteen yards in length, consequently four yards shorter than\r\nthe regular land-measuring chain. After the chain had been properly\r\nmeasured, the parties repaired to the commons. Twenty-four apples were\r\npreviously prepared, bearing the following marks, viz. Five marks called\r\n“Pole-axes,” four ditto “Crosses,” two ditto “Dung-forks, or\r\nDung-pikes,” one mark called “Four Oxen and a Mare,” one ditto “Two\r\nPits,” one ditto “Three Pits,” one ditto “Four Pits,” one ditto “Five\r\nPits,” one ditto “Seven Pits,” one “Horn,” one “Hare’s-tail,” one\r\n“Duck’s-nest,” one “Oven,” one “Shell,” one “_Evil_,” and one\r\n“Hand-reel.”\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe that each of these moors was divided into\r\nseveral portions called furlongs, which were marked out by strong oak\r\nposts, placed at regular distances from each other; which posts were\r\nconstantly kept up. After the apples were properly prepared, they were\r\nput into a hat or bag, and certain persons fixed on for the purpose,\r\nbegan to measure with the chain before-mentioned, and proceeded till\r\nthey had measured off one acre of ground; at the end of which, the boy\r\nwho carried the hat or bag containing the marks took out one of the\r\napples, and the mark which such apple bore, was immediately cut in the\r\nturf with a large knife kept for that purpose: this knife was somewhat\r\nin the shape of a scimetar with its edge reversed. In this manner they\r\nproceeded till the whole of the commons were laid out, and each\r\nproprietor knowing the mark and furlong which belonged to his estate, he\r\ntook possession of his allotment or allotments accordingly, for the\r\nensuing year. An adjournment then took place to the house of one of the\r\noverseers, where a certain number of acres reserved for the purpose of\r\npaying expenses, and called the “out-let or out-drift,” were let by inch\r\nof candle.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of letting, the whole party were to keep silence,\r\n(except the person who bid,) under the penalty of one shilling. When any\r\none wished to bid, he named the price he would give, and immediately\r\ndeposited a shilling on the table where the candle stood; the next who\r\nbid, also named his price and deposited his shilling in like manner, and\r\nthe person who first bid was then to take up his shilling. The business\r\nof letting thus proceeded till the candle was burnt out, and the last\r\nbidder, prior to that event, was declared the tenant of the out-let, or\r\nout-drift, for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nTwo overseers were annually elected from the proprietors or their\r\ntenants. A quantity of strong ale or brown-stout was allowed for the\r\nfeast, or “revel,” as it was called; also bread, butter and cheese,\r\ntogether with pipes and tobacco, of which any reputable person, whose\r\ncuriosity or casual business led him to Puxton on that day, was at\r\nliberty to partake, but he was expected to deposit at his departure one\r\nshilling with the overseer, by way of forfeit for his intrusion. The day\r\nwas generally spent in sociality and mirth, frequently of a boisterous\r\nnature, from the exhilarating effects of the brown-stout before alluded\r\nto; for it rarely happened but that some of the junior part of the\r\ncompany were desirous of making a trial of their skill in the _sublime_\r\nart of pugilism, when hard knocks, thumps, bangs, and kicks, and\r\nconsequently black eyes, bloody noses, and sore bones, were distributed\r\nwith the greatest liberality amongst the combatants.\r\n\r\n    “And now the field of _Death_, the lists\r\n    Are enter’d by antagonists.”\r\n\r\nIn this stage of the business, some venerable yeoman usually stepped\r\nforward and harangued the contending parties, in some such speech as the\r\nfollowing, which I am sorry to say was most commonly thrown away upon\r\nthese pot-valiant champions:--\r\n\r\n    “What rage, O friends! what fury\r\n    Doth you to these dire actions hurry?\r\n    What towns, what garrisons might you,\r\n    With hazard of this blood subdue,\r\n    Which now y’are bent to throw away\r\n    In vain untriumphable fray?”\r\n\r\nYet after these _civil_ broils, the parties seldom bore each other any\r\ngrudge or ill-will, and generally at the conclusion of the contest,\r\n\r\n    “Tho’ sorely bruis’d, their limbs all o’er\r\n    With ruthless bangs still stiff and sore,”\r\n\r\nthey shook hands, became good friends again, and departed with the\r\ngreatest sang-froid to apply\r\n\r\n    “Fit med’cines to each glorious bruise\r\n    They got in fight, reds, blacks, and blues;\r\n    To mollify th’ uneasy pang\r\n    Of ev’ry honourable bang.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1779, an attempt was made to procure an act of parliament\r\nfor allotting these moors in perpetuity; but an opposition having been\r\nmade by a majority of the proprietors, the plan was relinquished. I have\r\nnow by me a printed copy of the bill drawn up on that occasion. The\r\nland, however, was actually enclosed and allotted in the year 1811, and\r\nthe ancient mode of dividing it, and consequently the drunken festival,\r\nor _revel_, from that time discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe following marks are correct delineations of those used, being taken\r\nfrom the originals in the book appropriated for the purpose of keeping\r\nthe accounts of this very singular and ancient usage.\r\n\r\n  ++===============================================++\r\n  ||      ~The Marks for Allotting Dolmoors.~      ||\r\n  ++-----------------------+------+----------------++\r\n  ||                       |No. of|                ||\r\n  ||                       | each.|                ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Pole-axe              |   5  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Cross                 |   4  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Dung-fork, or pike    |   2  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Four Oxen & a Mare    |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Two Pits              |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Three Pits            |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Four Pits             |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Five Pits             |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Seven Pits            |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Horn                  |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Hare’s-tail           |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Duck’s-nest           |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Oven                  |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Shell                 |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Evil                  |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  || Hand-reel             |   1  | [Illustration] ||\r\n  ||                       |      |                ||\r\n  ||                           A--d B----tt Delt.  ||\r\n  ++===============================================++\r\n\r\nI have from my youth lived within a few miles of the place mentioned,\r\nand have often heard of the “humours of Dolmoor revel,” and on one\r\noccasion attended personally the whole day for the purpose of observing\r\nthem, and ascertaining the customs of this rude, rural festival. As the\r\ncustoms before-mentioned are now become obsolete, it would be pleasing\r\nto many of your readers, to see them recorded in your very interesting\r\nand popular work. These customs originated in all probability with our\r\nSaxon ancestors, and it would be unpardonable to consign them to total\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n  G. B.\r\n\r\nAfter this description of the method of “laying out of lands,” at a\r\nperiod of the year when steam boats are conveying visiters to the\r\n“watering places on the Thames,” it seems prudent and seasonable to\r\nnotice another custom--\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT OF WIVES\r\n\r\n_In the Fens of Essex and Kent_.\r\n\r\n  And, first, as to this “grave” custom on the London side of the\r\n  Thames, we have the epistolary testimony of a writer in the year 1773,\r\n  viz.--\r\n\r\nSir,--Nothing but that unaccountable variety of life, which my stars\r\nhave imposed upon me, could have apologised for my taking a journey to\r\nthe fens of Essex. Few strangers go into those scenes of desolation, and\r\nfewer still (I find) return from thence--as you shall hear.\r\n\r\nWhen I was walking one morning between two of the banks which restrain\r\nthe waters in their proper bounds, I met one of the inhabitants, a tall\r\nand emaciated figure, with whom I entered into conversation. We talked\r\nconcerning the manners and peculiarities of the place, and I condoled\r\nwith him very pathetically on his forlorn and meagre appearance. He gave\r\nme to understand, however, that his case was far from being so desperate\r\nas I seemed to apprehend it, for that he had never looked better since\r\nhe buried the first of his last nine wives.\r\n\r\n“Nine wives!” rejoined I, eager and astonished, “have you buried nine\r\nwives?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the fen-man, “and I hope to bury nine more.”\r\n\r\n“Bravissimo!”--This was so far from allaying my astonishment, that it\r\nincreased it. I then begged him to explain the miraculous matter, which\r\nhe did in the following words:--\r\n\r\n“Lord! master,” said he, “we people in the fens here be such strange\r\ncreatures, that there be no creatures like us; we be like fish, or\r\nwater-fowl, or others, for we be able to live where other folks would\r\ndie sure enough.”\r\n\r\nHe then informed me, that to reside in the fens was a certain and quick\r\ndeath to people who had not been bred among them; that therefore when\r\nany of the fen-men wanted a wife, they went into the upland country for\r\none, and that, after they carried her down among the fens, she never\r\nsurvived long: that after her death they went to the uplands for\r\nanother, who also died; then “another, and another, and another,” for\r\nthey all followed each other as regular as the change of the moon; that\r\nby these means some “poor fellows” had picked up a good living, and\r\ncollected together from the whole a little snug fortune; that he himself\r\nhad made more money this way than he ever could do by his labour, for\r\nthat he was now at his tenth wife, and she could not possibly stand it\r\nout above three weeks longer; that these proceedings were very\r\nequitable, for such girls as were born among themselves they sent into\r\nthe uplands to get husbands, and that, in exchange, they took their\r\nyoung women as wives; that he never knew a better custom in his life,\r\nand that the only comfort he ever found against the ill-nature and\r\ncaprice of women was the fens. This woman-killer then concluded with\r\ndesiring me, if I had a wife with whom I was not over head and ears in\r\nlove, to bring her to his house, and it would kill her as effectually as\r\nany doctor in Christendom could do. This offer I waved; for you know,\r\nsir, that (thank God) I am not married.\r\n\r\nThis strange conversation of my friend, the fen-man, I could not pass\r\nover without many reflections; and I thought it my duty to give notice\r\nto my countrymen concerning a place which may be converted in so\r\npeculiar a manner to their advantage.[245]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far is from the narrative of a traveller into _Essex_, who, be it\r\nobserved, “speaks for himself,” and whose account is given “without note\r\nor comment;” it being certain that every rightly affected reader will\r\nform a correct opinion of such a narrator, and of the “fearful estate”\r\nof “upland women” who marry “lowland men.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs regards the “custom of Kent,” in this matter, we have the account of\r\na “Steam-boat Companion,” who, turning “to the Kentish shore,” says\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYENLET CREEK\r\n\r\nDivides the isle of Grean from All-hallows, on the main land, and from\r\nthe cliff marshes.\r\n\r\nWho would believe while beholding these scenes of pleasure before us,\r\nthat for six months in the year the shores of this hundred (Hoo) were\r\nonly to be explored by the amphibious; that the sun is seldom seen for\r\nthe fog, and that every creature in love with life, flies the swamps of\r\nHoo, preferring any station to its ague dealing vapours, its fenny\r\nfilth, and muddy flats; a station, that during the winter season is\r\ndestitute of every comfort, but fine eels, luscious flounders, smuggled\r\nbrandy, Holland’s gin, and sea-coal fire. We will here relate a\r\nwhimsical circumstance that once took place in this neighbourhood while\r\nwe were of the party.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time of the year when nature seems to sicken at her own\r\ninfirmities, we think it was in the month of November, we were bound to\r\nSheerness, but the fog coming on so gloomily that no man could discover\r\nhis hand a yard before him, our waterman, whether by design or accident\r\nwe cannot pretend to say, mistook the Thames, and rowed up the Yenlet\r\ncreek. After a long, cold, and stubborn pull, protesting at the time he\r\nhad never (man or boy) seen any thing so dismal, he landed us near Saint\r\nMary’s, that church yonder, with the very lofty and white spire, and\r\nthen led us to an alehouse, the sign of which _he_ called the _Red Cock\r\nand Cucumber_, and the aleman he hailed by the merry name of\r\n\r\n_John Piper_,\r\n\r\nAnd a very pleasant fellow John turned out to be; if he was a little\r\nhyperbolical, his manner sufficiently atoned for the transgression. The\r\ngloom of the day was soon forgotten, and the stench arising from filthy\r\nswamps less regarded. At our entrance we complained heavily of the\r\ninsupportable cloud with which we had been enveloped.\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! ha!” sang out the landlord, “to be sure it is too thick to be\r\neaten with a spoon, and too thin to be cut with a knife, but it is not\r\nso intolerable as a scolding wife, or a hungry lawyer.”\r\n\r\n“Curse the fog,” cried our waterman,\r\n\r\n“Bless the fog,” answered our landlord, “for it has made a man of me for\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“How do you make that appear?” we requested to know.\r\n\r\n“Set you down, sir, by a good sea-coal fire, for we pay no pool duties\r\nhere, take your grog merrily, and I’ll tell you all about it presently,”\r\nrejoined the tapster, when drawing a wooden stool towards us, while his\r\nwife was preparing the bowl, John Piper thus began:--\r\n\r\n“You must know, sir, I was born in this fog, and so was my mother and\r\nher relatives for many past generations; therefore you will see, sir, a\r\nfog is as natural to me as a duck-pool to a dab-chick. When poor dame\r\nPiper died, I found myself exceedingly melancholy to live alone on these\r\nmarshes, so determined to change my condition by taking a wife. It was\r\nvery fortunate for me, sir, I knew a rich old farmer in the _uplands_,\r\nand he had three blooming daughters, and that which made the thing more\r\ndesirable, he had determined to give each a portion of his honourably\r\nacquired property. The farmer had for many years been acquainted with my\r\ngood father, gone to rest, and this gave me courage to lay my case\r\nbefore him. The elder girl was the bird for me, the farmer gave his\r\nconsent, and we were married. Directly after, I quitted the uplands for\r\nthe fog, with a pretty wife and five hundred golden guineas in my\r\npocket, as good as ever bribed a lawyer to sell his client, or a\r\nparliament-man to betray his country. This was a good beginning, sir,\r\nbut alas! there is no comfort without a cross; my wife had been used\r\nfrom her infancy to a fine keen open air, and our _low_land vapours so\r\nderanged her constitution, that within nine months, Margaret left me and\r\nwent to heaven.\r\n\r\n“Being so suddenly deprived of the society of one good woman, where\r\ncould I apply for another, better than to the sack from whence I drew\r\nthe first sample? The death of my dear wife reflected no disgrace on me,\r\nand the old man’s second daughter having no objection to a good husband,\r\nwe presently entered into the bonds of holy matrimony, and after a few\r\ndays of merriment, I came home with Susan, from the sweet hills to the\r\nfogs of the _low_lands, and with four hundred as good guineas in my\r\npurse as ever gave new springs to the life of poverty. Similar causes,\r\nsir, they say produce similar effects; and this is certainly true, for\r\nin somewhere about nine months more, Susan slept with her sister.\r\n\r\n“I ran to the _up_lands again, to condole with my poor old Nestor, and\r\nsome how or other so managed the matter, that his youngest daughter,\r\nRosetta, conceived a tender affection for Piper. I shall never forget\r\nit, sir, while I have existence; I had been there but a few days, when\r\nthe good farmer, with tears in his eyes, thus addressed me: ‘Piper, you\r\nhave received about nine hundred pounds of my money, and I have about\r\nthe same sum left; now, son, as you know how to make a good use of it, I\r\nthink it is a pity it should go out of the family; therefore, if you\r\nhave a fancy for Rosetta, I will give you three hundred pounds more, and\r\nthe remnant at my departure.’\r\n\r\n“Sir, I had always an aversion to stand _shilly shally_, ‘make haste and\r\nleave nothing to waste,’ says the old proverb. The kind girl was\r\nconsenting, and we finished the contract over a mug of her father’s best\r\nOctober. From the hills we ran to the _fog_land, and in less than two\r\nyears more, poor Rosetta was carried up the churchway path, where the\r\nthree sisters, as they used to do in their infancy, lie by the side of\r\neach other; and the old man dying of grief for the loss of his\r\nfavourite, I placed him at their head, and became master of a pretty\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n“A short time after, a wealthy widow from Barham, (of the same family,)\r\ncame in the summer time to our place. I saw her at church, and she set\r\nher cap at Piper; I soon married her for her _Eldorado metal_, but alas!\r\nshe turned out a shrew. ‘Nil desperandum’ said I, Piper, to myself, the\r\n_winter_ is coming in good time; the winter came, and stood my friend;\r\nfor the _fog_ and the ague took her by the hand and led her to Abraham’s\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n“An innkeeper’s relict was the next I ventured on, she had possessions\r\nat Sittingbourne, and they were hardly mine before my good friend, the\r\nfog, laid Arabella ‘at _all-fours_’ under the turf, in St. Mary’s\r\nchurchyard; and now, sir, her sister, the cast-off of a rich Jew, fell\r\ninto my trap, and I led her smiling, like a vestal, to the temple of\r\nHymen; but although the most lively and patient creature on earth, she\r\ncould not resist the powers of the _fog_, and I for the sixth time\r\nbecame a widower, with an income of three hundred a year, and half the\r\ncottages in this blessed hundred. To be brief, sir, I was now in want of\r\nnothing but a contented mind; thus, sir, through the _fog_ you treated\r\nwith such malignity, I became qualified for a country member. But alas!\r\nsir, there is always something unpleasant to mingle with the best of\r\nhuman affairs, envy is ever skulking behind us, to squeeze her gall-bag\r\ninto the cup of our comforts, and when we think ourselves in safety, and\r\nmay sing the song of ‘O! be joyful,’ our merriment ends with a\r\n‘miseracordia.’”\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, “Look, sir,” said Piper, in a loud whisper, “at\r\nthat woman in the bar, now making the grog, she is my seventh wife;\r\nwith her I had a fortune also, but of a different nature from all the\r\nrest. I married her without proper consideration--the wisest are\r\nsometimes overtaken; Solomon had his disappointments; would you think\r\nit, sir? she was _fogborn_ like myself, and withal, is so tough in her\r\nconstitution, that I fear she will hold me a tight tug to the end of my\r\nexistence, and become my survivor.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! ha!” interjected Mrs. Piper, (who had heard all the long tale\r\nof the tapster,) “there is no fear about that, John, and bury as many\r\n_up_land _husbands_, when you lie under the turf, as you, with the fog,\r\nhave smothered _wives_.”\r\n\r\nOur Yorick now became chop-fallen, and a brisk wind springing up from\r\nthe north-west, the fog abated, and we took to our boat.[246]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf there be truth in these narratives, the “_low_land lasses” of the\r\ncreeks, have good reason for their peculiar liking to “_high_land\r\nladdies;” and “_up_land” girls had better “wither on the virgin thorn,”\r\nthan marry “_low_land” suitors and--\r\n\r\n    “Fall as the leaves do\r\n    And die in October.”\r\n\r\nFar be it from the editor, to bring the worthy “neither fish nor flesh”\r\nswains, of the Kent and Essex fens and fogs, into contempt; he knows\r\nnothing about them. What he has set down he found in “the books,” and,\r\nhaving given his authorities, he wishes them every good they\r\ndesire--save wives from the _up_lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·75.\r\n\r\n  [245] Universal Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [246] The Steam-boat Companion, by Thomas Nichols, 1823, p. 150.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 7.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS A BECKET.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the name of this saint, so obnoxious to the early\r\nreformers, is still retained in the church of England calendar; the fact\r\nis no less strange that the day of his festival is the anniversary of\r\nthe translation of his relics from the undercroft of the cathedral of\r\nCanterbury, in the year 1220, to a sumptuous shrine at the east end of\r\nthe church, whither they attracted crowds of pilgrims, and, according to\r\nthe legends of the Romish church, worked abundant miracles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~St. Thomas a Becket.~]\r\n\r\nThis engraving is from a drawing by Mr. Harding, who states that he made\r\nit from a very rare engraving.

He advanced the interests of the church against\r\nthe interests of the kingdom, till a parliament declared his possessions\r\nforfeited, and Becket having left the kingdom, Henry seized the revenues\r\nof the see.\r\n\r\nIt appears from an old tract that this churchman was a swordsman. He\r\naccompanied Henry in one of his campaigns with a retinue of seven\r\nhundred knights and gentlemen, kept twelve hundred horse in his own\r\npay, and bore his dignity with the carriage of the proudest baron. “His\r\nbridle was of silver, his saddle of velvet, his stirrups, spurs, and\r\nbosses, double gilt. His expenses far surpassing the expenses of an\r\nearl. He fed with the fattest, was clad with the softest, and kept\r\ncompany with the pleasantest. And the king made him his chancellor, in\r\nwhich office he passed the pomp and pride of Thomas [Wolsey] Cardinal,\r\nas far as the one’s shrine passeth the other’s tomb in glory and riches.\r\nAnd, after that, he was a man of war, and captain of five or six\r\nthousand men in full harness, as bright as St. George, and his spear in\r\nhis hand; and encountered whosoever came against him, and overthrew the\r\njollyest rutter that was in all the host of France. And out of the\r\nfield, hot from blood-shedding, was he made bishop of Canterbury, and\r\ndid put off his helm, and put on his mitre; put off his harness, and on\r\nwith his robes; and laid down his spear, and took his cross, ere his\r\nhands were cold; and so came, with a lusty courage of a man of war, to\r\nfight another while against his prince for the pope; when his prince’s\r\ncause were with the law of God and the pope’s clean contrary.”\r\n\r\nAfter his disgrace by the king he wore a hair shirt, ate meats of the\r\ndriest, excommunicated his brother bishops, and “was favoured with a\r\nrevelation of his martyrdom,” at Pontigni. Alban Butler says, “whilst he\r\nlay prostrate before the altar in prayers and tears, he heard a voice,\r\nsaying distinctly, ‘Thomas, Thomas, my church shall be glorified in thy\r\nblood.’ The saint asked, ‘Who art thou, Lord?’ and the same voice\r\nanswered, ‘I am Jesus Christ, the son of the living God, thy brother.’”\r\nHe then returned to England, excited rebellious commotions, and on\r\nChristmas-day, 1170, preached his last sermon to his flock, on the text,\r\n“And peace to men of good-will on earth.” These are the words wherein\r\nAlban Butler expresses the “text,” which, it may be as well to observe,\r\nis a garbled passage from the New Testament, and was altered perhaps to\r\nsuit the saint’s views and application. Room cannot be afforded in this\r\nplace for particulars of his preceding conduct, or an exact description\r\nof his death, which is well-known to have been accomplished by “four\r\nknights,” who, from attachment to the king, according to the brutal\r\nmanners of those days, revenged his quarrel by killing St. Thomas, while\r\nat prayers in Canterbury cathedral.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following interesting paper relates to one of the knights who slew\r\nBecket--\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM DE TRACY.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _June, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--I beg leave to transmit to you an account of the burial place of\r\nsir William de Tracy, one of the murderers of Thomas à Becket,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of Henry the Second. I regret, at\r\nthe same time, that distance from the spot precludes the possibility of\r\nmy taking a drawing of the tomb, but I have by me its measurement, and\r\nthe inscription, which I copied with as great care as possible when\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of Morthoe, probably built by Tracy himself, is\r\nsituated on the bold and rocky coast of the north of Devon. It stands on\r\nan eminence, near the sea-shore, is sheltered by hills on the north and\r\nsouth, but open towards the west, on which side is the fine bay of\r\nWoolacombe. The interior of the church presents the humblest appearance;\r\nits length is near 80 feet, its breadth 18, excepting the middle, which,\r\nwith an aisle, measures 30. On the west side is a recess, 15 feet by 14,\r\nin the centre of which is the vault, containing the remains of de Tracy.\r\nThe rustic inhabitants of the parish can give no other account of the\r\ntomb than the traditionary one, that it contains the remains of a giant,\r\nto whom, in the olden time, all that part of the country belonged.\r\n\r\nThe vault itself is 2 feet 4 in. high; 7 feet 6 in. long at the base;\r\nthree feet and a half broad at one end of ditto, and two feet and a\r\nhalf, at the other. The large black slab covering the top of the vault\r\nis half a foot in thickness. Engraved on this slab is the figure of a\r\nperson in robes, holding a chalice in one hand; and round the border is\r\nan inscription, which is now almost illegible. I had a drawing of the\r\nwhole, which I have lost, but with the account I wrote at the time of\r\nvisiting the place, I have preserved the inscription, as far as I was\r\nable to make it out.[247]\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the vault are three armorial bearings, and the\r\ncarved figures of two nuns; on the north is the crucifixion; on the west\r\nside, there is nothing but Gothic carving; and the south end is plain.\r\n\r\nAn old and respectable farmer, residing at Morthoe, informed me that\r\nabout fifty or sixty years ago “a gentleman from London” came down to\r\ntake an account of the tomb, and carried away with him the skull and one\r\nof the thigh bones of de Tracy. He opened and examined the vault with\r\nthe connivance of a negligent and eccentric minister, then resident in\r\nthe parish, who has left behind him a fame by no means to be envied.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman alluded to by the worthy yeoman was no doubt the\r\ncelebrated antiquary Gough, who, in his “Sepulchral Monuments in Great\r\nBritain,” has given a long account of the life and burialplace of Tracy.\r\nIn his introduction to that laborious and very valuable work, page ciii.\r\nhe says:--“The instances of figures cut in the slab, and not inlaid with\r\nmetal, nor always blacked, are not uncommon.” Among the instances which\r\nhe cites to illustrate this remark, he mentions the slab on the vault of\r\n“William de Tracy, Rector of Morthoe, Devon, 1322.”--Here we find the\r\ngigantic knight dwindled to a parson; and the man whose name should be\r\nfor ever remembered with gratitude by his countrymen, the hero who\r\nhappily achieved a far more arduous enterprise, a work of greater glory\r\nthan did the renowned but fabled saint, over the devouring\r\ndragon--forgotten beneath the robe of an obscure village rector! The\r\nparish of Morthoe is, however, not a rectory, but what is called a\r\n“perpetual curacy,” and the living is at present not worth much more\r\nthan seventy pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nSince I have, by the merest accident, got hold of Gough, I will extract\r\nwhat he records of the forgotten Tracy, as it may not be unentertaining\r\nto the lover of history to peruse a detail of the ultimate fate of one\r\nof the glorious four, who delivered their country from perhaps the\r\ngreatest pest that was ever sent to scourge it.\r\n\r\n“William de Tracy, one of the murderers of Becket, has been generally\r\nsupposed, on the authority of Mr. Risdon, (p. 116.) to have built an\r\naisle in the church of Morthoe, Devon; and to have therein an altar-tomb\r\nabout 2 feet high, with his figure engraven on a grey slab of Purbeck\r\nmarble, 7 feet by 3, and 7 inches thick, and this inscription, [in Saxon\r\ncapitals,]\r\n\r\n    “SYRE [Guillau] ME DE TRACY [gist icy, Diu de son al] ME EYT MERCY.\r\n\r\n“On the upper end of this tomb is carved in relief the crucifixion, with\r\nthe virgin and St. John, and on the north side some Gothic arches, and\r\nthese three coats; I. Az. 3 lions passant guardant, Arg. 2. Arg. 3. two\r\nbars, G. Az. a saltire, Or.----The first of these is the coat of\r\n_William Camville_, formerly patron of this church: the second, that of\r\nthe _Martins_, formerly lords of Barnstaple, who had lands in this\r\nneighbourhood: the third, that of the _Saint Albins_, who had also\r\nestates in the adjoining parish of Georgeham.\r\n\r\n“The figure on the slab is plainly that of a priest in his sacerdotal\r\nhabit, holding a chalice between his hands, as if in the act of\r\nconsecration.----Bishop Stapledon’s register, though it does not contain\r\nthe year of his institution, fixes the date of his death in the\r\nfollowing terms, ‘_Anno, 1322, 16 Decr. Thomas Robertus præsentat. ad\r\neccles. de Morthoe vacantem per mortem Wilhelmi de Traci, die dominic.\r\nprimo post nativ. Virginis per mortem Will. de Campvill_.’\r\n\r\n“The era of the priest is therefore 140 years later than that of the\r\nknight. It does not appear by the episcopal registers that the Tracies\r\nwere ever patrons of Morthoe, except in the following instances:--\r\n\r\n“Anno, 1257, Cal. Junii, John Allworthy, presented by Henry de Traci,\r\nguardian of the lands and heirs of Ralph de Brag. Anno, 1275. Thomas\r\nCapellanus was presented to this rectory by Philip de Weston. In 1330,\r\nFeb. 5, Henry de la Mace was presented to this rectory by William de\r\nCamville. In 1381, Richard Hopkins was presented by the dean and chapter\r\nof Exeter, who are still patrons.\r\n\r\n“It is probable that the stone with the inscription to William de Tracy\r\ndid not originally belong to the altar-tomb on which it now lies; but by\r\nthe arms seems rather to have been erected for the patron _William de\r\nCamville_, it being unusual in those days to raise so handsome a\r\nmonument for a priest, especially as the altar-tomb and slab are of very\r\ndifferent materials, and the benefice itself is of very inconsiderable\r\nvalue. It is also probable the monument of Traci lay on the ground, and\r\nthat when this monument was broken open, according to Risdon, in the\r\nlast century, this purbeck slab was placed upon the altar-tomb though it\r\ndid not at first belong to it.\r\n\r\n“The Devonshire antiquaries assert that sir William de Tracy retired to\r\nthis place after he had murdered Becket. But this tradition seems to\r\nrest on no better authority than the misrepresentation of the\r\ninscription here given, and because the family of Traci possessed the\r\nfourth part of a fee in Woolacombe within this parish, which is still\r\ncalled after their name. But the Tracies had many possessions in this\r\ncountry, as Bovey Traci, Nymett Traci, Bedford Traci, &c. William de\r\nTraci held the honor of Barnstaple, in the beginning of Henry the\r\nSecond’s reign. King John granted the Barony of Barnstaple to Henry de\r\nTraci, in the 15th of his reign; and the family seem to have been\r\npossessed of it in the reign of Henry III. I am indebted to the\r\nfriendship of the present Dean of Exeter for the above observations,\r\nwhich ascertain the monument in question.\r\n\r\n“I shall digress no farther on this subject than to observe of sir\r\nWilliam de Traci, that four years after the murder of Becket he had the\r\ntitle of Steward, i. e. Justice of Normandy, which he held but two\r\nyears. He was in arms against King John in the last year of his reign,\r\nand his estate was confiscated; but on his return to his allegiance, 2\r\nHenry III. it was restored. He was living, 7 Henry III. (Dugd. Bar. i.\r\n622.) consequently died about or after 1223, having survived Becket\r\nupwards of 57 years.”[248]\r\n\r\nAnother slight mention is made of Tracy in p. 26. In describing Becket’s\r\nshrine he quotes Stowe to this effect,--“The shrine of Thomas à Becket\r\n(says Stowe) was builded about a man’s height, all of stone, then upward\r\nof timber plain, within which was a chest of iron, containing the bones\r\nof Thomas Beckett, skull and all, with the wound of his death, and the\r\npiece cut out of his scull laid in the same wound.” Gough remarks:--“He\r\nshould have added the point of Sir William Traci, the fourth assassin’s\r\nsword, which broke off against the pavement, after cutting off his\r\nscull, so that the brains came out.\r\n\r\n    ‘In thulke stede the verthe smot, y^{t} the other adde er ydo,\r\n    And the point of is suerd brec in the marbreston a tuo,\r\n    Zat thulke point at Canterbury the monckes lateth wite,\r\n    Vor honor of the holi man y^{t} therewith was ismite.\r\n    With thulke strok he smot al of the scolle & eke the crowne\r\n    That the brain ron al ebrod in the pauiment ther donne.’”\r\n\r\n  (Robert of Glouces. p. 476.)\r\n\r\nThis long extract, Mr. Editor, has, I confess, made me rather\r\ncasuistical on the subject of Tracy’s tomb. I shall, however, search\r\nsome of the old chroniclers and see if they throw any light upon the\r\nbiography of our knight. Hume mentions Tracy, and his three companions,\r\nbut is perfectly silent with respect to the cutting off the top of the\r\nchurchman’s skull. His words are, “they followed him thither, attacked\r\nhim before the altar, and having cloven his head with many blows,\r\nretired without meeting any opposition.” Should you, in the mean time,\r\ninsert this, you will shortly hear again from\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  R.

In my humble\r\nopinion, the circumstance of technical heraldic bearings, and those\r\nmoreover quartered, being found upon it, completely negatives the idea\r\nof its being the tomb of Becket’s assassin. It is well known that the\r\nfirst English subject who ever bore arms quarterly is Hastings, earl of\r\nPembroke, who died in the reign of Edward III. and is buried in\r\nWestminster abbey.\r\n\r\nFamily arms seem not to have been continuedly adopted, till towards the\r\ntime of Edward I.\r\n\r\n  W. P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of Becket appears to have been sincerely deplored by Henry\r\nII., inasmuch as the pope and his adherents visited the sin of the four\r\nknights upon the king, and upbraided him with his subjects by\r\necclesiastical fulminations. He endeavoured to make peace with the\r\nchurch by submitting to a public whipping. A late biographer records his\r\nmeanness in the following sentences:\r\n\r\nIn 1174 king Henry went on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the late\r\narchbishop Becket, with the fame of whose miracles the whole realm was\r\nnow filled, and whom the pope, by a bull dated in March the year before,\r\nhad declared a saint and a martyr, appointing an anniversary festival to\r\nbe kept on the day of his death, in order (says the bull) that, being\r\ncontinually applied to by the prayers of the faithful, he should\r\nintercede with God for the clergy and people of England.\r\n\r\nHenry, therefore, desiring to obtain for himself this intercession, or\r\nto make others believe that the wrath of an enemy, to whom it was\r\nsupposed that such power was given, might be thus averted from him,\r\nthought it necessary to visit the shrine of this new-created saint; and,\r\nas soon as he came within sight of the tower of Canterbury cathedral,\r\n(July 10,) at the distance of three miles, descended from his horse, and\r\nwalked thither barefoot, over a road that was full of rough and sharp\r\nstones, which so wounded his feet that in many places they were stained\r\nwith his blood.\r\n\r\nWhen he got to the tomb, which was then in the crypt (or under-croft) of\r\nthe church, he threw himself prostrate before it, and remained, for some\r\ntime, in fervent prayer; during which, by his orders, the bishop of\r\nLondon, in his name, declared to the people, that “he had neither\r\ncommanded, nor advised, nor by any artifice contrived the death of\r\nBecket, for the truth of which, he appealed, in the most solemn manner,\r\nto the testimony of God; but, as the murderers of that prelate had taken\r\noccasion from his words, too inconsiderately spoken, to commit this\r\noffence, he voluntarily thus submitted himself to the discipline of the\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nAfter this he was scourged, at his own request and command, by all the\r\nmonks of the convent, assembled for that purpose, from every one of\r\nwhom, and from several bishops and abbots there present, he received\r\nthree or four stripes.\r\n\r\nThis sharp penance being done, he returned to his prayers before the\r\ntomb, which he continued all that day, and all the next night, not even\r\nsuffering a carpet to be spread beneath him, but kneeling on the hard\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning he went round all the altars of the church, and\r\npaid his devotions to the bodies of the saints there interred; which\r\nhaving performed, he came back to Becket’s tomb, where he staid till the\r\nhour when mass was said in the church, at which he assisted.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time he had taken no kind of food; and, except when he\r\ngave his naked body to be whipped, was clad in sackcloth. Before his\r\ndeparture, (that he might fully complete the expiation of his sin,\r\naccording to the notions of the church of Rome,) he assigned a revenue\r\nof forty pounds a year, to keep lights always burning in honour of\r\nBecket about his tomb. The next evening he reached London, where he\r\nfound it necessary to be blooded, and rest some days.[249]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·00.\r\n\r\n  [247] Unfortunately it was not discovered that some of the letters, in\r\n  the inscription referred to, could not be represented by the usual\r\n  Saxon types, till it was too late to remedy the accident by having\r\n  them engraven on wood; and hence the inscription is, of necessity,\r\n  omitted.--_Editor._\r\n\r\n  [248] Gough’s Sepul.

Some boys who had been\r\nstrolling to a distance brought an account that a little man, with a\r\nbarrow as large as a house, was coming along the lane, at “a snail’s\r\ngallop.” Forth sallied a troop of gazers who found a small, thick-set,\r\nround-faced man, in an old, red, soldier’s jacket, and cocked hat,\r\nsitting on the handle of his barrow, which was built and roofed after\r\nthe manner of a caravan; and was a storehouse of some kind of\r\nmerchandise, what they yet knew not. He sat very quietly as they came\r\nround him, and returned their greetings in a way short and dry, and\r\nwhich became markedly testy and impatient, as they crowded more closely,\r\nand began to ask questions. “Not too fast, my masters; not too fast! my\r\nfirst answer can’t overtake your twentieth question.” At length he rose,\r\nand, by the aid of a strong strap passed over his shoulders, heaved up\r\nthe handles of his barrow, and placing his head against it, like a\r\ntortoise under a stone, proceeded at a toilsome rate of some few hundred\r\nyards per hour. This specimen of patient endurance amazed the villagers.\r\nA brawny labourer would have thought it a severe toil to wheel it a\r\nmile; yet this singular being, outdoing the phlegmatic perseverance of\r\nan ass, casting Job himself in the background for patience, from league\r\nto league, from county to county, and from year to year, urged on his\r\nponderous vehicle with almost imperceptible progression.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that he was not more singular in appearance, than\r\neccentric in mind. A villager, thinking to do him a kindness, offered to\r\nwheel his barrow, but what was the surprise of the gazers to see him\r\npresent the man payment when he had moved it a considerable way, and on\r\nits being refused, to behold him quietly raise the barrow, turn it\r\nround, and wheel it back to the identical spot whence the villager set\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the hamlet, he took up his quarters in a stable, and opened\r\nhis one-wheeled caravan, displaying a good assortment of cutlery ware.\r\nIt was there I first saw him, and was struck with his grave and\r\nuncomplying air, more like that of a beadle stationed to keep off\r\nintruders, than of a solicitous vender of wares. He was standing with a\r\npair of pliers, twisting wire into scissor-chains; keeping, at the same\r\ntime, a shrewd eye upon the goods. The prices were so wonderfully low\r\nthat it was whispered the articles could not be good, or they were\r\nstolen: yet I did not perceive that either idea was sufficient to\r\ndissuade the people from buying, or from attempting to get them still\r\nlower. Then it was that his character and temper showed themselves. He\r\nlaid aside the goods attempted to be chaffered for, saying,--“You shall\r\nnot have them at all, I tell no lies about them nor shall you.” In fact\r\nhis goods were _goods_. So much so, that many of them are in use in the\r\nvillage to this day: he desired only such a profit as would supply the\r\nnecessities of one who never slept in a bed, never approached a fire for\r\nthe sake of its warmth, nor ever indulged in any luxury. His greatest\r\ntrial appeared to be to bear with the sordid spirit of the world. When\r\nthis did not cross him he became smiling, communicative, and, strange as\r\nit may seem, exceedingly intelligent. I well recollect my boyish\r\nastonishment when he quoted to me maxims of Plato and Seneca, and when I\r\nheard him pouring out abundance of anecdote from the best sources. He\r\nhad a real spirit of kindliness in him, though the most immediately\r\nstriking features of his mind were shrewdness and rigid notions of\r\ntruth; which, as he practised it himself, he seemed to expect from the\r\nwhole world. He had a tame hedgehog which partook his fare, slept in a\r\nbetter nest than himself, and was evidently a source of affectionate\r\nenjoyment. He was fond of children; but he had a stern spirit of\r\nindependence which made him refuse gifts and favours, unless permitted\r\nto make some return. My mother frequently sent him warm messes in the\r\nwintry weather, and he brought her a scissor-chain and a candlestick of\r\nbrass-wire. He was a writer of anagrams, acrostics, and so forth; and\r\none epitaph written for one of his bystanders was,--\r\n\r\n    “Too bad for heaven, too good for hell,\r\n    So where he’s gone I cannot tell.”\r\n\r\nHe always slept with his barrow chained to his leg; and on Sundays kept\r\nhimself totally shut up, except during service time, standing the day\r\nthrough, reading his bible.\r\n\r\nWhen his character was known, he grew to be a general favourite. His\r\nstable became a sort of school, where he taught, to a constant audience,\r\nmore useful knowledge than has emanated from many a philosopher, modern\r\nor antique. The good-will he excited evidently pleased the old man; he\r\ncame again, and again, till at length years rolled away without his\r\nreappearance, and he was considered as dead. But not so. For ten or\r\neleven years he was still going on his pilgrimage, a wanderer and an\r\noutcast; probably doing voluntary penance for some sin or unhappiness of\r\nyouth; for he carefully kept aloof of his native country, Scotland, and\r\nthough he spoke of one living sister with tearful eyes, he had not seen\r\nher for many, many years. In 1820 he had found his way to Midsomer\r\nNorton, near Bristol, where he was hooted into the town by a troop of\r\nboys, a poor, worn-down object, of the most apparent misery. This I\r\naccidentally learnt, a short time ago, from a little book, the memorial\r\nof his last days, written by the worthy clergyman of that place, and\r\npublished by Simpkin and Marshall, London.\r\n\r\nWhat a tale would the history of those years have displayed. What scenes\r\nof solitary travel, exhaustion, suffering, insults, and occasional\r\nsympathy and kindness, breaking, like cheering sunbeams, through the\r\nordinary gloom. _His barrow was gone!_ Poverty had wrung from him, or\r\nweakness had compelled him to abandon, that old companion of his\r\ntravels. I have often thought what must have been his feelings at that\r\nparting. Poor old man, it was his house, his friend, his dog, his\r\neverything. What energies had he not expended in propelling it from\r\nplace to place. It could not have been left without a melancholy\r\npang,--without seeming to begin a more isolated and cheerless existence.\r\nBut I cannot dwell upon the subject. It is sufficient to say that he\r\nfound in the rev. William Read, who wrote the little book just\r\nmentioned, an excellent friend in the time of final need. That he\r\nretained the same eccentric, yet consistent character to the last;\r\ndisplaying, in a concluding scene of such bodily wretchedness and\r\nsufferings as has seldom been paralleled, the same astonishing\r\nendurance, nay ebullient thankfulness of heart; and that his piety seems\r\nto have worn off much of his asperity of manner.\r\n\r\nA didactic poem called “The Flower Knot,” or, “The Guide Post,” was\r\nfound after his death, a composition of no ordinary merit, from which we\r\nwill quote two passages, and bid a final adieu to our old friend under\r\nevery name of Thomas Hogg, Tam Hogg, or Cheap Tommy.\r\n\r\n_Wit._\r\n\r\n    “Pope calls it feather--does he not say right?\r\n    ’Tis like a custard weak, and bears no weight;\r\n    But had it not that wiping feather been\r\n    The poet’s lines had never shone so clean.\r\n    Wisdom on foot ascends by slow degrees;\r\n    But wit has wings, and soars aloft with ease.\r\n    The sweetest wine makes vinegar most sour,\r\n    So wit debased is hell’s consummate power.”\r\n\r\n_Hope._\r\n\r\n    “Fountain of song, it prayer begins and ends;\r\n    Hope is the wing by which the soul ascends.\r\n    Some may allege I wander from the path,\r\n    And give to Hope the proper rights of Faith.\r\n    Like love and friendship, these, a comely pair,\r\n    What’s done by one, the other has a share:\r\n    When heat is felt, we judge that fire is near,\r\n    Hope’s twilight comes,--Faith’s day will soon appear.\r\n    Thus when the christian’s contest doth begin\r\n    Hope fights with doubts, till Faith’s reserves come in.\r\n    Hope comes desiring and expects relief;\r\n    Faith follows, and peace springs from firm belief.\r\n    Hope balances occurrences of time;\r\n    Faith will not stop till it has reached the prime.\r\n    Just like copartners in joint stock of trade,\r\n    What one contracts is by the other paid.\r\n    Make use of Hope thy labouring soul to cheer,\r\n    Faith shall be giv’n, if thou wilt persevere.\r\n    We see all things alike with either eye,\r\n    So Faith and Hope the self-same object spy.\r\n    But what is Hope? or where, or how begun?\r\n    It comes from God, as light comes from the sun.”\r\n\r\n  H.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this interesting narrative concerning Thomas Hogg, the\r\n“little book--the memorial of his last days” by the rev. Mr. Read, was\r\nprocured by the editor. It is entitled “The Scottish Wanderer,” and as\r\nour kind correspondent “H.” has only related his own observations,\r\nprobably from apprehension that his narrative might be deemed of\r\nsufficient length, a few particulars are extracted from Mr. Read’s tract\r\nrespecting the latter days of this “singular character.”\r\n\r\nMr. Read commences his “Memoir of Thomas Hogg,” by saying--“On Sunday\r\nthe ninth of January 1820, as I was proceeding in the services of the\r\nday, my attention was attracted by a wretched object seated in the nave\r\nof the church. There was an air of devout seriousness about him, under\r\nall the disadvantages of tattered garments and squalid appearance, which\r\nafforded a favourable presentiment to my mind. When the service was over\r\nthe stranger disappeared.”\r\n\r\nMr. Read conceived that he was some poor passing beggar, who had been\r\nallured by the fire in the stove, but to his surprise on the following\r\nSunday the same object presented himself, and took his station, as\r\nbefore, near the stove. He seemed to be a man decrepit with age: his\r\nhead resting upon his bosom, which was partly exposed, betokened\r\nconsiderable infirmity. Under a coarse and dirty sackcloth frock was to\r\nbe seen a soldier’s coat patched in various places, which was strangely\r\ncontrasted with the cleanliness of his shirt. His whole appearance was\r\nthat of the lowest degree of poverty. His devout attention induced Mr.\r\nRead when the service was concluded to inquire who this old man was.\r\n“Sir,” replied his informant, “he is a person who works at the\r\nblacksmith’s shop; he is a remarkable man, and carries about with him a\r\nbible, which he constantly reads.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the week Mr. Read paid him a visit. He found him\r\nstanding by the side of the forge, putting some links of iron-wire\r\ntogether, to form a chain to suspend scissors. The impressions of\r\nwretchedness excited by his first appearance were greatly heightened by\r\nthe soot, which, from the nature of his occupation, had necessarily\r\ngathered round his person; and after a few general observations Mr. Read\r\nwent to Mr. H. S., the master of the shop, who informed him that on\r\nTuesday the fourth of January, in the severely cold weather which then\r\nprevailed, this destitute object came to his shop, almost exhausted with\r\ncold and fatigue. In his passage through the neighbouring village of\r\nP----, he had been inhumanly pelted with snow-balls by a party of boys,\r\nand might probably have perished, but for the humanity of some\r\nrespectable inhabitants of the place, who rescued him from their hands.\r\nHaving reached Mr. S.’s shop, he requested permission to erect, in a\r\nshed which adjoined the shop, his little apparatus, consisting of a\r\nslight table, with a box containing his tools. The benevolent master of\r\nthe premises kindly stationed him near the forge, where he might pursue\r\nhis work with advantage. In the evening, when the workmen were about to\r\nretire, Mr. S. asked him where he intended to lodge that night. The old\r\nman inquired if there were any ox-stall or stable near at hand, which he\r\nmight be permitted to occupy. His benefactor offered his stable, and the\r\npoor creature, with his box and table upon his back, accompanied Mr. S.\r\nhome, where as comfortable a bed as fresh straw, and shelter from the\r\ninclemency of the weather, could afford, was made up. One of Mr. S.’s\r\nchildren afterwards carried him some warm cider, which he accepted with\r\nreluctance, expressing his fears lest he should be depriving some part\r\nof the family of it.\r\n\r\nThe weather was very cold: the thermometer, during the past night, had\r\nbeen as low as six or seven degrees of Fahrenheit. In the morning he\r\nresumed his post by the side of the forge. Mr. S. allowed him to retain\r\nhis station as long as he needed it; and contracted so great a regard\r\nfor him, as to declare, that he never learned so complete a lesson of\r\nhumility, contentment, and gratitude, as from the conduct of this man.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow’s days continued to be passed much in the manner above\r\ndescribed; but he had exchanged the stable, at night, for the shop,\r\nwhich was warmer, as soon as his benevolent host was satisfied\r\nrespecting his principles; and with exemplary diligence he pursued his\r\nhumble employment of making chains and skewers. He usually dined on hot\r\npotatoes, or bread and cheese, with occasionally half a pint of beer. If\r\nsolicited to take additional refreshment, he would decline it, saying,\r\n“I am thankful for the kindness,--but it would be _intemperate_.”\r\n\r\nAt an early hour in the afternoon of the first Saturday which he spent\r\nin this village, he put by his work, and began to hum a hymn tune. Mr.\r\nS. asked him if he could sing. “No, sir,” he replied. “I thought,” added\r\nMr. S., “I heard you singing.” “I was only composing my thoughts a\r\nlittle,” said the poor man, “for the sabbath.”\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Read being informed of these particulars, he was induced to\r\nreturn to the stranger with a view to converse with him. He says “There\r\nwas a peculiar bluntness in his manner of expressing himself, but it was\r\nvery far removed from any thing of churlishness or incivility. All his\r\nanswers were pertinent, and were sometimes given in such measured terms\r\nas quite astonished me. The following was a part of our\r\nconversation.--‘Well, my friend, what are you about?’ ‘Making\r\nscissor-chains, sir.’ ‘And how long does it take you to make one?’ With\r\npeculiar archness he looked up in my face, (for his head always rested\r\nupon his bosom, so that the back part of it was depressed nearly to the\r\nsame horizontal plane with his shoulders,) and with a complacent smile,\r\nsaid, ‘Ah! and you will next ask me how many I make in a day; and then\r\nwhat the wire costs me; and afterwards what I sell them for.’ From the\r\nindirectness of his reply, I was induced to conclude that he was in the\r\nhabit of making something considerable from his employment, and wished\r\nto conceal the amount of his gains.” It appeared, however, that he was\r\nunable, even with success in disposing of his wares, to earn more than\r\nsixpence or sevenpence a day, and that his apparent reluctance to make\r\nknown his poverty proceeded from habitual contentment.\r\n\r\nMr. Read asked him, why he followed a vagrant life, in preference to a\r\nstationary one, in which he would be better known, and more respected?\r\n“The nature of my business,” he replied, “requires that I should move\r\nabout from place to place, that, having exhausted my custom in one spot,\r\nI may obtain employment in another. Besides,” added he, “my mode of life\r\nhas at least this advantage, that if I leave my friends behind me, I\r\nleave also my enemies.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked his age, he replied, with a strong and firm voice, “That is a\r\nquestion which I am frequently asked, as if persons supposed me to be a\r\ngreat age: why, I am a mere boy.”\r\n\r\n“A mere boy!” repeated Mr. Read; “and pray what do you mean by that\r\nexpression?”--“I am sixty-five years of age, sir; and with a light heel\r\nand a cheerful heart, hope to hold out a considerable time longer.” In\r\nthe course of the conversation, he said, “It is not often that I am\r\nhonoured with the visits of clergymen. Two gentlemen, however, of your\r\nprofession once came to me when I was at ----, in ----, and I expressed\r\na hope that I should derive some advantage from their conversation. ‘We\r\nare come,’ said they, ‘with the same expectation to you, for we\r\nunderstand that you know many things.’ I told them that I feared they\r\nwould be greatly disappointed.” He then stated that the old scholastic\r\nquestion was proposed to him, “Why has God given us two ears and one\r\nmouth?” “I replied,” said he, “that we may hear twice as much as we\r\nspeak;” adding, with his accustomed modesty, “I should not have been\r\nable to have given an answer to this question if I had not heard it\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nBefore they parted, Mr. Read lamented the differences that existed\r\nbetween persons of various religious persuasions. The old man rejoined\r\nin a sprightly tone, “No matter; there are two sides to the river.” His\r\nreadiness in reply was remarkable. Whatever he said implied contentment,\r\ncheerfulness, and genuine piety. Before Mr. Read took leave of him, he\r\ninquired how long he intended to remain in the village. He answered, “I\r\ndo not know; but as I have house-room and fire without any tax, I am\r\nquite satisfied with my situation, and only regret the trouble I am\r\noccasioning to my kind host.”\r\n\r\nUntil the twentieth of the month Mr. Read saw but little of him. On the\r\nmorning of that day he met him creeping along under a vast burden; for\r\non the preceding Monday he had set out on a journey to Bristol, to\r\nprocure a fresh stock of wire, and with half a hundred weight of wire\r\nupon his back, and three halfpence in his pocket, the sole remains of\r\nhis scanty fund, he was now returning on foot, after having passed two\r\ndays on the road, and the intervening night before a coal-pit fire in a\r\nneighbouring village. The snow was deep upon the ground, and the scene\r\nindescribably desolate. Mr. Read was glad to see him, and inquired if he\r\nwere not very tired. “A little, a little,” he replied, and taking off\r\nhis hat, he asked if he could execute any thing for me. An order for\r\nsome trifling articles, brought him to Mr. Read on the following\r\nWednesday, who entered into conversation with him, and says, “he\r\nrepeated many admirable adages, with which his memory appeared to be\r\nwell stored, and incidentally touched on the word _cleanliness_.\r\nImmediately I added, ‘cleanliness is next to godliness;’ and seized the\r\nopportunity which I had long wanted, but from fear of wounding his mind\r\nhesitated to embrace, to tell him of the absence of that quality in\r\nhimself. He with much good nature replied, ‘I believe I am\r\n_substantially_ clean. I have a clean shirt every week: my business,\r\nhowever, necessarily makes me dirty in my person.’ ‘But why do you not\r\ndress more tidily, and take more care of yourself? You know that God\r\nhath given us the comforts of life that we may enjoy them. Cannot you\r\nafford yourself these comforts?’ ‘That question,’ said he emphatically,\r\nbut by no means rudely, ‘you should have set out with. No, sir, I cannot\r\nafford myself these comforts.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Read perceiving his instep to be inflamed, and that he had a\r\nmiserable pair of shoes, pressed a pair of his own upon him.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he visited him, and found him working upon his\r\nchains while sitting,--a posture in which he did not often indulge. Mr.\r\nRead looked at his foot, and found the whole leg prodigiously swollen\r\nand discoloured. It had inflamed and mortified from fatigue of walking\r\nand inclemency of the weather during the journey to Bristol. Mr. Read\r\ninsisted on his having medical assistance. “The doctor is expected in\r\nthe village to-day, and you _must_ see him: I will give orders for him\r\nto call in upon you.” “That is kind, _very_ kind,” he replied. At this\r\nmoment an ignorant talker in the shop exclaimed in a vexatious and\r\noffensive manner, that he would not have such a leg (taking off his hat)\r\n“for _that_, full of guineas.” The old man looked up somewhat sharply at\r\nhim, and said, “nor I, if I could help it.” The other, however,\r\nproceeded with his ranting. The afflicted man added, “You only torture\r\nme by your observations.” This was the only instance approaching to\r\nimpatience he manifested.\r\n\r\nIt appears that of late he had slept in one corner of the workshop, upon\r\nthe bare earth, without his clothes, and with the only blanket he had,\r\nwrapped round his shoulders. It was designed to procure him a bed in a\r\nbetter abode; but he preferred remaining where he was, and only\r\nrequested some clean straw. He seemed fixed to his purpose; every thing\r\nwas arranged, as well as could be, for his accommodation.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Mr. Read found the swelling and blackness\r\nextending themselves rapidly towards the vital parts. The poor fellow\r\nwas at times delirious, and convulsed; but he dozed during the greater\r\npart of the day. It was perceived from an involuntary gesture of the\r\nmedical gentleman on his entrance, that he had not before witnessed many\r\nsuch objects. He declared there was but little hope of life. Warm\r\nfomentations, and large doses of bark and port wine were administered. A\r\nbed was provided in a neighbouring house, and Mr. Read informed the\r\npatient of his wish to remove him to it, and his anxiety that he should\r\ntake the medicines prescribed. He submitted to every thing proposed, and\r\nadded, “One night more, and I shall be beyond the clouds.”\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday his speech was almost unintelligible, the delirium\r\nbecame more frequent, and his hands were often apparently employed in\r\nthe task to which they had been so long habituated, making links for\r\nchains; his respiration became more and more hurried; and Mr. Read\r\nordered that he should be allowed to remain quite quiet upon his bed. At\r\ncertain intervals his mind seemed collected, and Mr. R. soothed him by\r\nkind attentions. He said, “There are your spectacles; but I do not think\r\nthey have brought your bible? I dare say you would like to read it?”\r\n“By-and-by,” he replied: “I am pretty well acquainted with its\r\ncontents.” He articulated indistinctly, appeared exhausted, and on\r\nSunday morning his death-knell was rung from the steeple. He died about\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning without a sigh. His last word was, in answer\r\nto the question, how are you?--“Happy.”\r\n\r\nA letter from a gentleman of Jedburgh, to the publishers of Mr. Read’s\r\ntract, contains the following further particulars respecting this humble\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt school he seldom associated with those of his own age, and rarely\r\ntook part in those games which are so attractive to the generality of\r\nyouth, and which cannot be condemned in their own place. His declining\r\nthe society of his schoolfellows did not seem to arise from a sour and\r\nunsocial temper, nor from a quarrelsome disposition on his part, but\r\nfrom a love of solitude, and from his finding more satisfaction in the\r\nresources of his own mind, than in all the noise and tumult of the most\r\nfascinating amusements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was, from his youth, noted for making shrewd and sometimes witty\r\nremarks, which indicated no ordinary cast of mind; and in many instances\r\nshowed a sagacity and discrimination which could not be expected from\r\nhis years. He was, according to the expressive language of his\r\ncontemporaries, an “auld farrend” boy. He began at an early period to\r\nmake scissor-chains, more for amusement than for profit, and without\r\never dreaming that to this humble occupation he was to be indebted for\r\nsubsistence in the end of his days. When no more than nine or ten years\r\nof age, he betook himself to the selling of toys and some cheap articles\r\nof hardware; and gave reason to hope, from his shrewd, cautious, and\r\neconomical character, that he would gradually increase his stock of\r\ngoods, and rise to affluence in the world. His early acquaintances,\r\nconsidering these things, cannot account for the extreme poverty in\r\nwhich he was found at the time of his death. He appears to have been\r\nalways inattentive to his external dress, which, at times, was ragged\r\nenough; but was remarkable for attention to his linen--his shirts,\r\nhowever coarse, were always clean. This was his general character in the\r\ndays of his youth. On his last visit to Jedburgh, twenty-nine years\r\nbefore his death, he came with his clothes in a most wretched condition.\r\nHis sisters, two very excellent women, feeling for their brother, and\r\nconcerned for their own credit, got a suit of clothes made without\r\ndelay. Dressed in this manner, he continued in the place for some time,\r\nvisiting old acquaintances, and enjoying the society of his friends. He\r\nleft Jedburgh soon after; and, from that time, his sisters heard no more\r\nof their brother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHogg’s father was not a native of Jedburgh. Those with whom I have\r\nconversed seem to think that he came from the neighbourhood of Selkirk,\r\nand was closely connected with the progenitor of the _Ettrick Shepherd_.\r\nHe, properly speaking, had no trade; at least did not practise any: he\r\nused to travel through the country with a pack containing some hardware\r\ngoods, and at one time kept a small shop in Jedburgh. All accounts agree\r\nthat the father had, if not a talent for poetry, at least a talent for\r\nrhyming.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe appears to have had a most excellent mother, whom he regularly\r\naccompanied to their usual place of public worship, and to whom he was\r\nindebted for many pious and profitable instructions, which seem to have\r\nbeen of signal service to her son when she herself was numbered with the\r\ndead and mouldering in the dust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the time of his continuance in Jedburgh and its vicinity, he\r\nevinced a becoming regard to the external duties of religion; but\r\nnothing of that sublime devotion which cheered the evening of his days,\r\nand which caused such astonishing contentment in the midst of manifold\r\nprivations. My own belief is, from all the circumstances of the case,\r\nthat the pious efforts of his worthy mother did not succeed in the first\r\ninstance, but were blessed for his benefit at an advanced period of\r\nlife. The extreme poverty to which he was reduced, and the corporal\r\nailments under which he had laboured for a long time, were like breaking\r\nup the fallow ground, and causing the seed which had been sown to\r\nvegetate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must here part from “the Scottish Wanderer.” Some, perhaps, may think\r\nhe might have been dismissed before--“for what was he?” He was not\r\nrenowned, for he was neither warrior nor statesman, but to be guileless\r\nand harmless is to be happier than the ruler of the turbulent, and more\r\nhonourable than the leader of an army. If his life was not illustrious,\r\nit was wise; for he could not have been seen, and sojourned in the\r\nhamlets of labour and ignorance, without exciting regard and\r\ncommunicating instruction. He might have been ridiculed or despised on\r\nhis first appearance, but where he remained he taught by the pithy truth\r\nof his sayings, and the rectitude of his conduct: if the peripatetic\r\nphilosophers of antiquity did so much, they did no more. Few among those\r\nwho, in later times, have been reputed wise, were teachers of practical\r\nwisdom: the wisdom of the rest was surpassed by “Cheap Tommy’s.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·07.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 12.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA VICIOUS SWAN.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1731, “an odd accident happened in Bushy-park to one of the\r\nhelpers in the king’s stables, riding his majesty’s own hunting horse,\r\nwho was frighted by a swan flying at him out of the canal, which caused\r\nhim to run away, and dash out his brains against the iron gates; the man\r\nwas thrown on the iron spikes, which only entering his clothes did him\r\nno hurt. Some time before, the same swan is said to have flown at his\r\nhighness the duke, but caused no disaster.”[253]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis, which is noticed by a pleasant story in column 914 as the\r\n“swan-hopping season,” is a time of enjoyment with all who are fond of\r\naquatic pleasures. On fine days, and especially since the invention of\r\nsteam-boats, crowds of citizens and suburbans of London glide along the\r\nThames to different places of entertainment on its banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL EXCURSION TO TWICKENHAM.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--As it is the object of the _Every-Day Book_ to preserve a faithful\r\nportraiture of the prominent features and amusements of the age, as well\r\nas the customs of the “olden time,” I subjoin for insertion a brief\r\naccount of an unobtruding society for the relief of the distressed;\r\nwith the sincere hope that its laudable endeavours may be followed by\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nA number of respectable tradesmen, who meet to pass a few social hours\r\nat the house of Mr. Cross, Bethnal-green, impressed by the distresses of\r\nthe thickly-populated district in which they reside, resolved to lay\r\nthemselves and friends under a small weekly contribution, to allay, as\r\nfar as possible, the wretchedness of their poorer neighbours. They feel\r\nmuch gratification in knowing that in the course of two years their\r\nexertions have alleviated the sorrows of many indigent families. Nearly\r\nfour hundred friends have come forward as subscribers to assist them in\r\ntheir praise-worthy undertaking; yet such is the misery by which they\r\nare surrounded--such are the imperative demands on their bounty, that\r\ntheir little fund is continually impoverished.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of their benevolent views they projected an annual\r\nexcursion to Twickenham, sometime in the month of July; the profits from\r\nthe tickets to be devoted to the _Friend-in-Need Society_. I have joined\r\nthem in this agreeable trip, and regard the day as one of the happiest\r\nin my existence. A few gentlemen acted as a committee, and to their\r\njudicious arrangements much of the pleasure of the day is due. The\r\nmorning was particularly favourable: at eight o’clock the “Diana”\r\nsteam-packet left her moorings off Southwark-bridge, and bore away up\r\nthe river with her long smoky pendant; a good band of music enlivened\r\nthe scene by popular airs, not forgetting the eternal “Jagher chorus.” I\r\narrived on board just at starting, and having passed the usual “how d’ye\r\ndoes,” seated myself to observe the happy circle. They appeared to have\r\nleft “old care” behind them; the laugh and joke resounded from side to\r\nside, and happiness dwelt in every countenance. There was no unnecessary\r\netiquette; all were neighbours and all intimate. As soon as we began to\r\nget clear of London, the beautiful scenery formed a delightful panoramic\r\nview. Battersea, Wandsworth, Putney, Kew, and Richmond, arose in\r\nsuccession; when, after staying a short time at the latter place to\r\nallow those who were disposed to land, we proceeded on to Twickenham\r\nAite, an island delightfully situated in the middle of the Thames, where\r\nwe arrived about twelve o’clock. Preparation had been made for our\r\nreception: the boat hauled up alongside the island for the better\r\nlanding; tents were erected on the lawn; a spacious and well-stocked\r\nfruit-garden was thrown open for our pleasure; and plenty of good cheer\r\nprovided by “mine host” of the “Eel-pie house.” On each side of the lawn\r\nmight be seen different parties doing ample justice to “ham sandwiches,\r\nand bottled cider.” After the repast, the “elder” gentlemen formed into\r\na convivial party; the “report of the society” was read; and,\r\nafterwards, the song and glee went merrily round; while the younger\r\nformed themselves in array for a country-dance, and nimbly footed to the\r\nsound of sweet music “under the greenwood tree:” the more juvenile felt\r\nequal delight at “kiss-in-the-ring,” on the grass-plat.\r\n\r\nHe must have been a stoic indeed who could have viewed this scene\r\nwithout feelings of delight, heightened as it was by the smiles of\r\nloveliness. These sports were maintained until time called for our\r\ndeparture; when having re-embarked, the vessel glided heavily back, as\r\nif reluctant to break off such happy hours. The dance was again renewed\r\non board--the same hearty laugh was again heard; there was the same\r\nexuberance of spirits in the juniors; no one was tired, and all seemed\r\nto regret the quickly approaching separation. About nine o’clock we\r\nsafely landed from the boat at Queenhithe stairs, and after a parting\r\n“farewell,” each pursued the way home, highly delighted with the\r\nexcursion of the day, enhanced as it was by the reflection, that in the\r\npursuit of pleasure we had assisted the purposes of charity.\r\n\r\n  J. H. C.\r\n\r\n  _Kingsland-road, July, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAN-HOPPING.\r\n\r\nIt appears that formerly--“When the citizens, in gaily-decorated barges,\r\nwent up the river annually in August, to mark and count their swans,\r\nwhich is called swan-hopping, they used to land at Barn Elms, and, after\r\npartaking of a cold collation on the grass, they merrily danced away a\r\nfew hours. This was a gala-day for the village; and happy was the lad or\r\nlass admitted into the party of the fine folks of London. This practice\r\nhas, however, been long discontinued.”[254]\r\n\r\n\r\n“SWAN-HOPPING”--_Explained_.\r\n\r\nThe yearly visit of members of the corporation of London to the swans on\r\nits noble river, is commonly termed “Swan-_hop_ping.” This name is a\r\nvulgar and long used corruption of “Swan-_up_ping,” signifying the\r\nduties of the official visiters, which was to “take _up_” the swans and\r\nmark them. The ancient and real term may be gathered from the old laws\r\nconcerning swans, to have been technically and properly used. They were\r\nmanorial and royal birds; and in proof of their estimation in former\r\ntimes, a rare and valuable quarto tract of four leaves, printed in 1570,\r\nmay be referred to. It mentions the “_vpping_ daies;” declares what\r\npersons shall “_vp_ no swannes;” and speaks of a court no longer\r\npopularly known, namely, “the king’s majesties justices of sessions of\r\nswans.” This curious tract is here reprinted verbatim, viz:--\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n\r\n  ~Order for Swannes~\r\n\r\n  both by\r\n\r\n  THE STATUTES, AND BY THE AUNCIENT ORDERS AND CUSTOMES, USED WITHIN THE\r\n  REALME OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER FOR SWANNES.\r\n\r\n  First, Ye shall enquire if there be any person that doth possesse any\r\n  Swanne, and hath not compounded with the Kings Maiesty for his Marke\r\n  (that is to say) six shillings eight pence, for his Marke during his\r\n  life: If you know any such you shall present them, that all such Swans\r\n  and Cignets, may be seazed to the King.\r\n\r\n  2.

Lastly, If there be any other misdemeanour, or offence committed\r\n  or done by the owner of any Game, Swan-herd, or other person\r\n  whatsoeuer, contrary to any law, ancient custome, or vsage heretofore\r\n  vsed and allowed, and not before herein particularly mentioned or\r\n  expressed, you shal present the same offence, that reformation may be\r\n  had, and the offendors punished, according to the quantitie and\r\n  qualitie of the seuerall offences.\r\n\r\n  FINIS.\r\n\r\n  _God Saue the King._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that “the Order for Swannes” fairly illustrates the\r\norigin of the term “swan _hop_ping;” perhaps the “order” itself will be\r\nregarded by some of the readers of the _Every-Day Book_ as “a singular\r\nrarity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“SWAN WITH TWO NECKS,”\r\n\r\n_Lad-lane_.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the “Swan with two necks,” at one of our old city inns, from\r\nwhence there are “passengers and parcels booked” to all parts of the\r\nkingdom, is manifestly a corruption. As every swan belonging to the king\r\nwas marked, according to the swan laws, with two _nicks_ or notches; so\r\nthe old sign of this inn was the royal bird so marked, that is to say,\r\n“the swan with two _nicks_.” In process of time the “two n_i_cks” were\r\ncalled “two n_e_cks;” an ignorant landlord hoisted the foul\r\nmisrepresentation; and, at the present day, “the swan with two n_i_cks”\r\nis commonly called or known by “the name or sign” of “the swan with two\r\nn_e_cks.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A Southern Tourist,” in the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” for 1793, giving an\r\naccount of his summer rambles, which he calls “A naturalist’s stray in\r\nthe sultry days of July,” relates that he “put up for the night at the\r\nBush-inn, by Staines-bridge,” and describes his sojournment there with\r\nsuch mention of the swans as seems fitting to extract.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_The Swan at Staines._”\r\n\r\n“This inn is beautifully situated: a translucent arm of the Thames runs\r\nclose under the windows of the eating-rooms, laving the drooping\r\nstreamers of the Babylonian willows that decorate the garden, and which\r\nhalf conceal the small bridge leading into it. In these windows we spent\r\nthe evening in angling gudgeons for our supper, and in admiring a\r\ncompany of swans that were preening themselves near an aite in the\r\nriver. The number of these birds on the Thames is very considerable, all\r\nswimming between Marlow and London, being protected by the dyers and\r\nvintner’s companies, whose properties they are. These companies annually\r\nsend to Marlow six wherries, manned by persons authorized to count and\r\nto mark the swans, who are hence denominated swan-hoppers. The task\r\nassigned them is rather difficult to perform; for, the swans being\r\nexceeding strong, scuffling with them amongst the tangles of the river\r\nis rather dangerous, and recourse is obliged to be had to certain strong\r\ncrooks, shaped like those we suppose the Arcadian shepherds to have\r\nused.”\r\n\r\nThe swan is a royal bird, and often figured in the princely pleasures of\r\nformer kings of England.\r\n\r\nIn Edward the fourth’s time none was permitted to keep swans, who\r\npossessed not a freehold of at least five marks yearly value, except the\r\nking’s son: and by an act of Henry the Seventh, persons convicted of\r\ntaking their eggs were liable to a year’s imprisonment, and a fine at\r\nthe will of the sovereign.[255]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMore anciently, if a swan was stolen in an open and common river, the\r\nsame swan or another, according to old usage, was to be hanged in a\r\nhouse by the beak, and he who stole it was compelled to give the owner\r\nas much corn as would cover the swan, by putting and turning the corn\r\nupon the head of the swan, until the head of the swan was covered with\r\ncorn.[256]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the hard winter of 1726, a swan was killed “at Emsworth, between\r\nChichester and Portsmouth, lying on a creek of the sea, that had a ring\r\nround its neck, with the king of Denmark’s arms on it.”[257]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor indications of the weather, by the flight of the swans on the\r\nThames, see vol. i. col. 505.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned by the literary lord Northampton, as formerly “a paradox\r\nof simple men to thinke that a swanne cannot hatch without a cracke of\r\nthunder.”[258]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWAN’S DEATH SONG.\r\n\r\nThe car of Juno is fabled to have been drawn by swans. They were\r\ndedicated to Venus and Apollo. To the latter, according to Banier,\r\nbecause they were “reckoned to have by instinct a faculty of\r\nprediction;” but it is possible that they were consecrated to the deity\r\nof music, from their fabled melody at the moment of death.\r\n\r\nBuffon says, the ordinary voice of the tame swan is rather low than\r\ncanorous. It is a sort of creaking, exactly like what is vulgarly called\r\nthe swearing of a cat, and which the ancients denoted by the imitative\r\nword _drensare_. It would seem to be an accent of menace or anger; nor\r\ndoes its love appear to have a softer. In the “Mémoires de l’Académie\r\ndes Inscriptions” is a dissertation by M. Morin, entitled, “Why swans,\r\nwhich sung so well formerly, sing so ill now.”\r\n\r\nThe French naturalist further remarks, that “swans, almost mute, like\r\nours in the domestic state, could not be those melodious birds which the\r\nancients have celebrated and extolled. But the wild swan appears to have\r\nbetter preserved its prerogatives; and with the sentiment of entire\r\nliberty, it has also the tones. The bursts of its voice form a sort of\r\nmodulated song.” He then cites the observations of the abbé Arnaud on\r\nthe song of two wild swans which settled on the magnificent pools of\r\nChantilly. “One can hardly say that the swans of Chantilly sing, they\r\ncry; but their cries are truly and constantly modulated; their voice is\r\nnot sweet; on the contrary, it is shrill, piercing, and rather\r\ndisagreeable; I could compare it to nothing better than the sound of a\r\nclarionet, winded by a person unacquainted with the instrument. Almost\r\nall the melodious birds answer to the song of man, and especially to the\r\nsound of instruments: I played long on the violin beside our swans, on\r\nall the tones and chords. I even struck unison to their own accents,\r\nwithout their seeming to pay the smallest attention: but if a goose be\r\nthrown into the basin where they swim with their young, the male, after\r\nemitting some hollow sounds, rushes impetuously upon the goose, and\r\nseizing it by the neck, plunges the head repeatedly under water,\r\nstriking it at the same time with his wings; it would be all over with\r\nthe goose, if it were not rescued. The swan, with his wings expanded,\r\nhis neck stretched, and his head erect, comes to place himself opposite\r\nto his female, and utters a cry, to which the female replies by another,\r\nwhich is lower by half a tone. The voice of the male passes from A\r\n(_la_) to B flat (_si bémol_); that of the female, from G sharp (_sol\r\ndièse_) to A. The first note is short and transient, and has the effect\r\nof that which our musicians call _sensible_; so that it is not detached\r\nfrom the second, but seems to _slip_ into it. Fortunately for the ear,\r\nthey do not both sing at once; in fact, if while the male sounded B\r\nflat, the female struck A, or if the male uttered A, while the female\r\ngave G sharp, there would result the harshest and most insupportable of\r\ndiscords. We may add, that this dialogue is subjected to a constant and\r\nregular rhythm, with the measure of two times.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Grouvelle observes, that “there is a season when the swans assemble\r\ntogether, and form a sort of commonwealth; it is during severe colds.\r\nWhen the frost threatens to usurp their domain, they congregate and dash\r\nthe water with all the extent of their wings, making a noise which is\r\nheard very far, and which, whether in the night or the day, is louder in\r\nproportion as it freezes more intensely. Their efforts are so effectual,\r\nthat there are few instances of a flock of swans having quitted the\r\nwater in the longest frosts, though a single swan, which has strayed\r\nfrom the general body, has sometimes been arrested by the ice in the\r\nmiddle of the canals.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuffon further remarks, that the shrill and scarcely diversified notes\r\nof the loud clarion sounds, differ widely from the tender melody, the\r\nsweet and brilliant variety of our chanting birds. Yet it was not enough\r\nthat the swan sung admirably, the ancients ascribed to it a prophetic\r\nspirit. It alone, of animated beings, which all shudder at the prospect\r\nof destruction, chanted in the moment of its agony, and with harmonious\r\nsounds prepared to breathe the last sigh. They said that when about to\r\nexpire, and to bid a sad and tender adieu to life, the swan poured forth\r\nsweet and affecting accents, which, like a gentle and doleful murmur,\r\nwith a voice low, plaintive, and melancholy, formed its funeral song.\r\nThis tearful music was heard at the dawn of day, when the winds and the\r\nwaves were still: and they have been seen expiring with the notes of\r\ntheir dying hymn. No fiction of natural history, no fable of antiquity,\r\nwas ever more celebrated, oftener repeated, or better received. It\r\noccupied the soft and lively imaginations of the Greeks: poets, orators,\r\neven philosophers adopted it as a truth too pleasing to be doubted. And\r\nwell may we excuse such fables; they were amiable and affecting; they\r\nwere worth many dull, insipid truths; they were sweet emblems to feeling\r\nminds. The swan, doubtless, chants not its approaching end; but, in\r\nspeaking of the last flight, the expiring effort of a fine genius, we\r\nshall ever, with tender melancholy, recal the classical and pathetic\r\nexpression, “_It is the song of the swan!_”\r\n\r\nShakspeare nobly likens our island to the eyrie of the royal bird:--\r\n\r\n      --------------I’ the world’s volume\r\n    Our Britain seems as of it, but not in it;\r\n    In a great pool, a swan’s nest.\r\n\r\nNor can we fail to remember his beautiful allusions to the swan’s\r\ndeath-song. Portia orders “sweet music” during Bassanio’s deliberation\r\non the caskets:--\r\n\r\n    Let music sound while he doth make his choice:\r\n    Then if he lose, he makes a swan-like end--\r\n    Fading in music.\r\n\r\nAnd after the Moor has slain his innocent bride, Æmilia exclaims while\r\nher heart is breaking, and sings--\r\n\r\n    Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,\r\n    And die in music--Willow, willow, willow.\r\n\r\nAfter “King John” is poisoned, his son, prince Henry, is told that in\r\nhis dying frenzy “he sung,”--the prince answers--\r\n\r\n    -------’Tis strange that death should sing.--\r\n    I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,\r\n    Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death;\r\n    And from the organ-pipe of frailty, sings\r\n    His soul and body to their lasting rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe muse of “Paradise” remarks, that\r\n\r\n      ---------The swan with arched neck\r\n    Between her white wings mantling, proudly rowes\r\n    Her state with oary feet: yet oft they quit\r\n    The dank, and rising on stiff pennons, tour\r\n    The mid æreal sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOpportunities for observing the flight of the wild swan are seldom, and\r\nhence it is seldom mentioned by our poets. The migrations of other\r\naquatic birds are frequent themes of their speculation.\r\n\r\nTO A WATER-FOWL.\r\n\r\n        Whither, ’midst falling dew,\r\n    While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,\r\n      Far through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue\r\n          Thy solitary way?\r\n        Vainly the fowler’s eye\r\n      Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong.\r\n        As darkly painted on the crimson sky\r\n          Thy figure floats along.\r\n\r\n        Seek’st thou the plashy brink\r\n      Of weedy lake, or maize of river wide,\r\n        Or where the rocky billows rise and sink\r\n            On the chafed ocean’s side?\r\n        There is a Power whose care\r\n      Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--\r\n        The desert and illimitable air,--\r\n          Lone wandering, but not lost.\r\n\r\n          All day thy wings have fann’d,\r\n      At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere;\r\n        Yet stoop not, weary to the welcome land,\r\n            Though the dark night is near.\r\n        And soon that toil shall end;\r\n      Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,\r\n        And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend\r\n          Soon o’er thy shelter’d nest.\r\n\r\n        Thou’rt gone, the abyss of heaven\r\n      Hath swallow’d up thy form; yet on my heart\r\n        Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,\r\n            And shall not soon depart.\r\n        He, who from zone to zone\r\n      Guides through the boundless sky the certain flight,\r\n        In the long way that I must tread alone,\r\n            Will lead my steps aright.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·02.\r\n\r\n  [253] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [254] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [255] Buffon, _note_.\r\n\r\n  [256] Cowel.\r\n\r\n  [257] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [258] Brand.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 13.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORNISH FALSTAFF.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nAnthony Payne, the Falstaff of the sixteenth century, was born in the\r\nmanor-house at Stratton, in Cornwall, where he died, and was buried in\r\nthe north aisle of Stratton church, the 13th of July, 1691. In early\r\nlife he was the humble, but favourite attendant of John, eldest son of\r\nsir Beville Granville, afterwards earl of Bath, whom he accompanied\r\nthroughout many of his loyal adventures and campaigns during the\r\nrevolution and usurpation of Cromwell. At the age of twenty he measured\r\nthe extraordinary height of seven feet two inches, with limbs and body\r\nin proportion, and strength equal to his bulk and stature. The firmness\r\nof his mind, and his uncommon activity of person, together with a large\r\nfund of sarcastic pleasantry, were well calculated to cheer the spirits\r\nof his noble patron during the many sad reverses and trying occasions\r\nwhich he experienced after the restoration. His lordship introduced\r\nPayne to Charles the Second; “the merry monarch” appointed him one of\r\nthe yeomen of his guard. This office he held during his majesty’s life;\r\nand when his lordship was made governor of the citadel of Plymouth,\r\nPayne was placed therein as a gunner. His picture used to stand in the\r\ngreat hall at Stowe, in the county of Cornwall, and is now removed to\r\nPenheale, another seat of the Granville family. At his death the floor\r\nof the apartment was taken up in order to remove his enormous remains.\r\nAs a Cornishman, in point of size, weight, and strength he has never\r\nbeen equalled.\r\n\r\nThe nearest to Anthony Payne was Charles Chillcott, of Tintagel, who\r\nmeasured six feet four inches high, round the breast six feet nine\r\ninches, and weighed four hundred and sixty pounds. He was almost\r\nconstantly occupied in smoking--three pounds of tobacco was his weekly\r\nallowance; his pipe _two inches_ long. One of his stockings would\r\ncontain six gallons of wheat. He was much pleased with the curiosity of\r\nstrangers who came to see him, and his usual address to them was, “Come\r\nunder my arm, little fellow.” He died 5th of April, 1815, in his\r\nsixtieth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ancient Cornish names of the Months._\r\n\r\nJANUARY was called _Mis_ (a corruption of the Latin word _mensis_, a\r\nmonth) _Genver_, (an ancient corruption of its common name, January,) or\r\nthe cold air month.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY, _Hu-evral_, or the whirling month.\r\n\r\nMARCH, _Mis Merh_, or the horse month; also, _Meurz_, or _Merk_, a\r\ncorruption of March.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, _Mis Ebrall_, or the primrose month; _Abrilly_, or the mackerel\r\nmonth; also _Epiell_, a corruption of its Latin appellative, _Aprilis_.\r\n\r\nMAY, _Miz Me_, or the flowery month; _Me_, being obviously a corruption\r\nof May, or _Maius_, the original Latin name.\r\n\r\nJUNE, _Miz Epham_, the summer month, or head of summer.\r\n\r\nJULY, _Miz Gorephan_, or the chief head of the summer month.\r\n\r\nAUGUST, _Miz East_, or the harvest month.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER, _Mis Guerda Gala_, or the white straw month.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER, _Miz Hedra_, or the watery month.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, _Miz Dui_, or the black month.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, _Miz Kevardin_, or in Armoric _Miz Querdu_, the month\r\nfollowing the black month, or the month also black.\r\n\r\n  SAM SAM’S SON.\r\n\r\n  _June 21, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·55.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 14.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1766, the Grand Junction Canal, connecting the\r\nIrish sea to the British ocean, was commenced by Mr. Brindley.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nFrom the destruction of the Bastille this day in the year 1789,[259] the\r\ncommencement of the French revolution is dated.\r\n\r\nMiss Plumptre mentions a singular allegorical picture in the _Hotel de\r\nVille_, or Guildhall, of the city of Aix. It represented the three\r\norders of the state--the nobles, the clergy, and the _tiers-état_--in\r\ntheir relative situations before the revolution. In the middle is a\r\npeasant, with the implements of his profession about him, the scythe,\r\nthe reaping-hook, the _pioche_, which is a sort of pick-axe used in\r\nProvence to turn up the ground in steep parts where a plough cannot be\r\nused, a spade, a vessel for wine, &c. On his shoulders he supports a\r\nheavy burden, intended to represent the state itself; while on one side\r\nof him is a noble, and on the other an ecclesiastic, in the costume of\r\ntheir respective orders, who just touch the burden with one hand, while\r\nhe supports it with his whole strength, and is bowed down by it. The\r\nintention of the allegory is to show, that it is on the peasantry, or\r\n_tiers-état_, that the great burden of the state presses, while the\r\nnobles and clergy are scarcely touched by it. Above the burden, which is\r\nin the form of a heart, is the motto, _nihil aliud in nobis_, “There is\r\nnothing else in our power.” From the costume of the figures, which is\r\nthat of the sixteenth century, it is conjectured that the picture was of\r\nthat date; but no tradition is preserved of the time when, or the person\r\nby whom it was executed.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable painting hung in the guard-room, on one side of the door\r\nof the room where the consuls of Aix held their meetings for the\r\nsettling the impositions of the rates and taxes; a room which was\r\nconsequently in theory the sanctuary of _equity_, the place where to\r\neach member of the community was allotted the respective proportion\r\nwhich in justice was demanded of him for supporting the general good of\r\nthe whole. “This,” says Miss Plumptre, “was a very fine piece of satire,\r\nand it is only surprising that it should have been suffered to hang\r\nthere: it probably had occupied the place so long, that it had ceased\r\nfrom time immemorial to excite attention; but it shows that even two\r\ncenturies before the revolution there were those who entertained the\r\nopinions which led finally to this tremendous explosion, and that these\r\nopinions did not then first start into existence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE JACOBIN CLUB.\r\n\r\nThe Brétons were even from the commencement of the revolution among the\r\nmost eager in the popular cause, and the original republican party arose\r\namong them. Bailly, the first president of the national constituent\r\nassembly, and afterwards the celebrated mayor of Paris, mentions, in a\r\nposthumous work, that an association was formed at Versailles as early\r\nas in June, 1789, even before the taking of the Bastille, of the\r\ndeputies of _Brétagne_ to the _tiers-état_, which was known by the name\r\nof the _comité_ Bréton; and he goes on to say:--“This may be called the\r\noriginal of the society afterwards so celebrated as the _Jacobin Club_,\r\nand was disapproved by all who did not belong to it. The Brétons were\r\ncertainly excellent patriots, but ardent, vehement, and not much given\r\nto reflection; nor have I any doubt but that the first idea of\r\nestablishing a republic was engendered by the overstrained notions of\r\nliberty cherished in this club. To them, consequently, must be imputed\r\nthe origin of those fatal divisions which afterwards arose between the\r\nadherents of a limited monarchy, and those who would not be satisfied\r\nwith any thing short of a republic;--divisions which occasioned so many\r\nand so great misfortunes to the whole country.”\r\n\r\nThis province was, in the sequel, reputed to be one of the parts of\r\nFrance the most attached to the Bourbon interest, because the arbitrary\r\nproceedings of the convention had afforded a handle for another set of\r\nanarchists to rise in opposition to them. In this conflict it would be\r\ndifficult to determine on which side the greatest want of conduct was\r\nshown,--which party was guilty of the greatest errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS OF BRITTANY.\r\n\r\nLike the people of Wales, who boast that their ancestors were never\r\nconquered by the Saxons, the Brétons affirm that their country alone, of\r\nall the provinces of Gaul, was never bowed to the Frankish yoke; and\r\nthat they are the true descendants of the ancient Armoricans, its first\r\nknown inhabitants. They allow the Welsh to be of the same stock as\r\nthemselves, and are proud of affinity with a people who, like\r\nthemselves, firmly and effectually resisted a foreign yoke; but they\r\nclaim precedence in point of antiquity, and consider themselves as the\r\nparent stock from which Britain was afterwards peopled. Indeed from the\r\ngreat resemblance between the Brétons and the Welsh, a strong argument\r\nmay be drawn to conclude that they had a common origin. As Wales is to\r\nEngland the great repository of its ancient superstitions, so is\r\nBrittany to France. Here was the prime seat of the Druidical mysteries,\r\nnor were they banished till the conversion of the country to\r\nChristianity. In the southern provinces, when Woden and Thor ceded their\r\nplaces to Apollo and Diana, the gods of Roma Antica were installed in\r\ntheir seats, till they in their turn were displaced by the legions of\r\nthe papal hierarchy: but the deities established in Brittany by the\r\nCelto-Scythian inhabitants maintained their ground till they were\r\noverpowered by the army of popish saints, whose numbers so far exceeded\r\nthe Celtic deities, that it was impossible to resist the invasion. Yet\r\nif the ancient deities were conquered, and honoured no longer under\r\ntheir original names, their influence remained. The wonders attributed\r\nto them were not forgotten. Their remembrance was still cherished, their\r\nmiracles were transferred to another set of champions, and the Thors and\r\nWodens were revived under the names of St. Pol, St. Ferrier, &c.\r\n\r\nThe old religion of the Druids secured unbounded authority over the\r\nminds of the people. This engine was too powerful to be lightly\r\nrelinquished; and the papacy instead of directing them to the sublime\r\ncontemplation of one all-powerful, all-commanding governor of the\r\nuniverse, through whom alone all live and move and have their being,\r\ntransferred to new names the ancient reveries of a supernatural agency\r\nperpetually interposing in all the petty affairs of mankind. The\r\noperators in this agency, genii, fairies, dæmons, and wizards, were all\r\ncomprehended under the one denomination of saints. Enchanters and\r\ndragons were exchanged for pious solitaries and wonderful ascetics, who\r\ncalmed tempests with a word, walked on the waves of the ocean as on dry\r\nland, or wafted over it upon cloaks or millstones; who metamorphosed\r\ntheir staves into trees, and commanded fountains to rise under their\r\nfeet; by whom the sick were healed; whose shadows were pretended to have\r\nraised the dead; and whose approach might be perceived by the perfume\r\ntheir bodies spread throughout the air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo of the most illustrious and wonder-working saints of the country,\r\nSaint _Pol de Léon_ and Saint _Jean du Doigt_, were established at only\r\na short distance from Morlaix; the former a little to the north-west of\r\nthe town, the latter a little to the north-east. The town of St. Pol de\r\nLéon stands on the coast. From the boldness and beauty of the\r\nworkmanship of the cathedral, it was supposed that it could hardly have\r\nbeen executed by mortal hands; it would have been to the honour of the\r\nsaint to have ascribed it to him, as a notable worker of miracles, but,\r\nby the most fervent, the architecture is attributed to the devil.\r\n\r\nMiss Plumptre says, “The name of this episcopal see has become familiar\r\nin England, from its bishop having made a very conspicuous figure in his\r\nemigration hither, and having here at length ended his days. I did not\r\nfind the character of this prelate more popular among his\r\nfellow-countrymen in Brétagne, than it had been among his\r\nfellow-emigrants in London: they gave him the same character,--of one of\r\nthe most haughty, insolent, and over-bearing among the ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries in France; and while the Brétons had in general an almost\r\nsuperstitious veneration for their clergy, they regarded this bishop\r\nwith very different sentiments.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe honour of having given birth to St. Pol de Léon is ascribed to\r\nEngland about the year 490. When a boy he gave an earnest of what might\r\nin future be expected of him. The fields of the monastery in which he\r\nwas a student, were ravaged by such a number of birds, that the whole\r\ncrop of corn was in danger of being devoured. St. Pol summoned the\r\nsacrilegious animals to appear before the principal of the monastery,\r\nSt. Hydultus, that they might receive the correction they merited. The\r\nbirds, obedient to his summons, presented themselves in a body; but St.\r\nHydultus, being of a humane disposition, only gave them a reproof and\r\nadmonition, and then let them go, even giving them his benediction at\r\ntheir departure. The grateful birds never after touched the corn of the\r\nmonastery. In a convent of nuns hard by, situated on the sea-shore, and\r\nextremely exposed to the tempestuous winds of the north, lived a sister\r\nof St. Pol. She represented the case of the convent to her brother; when\r\nhe ordered the sea to retire four thousand paces from the convent; which\r\nit did immediately. He then directed his sister and her companions to\r\nrange a row of flints along the shore for a considerable distance;\r\nwhich was no sooner done than they increased into vast rocks, they so\r\nentirely broke the force of the winds, that the convent was never after\r\nincommoded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other, it does not appear what, St. Pol de Léon took\r\na fancy to travel, and walked over the sea one fine morning from England\r\nto the Isle of Batz. Immediately on landing there, by a touch of his\r\nstaff--for saints used a staff instead of a wand, which was the\r\ninstrument employed by fairies--he cured three blind men, two who were\r\ndumb, and one who was a cripple with the palsy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA count de Guythure, who was governor of Batz at the saint’s arrival\r\nlaboured under a mortal uneasiness of mind, on account of a little\r\nsilver bell belonging to the reigning king of England, the possession of\r\nwhich, in defiance of the injunction contained in the tenth commandment,\r\nhe coveted exceedingly. St. Pol ordered a fish to swallow the bell, and\r\nbring it over: this was instantly performed; but the saint had provided\r\na rival to himself, for the bell became a no less celebrated adept in\r\nmiracles than he was, and between them both the want of physicians in\r\nthe country was entirely precluded. The bell was afterwards deposited\r\namong the treasures in the cathedral of St. Pol de Léon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the Isle of Batz was visited with even a heavier affliction than the\r\nmortal uneasiness of its governor; it was infested by a terrible dragon,\r\nwhich devoured men, animals, and every thing that came in its way. St.\r\nPol, dressed in his pontificial robes and accompanied by a young man\r\nwhom he had selected for the purpose, repaired to the monster’s cavern,\r\nand commanded him to come forth. He soon appeared, making dreadful\r\nhissings and howlings; a stroke of the saint’s staff silenced him: a\r\nrope thrown round his neck, and an order to lead him away finished all\r\nopposition. St. Pol conducted him to the northernmost point of the\r\nisland; another stroke of his staff precipitated the monster into the\r\nsea, and he never more returned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe count de Guythure, charmed with the saint, resigned his splendid\r\npalace to him, and retired to Occismor on the continent, the place\r\nwhere the town now stands. The saint converted the palace into a\r\nmonastery; and, there being no water, had recourse to his staff again,\r\nand produced a fountain of fresh water still existing on the sea-shore,\r\nwhich is not affected by the overflowing of the sea.\r\n\r\nSt. Pol was afterwards bishop of Occismor, on which occasion the place\r\nchanged its name. Here he continued to work miracles, till, growing\r\nweary of mankind, he retired again to the Isle of Batz, where he died at\r\nthe age of a hundred and two years. The inhabitants of the island and\r\nthe people of Occismor disputed for his body; the dispute was settled by\r\neach agreeing to accept half. They were about to carry this agreement\r\ninto execution, when the body suddenly disappeared, and was afterwards\r\nfound on the sea-shore at Occismor, which was considered as a plain\r\nindication that the saint himself chose that for the place of his\r\ninterment. Such are the kind of fables related of this saint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn occurrence in the town of St. Pol de Léon about the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, has only this of prodigy in it, that such facts are\r\nnot common. A seigneur of the neighbourhood had accumulated debts to so\r\nlarge an amount, that he was entirely unable to discharge them, and knew\r\nnot what means to pursue for extricating himself from his\r\nembarrassments. Three of his tenants, farmers, offered to undertake the\r\nmanagement of his affairs, if he would resign every thing in trust to\r\nthem for a certain term of years; and they proffered to allow him half\r\nthe revenue he had drawn from them, and with the remainder to pay off\r\nhis debts, taking to themselves only what profit they might be able to\r\nderive from the speculation. The seigneur agreed to the proposal, and\r\nevery part of the agreement was punctually performed by the farmers. At\r\nthe term agreed on the estates were returned to the owner, not merely\r\ndisencumbered, but exceedingly increased in value, and in a state of\r\nexcellent cultivation, while the farmers had at the same time made a\r\nfair profit to themselves. At the final conclusion of the agreement they\r\nmade a present to the seigneur’s lady of eight horses, that she might\r\ncome to church, as they said, in a manner suitable to her rank.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, mingled with the legends of saints are its still more\r\nancient superstitions. There is scarcely a rock, a fountain, a wood, or\r\na cave, to which some tale of wonder is not attached. From thence omens\r\nand auguries are drawn regarding the ordinary occurrences of life. Every\r\noperation of nature is attributed by the Brétons to miraculous\r\ninterposition: they believe that the air, the earth, and the waters are\r\npeopled with supernatural agents of all sorts and descriptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLikewise there are fountains, into which if a child’s shirt or shift be\r\nthrown and it sinks, the child will die within the year; if it should\r\nswim, it is then put wet on the child, and is a charm against all kinds\r\nof diseases. The waters of some fountains are poured upon the ground by\r\nthose who have friends at sea, to procure a favourable wind for them\r\nduring four-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother mode of procuring a favourable wind is to sweep up the dust from\r\na church immediately after mass, and blow it towards the side on which\r\nthe friends are expected to return. The croak of the raven and the song\r\nof the thrush are answers to any questions put to them; they tell how\r\nmany years any one is to live, when he is to be married, and how many\r\nchildren he is to have. Any noise which cannot be immediately accounted\r\nfor foretells some misfortune, and the howling of a dog is as sure\r\nforerunner of death in a family of Brittany as in England. The noise of\r\nthe sea, or the whistling of the wind heard in the night, is the\r\nlamentation of the spirit of some one who has been drowned, complaining\r\nfor want of burial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA dæmon or spirit of some kind, called the _Teusarpouliet_, often\r\npresents himself to the people under the form of a cow, a dog, a cat, or\r\nsome other domestic animal; nay, he will sometimes in his assumed form\r\ndo all the work of the house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Jean gant y Tan_, “John and his fire,” is a dæmon who goes about in the\r\nnight with a candle on each finger, which he keeps constantly turning\r\nround very quick. What end this is to answer does not appear; there\r\nseems none, but the pleasure of frightening any body who may chance to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother nocturnal wanderer is a spectre in white carrying a lantern; he\r\nappears at first like a mere child, but as you look at him he increases\r\nin size every moment, till he becomes of a gigantic stature, and then\r\ndisappears. Like the other he seems to have no object in his walks\r\nexcept to frighten people. One of the servants in the house where Miss\r\nPlumptre resided very gravely gave her an account of a rencontre which\r\nshe once had with this gentleman. She had been out on an errand, and\r\nreturning home over the _Place du Peuple_ she saw a light coming towards\r\nher, which she thought at first was somebody with a lantern; but as it\r\ncame near she perceived the white figure, and it began to increase in\r\nsize,--so then she knew what it was, and she put her hands before her\r\nface, and ran screaming home. Her master, she said, laughed at her for a\r\nfool, and said it was her own fancy, because he had never happened to\r\nsee the spectre; nay, she did not know whether he would believe in it if\r\nhe did see it; but nobody should persuade her out of her senses; she saw\r\nit as plain as ever she saw any thing in her life, and she had never\r\nventured since to go out by herself after dark without a lantern, for\r\nthe spectre never presents himself before people who carry a light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Cariguel Ancou_, or “Chariot of death,” is a terrible apparition\r\ncovered with a white sheet, and driven by skeletons; and the noise of\r\nthe wheels is always heard in the street passing the door of a house\r\nwhere a person is dying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Buguel-nos_ is a beneficent spirit of a gigantic stature, who wears\r\na long white cloak, and is only to be seen between midnight and two in\r\nthe morning. He defends the people against the devil by wrapping his\r\ncloak round them; and while they are thus protected they hear the\r\ninfernal chariot whirl by, with a frightful noise, the charioteer making\r\nhideous cries and howlings: it may be traced in the air for a long time\r\nafter, by the stream of light which it leaves behind it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are a set of ghostly washerwoman called _ar cannerez nos_, or\r\n“nocturnal singers,” who wash their linen always by night, singing old\r\nsongs and tales all the time: they solicit the assistance of people\r\npassing by to wring the linen; if it be given awkwardly, they break the\r\nperson’s arm; if it be refused, they pull the refusers into the stream,\r\nand drown them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the district of Carhaix is a mountain called St. Michael, whither it\r\nis believed all dæmons cast out from the bodies of men are banished: if\r\nany one sets his foot at night within the circle they inhabit, he begins\r\nto run, and will never be able to cease all the rest of the night.\r\nNobody therefore ventures to this mountain after dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Brétons throw pins or small pieces of money into certain wells or\r\nsprings, for good luck; in others the women dip their children, to\r\nrender them inaccessible to pain. They watch the graves of their friends\r\nfor some nights after their interment, lest the devil should seize upon\r\nthem, and carry them off to his dominions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the district of Quimperlé there is a fountain called Krignac: to\r\ndrink three nights successively of this at midnight is an infallible\r\ncure for an intermittent fever; or, if it should not succeed it is a\r\nsure sign that the patient’s time is come, and he has nothing to do but\r\nquietly wait the stroke of death.\r\n\r\nIf a person who keeps bees has his hives robbed, he gives them up\r\nimmediately, because they never can succeed afterwards. This idea arises\r\nfrom an old Bréton proverb, which says, _Nesquét a chunche, varlearch ar\r\nlaër_ “No luck after the robber.” But why the whole weight of the\r\nproverb is made to fall upon the bee-hives, it might be difficult to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the country they tie a small piece of black stuff to\r\nthe bee-hives, in case of a death in the family, and a piece of red in\r\nthe case of a marriage; without which the bees would never thrive. On\r\nthe death of any one, they draw from the smoke of the fire an augury\r\nwhether his soul be gone to the regions of the blessed or the condemned:\r\nif the smoke be light and mount rapidly, he is gone to heaven; if it be\r\nthick and mount slowly, he is doomed to the regions below. If the left\r\neye of a dead person do not close, his nearest relation is to die very\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Brétons have the legend of St. Guénolé, whose sister had an eye\r\nplucked out by a goose; the saint took the eye out of the goose’s\r\nentrails, and restored it to its place without its appearing in any way\r\ndifferent from what it was before.\r\n\r\nThey tell you likewise of St. Vincent Ferrier, who, while he was\r\ncelebrating mass at Vannes, perceived that he had lost his gloves and\r\nparapluie; and recollecting that he had left them at Rome went thither\r\nto seek them, and returned and finished his mass, without one of his\r\ncongregation having perceived his absence.\r\n\r\nThey have also a narrative of a wolf who ate up a poor man’s ass. St.\r\nMalo ordered the wolf to perform the functions of the ass, which he\r\ncontinued to do ever after; and though sometimes shut up in the stable\r\nwith the sheep, never offered to touch them, but contentedly fed on\r\nthistles, and such other provender as his predecessor used to have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA peasant boy in the district of Lesneven was never able to pronounce\r\nany other words than _O itroun guerhes Mari_, “O lady Virgin Mary.” This\r\nhe was perpetually repeating, and he passed among the country people for\r\nan idiot. As he grew up he would live no longer with his parents in\r\ntheir cottage, but slept in the hollow of a tree, and ran about the\r\nwoods making his usual cry; in the coldest weather he plunged into the\r\nwater up to his neck, still uttering his usual words, and came up\r\nwithout receiving any injury. After he died, a lily sprang from the spot\r\nwhere he was interred. “A miracle!” was the immediate cry, and a church\r\nwas built over the grave, dedicated to _Notre Dame de Follgoat_, “Our\r\nlady of the madman of the woods,” where notable miracles were afterwards\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain ruins near the coast, a little to the south of Brest, are\r\nreputed to be those of a palace which belonged to the _Courils_, a sort\r\nof pigmies, who deal in sorceries, are very malicious, and are great\r\ndancers. They are often seen by moonlight skipping about consecrated\r\nstones or any ancient druidical monument; they seize people by the\r\nhand, who cannot help following them in all their movements; and when\r\nthe spirits have made them dance as long as they please, they trip up\r\ntheir heels, leave them sprawling on the ground, and go laughing away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are in more than one place near the western coast stones set up in\r\nthe same manner as those at Stonehenge. A species of genii, called\r\n_Gaurics_, are supposed to dance among them; and the stones are called,\r\nin general, _Chior-gaur_, or “The giants’ dance.” In one of the places\r\nwhere some of these stones are to be seen, the people of the\r\nneighbourhood, if asked what they mean, say that it was a procession to\r\na wedding which was all in a moment changed into stone for some crime,\r\nbut they do not know what. In another place they are reputed to be the\r\nfuneral procession of a miser, who received this punishment because in\r\nhis lifetime he had never given any thing to the poor.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few out of the innumerable superstitions which prevail\r\nthroughout Bretagne, but they are sufficient to give a perfect idea of\r\nthe power which imagination has over the minds of these people.[260]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·30.\r\n\r\n  [259] See vol. i. col. 935.\r\n\r\n  [260] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

Decyphering and\r\ndrawing lines on the sand and ground are of great antiquity; and where\r\neducation has failed to instruct, nature has supplied amusement. The\r\nscheme, which affords the game of “Ninepenny Marl,” is cut in the clay,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-----------+\r\n  |\\          |          /|\r\n  | +---------+---------+ |\r\n  | |\\        |        /| |\r\n  | | +-------+-------+ | |\r\n  | | |               | | |\r\n  | | |               | | |\r\n  +-+-+               +-+-+\r\n  | | |               | | |\r\n  | | |               | | |\r\n  | | +-------+-------+ | |\r\n  | |/        |        \\| |\r\n  | +---------+---------+ |\r\n  |/          |          \\|\r\n  +-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nor it might be drawn upon the crown of a hat with chalk. In cottages and\r\npublic houses, it is marked on the side of a pair of bellows, or upon a\r\ntable, and, in short, any plain surface. “Marl” is played, like cards,\r\nby two persons; each person has nine bits of pipe, or stick, so as to\r\ndistinguish it from those of the opponent. Each puts the pipe or stick\r\nupon one of the points or corners of the line, alternately, till they\r\nare all filled. There is much caution required in this, or your opponent\r\nwill avail himself of your error, by placing his man on the very point\r\nwhich it is necessary you should occupy; the chief object being to make\r\na perfect line of three, either way, and also to prevent the other\r\nplayer doing so. Every man that is taken is put into the square till no\r\nfurther move can be made. But if the vanquished be reduced to only\r\nthree, he can hop and skip into any vacant place, that he may, if\r\npossible, even at the last, form a line, which is sometimes done by very\r\nwary manœuvres. However simple “Ninepenny Marl” may appear, much skill\r\nis required, particularly in the choice of the first places, so as to\r\nform the lines as perfectly and quickly as possible. This game, like\r\ncards, has its variations. But the above imperfectly described way is\r\nthat to which I was accustomed when a boy. I have no doubt, Mr. Editor,\r\nmany of your country readers are not wholly ignorant of the innocent\r\noccupation which “Ninepenny Marl” has afforded in the retirement of\r\nleisure; and with strong recollections of its attractions,\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obliged correspondent,\r\n\r\n  *, *, P.\r\n\r\n  _P---- T--, July, 1826._\r\n\r\nP.

King and Lochee, of King-street,\r\nCovent-garden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give an adequate account of the “Leverian Museum,”\r\nbut its celebrity throughout Europe seems to require some further notice\r\nthan a bare mention: a few facts are subjoined to convey an idea of its\r\nextent, and of the gratification the lovers of natural history and\r\nantiquities must have derived from its contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe last place wherein the Leverian collection was exhibited, was in a\r\nhandsome building on the Surrey side of the Thames, near\r\nBlackfriars-bridge, consisting of seventeen different apartments,\r\noccupying nearly one thousand square yards. In these rooms were\r\nassembled the rarest productions in the animal, vegetable, and mineral\r\nkingdoms, with inimitable works of art, and the various dresses,\r\nmanufactures, implements of war, &c. of the Indian nations in North and\r\nSouth America, Otaheite, Botany-bay and other foreign parts, collected\r\nby the late captain Cook and other navigators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding engraving represents the rotunda of the museum, from a\r\nprint published about twenty years before the sale took place. It is an\r\naccurate record of the appearance of that part of the edifice, until the\r\nauction, which was held on the premises, finally broke up the rare\r\nassemblage of objects exhibited. After the sale the premises were\r\noccupied for many years by the library, apparatus, and other uses of the\r\nSurrey Institution. They are now, in 1826, used for recreation of\r\nanother kind. On the exterior of the building is inscribed “Rotunda Wine\r\nRooms.” It is resorted to by lovers of “a good glass of wine” and “a\r\ncigar,” and there is professional singing and music in “the Rotunda”\r\nevery Tuesday and Thursday evening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last editor of Mr. Pennant’s “London,” in a note on his author’s\r\nmention of the Leverian Museum, remarks its dispersion, by observing\r\nthat “this noble collection, which it is said was offered to the British\r\nMuseum for a moderate sum, was sold by auction in 1806. The sale lasted\r\nthirty-four days. The number of lots, many containing several articles,\r\namounted to four thousand one hundred and ninety-four.”\r\n\r\nThis statement is somewhat erroneous. An entire copy of the “Catalogue\r\nof the Leverian Museum,” which was drawn up by Edward Donavan, Esq. the\r\neminent naturalist, is now before the editor of the _Every-Day Book_,\r\nwith the prices annexed. It forms an octavo volume of four hundred and\r\nten pages, and from thence it appears that the sale lasted sixty-five\r\ndays, instead of thirty-four, and that the lots amounted to 7879,\r\ninstead of 4194, as stated by Mr. Pennant’s editor.\r\n\r\nORDER OF THE CATALOGUE.\r\n\r\n                                  _Days._\r\n  Part   I.   5th  May to 13th       8\r\n   --   II.  14th         22d        8\r\n   --  III.  23d          31st       8\r\n   --   IV.   2d  June to 11th       8\r\n   --    V.  12th         20th       8\r\n   --   VI.  21st          9th July 17\r\n  Addition   10th July to 13th       3\r\n  Appendix   14th         18th       5\r\n                                    --\r\n                             _Days_ 65\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leicester House._\r\n\r\nThe first exhibition of the Leverian Museum in London, was at “Leicester\r\nhouse,” Leicester-square. “This house was founded,” Mr. Pennant says,\r\n“by one of the Sydnies, earls of Leicester. It was for a short time the\r\nresidence of Elizabeth, daughter of James I., the titular queen of\r\nBohemia, who, on February 13, 1661, here ended her unfortunate life. It\r\nwas successively the _pouting-place_ of princes. The late king (George\r\nII.) when prince of Wales, after he had quarrelled with his father,\r\nlived here several years. His son, Frederick, followed his example,\r\nsucceeded him in his house, and in it finished his days.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pennant then proceeds, more immediately to our purpose, to observe,\r\n“No one is ignorant of the magnificent and instructive museum, exhibited\r\nin this house by the late sir Ashton Lever. It was the most astonishing\r\ncollection of the subjects of natural history ever collected, in so\r\nshort a space, by any individual. To the disgrace of our kingdom, after\r\nthe first burst of wonder was over, it became neglected; and when it was\r\noffered to the public, by the chance of a guinea lottery, only eight\r\nthousand out of thirty-six thousand tickets were sold. Finally, the\r\ncapricious goddess frowned on the spirited proprietor of such a number\r\nof tickets, and transferred the treasure to the possessor of only two,\r\nMr. Parkinson.” Further on, Mr. Pennant says, “I must not omit reminding\r\nthe reader, that the celebrated museum collected by the late sir Ashton\r\nLever, is transported to the southern end of _Blackfriars_-bridge by Mr.\r\nParkinson, whom fortune favoured with it in the Leverian lottery. That\r\ngentleman built a place expressly for its reception, and disposed the\r\nrooms with so much judgment, as to give a most advantageous view of the\r\ninnumerable curiosities. The spirit of the late worthy owner seems to\r\nhave been transfused into the present.

The\r\nevidence whereon the committee of the house of commons founded its\r\nreport in behalf of the bill, which afterwards passed and enabled sir\r\nAshton Lever to dispose of his museum in that manner, amply testifies\r\nthe opinion conceived of it by individuals fully qualified to decide on\r\nits importance.\r\n\r\nMr. Tennant who had been upwards of twenty years a collector of subjects\r\nof natural history, and had seen all the cabinets of curiosities, both\r\npublic and private, of any note in Holland, France, and Portugal, and\r\nthose at Brussels, Dresden, Brunswick, and Vienna, and had also seen the\r\nSpanish cabinet while collecting in Holland, said, that he had never\r\nseen any collection more rare, more curious, or more instructive than\r\nsir Ashton Lever’s, nor any that could be compared with it; that it\r\nexceeded all others in the beauty and preservation of the numerous\r\narticles it contained, which were better selected than any he had seen\r\nelsewhere; and that it contained many specimens that could not be\r\nprocured at any expense.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton gave similar testimony. Having a particular love\r\nfor natural history, in different journeys to and from Naples, where he\r\nwas ambassador from Great Britain, he had seen every public and private\r\nmuseum in Holland, France, Germany, Italy, and Sicily, and he thought\r\nsir Ashton Lever’s collection was in every respect the finest.\r\n\r\nBaron Dimsdale said he had seen the cabinets of curiosities at Moscow\r\nand St. Petersburgh, and also those at Paris and Dresden, which are\r\nesteemed very curious and valuable, and that they were not, all\r\ntogether, to be compared with sir Ashton Lever’s museum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter such distinguished and unquestionable testimonials respecting this\r\ncollection, it would be trifling to adduce a poem in proof that it\r\nmerited praise; but as a curiosity, which, on account of the youth of\r\nits author, sir Ashton Lever himself must have deemed a “curiosity,” the\r\nfollowing may be perused with interest.\r\n\r\n  VERSES,\r\n\r\n  ADDRESSED TO SIR ASHTON LEVER, BY A LITTLE BOY OF TEN YEARS OLD ON\r\n  BEING FAVOURED WITH A SIGHT OF HIS MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n  _November 6, 1778._\r\n\r\n    If I had Virgil’s judgment, Homer’s fire,\r\n    And could with equal rapture strike the lyre,\r\n    Could drink as largely of the muse’s spring,\r\n    Then would I of sir Ashton’s merits sing.\r\n    Look here, look there, above, beneath, around,\r\n    Sure great Apollo consecrates the ground.\r\n    Here stands a tiger, mighty in his strength,\r\n    There crocodiles extend their scaly length:\r\n    Subtile, voracious to devour their food,\r\n    Savage they look, and seem to pant for blood.\r\n    Here shells and fish, and finny dolphins seen,\r\n    Display their various colours blue and green.\r\n    View there an urn which Roman ashes bore,\r\n    And habits once that foreign nations wore.\r\n    Birds and wild beasts from Afric’s burning sand,\r\n    And curious fossils rang’d in order stand.\r\n    Now turn your eyes from them, and quick survey,\r\n    Spars, diamonds, crystals, dart a golden ray\r\n    View apes in different attitudes appear,\r\n    With horns of bucks, and goats, and shamois deer.\r\n    Next various kinds of monsters meet the eye;\r\n    Dreadful they seem, grim-looking as they lie.\r\n    What man is he that does not view with awe\r\n    The river-horse that gives the Tigris law?\r\n    Dauntless he looks, and, eager to engage,\r\n    Lashes his sides, and burns with steady rage.\r\n    View where an elephant’s broad bulk appears,\r\n    And o’er his head his hollow trunk he rears:\r\n    He seems to roar, impatient for the fight,\r\n    And stands collected in his utmost might.\r\n    Some I have sung, much more my muse could name;\r\n    A nobler muse requires sir Ashton’s fame.\r\n    I’ve gained my end, if you, good sir, receive\r\n    This feeble present, which I freely give.\r\n    Your well-known worth, to distant nations told,\r\n    Amongst the sons of Fame shall be enroll’d.\r\n\r\n  T.

MARGARET.\r\n\r\nThis saint is in the church of England calendar and the almanacs.\r\n\r\nButler speaks of her merely as a virgin, who is “said” to have been\r\ninstructed in the faith by a christian nurse, and persecuted by her\r\nfather, who was a pagan priest; that after being tormented, she was\r\nmartyred by the sword “in the last general persecution;” that “her name\r\noccurs in the litany inserted in the old Roman order,” and in ancient\r\nGreek calendars; that, from the east, her veneration was exceedingly\r\npropagated in England, France, and Germany during the holy wars; that\r\n“Vida, the glory of the christian muses,” honoured her as “one of the\r\ntitular saints of Cremona, his native city, with two hymns, begging of\r\nGod through her prayers” a happy death and a holy life; and that “her\r\nbody is now kept at Monte Fiascone, in Tuscany.”\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians are not more famous for embalming, than the Romish church\r\nis celebrated for the keeping of saints’ bodies--with the additional\r\nreputation of a peculiar tact at discovering them. It was not at all\r\nuncommon to distinguish their bones, from other mortuary remains, a few\r\ncenturies after death.\r\n\r\nWe are told that St. Margaret received the crown of martyrdom in the\r\nyear 278,[263] therefore her body, “now kept at Monte Fiascone,” may be\r\nregarded to have been as well “kept” through one thousand five hundred\r\nyears, as those of other saints; for it must be observed that none but\r\nsaints’ bodies “keep.” There is not an instance of the body of any lay\r\nindividual, however virtuous or illustrious, having remained to us\r\nthrough fifteen centuries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe illustrious father of the order of the Jesuits, Peter Ribadeneira,\r\nrather confusedly relates that St. Margaret was devoured by the devil;\r\nand “in an other place it is sayd that he swalowed her into his bely,”\r\nand that while in his inside she made the sign of the cross, and she\r\n“yssued out all hole and sounde,” though it is added that this account\r\n“is apocrifum.” We are told that a devil appeared to her in the likeness\r\nof a man, but she caught him by the head, threw him down, set her right\r\nfoot on his neck, and said, “Lye still thou fende, under the fote of a\r\nwoman.” In that situation the devil admitted he was vanquished, and\r\ndeclared he would not have cared if a young man had conquered him, but\r\nhe was very vexed to have been overcome by a young woman. St. Margaret\r\nasked him what he was, and he answered that his name was Veltis, that he\r\nwas one of a multitude of devils who had been enclosed in a brass vessel\r\nby Solomon, and that after Solomon’s death this vessel was broken at\r\nBabylon by persons who supposed it contained a treasure, when all the\r\ndevils flew out and took to the air, where they were incessantly espying\r\nhow to “assayle ryghtfull men.” Then she took her foot from his neck,\r\nand said to him, “Flee hens thou wretched fende,” and behold “the earth\r\nopened and the fende sanke in.”[264]\r\n\r\nHowever “right comfortable” this relation may be, there is more\r\n“delection” in that of St. Margaret being swallowed by the devil; it is\r\na pity it is “apocrifum.”\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·25.\r\n\r\n  [263] Mr. Audley.\r\n\r\n  [264] Golden Legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 21.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. VICTOR OF MARSEILLES.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Butler that this saint was a martyr under the emperor\r\nMaximian. From his silence as to the saint’s life, it is to be inferred\r\nthat biographers of saints were rare, while, from his elaborate account\r\nof the saint’s death, it is to be inferred that their martyrdoms were\r\nattended by able reporters.\r\n\r\nThe abbey of St. Victor at Marseilles was one of the most celebrated\r\nreligious foundations in Europe. It claimed to have been the first\r\nmonastery established in France. Its ruins are striking objects of\r\ncuriosity to visiters of the town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSt. Victor’s monastery was founded by St. Cassien, patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, in the fourth or fifth century. The spot was fixed upon\r\nby St. Cassien for his new foundation, from the ground being already\r\nconsidered as sacred by the Marseillais, for we are assured that Mary\r\nMagdalen and her brother Lazarus arrived in Provence with a cargo of\r\nsaints, fixed their residence at Marseilles, and converted a great\r\nnumber of the inhabitants; and that Mary Magdalen after remaining there\r\nsome time, desirous of being more secluded, withdrew to a grotto in the\r\nrock on which the abbey of St. Victor now stands. Still, pressed by\r\ncrowds, she removed a league from Marseilles to the quarter of\r\nAygalades, where afterwards was founded a monastery of the Carmes. Even\r\nhere she could not find seclusion, and she finally fixed her retreat at\r\nthe _Sainte Beaume_, a grotto in the mountain of St. Pilon, in a more\r\nremote part of the country where she ended her days.\r\n\r\nOn the spot sanctified by her first retreat, a chapel was erected and\r\ndedicated to the Holy Virgin under the title of “Nôtre Dame de la\r\nConfession.” A little confusion seems here to have been made between\r\nMary Magdalen, in remembrance of whom the spot was considered as sacred,\r\nand the virgin mother; for after the monastery was built, a chapel in it\r\nwas dedicated to the Virgin Mary, while little notice was taken of Mary\r\nthe penitent.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of St. Cassien many years after the body of the celebrated\r\nSt. Victor was interred there, was called the monastery of St. Victor.\r\nHis foot was said to have been cut off by order of Maximian, for having\r\nkicked down a statue of Jupiter when required to sacrifice to it; this\r\nfoot has been a relic in high esteem ever since. Afterwards his head was\r\ncut off, and the head became another relic of very high value. Various\r\nmiracles are reported to have been wrought at his tomb, particularly in\r\nthe cure of demoniacs.\r\n\r\nIt is also related that the tomb of the emperor Maximian, who died and\r\nwas interred at Marseilles, was discovered about the middle of the\r\neleventh century, and recognised to be his by an inscription. The body\r\nwas in a leaden coffin, and found entire, having been preserved by an\r\nodoriferous liquor with which it was anointed without, and filled\r\nwithin. Two chalices of gold, full of the same liquor, were placed on\r\neach side of the head. As a persecutor of the christian church, his body\r\nwas by order of Raimbaud, archbishop of Aries, thrown into the sea; and\r\nit is alleged that for some time after the water of the spot where it\r\nwas thrown bubbled furiously, as if boiling over a fire, and cast up\r\nsmoke and flames from the bosom of the deep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition respecting St. Victor in the archives of the abbey,\r\nthat a dragon of the wood adjoining devoured every thing that came in\r\nhis way, human beings as well as animals; whereupon St. Victor went\r\nforth to fight him, armed cap-à-piè, and mounted on a mettled courser,\r\nand that he slew him and freed the country from so terrible a scourge.\r\nAn effigy of the saint, engaged with his fearful antagonist, was carved\r\nin stone, and placed over the porch of the great church: and the same\r\ndevice was adopted as the great seal of the monastery. The carving over\r\nthe church porch remains to this day, though somewhat defaced: it is the\r\nexact counterpart of the English St. George and the dragon. Underneath\r\nis inscribed\r\n\r\n    _Massiliam vere._ (VICTOR) _civesque tuere_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the St. Victor’s day, which is the twenty-first of July, there were\r\nformerly held at Marseilles a festival and procession in honour of him,\r\ncalled “La Triomphale.” The relics of the saint were carried round the\r\ntown by the prior of the monastery, attended by the whole community. At\r\nthe head of the procession marched a cavalier in complete armour, highly\r\nornamented, carrying a lance in one hand, and in the other the standard\r\nof the abbey, on which were the arms richly embroidered; he wore a rich\r\nscarf, and his horse had a housing of white damask, ornamented with blue\r\ncrosses. This cavalier was intended to represent St. Victor. He was\r\npreceded by twelve cavaliers carrying lighted tapers, and accompanied by\r\na band of music with drums and trumpets. Six pages followed him. As soon\r\nas the people heard the music, and saw the standard, they flocked in\r\ncrowds to join the procession. As it passed along the quay of the port,\r\nall the vessels hoisted their colours, and saluted it with a discharge\r\nof cannon and musquetry; and the consuls, with the rest of the\r\nmagistrates, met it at an appointed place, to pay their homage to the\r\nsaint, and attend him back to the abbey.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony had been observed every year from time immemorial, till\r\nmonsieur de Belsunce, the bishop of Marseilles, who distinguished\r\nhimself so much in the great plague of 1720, prevailed upon the\r\nmagistrates to consent to the abolition of it, for the following reason.\r\nHe was about to publish a biography of the bishops, his predecessors,\r\nfrom the first conversion of the town to the christian faith, among whom\r\nit was necessary to include St. Victor; and not wishing him to appear\r\notherwise than a christian bishop and martyr, he thought he would not be\r\nconsidered in these lights only, while the people were accustomed to see\r\nhim every year in a character directly opposite; so that no way appeared\r\nof making the impression he desired, except by abolishing the annual\r\nceremony. Until then the relics of St. Victor, who was esteemed the\r\npatron saint of Marseilles were always borne in the procession. They\r\nwere likewise carried in procession at the time of any public calamity;\r\nbut on these occasions the armed cavalier did not make his appearance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _grotto_, which for a short time had been the residence of Mary\r\nMagdalen, was, on the foundation of the monastery converted into a\r\nchapel, and a tomb erected to her memory. It was said that no woman\r\ncould enter this chapel without being immediately struck blind; and for\r\nsome centuries no female attempted to penetrate the sanctity of the\r\nplace, till the celebrated queen Joan insisted on admission, when it is\r\nsaid she had sooner passed the portal than she was deprived of her\r\nsight. It was afterwards restored, on her putting a balustrade of solid\r\nsilver round the image of the virgin. This image has been preserved, and\r\na place has been allotted her in the church; but one of the remarkable\r\neffects of the French revolution is, that a woman can now look at it\r\nwithout experiencing the least inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn the tomb of the Magdalen, which was of white marble, were many\r\ncurious figures carved in relief--among others a wolf suckling two\r\nchildren; and in the inferior church were seven very fine marble columns\r\nof the Corinthian order. These are supposed to have been some of the\r\nmany spoils of the Pagan temples, which the monks of St. Victor are\r\nknown to have appropriated to their own use.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly a popular belief, that in this place were deposited the\r\nbodies of seven brothers who were not dead, but lay there to sleep till\r\nthe general resurrection. What became of them at the demolition of the\r\nabbey does not appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of the abbey of St. Victor was a well, with a\r\nsmall column of granite on each side of it. On one of the columns was a\r\nfigure which was called the impression of the devil’s claw; and the\r\nstory concerning it was, that the old gentleman, being envious of the\r\nsuperior sanctity of the holy fathers, stole one day into the monastery\r\nwith a malicious intention to corrupt them. What form he assumed is not\r\nstated by the record, but he was soon discovered, and obliged to make\r\nhis escape; in doing which he stepped over these two columns, and left\r\nthe impression of his claw upon one of them. The truth was, that the\r\ncolumns were ancient ones, and the devil’s claw the remains of an\r\nacanthus’ leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abbey of St. Victor was secularized under Louis XV. Formerly none\r\nbut natives of Marseilles could be members of the community, and the\r\ncity had the right of placing in it, a certain number of youth for\r\neducation free of expense. These valuable privileges were surrendered,\r\nand the canons were in future only to be chosen from among such families\r\nof Provence, as could produce a title of a hundred and fifty years’\r\nnobility on the paternal side. From that time the foundation assumed\r\nthe title of “the noble and illustrious collegiate church of St.\r\nVictor.”\r\n\r\nIn a few years afterwards, the new canons, being all nobles, petitioned\r\nthe king for a badge to distinguish them from the other chapters of the\r\nprovince; and they obtained permission to wear a cross, or rather a star\r\nof enamel, similar to that worn by the knights of Malta, slung round the\r\nneck with a deep red ribband. In the centre of the cross was represented\r\non one side the figure of St. Victor with the dragon, and round it “Divi\r\nVictoris Massiliensis,” and on the other, the great church of the abbey,\r\nwith the words “Monumentis et nobilitate insignis.”\r\n\r\nThe luxury and libertinism of the new canons were matter of notoriety\r\nand scandal, and in the great overthrow of the sceptre and priesthood,\r\nthe abbey of St. Victor became one of the first objects of popular\r\nvengeance. So complete was the demolition of many parts of the\r\nbuildings, that even the very stones were carried away; but in the\r\ngreater part fragments of the walls are still left standing. Among the\r\nruins are many fragments of carved work, which the monks had\r\nappropriated to the decoration of their monastery. The most beautiful of\r\nthese remains were deposited in the Lyceum at Marseilles.[265]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·87.\r\n\r\n  [265] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 22.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGDALENE.\r\n\r\nThis name is in the church of England calendar and the almanacs.\r\n\r\nThe character of Magdalen is ably vindicated from the common and vulgar\r\nimputation by the illustrious Lardner, in a letter to the late Jonas\r\nHanway, wherein he urges on the eminent philanthropist, the manifest\r\nimpropriety of calling a receptacle for female penitents by the name of\r\nMagdalen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Mary Magdalen._\r\n\r\nSainte Beaume near Marseilles is a vast cavity in a mountain, thence\r\ncalled the mountain of the Sainte Beaume. Here Mary Magdalen has been\r\nreputed to have secluded herself during the latter years of her life,\r\nand to have died. The spot is considered as holy ground; and in former\r\ntimes the pilgrimages undertaken to it from very distant parts,\r\noccasioned the cavern to be converted into a chapel dedicated to the\r\nMagdalen. About the end of the thirteenth century, a convent of\r\nDominican friars was built close to the cavern, and the chapel was from\r\nthat time served by the monks of the convent. Afterwards an _hospice_,\r\nor inn, for the accommodation of pilgrims, and travellers, was added,\r\nand in this state it remained till the revolution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Plumptre describes an interesting visit to _Sainte Beaume_:--\r\n\r\nFrom Nans we soon began to ascend the lesser mountains, which form the\r\nbase of the principal one, and, after pursuing a winding path for a\r\nconsiderable distance, came to a plain called the Plan d’Aulps, at the\r\nfoot of the great mountain. The whole side of this latter is covered\r\nwith wood, except an interval in one spot, which presents to the eye an\r\nenormous rock, almost perpendicular. As this opened upon us in crossing\r\nthe plain, monsieur B----, who was acquainted with the spot, said, “Now\r\nyou can see the convent.” We looked around, but saw no signs of a\r\nhabitation: “No,” said he, “you must not look round, you must look\r\nupwards against the rock.” We did so, and to our utter astonishment\r\ndescried it about halfway up this tremendous precipice; appearing, when\r\nbeheld in this point of view, as if it had no foundation, but was\r\nsuspended against the rock, like any thing hung upon a nail or peg. The\r\nsensation excited by the idea of a human habitation in such a place was\r\nvery singular; it was a mixture of astonishment mingled with awe, and an\r\ninvoluntary shuddering, at the situation of persons living in a spot\r\nwhich had the appearance of being wholly inaccessible: it seemed as if\r\nthe house could have been built only by magic, and that by magic alone\r\nthe inhabitants could have been transported into it.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the plain, we entered the wood through which the pathway\r\nthat leads up to the grotto and the convent winds. A more complete or\r\nsublime scene of solitude can scarcely be conceived. Though great\r\nnumbers of the trees were cut down during the revolution, sufficient\r\nstill remain to form a thick shade.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the convent, we found that the appearance we had observed\r\nfrom below, was a deception occasioned by the distance; that it was\r\nbuilt on a narrow esplanade on the rock, which just afforded room for\r\nthe building and a walk before it, guarded on the side of the precipice\r\nby a parapet. It was indeed a formidable sight to look over this upon\r\nthe precipice below. Both the convent and the inn were pillaged in the\r\nrevolution, and little more than their shells remain.\r\n\r\nThe grotto is a fine specimen of the wild features of nature. The roof\r\nis a natural vault, and the silence of the place is only interrupted by\r\nthe dripping of water from the roof at the further end, into a basin\r\nformed by the rock, which receives it below. This water is remarkably\r\nclear and limpid, and is warm in winter, but very cold in summer. It is\r\nconsidered of great efficacy in the cure of diseases, from the\r\nmiraculous powers with which it is endowed through the sanctity of the\r\nplace. The cures it performs are confined, therefore, to those who have\r\nfaith enough to rely upon its efficacy. The great altar of the chapel\r\nwas very magnificent, all of marble, enclosed within an iron balustrade.\r\nThe iron is gone, but most of the marble remains, though much broken and\r\nscattered about; and what appeared remarkable was that a great many\r\n_fleurs-de-lys_ in mosaic, with which the altar was decorated, were left\r\nuntouched. Behind the altar is a figure in marble of the Magdalen, in a\r\nrecumbent posture, with her head resting upon her right hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother point of the mountain, directly above the grotto of the Sainte\r\nBeaume, is called St. Pilon: it is nearly six hundred feet higher than\r\nthe esplanade on which the convent stands, and between two-thirds and\r\nthree-quarters of an English mile perpendicular height above the level\r\nof the sea. It is said, that while the Magdalen was performing her\r\npenitence in the grotto, she was constantly carried up to St. Pilon by\r\nangels seven times a day to pray; and in aftertimes a chapel in form of\r\na rotunda was erected there in commemoration of this circumstance; but\r\nthis is now destroyed. Very small models of it in bone, containing a\r\nchaplet and crucifix, used to be made at the convent, which were\r\npurchased by visiters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the illustrious visiters to Sainte Beaume, were Francis I., with\r\nhis mother, the queen his first wife, and the duchess of Alençon his\r\nsister. In commemoration of this visit, which was in 1516, a statue of\r\nFrancis was erected in the grotto: it remained there nearly to the time\r\nof the revolution. In 1517, the duchess of Mantua, accompanied by a\r\nnumerous train of attendants, made a pilgrimage thither, as she was\r\npassing through Provence; sixteen years afterwards it was visited by\r\nEleanor of Austria, second wife to Francis, with the dauphin and the\r\ndukes of Orleans and Angoulême. In 1660 it was honoured with the\r\npresence of Louis XIV., his mother, the duke of Anjou, and the numerous\r\ntrain by whom they were attended in their progress through the south.\r\n\r\nSince this period it does not appear that any persons of note visited\r\nthe shrine from devotional motives; but it has always been a great\r\nobject of the devotion of the Provençeaux, particularly of the lower\r\nclass. It was often made a part of the marriage contract among them,\r\nthat the husband should accompany the wife in a pilgrimage thither,\r\nwithin the first year after they were married; but even if no express\r\nstipulation was made, the husband who did not do so was thought to have\r\nfailed very much in the attention and regard due to his wife. Whitsun\r\nweek was the usual time for making these visits, and all the avenues to\r\nthe grotto were at this time thronged with company, as if it had been a\r\nfair. All the way from Nans to the grotto are little oratories by the\r\nroad side at certain distances, in which there used to be pictures of\r\nthe Magdalen’s history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most illustrious guests the grotto ever received, must be\r\nreckoned Petrarch. He went at the solicitation of Humbert, dauphin of\r\nthe Viennois, and of cardinal Colonna, very much against his own\r\ninclination. In a letter which he wrote thirty-four years afterwards to\r\nhis intimate friend Philip of Cabassole, bishop of Cavaillon, he says,\r\n“We passed three days and three nights in this holy and horrible cavern.\r\nWearied with the society of persons whom I had accompanied spite of\r\nmyself, I often wandered alone into the neighbouring forest. I had even\r\nrecourse to my usual remedy for chasing the ennui which arises from\r\nbeing in company not perfectly agreeable to me. My imagination at such\r\nmoments recurs to my absent friends, and represents them as if present\r\nwith me: though my acquaintance with you was not then of long standing,\r\nyet you came to my assistance; I fancied that you were seated by me in\r\nthe grotto, and invited me to write some verses in honour of the holy\r\npenitent, towards whom you had always a particular devotion; when I\r\nimmediately obeyed, and wrote such as first occurred.” The verses are\r\nlittle more than a poetical description of the place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA carmelite friar of the seventeenth century, whose name was Jean Louis\r\nBarthelemi, but who always called himself Pierre de St. Louis,\r\ndetermined to amuse his solitary hours with writing a poem upon some\r\nillustrious saint. He hesitated awhile between Elias, whom he considered\r\nas the founder of his order, and Mary Magdalen, a female with whom he\r\nhad been enamoured before his retirement. Love at length decided the\r\nquestion, and he composed a poem in twelve books, which he entitled,\r\n“_The Magdalenéïde, or Mary Magdalen at the Desert of the Sainte Beaume\r\nin Provence, a Spiritual and Christian Poem_.” This work cost five years\r\nof close application, and came forth one of the most whimsical effusions\r\nthat ever flowed from the pen of pious extravagance. Some idea of it may\r\nbe collected from a few extracts literally translated.\r\n\r\nHaving treated at large of the Magdalen’s irregular conduct in the early\r\npart of her life, and of her subsequent conversion, he says, “But God at\r\nlength changed this coal into a ruby, this crow into a dove, this wolf\r\ninto a sheep, this hell into a heaven, this nothing into something, this\r\nthistle into a lily, this thorn into a rose, this sin into grace, this\r\nimpotence into power, this vice into virtue, this caldron into a\r\nmirror.” Again, speaking of the thirty years which she is reputed to\r\nhave passed in the grotto and the woods adjoining, deploring the sins of\r\nher youth, he says, “The woods might make her pass for a Hamadryad, her\r\ntears might make her to be thought a Naiad;--come then, ye curious, and\r\nyou may behold an aquatic nymph in the midst of a forest.” And again, in\r\na panegyric upon her penitence, is the following very extraordinary\r\npassage: “While she occupies herself in expatiating the offences of her\r\n_preterite_ time, which was but _imperfect_, the _future_ is destined to\r\nrepair the loss;--the _present_ is such that it is _indicative_ of a\r\nlove which mounts to the _infinitive_, and in a degree always\r\n_superlative_, turning against herself the _accusative_.” The poet\r\nconcludes his work by saying, “If you desire grace and sweetness in\r\nverses, in mine will you find them; and if you seek ingenious thoughts,\r\nyou will find that the points of these are not blunted.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·47.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 23.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY.\r\n\r\nDied, at Elderslie, on the twenty-third of July, 1826, Hugh Shaw, at the\r\ngreat age of 113 years.

While able to go about, he had no other means of support than\r\nwhat he collected by begging from door to door. After his confinement to\r\nthe house, he was supported by private bounty.

He is said to have left strict charges\r\nthat, as he had never received parish relief, he should be buried\r\nwithout its aid, even if he were interred without a coffin.

Its operations extended from the\r\nislands of Scilly, as far east as Leskeard, and as far as Camelford\r\nnorth. The noise exceeded that of thunder; the tremours of the earth\r\nwere heard and seen in different mines, particularly the following:--In\r\nCarnoth Adit in St. Just, the shock was felt eighteen fathoms deep; and\r\nin Boseadzhil Downs mine, thirty fathoms. At Huel-rith mine in the\r\nparish of Lelant, the earth moved under the miners, quick, and with a\r\ntrembling motion. In Herland mine, in the parish of Gwinear, the noise\r\nwas heard sixty fathoms deep. In Chace-water mine, near Redruth, at\r\nseventy fathoms deep, a dull and rumbling sound. The effect on the\r\nminers may easily be conceived; they are generally a very superstitious\r\nrace of men.[267]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cornish Hurling._\r\n\r\n“Hurling matches” are peculiar to Cornwall. They are trials of skill\r\nbetween two parties, consisting of a considerable number of men, forty\r\nto sixty aside, and often between two parishes. These exercises have\r\ntheir name from “hurling” a wooden ball, about three inches diameter,\r\ncovered with a plate of silver, which is sometimes gilt, and has\r\ncommonly a motto--“Fair play is good play.” The success depends on\r\ncatching the ball dexterously when thrown up, or _dealt_, and carrying\r\nit off expeditiously, in spite of all opposition from the adverse party;\r\nor, if that be impossible, throwing it into the hands of a partner, who,\r\nin his turn, exerts his efforts to convey it to his own goal, which is\r\noften three or four miles’ distance. This sport therefore requires a\r\nnimble hand, a quick eye, a swift foot, and skill in wrestling; as well\r\nas strength, good wind, and lungs. Formerly it was practised annually\r\nby those who attended corporate bodies in surveying the bounds of\r\nparishes; but from the many accidents that usually attended that game,\r\nit is now scarcely ever practised. Silver prizes used to be awarded to\r\nthe victor in the games.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cornish Wrestling and the Hug._\r\n\r\nThe mode of wrestling in Cornwall is very different from that of\r\nDevonshire, the former is famous in the “hug,” the latter in kicking\r\nshins. No kicks are allowed in Cornwall, unless the players who are in\r\nthe ring mutually agree to it. A hat is thrown in as a challenge, which\r\nbeing accepted by another, the combatants strip and put on a coarse\r\nloose kind of jacket, of which they take hold, and of nothing else: the\r\nplay then commences. To constitute a fair fall, both shoulders must\r\ntouch the ground, at, or nearly, the same moment. To guard against foul\r\nplay, to decide on the falls, and manage the affairs of the day, four or\r\nsix _sticklers_ (as the umpires are called) are chosen, to whom all\r\nthese matters are left.\r\n\r\nIn the “Cornish hug,” Mr. Polwhele perceived the Greek palæstral\r\nattitudes finely revived; two Cornishmen in the act of wrestling, bear a\r\nclose resemblance to the figures on old gems and coins.\r\n\r\nThe athletic exercise of wrestling thrives in the eastern part of\r\nCornwall, particularly about Saint Austle and Saint Columb. At the\r\nlatter place resides Polkinhorne, the champion of Cornwall, and by many\r\nconsidered to be entitled to the championship of the four western\r\ncounties. He keeps a respectable inn there, is a very good-looking,\r\nthick-set man--still he does not look the man he is--“he has that within\r\nhim that surpasses show.” A contest between him and Cann, the Devonshire\r\nchampion, was expected to take place in the course of this summer; much\r\n“chaffing” passed between them for some time in the country papers, but\r\nit appears to be “no go;” no fault of the Cornish hero, “who was eager\r\nfor the fray”--the Devonshire lad showed the “white feather” it is\r\nacknowledged by all. Polkinhorne has not practised wrestling for several\r\nyears past; while Cann has carried off the prize at every place in Devon\r\nthat he “showed” at. They certainly are both “good ones.” Parkins, a\r\nfriend of the Cornish hero, is a famous hand at these games; and so was\r\nJames Warren, of Redruth, till disabled in February, 1825, by over\r\nexertion on board the Cambria brig, bound for Mexico--the vessel that\r\nsaved the crew and passengers of the Kent East Indiaman. He has been in\r\na very ill state of health ever since; the East India Company and others\r\nhave voted him remuneration, and many of the sufferers have acknowledged\r\ntheir debt of gratitude to him for saving their lives.\r\n\r\nWith a view of maintaining the superiority in amusements in which the\r\nCornish delight, John Knill, Esq. of great eminence at St. Ives,\r\nbequeathed the income of an estate to trustees, that the same might be\r\ndistributed in a variety of prizes, to those who should excel in racing,\r\nrowing, and wrestling. These games he directed should be held every\r\nfifth year for ever, around a mausoleum which he erected in 1782, on a\r\nhigh rock near the town of St. Ives.\r\n\r\nThe first celebration took place in July, 1801, when, according to the\r\nwill of the founder, a band of virgins, all dressed in white, with four\r\nmatrons, and a company of musicians, commenced the ceremony by walking\r\nin pairs to the summit of the hill, where they danced, and chanted a\r\nhymn composed for the purpose round the mausoleum, in imitation of\r\ndruids around the cromlechs of the departed brave. Ten guineas were\r\nexpended in a dinner at the town, of which six of the principal\r\ninhabitants partook. Some idea of the joyous scene may be conceived by\r\nreading an account of an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n“Early in the morning the roads from Helston, Truro, and Penzance were\r\nlined with horses and vehicles of every description, while thousands of\r\ntravellers on foot poured in from all quarters till noon, when the\r\nassembly formed. The wrestlers entered the ring; the troop of virgins,\r\ndressed in white, advanced with solemn step to the notes of harmony; the\r\nspectators ranged themselves along the hills; at length the mayor of St.\r\nIves appeared in his robes of state. The signal was given; the flags\r\nwere displayed in waving splendour from the towers of the castle; the\r\nsight was grand. Here the wrestlers exerted their sinewy strength; there\r\nthe rowers in their various dresses of blue, white, and red, urged the\r\ngilded prows of their boats through the sparkling waves--the dashing of\r\noars--the songs of the virgins--all joined to enliven the picture. The\r\nladies and gentlemen of Penzance returned to an elegant dinner at the\r\nUnion hotel, and a splendid ball concluded the evening entertainments.”\r\n\r\nThese games were again celebrated in 1806, 1811, 1816, and 1821, with\r\nincreased fervour and renewed admiration.\r\n\r\nThe following chorus was sung by the virgins:--\r\n\r\n    Quit the bustle of the bay,\r\n    Hasten, virgins, come away;\r\n    Hasten to the mountain’s brow\r\n    Leave, oh! leave St. Ives below;\r\n    Haste to breathe a purer air,\r\n    Virgins fair, and pure as fair.\r\n    Quit St. Ives and all her treasures,\r\n    Fly her soft voluptuous pleasures;\r\n    Fly her sons, and all the wiles\r\n    Lurking in their wanton smiles\r\n    Fly her splendid midnight-halls,\r\n    Fly the revels of her balls;\r\n    Fly, oh! fly the chosen seat,\r\n    Where vanity and fashion meet.\r\n    Hither hasten; form the ring,\r\n    Round the tomb in chorus sing,\r\n    And on the loft mountain’s brow, aptly dight,\r\n    Just as we should be--all in white,\r\n    Leave all our baskets and our cares below.\r\n\r\nThe celebration of the foregoing game falls in this year, 1826. Should\r\nany thing particular transpire more than the foregoing, you shall hear\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n  SAM SAM’S SON.\r\n\r\n  _July 20, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·70.\r\n\r\n  [267] Friday, July 15, 1757, about seven in the evening, a smart shock\r\n  of an earthquake was felt at Falmouth, attended with great noise,\r\n  which almost every one heard, and saw the windows and things in the\r\n  houses in motion. As the shock did not last above half a minute, the\r\n  people were not sensible what it was till afterwards.

The following notice of its derivation, with\r\nremarks on the tendency of the representation, appeared in the “Times”\r\nthe next morning:--“It is a dramatic resurrection of the story of ‘The\r\nFetches,’ which is to be found in the ‘Tales of the O’Hara Family,’ and\r\nhas been introduced to the stage by Mr. Benham, the author of those\r\ntales. Considering that it is exceedingly difficult, through the medium\r\nof a dramatic entertainment, to impress the minds of an audience with\r\nthose supernatural imaginings, which each individual may indulge in\r\nwhile reading a volume of the mysterious and wonderful, we think Mr.\r\nBenham has manifested considerable adroitness in adapting his novel to\r\nthe stage. We think, at the same time, that his abilities might have\r\nbeen much better employed. The perpetuation of the idea of such absurd\r\nphantasies as fetches and fairies--witches and wizards--is not merely\r\nridiculous, but it is mischievous. There was scarcely a child (and we\r\nobserved many present) who last night witnessed the ‘_fetch_’ or\r\n_double_ of the Gottingen student and his mistress, and who recollects\r\nthe wild glare of Miss Kelly’s eye, (fatuity itself, much less\r\nchildhood, would have marked it,) that will not tremble and shudder when\r\nthe servant withdraws the light from the resting-place of the infant.\r\nSuch scenes cannot be useful to youth; and, leaving the skill of the\r\nactor out of the question, we know not how they can give pleasure to\r\nage. This theatre was ostensibly instituted as a sort of stay and\r\nsupport to legitimate ‘English opera;’ and we feel convinced that one\r\nwell-written English opera, upon the model of the old schooll--that\r\nschool so well described by general Burgoyne, in his preface to his own\r\nexcellent work, ‘The Lord of the Manor,’ would do more credit to the\r\nproprietor of this theatre, and bring more money to his treasury, than\r\n‘a wilderness of _Frankensteins_ and _Fetches_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRightly ordered minds will assent to the observations in the “Times.”\r\nEvery correct thinker, too, is aware that from causes very easily to be\r\ndiscovered, but not necessary to trace, the “regular houses” must adopt\r\ndegrading and mischievous representations or close their doors. Nor is\r\nany accession to our “stock plays” to be expected; for if perchance a\r\npiece of sterling merit were written, its author would be lamentably\r\nignorant of “the business of the stage” were he to think of “offering\r\nit.” The “regular drama” is on its last legs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving the fable of the play of the “Death Fetch” altogether, and\r\nmerely taking its name for the purpose of acquainting the reader with\r\nthe attributes of a “_fetch_,” recourse is had in the outset to the\r\n“Tales of the O’Hara Family.” The notions of such of the good people of\r\nIreland, as believe at this time in that “airy thing,” are set forth\r\nwith great clearness by the author of that work, who is a gentleman of\r\nthe sister kingdom with well-founded claims to distinction, as a man of\r\ngenius and literary ability. The following is extracted preparatory to\r\nother authorities regarding “fetches” in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Tale of the O’Hara Family._\r\n\r\nI was sauntering in hot summer weather by a little stream that now\r\nscarce strayed over its deep and rocky bed, often obliged to glance and\r\ntwine round some large stone, or the trunk of a fallen tree, as if\r\nexerting a kind of animated ingenuity to escape and pursue its course.\r\nIt ran through a valley, receding in almost uniform perspective as far\r\nas the eye could reach, and shut up at its extremity by a lofty hill,\r\nsweeping directly across it. The sides of the valley bore no traces of\r\ncultivation. Briers and furze scantily clothed them; while, here and\r\nthere, a frittered rock protruded its bald forehead through the thin\r\ncopse. No shadow broke or relieved the monotonous sheet of light that\r\nspread over every object. The spare grass and wild bushes had become\r\nparched under its influence; the earth, wherever it was seen bare,\r\nappeared dry and crumbling into dust; the rocks and stones were\r\npartially bleached white, or their few patches of moss burnt black or\r\ndeep red. The whole effect was fiercely brilliant, and so unbroken, that\r\na sparrow could not have hopped, or a grass-mouse raced across, even in\r\nthe distance, without being immediately detected as an intrusion upon\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nThe desertion and silence of the place, sympathized well with its\r\nlethargic features. Not a single cabin met my eye through the range of\r\nthe valley; over head, indeed, the gables of one or two peeped down,\r\nhalf hidden by their sameness of colour with the weather-tanned rocks on\r\nwhich they hung, or with the heather that thatched them; but they and\r\ntheir inmates were obviously unconnected with the solitude in which I\r\nstood, their fronts and windows being turned towards the level country,\r\nand thence the paths that led to them must also have diverged. No moving\r\nthing animated my now almost supernatural picture; no cow, horse, nor\r\nsheep, saunteringly grazed along the margin of my wizard stream. The\r\nvery little birds flew over it, I conveniently thought, with an agitated\r\nrapidity, or if one of them alighted on the shrivelled spray, it was but\r\nto look round for a moment with a keen mistrustful eye; and then bound\r\ninto its fields of air, leaving the wild branch slightly fluttered by\r\nhis action. If a sound arose, it was but what its own whispering waters\r\nmade; or the herdsboy’s whistle faintly echoed from far-off fields and\r\nmeadows; or the hoarse and lonesome caw of the rook, as he winged his\r\nheavy flight towards more fertile places.\r\n\r\nAmid all this light and silence, a very aged woman, wildly habited,\r\nappeared, I know not how, before me. Her approach had not been heralded\r\nby any accompanying noise, by any rustle among the bushes, or by the\r\nsound of a footstep; my eyes were turned from the direction in which she\r\nbecame visible, but again unconsciously recurring to it, fixed on the\r\nstartling figure.\r\n\r\nShe was low in stature, emaciated, and embrowned by age, sun, or toil,\r\nas it might be; her lank white hair hung thickly at either side of her\r\nface; a short red mantle fell loosely to her knees; under it a green\r\npetticoat descended to within some inches of her ankles; and her arms,\r\nneck, head, and feet, were bare. There she remained, at the distance of\r\nonly about twenty yards, her small grey eyes vacantly set on mine; and\r\nher brows strenuously knit, but, as I thought, rather to shadow her\r\nsight from the sun, than with any expression of anger or agitation. Her\r\nlook had no meaning in it; no passion, no subject. It communicated\r\nnothing with which my heart or thought held any sympathy; yet it was\r\nlong, and deep, and unwincing. After standing for some time, as if\r\nspell-bound by her gaze, I felt conscious of becoming uneasy and\r\nsuperstitious in spite of myself; yet my sensation was rather caused by\r\nexcitement than by fear, and saluting the strange visitant, I advanced\r\ntowards her. She stood on a broad slab in the centre of the bed of the\r\nstream, but which was now uncovered by the water. I had to step from\r\nstone to stone in my approach, and often wind round some unusually\r\ngigantic rock that impeded my direct course; one of them was, indeed, so\r\nlarge, that when I came up to it, my view of the old woman was\r\ncompletely impeded. This roused me more: I hastily turned the angle of\r\nthe rock; looked again for her in the place she had stood--but she was\r\ngone.--My eye rapidly glanced round to detect the path she had taken. I\r\ncould not see her.\r\n\r\nNow I became more disturbed. I leaned my back against the rock, and for\r\nsome moments gazed along the valley. In this situation, my eye was again\r\nchallenged by her scarlet mantle glittering in the sunlight, at the\r\ndistance of nearly a quarter of a mile from the spot where she first\r\nappeared. She was once more motionless, and evidently looked at me. I\r\ngrew too nervous to remain stationary, and hurried after her up the\r\nstony bed of the stream.\r\n\r\nA second time she disappeared; but when I gained her second\r\nresting-place, I saw her standing on the outline of the distant\r\nmountain, now dwindled almost to the size of a crow, yet, boldly\r\nrelieved against the back-ground of white clouds, and still manifested\r\nto me by her bright red mantle. A moment, and she finally evaded my\r\nview, going off at the other side of the mountain. This was not to be\r\nborne: I followed, if not courageously, determinedly. By my watch, to\r\nwhich I had the curiosity and presence of mind to refer, it took me a\r\nquarter of an hour to win the summit of the hill; and she, an aged\r\nwoman, feeble and worn, had traversed the same space in much less time.\r\nWhen I stood on the ridge of the hill, and looked abroad over a\r\nwidely-spreading country, unsheltered by forest, thicket, or any other\r\nhiding-place, I beheld her not.\r\n\r\nCabins, or, to use the more poetical name, authorized by the exquisite\r\nbard of “O’Connor’s child,” _sheelings_, were now abundantly strewed\r\naround me, and men, women, and children, at work in the fields, one and\r\nall assured me no such person had, that day, met their notice, and\r\nadded, it was impossible she could have crossed without becoming visible\r\nto them. I never again beheld (excepting in my dreams) that mysterious\r\nvisitant, nor have ever been able to ascertain who or what she was.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken to the peasants, I continued my walk, descending\r\nthe breast of the mountain which faced the valley, but now avoiding the\r\nlatter, and sauntering against the thready current of the stream, with\r\nno other feeling that I can recollect, but an impatience to ascertain\r\nits hidden source. It led me all round the base of the hill. I had a\r\nbook in my pocket, with which I occasionally sat down, in an inviting\r\nsolitude; when tired of it, I threw pebbles into the water, or traced\r\noutlines on the clouds; and the day insensibly lapsed, while I thus\r\nrioted in the utter listlessness of, perhaps, a diseased imagination.\r\n\r\nEvening fell. I found myself, in its deepest shades, once more on the\r\nside of the mountain opposite that which turned towards the valley. I\r\nsat upon a small knoll, surrounded by curves and bumps, wild and\r\npicturesque in their solitude. I was listening to the shrill call of the\r\nplover, which sounded far and faint along the dreary hills, when a vivid\r\nglow of lightning, followed by a clattering thundercrash, roused me from\r\nmy reverie. I was glad to take shelter in one of the cabins, which I\r\nhave described as rather numerously strewed in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe poor people received me with an Irish _cead mille phalteagh_--“a\r\nhundred thousand welcomes”--and I soon sat in comfort by a blazing turf\r\nfire, with eggs, butter, and oaten bread, to serve my need as they\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nThe family consisted of an old couple, joint proprietors of my house of\r\nrefuge; a son and daughter, nearly full grown; and a pale,\r\nmelancholy-looking girl of about twenty years of age, whom I afterwards\r\nunderstood to be niece to the old man, and since her father’s death,\r\nunder his protection. From my continued inquiries concerning my witch of\r\nthe glen, our conversation turned on superstitions generally. With\r\nrespect to the ancient lady herself, the first opinion seemed to\r\nbe--“the Lord only knows what she was:”--but a neighbour coming in, and\r\nreporting the sudden illness of old Grace Morrissy, who inhabited a lone\r\ncabin on the edge of the hill, my anecdote instantly occurred to the\r\nauditory, one and all; and now, with alarmed and questioning eyes, fixed\r\non each other, they concluded I had seen her “fetch:” and determined\r\namongst themselves that she was to die before morning.\r\n\r\nThe “fetch” was not entirely new to me, but I had never before been\r\nafforded so good an opportunity of becoming acquainted with its exact\r\nnature and extent among the Irish peasantry. I asked questions,\r\ntherefore, and gathered some--to me--valuable information.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, a “fetch” is the supernatural fac-simile of some individual,\r\nwhich comes to ensure to its original a happy longevity, or immediate\r\ndissolution; if seen in the morning the one event is predicted; if in\r\nthe evening, the other.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of my questions, and of the tales and remarks to which\r\nthey gave rise, I could observe that the pale, silent girl, listened to\r\nall that was said with a deep, assenting interest: or, sighing\r\nprofoundly, contributed only a few melancholy words of confirmation.\r\nOnce, when she sighed, the old man remarked--“No blame to you, Moggy\r\nmavourneen, fur it’s you that lives to know it well, God help you, this\r\nblessed night.” To these words she replied with another long-drawn\r\naspiration, a look upwards, and an agitation of feature, which roused my\r\ncuriosity, if not my sympathy, in no ordinary degree. I hazarded\r\nqueries, shaped with as much delicacy as I could, and soon learned that\r\nshe had seen, before his death, the “fetch” of her beloved father. The\r\npoor girl was prevailed on to tell her own story; in substance as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nHer father had, for some days, been ill of a fever. On a particular\r\nevening, during his illness, she had to visit the house of an\r\nacquaintance at a little distance, and for this purpose, chose a short\r\ncut across some fields. Scarcely arrived at the stile that led from the\r\nfirst into the second field, she happened to look back, and beheld the\r\nfigure of her father rapidly advancing in her footsteps. The girl’s fear\r\nwas, at first, only human; she imagined that, in a paroxysm, her father\r\nhad broken from those who watched his feverish bed; but as she gazed, a\r\nconsciousness crept through her, and the action of the vision served to\r\nheighten her dread. It shook its head and hand at her in an unnatural\r\nmanner, as if commanding her to hasten on. She did so. On gaining the\r\nsecond stile, at the limit of the second field, she again summoned\r\ncourage to look behind, and again saw the apparition standing on the\r\nfirst stile she had crossed, and repeating its terrible gesticulations.\r\nNow she ran wildly to the cottage of her friend, and only gained the\r\nthreshold when she fainted. Having recovered, and related what she saw,\r\na strong party accompanied her by a winding way, back to her father’s\r\nhouse, for they dared not take that one by which she had come. When they\r\narrived, the old man was a corpse; and as her mother had watched the\r\ndeath-struggle during the girl’s short absence, there could be no\r\nquestion of his not having left his bed in the interim.\r\n\r\nThe man who had come into us, and whom my humble host called “gossip,”\r\nnow took up the conversation, and related, with mystery and pathos, the\r\nappearance to himself of the “fetch” of an only child. He was a widower,\r\nthough a young man, and he wept during the recital. I took a note of his\r\nsimple narrative, nearly in his own words; and a rhyming friend has\r\nsince translated them into metre.\r\n\r\n    The mother died when the child was born,\r\n      And left me her baby to keep;\r\n    I rocked its cradle the night and morn,\r\n      Or, silent, hung o’er it to weep\r\n\r\n    ’Twas a sickly child through its infancy,\r\n      Its cheeks were so ashy pale;\r\n    Till it broke from my arms to walk in glee\r\n      Out in the sharp fresh gale.\r\n\r\n    And then my little girl grew strong,\r\n      And laughed the hours away;\r\n    Or sung me the merry lark’s mountain song,\r\n      Which he taught her at break of day.\r\n\r\n    When she wreathed her hair in thicket bowers,\r\n      With the hedge-rose and hare-bell, blue;\r\n    I called her my May, in her crown of flowers,\r\n      And her smile so soft and new.\r\n\r\n    And the rose, I thought, never shamed her cheek,\r\n      But rosy and rosier made it;\r\n    And her eye of blue did more brightly break,\r\n      Through the blue-bell that strove to shade it.\r\n\r\n    One evening I left her asleep in her smiles,\r\n      And walked through the mountains, lonely;\r\n    I was far from my darling, ah! many long miles,\r\n      And I thought of her, and her only;\r\n\r\n    She darkened my path like a troubled dream,\r\n      In that solitude far and drear;\r\n    I spoke to my child! but she did not seem\r\n      To hearken with human ear;\r\n\r\n    She only looked with a dead, dead eye,\r\n      And a wan, wan cheek of sorrow--\r\n    I knew her “fetch!” she was called to die,\r\n      And she died upon the morrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur young readers are required to observe that these “Tales of the\r\nO’Hara Family” are merely tales, invented to amuse the mind, or create\r\nwonder. Yet things of this sort are still believed by ignorant people,\r\nand in the dark ages they were credited, or affected to be credited, by\r\nthose who ought to have known better. Mr. Brand has heaped together a\r\ngreat many of these superstitions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides general notices of death, certain families were reputed to have\r\nparticular warnings; some by the appearance of a bird, and others by the\r\nfigure of a tall woman in white, who shrieked about the house. This in\r\nIreland is called the _banshee_, or “the shrieking woman.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn some of the great families an admonishing demon or genius was\r\nsupposed to be a visiter. The family of Rothmurchas is alleged to have\r\nhad the _bodack au dun_, “the ghost of the hill;” and the Kinchardines\r\n“the spectre of the bloody hand.” Gartinberg-house was said to have been\r\nhaunted by Bodach Gartin, and Tulloch Gorms by _Maug Monlack_, or “the\r\ngirl with the hairy left hand.”\r\n\r\nThe highlanders, like the Irish, imagined their deaths to have been\r\nforetold by the cries of the _benshi_, or “the fairies’ wife,” along the\r\npaths that their funerals were to take.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Wales--the exhalations in churchyards, called corpse candles, denoted\r\ncoming funerals. Very few of the good people of Carmarthen died without\r\nimagining they saw their corpse candles, or death-lights.\r\n\r\nIn Northumberland, the vulgar saw their _waff_, or “whiff,” as a death\r\ntoken, which is similar to the Scotch _wraith_, or the appearance of a\r\nliving person to himself or others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Scotland, the “fetch” was called the _fye_. It was\r\nobserved to a woman in her ninety-ninth year, that she could not long\r\nsurvive. “Aye,” said she, with great indignation, “what _fye-token_ do\r\nyou see about me?” This is quoted by Brand from the “Statistical Account\r\nof Scotland,” vol. xxi. p. 150; and from the same page he cites an\r\nanecdote to show with what indifference death is sometimes\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nJames Mackie, by trade a wright, was asked by a neighbour for what\r\npurpose he had some fine deal in his barn. “It is timber for my coffin,”\r\nquoth James. “Sure,” replies the neighbour, “you mean not to make your\r\nown coffin. You have neither resolution nor ability for the task.” “Hout\r\naway man,” says James, “if I were once begun, I’ll soon ca’t by hand.”\r\nThe hand, but not the heart, failed him, and he left the task of making\r\nit to a younger operator.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote brought to Mr. Brand’s remembrance what certainly happened\r\nin a village in the county of Durham, where it is the etiquette for a\r\nperson not to go out of the house till the burial of a near relation. An\r\nhonest simple countryman, whose wife lay a corpse in his house, was seen\r\nwalking slowly up the village: a neighbour ran to him, and asked “Where\r\nin heaven, John, are you going?” “To the joiner’s shop,” said poor John,\r\n“to see them make my wife’s coffin; it will be a little diversion for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Cumberland, _wraiths_ are called _swarths_, and in other places\r\n“fetches.” Their business was to appear at the moment preceding the\r\ndeath of the person whose figure they assumed. “Sometimes,” says Brand,\r\n“there is a greater interval between the appearance and the death.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Jamieson, the appearance of the _wraith_ was not to be\r\ntaken as indicating immediate death, “although, in all cases, it was\r\nviewed as a premonition of the disembodied state.” The season of the day\r\nwherein it was seen, was understood to presage the time of the person’s\r\ndeparture. If early in the morning, it was a token of long life and even\r\nold age; if in the evening, it indicated that death was at hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA worthy old lady of exceeding veracity, frequently acquainted the\r\neditor of the _Every-Day Book_ with her supposed superhuman sights. They\r\nwere habitual to her. One of these was of an absent daughter, whom she\r\nexpected on a visit, but who had not arrived, when she left her chamber\r\nto go to a lower part of the house. She was surprised on meeting her on\r\nthe stairs, for she had not heard the street door opened. She expressed\r\nher surprise, the daughter smiled and stood aside to let her mother\r\npass, who naturally as she descended, reached out her hand to rest it\r\non her daughter’s arm as assistance to her step; but the old lady\r\nmistook and fell to the bottom of the stairs. In fact her daughter was\r\nnot there, but at her own home. The old lady lived some years after\r\nthis, and her daughter survived her; though, according to her mother’s\r\nimagination and belief, she ought to have died in a month or two.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1823, the editor of this work being mentally disordered from too\r\nclose application, left home in the afternoon to consult a medical\r\nfriend, and obtain relief under his extreme depression. In Fleet-street,\r\non the opposite side of the way to where he was walking, he saw a pair\r\nof legs devoid of body, which he was persuaded were his own legs, though\r\nnot at all like them. A few days afterwards when worse in health, he\r\nwent to the same friend for a similar purpose, and on his way saw\r\nhimself on precisely the same spot as he had imagined he had seen his\r\nlegs, but with this difference that the person was entire, and\r\nthoroughly a likeness as to feature, form, and dress. The appearance\r\nseemed as real as his own existence. The illusion was an effect of\r\ndisordered imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·20.\r\n\r\n  [268] Mr. Audley.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

During that day he took a sketch of a\r\nvenerable oak at that place, within the trunk of which, according to\r\nWelsh tradition, the body of Howel Sele, a powerful chieftain residing\r\nat Nanneu, was immured by order of his rival Owen Glyndwr. In the night\r\nafter the sketch was taken, this aged tree fell to the ground. An\r\nexcellent etching of the venerable baronet’s drawing by Mr. George Cuitt\r\nof Chester, perpetuates the portrait of this celebrated oak in its last\r\nmoments. The engraving on the next page is a mere extract from this\r\nmasterly etching.\r\n\r\n    It stood alone, a wither’d oak\r\n    Its shadow fled, its branches broke;\r\n    Its riven trunk was knotted round,\r\n    Its gnarled roots o’erspread the ground\r\n    Honours that were from tempests won,\r\n    In generations long since gone,\r\n    A scanty foliage yet was seen,\r\n    Wreathing its hoary brows with green,\r\n    Like to a crown of victory\r\n    On some old warrior’s forehead grey,\r\n    And, as it stood, it seem’d to speak\r\n    To winter winds in murmurs weak,\r\n    Of times that long had passed it by\r\n    And left it desolate, to sigh\r\n    Of what it was, and seem’d to wail,\r\n    A shadeless spectre, shapeless, pale.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Radclife._[269]\r\n\r\nThe charm which compels entrance to Mr. Cuitt’s print within every\r\nportfolio of taste, is the management of his point in the representation\r\nof the beautiful wood and mountain scenery around the tree, to which the\r\neditor of the _Every-Day Book_ would excite curiosity in those who\r\nhappen to be strangers to the etching. But this gentleman’s fascinating\r\nstyle is independent of the immediate object on which he has exercised\r\nit, namely, “the spirit’s Blasted Tree,” an oak of so great fame, that\r\nsir Walter Scott celebrates its awful distinction among the descendants\r\nof our aboriginal ancestors, by the lines of “Marmion,” affixed to the\r\nannexed representation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Ceubren yr Ellyll,~\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT’S BLASTED TREE.]\r\n\r\n    All nations have their omens drear,\r\n    Their legions wild of woe and fear,\r\n    To Cambria look--the peasant see,\r\n    Bethink him of Glendowerdy,\r\n    And shun “the spirit’s Blasted Tree.”\r\n\r\n  _Marmion._\r\n\r\n“The spirit’s Blasted Tree” grew in a picturesque part of Wales,\r\nabounding with local superstitions and memorials of ancient times. At\r\nthe distance of a few miles from the beautiful valley of _Tal y Lyn_,\r\nthe aspect of the country is peculiarly wild. The hills almost meet at\r\ntheir basis, and change their aspect. Instead of verdure, they have a\r\ngeneral rude and savage appearance. The sides are broken into a thousand\r\nforms; some are spiring and sharp pointed; but the greater part project\r\nforward, and impend in such a manner as to render the apprehension of\r\ntheir fall tremendous. A few bushes grow among them, but their dusky\r\ncolour as well as the darkness of the rocks only add horror to the\r\nscene. One of the precipices is called _Pen y Delyn_, from its\r\nresemblance to a harp. Another is styled _Llam y Lladron_, or “the\r\nThieves’ Leap,” from a tradition that thieves were brought there and\r\nthrown down. On the left is the rugged and far-famed height of _Cader\r\nIdris_, and beneath it a small lake called _Llyn y tri Graienyn_, or\r\n“the lake of the Three Grains,” which are three vast rocks tumbled from\r\nthe neighbouring mountain, which the peasants say were “Three Grains”\r\nthat had fallen into the shoe of the great _Idris_, and which he threw\r\nout here, as soon as he felt them hurting his foot.\r\n\r\nFrom thence, by a bad road, Mr. Pennant, in one of his “Tours in Wales,”\r\nreached _Nanneu_. “The way to _Nanneu_ is a continual ascent of two\r\nmiles; and perhaps it is the highest situation of any gentleman’s house\r\nin Britain. The estate is covered with fine woods, which clothe all the\r\nsides of the dingles for many miles.”\r\n\r\nThe continuation of Mr. Pennant’s description brings us to our tree as\r\nhe saw it: “On the road side is a venerable oak in its last stage of\r\ndecay, and pierced by age into the form of a gothic arch; yet its\r\npresent growth is twenty-seven feet and a half. The name is very\r\nclassical, _Derwen Ceubren yr Ellyll_, ‘the hollow oak, the haunt of\r\ndemons.’ How often has not warm fancy seen the fairy tribe revel round\r\nits trunk! or may not the visionary eye have seen the Hamadryad burst\r\nfrom the bark of its coeval tree.”\r\n\r\nThe inscription beneath Mr. Cuitt’s print mentions, that when sir\r\nRichard Colt Hoare sketched this oak, it was within the kitchen-garden\r\nwalls of sir Robert W. Vaughan.\r\n\r\n“Above Nanneu,” Mr. Pennant mentions “a high rock, with the top\r\nincircled with a dike of loose stones: this had been a British post, the\r\nstation, perhaps, of some tyrant, it being called _Moel Orthrwn_, or\r\n‘the Hill of Oppression.’” Mr. Pennant says, the park is “remarkable for\r\nits very small but very excellent venison:” an affirmation which may be\r\ntaken for correct, inasmuch as the tour of an antiquary in such a\r\nregion greatly assists tasteful discrimination. Within the park Mr.\r\nPennant saw “a mere compost of cinders and ashes,” the ruins of the\r\nhouse of Howel Sele, whose body is alleged to have been buried in “the\r\nspirit’s Blasted Tree” by Owen Glyndwr.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwen Glyndwr, or Glendower, is rendered popular in England by the most\r\npopular of our dramatic poets, from whom it may be appropriate to take\r\nthe outlines of his poetical character, in connection with the legend of\r\nHowel Sele’s singular burial.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of Owen Glyndwr, in the works of our great bard, is in\r\n“King Richard II.” by Henry of Lancaster, afterwards king Henry IV.\r\nBefore he passes over into Wales, he says in the camp at Bristol--\r\n\r\n    --------------------- Come lords, away,\r\n    To fight with Glendower and his complices,\r\n    A while to work, and after, holiday.\r\n\r\nThis line relating to Glendower, Theobald deemed an interpolation on\r\nShakspeare, and it has been so regarded by some subsequent commentators.\r\nWe have “Owen Glendower,” however, as one of the dramatis personæ in\r\n“Henry IV.” wherein he is first mentioned by the earl of Westmoreland as\r\n“the irregular and wild Glendower:” king Henry calls him “the great\r\nmagician, damn’d Glendower;” Hotspur terms him “great Glendower;” and\r\nFalstaff tells prince Henry--\r\n\r\n“There’s villainous news abroad--that same mad fellow of the north,\r\nPercy; and he of Wales, that gave Amaimon the bastinado--and swore the\r\ndevil his true liegeman--he is there too; that devil Glendower. Art thou\r\nnot horribly afraid?”\r\n\r\nIn the conference between “Glendower” and his adherents, he says to\r\nHenry Percy:--\r\n\r\n    -------------------Sit good cousin Hotspur:\r\n    For by that name as oft as Lancaster\r\n    Doth speak of you, his cheeks look pale; and, with\r\n    A rising sigh, he wisheth you in heaven.\r\n      _Hot._ And you in hell, as often as he hears\r\n    Owen Glendower spoke of.\r\n      _Glend._ I cannot blame him: at my nativity\r\n    The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\r\n    Of burning cressets; and--at my birth,\r\n    The frame and huge foundation of the earth\r\n    Shak’d like a coward----\r\n    The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes;\r\n    The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds\r\n    Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.\r\n    These signs have mark’d me extraordinary;\r\n    And all the courses of my life do show,\r\n    I am not in the roll of common men.\r\n    Where is he living,--clipp’d in with the sea,\r\n    That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,--\r\n    Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?\r\n    And bring him out, that is but woman’s son,\r\n    Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,\r\n    And hold me pace in deep experiments.--\r\n    I can call spirits from the vasty deep--\r\n    I can teach thee, cousin, to command the devil.\r\n\r\nOn occasion of the chiefs taking leave of their wives, before they\r\nseparate for battle with the king, Glendower gives proof of his\r\nsupernatural powers. The wife of Mortimer proposes to soothe her husband\r\nby singing to him in her native Welsh, if he will repose himself.\r\n\r\n      _Mort._ With all my heart, I’ll sit--\r\n      _Glend._ Do so.\r\n    And those musicians that shall play to you,\r\n    Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence;\r\n    Yet straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.\r\n                                        [_The music plays._\r\n      _Hot._ Now, I perceive, the devil understands Welsh--\r\n    By’r lady, he’s a good musician.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the history of Owen Glyndwr, it may be observed that\r\nhe claimed the throne of Wales, and that the presages which Shakspeare\r\nascribed to his birth, are the legends of old chronicles. Howel Sele, of\r\nNanneu, was his first cousin, yet he adhered to the house of Lancaster,\r\nand was therefore opposed to Owen’s pretensions. The abbot of Cymmer, in\r\nhopes of reconciling them, brought them together, and apparently\r\neffected his purpose. Howel was reckoned the best archer of his day.\r\nOwen while walking out with him observed a doe feeding, and told him\r\nthere was a fine mark for him. Howel bent his bow, and, pretending to\r\naim at the doe, suddenly turned and discharged the arrow full at the\r\nbreast of Glyndwr, who wearing armour beneath his clothes received no\r\nhurt. He seized on Sele for his treachery, burnt his house, and hurried\r\nhim away from the place; nor was it known how he was disposed of till\r\nforty years after, when the skeleton of a large man, such as Howel, was\r\ndiscovered in the hollow of the great oak before described; wherein it\r\nwas supposed Owen had immured him in reward of his perfidy. While Owen\r\nwas carrying him off, his rescue was attempted by his relation Gryffydd\r\nap Geoyn of Ganllwyd in Ardudwy, but he was defeated by Owen with great\r\nloss of men, and his houses of Berthlwyd and Cefn Coch were reduced to\r\nashes.[270]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott to illustrate his lines in “Marmion,” inserts, among\r\nthe notes on that poem, a legendary tale by the rev. George Warrington\r\nwith this preface:--\r\n\r\n“The event, on which this tale is founded, is preserved by tradition in\r\nthe family of the Vaughans of Hengwyrt; nor is it entirely lost, even\r\namong the common people, who still point out this oak to the passenger.\r\nThe enmity between the two Welsh chieftains, Howel Sele and Owen\r\nGlendwr, was extreme, and marked by vile treachery in the one, and\r\nferocious cruelty in the other. The story is somewhat changed and\r\nsoftened, as more favourable to the characters of the two chiefs, and as\r\nbetter answering the purpose of poetry, by admitting the passion of\r\npity, and a greater degree of sentiment in the description. Some trace\r\nof Howel Sele’s mansion was to be seen a few years ago, and may perhaps\r\nbe still visible in the park of Nanneu, now belonging to sir Robert\r\nVaughan, baronet, in the wild and romantic tracts of Merionethshire. The\r\nabbey mentioned passes under two names, Vener and Cymmer. The former is\r\nretained, as more generally used.”\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT’S BLASTED TREE.\r\n\r\n_Ceubren yr Ellyll._\r\n\r\n    Through Nannau’s Chace as Howel passed,\r\n      A chief esteemed both brave and kind,\r\n    Far distant borne, the stag-hound’s cry\r\n      Came murmuring on the hollow wind.\r\n\r\n    Starting, he bent an eager ear,--\r\n      How should the sounds return again?\r\n    His hounds lay wearied from the chace,\r\n      And all at home his hunter train.\r\n\r\n    Then sudden anger flash’d his eye,\r\n      And deep revenge he vowed to take\r\n    On that bold man who dared to force\r\n      His red deer from the forest brake.\r\n\r\n    Unhappy chief! would nought avail,\r\n      No signs impress thy heart with fear,\r\n    Thy lady’s dark mysterious dream,\r\n      Thy warning from the hoary seer?\r\n\r\n    Three ravens gave the note of death,\r\n      As through mid air they winged their way;\r\n    Then o’er his head, in rapid flight,\r\n      They croak,--they scent their destined prey.\r\n\r\n    Ill omened bird! as legends say,\r\n      Who hast the wonderous power to know,\r\n    While health fills high the throbbing veins,\r\n      The fated hour when blood must flow.\r\n\r\n    Blinded by rage alone he passed,\r\n      Nor sought his ready vassals’ aid:\r\n    But what his fate lay long unknown,\r\n      For many an anxious year delayed.\r\n\r\n    A peasant marked his angry eye,\r\n      He saw him reach the lake’s dark bourne,\r\n    He saw him near a blasted oak,\r\n      But never from that hour return.\r\n\r\n    Three days passed o’er, no tidings came;--\r\n      Where should the chief his steps delay?\r\n    With wild alarm the servants ran,\r\n      Yet knew not where to point their way.\r\n\r\n    His vassals ranged the mountain’s height,\r\n      The covert close, and wide-spread plain;\r\n    But all in vain their eager search,\r\n      They ne’er must see their lord again.\r\n\r\n    Yet fancy, in a thousand shapes,\r\n      Bore to his home the chief once more\r\n    Some saw him on high Moel’s top,\r\n      Some saw him on the winding shore.\r\n\r\n    With wonder fraught the tale went round,\r\n      Amazement chained the hearer’s tongue;\r\n    Each peasant felt his own sad loss,\r\n      Yet fondly o’er the story hung.\r\n\r\n    Oft by the moon’s pale shadowy light,\r\n      His aged nurse, and steward grey,\r\n    Would lean to catch the stoned sounds,\r\n      Or mark the flittering spirit stray.\r\n\r\n    Pale lights on Cader’s rocks were seen,\r\n      And midnight voices heard to moan;\r\n    ’Twas even said the blasted oak,\r\n      Convulsive, heaved a hollow groan:\r\n\r\n    And, to this day, the peasant still,\r\n      With cautious fear, avoids the ground;\r\n    In each wild branch a spectre sees,\r\n      And trembles at each rising sound.\r\n\r\n    Ten annual suns had held their course,\r\n      In summer’s smile, or winter’s storm;\r\n    The lady shed the widowed tear,\r\n      As oft she traced his manly form.\r\n\r\n    Yet still to hope her heart would cling\r\n      As o’er the mind illusions play,--\r\n    Of travel fond, perhaps her lord\r\n      To distant lands had steered his way.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas now November’s cheerless hour,\r\n      Which drenching rain and clouds deface;\r\n    Dreary bleak Robell’s tract appeared,\r\n      And dull and dank each valley’s space.\r\n\r\n    Loud o’er the wier the hoarse flood fell,\r\n      And dashed the foamy spray on high;\r\n    The west wind bent the forest tops,\r\n      And angry frowned the evening sky.\r\n\r\n    A stranger passed Llanelltid’s bourne,\r\n      His dark-grey steed with sweat besprent,\r\n    Which, wearied with the lengthened way,\r\n      Could scarcely gain the hill’s ascent.\r\n\r\n    The portal reached,--the iron bell\r\n      Loud sounded round the outward wall\r\n    Quick sprang the warder to the gate,\r\n      To know what meant the clamorous call.\r\n\r\n    “O! lead me to your lady soon;\r\n      Say,--it is my sad lot to tell,\r\n    To clear the fate of that brave knight,\r\n      She long has proved she loved so well.”\r\n\r\n    Then, as he crossed the spacious hall,\r\n      The menials look surprise and fear:\r\n    Still o’er his harp old Modred hung,\r\n      And touched the notes for griefs worn ear.\r\n\r\n    The lady sat amidst her train;\r\n      A mellowed sorrow marked her look:\r\n    Then, asking what his mission meant,\r\n      The graceful stranger sighed and spoke:--\r\n\r\n    “O could I spread one ray of hope,\r\n      One moment raise thy soul from woe,\r\n    Gladly my tongue would tell its tale,\r\n      My words at ease unfettered flow!\r\n\r\n    “Now, lady, give attention due,\r\n      The story claims thy full belief:\r\n    E’en in the worst events of life,\r\n      Suspense removed is some relief.\r\n\r\n    “Though worn by care, see Madoc here,\r\n      Great Glyndwr’s friend, thy kindred’s foe,\r\n    Ah, let his name no anger raise,\r\n      For now that mighty chief lies low.\r\n\r\n    “E’en from the day, when, chained by fate,\r\n      By wizard’s dream or potent spell,\r\n    Lingering from sad Salopia’s field,\r\n      ’Reft of _his_ aid the Percy fell:--\r\n\r\n    “E’en from that day misfortune still,\r\n      As if for violated faith,\r\n    Pursued him with unwearied step\r\n      Vindictive still for Hotspur’s death.\r\n\r\n    “Vanquished at length, the Glyndwr fled\r\n      Where winds the Wye her devious flood;\r\n    To find a casual shelter there,\r\n      In some lone cot, or desert wood.\r\n\r\n    “Clothed in a shepherd’s humble guise,\r\n      He gained by toil his scanty bread;\r\n    He who had Cambria’s sceptre borne,\r\n      And her brave sons to glory led!\r\n\r\n    “To penury extreme, and grief,\r\n      The chieftain fell a lingering prey;\r\n    I heard his last few faultering words,\r\n      Such as with pain I now convey.\r\n\r\n    “‘To Sele’s sad widow bear the tale\r\n      Nor let our horrid secret rest;\r\n    Give but _his_ corse to sacred earth,\r\n      Then may my parting soul be blest.’--\r\n\r\n    “Dim waxed the eye that fiercely shone,\r\n      And faint the tongue that proudly spoke\r\n    And weak that arm, still raised to me,\r\n      Which oft had dealt the mortal stroke.\r\n\r\n    “How could I _then_ his mandate bear\r\n      Or how his last behest obey?\r\n    A rebel deemed, with him I fled;\r\n      With him I shunned the light of day.\r\n\r\n    “Proscribed by Henry’s hostile rage,\r\n      My country lost, despoiled my land,\r\n    Desperate, I fled my native soil,\r\n      And fought on Syria’s distant strand.\r\n\r\n    “O, had thy long lamented lord\r\n      The holy cross and banner viewed,\r\n    Died in the sacred cause! who fell\r\n      Sad victim of a private feud!\r\n\r\n    “Led, by the ardour of the chace,\r\n      Far distant from his own domain;\r\n    From where Garthmaelan spreads her shades,\r\n      The Glyndwr sought the opening plain.\r\n\r\n    “With head aloft, and antlers wide,\r\n      A red buck roused, then crossed in view,\r\n    Stung with the sight, and wild with rage,\r\n      Swift from the wood fierce Howel flew.\r\n\r\n    “With bitter taunt, and keen reproach,\r\n      He, all impetuous, poured his rage,\r\n    Reviled the chief as weak in arms,\r\n      And bade him loud the battle wage.\r\n\r\n    “Glyndwr for once restrained his sword,\r\n      And, still averse, the fight delays;\r\n    But softened words, like oil to fire,\r\n      Made anger more intensely blaze.\r\n\r\n    “They fought; and doubtful long the fray!\r\n      The Glyndwr gave the fatal wound!\r\n    Still mournful must my tale proceed,\r\n      And its last act all dreadful sound.\r\n\r\n    “How could we hope for wished retreat\r\n      His eager vassals ranging wide?\r\n    His bloodhounds’ keen sagacious scent,\r\n      O’er many a trackless mountain tried?\r\n\r\n    “I marked a broad and blasted oak,\r\n      Scorched by the lightning’s livid glare;\r\n    Hollow its stem from branch to root,\r\n      And all its shrivelled arms were bare.\r\n\r\n    “Be this, I cried, his proper grave!--\r\n      (The thought in me was deadly sin.)\r\n    Aloft we raised the hapless chief,\r\n      And dropped his bleeding corpse within.”\r\n\r\n    A shriek from all the damsels burst,\r\n      That pierced the vaulted roofs below,\r\n    While horror-struck the lady stood,\r\n      A living form of sculptured woe.\r\n\r\n    With stupid stare, and vacant gaze,\r\n      Full on his face her eyes were cast,\r\n    Absorbed!--she lost her present grief,\r\n      And faintly thought of things long past.\r\n\r\n    Like wild-fire o’er the mossy heath,\r\n      The rumour through the hamlet ran:\r\n    The peasants crowd at morning dawn,\r\n      To hear the tale,--behold the man.\r\n\r\n    He led them near the blasted oak,\r\n      Then, conscious, from the scene withdrew:\r\n    The peasant’s work with trembling haste,\r\n      And lay the whitened bones to view!--\r\n\r\n    Back they recoiled!--the right hand still,\r\n      Contracted, grasped a rusty sword;\r\n    Which erst in many a battle gleamed,\r\n      And proudly decked their slaughtered lord.\r\n\r\n    They bore the corse to Vener’s shrine,\r\n      With holy rites, and prayers addressed;\r\n    Nine white-robed monks the last dirge sang,\r\n      And gave the angry spirit rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the real history of Howel Sele’s death is to\r\nbe collected from Mr. Pennant’s account of their sudden feud already\r\nrelated; though he by no means distinctly states whether Glyndwr caused\r\nhim to be placed in the oak after he had been slain, or “immured” him\r\nalive and left him to perish. It is rather to be inferred that he was\r\ncondemned by his kinsmen to the latter fate. According to Pennant he\r\nperished in the year 1402, and we see that his living burial place\r\nsurvived him, pierced and hallowed by the hand of time, upwards of four\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR PHILIP SIDNEY’S OAK.\r\n\r\nIn an elegant volume called “_Sylvan Sketches_, a companion to the park\r\nand the shrubbery, with illustrations from the works of the poets by the\r\nauthor of the _Flora Domestica_,” there is a delightful assemblage of\r\npoetical passages on the oak, with this memorial of a very celebrated\r\none:--\r\n\r\n“An oak was planted at Penshurst on the day of sir Philip Sidney’s\r\nbirth, of which Martyn speaks as standing in his time, and measuring\r\ntwenty-two feet round. This tree has since been _felled_, it is said by\r\n_mistake_; would it be impossible to make a similar _mistake_ with\r\nregard to the _mistaker_?\r\n\r\n“Several of our poets have celebrated this tree: Ben Jonson in his lines\r\nto Penshurst, says,--\r\n\r\n    ‘Thou hast thy walks for health as well as sport;\r\n    Thy mount to which thy Dryads do resort,\r\n    Where Pan and Bacchus their high seats have made,\r\n    Beneath the broad beech and the chesnut shade,\r\n    That taller tree which of a nut was set,\r\n    At his great birth where all the muses met.\r\n    There in the writhed bark are cut the names\r\n    Of many a sylvan taken with his flames.’\r\n\r\n“It is mentioned by Waller:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Go, boy, and carve this passion on the bark\r\n    Of yonder tree, which stands the sacred mark\r\n    Of noble Sidney’s birth.’\r\n\r\n“Southey says, speaking of Penshurst--\r\n\r\n    --------‘Sidney here was born.\r\n    Sidney than whom no greater, braver man,\r\n    His own delightful genius ever feigned,\r\n    Illustrating the vales of Arcady\r\n    With courteous courage, and with loyal loves.\r\n    Upon his natal day the acorn here\r\n    Was planted; it grew up a stately oak,\r\n    And in the beauty of its strength it stood\r\n    And flourished, when its perishable part\r\n    Had mouldered dust to dust. That stately oak\r\n    Itself hath mouldered now, but Sidney’s name\r\n    Endureth in his own immortal works.’\r\n\r\n“This tree was frequently called the ‘bare oak,’ by the people of the\r\nneighbourhood, from a resemblance it was supposed to bear to the oak\r\nwhich gave name to the county of Berkshire. Tradition says, that when\r\nthe tenants went to the park gates as it was their custom to do to meet\r\nthe earl of Leicester, when they visited that castle, they used to adorn\r\ntheir hats with boughs from this tree. Within the hollow of its trunk\r\nwas a seat which contained five or six persons with ease and\r\nconvenience.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OAK OF MAMRE.\r\n\r\nWe are told that this oak was standing in the fourth century. Isidore\r\naffirms that when he was a child in the reign of the emperor\r\nConstantius, he was shown a turpentine tree very old, which declared its\r\nage by its bulk, as the tree under which Abraham dwelt; that the\r\nheathens had a surprising veneration for it, and distinguished it by an\r\nhonourable appellation.[271] Some affirm that it existed within the last\r\nfour centuries.\r\n\r\nAt the dispersion of the Jews under Adrian, about the year 134, “an\r\nincredible number of all ages and sexes were sold at the same price as\r\nhorses, in a very famous fair called the fair of the _turpentine tree_:\r\nwhereupon the Jews had an abhorrence for that fair.” St. Jerome mentions\r\nthe place at which the Jews were sold under the name of “Abraham’s\r\ntent;” where, he says, “is kept an annual fair very much frequented.”\r\nThis place “on Mamre’s fertile plains,” is alleged to have been the spot\r\nwhere Abraham entertained the angels.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·50.\r\n\r\n  [269] See this lady’s “Posthumous Works,” vol. iv. _Stonehenge_ stanza\r\n  53, from whence these lines are capriciously altered.\r\n\r\n  [270] Pennant.\r\n\r\n  [271] Bayle, art.

DECLAN.\r\n\r\nThe festival of this saint, who was the first bishop of Ardmore, in the\r\ncounty of Waterford, is held on the twenty-fourth of the month. The\r\nbrief memoir of St. Declan, by Alban Butler, did not seem to require\r\nnotice of him on that day; but the manner wherein the feast was\r\ncelebrated in 1826, is so remarkably particularized in an Irish paper,\r\nas to claim attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ardmore and its Patron._\r\n\r\nSt. Declan is represented to have been the friend and companion of St.\r\nPatrick, and, according to tradition, Ardmore was an episcopal see,\r\nestablished in the fifth century by St. Declan, who was born in this\r\ncounty, and was of the family of the Desii. He travelled for education\r\nto Rome, resided there for some years, was afterwards ordained by the\r\npope, returned to his own country about the year 402, and about that\r\ntime founded the abbey and was made bishop of Ardmore. He lived to a\r\ngreat age; and his successor, St. Ulthan, was alive in the year 550. A\r\nstone, a holy well, and a dormitory, in the churchyard, still bear the\r\nname of St. Declan. “St. Declan’s stone” is on the beach; it is a large\r\nrock, resting on two others, which elevate it a little above the ground.\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of July, the festival of the saint, numbers of the\r\nlowest class do penance on their bare knees around the stone, and some,\r\nwith great pain and difficulty, creep under it, in expectation thereby\r\nof curing or preventing, what it is much more likely to create,\r\nrheumatic affections of the back. In the churchyard is the “dormitory of\r\nSt. Declan,” a small low building, held in great veneration by the\r\npeople in the neighbourhood, who frequently visit it in order to procure\r\nsome of the earth, which is supposed to cover the relics of the\r\nsaint.[273]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of July, 1826, several thousand persons of all ages\r\nand both sexes assembled at Ardmore. The greater part of the extensive\r\nstrand, which forms the western side of the bay, was literally covered\r\nby a dense mass of people. Tents and stands for the sale of whiskey, &c.\r\nwere placed in parallel rows along the shore; the whole at a distance\r\nbore the appearance of a vast encampment. Each tent had its green ensign\r\nwaving upon high, bearing some patriotic motto. One of large dimensions,\r\nwhich floated in the breeze far above the others, exhibited the words\r\n“Villiers Stuart for ever.”\r\n\r\nAt an early hour, those whom a religious feeling had drawn to the spot,\r\ncommenced their devotional exercises by passing under the holy rock of\r\nSt. Declan. The male part of the assemblage were clad in trowsers and\r\nshirts, or in shirts alone; the females, in petticoats pinned above the\r\nknees, and some of the more devout in chemises only. Two hundred and\r\nninety persons of both sexes thus prepared, knelt at one time\r\nindiscriminately around the stone, and passed separately under it to the\r\nother side. This was not effected without considerable pain and\r\ndifficulty, owing to the narrowness of the passage, and the sharpness of\r\nthe rocks. Stretched at full length on the ground on the face and\r\nstomach, each devotee moved forward, as if in the act of swimming, and\r\nthus squeezed or dragged themselves through. Upwards of eleven hundred\r\npersons of both sexes, in a state of half nudity, were observed to\r\nundergo the ceremony in the course of the day. A reverend gentleman, who\r\nstood by part of the time, was heard to exclaim, “O, great is their\r\nfaith.” Several of their reverences passed and re-passed to and from the\r\nchapel close by the “holy rock,” during the day. The “holy rock,” of so\r\ngreat veneration, is believed to be endued with miraculous powers. It\r\nis said to have been wafted from Rome upon the surface of the ocean, at\r\nthe period of St. Declan’s founding his church at Ardmore, and to have\r\nborne on its top a large bell for the church tower, and vestments for\r\nthe saint.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from this sacred memorial, on a cliff overhanging\r\nthe sea, is the well of the saint. Thither the crowds repair after the\r\ndevotions at the rock are ended. Having drank plentifully of its water,\r\nthey wash their legs and feet in the stream which issues from it, and,\r\ntelling their beads, sprinkle themselves and their neighbours with the\r\nfluid. These performances over, the grave of the patron saint is then\r\nresorted to. Hundreds at a time crowded around it, and crush each other\r\nin their eagerness to obtain a handful of the earth which is believed to\r\ncover the mortal remains of Declan. A woman stood breast high in the\r\ngrave, and served out a small portion of its clay to each person\r\nrequiring it, from whom in return she received a penny or halfpenny for\r\nthe love of the saint. The abode of the saint’s earthly remains has sunk\r\nto the depth of nearly four feet, its clay having been scooped away by\r\nthe finger nails of the pious. A human skull of large dimensions was\r\nplaced at the head of the tomb, before which the people bowed, believing\r\nit to be the identical skull of the tutelar saint.\r\n\r\nThis visit to St. Declan’s grave completed the devotional exercises of a\r\nday held in greater honour than the sabbath, by those who venerate the\r\nsaint’s name, and worship at his shrine. The tents which throughout the\r\nday, from the duties paid to the “patron,” had been thronged with the\r\ndevotionalists of the morning, resounded from evening till daybreak,\r\nwith sounds inspired by potations of whiskey; and the scene is so\r\ncharacterised by its reporter as to seem exaggerated.[274]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·65.\r\n\r\n  [273] Ryland’s History of Waterford.\r\n\r\n  [274] Waterford Mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 29.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARTHA.\r\n\r\nOn the festival of this saint of the Romish church, a great fair is held\r\nat Beaucaire, in Languedoc, to which merchants and company resort from\r\na great distance round. It is a great mart for smugglers and contraband\r\ntraders, and is the harvest of the year both to Beaucaire and Tarascon;\r\nfor, as the former is not large enough to accommodate the influx of\r\npeople, Tarascon, in Provence, which is separated from it by the Rhone,\r\nis generally equally full.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTarascon, according to a popular tradition, has its name from a terrible\r\nbeast, a sort of dragon, known by the name of the _tarasque_, which, in\r\nancient days, infested the neighbourhood, ravaging the country, and\r\nkilling every thing that came in its way, both man and beast, and\r\neluding every endeavour made to take and destroy it, till St. Martha\r\narrived in the town, and taking compassion on the general distress, went\r\nout against the monster, and brought him into the town in chains, when\r\nthe people fell upon him and slew him.\r\n\r\nSt. Martha, according to the chronicles of Provence, had fled from her\r\nown country in company with her sister Mary Magdalen, her brother\r\nLazarus, and several other saints both male and female. They landed at\r\nMarseilles, and immediately spread themselves about the country to\r\npreach to the people. It fell to the lot of St. Martha to bend her steps\r\ntowards Tarascon, where she arrived at the fortunate moment above\r\nmentioned. She continued to her dying day particularly to patronise the\r\nplace, and was at her own request interred there. Her tomb is shown in a\r\nsubterranean chapel belonging to the principal church. It bears her\r\nfigure in white marble, as large as life, in a recumbent posture, and is\r\na good piece of sculpture, uninjured by the revolution. In the church a\r\nseries of paintings represent the escape of St. Martha and her\r\ncompanions from their persecutors, their landing in Provence, and some\r\nof their subsequent adventures. She is the patron saint of Tarascon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that the story of a beast ravaging the neighbouring\r\ncountry had its origin in fact; but that instead of a dreadful dragon it\r\nwas a hyena. Bouche, however, in his _Essai sur l’Histoire de Provence_,\r\nwhile he mentions the popular tradition of the dragon, makes no mention\r\nof the supposed hyena, which he probably would have done had there been\r\nany good ground for believing in its existence.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the fabulous story of the dragon was the occasion of\r\nestablishing an annual festival at Tarascon, the reputed origin of which\r\nseems no less fabulous than the story itself. According to the\r\ntradition, the queen, consort to the reigning sovereign of the country,\r\nunaccountably fell into a deep and settled melancholy, from which she\r\ncould not be roused. She kept herself shut up in her chamber, and would\r\nnot see or be seen by any one; medicines and amusements were in vain,\r\ntill the ladies of Tarascon thought of celebrating a festival, which\r\nthey hoped, from its novelty might impress the mind of their afflicted\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nA figure was made to represent the “tarasque,” with a terrible head, a\r\nterrible mouth, with two terrible rows of teeth, wings on its back, and\r\na terrible long tail. At the festival of St. Martha, by whom the\r\n“tarasque” was chained, this figure was led about for eight days\r\nsuccessively, by eight of the principal ladies in the town, elegantly\r\ndressed, and accompanied by a band of music. The procession was followed\r\nby an immense concourse of people, in their holyday clothes; and during\r\nthe progress, alms were collected for the poor. All sorts of gaieties\r\nwere exhibited; balls, concerts, and shows of every kind--nothing, in\r\nshort, was omitted to accomplish the purpose for which the festival was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nAnd her majesty condescended to be amused: that hour her melancholy\r\nceased, and never after returned. Whether the honour of this happy\r\nchange was wholly due to the procession, or whether the saint might not\r\nassist the efforts of the patriotic ladies of Tarascon, by working a\r\nmiracle in favour of the restoration of the queen’s health, is not on\r\nrecord; but her malady never returned; and the people of Tarascon were\r\nso much delighted by the procession of the “tarasque,” that it was\r\ndetermined to make the festival an annual one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis festival was observed till the revolution; but in “the reign of\r\nterror,” the people of Arles, between whom and those of Tarascon a great\r\njealousy and rivalship had for many years subsisted, came in a body to\r\nthe latter place, and, seizing the “tarasque,” burnt it in the\r\nmarket-place. This piece of petty spite sadly chagrined the\r\nTarasconians. Their “tarasque” was endeared to them by its antiquity, as\r\nwell as by the amusement it afforded them. For four years the festival\r\nof the “tarasque” remained uncelebrated, when an attempt was made to\r\nreestablish it; a new “tarasque” was procured by subscription among the\r\npeople; but this also was seized by the Arletins, and carried over the\r\nriver to Beaucaire, where it remained ever since.\r\n\r\n“However,” said a hostess of Tarascon to Miss Plumptre, “since\r\nBuonaparte has happily restored order in France, we are looking forward\r\nto better times, and hope before the next festival of St. Martha, to be\r\npermitted to reclaim our ‘tarasque,’ and renew the procession.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ladies,” she added, “you have no idea how gay and how happy we all\r\nused to be at that time! The rich and the poor, the old and the young,\r\nthe men and the women, all the same! all laughed, all danced, all sung;\r\nthere was not a sad face in the town. The ladies were all so emulous of\r\nleading the ‘tarasque!’ They were all dressed alike; one was appointed\r\nto regulate the dress, and whatever she ordered the rest were obliged to\r\nfollow. Sometimes the dresses were trimmed with gold or silver,\r\nsometimes with lace, so rich, so grand! God knows whether we shall ever\r\nsee such times again. Ah! it was only because we were so happy that the\r\npeople of Arles envied us, and had such a spite against us; but they\r\nhave no reason to envy us now, we have had sorrow enough: ninety-three\r\npersons were guillotined here, and you may think what trouble that has\r\nspread among a number of families. I myself, ladies, have had my share\r\nof sorrow. My husband was not indeed guillotined, but he was obliged to\r\nfly the town to avoid it: he never quitted France, but went about from\r\nplace to place where he was not known, working and picking up a\r\nlivelihood as well as he could; and it is only since Buonaparte has been\r\nfirst consul that he has ventured to return. Besides, every thing that I\r\nhad of any value, my linen, my mattresses, my silver spoons and forks,\r\nwere all taken away by the requisition, and I can only hope to have\r\nthings comfortably about me again by degrees, if we are so lucky as to\r\nget tolerable custom to our inn.” And then she entered upon a long\r\nstring of apologies for the state of her house. “She was afraid,” she\r\nsaid, “that we should find things very uncomfortable, but it was not in\r\nher power to receive ladies and gentlemen as she had been used to do\r\nbefore her misfortunes. A few years hence, if Buonaparte should but\r\nlive, she hoped, if we should happen to pass that way again, we should\r\nsee things in a very different state.”[275]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASON.\r\n\r\n“Now,” we perceive in the “Mirror of the Months,” that, “_now_, on warm\r\nevenings after business hours, citizens of all ages grow romantic; the\r\nsingle, wearing away their souls in sighing to the breezes of\r\nBrixton-hill, and their soles in getting there; and the married, sipping\r\nsyllabub in the arbours of White Conduit-house, or cooling themselves\r\nwith hot rolls and butter at the New River Head.\r\n\r\n“Now, too, moved by the same spirit of romance, young patricians, who\r\nhave not yet been persuaded to banish themselves to the beauty of their\r\npaternal groves, fling themselves into funnies, and fatigue their\r\n_ennui_ to death, by rowing up the river to Mrs. Grange’s garden, to eat\r\na handful of strawberries in a cup-full of cream.\r\n\r\n“Now, adventurous cockneys swim from the Sestos of the Strand stairs to\r\nthe Abydos of the coal-barge on the opposite shore, and believe that\r\nthey have been rivalling Lord Byron and Leander--not without wondering,\r\nwhen they find themselves in safety, why the lady for whom the latter\r\nperformed a similar feat is called the Hero of the story, instead of the\r\nHeroine.\r\n\r\n“Finally,--now pains-and-pleasure-taking citizens hire cozey cottages\r\nfor six weeks certain in the Curtain-road, and ask their friends to come\r\nand see them ‘in the country.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Feast of Cherries._\r\n\r\nThere is a feast celebrated at Hamburg, called the “feast of cherries,”\r\nin which troops of children parade the streets with green boughs,\r\nornamented with cherries, to commemorate a victory, obtained in the\r\nfollowing manner:--In 1432, the Hussites threatened the city of Hamburg\r\nwith an immediate destruction, when one of the citizens, named Wolf,\r\nproposed that all the children in the city, from seven to fourteen years\r\nof age, should be clad in mourning, and sent as supplicants to the\r\nenemy. Procopius Nasus, chief of the Hussites, was so touched with this\r\nspectacle, that he received the young supplicants, regaled them with\r\ncherries and other fruits, and promised them to spare the city.\r\n\r\nThe children returned crowned with leaves, holding cherries, and crying\r\n“victory!”--and hence, the “feast of cherries” is an annual\r\ncommemoration of humane feelings.[276]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE GNAT.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    Native of Ponds!

Through August it continues\r\nwith that of mullets, red surmallets, red gurnards, and several other\r\nfish which abound on our south-west coasts. In Cornwall, fish is so\r\ncheap and so commonly used as an article of food, that we remember so\r\nlately as August, 1804, the then rector of Boconnoc used to have turbot\r\nfor supper, which he considered as a good foundation for a large bowl of\r\nposca, a sort of weak punch drank in that country. Having witnessed on\r\nthis day in 1822, the grand Alpine view of the lake of Geneva, and the\r\nSwiss and Savoyard mountains behind it, from Mount Jura, we are reminded\r\nto present the reader with the following excellent lines which we have\r\nmet with in “Fables, by Thomas Brown, the Younger,” London, 1823.\r\n\r\nVIEW OF THE ALPS AND THE LAKE OF GENEVA FROM THE JURA.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas late, the sun had almost shone\r\n    His last and best, when I ran on,\r\n    Anxious to reach that splendid view\r\n    Before the daybeams quite withdrew;\r\n      And feeling as all feel, on first\r\n    Approaching scenes, where they are told\r\n      Such glories on their eyes shall burst\r\n    As youthful bards in dreams behold.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas distant yet, and as I ran,\r\n      Full often was my wistful gaze\r\n    Turned to the sun, who now began\r\n      To call in all his outpost rays,\r\n    And form a denser march of light,\r\n    Such as beseems a hero’s flight.\r\n\r\n    Oh! how I wished for Joshua’s power\r\n    To slay the brightness of that hour!\r\n      But no, the sun still less became,\r\n    Diminished to a speck, as splendid\r\n      And small as were those tongues of flame\r\n    That on the apostles’ heads descended.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas at this instant, while there glowed\r\n      This last intensest gleam of light,\r\n    Suddenly through the opening road\r\n      The valley burst upon my sight;\r\n    That glorious valley with its lake,\r\n      And Alps on Alps in clusters swelling,\r\n    Mighty and pure, and fit to make\r\n      The ramparts of a godhead’s dwelling.\r\n\r\n    I stood entranced and mute as they\r\n      Of Israel think the assembled world\r\n    Will stand upon the awful day,\r\n      When the ark’s light, aloft unfurled\r\n    Among the opening clouds shall shine,\r\n    Divinity’s own radiant sign!\r\n      Mighty Mont Blanc, thou wert to me\r\n    That minute, with thy brow in heaven,\r\n      As sure a sign of Deity\r\n    As e’er to mortal gaze was given\r\n      Nor ever, were I destined yet\r\n    To live my life twice o’er again,\r\n      Can I the deepfelt awe forget,\r\n    The ecstacy that thrilled me then.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas all the unconsciousness of power\r\n    And life, beyond this mortal hour;\r\n    Those mountings of the soul within\r\n    At thoughts of heaven, as birds begin\r\n    By instinct in the cage to rise,\r\n    When near their time for change of skies;\r\n      That proud assurance of our claim\r\n    To rank among the sons of light,\r\n      Mingled with shame! oh, bitter shame!\r\n    At having risked that splendid right,\r\n    For aught that earth, through all its range\r\n    Of glories, offers in exchange!\r\n\r\n    ’Twas all this, at the instant brought,\r\n    Like breaking sunshine o’er my thought;\r\n      ’Twas all this, kindled to a glow\r\n    Of sacred zeal, which, could it shine\r\n      Thus purely ever, man might grow,\r\n    Even upon earth, a thing divine,\r\n    And be once more the creature made\r\n    To walk unstained the Elysian shade.\r\n\r\n    No, never shall I lose the trace\r\n    Of what I’ve felt in this bright place:\r\n      And should my spirit’s hope grow weak,\r\n    Should I, oh God! e’er doubt thy power,\r\n      This mighty scene again I’ll seek,\r\n    At the same calm and glowing hour;\r\n      And here, at the sublimest shrine\r\n    That nature ever reared to thee,\r\n      Rekindle all that hope divine,\r\n    And feel my immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·80.\r\n\r\n  [275] Miss Plumptre’s Travels in France.\r\n\r\n  [276] Phillips’s Account of Fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n~July 30.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD GATES OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of July, 1760, the materials of the three following city\r\ngates were sold before the committee of city lands to Mr. Blagden, a\r\ncarpenter in Coleman-street, viz.--\r\n\r\n  Aldgate, for   £177 10_s._\r\n  Cripplegate,     91  0\r\n  Ludgate,        148  0[277]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BISHOP OF DURHAM--\r\n\r\nBISHOP AUCKLAND CUSTOM.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _July 30, 1826._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--In the “Times,” of the twenty-second instant, there is the\r\nfollowing paragraph, copied from the Newcastle paper. “The bishop of\r\nDurham arrived at his castle at Bishop Auckland, on Friday last. On his\r\nentering into the county at Croft-bridge, which separates it from the\r\ncounty of York, he was met by the officers of the see, the mayor and\r\ncorporation of Stockton, and several of the principal nobility and\r\nothers of the county. Here a sort of ceremony was performed, which had\r\nits origin in the feudal times,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the ceremony above alluded to is this. About the\r\ncommencement of the fourteenth century, sir John Conyers slew with his\r\n_falchion_ in the fields of Sockburne, a monstrous creature, a dragon, a\r\nworm, or flying serpent, that devoured men, women, and children. The\r\nthen owner of Sockburne, as a reward for his bravery, gave him the manor\r\nwith its appurtenances to hold for ever, on condition that he met the\r\nlord bishop of Durham, with this falchion, on his first entrance into\r\nhis diocese, after his election to that see. And in confirmation of this\r\ntradition, there is painted in a window of Sockburne church, the\r\n_falchion_ just now spoken of; and it is also cut in marble, upon the\r\ntomb of the great ancestor of the Conyers’, together with a dog and the\r\nmonstrous worm or serpent, lying at his feet. When the bishop first\r\ncomes into his diocese, he crosses the river Tees, either at the Ford of\r\nNesham, or Croft-bridge, at one of which places the lord of the manor of\r\nSockburne, or his representative, rides into the middle of the river, if\r\nthe bishop comes by Nesham, with the ancient _falchion_ drawn in his\r\nhand, or upon the middle of Croft-bridge; and then presents it to the\r\nbishop, addressing him in the ancient form of words. Upon which the\r\nbishop takes the _falchion_ into his hands, looks at it, and returns it\r\nback again, wishing the lord of the manor his health and the enjoyment\r\nof his estate.\r\n\r\nThere are likewise some lands at Bishop’s Auckland, called _Pollard’s_\r\nlands, held by a similar service, viz. showing to the bishop one\r\n_fawchon_, at his first coming to Auckland after his consecration. The\r\nform of words made use of is, I believe, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“My Lord,--On behalf of myself as well as of the several other tenants\r\nof _Pollard’s_ lands, I do humbly present your lordship with this\r\n_fawchon_, at your first coming here, wherewith as the tradition goeth,\r\n_Pollard_ slew of old, a great and venomous serpent, which did much harm\r\nto man and beast, and by the performance of this service these lands\r\nare holden.”\r\n\r\nThe drawing of the _falchion_ and tomb in Sockburne church, I have\r\nunfortunately lost, otherwise it should have accompanied this\r\ncommunication: perhaps some of your numerous readers will be able to\r\nfurnish you with it.\r\n\r\n  I remain,\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

The election is held at\r\nthe Bull and Dog public-house, where a dinner is provided; the principal\r\ndishes being bacon and beans, have obtained for it the name of the\r\n“bacon and bean feast.” In the course of the day a procession takes\r\nplace. A cabbage is stuck on a pole and carried instead of a mace,\r\naccompanied by similar substitutes for the other emblems of civic\r\ndignity, and there is, of course, plenty of “rough music.” A “justice”\r\nis chosen at the same time, some other offices are filled up, and the\r\nday ends by all concerned getting completely “how came ye so.”\r\n\r\nIn the same town, a mock mayor and justice are likewise chosen for\r\nNorcutt-lane, but whether on the same day or not I cannot say; how long\r\nthese customs have existed, or whence they originated I do not know;\r\nthey were before I, or the oldest man in the town, can remember.\r\n\r\n  A SHOEMAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASON.\r\n\r\nBy the “Mirror of the Months,” the appearance of natural scenery at this\r\nseason is brought before us. “The corn-fields are all redundant with\r\nwaving gold--gold of all hues--from the light yellow of the oats, (those\r\nwhich still remain uncut,) to the deep sunburnt glow of the red wheat.\r\nBut the wide rich sweeps of these fields are now broken in upon, here\r\nand there, by patches of the parched and withered looking bean crops; by\r\noccasional bits of newly ploughed land, where the rye lately stood; by\r\nthe now darkening turnips--dark, except where they are being fed off by\r\nsheep flocks; and lastly by the still bright-green meadows, now studded\r\nevery where with grazing cattle, the second crops of grass being already\r\ngathered in.\r\n\r\n“The woods, as well as the single timber trees that occasionally start\r\nup with such fine effect from out of the hedge-rows, or in the midst of\r\nmeadows and corn-fields, we shall now find sprinkled with what at first\r\nlooks like gleams of scattered sunshine lying among the leaves, but\r\nwhat, on examination, we shall find to be the new foliage that has been\r\nput forth since midsummer, and which yet retains all the brilliant green\r\nof the spring. The effect of this new green, lying in sweeps and patches\r\nupon the old, though little observed in general, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful and characteristic appearances of this season. In many cases,\r\nwhen the sight of it is caught near at hand, on the sides of thick\r\nplantations, the effect of it is perfectly deceptive, and you wonder for\r\na moment how it is, that while the sun is shining so brightly _every\r\nwhere_, it should shine so much _more_ brightly on those particular\r\nspots.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ears are fill’d, the fields are white,\r\n    The constant harvest-moon is bright\r\n    To grasp the bounty of the year,\r\n    The reapers to the scene repair,\r\n    With hook in hand, and bottles slung,\r\n    And dowlas-scrips beside them hung.\r\n    The sickles stubble all the ground,\r\n    And fitful hasty laughs go round;\r\n    The meals are done as soon as tasted,\r\n    And neither time nor viands wasted.\r\n    All over--then, the barrels foam--\r\n    The “Largess”-cry, the “Harvest-home!”\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nThe “Mirror of the Months” likens August to “that brief, but perhaps\r\nbest period of human life, when the promises of youth are either\r\nfulfilled or forgotten, and the fears and forethoughts connected with\r\ndecline have not yet grown strong enough to make themselves felt; and\r\nconsequently when we have nothing to do but look around us, and be\r\nhappy.” For it is in this month that the year “like a man at forty, has\r\nturned the corner of its existence; but, like him, it may still fancy\r\nitself young, because it does not begin to feel itself getting old. And\r\nperhaps there is no period like this, for encouraging and bringing to\r\nperfection that habit of tranquil enjoyment, in which all true happiness\r\nmust mainly consist: with _pleasure_ it has, indeed, little to do; but\r\nwith _happiness_ it is every thing.”\r\n\r\nThe author of the volume pursues his estimate by observing, that “August\r\nis that debateable ground of the year, which is situated exactly upon\r\nthe confines of summer and autumn; and it is difficult to say which has\r\nthe better claim to it. It is dressed in half the flowers of the one,\r\nand half the fruits of the other; and it has a sky and a temperature all\r\nits own, and which vie in beauty with those of the spring. May itself\r\ncan offer nothing so sweet to the senses, so enchanting to the\r\nimagination, and so soothing to the heart, as that genial influence\r\nwhich arises from the sights, the sounds, and the associations,\r\nconnected with an August evening in the country, when the occupations\r\nand pleasures of the day are done, and when all, even the busiest, are\r\nfain to give way to that ‘wise passiveness,’ one hour of which is rife\r\nwith more real enjoyment than a whole season of revelry. Those who will\r\nbe wise (or foolish) enough to make comparisons between the various\r\nkinds of pleasure of which the mind of man is capable, will find that\r\nthere is none (or but one) equal to that felt by a true lover of nature,\r\nwhen he looks forth upon her open face silently, at a season like the\r\npresent, and drinks in that still beauty which seems to emanate from\r\nevery thing he sees, till his whole senses are steeped in a sweet\r\nforgetfulness, and he becomes unconscious of all but that _instinct of\r\ngood_ which is ever present with us, but which can so seldom make itself\r\nfelt amid that throng of thoughts which are ever busying and besieging\r\nus, in our intercourse with the living world. The only other feeling\r\nwhich equals this, in its intense quietude, and its satisfying fulness,\r\nis one which is almost identical with it,--where the accepted lover is\r\ngazing unobserved, and almost unconsciously, on the face of his\r\nmistress, and tracing their sweet evidences of that mysterious union\r\nwhich already exists between them.\r\n\r\n“The whole face of nature has undergone, since last month, an obvious\r\nchange; obvious to those who delight to observe all her changes and\r\noperations, but not sufficiently striking to insist on being seen\r\ngenerally by those who can read no characters but such as are written in\r\na _text_ hand. If the general _colours_ of all the various departments\r\nof natural scenery are not changed, their _hues_ are; and if there is\r\nnot yet observable the infinite variety of autumn, there is as little\r\nthe extreme monotony of summer. In one department, however, there _is_ a\r\ngeneral change, that cannot well remain unobserved. The rich and\r\nunvarying green of the corn-fields has entirely and almost suddenly\r\nchanged to a still richer and more conspicuous gold colour; more\r\nconspicuous on account of the contrast it now offers to the lines,\r\npatches, and masses of green with which it every where lies in contact,\r\nin the form of intersecting hedge-rows, intervening meadows, and\r\nbounding masses of forest. These latter are changed too; but in _hue_\r\nalone, not in colour. They are all of them still green; but it is not\r\nthe fresh and tender green of the spring, nor the full and satisfying,\r\nthough somewhat dull, green of the summer; but many greens, that blend\r\nall those belonging to the seasons just named, with others at once more\r\ngrave and more bright; and the charming variety and interchange of which\r\nare peculiar to this delightful month, and are more beautiful in their\r\ngeneral effect than those of either of the preceding periods: just as a\r\ntruly beautiful woman is perhaps more beautiful at the period\r\nimmediately before that at which her charms begin to wane, than she ever\r\nwas before. Here, however, the comparison must end; for with the year\r\nits incipient decay is the signal for it to put on more and more\r\nbeauties daily, till, when it reaches the period at which it is on the\r\npoint of sinking into the temporary death of winter, it is more\r\nbeautiful in general appearance than ever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 1.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMMAS DAY.\r\n\r\nThough the origin of this denomination is related in vol. i. col. 1063,\r\nyet it seems proper to add that _Lammas_ or _Lambmas_ day obtained its\r\nname from a mass ordained to St. Peter, supplicating his benediction on\r\nlambs, in shearing season, to preserve them from catching cold. St Peter\r\nbecame patron of lambs, from Christ’s metaphorical expression, “Feed my\r\nlambs,” having been construed into a literal injunction.[278] Raphael\r\nmakes this misconstruction the subject of one of his great cartoons, by\r\nrepresenting Christ as speaking to Peter, and pointing to a flock of\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lammas Towers in Mid-Lothian._\r\n\r\nThere was a Lammas festival, which prevailed in the Lothians from very\r\nearly times among the young persons employed during summer in tending\r\nthe herds at pasture. The usage is remarkable.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the herdsmen within a certain district, towards the\r\nbeginning of summer, associated themselves into bands, sometimes to the\r\nnumber of a hundred or more. Each of these communities agreed to build a\r\n_tower_ in some conspicuous place, near the centre of their district,\r\nwhich was to serve as the place of their rendezvous on Lammas day. This\r\ntower was usually built of sods; for the most part square, about four\r\nfeet in diameter at the bottom, and tapering to a point at the top,\r\nwhich was seldom above seven or eight feet from the ground. In building\r\nit, a hole was left in the centre for admitting a flag-staff, on which\r\nto display their colours. The tower was usually begun to be built about\r\na month before Lammas, and was carried up slowly by successive additions\r\nfrom time to time, being seldom entirely completed till a few days\r\nbefore Lammas; though it was always thought that those who completed\r\ntheir’s soonest, and kept it standing the longest time before Lammas,\r\nbehaved in the most gallant manner, and acquired most honour by their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the foundation of the tower was laid, it became an\r\nobject of care and attention to the whole community; for it was reckoned\r\na disgrace to suffer it to be defaced; so that they resisted, with all\r\ntheir power, any attempts that should be made to demolish it, either by\r\nforce or fraud; and, as the honour that was acquired by the demolition\r\nof a tower, if affected by those belonging to another, was in proportion\r\nto the disgrace of suffering it to be demolished, each party\r\nendeavoured to circumvent the other as much as possible, and laid plans\r\nto steal upon the tower unperceived, in the night time, and level it\r\nwith the ground. Great was the honour that such a successful exploit\r\nconveyed to the undertakers; and, though the tower was easily rebuilt,\r\nand was soon put into its former state, yet the news was quickly spread\r\nby the successful adventurers, through the whole district, which filled\r\nit with shouts of joy and exultation, while their unfortunate neighbours\r\nwere covered with shame. To ward off this disgrace, a constant nightly\r\nguard was kept at each tower, which was made stronger and stronger, as\r\nthe tower advanced; so that frequent nightly skirmishes ensued at these\r\nattacks, but were seldom of much consequence, as the assailants seldom\r\ncame in force to make an attack in this way, but merely to succeed by\r\nsurprise; as soon, therefore, as they saw they were discovered, they\r\nmade off in the best manner they could.\r\n\r\nTo give the alarm on these, and other occasions, every person was armed\r\nwith a “tooting horn;” that is, a horn perforated in the small end,\r\nthrough which wind can be forcibly blown from the mouth, so as to\r\noccasion a loud sound; and, as every one wished to acquire as great\r\ndexterity as possible in the use of the “tooting horn,” they practised\r\nupon it during the summer, while keeping their beasts; and towards\r\nLammas they were so incessantly employed at this business, answering to,\r\nand vying with each other, that the whole country rang continually with\r\nthe sounds; and it must no doubt have appeared to be a very harsh and\r\nunaccountable noise to a stranger who was then passing through it.\r\n\r\nAs the great day of Lammas approached, each community chose one from\r\namong themselves for their captain, and they prepared a stand of colours\r\nto be ready to be then displayed. For this purpose, they usually\r\nborrowed a fine table napkin of the largest size, from some of the\r\nfarmer’s wives within the district; and, to ornament it, they borrowed\r\nribbons, which they tacked upon the napkin in such fashion as best\r\nsuited their fancy. Things being thus prepared, they marched forth early\r\nin the morning on Lammas day, dressed in their best apparel, each armed\r\nwith a stout cudgel, and, repairing to their tower, there displayed\r\ntheir colours in triumph; blowing horns, and making merry in the best\r\nmanner they could. About nine o’clock they sat down upon the green; and\r\neach taking from his pocket, bread and cheese, or other provisions, made\r\na hearty breakfast, drinking pure water from a well, which they always\r\ntook care should be near the scene of banquet.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, scouts were sent out towards every quarter, to bring\r\nthem notice if any hostile party approached; for it frequently happened,\r\nthat on that day the herdsmen of one district went to attack those of\r\nanother district, and to bring them under subjection to them by main\r\nforce. If news were brought that a hostile party approached, the horns\r\nsounded to arms, and they immediately arranged themselves in the best\r\norder they could devise; the stoutest and boldest in front, and those of\r\ninferior prowess behind. Seldom did they wait the approach of the enemy,\r\nbut usually went forth to meet them with a bold countenance, the captain\r\nof each company carrying the colours, and leading the van. When they\r\nmet, they mutually desired each other to lower their colours in sign of\r\nsubjection. If there appeared to be a great disproportion in the\r\nstrength of the parties, the weakest usually submitted to this ceremony\r\nwithout much difficulty, thinking their honour was saved by the evident\r\ndisproportion of the match; but, if they were nearly equal in strength,\r\nnone of them would yield, and it ended in blows, and sometimes\r\nbloodshed. It is related, that, in a battle of this kind, four were\r\nactually killed, and many disabled from work for weeks.\r\n\r\nIf no opponent appeared, or if they themselves had no intention of\r\nmaking an attack, at about mid-day they took down their colours, and\r\nmarched with horns sounding, towards the most considerable village in\r\ntheir district; where the lasses, and all the people, came out to meet\r\nthem, and partake of their diversions. Boundaries were immediately\r\nappointed, and a proclamation made, that all who intended to compete in\r\nthe race should appear. A bonnet ornamented with ribbons was displayed\r\nupon a pole, as a prize to the victor; and sometimes five or six started\r\nfor it, and ran with as great eagerness as if they had been to gain a\r\nkingdom; the prize of the second race was a pair of garters, and the\r\nthird a knife. They then amused themselves for some time, with such\r\nrural sports as suited their taste, and dispersed quietly to their\r\nrespective homes before sunset.\r\n\r\nWhen two parties met, and one of them yielded to the other, they marched\r\ntogether for some time in two separate bodies, the subjected body behind\r\nthe other; and then they parted good friends, each performing their\r\nraces at their own appointed place. Next day, after the ceremony was\r\nover, the ribbons and napkin that formed the colours, were carefully\r\nreturned to their respective owners, the tower was no longer a matter of\r\nconsequence, and the country returned to its usual state of tranquility.\r\n\r\nThe above is a faithful account of this singular ceremony which was\r\nannually repeated in all the country, within the distance of six miles\r\nwest from Edinburgh, about thirty years before Dr. Anderson wrote, which\r\nwas in the year 1792. How long the custom prevailed, or what had given\r\nrise to it, or how far it had extended on each side, he was uninformed.\r\nHe says, “the name of Lammas-towers will remain, (some of them having\r\nbeen built of stone,) after the celebration of the festival has ceased.\r\nThis paper will at least preserve the memory of what was meant by them.\r\nI never could discover the smallest traces of this custom in\r\nAberdeenshire, though I have there found several towers of stone, very\r\nlike the Lammas-towers of this country; but these seem to have been\r\nerected without any appropriated use, but merely to look at. I have\r\nknown some of those erected in my time, where I knew for certain that no\r\nother object was intended, than merely to amuse the persons who erected\r\nthem.”[279]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COBBLERS’ FESTIVAL AT PARIS ON THE FIRST OF AUGUST, 1641.\r\n\r\nA rare old “broadside” in French, printed at the time, with a large and\r\ncurious wood-cut at the head, now before the editor, describes a feast\r\nof the cobblers of Paris in a burlesque manner, from whence he proposes\r\nto extract some account of their proceedings as closely as may be to the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, it is proper to observe that the wood engraving, on the\r\nnext page, is a fac-simile of one third, and by far the most interesting\r\nportion of the original.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Festival of the Cobblers of Paris, August 1, 1641.~]\r\n\r\nThe entire occupation of the preceding page by a cut, which is the first\r\nof the kind in the _Every-Day Book_, may startle a few readers, but it\r\nmust gratify every person who regards it either as a faithful transcript\r\nof the most interesting part of a very rare engraving, or as a\r\nrepresentation of the mode of feasting in the old pot-houses of Paris.\r\n\r\nNothing of consequence is lost by the omission of the other part of the\r\nengraving; for it is merely a crowd of smaller figures, seated at the\r\ntable, eating and drinking, or reeling, or lying on the floor\r\ninebriated. The only figure worth notice, is a man employed in turning a\r\nspit, and he has really so lack-a-daisical an appearance, that it seems\r\nworth while to give the top corner of the print in fac-simile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe perceive from the page-cut that at the period when the original was\r\nexecuted, the French landlords “chalked up the score” as ours do, and\r\nthat cobblers had music at their dinners as well as their betters. The\r\nband might not be so complete, but it was as good as they could get, and\r\nthe king and his nobles could not have more than money could procure.\r\nThe two musicians are of some consideration, as well suited to the\r\nscene; nor is the mendicant near them to be disregarded; he is only a\r\nlittle more needy, and, perhaps, a little less importunate than certain\r\nsuitors for court favours. The singer who accompanies himself on the\r\nguitar at the table, is tricked out with a standing ruff and ruffles,\r\nand ear-rings, and seems a “joculator” of the first order;--and laying\r\naside his dress, and the jaunty set of his hat, which we may almost\r\nimagine had been a pattern for a recent fashion, his face of “infinite\r\nhumour” would distinguish him any where. However rudely the characters\r\nare cut, they are well discriminated. The serving man, with a spur on\r\none foot and without a shoe on the other, who pours wine into a glass,\r\nis evidently a person--\r\n\r\n    “contented in his station\r\n    who minds his occupation.”\r\n\r\nVandyke himself could scarcely have afforded more grace to a countess,\r\nthan the artist of the feast has bestowed on a cobbler’s wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the French of the author who drew up the account referring to the\r\nengraving, we learn that on the first day of August, 1641, the “Society\r\nof the Trade of Cobblers,” met in solemn festival (as, he observes, was\r\ntheir custom) in the church of St. Peters of Arsis, where, after having\r\nbestowed all sorts of praises on their patron, they divided their\r\nconsecrated bread between them, with which not one third of them was\r\nsatisfied; for while going out of the church they murmured, while the\r\nothers chuckled.\r\n\r\nAfter interchanging the reciprocal honours, they were accustomed to pay\r\nto each other, (which we may fairly presume to have been hard blows,)\r\nmany of the most famous of their calling departed to a pot-house, and\r\nhad a merry-making. They had all such sorts of dishes at their dinner as\r\ntheir purses would afford; particularly a large quantity of turnip-soup,\r\non account of the number of persons present; and as many ox-feet and\r\nfricasees of tripe, as all the tripe-shops of the city and its suburbs\r\ncould furnish, with various other dishes which the reporter says he does\r\nnot choose to name, lest he should give offence to the fraternity. He\r\nmentions cow-beef, however, as one of the delicacies, and hints at their\r\nexcesses having disordered their stomachs and manners. He speaks of some\r\nof them having been the masters, and of others as more than the masters,\r\nfor they denominated themselves _Messieurs le Jurez_, of their\r\nhonourable calling. He further says, that to know the whole history of\r\ntheir assembly, you must go to Gentily, at the sign of St. Peter, where,\r\nwhen at leisure, they all play together at bowls. He adds, that it is\r\nnot necessary to describe them all, because it is not the custom of this\r\nhighly indispensable fraternity to do kindness, and they are always\r\nindignant at strong reproaches.\r\n\r\nFinally, he says, “I pray God to turn them from their wickedness.” He\r\nsubjoins a song which he declares if you read and sing, will show he has\r\ntold the truth, and that you will be delighted with it. He alleges, that\r\nhe drew it up to make you better acquainted with the scene represented\r\nin the wood-cut, in order that you might be amused and laugh. Whether it\r\nhad that tendency cannot be determined, for unluckily the song, which no\r\ndoubt was the best part, has perished from the copy of the singular\r\npaper now described.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMMAS DAY\r\n\r\n_Exeter Lammas Fair._\r\n\r\nThe charter for this fair is perpetuated by a glove of immense size,\r\nstuffed and carried through the city on a very long pole, decorated with\r\nribbons, flowers, &c. and attended with music, parish beadles, and the\r\nmobility. It is afterwards placed on the top of the Guildhall, and then\r\nthe fair commences; on the taking down of the glove, the fair\r\nterminates.\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIPPON LAMMAS FEAST.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--If the following sketch of St. Wilfrid’s life, as connected with\r\nhis feast at Rippon, be thought sufficiently interesting for insertion,\r\nyou will oblige an old contributor.\r\n\r\nThe town of Rippon owes its rise to the piety of early times, for we\r\nfind that Eata, abbot of Melross and Lindisfarne, in the year 661\r\nfounded a monastery there, for which purpose he had lands given him by\r\nAlchfrid, at that time king of Deira, and afterwards of the\r\nNorthumbrians; but before the building was completed, the Scottish monks\r\nretired from the monastery, and St. Wilfrid was appointed abbot in 663,\r\nand soon afterwards raised to the see of York. This prelate was then in\r\nhigh favour with Oswy and Egfrid, kings of Northumberland, and the\r\nprincipal nobility, by whose liberality he rose to such a degree of\r\nopulence as to vie with princes, and enable him to build several rich\r\nmonasteries; but his great pomp and immense wealth having drawn upon him\r\nthe jealousy of the king and the archbishop of Canterbury, he was\r\nexiled. After an absence of ten years he was allowed to return to his\r\nsee, and died in the monastery of Oundle in 711, aged seventy-six, and\r\nwas interred there. In 940, his remains were removed to Canterbury, by\r\nOdo, archbishop of that see. Amongst all the miracles recorded of\r\nWilfrid by the author of his life,[280] one, if true, was very\r\nextraordinary, and would go far to convert the most obdurate pagan. It\r\nis said, that at this time, God so blessed the holy man’s endeavours\r\ntowards the propagation of the faith, that, on a solemn day for\r\nbaptizing some thousands of the people of Sussex, the ceremony was no\r\nsooner ended but the heavens distilled such plentiful showers of rain,\r\nthat the country was relieved by it from the most prodigious famine ever\r\nheard of. So great was the drought, and provision so scarce, that, in\r\nthe extremity of hunger, fifty at a time joined hand in hand and flung\r\nthemselves into the sea, in order to avoid the death of famine by land.\r\nBut by Wilfrid’s means their bodies and souls were preserved.\r\n\r\nThe town of Rippon continues to this day to honour the memory of its\r\nbenefactor by an annual feast. On the Saturday following Lammas-day, the\r\neffigy of St. Wilfrid is brought into the town with great ceremony,\r\npreceded by music, when the people go out to meet it in commemoration of\r\nthe return of their favourite saint and patron from exile. The following\r\nday called St. Wilfrid’s Sunday is dedicated to him. On the Monday and\r\nTuesday there are horse-races for small sums only; though formerly there\r\nwere plates of twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty pounds.[281]\r\n\r\nThe following is a literal copy of part of an advertisement from the\r\n“Newcastle Courant” August 28, 1725.\r\n\r\n  “TO BE RUN FOR. The usual four miles’ course on Rippon Common, in the\r\n  county of York, according to articles. On Monday the thirteenth of\r\n  September a purse of twenty guineas by any horse, mare, or gelding\r\n  that was no more than five years old the last grass, to be certified\r\n  by the breeder, each horse to pay two guineas entrance, run three\r\n  heats, the usual four miles’ course for a heat, and carry nine stone,\r\n  besides saddle and bridle. On Tuesday the fourteenth, THE LADY’S PLATE\r\n  of fifteen pounds’ value by any horse, &c. _Women_ to be the riders:\r\n  each to pay one guinea entrance, three heats, and twice about the\r\n  common for a heat.”\r\n\r\nDuring the feast of St. Wilfrid, which continues nearly all the week,\r\nthe inhabitants of Rippon enjoy the privilege of rambling through the\r\ndelightful grounds of “Studley Royal,” the seat of Mrs. Laurence, a lady\r\nremarkable for her amiable character and bounty to the neighbouring\r\npoor. On St. Wilfrid’s day the gates of this fairy region are thrown\r\nopen, and all persons are allowed to wander where they please.\r\n\r\nNo description can do justice to the exuberant distribution of nature\r\nand art which surrounds one on every side on entering these beautiful\r\nand enchanting grounds; the mind can never cease to wonder, nor the eye\r\ntire in beholding them.\r\n\r\nThe grounds consist of about three hundred acres, and are laid out with\r\na taste unexcelled in this country. There is every variety of hill and\r\ndale, and a judicious introduction of ornamental buildings with a number\r\nof fine statues; among them are Hercules and Antæus, Roman wrestlers,\r\nand a remarkably fine dying gladiator. The beauties of this terrestrial\r\nparadise would fill a volume, but the chief attraction is the grand\r\nmonastic ruin of Fountain’s abbey. This magnificent remain of olden time\r\nis preserved with the utmost care by the express command of its owner,\r\nand is certainly the most perfect in the kingdom. It is seated in a\r\nromantic dale surrounded by majestic oaks and firs. The great civility\r\nof the persons appointed to show the place, is not the least agreeable\r\nfeeling on a visit to Studley Royal.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. J. A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSENTERS’ FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\nThe first of August, as the anniversary of the death of queen Anne, and\r\nthe accession of George I., seems to have been kept with rejoicing by\r\nthe dissenters. In the year 1733, they held a great meeting in London,\r\nand several other parts of the kingdom to celebrate the day, it being\r\nthat whereon the “schism bill” was to have taken place if the death of\r\nthe queen had not prevented it. If this bill had passed into a law,\r\ndissenters would have been debarred the liberty of educating their own\r\nchildren.[282]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGGET’S COAT AND BADGE.\r\n\r\nAlso in honour of this day there is a rowing match on the river Thames,\r\ninstituted by Thomas Dogget an old actor of celebrity, who was so\r\nattached to the Brunswick family, that sir Richard Steele called him “a\r\nwhig up to the head and ears.”\r\n\r\nIn the year after George I. came to the throne, Dogget gave a waterman’s\r\ncoat and silver badge to be rowed for by six watermen on the first day\r\nof August, being the anniversary of that king’s accession to the throne.\r\nThis he continued till his death, when it was found that he had\r\nbequeathed a certain sum of money, the interest of which was to be\r\nappropriated annually, for ever, to the purchase of a like coat and\r\nbadge, to be rowed for in honour of the day by six young watermen whose\r\napprenticeships had expired the year before. This ceremony is every year\r\nperformed on the first of August, the claimants setting out, at a signal\r\ngiven, at that time of the tide when the current is strongest against\r\nthem, and rowing from the Old Swan, near London-bridge, to the White\r\nSwan at Chelsea.[283]\r\n\r\nBroughton, who was a waterman, before he was a prize-fighter, won the\r\nfirst coat and badge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis annual rowing-match is the subject of a ballad-opera, by Charles\r\nDibdin, first performed at the Haymarket, in 1774, called “The Waterman,\r\nor the First of August.” In this piece Tom Tugg, a candidate for\r\nDogget’s coat and badge, sings the following, which was long a popular\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n    And did you not hear of a jolly young waterman,\r\n      Who at Blackfriars-bridge used for to ply;\r\n    And he feather’d his oars with such skill and dexterity,\r\n      Winning each heart and delighting each eye:\r\n    He looked so neat, and rowed so steadily,\r\n    The maidens all flocked in his boat so readily,\r\n    And he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air,\r\n    That this waterman ne’er was in want of a fare.\r\n\r\n    What sights of fine folks he oft row’d in his wherry!\r\n      ’Twas clean’d out so nice, and so painted withal;\r\n    He was always first oars when the fine city ladies,\r\n      In a party to Ranelagh went, or Vauxhall:\r\n    And oftentimes would they be giggling and leering,\r\n    But ’twas all one to Tom, their gibing and jeering,\r\n    For loving, or liking, he little did care,\r\n    For this waterman ne’er was in want of a fare.\r\n\r\n    And yet, but to see how strangely things happen,\r\n      As he row’d along, thinking of nothing at all,\r\n    He was plied by a damsel so lovely and charming,\r\n      That she smiled, and so straightway in love he did fall;\r\n    And, would this young damsel but banish his sorrow,\r\n    He’d wed her to-night before to-morrow:\r\n    And how should this waterman ever know care,\r\n    When he’s married and never in want of a fare?\r\n\r\nTom Tug wins Dogget’s coat and badge under the eyes of his mistress, who\r\nsits with her friends to see the rowing-match from an inn window\r\noverlooking the river; and, with the prize, he wins her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGGET.\r\n\r\nColley Cibber calls Dogget “a prudent, honest man,” and relates\r\nanecdotes highly to our founder’s honour. One of them is very\r\ncharacteristic of Dogget’s good sense and firmness.\r\n\r\nThe lord chamberlain was accustomed to exercise great power over actors.\r\nIn king William’s reign he issued an order that no actor of either\r\ncompany should presume to go from one to the other without a discharge,\r\nand the lord chamberlain’s permission; and messengers actually took\r\nperformers who disobeyed the edict into custody. Dogget was under\r\narticles to play at Drury-lane, but conceiving himself treated unfairly,\r\nquitted the stage, would act no more, and preferred to forego his\r\ndemands rather than hazard the tediousness and danger of the law to\r\nrecover them. The manager, who valued him highly, resorted to the\r\nauthority of the lord chamberlain. “Accordingly upon his complaint, a\r\nmessenger was immediately despatched to Norwich, where Dogget then was,\r\nto bring him up in custody. But doughty Dogget, who had money in his\r\npocket, and the cause of liberty at his heart, was not in the least\r\nintimidated by this formidable summons. He was observed to obey it with\r\na particular cheerfulness, entertaining his fellow-traveller, the\r\nmessenger, all the way in the coach (for he had protested against\r\nriding) with as much humour as a man of his business might be capable of\r\ntasting. And, as he found his charges were to be defrayed, he, at every\r\ninn, called for the best dainties the country could afford, or a\r\npretended weak appetite could digest. At this rate they jollily rolled\r\non, more with the air of a jaunt than a journey, or a party of pleasure\r\nthan of a poor devil in durance. Upon his arrival in town, he\r\nimmediately applied to the lord chief justice Holt for his _habeas\r\ncorpus_. As his case was something particular, that eminent and learned\r\nminister of the law took a particular notice of it: for Dogget was not\r\nonly discharged, but the process of his confinement (according to common\r\nfame) had a censure passed upon it in court.”\r\n\r\n“We see,” says Cibber, “how naturally power, only founded on custom, is\r\napt, where the law is silent, to run into excesses; and while it\r\nlaudably pretends to govern others, how hard it is to govern\r\nitself.”[284]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nScarcely any thing is known of this celebrated performer, but through\r\nCibber, with whom he was a joint patentee in Drury-lane theatre. They\r\nsometimes warmly differed, but Cibber respected his integrity and\r\nadmired his talents. The accounts of Dogget in “Cibber’s Apology,” are\r\nexceedingly amusing, and the book is now easily accessible, for it forms\r\nthe first volume of “Autobiography, a collection of the most instructive\r\nand amusing lives written by the parties themselves;”--a work printed in\r\nan elegant form, and published at a reasonable price, and so arranged\r\nthat every life may be purchased separately.\r\n\r\nCibber says of Dogget, “He was a golden actor.--He was the most an\r\noriginal, and the strictest observer of nature, of all his\r\ncontemporaries. He borrowed from none of them; his manner was his own;\r\nhe was a pattern to others, whose great merit was, that they had\r\nsometimes tolerably imitated him. In dressing a character to the\r\ngreatest exactness he was remarkably skilful; the least article of\r\nwhatever habit he wore, seemed in some degree to speak and mark the\r\ndifferent humour he presented; a necessary care in a comedian, in which\r\nmany have been too remiss or ignorant. He could be extremely ridiculous\r\nwithout stepping into the least impropriety to make him so. His greatest\r\nsuccess was in characters of lower life, which he improved from the\r\ndelight he took in his observations of that kind in the real world.

His last words were, “We are all going to\r\nheaven, and Vandyke is of the party.” He was buried, by his own desire,\r\nnear his friend Kirby, the author of the Treatise on “Perspective,” in\r\nthe grave-yard of Kew chapel.\r\n\r\nGainsborough was born at Sudbury, in Suffolk, in 1727, where his father\r\nwas a clothier, and nature the boy’s teacher. He passed his mornings in\r\nthe woods alone; and in solitary rambles sketched old trees, brooks, a\r\nshepherd and his flock, cattle, or whatever his fancy seized on. After\r\npainting several landscapes, he arrived in London and received\r\ninstructions from Gravelot and Hayman: he lived in Hatton-Garden,\r\nmarried a lady with 200_l._ a year went to Bath, and painted portraits\r\nfor five guineas, till the demand for his talent enabled him gradually\r\nto raise the price to a 100_l._ He settled in Pall-mall in 1774, with\r\nfame and fortune.\r\n\r\nGainsborough, while at Bath, was chosen a member of the Royal Academy on\r\nits institution, but neglected its meetings. Sir Joshua Reynolds says,\r\n“whether he most excelled in portraits, landscapes, or fancy pictures,\r\nit is most difficult to determine.” His aërial perspective is uncommonly\r\nlight and beautiful. He derived his grace and elegance from nature,\r\nrather than manners; and hence his paintings are inimitably true and\r\nbewitching. Devoted to his art, he regretted leaving it; just before his\r\ndeath, he said, “he saw his deficiences, and had endeavoured to remedy\r\nthem in his last works.”\r\n\r\nNo object was too mean for Gainsborough’s pencil; his habit of closely\r\nobserving things in their several particulars, enabled him to perceive\r\ntheir relations to each other, and combine them. By painting at night,\r\nhe acquired new perceptions: he had eyes and saw, and he secured every\r\nadvantage he discovered. He etched three plates; one for “Kirby’s\r\nPerspective;” another an oak tree with gypsies; and the third, a man\r\nploughing on a rising ground, which he spoiled in “biting in:” the print\r\nis rare.\r\n\r\nIn portraits he strove for natural character, and when this was\r\nattained, seldom proceeded farther. He could have imparted intelligence\r\nto the features of the dullest, but he disdained to elevate what nature\r\nhad forbidden to rise; hence, if he painted a butcher in his\r\nSunday-coat, he made him, as he looked, a respectable yeoman; but his\r\nlikenesses were chiefly of persons of the first quality, and he\r\nmaintained their dignity. His portraits are seldom highly finished, and\r\nare not sufficiently estimated, for the very reason whereon his\r\nreputation for natural scenery is deservedly high. Sir Joshua gave\r\nGainsborough one hundred guineas for a picture of a girl and pigs,\r\nthough its artist only required sixty.[285]\r\n\r\nGainsborough had what the world calls eccentricities. They resulted\r\nrather from his indulgence in study, than contempt for the usages of\r\nsociety. It was well for Gainsborough that he could disregard the\r\ncourtesies of life without disturbance to his happiness, from those with\r\nwhom manners are morals.\r\n\r\nA series of “Studies of Figures” from Gainsborough’s “Sketch Books,” are\r\nexecuted in lithography, in exact imitation of his original drawings by\r\nMr. Richard Lane. Until this publication, these drawings were unknown.\r\nMr. Lane’s work is to Gainsborough, what the prints in Mr. Otley’s\r\n“Italian School of Design,” are to Raphael and Michael Angelo. Each\r\nprint is so perfect a fac-simile, that it would be mistaken for the\r\noriginal drawing, if we were not told otherwise. This is the way to\r\npreserve the reputation of artists. Their sketches are often better than\r\ntheir paintings; the elaboration of a thought tends to evaporate its\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·95.\r\n\r\n  [285] Pilkington.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 3.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nMichael Adanson, an eminent naturalist of Scottish extraction, born in\r\nApril, 1727, at Aix, in Provence, died at Paris on the third of August,\r\n1806. Needham, at one of his examinations, presented Adanson, then a\r\nchild, with a microscope, and the use of the instrument gave the boy a\r\nbias to the science which he distinguished as a philosopher. His parents\r\ndestined him for the church, and obtained a prebend’s stall for him, but\r\nhe abandoned his seat, made a voyage to Senegal in 1757, and published\r\nthe result of his labours in a natural history of that country. This\r\nobtained him the honour of corresponding member in the Academy of\r\nSciences. In 1763, his “Famille des Plantes” appeared; it was followed\r\nby a design of an immense general work, which failed from Louis XV.,\r\nwithholding his patronage. He formed the project of a settlement on the\r\nAfrican coast for raising colonial produce without negro slavery, which\r\nthe French East India company refused to encourage: he refused to\r\ncommunicate his plan to the English, who, after they had become martyrs\r\nof Senegal, applied for it to Adanson, through lord North. He declined\r\ninvitations from the courts of Spain and Russia, and managed as well as\r\nhe could with pensions derived from his office of royal censor, his\r\nplace in the academy, and other sources inadequate to the expense of\r\nforming his immense collections. He was reduced to poverty by the\r\nrevolution. The French invited him to join it as a member; he answered,\r\n“he had no shoes.” This procured him a small pension, whereon he\r\nsubsisted till his death.[286]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo early as thirteen years of age, Adanson began to write notes on the\r\nnatural histories of Aristotle and Pliny; but soon quitted books to\r\nstudy nature. He made a collection of thirty-three thousand existences,\r\nwhich he arranged in a series of his own. This was the assiduous labour\r\nof eight years. Five years spent at Senegal, gave him the opportunity of\r\naugmenting his catalogue. He extended his researches to subjects of\r\ncommercial utility, explored the most fertile and best situated\r\ndistricts of the country, formed a map of it, followed the course of the\r\nNiger, and brought home with him an immense collection of observations,\r\nphilosophical, political, moral, and economical, with an addition to his\r\ncatalogue of about thirty thousand hitherto unknown species, which, with\r\nhis former list, and subsequent additions brought the whole number to\r\nmore than ninety thousand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of Adanson’s “Families des Plantes,” is founded upon the\r\nprinciple, “that if there is in nature a system which we can detect, it\r\ncan only be founded on the totality of the relations of characters,\r\nderived from all the parts and qualities of plants.” His labours are too\r\nmanifold to be specified, but their magnitude may be conceived from his\r\nhaving laid before the academy, in 1773, the plan of his “Universal\r\nNatural Encyclopædia,” consisting of one hundred and twenty manuscript\r\nvolumes, illustrated by seventy-five thousand figures, in folio. In\r\n1776, he published in the “Supplement of the first Encyclopædia,” by\r\nDiderot and D’Alembert, the articles relative to natural history and the\r\nphilosophy of the sciences, comprised under the letters A. B. C. In\r\n1779, he journied over the highest mountains in Europe, whence he\r\nbrought more than twenty thousand specimens of different minerals, and\r\ncharts of more than twelve hundred leagues of country. He was the\r\npossessor of the most copious cabinet in the world.\r\n\r\nAdanson’s first misfortune from the revolution was the devastation of\r\nhis experimental garden, in which he had cultivated one hundred and\r\nthirty kinds of mulberry to perfection; and thus the labour of the best\r\npart of his life was overthrown in an instant. One privation succeeded\r\nanother, till he was plunged in extreme indigence, and prevented from\r\npursuing his usual studies for want of fire and light. “I have found him\r\nin winter (says his biographer) at nine in the evening, with his body\r\nbent, his head stooped to the floor, and one foot placed upon another,\r\nbefore the glimmering of a small brand, writing upon this new kind of\r\ndesk, regardless of the inconvenience of an attitude which would have\r\nbeen a torment to any one not excited by the most inconceivable habit of\r\nlabour, and inspired with the ecstacy of meditation.”\r\n\r\nAdanson’s miserable condition was somewhat alleviated by the minister\r\nBenezech; but another minister, himself a man of letters, Francois de\r\nNeufchateau, restored Adanson to the public notice, and recommended him\r\nto his successors. The philosopher, devoted to his studies, and\r\napparently little fitted for society, sought neither patron nor\r\nprotector; and indeed he seems never to have been raised above that\r\npoverty, which was often the lot of genius and learning in the stormy\r\nperiod of the revolution. His obligations to men in power were much less\r\nthan to a humbler benefactor, whose constant and generous attachment\r\ndeserves honourable commemoration. This was Anne-Margaret-Roux, the wife\r\nof Simon Henry, who, in 1783, at the age of twenty-eight, became the\r\ndomestic of Adanson, and from that time to his death, stood in the place\r\nto him of relations, friends, and fortune. During the extremity of his\r\ndistress, when he was in want of every necessary, she waited upon him\r\nduring the day, and passed the night, without his knowledge, in labours,\r\nthe wages of which she employed in the purchase of coffee and sugar,\r\nwithout which he could do nothing. At the same time, her husband, in the\r\nservice of another master in Picardy, sent every week bread, meat, and\r\nvegetables, and even his savings in money, to supply the other wants of\r\nthe philosopher. When Adanson’s accumulated infirmities rendered the\r\ncares of the wife insufficient, Simon Henry came and assisted her, and\r\nno more quitted him.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his residence at Senegal, Adanson was exceedingly\r\nsensible of cold and humidity; and from inhabiting a ground floor,\r\nwithout cellars, in one of the lowest streets in Paris, he was\r\ncontinually labouring under rheumatic affections. The attitude in which\r\nhe read and wrote, which was that of his body bent in an arm-chair, and\r\nhis legs raised high on each side of the chimney-place, contributed to\r\ndeposit humours upon his loins, and the articulations of his thighs.\r\nWhen he had again got a little garden, he used to pass whole days before\r\nhis plants, sitting upon his crossed legs; and he often forgot, in the\r\nardour of study, to go to bed. This mode of life occasioned an osseous\r\ndisease in the right thigh. In January, 1806, as he was standing by his\r\nfire, he perceived his thigh bend, and would have fallen, had he not\r\nbeen supported by his devoted domestic. He was put to bed, the limb was\r\nreplaced, and he was attended with the utmost assiduity by the faithful\r\npair, who even tore up their own linen for his dressings. Except his\r\nsurgeon, they were the only human beings he saw during the last six\r\nmonths of his life--a proof how little he had cultivated friendship\r\namong his equals. Napoleon informed of his wretched situation, sent him\r\nthree thousand livres, which his two attendants managed with the\r\ngreatest fidelity. Whilst confined to his bed, he continued his usual\r\noccupation of reading and writing, and was seen every morning with the\r\npen in his hand, writing without spectacles, in very small characters,\r\nat arm’s length. The powers of his understanding were entire when he\r\nexpired.[287]\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·25.\r\n\r\n  [286] General Biography, vol. i. 17.\r\n\r\n  [287] Dr. Aikin’s Athenæum.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG BOWLS.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of August, 1739, a farmer of Croydon undertook for a\r\nconsiderable wager, to bowl a skittle-bowl from that town to\r\nLondon-bridge, about eleven miles, in 500 times, and performed it in\r\n445.[288]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·72.\r\n\r\n  [288] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 5.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

His family came into England with the Conqueror,\r\nand flourished in Northampton and Warwickshire. He was second son to sir\r\nRichard Bray, a privy counsellor to king Henry VI. In the first year of\r\nRichard III. Reginald had a general pardon, for having adhered, it is\r\npresumed, to Henry VI. He favoured the advancement of the earl of\r\nRichmond to the throne as Henry VII., who made him a knight banneret,\r\nprobably on Bosworth field. At this king’s coronation he was created a\r\nknight of the bath, and afterwards a knight of the garter.\r\n\r\nSir Reginald Bray was a distinguished statesman and warrior. He served\r\nat the battle of Blackheath in 1497, on the Cornish insurrection under\r\nlord Audley, part of whose estates he acquired by grant. He was\r\nconstable of Oakham castle in Rutlandshire, joint chief justice of the\r\nforests south of Trent, high steward of the university of Oxford,\r\nchancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and high treasurer. Distinguished\r\nby the royal favour, he held the Isle of Wight for his life at an annual\r\nrent of three hundred marks, and died possessed of large estates, under\r\na suspicious sovereign who extorted large sums from his subjects when\r\nthere was very little law to control the royal will. His administration\r\nwas so just as to procure him the title of “the father of his country.”\r\nTo his skill in architecture we are indebted for the most eminent\r\necclesiastical ornament of the metropolis--the splendid chapel founded\r\nby Henry in his lifetime at Westminster; and he conducted the chapel of\r\nSt. George, at Windsor palace, to its completion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·47.\r\n\r\n  [289] See the supper scene in “Don Giovanni,”--also the Irishman’s\r\n  joke of eating the oysters and taking his master the shells.

He was aged forty-four, and buried the tenth of August,\r\n1626: the ambassadour himselfe, young Shawsware his sonne, and many\r\nother Persians (with many expressions of their infinite love and sorrow)\r\nfollowing him to the ground betweene eight and nine of the clocke in the\r\nmorning. The rites and ceremonies that (with them) are done to the dead,\r\nwere chiefly performed by his sonne, who, sitting crosse-legged at the\r\nnorth end of the grave, (for his tombe stands north and south,) did one\r\nwhile reade, another while sing; his reading and singing intermixt\r\nsighing and weeping: and this, with other things that were done in the\r\ngrave in private (to prevent with the sight the relation) continued\r\nabout halfe an houre.\r\n\r\n“But this was but this dayes businesse: for, as this had not beene\r\nenough to performe to their friend departed, to this place and to this\r\nend (that is, prayer, and other funerall devotions) some of them came\r\nevery morning and evening at sixe and sixe, for the space of a moneth\r\ntogether; and had come (as it was then imagined) the whole time of their\r\nabode here in England, had not the rudenesse of our people disturbed and\r\nprevented their purpose.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·69.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 11.~\r\n\r\n_Dog Days end._\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS.\r\n\r\nClouds are defined to be a collection of vapours suspended in the\r\natmosphere, and rendered visible.\r\n\r\nAlthough it be generally allowed that clouds are formed from the aqueous\r\nvapours, which before were so closely united with the atmosphere as to\r\nbe invisible, it is not easy to account for the long continuance of some\r\nvery opaque clouds without dissolving; or to assign the reason why the\r\nvapours, when they have once begun to condense, do not continue to do so\r\ntill they at last fall to the ground in the form of rain or snow, &c. It\r\nis now known that a separation of the latent heat from the water, of\r\nwhich vapour is composed, is attended with a condensation of that vapour\r\nin some degree; in such case it will first appear as a smoke, mist, or\r\nfog; which, if interposed between the sun and earth, will form a cloud;\r\nand the same causes continuing to operate, the cloud will produce rain\r\nor snow. It is however abundantly evident that some other cause beside\r\nmere heat or cold is concerned in the formation of clouds, and the\r\ncondensation of atmospherical vapours. This cause is esteemed in a\r\ngreat measure the electrical fluid; indeed electricity is now so\r\ngenerally admitted as an agent in all the great operations of nature,\r\nthat it is no wonder to find the formation of clouds attributed to it;\r\nand this has accordingly been given by Beccaria as the cause of the\r\nformation of all clouds whatsoever, whether of thunder, rain, hail, or\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nBut whether the clouds are produced, that is, the atmospheric vapours\r\nrendered visible, by means of electricity or not, it is certain that\r\nthey do often contain the electric fluid in prodigious quantities, and\r\nmany terrible and destructive accidents have been occasioned by clouds\r\nvery highly electrified. The most extraordinary instance of this kind\r\nperhaps on record, happened in the island of Java, in the East Indies,\r\nin August, 1772. On the eleventh of that month, at midnight, a bright\r\ncloud was observed covering a mountain in the district called Cheribon,\r\nand several reports like those of a gun were heard at the same time. The\r\npeople who dwelt upon the upper parts of the mountain not being able to\r\nfly fast enough, a great part of the cloud, eight or nine miles in\r\ncircumference, detached itself under them, and was seen at a distance,\r\nrising and falling like the waves of the sea, and emitting globes of\r\nfire so luminous, that the night became as clear as day. The effects of\r\nit were astonishing; every thing was destroyed for twenty miles round;\r\nthe houses were demolished; plantations were buried in the earth; and\r\ntwo thousand one hundred and forty people lost their lives, besides one\r\nthousand five hundred head of cattle, and a vast number of horses,\r\ngoats, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _height_ of the clouds is not usually great: the summits of high\r\nmountains being commonly quite free from them, as many travellers have\r\nexperienced in passing these mountains. It is found that the most highly\r\nelectrified clouds descend lowest, their height being often not more\r\nthan seven or eight hundred yards above the ground; and sometimes\r\nthunderclouds appear actually to touch the ground with one of their\r\nedges; but the generality of clouds are suspended at the height of a\r\nmile, or little more, above the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _motions_ of the clouds, though often directed by the wind, are not\r\nalways so, especially when thunder is about to ensue. In this case they\r\nare seen to move very slowly, or even to appear quite stationary for\r\nsome time. The reason of this probably is, that they are impelled by two\r\nopposite streams of air nearly of equal strength; and in such cases it\r\nseems that both the aërial currents ascend to a considerable height; for\r\nMessrs. Charles and Robert, when endeavouring to avoid a thunder cloud,\r\nin one of their aërial voyages with a balloon, could find no alteration\r\nin the course of the current, though they ascended to the height of four\r\nthousand feet above the earth. In some cases the motions of the clouds\r\nevidently depend on their electricity, independent of any current of air\r\nwhatever. Thus, in a calm and warm day, small clouds are often seen\r\nmeeting each other in opposite directions, and setting out from such\r\nshort distances, that it cannot be supposed that any opposite winds are\r\nthe cause. Such clouds, when they meet, instead of forming a larger one,\r\nbecome much smaller, and sometimes quite vanish; a circumstance most\r\nprobably owing to the discharge of opposite electricities into each\r\nother. And this serves also to throw some light on the true cause of the\r\nformation of clouds; for if two clouds, the one electrified positively,\r\nand the other negatively, destroy each other on contact, it follows that\r\nany quantity of vapour suspended in the atmosphere, while it retains its\r\nnatural quantity of electricity, remains invisible, but becomes a cloud\r\nwhen electrified either plus or minus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _shapes_ of the clouds are probably owing to their electricity; for\r\nin those seasons in which a great commotion has been excited in the\r\natmospherical electricity, the clouds are seen assuming strange and\r\nwhimsical shapes, that are continually varying. This, as well as the\r\nmeeting of small clouds in the air, and vanishing upon contact, is a\r\nsure sign of thunder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _uses_ of the clouds are evident, as from them proceeds the rain\r\nthat refreshes the earth, and without which, according to the present\r\nstate of nature, the whole surface of the earth must become a mere\r\ndesert. They are likewise useful as a screen interposed between the\r\nearth and the scorching rays of the sun, which are often so powerful as\r\nto destroy the grass and other tender vegetables. In the more secret\r\noperations of nature too, where the electric fluid is concerned, the\r\nclouds bear a principal share; and chiefly serve as a medium for\r\nconveying that fluid from the atmosphere into the earth, and from the\r\nearth into the atmosphere: in doing which, when electrified to a great\r\ndegree, they sometimes produce very terrible effects; an instance of\r\nwhich is related above.[292]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·35.\r\n\r\n  [292] Dr. Hutton.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 12.~\r\n\r\n\r\nK. GEORGE IV. BORN.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of August, 1761, the princess Charlotte of\r\nMecklinburgh Strelitz, embarked with her attendants at Cuxhaven, on\r\nboard the royal yacht, under the salute of a squadron destined to convey\r\nher to England, as the affianced bride of his majesty George III. On the\r\ntwenty-eighth, she sailed, and after that day, no despatches were\r\nreceived until she arrived at Harwich, on the sixth of September.\r\n\r\nThe court was in some concern lest the tediousness of her voyage might\r\nhave affected her health; but her highness, during her tedious passage,\r\ncontinued in very good health and spirits, often diverting herself with\r\nplaying on the harpsichord, practising English tunes, and endearing\r\nherself to those who were honoured with the care of her person. She had\r\nbeen twice in sight of the British coast, and as often driven off by\r\ncontrary winds; one day in hopes of landing on English ground, and the\r\nnext in danger of being driven to the coasts of Norway. Her arrival,\r\ntherefore, was a desirable event; but as it was night when she came to\r\nHarwich, her highness slept on board, and continued there till three in\r\nthe afternoon the next day, during which time her route had been\r\nsettled, and instructions received as to the manner of her proceeding to\r\nSt. James’s.\r\n\r\nAt her landing, she was received by the mayor and aldermen of Harwich,\r\nin their usual formalities. About five o’clock she came to Colchester,\r\nand stopped at the house of Mr. Enew, where she was received and waited\r\nupon by Mrs. Enew and Mrs. Rebow; but captain Best attended her with\r\ncoffee, and lieutenant John Seaber with tea. Being thus refreshed, she\r\nproceeded to Witham, where she arrived at a quarter past seven, and\r\nstopped at lord Abercorn’s, and his lordship provided as elegant an\r\nentertainment for her as the time would admit. During supper, the door\r\nof the room was ordered to stand open, that every body might have the\r\npleasure of seeing her highness, and on each side of her chair stood the\r\nlords Harcourt and Anson. She slept that night at his lordship’s house.\r\n\r\nA little after twelve o’clock next day, her highness came to Romford,\r\nwhere the king’s coach and servants met her; and after stopping to drink\r\ncoffee at Mr. Dutton’s where she was waited upon by the king’s servants,\r\nshe entered the king’s coach. The attendants of her highness were in\r\nthree other coaches. In the first were some ladies of Mecklenburgh, and\r\nin the last was her highness, who sat forward, and the duchess of\r\nAncaster and Hamilton backward.\r\n\r\nOn the road she was extremely courteous to every body, showing herself,\r\nand bowing to all who seemed desirous of seeing her, and ordering the\r\ncoach to go extremely slow through the towns and villages as she passed,\r\nthat as many as would might have a full view of her. The carriages were\r\nattended by an incredible number of spectators, both on horse and foot,\r\nto Stratford-le-Bow and Mile-end, where they turned up Dog-row, and\r\nprosecuted their journey to Hackney turnpike, then by Shoreditch church,\r\nand up Old-street to the City-road, across Islington, along the New-road\r\ninto Hyde-park, down Constitution-hill into St. James’s park, and then\r\nto the garden-gate of the palace, where she was received by all the\r\nroyal family. She was handed out of the coach by the duke of York, and\r\nmet in the garden by his majesty, who in a very affectionate manner\r\nraised her up and saluted her, as she was going to pay her obeisance,\r\nand then led her into the palace, where she dined with his majesty, the\r\nprincess dowager, and the princess Augusta. After dinner her highness\r\nwas pleased to show herself with his majesty in the gallery and other\r\napartments fronting the park.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o’clock in the evening, the procession began to the\r\nchapel-royal. Her highness was attended by six dukes’ daughters as\r\nbride-maids; her train was supported by the daughters of six earls, and\r\nshe was preceded by one hundred and twenty ladies in extremely rich\r\ndresses, who were handed into the chapel by the duke of York. The\r\nmarriage ceremony was performed by the archbishop of Canterbury. The\r\nduke of Cumberland gave the princess’s hand to his majesty, and,\r\nimmediately on the joining of their hands, the park and tower guns were\r\nfired. There was afterwards a public drawing-room; but no one was\r\npresented. The metropolis was illuminated, and there were the utmost\r\npublic demonstrations of joy.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the ninth of September, there was the most\r\nbrilliant court at St. James’s ever remembered.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council of\r\nLondon, waited on their majesties and the princess dowager of Wales,\r\nwith their addresses of congratulation. On the same day the chancellor\r\nand university of Cambridge presented the university address, and in the\r\nevening, about a quarter after six, their majesties went to Drury-lane\r\ntheatre in chairs, and most of the royal family in coaches, to see the\r\n“Rehearsal;” they were attended by the horse guards. The theatre was\r\nfull almost as soon as the doors were opened. Of the vast multitude\r\nassembled, not a fiftieth part gained admission. Never was seen so\r\nbrilliant a house; the ladies were mostly dressed in the clothes and\r\njewels they wore at the royal marriage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of August, 1762, at twenty-four minutes after seven, an\r\nheir apparent to the throne afterwards king George IV., was born. The\r\narchbishop of Canterbury was in the room, and certain great officers of\r\nstate in a room adjoining, with the door open into the queen’s\r\napartment. The person who waited on the king with the news, received a\r\npresent of a five hundred pound bank bill.[293]\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, congratulatory addresses flowed in on their majesties\r\nfrom every part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe quakers’ address was presented to his majesty on the first of\r\nOctober, and read by Dr. Fothergill, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _George the Third, king of Great Britain, and the dominions thereunto\r\n  belonging._\r\n\r\n  _The humble address of his Protestant subjects, the people called\r\n  Quakers._\r\n\r\n  May it please the king,\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction we feel in every event that adds to the happiness of\r\nour sovereign, prompts us to request admittance to the throne, on the\r\npresent interesting occasion.\r\n\r\nThe birth of a prince, the safety of the queen, and thy own domestic\r\nfelicity increased, call for our thankfulness to the Supreme Dispenser\r\nof every blessing; and to the king our dutiful and unfeigned\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nIn the prince of Wales we behold another pledge of the security of those\r\ninestimable privileges, which we have enjoyed under the monarchs of thy\r\nillustrious house--kings, distinguished by their justice, their\r\nclemency, and regard to the prosperity of their people: a happy presage,\r\nthat under their descendants, our civil and religious liberties will\r\ndevolve, in their full extent, to succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nLong may the Divine Providence preserve a life of so great importance to\r\nhis royal parents, to these kingdoms, and to posterity; that formed to\r\npiety and virtue, he may live beloved of God and man, and fill at length\r\nthe British throne with a lustre not inferior to his predecessors.\r\n\r\n_The King’s answer._\r\n\r\nI take very kindly this fresh instance of your duty and affection, and\r\nyour congratulations on an event so interesting to me and my family.

He was the second son of an attorney at Ashburton, in Devonshire,\r\nwhere he was born, October 18, 1731, educated at the free-school there,\r\nand articled to his father. Preferring the principles to the practice of\r\nthe law, he obtained admission to the bar, and attended on the court and\r\ncircuits without briefs, till, in 1759, he drew a memorial in behalf of\r\nthe East India company against the claims of the Dutch, which was deemed\r\na masterpiece in language and reasoning, and brought him into immediate\r\nnotice. His able arguments against general warrants obtained him high\r\nreputation, and he was engaged in almost every great case. He became\r\nsuccessively recorder of Bristol, member for Calne, and\r\nsolicitor-general, which office he surrendered on the resignation of his\r\nfriend lord Shelburne. When this nobleman returned to power he made Mr.\r\nDunning chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and a peer of parliament.\r\nAt the bar he was a most eloquent and powerful orator, and in the house\r\nof commons a distinguished opponent of the American war.

He\r\nreceived his education at Westminster-school, and Christchurch-college,\r\nOxford, where he became acquainted with Lloyd, Churchill, and Bonnel\r\nThornton.

By the advice of\r\nlord Bath he went to the bar, but neglected its duties to court the\r\nmuses. His fame as a dramatist is maintained by the “Clandestine\r\nMarriage,” the “Provoked Husband,” and the “Jealous Wife.” He wrote\r\nseveral other pieces for the stage, translated Terence, and Horace’s\r\n“Art of Poetry,” and became manager of Covent-garden theatre, and\r\nafterwards the patentee of the little theatre in the Haymarket, which he\r\nmanaged till paralysis impaired his faculties, and he sunk into a state\r\nof helplessness, from whence he never recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 63·27.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\nASSUMPTION, B.

This mountain derived its name\r\nfrom a chapel about halfway up, dedicated to the holy virgin, under the\r\nname of “Notre Dame des Anges,” but destroyed during the revolution. On\r\nthe day of the Assumption, there is held on the mountain in the vicinity\r\nof the chapel, what is called in the Provençal tongue, a _roumaragi_,\r\nwhich is a country feast. The people from the neighbouring parts\r\nassemble on the spot, dressed in their Sunday clothes, where they join\r\nin dancing, playing at bowls, of which the Provençaux are passionately\r\nfond, quoits, running races, and other rural sports. Every village in\r\nProvence has a similar fête on some day in the year. In case of the\r\nvillage being named after any saint, which is very common, as St.\r\nJoseph, St. Barnabé, St. Zacharie, St. Louis, and many others, the\r\nroumaragi is held on that saint’s day. That on the mountain of Notre\r\nDame des Anges is held on the Assumption, on account of the chapel\r\nhaving been dedicated to the holy virgin. During the revolution there\r\nwas a general suspension of these festivals, but to the great joy of the\r\nProvençaux, they were resumed under Napoleon.[296]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGEANT OF THE ASSUMPTION AT ROUEN.\r\n\r\nIt is related in Mr. Dawson Turner’s “Tour through Normandy,” that\r\nformerly a pageant in honour of the virgin was held in the archbishopric\r\nof Rouen. Des Marêts, the governor of Dieppe, in 1443, established it in\r\nhonour of the final expulsion of the English. The first master of the\r\n_Guild of the Assumption_ was the founder of it, under whose auspices\r\nand direction it was conducted.\r\n\r\nAbout midsummer the principal inhabitants used to assemble at the _hotel\r\nde ville_, or townhouse of Dieppe, and there they selected the girl of\r\nthe most exemplary character to represent the Virgin Mary, and with her\r\nsix other young women, to act the parts of the daughters of Sion. The\r\nhonour of figuring in this holy drama was greatly coveted; and the\r\nhistorian of Dieppe gravely assures us, that the earnestness felt on the\r\noccasion mainly contributed to the preservation of that purity of\r\nmanners and that genuine piety, which subsisted in this town longer than\r\nin any other of France! But the election of the virgin was not\r\nsufficient: a representative of St. Peter was also to be found among the\r\nclergy; and the laity were so far favoured, that they were permitted to\r\nfurnish the eleven other apostles.\r\n\r\nThis done, upon the fourteenth of August the virgin was laid in a cradle\r\nof the form of a tomb, and was carried early in the morning, (of the\r\nfifteenth,) attended by her suite of either sex, to the church of St.\r\nJacques; while, before the door of the master of the guild, was\r\nstretched a large carpet, embroidered with verses in letters of gold,\r\nsetting forth his own good qualities, and his love for the holy Mary.\r\nHither also, as soon as _lauds_ had been sung, the procession repaired\r\nfrom the church, and then it was joined by the governor of the town, the\r\nmembers of the guild, the municipal officers, and the clergy of the\r\nparish of St. Remi. Thus attended, they paraded the town, singing hymns,\r\nwhich were accompanied by a full band. The procession was increased by\r\nthe great body of the inhabitants; and its impressiveness was still\r\nfurther augmented by numbers of the youth of either sex, who assumed the\r\ngarb and attributes of their patron saints, and mixed in the immediate\r\ntrain of the principal actors. They then again repaired to the church,\r\nwhere _Te Deum_ was sung by the full choir, in commemoration of the\r\nvictory over the English; and high mass was performed, and the sacrament\r\nadministered to the whole party.\r\n\r\nDuring the service, a scenic representation was given of the _Assumption\r\nof the Virgin_. A scaffolding was raised, reaching nearly to the top of\r\nthe dome, and supporting an azure canopy intended to emulate the\r\n“spangled vault of heaven;” and about two feet below the summit of it\r\nappeared, seated on a splendid throne, an old man as the image of the\r\nFather Almighty, a representation equally absurd and impious, and which\r\ncould alone be tolerated by the votaries of the worst superstitions of\r\npopery. On either side four pasteboard angels, of the size of men,\r\nfloated in the air, and flapped their wings in cadence to the sounds of\r\nthe organ; while above was suspended a large triangle, at whose corners\r\nwere placed three smaller angels, who, at the intermission of each\r\noffice, performed upon a set of little bells the hymn of “Ave Maria\r\ngratiâ Dei plena per Secula,” &c., accompanied by a larger angel on each\r\nside with a trumpet. To complete this portion of the spectacle, two\r\nothers, below the old man’s feet, held tapers, which were lighted as the\r\nservices began, and extinguished at their close; on which occasions the\r\nfigures were made to express reluctance by turning quickly about; so\r\nthat it required some dexterity to apply the extinguishers. At the\r\ncommencement of the mass, two of the angels by the side of the Almighty\r\ndescended to the foot of the altar, and, placing themselves by the tomb,\r\nin which a pasteboard figure of the virgin had been substituted for her\r\nliving representative, gently raised it to the feet of the Father. The\r\nimage, as it mounted, from time to time, lifted its head and extended\r\nits arms, as if conscious of the approaching beatitude; then, after\r\nhaving received the benediction, and been encircled by another angel\r\nwith a crown of glory, it gradually disappeared behind the clouds. At\r\nthis instant a buffoon, who all the time had been playing his antics\r\nbelow, burst into an extravagant fit of joy; at one moment clapping his\r\nhands most violently, at the next stretching himself out as if dead.\r\nFinally he ran up to the feet of the old man, and hid himself under his\r\nlegs, so as to show only his head. The people called him Grimaldi, an\r\nappellation that appears to have belonged to him by usage; and it is a\r\nsingular coincidence, that the surname of the noblest family of Genoa\r\nthe Proud, thus assigned by the rude rabble of a seaport to their\r\nbuffoon, should belong of right to the sire and son, whose _mops_ and\r\n_mowes_ afford pastime to the upper gallery at Covent-garden.\r\n\r\nThus did the pageant proceed in all its grotesque glory; and, while\r\n\r\n    These laboured nothings in so strange a style\r\n    Amazed th’ unlearned, and made the learned smile,\r\n\r\nthe children shouted aloud for their favourite Grimaldi; the priests,\r\naccompanied with bells, trumpets, and organs, thundered out the mass;\r\nthe pious were loud in their exclamations of rapture at the devotion of\r\nthe virgin, and the whole church was filled with a hoarse and confused\r\nmurmuring sound. The sequel of this, as of most other similar\r\nrepresentations, was a hearty dinner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis adoration of the virgin, so prevalent in Romish worship, is\r\nadverted to in a beautiful passage of “Don Roderick.”\r\n\r\n      How calmly gliding through the dark blue sky\r\n    The midnight moon ascends!

In 1633, he was sent to Trinity-college,\r\nCambridge; in 1657, he became assistant to Milton in his office of Latin\r\nsecretary to Cromwell; and at the restoration he was chosen to represent\r\nhis native town in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nHis conduct was marked by inflexible adherence to the principles of\r\nliberty, and his wit as a writer was levelled at the corruptions of the\r\ncourt; yet Charles II. courted his society for the pleasure of his\r\nconversation. He lived in a mean lodging in an obscure court in the\r\nStrand, where he was visited by lord Danby, at the desire of the king,\r\nwith his majesty’s request, to know in what way he could serve him;\r\nMarvel answered, it was not in the king’s power to serve him. Lord Danby\r\nin the course of conversation assured him of any place he might choose;\r\nMarvel replied, he could not accept the offer without being unjust to\r\nhis country by betraying its interests, or ungrateful to the king by\r\nvoting against him. Before lord Danby took leave he told him his majesty\r\nhad sent him a thousand pounds as a mark of his private esteem. Marvel\r\ndid not need the assurance; he refused the money, and after his noble\r\nvisiter departed, borrowed a guinea which he wanted of a friend. This\r\ngreat man after having served his constituents for twenty successive\r\nyears in parliament, was buried at their expense in the church of St.\r\nGiles-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·65.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 17.~\r\n\r\n\r\nBALL AND CROSS OF ST.

Two hearses\r\nand a mourning coach terminated the procession, which passed through\r\nlines of foot soldiers to the scaffold on the south side of the hill,\r\naround which the guards formed an area, and troops of horse wheeled off,\r\nand drew up in their rear five deep.\r\n\r\nThe lords were conducted to separate apartments in a house facing the\r\nscaffold, and their friends admitted to see them. The rev. Mr. Hume, a\r\nnear relative of the earl of Hume, with the rev. Mr. Foster, an amiable\r\ndissenting minister, who never recovered the dismal effect of the scene,\r\nassisted the earl of Kilmarnock; the chaplain of the tower, and another\r\nclergyman of the church of England accompanied lord Balmerino, who on\r\nentering the house, hearing several of the spectators ask, “which is\r\nlord Balmerino?” answered with a smile, “I am lord Balmerino, gentlemen,\r\nat your service.” Earl Kilmarnock spent an hour with Mr. Foster in\r\ndevotional exercises, and afterwards had a conference with lord\r\nBalmerino, who on their taking leave said, “My dear lord Kilmarnock, I\r\nam only sorry that I cannot pay this reckoning alone: once more farewell\r\nfor ever!”\r\n\r\nAs lord Kilmarnock proceeded to the scaffold attended by his friends,\r\nthe multitude showed the deepest signs of pity and commiseration. Struck\r\nby the sympathy of the immense assemblage, and the variety of dreadful\r\nobjects on the stage of death, his coffin, the heading-block, the axe,\r\nand the executioners, he turned to Mr. Hume and said, “Hume! this is\r\nterrible,” but his countenance and voice were unchanged. The black baize\r\nover the rails of the scaffold was removed, that the people might see\r\nall the circumstances of the execution, and a single stroke from the\r\nheadsman, separated him from the world.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino in the mean time having solemnly recommended himself to\r\nthe Supreme Mercy, conversed cheerfully with his friends, took wine, and\r\ndesired them to drink to him “ane degree ta haiven.” The sheriff entered\r\nto inform him that all was ready, but was prevented by the lordship\r\ninquiring if the affair was over with lord Kilmarnock. “It is,” said the\r\nsheriff. He then inquired, and being informed, how the executioner\r\nperformed his office, observed, “It was well done;” turning himself to\r\nthe company, he said, “Gentlemen I shall detain you no longer,” and\r\nsaluted them with unaffected cheerfulness. He mounted the scaffold with\r\nso easy an air, as to astonish the spectators. No circumstance in his\r\nwhole deportment showed the least fear or regret, and he frequently\r\nreproved his friends for discovering either, upon his account. He walked\r\nseveral times round the scaffold, bowed to the people, went to his\r\ncoffin, read the inscription, and with a nod, said “it is right;” he\r\nthen examined the block, which he called his “pillow of rest.” Putting\r\non his spectacles, and taking a paper out of his pocket, he read it with\r\nan audible voice, and then delivering it to the sheriff, called for the\r\nexecutioner, who appearing, and being about to ask his lordship’s\r\npardon, he interrupted him with “Friend, you need not ask my\r\nforgiveness, the execution of your duty is commendable,” and gave him\r\nthree guineas, saying, “Friend, I never was rich, this is all the money\r\nI have now, and I am sorry I can add nothing to it but my coat and\r\nwaistcoat,” which he then took off, together with his neckcloth, and\r\nthrew them on his coffin. Putting on a flannel waistcoat, provided for\r\nthe purpose, and taking a plaid cap out of his pocket, he put it on his\r\nhead, saying he died “a Scotchman.” He knelt down at the block, to\r\nadjust his posture, and show the executioner the signal for the stroke.\r\nOnce more turning to his friends, and looking round on the crowd, he\r\nsaid, “Perhaps some may think my behaviour too bold, but remember, sir,\r\n(said he to a gentleman who stood near him,) that I now declare it is\r\nthe effect of confidence in God, and a good conscience, and I should\r\ndissemble if I should show any signs of fear.”\r\n\r\nObserving the axe in the executioner’s hand as he passed him, he took it\r\nfrom, him, felt the edge, and returning it, clapped the executioner on\r\nthe shoulder to encourage him. He then tucked down the collar of his\r\nshirt and waistcoat, and showed him where to strike, desiring him to do\r\nit resolutely, for “in that,” said his lordship, “will consist your\r\nkindness.”\r\n\r\nPassing to the side of the stage, he called up the wardour, to whom he\r\ngave some money, asked which was his hearse, and ordered the man to\r\ndrive near.\r\n\r\nImmediately, without trembling or changing countenance, he knelt down at\r\nthe block, and with his arms stretched out, said, “O Lord, reward my\r\nfriends, forgive my enemies, and receive my soul,” he gave the signal by\r\nletting them fall. His firmness and intrepidity, and the unexpected\r\nsuddenness of the signal, so surprised the executioner, that the blow\r\nwas not given with strength enough to wound him very deep; another blow\r\nimmediately given rendered him insensible, and a third completed the\r\nwork of death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino had but a small estate. His lady came to London, and\r\nfrequently attended him during his confinement in the Tower. She was at\r\ndinner with him when the warrant came for his execution the Monday\r\nfollowing. Being very much shocked, he desired her not to be concerned.\r\n“If the king had given me mercy,” he said, “I should have been glad of\r\nit; but since it is otherwise, I am very easy, for it is what I have\r\nexpected, and therefore it does not at all surprise me.” She was\r\ndisconsolate, and rose immediately from table; on which he started from\r\nhis chair, and said, “Pray, my lady, sit down, for it shall not spoil my\r\ndinner.”[298]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 64·17.\r\n\r\n  [298] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\nEARWIGS.\r\n\r\nIt is noted in the “Historical Chronicle” of the “Gentleman’s Magazine,”\r\non the nineteenth of August, 1755, under the head, “Stroud,” that at\r\nthat time there were such quantities of _earwigs_ in that vicinity that\r\nthey distroyed not only the flowers and fruits, but the cabbages, were\r\nthey ever so large.

The finest of these favours were edged with narrow gold\r\nlace, or twist; and then, being folded up in four cross folds, so that\r\nthe middle might be seen, they were worn by the accepted lovers in their\r\nhats, or at the breast. These favours became at last so much in vogue,\r\nthat they were sold ready made in the shops in Elizabeth’s time, from\r\nsixpence to sixteen-pence a piece. Tokens were also given by the\r\ngentlemen, and accepted by their fair mistresses; thus ascribed in an\r\nold comedy of the time:--\r\n\r\n    Given earrings we will wear\r\n    Bracelets of our lover’s hair;\r\n    Which they on our arms shall twist\r\n    (With our names carved) on our wrists.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  H.

But there are some whose hours of toil,\r\nmental and bodily, do not preclude them from seeking the tranquil haunts\r\nof nature. With me, after nervous irritability and mental excitement, it\r\nhas been, and is a favourite enjoyment, to quit the dusky dwellings of\r\nman, and wander among the fields and green lanes of our southern shore,\r\nwhile the sun is declining, and stillness begins to settle around.\r\n\r\nListlessly roving, whither I cared not, I have sauntered along till I\r\nfelt my unquiet sensations gradually subside, and a pleasing calmness\r\nsteal upon me. I know of nothing more annoying than that nervous\r\nthrilling or trembling, which runs through the whole frame after the\r\nmind has been troubled; it seems to me like the bubbling and restless\r\nswell of the ocean after a storm--one mass of fretful and impatient\r\nwater, knowing not how to compose itself. But to come to the green\r\nfields. There is a lane leading from the grove at Camberwell called\r\nLove-lane; it is well so called--long, winding, and quiet, with scenery\r\naround beautifully soft--the lover might wander with the mistress of his\r\nsoul for hours in undisturbed enjoyment. This lane is dear to me, for\r\nwith it is linked all my early associations--the bird--the\r\nbutterfly--the wild white rose--my first love. The bird is there still,\r\nthe butterfly hovers there, and the rose remains; but where is my first\r\nlove? I may not ask. Echo will but answer, “where!” yet I may in\r\nimagination behold her--I call up the shadowy joys of former times, and\r\nlike the beautiful vision in “Manfred,” she stands before me:--\r\n\r\n    A thousand recollections in her train\r\n    Of joy and sorrow, ere the bitter hour\r\n    Of separation came, never again\r\n    To meet in this wide world as we have met,\r\n    To feel as we have felt, to look, to speak,\r\n    To think alone as we _have_ thought allow’d.\r\n\r\nWhat happy feelings have been ours in that quiet lane! We have wandered\r\narm in arm, gazed on the scenery, listened to the bird. We have not\r\nspoken, but our eyes have met, and thoughts too full for utterance,\r\nfound answers there. Those days are gone; yet I love to wander there\r\nalone, even now; to press the grass that has been pressed by her feet,\r\nto pluck the flower from the hedge where she plucked it, to look on the\r\ndistant hills that she looked on, rising in long smooth waves, when not\r\na sound is heard save the “kiss me dear,” which some chaffinch is\r\nwarbling to his mate, or the trickling of waters seeking their sandy\r\nbeds in the hollows beneath the hedgerows. I strolled thither a few\r\nevenings ago: the sun was softly sinking, and the bright crimson which\r\nsurrounded him, fading into a faint orange, tinged here and there with\r\nsmall sable clouds; the night-cloud was advancing slowly darkly on; afar\r\nin the horizon were\r\n\r\n    The light-ships of the sky\r\n    Sailing onward silently.\r\n\r\nOne bird, the lark, was singing his evening song among the cool grass;\r\nsoftly, sweetly, it died away, and all was silent deep tranquillity; a\r\npleasing coolness came on the faint breeze over the neighbouring fields,\r\npregnant with odours, refreshing as they were fragrant. It was twilight;\r\nthe green of the distant hills changed to a greyish hue, their outlines\r\nwere enlarged, the trees assumed a more gigantic appearance, and soft\r\ndews began to ascend; faint upshootings of light in the eastern horizon\r\nforetold the rising of the moon; she appeared at length above the\r\nclouds, and a deeper stillness seemed to come with her, as if nature,\r\nlike man at the presence of a lovely women, was hushed into silent\r\nadmiration; the grey clouds rolled away on each side of her as rolls the\r\nwhite foam of the ocean before the bows of the vessel; her course was\r\nbegun, and,\r\n\r\n    “Silently beautiful, and calmly bright\r\n    Along her azure path I saw her glide\r\n    Heedless of all those things that neath her light\r\n    In bliss or woe or pain or care abide.\r\n    Wealth, poverty, humility, and pride,\r\n    All are esteemed as nothing in her sight,\r\n    Nor make her for one moment turn aside.\r\n    So calm philosophy unmoved pursues\r\n    Throughout the busy world its quiet way;\r\n    Nor aught that folly wiles or glory woos,\r\n    Can tempt awhile its notice or its stay:\r\n    Above all earthly thoughts its way it goes\r\n    And sinks at length in undisturbed repose.”\r\n\r\nColdly and calmly the full orb glided through the stillness of heaven.\r\nMy thoughts were of the past, of the millions who had worshipped her, of\r\nthe many she had inspired--of Endymion, of the beautiful episode of\r\nNisus and Euryalus in Virgil, of Diana of the Ephesians, of the\r\nbeautiful descriptions of her by the poets of every age, of every clime.\r\nThe melancholy yet pleasing feeling which came on me I can hardly\r\ndescribe: my disquietude had ceased; an undisturbed calmness succeeded\r\nit; my thoughts were weaned from the grosser materiality of earth, and\r\nwere soaring upward in silent adoration. I felt the presence of a\r\ndivinity, and was for a moment happy. Ye who are careworn, whose minds\r\nare restless, go at the peaceful hour of eve to the green fields and the\r\nhedge-clothed lanes. If you are not poets, you will feel as poets; if\r\nyou doubt, you will be convinced of Supreme Power and Infinite Love; and\r\nbe better in head and heart for your journey.\r\n\r\n  S. R.

The king is said, during the heat of the\r\nengagement, to have refreshed himself with water from this spring. A few\r\nyears ago a subscription was entered into, for the purpose of erecting\r\nsome memorial of this circumstance, and the late learned Dr. Parr being\r\napplied to, furnished an inscription, of which the following is a copy.\r\n\r\n  AQVA . EX . HOC . PVTEO . HAVSTA\r\n  SITIM . SEDAVIT\r\n  RICARDVS . TERTIVS . REX . ANGLIAE\r\n  CVM . HENRICO . COMITE . DE . RICHMONDIA\r\n  ACERRIME . ATQVE . INFENSISSIME\r\n  PRAELIANS\r\n  ET . VITA . PARITER . AC . SCEPTRO\r\n  AVTE . NOCTEM . CARITVRVS\r\n  XI KAL . SEPT . A. D. MCCCCLXXXV.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION.\r\n\r\n_Richard the III. King of England, most eagerly and hotly contending\r\nwith Henry, Earl of Richmond, and about to lose before night both his\r\nsceptre and his life, quenched his thirst with water drawn from this\r\nwell.--August 22, 1485._\r\n\r\nThe Roman month was divided into kalends, nones, and ides, all of which\r\nwere reckoned _backwards_. The kalends are the first day of the\r\nmonth.--Thus the first of September being the kalends of September, the\r\nthirty-first of August would be _pridie kalendarum_, or the second of\r\nthe kalends of _September_; the thirtieth of August would then be the\r\nthird of the kalends of September. Pursuing this train the twenty-second\r\nof August, and the XI of the kalends of September will be found to\r\ncorrespond.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bosworth field was fought on the twenty-second of August,\r\n1485, “on a large flat spacious ground,” says Burton, “three miles\r\ndistant from this town.” Richmond, afterwards Henry VII., landed at\r\nMilford-haven on the sixth of August, and arrived at Tamworth on the\r\neighteenth. On the nineteenth he had an interview with his\r\nfather-in-law, lord Stanley, when measures were converted for their\r\nfurther operations. On the twentieth, he encamped at Atherstone, and on\r\nthe twenty-first, both armies were in sight of each other the whole day.\r\nRichard entered Leicester with his army on the sixteenth, having the\r\nroyal crown on his head; he slept at Elmesthorpe on the night of the\r\nseventeenth. On the eighteenth he arrived at Stapleton, where he\r\ncontinued till Sunday the twenty-first. The number of his forces\r\nexceeded sixteen thousand--those of Richmond did not amount to five\r\nthousand. On each side the leader addressed his troops with a splendid\r\noration “which was scarcely finished” says an old historian, “but the\r\none army espied the other. Lord! how hastily the soldiers buckled their\r\nhelms! how quickly the archers bent their bows and brushed their\r\nfeathers! how readily the billmen shook their bills and proved their\r\nstaves, ready to approach and join when the terrible trumpet should\r\nsound the bloody blast to victory or death!” The first conflict of the\r\narchers being over, the armies met fiercely with sword and bills, and at\r\nthis period Richmond was joined by lord Stanley, which determined the\r\nfortune of the day.\r\n\r\nIn this battle, which lasted little more than two hours, above one\r\nthousand persons were slain on the side of Richard. Of Richmond’s army,\r\nscarcely one hundred were killed, amongst whom, the principal person was\r\nsir William Brandon, his standard bearer. Richard is thought to have\r\ndespised his enemy too much, and to have been too dilatory in his\r\nmotions. He is universally allowed to have performed prodigies of\r\nvalour, and is said to have fallen at last by treachery, in consequence\r\nof a blow from one of his followers. His body was thrown across a horse,\r\nand carried, for interment, to the Greyfriars at Leicester. He was the\r\nonly English monarch, since the conquest, that fell in battle, and the\r\nsecond who fought in his crown. Henry V. appeared in his at Agincourt,\r\nwhich was the means of saving his life, (though, probably, it might\r\nprovoke the attack,) by sustaining a stroke with a battle-axe, which\r\ncleft it. Richard’s falling off in the engagement, was taken up and\r\nsecreted in a bush, where it was discovered by sir Reginald Bray and\r\nplaced upon Henry’s head. Hence arises the device of a crown in a\r\nhawthorn bush, at each end of Henry’s tomb in Westminster-abbey.\r\n\r\nIn 1644, Bosworth field became again the scene of warfare; an\r\nengagement, or rather skirmish, taking place between the parliamentary\r\nand royal forces, in which the former were victorious without the loss\r\nof a single individual.\r\n\r\n  G. J.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. William Hutton, the historian of Birmingham, wrote an\r\naccount of “The Battle of Bosworth Field,” which Mr. Nichols published,\r\nand subsequently edited with considerable additions. Mr. Hutton\r\napprehended that the famous well where Richard slaked his thirst would\r\nsink into oblivion. A letter from Dr. Parr to Mr. Nichols, dated\r\nHatton, September 13, 1813, removes these apprehensions:--\r\n\r\n“As to Bosworth Field, six or seven years ago I explored it, and I found\r\nDick’s Well, out of which the tradition is that Richard drank during the\r\nbattle. It was in dirty, mossy ground, and seemed to me in danger of\r\nbeing destroyed by the cattle. I therefore bestirred myself to have it\r\npreserved, and to ascertain the owner. The bishop of Down spoke to the\r\narchbishop of Armagh, who said that the ground was not his. I then found\r\nit not to be Mrs. Pochin’s. Last year I traced it to a person to whom it\r\nhad been bequeathed by Dr. Taylor, formerly rector of Bosworth. I went\r\nto the spot, accompanied by the rev. Mr. Lynes, of Kirkby-Malory. The\r\ngrounds had been drained. We dug in two or three places without effect.\r\nI then applied to a neighbouring farmer, a good intelligent fellow. He\r\ntold me his family had drawn water from it for six or seven years, and\r\nthat he would conduct me to the very place. I desired him to describe\r\nthe signs. He said there were some large stones, and some square wood,\r\nwhich went round the well at the top. We dug, and found things as he had\r\ndescribed them; and, having ascertained the very spot, we rolled in the\r\nstones, and covered them with earth. Now lord Wentworth, and some other\r\ngentlemen, mean to fence the place with some strong stones, and to put a\r\nlarge stone over it with the following inscription; and you may tell the\r\nstory if you please.\r\n\r\n  “Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n  “S. PARR.”\r\n\r\nThe inscription is given in the preceding notice of the battle of\r\nBosworth by G. J., who likewise obligingly transmitted the drawing of\r\nthe well in its present state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor is highly favoured by the interesting communication from a\r\ngentleman profoundly erudite in genealogical lore.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe ravages inflicted by the all-subduing hand of time are not more\r\ndistinctly traceable in the deserted hall of the dismantled castle, and\r\nthe moulding fane of the dilapidated abbey, than in the downfall or\r\nextinction of ancient and distinguished races of nobility, who in ages\r\nlong past by have shook the senate and field, have scattered plenty o’er\r\na smiling land, or, as alas! is too frequently the melancholy reverse,\r\nshut the gates of mercy on mankind.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of this nature have suggested a review of the few\r\nfamilies remaining in our peerage, whose ancestors enjoyed that\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n    “Ere yet the fell Plantagenets had spent\r\n    Their antient rage on Bosworth’s purple field.”\r\n\r\nThe protracted duration and alternated reverses of the contest between\r\nthe houses of Lancaster and York, added to the rancorous inveteracy\r\nindispensably inherent in a barbarous age, will account for the\r\ncomparatively rare sprinkling of the immediate descendants of the\r\nfollowers and councillors of the Plantagenets in our present house of\r\npeers. In France, on the other hand, the contemporary struggle for the\r\nthrone laid between an indisputed native prince, Charles VII. and a\r\nforeign competitor, our Henry VI. The courtesies of war (imperfect even\r\nas they existed in those days) were allowed fairer play, and those who\r\nescaped the immediate edge of the foeman’s sword were not handed over to\r\nthe axe of the executioner.\r\n\r\nThe awful mortality which befell one eminent branch of our gallant\r\nPlantagenets at the period in question, is recorded in emphatic terms by\r\ntheir animated and faithful chronicler, Shakspeare:--\r\n\r\n    “Two of thy name, both dukes of Somerset,\r\n    Have sold their lives unto the house of York,\r\n    And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold.”\r\n\r\n  _List of English Peerages now existing on the Roll, of which the Date\r\n  of Creation is prior to the Accession of Henry VII._\r\n\r\n  Duke of Norfolk.\r\n  Duke of Beaufort, as Baron de Botetourt.\r\n  Marquis Townshend, as Baron de Ferrars.\r\n  Marquis of Hastings, as Baron Hastings.\r\n  Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n  Earl of Berkeley, as Baron Berkeley.\r\n  Earl Delawarr, as Baron Delawarr and West.\r\n  Earl of Abergavenny, as Baron Abergavenny.\r\n  Baroness de Roos.\r\n  Baron Le Despencer.\r\n  Baron de Clifford.\r\n  Baron Audley.\r\n  Baron Clinton.\r\n  Baron Dacre.\r\n  Baron de la Zouche.\r\n  Baroness Willoughby d’Eresby.\r\n  Baroness Grey de Ruthyn.\r\n  Baron Stourton.\r\n\r\n  _List of Families now invested with the Dignity of Peerage, whose\r\n  Ancestors in the Male Line, enjoyed the Peerage before the Accession\r\n  of Henry VII._\r\n\r\n  Where a well-grounded doubt exists, an asterisk is prefixed to the\r\n  name.\r\n\r\n  Howard\r\n  * Spencer\r\n  * Montagu\r\n  Clinton\r\n  Talbot\r\n  Stanley\r\n  Hastings\r\n  Grey\r\n  Berkeley\r\n  Windsor\r\n  Lumley\r\n  West\r\n  Neville\r\n  Devereux\r\n  Courtenay\r\n  Stourton\r\n  Clifford\r\n  Willoughby\r\n  * Basset\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·50.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 23.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nAugust 23, 1305, sir William Wallace, “the peerless knight of Elleslie,”\r\nwho bravely defended Scotland against Edward I. was executed by order of\r\nthat monarch on Tower-hill.

On this day, in 1826,\r\nthe editor observed hundreds of them collecting so high in the air that\r\nthey seemed of the size of flies; they remained wheeling about and\r\nincreasing in number upwards of an hour before dusk, when they all took\r\ntheir flight in a south-western direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHELDONIZING, OR SWALLOW SINGING.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Every-Day Book_\r\n\r\nSir,--The recent, and it is hoped still continued subscriptions in aid\r\nof suffering humanity, induce an observation, that to the very remote\r\norigin of collecting general alms, may be traced most of the mummeries\r\npractised in Christendom in the gothic centuries, and in the English\r\ncounties, even till within our own memory. Among the Rhodians one method\r\nof soliciting eleemosynary gifts, called cheldonizing, or\r\nswallow-singing, is corroboratory of the assertion. This benevolence, or\r\nvoluntary contribution, was instituted by Cleobulus of Lindos, at a time\r\nwhen public necessity drove the Lindians to the expedient of soliciting\r\na general subscription. Theognis speaks of cheldonizing as taking place\r\namong the sacred rites practised at Rhodes in the month Boëdromion, or\r\nAugust, and deriving its name from the customary song:--\r\n\r\n    The swallow, the swallow is here,\r\n      With his back so black, and his belly so white;\r\n    He brings on the pride of the year,\r\n      With the gay months of love and the days of delight.\r\n\r\n    Come, bring out the good humming stuff,\r\n      Of your nice tit-bits let the swallow partake,\r\n    Of good bread and cheese give enough,\r\n      And a slice of your right Boëdromion cake.\r\n\r\n    Our hunger, our hunger it twinges,\r\n      So give my good masters, I pray;\r\n    Or we’ll pull off your door from its hinges,\r\n      And, ecod! we’ll steal young madam away.\r\n\r\n    She’s a nice little pocket-piece darling,\r\n      And faith ’twill be easy to carry her hence;\r\n    Away with old prudence so snarling,\r\n      And toss us down freely a handful of pence.\r\n\r\n    Come, let us partake of your cheer,\r\n      And loosen your purse strings so hearty;\r\n    No crafty old grey beards are here,\r\n      And see we’re a merry boy’s party,\r\n    And the swallow, the swallow is here!\r\n\r\nPlutarch refers to another Rhodian custom, which is particularly\r\nmentioned by Phœnix of Colophon, a writer of iambics, who describes the\r\npractice being that of certain men going about to collect donations for\r\nthe crow, and singing or saying--\r\n\r\n    My good, worthy masters, a pittance bestow,\r\n    Some oatmeal, or barley, or wheat, for the crow;\r\n    A loaf or a penny, or e’en what you will,\r\n    As fortune your pockets may happen to fill.\r\n\r\n    From the poor man a grain of his salt may suffice,\r\n    For your crow swallows all, and is not very nice;\r\n    And the man who can now give his grain and no more,\r\n    May another day give from a plentiful store.\r\n\r\n    Come, my lad, to the door, Plutus nods to our wish,\r\n    And our sweet little mistress comes out with a dish;\r\n    She gives us her figs, and she gives us a smile,\r\n    Heaven bless her, and guard her from sorrow and guile;\r\n\r\n    And send her a husband of noble degree,\r\n    And a boy to be danc’d on his grand-daddy’s knee;\r\n    And a girl like herself to rejoice her good mother,\r\n    Who may one day present her with just such another.\r\n\r\n    God bless your dear hearts all a thousand times o’er!\r\n    Thus we carry our singing to door after door;\r\n    Alternately chanting, we ramble along,\r\n    And treat all who give, or give not, a song.\r\n\r\nThe song thus concludes--\r\n\r\n    My good, worthy masters, a pittance bestow,\r\n    Your bounty, my good, worthy mistresses throw;\r\n    Remember the crow, he is not very nice,\r\n    Do but give as you can, and the gift will suffice.\r\n\r\nPamphilius of Alexandria, in his chapter on names, says these men making\r\ncollections for the crow, were called coronistæ, or crow-mummers; and\r\ntheir songs were named coronismata, as Hagnooles, the Rhodian, relates\r\nin his work, entitled “Coronistæ.”\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J.

BARTHOLOMEW.\r\n\r\nFor St. Bartholomew, see vol. i. col. 1131.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.\r\n\r\nThis horrible slaughter is noticed in the same volume at the same place.\r\nFor particulars of the probable amount of the persons massacred, and the\r\ndifferent accounts of historians, the reader is referred to a most able\r\narticle in the “Edinburgh Review, June, 1826,” on the extraordinary\r\nmisrepresentations of the event and its perpetrators in Mr. Lingard’s\r\n“History of England.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA RESIDENT IN THE FLEET.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of August, 1736, a remarkably fat boar was taken up\r\nin coming out of Fleet Ditch into the Thames: it proved to be a\r\nbutcher’s, near Smithfield-bars, who had missed him five months, all\r\nwhich time, it seems, he had been in the common sewer, and was improved\r\nin price from ten shillings to two guineas.[301]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PIGS IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nWithin the last century (probably about 1720) a person in the parish of\r\nRuthwell, in Dumfriesshire, called the “Gudeman o’ the Brow,” received a\r\nyoung swine as a present from some distant part; which seems to have\r\nbeen the first ever seen in that part of the country. This pig having\r\nstrayed across the Lochar into the adjoining parish of Carlavroc, a\r\nwoman who was herding cattle on the marsh, by the sea side, was very\r\nmuch alarmed at the sight of a living creature, that she had never seen\r\nor heard of before, approaching her straight from the shore as if it had\r\ncome out of the sea, and ran home to the village of Blackshaw screaming.\r\nAs she ran, the pig ran snorking and grunting after her, seeming glad\r\nthat it had met with a companion. She arrived at the village so\r\nexhausted and terrified, that before she could get her story told she\r\nfainted away. By the time she came to herself, a crowd of people had\r\ncollected to see what was the matter, when she told them, that “There\r\nwas a diel came out of the sea with two horns in his head and chased\r\nher, roaring and gaping all the way at her heels, and she was sure it\r\nwas not far off.” A man called Wills Tom, an old schoolmaster, said if\r\nhe could see it he would “cunger the diel,” and got a bible and an old\r\nsword. The pig immediately started behind his back with a loud grumph,\r\nwhich put him into such a fright, that his hair stood upright in his\r\nhead, and he was obliged to be carried from the field half dead.\r\n\r\nThe whole crowd ran some one way and some another; some reached the\r\nhouse-tops, and others shut themselves in barns and byres. At last one\r\non the house-top called out it was “the Gudeman o’ the Brow’s grumphy,”\r\nhe having seen it before. Thus the affray was settled, and the people\r\nreconciled, although some still entertained frightful thoughts about it,\r\nand durst not go over the door to a neighbour’s house after dark without\r\none to set or cry them. One of the crowd who had some compassion on the\r\ncreature, called out, “give it a tork of straw to eat, it will be\r\nhungry.”\r\n\r\nNext day the pig was conveyed over the Lochar, and on its way home, near\r\nthe dusk of evening, it came grunting up to two men who were pulling\r\nthistles on the farm of Cockpool. Alarmed at the sight, they mounted two\r\nold horses they had tethered beside them, intending to make their way\r\nhome, but the pig getting between them and the houses, caused them to\r\nscamper out of the way and land in Lochar moss, where one of their\r\nhorses was drowned, and the other with difficulty relieved. The night\r\nbeing dark, they durst not part one from the other to call for\r\nassistance, lest the monster should find them out and attack them\r\nsingly; nor durst they speak above their breath for fear of being\r\ndevoured. At day-break next morning they took a different course, by\r\nCumlongon castle, and made their way home, where they found their\r\nfamilies much alarmed on account of their absence. They said that they\r\nhad seen a creature about the size of a dog, with two horns on its head,\r\nand cloven feet, roaring out like a lion, and if they had not galloped\r\naway, it would have torn them to pieces. One of their wives said, “Hout\r\nman, it has been the Gudeman of the Brow’s grumphy; it frightened them\r\na’ at the Blackshaw yesterday, and poor Meggie Anderson maist lost her\r\nwits, and is ay out o ae fit into anither sin-syne.”\r\n\r\nThe pig happened to lay all night among the corn where the men were\r\npulling thistles, and about day-break set forward on its journey for the\r\nBrow. One Gabriel Gunion, mounted on a long-tailed grey colt, with a\r\nload of white fish in a pair of creels swung over the beast, encountered\r\nthe pig, which went nigh among the horse’s feet and gave a snork. The\r\ncolt, being as much frightened as Gabriel, wheeled about and scampered\r\noff sneering, with his tail on his “riggin,” at full gallop. Gabriel cut\r\nthe slings and dropt the creels, the colt soon dismounted his rider, and\r\ngoing like the wind, with his tail up, never stopped till he came to\r\nBarnkirk point, where he took the Solway Frith and landed at Bownes, on\r\nthe Cumberland side. Gabriel, by the time he got up, saw the pig within\r\nsight, took to his heels, as the colt was quite gone, and reached\r\nCumlongon wood in time to hide himself, where he staid all that day and\r\nnight, and next morning got home almost exhausted. He told a dreadful\r\nstory! The fright caused him to imagine the pig as big as a calf, having\r\nlong horns, eyes like trenchers, and a back like a hedgehog. He lost his\r\nfish; the colt was got back, but never did more good; and Gabriel fell\r\ninto a consumption, and died about a year afterwards.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a vessel came to Glencaple quay, a little below\r\nDumfries, that had some swine on board; one of them having got out of\r\nthe vessel in the night, was seen on the farm of Newmains next morning.\r\nThe alarm was spread, and a number of people collected. The animal got\r\nmany different names, and at last it was concluded to be a “brock” (a\r\nbadger). Some got pitchforks, some clubs, and others old swords, and a\r\nhot pursuit ensued; the chase lasted a considerable time, owing to the\r\npursuers losing heart when near their prey and retreating. One Robs\r\nGeordy having rather a little more courage than the rest, ran “neck or\r\nnothing,” forcibly upon the animal, and run it through with a pitchfork,\r\nfor which he got the name of “stout hearted Geordy” all his life after.\r\nA man, nearly a hundred years of age, who was alive in 1814, in the\r\nneighbourhood where this happened, declared that he remembered the\r\nGudeman of the Brow’s pig, and the circumstances related, and he said it\r\nwas the first swine ever seen in that country.[302]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·80.\r\n\r\n  [301] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [302] Henderson on the Breeding of Swine. 1814, 8vo.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 25.~\r\n\r\n\r\nISLINGTON CATTLE MARKET.\r\n\r\nAugust 25, 1746, a distemper which arose among the horned cattle, broke\r\nout afresh in the parts adjacent to London, and “the fair for the sale\r\nof Welsh cattle near Islington was kept at Barnet.”[303]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT TO HOUSEKEEPERS.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from a lady claims the attention of every good\r\nhousewife at this particular season.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY JAM.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _Westbury, Wiltshire, Aug. 15, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The importance that I attach to the above _sweet_ subject,--the\r\nuses of “a _jam_” even may be important,--induces me to offer you the\r\noption of republishing a few lines on the occasion, which first appeared\r\nin a very condensed form last autumn, in the “Examiner” newspaper. I am\r\nanxious to obtain further celebrity, and a wider circulation of the\r\nmerits which this wholesome dainty justly lay claim, and the success\r\nthat attended my former little notice of it, encourage me to persevere;\r\nfor I was informed that after the publication alluded to, the “Herald”\r\ncopied it, and that subsequently it was cried in the streets of your\r\ndingy metropolis.\r\n\r\nI can only judge of the prevailing quantity of the kindly blackberry, by\r\nthe vast profusion that enriches _our_ woody vales, where nature seems\r\nresolved to solace herself for the restrictions to which she has been\r\nconfined by the dreary downs that skirt our beautiful vicinity; and\r\nwhere Falstaff must surely have originated his happy expression of\r\n“reasons being plenty as blackberries!” But I am keeping you too long\r\nfrom the subject. The method of preparing the delicate conserve that\r\nforms so large a portion of my children’s favourite _adjunctive_\r\naliment, is so simple, that it can be achieved by the merest novice in\r\nthe _nice_ department of “domestic management.”\r\n\r\nBoil the blackberries with half their weight of coarse moist sugar for\r\nthree quarters of an hour,[304] keeping the mass stirred constantly. It\r\nis a mistake to suppose that a stewpan is a necessary vehicle on the\r\noccasion; the commonest tin saucepan will answer the purpose equally\r\nwell. The more luxurious preserves being made with _white_ sugar, and\r\nthat of equal weight with the fruit, are necessarily unwholesome; but\r\nthe cheapness of this homely delicacy, besides its sanative properties\r\nrenders it peculiarly desirable for scantily furnished tables. It has\r\nbeen a “staple commodity” in my family for some years past, and with the\r\nexception of _treacle_, I find it the most useful aliment in “regulating\r\n_the bowels_” of my children;--you as a “family man,” sir, will excuse,\r\nnay, appreciate the observation, and all your readers who have “_their\r\nquivers full of them_,” will not disdain the _gratis_ prescription that\r\nshall supersede the _guinea fee!_ Indeed, to the sparing use of butter,\r\nand a liberal indulgence in _treacle_ and _blackberry jam_, I mainly\r\nattribute the extraordinary health of my young family. The prodigal use,\r\nor rather the abuse, of butter that pervades all classes, has often\r\nsurprised me: the very cottage children, whose tattered apparel bespeaks\r\nabject poverty, I continually meet munching their “_hunks_” of bread,\r\nsmeared with butter; how much should I rejoice to see, because I _know_\r\nits superiority in _every_ respect, my favourite jam substituted! But\r\n_cottage children_ are far from being objects of my compassion, for they\r\nlive in the “country,” which comprehensive word conveys delicious ideas\r\nof sun, fresh air, exercise, flowers, shady trees, and this wholesome\r\nfruit clustering about them, and inviting their chubby fingers at every\r\nhealthful step. My pity is reserved for their forlorn little brethren,\r\ndoomed to breathe the unwholesome atmosphere of crowded manufactories,\r\nand close narrow alleys in populous cities! What a luxury would a supper\r\nbe twice a week, for instance, to the poor little “bottoms” in\r\nSpitalfields.[305] Who knows but they might receive their first taste\r\nfor Shakspeare while being fed, like their great prototype in the\r\n“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” with blackberries! “_Dewberries_,” which\r\nTitania ordered for the refreshment of her favourite, are so nearly\r\nallied to their glossy neighbours, that when the season is far advanced\r\nthe two are not easily distinguished. Shakspeare, who knew every thing,\r\nwas of course aware that the dewberry ripens earlier than the\r\nblackberry; namely, in the season for “apricots.” It must be confessed\r\nthat nothing but the associations that are connected with the elegant\r\nand romantic name “dewberry,” fit only for the mouth of a fairy to\r\npronounce, could induce me to give a preference to the latter; they are\r\nnot so numerous, nor consequently so useful. I own I am sanguine\r\nrespecting the _general_ introduction of blackberries into the London\r\nstreet cries. What an innovation they would cause! what a rural sight,\r\nand sound, and taste, and smell, would they introduce into that\r\nwilderness of houses! What a conjuring up of happy feelings--almost as\r\nromantic as those that are inspired by “bilberries, ho!” When I resided\r\nin London, I recollect the wild, and exquisite, and undefinable\r\nsensations that were excited by the peculiar and un-city-like cry of\r\nthese “whorts.”[306] I used to look out at the blue-frocked boys who\r\nsold them, with their heavy country faces; capacious “_gabardines_,”\r\nthat hinted of Caliban; round hats, that knew no touch of form; and\r\nunaccountable laced up boots; with as much astonishment, as if I had\r\nbeheld and heard purveyors from the wilderness shouting “_Manna!_” which\r\nwe all know is “_angel’s food!_”\r\n\r\nI have taken up sadly too much of your time, sir, I feel assured. I\r\nintended but to name the method of making blackberry jam, to assure you\r\nof its salubrity, and to request you to recommend its general use:--and\r\nI have only now to request that you will not suffer the very imperfect\r\nmanner in which _I_, who cannot write for the public eye, have handled\r\nthe subject to deter you from doing it justice.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n  I. J. T.\r\n\r\nP. S. It has just occurred to me to say, why should not grocers,\r\nconfectioners, fruiterers, and chandlers, speculate in the “new\r\narticle,” and provide a store of it to meet a probable demand? I should\r\nthink it might be sold, with a reasonable profit, at sixpence or\r\neightpence a pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Drawing of the Lottery in Guildhall, 1751.~]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, and for three weeks after midsummer, 1826, the\r\nlottery-office keepers incessantly plied every man, woman, and child in\r\nthe United Kingdom, and its dependencies, with petitions to make a\r\nfortune in “the last lottery that can be drawn.” Men paraded the streets\r\nwith large printed placards on poles, or pasted on their backs,\r\nannouncing “All Lotteries End for Ever! 18th of July.” The walls were\r\nstuck, and hand-bills were thrust into the hands of street passengers,\r\nwith the same heart-rending intelligence, and with the solemn assurance\r\nthat the demand for tickets and shares was immense! Their prices had so\r\nrisen, were so rising, and would be so far beyond all calculation, that\r\nto get shares or tickets at all, they must be instantly purchased! As\r\nthe time approached, a show was got up to proclaim that the deplorable\r\n“Death of the Lottery,” would certainly take place on the appointed day;\r\nbut on some account or other, the pathetic appeal of the benevolent\r\ncontractors was disregarded, and the gentlemen about to be “turned off,”\r\nwere as unheeded, and as unlamented as criminals, who say or sing in\r\ntheir last moments--\r\n\r\n    “Gentlefolks all\r\n    Pity our fall!\r\n    Have pity all,\r\n    Pity our fall!”\r\n\r\nAt length the stoney-hearted public were “respectfully” informed that\r\n“the lords of the treasury had issued a “_reprieve_,” and that the\r\n“drawing” and “quartering” and so forth was, “postponed from Tuesday,\r\n18th July,” to some dull day in October, “when Lotteries will finish for\r\never?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf late years lotteries have been drawn at Coopers’-hall.

To him it is as\r\nnecessary a guide as topography is to a student in geology, who without\r\nthat requisite, and supposing him ignorant of the characters of\r\nmountains may lose his way, and be found vainly boring Schehalion, or\r\nsinking a shaft within the crater of an exhausted volcano. To prevent\r\nsuch mistakes in “phrenology,” the “estate under the hat” has been\r\nthoroughly explored, and divided and subdivided: names and numbers have\r\nbeen assigned to each portion, and the entire globe of the microcosm\r\naccurately measured, and mapped, “according to the latest surveys.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cruikshank’s “Illustrations of Phrenology” form a more popular\r\nintroduction to the science than its most ardent admirers could possibly\r\nhope. He acknowledges his obligations to doctors Gall and Spurzheim, and\r\nimplicitly adopts their arrangement of the “organs;” a word, by the by,\r\nthat signifies those convexities which may be seen by the eye, or\r\ntouched by the finger, on the exterior of the greater convexity called\r\nthe head; and which are produced, or thrown up thereon, by the working\r\nor heaving of the ideas internally. From this process it appears that a\r\nman “bores” his own head, so as to form concavities within and\r\nconvexities without; and, in the same way, by the power of speech,\r\n“bores” the heads of his friends. The term “to bore,” however, as\r\ncommonly used, signifies “to bother,” or “perplex and confound,” and\r\ntherefore is not admitted in the nomenclature of “phrenology,” which\r\ncondescends to level every “bump,” to the right understanding of the\r\nmeanest capacity.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Cruikshank’s proficiency or rank in the phrenological school, the\r\nwriter of this article is incompetent to judge; but, as regards his\r\npresent work, whether he be a master, or only a monitor, is of little\r\nconsequence; he seems well grounded in rudiments, and more he does not\r\nprofess to teach. Instead of delivering a mapped head in plaister of\r\nParis with his book, he exhibits an engraving of three “bare polls,” or\r\npolls sufficiently bare to discover the position of every convexity or\r\n“organ” whereon he duly marks their numbers, according to the notation\r\nof doctors Gall and Spurzheim. From hence we learn that we have nine\r\npropensities, nine sentiments, eleven knowing faculties, and four\r\nreflecting faculties. Adhering to the doctrinal enumeration and\r\nnomenclature of the “organs” worked out, or capable of being worked out,\r\nby these propensities, sentiments, and faculties, on every human head,\r\nhe wisely prefers the Baconian as the best method of teaching “the new\r\nscience,” and exhibits the effects of each of the thirty-three “organs”\r\nin six sheets of etchings by himself, from his own views of each\r\n“organ.”\r\n\r\nIt is now proper to hint at the mode wherein the artist has executed his\r\ndesign, and to take each organ according to its number, and under its\r\nscientific term.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--AMATIVENESS.\r\n\r\nMr. Cruikshank seems to imagine that this organ may induce a declaration\r\nof undivided attachment to an intermediate object, in order to arrive at\r\nthe object _sincerely_ desired: under the circumstances represented,\r\nthis deviation of “amativeness” may be denominated “cupboard love.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--PHILOPROGENITIVENESS.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of this perplexing organ hastens the necessity of extending\r\nour “colonial policy.” This sketch is full of life and spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--INHABITIVENESS.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the artist’s point, a “tenant for life,” doubtless has an\r\namazing developement of the organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--ADHESIVENESS.\r\n\r\nIs “enough to frighten a horse.” This organ will be further observed on\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--COMBATIVENESS.\r\n\r\nIts vigorous cultivation is displayed with much animation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--DESTRUCTIVENESS.\r\n\r\nA familiar illustration of this organ is derived from a common\r\noccurrence in almost every market-town. Its contemplation, and a few\r\nrecent incidents, suggest a query or two. A bull ran into a china shop,\r\nbut instead of proceeding to the work of demolition, threw his eye\r\naround the place, thrust his horn under the arm of a richly painted\r\nvase, and ran briskly into the street with his prize. Was this act\r\nascribable to the organ of “colour,” or that of “covetiveness?” An _ox_\r\nwalked into a well-furnished parlour, and withdrew without doing further\r\nmischief than ogling himself in the looking-glass. Were these “stolen”\r\nlooks occasioned by “covetiveness,” or “self-love?” Another of the _bos_\r\ntribe rapidly passed men, women, and children, ran up the steps to an\r\nopen street door, hurried through the passage, ascended every flight of\r\nthe stair-case, nor stopped till he had gained the front attic, from\r\nwhence he put his head through the window, and looked down from his\r\nproud eminence, over the parapet, upon his “followers.” On this third\r\nexample may be quoted what Mr. Cruikshank says of another organ,\r\n“_Inhabitiveness_. To this organ is ascribed, in man, _Self Love_, and\r\nin other animals, _Physical height_. The artist has endeavoured to give\r\n_his_ idea of _inhabitiveness_ in plate 2.” On comparing the anecdote\r\nlast related, with the artist’s idea in the plate he refers to, it is\r\nclear that, on this occasion, his view might have been more _elevated_.\r\nIn the last-mentioned bull, “Inhabitiveness” seems to have been the\r\nprevailing organ. Separately considering the three animals, and their\r\ngeneral character, and the tempting objects by which each was\r\nsurrounded, without their manifestation of any action to denote the\r\nexistence of “destructiveness,” a question arises, whether counteracting\r\norgans may not be cultivated in such animals, to the extent of\r\nneutralizing the primary developement.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--CONSTRUCTIVENESS.\r\n\r\nThis is so elegant an exhibition of the propensity in connection with\r\ncertain vegetable tendencies, that it is doubtful whether developements\r\nfrom the action of the sap in plants, may not admit of classification\r\nwith our own.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--COVETIVENESS.\r\n\r\nIn this representation, the countenance of a boy is frightfully\r\nimpressed by the incessant restlessness of the “organ,” combined with\r\n“cautiousness.” See No. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--SECRETIVENESS.\r\n\r\nExhibits one of the advantages of this “propensity” in the sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--SELF LOVE.\r\n\r\nNarcissus himself could not be more strongly marked, than this\r\n“heart-breaking” personage.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--APPROBATION. See No. XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--CAUTIOUSNESS.\r\n\r\nPrudence and indecision are here united by a decisive touch. The\r\naccessory, who assists this “procedure of the human understanding,” is\r\nexceedingly\r\n\r\n    --------------“light and airy;\r\n    Brisk as a bee, blithe as a fairy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--BENEVOLENCE.\r\n\r\nA “benevolent” individual, receiving loud acknowledgments from the\r\nobject of his favours.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--VENERATION.\r\n\r\nMr. Cruikshank says, that “Dr. Gall observed this organ chiefly in\r\npersons with bald heads.” The artist satisfactorily exemplifies, that\r\nwhen its absence occurs in Englishmen, it is a rare exception to the\r\nnational character.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--HOPE.\r\n\r\nThis sentiment is always allegorized with an anchor, and Mr. Cruikshank\r\nrepresents a poor animal under its influence, “brought to an anchor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--IDEALITY.\r\n\r\nMr. Cruikshank says, that “Mr. Forster calls this the organ of\r\n_mysterizingness_. It is supposed that a peculiar developement of this\r\norgan, which is remarkably conspicuous in all poets, occurs in persons\r\nwho are disposed to have visions, see ghosts, demons, &c.” The artist\r\nrepresents certain appearances, which will be recognised as “familiars.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--CONSCIENTIOUSNESS.\r\n\r\n“According to Dr. Spurzheim, this is the organ of _righteousness_;” but,\r\n“Dr. Gall thinks there is no organ of _conscience_.” Mr. Cruikshank\r\nexemplifies the latter opinion, by the surprise of a female on receiving\r\n“an unexpected offer.” It will not surprise the reader if he looks at\r\nthe print.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--FIRMNESS.\r\n\r\n“Firmness,” he regards in the light of “a character now being consigned\r\nrapidly to oblivion.” But, “while there is life there is hope,” and the\r\ncharacter alluded to cannot be destroyed without the annihilation of\r\n“adhesiveness,” which Mr. Cruikshank defines in the language of the\r\nscience, and “has endeavoured to give a strong but faithful illustration\r\nof, in plate 2;” a representation, alas! too accurate. See No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--INDIVIDUALITY.\r\n\r\nA more select specimen could not have been produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--FORM.\r\n\r\nThis is well represented. “Persons,” says Mr. Cruikshank, “endowed with\r\nthis organ, are fond of seeing pictures, &c.” They may likewise be\r\nfrequently detected in jelly-rooms, and the upper boxes of the theatres.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--SIZE.\r\n\r\nRemarkably developed in “a great man now no more!”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--WEIGHT.\r\n\r\nA compliment from the artist, “to which he is confident no loyal man\r\nwill offer an objection.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.--COLOUR.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of art, this is the most successful of the illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.--SPACE.\r\n\r\nAn enlarged view of a deep seated organ, bottomed on the character of a\r\npeople whom we have outrivalled.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.--ORDER.\r\n\r\nThis organ as a ruling power, is placed by Mr. Cruikshank in the hand;\r\nits developement manifestly generates “Veneration.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.--TIME.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Cruikshank’s words, “the artist’s illustration of it will be\r\nfamiliar to every one.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.--NUMBER.\r\n\r\nA portrait of an individual in whom the power of this organ is supposed\r\nto have been preeminent.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--TUNE.\r\n\r\nThis organ, according to the artist, produces rectitude in the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.--LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.--COMPARISON.\r\n\r\nThe organ of “Comparison” is exemplified by full developements from\r\n“Long Acre,” and “Little St. Martin’s-lane,” within one door from the\r\nresidence of “Mr. Thomas Rodd, bookseller, Great Newport-street,” whose\r\nstock of books, large as it is, cannot furnish any thing like the “words\r\nthat burn,” in the artist’s representation of “LANGUAGE.”[307]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.--CAUSALITY.\r\n\r\n“This is nothing more than the organ of _Inquisitiveness_,” and the\r\nartist himself exercises it, by gently feeling his reader’s pulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.--WIT.\r\n\r\nThere is great difficulty in defining this organ. Mr. Cruikshank’s\r\nrepresentation of it is humorous.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--IMITATION.\r\n\r\nThis is an admirable exhibition of the organ, as we may imagine it to be\r\ncultivated by “Mr. Mathews-At home!” with decided “APPROBATION.” See No.\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nHaving hastily gone over the organs of the science, we have an\r\nadditional one, “_The Organ of_ DRAWING.” Mr. Cruikshank says, he\r\n“cannot satisfy himself as to the precise seat of this organ, or as to\r\nthe extent of its sphere of activity, but he has attempted an\r\nillustration of it.” He thinks it not improbable “that the possession of\r\nthis special faculty, now only at his fingers’ ends, may enable him to\r\nventure again” if his present efforts are successful. Why they should\r\nnot be it is difficult to conceive; for however whimsical and ludicrous\r\nhis “Phrenological Illustrations” may sometimes be, they are so\r\nconnected with the vocabulary of the science at the commencement of his\r\npublication, as to form the horn-book, the primer, the reading made\r\neasy, and the grammar of phrenology.\r\n\r\nSuch a production as this, at such a price, (eight shillings plain, and\r\ntwelve shillings coloured,) from such an artist, could not have been\r\nexpected. His inimitable powers have hitherto entertained and delighted\r\nthe public far more to the emolument of others than himself; and now\r\nthat he has ventured to “take a benefit” on his own account, there\r\ncannot be a doubt that his admirers will encourage “their old favourite”\r\nto successive endeavours for their amusement and instruction. His entire\r\ntalents have never been called forth; and some are of a far higher order\r\nthan even the warmest friends to his pencil can conceive.\r\n\r\nThough the work is to be obtained of all the booksellers in London, and\r\nevery town in the united kingdom, yet it would be a well-timed\r\ncompliment to Mr. Cruikshank if town purchasers of his “Phrenological\r\nIllustrations” were to direct their steps to his house, No. 25,\r\nMyddelton Terrace, Pentonville.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWERS OF BLOOD.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August, 1826, the editor of the _Every-Day Book_, while\r\nwriting in his room, took up the open envelope of a letter he had\r\nreceived about ten minutes before, and to his surprise, observed on its\r\ninner side, which had been uppermost on the table, several spots which\r\nseemed to be blood. They were fresh and wet, and of a brilliant scarlet\r\ncolour. They could not be red ink, for there was none in the house; nor\r\ncould they have been formed on the paper by any person, for no one had\r\nentered the room; nor had he moved from the chair wherein he sat. The\r\nappearances seemed unaccountable, till considering that the window\r\nsashes were thrown up, and recollecting an anecdote in the “Life of\r\nPeiresc,” he was persuaded that they were easily to be accounted for;\r\nand that they were a specimen of those “showers of blood,” which\r\nterrified our forefathers in the dark ages, and are recorded by old\r\nchroniclers.\r\n\r\nIt is related, for instance, that in the fifth century, “at Yorke, it\r\nrained bloud;” and in 697, “corne, as it was gathered in the harvest\r\ntime, appeared bloudie,” and “in the furthermost partes of Scotland it\r\nrayned bloud.”[308] In 1553, it was deemed among the forewarnings of the\r\ndeaths of Charles and Philip, dukes of Brunswick, that there were “drops\r\nof bloude upon hearbes and trees.”[309]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a solution of the origin, or cause of bloody spots on the paper, the\r\nanecdote in Gassendi’s “Life of Peiresc” is added.\r\n\r\n“Nothing in the whole year, 1608, did more please him,--than _that_ he\r\nobserved and philosophized about--the _bloody rain_, which was commonly\r\nreported to have fallen about the beginning of July; great drops thereof\r\nwere plainly to be seen, both in the city itself, upon the walls of the\r\nchurchyard of the great church, which is near the city wall, and upon\r\nthe city walls themselves; also upon the walls of villages, hamlets, and\r\ntowns, for some miles round about; for in the first place, he went\r\nhimself to see those wherewith the stones were coloured, and did what he\r\ncould to come to speak with those husbandmen, who beyond Lambesk, were\r\nreported to have been so affrighted at the falling of the said rain,\r\nthat they left their work, and ran as fast as their legs could carry\r\nthem into the adjacent houses. Whereupon, he found that it was a fable\r\nwhich was reported, touching those husbandmen. Nor was he pleased that\r\nthe naturalists should refer this kind of rain to vapours drawn up out\r\nof red earth aloft into the air, which congealing afterwards into\r\nliquor, fall down in this form; because such vapours as are drawn aloft\r\nby heat, ascend without colour, as we may know by the alone example of\r\nred roses, out of which the vapours that arise by heat, are congealed\r\ninto transparent water. He was less pleased with the common people, and\r\nsome divines, who judged that it was a work of the devils and witches,\r\nwho had killed innocent young children; for this he counted a mere\r\nconjecture, possibly also injurious to the goodness and providence of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n“In the mean while an accident happened, out of which he conceived he\r\nhad collected the true cause thereof. For some months before, he shut up\r\nin a box a certain palmer-worm which he had found, rare for its bigness\r\nand form; which, when he had forgotten, he heard a buzzing in the box,\r\nand when he opened it, found the palmer-worm, having cast its coat, to\r\nbe turned into a very beautiful butterfly, which presently flew away,\r\nleaving in the bottom of the box a red drop as broad as an ordinary sous\r\nor shilling; and because this happened about the beginning of the same\r\nmonth, and about the same time an incredible multitude of butterflies\r\nwere observed flying in the air, he was therefore of opinion, that such\r\nkind of butterflies resting upon the walls, had there shed such like\r\ndrops, and of the same bigness. Wherefore, he went the second time, and\r\nfound by experience, that those drops were not to be found on the house\r\ntops, nor upon the round sides of the stones which stuck out, as it\r\nwould have happened, if blood had fallen from the sky, but rather where\r\nthe stones were somewhat hollowed, and in holes, where such small\r\ncreatures might shroud and nestle themselves. Moreover, the walls which\r\nwere so spotted, were not in the middle of towns, but they were such as\r\nbordered upon the fields, nor were they on the highest parts, but only\r\nso moderately high as butterflies are commonly wont to flie.\r\n\r\n“Thus, therefore, he interpreted that which Gregory of Tours relates,\r\ntouching a bloody rain seen at Paris in divers places, in the days of\r\nChildebert, and on a certain house in the territory of Senlis; also that\r\nwhich is storied, touching raining of blood about the end of June, in\r\nthe days of king Robert; so that the blood which fell upon flesh,\r\ngarments, or stones, could not be washed out, but that which fell on\r\nwood might; for it was the same season of butterflies, and experience\r\nhath taught us, that no water will wash these spots out of the stones,\r\nwhile they are fresh and new. When he had said these and such like\r\nthings to Varius, a great company of auditors being present, it was\r\nagreed that they should go together and search out the matter, and as\r\nthey went up and down, here and there, through the fields, they found\r\nmany drops upon stones and rocks; but they were only on the hollow and\r\nunder parts of the stones, but not upon those which lay most open to the\r\nskies.”\r\n\r\nThus the first mentioned appearances on the paper, may be naturally\r\naccounted for, and so\r\n\r\n    ----------“ends the history\r\n    Of this wonderful mystery.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, the 25th of August, 1826, the editor\r\nwitnessed the terrific tempest of thunder and lightning, mentioned in\r\nthe newspapers. He was walking in the London-road near the Surrey\r\nobelisk, when the flashes sheeted out more rapidly in succession, and to\r\ngreater extent than have ever been witnessed in this country, within the\r\nmemory of man. They were accompanied by a gale of wind that took up\r\nlight objects, such as hay, leaves, and sticks, and immense clouds of\r\ndust to a great height, and impelled people along against their will.\r\nThe sudden loud claps of thunder, and the red forking of the flashes\r\nwere tremendously grand and appalling. At one time there was a crashing\r\nburst of thunder, and a rushing sound from the electric fluid, like the\r\ndischarge of a flight of rockets close at hand. This was in the midst of\r\na torrent of rain, which lasted only a few minutes, and was as heavy as\r\nfrom the bursting of a number of water spouts. This storm was literally\r\na tornado.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLightning was looked upon as sacred both by the Greeks and Romans, and\r\nwas supposed to be sent to execute vengeance on the earth. Hence persons\r\nkilled with lightning, being thought hateful to the gods were buried\r\napart by themselves, lest the ashes of other men should receive\r\npollution from them. All places struck with lightning were carefully\r\navoided and fenced round, from an opinion that Jupiter had either taken\r\noffence at them, and fired upon them the marks of his displeasure, or\r\nthat he had by this means pitched upon them as sacred to himself. The\r\nground thus fenced about, was called by the Romans bidental. Lightning\r\nwas much observed in augury, and was a good or bad omen, according to\r\nthe circumstances attending it.[310]\r\n\r\nWhen a stormy cloud, which is nothing but a heap of exhalations strongly\r\nelectrified, approaches near enough to a tower, or a house, or a cloud\r\nnot electrified; when it approaches so near, that a spark flies from it,\r\nthis occasions the explosion, which we call a clap of thunder. The light\r\nwe then see is the lightning, or the thunderbolt. Sometimes we see only\r\na sudden and momentary flash, at other times it is a train of fire,\r\ntaking different forms and directions. The explosion attending the\r\nlightning, shows that it is the vapours which occasion the thunder; by\r\ntaking fire suddenly, they agitate and dilate the air violently. At\r\nevery electrical spark a clap is heard. The thunder is sometimes\r\ncomposed of several claps or prolonged and multiplied by echoes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we see a flash of lightning, we have only to reckon the\r\nseconds in a watch, or how often our pulse beats, between the flash and\r\nthe clap. Whoever can reckon ten pulsations between the lightning and\r\nthe thunder, is still at the distance of a quarter of a league from the\r\nstorm; for it is calculated that the sound takes nearly the time of\r\nforty pulsations, in going a league. The lightning does not always go in\r\na direct line from top to bottom. It often winds about and goes zigzag,\r\nand sometimes it does not lighten till very near the ground. The\r\ncombustible matter which reaches the ground, or takes fire near it,\r\nnever fails to strike. But sometimes it is not strong enough to approach\r\nus, and like an ill-charged cannon, it disperses in the atmosphere and\r\ndoes no harm. When, on the contrary, the fiery exhalations reach the\r\nground, they sometimes make terrible havoc.\r\n\r\nWe may judge of the prodigious force of the lightning by the wonderful\r\neffects it produces. The heat of the flame is such, that it burns and\r\nconsumes every thing that is combustible. It even melts metals, but it\r\noften spares what is contained in them, when they are of a substance\r\nnot too close to leave the passage free. It is by the velocity of the\r\nlightning that the bones of men and animals are sometimes calcined,\r\nwhile the flesh remains unhurt. That the strongest buildings are thrown\r\ndown, trees split, or torn up by the root, the thickest of walls\r\npierced, stones and rocks broken, and reduced to ashes. It is to the\r\nrarification and violent motion of the air, produced by the heat and\r\nvelocity of the lightning, that we must attribute the death of men and\r\nanimals found suffocated, without any appearance of having been struck\r\nby lightning.\r\n\r\n“Experience teaches us, that the rain which falls when it thunders, is\r\nthe most fruitful to the earth. The saline and sulphurous particles\r\nwhich fill the atmosphere during a storm, are drawn down by the rain,\r\nand become excellent nourishment for the plants; without mentioning the\r\nnumber of small worms, seeds, and little insects which are also drawn\r\ndown in thunder showers, and are with the help of a microscope, visible\r\nin the drops of water.”[311]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn August, 1769, a flash of lightning fell upon the theatre at Venice,\r\nin which were more than six hundred persons. Besides killing several of\r\nthe audience, it put out the candles, singed a lady’s hair, and melted\r\nthe gold case of her watch and the fringe of her robe. The earrings of\r\nseveral ladies were melted, and the stones split; and one of the\r\nperformers in the orchestra, had his violincello shattered in a thousand\r\nsplinters, but received no damage himself.[312]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 61·97.\r\n\r\n  [303] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [304] If the berries be gathered in wet weather, an hour will not be\r\n  too long a time to boil them.\r\n\r\n  [305] I have heard of the distress among the weavers, and heaven\r\n  forbid that I should speak lightly of their calamities!--But eat they\r\n  _must_, and _eat they do_: and if reduced to _bread, so called_,\r\n  butter, or cheese, is included; it is this I regret, for jam would be\r\n  cheaper as well as more wholesome, and should be purchased at the\r\n  shops as other articles of consumption are.\r\n\r\n  [306] As they are called, near the uncultivated moorland waste where\r\n  they grow. _Wortleberrey_ is the correct name.\r\n\r\n  [307] Mr. Rodd seldom adventures in paper and print, yet he has put\r\n  forth a “second edition, with considerable additions,” of a curious\r\n  and useful little volume bearing the modest title of “An Attempt at a\r\n  Glossary of some words used in Cheshire, communicated to the Society\r\n  of Antiquarians.

His funeral was conducted with princely\r\nmagnificence by his patron, the duke of Susa, and his memory was\r\ncelebrated with suitable pomp in all the theatres of Spain.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega was the rival and conqueror of Cervantes in the dramatic\r\nart; yet in his youth he embarked in the celebrated Spanish armada, for\r\nthe invasion of England, and spent part of his life in civil and\r\nmilitary occupations.\r\n\r\nHis invention is as unparalleled in the history of poetry, as the talent\r\nwhich enabled him to compose regular and well constructed verse with as\r\nmuch ease as prose. Cervantes, on this account, styled him a prodigy of\r\nnature. His verses flowed freely, and such was his confidence in his\r\ncountrymen, that as they applauded his writings, which were unrestrained\r\nby critical notes, he refused conformity to any restrictions. “The\r\npublic,” he said, “paid for the drama, and the taste of those who paid\r\nshould be suited.”\r\n\r\nHe required only four-and-twenty hours to write a versified drama of\r\nthree acts, abounding in intrigues, prodigies, or interesting\r\nsituations, and interspersed with sonnets and other versified\r\naccompaniments. In general the theatrical manager carried away what De\r\nVega wrote before he had time to revise it, and a fresh applicant often\r\narrived to prevail on him to commence a new piece immediately. In some\r\ninstances he composed a play in the short space of three or four hours.\r\nThis astonishing facility enabled him to supply the Spanish theatre with\r\nupwards of two thousand original dramas. According to his own testimony\r\nhe wrote on an average five sheets every day, and at this rate he must\r\nhave produced upwards of twenty millions of verses.\r\n\r\nHe was enriched by his talents, and their fame procured him\r\ndistinguished honours. He is supposed at one time to have possessed\r\nupwards of a hundred thousand ducats, but he was a bad economist, for\r\nthe poor of Madrid shared his purse. He was elected president of the\r\nspiritual college in that capital; and pope Urban VIII. sent him the\r\ndegree of doctor in divinity with a flattering letter, and bestowed on\r\nhim the cross of Malta; he was also appointed fiscal of the apostolic\r\nchamber, and a familiar of the inquisition, an office regarded\r\nsingularly honourable at that period. Whenever he appeared in the\r\nstreets, boys ran shouting after him; he was surrounded by crowds of\r\npeople, all eager to gain a sight of the “prodigy of nature;” and those\r\nwho could not keep pace with the rest, stood and gazed on him with\r\nwonder as he passed.\r\n\r\nLope de Vega’s inexhaustible fancy and fascinating ease of composition,\r\ncommunicated that character to Spanish comedy; and all subsequent\r\nSpanish writers trod in his footsteps, until its genius was banished by\r\nthe introduction of the French taste into Spain.[313]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 60·77.\r\n\r\n  [313] Bouterwek.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 27.~\r\n\r\n\r\n1688. A DATE IN PANYER-ALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe editor has received a present from Mr. John Smith of a wood block,\r\nengraved by himself, as a specimen of his talents in that department of\r\nart, and in acknowledgment of a friendly civility he is pleased to\r\nrecollect at so long a distance from the time when it was offered, that\r\nit only dwelt in his own memory.\r\n\r\nThe impression from this engraving, and the accompanying information,\r\nwill acquaint the reader with an old London “effigy” which many may\r\nremember to have seen. It is the only cut in the present sheet; for an\r\narticle on a popular amusement, which will require a considerable number\r\nof engravings, is in preparation, and the artists are busily engaged on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nConcerning this stone we must resort to old Stow. According to this\r\n“honest chronicler,” he peregrinated to where this stone now stands, and\r\nwhere in his time stood “the church of St. Michael ad Bladudum, or at\r\nthe _corne_ (‘corruptly,’ he says, ‘at the _querne_,’) so called,\r\nbecause in place thereof, was sometime a corne-market. At the west end\r\nof this parish church is a small passage for people on foot thorow the\r\nsame church;” and he proceeds to throw the only light that seems to\r\nappear on this stone, “and west from the said church, some distance, is\r\nanother passage out of Paternoster-row, and is called (of such _a\r\nsigne_) Panyer-alley, which commeth out into the north, over against\r\nSaint Martin’s-lane.”\r\n\r\nIt is plain from Stow’s account, that Panyer-alley derived its name from\r\n“a signe,” but what that “signe” was we are ignorant of. It may have\r\nbeen a tavern-sign, and this stone _may_ have been the ancient sign in\r\nthe wall of the tavern. It represents a boy seated on a panyer, pressing\r\na bunch of grapes between his hand and his foot. By some people it is\r\ncalled “the Pick-my-toe.” The inscription mentions the date when it was\r\neither repaired or put up in its present situation in a wall on the\r\neast side of the alley, and affirms that the spot is the highest ground\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Effigy in Panyer-alley, Paternoster-row.~]\r\n\r\nWhile we are at this place, it is amusing to remark what Stow observes\r\nof Ivy-lane, which runs parallel with Panyer-alley westward. He says,\r\nthat “Ivie-lane” was “so called of _ivie_ growing on the walls of the\r\nprebend’s houses,” which were situated in that lane; “but now,” speaking\r\nof his own days, “the lane is replenished on both sides with faire\r\nhouses, and divers offices have been there kept, by registers, namely,\r\nfor the prerogative court of the archbishop of Canturbury, the probate\r\nof wils, which is now removed into Warwicke-lane, and also for the lord\r\ntreasurer’s remembrance of the exchequer, &c.”\r\n\r\nHence we see that in Ivy-lane, now a place of mean dwelling, was one of\r\nthe great offices at present in Doctors’ Commons, and another of equal\r\nimportance belonging to the crown; but the derivation of its name from\r\nthe ivy on the walls of the prebends’ houses, an adjunctive ornament\r\nthat can scarcely be imagined by the residents of the closely confined\r\nneighbourhood, is the pleasantest part of the narration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Stow also tells us of “Mount-goddard-street,” which “goeth up to the\r\nnorth end of Ivie-lane,” of its having been so called “of the tippling\r\nthere, and the _goddards_ mounting from the tappe to the table, from the\r\ntable to the mouth, and some times over the head.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Goddards._\r\n\r\nThese were cups or goblets made with a cover or otherwise. In “Tancred\r\nand Gismunda,” an old play, we are told, “Lucrece entered, attended by a\r\nmaiden of honour with a covered _goddard_ of gold, and, drawing the\r\ncurtains, she offered unto Gismunda to taste thereof.” So also Gayton,\r\nin his “Festivous Notes on Don Quixote,” mentions--\r\n\r\n    “A _goddard_, or an anniversary spice bowl,\r\n    Drank off by th’ gossips.”\r\n\r\n_Goddard_, according to Camden, means “godly the cup,” and appears to\r\nMr. Archdeacon Nares, who cites these authorities to have been a\r\nchristening cup. That gentleman can find no certain account of the\r\norigin of the name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps _goddard_ was derived from “godward:” we had looking godward,\r\nand thinking godward, and perhaps drinking godward, for a benediction\r\nmight have been usual at a christening or solemn merry-making; and from\r\nthence godward drinking might have come to the godward cup, and so the\r\n_goddard_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUCKOO.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--If the following “Address to the Cuckoo,” from my work on birds,\r\nshould suit the pages of the _Every-Day Book_, it is quite at your\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOf the cuckoo, I would just observe, that I do not think,\r\nnotwithstanding all that Dr. Jenner has written concerning it, its\r\nnatural history is by any means fully developed. I have had some\r\nopportunities of observing the habits of this very singular bird, and in\r\nme there is room for believing that, even when at maturity, it is\r\nsometimes, if not frequently, _fed by other birds_. It is very often\r\nattended by one, two, or even more, small birds, during its flight, for\r\nwhat purpose is not, I believe, at present known. The “wry-neck,” _junx\r\ntorquilla_, called in some provinces the “cuckoo’s maiden,” is said to\r\nbe one of these. Perhaps it may be novel information to your readers to\r\nbe told, that there is a bird in the United States of America, called\r\n“Cowpen,” _emberiza pecoris_, by Wilson, which lays her eggs in other\r\nbird’s nests, in a similar way to the cuckoo in this country: the\r\n“cowpen” is, however, a much smaller bird than the cuckoo.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  JAMES JENNINGS.\r\n\r\n  _Dalby-terrace, City-road,_\r\n\r\n  _August 28, 1826._\r\n\r\nTO THE CUCKOO.\r\n\r\n    Thou monotonous bird! whom we ne’er wish away,\r\n    Who hears thee not pleas’d at the threshold of May\r\n    Thy advent reminds us of all that is sweet,\r\n    Which nature, benignant, now lays at our feet;\r\n    Sweet flowers--sweet meadows--sweet birds and their loves;\r\n    Sweet sunshiny mornings, and sweet shady groves;\r\n    Sweet smiles of the maiden--sweet looks of the youth,\r\n    And sweet asseverations, too, prompted by truth;\r\n    Sweet promise of plenty throughout the rich vale;\r\n    And sweet the bees’ humming in meadow and vale;\r\n    Of the summer’s approach--of the presence of spring,\r\n    For ever, sweet cuckoo! continue to sing.\r\n    Oh, who then, dear bird! could e’er wish thee away,\r\n    Who hears thee not pleas’d at the threshold of May\r\n\r\nAs every trait in the natural history of birds is interesting, I beg\r\nleave to state that I shall be greatly obliged to any reader of the\r\n_Every-Day Book_ for the communication of any _novel_ fact or\r\ninformation concerning this portion of the animal kingdom, of which\r\nsuitable acknowledgment will be made in my work.

They\r\nwere taken up by him, and sold in Preston market the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOAX AT NORWICH.\r\n\r\nThe following bill was in circulation in Norwich and the neighbourhood\r\nfor days previous, and on the evening of August 28, 1826, 20,000\r\nsagacious people from the city and country around, on foot, on\r\nhorseback, in chaises, gigs, and other vehicles, collected below the\r\nhill to witness the extraordinary performance.\r\n\r\n  “_St. James’s-hill, back of the Horse-barracks._\r\n\r\n“The public are respectfully informed that signor Carlo Gram Villecrop,\r\nthe celebrated Swiss mountain-flyer, from Geneva and Mont Blanc, is just\r\narrived in this city, and will exhibit, with a Tyrolese pole fifty feet\r\nlong, his most astonishing gymnastic flights, never before witnessed in\r\nthis country. Signor Villecrop has had the great honour of exhibiting\r\nhis most extraordinary feats on the continent before the king of\r\nPrussia, Emperor of Austria, the Grand duke of Tuscany, and all the\r\nresident nobility in Switzerland. He begs to inform the ladies and\r\ngentlemen of this city, that he has selected St. James’s-hill and the\r\nadjoining hills for his performances, and will first display his\r\nremarkable strength, in running up the hill with his Tyrolese pole\r\nbetween his teeth. He will next lay on his back, and balance the same\r\npole on his nose, chin, and different parts of his body. He will climb\r\nup on it with the astonishing swiftness of a cat, and stand on his head\r\nat the top; on a sudden he will leap three feet from the pole without\r\nfalling, suspending himself by a shenese cord only. He will also walk on\r\nhis head, up and down the hill, balancing his pole on one foot. Many\r\nother feats will be exhibited, in which signor Villecrop will display to\r\nthe audience the much admired art of toppling, peculiar only to the\r\npeasantry of Switzerland. He will conclude his performance by repeated\r\nflights in the air, up and down the hill, with a velocity almost\r\nimperceptible, assisted only by his pole, with which he will frequently\r\njump the astonishing distance of forty and fifty yards at a time.

His death is known to have been occasioned by his remonstrance\r\nto Herod against his notorious cruelties. “In consequence of this,” says\r\nMr. Audley, “Herod imprisoned him in the castle of Machærus, and would\r\nhave put him to death, but was afraid of the people.” Herodias also\r\nwould have killed John, had it been in her power. At length, on Herod’s\r\nbirthday, Salome, the daughter of Herodias, by her former husband,\r\nPhilip, danced before him, his captains, and chief estates, or the\r\nprincipal persons of Galilee. This so pleased Herod, that he “promised\r\nher, with an oath, whatsoever she should ask, even to the half of his\r\nkingdom.” Hearing this, she ran to her mother and said, “what shall I\r\nask?” The mother, without hesitation, replied, “the head of John the\r\nBaptist.” Herod was exceedingly sorry when he heard such a request; but\r\nout of regard to his oaths and his guests, he immediately sent an\r\nexecutioner to behead John in prison. This was instantly done, and the\r\nhead being brought in a charger, was given to Salome; and she,\r\nforgetting the tenderness of her sex, and the dignity of her station,\r\ncarried it to her mother.\r\n\r\nJerome says, that “Herodias treated the baptist’s head in a very\r\ndisdainful manner, pulling out the tongue which she imagined had injured\r\nher, and piercing it with a needle.” Providence, however, as Dr. Whitby\r\nobserves, interested itself very remarkably in the revenge of this\r\nmurder on all concerned. Herod’s army was defeated in a war occasioned\r\nby his marrying Herodias, which many Jews thought a judgment on him for\r\nthe death of John. Both he, and Herodias, whose ambition occasioned his\r\nruin, were afterwards driven from their kingdom, and died in banishment,\r\nat Lyons, in Gaul. And if any credit may be given to Nicephorus, Salome,\r\nthe young lady who made the cruel request, fell into the ice as she was\r\nwalking over it, which, closing suddenly, cut off her head.\r\n\r\nIt is added by Mr. Audley, that the abbot Villeloin says in his memoirs,\r\n“the head of St. John the Baptist was saluted by him at Amiens, and it\r\nwas the _fifth_ or _sixth_ he had had the honour to kiss.”\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP CHICHELEY.\r\n\r\nLord Orford, in a letter dated the 29th of August, says, “I have just\r\nbeen reading a new public history of the colleges of Oxford, by Anthony\r\nWood, and there found a feature in a character that always offended me,\r\nthat of archbishop Chicheley, who prompted Henry V. to the invasion of\r\nFrance, to divert him from squeezing the overgrown clergy. When that\r\npriest meditated founding All Souls college, and ‘consulted his friends,\r\nwho seem to have been honest men, what great matters of piety he had\r\nbest perform to God in his old age, he was advised by them to build an\r\nhospital for the wounded and sick soldiers, that daily returned from the\r\nwars then had in France.’ I doubt his grace’s friends thought as I do of\r\nhis artifice.--‘But,’ continues the historian, ‘disliking these motions,\r\nand valuing the welfare of the deceased more than the wounded and\r\ndiseased, he resolved with himself to promote his design--which was to\r\nhave masses said for the king, queen, and himself, &c., while living,\r\nand for their souls when dead;’ and that mummery, the old foolish rogue,\r\nthought more efficacious than ointments and medicines for the wretches\r\nhe had made! and of the chaplains and clerks he instituted in that\r\ndormitory, one was to teach grammar, and another prick song. How history\r\nmakes one shudder and laugh by turns!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ECCENTRIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--I trouble you with an account of an eccentric character, which\r\nmay, perhaps, amuse some of your numerous readers, if it should meet\r\nyour approbation.\r\n\r\n  Yours, most respectfully,\r\n\r\n  C. C----y, M. R. C. S. E.\r\n\r\n  Ashton Under Lyne,\r\n\r\n  _July 17th, 1826_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLY BUTTERWORTH.\r\n\r\nNear the summit of a small hill, called Gladwick Lowes, situated on the\r\nborders of Lancashire, near the populous town of Oldham, commanding a\r\nvery extensive prospect, stands the solitary, yet celebrated hut of\r\n“Billy Butterworth.” The eccentric being who bears this name from his\r\nmanner of dressing an immense beard reaching to his girdle, and many\r\nother singularities, has obtained the name of the “hermit,” though from\r\nthe great numbers that daily and hourly visit him from all parts, he has\r\nno real claim to the title.\r\n\r\nBilly Butterworth’s hut is a rude building of his own construction, a\r\npiece of ground having been given him for the purpose. In the building\r\nof this hut, the rude hand of uncultivated nature laughed to scorn the\r\nimprovements of modern times, for neither saw, nor plane, nor level, nor\r\ntrowel, assisted to make it appear gracious in the eye of taste; a rude\r\nheap of stones, sods of earth, moss, &c. without nails or mortar are\r\npiled together in an inelegant, but perfectly convenient manner, and\r\nform a number of apartments. The whole building is so firmly put\r\ntogether, that its tenant fears not the pelting of a merciless storm,\r\nbut snug under his lowly roof appears equally content with the smiles or\r\nfrowns of fortune.\r\n\r\nTo give a proper description of the hermit’s hut, would be very\r\ndifficult, but a brief sketch will enable the reader to form a pretty\r\ngood idea of the object. It is surrounded by a fancy and kitchen garden,\r\nfancifully decorated with rude seats, arches, grottos, &c., a few\r\nplaister of Paris casts are here and there placed so as to have a\r\npleasing effect. The outer part of the hut consists of the hermit’s\r\nchapel, in which is a half-length figure of the hermit himself. To this\r\nchapel the hermit retires at certain hours, in devotion to his Maker;\r\nbesides the chapel is an observatory, where the hermit amuses his\r\nnumerous visiters, by exhibiting a small and rather imperfect camera\r\nobscura of his own construction, by which he is enabled to explain the\r\nsurrounding country for four or five miles. Near the camera obscura is a\r\nraised platform, almost on a level with the roof of the hermitage--this\r\nhe calls “the terrace.” From the terrace there is a beautiful view of\r\ncountry.--The towns of Ashton-under-Lyne, Stockport, Manchester, lie in\r\nthe distance, with the adjacent villages, and the line of Yorkshire\r\nhills, from among which “_Wild Bank_” rises majestically above its\r\nneighbours. The hermit makes use of this situation, to give signals to\r\nthe village at the foot of the hill, when he wishes to be supplied with\r\nany article of provision for the entertainment of his visiters, such as\r\nliquors, cream, sallads, bread, &c.; of confectionary, he has generally\r\na good stock.\r\n\r\nWe next come to his summer arbours, which are numerous in his garden,\r\nand furnished with table and seats for parties to enjoy themselves\r\nseparately, without interfering with others. The dovehouse is placed in\r\nthe garden, where he keeps a few beautiful pairs of doves. Of the\r\nout-buildings, the last we shall describe, is the carriage-house. The\r\nreader smiles at the word “carriage” in such a situation, and would be\r\nmore apt to believe me had I said a wheel-barrow. But no! grave reader,\r\n“Billy Butterworth” runs his carriage, which is of the low gig kind,\r\ndrawn by an ass, and on some extra visits, by two asses. A little boy,\r\ncalled Adam, is the postillion, as there is only seating for one in the\r\ncarriage. The boy acts as a waiter in busy times. In this carriage\r\n“Billy Butterworth” visits his wealthy neighbours, and meets with a\r\ngracious reception. He frequently visits the earl of Stamford, earl de\r\nWilton, &c. &c. From his grotesque dress and equipage, he excites mirth\r\nto a great degree.\r\n\r\nThe inner part of this hermit’s hut consists of many different\r\napartments, all of which are named in great style; such as the servants’\r\nhall--pavilion--drawing-room--dining-room--library, &c. &c. The walls\r\nare lined with drapery, tastefully hung, and the furniture exhibits\r\nnumerous specimens of ancient carved woodwork. Pictures of all sorts\r\nfrom the genuine oil painting, &c. prints of good line engraving down to\r\nthe common caricature daubs, are numerously hung in every part of the\r\nhut. Natural curiosities are so placed, as to excite the curiosity of\r\nthe gazing ignoramus.\r\n\r\n“Billy Butterworth” is himself a tall man, of rather a commanding\r\nfigure, with dark hair and dark sparkling eyes. His countenance is of a\r\npleasing but rather melancholy appearance, which is increased by an\r\nimmensely long black beard which makes him an object of terror to the\r\nneighbouring children. On the whole, although he is now in the evening\r\nof life, the remains of a once handsome man are very evident. His dress\r\nis varied according to the seasons, but always resembling the costume in\r\nking Charles’s days; a black cap, black ostrich feather and buckle, long\r\nwaistcoat, jacket with silk let into the sleeves, small clothes of the\r\nsame, and over the whole a short mantle.\r\n\r\n“Billy Butterworth” has practised these whims, if I may call them so,\r\nfor twelve or fourteen years in this solitary abode. His reason for this\r\nmanner of life is not exactly known, but he seems to acknowledge in some\r\ndegree, that a disappointment in love has been the cause. Let that rest\r\nas it will, he has a handsome property, accumulated, it is said, by\r\nthese eccentric means. Indeed he acknowledged to the author of this,\r\nthat on fine days in summer, he has realized from selling sweetmeats,\r\nand receiving gifts from visiters, five guineas a day. He is so\r\nindependent now that he will not receive a present from friends. He is\r\ncommunicative as long as a stranger will listen, but if the stranger is\r\ninquisitive he ceases to converse any thing more. He is polite and well\r\ninformed on general topics, and has evidently read much.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the hermit was lately on a journey to his friends, a mischievous\r\nwag advertised “the hut,” &c. to be let. The day fixed upon being rainy,\r\nno bidders made their appearance. I send you a copy of the advertisement\r\nfrom a printed one in my possession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO BE LET,\r\n\r\nFor a term of years, or from year to year; and may be entered upon\r\nimmediately, all that hut, garden, and premises, with the appurtenances,\r\nsituate at Gladwick Lowes, near Oldham, in the county of Lancaster, now\r\noccupied as an\r\n\r\nHERMITAGE,\r\n\r\n_By Mr. Wm. Butterworth_.\r\n\r\nThis romantic spot being the only place of fashionable resort in the\r\nvicinity of the populous town of Oldham, and the unrivalled reputation\r\nwhich it has so long deservedly enjoyed, render it peculiar desirable to\r\nany gentleman who may wish to acquire an independency at a trifling\r\nrisk. The motive for the intended removal of the present proprietor is,\r\nhis having already secured a comfortable competency, joined to a desire\r\nof giving some gentleman of a disposition similar to his own, an\r\nopportunity of participating in the advantages which he has so long\r\nderived from this delightful retirement.\r\n\r\n  Among the many curiosities with which his sequestered hut abounds, may\r\n  be particularized the following valuable articles.\r\n\r\n  His celebrated self-constructed Bed.\r\n\r\n  _A Table_,\r\n\r\n  which is supposed formerly to have belonged to some of the ancient\r\n  saxon monarchs, and was presented to Mr. B., by her grace the duchess\r\n  of Beaufort.\r\n\r\n  Praxitele’s stature of Jupiter Ammon, brought from Greece, by the\r\n  right honourable the earl of Elgin, and came into the hands of the\r\n  present possessor, through the medium of the duke of Devonshire, after\r\n  it had, for a considerable period, formed one of the most permanent\r\n  ornaments of his grace’s splendid mansion, Chatsworth house.\r\n\r\nA capital portrait of Mrs. Siddons, painted by B. West, Esq., P. R. A.\r\n\r\nA most excellent and peculiarly constructed Camera Obscura, which\r\ndistinctly represents objects at the distance of thirty miles.\r\n\r\nA sonorous Speaking Trumpet, wonderfully adapted to the present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nA brace of pistols, formerly the property of Blind Jack of\r\nKnaresborough, by whom they were cut out of solid rock.\r\n\r\nA very ancient and most curious Trebduchet, a relic of Ptolemy the\r\nThird’s Sarcophagus.\r\n\r\nA variety of coins, medals, shells, fossils, and other mineral\r\nproductions, tastefully classified and arranged.\r\n\r\nIt would be very desirable if the above could be disposed of with the\r\nhermitage, but if not, Mr. B. would be willing to enter into a separate\r\nagreement for them. For further particulars, apply to Mr. W. B.\r\n\r\nN.B. The stock of pop, peppermint, gingerbread, and Eccles cakes, with\r\nthe signboards, dials, inscriptions, rams’ horns, and other tasteful and\r\nappropriate decorations, will be required to be taken at a valuation.\r\n\r\nTo be let Monday August 29, 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOAX “IN CHANCERY.”\r\n\r\nThere is a spirit of waggery which contributes to public amusement, and\r\noccasionally annoys individual repose. The following lines are in a\r\njournal of this day 1826.\r\n\r\nA VISION.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF CHRISTABEL.\r\n\r\n    “Up!” said the spirit, and ere I could pray\r\n    One hasty orison, whirl’d me away\r\n    To a limbo, lying--I wist not where--\r\n    Above or below, in earth or air;\r\n    All glimmering o’er with a _doubtful_ light,\r\n    One couldn’t say whether ’twas day or night;\r\n    And crost by many a mazy track,\r\n    One didn’t know how to get on or back;\r\n    And I felt like a needle that’s going astray\r\n    (With its _one_ eye out) through a bundle of hay:\r\n    When the spirit he grinn’d, and whisper’d me,\r\n    “Thou’rt now in the Court of Chancery!”\r\n\r\n    Around me flitted unnumber’d swarms\r\n    Of shapeless, bodiless, tailless forms;\r\n    (Like bottled-up babes, that grace the room\r\n    Of that worthy knight, sir Everard Home)--\r\n    All of them, things half-kill’d in rearing;\r\n    Some were lame--some wanted _hearing_;\r\n    Some had through half a century run,\r\n    Though they hadn’t a leg to stand upon.\r\n\r\n    Others, more merry, as just beginning,\r\n    Around on a _point of law_ were spinning;\r\n    Or balanced aloft, ’twixt _Bill_ and _Answer_,\r\n    Lead at each end, like a tight rope dancer.--\r\n    Some were so _cross_, that nothing could please ’em;--\r\n    Some gulp’d down _affidavits_ to ease ’em;\r\n    All were in motion, yet never a one,\r\n    Let it _move_ as it might, could ever move _on_.\r\n    “These,” said the spirit, “you plainly see,\r\n    Are what they call suits in Chancery!”\r\n\r\n    I heard a loud screaming of old and young,\r\n    Like a chorus by fifty Vellutis’ sung;\r\n    Or an Irish dump (“the words by Moore”)\r\n    At an amateur concert scream’d in score;--\r\n    So harsh on my ear that wailing fell\r\n    Of the wretches who in this limbo dwell!\r\n    It seem’d like the dismal symphony\r\n    Of the shapes Æneas in hell did see;\r\n    Or those frogs, whose legs a barbarous cook\r\n    Cut off and left the frogs in the brook,\r\n    To cry all night, till life’s last dregs,\r\n    “Give us our legs!--give us our legs!”\r\n    Touched with the sad and sorrowful scene,\r\n    I ask’d what all this yell might mean,\r\n    When the spirit replied with a grin of glee,\r\n    “’Tis the cry of the suitors in Chancery!”\r\n\r\n    I look’d, and I saw a wizard rise,\r\n    With a wig like a cloud before men’s eyes.\r\n    In his aged hand he held a wand,\r\n    Wherewith he beckoned his embryo hand,\r\n    And then mov’d and mov’d, as he wav’d it o’er,\r\n    But they never got on one inch more,\r\n    And still they kept limping to and fro,\r\n    Like Ariels’ round old Prospero--\r\n    Saying, “dear master, let us go,”\r\n    But still old Prospero answer’d “No.”\r\n    And I heard, the while, that wizard elf,\r\n    Muttering, muttering spells to himself,\r\n    While over as many old papers he turn’d,\r\n    As Hume e’er moved for or Omar burn’d.\r\n    He talk’d of his virtue--though some, less nice,\r\n    (He own’d with a sigh) preferr’d his _Vice_--\r\n    And he said, “I think”--“I doubt”--“I hope”--\r\n    Call’d God to witness, and damn’d the Pope;\r\n    With many more sleights of tongue and hand\r\n    I couldn’t, for the soul of me, understand.\r\n    Amaz’d and poz’d, I was just about\r\n    To ask his name, when the screams without\r\n    The merciless clack of the imps within,\r\n    And that conjurer’s mutterings, made such a din,\r\n    That, startled, I woke--leap’d up in my bed--\r\n    Found the spirit, the imps, and the conjurer fled.\r\n    And bless’d my stars, right pleas’d to see,\r\n    That I wasn’t, as yet, in Chancery.\r\n\r\nFor several years before the appearance of his solemn “Aids to\r\nReflection” in 1825, Mr. Coleridge had been to the world “as though he\r\nwas not;” and since that “Hand-book” of masterly sayings his voice has\r\nceased from the public. Forgotten he could not be, yet when he was\r\nremembered it was by inquiries concerning his present “doings,” and\r\nwhispers of his “whereabout.” On a sudden the preceding verses startle\r\nthe dull town, and dwelling on the lazy ear, as being, according to\r\ntheir printed ascription, “by the author of Christabel.” In vindication\r\nof himself against the misconception of the wit of their real author,\r\nthe imputed parent steps forth in the following note.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.\r\n\r\n  _Grove, Highgate, Tuesday Evening._\r\n\r\nSir,--I have just received a note from a city friend, respecting a poem\r\nin “The Times” of this morning ascribed to me. On consulting the paper,\r\nI see he must refer to “A Vision,” by the author of “Christabel.” Now,\r\nthough I should myself have interpreted these words as the author, I\r\ndoubt not, intended them, viz., as a part of the fiction; yet with the\r\nproof before me that others will understand them literally, I should\r\nfeel obliged by your stating, that till this last half hour the poem and\r\nits publication were alike unknown to me; and I remain, Sir,\r\nrespectfully yours,\r\n\r\n  S.

This lady is\r\ncelebrated in Scottish annals for having heroically and successfully\r\nassisted the young Pretender to escape, when a price was set upon his\r\nhead. Her self-devotion is minutely recorded in the late Mr. Boswell’s\r\n“Ascanius,” and Johnson has increased her fame by his notice of her\r\nperson and character, in his “Tour to the Hebrides.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 62·95.\r\n\r\n\r\n~August 31.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPERS.\r\n\r\nIt was observed at the end of August, 1742, great damage was done to the\r\npastures in the country, particularly about Bristol by swarms of\r\ngrasshoppers; and the like happened in the same year at Pennsylvania to\r\na surprising degree.[314]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1476, “Grasshoppers and the great rising of the river Isula did\r\nspoyle al Poland.”[315]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers are infested by a species of “insect parasites” thicker\r\nthan a horse hair, and of a brown colour. It consumes the intestines,\r\nand at first sight in the body of the grasshopper, has been mistaken for\r\nthe intestines themselves.\r\n\r\nThe eminent entomologist who mentions this fact, observes that “insects\r\ngenerally answer the most beneficial ends, and promote in various ways,\r\nand in an extraordinary degree, the welfare of man and animals.” The\r\nevils resulting from them occur partially when they abound beyond their\r\nnatural limits, “God permitting this occasionally to take place, not\r\nmerely with punitive views, but also to show us what mighty effects he\r\ncan produce by instruments seemingly the most insignificant: thus\r\ncalling upon us to glorify his power, wisdom, and goodness, so evidently\r\nmanifested, whether he relaxes or draws tight the reins by which he\r\nguides insects in their course, and regulates their progress; and more\r\nparticularly to acknowledge his overruling Providence so conspicuously\r\nexhibited by his measuring them, as it were, and weighing them, and\r\ntaking them out, so that their numbers, forces, and powers, being\r\nannually proportioned to the work he has prescribed to them, they may\r\nneither exceed his purpose, nor fall short of it.”[316]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF NIGHTINGALES.\r\n\r\n_A Scene near the Hotwells, Bristol._[317]\r\n\r\n    “Then said I, master, pleasant is this place\r\n      And sweet are those melodious notes I hear;\r\n    And happy they, among man’s toiling race,\r\n      Who, of their cares forgetful, wander near.”\r\n\r\n  _Bowles._\r\n\r\nTo those who might not happen to know St. Vincent’s rocks, Clifton, and\r\nthe very beautiful scenery near the Hotwells, Bristol, it might be\r\ndesirable to state that the river Avon winds here through a sinuous\r\ndefile, on one side of which “the rocks” rise perpendicularly in a bold\r\nyet irregular manner, to the height of many hundred feet; the opposite\r\nside is not so bold, but it is, nevertheless, extremely beautiful, being\r\nclothed in many places with wood, and has besides a VALLEY, through\r\nwhich you may ascend to Leigh Down. This valley has been named the\r\n“_Valley of Nightingales_,” no doubt, in consequence of those birds\r\nmaking it their resort.\r\n\r\n    “Where foliaged full in vernal pride\r\n      Retiring winds thy favourite vale;\r\n    And faint the moan of Avon’s tide,\r\n      Remurmurs to the nightingale.”\r\n\r\n  _C. A. Elton’s Poems, Disappointment._\r\n\r\nIn a note, Mr. ELTON informs us that this stanza alludes to the “Valley\r\nof Nightingales opposite St. Vincent’s rocks at Clifton.” The lovers of\r\nthe picturesque will here find ample gratification. If, in the following\r\npoem, the truth in natural history be a little exceeded in reference to\r\na _troop_ of nightingales, it is hoped that the poetical licence will be\r\npardoned. The vicinity of the Hotwells has been lately much improved by\r\na carriage drive beneath and around those rocks.\r\n\r\n    Seest thou yon tall ROCKS where, midst sunny light beaming,\r\n      They lift up their heads and look proudly around;\r\n    While numerous _choughs_, with their cries shrill and screaming,\r\n      Wheel from crag unto crag, and now o’er the profound?\r\n\r\n    Seest thou yonder VALLEY where gushes the fountain;\r\n      Where the _nightingales_ nestling harmoniously sing;\r\n    Where the _mavis_ and _merle_ and the merry _lark_ mounting,\r\n      In notes of wild music, now welcome the spring.\r\n\r\n    Seest thou yonder shade, where the _woodbine_ ascending,\r\n      Encircles the _hawthorn_ with amorous twine,\r\n    With the _bryony_ scandent, in gracefulness blending;\r\n      What sweet mingled odours scarce less then divine!\r\n\r\n    Hearest thou the blue _ring-dove_ in yonder tree cooing;\r\n      The _red-breast_, the _hedge-sparrow_, warble their song;\r\n    The _cuckoo_, with sameness of note ever wooing;\r\n      Yet ever to pleasure such notes will belong!\r\n\r\n    And this is the VALLEY OF NIGHTINGALES;--listen\r\n      To those full-swelling sounds, with those pauses between,\r\n    Where the bright waving shrubs, midst the pale hazels, glisten,\r\n      There oft may a troop of the songsters be seen.\r\n\r\n    Seest thou yon proud ship on the stream adown sailing,\r\n      O’er ocean, her course, to strange climes she now bends;\r\n    Oh! who may describe the deep sobs or heart-wailing\r\n      Her departure hath wrought amongst lovers and friends?\r\n\r\n    The rocks now re-echo the songs of the sailor\r\n      As he cheerfully bounds on his watery way;\r\n    But the maiden!--ah! what shall that echo avail her,\r\n      When absence and sorrow have worn out the day?\r\n\r\n    Behold her all breathless, still gazing, pursuing,\r\n      And waving, at times, with her white hand adieu;\r\n    On the rock now she sits, with fixed eye, the ship viewing;\r\n      No picture of fancy--but often too true.\r\n\r\n    Dost thou see yon flush’d HECTIC, of health poor remainder,\r\n      With a dark hollow eye, and a thin sunken cheek;\r\n    While AFFECTION hangs o’er him with thoughts that have pained her,\r\n      And that comfort and hope, still forbid her to speak?[318]\r\n\r\n    Yes, FRIENDSHIPS!

T.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKESBURY HARVEST HOME.\r\n\r\n_September, 1824._--After dinner, at Wotton-under-edge, we toiled up the\r\nside and then struck off again towards the middle of the hills, leaving\r\nall beauty in the rear; and from thence, until our arrival at Bath the\r\nnext day, nothing is worth recording, but one little pleasing incident,\r\nwhich was the celebration of a harvest-home, at the village of\r\nHawkesbury, on the top of Cotswold.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the isolated hamlet, we were “aware” of a\r\n_Maypole_--that unsophisticated trophy of innocence, gaiety, and plenty;\r\nand as we drew near, saw that it was decorated with flowers and ribands\r\nfluttering in the evening breeze. Under it stood a waggon with its full\r\ncomplement of men, women, children, flowers, and corn; and a handsome\r\nteam of horses tranquilly enjoying their share of the finery and revelry\r\nof the scene; for scarlet bows and sunflowers had been lavished on their\r\nwinkers with no niggard hand. On the first horse sat a damsel, no doubt\r\nintending to represent Ceres; she had on, of course, a white dress and\r\nstraw bonnet--for could Ceres or any other goddess appear in a rural\r\nEnglish festival in any other costume? A broad yellow sash encompassed a\r\nwaist that evinced a glorious and enormous contempt for classical\r\nproportion and modern folly in its elaborate dimensions.\r\n\r\nDuring the rapid and cordial glance that I gave this questionable scion\r\nof so graceful a stock, I ascertained two or three circumstances--that\r\nshe was good-natured, that she enjoyed the scene as a downright English\r\njoke, and that she had the most beautiful set of teeth I ever beheld.\r\nWhat a stigma on all tooth-doctors, tooth-powders, and tooth-brushes.\r\nThere was something very affecting in this simple festival, and I felt\r\nmy heart heave, and that the fields looked indistinct for some minutes\r\nafter we had lost sight of its primitive appearance; however it may now,\r\nI thought, be considered by the performers as a “good joke,” it had its\r\norigin, doubtless, in some of the very finest feelings that can adorn\r\nhumanity--hospitality, sociality, happiness, contentment, piety, and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nOur fair correspondent adds:--\r\n\r\nP.S.--Intelligence could surely be obtained from the spot, or the\r\nneighbourhood, of the manner of celebrating the festival; it is probably\r\npeculiar to the range of the Cotswold; and a more elaborate account of\r\nso interesting a custom would, doubtless, be valuable to yourself, sir,\r\nas well as to your numerous readers. I can only regret that my ability\r\ndoes not equal my will, on this or any other subject, that would forward\r\nyour views in publishing your admirable _Every-Day Book_.\r\n\r\nThe editor inserts this hint to his readers in the neighbourhood of\r\nCotswold, with a hope that it will induce them to oblige him with\r\nparticulars of what is passing under their eyes at this season every\r\nday. He repeats that accounts of these, or any other customs in any part\r\nof the kingdom, will be especially acceptable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent has obligingly complied with an often expressed\r\ndesire on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING ON SUNDAY.\r\n\r\n  _London, August 4, 1826._\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--As you request, on the wrapper of your last part, communications,\r\n&c., respecting harvest, I send you the following case of a very\r\nsingular nature, that came before the synod of Glasgow and Ayr.\r\n\r\nIn the harvest of 1807, there was a great deal of wet weather. At the\r\nend of one of the weeks it brightened up, and a drying wind prepared the\r\ncorn for being housed. The rev. Mr. Wright, minister of Mayhole, at the\r\nconclusion of the forenoon service on the following sabbath-day, stated\r\nto his congregation, that he conceived the favourable change of the\r\nweather might be made use of to save the harvest on that day, without\r\nviolating the sabbath. Several of his parishioners availed themselves of\r\ntheir pastor’s advice. At the next meeting of presbytery, however, one\r\nof his reverend brethren thought proper to denounce him, as having\r\nviolated the fourth commandment; and a solemn inquiry was accordingly\r\nvoted by a majority of the presbytery. Against this resolution, a\r\ncomplaint and appeal were made to the synod at the last meeting. Very\r\nable pleadings were made on both sides, after which it was moved and\r\nseconded,--“That the synod should find that the presbytery of Ayr have\r\nacted in this manner, in a precipitate and informal manner, and that\r\ntheir sentence ought to be reversed.” It was also moved and\r\nseconded,--“That the synod find the presbytery of Ayr have acted\r\nproperly, and that it should be remitted to them to take such further\r\nsteps in this business as they may judge best.” After reasoning at\r\nconsiderable length, the synod, without a vote, agreed to set aside the\r\nwhole proceedings of the presbytery in this business.[320]\r\n\r\nThis subject reminds me of the following verses to urge the use of “the\r\ntime present.”\r\n\r\nDELAYS.\r\n\r\n_By Robert Southwell, 1595._\r\n\r\n    Shun delays, they breed remorse;\r\n      Take thy time, while time is lent thee;\r\n    Creeping snails have weakest force;\r\n      Fly their fault, lest thou repent thee;\r\n    Good is best, when soonest wrought,\r\n    Ling’ring labours come to naught.\r\n\r\n    Hoist up sail while gale doth last,\r\n      Tide and wind stay no man’s pleasure;\r\n    Seek not time, when time is past,\r\n      Sober speed is wisdom’s leisure.\r\n    After wits are dearly bought,\r\n    Let thy fore-wit guide thy thought.\r\n\r\n    Time wears all his locks behind;\r\n      Take thou hold upon his forehead;\r\n    When he flies, he turns no more,\r\n      And behind his scalp is naked.\r\n    Works adjourn’d have many stays;\r\n    Long demurs breed new delays.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obliged and constant reader,\r\n\r\n  R. R.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are informed on the authority of Macrobius, that among the heathens,\r\nthe masters of families, when they had got in their harvest, were wont\r\nto feast with their servants, who had laboured for them in tilling the\r\nground. In exact conformity to this, it is common among Christians, when\r\nthe fruits of the earth are gathered in, and laid in their proper\r\nrepositories, to provide a plentiful supper for the harvest men and the\r\nservants of the family. At this entertainment, all are in the modern\r\nrevolutionary idea of the word, perfectly equal. Here is no distinction\r\nof persons, but master and servant sit at the same table, converse\r\nfreely together, and spend the remainder of the night in dancing,\r\nsinging, &c., in the most easy familiarity. Bourne thinks the origin of\r\nboth these customs is Jewish, and cites Hospinian, who tells us that the\r\nheathens copied after this custom of the Jews, and at the end of their\r\nharvest, offered up their first-fruits to the gods, for the Jews\r\nrejoiced and feasted at the getting in of the harvest.\r\n\r\nThis festivity is undoubtedly of the most remote antiquity. That men in\r\nall nations, where agriculture flourished, should have expressed their\r\njoy on this occasion by some outward ceremonies, has its foundation in\r\nthe nature of things. Sowing is hope; reaping, fruition of the expected\r\ngood. To the husbandman, whom the fear of wet, blights, &c. had\r\nharrassed with great anxiety, the completion of his wishes could not\r\nfail of imparting an enviable feeling of delight. Festivity is but the\r\nreflex of inward joy, and it could hardly fail of being produced on this\r\noccasion, which is a temporary suspension of every care.[321]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Brand brings a number of passages to show the manner of celebrating\r\nthis season.\r\n\r\nOne of the “Five hundred points of husbandry” relates to August.\r\n\r\n    Grant harvest-lord more, by a penny or twoo,\r\n    To call on his fellowes the better to doo:\r\n    Give gloves to thy reapers a _Larges_ to crie,\r\n    And daily to loiterers have a good eie.\r\n\r\n  _Tusser._\r\n\r\n“Tusser Redivivus,” in 1744, says, “He that is the lord of harvest, is\r\ngenerally some stayed sober-working man, who understands all sorts of\r\nharvest-work. If he be of able body, he commonly leads the swarth in\r\nreaping and mowing. It is customary to give gloves to reapers,\r\nespecially where the wheat is thistly. As to crying _a Largess_, they\r\nneed not be reminded of it in these our days, whatever they were in our\r\nauthor’s time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStevenson, in his “Twelve Moneths,” 1661, mentions under August, that\r\n“the furmenty pot welcomes home the harvest cart, and the garland of\r\nflowers crowns the captain of the reapers; the battle of the field is\r\nnow stoutly fought. The pipe and the tabor are now busily set a-work,\r\nand the lad and the lass will have no lead on their heels. O! ’tis the\r\nmerry time wherein honest neighbours make good cheer; and God is\r\nglorified in his blessings on the earth.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HOCK CART, OR HARVEST HOME.\r\n\r\n    Come sons of summer, by whose toile\r\n    We are the Lords of wine and oile;\r\n    By whose tough labours, and rough hands,\r\n    We rip up first, then reap our lands,\r\n    Crown’d with the eares of corne, now come,\r\n    And, to the pipe, sing harvest home.\r\n    Come forth, my Lord, and see the cart,\r\n    Drest up with all the country art.\r\n    See here a maukin, there a sheet\r\n    As spotlesse pure as it is sweet:\r\n    The horses, mares, and frisking fillies,\r\n    Clad, all, in linnen, white as lillies,\r\n    The harvest swaines and wenches bound\r\n    For joy, to see the hock-cart crown’d.\r\n    About the cart heare how the rout\r\n    Of rural younglings raise the shout;\r\n    Pressing before, some coming after,\r\n    Those with a shout, and these with laughter.\r\n    Some blesse the cart; some kisse the sheaves;\r\n    Some prank them up with oaken leaves:\r\n    Some crosse the fill-horse; some with great\r\n    Devotion stroak the home-borne wheat:\r\n    While other rusticks, lesse attent\r\n    To prayers than to merryment,\r\n    Run after with their breeches rent.\r\n    Well, on brave boyes, to your Lord’s hearth\r\n    Glitt’ring with fire, where, for your mirth,\r\n    You shall see first the large and cheefe\r\n    Foundation of your feast, fat beefe:\r\n    With upper stories, mutton, veale,\r\n    Add bacon, which makes full the meale;\r\n    With sev’rall dishes standing by,\r\n    As here a custard, there a pie,\r\n    And here all-tempting frumentie,\r\n    And for to make the merrie cheere\r\n    If smirking wine be wanting here,\r\n    There’s that which drowns all care, stout beere,\r\n    Which freely drink to your Lord’s health,\r\n    Than to the plough, the commonwealth;\r\n    Next to your flailes, your fanes, your fatts\r\n    Then to the maids with wheaten hats;\r\n    To the rough sickle, and the crookt sythe\r\n    Drink, frollick, boyes, till all be blythe,\r\n    Feed and grow fat, and as ye eat,\r\n    Be mindfull that the lab’ring neat,\r\n    As you, may have their full of meat;\r\n    And know, besides, ye must revoke\r\n    The patient oxe unto the yoke,\r\n    And all goe back unto the plough\r\n    And harrow, though they’re hang’d up now.\r\n    And, you must know, your Lord’s word’s true,\r\n    Feed him ye must, whose food fils you.\r\n    And that this pleasure is like raine,\r\n    Not sent ye for to drowne your paine.\r\n    But for to make it spring againe.\r\n\r\n  _Herrick._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Hoacky is brought\r\n      Home with hallowin,\r\n    Boys with plumb-cake\r\n      The cart following.\r\n\r\n  _Poor Robin_, 1676.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Brand says, “the respect shown to servants at this season, seems to\r\nhave sprung from a grateful sense of their good services. Every thing\r\ndepends at this juncture on their labour and despatch. Vacina, (or\r\nVacuna, so called as it is said _à vacando_, the tutelar deity, as it\r\nwere, of rest and ease,) among the ancients, was the name of the goddess\r\nto whom rustics sacrificed at the conclusion of harvest. Moresin tells\r\nus, that popery, in imitation of this, brings home her chaplets of corn,\r\nwhich she suspends on poles, that offerings are made on the altars of\r\nher tutelar gods, while thanks are returned for the collected stores,\r\nand prayers are made for future ease and rest. Images too of straw or\r\nstubble, he adds, are wont to be carried about on this occasion; and\r\nthat in England he himself saw the rustics bringing home in a cart, a\r\nfigure made of corn, round which men and women were singing\r\npromiscuously, preceded by a drum or piper.”\r\n\r\nThe same collector acquaints us that Newton, in his “Tryall of a Man’s\r\nowne Selfe,” (12mo. London, 1602,) under breaches of the second\r\ncommandment, censures “the adorning with garlands, or presenting unto\r\nany image of any saint whom thou hast made speciall choice of to be thy\r\npatron and advocate, the firstlings of thy increase, as corne and\r\ngraine, and other oblations.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ceres._\r\n\r\nAs we were returning, says Hentzner, in 1598, to our inn, we happened to\r\nmeet some country people celebrating their harvest-home; their last load\r\nof corn they crown with flowers, having besides an image richly dressed,\r\nby which perhaps they would signify Ceres. This they keep moving about,\r\nwhile men and women, men and maid-servants, riding through the streets\r\nin the cart, shout as loud as they can till they arrive at the barn.\r\n\r\n“I have seen,” says Hutchinson in his “History of Northumberland,” “in\r\nsome places, an image apparelled in great finery, crowned with flowers,\r\na sheaf of corn placed under her arm, and a scycle in her hand, carried\r\nout of the village in the morning of the conclusive reaping day, with\r\nmusic and much clamour of the reapers, into the field, where it stands\r\nfixed on a pole all day, and when the reaping is done, is brought home\r\nin like manner. This they call the harvest queen, and it represents the\r\nRoman Ceres.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brand says, “an old woman, who in a case of this nature is\r\nrespectable authority, at a village in Northumberland, informed me that\r\nnot half a century ago, they used every where to dress up something\r\nsimilar to the figure above described, (by Hutchinson,) at the end of\r\nharvest, which was called a harvest doll, or _kern baby_. This northern\r\nword is plainly a corruption of corn baby, or image, as is the _kern_\r\nsupper, of corn supper. In Carew’s ‘Survey of Cornwall,’ p. 20. b. ‘an\r\nill kerned or saved harvest’ occurs.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Wellington in Devonshire, the clergyman of the parish informed Mr.\r\nBrand, that when a farmer finishes his reaping, a small quantity of the\r\nears of the last corn are twisted or tied together into a curious kind\r\nof figure, which is brought home with great acclamations, hung up over\r\nthe table, and kept till the next year. The owner would think it\r\nextremely unlucky to part with this, which is called “a knack.” The\r\nreapers whoop and hollow “a knack! a knack! well cut! well bound! well\r\nshocked!” and, in some places, in a sort of mockery it is added, “well\r\nscattered on the ground.” A countryman gave a somewhat different\r\naccount, as follows: “When they have cut the corn, the reapers assemble\r\ntogether: ‘a knack’ is made, which one placed in the middle of the\r\ncompany holds up, crying thrice ‘a knack,’ which all the rest repeat:\r\nthe person in the middle then says--\r\n\r\n    ‘Well cut! well bound!\r\n    Well shocked! well saved from the ground.’\r\n\r\nHe afterwards cries ‘whoop,’ and his companions holloo as loud as they\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“I have not,” says Mr. Brand, “the most distant idea of the etymology of\r\nthe ‘knack,’ used on this occasion. I applied for one of them. No farmer\r\nwould part with that which hung over his table; but one was made on\r\npurpose for me. I should suppose that Moresin alludes to something like\r\nthis when he says, ‘Et spiceas papatus (habet) coronas, quas videre est\r\nin domibus,’ &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is noticed by Mr. Brand, that Purchas in his “Pilgrimage,” speaking\r\nof the Peruvian superstitions, and quoting Acosta, tells us, “In the\r\nsixth moneth they offered a hundred sheep of all colours, and then made\r\na feast, bringing the mayz from the fields into the house, which they\r\nyet use. This feast is made, coming from the farm to the house, saying\r\ncertain songs, and praying that the mayz may long continue. They put a\r\nquantity of the mayz (the best that groweth in their farms) in a thing\r\nwhich they call pirva, with certain ceremonies, watching three nights.\r\nThen do they put it in the richest garment they have, and, being thus\r\nwrapped and dressed, they worship this pirva, holding it in great\r\nveneration, and saying, it is the mother of the mayz of their\r\ninheritance, and that by this means the mayz augments and is preserved.\r\nIn this moneth they make a particular sacrifice, and the witches demand\r\nof this pirva if it hath strength enough to continue until the next\r\nyear; and if it answers no, then they carry this maiz to the farm whence\r\nit was taken, to burn, and make another pirva as before: and this\r\nfoolish vanity still continueth.”\r\n\r\nOn this Peruvian “pirva,” the rev. Mr. Walter, fellow of\r\nChrist’s-college, Cambridge, observes to Mr. Brand, that it bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to what is called in Kent, an _ivy girl_, which is a\r\nfigure composed of some of the best corn the field produces, and made,\r\nas well as they can, into a human shape; this is afterwards curiously\r\ndressed by the women, and adorned with paper trimmings, cut to resemble\r\na cap, ruffles, handkerchief, &c. of the finest lace. It is brought\r\nhome with the last load of corn from the field upon the waggon, and they\r\nsuppose entitles them to a supper at the expense of their employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Crying the Mare._”\r\n\r\nThis custom is mentioned by Mr. Brand as existing in Hertfordshire and\r\nShropshire. The reapers tie together the tops of the last blades of\r\ncorn, which they call “mare,” and standing at some distance, throw their\r\nsickles at it, and he who cuts the knot, has the prize, with\r\nacclamations and good cheer. Blount adds, respecting this custom, that\r\n“after the knot is cut, then they cry with a loud voice three times, ‘I\r\nhave her.’ Others answer as many times, ‘what have you?’--‘A mare, a\r\nmare, a mare.’--‘Whose is she,’ thrice also.--‘J. B.’ (naming the owner\r\nthree times.)--‘Whither will you send her?’--‘To J. a Nicks,’ (naming\r\nsome neighbour who has not all his corn reaped;) then they all shout\r\nthree times, and so the ceremony ends with good cheer. In Yorkshire,\r\nupon the like occasion, they have a harvest dame; in Bedfordshire, a\r\nJack and a Gill.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving been preceded “into the bosom of the land” by a lady, and become\r\nacquainted with accounts from earlier chroniclers of harvest customs, we\r\nnow pay our respects to the communications of other correspondents, who\r\nhave been pleased to comply with our call for information.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTERSHIRE AND SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--With pleasure I have read your entertaining and instructing\r\ncollection from its commencement, and I perceive you have touched upon a\r\nsubject in one of your sheets, which in my youth used to animate my\r\nsoul, and bring every energy of my mind and of my body into activity; I\r\nmean, harvest.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, in my younger days I was introduced into the society of\r\ninnocence and industry; but, I know not how it was, Dame Fortune kicked\r\nme out, and I was obliged to dwell in smoke and dirt, in noise and\r\nbustle, in wickedness and strife compared with what I left; but I\r\nforgive her, as you know she is blind. May I, Mr. Editor, converse with\r\nyou in this way a little?\r\n\r\nIn _Gloucestershire_ this interesting season is thus kept. Of course the\r\ngood man of the house has informed the industrious and notable dame the\r\nday for harvest-home; and she, assisted by her daughters, makes every\r\npreparation to keep out famine and banish care--the neighbours and\r\nfriends are invited, hot cakes of Betty’s own making, and such butter\r\nthat Sukey herself had churned, tea, ale, syllabub, gooseberry wine, &c.\r\nAnd what say you? Why, Mr. Editor, this is nothing, this is but the\r\nbeginning--the grand scene is out of doors. Look yonder, and see the\r\nwhole of the troop of men, women, and children congregated together.\r\nThey are about to bring home the last load. You have seen election\r\nchairings, Mr. Editor; these are mere jokes to it. This load should come\r\nfrom the furthest field, and that it should be the smallest only just\r\nabove the rails, a large bough is placed in the centre, the women and\r\nchildren are placed on the load, boys on the horses, they themselves\r\ntrimmed with cowslips and boughs of leaves, and with shouts of\r\n“harvest-home,” the horses are urged forward, and the procession comes\r\nfull gallop to the front of the farm-house, where the before happy party\r\nare waiting to welcome home the _last load_. Now, he who has the loudest\r\nand the clearest voice, mounts upon a neighbouring shed, and with a\r\nvoice which would do credit to your city crier, shouts aloud--\r\n\r\n    We have ploughed, we have sowed,\r\n    We have reaped, we have mowed,\r\n    We have brought home every load,\r\n    Hip, hip, hip, _Harvest home_!\r\n\r\nand thus, sir, the whole assembly shout “huzza.” The strong ale is then\r\nput round, and the cake which Miss made with her own hands:--the load is\r\nthen driven round to the stack-yard or barn, and the horses put into the\r\nstable. John puts on a clean white frock, and William a clean coloured\r\nhandkerchief: the boys grease their shoes to look smart, and all meet in\r\nthe house to partake of the harvest supper, when the evening is spent in\r\ncheerfulness. Here, Mr. Editor, is pomp without pride, liberality\r\nwithout ostentation, cheerfulness without vice, merriment without guilt,\r\nand happiness without alloy.\r\n\r\nThey say that old persons are old fools and although I am almost blind,\r\nyet I cannot resist telling you of what I have also seen in my boyish\r\ndays in _Suffolk_. I do not mean to be long, sir, but merely to give you\r\na few particulars of an ancient custom, which I must leave you to\r\nfinish, so that while you take a hearty pinch of snuff (I know you don’t\r\nlike tobacco) I shall have completed.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of harvest one is chosen to be “my lord.” He goes\r\nfirst in reaping, and mowing, and leads in every occupation. Now, sir,\r\nif you were to pass within a field or two of this band of husbandmen,\r\n“my lord” would leave the company, and approaching you with respect, ask\r\nof you a _largess_. Supposing he succeeded, which I know he would, he\r\nwould hail his companions, and they would thus acknowledge the gift: my\r\nlord would place his troop in a circle, suppose fifteen men, and that\r\nthey were reaping, each one would have a hook in his hand, or, if hoeing\r\nof turnips, he would bring his hoe. My lord then goes to a distance,\r\nmounts the stump of a tree, or a gate post, and repeats a couplet\r\n(forgive the treachery of my memory, for I forget the words). The men\r\nstill standing in the circle listen with attention to the words of my\r\nlord, and at the conclusion each with his reap-hook pointing with his\r\nright hand to the centre of the circle, and with intent as if watching\r\nand expecting, they utter altogether a groan as long as four of your\r\nbreves (if you go by notes): then, as if impelled together, their eyes\r\nare lifted to the heavens above them, their hooks point in the same\r\ndirection, and at the same time they change the doleful groan to a\r\ntremendous shout, which is repeated three distinct times.\r\n\r\nThe money thus got during harvest, is saved to make merry with at a\r\nneighbouring public-house, and the evening is spent in shouting of the\r\n_largess_, and joyful mirth.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  S. M.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent presents an interesting description of usages in\r\nanother county.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORFOLK.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _---- Norfolk, August, 14, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--In this county it is a general practice on the first day of\r\nharvest, for the men to leave the field about four o’clock, and retire\r\nto the alehouse, and have what is here termed a “whet;” that is, a sort\r\nof drinking bout to cheer their hearts for labour. They previously\r\nsolicit any who happen to come within their sight with, “I hope, sir,\r\nyou will please to bestow a _largess_ on us?” If the boon is conceded\r\nthe giver is asked if he would like to have his _largess_ halloed; if\r\nthis is assented to, the hallooing is at his service.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of wheat harvest, it is usual for the master to give\r\nhis men each a pot or two of ale, or money, to enable them to get some\r\nat the alehouse, where a cheerful merry meeting is held amongst\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe _last_, or “horkey load” (as it is here called) is decorated with\r\nflags and streamers, and sometimes a sort of _kern baby_ is placed on\r\nthe top at front of the load. This is commonly called a “ben;” why it is\r\nso called, I know not, nor have I the smallest idea of its etymon,\r\nunless a person of that name was dressed up and placed in that\r\nsituation, and that, ever after, the figure had this name given to it.\r\nThis load is attended by all the party, who had been in the field, with\r\nhallooing and shouting, and on their arrival in the farmyard they are\r\njoined by the others. The mistress with her maids are out to gladden\r\ntheir eyes with this welcome scene, and bestir themselves to prepare the\r\nsubstantial, plain, and homely feast, of roast beef and plumb pudding.\r\n\r\nOn this night it is still usual with some of the farmers to invite their\r\nneighbours, friends, and relations, to the “_horkey supper_.” Smiling\r\nfaces grace the festive board; and many an ogling glance is thrown by\r\nthe rural lover upon the nut-brown maid, and returned with a blushing\r\nsimplicity, worth all the blushes ever made at court. Supper ended, they\r\nleave the room, (the cloth, &c. are removed,) and out of doors they go,\r\nand a hallooing “_largess_” commences--thus\r\n\r\n[Music: Hallo! Lar- - - - - - - - -gess.\r\n\r\n(_ad infinitum._)\r\n\r\n(_with three successive Whoops._)]\r\n\r\nThe men and boys form a circle by taking hold of hands, and one of the\r\nparty standing in the centre, having a _gotch_[322] of horkey ale placed\r\nnear him on the ground, with a horn or tin sort of trumpet in his hand,\r\nmakes a signal, and “halloo! lar-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-ge-ess” is given as\r\nloud and as long as their lungs will allow, at the same time elevating\r\ntheir hands as high as they can, and still keeping hold. The person in\r\nthe centre blows the horn one continued blast, as long as the\r\n“halloo-largess.” This is done three times, and immediately followed by\r\nthree successive whoops; and then the _glass_, commonly a _horn_ one, of\r\nspirit-stirring ale, freely circles. At this time the hallooing-largess\r\nis generally performed with three times three.\r\n\r\nThis done, they return to the table, where foaming nappy ale is\r\naccompanied by the lily taper tube, and weed of India growth; and now\r\nmirth and jollity abound, the horn of sparkling beverage is put merrily\r\nabout, the song goes round, and the joke is cracked. The females are\r\ncheerful and joyous partakers of this “flow of soul.”\r\n\r\nWhen the “juice of the barrel” has exhilarated the spirits, with eyes\r\nbeaming cheerfulness, and in true good rustic humour, the lord of the\r\nharvest accompanied by his lady, (the person is so called who goes\r\nsecond in the reap, each sometimes wearing a sort of disguise,) with two\r\nplates in his hand, enters the parlour where the guests are seated, and\r\nsolicits a largess from each of them. The collection made, they join\r\ntheir party again at the table, and the lord recounting to his company\r\nthe success he has met with, a fresh zest is given to hilarity, a dance\r\nis struck up, in which, though it can hardly be said to be upon the\r\n“light fantastic toe,” the stiffness of age and rheumatic pangs are\r\nforgotten, and those who have passed the grand climactric, feel in the\r\nmidst of their teens.\r\n\r\nAnother show of _disguising_ is commonly exhibited on these occasions,\r\nwhich creates a hearty rustic laugh, both loud and strong. One of the\r\nparty habited as a female, is taken with a violent pang of the tooth\r\nache, and the doctor is sent for. He soon makes his appearance, mounted\r\non the back of one of the other men as a horse, having in his hands a\r\ncommon milking stool, which he bears upon, so as to enable him to keep\r\nhis back in nearly a horizontal position. The doctor brings with him the\r\ntongs, which he uses for the purpose of extracting the tooth: this is a\r\npiece of tobacco pipe adapted to the occasion, and placed in the mouth;\r\na fainting takes place from the violence of the operation, and the\r\nbellows are used as a means of causing a reviving hope.\r\n\r\nWhen the ale has so far operated that some of the party are scarcely\r\ncapable of keeping upon their seat, the ceremony of drinking healths\r\ntakes place in a sort of glee or catch; one or two of which you have\r\nbelow. This health-drinking generally finishes the horkey. On the\r\nfollowing day the party go round among the neighbouring farmers (having\r\nvarious coloured ribands on their hats, and steeple or sugar-loaf formed\r\ncaps, decked with various coloured paper, &c.,) to taste _their horkey\r\nbeer_, and solicit largess of any one with whom they think success is\r\nlikely. The money so collected is usually spent at the alehouse at\r\nnight. To this “largess money spending,” the wives and sweethearts, with\r\nthe female servants of their late masters, are invited; and a tea table\r\nis set out for the women, the men finding more virtue in the decoction\r\nof Sir John Barleycorn, and a pipe of the best Virginia.\r\n\r\nI have put together what now occurs to me respecting harvest-home, and\r\nbeg to refer you to Bloomfield’s “Wild Flowers,” in a piece there called\r\nthe “Horkey;” it is most delightfully described.\r\n\r\nThe glee or catch at the health-drinking is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Here’s a health unto our master,\r\n    He is the finder of the feast:\r\n    God bless his endeavours,\r\n    And send him increase,\r\n    And send him increase, boys,\r\n    All in another year.\r\n\r\n    Here’s your master’s good health\r\n    So drink off your beer;\r\n    I wish all things may prosper,\r\n    Whate’er he takes in hand;\r\n    We are all his servants,\r\n    And are all at his command.\r\n\r\n    So drink, boys, drink,\r\n    And see you do not spill;\r\n    For if you do,\r\n    You shall drink two,\r\n    For ’tis your master’s will.\r\n\r\n_Another Health Drinking._\r\n\r\n    Behold, and see, his glass is full,\r\n    At which he’ll take a hearty pull,\r\n    He takes it out with such long wind,\r\n    That he’ll not leave one drop behind.\r\n\r\n    Behold and see what he can do,\r\n    He has not put it in his shoe;\r\n    He has not drank one drop in vain,\r\n    He’ll slake his thirst, then drink again.\r\n\r\n    Here’s a health unto my brother John,\r\n    It’s more than time that we were gone;\r\n    But drink your fill, and stand your ground,\r\n    This health is called the plough-boys round.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the following.\r\n\r\n_A Health Drinking._\r\n\r\n    There was a man from London came,\r\n    With a rum-bum-bum-bare-larum;\r\n    Drink up your glass for that’s the game,\r\n    And say ne’er a word, except--Mum.\r\n\r\nThe great object is to start something which will catch some unguarded\r\nreply in lieu of saying “Mum,” when the party so unguardedly replying,\r\nis fined to drink two glasses.\r\n\r\nFor the beginning of Harvest there is this\r\n\r\n_Harvest Song._\r\n\r\n      Now Lammas comes in,\r\n        Our harvest begin,\r\n      We have done our endeavours to get the corn in;\r\n        We reap and we mow\r\n        And we stoutly blow\r\n      And cut down the corn\r\n                      That did sweetly grow.\r\n\r\n        The poor old man\r\n        That can hardly stand,\r\n      Gets up in the morning, and do all he can,\r\n        Gets up, &c.\r\n      I hope God will reward\r\n                Such old harvest man.\r\n\r\n      But the man who is lazy\r\n        And will not come on,\r\n      He slights his good master\r\n      And likewise his men;\r\n      We’ll pay him his wages\r\n        And send him gone,\r\n      For why should we keep\r\n        Such a lazy drone.\r\n\r\n      Now harvest is over\r\n      We’ll make a great noise,\r\n        Our master, he says,\r\n      You are welcome, brave boys;\r\n        We’ll broach the old beer,\r\n        And we’ll knock along,\r\n    And now we will sing an old harvest song.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy if this will afford the readers of the _Every-Day Book_\r\nany information concerning the harvest customs of this county.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  ~G. H. I.~\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA valuable correspondent transmits a particular account of his country\r\ncustom, which will be read with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVON.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--As the harvest has now become very general, I am reminded of a\r\ncircumstance, which I think worthy of communicating to you. After the\r\nwheat is all cut, on most farms in the north of Devon, the harvest\r\npeople have a custom of “crying the neck.” I believe that this practice\r\nis seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the country. It is\r\ndone in this way. An old man, or some one else well acquainted with the\r\nceremonies used on the occasion, (when the labourers are reaping the\r\nlast field of wheat,) goes round to the shocks and sheaves, and picks\r\nout a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he\r\nties up very neat and trim, and plats and arranges the straws very\r\ntastefully. This is called “the neck” of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After\r\nthe field is cut out, and the pitcher once more circulated, the reapers,\r\nbinders, and the women, stand round in a circle. The person with “the\r\nneck” stands in the centre, grasping it with both his hands. He first\r\nstoops and holds it near the ground, and all the men forming the ring,\r\ntake off their hats, stooping and holding them with both hands towards\r\nthe ground. They then all begin at once in a very prolonged and\r\nharmonious tone to cry “the neck!” at the same time slowly raising\r\nthemselves upright, and elevating their arms and hats above their heads;\r\nthe person with “the neck” also raising it on high. This is done three\r\ntimes. They then change their cry to “wee yen!”--“way yen!”--which they\r\nsound in the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with singular\r\nharmony and effect, three times. This last cry is accompanied by the\r\nsame movements of the body and arms as in crying “the neck.” I know\r\nnothing of vocal music, but I think I may convey some idea of the sound,\r\nby giving you the following notes in gamut.\r\n\r\n[Music: _Very Slow._\r\n\r\nWe yen! We yen!]\r\n\r\nLet these notes be played on a flute with perfect _crescendos_ and\r\n_diminuendoes_, and perhaps some notion of this wild sounding cry may be\r\nformed. Well, after having thus repeated “the neck” three times, and\r\n“wee yen” or “way yen” as often, they all burst out into a kind of loud\r\nand joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering\r\nabout and perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets “the neck,”\r\nand runs as hard as he can down to the farm-house, where the dairy-maid,\r\nor one of the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a\r\npail of water. If he who holds “the neck” can manage to get into the\r\nhouse, in any way unseen, or openly, by any other way than the door at\r\nwhich the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss\r\nher; but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused with the contents of the\r\nbucket. On a fine still autumn evening, the “crying of the neck” has a\r\nwonderful effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish\r\nmuezzin, which lord Byron eulogizes so much, and which he says is\r\npreferable to all the bells in Christendom. I have once or twice heard\r\nupwards of twenty men cry it, and sometimes joined by an equal number of\r\nfemale voices. About three years back, on some high grounds, where our\r\npeople were harvesting, I heard six or seven “necks” cried in one night,\r\nalthough I know that some of them were four miles off. They are heard\r\nthrough the quiet evening air, at a considerable distance sometimes. But\r\nI think that the practice is beginning to decline of late, and many\r\nfarmers and their men do not care about keeping up this old custom. I\r\nshall always patronise it myself, because I take it in the light of a\r\nthanksgiving. By the by, I was about to conclude, without endeavouring\r\nto explain the meaning of the words, “we yen!” I had long taken them for\r\nSaxon, as the people of Devon are the true Saxon breed. But I think that\r\nI am wrong. I asked an old fellow about it the other day, and he is the\r\nonly man who ever gave me a satisfactory explanation. He says, that the\r\nobject of crying “the neck” is to give the surrounding country notice of\r\nthe _end_ of harvest, and that they mean by “we yen!” _we have ended_.\r\nIt may more probably mean “we end,” which the uncouth and provincial\r\npronunciation has corrupted into “we yen!”\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  _July, 1826._\r\n\r\n  R. A. R.\r\n\r\nP. S. In the above hastily written account, I should have mentioned that\r\n“the neck” is generally hung up in the farm-house, where it remains\r\nsometimes three or four years. I have written “we yen,” because I have\r\nalways heard it so pronounced; they may articulate it differently in\r\nother parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSEX.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--As harvest has began in various counties, I beg leave to give you\r\na description of what is called the “harvest supper,” in Essex, at the\r\nconclusion of the harvest.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the harvest, a supper is provided, consisting of\r\nroast beef and plum pudding, with plenty of strong ale, with which all\r\nthe men who have been employed in getting in the corn regale themselves.\r\nAt the beginning of the supper, the following is sung by the whole of\r\nthem at the supper.\r\n\r\n    Here’s a health to our master,\r\n      The lord of the feast,\r\n    God bless his endeavours,\r\n      And send him increase;\r\n    May prosper his crops, boys,\r\n      That we may reap another year,\r\n    Here’s your master’s good health, boys,\r\n      Come, drink off your beer.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the following:--\r\n\r\n    Now harvest is ended and supper is past,\r\n      Here’s our mistress’s good health, boys,\r\n    Come, drink a full glass;\r\n      For she is a good woman, she provides us good cheer,\r\n    Here’s your mistress’s good health, boys,\r\n      Come, drink off your beer.\r\n\r\nThe night is generally spent with great mirth, and the merry-makers\r\nseldom disperse till “Bright Phœbus has mounted his chariot of day.”\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  AN ESSEX MAN AND SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the advice of the most popular of our old writers on husbandry,\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n    In harvest time, harvest folke,\r\n      servants and all,\r\n    Should make, altogether,\r\n      good cheere in the hall:\r\n    And fill out the black bole,\r\n      of bleith to their song,\r\n    And let them be merry\r\n      all harvest time long.\r\n    Once ended thy harvest,\r\n      let none be beguilde,\r\n    Please such as did please thee,\r\n      man, woman, and child.\r\n    Thus doing, with alway\r\n      such help as they can,\r\n    Thou winnest the praise\r\n      of the labouring man.\r\n\r\n  _Tusser._\r\n\r\n“Tusser Redivivus” says, “This, the poor labourer thinks, crowns all; a\r\ngood supper must be provided, and every one that did any thing towards\r\nthe Inning must now have some reward, as ribbons, laces, rows of pins to\r\nboys and girls, if never so small, for their encouragement, and, to be\r\nsure, plumb-pudding. The men must now have some better than best drink,\r\nwhich, with a little tobacco and their screaming for their _largesses_,\r\ntheir business will soon be done.”\r\n\r\n_Harvest Goose._\r\n\r\n    For all this good feasting,\r\n      yet art thou not loose,\r\n    Til Ploughman thou givest\r\n      his _harvest home goose_;\r\n    Though goose goe in stubble,\r\n      I passe not for that,\r\n    Let goose have a goose,\r\n      be she lean, be she fat.\r\n\r\n  _Tusser._\r\n\r\nWhereon “Tusser Redivivus” notes, that “the goose is forfeited, if they\r\noverthrow during harvest.” A MS. note on a copy of Brand’s\r\n“Antiquities,” lent to the editor, cites from Boys’s “Sandwich,” an item\r\n“35 Hen. VIII. Spent when we ete our harvyst goose iij^{s}. vi^{d}. and\r\nthe goose x^{d}.”\r\n\r\nIn France under Henry IV. it is cited by Mr. Brand from Seward, that\r\n“after the harvest, the peasants fixed upon some holiday to meet\r\ntogether and have a little regale, (by them called the _harvest\r\ngosling_,) to which they invited not only each other, but even their\r\nmasters, who pleased them very much when they condescended to partake of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to information derived by Mr. Brand, it was formerly the\r\ncustom at Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, for each farmer to drive furiously\r\nhome with the last load of his corn, while the people ran after him with\r\nbowls full of water in order to throw on it; and this usage was\r\naccompanied with great shouting.\r\n\r\nHARVEST-HOME.\r\n\r\n    Who has not seen the cheerful harvest-home,\r\n    Enliv’ning the scorch’d field, and greeting gay\r\n    The slow decline of Autumn.

When the dawn\r\n    Unfolds its sunny lustre, and the dew\r\n    Silvers the out-stretch’d landscape, labour’s sons\r\n    Rise, ever healthful,--ever cheerily,\r\n    From sweet and soothing rest; for fev’rish dreams\r\n    Visit not lowly pallets! All the day\r\n    They toil in the fierce beams of fervid noon--\r\n    But toil without repining! The blithe song\r\n    Joining the woodland melodies afar,\r\n    Fling its rude cadence in fantastic sport\r\n    On Echo’s airy wing! the pond’rous load\r\n    Follows the weary team: the narrow lane\r\n    Bears on its thick-wove hedge the scatter’d corn,\r\n    Hanging in scanty fragments, which the thorn\r\n    Purloin’d from the broad waggon.\r\n                                  To the brook\r\n    That ripples, shallow, down the valley’s slope,\r\n    The herds slow measure their unvaried way;--\r\n    The flocks along the heath are dimly seen\r\n    By the faint torch of ev’ning, whose red eye\r\n    Closes in tearful silence.

All around\r\n    The thin mist rises, and the busy tones\r\n    Of airy people, borne on viewless wings,\r\n    Break the short pause of nature. From the plain\r\n    The rustic throngs come cheerly, their loud din\r\n    Augments to mingling clamour. Sportive hinds,\r\n    Happy! more happy than the lords ye serve!--\r\n    How lustily your sons endure the hour\r\n    Of wintry desolation; and how fair\r\n    Your blooming daughters greet the op’ning dawn\r\n    Of love-inspiring spring!\r\n                            Hail! harvest-home!\r\n    To thee, the muse of nature pours the song,\r\n    By instinct taught to warble!

This was generally contrived to fall into the\r\nhands of one of the finest girls in the field, and was dressed up with\r\nribands, and brought home in triumph with the music of fiddles or\r\nbagpipes. A good dinner was given to the whole band, and the evening\r\nspent in joviality and dancing, while the fortunate lass who took the\r\n_maiden_ was the queen of the feast; after which this handful of corn\r\nwas dressed out generally in the form of a cross, and hung up with the\r\ndate of the year, in some conspicuous part of the house. This custom is\r\nnow entirely done away, and in its room each shearer is given sixpence\r\nand a loaf of bread. However, some farmers, when all their corns are\r\nbrought in, give their servants a dinner and a jovial evening, by way\r\nof harvest-home.”[323]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe festival of the in-gathering in Scotland, is poetically described by\r\nthe elegant author of the “British Georgics.”\r\n\r\nTHE KIRN.\r\n\r\n_Harvest Home._\r\n\r\n      The fields are swept, a tranquil silence reigns,\r\n    And pause of rural labour, far and near.\r\n    Deep is the morning’s hush; from grange to grange\r\n    Responsive cock-crows, in the distance heard,\r\n    Distinct as if at hand, soothe the pleased ear;\r\n    And oft, at intervals, the flail, remote,\r\n    Sends faintly through the air its deafened sound.\r\n\r\n      Bright now the shortening day, and blythe its close,\r\n    When to the _Kirn_ the neighbours, old and young,\r\n    Come dropping in to share the well-earned feast.\r\n    The smith aside his ponderous sledge has thrown,\r\n    Raked up his fire, and cooled the hissing brand\r\n    His sluice the miller shuts; and from the barn\r\n    The threshers hie, to don their Sunday coats.\r\n    Simply adorned, with ribands, blue and pink,\r\n    Bound round their braided hair, the lasses trip\r\n    To grace the feast, which now is smoking ranged\r\n    On tables of all shape, and size, and height,\r\n    Joined awkwardly, yet to the crowded guests\r\n    A seemly joyous show, all loaded well:\r\n    But chief, at the board-head, the haggis round\r\n    Attracts all eyes, and even the goodman’s grace\r\n    Prunes of its wonted length. With eager knife,\r\n    The quivering globe he then prepares to broach;\r\n    While for her gown some ancient matron quakes,\r\n    Her gown of silken woof, all figured thick\r\n    With roses white, far larger than the life,\r\n    On azure ground,--her grannam’s wedding garb,\r\n    Old as that year when Sheriffmuir was fought.\r\n    Old tales are told, and well-known jests abound,\r\n    Which laughter meets half way as ancient friends,\r\n    Nor, like the worldling, spurns because thread bare.\r\n\r\n      When ended the repast, and board and bench\r\n    Vanish like thought, by many hands removed,\r\n    Up strikes the fiddle; quick upon the floor\r\n    The youths lead out the half-reluctant maids,\r\n    Bashful at first, and darning through the reels\r\n    With timid steps, till, by the music cheered,\r\n    With free and airy step, they bound along,\r\n    Then deftly wheel, and to their partner’s face,\r\n    Turning this side, now that, with varying step.\r\n    Sometimes two ancient couples o’er the floor,\r\n    Skim through a reel, and think of youthful years.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile the frothing bickers,[324] soon as filled,\r\n    Are drained, and to the gauntress[325] oft return,\r\n    Where gossips sit, unmindful of the dance.\r\n    Salubrious beverage! Were thy sterling worth\r\n    But duly prized, no more the alembic vast\r\n    Would, like some dire volcano, vomit forth\r\n    Its floods of liquid fire, and far and wide\r\n    Lay waste the land; no more the fruitful boon\r\n    Of twice ten shrievedoms, into poison turned,\r\n    Would taint the very life blood of the poor,\r\n    Shrivelling their heart-strings like a burning scroll.\r\n\r\n  _Grahame._\r\n\r\nIn the island of Minorca, “Their harvests are generally gathered by the\r\nmiddle of June; and, as the corn ripens, a number of boys and girls\r\nstation themselves at the edges of the fields, and on the tops of the\r\nfence-walls, to fright away the small birds with their shouts and cries.\r\nThis puts one in mind of Virgil’s precept in the first book of his\r\n‘Georgics,’\r\n\r\n    ‘Et sonitu terrebis aves,’----\r\n\r\nand was a custom, I doubt not, among the Roman farmers, from whom the\r\nancient Minorquins learned it. They also use for the same purpose, a\r\nsplit reed, which makes a horrid rattling, as they shake it with their\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Northamptonshire, “within the liberty of Warkworth is Ashe Meadow,\r\ndivided amongst the neighbouring parishes, and famed for the following\r\ncustoms observed in the mowing of it. The meadow is divided into fifteen\r\nportions, answering to fifteen lots, which are pieces of wood cut off\r\nfrom an arrow, and marked according to the landmarks in the field. To\r\neach lot are allowed eight mowers, amounting to one hundred and twenty\r\nin the whole. On the Saturday sevennight after midsummer-day, these\r\nportions are laid out by six persons, of whom two are chosen from\r\nWarkworth, two from Overthorp, one from Grimsbury, and one from\r\nNethercote. These are called field-men, and have an entertainment\r\nprovided for them upon the day of laying out the meadow, at the\r\nappointment of the lord of the manor. As soon as the meadow is measured,\r\nthe man who provides the feast, attended by the hay-ward of Warkworth,\r\nbrings into the field three gallons of ale. After this the meadow is\r\nrun, as they term it, or trod, to distinguish the lots; and, when this\r\nis over, the hay-ward brings into the field a rump of beef, six penny\r\nloaves, and three gallons of ale, and is allowed a certain portion of\r\nhay in return, though not of equal value with his provision. This\r\nhay-ward and the master of the feast have the name of crocus-men. In\r\nrunning the field each man hath a boy allowed to assist him. On Monday\r\nmorning lots are drawn, consisting some of eight swaths and others of\r\nfour. Of these the first and last carry the garlands. The two first lots\r\nare of four swaths, and whilst these are mowing, the mowers go double;\r\nand, as soon as these are finished, the following orders are read\r\naloud:--‘Oyez, Oyez, Oyez, I charge you, under God, and in his majesty’s\r\nname, that you keep the king’s peace in the lord of the manor’s behalf,\r\naccording to the orders and customs of this meadow. No man or men shall\r\ngo before the two garlands; if you do, you shall pay your penny, or\r\ndeliver your scythe at the first demand, and this so often as you shall\r\ntransgress. No man, or men, shall mow above eight swaths over their\r\nlots, before they lay down their scythes and go to breakfast. No man, or\r\nmen, shall mow any farther than Monksholm-brook, but leave their scythes\r\nthere, and go to dinner; according to the custom and manner of this\r\nmanor. God save the king!’ The dinner, provided by the lord of the\r\nmanor’s tenant, consists of three cheesecakes, three cakes, and a\r\nnew-milk cheese. The cakes and cheesecakes are of the size of a\r\nwinnowing-sieve; and the person who brings them is to have three gallons\r\nof ale. The master of the feast is paid in hay, and is farther allowed\r\nto turn all his cows into the meadow on Saturday morning till eleven\r\no’clock; that by this means giving the more milk the cakes may be made\r\nthe bigger. Other like customs are observed in the mowing of other\r\nmeadows in this parish.”[326]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarvest time is as delightful to look on to us, who are mere spectators\r\nof it, as it was in the golden age, when the gatherers and the rejoicers\r\nwere one. Now, therefore, as then, the fields are all alive with figures\r\nand groups, that seem, in the eye of the artist, to be made for\r\npictures--pictures that he can see but one fault in; (which fault, by\r\nthe by, constitutes their only beauty in the eye of the farmer;) namely,\r\nthat they will not stand still a moment, for him to paint them. He must\r\ntherefore be content, as we are, to keep them as studies in the\r\nstorehouse of his memory.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of those studies, which he may practise upon till\r\ndoomsday, and will not then be able to produce half the effect from them\r\nthat will arise spontaneously on the imagination, at the mere mention of\r\nthe simplest words which can describe them:--The sunburnt reapers,\r\nentering the field leisurely at early morning, with their reaphooks\r\nresting on their right shoulders, and their beer-kegs swinging to their\r\nleft hands, while they pause for a while to look about them before they\r\nbegin their work.--The same, when they are scattered over the field:\r\nsome stooping to the ground over the prostrate corn, others lifting up\r\nthe heavy sheaves and supporting them against one another, while the\r\nrest are plying their busy sickles, before which the brave crop seems to\r\nretreat reluctantly, like a half-defeated army.--Again, the same\r\ncollected together into one group, and resting to refresh themselves,\r\nwhile the lightening keg passes from one to another silently, and the\r\nrude clasp-knife lifts the coarse meal to the ruddy lips.--Lastly, the\r\npiled-up wain, moving along heavily among the lessening sheaves, and\r\nswaying from side to side as it moves; while a few, whose share of the\r\nwork is already done, lie about here and there in the shade, and watch\r\nthe near completion of it.[327]\r\n\r\nKENTISH HOP PICKING.\r\n\r\n                          Who first may fill\r\n    The bellying bin, and cleanest cull the hops.\r\n    Nor ought retards, unless invited out\r\n    By Sol’s declining, and the evening’s calm,\r\n    Leander leads Lætitia to the scene\r\n    Of shade and fragrance--Then th’ exulting band\r\n    Of pickers, male and female, seize the fair\r\n    Reluctant, and with boisterous force and brute,\r\n    By cries unmov’d, they bury her in the bin.\r\n    Nor does the youth escape--him too they seize,\r\n    And in such posture place as best may serve\r\n    To hide his charmer’s blushes.

A Saxon menology, or register\r\nof the months, (in Wanley’s addition to Hickes,) mentions it under that\r\ndenomination, and gives its derivation in words which are thus literally\r\ntranslated “_haligemonath_--for that our forefathers, the while they\r\nheathens were, on this month celebrated their _devil-gild_.” To inquire\r\nconcerning an exposition which appears so much at variance with this old\r\nname, is less requisite than to take a calm survey of the month itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I at my window sit, and see\r\n      Autumn his russet fingers lay\r\n    On every leaf of every tree;\r\n      I call, but summer will not stay.\r\n\r\n    She flies, the boasting goddess flies,\r\n      And, pointing where espaliers shoot,\r\n    Deserve my parting gift, she cries,\r\n      I take the leaves, but not the fruit.\r\n\r\nStill, at this season--\r\n\r\n    The rainbow comes and goes,\r\n      The moon doth with delight\r\n    Look round her when the heavens are bare;\r\n      Waters on a starry night\r\n      Are beautiful and fair;\r\n    The sunshine is a glorious birth;--\r\n      But yet we know, where’er we go,\r\n    That there hath passed away a glory from the earth.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to mention it,” says the author of the _Mirror of the\r\nMonths_, “but the truth must be told even in a matter of age. The year\r\nthen is on the wane. It is ‘declining into the vale’ of months. It has\r\nreached ‘a certain age.’--It has reached the summit of the hill, and is\r\nnot only looking, but descending, into the valley below. But, unlike\r\nthat into which the life of man declines, _this_ is not a vale of tears;\r\nstill less does it, like that, lead to that inevitable bourne, the\r\nkingdom of the grave. For though it may be called (I hope without the\r\nsemblance of profanation) ‘the valley of the _shadow_ of death,’ yet of\r\ndeath itself it knows nothing. No--the year steps onward towards its\r\ntemporary decay, if not so rejoicingly, even more majestically and\r\ngracefully, than it does towards its revivification. And if September is\r\nnot so bright with promise, and so buoyant with hope, as May, it is even\r\nmore embued with that spirit of serene repose, in which the only true,\r\nbecause the only continuous enjoyment consists. Spring ‘never _is_, but\r\nalways _to be_ blest;’ but September is the month of consummations--the\r\nfulfiller of all promises--the fruition of all hopes--the era of all\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\n“The sunsets of September in this country are perhaps unrivalled, for\r\ntheir infinite variety, and their indescribable beauty. Those of more\r\nsouthern countries may, perhaps, match or even surpass them, for a\r\ncertain glowing and unbroken intensity. But for gorgeous variety of form\r\nand colour, exquisite delicacy of tint and pencilling, and a certain\r\nplacid sweetness and tenderness of general effect, which frequently\r\narises out of a union of the two latter, there is nothing to be seen\r\nlike what we can show in England at this season of the year. If a\r\npainter, who was capable of doing it to the utmost perfection, were to\r\ndare depict on canvas one out of twenty of the sunsets that we\r\nfrequently have during this month, he would be laughed at for his pains.\r\nAnd the reason is, that people judge of pictures by pictures. They\r\ncompare Hobbima with Ruysdael, and Ruysdael with Wynants, and Wynants\r\nwith Wouvermans, and Wouvermans with Potter, and Potter with Cuyp; and\r\nthen they think the affair can proceed no farther. And the chances are,\r\nthat if you were to show one of the sunsets in question to a\r\nthorough-paced connoisseur in this department of fine art, he would\r\nreply, that it was very beautiful, to be sure, but that he must beg to\r\ndoubt whether it was _natural_, for he had never seen one like it in any\r\nof the old masters!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the “Poetical Calendar” there is the following address “to Mr.\r\nHayman,” probably Francis Hayman, the painter of Vauxhall-gardens, who\r\nis known to us all, through early editions of several of our good\r\nauthors, “with copper-plates, designed by Mr. Hayman.”\r\n\r\nAN AUTUMNAL ODE.\r\n\r\n    Yet once more, glorious God of day,\r\n      While beams thine orb serene,\r\n    O let me warbling court thy stay\r\n      To gild the fading scene!\r\n        Thy rays invigorate the spring,\r\n        Bright summer to perfection bring,\r\n    The cold inclemency of winter cheer,\r\n    And make th’ autumnal months the mildest of the year.\r\n\r\n    Ere yet the russet foliage fall\r\n      I’ll climb the mountain’s brow,\r\n    My friend, my Hayman, at thy call,\r\n      To view the scene below:\r\n        How sweetly pleasing to behold\r\n        Forests of vegetable gold!\r\n    How mix’d the many chequer’d shades between\r\n    The tawny, mellowing hue, and the gay vivid green!\r\n\r\n    How splendid all the sky! how still!\r\n      How mild the dying gale!\r\n    How soft the whispers of the rill,\r\n      That winds along the vale!\r\n        So tranquil nature’s works appear,\r\n        It seems the sabbath of the year:\r\n    As if, the summer’s labour past, she chose\r\n    This season’s sober calm for blandishing repose.\r\n\r\n    Such is of well-spent life the time,\r\n      When busy days are past;\r\n    Man, verging gradual from his prime,\r\n      Meets sacred peace at last:\r\n        His flowery spring of pleasures o’er,\r\n        And summer’s full-bloom pride no more,\r\n    He gains pacific autumn, mild and bland,\r\n    And dauntless braves the stroke of winter’s palsied hand.\r\n\r\n    For yet a while, a little while,\r\n      Involv’d in wintry gloom,\r\n    And lo! another spring shall smile,\r\n      A spring eternal bloom:\r\n        Then shall he shine, a glorious guest,\r\n        In the bright mansions of the blest,\r\n    Where due rewards on virtue are bestow’d,\r\n    And reap’d the golden fruits of what his autumn sow’d.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by the gentleman-usher of the year, that “the fruit\r\ngarden is one scene of tempting profusion.\r\n\r\n“Against the wall, the grapes have put on that transparent look which\r\nindicates their complete ripeness, and have dressed their cheeks in that\r\ndelicate bloom which enables them to bear away the bell of beauty from\r\nall their rivals. The peaches and nectarines have become fragrant, and\r\nthe whole wall where they hang is ‘musical with bees.’ Along the\r\nespaliers, the rosy-cheeked apples look out from among their leaves,\r\nlike laughing children peeping at each other through screens of foliage;\r\nand the young standards bend their straggling boughs to the earth with\r\nthe weight of their produce.\r\n\r\n“Let us not forget to add, that there is _one_ part of London which is\r\nnever out of season, and is never more _in_ season than now.\r\nCovent-garden market is still the garden of gardens; and as there is not\r\na month in all the year in which it does not contrive to belie something\r\nor other that has been said in the foregoing pages, as to the particular\r\nseason of certain flowers, fruits, &c., so now it offers the flowers and\r\nthe fruits of every season united. How it becomes possessed of all\r\nthese, I shall not pretend to say: but thus much I am bound to add by\r\nway of information,--that those ladies and gentlemen who have\r\ncountry-houses in the neighbourhood of Clapham-common or\r\nCamberwell-grove, may now have the pleasure of eating the best fruit out\r\nof their own gardens--provided they choose to pay the price of it in\r\nCovent-garden market.”[329]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe observer of nature, where nature can alone be fully enjoyed, will\r\nperceive, that, in this month, “among the birds, we have something like\r\na renewal of the spring melodies. In particular, the thrush and\r\nblackbird, who have been silent for several weeks, recommence their\r\nsongs,--bidding good bye to the summer, in the same subdued tone in\r\nwhich they hailed her approach--wood-owls hoot louder than ever; and the\r\nlambs bleat shrilly from the hill-side to their neglectful dams; and the\r\nthresher’s flail is heard from the unseen barn; and the plough-boy’s\r\nwhistle comes through the silent air from the distant upland; and snakes\r\nleave their last year’s skins in the brakes--literally creeping out at\r\ntheir own mouths; and acorns drop in showers from the oaks, at every\r\nwind that blows; and hazel-nuts ask to be plucked, so invitingly do they\r\nlook forth from their green dwellings; and, lastly, the evenings close\r\nin too quickly upon the walks to which their serene beauty invites us,\r\nand the mornings get chilly, misty, and damp.”\r\n\r\nFinally, “another singular sight belonging to this period, is the\r\noccasional showers of gossamer that fall from the upper regions of the\r\nair, and cover every thing like a veil of woven silver.

I am very much obliged to you, sir;\r\nand I can be furnished at this office with a license to carry arms for\r\nthat purpose?” The answer, of course, was given in the negative, though\r\nnot without a good deal of surprise at such a question, and the inquirer\r\nbowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n      Here the rude clamour of the sportsman’s joy,\r\n    The gun fast-thundering, and the winded horn,\r\n    Would tempt the muse to sing the _rural game_:\r\n    How, in his mid-career, the spaniel struck,\r\n    Stiff, by the tainted gale, with open nose,\r\n    Out-stretched, and finely sensible, _draws_ full,\r\n    Fearful, and cautious, on the latent prey;\r\n    As in the sun the circling covey bask\r\n    Their varied plumes, and watchful every way\r\n    Through the rough stubble turn the secret eye.\r\n    Caught in the meshy snare, in vain they beat\r\n    Their idle wings, entangled more and more:\r\n    Nor on the surges of the boundless air,\r\n    Though borne triumphant, are they safe; the gun,\r\n    Glanc’d just, and sudden, from the fowler’s eye,\r\n    O’ertakes their sounding pinions; and again,\r\n    Immediate brings them from the towering wing,\r\n    Dead to the ground: or drives them wide-dispers’d,\r\n    Wounded, and wheeling various, down the wind.\r\n\r\n      These are not subjects for the peaceful muse,\r\n    Nor will she stain with such her spotless song;\r\n    Then most delighted, when she social sees\r\n    The whole mix’d animal creation round\r\n    Alive, and happy. ’Tis not joy to her,\r\n    This falsely-cheerful barbarous game of death\r\n    This rage of pleasure, which the restless youth\r\n    Awakes impatient, with the gleaming morn;\r\n    When beasts of prey retire, that all night long,\r\n    Urg’d by necessity, had rang’d the dark,\r\n    As if their conscious ravage shunn’d the light,\r\n    Asham’d.

A. curate of Constantine, Cornwall,” whose “passion for\r\nrural sports, and the beauties of nature,” gave birth to “a poem where\r\nnature and sport were to be the only features of the picture,” and\r\nwherein he thus describes.\r\n\r\n      Full of th’ expected sport my heart beats high,\r\n    And with impatient step I haste to reach\r\n    The stubbles, where the scatter’d ears afford\r\n    A sweet repast to the yet heedless game.\r\n    How my brave dogs o’er the broad furrows bound,\r\n    Quart’ring their ground exactly.

He was, like Elwes and Dancer, an old bachelor, and for the same\r\nreason, it was a favourite maxim with him, and ever upon his lips, that\r\n“fine wives and fine gardens are mighty expensive things:” he\r\nconsequently kept at a very respectful distance from both. He had,\r\nindeed, an unconquerable dread of any thing “fine,” or that approached\r\nin any way that awful and ghost-like term “expensive.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Woolley’s avaricious bias, was not, as is generally\r\nthe case, his first ruling passion, though a phrenologist, might\r\nentertain a different opinion. “When young,” says Blackner in his\r\nHistory of Nottinghamshire, “he was partial to shooting; but being\r\ndetected at his sport upon the estate of the depraved William Andrew\r\nHorne, Esq. of Butterly (who was executed on the 11th of December, 1759,\r\nat Nottingham, for the murder of a child) and compelled by him to pay\r\nthe penalty, he made a vow never to cease from labour, except when\r\nnature compelled him, till he had obtained sufficient property to\r\njustify him in following his favourite sport, without dreading the\r\nfrowns of his haughty neighbour. He accordingly fell to work, and\r\ncontinued at it till he was weary, when he rested, and “to it again,”--a\r\nplan which he pursued without any regard to night or day. He denied\r\nhimself the use of an ordinary bed, and of every other comfort, as well\r\nas necessary, except of the meanest kind. But when he had acquired\r\nproperty to qualify him to carry a gun, he had lost all relish for the\r\nsport; and he continued to labour at clock-making, except when he found\r\nan opportunity of trafficking in land, till he had amassed a\r\nconsiderable fortune, which he bequeathed to one of his relations. I\r\nbelieve he died about 1770.”\r\n\r\nIt must have been a singular spectacle to any one except Woolley’s\r\nneighbours, who were the daily observers of his habits, to have seen a\r\nman worth upwards of 20,000_l._ up at five in the morning brushing away\r\nwith his bare feet the dew as he fetched up his cows from the pasture,\r\nhis shoes and stockings carefully held under his arm to prevent them\r\nfrom being injured by the wet; though, by the by, a glance at them would\r\nhave satisfied any one they had but little to fear from the dew or any\r\nthing else. A penny loaf boiled in a small piece of linen, made him an\r\nexcellent pudding; this with a halfpenny worth of small beer from the\r\nvillage alehouse was his more than ordinary dinner, and rarely sported\r\nunless on holydays, or when he had a friend or tenant to share the\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nOnce in his life Woolley was convicted of liberality. He had at great\r\nlabour and expense of time made, what he considered, a clock of\r\nconsiderable value, and, as it was probably too large for common\r\npurposes, he presented it to the corporation of Nottingham, for the\r\nexchange. In return he was made a freeman of the town. They could not\r\nhave conferred on him a greater favour: the honour mattered not--but\r\nelection-dinners were things which powerfully appealed through his\r\nstomach to his heart. The first he attended was productive of a\r\nludicrous incident. His shabby and vagrant appearance nearly excluded\r\nhim from the scene of good-eating, and even when the burgesses sat down\r\nto table, no one seemed disposed to accommodate the miserly old\r\ngentleman with a seat. The chairs were quickly filled: having no time to\r\nlose, he crept under the table and thrusting up his head forced himself\r\nviolently into one, but not before he had received some heavy blows on\r\nthe bare skull.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent incident in his history, was a ploughing scheme of\r\nhis own invention. He had long lamented that he kept horses at a great\r\nexpense for the purposes of husbandry. To have kept a saddle-horse would\r\nhave been extravagant--and at last fancying he could do without them,\r\nthey were sold, and the money carefully laid by. This was a triumph--a\r\nnoble saving! The winter passed away, and his hay and corn-stacks stood\r\nundiminished; ploughing time however arrived, and his new plan must be\r\ncarried into effect. The plough was drawn from its inglorious\r\nresting-place, and a score men were summoned from the village to supply\r\nthe place of horses. At the breakfast-table he was not without fears of\r\na famine--he could starve himself, but a score of brawny villagers,\r\nhungry, and anticipating a hard day’s work, would eat, and drink too,\r\nand must be satisfied. They soon proceeded to the field, where a long\r\ncontinued drought had made the ground almost impenetrable; the day\r\nbecame excessively hot, and the men tugged and puffed to little purpose;\r\nthey again ate heartily, and drank more good ale than the old man had\r\npatience to think of; and difficult as it was, to force the share\r\nthrough the unyielding sward, it was still more difficult to refrain\r\nfrom laughing out at the grotesque figure their group presented. They\r\nmade many wry faces, and more wry furrows, and spoiled with their feet\r\nwhat they had not ploughed amiss. But this was not all. Had a balloon\r\nbeen sent up from the field it could scarcely have drawn together more\r\nintruders; he tried, but in vain, to keep them off; they thronged upon\r\nhim from all quarters; his gates were all set open or thrown off the\r\nhooks; and the fences broken down in every direction. Woolley perceived\r\nhis error; the men, the rope traces, and the plough were sent home in a\r\nhurry, and with some blustering, and many oaths, the trespassers were\r\ngot rid of. The fences were mended, and the gates replaced, and having\r\nto his heart’s content gratified his whim, he returned to the\r\nold-fashioned custom of ploughing with horses, until in his brains’\r\nfertility he could discover something better and less “expensive!”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 60·40.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 2.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON BURNT, 1666.\r\n\r\nThis notice in our almanacs was descriptively illustrated in vol. i.\r\ncol. 1150-1165.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW FAIR, 1826.\r\n\r\nAnother year arrives, and spite of corporation “resolutions,” and\r\nreferences to “the committee,” and “reports,” and “recommendations,” to\r\nabolish the fair, it is held again. “Now,” says an agreeable observer,\r\n“Now arrives that Saturnalia of nondescript noise and nonconformity,\r\n‘Bartlemy fair;’--when that prince of peace-officers, the lord mayor,\r\nchanges his sword of state into a sixpenny trumpet, and becomes the lord\r\nof misrule and the patron of pickpockets; and lady Holland’s name leads\r\nan unlettered mob instead of a lettered one; when Mr. Richardson\r\nmaintains, during three whole days and a half, a managerial supremacy\r\nthat must be not a little enviable even in the eyes of Mr. Elliston\r\nhimself; and Mr. Gyngell holds, during the same period, a scarcely less\r\ndistinguished station as the Apollo of servant-maids; when ‘the\r\nincomparable (not to say _eternal_) _young_ Master Saunders’ rides on\r\nhorseback to the admiration of all beholders, in the person of his\r\neldest son; and when all the giants in the land, and the dwarfs too,\r\nmake a general muster, and each proves to be, according to the most\r\ncorrect measurement, at least a foot taller or shorter than any other in\r\nthe fair, and in fact, the only one worth seeing,--‘all the rest being\r\nimpostors!’ In short, when every booth in the fair combines in itself\r\nthe attractions of all the rest, and so perplexes with its irresistible\r\nmerit the rapt imagination of the half-holyday schoolboys who have got\r\nbut sixpence to spend upon the whole, that they eye the outsides of each\r\nin a state of pleasing despair, till their leave of absence is expired\r\ntwice over, and then return home filled with visions of giants and\r\ngingerbread-nuts, and dream all night long of what they have not\r\nseen.”[331]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe almanac day for Bartholomew fair, is on the third of the month,\r\nwhich this year fell on a Sunday, and it being prescribed that the fair\r\nshall be proclaimed “on or before the third,” proclamation was\r\naccordingly made, and the fair commenced on Saturday the second of\r\nSeptember, 1826. Its appearance on that and subsequent days, proves that\r\nit is going out like the lottery, by force of public opinion; for the\r\npeople no longer buy lottery tickets even in “the _last_ lottery,” nor\r\npay as they used to do at “Bartlemy fair.” There were this year only\r\nthree shows at sixpence, and one at twopence; all the rest were “only a\r\npenny.”\r\n\r\nThe _sixpenny_ shows were, Clarke, with riders and tumblers; Richardson,\r\nwith his tragi-comical company, enacting “Paul Pry;” and wicked\r\nWombwell, with his fellow brutes.\r\n\r\nIn the _twopenny_ show were four lively little crocodiles about twelve\r\ninches long, hatched from the eggs at Peckham, by steam; two larger\r\ncrocodiles; four cages of fierce rattle snakes; and a dwarf lady.\r\n\r\nIn the _penny_ shows were a glass-blower, sitting at work in a glass\r\nwig, with rows of curls all over, making pretty little teacups at\r\nthreepence each, and miniature tobacco pipes for a penny; he was\r\nassisted by a wretched looking female, who was a sword-swallower at the\r\nlast figure, and figured in this by placing her feet on hot iron, and\r\nlicking a poker nearly red hot with her tongue. In “Brown’s grand\r\ncompany from Paris,” there were juggling, tight-rope dancing, a learned\r\nhorse, and playing on the salt-box with a rolling-pin, to a tune which\r\nis said to be peculiar to the pastime. The other penny shows were nearly\r\nas last year, and silver-haired ladies and dwarfs, more plentiful and\r\nless in demand than learned pigs, who, on that account, drew “good\r\nhouses.”\r\n\r\nIn this year’s fair there was not one “up-and-down,” or “round-about.”\r\n\r\nThe west side of Giltspur-street was an attractive mart to certain “men\r\nof letters;” for the ground was covered with “relics of literature.” In\r\nthe language of my informant, for I did not visit the fair myself, there\r\nwas a “path of genius” from St. Sepulchre’s church to Cock-lane. He\r\nmentions that a person, apparently an agent of a religious society, was\r\nanxiously busy in the fair distributing a bill entitled--“Are you\r\nprepared to die?”\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN REMAINS AT PENTONVILLE,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE CONDUIT.\r\n\r\nI am not learned in the history or the science of phrenology, but,\r\nunless I am mistaken, surely in the days of “craniology,” the organ of\r\n“inhabitiveness” was called the organ of “travelling.” Within the last\r\nminute I have felt my head in search of the development. I imagine it\r\nmust be very palpable to the scientific, for I not only incline to\r\nwander but to locate. However that may be, I cannot find it myself--for\r\nwant, I suppose, of a topographical view of the cranium, and I have not\r\na copy of Mr. Cruikshank’s “Illustrations of Phrenology” to refer to.\r\n\r\nAt home, I always sit in the same place if I can make my way to it\r\nwithout disturbing the children; all of whom, by the by, (I speak of the\r\nyounger ones,) are great sticklers for rights of sitting, and urge their\r\nclaims on each other with a persistence which takes all my authority to\r\nabate. I have a habit, too, at a friend’s house of always preferring the\r\nseat I dropped into on my first visit; and the same elsewhere. The first\r\ntime I went to the Chapter Coffee-house, some five-and-twenty years ago,\r\nI accidentally found myself alone with old Dr. Buchan, in the same box;\r\nit was by the fireplace on the left from Paternoster-row door: poor\r\nRobert Heron presently afterwards entered, and then a troop of the\r\ndoctor’s familiars dropped in, one by one; and I sat in the corner, a\r\nstranger to all of them, and therefore a silent auditor of their\r\npleasant disputations. At my next appearance I forbore from occupying\r\nthe same seat, because it would have been an obtrusion on the literary\r\ncommunity; but I got into the adjoining box, and that always, for the\r\nperiod of my then frequenting the house, was my coveted box. After an\r\nabsence of twenty years, I returned to the “Chapter,” and involuntarily\r\nstepped to the old spot; it was pre-occupied; and in the doctor’s box\r\nwere other faces, and talkers of other things. I strode away to a\r\ndistant part of the room to an inviting vacancy, which, from that\r\naccident, and my propensity, became my desirable sitting place at every\r\nfuture visit. My strolls abroad are of the same character. I prefer\r\nwalking where I walked when novelty was charming; where I can have the\r\npleasure of recollecting that I formerly felt pleasure--of rising to the\r\nenjoyment of a spirit hovering over the remains it had animated.\r\n\r\nOne of my oldest, and therefore one of my still-admired walks is by the\r\nway of Islington. I am partial to it, because, when I was eleven years\r\nold, I went every evening from my father’s, near Red Lion-square, to a\r\nlodging in that village “for a consumption,” and returned the following\r\nmorning. I thus became acquainted with Canonbury, and the Pied Bull, and\r\nBarnesbury-park, and White Conduit-house; and the intimacy has been kept\r\nup until presumptuous takings in, and enclosures, and new buildings,\r\nhave nearly destroyed it. The old site seems like an old friend who has\r\nformed fashionable acquaintanceships, and lost his old heartwarming\r\nsmiles in the constraint of a new face.\r\n\r\nIn my last Islington walk, I took a survey of the only remains of the\r\nRoman encampment, near Barnesbury-park. This is a quadrangle of about\r\none hundred and thirty feet, surrounded by a fosse or ditch, about\r\nfive-and-twenty feet wide, and twelve feet deep. It is close to the west\r\nside of the present end of the New Road, in a line with Penton-street;\r\nimmediately opposite to it, on the east side of the road, is built a row\r\nof houses, at present uninhabited, called Minerva-place. This quadrangle\r\nis supposed to have been the prætorium or head quarters of Suetonius,\r\nwhen he engaged the British queen, Boadicea, about the year 60. The\r\nconflict was in the eastward valley below, at the back of Pentonville.\r\nHere Boadicea, with her two daughters before her in the same\r\nwar-chariot, traversed the plain, haranguing her troops; telling them,\r\nas Tacitus records, “that it was usual to the Britons to war under the\r\nconduct of women,” and inciting them to “vengeance for the oppression of\r\npublic liberty, for the stripes inflicted on her person, for the\r\ndefilement of her virgin daughters;” declaring “that in that battle they\r\nmust remain utterly victorious or utterly perish: such was the firm\r\npurpose of her who was a woman; the men, if they pleased, might still\r\nenjoy life and bondage.” The slaughter was terrible, eighty thousand of\r\nthe Britons were left dead on the field; it terminated victoriously for\r\nthe Romans, near Gray’s-inn-lane, at the place called “Battle Bridge,”\r\nin commemoration of the event.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Pretorium of the Roman Camp near Pentonville.~]\r\n\r\nThe pencil of the artist has been employed to give a correct and\r\npicturesque representation as it now appears, in September, 1826, of the\r\nlast vestige of the Roman power in this suburb. The view is taken from\r\nthe north-east angle of the prætorium. Until within a few years the\r\nground about it was unbroken; and, even now, the quadrangle itself is\r\nsurprisingly complete, considering that nearly eighteen centuries have\r\nelapsed since it was formed by the Roman soldiery. In a short time the\r\nspirit of improvement will entirely efface it, and houses and gardens\r\noccupy its site. In the fosse of this station, which is overrun with\r\nsedge and brake, there is so pretty a “bit,” to use an artist’s word,\r\nthat I have caused it to be sketched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Old Well in the Fosse.~]\r\n\r\nThis may be more pleasantly regarded when the ancient works themselves\r\nhave vanished. Within a few yards of the western side of the fosse, and\r\nparallel with it, there is raised a mound or rampart of earth. It is in\r\nits original state and covered with verdure. In fine mornings a stray\r\nvalitudinarian or two may be seen pacing its summit. Its western slope\r\nhas long been the Sunday resort of Irishmen for the game of foot-ball.\r\n\r\nGetting back into the New Road, its street which stands on fields I\r\nrambled in when a boy, leads to “White Conduit-house,” which derives its\r\nname from a building still preserved, I was going to say, but I prefer\r\nto say, still standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The White Conduit.~]\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Fussell who resides within sight of this little edifice, and\r\nwhose pencil took the Roman general’s station, and the well, also drew\r\nthis Conduit; and his neighbour, Mr. Henry White, engraved the three, as\r\nthey now present themselves to the reader’s eye.\r\n\r\nThe view of the “White Conduit” is from the north, or back part, looking\r\ntowards Pentonville, with Pancras new church and other buildings in the\r\ndistance. It was erected over a head of water that formerly supplied the\r\nCharter-house, and bore a stone in front inscribed “T. S.” the initials\r\nof Sutton, the founder, with his arms, and the date “1641.”[332]\r\n\r\nAbout 1810, the late celebrated Wm. Huntington, S.S., of Providence\r\nchapel, who lived in a handsome house within sight, was at the expense\r\nof clearing the spring for the use of the inhabitants; but, because his\r\npulpit opinions were obnoxious, some of the neighbouring vulgar threw\r\nloads of soil upon it in the night, which rendered the water impure, and\r\nobstructed its channel, and finally ceasing to flow, the public was\r\ndeprived of the kindness he proposed. The building itself was in a very\r\nperfect state at that time, and ought to have been boarded up after the\r\nfield it stood in was thrown open. As the new buildings proceeded it was\r\ninjured and defaced by idle labourers and boys, from mere wantonness and\r\nreduced to a mere ruin. There was a kind of upper floor or hayloft in\r\nit, which was frequently a shelter to the houseless wanderer. A few\r\nyears ago some poor creatures made it a comfortable hostel for the\r\nnight, with a little hay. Early in the morning a passing workman\r\nperceived smoke issuing from the crevices, and as he approached heard\r\nloud cries from within. Some mischievous miscreants had set fire to the\r\nfodder beneath the sleepers, and afterwards fastened the door on the\r\noutside: the inmates were scorched by the fire, and probably they would\r\nall have been suffocated in a few minutes, if the place had not been\r\nbroken open.\r\n\r\nThe “White Conduit” at this time merely stands to shame those who had\r\nthe power, and neglected to preserve it. To the buildings grown up\r\naround, it might have been rendered a neat ornament, by planting a few\r\ntrees and enclosing the whole with an iron railing, and have stood as a\r\nmonument of departed worth. This vicinity was anciently full of springs\r\nand stone conduits; the erections have long since gone to decay, and\r\nfrom their many waters, only one has been preserved, which is\r\nnotoriously deficient as a supply to the populous neighbourhood. During\r\nthe heats of summer the inhabitants want this common element in the\r\nmidst of plenty. The spring in a neighbouring street is frequently\r\nexhausted by three or four o’clock in the afternoon, the handle of the\r\npump is then padlocked till the next morning, and the grateful and\r\nnecessary refreshment of spring-water is not to be obtained without\r\ngoing miles in search of another pump. It would seem as if the parochial\r\npowers in this quarter were leagued with publicans and sinners, to\r\ncompel the thirsty to buy deleterious beer and bowel-disturbing “pop,”\r\nor to swallow the New River water fresh with impurities from the\r\nthousands of people who daily cleanse their foul bodies in the stream,\r\nas it lags along for the use of our kitchens and tea-tables.\r\n\r\n“White Conduit-house,” has ceased to be a recreation in the good sense\r\nof the word. Its present denomination is the “Minor Vauxhall,” and its\r\nchief attraction during the passing summer has been Mrs. Bland. She has\r\nstill powers, and if their exercise here has been a stay and support to\r\nthis sweet melodist, so far the establishment may be deemed respectable.\r\nIt is a ground for balloon-flying and skittle-playing, and just\r\nmaintains itself above the very lowest, so as to be one of the most\r\ndoubtful places of public resort. Recollections of it some years ago are\r\nmore in its favour. Its tea-gardens then in summer afternoons, were well\r\naccustomed by tradesmen and their families; they are now comparatively\r\ndeserted, and instead, there is, at night, a starveling show of odd\r\ncompany and coloured lamps, a mock orchestra with mock singing, dancing\r\nin a room which decent persons would prefer to withdraw their young\r\nfolks from if they entered, and fire-works “as usual,” which, to say the\r\ntruth, are usually very good.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of a vicinage which, “in my time,” was the\r\npleasantest near spot to the north of London. The meadow of the “White\r\nConduit” commanded an extensive prospect of the Hampstead and Highgate\r\nhills, over beautiful pastures and hedge-rows which are now built on, or\r\nconverted into brick clamps, for the _material_ of irruption on the\r\nremaining glades. The pleasant views are wholly obstructed. In a few\r\nshort years, London will distend its enormous bulk to the heights that\r\noverlook its proud city; and, like the locusts of old, devour every\r\ngreen field, and nothing will be left to me to admire, of all that I\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELEGY\r\n\r\n_Written in Bartlemy Fair, at Five o’clock in the morning, in 1810._\r\n\r\n    The clock-bell tolls the hour of early day,\r\n      The lowing herd their Smithfield penance drie,\r\n    The watchman homeward plods his weary way\r\n      And leaves the fair--all solitude to me!\r\n\r\n    Now the first beams of morning glad the sight,\r\n      And all the air a solemn stillness holds;\r\n    Save when the sheep-dog bays with hoarse affright,\r\n      And brutal drovers pen the unwilling folds.\r\n\r\n    Save that where sheltered, or from wind or shower,\r\n      The lock’d-out ’prentice, or frail nymph complain,\r\n    Of such as, wandering near their secret bower,\r\n      Molest them, sensible in sleep, to pain.\r\n\r\n    Beneath those ragged tents--that boarded shade,\r\n      Which late display’d its stores in tempting heaps;\r\n    There, children, dogs, cakes, oysters, all are laid,\r\n      There, guardian of the whole, the master sleeps.\r\n\r\n    The busy call of care-begetting morn,\r\n      The well-slept passenger’s unheeding tread;\r\n    The showman’s clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\n      Too soon must rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps in this neglected booth is laid\r\n      Some head volcanic, oft discharging fire!\r\n    Hands--that the rod of _magic_ lately sway’d;\r\n      Toes--that so nimbly danc’d upon the wire.\r\n\r\n    Some clown, or pantaloon--the gazers’ jest,\r\n      Here, with his train in dirty pageant stood:\r\n    Some tired-out posture-master here may rest,\r\n      Some conjuring swordsman--guiltless of his blood!\r\n\r\n    The applause of listening cockneys to command,\r\n      The threats of city-marshal to despise;\r\n    To give delight to all the grinning band,\r\n      And read their merit in spectators’ eyes,\r\n\r\n    Is still their boast;--nor, haply, theirs alone,\r\n      Polito’s lions (though now _dormant_ laid)\r\n    And human monsters, shall acquire renown,\r\n      The spotted Negro--and the armless maid!\r\n\r\n    Peace to the youth, who, slumbering at the _Bear_,\r\n      Forgets his present lot, his perils past:\r\n    Soon will the crowd again be thronging there,\r\n      To view the man on wild Sombrero cast.\r\n\r\n    Careful their booths, from insult to protect,\r\n      These furl their tapestry, late erected high;\r\n    Nor longer with prodigious pictures deck’d,\r\n      They tempt the passing youth’s astonish’d eye.\r\n\r\n    But when the day calls forth the belles and beaux,\r\n      The cunning showmen each device display,\r\n    And many a clown the useful notice shows,\r\n     To teach ascending strangers--_where to pay_.\r\n\r\n    Sleep on, ye imps of merriment--sleep on!\r\n      In this short respite to your labouring train;\r\n    And when this time of annual mirth is gone,\r\n      May ye enjoy, in peace, your hard-earned gain![333]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 60·40.\r\n\r\n  [331] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n  [332] Nelson’s History of Islington.\r\n\r\n  [333] The Morning Chronicle, 1810.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 3.~\r\n\r\n\r\nPURTON FAIR, WILTS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  _August 18, 1826._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Perhaps you, or some of your readers, may be acquainted with\r\na small village in the north of Wiltshire, called _Purton_, very\r\npleasantly situated, and dear to me, from a child; it being the place\r\nwhere I passed nearly all my boyish days. I went to school there, and\r\nthere spent many a pleasant hour which I now think of with sincere\r\ndelight; and perhaps you will not object to a few particulars concerning\r\na fair held there on the first day of May and the third day of September\r\nin every year.\r\n\r\nThe spot whereon Purton fair is annually celebrated, is a very pleasant\r\nlittle green called the “close,” or play-ground, belonging to all the\r\nunmarried men in the village. They generally assemble there every\r\nevening after the toils of the day to recreate themselves with a few\r\npleasant sports. Their favourite game is what they call _backswording_,\r\nin some places called _singlestick_. Some few of the village have the\r\ngood fortune to be adepts in that _noble art_, and are held up as beings\r\nof transcendent genius among the rustic admirers of that noted science.\r\nThey have one whom they call their umpire, to whom all disputes are\r\nreferred, and he always, with the greatest possible impartiality,\r\ndecides them.\r\n\r\nAbout six years ago a neighbouring farmer, whose orchard joins the\r\ngreen, thought that his orchard might be greatly improved. He\r\naccordingly set to work, pulled down the original wall, and built a new\r\none, not forgetting to take in several feet of the green. The villagers\r\nfelt great indignity at the encroachment, and resolved to claim their\r\nrights. They waited till the new wall should be complete, and in the\r\nevening of the same day a party of about forty marched to the spot armed\r\nwith great sticks, pickaxes, &c., and very deliberately commenced\r\nbreaking down the wall. The owner on being apprised of what was passing,\r\nassembled all his domestics and proceeded to the spot, when a furious\r\nscuffle ensued, and several serious accidents happened. At last,\r\nhowever, the aggressor finding he could not succeed, proposed a\r\nsettlement; he entirely removed the new wall on the following day, and\r\nreturned it to the place where the old one stood.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fair, as soon as the day begins to dawn, all is\r\nbustle and confusion throughout the village. Gipsies are first seen with\r\ntheir donkies approaching the place of rendezvous; then the village\r\nrustics in their clean white Sunday smocks, and the lasses with their\r\nSunday gowns, caps, and ribands, hasten to the green, and all is mirth\r\nand gaiety.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass over a very curious character who used regularly to visit\r\nthe fair, and I was told by an ancient inhabitant that he had done so\r\nfor several years. He was an old gipsy who had attained to high favour\r\nwith all the younkers of the place, from his jocular habits, curious\r\ndress, and the pleasant stories he used to relate. He called himself\r\n“Corey Dyne,” or “Old Corey,” and those are the only names by which he\r\nwas known. He was accustomed to place a little hat on the ground, from\r\nthe centre of which rose a stick about three feet high, whereon he put\r\neither halfpence or a small painted box, or something equally winning to\r\nthe eye of his little customers. There he stood crying, “Now who throws\r\nwith poor old Corey--come to Corey--come to Corey Dyne; only a halfpenny\r\na throw, and only once a year!” A boy who had purchased the right to\r\nthrow was placed about three feet from the hat, with a small piece of\r\nwood which he threw at the article on the stick, and if it fell in the\r\nhat, (which by the by it was almost invariably sure to do,) the thrower\r\nlost his money; but if out of the hat, on the ground, the article from\r\nthe stick was claimed by the thrower. The good humour of “Old Corey”\r\ngenerally ensured him plenty of custom. I have oftentimes been a loser\r\nwith him, but never a winner. I believe that no one in all Purton knows\r\nfrom whence he is, although every body is acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nThere was a large show on the place, at which the rustics were wont to\r\ngaze with surprise and admiration. The chief object of their wonder was\r\nour “punch.” They could not form the slightest idea how little wooden\r\nfigures could talk and dance about; they supposed that there must be\r\nsome life in them. I well remember that I once undertook to set them\r\nright, but was laughed at and derided me for my presumption and boast of\r\n_superior knowledge_.\r\n\r\nThere was also another very merry fellow who frequented the fair by the\r\nname of “Mr. Merryman.” He obtained great celebrity by giving various\r\nimitations of birds, &c., which he would very readily do after\r\ncollecting a sufficient sum “to clear his pipe,” as he used to say. He\r\nthen began with the nightingale, which he imitated very successfully,\r\nthen followed the blackbird--linnet--goldfinch--robin--geese and ducks\r\non a rainy morning--turkies, &c. &c. Then, perhaps, after collecting\r\nsome more money “to clear his pipe,” he would imitate a jackass, or a\r\ncow. His excellent imitation of the crow of a cock strongly affected the\r\nrisible muscles of his auditors.\r\n\r\nThe amusements last till near midnight, when the rustics, being\r\nexhilarated with the effects of good strong Wiltshire ale, generally\r\npart after a few glorious battles.\r\n\r\nThe next day several champions enter the field to contest the right to\r\nseveral prizes, which are laid out in the following order:--\r\n\r\n1st. A new smock.\r\n\r\n2nd. A new hat with a blue cockade.\r\n\r\n3rd. An inferior hat with a white cockade.\r\n\r\n4th. A still inferior hat without a cockade.\r\n\r\nA stage is erected on the green, and at five o’clock the sport\r\ncommences; and a very celebrated personage, whom they call their\r\n_umpshire_, (umpire,) stands high above the rest to award the prizes.\r\nThe candidates are generally selected from the best players at\r\nsinglestick, and on this occasion they use their utmost skill and\r\ningenuity, and are highly applauded by the surrounding spectators. I\r\nmust not forget to remark that on this grand, and to them, interesting\r\nday, the inhabitants of Purton do not combat against each other.\r\nNo--believe me, sir, they are better acquainted with the laws of\r\nchivalry. Purton produces four candidates, and a small village\r\nadjoining, called Stretton, sends forth four more. These candidates are\r\nrepresentatives of the villages to which they respectively belong, and\r\nthey who lose have to pay all the expenses of the day; but it is to the\r\ncredit of the sons of Purton I record, that for seven successive years\r\ntheir candidates have been returned the victors. The contest generally\r\nlasts two hours, and, after that, the ceremony of chairing the\r\nrepresentatives takes place, which is thus performed:--Four chairs made\r\nwith the boughs of trees are in waiting, and the conquerors are placed\r\ntherein and carried through the village with every possible\r\ndemonstration of joy, the inhabitants shouting “Purton for ever! huzza!\r\nmy boys, huzza!” and waving boughs over their triumphant candidates.\r\nAfter the chairing they adjourn to the village public-house, and spend\r\nthe remainder of the evening as before.\r\n\r\nThe third day is likewise a day of bustle and confusion. All repair to a\r\nsmall common, called the cricket ground, and a grand match takes place\r\nbetween the Purton club and the Stretton club; there are about twenty\r\ncandidates of a side. The vanquished parties pay a shilling each to\r\ndefray the expense of a cold collation, which is previously provided in\r\na pleasant little copse adjoining the cricket-ground, and the remainder\r\nof the day is spent convivially.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing the landlord of the public-house at Purton, (which is\r\nsituated on one side of the green,) observe to a villager, that during\r\nthe three days’ merriment he had sold six thousand gallons of strong\r\nbeer and ale; the man of course doubted him, and afterwards very\r\nsarcastically remarked to me, “It’s just as asy, measter, for he to zay\r\nzix thousand gallons as dree thousand!” Does not this, good Mr. Editor,\r\nshow a little genuine Purton wit?\r\n\r\nI have now, my dear sir, finished, and have endeavoured to describe\r\nthree pleasant days spent in an innocent and happy manner; and if I have\r\nsucceeded in affording you any service, or your readers any amusement, I\r\nam amply rewarded. Allow me to add I feel such an affection for old\r\nPurton, that should I at any time in my life visit Wiltshire, I would\r\ntravel twenty miles out of my road to ramble once more in the haunts of\r\nmy boyhood.\r\n\r\n  Believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n  _August, 18, 1826._\r\n\r\n  C. T.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP.S. Since writing the above I have received a letter from a very\r\nparticular friend who went to Purton school five years, to whom I\r\napplied for a few extra particulars respecting the fair, &c., and he\r\nthus writes, “Dear C. You seem to think that with the name I still\r\nretain all the characteristics and predilections of a _hodge_; and\r\ntherefore you seek to me for information respecting the\r\nbacksword-playing, fair, &c. Know that as to the first, it is (and has\r\nbeen for the last two years) entirely done away with, as the principal\r\n‘farmers’ in the place ‘_done_’ like it, and so don’t suffer it. As to\r\nthe fair, where lads and lasses meet in their best gowns, and ribands,\r\nand clean smocks, you must know, most assuredly, more of it than I do,\r\nas I seldom troubled about it. You must bear in mind that this fair is\r\nexactly the same as that held in the month of May, but as no notice has\r\nbeen taken of it by Mr. Hone in either of his volumes, I suppose it very\r\nlittle matters whether your description is of the fair held in May or\r\nSeptember.”\r\n\r\nI have to lament, my dear sir, the discontinuance of the ancient custom\r\nof backswording at Purton village; but so long as they keep up their\r\nfairs, the other loss will not be so much felt.\r\n\r\n  C.

It was\r\nwritten by, and is in the possession of, Mr. John Parker of Wingerworth,\r\nnear Chesterfield, Derbyshire: the writing bears date September 10,\r\n1823. This piece of writing, I find, upon calculation, to be\r\nconsiderably smaller than either of the before-mentioned pieces. My\r\ncalculation is as follows:--\r\n\r\nA moderate sized egg will hold a book one inch and three quarters by one\r\ninch and three-eighths. Bibles have from about sixty to eighty lines in\r\na column; I have not seen more. In this ingenious display of fine\r\npenmanship, there are eighty lines in one inch, and two half-eighths of\r\nan inch, which in one inch and three quarters, (the length of the\r\nbible,) is one hundred and six lines, which would contain one-third more\r\nmatter than the bibles with eighty lines in a column; and one line of\r\nthis writing, one inch and two-half eighths of an inch in length, (which\r\nis the sixteenth of an inch less in bread than the small bible,) is\r\nequal to two lines from one column of the great bible--for example.\r\n\r\nIsaiah. Chap. XXIV.--Two lines of verse 20, the bible having\r\nseventy-nine lines in a column:--\r\n\r\n  “and the transgression thereof shall be heavy\r\n  upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.”\r\n\r\nEzekiel, Chap. XXX.--Two lines of verse 12, the bible having sixty-three\r\nlines in a column:--\r\n\r\n  “and I will make the Land waste, and all that\r\n  is therein, by the hand of strangers.”\r\n\r\nOne line of Mr. Parker’s writing being part of the seventh collect after\r\nTrinity:--\r\n\r\n  “good things; graft in our hearts the love of thy\r\n  name, increase in us true religion, now”--\r\n\r\nAnother line being part of the ninth and tenth commandments:--\r\n\r\n  “false witness against thy neighbour. 10.--Thou\r\n  shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house.”--\r\n\r\nMr. Parker very obligingly submits his writing to the inspection of the\r\ncurious, and would execute one similar for a proper reward. If this\r\naccount should be thought worthy of a place in your “_Every-Day Book_,”\r\nI shall feel much obliged by its insertion, and will endeavour to send\r\nyou something amusing respecting the customs, pastimes, and amusements\r\nof this part of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your well-wisher\r\n\r\n  And obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  JOHN FRANCIS BROWNE.\r\n\r\n  _Lings, near Chesterfield,_\r\n\r\n  _August, 30, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·17.\r\n\r\n  [335] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 7.~\r\n\r\n\r\nENURCHUS.\r\n\r\nFor this saint, in the church of England calendar, see vol. i. col.\r\n1253.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September, 1772, a most astonishing rain fell at Inverary,\r\nin Scotland, by which the rivers rose to such a height, as to carry\r\nevery thing along with the current that stood in the way. Even trees\r\nthat had braved the floods for more than one hundred years, were torn up\r\nby the roots and carried down the stream. Numbers of bridges were swept\r\naway, and the military roads rendered impassable. All the duke of\r\nArgyle’s cascades, bridges, and bulwarks, were destroyed at his fine\r\npalace, in that neighbourhood.[336]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Baron Brown, the Durham Poet.~]\r\n\r\n    A Latin line beneath his name\r\n    May lift along the laureate’s fame,\r\n    As on a crutch, and make it go\r\n    For half an age, for all to know\r\n    That there was one, in our time,\r\n    Who thought mere folly not a crime;\r\n    And, though he scorn’d to be a scorner\r\n    And offer Brown to Poets Corner,\r\n    Imagined it a fit proceeding\r\n    To give his life--let who will sneer at\r\n    It--“PALMAM QUI MERUIT FERAT.”\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN SYKES, bookseller, Johnson’s-head, Newcastle, in the “Local\r\nRecords, or Historical Register of Remarkable Events,” which, in 1824,\r\nhe compiled into a very interesting octavo volume, inserts the death,\r\nwith some account of the “life, character, and behaviour,” of the\r\nself-celebrated poet-laureate of Durham, whose portrait adorns this\r\npage. He has not been registered here under the day of his decease\r\naccording to Mr. Syke’s obit, but it is not fitting as regards this\r\nwork, that Brown should die for ever, and therefore, from a gentleman\r\nwho knew him, the reader will please to accept the following\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIR OF JAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThis curious personage was well known for a long series of years to the\r\ninhabitants of Northumberland and Durham, and we believe few men have\r\nfigured on the stage of the world more remarkable for their\r\npeculiarities and eccentricities.\r\n\r\nOf the early part of James Brown’s life little is known that can be\r\ndepended upon, but the compiler of the present article has heard him\r\nassert that he was born at Berwick-on-Tweed; if this be the case it is\r\nprobable he left that town at a very early age, as in his speech none of\r\nthe provincialisms of the lower order of inhabitants of Berwick could be\r\nobserved, and had he resided there for any length of time, he must have\r\nimperceptibly imbibed the vulgar dialect. Certain, however, it is, that\r\nwhen a young man he resided in that “_fashionable_” part of\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne called “the Side,” where he kept a rag-shop, and was\r\nin the habit of attending the fairs in the neighbourhood with clothes\r\nready-made for sale. During his residence in Newcastle his first wife\r\ndied; of this person he always spoke in terms of affection, and was\r\nknown long after her death, to shed tears on her being alluded to. In\r\nall probability it was owing to his loss of her that his mind became\r\ndisturbed, and from an industrious tradesman he became a fanatic. A few\r\nyears after her decease he married a Miss Richardson, of Durham, a\r\nrespectable though a very eccentric character, and who survived him a\r\nyear. This lady being possessed of a theatre, and some other little\r\nproperty in Durham, he removed to that city to reside.\r\n\r\nWhen Brown first devoted himself to the muses is uncertain, but about\r\nthirty-three years ago, he lived in Newcastle, styled himself the\r\npoet-laureate of that place, and published a poem explanatory of a\r\nchapter in the Apocalypse, which was “adorned” with a hideous engraving\r\nof a beast with ten horns. Of this plate he always spoke in terms of\r\nrapture. We have heard that it was designed by the bard; but as Mr. B.,\r\nthough a poet, never laid any claim to the character of an artist, it is\r\nour belief that he had no hand in its manufacture, but that it was the\r\nwork of some of those waggish friends who deceived him by their tricks,\r\nand rendered his life a pleasure. Their ingenious fictions prevented his\r\ndwelling on scenes by which his existence might have been embittered,\r\nand it is but justice to his numerous hoaxers to assert, that without\r\ntheir pecuniary assistance he would have often been in want of common\r\nnecessaries. Though credulous he was honest; though poor he was\r\npossessed of many virtues; and while they laughed at the fancies of the\r\nvisionary, they respected the man. Brown once indulged a gentleman in\r\nDurham with a sight of the drawing above alluded to, and on a loud laugh\r\nat what the poet esteemed the very perfection of terrific sublimity,\r\nBrown told him “he was no christian, or he would not deride a scriptural\r\ndrawing _which the angel Gabriel had approved_!”\r\n\r\nBrown’s poesy was chiefly of a serious nature, (at least it was intended\r\nto be so,) levity and satire were not his _forte_. Like Dante, his\r\nimagination was gloomy--he delighted to describe the torments of\r\nhell--the rattling of the chains, and the screams of the damned; the\r\nmount of Sisyphus was his Parnassus, the Styx was his Helicon, and the\r\npale forms that flit by Lethe’s billows, the muses that inspired his\r\nlay. His poems consisted chiefly of visions, prophecies, and rhapsodies,\r\nsuggested by some part of the sacred volume of the contents of which he\r\nhad an astonishing recollection. When he was at the advanced age of\r\nninety-two it was almost impossible to quote any passage of scripture to\r\nhim without his remembering the book, chapter, and frequently the verse\r\nfrom whence it was taken. Of his poetry (though in his favourite city he\r\nhas left many imitators) we cannot say any thing in praise; it had\r\n“neither rhyme nor reason,” it was such as a madman would inscribe on\r\nthe walls of his cell. His song, like that of the witches in Thalaba,\r\nwas “an unintelligible song” to all but the writer, on whose mind in\r\nreading it, to use the words of one of the sweetest of our modern poets,\r\n“meaning flashed like strong inspiration.” The only two lines in his\r\nworks that have any thing like meaning in them are--\r\n\r\n    “When men let Satan rule their heart\r\n    They do act the devil’s part.”\r\n\r\nOur author’s last, and as he esteemed it, his best work--his _monumentum\r\nære perennius_, was a pamphlet published in Newcastle in 1820, by\r\nPreston and Heaton, at the reasonable price of one shilling; for, unlike\r\nhis brother bards, Mr. Brown never published in an expensive form. He\r\nwas convinced that merit would not lie hid though concealed in a\r\npamphlet, but like Terence’s beauty, _diu latere non potest_, and that\r\nnonsense, though printed in quarto with the types of a Davison, would be\r\nstill unnoticed and neglected. On his once being shown the quarto\r\nedition of the “White Doe,” and told that he ought to publish in a\r\nsimilar manner, his answer was that “none but the _devil’s_ poets needed\r\nfine clothes!” The pamphlet above alluded to was entitled “Poems on\r\nMilitary Battles, Naval Victories, and other important subjects, the\r\nmost extraordinary ever penned, a Thunderbolt shot from a Lion’s Bow at\r\nSatan’s Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Devil and the Kingdom of this World\r\nreserving themselves in darkness for the great and terrible Day of the\r\nLord, as Jude, the servant of God, declareth: By JAMES BROWN, P. L.”\r\nThis singular work was decorated with a whole length portrait of the\r\nauthor treading on the “devil’s books,” and blowing a trumpet to alarm\r\nsinners; it was, as we have heard him say, the work of a junior pupil of\r\nthe ingenious Mr. Bewick.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest for Durham, in 1820, a number of copies of an\r\nelection squib, written by a humble individual connected with a northern\r\nnewspaper, and entitled “A Sublime Epistle, Poetic and Politic, by James\r\nBrown, P. L.” was sent him for distribution; these, after printing an\r\nexplanatory address on the back of the title, wherein he called himself\r\nS. S. L. D., the “Slayer of Seven Legions of Devils,” and disowned the\r\nauthorship, he turned to his own emolument by selling at sixpence a\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nIn religious affairs Brown was extremely superstitious; he believed in\r\nevery mad fanatic who broached opinions contrary to reason and sense.\r\nThe wilder the theory, the more congenial to his mind. He was\r\nsuccessively a believer in Wesley, Messrs. Buchan, Huntington, Imanuel\r\nSwedenburg, and Joanna Southcote; had he lived a little longer he would\r\nprobably have been “a ranter.” He was a great reader, and what he read\r\nhe remembered. The bible, of which he had a very old and curious pocket\r\nedition in black letter, was his favourite work; next to that he\r\nesteemed Alban Butler’s wonderful lives of the saints, to every relation\r\nof which he gave implicit credit, though, strange to tell, he was in his\r\nconversation always violent against the idolatries of the catholic\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nWhen Brown was a follower of Mr. Buchan, he used to relate that he\r\nfasted forty days and forty nights, and it is to this subject that\r\nveterinary doctor Marshall, of Durham, his legitimate successor,\r\nalludes in the following lines of an elegy he wrote on the death of his\r\nbrother poet and friend:--\r\n\r\n    “He fasted forty days and nights\r\n    When Mr. Buchan put to rights\r\n      The wicked, for a wonder;\r\n    And not so much, it has been thought,\r\n    As weigh’d the button on his coat,\r\n      He took to keep sin under.”\r\n\r\nSo said a Bion worthy of such an Adonis! but other accounts differ. If\r\nwe may credit Mr. Sykes, the respectable author of “Local Records,”\r\nMarshall erred in supposing that the poet, camelion-like, lived on air\r\nfor “forty days and forty nights.” Mr. Sykes relates that in answer to a\r\nquestion he put to him as to how he contrived for so long a time to\r\nsustain the cravings of nature, Brown replied, that “they (he and the\r\nrest of the party of fasters) only set on to the fire a great pot, in\r\nwhich they boiled water, and then stirred into it oatmeal, and supped\r\n_that_!”\r\n\r\nBrown was very susceptible of flattery, and all his life long constantly\r\nreceived letters in rhyme, purporting to come from Walter Scott, Byron,\r\nShelley, Southey, Wilson, and other great poets; with communications in\r\nprose from the king of England, the emperor of Morocco, the sultan of\r\nPersia, &c. All of these he believed to be genuine, and was in the habit\r\nof showing as curiosities to his friends, who were frequently the real\r\nauthors, and laughed in their sleeves at his credulity.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Brown received a large parchment, signed G. R., attested by\r\nMessrs. Canning and Peel, to which was suspended a large unmeaning seal,\r\nwhich he believed to be the great seal of Great Britain. This document\r\npurported to be a patent of nobility, creating him “baron Durham, of\r\nDurham, in the county palatine of Durham.” It recited that this title\r\nwas conferred on him in consequence of a translation of his works having\r\nbeen the means of converting the Mogul empire! From that moment he\r\nassumed the name and style of “baron Brown,” and had a wooden box made\r\nfor the preservation of his patent.\r\n\r\nOf the poetic pieces which Brown was in the habit of receiving, many\r\nwere close imitations of the authors whose names were affixed to them,\r\nand evinced that the writers were capable of better things. One “from\r\nMr. Coleridge,” was a respectable burlesque of the “Ancient Mariner,”\r\nand began:--\r\n\r\n    It is a lion’s trumpeter,\r\n    And he stoppeth one of three.\r\n\r\nAnother, “from Mr. Wilson,” commenced thus:--\r\n\r\n    Poetic dreams float round me now,\r\n    My spirit where art thou?\r\n    Oh! art thou watching the moonbeams smile\r\n    On the groves of palm in an Indian isle;\r\n    Or dost thou hang over the lovely main\r\n    And list to the boatswain’s boisterous strain;\r\n    Or dost thou sail on sylphid wings\r\n    Through liquid fields of air,\r\n    Or, riding on the clouds afar,\r\n    Dost thou gaze on the beams of the evening star\r\n      So beautiful and so fair.\r\n    O no! O no! sweet spirit of mine\r\n    Thou art entering a holy strain divine\r\n      A strain which is so sweet,\r\n    Oh, one might think ’twas a fairy thing,\r\n    A thing of love and blessedness,\r\n    Singing in holy tenderness,\r\n    A lay of peaceful quietness,\r\n      Within a fairy street!\r\n    But _ah! ’tis_ BROWN, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nA piece “from Walter Scott” opened with:--\r\n\r\n    The heath-cock shrill his clarion blew\r\n    Among the heights of Benvenue,\r\n    And fast the sportive echo flew,\r\n      Adown Glenavin’s vale.\r\n    But louder, louder was the knell,\r\n    Of Brown’s Northumbrian penance-bell,[337]\r\n    The noise was heard on Norham fell,\r\n      And rung through Teviotdale.\r\n\r\nThese burlesques were chiefly produced by the law and medical students\r\nin Newcastle and Durham, and the young gentlemen of the Catholic College\r\nof Ushaw, near the latter place. As the writer of this sketch was once\r\ncongratulating Mr. Brown on his numerous respectable correspondents, the\r\nold man said that he had an acquaintance far superior to any of his\r\nearthly ones, and no less a personage than the angel Gabriel, who, he\r\nstated, brought him letters from Joanna Southcote, and call to carry\r\nback his answers! This “Gabriel” was a young West Indian then residing\r\nin Durham, who used to dress himself in a sheet with goose wings on his\r\nshoulders and visit the poet at night, with letters purporting to be\r\nwritten to him in heaven by the far-famed prophetess. After “Gabriel”\r\nleft Durham, Brown was frequently told of the deception which had been\r\npractised upon him, but he never could be induced to believe that his\r\nnocturnal visiter was any other than the angel himself. “Did I not,” he\r\nonce said, “see him clearly fly out at the ceiling!” Brown used to\r\ncorrespond with some of Joanna’s followers in London, on the subject of\r\nthese supposed revelations, and actually found (_credite posteri_)\r\nbelievers in the genuineness.\r\n\r\nAmongst Brown’s strange ideas, one was that he was immortal, and should\r\nnever die. Under this delusion when ill he refused all medical\r\nassistance, and it induced him at the age of 90 to sell the little\r\nproperty which he acquired by marriage, for a paltry guinea a week, to\r\nbe paid during the life of himself and Mrs. Brown, and the life of the\r\nsurvivor. The property he parted from, in consideration of this weekly\r\nstipend, was a leasehold house in Sadler-street, (the theatre having\r\nbeen pulled down soon after the erection of the present one opposite to\r\nit,) and the house was conveyed to two Durham tradesmen, Robinson\r\nEmmerson and George Stonehouse, by whom the allowance was for some time\r\nregularly paid; but on the latter becoming embarrassed in his\r\ncircumstances, the payment was discontinued, and poor Brown and his aged\r\nwife were thrown on the world without a farthing, at a time when bodily\r\nand mental infirmities had rendered them incapable of gaining a\r\nlivelihood. Far be it from the writer of this to cast any aspersion on\r\nMessrs. Emmerson and Stonehouse, but it does certainly appear to him\r\nthat their conduct to Brown was unkind to say the least of it. After\r\nthis calamity Brown became for a few months an inhabitant of a\r\npoor-house, which he subsequently left for a lodging at an obscure inn,\r\nwhere, on the 11th of July, 1823, he died in a state of misery and\r\npenury at the advanced age of 92; his wife shortly afterwards died in\r\nthe poorhouse. They are both interred in the churchyard of St. Oswald.\r\n\r\nSuch was James Brown the Durham poet, who with all his eccentricities\r\nwas an honest, harmless and inoffensive old man. Of his personal\r\nappearance, the excellent portrait which accompanies this memoir from a\r\ndrawing by Mr. Terry is an exact resemblance. All who knew him will\r\nbear testimony to its correctness. It is indeed the only one in\r\nexistence that gives a correct idea of what he was. The other\r\nrepresentations of him are nothing better than caricatures.\r\n\r\n  D.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·45.\r\n\r\n  [336] Annual Register.\r\n\r\n  [337] Ringing the penance-bell was an expression which frequently\r\n  occurred in his writings.

N. B. About nine o’clock in the evening, a most dismal fire\r\nbroke out in a barn in which a great number of persons were met together\r\nto see a puppet-show. In the barn there were a great many loads of new\r\nlight straw; the barn was thatched with straw, which was very dry, and\r\nthe inner roof of the barn was covered with old dry cobwebs; so that the\r\nfire, like lightning, flew round the barn in an instant, and there was\r\nbut one small door belonging to the barn, which was close nailed up, and\r\ncould not be easily broke open; and when it was opened, the passage was\r\nso narrow, and every body so impatient to escape, that the door was\r\npresently blocked up, and most of those that did escape, which were but\r\nvery few, were forced to crawl over the heads and bodies of those that\r\nlay on a heap at the door, and the rest, in number seventy-six, perished\r\ninstantly, and two more died of their wounds within two days. The fire\r\nwas occasioned by the negligence of a servant, who set a candle and\r\nlantern to, or near, the heap of straw that was in the barn. The\r\nservant’s name was Richard Whitaker, of the parish of Hadstock, in\r\nEssex, near Linton, in Cambridgeshire, who was tried for the fact at the\r\nassizes held at Cambridge, March 27, 1728, but he was acquitted.”[338]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAINES CHURCH, MIDDLESEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exhumation._\r\n\r\nIn a small apartment under the staircase leading to the gallery at the\r\nwest end of the church, is presented the singular and undesirable\r\nspectacle of two unburied coffins, containing human bodies. The coffins\r\nare covered with crimson velvet and are otherwise richly embellished.\r\nThey are placed beside each other on trestles, and bear respectively the\r\nfollowing inscriptions:--\r\n\r\n  “JESSIE ASPASIA.\r\n\r\n  The most excellent and truly beloved\r\n  wife of F.

The colours of these\r\nphenomena are sometimes very well defined; but they have a more tranquil\r\ntone than those which originate in the solar beams. They are not\r\nunfrequent in the vicinity of Matlock, being mentioned by some writers\r\namong the natural curiosities of that delightful spot.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening, September 28, 1822, an extremely interesting iris\r\nof this description was distinctly observed by many persons in the\r\nneighbourhood of Boston, in Lincolnshire. It made its appearance nearly\r\nnorth, about half-past eight in the evening. This bow of the heavens was\r\nevery way complete, the curvature entire, though its span was extensive,\r\nand the altitude of its apex seemed to be about 20 degrees. The darkness\r\noccasioned by some clouds pregnant with rain, in the back ground of this\r\nwhite arch of beauty, formed a striking contrast, while several stars\r\nin the constellation of Ursa Major, (the great bear,) which were for a\r\ntime conspicuous, imparted additional grandeur to the scene.[339]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn observer of a nocturnal rainbow on the 17th of August 1788, relates\r\nits appearance particularly. “On Sunday evening, after two days, on both\r\nof which, particularly the former, there had been a great deal of rain,\r\ntogether with lightning and thunder, just as the clocks were striking\r\nnine, three and twenty hours after full moon, looking through my window,\r\nI was struck with the appearance of something in the sky which seemed\r\nlike a rainbow. Having never seen a rainbow by night, I thought it a\r\nvery extraordinary phenomenon, and hastened to a place where there were\r\nno buildings to obstruct my view of the hemisphere. The moon was truly\r\n‘walking in brightness,’ brilliant as she could be, not a cloud was to\r\nbe seen near her; and over-against her, toward the northwest, or perhaps\r\nrather more to the north, was a rainbow, a vast arch, perfect in all its\r\nparts, not interrupted or broken as rainbows frequently are, but\r\nunremittedly visible from one horizon to the other. In order to give\r\nsome idea of its extent, it is necessary to say, that, as I stood toward\r\nthe western extremity of the parish of Stoke Newington, it seemed to\r\ntake its rise from the west of Hampstead, and to end, perhaps, in the\r\nriver Lea, the eastern boundary of Tottenham; its colour was white,\r\ncloudy, or greyish, but a part of its western leg seemed to exhibit\r\ntints of a faint, sickly green. I continued viewing it for some time,\r\ntill it began to rain; and at length the rain increasing, and the sky\r\ngrowing more hazy, I returned home about a quarter or twenty minutes\r\npast nine, and in ten minutes came out again, but by that time all was\r\nover, the moon was darkened by clouds, and the rainbow of course\r\nvanished.”[340]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Pump at Hammersmith.~]\r\n\r\n    A “walking” man should not refrain\r\n    To take a saunter up Webb’s-lane,\r\n    Tow’rds Shepherd’s bush, and see a rude\r\n    Old lumb’ring pump. It’s made of wood,\r\n    And pours its water in a font\r\n    So beautiful--that if he do’n’t\r\n    Admire how such a combination\r\n    Was form’d, in such a situation,\r\n    He has no power of causation,\r\n    Or taste, or feeling; but must live\r\n    Painless, and pleasureless; and give\r\n    Himself to doing what he can;\r\n    And die a sort of sort-of-man.\r\n\r\nSome persons walk the strait road from Dan to Beersheba, and finding it\r\nfirm beneath the foot, have no regard to any thing else, and are\r\nsatisfied when they get to their journey’s end. I do not advise these\r\ngood kind of people to go to Hammersmith; but, here and there, an\r\nout-of-the-way man will be glad to bend his course thitherward, in\r\nsearch of the object represented. It is fair to say I have not seen it\r\nmyself: it turned up the other day in an artist’s sketch-book. He had\r\ntaken it as an object, could tell no more than that he liked it, and, as\r\nI seemed struck by its appearance, but could not then go to look at it\r\nand make inquiries, he volunteered his services, and wrote me as\r\nfollows:--“I went to Hammersmith, and was some time before I could find\r\nthe place again; however, I at length discovered it in Webb’s-lane,\r\nopposite the Thatched-house, (Mr. Gowland is the landlord.) There I took\r\nsome refreshment, and gained what information I could, which was but\r\nlittle. The stone _font_ with other things (old carved ornaments, &c.,\r\nwhich were used in fitting up the upper rooms of some cottages that the\r\npump belongs to) were purchased at a sale; and this was all I could\r\nobtain at the Thatched-house. Coming from thence I learned from a cobler\r\nat work that there was originally a _leaden_ pump, but that it was\r\ndoubled up, and rolled away, by some thieves, and they attempted to take\r\nthe font, but found it too heavy. The Crispin could not inform me where\r\nthe sale was, but he told me where his landlady lived and her name,\r\nwhich was Mrs. Springthorp, of Hammersmith, any one could tell me her\r\nhouse: so, being very tired, I took coach, and rode to town without\r\ninquiry. Please to send me word whether I shall do it for next week.”\r\n\r\nTo the latter inquiry my answer of course was “yes,” but I am as dark as\r\nmy informant, as to the origin of what he calls the “font” which forms\r\nthe sink of this pump. It does not appear to me to be a font, but a\r\nvase. I could have wished he had popped the question to “Mrs.\r\nSpringthorp” respecting the place from whence it came, and concerning\r\nthe “other things, old carved ornaments, &c.” I entreat some kind reader\r\nto diligently seek out and obligingly acquaint me with full particulars\r\nof these matters. In the mean time I console myself with having\r\npresented a picturesque object, and with the hope of being enabled to\r\naccount for the agreeable union.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·07.\r\n\r\n  [339] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n  [340] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 11.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODLAND WALKS.\r\n\r\nThese are delightful at any time. At about this season of the year,\r\n1817, the following poetical description appeared in a newspaper which\r\nno longer exists:--\r\n\r\nLINES\r\n\r\nBY MR. J. H. REYNOLDS.\r\n\r\n    Whence is the secret charm of this lone wood,\r\n    Which in the light of evening sweetly sleeps!--\r\n    I tread with lingering feet the quiet steeps,\r\n    Where thwarted oaks o’er their own old age brood;--\r\n    And where the gentler trees, in summer weather,\r\n    Spring up all greenly in their youth together;\r\n    And the grass is dwelling in a silent mood,\r\n    And the fir-like fern its under forest keeps\r\n    In a strange stillness. My winged spirit sweeps\r\n    Not as it hath been wont,--but stays with me\r\n    Like some domestic thing that loves its home;\r\n    It lies a-dreaming o’er the imagery\r\n    Of other scenes,--which from afar do come,\r\n    Matching them with this indolent solitude.\r\n    Here,--I am walking in the days gone by,--\r\n    And under trees which I have known before.\r\n    My heart with feelings old is running o’er--\r\n    And I am happy as the morning sky.\r\n    The present seems a mockery of the past--\r\n    And all my thoughts flow by me, like a stream,\r\n    That hath no home, that sings beneath the beam\r\n    Of the summer sun,--and wanders through sweet meads,--\r\n    In which the joyous wildflower meekly feeds,--\r\n    And strays,--and wastes away in woods at last.\r\n    My thoughts o’er many things fleet silently,--\r\n    But to this older forest creep, and cling fast.\r\n    Imagination, ever wild and free,\r\n    With heart as open as the naked sea,\r\n    Can consecrate whate’er it looks upon:--\r\n    And memory, that maiden never lone,\r\n    Lights all the dream of life.

As the black cloud approached, the sun’s\r\nrays tinged it of a dull copper colour, and the reflected light caused\r\nall the streets and houses to assume the same lurid and metallic hue.\r\nThis had a very uncommon and impressive effect. Before we reached the\r\nmayor’s house, scarce a passenger was to be seen in the streets; but we\r\nremarked women at the doors, kneeling, and turning their rosaries as\r\nthey invoked their saints. Meantime ‘thick and strong the sulphurous\r\nflame descended;’ the flashes and peals began to follow each other in\r\nalmost instantaneous succession, and the tout-ensemble became awfully\r\nsublime. A sort of whirlwind, which even raised the small gravel from\r\nthe streets, and dashed it against the windows, preceded the rain, which\r\nfell in heavy drops, but lasted only a short time. The sun now became\r\nobscured, and day seemed converted into night. Mr. Parmentier having\r\nordered wine, his lady came to explain that she could not prevail on\r\nany of the servants to venture across the court to the cellar. The\r\nmayor, in spite of our remonstrances, immediately undertook the task\r\nhimself; and when, upon his return, we apologised for putting him to so\r\nmuch trouble, he assured us that he would not on any account have lost\r\nthe brilliant sight he had enjoyed, from the incessant explosions of the\r\nelectric fluid, in the midst of such palpable darkness. Such a scene, he\r\nadded, had not occurred at Enghien for many years; and we reckoned\r\nourselves fortunate in having witnessed it. We had to remain housed for\r\nmore than two hours; when the great cloud began to clear away, and to\r\ngive promise of a serene and clear evening.”\r\n\r\nTwo days before, on the 10th, the same party had been surprised at\r\nBrussels by a similar tempest. They were on a visit to the garden of Mr.\r\nGillet, and remarking on the construction of his forcing-house. “In this\r\nforcing-house, as is usual, the front of the roof extends over the\r\nsloping glass, till it reaches the perpendicular of the parapet. Mr.\r\nGillet had no doubt, that the object of this sort of structure is to\r\nhelp to save the glass from the heavy falls of hail, which frequently\r\naccompany thunder storms. Just as he had made this observation, we\r\nperceived menacing thunder clouds approaching: the gardener hastened to\r\nsecure his glazed frames; Mr. Gillet took his leave; and before we could\r\nget home, the whole horizon was overcast; lightning flashed incessantly;\r\nthe streets seemed to have been suddenly swept of the inhabitants, the\r\nshop-doors were shut, and we could scarcely find a person of whom to\r\ninquire the way.”--The day had been altogether sultry; and at ten\r\no’clock P. M. the mercury in the thermometer stood at seventy-two\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit.[341]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 56·42.\r\n\r\n  [341] Journal of a Horticultural Tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 13.~\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 56·90.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 14.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLY CROSS.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the festival of “Holy Cross,” standing in the church of\r\nEngland calendar and almanacs, is related in vol. i. col. 1291, with\r\nsome account of the _rood_ and the _rood-loft_ in churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·20.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 15.~\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE DEVIL LOOKING OVER LINCOLN.”\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, 1731, “the famous devil that used to overlook\r\nLincoln college in Oxford, was taken down, having, about two years\r\nsince, lost his head, in a storm.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day in the same year “a crown, fixed on the top of Whitehall\r\ngate in the reign of king Charles II., fell down suddenly.”[342]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe origin of the statue of the devil at Oxford is not so certain as\r\nthat the effigy was popular, and gave rise to the saying of “the devil\r\nlooking over Lincoln.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSATANIC SUPERSTITIONS.\r\n\r\nThat the devil has a “cloven foot,” which he cannot hide if it be looked\r\nfor is a common belief with the vulgar. “The ground of this opinion at\r\nfirst,” says sir Thomas Browne, “might be his frequent appearing in the\r\nshape of a goat,” (this accounts also for his horns and tail,) “which\r\nanswers this description. This was the opinion of the ancient\r\nchristians, concerning the apparition of panites, fauns, and satyrs; and\r\nof this form we read of one that appeared to Anthony in the wilderness.”\r\nMr. Brand collects, respecting this appearance, that Othello says, in\r\nthe “Moor of Venice,”\r\n\r\n    “I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable;\r\n    If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee;”\r\n\r\nwhich Dr. Johnson explains: “I look towards his feet, to see, if,\r\naccording to the common opinion, his feet be cloven.” There is a popular\r\nsuperstition both in England and Scotland relative to _goats_: that\r\nthey are never to be seen for twenty-four hours together; and that once\r\nin that space, they pay a visit to the devil in order to have their\r\nbeards combed.\r\n\r\nBaxter, in his “World of Spirits,” mentions an anecdote from whence Mr.\r\nBrand imagines, that “this infernal visitant was in no instance treated\r\nwith more _sang froid_ on his appearing, or rather, perhaps, his\r\nimagined appearance, than by one Mr. White of Dorchester.” That\r\ngentleman was assessor to the Westminster Assembly at Lambeth, and “the\r\ndevil, in a light night, stood by his bed-side: he looked awhile whether\r\nhe would say or do any thing, and then said, ‘If thou hast nothing else\r\nto do, I have;’ and so turned himself to sleep.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKing James I. told his parliament in a speech on a certain occasion,\r\nthat “the _devil_ is a busy _bishop_.” It has been objected to this\r\nsaying of “His Most Dread Majesty,” that it would have sounded well\r\nenough from a professed enemy to the bench, “but came very improperly\r\nfrom a king who flattered them more, and was more flattered by them,\r\nthan any prince till his time.”[343]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTERS’ DEVILS.\r\n\r\nAs I was going the other day into Lincoln’s-inn, (says a writer in the\r\n“Grub-street Journal” of October 26, 1732,) under a great gateway, I met\r\nseveral lads loaded with great bundles of newspapers, which they brought\r\nfrom the stamp-office. They were all exceeding black and dirty; from\r\nwhence I inferred they were “printers’ devils,” carrying from thence the\r\nreturns of unsold newspapers, after the stamps had been cut off. They\r\nstopt under the gateway, and there laid down their loads; when one of\r\nthem made the following harangue: “Devils, gentlemen, and\r\nbrethren:--though I think we have no reason to be ashamed on account of\r\nthe vulgar opinion concerning the origin of our name, yet we ought to\r\nacknowledge ourselves obliged to the learned herald, who, upon the death\r\nof any person of title, constantly gives an exact account of his ancient\r\nfamily in my London Evening Post. He says, there was one monsieur\r\nDevile, or De Ville, who came over with William the Conqueror, in\r\ncompany with De Laune, De Vice, De Val, D’Ashwood, D’Urfie, D’Umpling,\r\n&c. One of the sons of a descendant of this monsieur De Ville, was taken\r\nin by the famous Caxton in 1471, as an errand boy; was afterwards his\r\napprentice, and in time an eminent printer, from whom our order took\r\ntheir name; but suppose they took it from infernal devils, it was not\r\nbecause they were messengers frequently sent in darkness, and appeared\r\nvery black, but upon a reputable account, viz., John Fust, or Faustus,\r\nof Mentz, in Germany, was the inventor of printing, for which he was\r\ncalled a conjurer, and his art the black art. As he kept a constant\r\nsuccession of boys to run on errands, who were always very black, these\r\nthey called devils; some of whom being raised to be his apprentices, he\r\nwas said to have raised many a devil. As to the inferior order among us,\r\ncalled flies, employed in taking newspapers off the press, they are of\r\nlater extraction, being no older than newspapers themselves. Mr. Bailey\r\nthinks, their original name was lies, taken from the papers they so took\r\noff, and the alteration occasioned thus. To hasten these boys, the\r\npressmen used to cry flie, lie, which naturally fell into one single\r\nword lie. This conjecture is confirmed by a little corruption in the\r\ntrue title of the fLying Post; since, therefore, we are both\r\ncomprehended under the title of devils, let us discharge our office with\r\ndiligence; so may we attain, as many of our predecessors have done, to\r\nthe dignity of printers, and to have an opportunity of using others as\r\nmuch like poor devils, as we have been used by them, or as they and\r\nauthors are used by booksellers. These are an upstart profession, who\r\nhave engrossed the business of bookselling, which originally belonged\r\nsolely to our masters.

Thus, when\r\nthey would commend any thing, they break out into this pious\r\nexclamation, “Diable! que cela est bon!” When they would represent a man\r\nhonest, sincere, and sociable, they call him “un bon Diable.” Some of\r\nour own countrymen will say, a thing is “devilish good;” a lady is\r\n“devilish pretty.” In a mixture of surprise and approbation, they say,\r\n“the devil’s in this fellow, or he is a comical devil.” Others speak of\r\nthe apostate angel with abhorrence, and nothing is more common than to\r\nsay, “such a one is a sad devil.” I remember when I was at St. Germains,\r\na story of a gentleman, who being in waiting at the court of king James\r\nII., and the discourse running upon demons and apparitions, the king\r\nasked him whether ever he had seen any thing of that sort. “Yes,”\r\nreplied he, “last night.” His majesty asked him what he had seen. He\r\nanswered, “the devil.” Being asked in what shape,--“O sir,” said he,\r\nwith a sigh, “in his usual and natural shape, that of an empty\r\nbottle.”[344]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 59·32.\r\n\r\n  [342] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [343] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [344] Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 16.~\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAUDULENT DEBTOR.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September, 1735, Mr. Yardley died in the Fleet prison,\r\nwhere he had been confined nearly ten years in execution for a debt of a\r\nhundred pounds.

His sister-in law and executrix, who lived in\r\nStaffordshire, wrote to Mr. Cotton, a broker, to take care of the\r\neffects in her behalf; and he having read a Mr. Warren’s advertisement\r\nof his chambers having been robbed, found several of his writings there;\r\nseveral things of a Mr. Ellis, who had been robbed about two years\r\nbefore of above three hundred pounds, of a Mr. Lawson’s of the Temple,\r\nand of captain Haughton’s, whose chambers were broken open some years\r\npreviously, and two hundred pounds’ reward offered for his writings,\r\nwhich were a part found here. There were also found books to one hundred\r\npounds’ value, belonging to Mr. Osborne the bookseller in Gray’s-inn.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that when Mr. Rudkins had any thing in view in this\r\nway, he would padlock up his own door, and take horse at noonday, giving\r\nout to his laundress that he was going into the country. His chambers\r\nconsisted of five rooms, two of which not even his laundress was ever\r\nadmitted into, and in these was found the booty, with all his working\r\ntools, picklocks, &c. He had formerly been a tradesman in King-street,\r\nnear Guildhall. It is further remarkable of this private house-breaker,\r\nthat he always went to Abingdon’s coffee-house, in Holborn, on an\r\nexecution-day, to see from thence the poor wretches pass by to their\r\ndismal end; and at no other time did he frequent that coffee-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·95.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 18.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE I.

These papers were\r\ndrawn up in Latin by the celebrated professor Heyne, and are printed in\r\nthe “Gentleman’s Magazine” for June, 1789. King George IV., when prince\r\nregent in 1814, sent a copy of every important work published in England\r\nduring the ten preceding years, as a present to the library of the\r\nuniversity, agreeable to a promise he had made to that purport.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 57·87.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 20.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH--_Cholera Morbus_.\r\n\r\nThis is, of all times of the year, the most productive of epidemical\r\ndisorders of the bowels, which are erroneously ascribed to fruits, but\r\nwhich, in reality, the autumnal fruits seem best calculated to mollify.\r\nIf the diarrhea be very violent, or accompanied with incessant vomiting,\r\nas in _cholera morbus_, the best practice is, after the intestinal canal\r\nhas been suffered copiously to evacuate itself, to take small doses of\r\nchalk, or of some other substance known to check the disorder, with\r\nwhich chemists are always prepared. But in ordinary cases, it is a safer\r\nplan to let the disease spend itself, as there is a great deal of\r\nirritation of the intestines, which the flux carries off. We should\r\navoid eating animal food, but take tea, broths, gruel, and other\r\ndiluents, and the disorder will usually soon subside of itself. After it\r\nhas so subsided we should guard against its return, by taking great care\r\nto keep the bowels regular, by eating light and vegetable food and\r\nfruits, or now and then taking a gentle dose of aloes, gr. iiii. The\r\npills which commonly go by the name of Hunt’s pills, if genuine, are\r\nvery good medicines to regulate the bowels. When low spirits and want of\r\nbile indicate the liver to partake much of the disease, two grains of\r\nthe pil. hydrarg., commonly called blue pill, may be used now and then\r\nwith advantage.[346]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·45.\r\n\r\n  [346] Dr. Forster’s Perennial Calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 21.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASON.\r\n\r\nSwallows and martins are still very numerous, the general migration not\r\nhaving begun.

MAURICE.\r\n\r\nThis saint, to whom and his companions a festival is celebrated by the\r\nRomish church on this day, received a similar honour in England. They\r\nare said to have been officers in the Theban legion, which refused to\r\nsacrifice to the gods on their march into Gaul, and were, therefore,\r\nordered to be decimated by Maximian. Every tenth man was accordingly put\r\nto death, and on their continued resistance, a second decimation\r\nordered, and Maurice and his companions encouraged them, and the whole\r\nlegion consisting of six thousand six hundred men, well armed, being no\r\nway intimidated to idolatry by cruelty, were slaughtered by the rest of\r\nthe army, and relics of their bodies were gathered and preserved, and\r\nworked miracles.[348]\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THREEKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe village of Threekingham, in the county of Lincoln, was known by the\r\nname of Laundon, previous to this day, A. D. 870, when a battle was\r\nfought between the English and Danes, of which Ingulphus, a monk of\r\nCrowland abbey, has left the following account.\r\n\r\nThe Danes entered England in the year 879, and wintered at York; and in\r\nthe year 880 proceeded to the parts of Lindsey, in Lincolnshire, where\r\nthey commenced their destructive depredations by laying waste the abbey\r\nof Bardney. In the month of September in the latter year, earl Algar,\r\nwith two of his seneschals, (Wibert, owner of Wiberton, and Leofric,\r\nowner of Leverton,) attended by the men of Holland (Lincolnshire), Toly,\r\na monk (formerly a soldier), with two hundred men belonging to Crowland\r\nabbey, and three hundred from Deeping, Langtoft, and Boston, Morcar,\r\nlord of Bourn, with his powerful family, and Osgot, sheriff of\r\nLincolnshire, with the forces of the county, being five hundred more,\r\nmustered in Kesteven, on the day of St. Maurice, and fought with the\r\nDanes, over whom they obtained considerable advantage, killing three of\r\ntheir kings and many of their private soldiers, and pursued the rest to\r\ntheir very camp, until night obliged them to separate. In the same night\r\nseveral princes and earls of the Danes, with their followers, who had\r\nbeen out in search of plunder, came to the assistance of their\r\ncountrymen; by the report of which many of the English were so dismayed\r\nthat they took to flight. Those, however, who had resolution to face the\r\nenemy in the morning, went to prayers, and were marshalled for battle.\r\nAmong the latter was Toly with his five hundred men in the right wing,\r\nwith Morcar and his followers to support them; and Osgot the sheriff,\r\nwith his five hundred men, and with the stout knight, Harding de\r\nRiehall, and the men of Stamford. The Danes, after having buried the\r\nthree kings whom they had lost the day before, at a place there called\r\nLaundon, but since, from that circumstance, called _Three-king-ham_,\r\nmarched out into the field. The battle began, and the English, though\r\nmuch inferior in numbers, kept their ground the greater part of the day\r\nwith steadiness and resolution, until the Danes feigning a flight, were\r\nrashly pursued without attention to order. The Danes then took advantage\r\nof the confusion of the English, returned to the charge, and made their\r\nopponents pay dearly for their temerity; in fine, the Danes were\r\ncompletely victorious. In this battle, earl Algar, the monk Toly, and\r\nmany other valiant men, were slain on the part of the English; after\r\nwhich the Danes proceeded to the destruction of the abbeys of Crowland,\r\nThorney, Ramsey and Hamstede (Peterborough) and many other places in the\r\nneighbourhood.--Thus far is from Ingulphus the monk.\r\n\r\nA fair, said to have arisen from the above circumstance, is annually\r\nheld at _Three-king-ham_, on a remarkable piece of ground, called _Stow\r\nGreen Hill_, reported to be the spot whereon the battle was principally\r\ncontested, and Domesday-book in some degree corroborates the statement;\r\nfor in the Conqueror’s time, A. D. 1080, when that survey was taken, we\r\nfind that there was then a fair held here, which yielded forty\r\nshillings, accounted for to Gilbert de Gand, lord of Foldingham. This\r\nfair, however, is not held now in the month of September, but commences\r\non the 15th of June, and continues till the fourth of July, and was very\r\nprobably changed in the fifty-second year of the reign of king Henry\r\nIII., who according to Tanner’s “Notitia Monastica,” granted a charter\r\nfor a fair at this place to the monastery of Sempringham.\r\n\r\n  SLEAFORDENSIS.\r\n\r\n  _September 8, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 57·70.\r\n\r\n  [348] Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 23.~\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE WINTER THEATRES.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nTo cultivate pleasant associations, may well be deemed a part and parcel\r\nof the philosophy of life. Now that spring, that sweet season redolent\r\nof flowers and buds hath passed away, and summer mellowing into autumn,\r\nhas well nigh fallen into the “sere the yellow leaf,” _we_ in “populous\r\ncity pent,” gladly revert to those social enjoyments peculiar to a great\r\nmetropolis, and among which stand conspicuous, the amusements of the\r\nacted drama.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the winter theatres may be reckoned as one of the\r\nprincipal _fasti_ of cockney land, an epoch which distinctly marks the\r\ncommencement of a winter in London. How changed from the auspicious\r\nseason, when the bright sun glancing into our gloomy retreats,\r\ntantalizes us with visions of the breathing sweets of nature, and when\r\nwe in our very dreams “babbled of green fields,”--to the period when\r\neven the thronged and dirty streets are endurable, as we wend our way\r\nperchance through a fog, (a London particular,) towards the crowded and\r\ngaily lighted theatre, by contrast made more brilliant.\r\n\r\n“My first play” forms an era to most young persons, and is generally\r\ncherished among our more agreeable juvenile reminiscences: but the\r\nsubject has been recently expatiated upon so delightfully and in so\r\ngenial a spirit by ELIA, as almost to make further comment “a wasteful\r\nand ridiculous excess.” I well remember the vast and splendid area of\r\nold Drury-lane theatre, where the mysterious green curtain portico, to\r\nthat curious microcosm the stage, first met my youthful gaze. The\r\nperformances were, the “Stranger” and “Blue Beard,” both then in the\r\nvery bloom of their popularity: and whatever difference of opinion may\r\nexist as to the moral tendency of the first, all must allow that never\r\npiece was more effective in the representation, when aided by the\r\nunrivalled talents of Kemble, and Mrs. Siddons, at that time in the\r\nzenith of their powers. I confess, that to my unsophisticated boyish\r\nfeelings, subdued by the cunning of the scene, it seemed quite natural,\r\nthat the sufferings of bitter remorse and repentance should suffice to\r\nensure the pity and forgiveness of outraged society.--Happy age, when\r\nthe generous impulses of our nature are not yet blunted by the stern\r\nexperience of after life!\r\n\r\nThis brings me to record a remarkable and disastrous event in theatrical\r\nannals, and one which in a great measure suggested the present\r\ncommunication. It was my fortune to be present at the _last_\r\nperformances ever given on the boards of Old Drury--and which took place\r\non Thursday evening the 23rd of February, 1809--when was acted for the\r\nfirst, and as it proved, the last time, a new opera composed by Bishop,\r\ncalled the “Circassian Bride.” The next night this magnificent theatre\r\nwas a pile of burning ruins. The awful grandeur of the conflagration\r\ndefies description, but to enlarge upon a circumstance so comparatively\r\nrecent would be purely gratuitous; it was, however, an event which might\r\nbe truly said, “to eclipse the harmless gaiety of nations,”--for the\r\nmetropolis then presented the unprecedented spectacle of the national\r\ndrama without a home,--the two sister theatres both prostrate in the\r\ndust!\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a copy of the play-bill, which at this distance of time, may\r\nperhaps be valued as an interesting relic, illustrative of dramatic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n  J.

H., and read\r\nwhat I shall never approach to, in writing, were I to “grind my quill\r\nthese hundred years”----\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST PLAY\r\n\r\nBY ELIA.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of Cross-court there yet stands a portal, of some\r\narchitectural pretensions, though reduced to humble use, serving at\r\npresent for an entrance to a printing-office. This old door-way, if you\r\nare young, reader, you may not know was the identical pit entrance to\r\nOld Drury--Garrick’s Drury--all of it that is left. I never pass it\r\nwithout shaking some forty years from off my shoulders, recurring to the\r\nevening when I passed through it to see _my first play_. The afternoon\r\nhad been wet, and the condition of our going (the elder folks and\r\nmyself) was, that the rain should cease. With what a beating heart did I\r\nwatch from the window the puddles, from the stillness of which I was\r\ntaught to prognosticate the desired cessation! I seem to remember the\r\nlast spurt, and the glee with which I ran to announce it.\r\n\r\nWe went with orders, which my godfather F. had sent us. He kept the oil\r\nshop (now Davies’s) at the corner of Featherstone-building, in Holborn.\r\nF. was a tall grave person, lofty in speech, and had pretensions above\r\nhis rank. He associated in those days with John Palmer, the comedian,\r\nwhose gait and bearing he seemed to copy; if John (which is quite as\r\nlikely) did not rather borrow somewhat of his manner from my godfather.\r\nHe was also known to, and visited by, Sheridan. It was to his house in\r\nHolborn, that young Brinsley brought his first wife on her elopement\r\nwith him from a boarding school at Bath--the beautiful Maria Linley. My\r\nparents were present (over a quadrille table) when he arrived in the\r\nevening with his harmonious charge.--From either of these connections,\r\nit may be inferred that my godfather could command an order for the then\r\nDrury-lane theatre at pleasure--and, indeed, a pretty liberal issue of\r\nthose cheap billets, in Brinsley’s easy autograph, I have heard him say\r\nwas the sole remuneration which he had received for many years’ nightly\r\nillumination of the orchestra, and various avenues of that theatre--and\r\nhe was content that it should be so. The honour of Sheridan’s\r\nfamiliarity--or supposed familiarity--was better to my godfather than\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nF. was the most gentlemanly of oilmen; grandiloquent, yet courteous. His\r\ndelivery of the commonest matters of fact was Ciceronian. He had two\r\nLatin words almost constantly in his mouth, (how odd sounds Latin from\r\nan oilman’s lips!) which my better knowledge since, has enabled me to\r\ncorrect. In strict pronunciation they should have been sounded _vice\r\nversâ_--but in those young years they impressed me with more awe than\r\nthey would now do, read aright from Seneca or Varro--in his own peculiar\r\npronunciation, monosyllabically elaborated, or anglicized, into\r\nsomething like _verse verse_. By an imposing manner, and the help of\r\nthese distorted syllables, he climbed (but that was little) to the\r\nhighest parochial honours which St. Andrew’s has to bestow.\r\n\r\nHe is dead, and thus much I thought due to his memory, both for my first\r\norders (little wondrous talismans!--slight keys, and insignificant to\r\noutward sight, but opening to me more than Arabian paradises!) and\r\nmoreover, that by his testamentary beneficence I came into possession of\r\nthe only landed property which I could ever call my own--situate near\r\nthe road-way village of pleasant Puckeridge, in Hertfordshire. When I\r\njournied down to take possession, and planted foot on my own ground, the\r\nstately habits of the donor descended upon me, and I strode (shall I\r\nconfess the vanity?) with larger paces over my allotment of three\r\nquarters of an acre, with its commodious mansion in the midst with the\r\nfeeling of an English freeholder, that all betwixt sky and centre was my\r\nown. The estate has passed into more prudent hands, and nothing but an\r\nagrarian can restore it.\r\n\r\nIn those days were pit orders. Beshrew the uncomfortable manager who\r\nabolished them!--with one of these we went. I remember the waiting at\r\nthe door--not that which is left--but between that and an inner door in\r\nshelter--O when shall I be such an expectant again;--with the cry of\r\nnonpareils, an indispensable playhouse accompaniment in those days. As\r\nnear as I can recollect, the fashionable pronunciation of the theatrical\r\nfruiteresses then was, “Chase some oranges, chase some numparels, chase\r\na bill of the play;”--chase _pro_ chuse. But when we got in, and I\r\nbeheld the green curtain that veiled a heaven to my imagination, which\r\nwas soon to be disclosed--the breathless anticipations I endured! I had\r\nseen something like it in the plate prefixed to “Troilus and Cressida,”\r\nin Rowe’s “Shakspeare”--the tent scene with Diomede--and a sight of that\r\nplate can always bring back in a measure the feeling of that\r\nevening.--The boxes at that time, full of well-dressed women of quality,\r\nprojected over the pit; and the pilasters reaching down were adorned\r\nwith a glistering substance (I know not what) under glass (as it seemed)\r\nresembling--a homely fancy--but I judged it to be sugar-candy--yet, to\r\nmy raised imagination, divested of its homelier qualities, it appeared a\r\nglorified candy!--The orchestra lights at length arose, those “fair\r\nAuroras!” Once the bell sounded. It was to ring out yet once again--and,\r\nincapable of the anticipation, I reposed my shut eyes in a sort of\r\nresignation upon the maternal lap. It rang the second time. The curtain\r\ndrew up--I was not past six years old--and the play was Artaxerxes!\r\n\r\nI had dabbled a little in the Universal History--the ancient part of\r\nit--and here was the court of Persia. It was being admitted to a sight\r\nof the past. I took no proper interest in the action going on, for I\r\nunderstood not its import--but I heard the word Darius, and I was in the\r\nmidst of Daniel. All feeling was absorbed in vision. Gorgeous vests,\r\ngardens, palaces, princesses, passed before me. I knew not players. I\r\nwas in Persepolis for the time; and the burning idol of their devotion\r\nalmost converted me into a worshipper. I was awe-struck, and believed\r\nthose significations to be something more than elemental fires. It was\r\nall enchantment and a dream. No such pleasure has since visited me but\r\nin dreams.--Harlequin’s Invasion followed; where, I remember, the\r\ntransformation of the magistrates into reverend beldams seemed to me a\r\npiece of grave historic justice, and the tailor carrying his own head to\r\nbe as sober a verity as the legend of St. Denys.\r\n\r\nThe next play to which I was taken was the “Lady of the Manor,” of\r\nwhich, with the exception of some scenery, very faint traces are left in\r\nmy memory. It was followed by a pantomime, called “Lun’s Ghost”--a\r\nsatiric touch, I apprehend, upon Rich, not long since dead--but to my\r\napprehension (too sincere for satire) “Lun” was as remote a piece of\r\nantiquity as “Lud”--the father of a line of Harlequins--transmitting his\r\ndagger of lath (the wooden sceptre) through countless ages. I saw the\r\nprimeval Motley come from his silent tomb in a ghastly vest of white\r\npatch-work, like the apparition of a dead rainbow. So harlequins\r\n(thought I) look when they are dead.\r\n\r\nMy third play followed in quick succession. It was the “Way of the\r\nWorld.” I think I must have sat at it as grave as a judge; for, I\r\nremember, the hysteric affectations of good lady Wishfort affected me\r\nlike some solemn tragic passion. “Robinson Crusoe” followed; in which\r\nCrusoe, man Friday, and the parrot, were as good and authentic as in the\r\nstory.--The clownery and pantaloonery of these pantomimes have clean\r\npassed out of my head. I believe, I no more laughed at them, than at the\r\nsame age I should have been disposed to laugh at the grotesque Gothic\r\nheads (seeming to me then replete with devout meaning) that gape, and\r\ngrin, in stone around the inside of the old round church (my church) of\r\nthe Templars.\r\n\r\nI saw these plays in the season 1781-2, when I was from six to seven\r\nyears old. After the intervention of six or seven other years (for at\r\nschool all play-going was inhibited) I again entered the doors of a\r\ntheatre. That old Artaxerxes evening had never done ringing in my fancy.\r\nI expected the same feelings to come again with the same occasion. But\r\nwe differ from ourselves less at sixty and sixteen, than the latter does\r\nfrom six. In that interval what had I not lost! At the first period I\r\nknew nothing, understood nothing, discriminated nothing. I felt all,\r\nloved all, wondered all--\r\n\r\n    Was nourished, I could not tell how.--\r\n\r\nI had left the temple a devotee, and was returned a rationalist. The\r\nsame things were there materially; but the emblem, the reference, was\r\ngone!--The green curtain was no longer a veil, drawn between two worlds,\r\nthe unfolding of which was to bring back past ages, to present “a royal\r\nghost,”--but a certain quantity of green baize, which was to separate\r\nthe audience for a given time from certain of their fellow-men who were\r\nto come forward and pretend those parts. The lights--the orchestra\r\nlights--came up a clumsy machinery. The first ring, and the second ring,\r\nwas now but a trick of the prompter’s bell--which had been, like the\r\nnote of the cuckoo, a phantom of a voice, no hand seen or guessed at\r\nwhich ministered to its warning. The actors were men and women painted.\r\nI thought the fault was in them; but it was in myself, and the\r\nalteration which those many centuries--of six short twelvemonths--had\r\nwrought in me. Perhaps it was fortunate for me that the play of the\r\nevening was but an indifferent comedy, as it gave me time to crop some\r\nunreasonable expectations, which might have interfered with the genuine\r\nemotions with which I was soon after enabled to enter upon the first\r\nappearance to me of Mrs. Siddons in “Isabella.” Comparison and\r\nretrospection soon yielded to the present attraction of the scene; and\r\nthe theatre became to me, upon a new stock, the most delightful of\r\nrecreations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter this robbery of “ELIA,” my conscience forces me to declare that I\r\nwish every reader would save me from the shame of further temptation to\r\ntransgress, by ordering “ELIA” into his collection. There is no volume\r\nin our language so full of beauty, truth, and feeling, as the volume of\r\n“ELIA.” I am convinced that every person who has not seen it, and may\r\ntake the hint, will thank me for acquainting him with a work which he\r\ncannot look into without pleasure, nor lay down without regret. It is a\r\ndelicious book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERBORNE BELLS.\r\n\r\nOn this day it is a custom to exercise the largest bell of one of our\r\ncountry churches, in the manner described in the following\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLLING DAY.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe 23d of September has obtained in Sherborne, Dorset, the name of\r\n“tolling-day,” in commemoration of the death of John Lord Digby, baron\r\nDigby of Sherborne, and earl of Bristol, in the year MDCXCVIII. and in\r\nconformity with the following wish expressed in a codicil annexed to his\r\nlordship’s will.\r\n\r\n“Item, I give and bequeath out of my said estate to the parish church,\r\nthe yearly sum of ten pounds, to be paid by my successors, lords of the\r\nsaid manor for the time being, at and upon, or within forty days after,\r\nthe feast days of St. Michael the archangel, and of the annunciation of\r\nour blessed lady St. Mary the virgin, by equal portions yearly and for\r\never, and to be employed and bestowed by the churchwardens of the said\r\nparish for the time being, with the consent of the lord of the said\r\nmanor for the time being, in keeping in good repair the chancel, and\r\ntowards the reparations of the rest of the said church, yearly and for\r\never; provided that my successors, the lord or lords of the said manor\r\nfor the time being, shall have and enjoy a convenient pew, or seat, in\r\nthe said chancel for himself and family for ever; and provided that the\r\nsaid churchwardens for the time being, shall cause the largest bell in\r\nthe tower of the said church, to be tolled six full hours, that is to\r\nsay, from five to nine of the clock in the forenoon, and from twelve\r\no’clock till two in the afternoon, on that day of the said month whereon\r\nit shall be my lot to depart this life, every year and for ever;\r\notherwise this gift of ten pounds per annum shall determine and be\r\nvoid.”\r\n\r\nThis custom is annually observed, but not to the extent above intended,\r\nthe tolling of the bell being limited to two hours instead of six. It\r\nbegins to toll at six o’clock and continues till seven in the morning,\r\nwhen six men, who toll the bell for church service, repair to the\r\nmansion of the present earl Digby, with two large stone jars, which are\r\nthere filled with some of his lordship’s strong beer, and, with a\r\nquantity of bread and cheese, taken to the church by the tollers and\r\nequally divided amongst them, together with a small remuneration in\r\nmoney paid by the churchwardens as a compensation for their labour. At\r\ntwelve o’clock the bell is again tolled till one, and in the evening\r\ndivine service is performed at the church, and a lecture suited to the\r\noccasion delivered from the pulpit; for which lecture or sermon the\r\nvicar is paid thirty pounds, provided by the will of the above donor.\r\n\r\n  R.

They both ran very swiftly, but the young lady\r\nbounded forward with the agility of the chamois and the fleetness of the\r\ndeer, and returned to the spot from whence they started a considerable\r\ndistance before the gentleman. She appeared much pleased with her\r\nvictory. There were but few persons on the Steyne at the time, but those\r\nwho were there, expressed their admiration at the swiftness of this\r\nsecond Atalanta.[349]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Hazlitt’s “Notes of a Journey through France and Italy,” he\r\nmentions the place from whence he sailed for the continent:--\r\n\r\n“Brighton stands facing the sea, on the bare cliffs, with glazed windows\r\nto reflect the glaring sun, and black pitchy bricks shining like the\r\nscales of fishes. The town is however gay with the influx of London\r\nvisiters--happy as the conscious abode of its sovereign! Every thing\r\nhere appears in motion--coming or going. People at a watering-place may\r\nbe compared to the flies of a summer; or to fashionable dresses, or\r\nsuits of clothes, walking about the streets. The only idea you gain is,\r\nof finery and motion. The road between London and Brighton, presents\r\nsome very charming scenery; Reigate is a prettier English country-town\r\nthan is to be found anywhere--out of England! As we entered Brighton in\r\nthe evening, a Frenchman was playing and singing to a guitar.--The\r\ngenius of the south had come out to meet us.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hazlitt arrived at Brighton, it was in the full season. He\r\nsays, “A lad offered to conduct us to an inn. ‘Did he think there was\r\nroom?’ He was sure of it. ‘Did he belong to the inn?’ ‘No,’ he was from\r\nLondon. In fact, he was a young gentleman from town, who had been\r\nstopping some time at the White-horse hotel, and who wished to employ\r\nhis spare time (when he was not riding out on a blood-horse) in serving\r\nthe house, and relieving the perplexities of his fellow-travellers. No\r\none but a Londoner would volunteer his assistance in this way. Amiable\r\nland of _Cockayne_, happy in itself, and in making others happy! Blest\r\nexuberance of self-satisfaction, that overflows upon others! Delightful\r\nimpertinence, that is forward to oblige them!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is here both in place and season, to quote a passage of remarkably\r\nfine thought:--\r\n\r\n“There is something in being near the sea, like the confines of\r\neternity. It is a new element, a pure abstraction. The mind loves to\r\nhover on that which is endless, and for ever the same. People wonder at\r\na steam-boat, the invention of man, managed by man, that makes its\r\nliquid path like an iron railway through the sea--I wonder at the sea\r\nitself, that vast Leviathan, rolled round the earth, smiling in its\r\nsleep, waked into fury, fathomless, boundless, a huge world of\r\nwater-drops.--Whence is it, whither goes it, is it of eternity or of\r\nnothing? Strange ponderous riddle, that we can neither penetrate nor\r\ngrasp in our comprehension, ebbing and flowing like human life, and\r\nswallowing it up in thy remorseless womb,--what art thou? What is there\r\nin common between thy life and ours, who gaze at thee? Blind, deaf and\r\nold, thou seest not, hearest not, understandest not; neither do we\r\nunderstand, who behold and listen to thee! Great as thou art,\r\nunconscious of thy greatness, unwieldy, enormous, preposterous\r\ntwin-birth of matter, rest in thy dark, unfathomed cave of mystery,\r\nmocking human pride and weakness. Still is it given to the mind of man\r\nto wonder at thee, to confess its ignorance, and to stand in awe of thy\r\nstupendous might and majesty, and of its own being, that can question\r\nthine!”[350]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Hazlitt’s “Journey through France and Italy,” there are\r\n“thoughts that breathe and words that burn.” His conceptions of beauty\r\nand grandeur, are at all times simple and vast. His works are pervaded\r\nby the results of profound thinking. His sentences have the power of\r\nelevating things that are deemed little remarkable, and of lowering\r\nthose which successive submissions to over praise, have preposterously\r\nmagnified. Many of the remarks on works of art, in his “Notes of a\r\nJourney through France and Italy,” will be wholly new to persons who\r\nnever reflected on the subjects of his criticism, and will not be openly\r\nassented to by others thinking as _he_ does, who, for the first time,\r\nhas ventured to publicly dissent from received notions. If any of his\r\nopinions be deemed incorrect, the difference can easily be arbitrated.\r\nTaking the originals, whether corporeal or imaginary existences, as the\r\nstandard, our pure sight and feeling may be relied on as unerring judges\r\nof the imitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·27.\r\n\r\n  [349] Brighton paper.\r\n\r\n  [350] Mr. Hazlitt’s Journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

This is especially the\r\ncase between the highest and the lowest of three stone bridges, by which\r\nthe old town or burgh is connected with the new town. In this shallow\r\npart of the stream, parties of boys construct, on _Hallow-eve_,--the\r\nnight when varied superstitions engross most of old Scotia’s\r\npeasantry,--circular raised hearths, if I may so term them, of earth or\r\nclay; bordered by a low round wall composed of loose stones, sods, &c.\r\nWithin these enclosures, the boys kindle on their hearths, bonfires,\r\noften of considerable size. From the bridges, the appearance of these\r\nbonfires, after nightfall, is singular; and attracts, as spectators,\r\nmany of the grown-up inhabitants of the place. The number and glare of\r\nthe fires, their tremulous reflection in the surrounding water, the dark\r\nmoving figures of the boys that group around them, and the shouts and\r\nscreams set up by the youthful urchins in testimony of enjoyment, might\r\nalmost make one fancy that the rites and incantations of magic, or of\r\nwizardry, were taking place before one’s very eyes. What is the origin\r\nof this custom, or how long it has prevailed, I do not know.\r\n\r\nEre I relinquish my pen, allow me to describe to you another singular\r\ncustom, which obtains in the largest town of England, north of the\r\nTrent.[351] No one is better acquainted than, Mr. Hone, are you, with\r\nthe existence of the wake or feast, still held annually in some of the\r\ntowns, and nearly all the parochial villages of the midland and northern\r\ncounties. In many of the larger towns, the traces of the ancient wake\r\nare, indeed, nearly worn out, and this is pretty much the case with that\r\nparticular town, to which reference has just been made, namely,\r\nSheffield; our great national emporium for cutlery, files, edge-tools,\r\nand the better kinds of plated goods. Only in a few ancient and\r\nprimitive families, do roast beef, plum-pudding, and an extra allowance\r\nof Yorkshire stingo, gracing, on _Trinity Sunday_, a large table, begirt\r\nwith some dozen of happy, and happy-faced town and country cousins,\r\nshow, that the venerable head of the family, and his antique dame, have\r\nnot forgotten Sheffield feast-day. But if the observance of Sheffield\r\nfeast itself be thus partial, and verging towards disuse, amends is made\r\nfor the circumstance, in the establishment, and pretty vigorous keeping\r\nup of sundry local feasts, held on different days, within the town, or\r\nin its suburbs. Besides those of the Wicker and little Sheffield, which\r\nare suburban, Broad-lane and Scotland-street, in the town itself, have\r\ntheir respective feasts too. At Little Sheffield and in Broad-lane, the\r\nzest of the annual festivity is often heightened by ass-races;\r\nfoot-races, masculine, for a hat; foot-races, feminine, for a chemise;\r\ngrinning-matches; and, though less frequently, the humours and rattle of\r\na mountebank and his merry andrew. Occasionally too changes, in\r\nimitation of those on the church bells, are rung, by striking with a\r\nhammer, or a short piece of steel, on six, eight, or ten long bars each\r\nsuspended by twine from the roof of a workshop, and the entire set\r\nchosen so as to resemble pretty nearly, a ring of bells, both in\r\ndiversity and in sequence of tone.[352]\r\n\r\n_Scotland feast_, however, in point of interest, bears away the bell\r\nfrom all the other district revels of Sheffield. It is so called from\r\nScotland-street, already mentioned; a long, hilly, and very populous\r\none, situated in the northern part of the town. On the eve of the feast,\r\nwhich is yearly held on the 29th of May, the anniversary of the\r\nrestoration of our second Charles, parties of the inhabitants repair\r\ninto the neighbouring country; whence, chiefly however from\r\nWalkley-bank, celebrated as Sheffield schoolboys too well know for birch\r\ntrees, they bring home, at dead of night, or morning’s earliest dawn,\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty well-sized trees, besides a profusion of\r\nbranches. The trees they instantly plant in two rows; one on each side\r\nof the street, just without the kirbstone of the flagged pavement. With\r\nthe branches, they decorate the doors and windows of houses, the\r\nsign-boards of drinking-shops, and so on. By five or six in the morning\r\nScotland-street, which is not very wide, has the appearance of a grove.\r\nAnd soon, from ropes stretched across it, three, four, or five, superb\r\n_garlands_ delight the eyes, and dance over the heads of the feast-folk.\r\nThese garlands are composed of hoops, wreathed round with foliage and\r\nflowers, fluttering with variously coloured ribands, rustling with\r\nasidew,[353] and gay with silver tankards, pints, watches, &c. Before\r\nthe door of the principal alehouse, the largest tree is always planted.\r\nThe sign of this house is, if memory do not deceive me, the royal\r\noak.[354] But be this as it may, certain it is, that duly ensconced\r\namong the branches of the said tree, may always be seen the effigy, in\r\nsmall, of king Charles the Second: to commemorate indeed the happy\r\nconcealment and remarkable escape of the merry monarch, at Boscobel,\r\nshould seem to be the object of creating a _sylvan_ scene at “Scotland\r\nfeast;” while that of holding the feast itself on the anniversary of his\r\nrestoration is, there can be little doubt, to celebrate with honour the\r\nprincipal event in the life of him, after whose ancient and peculiar\r\nkingdom the street itself is named. To the particulars already given, it\r\nneeds scarcely be added, that dancing, drinking, and other merry-making\r\nare, as a Scotsman would say, _rife_,[355] at the annual commemoration\r\nthus briefly described.\r\n\r\nThanking you for much instruction, as well as entertainment, already\r\nderived from your book, and wishing you success from its publication, I\r\nremain, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  GULIELMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asidew._\r\n\r\nIn vol. i. col. 1213, _arsedine_ is noticed as having been in use at\r\nBartholomew fair, and Mr. Archdeacon Nares’s supposition is mentioned,\r\nthat _arsedine_, _arsadine_, or _orsden_, as it was variously called,\r\nwas a corruption of _arsenic_, or orpiment. The editor then ventured to\r\nhazard a different suggestion, and show that the word might be saxon,\r\nand expressive of “pigments obtained from minerals and metals.” Since\r\nthen, a note in Mr. Sharp’s remarkably interesting “Dissertation on the\r\nCountry Mysteries,” seems to favour the notion.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp says, “At the end of Gent’s ‘History of York, 1730,’ is an\r\nadvertisement of _numerous_ articles, sold by Hammond, a bookseller of\r\nthat city, and amongst the rest occurs ‘Assidue or horse-gold,’ the very\r\nnext article to which, is ‘hobby-horse-bells.’--A dealer in Dutch metal,\r\nMichael Oppenheim, 27, Mansell-street, Goodman’s-fields, thus described\r\nhimself in 1816--‘Importer of bronze powder, Dutch metal, and OR-SEDEW,’\r\nand upon inquiry respecting the last article, it proved to be that thin\r\nyellow metal, generally known by the name of _tinsel_, much used for\r\nornamenting children’s dolls, hobby-horses, and some toys, as well as\r\nmanufactured into various showy articles of dress. The word orsedew is\r\nevidently a corruption of _oripeau_ _i. e._ leaf (or skin) _gold_,\r\nafterwards _brass_. The Spaniards call it oropoel, gold-skin, and the\r\nGermans flitter-gold.”[356]\r\n\r\nThrough Mr. Sharp we have, at length, attained to a knowledge of this\r\nsubstance as the true _arsedine_ of our forefathers, and the _asidew_ of\r\nthe Sheffield merry-makers at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·57.\r\n\r\n  [351] I speak advisedly. As a town, Sheffield, the place here referred\r\n  to, is larger and more populous than Leeds. In 1821 it contained with\r\n  its suburbs, but without including either out-hamlets, or the country\r\n  part of the parish, at least 58,000 inhabitants;--Leeds no more than\r\n  48,000.\r\n\r\n  [352] When the period for which an apprentice is bound (seven years)\r\n  expires, his “loosing” is held by himself, and shopmates. Then are\r\n  these steel bells made to jangle all day. At night the loosing is\r\n  farther celebrated by a supper and booze. The parochial ringers\r\n  frequently attend festivities with a set of hand-bells, which, in the\r\n  estimation of their auditors, they make “discourse most eloquent\r\n  music.”\r\n\r\n  [353] Asidew.

He was born at Tunsted, in the\r\nparish of Wormhill, Derbyshire, in 1716, where he contributed to support\r\nhis parents’ family till he was nearly seventeen years of age, when he\r\nbound himself apprentice to a wheelwright named Bennet, near\r\nMacclesfield, in Cheshire. In the early period of his apprenticeship, he\r\nperformed several parts of the business without instruction, and so\r\nsatisfied the millers, that he was always consulted in preference to his\r\nmaster, and before the expiration of his servitude, when Mr. Bennet, by\r\nhis age and infirmities, became unable to work, he carried on the\r\nbusiness, and provided a comfortable subsistence for the old man and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Bennet was employed in constructing an engine\r\npaper-mill, the first of the kind that had been attempted in these\r\nparts; but, as he was likely to fail in the execution of it, Mr.\r\nBrindley, without communicating his design, set out on Saturday evening\r\nafter the business of the day was finished, and having inspected the\r\nwork, returned home on Monday morning, after a journey of fifty miles,\r\ninformed his master of its defects, and completed the engine to the\r\nentire satisfaction of the proprietors. He afterwards engaged in the\r\nmill-wright business on his own account. The fame of his inventions in a\r\nlittle while spread far beyond his own neighbourhood. In 1752, he was\r\nemployed to erect a curious water-engine at Clifton, in Lancashire, for\r\nthe purpose of draining coal-mines, which had before been performed at\r\nan enormous expense. The water for the use of this engine was conveyed\r\nfrom the river Irwell by a subterraneous channel, nearly six hundred\r\nyards long, which passed through a rock; and the wheel was fixed thirty\r\nfeet below the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1755, he constructed a new silk-mill at Congleton, in Cheshire,\r\naccording to the plan proposed by the proprietors, after the execution\r\nof it by the original undertaker had failed; and in the completion of it\r\nhe added many new and useful improvements. He introduced one contrivance\r\nfor winding the silk upon the bobbins equally, and not in wreaths; and\r\nanother for stopping, in an instant, not only the whole of this\r\nextensive system, in all its various movements, but any individual part\r\nof it at pleasure. He likewise invented machines for cutting the tooth\r\nand pinion wheels of the different engines, in a manner that produced a\r\ngreat saving of time, labour, and expense. He also introduced into the\r\nmills, used at the potteries in Staffordshire for grinding flintstones,\r\nseveral valuable additions, which greatly facilitated the operation.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, he constructed a steam-engine at Newcastle-under-Line, upon a\r\nnew plan. The boiler was made with brick and stone, instead of iron\r\nplates, and the water was heated by fire-places, so constructed as to\r\nsave the consumption of fuel. He also introduced cylinders of wood\r\ninstead of those of iron, and substituted wood for iron in the chains\r\nwhich worked at the end of the beam. But from these and similar\r\ncontrivances for the improvement of this useful engine, his attention\r\nwas diverted by the great national object of “inland navigation.” In\r\nplanning and executing canals his mechanical genius found ample scope\r\nfor exercise, and formed a sort of distinguishing era in the history of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nEnvy and prejudice raised a variety of obstacles to the accomplishment\r\nof his designs and undertakings; and if he had not been liberally and\r\npowerfully protected by the duke of Bridgwater, his triumph over the\r\nopposition with which he encountered must have been considerably\r\nobstructed. The duke possessed an estate at Worsley, about seven miles\r\nfrom Manchester, rich in mines of coal, from which he derived little or\r\nno advantage, on account of the expense attending the conveyance by land\r\ncarriage to a suitable market. A canal from Worsley to Manchester, Mr.\r\nBrindley declared to be practicable. His grace obtained an act for that\r\npurpose; and Brindley was employed in the conduct and execution of this,\r\nthe first undertaking of the kind ever attempted in England, with\r\nnavigable subterraneous tunnels and elevated aqueducts. At the\r\ncommencement of the business it was determined, that the level of the\r\nwater should be preserved without the usual obstruction of locks, and to\r\ncarry the canal over rivers and deep vallies. It was not easy to obtain\r\na sufficient supply of water for completing the navigation, but\r\nBrindley, furnished with ample resources, persevered, and conquered all\r\nthe embarrassments, occasioned by the nature of the undertaking, and by\r\nthe passions and prejudices of individuals. Having completed the canal\r\nas far as Barton, where the river Irwell is navigable for large vessels,\r\nhe proposed to carry it over that river by an aqueduct thirty-nine feet\r\nabove the surface of the water. This was considered as a chimerical and\r\nextravagant project; and an eminent engineer said, “I have often heard\r\nof castles in the air, but never before was shown where any of them were\r\nto be erected.” The duke of Bridgwater, confiding in the judgment of\r\nBrindley, empowered him to prosecute the work; and in about ten months\r\nthe aqueduct was completed. This astonishing work commenced in\r\nSeptember, 1760, and the first boat sailed over it the 17th of July,\r\n1761. The canal was then extended to Manchester, where Mr. Brindley’s\r\ningenuity in diminishing labour by mechanical contrivances, was\r\nexhibited in a machine for landing coals upon the top of a hill.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Bridgwater extended his views to Liverpool; and obtained, in\r\n1762, an act of parliament for branching his canal to the tide-way in\r\nthe Mersey. This part is carried over the river Mersey and Bollan, and\r\nover many wide and deep vallies. Over the vallies it is conducted\r\nwithout a single lock; and across the valley at Stretford, through which\r\nthe Mersey runs, a mound of earth, raised for preserving the water,\r\nextends for nearly a mile. In the execution of every part of the\r\nnavigation, Mr. Brindley displayed singular skill and ingenuity; and in\r\norder to facilitate his purpose, he produced many valuable machines. His\r\neconomy and forecast are peculiarly discernible in the stops, or\r\nflood-gates, fixed in the canal, where it is above the level of the\r\nland. They are so constructed, that if any of the banks should give way\r\nand occasion a current, the adjoining gates will rise merely by that\r\nmotion, and prevent any other part of the water from escaping than that\r\nwhich is near the breach between the two gates.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of the duke of Bridgwater’s undertakings, a\r\nsubscription was entered into by a number of gentlemen and manufacturers\r\nin Staffordshire, for constructing a canal through that county. In 1766,\r\nthis canal, “The Grand Trunk Navigation,” was begun; and it was\r\nconducted with spirit and success, under the direction of Brindley, as\r\nlong as he lived.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Brindley constructed a canal from the Grand Trunk, near\r\nHaywood, in Staffordshire, to the river Severn near Bewdley, connecting\r\nBristol with Liverpool and Hull. This canal, about forty-six miles in\r\nlength, was completed in 1772. His next undertaking was a canal from\r\nBirmingham, which should unite with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire\r\ncanal near Wolverhampton. It is twenty six miles in length, and was\r\nfinished in about three years. To avoid the inconvenience of locks, and\r\nfor the more effectual supply of the canal with water, he advised a\r\ntunnel at Smethwick; his advice was disregarded; and the managers were\r\nafterwards under the necessity of erecting two steam engines. He\r\nexecuted the canal from Droitwich to the Severn, for the conveyance of\r\nsalt and coals; and planned the Coventry navigation, which was for some\r\ntime under his direction; but a dispute arising, he resigned his office.\r\nSome short time before his death, he began the Oxfordshire canal, which,\r\nuniting with the Coventry canal, serves as a continuation of the Grand\r\nTrunk navigation to Oxford, and thence by the Thames to London.\r\n\r\nMr. Brindley’s last undertaking was the canal from Chesterfield to the\r\nriver Trent at Stockwith. He surveyed and planned the whole, and\r\nexecuted some miles of the navigation, which was finished five years\r\nafter his death by his brother-in-law, Mr. Henshall, in 1777. Such was\r\nMr. Brindley’s established reputation, that few works of this kind were\r\nundertaken without his advice. They are too numerous to be\r\nparticularized, but it may be added that he gave the corporation of\r\nLiverpool a plan for clearing their docks of mud, which has been\r\npractised with success; and proposed a method, which has also succeeded,\r\nof building walls against the sea without mortar. The last of his\r\ninventions was an improved machine for drawing water out of mines, by a\r\nlosing and gaining bucket, which he afterwards employed with advantage\r\nin raising coals.\r\n\r\nWhen difficulties occurred in the execution of any of Mr. Brindley’s\r\nworks, he had no recourse to books, or to the labours of other persons.\r\nAll his resources were in his own inventive mind. He generally retired\r\nto bed, and lay there one, two, or three days, till he had devised the\r\nexpedients which he needed for the accomplishment of his objects; he\r\nthen got up, and executed his design without any drawing or model, which\r\nhe never used, except for the satisfaction of his employers. His memory\r\nwas so tenacious, that he could remember and execute all the parts of\r\nthe most complex machine, provided he had time, in his previous survey,\r\nto settle, in his mind, the several departments, and their relations to\r\neach other. In his calculations of the powers of any machine, he\r\nperformed the requisite operation by a mental process, in a manner which\r\nnone knew but himself, and which, perhaps, he was not able to\r\ncommunicate to others. After certain intervals of consideration, he\r\nnoted down the result in figures; and then proceeded to operate upon\r\nthat result, until at length the complete solution was obtained, which\r\nwas generally right. His want of literature, indeed, compelled him to\r\ncultivate, in an extraordinary degree, the art of memory; and in order\r\nto facilitate the revival, in his mind, of those visible objects and\r\ntheir properties, to which his attention was chiefly directed, he\r\nsecluded himself from the external impressions of other objects, in the\r\nsolitude of his bed.\r\n\r\nIncessant attention to important and interesting objects, precluded Mr.\r\nBrindley from any of the ordinary amusements of life, and indeed,\r\nprevented his deriving from them any pleasure. He was once prevailed\r\nupon by his friends in London to see a play, but he found his ideas so\r\nmuch disturbed, and his mind rendered so unfit for business, as to\r\ninduce him to declare, that he would not on any account go to another.\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that by indulging an occasional\r\nrelaxation, remitting his application, and varying his pursuits, his\r\nlife might have been prolonged. The multiplicity of his engagements, and\r\nthe constant attention which he bestowed on them, brought on a hectic\r\nfever, which continued, with little or no intermission, for some years,\r\nand at last terminated his useful and honourable career, in the 56th\r\nyear of age. He was buried at New Chapel, in the same county.\r\n\r\nSuch was the enthusiasm with which this extraordinary man engaged in all\r\nschemes of inland navigation, that he seemed to regard all rivers with\r\ncontempt, when compared with canals. It is said, that in an examination\r\nbefore the house of commons, when he was asked for what purpose he\r\napprehended rivers were created, he replied, after some deliberation,\r\n“to feed navigable canals.” Those who knew him well, highly respected\r\nhim “for the uniform and unshaken integrity of his conduct; for his\r\nsteady attachment to the interest of the community; for the vast compass\r\nof his understanding, which seemed to have a natural affinity with all\r\ngrand objects; and, likewise, for many noble and beneficial designs,\r\nconstantly generating in his mind, and which the multiplicity of his\r\nengagements, and the shortness of his life, prevented him from bringing\r\nto maturity.”[357]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 55·50.\r\n\r\n  [357] Rees’s Cyclopædia.

Brit.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 28.~\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME GENEVA LYING IN STATE.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of September, 1736, when the “Gin Act,” which was passed to\r\nprevent the retailing of spirituous liquors in small quantities was\r\nabout to be enforced, it was deemed necessary to send a detachment of\r\nsixty soldiers from Kensington to protect the house of sir Joseph Jekyl,\r\nthe master of the rolls in Chancery-lane, from the violence threatened\r\nby the populace against that eminent lawyer for his endeavours in\r\nprocuring the obnoxious statute.\r\n\r\nThe keepers of the gin-shops testified their feelings by a parade of\r\nmock ceremonies for “_Madame Geneva lying-in-state_,” which created a\r\nmob about their shops, and the justices thought proper to commit some of\r\nthe chief mourners to prison. On this occasion, the signs of the\r\npunch-houses were put in mourning; and lest others should express the\r\nbitterness of their hearts by committing violences, the horse and\r\nfoot-guards and trained bands were ordered to be properly stationed.\r\nMany of the distillers, instead of spending their time in empty\r\nlamentations, betook themselves to other branches of industry. Some to\r\nthe brewing trade, which raised the price of barley and hops; some took\r\ntaverns in the universities, which nobody could do before the “Gin Act,”\r\nwithout leave of the vice-chancellor; others set up apothecaries’ shops.\r\nThe only persons who took out fifty pound licenses were one Gordon, Mr.\r\nAshley of the London punch-house, and one more. Gordon, a punch-seller\r\nin the Strand, devised a new punch made of strong Madeira wine, and\r\ncalled _Sangre_.[358]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTY CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nIt may be hoped that our readers who live in the apple districts will\r\ncommunicate the usages of their neighbourhoods to the _Every-Day Book_.\r\nFor the present we must thank “an old correspondent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIGGLING.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--The more I read of your _Every-Day Book_, the stronger my\r\nrecollection returns to my boyhood days. There is not a season wherein I\r\nfelt greater delight than during the gathering in of the orchards’\r\nproduce. The cider barrels cleaned and aired from the cellar--the\r\ncider-mill ready--the baskets and press, the vats, the horse-hair\r\ncloths, and the loft, fitted for the process and completion of making\r\ncider--the busy people according to Philips, seek--\r\n\r\n    The pippin, burnish’d o’er with gold,\r\n    Of sweetest honey’d taste, the fair permain,\r\n    Temper’d like comeliest nymph, with white and red.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Let every tree in every garden own,\r\n    The redstreak as supreme, whose pulpous fruit,\r\n    With gold irradiate, and vermillion shines.\r\n    Hail Herefordian plant! that dost disdain\r\n    All other fields.\r\n\r\nThe Herefordshire cider is so exquisite, that when the earl of\r\nManchester was ambassador in France, he is said frequently to have\r\npassed this beverage on their nobility for a delicious wine.\r\n\r\nLeasing in the corn-fields after the sheaves are borne to the garner, is\r\nperformed by villagers of all ages, that are justly entitled to glean,\r\nlike ants, the little store against a rainy day. But after the orchard\r\nis cleared, (and how delightful a shower--the shaking the Newton\r\ninstructing apples down,) the village (not chimney-sweepers) climbing\r\nboys collect in a possé, and with poles and bags, go into the orchard\r\nand commence _griggling_.\r\n\r\nThe small apples are called _griggles_. These, the farmers leave pretty\r\nabundantly on the trees, with an understanding that the urchins will\r\nhave mercy on the boughs, which, if left entirely bare, would suffer.\r\nSuspended like monkeys, the best climbers are the ring-leaders; and less\r\nboys pick up and point out where an apple still remains. After the trees\r\nare cleared, a loud huzza crowns the exertion; and though a little\r\nbickering as to the quality and quantity ensues, they separate with\r\ntheir portion, praising or blaming the owner, proportionate to their\r\nsuccess. If he requests it, which is often the case before they depart,\r\nthe head boy stands before the house, and uncovered, he recites the\r\nwell-known fable in the “Universal Spelling Book”--“A rude boy\r\n_stealing_ apples.”--Then the hostess, or her daughter, brings a large\r\njug of cider and a slice of bread and cheese, or twopence, to the great\r\npleasure of the laughing recipients of such generous bounty.\r\n\r\nDown to the present month the custom of _griggling_ is continued with\r\nvariation in the western hamlets, though innovation, which is the abuse\r\nof privilege, has prevented many orchard-owners allowing the boys their\r\n_griggling_ perambulations.\r\n\r\n  With much respect, I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  P.---- _T.----_\r\n\r\n  *, *, P.\r\n\r\n  _September 20, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 53·37.\r\n\r\n  [358] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~September 29.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MICHAEL.\r\n\r\nIn the former volume, there are particulars of St. Michael, at col. 500,\r\n629, and 1325. To the latter article, there is a print of this\r\narchangel, with six others of his order: on the present page he appears\r\nwith other characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~St Michael.~]\r\n\r\nThis print from a large engraving on copper, by one of the Caracci\r\nfamily in 1582, after a picture by Lorenzo Sabbatini of Bologna,\r\nrepresents the holy family, and St. John, and St. Michael standing on\r\nthe devil, and presenting souls to the infant Jesus from a pair of\r\nscales. The artist has adopted this mode to convey a notion of the\r\narchangel, in quality of his office, as chief of the guardian angels,\r\nand judge of the claims of departed spirits. In vol. i. p. 630, there\r\nare notices relative to St. Michael in this capacity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe church of Notre Dame, at Paris, rebuilt by “devout king Robert,” was\r\nconspicuously honoured by a statue of the chief of the angelic\r\nhierarchy, _with his scales_. “On the top, and pinnacle before the said\r\nchurch,” says Favine, “is yet to be seene the image of the arch-angell\r\n_St. Michael_, the tutelaric angell, and guardian of the most christian\r\nmonarchie of France, ensculptured after the antique forme, holding a\r\n_ballance_ in the one hand, and a crosse in the other; on his head, and\r\ntoppe of his wings, are fixed and cramponned strong pikes of iron to\r\nkeepe the birds from pearching thereon.”\r\n\r\nFavine proceeds to mention a popular error concerning these “pikes of\r\niron,” to defend the statue from the birds. “The ignorant vulgar\r\nconceived that this was a crowne of eares of corne, and thought it to be\r\nthe idole of the goddesse _Ceres_.” He says this is “a matter wherein\r\nthey are much deceived; for Isis and Ceres being but one and the same,\r\nher temple was at S. Ceour and S. Germain des Prez.”[359]\r\n\r\nLouis XI. instituted an order in honour of St. Michael, the arch-angel,\r\non occasion of an alleged apparition of the saint on the bridge at\r\nOrleans, when that city was besieged by the English in 1428.\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe present month can scarcely be better closed than with some exquisite\r\nstanzas from the delightful introduction to the “_Forest Minstrel_ and\r\nother Poems, by William and Mary Howitt.” Mr. Howitt speaks of his\r\n“lightly caroll’d lays,” as--\r\n\r\n      ------ never, surely, otherwise esteem’d\r\n      Than a bird’s song, that, fill’d with sweet amaze\r\n    At the bright opening of the young, green spring,\r\n    Pours out its simple joy in instant warbling.\r\n\r\n    For never yet was mine the proud intent\r\n      To give the olden harp a thrilling sound,\r\n    Like those great spirits who of late have sent\r\n      Their wizard tones abroad, and all around\r\n    This wond’rous world have wander’d; and have spent,\r\n      In court and camp, on bann’d and holy ground,\r\n    Their gleaning glances; and, in hall and bower,\r\n    Have learn’d of mortal life the passions and the power:\r\n\r\n    Eyeing the masters of this busy earth,\r\n      In all the changes of ambition’s toil,\r\n    From the first struggles of their glory’s birth,\r\n      Till robed in power--till wearied with the spoil\r\n    Of slaughter’d realms, and dealing woe and dearth\r\n      To miserable men--and then the foil\r\n    To this great scene, the vengeance, and the frown\r\n    With which some mightier hand has pull’d those troublers down:\r\n\r\n    Eyeing the passages of gentler life,\r\n      And different persons, of far different scenes;\r\n    The boy, the beau--the damsel, and the wife--\r\n      Life’s lowly loves--the loves of kings and queens;\r\n    Each thing that binds us, and each thing that weans\r\n      Us from this state, with pains and pleasures rife;\r\n    The wooings, winnings, weddings, and disdainings\r\n    Of changeful men, their fondness and their feignings:\r\n\r\n    And then have brought us home strange sights and sounds\r\n      From distant lands, of dark and awful deeds;\r\n    And fair and dreadful spirits; and gay rounds\r\n      Of mirth and music; and then mourning weeds;\r\n    And tale of hapless love that sweetly wounds\r\n      The gentle heart, and its deep fondness feeds;\r\n    Lapping it up in dreams of sad delight\r\n    From its own weary thoughts, in visions wild and bright:--\r\n\r\n    Oh! never yet to me the power or will\r\n      To match these mighty sorcerers of the soul\r\n    Was given; but on the bosom, lone and still,\r\n      Of nature cast, I early wont to stroll\r\n    Through wood and wild, o’er forest, rock, and hill,\r\n      Companionless; without a wish or goal,\r\n    Save to discover every shape and voice\r\n    Of living thing that there did fearlessly rejoice.\r\n\r\n    And every day that boyish fancy grew;\r\n      And every day those lonely scenes became\r\n    Dearer and dearer, and with objects new,\r\n      All sweet and peaceful, fed the young spirit’s flame\r\n    Then rose each silent woodland to the view,\r\n      A glorious theatre of joy! then came\r\n    Each sound a burst of music on the air,\r\n    That sank into the soul to live for ever there!\r\n\r\n    Oh, days of glory! when the young soul drank\r\n      Delicious wonderment through every sense!\r\n    And every tone and tint of beauty sank\r\n      Into a heart that ask’d not how, or whence\r\n    Came the dear influence; from the dreary blank\r\n      Of nothingness sprang forth to an existence\r\n    Thrilling and wond’rous; to enjoy--enjoy\r\n    The new and glorious blessing--was its sole employ.\r\n\r\n    To roam abroad amidst the mists, and dews,\r\n      And brightness of the early morning sky,\r\n    When rose and hawthorn leaves wore tenderest hues:\r\n      To watch the mother linnet’s stedfast eye,\r\n    Seated upon her nest; or wondering muse\r\n      On her eggs’s spots, and bright and delicate dye;\r\n    To peep into the magpie’s thorny hall,\r\n    Or wren’s green cone in some hoar mossy wall;\r\n\r\n    To hear of pealing bells the distant charm,\r\n      As slow I wended down some lonely dale,\r\n    Past many a bleating flock, and many a farm\r\n      And solitary hall; and in the vale\r\n    To meet of eager hinds a hurrying swarm,\r\n      With staves and terriers hastening to assail\r\n    Polecat, or badger, in their secret dens,\r\n    Or otter lurking in the deep and reedy fens\r\n\r\n    To pass through villages, and catch the hum\r\n      Forth bursting from some antiquated school,\r\n    Endow’d long since by some old knight, whose tomb\r\n      Stood in the church just by; to mark the dool\r\n    Of light-hair’d lads that inly rued their doom,\r\n      Prison’d in that old place, that with the tool,\r\n    Stick-knife or nail, of many a sly offender,\r\n    Was carved and figured over, wall, and desk, and window;\r\n\r\n    To meet in green lanes happy infant bands,\r\n      Full of health’s luxury, sauntering and singing,\r\n    A childish, wordless melody; with hands\r\n      Cowslips, and wind-flowers, and green brook-lime bringing;\r\n    Or weaving caps of rushes; or with wands\r\n      Guiding their mimic teams; or gaily swinging\r\n    On some low sweeping bough, and clinging all\r\n    One to the other fast, till, laughing, down they fall;\r\n\r\n    To sit down by some solitary man,\r\n      Hoary with years, and with a sage’s look,\r\n    In some wild dell where purest waters ran,\r\n      And see him draw forth his black-letter book,\r\n    Wond’ring, and wond’ring more, as he began,\r\n      On it, and then on many an herb to look,\r\n    That he had wander’d wearily and wide,\r\n    To pluck from jutting rocks, and woods, and mountain side;\r\n\r\n    And then, as he would wash his healing roots\r\n      In the clear stream, that ever went singing on,\r\n    Through banks o’erhung with herbs and flowery shoots,\r\n      Leaning as if they loved its gentle tune,\r\n    To hear him tell of many a plant that suits\r\n      Fresh wound, or fever’d frame; and of the moon\r\n    Shedding o’er weed and wort her healing power,\r\n    For gifted wights to cull in her ascendant hour;\r\n\r\n    To lie abroad on nature’s lonely breast,\r\n      Amidst the music of a summer’s sky,\r\n    Where tall, dark pines the northern bank invest\r\n      Of a still lake; and see the long pikes lie\r\n    Basking upon the shallows; with dark crest,\r\n      And threat’ning pomp, the swan go sailing by;\r\n    And many a wild fowl on its breast that shone,\r\n    Flickering like liquid silver, in the joyous sun:\r\n\r\n    The duck, deep poring with his downward head,\r\n      Like a buoy floating on the ocean wave;\r\n    The Spanish goose, like drops of crystal, shed\r\n      The water o’er him, his rich plumes to lave;\r\n    The beautiful widgeon, springing upward, spread\r\n      His clapping wings; the heron, stalking grave,\r\n    Into the stream; the coot and water-hen\r\n    Vanish into the flood, then, far off, rise again;\r\n\r\n    And when warm summer’s holiday was o’er,\r\n      And the bright acorns patter’d from the trees\r\n    When fires were made, and closed was every door,\r\n      And winds were loud, or else a chilling breeze\r\n    Came comfortless, driving cold fogs before:\r\n      On dismal, shivering evenings, such as these,\r\n    To pass by cottage windows, and to see,\r\n    Round a bright hearth, sweet faces shining happily;\r\n\r\n    These were the days of boyhood! Oh! such days\r\n      Shall never, never more return again--\r\n    When the fresh heart, all witless of the ways,\r\n      The sickening, sordid, selfish ways of men,\r\n    Danced in creation’s pure and placid blaze,\r\n      Making an Eden of the loneliest glen!\r\n    Darkness has follow’d fast, and few have been\r\n    The rays of sunlight cast upon life’s dreary scene.\r\n\r\n    For years of lonely thought, in morning-tide\r\n      Of life, will make a spirit all unfit\r\n    To brook of men the waywardness and pride;\r\n      Too proud itself to woo, or to submit;\r\n    Scorning, as vile, what all adore beside,\r\n      And deeming only glorious the soul lit\r\n    With the pure flame of knowledge, and the eye\r\n    Filled with the gentle love of the bright earth and sky.\r\n\r\n    Fancy’s spoil’d child will ever surely be\r\n      A thing of nothing in the worldly throng:\r\n    Wrapp’d up in dreams that they can never see;\r\n      Listening to fairy harp, or spirit’s song,\r\n    Where all to them is stillest vacancy:\r\n      For ever seeking, as he glides along,\r\n    Some kindred heart, that feels as he has felt,\r\n    And can read each thought that with him long has dwelt.\r\n\r\n    But place him midst creation!--let him stand\r\n      Where wave and mountain revel in his sight,\r\n    Then shall his soul triumphantly expand,\r\n      With gathering power, and majesty, and light!\r\n    The world beneath him is the temple plann’d\r\n      For him to worship in; and, pure and bright,\r\n    Heaven’s vault above, the proud eternal dome\r\n    Of his Almighty Sire, and his own future home!\r\n\r\n    With such inspiring fancies, mortal pride\r\n      Shrinks into nothing; and all mortal things\r\n    He casts, as weeds cast by the ocean tide,\r\n      From its embraces; the world’s scorn he flings\r\n    Back on itself, disdaining to divide,\r\n      With its low cares, that sensitive spirit that brings\r\n    Home to his breast all nature’s light and glee,\r\n    Holding with sunshine, clouds, and gales, unearthly revelry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 54·17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCTOBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then, for “October Month,” they put\r\n    A rude illuminated cut--\r\n    Reaching ripe grapes from off the vine,\r\n    Or pressing them, or tunning wine;\r\n    Or, something to denote that there\r\n    Was vintage at this time of year.\r\n\r\nWe have “hopes and fears” for the year at all seasons, as we have for\r\nourselves “in infancy” and throughout life. After the joyousness of\r\nsummer comes the season of foreboding, for “the year has reached its\r\ngrand climacteric, and is fast falling ‘into the sere, the yellow leaf.’\r\nEvery day a flower drops from out the wreath that binds its brow--not to\r\nbe renewed. Every hour the sun looks more and more askance upon it, and\r\nthe winds, those summer flatterers, come to it less fawningly. Every\r\nbreath shakes down showers of its leafy attire, leaving it gradually\r\nbarer and barer, for the blasts of winter to blow through it. Every\r\nmorning and evening takes away from it a portion of that light which\r\ngives beauty to its life, and chills it more and more into that torpor\r\nwhich at length constitutes its temporary death. And yet October is\r\nbeautiful still, no less ‘for what it gives than what it takes away;’\r\nand even for what it gives during the very act of taking away.--The\r\nwhole year cannot produce a sight fraught with more rich and harmonious\r\nbeauty than that which the woods and groves present during this month,\r\nnotwithstanding, or rather in consequence of, the daily decay of their\r\nsummer attire; and at no other season can any given spot of landscape be\r\nseen to much advantage as a mere picture.--An extensive plantation of\r\nforest trees presents a variety of colours and of tints that would\r\nscarcely be considered as _natural_ in a picture, any more than many of\r\nthe sunsets of September would. Among those trees which retain their\r\ngreen hues, the fir tribe are the principal; and these, spiring up among\r\nthe deciduous ones, now differ from them no less in colour than they do\r\nin form. The alders, too, and the poplars, limes, and horse-chestnuts,\r\nare still green,--the hues of their leaves not undergoing much change as\r\nlong as they remain on the branches. Most of the other forest trees have\r\nput on each its peculiar livery; the planes and sycamores presenting\r\nevery variety of tinge, from bright yellow to brilliant red; the elms\r\nbeing, for the most part, of a rich sunny umber, varying according to\r\nthe age of the tree and the circumstances of its soil, &c.; the beeches\r\nhaving deepened into a warm glowing brown, which the young ones will\r\nretain all the winter, and till the new spring leaves push the present\r\nones off; the oaks varying from a dull dusky green to a deep russet,\r\naccording to their ages; and the Spanish chestnuts, with their noble\r\nembowering heads, glowing like clouds of gold.--As for the hedge-rows,\r\nthough they have lost nearly all their flowers, the various fruits that\r\nare spread out upon them for the winter food of the birds, make them\r\nlittle less gay than they were in spring and summer. The most\r\nconspicuous of these are the red hips of the wild rose; the dark purple\r\nbunches of the luxuriant blackberry; the brilliant scarlet and green\r\nberries of the nightshade; the wintry-looking fruit of the hawthorn; the\r\nblue sloes, covered with their soft tempting-looking bloom; the dull\r\nbunches of the woodbine; and the sparkling holly-berries.--We may also\r\nstill, by seeking for them, find a few flowers scattered about beneath\r\nthe hedge-rows, and the dry banks that skirt the woods, and even in the\r\nwoods themselves, peeping up meekly from among the crowds of newly\r\nfallen leaves. The prettiest of these is the primrose, which now blows a\r\nsecond time. But two or three of the persicaria tribe are still in\r\nflower, and also some of the goosefoots. And even the elegant and\r\nfragile heathbell, or harebell, has not yet quite disappeared; while\r\nsome of the ground flowers that have passed away have left in their\r\nplace strange evidences of their late presence; in particular, the\r\nsingular flower (if it can be called one) of the arums, or lords and\r\nladies, has changed into an upright bunch, or long cluster, of red\r\nberries, starting up from out the ground on a single stiff stem, and\r\nlooking almost like the flower of a hyacinth.--The open fields during\r\nthis month, though they are bereaved of much of their actual beauty and\r\nvariety, present sights that are as agreeable to the eye, and even more\r\nstirring to the imagination, than those which have passed away. The\r\nhusbandman is now ploughing up the arable land, and putting into it the\r\nseeds that are to produce the next year’s crops; and there are not,\r\namong rural occupations, two more pleasant to look upon than these: the\r\nlatter, in particular, is one that, while it gives perfect satisfaction\r\nto the eye as a mere picture, awakens and fills the imagination with the\r\nprospective views which it opens.--It is not till this month that we\r\nusually experience the equinoxial gales, those fatal visitations which\r\nmay now be looked upon as the immediate heralds of the coming on of\r\nwinter; as in the spring they were the sure signs of its having passed\r\naway. Bitter-sweet is it, now, to lie awake at night, and listen\r\nwilfully (as if we would not let them escape us) to the fierce howlings\r\nof the winds, each accession of which gives new vividness to the vision\r\nof some tall ship, illumined by every flash of lightning--illumined, but\r\nnot rendered _visible_--for there are no eyes within a hundred leagues\r\nto look upon it; and crowded with human beings--(not ‘souls’ only, as\r\nthe sea-phrase is, for then it were pastime--but _bodies_) every one of\r\nwhich sees, in imagination, its own grave a thousand fathom deep beneath\r\nthe dark waters that roar around, and feels itself beforehand.”[360]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WIND.\r\n\r\n      The wind has a language, I would I could learn!\r\n    Sometimes ’tis soothing, and sometimes ’tis stern,\r\n    --Sometimes it comes like a low sweet song,\r\n    And all things grow calm, as the sound floats along,\r\n    And the forest is lulled by the dreamy strain,\r\n    And slumber sinks down on the wandering main,\r\n    And its crystal arms are folded in rest,\r\n    And the tall ship sleeps on its heaving breast.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes when autumn grows yellow and sere,\r\n    And the sad clouds weep for the dying year,\r\n    It comes like a wizard, and mutters its spell,\r\n    --I would that the magical tones I might tell--\r\n    And it beckons the leaves with its viewless hand,\r\n    And they leap from their branches at its command,\r\n    And follow its footsteps with wheeling feet,\r\n    Like fairies that dance in the moonlight sweet.\r\n\r\n    Sometimes it comes in the wintry night,\r\n    And I hear the flap of its pinions of might,\r\n    And I see the flash of its withering eye,\r\n    As it looks from the thunder-cloud sailing on high,\r\n    And pauses to gather its fearful breath,\r\n    And lifts up its voice like the angel of death--\r\n    And the billows leap up when the summons they hear\r\n    And the ship flies away, as if winged with fear,\r\n    And the uncouth creatures that dwell in the deep,\r\n    Start up at the sound from their floating sleep,\r\n    And career through the water, like clouds through the night,\r\n    To share in the tumult their joy and delight,\r\n    And when the moon rises, the ship is no more,\r\n    Its joys and its sorrows are vanish’d and o’er,\r\n    And the fierce storm that slew it has faded away,\r\n    Like the dark dream that flies from the light of the day.\r\n\r\n  _The Improvisatrice._\r\n\r\n  [360] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 1.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWLESS COURT.\r\n\r\nThis is the season of holding a remarkable court, which we are\r\npleasantly introduced to by the relation of a good old writer.[361]\r\n\r\n“Ryding from Ralegh towards Rochford, I happened to haue the good\r\ncompanie of a gentleman of this countrey, who, by the way, shewed me a\r\nlittle hill, which he called the Kings Hill; and told me of a strange\r\ncustomarie court, and of long continuance, there yearely kept, the next\r\nWednesday after Michaelmas day in the night, upon the first cock crowing\r\nwithout any kinde of light, saue such as the heavens will affoard: The\r\nsteward of the court writes onely with coales, and calleth all such as\r\nare bound to appeare, with as low a voice as possiblie he may, giuing no\r\nnotice when he goeth to execute his office. Howsoever, he that gives not\r\nanswer is deeply amerced; which servile attendance (saith he) was\r\nimposed at the first vpon certaine tenants of divers mannors hereabouts,\r\nfor conspiring in this place, at such an vnseasonable time, to raise a\r\ncommotion. The title of the entrie of the court hee had in memory, and\r\nwrit it downe for me when we came to Rochford.” Fuller speaks of its\r\nrunning “in obscure barbarous rimes,” which he inserts nearly in the\r\nwords of the legal authorities who give the following account:--\r\n\r\n“~Lawless Court.~ On _Kingshill_ at _Rochford_ in _Essex_, on Wednesday\r\nmorning next, after _Michaelmas_ day, at _Cocks-crowing_, Is held a\r\nCourt, vulgarly called ‘_The Lawless Court_.’ They whisper and have no\r\nCandle, nor any Pen and Ink but a Coal; and he that ows Suit or Service,\r\nand appears not, forfeits double his rent every hour he is missing. This\r\nCourt belongs to the Honor of _Ralegh_, and to the Earl of _Warwick_;\r\nand is called ‘_Lawless_,’ because held at an unlawful or lawless hour,\r\nor _Quia dicta sine lege_.

He relates of it as follows:--\r\n\r\nTo this document are affixed thirty-six seals, all imprinted on green\r\nwax, with the exception of that of the founder, which is on red wax, and\r\nin the centre of the rest; having on its right the seal of the count de\r\nMeurs, and on its left that of Diedrich van Eyl. The insignium borne by\r\nthe knights of this order on the left side of their mantles consisted of\r\na fool embroidered in a red and silver vest, with a cap on his head,\r\nintersected harlequin-wise with red and yellow divisions, and gold bells\r\nattached, with yellow stockings and black shoes; in his right hand was a\r\ncup filled with fruits, and in his left a gold key, symbolic of the\r\naffection subsisting between the different members.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain when this order ceased, although it appears to have been\r\nin existence at the commencement of the sixteenth century, when,\r\nhowever, its pristine spirit had become totally extinct. The latest\r\nmention that has hitherto been found of it occurs in some verses\r\nprefixed by Onofrius Brand to the German translation of his father\r\nSebastian Brand’s celebrated “_Navis Stultifera Mortalium_,” by the\r\nlearned Dr. Geiler von Kaisersberg, which was published at Strasburg in\r\nthe year 1520.\r\n\r\nTwo-fold was the purpose of the noble founders of this order; to relieve\r\nthe wants and alleviate the miseries of their suffering\r\nfellow-creatures; and to banish ennui during the numerous festivals\r\nobserved in those ages, when the unceasing routine of disports and\r\nrecreations, which modern refinement has invented in the present, were\r\nunknown. During the period of its meeting, which took place annually,\r\nand lasted seven days, all distinctions of rank were laid aside, and the\r\nmost cordial equality reigned throughout. Each had his particular part\r\nallotted to him on those occasions, and those who supported their\r\ncharacters in the ablest manner, contributed most to the conviviality\r\nand gaiety of the meeting. Indeed we cannot but be strongly prepossessed\r\nin its favour, when we recur to the excellent regulations which\r\naccompanied its institution, and were admirably calculated to preserve\r\nit, at least for a great length of time, from degenerating into\r\nabsurdity and extravagance.\r\n\r\nWe must not confound this laudable establishment with the vulgar and\r\nabsurd practices which, till of late years, existed in many places under\r\nthe names of feasts of fools and of the ass, &c. These were only\r\nnational festivals, intended for the occasional diversion, or, as in\r\nthose days they were termed, rites to promote the pious edification of\r\nthe lower classes, which, “not unfrequently introduced by a superstition\r\nof the lowest and most illiberal species,” soon became objects of\r\ndepravity and unbridled licentiousness. Of a totally different nature\r\nalso, and analagous only in quaintness of appellation, were the\r\nsocieties established by men of letters in various parts of Italy, such\r\nas the society of the “Insensáte,” at Perugia, of the “Stravaganti,” at\r\nPisa, and the “Eteróclyti,” at Pesaro. Nor can I allow myself to pass\r\nover in silence on the present occasion the order or society of Fools,\r\notherwise denominated “Respublica Binepsis,” which was founded towards\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century by some Polish noblemen, and took\r\nits name from the estate of one Psomka, the principal instigator, near\r\nLeublin. Its form was modelled after that of the constitution of Poland;\r\nlike this, too, it had its king, its council, its chamberlain, its\r\nmaster of the hunt, and various other offices. Whoever made himself\r\nridiculous by any singular and foolish propensity, on him was conferred\r\nan appointment befitting it. Thus he, who carried his partiality to the\r\ncanine species to a ridiculous extreme, was created master of the hunt;\r\nwhilst another, who constantly boasted of his valorous achievements, was\r\nraised to the dignity of field marshal. No one dared to refuse the\r\nacceptance of such a vocation, unless he wished to become a still\r\ngreater object of ridicule and animadversion than before. This order\r\nsoon experienced so rapid an increase of numbers that there were few at\r\ncourt who were not members of it. At the same time it was expressly\r\nforbidden that any lampooner should be introduced amongst them. The\r\navowed object of this institution was to prevent the rising generation\r\nfrom the adoption of bad habits and licentious manners; and ridiculous\r\nas was its outward form, is not its design at least entitled to our\r\nesteem and veneration?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patent of Creation of the Order of Fools._\r\n\r\n“We all, who have hereunto affixed our seals, make known unto all men,\r\nand declare, that after full and mature consideration, both on our own\r\nbehalf and on account of the singular goodwill and friendship which we\r\nall bear, and will continue to bear towards one another, we have\r\ninstituted a society of fools, according to the form and manner hereunto\r\nsubjoined:--\r\n\r\n“Be it therefore known, that each member shall wear a fool, either made\r\nof silver, or embroidered, on his coat. And such member as shall not\r\ndaily wear this fool, him shall and may any one of us, as often as he\r\nshall see it, punish with a mulct of three old great tournois, (livres\r\ntournois, about four-pence halfpenny,) which three tournois shall be\r\nappropriated to the relief of the poor in the Lord!\r\n\r\n“Further, will we fools yearly meet, and hold a conventicle and court,\r\nand assemble ourselves, to wit at Cleves, every year on the Sunday after\r\nMichaelmas-day; and no one of us shall depart out of the city, nor mount\r\nhis horse to quit the place where we may be met together, without\r\nprevious notice, and his having defrayed that part of the expenses of\r\nthe court which he is bound to bear. And none of us shall remain away on\r\nany pretence or for any other reason whatsoever than this, namely, that\r\nhe is labouring under very great infirmity; excepting moreover those\r\nonly who may be in a foreign country, and at six days’ journey from\r\ntheir customary place of residence. If it should happen that any one of\r\nthe society is at enmity with another, then must the whole society use\r\ntheir utmost endeavours to adjust their differences and reconcile them;\r\nand such members and all their abettors shall be excluded from appearing\r\nat the court on the Friday morning when it commences its sitting at\r\nsun-rise, until it breaks up on the same Friday at sun-set.\r\n\r\n“And, we will further, at the royal court yearly elect one of the\r\nmembers to be king of our society, and six to be counsellors; which king\r\nwith his six counsellors shall regulate and settle all the concerns of\r\nthe society, and in particular appoint and fix the court of the ensuing\r\nyear; they shall also procure, and cause to be procured, all things\r\nnecessary for the said court, of which they shall keep an exact account.\r\nThese expenses shall be alike both to knights and squires, and a third\r\npart more shall fall upon the lords than upon the knights and squires;\r\nbut the counts shall be subject to a third part more than the lords.\r\n\r\n“And early on the Tuesday morning (during the period of the court’s\r\nsitting) all of us members shall go to the church of the Holy Virgin at\r\nCleves, to pray for the repose of all those of the society who may have\r\ndied; and there shall each bring his separate offering.\r\n\r\n“And each of us has mutually pledged his good faith, and solemnly\r\nengaged to fulfil faithfully, undeviatingly, and inviolably, all things\r\nwhich are above enumerated, &c.\r\n\r\n“Done at Cleves, 1381, on the day of St. Cunibert.”\r\n\r\n  H.

He\r\nfractured his scull, and died miserably; three others were much hurt,\r\nbut recovered. Some of the audience swooned, and the whole were in great\r\nconfusion upon this sad accident.[364]\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTEBANKS AND MR. MERRIMAN.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nLittle inferior to Mr. Punch, Mr. Merriman has stood eminently high at\r\nfairs, figured in market-places, and scarcely a village green in\r\nEngland, that has not felt the force of his irresistible appeals. He\r\ndoes not often approach the over-grown metropolis; his success here is\r\nless certain, and the few patrons that remain, love to feast their eyes\r\nand risible faculties without sparing a modicum from their pockets: the\r\ndroll simpleton might crack his jokes without finding the kernel--cash.\r\n\r\nA company of mountebanks, however, appeared on a green, north of White\r\nConduit-house, several evenings last week. On Saturday the performance\r\ncommenced at five o’clock in the afternoon. The performers consisted of\r\nthe master, a short, middle aged person, with a florid complexion,\r\ndressed in decent half mourning. He possessed a sound pair of lungs,\r\nfair eloquence, and a good portion of colloquial ability. By the\r\nassistance of a little whip he kept in order a large ring, formed of\r\nboys, girls, and grown persons of both sexes. His eye, gray as a\r\nfalcon’s, watched the reception he received, and seemed to communicate\r\nwith his “_mind’s_ eye,” as to his subscribers. The rosy-faced maid\r\nservants, glad of the opportunity of gazing at the exhibitors, were\r\nrejoiced by the pretence of holding the “nursery treasures” to see all\r\nthat could be seen. Here the calculator looked for patronage and\r\nencouragement. “Mr. Merriman,” a young man with his face and clothes\r\nduly coloured, _à la Grimaldi_, raised laughter by his quaint retorts,\r\nby attempts at tumbling to prove he could tumble well, and by drilling\r\nwith a bugle-horn a dozen volunteer boys in many whimsical exercises,\r\ntruly marvellous to simpering misses and their companions. The next\r\nperformer was a short man with sharp features, sunburnt face, and shrill\r\ngoat-like voice:--he tumbled in a clever, but, I think, dangerous\r\nmanner. Then Mr. Merriman’s “imitations” followed; not to say any thing\r\nof those inimitable imitators, Mathews, Reeve, and Yates, he suited his\r\naudience to the very echo of the surrounding skeletons in brick and\r\nmortar. The tumbler then reposed by putting a loose coat over his\r\nparty-coloured habit, and playing a pandean-pipe while “Mr. Merriman”\r\nsat on a piece of carpet spread on the ground, and tossed four gilt\r\nballs in the air at the same time, to the variations of the music. A\r\ndrum was beat by a woman about forty, with a tiara on her head, who\r\nafterwards left the beating art and mounting the slack-wire, which was\r\nsupported by three sticks, coned at each end to a triangle; she danced\r\nand vaulted _à la Gouffe_. A table was put on the wire, which she\r\nbalanced, and bore a glass full of liquor on the rim as she twirled it\r\non her finger. This was the acmè of the display. Tickets at one shilling\r\neach were now handed round with earnestness and much promise, for a\r\nlottery of prizes, consisting of teapots, waiters, printed calico, and\r\ntwo sovereigns thrown on the grass instead of a sheep. These temptations\r\nheld out to many a Saturday night labourer the hope of increasing his\r\nweek’s wages. The “conductor” of his company no doubt profited by the\r\nexperience of which he was possessed. Many tickets were sold;\r\nexpectation breathed--fancy pictured a teapot--or some token of\r\nfortune’s performance. The decision made, the die cast, now the laughing\r\nwinner walked hurriedly away, hugging his prize, while the losers hid\r\ntheir chagrin, and were quietly dispersed by the “blank” influence, with\r\nsecret wishes that their money was in their pockets again.\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect upon this kind of amusement for the labouring classes, I\r\nsee nothing to prevent its occasional appearance. The wit scattered\r\nabout, though in a blundering way, is often smart.\r\n\r\nIn spite of decorum, of my better instruction in gentility, and\r\nChesterfield’s axioms, I love to stand and shake my human system, if it\r\nbe only to remind me of past observation, and to see the children so\r\nhappy, who ring out music, in every responsive applause of the tricks so\r\nplausibly represented to their view. While “Mr. Merriman” does not\r\ninvade the peace of society, I hope he will be allowed his precarious\r\nreign, as he promised “that he would forfeit fifty guineas if he came\r\ninto the parish again at least for a twelvemonth.”\r\n\r\nIt is within my remembrance when former mountebanks distributed packets\r\ninstead of blanks, containing nostrums against toothache, corns,\r\nbunions, warts, witchcraft and the ague. Doctor Bolus strutted and\r\nfretted his hour upon the stage, and gave as much wit for sixpence as\r\nkept the village alehouse in a roar for many weeks. But, I suppose, the\r\nmountebank profession, like every other, feels the changes of the times,\r\nand retrenchment cries,--\r\n\r\n    “Ubi vos requiram, cum dies advenerit?”\r\n\r\n  *, *, P.\r\n\r\n  _September 29, 1826._\r\n\r\nPlease to make the following correction, page 1270; for “_he_ shaking,”\r\nread “_the_ shaking.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 52·85.\r\n\r\n  [361] Fuller.\r\n\r\n  [362] Cowel.

It was bought\r\nMichaelmas, 1693, at Uxbridge, was never sick nor lame all the time, and\r\nwithin the fifteen years preceding, drew his owner and another in a\r\nchaise, fifty miles in one day.[367]\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS AND MISTS.\r\n\r\nIt is observed that--“Among the miscellaneous events of October, one of\r\nthe most striking and curious is the interchange which seems to take\r\nplace between our country, and the more northern as well as the more\r\nsouthern ones, in regard to the birds. The swallow tribe now all quit\r\nus: the swift disappeared wholly, more than a month ago; and now the\r\nhouse swallow, house martin, and bank or sand martin, after congregating\r\nfor awhile in vast flocks about the banks of rivers and other waters,\r\nare seen no more as general frequenters of the air. If one or two are\r\nseen during the warm days that sometimes occur for the next two or three\r\nweeks, they are to be looked upon as strangers and wanderers; and the\r\nsight of them, which has hitherto been so pleasant, becomes altogether\r\ndifferent in its effect: it gives one a feeling of desolateness, such as\r\nwe experience on meeting a poor shivering lascar in our winter\r\nstreets.--In exchange for this tribe of truly summer visiters, we have\r\nnow great flocks of the fieldfares and redwings come back to us; and\r\nalso wood pigeons, snipes, woodcocks, and several of the numerous tribe\r\nof water-fowl.\r\n\r\n“Now, occasionally, we may observe the singular effects of a mist,\r\ncoming gradually on, and wrapping in its dusky cloak a whole landscape\r\nthat was, the moment before, clear and bright as in a spring morning.\r\nThe vapour rises visibly (from the face of a distant river perhaps) like\r\nsteam from a boiling caldron; and climbing up into the blue air as it\r\nadvances, rolls wreath over wreath till it reaches the spot on which you\r\nare standing; and then, seeming to hurry past you, its edges, which have\r\nhitherto been distinctly defined, become no longer visible, and the\r\nwhole scene of beauty, which a few moments before surrounded you, is as\r\nit were wrapt from your sight like an unreal vision of the air, and you\r\nseem (and in fact are) transferred into the bosom of a cloud.”[368]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWALLOWS.\r\n\r\nA provincial paper[369] says, “It is a fact, which has not been\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for by ornithologists, that the number of\r\nswallows which visit this island are not near so numerous as they\r\nformerly were; and this is the case, not only in this neighbourhood, but\r\nthroughout the country. The little that is satisfactorily known\r\nconcerning the parts to which they emigrate, and the many statements\r\nrespecting their annual migration, not only serves to show that\r\nsomething remains to be discovered respecting these interesting\r\nvisiters, but perhaps prevents us from ascertaining the causes of the\r\ndecrease in their numbers. In the month of September, 1815, great\r\nnumbers of these birds congregated near Rotherham, previous to their\r\ndeparture for a more genial climate. Their appearance was very\r\nextraordinary, and attracted much attention. We extract some account of\r\nthis vast assemblage of the feathered race, from an elegantly written\r\nlittle work, published on the occasion, by the rev. Thomas Blackley,\r\nvicar of Rotherham, containing ‘Observations and Reflections’ on this\r\ncircumstance:--\r\n\r\n“‘Early in the month of September, 1815, that beautiful and social tribe\r\nof the feathered race began to assemble in the neighbourhood of\r\nRotherham, at the Willow-ground, near the Glass-house, preparatory to\r\ntheir migration to a a warmer climate; and their numbers were daily\r\naugmented, until they became a vast flock which no man could easily\r\nnumber--thousands upon thousands, tens of thousands, and myriads--so\r\ngreat, indeed, that the spectator would almost have concluded that the\r\nwhole of the swallow race were there collected in one huge host. It was\r\ntheir manner, while there, to rise from the willows in the morning, a\r\nlittle before six o’clock, when their thick columns literally darkened\r\nthe sky. Their divisions were formed into four, five, and sometimes six\r\ngrand wings, each of these filing off and taking a different route--one\r\neast, another west, another south, and so on; as if not only to be\r\nequally dispersed throughout the country, to provide food for their\r\nnumerous troops; but also to collect with them whatever of their\r\nfellows, or straggling parties, might be still left behind. Just before\r\nthe respective columns arose, a few birds might be observed first in\r\nmotion at different points, darting through their massy ranks--these\r\nappeared like officers giving the word of command. In the evening, about\r\nfive o’clock, they began to return to their station, and continued\r\ncoming in, from all quarters, until nearly dark. It was here that you\r\nmight see them go through their various aerial evolutions, in many a\r\nsportive ring and airy gambol--strengthening their pinions in these\r\nplayful feats for their long etherial journey; while contentment and\r\ncheerfulness reigned in every breast, and was expressed in their evening\r\nsong by a thousand pleasing twitters from their little throats, as they\r\ncut the air and frolicked in the last beams of the setting sun, or\r\nlightly skimmed the surface of the glassy pool. The notes of those that\r\nhad already gained the willows sounded like the murmur of a distant\r\nwaterfall, or the dying roar of the retreating billow on the sea beach.\r\n\r\n“‘The verdant enamel of summer had already given place to the warm and\r\nmellow tints of autumn, and the leaves were now fast falling from their\r\nbranches, while the naked tops of many of the trees appeared--the golden\r\nsheaves were safely lodged in the barns, and the reapers had, for this\r\nyear, shouted their harvest home--frosty and misty mornings now\r\nsucceeded, the certain presages of the approach of winter. These omens\r\nwere understood by the swallows as the route for their march;\r\naccordingly, on the morning of the 7th of October, their mighty army\r\nbroke up their encampment debouched from their retreat, and, rising,\r\ncovered the heavens with their legions; thence, directed by an unerring\r\nguide, they took their trackless way. On the morning of their going,\r\nwhen they ascended from their temporary abode, they did not, as they had\r\nbeen wont to do, divide into different columns, and take each a\r\ndifferent route, but went off in one vast body, bearing to the south. It\r\nis said that they would have gone sooner, but for a contrary wind which\r\nhad some time prevailed; that on the day before they took their\r\ndeparture, the wind got round, and the favourable breeze was immediately\r\nembraced by them. On the day of their flight, they left behind them\r\nabout a hundred of their companions; whether they were slumberers in the\r\ncamp, and so had missed the going of their troops, or whether they were\r\nleft as the rear-guard, it is not easy to ascertain; they remained,\r\nhowever, till the next morning, when the greater part of them mounted on\r\ntheir pinions, to follow, as it should seem, the celestial route of\r\ntheir departed legions. After these a few stragglers only remained;\r\nthese might be too sick or too young to attempt so great an expedition;\r\nwhether this was the fact or not, they did not remain after the next\r\nday. If they did not follow their army, yet the dreary appearance of\r\ntheir depopulated camp and their affection for their kindred, might\r\ninfluence them to attempt it, or to explore a warmer and safer\r\nretreat.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 50·00.\r\n\r\n  [367] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [368] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n  [369] Sheffield Mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of October, 1749,[370] died at Paris, John Baptist Du Halde,\r\na jesuit, who was secretary to father Le Tellier, confessor to Louis\r\nXIV.

In ten\r\nminutes he started up, fetched his whip, put on his one spur, and went\r\nthence to the stable; not finding his own saddle in the proper place, he\r\nreturned to the house, and asked for it. Being asked what he wanted with\r\nit, he replied, to go his rounds. He returned to the stable, got on the\r\nhorse without the saddle, and was proceeding to leave the stable; it was\r\nwith much difficulty and force that Mr. Hewson junior, assisted by the\r\nother lad, could remove him from the horse; his strength was great, and\r\nit was with difficulty he was brought in doors. Mr. Hewson senior,\r\ncoming home at this time, sent for Mr. Benjamin Ridge, an eminent\r\npractitioner, in Bridge-road, who stood by him for a quarter of an hour,\r\nduring which time the lad considered himself stopped at the turnpike\r\ngate, and took sixpence out of his pocket to be changed; and holding out\r\nhis hand for the change, the sixpence was returned to him. He\r\nimmediately observed, “None of your nonsense--that is the sixpence\r\nagain, give me my change.” When threepence halfpenny was given to him,\r\nhe counted it over, and said, “None of your gammon; that is not right, I\r\nwant a penny more;” making the fourpence halfpenny, which was his\r\nproper change. He then said, “give me my _castor_,” (meaning his hat,)\r\nwhich slang terms he had been in the habit of using, and then began to\r\nwhip and spur to get his horse on; his pulse at this time was one\r\nhundred and thirty-six, full and hard; no change of countenance could be\r\nobserved, nor any spasmodic affection of the muscles, the eyes remaining\r\nclose the whole of the time. His coat was taken off his arm, his shirt\r\nsleeve stripped up, and Mr. Ridge bled him to thirty-two ounces; no\r\nalteration had taken place in him during the first part of the time the\r\nblood was flowing; at about twenty-four ounces, the pulse began to\r\ndecrease; and when the full quantity named above had been taken, it was\r\nat eighty, with a slight perspiration on the forehead. During the time\r\nof bleeding Mr. Hewson related the circumstance of a Mr. Harris,\r\noptician in Holborn, whose son some years before walked out on the\r\nparapet of the house in his sleep. The boy joined the conversation, and\r\nobserved he lived at the corner of Brownlow-street. After the arm was\r\ntied up, he unlaced one boot, and said he would go to bed. In three\r\nminutes from this time he awoke, got up, and asked what was the matter,\r\n(having then been one hour in the trance,) not having the slightest\r\nrecollection of any thing that had passed, and wondered at his arm being\r\ntied up, and at the blood, &c. A strong aperient medicine was then\r\nadministered, he went to bed, slept sound, and the next day appeared\r\nperfectly well, excepting debility from the bleeding and operation of\r\nthe medicine, and had no recollection whatever of what had taken place.\r\nNone of his family or himself were ever affected in this way\r\nbefore.[372]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE STORM.\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable letter in the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” relates\r\nto the present day seventy years ago.\r\n\r\n  Mr. URBAN,\r\n\r\n  _Wigton, Oct. 23, 1756_.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th inst. at night, happened a most violent hurricane; such a one\r\nperhaps as has not happened in these parts, in the memory of man. It\r\nlasted full 4 hours from about 11 till 3. The damage it has done over\r\nthe whole county is very deplorable. The corn has suffered\r\nprodigiously.--Houses were not only unroofed, but in several places\r\noverturned by its fury.--Stacks of hay and corn were entirely swept\r\naway.--Trees without number torn up by the roots. Others, snapt off in\r\nthe middle, and scattered in fragments over the neighbouring fields.\r\nSome were twisted almost round; bent, or split to the roots, and left in\r\nso shattered a condition as cannot be described.\r\n\r\nThe change in the herbage was also very surprising; its leaves _withered\r\nshrivelled_ up, and _turned black_. The leaves upon the trees,\r\nespecially on the weather side, fared in the same manner. The\r\n_Evergreens_ alone seem to have escaped, and the grass recovered in a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nI agreed, at first, with the general opinion, that this mischief was the\r\neffect of _Lightning_; but, when I recollected that, in some places,\r\nvery little had been taken notice of; in others none at all; and that\r\nthe effect was _general_, I begun to think of accounting for it from\r\nsome other cause. I immediately examined the dew or rain which had been\r\nleft on the grass, windows, &c. in hopes of being enabled, by _its\r\ntaste_, to form some better judgment of the particles with which the air\r\nhad been impregnated, and I found it as salt as any sea water I had ever\r\ntasted. The several vegetables also were all saltish more or less, and\r\ncontinued so for 5 or 6 days, the saline particles not being then washed\r\noff; and when the moisture was exhaled from the windows, the saline\r\nchrystal _sparkled_ on the outside, when the sun shined, and appeared\r\nvery _brilliant_.\r\n\r\nThis _salt water_, I conceive, has done the principal damage, for I find\r\nupon experiment, that common salt dissolved in fresh water affected some\r\nfresh vegetables, when sprinkled upon them, in the very _same manner_,\r\nexcept that it did not turn them quite so black,--but particles of a\r\nsulphurous, or other quality,[373] may have been mixed with it.\r\n\r\nI should be glad to see the opinions of some of your ingenious\r\ncorrespondents on this wonderful phenomenon;--whether they think this\r\nsalt water was brought from the sea,[374] and in _what manner_.\r\n\r\n  _Yours_,\r\n\r\n  A.

The coroner’s\r\ninquest found it “self-murder,” and ordered him to be buried in the\r\ncross-ways; but his wife sent for a surgeon, and sold the body for half\r\na guinea. The surgeon feeling about the body, the wife said, “He is fit\r\nfor your purpose, he is as fat as butter.” The deceased was thereupon\r\nput into a sack with his legs hanging out, and being thrown upon a cart,\r\nconveyed to the surgeon’s.[375]\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD TIMES AND NEW TIMES.\r\n\r\nIn a journal of 1826,[376] we have the following pleasant account of a\r\nsimilar publication ninety years ago.\r\n\r\nA curious document, for we may well term it so, has come to our hands--a\r\ncopy of a London newspaper, dated Thursday, March 24, 1736-7. Its title\r\nis, “The Old Whig, or the Consistent Protestant.” It seems to have been\r\na weekly paper, and, at the above date, to have been in existence for\r\nabout two years. How long it lived after, we have not, at present, any\r\nmeans of ascertaining. The paper is similar in size to the French\r\njournals of the present day, and consists of four pages and three\r\ncolumns in each. The show of advertisements is very fair. They fill the\r\nwhole of the back page, and nearly a column of the third. They are all\r\nbook advertisements. One of these is a comedy called “The Universal\r\nPassion,” by the author of “The Man of Taste,” no doubt, at that time,\r\nan amply sufficient description of the ingenious playwright. The “Old\r\nWhig” was published by “J. Roberts, at the Oxford Arms, in\r\nWarwick-lane,” as likewise by “H. Whitridge, bookseller, the corner of\r\nCastle-alley, near the Royal-exchange, in Cornhill, price two-pence!” It\r\nhas a leading article in its way, in the shape of a discourse on the\r\nliberty of the press, which it lustily defends, from what, we believe,\r\nit was as little exposed to, in 1786-7, as it is in 1826--a censorship.\r\nThe editor apologises for omitting _the news_ in his last, on account of\r\n“Mr. Foster’s reply to Dr. Stebbing!” What would be said of a similar\r\nexcuse now-a-days?\r\n\r\nThe following epigram is somewhat hacknied, but there is a pleasure in\r\nextracting it from the print, where it probably first appeared:--\r\n\r\n  “As we were obliged to omit the News in last week’s paper, by\r\n  inserting Mr. Foster’s answer to the Rev. Dr. Stebbing, we shall in\r\n  this give the few articles that are any way material.”\r\n\r\n    “Cries Celia to a reverend dean,\r\n      What reason can be given,\r\n    Since marriage is a holy thing,\r\n      That there is none in Heaven?”\r\n\r\n    “There are no Women,” he replied;\r\n      She quick returns the jest;\r\n    “Women there are, but I’m afraid,\r\n      They cannot find a priest!”\r\n\r\nThe miscellaneous part is of nearly the same character as at present,\r\nbut disposed in rather a less regular form. We have houses on fire, and\r\npeople burnt in them, exactly as _we_ had last week; but what is\r\nwonderful, as it shows the great improvement in these worthy gentlemen\r\nin the course of a century, the “Old Whig” adds to its account--“The\r\nwatch, it seems, though at a small distance, knew nothing of the\r\nmatter!”\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable number of deaths, for people died even in those\r\ngood old times, and one drowning; whether intentional or not we cannot\r\ninform our readers, as the “Old Whig” went to press before the inquest\r\nwas holden before Mr. Coroner and a most respectable jury.\r\n\r\nWe still tipple a little after dinner, but our fathers were prudent men;\r\nthey took time by the forelock, and began their convivialities with\r\ntheir _dejeune_. The following is a short notice of the exploits of a\r\nfew of these true men. It is with a deep feeling of the transitory\r\nnature of all sublunary things, that we introduce this notice, by\r\nannouncing to our readers at a distance, that the merry Boar’s Head is\r\nmerry no more, and that he who goes thither in the hope of quaffing\r\nport, where plump Jack quaffed sack and sugar, will return disappointed.\r\nThe sign remains, but the _hostel_ is gone.\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday last, the right hon. the Lord Mayor held a wardmote at\r\n  St. Mary Abchurch, for the election of a common councilman, in the\r\n  room of Mr. Deputy Davis. His lordship went sooner than was expected\r\n  by Mr. Clay’s friends, and arriving at the church, ordered\r\n  proclamation to be made, when Mr. Edward Yeates was put up by every\r\n  person present; then the question being asked, whether any other was\r\n  offered to the ward, and there being no person named, his lordship\r\n  declared Mr. Yeates duly elected, and ordered him to be sworn in,\r\n  which was accordingly done; and just at the words ‘So help you God,’\r\n  Mr. Clay’s friends (who were numerous, and had been at breakfast at\r\n  the Boar’s Head Tavern, in Eastcheap) came into the church, but it was\r\n  too late, for the election was over. This has created a great deal of\r\n  mirth in the ward, which is likely to continue for some time. The\r\n  Boar’s Head is said to be the tavern so often mentioned by Shakspeare,\r\n  in his play of _Henry the Fourth_, which occasioned a gentleman, who\r\n  heard the circumstances of the election, to repeat the following lines\r\n  from that play:--\r\n\r\n  “‘_Falst._ Now Hall, what a time of day is it, lad?’\r\n\r\n  “‘_P. Hen._----What a devil has thou to do with the time of the day?\r\n  unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons,’” &c.\r\n\r\nThe above account gives a specimen of the sobriety of our fathers;\r\nanother of their virtues is exemplified in the following:--\r\n\r\n  “By a letter from Penzance, in Cornwall, we have the following\r\n  account, viz.:--‘That on the 12th instant at night, was lost near\r\n  Portlevan (and all the men drowned, _as is supposed_), the queen\r\n  Caroline, of Topsham, Thomas Wills, master, from Oporto, there being\r\n  some pieces of letters found on the sands, directed for Edward Mann,\r\n  of Exon, one for James La Roche, Esq. of Bristol, and another for\r\n  Robert Smyth, Esq. and Company, Bristol. Some casks of wine came on\r\n  shore, which were immediately secured by the country people; but on a\r\n  composition with the collector, to pay them eight guineas for each\r\n  pipe they brought on shore, they delivered to him twenty-five pipes;\r\n  and he paid so many times eight guineas, else they would have staved\r\n  them, or carried them off.’”\r\n\r\nThe order maintained in England at that time was nothing compared to the\r\nstrictness of discipline observed on the continent.\r\n\r\n  “They write from Rome, that count Trevelii, a Neapolitan, had been\r\n  beheaded there, for being the author of some satirical writings\r\n  against the Pope: that Father Jacobini, who was sentenced to be\r\n  beheaded on the same account, had obtained the _favour_ of being sent\r\n  to the gallies, through the intercession of cardinal Guadagni, the\r\n  pope’s nephew, who was most maltreated by the priest and the count.”\r\n\r\nThese were times, as Dame Quickly would say, when honourable men were\r\nnot to be insulted with impunity.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes hear of a terrible species of _mammalia_, called West India\r\nPlanters, and there is an individual specimen named Hogan, or something\r\nlike it, whose wonderful fierceness has been sounded in our ears for\r\nsome ten or twelve years. But what will the abolitionists say to the\r\nextract of a letter from Antigua? Compared with these dreadful doings,\r\nMr. Hogan’s delinquencies were mere fleabites.\r\n\r\n  “Extract of a letter from Antigua, January 15, 1736-7:--‘We are in a\r\n  great deal of trouble in this island, the burning of negroes, hanging\r\n  them on gibbets alive, racking them on the wheel, &c. takes up almost\r\n  all our time; that from the 20th of October to this day, there has\r\n  been destroyed sixty-five sensible negro men, most of them tradesmen,\r\n  as carpenters, masons, and coopers. I am almost dead with watching and\r\n  warding, as are many more. They were going to destroy all the white\r\n  inhabitants on the island. Court, the king of the negroes, who was to\r\n  head the insurrection; Tomboy, their general, and Hercules their\r\n  lieutenant-general, were all racked upon the wheel, and died with\r\n  amazing obstinacy. Mr. Archibald Hamilton’s Harry, after he was\r\n  condemned, stuck himself with a knife in eighteen places, four whereof\r\n  were mortal, which killed him. Colonel Martin’s Jemmy, who was hung up\r\n  alive from noon to eleven at night, was then taken down to give\r\n  information. Colonel Morgan’s Ned, who, after he had been hung up\r\n  seven days and seven nights, that his hands grew too small for his\r\n  hand-cuffs, he got them out and raised himself up, and fell down from\r\n  a gibbet fifteen feet high, without any harm; he was revived with\r\n  cordials and broth, in hopes to bring him to a confession, but he\r\n  would not confess, and was hung up again, and in a day and night after\r\n  expired. Mr. Yeoman’s Quashy Coomah jumped out of the fire half burnt,\r\n  but was thrown in again. And Mr. Lyon’s Tim jumped out of the fire,\r\n  and promised to declare all, but it took no effect. In short, our\r\n  island is in a poor, miserable condition, that I wish I could get any\r\n  sort of employ in England.’”\r\n\r\nThe following notice is of a more pleasing character:--\r\n\r\n  “In a few days, a fine monument to the memory of John Gay, Esq.,\r\n  author of the _Beggar’s Opera_, and several other admired pieces, will\r\n  be erected in Westminster-abbey, at the expense of his grace the duke\r\n  of Queensberry and Dover, with an elegant inscription thereon,\r\n  composed by the deceased’s intimate and affectionate friend, Mr.\r\n  Alexander Pope.”\r\n\r\nThere are two more observations which we have to make; 1st. “the Old\r\nWhig,” as was meet, was a strong Orangeman; and 2d. the parliament was\r\nsitting when the number before us was published, and yet it does not\r\ncontain one line of debate!\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 53·77.\r\n\r\n  [375] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [376] New Times, September 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 8.~\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT MANNERS.\r\n\r\nElias Ashmole, the antiquary, enters thus in the diary of his\r\nlife:--“1657, October 8. The cause between me and my wife was heard,\r\nwhen Mr. Serjeant Maynard observed to the court, that there were 800\r\nsheets of depositions on my wife’s part, and not one word proved against\r\nme of using her ill, nor ever giving her a bad or provoking word.” The\r\ndecision was against the lady; the court, refusing her alimony,\r\ndelivered her to her husband; “whereupon,” says Ashmole, “I carried her\r\nto Mr. Lilly’s, and there took lodgings for us both.” He and Lilly\r\ndabbled in astrology; and he tells no more of his spouse till he enters\r\n“1668, April 1. 2 Hor. _ante merid._ the lady Mainwaring my wife\r\n_died_.” Subsequently he writes--“November 3. I married Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nDugdale, daughter to William Dugdale, Esq. Norroy, king of arms at\r\nLincoln’s-inn chapel. Dr. William Floyd married us, and her father gave\r\nher. The wedding was finished at 10 _hor. post merid_.”\r\n\r\nAshmole’s diary minutely records particulars of all sorts:--“September\r\n5, I took pills; 6, I took a sweat; 7, I took leeches; all wrought very\r\nwell.--December 19, Dr. Chamberlain proposed to me to bring Dr. Lister\r\nto my wife, that he might undertake her. 22. They both came to my house,\r\nand Dr. Lister _did_ undertake her.” Though Dr. Lister was her\r\nundertaker on that occasion, yet Ashmole records--“1687, April 16, my\r\nwife took Mr. Bigg’s vomit, which wrought very well.--19. She took\r\n_pulvis sanctis_; in the afternoon she took cold.” Death took Ashmole\r\nin 1695. He was superstitious and punctilious, and was perhaps a better\r\nantiquary than a friend; he seems to have possessed himself of\r\nTradescant’s museum at South Lambeth in a manner which rather showed his\r\nlove of antiquities than poor old Tradescant.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Ashmole’s life, “drawn up by himself by way\r\nof diary,” was not printed with the Life of Lilly in the\r\n“Autobiography.” Lilly’s Life is published in that pleasant work by\r\nitself. “Tom Davies” deemed them fit companions.\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 53·80.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 9.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

This was commonly a very disorderly and tumultuous assembly, and\r\nwas the occasion some years ago of a scene of terrible confusion and\r\nslaughter. The porter who kept the gate of the city which leads to this\r\nvillage, in order to exact a contribution from the people as they\r\nreturned, shut the gate at an earlier hour than usual. The people,\r\nincensed at the extortion, assembled in a crowd round the gate to force\r\nit, and in the conflict numbers were stifled, squeezed to death, or\r\nthrown into the Rhone, on the side of which the gate stood. Two hundred\r\npersons were computed to have lost their lives on this occasion. The\r\nporter paid his avarice with his life: he was condemned and executed as\r\nthe author of the tumult, and of the consequences by which it was\r\nattended.[377]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 52·62.\r\n\r\n  [377] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 10.~\r\n\r\n1826.

Aldhelm died in 709, is said to be the first who\r\nintroduced poetry into England, to have obtained a proficiency in music,\r\nand the first Englishman who ever wrote in Latin.\r\n\r\nTo the present time Pack Monday fair, is annually announced three or\r\nfour weeks previous by all the little urchins who can procure and blow a\r\ncow’s horn, parading the streets in the evenings, and sending forth the\r\ndifferent tones of their horny bugles, sometimes beating an old saucepan\r\nfor a drum, to render the sweet sound more delicious, and not\r\nunfrequently a whistle-pipe or a fife is added to the band. The clock’s\r\nstriking twelve on the Sunday night previous, is the summons for\r\nushering in the fair, when the boys assemble with their horns, and\r\nparade the town with a noisy shout, and prepare to forage for fuel to\r\nlight a bonfire, generally of straw, obtained from some of the\r\nneighbouring farmyards, which are sure to be plundered, without respect\r\nto the owners, if they have not been fortunate enough to secure the\r\nmaterial in some safe part of their premises. In this way the youths\r\nenjoy themselves in boisterous triumph, to the annoyance of the sleeping\r\npart of the inhabitants, many of whom deplore, whilst others, who\r\nentertain respect for old customs, delight in the deafening mirth. At\r\nfour o’clock the great bell is rang for a quarter of an hour. From this\r\ntime, the bustle commences by the preparations for the coming scene:\r\nstalls erecting, windows cleaning and decorating, shepherds and drovers\r\ngoing forth for their flocks and herds, which are depastured for the\r\nnight in the neighbouring fields, and every individual seems on the\r\nalert. The business in the sheep and cattle fairs (which are held in\r\ndifferent fields, nearly in the centre of the town, and well attended by\r\nthe gentlemen farmers, of Dorset, Somerset, and Devon) takes precedence,\r\nand is generally concluded by twelve o’clock, when what is called the\r\nin-fair begins to wear the appearance of business-like activity, and\r\nfrom this time till three or four o’clock more business is transacted in\r\nthe shop, counting-house, parlour, hall, and kitchen, than at any other\r\ntime of the day, it being a custom of the tradespeople to have their\r\nyearly accounts settled about this time, and scarcely a draper, grocer,\r\nhatter, ironmonger, bookseller, or other respectable tradesman, but is\r\nprovided with an ample store of beef and home-brewed October, for the\r\nwelcome of their numerous customers, few of whom depart without taking\r\n_quantum suff._ of the old English fare placed before them.\r\n\r\nNow, (according to an old saying,) is the _town alive_. John takes Joan\r\nto see the shows,--there he finds the giant--here the learned pig--the\r\ngiantess and dwarf--the menagerie of wild beasts--the conjuror--and Mr.\r\nMerry Andrew cracking his jokes with his _quondam_ master. Here it\r\nis--“Walk up, walk up, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to begin,\r\nbe in time, the price is only twopence.” Here is Mr. Warr’s merry\r\nround-about, with “a horse or a coach for a halfpenny.”--Here is Rebecca\r\nSwain[380] with her black and red cock, and lucky-bag, who bawls out,\r\n“Come, my little lucky rogues, and try your fortune for a halfpenny, all\r\nprizes and no blanks, a faint heart never wins a fair lady.”--Here is\r\npricking in the garter.--Raffling for gingerbread, with the cry of “one\r\nin; who makes two, the more the merrier.”--Here is the Sheffield\r\nhardwareman, sporting a worn-out wig and huge pair of spectacles,\r\noffering, in lots, a box of razors, knives, scissors, &c., each lot of\r\nwhich he modestly says, “is worth seven shillings, but he’ll not be too\r\nhard on the gaping crowd, he’ll not take seven, nor six, nor five, nor\r\nfour, nor three, nor two, but one shilling for the lot,--going at one\r\nshilling--sold again and the money paid.”--Here are two earthenware-men\r\nbawling their shilling’s worth one against the other, and quaffing beer\r\nto each other’s luck from that necessary and convenient chamber utensil\r\nthat has modestly usurped the name of the great river _Po_. Here is\r\n_poor Will_, with a basket of gingerbread, crying “toss or buy.” There\r\nis a smirking little lad pinning two girls together by their gowns,\r\nwhilst his companion cracks a Waterloo bang-up in their faces. Here\r\nstands John with his mouth wide open, and Joan with her sloe-black ogles\r\nstretched to their extremity at a fine painted shawl, which _Cheap John_\r\nis offering for next to nothing; and here is a hundred other\r\ncontrivances to draw the “_browns_” from the pockets of the unwary, and\r\ntickle the fancies of the curious; and sometimes the rogue of a\r\npickpocket extracting farmer Anybody’s watch or money from his pockets.\r\n\r\nThis is Pack Monday fair, till evening throws on her dark veil, when the\r\nvisiters in taking their farewell, stroll through the rows of\r\ngingerbread stalls, where the spruce Mrs. or Miss Sugarplum pops the\r\ncover of her nut-cannister forth, with “buy some nice nuts, do taste,\r\nsir, (or ma’me,) and treat your companion with a paper of nuts.” By this\r\ntime the country folks are for jogging home, and vehicles and horses of\r\nevery description on the move, and the bustle nearly over, with the\r\nexception of what is to be met with at the inns, where the lads and\r\nlasses so disposed, on the light fantastic toe, assisted by the merry\r\nscraping of the fiddler, finish the fun, frolic, and pastime of Pack\r\nMonday Fair.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  R.

As the “Minor Poems” are not at hand, I can only hope I\r\nhave quoted the preceding lines accurately. Their import impressed me\r\nin my boyhood, and one fine summer’s afternoon, a year or two ago, I\r\ninvoluntarily repeated them while musing beside that part of the “New\r\nRiver” represented in the engraving. I had strolled to “the Compasses,”\r\nwhen “the garden,” as the landlord calls it, was free from the nuisance\r\nof “company;” and thither I afterwards deluded an artist, who continues\r\nto “use the house,” and supplies me with the drawing of this sequestered\r\nnook.\r\n\r\nThis “gentle river” meanders through countless spots of surprising\r\nbeauty and variety within ten miles of town. When I was a boy I thought\r\n“Sadler’s Well’s arch,” opposite the “Sir Hugh Myddelton,” (a house\r\nimmortalized by Hogarth,) the prime part of the river; for there, by the\r\naid of a penny line, and a ha’porth of gentles and blood-worms, “mixed,”\r\nbought of old Turpin, who kept the little fishing-tackle shop, the last\r\nhouse by the river’s side, at the end next St. John’s-street-road, I\r\nessayed to gudgeon gudgeons. But the “prime” gudgeon-fishing, then, was\r\nat “the Coffin,” through which the stream flows after burying itself at\r\nthe Thatched-house, under Islington road, to Colebrooke-row, within half\r\na stone’s throw of a cottage, endeared to me, in later years, by its\r\nbeing the abode of “as much virtue as can _live_.” Past the\r\nThatched-house, towards Canonbury, there was the “Horse-shoe,” now no\r\nmore, and the enchanting rear--since despoiled--of the gardens to the\r\nretreats of Canonbury-place; and all along the river to the pleasant\r\nvillage of Hornsey, there were delightful retirements on its banks, so\r\n“far from the busy haunts of men,” that only a few solitary wanderers\r\nseemed to know them. Since then, I have gone “over the hills and far\r\naway,” to see it sweetly flowing at Enfield Chase, near many a “cottage\r\nof content,” as I have conceived the lowly dwellings to be, which there\r\nskirt it, with their little gardens, not too trim, whence the inmates\r\ncross the neat iron bridges of the “New River Company,” which, thinking\r\nof “auld lang syne,” I could almost wish were of wood. Further on, the\r\nriver gracefully recedes into the pleasant grounds of the late Mr. Gough\r\nthe antiquary, who, if he chiefly wrote on the manners and remains of\r\nold times, had an especial love and kind feeling for the amiable and\r\npicturesque of our own. Pursuing the river thence to Theobalds, it\r\npresents to the “contemplative man’s recreation,” temptations that old\r\nWalton himself might have coveted to fall in his way: and why may we not\r\n“suppose that the vicinity of the New River, to the place of his\r\nhabitation, might sometimes tempt him out, whose loss he so pathetically\r\nmentions, to spend an afternoon there.” He tells “the honest angler,”\r\nthat the writing of his book was the “recreation of a recreation,” and\r\nfamiliarly says, “the whole discourse is, or rather was, a picture of my\r\nown disposition, especially in such days and times as I have laid aside\r\nbusiness, and gone a fishing with honest Nat. and R. Roe; but they are\r\ngone, and with them most of my pleasant hours,--even as a shadow that\r\npasseth away and returns not.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI dare not say that I am, and yet I cannot say that I never was, an\r\nangler; for I well remember where, though I cannot tell when, within a\r\nyear, I was enticed to “go a fishing,” as the saying is, which I have\r\nsometimes imagined was derived from Walton’s motto on the title of his\r\nbook:--“Simon Peter said, I _go a fishing_: and they said, we also will\r\ngo with thee.--_John_ xxi. 3.” This passage is not in all the editions\r\nof the “Complete Angler,” but it was engraven on the title-page of the\r\nfirst edition, printed in 1653. Allow me to refer to one of “captain\r\nWharton’s almanacs,” as old Lilly calls them in his “Life and Times,”\r\nand point out what was, perhaps, the earliest _advertisement_ of\r\nWalton’s work: it is on the back of the dedication leaf to\r\n“HEMEROSCOPEION: Anni Æræ Christianæ 1654.” The almanac was published of\r\ncourse in the preceding year, which was the year wherein Walton’s work\r\nwas printed.\r\n\r\n~Advertisement of Walton’s Angler, 1653.~\r\n\r\n  “There is published a Booke of Eighteen-pence price, called _The\r\n  Compleat Angler_, Or, _The Contemplative man’s Recreation_: being a\r\n  Discourse of Fish and Fishing. Not unworthy the perusall. Sold by\r\n  _Richard Marriot_ in S. _Dunstan_’s Church-yard _Fleetstreet_.”\r\n\r\nThis advertisement I deem a bibliomaniacal curiosity. Only think of the\r\nfirst edition of Walton as a “booke of eighteen-pence price!” and\r\nimagine the good old man on the day of publication, walking from his\r\nhouse “on the north side of Fleet-street, two doors west of the end of\r\nChancery-lane,” to his publisher and neighbour just by, “Richard\r\nMarriot, in S. Dunstan’s Churchyard,” for the purpose of inquiring “how”\r\nthe book “went off.” There is, or lately was, a large fish in effigy, at\r\na fishing-tackle-maker’s in Fleet-street, near Bell-yard, which,\r\nwhenever I saw it, after I first read Walton’s work, many years ago,\r\nreminded me of him, and his pleasant book, and its delightful ditties,\r\nand brought him before me, sitting on “a primrose bank” turning his\r\n“present thoughts into verse”\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLER’S WISH.\r\n\r\n    I in these flowery meads would be:\r\n    These crystal streams should solace me;\r\n    To whose harmonious bubbling noise\r\n    I with my angle would rejoice:\r\n    Sit here, and see the turtle-dove\r\n    Court his chaste mate to acts of love:\r\n\r\n    Or, on that bank, feel the west wind\r\n    Breathe health and plenty: please my mind,\r\n    To see sweet dew-drops kiss these flowers,\r\n    And then washed off by April showers;\r\n    Here, hear my _Kenna_ sing a song;\r\n    There, see a blackbird feed her young,\r\n    Or a leverock build her nest:\r\n    Here, give my weary spirits rest,\r\n    And raise my low-pitch’d thoughts above\r\n    Earth, or what poor mortals love:\r\n      Thus, free from law-suits and the noise\r\n      Of princes’ courts, I would rejoice:\r\n\r\n    Or, with my Bryan, and a book,\r\n    Loiter long days near Shawford-brook;\r\n    There sit by him, and eat my meat,\r\n    There see the sun both rise and set;\r\n    There bid good morning to next day;\r\n    There meditate my time away;\r\n      And angle on; and beg to have\r\n      A quiet passage to a welcome grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 52·05.\r\n\r\n  [378] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [379] _Hutchins_, in his “_History of Dorset_,” says, this “Fair is\r\n  held in the churchyard,[381] on the first Monday after the feast of\r\n  St. Michael, (O.

For this memorable achievement he was created a\r\nviscount, with a pension of two thousand pounds per annum. His lordship\r\ndied on the 4th of August, 1804; he was born at Dundee, in Scotland, on\r\nthe 1st of July, 1731. After the battle of Camperdown was decided, he\r\ncalled his crew together in the presence of the captured Dutch admiral,\r\nwho was greatly affected by the scene, and Duncan kneeling on the deck,\r\nwith every man under his command, “solemnly and pathetically offered up\r\npraise and thanksgiving to the God of battles;--strongly proving the\r\ntruth of the assertion, that piety and courage should be inseparably\r\nallied, and that the latter without the former loses its principal\r\nvirtue.”[382]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 51·82.\r\n\r\n  [382] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 12.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of October, 1748, was born at St. John’s near Worcester, Mr.\r\nWilliam Butler, the author of “Chronological, Biographical, Historical,\r\nand Miscellaneous Exercises,” an excellent work, for young persons\r\nespecially, a useful compendium in every library, and one to which the\r\neditor of the _Every-Day Book_ has been indebted as a ready guide to\r\nmany interesting and important events.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh edition of Mr. Butler’s work just mentioned, we are\r\ninformed by his son, Mr. John Olding Butler, that his father was\r\neducated in the city of Worcester. Having acquired considerable\r\nknowledge, and especially an excellent style of penmanship, he in 1765\r\nrepaired to the metropolis, and commenced his career as a teacher of\r\nwriting and geography. In these branches of education he attained the\r\nhighest repute on account of the improvements which were introduced by\r\nhim in his mode of instruction. His copies were derived from the sources\r\nof geography, history, and biographical memoirs. A yet more extensive\r\nand permanent benefit was conferred upon young persons by the many\r\nuseful and ingenious works which he published, a list of which is\r\nsubjoined. They contain a mass of information, both instructive and\r\nentertaining, rarely collected in one form, and are admirably adapted to\r\npromote the great design of their author--the moral, intellectual, and\r\nreligious improvement of the rising generation; to this he consecrated\r\nall his faculties, the stores of his memory, and the treasures of his\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAs a practical teacher Mr. Butler had few superiors, and his success in\r\nlife was commensurate with his merit: he was the most popular instructor\r\nin his line.\r\n\r\nA strict probity, an inviolable regard to truth, an honourable\r\nindependence of mind, and a diffusive benevolence, adorned his moral\r\ncharacter; and to these eminent virtues must be added, that of a rigid\r\neconomy and improvement of time, for which he was most remarkable. How\r\nmuch he endeavoured to inculcate that which he deemed the foundation of\r\nevery virtue, the principle of religion, may be seen in his\r\n“Chronological, &c., Exercises:” to impress this principle on the\r\nyouthful heart and mind was considered by him as the highest duty. Mr.\r\nButler’s professional labours were commenced at the early age of\r\nseventeen, and were continued with indefatigable ardour to the last year\r\nof his life, a period of fifty-seven years. In estimating the value of\r\nsuch a man, we should combine his moral principle with his literary\r\nemployments; these were formed by him into duties, which he most\r\nconscientiously discharged: and he will be long remembered as one who\r\ncommunicated to a large and respectable circle of pupils solid\r\ninformation, examples of virtue, and the means of happiness; and who, in\r\nan age fruitful of knowledge, by his writings instructed, and will long\r\ncontinue to instruct the rising generation, and benefit mankind. His\r\nvirtues will live and have a force beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler died at Hackney, August 1, 1822, after a painful illness,\r\nborne with exemplary patience and resignation. He was one of the oldest\r\ninhabitants of that parish, and was interred there, by his own desire,\r\nin the burying-ground attached to the meeting-house of his friend, the\r\nlate Rev. Samuel Palmer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A list of Mr. Butler’s books for the use of young persons._\r\n\r\n  1. CHRONOLOGICAL EXERCISES, already mentioned.

EDWARD. CONF.\r\n\r\nThis notice of the day in the church of England calendar and almanacs,\r\ndenotes it as the festival of the translation of king Edward the\r\nConfessor.[383]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor died on the 5th of January, 1066, and was buried in\r\nthe abbey church of St. Peter, Westminster. “His queen, Edgitha,\r\nsurvived the saint many years;” she was buried beside him, and her\r\ncoffin was covered with plates of silver and gold. According to his\r\nbiographers, in 1102, the body of St. Edward was found entire, the limbs\r\nflexible, and the clothes fresh. The bishop of Rochester “out of a\r\ndevout affection, endeavoured to pluck onely one hayre from his head,\r\nbut it stuck so firmly that he was defeated of his desire.” This was at\r\nthe saint’s first translation. Upon miracles “duly proved, the saint was\r\ncanonized by Alexander III., in 1161.” It appears that “there are\r\ncommemorated severall translations of his sacred body.” In 1163, “it was\r\nagain translated by S. Thomas à Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, in the\r\npresence of king Henry II. This translation seems to have been made on\r\nthe 13th of October; for on that day “he is commemorated in our\r\nmartyrologe, whereas in the Roman he is celebrated on the 5th of\r\nJanuary.” It further appears that, “about a hundred years after, in the\r\npresence of king Henry III., it was again translated, and reposed in a\r\ngolden shrine, prepared for it by the same king.[384]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe see of Rome is indebted to Edward the Confessor for a grant to the\r\npope of what was then called Rome-scot, but is now better known by the\r\nname of “Peterpenny.” The recollection of this tribute is maintained by\r\nthe common saying “no penny, no paternoster;” of which there is mention\r\nin the following poem from the “Hesperides:”--\r\n\r\n        Fresh strewings allow\r\n        To my sepulcher now,\r\n    To make my lodging the sweeter;\r\n        A staffe or a wand\r\n        Put then in my hand,\r\n    With a penny to pay S.

Luc. xix. 42 _In Hoc Die Tuo_. In This THY DAY. London, Printed by\r\n  _A. R._ And are to be sold by _Randal Taylor_, near _Stationers_-Hall\r\n  1687.” Folio.\r\n\r\nIn this curious tract, the author purports to set forth “how lucky the\r\n_Fourteenth of October_ hath been to the princes of England,” and\r\nbecause he discovers “out of _Wharton’s Gesta Britannorum_, and the\r\ncollections of others, that his late royal highness, our magnanimous\r\nmagnificent sovereign, (James II.,) was also born upon that _augural_\r\nday,” he observes--“It made more than ordinary impression upon me, so\r\nthat I never saw him, but, I thought, in his very face there were\r\nextraordinary instances and tokens of regality.”\r\n\r\nThere were some, it seems, who, after “his late royal highness” the\r\ndukes “recess into Holland,” “exceedingly tryumphed, wishing he might\r\nnever return; nay, that he durst not, nor would be permitted so to do;\r\nusing, moreover, opprobrious terms.” These persons, he tells us, he\r\n“prophetically characteris’d” in his “_Introductio ad Latinam\r\nBlasoniam_;” hence, he says, “Indignation made me print my ensuing\r\nsentiments,” which “found good acceptance among the better and more\r\nloyal sort;” and hence, he further says, “things by me forethought, and\r\npublickly hinted, being come to pass, my _Day Fatality_ began to be\r\nremembred; and one whom I wish very well, desiring I would give him\r\nleave to reprint _that_, and two other of my small pieces together, I\r\nassented to his request.” These form the present treatise, from whence\r\nwe gather that the _Fourteenth of October_\r\n\r\n        ------------- “gave the Norman duke\r\n    That vict’ry whence he England’s scepter took,”\r\n\r\nand was remarkable for the safe landing of Edward III., after being\r\nendangered by a tempest at sea on his returning victorious from France.\r\nWherefore, says our author, in Latin first, and then in these English\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n    “Great duke rejoice in this your day of birth,\r\n    And may such _omens_ still increase your mirth.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards he relates, from Matthew Paris, that when “Lewis king of\r\nFrance had set footing here, and took some eminent places, he besieged\r\nCalais from 22 of July, to the _Fourteenth of October_ following, about\r\nwhich time the siege was raised, and England thereby relieved.” Likewise\r\n“a memorable peace, (foretold by Nostradamus) much conducing to the\r\nsaving of christian blood, was made upon the _Fourteenth of October,\r\n1557_, between pope Paul the IV., Henry the II. of France, and Philip\r\nthe II. of Spain.” Whereon, exclaims our exultant author, “A _lucky day_\r\nthis, not only to the princes of England, but auspicious to the welfare\r\nof Europe.” He concludes by declaring “that it may be so to his royal\r\nhighness, as well as it was to the most great queen his mother, are the\r\nhearty prayers of BLEW-MANTLE.”\r\n\r\nFrom the conclusion of the last sentence, and the previous reference to\r\nhis “Blasoniam,” we find this writer to have been John Gibbon, the\r\nauthor of “An Easie Introduction to Latine Blason, being both Latine and\r\nEnglish”--an octavo volume, now only remembered by the few collectors of\r\nevery thing written on “coat-armour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGibbon speaks of one of his pamphlets “whose title _should_ have been\r\n_Dux Bonis Omnibus Appellens_, or _The Swans’ Welcome_;” or rather, as\r\nhe afterwards set it out at large, “Some Remarks upon the Note-worthy\r\nPassage, mentioned in the TRUE DOMESTICK INTELLIGENCE dated _October the\r\nFourteenth 1679_, concerning a company of SWANS more than ordinary\r\ngathered together at his royal highness’s landing.” Instead, however, of\r\nits having such a title, he tells us “there was _a strange mistake_, not\r\nonly in that, but in other material circumstances; so that many suppose,\r\nthe printer could never have done it himself, but borrowed the\r\nassistance of the evil spirit to render it ridiculous, and not only so,\r\nbut the very _Duke_ himself and the _Loyal Artillery_!”, wherefore “the\r\nprinter smothered the far greatest number of them,” yet, as he adds it\r\nto the tract on the _Fourteenth of October_, we have the advantage to be\r\ntold “what authors say of the candid Swan,” that all esteem him for a\r\n“bird royal,” that “oftentimes in coats and crests we meet him either\r\ncrown’d or coronally collar’d,” that “he is a bird of great beauty and\r\nstrength also,” that “shipmen take it for good luck if in peril of\r\nshipwreck they meet swans,” that “he uses not his strength to prey or\r\ntyrannize over any other fowl, but only to be revenged of such as offer\r\nhim wrong,” and so forth. _Ergo_--according to “Blew-mantle,” we should\r\nbelieve that, “the most serene king James II.” was greeted by these\r\nhonourable birds, “in _allegory_ assembled,” to signify his kindred\r\nvirtues. If Gibbon lived from 1687, where he published his “Remarques,\r\non the _Fourteenth of October_” as the auspicious birth-day of James II.\r\nuntil the landing of William III. in the following year--did he follow\r\nthe swan-like monarch to the court of France, or remain “Blew-mantle” in\r\nthe Herald’s college, to do honour to the court of “the deliverer?”\r\n\r\nGibbon, in his “Remarques,” on the “auspicious” _Fourteenth of October_,\r\nprints the following epistle, to himself, which may be regarded as a\r\ncuriosity on account of the superstition of its writer.\r\n\r\n  A letter from Sir _Winston Churchil_, Knight; Father to the Right\r\n  Honourable, _John_ Lord Churchil.\r\n\r\n  I Thank you for your kind Present, the Observation of the _Fatality of\r\n  Days_.

I was Knighted (by chance, unexpected by my self) on the same Day;\r\n  and have several good Accidents happened to me, on that Day: And am so\r\n  superstitious in the Belief of its good Omen, That I chuse to begin\r\n  any Considerable Action (that concerns me) on the same Day. I hope HE,\r\n  whom it most concerns, will live to own your Respect, and Good Wishes,\r\n  expressed in That Essay of yours: Which discovering a more than common\r\n  Affection to the DUKE, and being as valuable for the Singularity of\r\n  the _Subject_, as the Ingenuity of your _Fancy_, I sent into\r\n  _Flanders_, as soon as I had it; That They on the Other Side the Water\r\n  may see, ’Tis not all sowre Wine, that runs from our _English_ Press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The Right Honourable, John Lord Churchil,” mentioned at the head of\r\nthis ominous letter, became celebrated as “the great duke of\r\nMarlborough.” Sir Winston Churchill was the author of “Divi Britannici,\r\na history of the lives of the English kings” in folio; but his name is\r\nchiefly remembered in connection with his son’s, and from his having\r\nalso been father to Arabella Churchill, who became mistress to the most\r\nserene king of Blew-Mantle Gibbon, and from that connection was mother\r\nof the duke of Berwick, who turned his arms against the country of her\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nSir Winston was a cavalier, knighted at the restoration of Charles II.,\r\nfor exertions in the royal cause, by which his estates became forfeited.\r\nHe recovered them under Charles, obtained a seat in the house of\r\ncommons, became a fellow of the royal society, had a seat at the board\r\nof green cloth, and died in 1688. He was born in 1620, at Wootton\r\nGlanville, in Dorsetshire.[385] His letter on “Fryday” is quite as\r\nimportant as his “Divi Britannici.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING HONEY WITHOUT KILLING THE BEES.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th day of October, 1766, Mr. Wildman, of Plymouth, who had made\r\nhimself famous throughout the west of England for his command over bees,\r\nwas sent for to wait on lord Spencer, at his seat at Wimbledon, in\r\nSurrey; and he attended accordingly. Several of the nobility and persons\r\nof fashion were assembled, and the countess had provided three stocks of\r\nbees. The first of his performances was with one hive of bees hanging on\r\nhis hat, which he carried in his hand, and the hive they came out of in\r\nthe other hand; this was to show that he could take honey and wax\r\nwithout destroying the bees. Then he returned into the room, and came\r\nout again with them hanging on his chin, with a very venerable beard.\r\nAfter showing them to the company, he took them out upon the grass walk\r\nfacing the windows, where a table and table cloth being provided, he set\r\nthe hive upon the table, and made the bees hive therein. Then he made\r\nthem come out again, and swarm in the air, the ladies and nobility\r\nstanding amongst them, and no person stung by them. He made them go on\r\nthe table and took them up by handfuls, and tossed them up and down\r\nlike so many peas; he then made them go into their hive at the word of\r\ncommand. At five o’clock in the afternoon he exhibited again with the\r\nthree swarms of bees, one on his head, one on his breast, and the other\r\non his arm, and waited on lord Spencer in his room, who had been too\r\nmuch indisposed to see the former experiments; the hives which the bees\r\nhad been taken from, were carried by one of the servants. After this\r\nexhibition he withdrew, but returned once more to the room with the bees\r\nall over his head, face, and eyes, and was led blind before his\r\nlordship’s window. One of his lordship’s horses being brought out in his\r\nbody clothes, Mr. Wildman mounted the horse, with the bees all over his\r\nhead and face, (except his eyes;) they likewise covered his breast and\r\nleft arm; he held a whip in his right hand, and a groom led the horse\r\nbackwards and forwards before his lordship’s window for some time. Mr.\r\nWildman afterwards took the reins in his hand, and rode round the house;\r\nhe then dismounted, and made the bees march upon a table, and at his\r\nword of command retire to their hive. The performance surprised and\r\ngratified the earl and countess and all the spectators who had assembled\r\nto witness this great bee-master’s extraordinary exhibition.[386]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCan the honey be taken without destroying the bees?

This name is derived _a\r\nmercibus_, because he was the god of merchandize; and, in that quality,\r\nhe is sometimes represented as a young man without a beard, holding on\r\nhis wrists a cock as an emblem of vigilance, and in his hand a purse as\r\nits reward. A beautiful head of this deity on hiacynth, in the\r\npossession of lord Clanbrassill, when it was charmingly etched by\r\nWorlidge, is pictured in the present engraving.

These are usually prints stretched out, side by side, on an\r\nupright frame, or sometimes oil paintings representing characters or\r\nsituations of interest. For instance, in the present exhibition there is\r\nthe mode of keeping the festival of the new year, a grand ball, a feast,\r\na wedding, a “high sight” of the court, and, in all, thirteen subjects,\r\nsufficiently beyond the intimacy of the populace to excite their\r\ncuriosity. The showman commonly details so much concerning every thing\r\nin his grand exhibition, and so elevates each, as to interest his\r\nauditors to the height of desiring further particulars. The stories are\r\nprinted separately in the shape of ballads or garlands, and “embellished\r\nwith cuts;” by the sale of these to his auditors he obtains the reward\r\nof his oratory.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for a German showman are a manly person, sonorous\r\nvoice, fluent delivery, and imposing manner. In dress he is like a\r\nsergeant-major, and in address like a person accustomed to command. He\r\nis accompanied in his speeches by a fiddler of vivacity or trick, to\r\nkeep the people “in merry pin.” This associate is generally an old\r\nhumourist, with a false nose of strange form and large dimensions, or a\r\nhuge pair of spectacles. Their united exertions are sure to gratify\r\naudiences more disposed to be pleased than to criticise. With them, the\r\nshow is an affair of like or dislike to the eye, and beyond that the\r\njudgment is seldom appealed to on the spot. If the outlines of the\r\nshowman’s stories are bold, and well expressed, they are sure to amuse;\r\nhis printed narratives are in good demand; both exhibitors and auditors\r\npart satisfied with each other; and they frequently meet again. This is\r\nthe lowest order of the continental street comedy. In England we have\r\nnot any thing like it, nor are we likely to have; for, though strange\r\nsights almost cease to attract, yet the manager and musician to a\r\nrational exhibition of this sort, in the open air, clearly come within\r\nthe purview of recent acts of parliament, and would be consigned to the\r\ntread-mill. What recreation, however, can be more harmless if the\r\nsubjects are harmless. “Death and the Lady,” the “Bloody Gardener’s\r\nCruelty,” and the numerous tribe of stories to which these garlands\r\nbelong, continue to be pinned on lines against a few walls of the\r\nmetropolis, but they cease to attract. The “common people,” as they are\r\ncalled, require a new species of street entertainment and a new\r\nliterature: both might be easily supplied with infinite advantage to the\r\npublic morals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 50·72.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 16.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEASON.\r\n\r\nAn appearance at this time of the year, already noticed, appears to have\r\nsurprised our countrymen in Lancashire. Though there is no doubt that\r\nthe authorities who communicate the intelligence believe it very\r\nremarkable, yet it is doubtful whether the occurrence may not be more\r\nfrequent in that part of England than they have had the opportunity of\r\nremarking. Their account is to the following purport:--\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 1, 1826, a phenomenon of rare occurrence in the\r\nneighbourhood of Liverpool was observed in that vicinage, and for many\r\nmiles distant, especially at Wigan. The fields and roads were covered\r\nwith a light filmy substance, which by many persons was mistaken for\r\ncotton; although they might have been convinced of their error, as\r\nstaple cotton does not exceed a few inches in length, while the\r\nfilaments seen in such incredible quantities extended as many yards. In\r\nwalking in the fields the shoes were completely covered with it, and its\r\nfloating fibres came in contact with the face in all directions. Every\r\ntree, lamppost, or other projecting body had arrested a portion of it.\r\nIt profusely descended at Wigan like a sleet, and in such quantities as\r\nto affect the appearance of the atmosphere. On examination it was found\r\nto contain small flies, some of which were so diminutive as to require a\r\nmagnifying glass to render them perceptible. The substance so abundant\r\nin quantity was the _gossamer_ of the garden, or field spider, often met\r\nwith in the country in fine weather, and of which, according to Buffon,\r\nit would take 663,552 spiders to produce a single pound.[387]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 58·45.\r\n\r\n  [387] Liverpool Mercury.

I am not a native of this part of the\r\ncountry, or, as the good people say here, I am not “one o’ Westbury,”\r\nfor I have resided till lately in and near London, where the manners\r\ncustoms, and habits, are a hundred years in advance of those of the\r\nwestern part of the kingdom; hence, many of the usages that obtain\r\naround us, which now excite my surprise, would have passed as a thing of\r\ncourse, had I been always among them.\r\n\r\nOn the “confinement” of a lady,--but I must, before I proceed, define a\r\n_lady_ “of these parts,” by the unerring test of her husband’s\r\nqualifications: if he can maintain his own, and her station in their\r\nlittle world, he is then “well to do,”--“a rich fellow enough, go to--a\r\nfellow that hath had losses, and which is more, a householder; one who\r\nhath two gowns to his back, and every thing handsome about him;”--one\r\nwho recreates in his own gig; keeps a “main” of company; patronises the\r\ntiny theatre; grows his own pines, and tries to coax his forced plants\r\ninto the belief that the three dozen mould candles which he orders to be\r\nlighted in his hot-house every evening, are “shedding delicious\r\n_light_,” left by the “garish god of day,” for their especial benefit,\r\nduring his nocturnal rambles![388] The wife of such a man, sir, I\r\ndesignate a lady and when such a lady’s _accouchement_ takes place, her\r\n“dear five hundred friends” are admitted to see her the next day. In\r\nLondon, the scale of friendship is graduated woefully lower; for\r\nvisiters there, bear the pangs of absence from the interesting recluse\r\na _whole fortnight_.\r\n\r\nYou are, doubtless, anxious to come to the “pith and marrow” of this\r\ncommunication, and I will tantalize you no longer. In “_these_” parts of\r\nthe country, it is the custom, when a lady shall have been “as well as\r\ncan be expected,” for thirteen or fourteen days, for the husband to\r\nenjoy what is called “the gentleman’s party,” viz: all his friends,\r\nbachelor and Benedict, are invited to eat “sugared toast,” which, (as\r\nthe cookery-books always say,) “is thus prepared”--Rounds of bread are\r\n“_baked_,” (videlicit _toasted_,) each stratum spread thick with moist\r\nsugar, and piled up in a portly punch bowl, ready for action: “strong\r\nbeer,” (_anglice_, home-brewed ale,) is in the mean time heated, and\r\npoured boiling hot over the mound of bread; which is taken immediately\r\nto the expectant guests, who quickly come to the conclusion of the\r\ngothic “mess.” How they contrive to emancipate the toast from the\r\nscalding liquid, I never could, by any effort of ingenuity and research,\r\ndecide to my own satisfaction. A goodly slice you know, sir, it would be\r\nentirely impracticable to achieve; for in half a minute from the time of\r\nthe admission of the “hot beer,” the toast must be “all of a swam,” (as\r\nwe elegantly say here,) and, resembling the contents of the witch’s\r\ncauldron, “thick and slab.” Whether a soup ladle and soup plates are in\r\nrequisition on the occasion, I am equally unable to ascertain; but on\r\nthe _final_ dismissal of this gentlemanly food, (for I by no means would\r\ninsinuate that the congregation is limited to one act of devotion,) they\r\nmagnanimously remunerate the “nurse,” by each putting money into the\r\nempty bowl, which is then conveyed to the priestess of their ignoble\r\norgies! Of all the “mean and impotent conclusions” of a feast, defend me\r\nfrom _that_, which pays its “pic nic” pittance to an old crone, who is\r\nhired to attend the behests of the “lady,” but who by some strange\r\nmutation becomes the directress of the “gentleman’s” revels, and the\r\nrecipient of the payment from his guests, for “_sugar’d toast_!”\r\n\r\nShould this “custom,” be thought worthy of being admitted into the\r\n_Every-Day Book_, you will “tell” of something more than Herrick “dreamt\r\nof in his philosophy;” and the following couplet might “blush to find\r\nits fame” among his descriptive lines that adorn your title-page; after\r\n\r\n    “Bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal cakes,”\r\n\r\nmight come--\r\n\r\n    “I tell of times when husbands rule the roast,\r\n    And riot in the joys of ‘sugar’d toast;’\r\n    I tell of groves, &c.”\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n  I.

It\r\nhas, however, another effect often productive of public inconvenience;\r\nfor such are the doubts now entertained as to the goodness of every note\r\ntendered in payment, that many will not give change at all; and the\r\ndisposition to adhere to this practice seems every day to be getting\r\nmore general. In almost every street in town, forged notes are seen\r\nposted on tradesmen’s windows, and not unfrequently this exhibition is\r\naccompanied with the words ‘Tradesmen! beware of changing notes.’ The\r\noperation of stamping the forged notes, was at first performed by the\r\nhand, but now so arduous has this labour become, that a machine is\r\nerected for the purpose, and it would seem from the never-ceasing\r\nquantity of such paper in circulation, that it will be necessary to\r\nerect a steam-engine, so that hundreds may undergo the operation at\r\nonce.”[389]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 51·32.\r\n\r\n  [389] Observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\nGARRICK.\r\n\r\n“Garrick was, and Kemble is no more.”\r\n\r\nOn this day in the year 1741, the “British Roscius,” as he is\r\nemphatically termed, made his first appearance as “a gentleman who never\r\nappeared on any stage.” A remarkable event, precursing the revival of\r\nthe drama, by Garrick, and its perfection by Kemble, deserves notice as\r\na memorial of what “has been:” particularly as we have arrived at a\r\nperiod when, in consequence of managers having been outmanaged, and the\r\npublic tricked out of its senses, the drama seems to have fallen to rise\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Leadenhall-street, October, 1826._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following is a copy of the play-bill that announced the first\r\nappearance of Mr. Garrick.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, yours truly,\r\n\r\n  H.

He says, “the difference in the style of\r\nwrestling of these two neighbouring shires, is as remarkable as that of\r\nthe lineaments of their inhabitants. The florid chubby-faced Devon-man\r\nis all life and activity in the ring, holding himself erect, and\r\noffering every advantage to his opponent. The sallow sharp-featured\r\nCornwall-man is all caution and resistance, bending himself in such a\r\nway, that his legs are inaccessible to his opponent, and waiting for the\r\ncritical instant, when he can spring in upon his impatient adversary.”\r\n\r\nThe account of the matches at the Eagle-tavern then proceeds in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\nThe contest between Abraham Cann and Warren, not only displayed this\r\ndifference of style, but was attended with a degree of suspense between\r\nskill and strength, that rendered it extremely interesting.--The former,\r\nwho is the son of a Devonshire farmer, has been backed against any man\r\nin England for 500_l._ His figure is of the finest athletic proportions,\r\nand his arm realizes the muscularity of ancient specimens: his force in\r\nit is surprising; his hold is like that of a vice, and with ease he can\r\npinion the arms of the strongest adversary, if he once grips them, and\r\nkeep them as close together, or as far asunder, as he chooses. He stands\r\nwith his legs apart, his body quite upright, looking down good\r\nhumouredly on his crouching opponent.--In this instance, his opponent\r\nWarren, a miner, was a man of superior size, and of amazing strength,\r\nnot so well distributed however, throughout his frame; his arms and body\r\nbeing too lengthy in proportion to their bulk. His visage was harsh\r\nbeyond measure, and he did not disdain to use a little craft with eye\r\nand hand, in order to distract his adversary’s attention. But he had to\r\ndeal with a man as collected as ever entered the ring. Cann put in his\r\nhand as quietly as if he were going to seize a shy horse, and at length\r\ncaught a slight hold between finger and thumb of Warren’s sleeve. At\r\nthis, Warren flung away with the impetuosity of a surprised horse. But\r\nit was in vain; there was no escape from Cann’s pinch, so the miner\r\nseized his adversary in his turn, and at length both of them grappled\r\neach other by the arm and breast of the jacket. In a trice Cann tripped\r\nhis opponent with the toe in a most scientific but ineffectual manner,\r\nthrowing him clean to the ground, but not on his back, as required. The\r\nsecond heat began similarly, Warren stooped more, so as to keep his legs\r\nout of Cann’s reach, who punished him for it by several kicks below the\r\nknee, which must have told severely if his shoes had been on, according\r\nto his county’s fashion. They shook each other rudely--strained knee to\r\nknee--forced each other’s shoulders down, so as to overbalance the\r\nbody--but all ineffectually.--They seemed to be quite secure from each\r\nother’s efforts, as long as they but held by the arm and breast-collar,\r\nas ordinary wrestlers do. A new grip was to be effected. Cann liberated\r\none arm of his adversary to seize him by the cape behind: at that\r\ninstant Warren, profiting by his inclined posture, and his long arms,\r\nthrew himself round the body of the Devon champion, and fairly lifted\r\nhim a foot from the ground, clutching him in his arms with the grasp of\r\na second Anteæus.--The Cornish men shouted aloud, “Well done, Warren!”\r\nto their hero, whose naturally pale visage glowed with the hope of\r\nsuccess. He seemed to have his opponent at his will, and to be fit to\r\nfling him, as Hercules flung Lycas, any how he pleased. Devonshire then\r\ntrembled for its champion, and was mute. Indeed it was a moment of\r\nheart-quaking suspense.--But Cann was not daunted; his countenance\r\nexpressed anxiety, but not discomfiture. He was off terra-firma, clasped\r\nin the embrace of a powerful man, who waited but a single struggle of\r\nhis, to pitch him more effectually from him to the ground.--Without\r\nstraining to disengage himself, Cann with unimaginable dexterity glued\r\nhis back firmly to his opponent’s chest, lacing his feet round the\r\nother’s knee-joints, and throwing one arm backward over Warren’s\r\nshoulder, so as to keep his own enormous shoulders pressed upon the\r\nbreast of his uplifter. In this position they stood at least twenty\r\nseconds, each labouring in one continuous strain, to bend the other, one\r\nbackwards, the other forwards.--Such a struggle could not last. Warren,\r\nwith the weight of the other upon his stomach and chest, and an\r\ninconceivable stress upon his spine, felt his balance almost gone, as\r\nthe energetic movements of his countenance indicated.--His feet too were\r\nmotionless by the coil of his adversary’s legs round his; so to save\r\nhimself from falling backwards, he stiffened his whole body from the\r\nankles upwards, and these last being the only liberated joints, he\r\ninclined forwards from them, so as to project both bodies, and prostrate\r\nthem in one column to the ground together.--It was like the slow and\r\npoising fall of an undermined tower.--You had time to contemplate the\r\ninjury which Cann the undermost would sustain if they fell in that\r\nsolid, unbending posture to the earth. But Cann ceased bearing upon the\r\nspine as soon as he found his supporter going in an adverse direction.\r\nWith a presence of mind unrateable, he relaxed his strain upon one of\r\nhis adversary’s stretched legs, forcing the other outwards with all the\r\nmight of his foot, and pressing his elbow upon the opposite shoulder.\r\nThis was sufficient to whisk his man undermost the instant he\r\nunstiffened his knee--which Warren did not do until more than half way\r\nto the ground, when from the acquired rapidity of the falling bodies\r\nnothing was discernible.--At the end of the fall, Warren was seen\r\nsprawling on his back, and Cann whom he had liberated to save himself,\r\nhad been thrown a few yards off on all-fours. Of course the victory\r\nshould have been adjudged to this last. When the partial referree was\r\nappealed to, he decided, that it was not a fair fall, as only one\r\nshoulder had bulged the ground, though there was evidence on the back of\r\nWarren that both had touched it pretty rudely.--After much debating a\r\nnew referree was appointed, and the old one expelled; when the\r\ncandidates again entered the lists. The crowning beauty of the whole\r\nwas, that the second fall was precisely a counterpart of the other.\r\nWarren made the same move, only lifting his antagonist higher, with a\r\nview to throw the upper part of his frame out of play. Cann turned\r\nhimself exactly in the same manner using much greater effort than\r\nbefore, and apparently more put to it, by his opponent’s great strength.\r\nHis share, however, in upsetting his supporter was greater this time, as\r\nhe relaxed one leg much sooner, and adhered closer to the chest during\r\nthe fall; for at the close he was seen uppermost, still coiled round his\r\nsupine adversary, who admitted the fall, starting up, and offering his\r\nhand to the victor. He is a good wrestler too--so good, that we much\r\nquestion the authority of “The Times,” for saying that he is not one of\r\nthe _crack_ wrestlers of Cornwall.--From his amazing strength, with\r\ncommon skill he should be a first-rate man at this play, but his skill\r\nis much greater than his countrymen seemed inclined to admit.--Certain\r\nit is, they destined him the first prize, and had Cann not come up to\r\nsave the honour of his county, for that was his only inducement, the\r\nfour prizes, by judiciously matching the candidates, would no doubt have\r\nbeen given to natives of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKFORD, THE BACKSWORD PLAYER.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--Your correspondent C. T. p. 1207, having given a description of\r\n“Purton Fair,” my grandmother and father born there, the birth-place of\r\nAnne Boleyn, I feel interested in the spot of my progenitors. C. T.,\r\nspeaking of old “Corey Dyne,” the gipsy, says a man named _Blackford_\r\nwas the most noted Backsword-player of his day. He bore off the prizes\r\nthen played for in London, Bath, Bristol, and Gloucester. When very\r\nyoung, at Lyneham grammar-school, I recollect this frontispiece\r\ndespoiler broke fourteen heads, one after another; in the fifteenth\r\nbout, however, he pretty nearly found his match in the person of Isaac\r\nBushel, a blacksmith of this place, who could bite a nail asunder, eat a\r\nshoulder of mutton with appendages, or fight friend or foe for love or\r\nmoney. It was a saying, “Bushel could take enough to kill a dozen men;”\r\nnor was his head unlike his name: he was the village Wat Tyler.\r\n\r\nWhen the Somerset youths played with the Wiltshire on a stage on\r\nCalne-green, two years since, one of Blackford’s descendants gave a\r\nfeeling proof of head-breaking with other heads of this blood-letting\r\nart, in which stratagem is used to conceal the crimson gush chiefly by\r\nsucking. Like fencing, attitude and agility are the great assistants to\r\nensure success in backsword-playing; the basket is also of great service\r\nto the receiving of blows, and protecting the muscles of the wrist. The\r\ngreatest exploits remembered at Purton by the present memorialist,\r\narose out of the “Coronation of George the Third.” All the festivities\r\nof the seasons were concentrated, and May games and Christmas customs,\r\nwithout regard to usage, in full exercise. The belfry was filled day\r\nafter day; any one that could pull a rope might ring, which is no easy\r\ntask; the bells are deep, and two or three men usually raise the tenor.\r\nSome of the Blackfords lie in Purton churchyard.\r\n\r\n  _October 5._\r\n\r\n  *, *, P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe autumnal dress of a man in the fourteenth century is introduced,\r\nfrom the transcript of an illumination, in a manuscript which supplied\r\nthe Spring and Summer dress of that age, before presented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd here as suitable to the season may be subjoined some lines by a\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\nAUTUMNAL FEELINGS.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    The flowers are gone, the trees are bare,\r\n    There is a chillness in the air,\r\n    A damp that in the spirit sinks,\r\n    Till the shudd’ring heart within me shrinks:\r\n    Cold and slow the clouds roll past,\r\n    And wat’ry drops come with the blast\r\n    That moans, amid the poplars tall,\r\n    A dirge for the summer’s funeral.\r\n\r\n    Every bird to his home has gone,\r\n    Save one that loves to sing alone\r\n    The robin;--in yon ruin’d tree\r\n    He warbles sweetly, mournfully\r\n    His shrill note comes upon the wind,\r\n    Like a sound of an unearthly kind;\r\n    He mourns the loss of his sunny bowers,\r\n    And the silent haunts of happy hours.\r\n\r\n    There he sits like a desolate thing,\r\n    With a dabbled breast and a dripping wing,\r\n    He has seen his latent joys decline,\r\n    Yet his heart is lighter far than mine;\r\n    His task is o’er--his duty done,\r\n    His strong-wing’d race on the wind have gone,\r\n    He has nothing left to brood upon;\r\n    He has still the hope of a friendly crumb\r\n    When the wintry snow over earth shall come,\r\n    And a shelter from the biting wind,\r\n    And the welcome looks of faces kind.\r\n\r\n    I wander here amid the blast,\r\n    And a dreary look I backward cast;\r\n    The best of my years I feel are fled,\r\n    And I look to the coming time with dread\r\n    My heart in a desert land has been,\r\n    Where the flower of hope alone was green;\r\n    And little in life’s decline have I\r\n    To expect from kindred’s sympathy.\r\n    Like the leaves now whirl’d from yonder spray,\r\n    The dreams I have cherish’d day by day,\r\n    On the wings of sorrow pass away.\r\n\r\n    Yet I despair not--time will bring\r\n    To the plumeless bird a new bright wing,\r\n    A warmer breeze to the now chill’d flower,\r\n    And to those who mourn a lighter hour;\r\n    A gay green leaf to the faded tree,\r\n    And happier days, I trust, to me.\r\n    ‘Twas best that the weeds of sorrow sprung\r\n    With my heart’s few flowers, while yet ’twas young,\r\n    They can the sooner be destroy’d,\r\n    And happiness fill their dreary void.\r\n\r\n  S.

I visited the spot about a week ago, and can therefore vouch\r\nfor its existence up to that time, but every thing around it begins to\r\nbear a very different aspect to what it did about two years back, when\r\nmy attention was particularly called to the spot from having read Dr.\r\nStukeley’s remarks on the subject. At that time I was able to trace\r\nseveral other vestiges, which are entirely destroyed by the ground\r\nhaving been since dug up for the purpose of making bricks.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are taken from the second volume of Dr.\r\nStukeley’s “Itinerary.” The plan of the camp is taken from the same\r\nwork. I shall feel pleasure if you will call attention to it, as you\r\nhave already to the Roman remains at Pentonville.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n  S. G.\r\n\r\n  _October 9, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. STUKELEY’S ACCOUNT OF CÆSAR’S CAMP.\r\n\r\n  _October, 1758._\r\n\r\nCæsar’s camp was situate where Pancras church is--his prætorium is still\r\nvery plain--over against the church, in the footpath on the west side of\r\nthe brook; the vallum and the ditch visible; its breadth from east to\r\nwest forty paces, its length from north to south sixty paces. When I\r\ncame attentively to consider the situation of it, and the circumjacent\r\nground, I easily discerned the traces of his whole camp. A great many\r\nditches or divisions of the pastures retain footsteps of the plan of the\r\ncamp, agreeable to their usual form, as in the plate engraved; and\r\nwhenever I take a walk thither, I enjoy a visionary scene of the whole\r\ncamp of Cæsar as described in the plate before us; a scene just as if\r\nbeheld, and Cæsar present.\r\n\r\nHis army consisted of forty thousand men. Four legions with his horse.\r\nThe camp is in length five hundred paces--the thirty paces beyond, for\r\nthe way between the tents and vallum, (where a vallum is made,) amounts\r\nto five hundred and sixty; so that the proportion of length to breadth\r\nis as three to two.\r\n\r\nThis space of ground was sufficient for Cæsar’s army according to Roman\r\ndiscipline, for if he had forty thousand men, a third part of them were\r\nupon guard.\r\n\r\nThe front of the camp is bounded by a spring with a little current of\r\nwater running from the west, across the Brill, into the Fleet brook.\r\nThis Brill was the occasion of the road directly from the city,\r\noriginally going alongside the brook by Bagnigge; the way to Highgate\r\nbeing at first by Copenhagen-house, which is straight road thither from\r\nGray’s-inn-lane.\r\n\r\nThis camp has the brook running quite through the middle of it: it\r\narises from seven springs on the south side of the hill between\r\nHampstead and Highgate by Caen wood, where it forms several large ponds,\r\npasses by here by the name of Fleet, washes the west side of the city of\r\nLondon, and gives name to Fleet-street. This brook was formerly called\r\nthe river of wells, from the many springs above, which our ancestors\r\ncalled wells; and it may be thought to have been more considerable in\r\nformer times than at present, for now the major part of its water is\r\ncarried off in pipes to furnish Kentish-town, Pancras, and\r\nTottenham-court; but even now in great rains the valley is covered over\r\nwith water. Go a quarter of a mile higher towards Kentish-town and you\r\nmay have a just notion of its appearance at that place, only with this\r\ndifference, that it is there broader and deeper from the current of so\r\nmany years. It must further be considered that the channel of this brook\r\nthrough so many centuries, and by its being made the public north road\r\nfrom London to Highgate, is very much lowered and widened since Cæsar’s\r\ntime. It was then no sort of embarrassment to the camp, but an admirable\r\nconvenience for watering, being contained in narrow banks not deep. The\r\nbreadth and length are made by long tract of time. The ancient road by\r\nCopenhagen wanting repair, induced passengers to make this gravelly\r\nvalley become much larger than in Cæsar’s time. The old division runs\r\nalong that road between Finsbury and Holborn division, going in a\r\nstraight line from Gray’s-inn-lane to Highgate: its antiquity is shown\r\nin its name--Madan-lane.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of this noble antiquity will give pleasure to a British\r\nantiquary, especially an inhabitant of London, whereof it is a singular\r\nglory. It renders the walk over the beautiful fields to the Brill doubly\r\nagreeable, when at half a mile distance we can tread in the very steps\r\nof the Roman camp master, and of the greatest of the Roman generals.\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder that the traces of this camp so near the metropolis\r\nare so nearly worn out; we may rather wonder that so much is left, when\r\na proper sagacity in these matters may discern them, and be assured that\r\nsomewhat more than three or four sorry houses are commemorated under the\r\nname of the Brill, (_now called Brill-place-Terrace_;) nor is it\r\nunworthy of remark, as an evident confirmation of our system, that all\r\nthe ditches and fences now upon the ground, have a manifest respect to\r\nthe principal members of the original plan of the camp.\r\n\r\nIn this camp Cæsar made the two British kings friends--Casvelham and his\r\nnephew Mandubrace.\r\n\r\nI judge I have performed my promise in giving an account of this\r\ngreatest curiosity, so illustrious a monument of the greatest of the\r\nRoman generals, which has withstood the waste of time for more than\r\neighteen centuries, and passed unnoticed but half a mile off the\r\nmetropolis. I shall only add this observation, that when I came to\r\nsurvey this plot of ground to make a map of it by pacing, I found every\r\nwhere even and great numbers, and what I have often formerly observed in\r\nRoman works; whence we may safely affirm the Roman camp master laid out\r\nhis works by pacing.[393]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the hope that the preceding article may draw attention to the\r\nsubject, the editor defers remark till he has been favoured with\r\ncommunications from other hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUARY.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written by an old and particular friend of the\r\nerudite individual who received them:--\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD GOUGH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_O tu severi Religio loci!_\r\n\r\n    Hail, genius of this littered study!\r\n      Or tell what name you most delight in\r\n    For sure where all the ink is muddy,\r\n      And no clean margin left to write in,\r\n          No common deity resides.\r\n    We see, we feel thy power divine,\r\n      In every tattered folio’s dust,\r\n    Each mangled manuscript is thine,\r\n      And thine the antique helmet’s rust.\r\n          Nor less observed thy power presides\r\n    Where plundered brasses crowd the floor,\r\n      Or dog’s-eared drawings burst their binding\r\n    Hid by Confusion’s puzzling door\r\n      Beyond the reach of mortal finding.\r\n    Than if beneath a costly roof\r\n      Each moulding edged by golden fillet,\r\n    The Russian binding, insect proof,\r\n      Blushed at the foppery of ------\r\n    Give me, when tired by dust and sun,\r\n      If rightly I thy name invoke,\r\n    The bustle of the town to shun,\r\n      And breathe unvext by city smoke.\r\n    But, ah! if from these cobwebbed walls,\r\n      And from this moth-embroidered cushion,\r\n    Too fretful Fortune rudely calls,\r\n      Resolved the cares of life to push on--\r\n    Give me at least to pass my age\r\n      At ease in some book-tapestried cell,\r\n    Where I may turn the pictured page,\r\n      Nor start at visitants’ loud bell.[394]\r\n\r\n  [392] Sykes’s Local Records, p. 79.\r\n\r\n  [393] Dr. Stukeley’s Itinerary.\r\n\r\n  [394] Dr. Porster’s Perennial Calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 23.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST. SURIN.\r\n\r\nSt. Surin, or St. Severin, which is his proper name, is a saint held in\r\ngreat veneration at Bordeaux; he is considered as one of the great\r\npatrons of the town. It was his native place, but he deserted it for a\r\ntime to go and preach the gospel at Cologne. When he returned, St.\r\nAmand, then bishop of Bordeaux, went out with a solemn procession of the\r\nclergy to meet him, and, as he had been warned to do in a vision,\r\nresigned his bishopric to him, which St. Surin continued to enjoy as\r\nlong as he lived. St. Amand continued at Bordeaux as a private person;\r\nbut surviving St. Surin, he was at his death restored to the station\r\nfrom which he had descended with so much gentleness and resignation. It\r\nis among the traditions of the church of St. Surin at Bordeaux, that the\r\ncemetery belonging to it was “consecrated by Jesus Christ himself,\r\naccompanied by seven bishops, who were afterwards canonized, and were\r\nthe founders of the principal churches in Aquitaine.”[395]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn an oval marble in Egham church, Surrey, are the following lines\r\nwritten by David Garrick, to the memory of the Reverend Mr. Thomas\r\nBeighton who was vicar of that church forty-five years, and died on the\r\n23d of October, 1771, aged 73.\r\n\r\nEPITAPH.\r\n\r\n    Near half an age, with every good man’s praise,\r\n    Among his flock the shepherd passed his days;\r\n    The friend, the comfort, of the sick and poor,\r\n    Want never knock’d unheeded at his door.\r\n    Oft when his duty call’d, disease and pain\r\n    Strove to confine him, but they strove in vain.\r\n    All mourn his death: his virtues long they try’d:\r\n    They knew not how they lov’d him till he died.\r\n    Peculiar blessings did his life attend:\r\n    He had no foe, and _Camden_ was his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·00.\r\n\r\n  [395] Miss Plumptre.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 24.~\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OCTOBER SUNDAY MORNING IN COCKNEYSHIRE.\r\n\r\n  _For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n  “Vat’s the _time_, Villiam?”\r\n\r\n  “_Kevarter arter_ seven.”\r\n\r\nThe “Mirror of the Months” seems to reflect every object to the reader’s\r\neye; but not having read more of that work than by extract, in the\r\n_Every-Day Book_, I think an addendum, _par hazard_, may not be without\r\ntruth and interest.\r\n\r\nRise early,--be abroad,--and after you have inspired sufficient fog to\r\nkeep you coughing all day, you will see Jewboys and girls with their\r\nfathers and mothers veering forth from the purlieus of Houndsditch with\r\nsweetmeats, “ten a penny!” which information is sung, or said, ten\r\nthousand times before sunset.

The instrument for\r\ncleaning hides, the shoemaker’s bristles added to the yarn, and his\r\nknife, were as early as the twelfth century. He was accustomed to hawk\r\nhis goods, and it is conjectured that there was a separate trade for\r\nannexing the soles.[399] The Romans in classical times, wore cork soles\r\nin their shoes to secure the feet from water, especially in winter; and\r\nas high heels were not then introduced, the Roman ladies who wished to\r\nappear taller than they had been formed by nature, put plenty of cork\r\nunder them.[400] The streets of Rome in the time of Domitian were\r\nblocked up by cobblers’ stalls, which he therefore caused to be removed.\r\nIn the middle ages shoes were cleaned by washing with a sponge; and oil,\r\nsoap, and grease, were the substitutes for blacking. Buckles were worn\r\nin shoes in the fourteenth century. In an Irish abbey a human skeleton\r\nwas found with marks of buckles on the shoes. In England they became\r\nfashionable many years before the reign of queen Mary; the labouring\r\npeople wore them of copper; other persons had them of silver, or\r\ncopper-gilt; not long after shoe-roses came in.[401] Buckles revived\r\nbefore the revolution of 1689, remained fashionable till after the\r\nFrench revolution in 1789; and finally became extinct before the close\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Robert Hegg’s “Legend of St. Cuthbert,” reprinted at the end of Mr.\r\nDixon’s “Historical and Descriptive View of the city of Durham and its\r\nEnvirons,” we are told of St. Goodrick, that “in his younger age he was\r\na pedlar, and carried his moveable shop from fair to fair upon his\r\nback,” and used to visit Lindisfarne, “much delighting to heare the\r\nmonkes tell wonders of St. Cuthbert; which soe enflamed his devotion,\r\nthat he undertooke a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre; and by the advice\r\nof St. Cuthbert in a dreame, repayred againe to the holy land, and\r\nwashing his feete in Jordan, there left his _shoes_, with a vow to goe\r\nbarefoot all his life after.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 47·87.\r\n\r\n  [398] See vol. i. col. 1395.\r\n\r\n  [399] Fosbroke’s Ency. of Antiquities.\r\n\r\n  [400] Beckmann.\r\n\r\n  [401] Fosbroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 26.~\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL DEBTS.\r\n\r\nOn this subject a curious notice is extracted from “the Postman, October\r\n26-28, 1708”--viz.\r\n\r\n_Advertisement._\r\n\r\nThe Creditors of King Charles, K.

It is so delightfully written, as to\r\nrivet the attention of every reader whether mariner or landsman.\r\n\r\n“The death of Nelson was felt in England as something more than a public\r\ncalamity: men started at the intelligence, and turned pale, as if they\r\nhad heard of the loss of a dear friend. An object of our admiration and\r\naffection, of our pride and of our hopes, was suddenly taken from us;\r\nand it seemed as if we had never, till then, known how deeply we loved\r\nand reverenced him. What the country had lost in its great naval\r\nhero--the greatest of our own, and of all former times--was scarcely\r\ntaken into the account of grief. So perfectly, indeed, had he performed\r\nhis part, that the maritime war, after the battle of Trafalgar, was\r\nconsidered at an end: the fleets of the enemy were not merely defeated,\r\nbut destroyed: new navies must be built, and a new race of seamen reared\r\nfor them, before the possibility of their invading our shores could\r\nagain be contemplated. It was not, therefore, from any selfish\r\nreflection upon the magnitude of our loss that we mourned for him: the\r\ngeneral sorrow was of a higher character. The people of England grieved\r\nthat funeral ceremonies, public monuments, and posthumous rewards, were\r\nall which they could now bestow upon him, whom the king, the\r\nlegislature, and the nation, would alike have delighted to honour; whom\r\nevery tongue would have blessed; whose presence in every village through\r\nwhich he might have passed would have awakened the church bells, have\r\ngiven schoolboys a holiday, have drawn children from their sports to\r\ngaze upon him, and ‘old men from the chimney corner’ to look upon\r\nNelson, ere they died. The victory of Trafalgar was celebrated, indeed,\r\nwith the usual forms of rejoicing, but they were without joy; for such\r\nalready was the glory of the British navy, through Nelson’s surpassing\r\ngenius, that it scarcely seemed to receive any addition from the most\r\nsignal victory that ever was achieved upon the seas: and the destruction\r\nof this mighty fleet, by which all the maritime schemes of France were\r\ntotally frustrated, hardly appeared to add to our security or strength;\r\nfor while Nelson was living, to watch the combined squadrons of the\r\nenemy, we felt ourselves as secure as now, when they were no longer in\r\nexistence.--There was reason to suppose, from the appearances upon\r\nopening the body, that, in the course of nature, he might have attained,\r\nlike his father, to a good old age. Yet he cannot be said to have fallen\r\nprematurely whose work was done; nor ought he to be lamented, who died\r\nso full of honours, and at the height of human fame. The most triumphant\r\ndeath is that of the martyr; the most awful, that of the martyred\r\npatriot; the most splendid, that of the hero in the hour of victory: and\r\nif the chariot and the horses of fire had been vouchsafed for Nelson’s\r\ntranslation, he could scarcely have departed in a brighter blaze of\r\nglory.”[402]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·25.\r\n\r\n  [402] Southey’s Life of Nelson.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 27.~\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEET MARKET.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of October, 1736, Mr. Robinson a carpenter, and Mr. Medway a\r\nbricklayer, contracted to build Fleet-market, by the following\r\nmidsummer, for 3970_l._[403]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 47·50.\r\n\r\n  [403] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 28.~\r\n\r\n(St. Simon and St. Jude.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“WARDENS!”\r\n\r\nA correspondent says, that about, or before this time, it is the custom\r\nat Bedford, now abouts, for boys to cry baked pears in the town with the\r\nfollowing stanza--\r\n\r\n    “Who knows what I have got?\r\n    In a pot hot?\r\n    Baked _Wardens_--all hot!\r\n    Who knows what I have got?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 46·30.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 29.~\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nOn looking into the “Mirror of the Months,” we find “a lively\r\nportraiture” of the season.--“October is to London what April is to the\r\ncountry; it is the spring of the London summer, when the hopes of the\r\nshopkeeper begin to bud forth, and he lays aside the insupportable\r\nlabour of having nothing to do, for the delightful leisure of preparing\r\nto be in a perpetual bustle. During the last month or two he has been\r\nstrenuously endeavouring to persuade himself that the Steyne at Brighton\r\nis as healthy as Bond-street; the _pavé_ of Pall Mall no more\r\npicturesque than the Pantiles of Tunbridge Wells; and winning a prize at\r\none-card-loo at Margate, as piquant a process as serving a customer to\r\nthe same amount of profit. But now that the time is returned when\r\n‘business’ must again be attended to, he discards with contempt all such\r\nmischievous heresies, and reembraces the only orthodox faith of a London\r\nshopkeeper--that London and his shop are the true ‘beauteous and\r\nsublime’ of human life. In fact, ‘now is the winter of his discontent’\r\n(that is to say, what other people call summer) ‘made glorious summer’\r\nby the near approach of winter; and all the wit he is master of is put\r\nin requisition, to devise the means of proving that every thing he has\r\noffered to ‘his friends the public,’ up to this particular period, has\r\nbecome worse than obsolete. Accordingly, now are those poets of the\r\nshopkeepers, the inventors of patterns, ‘perplexed in the extreme;\r\nsince, unless they can produce a something which shall necessarily\r\nsupersede all their previous productions, their occupation’s gone.--It\r\nis the same with all other caterers for the public taste; even the\r\nliterary ones. Mr. Elliston, [or his fortunate successor, if one there\r\nbe,] ‘ever anxious to contribute to the amusement of his liberal\r\npatrons, the public,’ is already busied in sowing the seeds of a new\r\ntragedy, two operatic romances, three grand romantic melo-dramas, and\r\nhalf a dozen farces, in the fertile soil of those poets whom he employs\r\nin each of these departments respectively; while each of the London\r\npublishers is projecting a new ‘periodical,’ to appear on the first of\r\nJanuary next; that which he started on the first of last January having,\r\nof course, died of old age ere this!”\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF “FIRES.”\r\n\r\nIn October, fires have fairly gained possession of their places, and\r\neven greet us on coming down to breakfast in the morning. Of all the\r\ndiscomforts of that most comfortless period of the London year which is\r\nneither winter nor summer, the most unequivocal is that of its being too\r\ncold to be without a fire, and not cold enough to have one. A set of\r\npolished fire-irons, standing sentry beside a pile of dead coals\r\nimprisoned behind a row of glittering bars, instead of mending the\r\nmatter, makes it worse; inasmuch as it is better to look into an empty\r\ncoffin, than to see the dead face of a friend in it. At the season in\r\nquestion, especially in the evening, one feels in a perpetual\r\nperplexity, whether to go out or stay at home; sit down or walk about;\r\nread, write, cast accounts, or call for the candle and go to bed. But\r\nlet the fire be lighted, and all uncertainty is at an end, and we (or\r\neven one) may do any or all of these with equal satisfaction. In short,\r\nlight but the fire, and you bring the winter in at once; and what are\r\ntwenty summers, with all their sunshine (when they are gone,) to one\r\nwinter, with its indoor sunshine of a sea-coal fire?[404]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Leigh Hunt, who on the affairs of “The Months” is our first\r\nauthority, pleasantly inquires--“With our fire before us, and our books\r\non each side, what shall we do? Shall we take out a life of somebody, or\r\na Theocritus, or Dante, or Ariosto, or Montaigne, or Marcus Aurelius, or\r\nHorace, or Shakspeare who includes them all? Or shall we read an\r\nengraving from Poussin or Raphael? Or shall we sit with tilted chairs,\r\nplanting our wrists upon our knees, and toasting the up-turned palms of\r\nour hands, while we discourse of manners and of man’s heart and hopes,\r\nwith at least a sincerity, a good intention, and good nature, that shall\r\nwarrant what we say with the sincere, the good-intentioned, and the\r\ngood-natured?”--He then agreeably brings us to the _mantlepiece_.\r\n“Ah--take care. You see what that old looking saucer is, with a handle\r\nto it? It is a venerable piece of earthenware, which may have been\r\nworth, to an Athenian, about twopence; but to an author, is worth a\r\ngreat deal more than ever he could--deny for it. And yet he would deny\r\nit too. It will fetch his imagination more than ever it fetched potter\r\nor penny-maker. Its little shallow circle overflows for him with the\r\nmilk and honey of a thousand pleasant associations. This is one of the\r\nuses of having mantlepieces. You may often see on no very rich\r\nmantlepiece a representative body of all the elements, physical and\r\nintellectual,--a shell for the sea, a stuffed bird or some feathers for\r\nthe air, a curious piece of mineral for the earth, a glass of water with\r\nsome flowers in it for the visible process of creation,--a cast from\r\nsculpture for the mind of man;--and underneath all, is the bright and\r\never-springing fire, running up through them heavenwards, like hope\r\nthrough materiality.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 46·02.\r\n\r\n  [404] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 30.~\r\n\r\n\r\nYEOMEN OF THE GUARD.\r\n\r\nOn this day in the year 1485, when king Henry VII. was crowned at\r\nWestminster, he instituted the body of royal attendants, called yeomen\r\nof the guard, who in later times acquired the appellation of\r\n“beef-eaters.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 47·17.\r\n\r\n\r\n~October 31.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHALLOW EVE.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious observances of this night, described in the former\r\nvolume, are fast disappearing.

It is not difficult to conceive why this\r\nsight should make the heart of the schoolboy leap with an imaginative\r\njoy, as it brings before his eyes visions of five blue eggs lying\r\nsweetly beside each other, on a bed of moss and feathers; or as many\r\ngaping bills lifting themselves from out what seems one callow body. But\r\nwe are, unhappily, not all schoolboys; and it is to be hoped not many of\r\nus ever _have been_ bird-nesting ones. And yet we all look upon this\r\nsight with a momentary interest, that few other so indifferent objects\r\nare capable of exciting. The wise may condescend to explain this\r\ninterest, if they please, or if they can.

Almost\r\nall, however, even of those singing-birds that do not migrate, except\r\nthe redbreast, wren, hedge-sparrow, and titmouse, disappear shortly\r\nafter the commencement of this month, and go no one knows whither. But\r\nthe pert house-sparrow keeps possession of the garden and courtyard all\r\nthe winter; and the different species of wagtails may be seen busily\r\nhaunting the clear cold spring-heads, and wading into the unfrozen water\r\nin search of their delicate food, consisting of insects in the _aurelia_\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, the _farmer_ finishes all his out-of-door work before the frosts\r\nset in, and lays by his implements till the awakening of spring calls\r\nhim to his hand-labour again.\r\n\r\nNow, the _sheep_, all their other more natural food failing, begin to be\r\npenned on patches of the turnip-field, where they first devour the green\r\ntops joyfully, and then gradually hollow out the juicy root, holding it\r\nfirm with their feet, till nothing is left but the dry brown husk.\r\n\r\nNow, the _herds_ stand all day long hanging their disconsolate heads\r\nbeside the leafless hedges, and waiting as anxiously, but as patiently\r\ntoo, to be called home to the hay-fed stall, as they do in summer to be\r\ndriven afield.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, cold _rains_ come deluging down, till the drenched ground, the\r\ndripping trees, the pouring eaves, and the torn ragged-skirted clouds,\r\nseemingly dragged downward slantwise by the threads of dusky rain that\r\ndescend from them, are all mingled together in one blind confusion;\r\nwhile the few cattle that are left in the open pastures, forgetful of\r\ntheir till now interminable business of feeding, turn their backs upon\r\nthe besieging storm, and hanging down their heads till their noses\r\nalmost touch the ground, stand out in the middle of the fields\r\nmotionless, like dead images.\r\n\r\nNow, too, a single rain-storm, like the above, breaks up all the paths\r\nand ways at once, and makes home no longer “home” to those who are not\r\nobliged to leave it; while, _en revance_, it becomes doubly endeared to\r\nthose who are.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_London_ is so perfect an antithesis to the country in all things, that\r\nwhatever is good for the one is bad for the other. Accordingly, as the\r\ncountry half forgets itself this month, so London just begins to know\r\nitself again.--Its streets revive from their late suspended animation,\r\nand are alive with anxious faces and musical with the mingled sounds of\r\nmany wheels.\r\n\r\nNow, the shops begin to shine out with their new winter wares; though as\r\nyet the chief profits of their owners depend on disposing of the “summer\r\nstock,” at fifty per cent. under prime cost.\r\n\r\nNow, the theatres, admonished by their no longer empty benches, try\r\nwhich shall be the first to break through that hollow truce on the\r\nstrength of which they have hitherto been acting only on alternate\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nNow, during the first week, the citizens see visions and dream dreams,\r\nthe burthens of which are barons of beef; and the first eight days are\r\npassed in a state of pleasing perplexity, touching their chance of a\r\nticket for the lord mayor’s dinner on the ninth.\r\n\r\nNow, all the little boys give thanks in their secret hearts to Guy Faux,\r\nfor having attempted to burn “the parliament” with “gunpowder, treason,\r\nand plot,” since the said attempt gives them occasion to burn every\r\nthing they can lay their hands on,--their own fingers included: a\r\nbonfire being, in the eyes of an English schoolboy, the true “beauteous\r\nand sublime of human life.”\r\n\r\nODE TO WINTER.\r\n\r\n_By a Gentleman of Cambridge._\r\n\r\n    From mountains of eternal snow,\r\n      And Zembla’s dreary plains;\r\n    Where the bleak winds for ever blow\r\n      And frost for ever reigns,\r\n\r\n    Lo!

Have you forgot our proclamation\r\nagainst images, pictures, and Romish relics in churches? Was it not read\r\nin your deanery?\r\n\r\n_D._ It was read. But be your majesty assured, I meant no harm, when I\r\ncaused the cuts to be bound with the service-book.\r\n\r\n_Q._ You must needs be very ignorant, to do this after our prohibition\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n_D._ It being my ignorance, your majesty may the better pardon me.\r\n\r\n_Q._ I am sorry for it: yet glad to hear it was your ignorance, rather\r\nthan your opinion.\r\n\r\n_D._ Be your majesty assured it was my ignorance.\r\n\r\n_Q._ If so, Mr. Dean, God grant you his Spirit, and more wisdom for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n_D._ Amen, I pray God.\r\n\r\n_Q._ I pray, Mr. Dean, how came you by these pictures?--Who engraved\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n_D._ I know not who engraved them,--I bought them.\r\n\r\n_Q._ From whom bought you them?\r\n\r\n_D._ From a German.\r\n\r\n_Q._ It is well it was from a stranger. Had it been any of our subjects,\r\nwe should have questioned the matter. Pray let no more of these\r\nmistakes, or of this kind, be committed within the churches of our realm\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\n_D._ There shall not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols, after inserting the preceding dialogue, in “Queen\r\nElizabeth’s Progresses,” remarks--\r\n\r\n“This matter occasioned all the clergy in and about London, and the\r\nchurchwardens of each parish, to search their churches and chapels: and\r\ncaused them to wash out of the walls all paintings that seemed to be\r\nRomish and idolatrous; and in lieu thereof suitable texts, taken out of\r\nthe holy scriptures, to be written.”\r\n\r\nSimilar inscriptions had been previously adopted: the effect of the\r\nqueen’s disapprobation of pictured representations was to increase the\r\nnumber of painted texts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Smith observes, that of these sacred sentences there were\r\nseveral within memory in the old church of Paddington, now pulled down;\r\nand also in the little old one of Clapham.\r\n\r\nIn an inside view of Ambleside church, painted by George Arnald, Esq. A.\r\nR. A. he has recorded several, which are particularly appropriate to\r\ntheir stations; for instance, that over the door admonishes the comers\r\nin; that above the pulpit exhorts the preacher to spare not his\r\ncongregation; and another within sight of the singers, encourages them\r\nto offer praises to the Lord on high. These inscriptions have sometimes\r\none line written in black, and the next in red; in other instances the\r\nfirst letter of each line is of a bright blue, green, or red. They are\r\nfrequently surrounded by painted imitations of frames or scrolls, held\r\nup by boys painted in ruddle. It was the custom in earlier times to\r\nwrite them in French, with the first letter of the line considerably\r\nlarger than the rest, and likewise of a bright colour curiously\r\nornamented. Several of these were discovered in 1801, on the ceiling of\r\na closet on the south side of the Painted Chamber, Westminster, now\r\nblocked up.\r\n\r\nOthers of a subsequent date, of the reign of Edward III. in Latin, were\r\nvisible during the recent alterations of the house of commons,\r\nbeautifully written in the finest jet black, with the first letters also\r\nof bright and different colours.\r\n\r\nHogarth, in his print of the sleeping congregation, has satirized this\r\nkind of church embellishments, by putting a tobacco pipe in the mouth of\r\nthe angel who holds up the scroll; and illustrates the usual ignorance\r\nof country art, by giving three joints to one of his legs. The custom of\r\nputting up sacred sentences is still continued in many churches, but\r\nthey are generally written in letters of gold upon black grounds, within\r\nthe pannels of the fronts of the galleries.[406]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 48·00.\r\n\r\n  [405] See vol. 1. col. 1421.\r\n\r\n  [406] Mr. J.

Mr. Peter Beckford was father of the\r\ncelebrated alderman Beckford, whose fortune enabled him to purchase the\r\nlanded estate of the Meroyns in Wiltshire, which, till lately, formed a\r\ndistinguished part of the possessions of the present Mr. Beckford.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA correspondent communicates a pleasant account of a wake in Wiltshire,\r\nduring the present month.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLACK FALL FAIR.\r\n\r\n    “See, neighbours, what Joe Ody’s doing.”\r\n\r\nThe township of Clack stands on an eminence which gives a view of twenty\r\nmiles round a part of the most beautiful county of Wilts.[409] Clack is\r\nattached to Bradenstoke-priory, remarkable for its forest, and the\r\nreception of the monks of St. Augustine. Many vestiges remain of the\r\nsplendour of this abbey, which is now a large farm, and stone coffins\r\nhave been found here. A carpenter in this neighbourhood recently digging\r\na hole for the post to a gate, struck his spade against a substance\r\nwhich proved to be gold, and weighed two ounces: it was the image of a\r\nmonk in the posture of prayer, with a a book open before him. A\r\nsubterraneous passage once led from this place to Malmsbury-abbey, a\r\ndistance of seven miles. At this ruin, when a boy, I was shown the stone\r\nupon which the blood is said to have been spilt by a school-master, who,\r\nin a passion, killed his pupil with a penknife.\r\n\r\nClack spring and fall Fairs were well attended formerly. They were held\r\nfor horses, pigs, cows, oxen, sheep, and shows; but especially for the\r\n“hiring servants.” Hamlet’s words,--“Oh, what a _fall_ing off is here!”\r\nmay not inappropriately be applied. Old Michaelmas-day is the time the\r\nfall fair is kept, but, really, every thing which constitutes a fair,\r\nseemed this year to be absent. A few farmers strolled up and down the\r\nmain street in their boots, and took refuge in the hospitable houses; a\r\nfew rustics waited about the “Mop” or “Statue” in their clean frocks\r\ntwisted round their waists with their best clothes on; a few sellers of\r\ncattle looked round for customers, with the _pike_ tickets in their\r\nhats; and a few maid servants placed themselves in a corner to be hired:\r\nhere, there was no want of _Clack_, for many were raised in stature by\r\ntheir pattens and rather towering bonnets; and a few agriculturists’\r\ndaughters and dames, in whom neither scarcity of money nor apparel were\r\nvisible, came prancing into the courts of their friends and alighting at\r\nthe uppingstocks, and dashed in among the company with true spirit and\r\n_bon hommie_.\r\n\r\nClack fair was worth gazing at a few years ago. When Joe Ody,[410] the\r\n_stultum ingenium_, obtained leave to _show_ forth in the Blindhouse by\r\nconjuring rings off women’s fingers, and finding them in men’s pockets,\r\neating fire and drawing yards of ribands out of his mouth, giving\r\nshuffling tricks with cards, to ascertain how much money was in the\r\nploughman’s yellow purse, cutting off cock’s heads, pricking in the\r\ngarter for love tokens, giving a chance at the “black cock or the white\r\ncock,” and lastly, raising the devil, who carries off the cheating\r\nparish baker upon his back. These, indeed, were fine opportunities for\r\nold women to talk about, when leaning over the hatch of the front door,\r\nto gossip with their ready neighbours in the same position opposite,\r\nwhile their goodmen of the house, sat in the porch chuckling with “pipe\r\nin one hand and jug in the other.” Then the “learned dog” told person’s\r\nnames by _letters_; and here I discovered the secret of this canine\r\nsapiency, the master twitched his thumb and finger for the letter at\r\nwhich the dog stopped. I posed, master and dog, however, by giving my\r\nchristian name “Jehoiada.” A word no fair scholar could readily spell;\r\nthis shook the faith of many gaping disciples. The “poney” too was\r\ngreatly admired for telling which lassie loved her morning bed, which\r\nwould be first married, and which youth excelled in kissing a girl in a\r\nsly corner. The being “ground _young_ again,” no less enlivened the\r\nspirits of maiden aunts, and the seven tall single sisters; then the\r\npelican put its beak on the child’s head for a night cap, and the\r\nmonkeys and bears looked, grimaced and danced, to the three dogs in red\r\njackets, with short pipes in their mouths; and the “climbing cat”\r\nascended the “maypole,” and returned into its master’s box at a word.\r\nThis year’s attractions chiefly were three booths for gingerbread and\r\nhard ware--a raree show! a blind fidler--the E. O. table--the birds,\r\nrats, and kittens in one cage--and a song sung here and there, called\r\nthe “Bulleyed Farmers,” attributed to Bowles of Bremhill, but who\r\ndisclaimed like Coleridge, the authorship of a satiric production.\r\n\r\nThus, fairs, amusements and the works of mortals, pass away--one age\r\ndies, another comes in its stead--but who will secure the sports of\r\nancestry inviolate? who search into the workings of the illiterate, and\r\nhand them down to posterity, without the uncertain communication of oral\r\ntradition, which often obscures the light intended to be conveyed for\r\ninformation.--Thanks be to the art of printing, to the cultivation of\r\nreading, and the desire which accompanies both.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 44·40.\r\n\r\n  [408] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n  [409] There is a very old stanza known here, which though it gives no\r\n  favourable mention of Clack, couples many surrounding places well\r\n  known--\r\n\r\n    “White Cliff--Pepper Cliff--Cliff and Cliff Ancey,\r\n    Lyneham and lo--e Clack,\r\n    C--se Malford[411] and Dauncey.”\r\n\r\n  [410] A native of this part, and at the top of _Merry-Andrewism_.\r\n\r\n  [411] Christian Malford, no doubt, was a _bad_ ford for the monks that\r\n  came down the Avon to the surrounding abbeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nKING WILLIAM LANDED.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for the commemoration of the landing of king\r\nWilliam III. (who in fact landed on the 5th[412]) it may be worth\r\nnotice, that its centenary in 1788 is thus mentioned in the “Public\r\nAdvertiser” of that year--“This day is appointed to commemorate an\r\nevent, which, if deserving commemoration, ought _never_ to be forgotten,\r\nand yet it is probable it will produce as much good moral or political\r\neffect as the events which distinguish Christmas, Good Friday, or\r\nEaster, from other days of the year. However, we are not disposed to\r\nquarrel with the scheme, the events of a day are few, the remembrance\r\ncannot be long. In the City, in Westminster, and in many of the\r\nprincipal towns in England, societies have been formed, cards of\r\ninvitation sent, sold and bought, and grand dinners are prepared, and\r\nhave this day been devoured with keen revolution appetites. Not to\r\nexclude the females, in some places balls are given; and that the\r\nreligious may not wholly be disappointed, revolution sermons were this\r\nmorning preached in several chapels and meeting-houses. Scotland is not\r\nbehind hand in zeal upon this occasion, although a little so in point of\r\ntime. To-morrow is their day of commemoration. Over all the kingdom a\r\nday of thanksgiving is appointed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKING WILLIAM’S PEERS.\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe essential services of king William III. to the cause of civil and\r\nreligious liberty, his perseverance and prowess as a warrior, his\r\nshrewdness and dexterity as a statesman, adapting the most conciliatory\r\nmeans to the most patriotic ends, have been repeatedly dilated on, and\r\ngenerally acknowledged. Here, is merely purposed to be traced how he\r\nexercised one of the most exclusive, important, and durable prerogatives\r\nof an English monarch, by a brief recapitulation of such of his\r\nadditions and promotions in the hereditory branch of our legislature as\r\nstill are in existence.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor of the duke of Portland was count Bentinck, a Dutchman, of\r\na family still of note in Holland; he had been page of honour to king\r\nWilliam, when he was only prince of Orange. He made him groom of the\r\nstole, privy purse, a lieutenant-general in the British army, colonel of\r\na regiment of Dutch horse in the British pay, one of the privy-council,\r\nmaster of the horse, baron of Cirencester, viscount Woodstock, and earl\r\nof Portland, and afterwards ambassador extraordinary to the court of\r\nFrance. His son was made duke of Portland, and governor of Jamaica, by\r\nGeorge I.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Nassau, commonly called seigneur, or lord of Zuletstein in\r\nHolland, was another follower of the fortunes of king William; he was\r\nrelated to his majesty, his father having been a natural son of the\r\nking’s grandfather. He was in the year 1695 created baron of Enfield,\r\nviscount Tunbridge, and earl of Rochfort.\r\n\r\nArnold Joost Van Keppel, another of Williams’s followers, was the second\r\nson of Bernard Van Pallant, lord of the manor of Keppel in Holland, a\r\nparticular favourite of his majesty, who, soon after his accession to\r\nthe throne, created him baron of Ashford, viscount Bury, and earl of\r\nAlbemarle.\r\n\r\nEarl Cowper is indebted for his barony of Wingham to queen Anne, and for\r\nhis further titles of viscount Fordwich, and earl Cowper, to George I.;\r\nbut he derives no inconsiderable portion of his wealth from his\r\nancestress in the female line, lady Henrietta, daughter and heiress of\r\nthe earl of Grantham, descended from monsieur d’Auverquerque, who was by\r\nthat prince raised to the dignity of an English earl, by the title of\r\nGrantham, being representative of an illegitimate son of the celebrated\r\nshadthalder, prince Maurice.\r\n\r\nThe heroic marshal Schomberg, who fell in the memorable battle of the\r\nBoyne when upwards of eighty years of age, had previously been created\r\nby king William, a duke both in England and Ireland. His titles are\r\nextinct, but his heir general is the present duke of Leeds, who is at\r\nthe same time heir male to the celebrated earl of Danby, who cuts so\r\nconspicuous a figure in the annals of Charles II., and was by William\r\nIII. advanced to a dukedom.\r\n\r\nThe dukedom of Bolton was conferred by William on the marquis of\r\nWinchester, whose ancestors had for a century stood enrolled as premier\r\nmarquisses of England.\r\n\r\nLong before they were advanced by William III. to dukedoms, the houses\r\nof Russell and Cavendish had been noted as two of the most historical\r\nfamilies in the English peerage. Their earldoms were respective\r\ncreations of Edward VI. and James I. The individual of each house first\r\nennobled, died possessed of the bulk of the extensive landed\r\npossessions, and strong parliamentary influence with which his\r\nrepresentative is at the present moment invested.\r\n\r\nThe character and military achievements of John Churchill stand so\r\npreeminent in the history of Europe, that it need here only be remarked\r\nthat from a baron, king William conferred on him the earldom of\r\nMarlborough, again advanced by queen Anne to a dukedom, carried on by\r\nact of parliament, after his victory of Blenheim, to the issue male of\r\nhis daughters, and now vested in the noble family of Spencer, earl of\r\nSunderland.\r\n\r\nLord Lumley, advanced to the earldom of Scarborough, was one of the\r\nmemorable seven who signed the original letter of invitation to the\r\nprince of Orange.\r\n\r\nLord Coventry, descended from a lord keeper of the great seal to Charles\r\nI., was promoted by William III. to an earldom.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Villiers, a courtier, of the same family as the celebrated\r\nduke of Buckingham, received the earldom of Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe families of Cholmondeley, Fermor, and Ashburnham, were each raised\r\nby William III. to the dignity of English barons. They were each of\r\nconsiderable antiquity and extensive possessions. Each was, moreover,\r\npeculiarly distinguished for devoted attachment to the cause of Charles\r\nI., even when it stood in the extremest jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThese baronies are now vested respectively in the marquis of\r\nCholmondeley, and the earls of Pomfret and Ashburnham.\r\n\r\nThe possessions, the influence, the connections of the male\r\nrepresentative of the able, the restless, the unfortunate sir Harry\r\nVane, were still of weightier calibre.

This, then, was taken as a mere frolic,\r\nand for the present passed accordingly; but afterwards, when the treason\r\nwas discovered, such as remembered his gestures, thought thereby he did\r\nact what he intended to do, (if the plot had took effect,) hack and hew,\r\nkill and slay, all eminent persons of a different religion to\r\nthemselves.”[414]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA modern writer observes:--“It is not, perhaps, generally known, that we\r\nhave a form of prayer for prisoners, which is printed in the ‘Irish\r\nCommon Prayer-book,’ though not in ours. Mrs. Berkeley, in whose\r\n_Preface of Prefaces_ to her son’s poems I first saw this mentioned,\r\nregrets the omission, observing, that the very fine prayer for those\r\nunder sentence of death might, being read by the children of the poor,\r\nat least keep them from the gallows. The remark is just. If there be\r\nnot room in our prayer-book, we have some services there which might\r\nbetter be dispensed with. It was not very decent in the late abolition\r\nof holydays, to let the two Charleses hold their place, when the Virgin\r\nMary and the saints were deprived of the red letter privileges. If we\r\nare to have any state service, it ought to be for the expulsion of the\r\nStuarts. There is no other part of their history which England ought to\r\nremember with sorrow and shame. Guy Faux also might now be dismissed,\r\nthough the _Eye of Providence_ would be a real loss. The Roman catholics\r\nknow the effect of such prints as these, and there can be no good reason\r\nfor not imitating them in this instance. I would have no prayer-book\r\npublished without that eye of Providence in it.”[415]\r\n\r\n\r\nPURTON BONFIRE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--At almost every village in England, the _fifth of November_\r\nis regarded in a very especial manner. Some pay greater attention to it\r\nthan others, but I believe it is invariably noticed by all.\r\n\r\nI have been present at Old Purton bonfire, and perhaps the following\r\nshort notice of it may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nI before stated (col. 1207) that the green, or close, at Purton, is the\r\nspot allotted for amusements in general. This is also the place for the\r\nceremonies on this highly important day, which I am about to describe.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks before, the boys of the village go to every house begging\r\nfaggots; and if they are refused they all answer together--\r\n\r\n    If you don’t give us one\r\n      We’ll take two,\r\n    The better for us, sir,\r\n       And worse for you.\r\n\r\nThey were once refused by a farmer, (who was very much disliked by the\r\npoor for his severity and unkindness,) and accordingly they determined\r\nto make him repent. He kept a sharp look out over his faggot pile, but\r\nforgot that something else might be stolen. The boys got into his\r\nbackyard and extracted a new pump, which had not been properly fixed,\r\nand bore it off in triumph to the green, where it was burnt amidst the\r\nloud acclamations of the young rogues generally.\r\n\r\nAll the wood, &c. which has been previously collected, is brought into\r\nthe middle of the close where the effigy of poor Guy is burnt. A figure\r\nis made (similar to one of those carried about London streets,)\r\nintending to represent the conspirator, and placed at the top of a high\r\npole, with the fuel all around. Previous to lighting it, poor Guy is\r\nshot at by all who have the happiness to possess guns for the purpose,\r\nand pelted with squibs, crackers, &c. This fun continues about an hour,\r\nand then the pile is lighted, the place echoes with huzzas, guns keep up\r\nperpetual reports, fireworks are flying in all directions, and the\r\nvillage bells merrily ring. The fire is kept up a considerable time, and\r\nit is a usual custom for a large piece of “real Wiltshire bacon” to be\r\ndressed by it, which is taken to the public-house, together with\r\npotatoes roasted in the ashes of the bonfire, and a jovial repast is\r\nmade. As the fire decreases, successive quantities of potatoes are\r\ndressed in the embers by the rustics, who seem to regard them as the\r\ngreat delicacies of the night.\r\n\r\nThere is no restraint put on the loyal zeal of these good folks, and the\r\nfire is maintained to a late hour. I remember, on one occasion, hearing\r\nthe guns firing as I lay in bed between two and three o’clock in the\r\nmorning. The public-house is kept open nearly all night. Ale flows\r\nplentifully, and it is not spared by the revellers. They have a noisy\r\nchorus, which is intended as a toast to his majesty; it runs thus:--\r\n\r\n      My brave lads remember\r\n      The fifth of November,\r\n    Gunpowder treason and plot,\r\n      We will drink, smoke, and sing, boys,\r\n      And our bells they shall ring, boys,\r\n      And here’s health to our king, boys,\r\n    For he shall not be forgot.\r\n\r\nTheir merriment continues till morning, when they generally retire to\r\nrest very much inebriated, or, as they term it, “merry,” or “top heavy.”\r\n\r\nI hope to have the pleasure of reading other communications in your\r\ninteresting work on this good old English custom; and beg to remain,\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  C.

He is the titular saint of\r\nmany of our great churches, and was particularly invoked in behalf of\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nA list of holydays published at Worcester, in 1240, ordains St.\r\nLeonard’s festival to be kept a half-holyday, enjoins the hearing of\r\nmass, and prohibits all labour except that of the plough.\r\n\r\nSt. Leonard was a French nobleman in the court of Clovis I., where he\r\nwas converted by St. Remigius, or Remy; became a monk, built an oratory\r\nfor himself in a forest at Nobilac, near Limoges, lived on herbs and\r\nfruits, and formed a community, which after his death was a flourishing\r\nmonastery under the name of St. Leonard le Noblat. He was remarkable for\r\ncharity towards captives and prisoners, and died about 559, with the\r\nreputation of having worked miracles in their behalf.[416]\r\n\r\nThe legend of St. Leonard relates that there was no water within a mile\r\nof his monastery, “wherfore he did do make a pyt all drye, the which he\r\nfylled with water by his prayers--and he shone there by so grete\r\nmyracles, that who that was in prison, and called his name in ayde,\r\nanone his bondes and fetters were broken, and went awaye without ony\r\ngaynsayenge frely, and came presentyng to hym theyr chaynes or yrens.”\r\n\r\nIt is particularly related that one of St. Leonard’s converts “was taken\r\nof a tyraunt,” which tyrant, considering by whom his prisoner was\r\nprotected, determined so to secure him against Leonard, as to “make hym\r\npaye for his raunsom a thousand shyllynges.” Therefore, said the tyrant,\r\n“I shall go make a ryght grete and depe pyt vnder the erth in my toure,\r\nand I shall cast hym therin bounden with many bondes; and I shal do make\r\na chest of tree vpon the mouth of the pyt, and shall make my knyghtes to\r\nlye therin all armed; and how be it that yf Leonarde breke the yrons,\r\nyet shall he not entre into it vnder the erth.” Having done as he said,\r\nthe prisoner called on St. Leonard, who at night “came and turned the\r\nchest wherein the knyghtes laye armed, and closed them therein, lyke as\r\ndeed men ben in a tombe, and after entred into the pyt with grete\r\nlyght,” and he spoke to the prisoner, from whom the chains fell off, and\r\nhe “toke hym in his armes and bare hym out of the toure--and sette hym\r\nat home in his hous.” And other great marvels are told of St. Leonard as\r\ntrue as this.[417]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe miracles wrought by St. Leonard in releasing prisoners continued\r\nafter his death, but at this time the saint has ceased from interposing\r\nin their behalf even on his festival; which, being the first day of\r\nMichaelmas term, and therefore the day whereon writs issued since the\r\nTrinity term are made returnable, would be a convenient season for the\r\nsaint’s interposition.\r\n\r\n    This day the long vacation o’er,\r\n    And lawyers go to work once more;\r\n    With their materials all provided,\r\n    That they may have the cause decided.\r\n    The plaintiff he brings in his bill,\r\n    He’ll have his cause, cost what it will;\r\n    Till afterwards comes the defendant,\r\n    And is resolved to make an end on’t.\r\n    And having got all things in fitness,\r\n    Supplied with money and with witness;\r\n    And makes a noble bold defence,\r\n    Backed with material evidence.\r\n    The proverb is, one cause is good\r\n    Until the other’s understood.\r\n    They thunder out to little purpose,\r\n    With certiorari, habeas corpus,\r\n    Their replicandos, writs of error,\r\n    To fill the people’s hearts with terror;\r\n    And if the lawyer do approve it,\r\n    To chancery they must remove it:\r\n    And then the two that were so warm,\r\n    Must leave it to another term;\r\n    Till they go home and work for more,\r\n    To spend as they have done before.\r\n\r\n  _Poor Robin._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 43·40.\r\n\r\n  [416] Alban Butler.\r\n\r\n  [417] Golden Legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 7.~\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE LONDON GAZETTE.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th day of November, 1665, the first “Gazette” in England was\r\npublished at Oxford; the court being there at that time, on account of\r\nthe plague. On the removal of the court to London, the title was changed\r\nto the “London Gazette.” The “Oxford Gazette” was published on Tuesdays,\r\nthe London on Saturdays: and these have continued, to be the days of\r\npublication ever since.\r\n\r\nThe word gazette originally meant a newspaper, or printed account of the\r\ntransactions of all the countries in the known world, in a loose sheet\r\nor half sheet; but the term is with us confined to that paper of news\r\nnow published by authority. It derived its name from gazetta, a kind of\r\nsmall coin formerly current at Venice, which was the usual price of the\r\nfirst newspaper printed there.[418]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·92.\r\n\r\n  [418] Butler’s Chronological Exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 8.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MAYOR OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nOn this day the chief magistrate elect of the metropolis is sworn into\r\noffice at Guildhall, and to-morrow is the grand festival of the\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 44·27.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 9.~\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MAYOR’S DAY.\r\n\r\nThis “great day in the calendar” of the city, is the subject of the\r\nfollowing whimsical adaptation.\r\n\r\n    Now countless turbots and unnumbered soles\r\n    Fill the wide kitchens of each livery hall:\r\n    From pot to spit, to kettle, stew, and pan,\r\n    The busy hum of greasy scullions sounds,\r\n    That the fixed beadles do almost perceive\r\n    The secret dainties of each other’s watch:\r\n    Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames\r\n    Each table sees the other’s bill of fare:\r\n    Cook threatens cook in high and saucy vaunt\r\n    Of rare and newmade dishes; confectioners,\r\n    Both pastrycooks and fruiterers in league,\r\n    With candied art their rivets closing up,\r\n    Give pleasing notice of a rich dessert.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the subjoined humorous account of a former civic procession and\r\nfestival, there are some features which do not belong to the present\r\ncelebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MAYOR’S DAY, 1773.\r\n\r\nTo describe the adventures and incidents of this important day in the\r\ncity annals, it is very necessary to revert to the preceding evening. It\r\nis not now as it was formerly--\r\n\r\n    “That _sober_ citizens get _drunk_ by nine.”\r\n\r\nHad Pope lived in the auspicious reign of George III., he would have\r\nindulged us at least two hours, and found a rhyme for _eleven_.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 8th of November, the stands of several livery\r\ncompanies clogged the passage of Cheapside and the adjacent streets. The\r\nnight was passed in erecting the temporary sheds, sacred to city mirth,\r\nruby gills, and round paunches. The earliest dawn of the morning\r\nwitnessed the industry of the scavengers; and the broom-maker was, for\r\nonce, the first patriot in the city.\r\n\r\n    This service done, repair we to Guildhall.\r\n\r\nAt five in the morning the spits groaned beneath the ponderous sirloins.\r\nThese, numerous as large, proved that the “roast beef of Old England” is\r\nstill thouht an ornament to our tables. The chandeliers in the hall were\r\ntwelve in number, each provided with forty-eight wax candles; exclusive\r\nof which there were three large glass lamps, two globular lamps under\r\nthe giants, and wax candles in girandoles. Hustings were raised at each\r\nend of the hall for the accommodation of the superior company, and\r\ntables laid through the centre for persons of lower rank. One advantage\r\narose from the elevation at the west end of the hall, for the\r\ninscription under Beckford’s statue was thereby rendered perfectly\r\nlegible. Tables were spread in the court of king’s-bench, which was\r\nprovided with one chandelier of forty-eight candles. All the seats were\r\neither matted, hung with tapestry, or covered with crimson cloth, and\r\nthe whole made a very noble appearance.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o’clock the windows from Blackfriars-bridge, to the north end\r\nof King street, began to exhibit such a number of angelic faces, as\r\nwould tempt a man to wish for the honour of chief magistracy, if it were\r\nonly to be looked at by so many fine eyes. There was scarce a house that\r\ncould not boast a Venus for its tenant. At fifteen minutes past ten the\r\ncommon serjeant entered Guildhall, and in a few minutes the new\r\nlord-mayor, preceded by four footmen in elegant liveries of brown and\r\ngold, was brought into the hall in a superb sedan chair. Next came\r\nalderman Plomer, and then the recorder, who was so much afflicted with\r\nthe gout, that it required the full exertion of his servant’s strength\r\nto support him. Mr. Alderman Thomas arrived soon after, then the two\r\nsheriffs, and lastly Mr. Crosby. There being no other alderman, Mr.\r\nPeckham could not be sworn into his office. At twenty minutes past\r\neleven the lord mayor left the hall, being preceded by the city sword\r\nand mace, and followed by the alderman and sheriffs. The breakfast in\r\nthe council chamber, at Guildhall, consisted of six sirloins of beef,\r\ntwelve tureens of soup, mulled wines, pastry, &c. The late lord-mayor\r\nwaited at the end of King-street to join the procession. As soon as his\r\ncarriage moved, the mob began to groan and hiss, on which he burst into\r\nso immoderate a fit of laughter, evidently unforced, that the mob joined\r\nin one laughing chorus, and seemed to wonder what they had hissed at.\r\n\r\nThe procession by water was as usual, but rather tedious, as the\r\ntide was contrary. The ceremonies at Westminster-hall being gone\r\nthrough in the customary manner, the company returned by water to\r\nBlackfriars-bridge, where the lord-mayor landed at about three o’clock,\r\nand proceeded in solemn state to Guildhall, where the tables groaned\r\nbeneath the weight of solids and dainties of every kind in season: the\r\ndishes of pastry, &c. were elegantly adorned with flowers of various\r\nsorts interspersed with bay-leaves; and many an honest freeman got a\r\nnose-gay at the city expense. A superb piece of confectionary was placed\r\non the lord-mayor’s table, and the whole entertainment was splendid and\r\nmagnificent. During the absence of the lord-mayor, such of the city\r\ncompanies as have not barges paraded the streets in the accustomed\r\nmanner; and the man in armour exhibited to the delight of the little\r\nmasters and misses, and the astonishment of many a gaping rustic. The\r\nlord-mayor appeared to be in good health and spirits, and to enjoy the\r\napplausive shouts of his fellow-citizens, probably from a consciousness\r\nof having deserved them. Mr. Gates, the city marshal, was as fine as\r\npowder and ribbons and gold could make him; his horse, too, was almost\r\nas fine, and nearly as stately as the rider. Mr. Wilkes came through the\r\ncity in a chair, carried on men’s shoulders, just before the procession,\r\nin order to keep it up, and be saluted with repeated shouts. The\r\nlord-mayor’s coach was elegant, and his horses (long-tailed blacks) the\r\nfinest that have been seen for many years. There were a great number of\r\nconstables round Mr. Alderman Townsend’s coach; and a complaint has\r\nsince been made, that he was grossly insulted.

took the degree of M. A. in 1605,\r\nentered into holy orders, became doctor of divinity, obtained a prebend\r\nin the cathedral of Sarum, and other church preferment, and being a man\r\nof ready wit, was favoured by king James I., who made him one of his\r\nchaplains. In 1618, he took a journey to France, of which he wrote an\r\namusing narrative. In 1627, his majesty gave him the deanery of\r\nChristchurch; in 1629, he was raised to the bishopric of Oxford, and in\r\n1632, translated to that of Norwich. He died in 1635. The poems of\r\nbishop Corbet are lively and amusing compositions, such as might have\r\nbeen expected from a man of learning and genius, possessed of a\r\nsuperabundance of constitutional hilarity. The latter quality appears to\r\nhave drawn him into some excesses, not altogether consistent with the\r\ngravity of his profession. After he was a doctor of divinity, being at a\r\ntavern in Abingdon, a ballad-singer came into the house, complaining\r\nthat he could not dispose of his stock; the doctor, in a frolic, took\r\noff his gown, and assuming the ballad-singer’s leather jacket, went out\r\ninto the street, and drew around him a crowd of admiring purchasers.\r\nPerhaps he thought he could divest himself of his sacerdotal character\r\nwith his habit; for it seems he shut himself up in his well-stored\r\ncellar, with his chaplain, Dr. Lushington, and taking off his gown,\r\nexclaimed: “There goes the doctor;” then throwing down his episcopal\r\nhood, “there goes the bishop”--after which the night was devoted to\r\nBacchus. Riding out one day with a Dr. Stubbins, who was extremely fat,\r\nthe coach was overturned, and both fell into a ditch. The bishop, in\r\ngiving an account of the accident, observed, that Dr. Stubbins was up to\r\nthe elbows in mud, and he was up to the elbows in Stubbins. Bishop\r\nCorbet was not distinguished as a divine; his sentiments however were\r\nliberal, and he inclined to the Arminian party, which then began to\r\nprevail in the church of England.[423]\r\n\r\nIn the bishop’s lines “to his son on his birth-day,” there is something\r\nof the feeling in the wise man’s supplication, “Give me neither poverty\r\nnor riches.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 43·72.\r\n\r\n  [422] Bp.

They were written\r\nin the same year by John Price, a land-waiter in the port of Poole, and\r\nare preserved in Mr. Raw’s “Suffolk Garland,” with the following\r\nintroduction:--\r\n\r\n\r\nADMIRAL VERNON’S ANSWER TO ADMIRAL HOSIER’S GHOST.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Percy’s “Reliques of Ancient Poetry,” vol. ii. p. 376. is an\r\nadmirable ballad, intituled “Hosier’s Ghost,” being an address to\r\nadmiral Vernon, in Porto-Bello harbour, by Mr. Glover, the author of\r\nLeonidas. The case of Hosier was briefly this:--\r\n\r\nIn April, 1726, he was sent with a strong fleet to the Spanish West\r\nIndies, to block up the galleons in the ports of that country; but being\r\nrestricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage, he\r\nlay inactive on that station, until he became the jest of the Spaniards.\r\nHe afterwards removed to Carthagena, and continued cruizing in those\r\nseas, till far the greater part of his crews perished by the diseases of\r\nthat unhealthy climate. This brave man, seeing his officers and men thus\r\ndaily swept away, his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, and\r\nhimself made the sport of the enemy, is said to have died of a broken\r\nheart. The ballad concludes--\r\n\r\n    “O’er these waves, for ever mourning,\r\n      Shall we roam, depriv’d of rest,\r\n    If to Britain’s shores returning,\r\n      You neglect my just request:\r\n\r\n    After this proud foe subduing,\r\n      When your patriot friends you see,\r\n    Think on vengeance for my ruin,\r\n      And for England--sham’d in me.”\r\n\r\nIn 1739, vice-admiral Vernon was appointed commander-in-chief of a\r\nsquadron then fitting out for destroying the settlements of the\r\nSpaniards in the West Indies; and, weighing anchor from Spithead on the\r\n23d of July, arrived in sight of Porto-Bello, with six ships only, under\r\nhis command, on the 20th of November following. The next day he\r\ncommenced the attack of that town; when, after a most furious engagement\r\non both sides, it was taken on the 22d, together with a considerable\r\nnumber of cannon, mortars, and ammunition, and also two Spanish ships of\r\nwar. He then blew up the fortifications, and evacuated the place for\r\nwant of land forces sufficient to retain it; but first distributed ten\r\nthousand dollars, which had been sent to Porto-Bello for paying the\r\nSpanish troops, among the forces for their bravery.\r\n\r\nThe two houses of parliament joined in an address of congratulation upon\r\nthis success of his majesty’s arms; and the nation, in general, was\r\nwonderfully elated by an exploit, which was certainly magnified much\r\nabove its intrinsic merit.\r\n\r\n    Hosier! with indignant sorrow,\r\n      I have heard thy mournful tale\r\n    And, if heav’n permit, to-morrow\r\n      Hence our warlike fleet shall sail.\r\n    O’er those hostile waves, wide roaming,\r\n      We will urge our bold design,\r\n    With the blood of thousands foaming,\r\n      For our country’s wrongs and thine.\r\n\r\n    On that day, when each brave fellow,\r\n      Who now triumphs here with me,\r\n    Storm’d and plunder’d Porto-Bello,\r\n      All my thoughts were full of thee.\r\n    Thy disast’rous fate alarm’d me;\r\n      Fierce thy image glar’d on high,\r\n    And with gen’rous ardour warm’d me,\r\n      To revenge thy fall, or die.\r\n\r\n    From their lofty ships descending,\r\n      Thro’ the flood, in firm array,\r\n    To the destin’d city bending,\r\n      My lov’d sailors work’d their way.\r\n    Strait the foe, with horror trembling,\r\n      Quits in haste his batter’d walls;\r\n    And in accents, undissembling,\r\n      As he flies, for mercy calls.\r\n\r\n    Carthagena, tow’ring wonder!\r\n      At the daring deed dismay’d,\r\n    Shall ere long by Britain’s thunder,\r\n      Smoking in the dust be laid.\r\n    Thou, and these pale spectres sweeping,\r\n      Restless, o’er this watry round,\r\n    Whose wan cheeks are stain’d with weeping,\r\n      Pleas’d shall listen to the sound.\r\n\r\n    Still rememb’ring thy sad story,\r\n      To thy injur’d ghost I swear,\r\n    By my hopes of future glory,\r\n      War shall be my constant care:\r\n    And I ne’er will cease pursuing\r\n      Spain’s proud sons from sea to sea,\r\n    With just vengeance for thy ruin,\r\n      And for England sham’d in thee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we are to-day on a naval topic, it seems fitting to introduce a\r\npopular usage among sailors, in the words of captain Edward Hall, R. N.,\r\nwho communicated the particulars to Dr. Forster, on the 30th of October,\r\n1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE LINE.\r\n\r\nThe following is an account of the custom of shaving at the tub by\r\nNeptune, as practised on board vessels crossing the Equator, Tropics,\r\nand Europa Point. The origin of it is supposed to be very ancient, and\r\nit is commonly followed on board foreign, as well as British ships.\r\nEuropa Point at Gibraltar being one of the places, it may have arisen at\r\nthe time when that was considered the western boundary of Terra Firma.\r\n\r\nOn the departure of a vessel from England by either of the aforesaid\r\nroutes, much ingenuity is exerted by the old seamen and their\r\nconfederates to discover the uninitiated, and it is seldom that any\r\nescape detection. A few days previous to arriving at the scene of\r\naction, much mystery and reserve is observed among the ship’s company:\r\nthey are then secretly collecting stale soapsuds, water, &c., arranging\r\nthe dramatis personæ, and preparing material. At this time, also, the\r\nnovices, who are aware of what is going forward, send their forfeits to\r\nthe captain of the forecastle, who acts as Neptune’s deputy; the forfeit\r\nis either a bottle of rum, or a dollar: and I never knew it refused,\r\nexcept from a cook’s mate who had acted negligently, and from a\r\nsteward’s mate who was inclined to trick the people when serving\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nOn board of a man-of-war it is generally performed on a grand scale. I\r\nhave witnessed it several times, but the best executed was on board a\r\nship of the line of which I was lieutenant, bound to the West Indies. On\r\ncrossing the Tropic, a voice, as if at a distance, and from the surface\r\nof the water, cried “Ho, the ship ahoy! I shall come on board:” this was\r\nfrom a person slung over the bows, near the water, speaking through his\r\nhands. Presently two men of large stature came over the bows; they had\r\nhideous masks on: one personated Neptune--he was naked to his middle,\r\ncrowned with the head of a huge wet swab, the ends of which reached to\r\nhis loins to represent flowing locks; a piece of tarpaulin, vandyked,\r\nencircled the head of the swab and his brows as a diadem; his right hand\r\nwielded a boarding-pike manufactured into a trident, and his body was\r\nmarked with red ochre to represent fish scales: the other personated\r\nAmphitrite, having locks also formed of swabs, a petticoat of the same\r\nmaterial, with a girdle of red bunten; and in her hands a comb and\r\nlooking-glass. They were followed by about twenty fellows, also naked to\r\ntheir middle, with red ochre scales as Tritons. They were received on\r\nthe forecastle with much respect by the old sailors, who had provided\r\nthe carriage of an eighteen-pounder as a car, which their majesties\r\nascended, and were drawn aft along the gangway to the quarter-deck by\r\nthe Tritons; when Neptune, addressing the captain, said he was happy to\r\nsee him again that way, that he believed there were some Johnny Raws on\r\nboard that had not paid their dues, and who he intended to initiate into\r\nthe salt water mysteries. The captain answered, he was happy to see him,\r\nbut requested he would make no more confusion than was necessary. They\r\nthen descended on the main deck, and were joined by all the old hands,\r\nand about twenty barbers, who submitted their razors, brushes and suds\r\nto inspection; the first were made from old iron hoops jagged, the\r\nsecond from tar brushes, and the shaving suds from tar, grease, and\r\nsomething from the pigsty; they had also boxes of tropical pills\r\nprocured from the sheep pen. Large tubs full of stale suds, with a\r\nmovable board across each, were ranged around the pumps and engine, and\r\nplenty of buckets filled with water. Thus prepared, they divided\r\nthemselves into gangs of a dozen each, dashed off in different\r\ndirections, and soon returned with their subjects. The proceedings with\r\neach unlucky wight were as follows:--Being seated on a board across a\r\ntub of water, his eyes were quickly bandaged, his face lathered with the\r\ndelightful composition; then a couple of scrapes on each side of the\r\nchin, followed by a question asked, or some pretended compassionate\r\ninquiry made, to get his mouth open, into which the barber either dashed\r\nthe shaving-brush, or a pill, which was the signal for slipping the\r\nboard from under the poor devil, who was then left to flounder his way\r\nout of the tub, and perhaps half drowned in attempting to recover his\r\nfeet, by buckets of water being dashed over him from all quarters; being\r\nthus thoroughly drenched and initiated, I have often observed spirited\r\nfellows join their former persecutors in the remainder of their work.\r\nAfter an hour or two spent in this rough fun, which all seem to enjoy,\r\nNeptune disappears somewhere in the hold to unrobe, the decks are washed\r\nand dried, and those that have undergone the shaving business, oil or\r\ngrease their chins and whiskers to get rid of the tar. This custom does\r\nnot accord with the usual discipline of a man-of-war; but, as the old\r\nseamen look on it as their privilege, and it is only about an hour’s\r\nrelaxation, I have never heard of any captain refusing them his\r\npermission.\r\n\r\n  E.

In\r\nthe year 1820, I visited the latter revel; perhaps a description may be\r\nacceptable to you, and amusing to your readers.\r\n\r\nI think it may be generally allowed that Wiltshire, and the western\r\ncounties, keep up their primitive customs more than any counties. This\r\nis greatly to the credit of the inhabitants; for these usages tend to\r\npromote cheerful intercourse and friendly feeling among the residents in\r\nthe different villages, who on such occasions assemble together. In\r\nWiltshire I have remarked various customs, particularly at Christmas,\r\nwhich I have never seen or heard of in any other place. If these customs\r\nwere witnessed by a stranger, I am sure he must fancy the good old days\r\nof yore, where every season brought its particular custom, which was\r\nalways strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nWiltshire consists of beautiful and extensive downs, and rich meadow and\r\npasture lands, which support some of the finest dairies and farms that\r\ncan be met with in the kingdom. The natives are a very strong and hardy\r\nset of men, and are particularly fond of robust sports; their chief and\r\nfavourite amusement is backswording, or singlestick, for which they are\r\nas greatly celebrated as the inhabitants of the adjoining counties,\r\nSomersetshire and Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nAt this game there are several rules observed. They play with a large\r\nround stick, which must be three feet long, with a basket prefixed to\r\none end as a guard for the hand. The combatants throw off their hats and\r\nupper garments, with the exception of the shirt, and have the left hand\r\ntied to the side, so that they cannot defend themselves with that hand.\r\nThey brandish the stick over the head, guarding off the adversary’s\r\nblows, and striking him whenever an opportunity occurs. Great skill is\r\noften used in the defence. I have seen two men play for upwards of half\r\nan hour without once hitting each other. The blood must flow an inch\r\nfrom some part of the head, before either party is declared victor.\r\n\r\nBlackford, the backsword player, was a butcher residing at Swindon; he\r\ndied a few years ago. His “successor” is a blacksmith at Lyddington,\r\nnamed Morris Pope, who is considered the best player of the day, and\r\ngenerally carries off the prizes at the Hungerford revel, which he\r\nalways attends. This revel is attended by all the best players in\r\nWiltshire and Somersetshire, between whom the contest lies. To commence\r\nthe fray, twenty very excellent players are selected from each county;\r\nthe contest lasts a considerable time, and is always severe, but the\r\nWiltshire men are generally conquerors. Their principal characteristics\r\nare skill, strength, and courage--this is generally allowed by all who\r\nare acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nBut Hungerford revel is not a scene of contention alone, it consists of\r\nall kinds of rustic sports, which afford capital fun to the spectators.\r\nThey may be laid out thus--\r\n\r\n1st. _Girls running for “smocks,”_ &c., which is a well-known amusement\r\nat country fairs.\r\n\r\n2d. _Climbing the greasy pole_ for a piece of bacon which is placed on\r\nthe top. This affords very great amusement, as it is a difficult thing\r\nto be accomplished. The climber, perhaps, may get near the top of the\r\npole, and has it in his power to hold himself up by both hands, but the\r\nmoment he raises one hand to unhook the prize, he is almost sure to\r\nslide down again with great rapidity, bearing all below him who are so\r\nfoolish as to climb after him.\r\n\r\n3d. _Old women drinking hot tea for snuff._ Whoever can drink it the\r\nquickest and hottest gains the prize.\r\n\r\n4th. _Grinning through horse-collars._ Several Hodges stand in a row,\r\neach holding a collar; whoever can make the ugliest face through it\r\ngains the prize. This feat is also performed by old women, and certainly\r\nthe latter are the most amusing.\r\n\r\n5th. _Racing between twenty and thirty old women for a pound of tea._\r\nThis occasions much merriment, and it is sometimes astonishing to see\r\nwith what agility the old dames run in order to obtain their favourite.\r\n\r\n6th. _Hunting a pig with a soaped tail._ This amusement creates much\r\nmirth, and in my opinion is the most laughable.--Grunter with his tail\r\nwell soaped is set off at the foot of a hill, and is quickly pursued;\r\nbut the person who can lay any claim to him must first catch him by the\r\ntail, and fairly detain him with one hand. This is an almost impossible\r\nfeat, for the pig finding himself pulled back, tries to run forward, and\r\nthe tail slips from the grasp of the holder. It is pretty well known\r\nthat such is the obstinate nature of a pig, that on being pulled one way\r\nhe will strive all he can to go a contrary. In illustration of this\r\ncircumstance, though known perhaps to some of your readers, I may\r\nmention a curious wager a few years ago between a pork butcher and a\r\nwaterman. The butcher betted the waterman that he would make a pig run\r\nover one of the bridges, (I forget which,) quicker than the waterman\r\nwould row across the river. The auditors thought it impossible; the bet\r\nwas eagerly accepted, and the next day was appointed for the\r\nperformance. When the signal for starting was given, the waterman began\r\nto row with all his might and main, and the butcher catching hold of the\r\ntail of the pig endeavoured to pull him back, upon which the pig pulled\r\nforward, and with great rapidity ran over the bridge, pulling the\r\nbutcher after him, who arrived on the opposite side before his\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\n7th. _Jumping in sacks for a cheese._ An excellent caricature of jumping\r\nin sacks, published by Hunt, in Tavistock-street, conveys a true idea of\r\nthe manner in which this amusement is carried on: it is truly laughable.\r\nTen or eleven candidates are chosen; they are tied in sacks up to their\r\nnecks, and have to jump about five hundred yards. Sometimes one will\r\nout-jump himself and fall; this accident generally occasions the fall of\r\nthree or four others, but some one, being more expert, gets on first,\r\nand claims the prize.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago, before Cannon the prize-fighter was publicly known,\r\nas a native of Wiltshire he naturally visited the Hungerford revel.\r\nThere was a man there celebrated over the county for boxing; it was said\r\nthat with a blow from his fist he could break the jaw-bone of an ox;\r\nupon the whole he was a desperate fellow, and no one dared challenge him\r\nto _fight_. Cannon, however, challenged him to _jump_ in sacks. It was\r\nagreed that they should jump three times the distance of about five\r\nhundred yards. The first time Cannon fell, and accordingly his opponent\r\nwon; the second time, Cannon’s opponent fell, and the third time they\r\nkept a pretty even pace for about four hundred yards, when they bounced\r\nagainst each other and both fell, so that there was a dispute who had\r\nwon. Cannon’s opponent was for dividing the cheese, but he would not\r\nsubmit to that, and proposed jumping again; the man would not, but got\r\nout of the sack, and during the time that Cannon was consulting some\r\nfriends on the course to be pursued, ran off with the cheese. Cannon,\r\nhowever, pursued, and after a considerable time succeeded in finding\r\nhim. He then challenged him to fight: the battle lasted two hours, and\r\nCannon was victor. This circumstance introduced him to the sporting\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nYou must allow me, dear sir, to assure you, that it is not my wish to\r\nmake your interesting work a “sporting calendar,” by naming “sporting\r\ncharacters.” I tell you this lest you should not incline to read\r\nfurther, especially when you see.\r\n\r\n8th. _Donkey Racing._ I will certainly defy any one to witness these\r\nraces, without being almost convulsed with laughter. Each candidate\r\nrides his neighbour’s donkey, and he who arrives first at the appointed\r\nplace claims the prize, which is generally a smock-frock, a waistcoat, a\r\nhat, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n9th. _Duck Hunting._ This sport generally concludes the whole: it is a\r\nvery laughable, but certainly a very cruel amusement. They tie a poor\r\nunfortunate owl in an upright position, to the back of a still more\r\nunfortunate duck, and then turn them loose. The owl presuming that his\r\ninconvenient captivity is the work of the duck, very unceremoniously\r\ncommences an attack on the head of the latter, who naturally takes to\r\nits own means of defence, the water: the duck dives with the owl on his\r\nback; as soon as he rises, the astonished owl opens wide his eyes, turns\r\nabout his head in a very solemn manner, and suddenly recommences his\r\nattack on the oppressed duck, who dives as before. The poor animals\r\ngenerally destroy each other, unless some humane person rescues them.\r\n\r\nLike all other Wiltshire amusements, the Hungerford revel always closes\r\nwith good humour and conviviality; the ale flowing plentifully, and the\r\nsong echoing loud and gaily from the rustic revellers. Although the\r\nrevel is meant to last only one day, the very numerous attendants keep\r\nup the minor sports sometimes to the fourth day, when all depart, and\r\nHungerford is once more a scene of tranquility.\r\n\r\nThe revel takes place about this time of the year, but I really cannot\r\ncall to my recollection the precise day. Hoping, however, that this is\r\nof no material consequence, I beg to remain,\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n  C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL OF WARWICK, THE KING MAKER.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, who at one time is said to have entertained thirty\r\nthousand people at the boards of his different manors and estates in\r\nEngland, and who, when he travelled or lodged in any town, was\r\naccompanied by four or five hundred retainers, wrote on All Souls’ day\r\nthe following remarkable letter for the loan of a small sum. It is\r\ndivested of its ancient spelling.\r\n\r\n  “_To our right trusty and well-beloved Friend, Sir_ THOMAS TODDENHAM.\r\n\r\n“Right trusty and well beloved friend, we greet you well, heartily\r\ndesiring to hear of your welfare; and if it please you to hear of our\r\nwelfare, we were in good health at the making of this letter, entreating\r\nyou heartily, that ye will consider our message, which our chaplain\r\nMaster Robert Hopton shall inform you of; for we have great business\r\ndaily and have had here before this time, wherefore we entreat you to\r\nconsider the purchase, that we have made with one John Swyffham\r\n(Southcote) an esquire of Lincolnshire, of 88_l._ by the year, whereupon\r\nwe must pay the last payment, the Monday next after St. Martin’s day,\r\nwhich sum is 458_l._ Wherefore we entreat you with all our heart, that\r\nye will lend us ten, or twenty pounds, or what the said Master Robert\r\nwants of his payment, as we may do for you in time for to come, and we\r\nwill send it you again afore new year’s day, as we are a true knight.\r\nFor there is none in your country, that we might write to for trust, so\r\nwell as unto you, for as we be informed, ye be our well willer, and so\r\nwe entreat you, that ye consider our intent of this money, as ye will\r\nthat we do for you in time to come.... Written at London, on All Soul’s\r\nDay, within our lodging in the Grey Friars, within Newgate.\r\n\r\n  “RIC. ERLE WARWYKE.”\r\n\r\nThis letter is not dated, as to the year, but is known from\r\ncircumstances to have been written before 1455. Sir Thomas Toddingham\r\nwas a wealthy knight of Norfolk, who had an unfortunate marriage with\r\none of the Wodehouses. The epistle shows the importance of ten, or\r\ntwenty pounds, when rents were chiefly received in kind, and the\r\ndifference between one degree of wealth and another, was exemplified by\r\nthe number of a baron’s retainers. “Now,” says Burke, “we have a ton of\r\nancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury.”[430]\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEATH OF THE LOTTERY.”\r\n\r\nIntroductory to particulars respecting _Lotteries_, two engravings are\r\ninserted, representing exhibitions that appeared in the streets of the\r\nmetropolis, with the intent to excite adventure in “the last state\r\nlottery that will ever be drawn in England.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The last Stage of the last State Lottery.~]\r\n\r\nA BALLAD, 1826.\r\n\r\n    A lazy sot grew sober\r\n    By looking at his troubles,\r\n      For he found out how\r\n      He work’d his woe,\r\n    By playing with Lott’ry bubbles.\r\n\r\n    And just before October,\r\n    The _grand_ contractors, zealous\r\n      To _share_ their _last_ ills,\r\n      With puffs and bills,\r\n    Drove all the quack-doctors jealous.\r\n\r\n    Their _bill_-and-_cue_-carts slowly\r\n    Paced Holborn and Long Acre,\r\n      Like a funeral\r\n      Not mourn’d at all,\r\n    The bury’ng an undertaker.\r\n\r\n    Clerks smiled, and whisper’d lowly:\r\n    “This is the time or never\r\n      There _must_ be a rise--\r\n      Buy, and be wise,\r\n    Or your chance is gone for ever.”\r\n\r\n    Yet, of the shares and tickets,\r\n    Spite of all arts to sell ’em,\r\n      There were more unsold\r\n      Than dare be told;\r\n    Although, if I knew, I’d tell ’em.\r\n\r\n    And so, worn out with rickets,\r\n    The _last_ “Last Lott’ry” expired;\r\n      And then there were cries--\r\n      “We’ve gained a _prize_\r\n    By the _loss_ we’ve so long desired:\r\n\r\n    “The lott’ry drew the humble\r\n    Often aside from his labour,\r\n      To build in the air,\r\n      And, dwelling there,\r\n    He beggar’d himself and neighbour.\r\n\r\n    “If the scheme-makers tumble\r\n    Down to their proper station,\r\n      They must starve, or work,\r\n      Turn thief, or Turk,\r\n    Or hang, for the good o’ th’ nation.”\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~“The Last.”~]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  What’s the odds?--while I am floundering here the gold fish will be\r\n  gone; and as I always was a dab at hooking the right Numbers, I must\r\n  cast for a Share of the SIX £30,000 on the 18^{th} JULY, for it is but\r\n  “giving a Sprat to catch a Herring” as a body may say, and it is the\r\n  last chance we shall have in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Memorandum.~\r\n\r\nThe above engraving is copied from one of the same size to a lottery\r\nbill of 1826: its inscription is verbatim the same as that below the\r\noriginal. In after days, this may be looked on with interest, as a\r\nspecimen of the means to which the lottery schemers were reduced, in\r\norder to attract attention to “the last.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS RESPECTING LOTTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n1569.--THE FIRST LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nDr. Rawlinson, a distinguished antiquary, produced to the Antiquarian\r\nsociety, in 1748, “A Proposal for a very rich Lottery, general without\r\nany Blankes, contayning a great N^{o} of good prices, as well of redy\r\nmoney as of Plate and certain sorts of Merchandizes, having been valued\r\nand prised by the Commandment of the Queenes most excellent Majesties\r\norder, to the entent that such Commodities as may chance to arise\r\nthereof, after the charges borne, may be converted towards the\r\nreparations of the Havens and Strength of the realme, and towards such\r\nother public good workes. The N^{o} of lotts shall be foure hundred\r\nthousand, and no more; and every lott shall be the summe of tenne\r\nshillings sterling only, and no more. To be filled by the feast of St.\r\nBartholomew. The shew of Prises ar to be seen in Cheapside, at the sign\r\nof the Queenes armes, the house of Mr. Dericke, Goldsmith, Servant to\r\nthe Queen. Some other Orders about it in 1567-8. Printed by Hen.\r\nBynneman.”\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest lottery of which we have any account. According to\r\nStow, it was begun to be drawn at the west door of St. Paul’s cathedral,\r\non the 11th of January, 1569, (11th of Elizabeth,) and continued\r\nincessantly drawing, _day and night_, till the 6th of May\r\nfollowing.[431] It was at first intended to have been drawn “at the\r\nhouse of Mr. Dericke,” who was the queen’s jeweller.[432] “Whether,”\r\nsays Maitland, “this lottery was on account of the public, or the\r\nselfish views of private persons, my author[433] does not mention; but\r\n’tis evident, by the time it took up in drawing, it must have been of\r\ngreat concern. This I have remarked as being the first of the kind I\r\nread in England.” Maitland does not seem to have been acquainted with\r\nDr. Rawlinson’s communication of the printed “Proposal” for it to the\r\nsociety of Antiquaries, which, as it states that the “commodities,” or\r\nprofits, arising therefrom were to be appropriated to the “reparations\r\nof the havens and strength of the realme,” obviates all doubt as to its\r\nbeing “on account of the public.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1586, 28th of the reign of Elizabeth, “A Lotterie, for marvellous\r\nrich and beautifull armor, was begunne to be drawn at London, in S.\r\nPaules churchyard, at the great west gate, (an house of timber and boord\r\nbeing there erected for that purpose,) on St. Peter’s day in the\r\nmorning, which lotterie continued in drawing day and night for the space\r\nof two or three daies.”[434] Of this lottery it is said, in lord\r\nBurghley’s Diary, at the end of Murden’s State papers, “June, 1586, the\r\nlottery of armour under the charge of John Calthorp determined.”[435]\r\nThis is the second English lottery of which mention has been made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1619, 16th of James I., it appears, from the following entry in the\r\nregister of charitable gifts to the corporation of Reading, that a\r\nlottery was held in that town. “Whereas at a Lottery held within the\r\nBorough of Reading, in the Year of our Ld. God 1619, Gabriel Barber\r\nGent. Agent in the sd. Lottery for the Councell & Company of Virginia of\r\nhis own good Will & Charity towarde poor Tradesmen ffreemen &\r\nInhabitants of the sd. Borough of Reading, & for the better enabling\r\nsuch poor Tradesmen to support & bear their Charges in their several\r\nPlaces & Callings in the sd. Corporation from time to time for ever\r\nfreely gave & delivered to the Mayor & Burgesses of this Corporation the\r\nSum of forty Pounds of lawfull Money of England Upon Special Trust &\r\nConfidence, that the sd. Mayor & Burgesses & their Successors shall from\r\ntime to time for ever dispose & lend these 40_l._ to & amongst Six poor\r\nTradesmen after the rate of 06_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ to each Man for the Term\r\nof five Years gratis And after those five Years ended to dispose & lend\r\nthe sd. 40_l._ by Such Soms to Six other poor Tradesmen for other five\r\nYears & so from five years to five years Successively upon good Security\r\nfor ever Neverthelesse provided & upon Condition that none of those to\r\nwhom the sd. Summs of mony shall be lent during that Term of five years\r\nshall keep either Inn or Tavern or dwell forth of the sd. Borough, but\r\nthere during that time and terme, shall as other Inhabitants of the sd.\r\nBorough reside & dwell.\r\n\r\n“Memorand. that the sd. Sum of 40_l._ came not into the hands & charge\r\nof the Mayor & Burgesses until April 1626.”\r\n\r\nThis extract was communicated to the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in 1778, by\r\na correspondent, who, referring to this gift of “Gabriel Barber, gent.,\r\nagent in the said lottery,” says, “If it be asked what is become of it\r\nnow? _gone_, it is supposed, _where the chickens went before_ during the\r\npious protectorship of Cromwell.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1630, 6th Charles I., there was a project “for the conveying of\r\ncertain springs of water into London and Westminster, from within a mile\r\nand a half of Hodsdon, in Hertfordshire, by the undertakers, Sir Edward\r\nStradling and John Lyde.” The author of this project was one Michael\r\nParker. “For defraying the expences whereof, king Charles grants them a\r\nspecial license to erect and publish a lottery or lotteries;\r\n_according_” says the record, “_to the course of other lotteries_\r\nheretofore used or practised.” This is the first mention of lotteries\r\neither in the _Fœdera_ or Statute-book. “And, for the sole privilege of\r\nbringing the said waters in aqueducts to London, they were to pay four\r\nthousand pounds per annum into the king’s exchequer: and, the better to\r\nenable them to make the said large annual payment, the king grants them\r\nleave to bring their aqueducts through any of his parks, chases, lands,\r\n&c., and to dig up the same gratis.”[436]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1653, during the commonwealth, there was a lottery at Grocers’ Hall,\r\nwhich appears to have escaped the observation of the inquirers\r\nconcerning this species of adventure. It is noticed in an old weekly\r\nnewspaper, called “Perfect Account of the Daily Intelligence 16-23\r\nNovember 1653,” by the following\r\n\r\n  ~Advertisement.~\r\n\r\n  _At the Committee for Claims for Lands in Ireland_,\r\n\r\n  Ordered, That a Lottery be at Grocers-Hall London, on Thursday 15\r\n  Decem. 1653, both for Provinces and Counties, to begin at 8 of the\r\n  clock in the forenoon of the same day; and all persons concerned\r\n  therein are to take notice thereof.\r\n\r\n  _W. Tibbs._\r\n\r\nUnder Charles II., the crown, with a view to reward its adherents who\r\nresided within the bills of mortality, and had served it with fidelity\r\nduring the interregnum, granted “Plate Lotteries;” by which is to be\r\nunderstood a gift of plate from the crown, to be disposed of in that\r\nmanner as prizes, with permission to sell tickets. According to the\r\nGazette, in April 1669, Charles II., the duke of York, (afterwards James\r\nII.,) and many of the nobility were present “at the grand plate lottery,\r\nwhich, by his majesty’s command, was then opened at the sign of the\r\nMermaid over against the mews.” This was the origin of endless schemes,\r\nunder the titles of “Royal Oak,” “Twelve-penny Lotteries,” &c., which\r\nwill be adverted to presently. They may be further understood by an\r\nintimation, published soon after the drawing sanctioned by the royal\r\nvisitors, in these words, “This is to give notice, that any persons who\r\nare desirous to farm any of the counties within the kingdom of England\r\nor dominion of Wales, in order to the setting up of a plate lottery, or\r\nany other lottery whatsoever, may repair to the lottery office, at Mr.\r\nPhilips’s house, in Mermaid-court over against the mews; where they may\r\ncontract with the trustees commissioned by his majesty’s letters patent\r\nfor the management of the said patent, on the behalf of the truly\r\nloyal, indigent officers.”[437] In those times, the crown exceeded its\r\nprerogative by issuing these patents, and the law was not put in motion\r\nto question them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Book Lotteries._\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Charles II. lotteries were drawn at the theatres.\r\nAt Vere-street theatre, which stood in Bear-yard, to which there\r\nis an entrance through a passage at the south-west corner of\r\nLincolns’-inn-fields, another from Vere-street, and a third from\r\nClare-market, Killigrew’s company performed during the seasons of 1661\r\nand 1662, and part of 1663, when they removed to the new built theatre\r\nin Drury-lane; and the Vere-street theatre was probably unoccupied until\r\nMr. Ogilby, the author of the now useless, though then useful\r\n“Itinerarium Angliæ, or Book of Roads,” adopted it, as standing in a\r\npopular neighbourhood, for the temporary purpose of drawing a lottery of\r\nbooks, which took place in 1668.\r\n\r\nBooks were often the species of property held out as a lure to\r\nadventurers, by way of lottery, for the benefit of the suffering\r\nloyalists. Among these, Blome’s Recreations, and Gwillim’s Heraldry,\r\nfirst edition, may be mentioned. In the Gazette of May 18, 1668, is the\r\nfollowing advertisement: “Mr. Ogilby’s lottery of books opens on Monday\r\nthe 25th instant, at the old Theatre between Lincoln’s-inn-fields and\r\nVere-street; where all persons concerned may repair on Monday, May 18,\r\nand see the volumes, and put in their money.” On May 25th is announced,\r\n“Mr. Ogilby’s lottery of books (adventurers coming in so fast that they\r\ncannot in so short time be methodically registered) opens not till\r\nTuesday the 2d of June; then not failing to draw; at the old Theatre\r\nbetween Lincoln’s-inn-fields and Vere-street.”\r\n\r\nA correspondent, under the signature of “A Bibliographer,” communicates\r\nto the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” from whence the notice respecting these\r\nbook lotteries is extracted, one of Ogilby’s Proposals as a curiosity,\r\nin which light it is certainly to be regarded, and therefore it has a\r\nplace here, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A SECOND PROPOSAL, by the author, for the better and more speedy\r\n  vendition of several volumes, (his own works,) by the way of a\r\n  standing _Lottery_, licensed by his royal highness the duke of York,\r\n  and assistants of the corporation of the royal fishing.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS _John Ogilby_, esq., erected a standing lottery of books, and\r\ncompletely furnished the same with very large, fair, and special\r\nvolumes, all of his own designment and composure, at vast expense,\r\nlabour, and study of twenty years; the like impressions never before\r\nexhibited in the English tongue. Which, according to the appointed time,\r\non the 10th of May, 1665, opened; and to the general satisfaction of the\r\nadventurers, with no less hopes of a clear despatch and fair advantage\r\nto the author, was several days in drawing: when its proceedings were\r\nstopt by the then growing sickness, and lay discontinued under the\r\narrest of that common calamity, till the next year’s more violent and\r\nsudden visitation, the late dreadful and surprising conflagration,\r\nswallowed the remainder, being two parts of three, to the value of three\r\nthousand pounds and upward, in that unimaginable deluge. Therefore, to\r\nrepair in some manner his so much commiserated losses, by the advice of\r\nmany his patrons, friends, and especially by the incitations of his\r\nformer adventurers, he resolves, and hath already prepared, not only to\r\nreprint all his own former editions, but others that are new, of equal\r\nvalue, and like estimation by their embellishments, and never yet\r\npublished; with some remains of the first impressions, relics preserved\r\nin several hands from the fire; to set up a second standing lottery,\r\nwhere such the discrimination of fortune shall be, that few or none\r\nshall return with a dissatisfying chance. The whole draught being of\r\ngreater advantage by much (to the adventurers) than the former. And\r\naccordingly, after publication, the author opened his office, where they\r\nmight put in their first encouragements, (_viz._) twenty shillings, and\r\ntwenty more at the reception of their fortune, and also see those\r\nseveral magnificent volumes, which their varied fortune (none being bad)\r\nshould present them.\r\n\r\n[438]But, the author now finding more difficulty than he expected, since\r\nmany of his promisers (who also received great store of tickets to\r\ndispose of, towards promotion of his business) though seeming well\r\nresolved and very willing, yet straining courtesy not to go foremost in\r\npaying their monies, linger out, driving it off till near the time\r\nappointed for drawing; which dilatoriness: (since despatch is the soul\r\nand life to his proposal, his only advantage a speedy vendition:) and\r\nalso observing how that a money dearth, a silver famine, slackens and\r\ncools the courage of adventurers; through which hazy humours magnifying\r\nmedium shillings loome like crowns, and each forty shillings a ten pound\r\nheap. Therefore, according to the present humour now reigning, he\r\nintends to adequate his design; and this seeming too large-roomed,\r\nstanding lottery, new modelled into many less and more likely to be\r\ntaken tenements, which shall not open only a larger prospect of pleasing\r\nhopes, but more real advantage to the adventurer. Which are now to be\r\ndisposed of thus: the whole mass of books or volumes, being the same\r\nwithout addition or diminution, amounting according to their known value\r\n(being the prices they have been usually disposed at) to thirteen\r\nthousand seven hundred pounds; so that the adventurers will have the\r\nabove said volumes (if all are drawn) for less than two thirds of what\r\nthey would yield in process of time, book by book. He now resolves to\r\nattemper, or mingle each prize with four allaying blanks; so bringing\r\ndown, by this means, the market from double pounds to single crowns.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSITIONS.--First, whosoever will be pleased to put in five\r\nshillings shall draw a lot, his fortune to receive the greatest or\r\nmeanest prize, or throw away his intended spending money on a blank.\r\nSecondly, whoever will adventure deeper, putting in twenty-five\r\nshillings, shall receive, if such his bad fortune be that he draws all\r\nblanks, a prize presented to him by the author of more value than his\r\nmoney (if offered to be sold) though proffered ware, &c. Thirdly, who\r\nthinks fit to put in for eight lots forty shillings shall receive nine,\r\nand the advantage of their free choice (if all blanks) of either of the\r\nworks complete, _viz._ Homer’s Iliads and Odysses, or Æsop the first and\r\nsecond volumes, the China book, or Virgil.

H., one of Mr. Urban’s contributors, mentions that he had seen an\r\nundated “Address to the Learned: or, an advantageous lottery for Books\r\nin quires; wherein each adventurer of a guinea is sure of a prize of two\r\npound value; and it is but four to one that he has a prize of three,\r\nsix, eight, twelve, or fifty pounds, as appears by the following\r\nproposals:” one thousand five hundred lots, at 1_l._ 1_s._ each, to be\r\ndrawn with the lots out of two glasses, superintended by John Lilly and\r\nEdward Darrel, esqrs., Mr. Deputy Collins, and Mr. William Proctor,\r\nstationer, two lots of 50_l._, ten of 12_l._, twenty of 8_l._,\r\nsixty-eight of 6_l._, two hundred of 3_l._, one thousand two hundred of\r\n3_l._ The undertakers were: Thomas Leigh, and D. Midwinter, at the Rose\r\nand Crown, in St. Paul’s Church-yard; Mr. Aylmer, at the Three Pigeons,\r\nand Mr. Richard Parker, under the Piazza of the Royal Exchange; Mr.\r\nNicholson, in Little Britain; Mr. Took, at the Middle Temple gate,\r\nFleet-street; Mr. Brown, at the Black Swan, without Temple-bar; Mr.\r\nSare, at Gray’s-inn gate; Mr. Lownds, at the Savoy gate; Mr. Castle,\r\nnear Scotland-yard gate; and Mr. Gillyflower, in Westminster-hall,\r\nbooksellers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLetters patent in behalf of the loyalists were from time to time\r\nrenewed, and, from the Gazette of October 11, 1675, it appears by those\r\ndated June 19, and December 17, 1674, there were granted for thirteen\r\nyears to come, “all lotteries whatsoever, invented or to be invented, to\r\nseveral truly loyal and indigent officers, in consideration of their\r\nmany faithful services and sufferings, with prohibition to all others to\r\nuse or set up the said lotteries,” unless deputations were obtained from\r\nthose officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PENNY LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of all the schemes was that drawn at the Dorset-garden\r\ntheatre, near Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, with the capital prize of\r\na thousand pound for a penny. The drawing began October 19, 1698; and,\r\nin the _Protestant Mercury_ of the following day, “its fairness (was\r\nsaid) to give universal content to all that were concerned.” In the next\r\npaper is found an inconsistent and frivolous story, as to the possessor\r\nof the prize: “Some time since, a boy near Branford, going to school one\r\nmorning, met an old woman, who asked his charity; the boy replied, he\r\nhad nothing to give her but a piece of bread and butter, which she\r\naccepted. Some time after, she met the boy again, and told him she had\r\ngood luck after his bread and butter, and therefore would give him a\r\npenny, which, after some years’ keeping, would produce many pounds: he\r\naccordingly kept it a great while; and at last, with some friend’s\r\nadvice, put it into the penny lottery, and we are informed that on\r\nTuesday last the said lot came up with 1000_l._ prize.” However absurd\r\nthis relation appears, it must be recollected those to whom it was\r\nprincipally addressed had given proof of having sufficient credulity for\r\nsuch a tale, in believing that two hundred and forty thousand shares\r\ncould be disposed of and appropriated to a single number, independent of\r\nother prizes. The scheme of the “Penny Lottery” was assailed in a tract,\r\nintituled “The Wheel of Fortune, or Nothing for a Penny; being remarks\r\non the drawing of the Penny Lottery at the Theatre Royal, in\r\nDorset-Garden,” 1698, 4to. Afterwards at this theatre there was a short\r\nexhibition of prize-fighters; and the building was totally deserted in\r\n1703.\r\n\r\nIn 1698-9, schemes were started, called “The Lucky Adventure; or,\r\nFortunate Chance, being 2000_l._ for a groat, or 3000_l._ for a\r\nshilling:” and “Fortunatus, or another adventure of 1000_l._ for a\r\npenny:” but purchasers were more wary, and the money returned in both\r\ncases.--The patentees also advertised against the “Marble-board, alias\r\nthe Woollich-board lotteries; the Figure-board, alias the\r\nWhimsey-board, and the Wyreboard lotteries.”[439]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese patents of the Restoration seem to have occasioned considerable\r\nstrife between the parties who worked under them. The following verses\r\nfrom “The Post Boy, January 3, 1698,” afford some insight to their\r\nestimation among sensible people:--\r\n\r\nA DIALOGUE _betwixt the_ NEW LOTTERIES _and the_ ROYAL OAK.\r\n\r\n      _New Lott._ To you, the mother of our schools,\r\n    Where knaves by licence manage fools,\r\n    Finding fit juncture and occasion,\r\n    To pick the pockets of the nation;\r\n    We come to know how we must treat ’em,\r\n    And to their heart’s content may cheat ’em.\r\n      _Oak._ It cheers my aged heart to see\r\n    So numerous a progeny;\r\n    I find by you, that ’tis heaven’s will\r\n    That knavery should flourish still.\r\n    You have docility and wit,\r\n    And fools were never wanting yet.\r\n      Observe the crafty auctioneer,\r\n    His art to sell waste paper dear;\r\n    When he for salmon baits his hooks,\r\n    That cormorant of offal books,\r\n    Who bites, as sure as maggots breed,\r\n    Or carrion crows on horse-flesh feed;\r\n    Fair specious titles him deceive,\r\n    To sweep what Sl---- and T----n leave.\r\n      If greedy gulls you wou’d ensnare,\r\n    Make ’em proposals wondrous fair;\r\n    Tell him strange golden show’rs shall fall,\r\n    And promise mountains to ’em all.\r\n      _New Lott._ That craft we’ve already taught,\r\n    And by that trick have millions caught;\r\n    Books, bawbles, toys, all sorts of stuff,\r\n    Have gone off this way well enough.\r\n    Nay, music, too, invades our art,\r\n    And to some tune wou’d play her part.\r\n    I’ll show you now what we are doing,\r\n    For we have divers wheels agoing.\r\n    We now have found out richer lands\r\n    Than Asia’s hills, or Afric’s sands,\r\n    And to vast treasures must give birth,\r\n    Deep hid in bowels of the earth;\r\n    In fertile Wales, and God knows where,\r\n    Rich mines of gold and silver are,\r\n    From whence we drain prodigious store\r\n    Of silver coin’d, tho’ none in ore,\r\n    Which down our throats rich coxcombs pour,\r\n    In hopes to make us vomit more.\r\n      _Oak._ This project surely must be good,\r\n    Because not eas’ly understood:\r\n    Besides, it gives a mighty scope\r\n    To the fool’s argument--vain hope.\r\n    No eagle’s eye the cheat can see,\r\n    Thro’ hope thus back’d by mystery.\r\n      _New Lott._ We have, besides, a thousand more,\r\n    For great and small, for rich and poor,\r\n    From him that can his thousands spare,\r\n    Down to the penny customer.\r\n      _Oak._ The silly mob in crowds will run,\r\n    To be at easy rates undone.\r\n    A gimcrack-show draws in the rout,\r\n    Thousands their all by pence lay out.\r\n      _New Lott._ We, by experience, find it true,\r\n    But we have methods wholly new,\r\n    Strange late-invented ways to thrive,\r\n    To make men pay for what they give,\r\n    To get the rents into our hands\r\n    Of their hereditary lands,\r\n    And out of what does thence arise,\r\n    To make ’em buy annuities.\r\n    We’ve mathematic combination,\r\n    To cheat folks by plain demonstration,\r\n    Which shall be fairly manag’d too,\r\n    The undertaker knows not how.\r\n    Besides ----\r\n      _Oak._ Pray, hold a little, here’s enough,\r\n    To beggar Europe of this stuff.\r\n    Go on, and prosper, and be great,\r\n    I am to you a puny cheat.[440]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Royal-Oak Lottery,” as the rival if not the parent of the various\r\nother demoralizing schemes, obtained the largest share of public odium.\r\nThe evils it had created are popularly set forth in a remarkable tract,\r\nentitled “The Arraignment, Trial, and Condemnation of _Squire Lottery_,\r\nalias _Royal-Oak Lottery_, London, 1699,” 8vo. The charges against the\r\noffender are arrayed under the forms imported by the title-page. The\r\nfollowing extracts are in some respects curious, as exemplifying the\r\nmanners of the times:--\r\n\r\n  _Die Lunæ vicesimo die Martii 1698/9. Anno Regni, &c._\r\n\r\nAt the Time and Place appointed, came on the Trial of _Squire Lottery_,\r\nalias _Royal-Oak Lottery_, for abundance of intolerable Tricks, Cheats,\r\nand high Misdemeanours, upon an Indictment lately found against him, in\r\norder to a National Delivery.\r\n\r\nAbout ten of the Clock, the day and year abovesaid, the Managers came\r\ninto the Court, where, in the presence of a vast confluence of People of\r\nall Ranks, the Prisoner was ordered to the Bar.\r\n\r\nProclamation being made, and a Jury of good Cits which were to try the\r\nPrisoner being sworn, the Indictment against _Squire Lottery_ alias\r\n_Royal-Oak Lottery_, was read.\r\n\r\n_The Jurors’ Names._\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Positive_, a Draper in _Covent Garden_.\r\n  Mr. _Squander_, an Oilman in _Fleet-street_.\r\n  Mr. _Pert_, a Tobacconist, _ditto_.\r\n  Mr. _Captious_, a Milliner in _Paternoster-Row_.\r\n  Mr. _Feeble_, a Coffeeman near the _Change_.\r\n  Mr. _Altrick_, a Merchant in _Gracechurch-street_.\r\n  Mr. _Haughty_, a Vintner by _Grays-Inn, Holborn_.\r\n  Mr. _Jealous_, a Cutler at _Charing-Cross_.\r\n  Mr. _Peevish_, a Bookseller in _St. Paul’s Church-yard_.\r\n  Mr. _Spilbook_, near _Fleet-bridge_.\r\n  Mr. _Noysie_, a Silkman upon _Ludgate-hill_.\r\n  Mr. _Finical_, a Barber in Cheapside.\r\n\r\n_Cl. of Ma. Squire Lottery_, alias _Royal-Oak Lottery_, you stand\r\nIndicted by the Name of _Squire Lottery_, alias _Royal-Oak Lottery_, for\r\nthat you the said _Squire Lottery_, not having the Fear of God in your\r\nHeart; nor weighing the Regard and Duty you owe, and of right ought to\r\npay to the Interest, Safety, and Satisfaction of your Fellow-Subjects;\r\nhave from time to time, and at several times, and in several places,\r\ncontrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom, under the shadow and\r\ncoverture of a Royal Oak, propagated, continued, and carried on a most\r\nunequal, intricate, and insinuating Game, to the utter ruin and\r\ndestruction of many thousand Families: And that you the said _Squire\r\nLottery_, alias _Royal-Oak Lottery_, as a common Enemy to all young\r\nPeople, and an inveterate Hater of all good Conversation and Diversion,\r\nhave, for many years last past, and do still continue, by certain\r\ncunning Tricks and Stratagems, insidiously, falsely, and impiously, to\r\ntrepan, deceive, cheat, decoy, and entice divers Ladies, Gentlemen,\r\nCitizens, Apprentices, and others, to play away their Money at manifest\r\nOdds and Disadvantage. And that you the said _Squire Lottery_, alias\r\n_Royal-Oak Lottery_, the more secretly and effectually to carry on and\r\npropagate your base, malicious, and covetous Designs and Practices, did,\r\nand do still encourage several lewd and disorderly Persons, to meet,\r\npropose, treat, consult, consent, and agree upon several unjust and\r\nillegal Methods, how to ensnare and entangle People into your delusive\r\nGame; by which means you have, for many years last past, utterly,\r\nintirely, and irrecoverably, contrary to all manner of Justice,\r\nHumanity, or good Nature, despoiled, depraved, and defrauded, an\r\nincredible number of Persons of every Rank, Age, Sex, and Condition, of\r\nall their Lands, Goods, and Effects; and from the Ruins of multitudes\r\nbuilt fine Houses, and purchased large Estates, to the great scandal and\r\nreflection on the Wisdom of the Nation, for suffering such an\r\nintolerable Impostor to pass so long unpunished. What say’st thou,\r\n_Squire Lottery_, art thou guilty of the aforesaid Crimes, Cheats,\r\nTricks, and Misdemeanours thou standest Indicted of, or not Guilty?\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ Not Guilty. But, before I proceed to make my Defence, I beg I\r\nmay be permitted the assistance of three or four learned Sharpers to\r\nplead for me, in case any Matter of Law arise.\r\n\r\nThis being assented to, the Managers of the Prosecution made their\r\nspeeches in support of the Charge, and called Captain _Pasthope_.\r\n\r\n_1st Man._ Sir, Do you know Squire _Lottery_, the Prisoner at the Bar?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ Yes, I have known him intimately for near forty years; ever\r\nsince the Restoration of King _Charles_.\r\n\r\n_1st Man._ Pray will you give the Bench and Jury an Account what you\r\nknow of him; how he came into _England_, and how he has behaved himself\r\never since.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ In order to make my Evidence more plain, I hope it will not\r\nbe judg’d much out of form, to premise two or three things.\r\n\r\n_1st Man_. Mr. _Pasthope_, Take your own method to explain yourself; we\r\nmust not abridge or direct you in any respect.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ In the years 60 and 61, among a great many poor Cavaliers,\r\n’twas my hard fate to be driven to Court for a Subsistence, where I\r\ncontinued in a neglected state, painfully waiting the moving of the\r\nWaters for several months; when at last a Rumour was spread, that a\r\ncertain Stranger was landed in _England_, that in all probability, if we\r\ncould get him the Sanction of a Patent, would be a good Friend to us\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You seem to intimate as if he was a Stranger; pray, do you know\r\nwhat Countryman he was?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ The report of his Country was very different; some would\r\nhave him a _Walloon_, some a _Dutchman_, some a _Venetian_, and others a\r\n_Frenchman_; indeed by his Policy, cunning Design, Forethought, &c. I am\r\nvery well satisfied he could be no _Englishman_.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What kind of Credentials did he bring with him to recommend him\r\nwith so much advantage?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ Why, he cunningly took upon him the Character of a\r\n_Royal-Oak Lottery_, and pretended a mighty Friendship to antiquated\r\nLoyalists: but for all that, there were those at Court that knew he had\r\nbeen banish’d out of several Countries for disorderly Practices, till at\r\nlast he pitch’d upon poor easy credulous _England_ for his Refuge.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You say then, he was a Foreigner, that he came in with the\r\nRestoration, usurp’d the Title of a _Royal Oak_, was establish’d in\r\nFriendship to the Cavaliers, and that for disorderly Practices he had\r\nbeen banish’d out of several Countries; till at last he was forc’d to\r\nfix upon _England_ as the fittest _Asylum_. But pray, Sir, how came you\r\nso intimately acquainted with him at first?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ I was about to tell you. In order to manage his Affairs, it\r\nwas thought requisite he should be provided with several Coadjutors,\r\nwhich were to be dignify’d with the Character of _Patentees_; amongst\r\nwhich number, by the help of a friendly Courtier, I was admitted for\r\none.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Oh! then I find you was a Patentee. Pray, how long did you\r\ncontinue in your Patentee’s Post? and what were the Reasons that urg’d\r\nyou to quit it at last?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ I kept my Patentee’s Station nine years, in which time I had\r\nclear’d 4000_l._, and then, upon some Uneasiness and Dislike, I sold it\r\nfor 700_l._\r\n\r\n_Man._ Pray, Captain, tell the Court more fully what was the Reason that\r\nprevail’d with you to relinquish such a profitable place.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ I had two very strong Reasons for quitting my Post; _viz._\r\nRemorse of Conscience, and Apprehension of consequent Danger. To tell\r\nyou the truth, I saw so many bad Practices encourag’d and supported, and\r\nso many persons of both Sexes ruin’d; I saw so much Villany perfected\r\nand projected, and so many other intolerable Mischiefs within the\r\ncompass of every day’s Proceeding, that partly through the stings of my\r\nMind and the apprehensions I was under of the Mob, with a great deal of\r\nReluctancy I quitted my Post.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Captain, I find you’re nicely qualify’d for an Evidence, pray,\r\ntherefore, give the Court an Account what Methods the Prisoner us’d to\r\ntake to advance his business.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ The way in my time, and I suppose ’tis the same still, was\r\nto send out Sharpers and Setters into all parts of the Town, and to give\r\n’em direction to magnify the Advantage, Equality, and Justice of his\r\nGame, in order to decoy Women and Fools to come and play away their\r\nMoney.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Well, but sure he had no Women or Fools of Quality, Rank, or\r\nReputation, that came to him? According to the common Report that passes\r\nupon him, there’s none but the very Scoundrels and Rabble, the very\r\nDregs and Refuse of Fools, will think him worth their Conversation.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ Truly, he had ’em of all sorts, as well Lord-fools and\r\nLady-fools, Knight-fools and Esquire-fools, or any other sort of Fools:\r\nand, indeed, he made no difference between ’em neither; a Cobler-fool\r\nhad as much respect as a Lord-fool, in proportion to the money he had in\r\nhis Pocket; and _pro hac vice_ had as extensive a Qualification to\r\ncommand, domineer, and hector, as the best Fool of ’em all.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Did you never observe any of these Fools to get any money of him?\r\nI can’t imagine what it could be that could influence ’em to embark with\r\nhim, if there was nothing to be got.\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ There was never any body that ever got any thing of him in\r\nthe main: now and then one by chance might carry off a small matter; and\r\nso ’twas necessary they should, for otherwise his Constitution must\r\ndissolve in course.\r\n\r\n_Man._ ’Tis a great mystery to me, that so many People should pursue a\r\nGame where every body’s a Loser at last; but pray, Captain, then, what\r\nare the odds the Prisoner is reputed to have against those that play\r\nwith him?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ No body can tell you their Advantage; ’tis a cunning\r\nintricate _Contexture_, and truly I very much question whether the\r\noriginal Projector himself had a perfect Idea of the Odds: at a full\r\nTable and deep Play, I have seen him clear 600_l._ in less than an hour.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What are the Odds he owns himself?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ Only 32 Figures against 27, which indeed is Odds enough to\r\ninsure all the money at length. But this, it seems, was an Advantage\r\nthat was allow’d him, that he might be able to keep a good House,\r\nrelieve the Poor, and pay an annual Pension to the Crown or the\r\nCourtiers.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You say, by his original Agreement he’s to keep a good House:\r\npray after all, what sort of House is it he does keep?\r\n\r\n_Past._ Why, he dines at the Tavern, where any body that has 40 or\r\n50_l._ to play away with him the Afternoon, may be admitted into his\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What, does he entertain none but those that have 40 or 50_l._ to\r\nlose?\r\n\r\n_Past._ He never converses with any Person that has no money: if they\r\nhave no money, their Company’s burdensom and ungrateful, and the Waiters\r\nhave Directions to keep ’em out.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Does he do this to the very Persons he has ruin’d, and won all\r\nthey have? That, methinks, is a pitch of Barbarity beyond the common\r\ndegree: I hardly ever read or heard of any thing so exaltedly cruel and\r\nbrutish, in all the Accounts of my Life.\r\n\r\n_Past._ I have seen abundance of Examples of this nature, one, in\r\nparticular, which I shall never forget; a poor Lady, that had lost\r\n350_l._ _per annum_ to him, beside two or three thousand pounds in ready\r\nmoney, basely and inhumanly hal’d out of doors, but for asking for a\r\nglass of Sack.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You were mentioning his Charity to the Poor too; is there any\r\nthing of reality in that?\r\n\r\n_Past._ For my part, I never heard of one good Act he has done in the\r\nwhole course of his Life: secret Charity is the most meritorious, ’tis\r\ntrue; and perhaps it may be that way he may communicate his, for indeed\r\nI never heard of any he did in publick.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You were mentioning too an annual Pension to the Crown; what is\r\nit he pays to the Crown?\r\n\r\n_Past._ Indeed I cannot be positive in that: to the best of my\r\nremembrance ’tis four thousand pounds _per annum_: in compensation for\r\nwhich, beside the general liberty he has to cheat and abuse the World,\r\nhe has the sole Privilege of Licensing all other Cheats and Impostors,\r\ncommonly known by the Name of Lotteries.\r\n\r\n_2d Man._ You were speaking something, Captain _Pasthope_, just now, as\r\nif the Prisoner was intrusted with these Advantages for the benefit of\r\nsome poor Cavaliers, which were to be the Patentees, as you call ’em.\r\nPray tell the Jury what kind of Cavaliers these Patentees were.\r\n\r\n_Past._ That was all but a Blind, a pure Trick to deceive the World: the\r\nPatentees, in the main, were either Sharpers or broken Tradesman, or\r\nsome such sort or Vermin, that had cunningly twisted themselves into\r\nthe business under the shadow of Cavaliers.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Pray, what Opinion had the World of the Prisoner when he first\r\ncame to be known in _England_?\r\n\r\n_Pasthope._ The same that it has of him now: all wise men look’d upon\r\nhim as a Cheat, and a dangerous Spark to be let loose in publick among\r\nour English Youth: and indeed I have heard a great many sober men pass\r\nvery sharp Censures upon the Wisdom of the Court for intrusting him with\r\na Royal Authority.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What kind of Censures were they that they past? do you remember\r\nany of them particularly?\r\n\r\n_Past._ Yes, I remember several things that I am almost ashamed to\r\nmention. I have heard ’em often reflecting what an intolerable Shame and\r\nScandal it was, that a whole Kingdom should be sacrificed to the\r\nInterest of two or three Courtiers, and three or four scurvy mercenary\r\nPatentees; that so many thousand Families should be ruin’d, and no\r\nnotice taken of it; that so many Wives should be seduc’d to rob and\r\nbetray their Husbands, so many Children and Servants their Parents and\r\nMasters, and so many horrid Mischiefs transacted daily under the shadow\r\nof this pretended _Royal-Oak Lottery_, and no manner of means used to\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\n_2d Man._ But, Captain, did you never hear of any Person that got money\r\nof the Prisoner in the main?\r\n\r\n_Past._ Not one. I defy him to produce one single person that’s a\r\nGainer, against a hundred thousand he has ruin’d. I’m confident I have a\r\nCatalogue by me of several thousands that have been utterly undone by\r\nhim, within the compass of my own Experience.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What does the Town in general say of him?\r\n\r\n_Past._ The town, here-a-late, is grown so inveterate and incens’d\r\nagainst him, that I am very well assur’d that if he had not been call’d\r\nto account in the very nick, the Mob would have speedily taken him into\r\ntheir correction.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Well, Sir, you hear what the Witness has said against you; will\r\nyou ask him any Questions?\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ Only one; and leave the rest till I come to make my general\r\nDefence. Sir, I desire to know whether you was not one that was turn’d\r\nout upon the last Renewal of the Patent?\r\n\r\n_Past._ No, Sir, I was not. You might have remember’d that I told you I\r\nsaw so much of your Falshood and Tricks, and so many innocent People\r\ndaily sacrific’d, to support a Society of lewd, debauch’d, impertinent,\r\nand withal imperious Cannibals, that I thought it my best way to quit\r\nyour Fraternity, and pack off with that little I had got, and leave you\r\nto manage your mathematical Balls, &c. by your self.\r\n\r\n_Man._ I suppose, Sir, you will ask him no more Questions, and so we’ll\r\ncall another Witness.\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ No, Sir, I have done with him.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Call Squire _Frivolous_, the Counsellor: Sir, do you know _Squire\r\nLottery_, the Prisoner?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ I have been acquainted with him several years, to my great\r\nCost and Damage. The first time I had the misfortune to know him, was at\r\nan Act at _Oxford_ about twenty years ago; where among abundance of\r\nother young Fools that he entic’d to sell their Books for Money to play\r\nwith him, &c. I was one.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What, I hope, he was not so barbarous as to decoy the poor young\r\nGentlemen out of their Books?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ Yes, out of every thing they had, and out of the College to\r\nboot: For my own part I have reason to curse him, I’m sure; He flatter’d\r\nme up with so many Shams and false Pretences, and deluded me with so\r\nmany chimerical Notions and cunning Assurances, and urg’d me so long\r\nfrom one deceitful Project to another, till at last he had trickt me out\r\nof all I had in the world, and then turn’d me over to the scorn and\r\nlaughter of my Friends and Acquaintance.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Can you give the Bench any particular Names of Persons he has\r\nruin’d?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ I have a Collection of Names in my Pocket, which I’m sure\r\nhe can’t object against, that have lost fourteen or fifteen thousand\r\nPound _per Annum_, within my own Knowledg and Acquaintance.\r\n\r\n_Man._ That’s a round Sum: But, pray, Mr. _Frivolous_, for the\r\nsatisfaction of the Jury, mention a few of their Names.\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ I suppose, _Squire Lottery_, you must remember the Kentish\r\nSquire in the Blue Coat, that you won the six hundred Pound _per Annum_\r\nof, in less than five months. You remember the Lord’ Steward that lost\r\nan Estate of his own of three hundred Pound _per Annum_, and run four\r\nthousand Pound in Arrears to his Lord beside. You remember, I suppose,\r\nthe West-India Widow, that lost the Cargo of two Ships, valued at\r\nfifteen hundred Pound, in less than a month. I know you can’t forget the\r\nhonest Lady at _St. James’s_, that sold all her Goods, Plate, and China,\r\nfor about seven hundred Pound, and paid it all away to you, as near as I\r\nremember, in three mornings. I know you can’t forget the three\r\nMerchants’ Daughters that play’d away their whole Fortunes, _viz._\r\nfifteen hundred Pounds apiece in less than two months. You remember the\r\nSilkman from _Ludgate-hill_; the young Draper in _Cornhil_; the Country\r\nParson; the Doctor of Physick’s Daughter; the Lady’s Woman; the\r\nMerchant’s Apprentice; the Marine Captain; the Ensign of the Guards; the\r\nCoffeeman’s Neece; the old Justice’s Nephew; and abundance of others,\r\nwhich I have in my Catalogue, that you have cheated out of large Sums,\r\nand utterly ruin’d.\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ I desire that he may be ask’d, what it was that influenc’d\r\nhim at first to make such a Catalogue?\r\n\r\n_Man._ He desires to know upon what account it was that you made this\r\nCollection of Names?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ I had once a design to have him call’d to an Account, and\r\nforc’d to a Restitution; in which case I thought the Names of these\r\nPersons might be of some use to me.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What Method did you propose to your self to bring him to a\r\nRestitution?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ I had a Notion, that if I drew up the Case, and got it\r\nrecommended to the Honourable House of Commons, they would have thought\r\nthe Prisoner worth their correction: But this he got intelligence of,\r\nand employ’d one of his Agents to make up the matter with me.\r\n\r\n_Man._ What, I suppose you mean he brib’d you with a Sum of Money to\r\ndecline the Prosecution?\r\n\r\n_Frivolous._ Truly you have hit of the very thing; he knew that I was\r\npoor, and he was guilty, and so compounded with me for a few Guineas to\r\nlet the thing fall: And indeed, if I am not misinform’d, his Art of\r\nBribing, &c. has guarded him so long from the Punishments which the Laws\r\nof the Land, and common Justice, have provided for such notorious\r\nOffenders.\r\n\r\nOther witnesses having been called, the arraigned defended himself as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ Sir, I intend to spend as little of your time as I can: I\r\nperceive, that, let me say what I will, you are prepar’d to over-rule\r\nit, and so I’ll only say a few words, and call three or four Witnesses\r\nto prove my reputation, and then leave the good Men and true of the\r\nJury, upon whose Verdict I must stand or fall, to use me as they shall\r\nbest judg the nature of my Case deserves.\r\n\r\nI know, Gentlemen, the tide of Prejudice runs very fierce against me; so\r\nthat let me say what I will, I’m satisfy’d it will be all to very little\r\npurpose; an ill Name to a Person in my condition is certain Death, which\r\nindeed makes me a little more indifferent in making my defence.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, look upon me, I am the very Image of some of you, a\r\nmarried Protestant; upon which account I’m confident I may rely upon a\r\nlittle of your Justice, if not your Favour.\r\n\r\nThe Crimes I am charged with are indeed very great, and, what’s worse,\r\nthere’s some of ’em I can never expect to evince. But then, Gentlemen, I\r\nhope you’l consider, that whatever I did, was purely in the prosecution\r\nof my occupation; and you know withal what Authority I had for it; so\r\nthat if by chance, in this long tract of time, every thing should not be\r\nso nicely conformable as you expect, I hope you’l take care to lay the\r\nSaddle upon the right Horse.\r\n\r\nYou all know that Covetousness and Cheating are the inseparable\r\nCompanions of a Gamester; divide him from them, and he’s the most\r\ninsignificant Creature in Nature. And, Gentlemen, I appeal to your\r\nselves, if a little useful lying and falshood be not (in some cases) not\r\nonly tolerable, but commendable. I dare say you will agree with me in\r\nthis, that if all the Knaves and Cheats of the Nation were call’d to the\r\nBar and executed, there would only be a few Fools left to defend the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, as I told you before, I won’t spend your time, and\r\ntherefore I’ll call my Witnesses. Call Captain _Quondam_.\r\n\r\n_Cryer._ Call Capt. _Quondam_.\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ Sir, I desire you would give the Court an account what you\r\nknow of me, as to Life and Conversation.\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ I have known the Prisoner for several years, and have been\r\noften in his company upon particular occasions and never saw any thing\r\nthat was rude or unhandsome by him.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Pray, noble Captain, what Countryman are you?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ Sir, I am a West-Countryman.\r\n\r\n_Man._ An English West-Country, or a _West-India_ Man? or what?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ I am a West-Countryman of his Majesty’s own Dominions, of the\r\nKingdom of _Ireland_, in the County of _Cork_, and Parish of _Durrus_ in\r\nthe Barony of _West-Carbury_, near the great Bogg of _Longuar_, Gent.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You’re a West-Countryman with a Witness. And, pray, how long have\r\nyou been in _England_?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ Ever since the last year of my Soveraign Lord King _James_.\r\n\r\n_Man._ And, pray, how long have you been a Captain?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ I was born so; my Father, my Grandfather, great Grandfather,\r\nand most of my Kin, were all Captains before me.\r\n\r\n_Man._ You say you have been often in the Prisoner’s Company; pray where\r\nhave you been in his Company, and upon what account?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ I have been in his Company at _Epsom_, _Tunbridge_,\r\n_Lambeth_, _Islington_, and at several other places both in Town and\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Well, but you ha’n’t told what was the occasion that brought you\r\nso oft into his Company.\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ He desired me to go along with him to help him to divert and\r\nentertain his Guests, especially the Ladies that us’d to visit him.\r\n\r\n_Man._ I suppose you’re one of his Dependents: had you never no salary\r\nfrom him?\r\n\r\n_Quondam._ I have had several Favours from him, and I must own I love\r\nhim very well; and, by my Shoul, I believe he’s a very honest Man, and a\r\ngood Christian.\r\n\r\n_Man._ Who’s your next evidence?\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ I desire Mr. _Scamper_ may be call’d.\r\n\r\n_Cry._ Call Mr. _Scamper_.\r\n\r\n_Lottery._ Pray, Mr. _Scamper_, give the Court an Account what you know\r\nof me, as to my manner of living and behaviour in the World.\r\n\r\n_Scamper._ You know, _Squire Lottery_, your Acquaintance and mine is but\r\nof a late Date; I never saw you till last _May_ at _Lambeth Wells_, and\r\nthen ’twas but by accident too.\r\n\r\nAfter other witnesses called in his behalf, whose testimony, however,\r\ntended to inculpate Squire “Royal Oak,” the evidence was summed up.\r\n\r\n“Then the jury withdrew to consider of their verdict, and afterwards\r\nthey returned into the court, and the prisoner was brought again to the\r\nbar and found guilty, according to the indictment, and afterwards\r\nreceived sentence, together with Mr. _Auction_ and Dr. _Land-Bank_, who\r\nwere both tryed, convicted, and condemned; and their trials will be\r\npublished with all possible speed. FINIS.”\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt, that the representations in the preceding\r\nsatire are substantially correct. Private and fallacious lotteries were\r\nat this time become so general, not only in London, but in most other\r\ngreat cities and towns of England, whereby the lower people and the\r\nservants and children of good families were defrauded, that an act of\r\nparliament was therefore passed 10 and 11 William III. c. 17, for\r\nsuppressing such lotteries; “even although they might be set up under\r\ncolour of patents or grants under the great seal. Which said grants or\r\npatents,” says the preamble “are against the common good, welfare, and\r\npeace of the kingdom, and are void and against law.” A penalty therefore\r\nof five hundred pounds was laid on the proprietors of any such\r\nlotteries, and of twenty pounds on every adventurer in them.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the like disposition to fraud and gaining\r\nprevailed again, till fresh laws were enacted for their\r\nsuppression.[441]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is observed, that if the lottery office keepers of the present\r\ncentury could be credited, their adventurers enjoyed greater gaming\r\nprivileges than the world ever produced; and yet it is an indubitable\r\nfact, that in the early state lotteries the advantages offered were\r\neminently superior to those of recent times.\r\n\r\nThe Post Boy of December 27 says, “We are informed that the\r\nparliamentary lottery will be fixed in this manner:--150,000 tickets\r\nwill be delivered out at 10_l._ each ticket, making in all the sum of\r\n1,500,000_l._ sterling; the principal whereof is to be sunk, the\r\nparliament allowing nine per cent. interest for the whole during the\r\nterm of thirty-two years, which interest is to be divided as follows:\r\n3750 tickets will be prizes from 1000_l._ to 5_l._ per annum during the\r\nsaid thirty-two years; all the other tickets will be blanks, so that\r\nthere will be thirty-nine of these to one prize, but then each blank\r\nticket will be entitled to fourteen shillings a year for the term of\r\nthirty-two years, which is better than an annuity for life at ten per\r\ncent. over and above the chance of getting a prize.” Such was the\r\neagerness of the public in subscribing to the above profitable scheme,\r\nthat Mercers-hall was literally crowded, and the clerks were found\r\nincompetent to receive the influx of names. 600,000_l._ was subscribed\r\nJanuary 21; and on the 28th of February the sum of 1,500,000_l._ was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rage for lotteries reigned uncontrolled; and the newspapers of the\r\nday teemed with proposals issued by every ravenous adventurer who could\r\ncollect a few valuable articles; and from those, shopkeepers took the\r\nhint, and goods of every description were converted into prizes, even\r\nneckcloths, snuff-boxes, toothpick-cases, linen, muslin, and plate. The\r\nprices of tickets were generally sixpence, a shilling, half a crown, &c.\r\nAt the latter end of the year just mentioned, the magistrates, being\r\nalarmed, declared their intention of putting the act of William and Mary\r\nin force, which levied a penalty of 500_l._ on the proprietor, and\r\n20_l._ on each purchaser.\r\n\r\nMatthew West, a goldsmith, of Clare-street, Clare-market, appears to\r\nhave been the man who first divided lottery tickets into shares. He\r\nadvertised, in 1712, that he had sold 100 tickets in the million and an\r\nhalf lottery in twentieths, and purposed pursuing his plan, which was\r\nwell received.\r\n\r\nThe lottery for 1714 contained 50,000 tickets at 10_l._ each, with 6982\r\nprizes and 43,018 blanks; two of the former were 10,000_l._, with one of\r\n5, another of 4000_l._, a third of 3000_l._, and a fourth of 2000_l._,\r\nfive of 1000_l._, ten of 500_l._, twenty of 200_l._, fifty of 100_l._,\r\nfour hundred of 50_l._, and six thousand, four hundred, and ninety-one\r\nof 20_l._\r\n\r\nBesides the drawing for prizes and blanks, there was another for the\r\ncourse of payment, and each 1000 tickets was called a course. The\r\npayments to the receivers were on the 10th of November and 10th of\r\nDecember, 1713. When the tickets were drawn, they were exchanged for\r\nstanding orders, and thus rendered assignable by endorsement; all the\r\nblanks were repaid the 10_l._ per ticket at one payment, in the order\r\ntheir course of payment happened to fall, and they bore an interest of\r\nfour per cent. from Michaelmas 1713. The prizes were payable in the same\r\nmanner: the first drawn ticket had 500_l._; the last 1000_l._ besides\r\nthe general chance; 35,000_l._ per annum was payable weekly from the\r\nExchequer to the paymaster for the discharge of the principal and\r\ninterest, and the whole funds of the civil list were chargeable for\r\nthirty-two years for 35,000_l._ per annum.[442]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the schemes which preceded the bubbles of 1720 was an\r\ninsurance-office for lottery tickets, opened at Mercers-hall; and\r\n120,000_l._ was actually subscribed on the following terms: for every\r\nninety-six tickets insured, the proprietors agreed to allow to the\r\ncompany (after the tickets were drawn) 16_s._ per ticket, and five per\r\ncent. on such prizes as occurred to the ninety-six tickets, the company\r\nreturning the tickets, and in case the prizes did not amount to 288_l._\r\nvaluing the prizes at par; the company to make up the money 3_l._ for\r\nevery ticket. For every forty-eight tickets the proprietors agreed to\r\nallow 19_s._ per ticket, and five per cent. on the prizes as above; the\r\ncompany making up the tickets 144_l._ or 3_l._ per ticket, and so on\r\ndown to twelve tickets. The proprietors of the tickets to advance no\r\nmoney for this security; but, when drawn, to allow as above; the tickets\r\nto be deposited with the company, and placed by them under seal in the\r\nbank of England; if not called for in ninety days after the drawing, to\r\nbe forfeited.[443]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1712, gambling prevailed in smaller private and unlawful lotteries,\r\nunder the denomination of sales of gloves, fans, cards, plate, &c.; also\r\noffices were opened for insurances on marriages, births, christenings,\r\nservices, &c. and daily advertisements thereof were published in the\r\nnewspapers. By an act of the tenth of queen Anne, keepers of these\r\nlotteries and offices were subjected to a penalty of 500_l._ In 1716,\r\nthe spirit of adventure was excited by the sale of chances and parts of\r\nchances of tickets, which occasioned parliament again to interfere: all\r\nsuch practices, and all undertakings resembling lotteries, or founded on\r\nthe state lottery, were declared illegal, and prohibited under a penalty\r\nof 100_l._ beyond the penalties previously enacted against private\r\nlotteries.[444]\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCKY NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nThe attention of “the Spectator” was directed to the lottery mania\r\nprevailing at this period. One of its writers observing, on the\r\npredilection for particular numbers, ranks it among the pastimes and\r\nextravagancies of human reason, which is of so busy a nature, that it\r\nwill exert itself on the meanest trifles, and work even when it wants\r\nmaterials. He instances, that when a man has a mind to adventure his\r\nmoney in a lottery, every figure of it appears equally alluring, and as\r\nlikely to succeed as any of its fellows. They all of them have the same\r\npretensions to goodluck, stand upon the same foot of competition; and no\r\nmanner of reason can be given, why a man should prefer one to the other,\r\nbefore the lottery is drawn. In this case therefore, caprice very often\r\nacts in the place of reason, and forms to itself some groundless\r\nimaginary motive, where real and substantial ones are wanting. I know a\r\nwell-meaning man that is very well pleased to risk his good fortune upon\r\nthe number 1711, because it is the year of our Lord. I am acquainted\r\nwith a tacker that would give a good deal for the number 134. On the\r\ncontrary, I have been told of a certain zealous dissenter, who being a\r\ngreat enemy to popery, and believing that bad men are the most fortunate\r\nin this world, will lay two to one on the number 666 against any other\r\nnumber; because, says he, it is the number of the beast. Several would\r\nprefer the number 12000 before any other, as it is the number of the\r\npounds in the great prize. In short, some are pleased to find their own\r\nage in their number; some that they have got a number which makes a\r\npretty appearance in the cyphers; and others, because it is the same\r\nnumber that succeeded in the last lottery. Each of these, upon no other\r\ngrounds, thinks he stands fairest for the great lot, and that he is\r\npossessed of what may not be improperly called the _golden number_.\r\n\r\nI remember among the advertisements in the “Post Boy” of September the\r\n27th, I was surprised to see the following one:\r\n\r\n  _This is to give notice, that ten shillings over and above the\r\n  market-price will be given for the ticket in the 1500000l. Lottery_,\r\n  N^{o} 132, _by Nath. Cliff, at the Bible and Three Crowns in\r\n  Cheapside_.\r\n\r\nThis advertisement has given great matter of speculation to coffee-house\r\ntheorists. Mr. Cliff’s principles and conversation have been canvassed\r\nupon this occasion, and various conjectures made, why he should thus set\r\nhis heart upon N^{o} 132. I have examined all the powers in those\r\nnumbers, broken them into fractions, extracted the square and cube root,\r\ndivided and multiplied them all ways, but could not arrive at the secret\r\ntill about three days’ ago, when I received the following letter from an\r\nunknown hand, by which I find that Mr. Nathaniel Cliff is only the\r\nagent, and not the principal, in this advertisement.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Spectator,\r\n\r\n“I am the person that lately advertised I would give ten shillings more\r\nthan the current price for the ticket N^{o} 132 in the lottery now\r\ndrawing; which is a secret I have communicated to some friends, who\r\nrally me incessantly upon that account. You must know I have but one\r\nticket, for which reason, and a certain dream I have lately had more\r\nthan once, I was resolved it should be the number I most approved. I am\r\nso positive I have pitched upon the great lot, that I could almost lay\r\nall I am worth of it. My visions are so frequent and strong upon this\r\noccasion, that I have not only possessed the lot, but disposed of the\r\nmoney which in all probability it will sell for. This morning, in\r\nparticular, I set up an equipage which I look upon to be the gayest in\r\nthe town; the liveries are very rich, but not gaudy. I should be very\r\nglad to see a speculation or two upon lottery subjects, in which you\r\nwould oblige all people concerned, and in particular\r\n\r\n  “Your most humble servant,\r\n\r\n  “George Gosling.”\r\n\r\n“P.S. Dear Spec, if I get the 12000_l._ I’ll make thee a handsome\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\nAfter having wished my correspondent good luck, and thanked him for his\r\nintended kindness, I shall for this time dismiss the subject of the\r\nlottery, and only observe, that the greatest part of mankind are in some\r\ndegree guilty of my friend Gosling’s extravagance. We are apt to rely\r\nupon future prospects, and become really expensive while we are only\r\nrich in possibility. We live up to our expectations, not to our\r\npossessions, and make a figure proportionable to what we may be, not\r\nwhat we are. We outrun our present income, as not doubting to disburse\r\nourselves out of the profits of some future place, project, or reversion\r\nthat we have in view. It is through this temper of mind, which is so\r\ncommon among us, that we see tradesmen break, who have met with no\r\nmisfortunes in their business; and men of estates reduced to poverty,\r\nwho have never suffered from losses or repairs, tenants, taxes, or\r\nlaw-suits. In short, it is this foolish sanguine temper, this depending\r\nupon contingent futurities, that occasions romantic generosity,\r\nchimerical grandeur, senseless ostentation, and generally ends in\r\nbeggary and ruin. The man who will live above his present circumstances\r\nis in great danger of living in a little time much beneath them, or, as\r\nthe _Italian_ proverb runs, the man who lives by hope will die by\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nIt should be an indispensable rule in life, to contract our desires to\r\nour present condition, and whatever may be our expectations, to live\r\nwithin the compass of what we actually possess. It will be time enough\r\nto enjoy an estate when it comes into our hands; but if we anticipate\r\nour good fortune, we shall lose the pleasure of it when it arrives, and\r\nmay possibly never possess what we have so foolishly counted upon.[445]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~The Lottery Wheel, 1826.~]\r\n\r\nThis engraving is slipped on here for the sake of readers who are fond\r\nof _cuts_, rather than as an illustration of any thing immediately\r\npreceding. An explanation of it will occur in the ensuing sheet, with\r\nseveral amusing prints relating to the present subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Drawing Prizes.~]\r\n\r\nIn “_The Examiner_”[446] there is an article on Lotteries by Mr. George\r\nSmeeton, of Bermondsey: wherein he says, “I am glad to see that Mr. Hone\r\nhas taken up the subject in his _Every-Day Book_, by giving us a view of\r\nthe drawing of the lottery, 1751; and this month (October) I hope he\r\nwill treat us with a continuation of it. The print by N. Parr, in six\r\ncompartments, entitled _Les Divertissements de la Loterie_, is worthy of\r\nhis attention: it is a lively and true picture of the folly,\r\ninfatuation, and roguery of the times. If he has not the print (which is\r\nrather scarce) I can furnish him with it out of my portfolio.” Mr.\r\nSmeeton has obligingly communicated the loan of his engraving, from\r\nwhence the representation on this page has been selected. The original\r\nprint, designed by J. Marchant, drawn by H. Gravelot, and engraved by\r\nParr, was “published by E. Ryland, in Ave Mary-lane,” in the year 17--\r\nhundred odd; the scissars having snipped away from this copy of the\r\nengraving the two figures which particularized the year, it cannot be\r\nspecified, though from the costume it appears to have been in the reign\r\nof George II.\r\n\r\nParr’s print is in six compartments: the four corner ones represent, 1.\r\n“Good Luck--£1000 prize;” a scene of rejoicing at the news. 2. “Bad\r\nLuck--what, all blanks?” a scene of social disturbance. 3. “Oh--let\r\nFortune be kind;” the desires of a female party in conference with an\r\nold woman, who divines by coffee-grounds. 4. “Dear Doctor! consult the\r\nstars;” another female party waiting on a fortune-teller for a cast of\r\nhis office. The middle compartment at the bottom has a view of\r\n“Exchange-alley,” with its frequenters, in high business. The middle\r\ncompartment, above it, is the drawing of the lottery in the view now\r\nplaced before the reader, wherein it may be perceived that the female\r\nvisitants are pewed off on one side and the men on the other; and that\r\nthe pickpockets dextrously exercise their vocation among the promiscuous\r\ncrowd at the moment when the drawing of a thousand pound prize excites a\r\nstrong interest, and a female attracts attention by proclaiming herself\r\nthe holder of the lucky “No. 765.”\r\n\r\nTo this eager display of the ticket by the fortunate lady, a\r\nrepresentation of a scene at the drawing of “the very last lottery that\r\nwill ever be drawn in England” might be a collateral illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFORTUNATE LADY.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of November, 1826, a lady named Free, who had come up from the\r\ncountry to try her fortune in the lottery, complained to the Lord Mayor,\r\nat the Mansion-house, that she had been deprived of her property, the\r\nsixteenth share of a 30,000_l._ prize, by the misconduct of those\r\nengaged in conducting the drawing. She stated, that she chose the ticket\r\nNo. 17,092.\r\n\r\nThe _Lord Mayor_.--You had some particular reason, then, for selecting\r\nthat number?\r\n\r\nThe _Complainant_ replied, it was true, she had; she wished to have a\r\nticket with the number of the year in which she was born, and finding\r\nthat she could not get that precise number, she took one of 17,000,\r\ninstead of 1700, as the most fortunate approach. So indeed it turned out\r\nto be; for she was sitting in the hall where the lottery was drawn, and\r\nheard her number distinctly cried out as one of the 30,000_l._ prizes,\r\nand with her own eyes she distinctly saw the officer stamp it.\r\nNevertheless, another ticket had been returned as the prize.\r\n\r\nThe _Lord Mayor_ doubted, from the manner in which the tickets were well\r\nknown to be drawn, whether the complainant’s anxiety had not made her\r\nmistake a similar number for her own.\r\n\r\nThe _Complainant_.--“Oh no, my lord; it is impossible that I can be\r\nmistaken, though other people say I am. I shall not give up my claim, on\r\nthe word of lottery-office clerks. If there’s any mistake, it is on\r\ntheir part; I trust to my own _senses_.”\r\n\r\nThe _Lord Mayor_ observed, that there was scarcely any trusting even to\r\nthe “senses” on such occasions; and asked her, whether she did not\r\nalmost feel the money in her pockets at the very time she fancied she\r\nheard her number announced?\r\n\r\nThe _Complainant_ assured his lordship, that she heard the announcement\r\nas calmly as could be expected, and that she by no means fainted away.\r\nShe certainly made sure of having the property; she sat in the hall, and\r\nwent out when the other expectants came away.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope, the marshal, who stated that he was in attendance officially\r\nat the drawing, to keep the peace, declared that he heard all the\r\nfortunate numbers announced, and he was sorry to be compelled to state\r\nhis conviction that this belonging to the lady was not one of them.\r\n\r\nThe _Lord Mayor_ said, he was afraid the complainant had deceived\r\nherself. He dismissed the application, recommending her to go to the\r\nstamp-office, and apply to the commissioners, who would do any thing\r\nexcept pay the money to satisfy her.[447]\r\n\r\nIn allusion to the lady’s name, and his decision on her case, his\r\nlordship is said to have observed on her departure, “not Free and\r\n_Easy_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReverting to a former period, for the sake of including some remarkable\r\nnotices of lotteries adduced by Mr. Smeeton, we find him saying, on the\r\nauthority of the “London Gazette,” May 17, 1688, that, besides the\r\nlottery at the Vere-street theatre, “Ogilby, the better to carry on his\r\n_Britannia_, had a lottery of books at _Garraway’s Coffee-house_, in\r\n‘Change-alley.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smeeton has the following three paragraphs:--\r\n\r\nLotteries of various kinds seem to have been very general about this\r\nperiod; indeed so much so, that government, issued a notice in the\r\n_London Gazette_, Sept. 27, 1683, to prevent the drawing of any\r\nlotteries (and especially a newly-invented lottery, under the name of\r\nthe riffling, or raffling lottery) except those under his majesty’s\r\nletters patent for thirteen years, granted to persons for\r\ntheir sufferings, and have their seal of office with this\r\ninscription--‘_Meliora Designavi_.’\r\n\r\nIn 1683, prince Rupert dying rather poor, a plan was devised to “raise\r\nthe wind” by disposing of all his jewels; but as the public were not\r\nsatisfied with the mode of drawing the lotteries, on account of the many\r\ncheats practised on them, they would not listen to any proposals, until\r\nthe _king himself_ guaranteed to see that all was fair, and also, that\r\nMr. Francis Child, the goldsmith, at Temple-bar, London, would be\r\nanswerable for their several adventures; as appears by the _London\r\nGazette_, Oct. 1, 1683:--“These are to give notice, that the jewels of\r\nhis late royal highness prince Rupert have been particularly valued and\r\nappraised by Mr. Isaac Legouch, Mr. Christopher Rosse, and Mr. Richard\r\nBeauvoir, jewellers, the whole amounting to twenty thousand pounds, and\r\nwill be sold by way of lottery, each lot to be five pounds. The biggest\r\nprize will be a great pearl necklace, valued at 8,000_l._, and none less\r\nthan 100_l._ A printed particular of the said appraisement, with their\r\ndivisions into lots, will be delivered gratis, by Mr. Francis Child, at\r\nTemple-bar, London, into whose hands such as are willing to be\r\nadventurers are desired to pay their money, on or before the first day\r\nof November next. As soon as the whole sum is paid in, a short day will\r\nbe appointed (which, it is hoped, will be before Christmas) and notified\r\nin the _Gazette_, for the drawing thereof, which will be done in his\r\nmajesty’s presence, who is pleased to declare, that _he himself will see\r\nall the prizes put in amongst the blanks_, and that the whole will be\r\nmanaged with equity and fairness, nothing being intended but the sale of\r\nthe said jewels at a moderate value. And it is further notified, for the\r\nsatisfaction of all as shall be adventurers, that the said Mr. Child\r\nshall and will stand obliged to each of them for their several\r\nadventures. And that each adventurer shall receive their money back if\r\nthe said lottery be not drawn and finished before the first day of\r\nFebruary next.”--Mr. Child was the first regular banker: he began\r\nbusiness soon after the Restoration, and received the honour of\r\nknighthood. He lived in Fleet-street, where the shop still continues in\r\na state of the highest respectability. A subsequent notice says, “that\r\nthe king will probably, tomorrow, in the Banquetting-house, see all the\r\nblanks told over, that they may not exceed their number; and that the\r\npapers on which the prizes are to be written shall be rolled up in his\r\npresence; and that a child, appointed either by his majesty or the\r\nadventurers, shall draw the prizes.”--What would be said now, if his\r\npresent majesty were to be employed in sorting, folding, and counting\r\nthe blanks and prizes in the present lottery?\r\n\r\nAbout 1709, there was the _Greenwich Hospital Adventure_, sanctioned by\r\nan act of parliament, which the managers describe as “liable to none of\r\nthe objections made against other lotteries, _as to the fairness_ of the\r\ndrawing, it not being possible there should be any deceit in it, _as it\r\nhas been suspected in others_.”--Likewise there was Mr. Sydenham’s _Land\r\nLottery_, who declared it was “found very difficult and troublesome for\r\nthe adventurers for to search and find out what prizes they have come up\r\nin their number-tickets, _from the badness of the print_, the _many\r\nerrors in them_, and the _great quantity of prizes_.”--The\r\n_Twelve-penny_, or _Nonsuch_, and the _Fortunatus_ lotteries, also\r\nflourished at the commencement of the eighteenth century.[448]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY OF DEER.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1715, the proprietors of Sion gardens advertised the following\r\nsingular method of selling deer from their park. They appointed the\r\nafternoons of Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, for killing those\r\nanimals; when the public were admitted at one shilling each to see the\r\noperation, or they might purchase tickets from four to ten shillings,\r\nwhich entitled them, it is supposed, by way of _lottery_, to different\r\nparts of the beast,--as they say the quantity killed was to be divided\r\ninto sixteen lots, and the first choice to be governed by the numbers on\r\nthe tickets: a ten shilling ticket was entitled to a fillet; eight, a\r\nshoulder; seven, a loin, &c. If the full price of the deer was not\r\nreceived on a given day, the keeper held the money till that sum was\r\nobtained. They offered to sell whole deer, and to purchase as many as\r\nmight be offered.[449]\r\n\r\n\r\nHARBURGH LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nIn 1723, the resentment of the house of commons was directed against\r\nthe scheme of a lottery to be drawn at Harburgh, a town of Hanover on\r\nthe Elbe, opposite Hamburgh, in the king’s German dominions. A committee\r\ninquired into this and other lotteries at that time on foot in London.\r\nThe scheme pretended to raise a subscription for maintaining a trade\r\nbetween Great Britain and the king’s territories on the Elbe. It was a\r\nmysterious scene of iniquity, which the committee, with all their\r\npenetration, could not fully discover; but they reported, that it was an\r\ninfamous, fraudulent undertaking, whereby many unwary persons had been\r\ndrawn in, to their great loss: that the manner of carrying it on had\r\nbeen a manifest violation of the laws of the kingdom: that the managers\r\nand agents of this lottery had, without any authority, made use of his\r\nmajesty’s royal name to countenance the infamous project, and induce his\r\nmajesty’s subjects to engage or be concerned therein. A bill was brought\r\nin to suppress this lottery, and to oblige its managers to make\r\nrestitution of the money they had received from the contributors. At the\r\nsame time the house resolved, That John lord viscount Barrington had\r\nbeen notoriously guilty of promoting, abetting, and carrying on the\r\nfraudulent undertaking; for which offence he should be expelled the\r\nhouse.[450]\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK CLERKS’ FINESSE.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August, 1731, a scene was presented which strongly marks\r\nthe infatuation and ignorance of lottery adventurers. The tickets for\r\nthe State Lottery were delivered out to the subscribers at the Bank of\r\nEngland; when the crowd becoming so great as to obstruct the clerks,\r\nthey told them, “We deliver blanks to-day, but to-morrow we shall\r\ndeliver prizes;” upon which many, who were by no means for blanks,\r\nretired, and by this bold stratagem the clerks obtained room to proceed\r\nin their business. In this lottery “her majesty presented his royal\r\nhighness the duke with ten tickets.”[451]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE, DEATH, AND THE LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nEarly in the reign of George II., the footman of a lady of quality,\r\nunder the absurd infatuation of a dream, disposed of the savings of the\r\nlast twenty years of his life in two lottery tickets, which proving\r\nblanks, after a few melancholy days, he put an end to his life. In his\r\nbox was found the following plan of the manner in which he should spend\r\nthe five thousand pound prize, which his mistress preserved as a\r\ncuriosity:--\r\n\r\n“As soon as I have received the money, I will marry Grace Towers; but,\r\nas she has been cross and coy, I will use her as a servant. Every\r\nmorning she shall get me a mug of strong beer, with a toast, nutmeg, and\r\nsugar in it; then I will sleep till ten, after which I will have a large\r\nsack posset. My dinner shall be on table by one, and never without a\r\ngood pudding. I will have a stock of wine and brandy laid in. About five\r\nin the afternoon I will have tarts and jellies, and a gallon bowl of\r\npunch; at ten, a hot supper of two dishes. If I am in a good-humour, and\r\nGrace _behaves herself_, she shall sit down with me. To bed about\r\ntwelve.”[452]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELDING’S FARCE.\r\n\r\nIn 1731, Henry Fielding wrote a farce for Drury-lane Theatre, called\r\n“The Lottery,” to which, in 1732, he added a new scene. This pleasant\r\nrepresentation of characters usually influenced to speculate in such\r\nschemes, was acted with considerable success, especially about the time\r\nwhen the lottery was drawn at Guildhall, and may well be conceived as\r\ncalculated to abate the popular furor. It opens with a lottery-office\r\nkeeper--\r\n\r\n_Mr._ Stocks, _alone_.\r\n\r\nAIR.\r\n\r\n    A Lottery is a Taxation,\r\n    Upon all the Fools in Creation;\r\n        And, Heaven be prais’d,\r\n        It is easily rais’d,\r\n    Credulity’s always in Fashion:\r\n        For Folly’s a Fund\r\n        Will never lose Ground,\r\n    While Fools are so rife in the Nation.\r\n\r\n    [_Knocking without._\r\n\r\n  _Enter_ 1 Buyer.\r\n\r\n  _1 Buy._ Is not this a House where People buy _Lottery Tickets_?\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ Yes, Sir--I believe I can furnish you with as good Tickets as\r\n  any one.\r\n\r\n  _1 Buy._ I suppose, Sir, ’tis all one to you what Number a Man fixes\r\n  on.\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ Any of my Numbers.\r\n\r\n  _1 Buy._ Because I would be glad to have it, Sir, the Number of my own\r\n  Years, or my Wife’s; or, if I cou’d not have either of those, I wou’d\r\n  be glad to have it the Number of my Mother’s.\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ Ay, or suppose, now, it was the Number of your Grandmother’s?\r\n\r\n  _1 Buy._ No, no! She has no Luck in Lotteries: She had a whole Ticket\r\n  once, and got but fifty Pounds by it.\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ A very unfortunate Person, truly. Sir, my Clerk will furnish\r\n  you, if you’ll walk that way up to the office.

But if I mistake not, Madam, you wou’d be\r\n  instructed how to dispose of 10,000_l._\r\n\r\n  _Chloe._ I wou’d so, Sir.\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ Why, Madam, you know, at present, Publick Interest is very\r\n  low, and private Securities very difficult to get--and I am sorry to\r\n  say, I am afraid there are some in the Alley who are not the honestest\r\n  Men in the Kingdom. In short, there is one way to dispose of Money\r\n  with Safety and Advantage, and that is--to put it into the _Charitable\r\n  Corporation_.\r\n\r\n  _Chloe._ The _Charitable Corporation_! pray what is that?\r\n\r\n  _Stoc._ That is, Madam, a method, invented by some very wise Men, by\r\n  which the Rich may be charitable to the Poor, and be Money in Pocket\r\n  by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARITABLE CORPORATION.\r\n\r\nThis company, erected in 1707, professed to lend money at legal interest\r\nto the poor upon small pledges; and to persons of better rank upon\r\nsecurity of goods impawned. Their capital, at first limited to £30,000,\r\nwas by licenses from the crown increased to £600,000, though their\r\ncharter was never confirmed by act of parliament. In 1731, George\r\nRobinson, esquire, member for Marlow, the cashier, and John Thompson,\r\nwarehouse-keeper of the corporation, disappeared in one day. The alarmed\r\nproprietors held several general courts, and appointed a committee to\r\ninspect their affairs, who reported, that for a capital of above\r\n£500,000 no equivalent was found; inasmuch as their effects did not\r\namount to the value of £30,000, the remainder having been embezzled. The\r\nproprietors, in a petition to the house of commons, represented that, by\r\na notorious breach of trust, the corporation had been defrauded of the\r\ngreatest part of their capital; and that many of the petitioners were\r\nreduced to the utmost misery and distress: they therefore prayed\r\nparliament to inquire into the state of the corporation, and the conduct\r\nof their managers, and extend relief to the petitioners. On this\r\npetition a secret committee was appointed, who soon discovered a most\r\niniquitous scene of fraud, perpetrated by Robinson and Thompson, in\r\nconcert with some of the directors, for embezzling the capital, and\r\ncheating the proprietors. Many persons of rank and quality were\r\nconcerned in this infamous conspiracy. Sir Robert Sutton and sir\r\nArchibald Grant were expelled the house of commons, as having had a\r\nconsiderable share in those fraudulent practices, and a bill was brought\r\nin to restrain them and other delinquents from leaving the kingdom, or\r\nalienating their effects.[453] In 1733, parliament granted a lottery in\r\nbehalf of the sufferers. On the 1st of August in that year, books were\r\nopened at the bank to receive, from those who had given in their names,\r\nthe first payment of one pound per ticket in the “Lottery for the relief\r\nof the Charitable Corporation;”[454] and in 1734 “it was distributed\r\namong them, amounting to nine shillings and ninepence in the pound on\r\ntheir loss.”[455]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “London Journal” of October 30, 1731, observing on the general\r\ndisposition to adventure says:--\r\n\r\nThe _natural life_ of man is _labour or business_; riches is an\r\n_unnatural_ state; and therefore generally a _state of misery_. Life,\r\nwhich is a drug in the hands of _idle men_, never hangs heavily on the\r\nhands of merchants and tradesmen, who judiciously divide their time\r\nbetween the city and country.\r\n\r\nThis is so true, that a wise man would never leave his children so much\r\nmoney as to put them _beyond industry_; for that is too often putting\r\nthem _beyond happiness_. The _heaping up riches_ for posterity is,\r\ngenerally speaking, _heaping up destruction_; and entailing of _large\r\nestates_, entailing _vice and misery_.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were occasioned by the present _state lottery_; which\r\nplainly discovers that the people would run into the excesses of the\r\n_South Sea_ year, had they the same opportunities. The spring and source\r\nof this _unreasonable passion_, is the _luxury of the age_. _Tradesmen_\r\ncommence gentlemen and _men of pleasure_, when they should be _men of\r\nbusiness_; and _begin_ where they should _end_. This sets them a madding\r\nafter _lotteries_; business is neglected, and poverty, vice, and misery\r\nspread among the people. It is hoped that the _Parliament_ will never\r\ncome into another _lottery_. All other gaming should be also\r\ndiscouraged. Who but laments that unfortunate young lady at the _Bath_,\r\nwho was ruined by gaming, and rather than submit to a _mean dependance_,\r\nthought it best to resign her life?[456]\r\n\r\nThe tone of dissuasion from lotteries and gambling in the year 1731,\r\nprevails through the writings of the different persons who opposed such\r\nschemes and practices. The story of the “unfortunate young lady at the\r\nBath, who was ruined by gaming,” referred to in the last paragraph, and\r\nalready related in this work, is exceedingly affecting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTMINSTER BRIDGE LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nIn the 9th year of George II. parliament passed an act for building this\r\nbridge by a lottery, and the following scheme was issued to the\r\npublic:--\r\n\r\n  LOTTERY 1736, _for raising 100000l. for building a Bridge at_\r\n  Westminster, _consisting of 125000 Tickets, at 5l. each_.\r\n\r\n  Prizes   1 -- of -- 20000_l._ -- is --  20000_l._\r\n           2 -------- 10000     --------  20000\r\n           3 --------  5000     --------  15000\r\n          10 --------  3000     --------  30000\r\n          40 --------  1000     --------  40000\r\n          60 --------   500     --------  30000\r\n         100 --------   200     --------  20000\r\n         200 --------   100     --------  20000\r\n         400 --------    50     --------  20000\r\n        1000 --------    20     --------  20000\r\n       28800 --------    10     -------- 288000\r\n       -----                             ------\r\n       30616 Prizes, amounting to -- --  523000\r\n       94384 Blanks.\r\n               First Drawn -- -- -- --     1000\r\n               Last Drawn  -- -- -- --     1000\r\n      ------                             ------\r\n      125000                             525000\r\n      ------                             ------\r\n\r\n  The Prizes to be paid at the Bank in 40 Days after Drawing, without\r\n  Deduction. _N.B._ _There is little more than Three_ Blanks _to a_\r\n  Prize.[457]\r\n\r\nParliament granted successive lotteries for the building and completion\r\nof Westminster-bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ORGAN LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nIn 1737, Horace Walpole (Lord Orford) says, “I am now in pursuit of\r\ngetting the finest piece of music that ever was heard; it is a thing\r\nthat will play eight tunes. Handel and all the great musicians say, that\r\nit is beyond any thing they can do; and this may be performed by the\r\nmost ignorant person; and when you are weary of those eight tunes, you\r\nmay have them changed for any other that you like. This I think much\r\nbetter than going to an Italian opera, or an assembly. This performance\r\nhas been lately put into a _Lottery_, and all the royal family chose to\r\nhave a great many tickets, rather than to buy it, the price being I\r\nthink 1000_l._, infinitely a less sum than some bishopricks have been\r\nsold for. And a gentleman won it, who I am in hopes will sell it, and if\r\nhe will, I will buy it, for I cannot live to have another made, and I\r\nwill carry it into the country with me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the State Lottery of 1739, tickets, chances, and shares were “bought\r\nand sold by Richard Shergold, printer to the honourable the\r\ncommissioners of the Lottery, at his office at the Union Coffee-house\r\nover and against the Royal Exchange, Cornhill.” He advertised, that he\r\nkept numerical books during the drawing, and a book wherein buyers might\r\nregister their numbers at sixpence each; that 15 _per cent. was to be\r\ndeducted_ out of the prizes, which were to be paid at the bank in fifty\r\ndays after the drawing was finished; and that “schemes in French and\r\nEnglish” were given gratis.[458]\r\n\r\nThe per centage to be deducted from the prizes in this lottery\r\noccasioned the following\r\n\r\nEPIGRAM.\r\n\r\n    This lottery can never thrive,\r\n      Was broker heard to say,\r\n    For who but fools will ever give\r\n      _Fifteen per cent_ to play.\r\n\r\n    A sage, with his accustomed grin,\r\n      Replies, I’ll stake my doom,\r\n    That if but half the fools come in\r\n      The wise will find no room.[459]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY AT STATIONERS’ HALL.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of November, 1741, “the drawing of the Bridge Lottery began\r\nat _Stationers’ Hall_.--_The Craftsman_ of the 28th says, that every\r\n100,000_l._ laid out in a lottery puts a stop to the circulation of at\r\nleast 300,000_l._, and occasions almost a total suppression of\r\ntrade.”[460]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn June, 1743, “the price of lottery tickets having risen from 10_l._ to\r\n11_l._ 10_s._ some persons, who probably wanted to purchase, published a\r\nhint to the _unwary_ adventurers, that they gamed at 50 _per cent._\r\nloss; paying, at that price, 2_s._ 6_d._ to play for 5_s._; the money\r\nplayed for being only three pound, besides discount and\r\ndeductions.”[461]\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKET STUCK IN THE WHEEL.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1774, at the conclusion of drawing the State\r\nLottery at Guildhall, No. 11,053, as the last drawn ticket, was declared\r\nto be entitled to the 1000_l._, and was so printed in the paper of\r\nbenefits by order of the commissioners. It was besides a prize of\r\n100_l._ But after the wheels were carried back to Whitehall and there\r\nopened, the ticket No. 72,248 was found _sticking in a crevice_ of the\r\nwheel. And, being the next drawn ticket after all the prizes were drawn,\r\nwas advertised by the commissioners’ order as entitled to the 1000_l._,\r\nas the _last drawn_ ticket: “which affair made a great deal of\r\nnoise.”[462]\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEER’S SUBSTITUTE FOR LOTTERIES.\r\n\r\nOn the bill, for a lottery to succeed the preceding, being brought into\r\nthe house of lords, a peer said, that such measures always were censured\r\nby those that saw their nature and their tendency. “They have been\r\nconsidered as legal cheats, by which the ignorant and the rash are\r\ndefrauded, and the subtle and avaricious often enriched. They have been\r\nallowed to divert the people from trade, and to alienate them from\r\nuseful industry. A man who is uneasy in his circumstances, and idle in\r\nhis disposition, collects the remains of his fortune, and buys tickets\r\nin a lottery, retires from business, indulges himself in laziness, and\r\nwaits, in some obscure place, the event of his adventure. Another,\r\ninstead of employing his stock in a shop or a warehouse, rents a garret\r\nin a private street, and make it his business, by false intelligence,\r\nand chimerical alarms, to raise and sink the price of tickets\r\nalternately, and takes advantage of the lies which he has himself\r\ninvented. If I, my lords, might presume to recommend to our ministers\r\nthe most probable method of raising a large sum for the payment of the\r\ntroops of the electorate, I should, instead of the tax and lottery now\r\nproposed, advise them to establish a certain number of licensed\r\nwheel-barrows, on which the laudable trade of thimble and button might\r\nbe carried on for the support of the war, and shoe-boys might contribute\r\nto the defence of the house of _Austria_, by raffling for apples.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANCES OF TICKETS.\r\n\r\nThe State Lottery of 1751 seems to have encountered considerable\r\nopposition. There is a discouraging notice in the “Gentleman’s Magazine”\r\non the 4th of July in that year, that “those inclined to become\r\nadventurers in the present lottery were cautioned in the papers to wait\r\nsome time before they purchased tickets, whereby the jobbers would be\r\ndisappointed of their market, and obliged to sell at a lower price. At\r\nthe present rate of tickets the adventurer plays at 35 per cent. loss.”\r\n\r\nIn the next month, August, the “London Magazine” exhibited the following\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nIN THE LOTTERY 1751, IT IS\r\n\r\n  69998 to     2 or 34999 to 1 against a £10000 prize.\r\n  69994 to     6 or 11665 to 1 against a   5000 or upwards.\r\n  69989 to    11 or  6363 to 1 against a   3000\r\n  69981 to    19 or  3683 to 1 against a   2000\r\n  69961 to    39 or  1794 to 1 against a   1000\r\n  69920 to    80 or   874 to 1 against a    500\r\n  69720 to   280 or   249 to 1 against a    100\r\n  69300 to   700 or    99 to 1 against a     50\r\n  60000 to 10000 or     6 to 1 against a     20 or any prize.\r\n\r\nThe writer says, I would beg the favour of all gentlemen, tradesmen, and\r\nothers, to take the pains to explain to such as any way depend upon\r\ntheir judgment, that one must buy no less than seven tickets to have an\r\neven chance for any prize at all; that with only one ticket, it is six\r\nto one, and with half a ticket, twelve to one against any prize; and\r\nninety-nine or a hundred to one that the prize, if it comes, will not be\r\nabove fifty pounds; and no less than thirty-five thousand to one that\r\nthe owner of a single ticket will not obtain one of the greatest prizes.\r\nNo lottery is proper for persons of very small fortunes, to whom the\r\nloss of five or six pounds is of great consequence, besides the\r\ndisturbance of their minds; much less is it advisable or desirable for\r\neither poor or rich to contribute to the exorbitant tax of more than two\r\nhundred thousand pounds, which the first engrossers of lottery tickets,\r\nand the brokers and dealers strive to raise, out of the pockets of the\r\npoor chiefly, and the silly rich partly, by artfully enhancing the price\r\nof tickets above the original cost.\r\n\r\nThe prices of tickets in this lottery was ten pounds. On their rise a\r\nMr. Holland publicly offered to lay four hundred guineas, that four\r\nhundred tickets, when drawn, did not amount to nine pounds fifteen\r\nshillings on an average, prizes and blanks; his advertisement was never\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThese animadversions on the scheme, and the resistance offered to the\r\nendeavours of the brokers and dealers to effect a rise in the price of\r\ntickets, appear, from the following lines published in October, to have\r\nbeen to a certain degree successful--\r\n\r\nA NEW SONG\r\n\r\n_From ‘Change-alley, occasioned by a stagnation of the sale of Lottery\r\nTickets._\r\n\r\n    While guineas were plenty, we thought we might rise,\r\n    Nor dreamt of a magpye to pick out our eyes;\r\n    ’Twas twelve would have satisfy’d all our desire,\r\n    Tho’ perhaps without pain we might see them mount higher.\r\n                            Derry down, down, down derry, &c.\r\n\r\n    How sweet were the pickings we formerly gain’d,\r\n    From whence our fine daughters their fortunes obtain’d!\r\n    In our coaches can roll, at the public can smile,\r\n    Whose follies reward all our labour and toil.\r\n                                              Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    Then let them spin out their fine scheme as they will,\r\n    No horseshoe nor magpye shall baffle our skill;\r\n    In triumph we’ll ride, and, in spite of the rout,\r\n    Our point we’ll obtain without wheeling about.\r\n                                              Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    Tho’ sturdy these beggars, yet weak are their brains;\r\n    Who offer to check us, must smart for their pains;\r\n    In concert united, we’ll laugh at the tribe,\r\n    Who play off their engines to damp all our pride.\r\n                                              Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    Let Holland no longer appear with his brags,\r\n    His four hundred guineas keep safe in his bags,\r\n    Nor think we’re such fools to risque any thing down,\r\n    By way of a wager to humour the town.\r\n                                         Derry down, &c.[463]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of the next month, November, the drawing of the State\r\nLottery began, when, notwithstanding the united efforts of several\r\nsocieties and public-spirited gentlemen to check the exorbitancy of the\r\nticket-mongers, the price rose to sixteen guineas just before drawing.\r\nAll means were tried to cure this infatuation by writing and\r\nadvertising; particularly on the first day of drawing, it was publicly\r\naverred, that near eight thousand tickets were in the South Sea House,\r\nand upwards of thirty thousand pawned at bankers, &c. that nine out of\r\nten of the ticket-holders were not able to go into the wheel; and that\r\nnot one of them durst stand the drawing above six days. It was also\r\ndemonstrated in the clearest manner, that to have an even chance for any\r\nprize a person must have seven tickets; that with only one ticket it was\r\nsix to one; and ninety-nine to one that the prize, if it came, would not\r\nbe above fifty pounds, and no less than thirty-five thousand to one that\r\nthe owner of a single ticket would not obtain one of the greatest\r\nprizes.--Yet, notwithstanding these and other precautions, people still\r\nsuffered themselves to be deluded, and the monied men arrogantly\r\ntriumphed.[464]\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOTTERY JOB IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1752, a lottery was set on foot at Dublin, under the pretext\r\nof raising 13,700_l._ for rebuilding Essex-bridge, and other public and\r\ncharitable uses. There were to be 100,000 tickets, at a guinea each.\r\nThe lords justices of Ireland issued an order to suppress this lottery.\r\nThe measure occasioned a great uproar in Dublin; for it appears, that\r\nthe tickets bore a premium, and that though the original subscribers\r\nwere to have their money returned, the buyers at the advanced price\r\nwould lose the advance. Every purchaser of a single ticket in this\r\nillegal lottery incurred a penalty of 50_l._ for each offence, and the\r\nseller 500_l._, one third of which went to the informer, a third to the\r\nking, and the other third to the poor of the parish; besides which, the\r\noffenders were subject to a year’s close imprisonment in the county\r\ngaol.[465]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEHEUP’S FRAUD.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the monopoly of tickets in the State Lottery, it had been\r\nenacted, that persons charged with the delivery of tickets should not\r\nsell more than twenty to one person. This provision was evaded by\r\npretended lists, which defeated the object of parliament and injured\r\npublic credit, insomuch that, in 1754, more tickets were subscribed for\r\nthan the holders of the lists had cash to purchase, and there was a\r\ndeficiency in the first payment. The mischief and notoriety of these\r\npractices occasioned the house of commons to prosecute an inquiry into\r\nthe circumstances, which, though opposed by a scandalous cabal, who\r\nendeavoured to screen the delinquents, ended in a report by the\r\ncommittee, that Peter Leheup, esq. had privately disposed of a great\r\nnumber of tickets before the office was opened to which the public were\r\ndirected by an advertisement to apply; that he also delivered great\r\nnumbers to particular persons, upon lists of names which he knew to be\r\nfictitious; and that, in particular, Sampson Gideon became proprietor of\r\nmore than six thousand, which he sold at a premium. Upon report of these\r\nand other illegal acts, the house resolved that Leheup was guilty of a\r\nviolation of the act, and a breach of trust, and presented an address to\r\nhis majesty, praying that he would direct the attorney-general to\r\nprosecute him in the most effectual manner for his offences.\r\n\r\nAn information was accordingly filed, and, on a trial at bar in the\r\ncourt of king’s bench, Leheup, as one of the receivers of the last\r\nlottery of 300,000_l._, was found guilty: 1. Of receiving subscriptions\r\nbefore the day and hour advertised; 2. Of permitting the subscribers to\r\nuse different names to cover an excess of twenty tickets; and 3. Of\r\ndisposing of the tickets which had been bespoke and not claimed, or were\r\ndouble charged, instead of returning them to the managers. In Trinity\r\nterm, Leheup was brought up for judgment, and fined 1000_l._, which he\r\npaid in court. As he had amassed forty times that sum by his frauds, the\r\nlenity of the sentence was the subject of severe remark.[466]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY INSANITY.\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1757, Mr. Keys, late clerk to Cotton and Co., who had\r\nabsented himself ever since the 7th of October, the day the 10,000_l._\r\nwas drawn in the lottery, (supposed to be his property,) was found in\r\nthe streets raving mad, having been robbed of his pocket-book and\r\nticket.[467]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subjoined verses appeared in 1761:[468]--\r\n\r\n_A few Thoughts on Lotteries._\r\n\r\n    A Lottery, like a magic spell,\r\n      All ranks of men bewitches,\r\n    Whose beating bosoms vainly swell\r\n      With hopes of sudden riches:\r\n\r\n    With hope to gain TEN THOUSAND POUND\r\n      How many post to ruin,\r\n    And for an empty, airy sound\r\n      Contrive their own undoing!\r\n\r\n    Those on whom wealth her stores had shed,\r\n      May firmly bear their crosses;\r\n    But they who earn their daily bread,\r\n      Oft sink beneath their losses.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis strange, so many fools we find,\r\n      By tickets thus deluded,\r\n    And, by a trifling turn of mind,\r\n      From life’s blest bliss excluded.\r\n\r\n    For life’s best blessing, calm content,\r\n      Attends no more his slumbers,\r\n    Who dreams of profit, cent. per cent.\r\n      And sets his heart on numbers.\r\n\r\n    Thro’ all life’s various stages, care\r\n      Our peace will oft disquiet;\r\n    Like a free-gift it comes, we ne’er\r\n      Need be in haste to buy it.\r\n\r\n    He who, intent on shadowy schemes,\r\n      By them is deeply bubbled,\r\n    Deserves to wake from golden dreams,\r\n      With disappointment doubled.\r\n\r\n    Unmoved by Fortune’s fickle wheel,\r\n      The wise man chance despises;\r\n    And Prudence courts with fervent zeal--\r\n      She gives the highest prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE DIVISION OF TICKETS.\r\n\r\nIn some of the old lotteries tickets were divided into a much greater\r\nnumber of shares than of late years. There is an example of this in the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n_Advertisement, November, 1766._\r\n\r\nDAME FORTUNE presents her respects to the public, and assures them that\r\nshe has fixed her residence for the present at CORBETT’S, State\r\nLottery-office, opposite St. Dunstan’s-church, Fleet-street; and, to\r\nenable many families to partake of her favours, she has ordered not only\r\nthe tickets to be sold at the lowest prices, but also that they be\r\n_divided into shares at the following low rates_, viz:--\r\n\r\n                     £ _s._ _d._\r\n  A sixty-fourth     0   4   0\r\n  Thirty-second      0   7   6\r\n  Sixteenth          0  15   0\r\n  An eighth          1  10   0\r\n  A Fourth           3   0   0\r\n  A half             6   0   0\r\n\r\nBy which may be gained from upwards of one hundred and fifty to upwards\r\nof five thousand guineas, at her said office No. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NUMBER TWICE SOLD.\r\n\r\nThe lottery of 1766 was unfortunate to a lottery-office keeper. The\r\nticket No. 20,99 was purchased in the alley for Pagen Hale, esq. of\r\nHertfordshire; and the same number was also divided into shares at a\r\nlottery-office near Charing-cross, and some of the shares actually sold.\r\nThe number purchased in the alley was the real number, but that divided\r\nby the office-keeper was done by mistake, for which he paid a\r\nproportionable sum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the lottery of 1767, the stockbrokers fell among thieves. Mr.\r\nHugnes, a stock-broker, had his pocket picked in Jonathan’s coffee-house\r\nof fifty lottery tickets, the value of which (at the price then sold)\r\nwas 800_l._ The same evening three other brokers had their pockets\r\npicked of their purses, one containing sixty-two guineas, another seven,\r\nand the third five. One of the pick-pockets was afterwards apprehended,\r\non whom thirty-five of the tickets were found, and recovered; the other\r\nfifteen he said were carried to Holland by his accomplices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding anecdotes are in the newspapers of the time, together with\r\nthe following, which strongly marks the perversion of a weak mind. “A\r\ngentlewoman in Holborn, whose husband had presented her with a ticket,\r\nput up prayers in the church, the day before drawing, in the following\r\nmanner: _The prayers of the congregation are desired for the success of\r\na person engaged in a new undertaking_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRAUDULENT INSURER.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1768, an insurer of tickets was summoned before a\r\nmagistrate, for refusing to pay thirty guineas to an adventurer, upon\r\nthe coming up of a certain number a blank, for which he had paid a\r\npremium of three guineas. The insurer was ordered immediately to pay\r\nthirty guineas, which he was obliged to comply with to prevent worse\r\nconsequences.[469] In other words, the magistrate was too weak to exert\r\nthe power he was armed with, by law, against both the insurer and the\r\ninsured.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE TICKETS.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Holland, the actor, who died on the 7th of December, 1769,\r\nreceived many letters of passionate admiration from a lady who fell in\r\nlove with him from his appearance on the stage; and she accompanied one\r\nof her declarations of attachment by four lottery tickets as a\r\npresent.[470]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD AND ILL LUCK.\r\n\r\nIn the lottery of 1770, the holder of the ticket entitled to the capital\r\nprize or 20,000_l._ was captain Towry of Isleworth. A very remarkable\r\ncircumstance put it in his possession: Mr. Barnes, a grocer in\r\nCheapside, purchased four following numbers, one of which this was; but\r\nthinking the chance not so great in so many following ones, he carried\r\nthis very ticket back to the office, and changed it for another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE GO.\r\n\r\nOctober 14, 1770, a case was determined at the general quarter session\r\nof the peace for the county of Wilts, held at Marlborough. A quack\r\ndoctor had been convicted before Thomas Johnson, esq. of Bradford, in\r\nthe penalty of 200_l._ for disposing of plate, &c. by means of a device\r\nor lottery; and by a second information convicted of the same offence\r\nbefore Joseph Mortimer, esq. of Trowbridge. To both these convictions he\r\nappealed to the justices at the general quarter session of the peace,\r\nwhen, after a trial of near ten hours, the bench unanimously confirmed\r\nthe conviction on both informations, by which the appellant was\r\nsubjected to the penalties of 200_l._ on each, and costs.[471]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1773, a cause of great public concern came on to be\r\ntried before lord Mansfield, at Guildhall, wherein the lord mayor was\r\nplaintiff, and Messrs. Barnes and Golightly were defendants, in order to\r\ndetermine the legality of insuring lottery tickets; but on account of an\r\nerror in the declaration the plaintiff was nonsuited.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of the same month, “Mr. Sheriff Lewes presented a petition\r\nfrom the city of London, against the frequent toleration of lotteries in\r\nthe time of peace; but the petition was ordered to lie upon the\r\ntable.--No government can long subsist, that is reduced to the necessity\r\nof supporting itself by fraudulent gaming.”[472]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICKS OF AN INSURER.\r\n\r\nJune 26, 1775, a cause came on in the court of common pleas, Guildhall,\r\nbetween a gentleman, plaintiff, and a lottery-office keeper of this\r\ncity, defendant; the cause of this action was as follows: the gentleman,\r\npassing by the lottery-office, observed a woman and boy crying, on which\r\nhe asked the reason of their tears; they informed him, that they had\r\ninsured a number in the lottery on the over night, and, upon inquiry at\r\nanother office, found it to have been drawn five days before, and\r\ntherefore wanted their money returned; the gentleman, taking their part,\r\nwas assaulted and beat by the office-keeper, for which the jury gave a\r\nverdict in favour of the gentleman with five pounds damages.[473]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS RESPECTING A BLUE-COAT BOY.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, some of the boys of Christ’s Hospital, appointed to draw\r\nnumbers and chances from the wheel, were tampered with, for the purpose\r\nof inducing them to commit a fraud. These attempts were successful in\r\none instance, and led to certain regulations, which will presently be\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June, a man was carried before the lord mayor for\r\nattempting to bribe the two blue-coat boys who drew the Museum Lottery\r\nat Guildhall to conceal a ticket, and to bring it to him, promising that\r\nhe would next day return it to them. His intention was to insure it in\r\nall the offices, with a view to defraud the office-keepers. The boys\r\nwere honest, gave notice of the intended fraud, and pointed out the\r\ndelinquent, who, however, was discharged, as there existed no law to\r\npunish the offence.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of December, one of the blue-coat boys who drew the numbers\r\nin the State Lottery at Guildhall was examined before sir Charles\r\nAsgill, relative to a number that had been drawn out the Friday before,\r\non which an insurance had been made in almost every office in London.\r\nThe boy confessed, that he was prevailed upon to conceal the ticket No.\r\n21,481, by a man who gave him money for so doing; that the man copied\r\nthe number; and that the next day he followed the man’s instructions,\r\nand put his hand into the wheel as usual, with the ticket in it, and\r\nthen pretended to draw it out. The instigator of the offence had\r\nactually received 400_l._ of the insurance-office keepers; had all of\r\nthem paid him, the whole sum would have amounted to 3000_l._ but some of\r\nthem suspected a fraud had been committed, and caused the inquiry, which\r\nobtained the boy’s confession.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the person who insured the ticket was examined. He\r\nwas clerk to a hop-factor in Goodman’s-fields, but not being the person\r\nwho seduced the boy to secrete the ticket, and no evidence appearing to\r\nprove his connection with the person who did, the prisoner was\r\ndischarged, though it was ascertained that he had insured the number\r\nalready mentioned ninety-one times in one day.[474]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the circumstances discovered by this examination, the\r\nlords of the treasury inquired further, and deliberated on the means of\r\npreventing similar practices; the result of their conferences was the\r\nfollowing “Orders,” which are extracted from the original minutes of the\r\nproceedings, and are now for the first time published.\r\n\r\nCOPY, No. I.\r\n\r\nORDER _of December 12, 1775_.\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY having been made, that WILLIAM TRAMPLET, one of the boys\r\nemployed in drawing the lottery, had, at the instigation of one CHARLES\r\nLOWNDES, (since absconded,) at different times, in former rolls _taken\r\nout of the number wheel_ THREE _numbered tickets, which were at_ THREE\r\n_several times returned by him into the said wheel, and drawn without\r\nhis parting with them_, so as to give them the appearance of being\r\nfairly drawn, _to answer the purpose of defrauding by insurance_:\r\n\r\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, for preventing the like wicked practices in\r\nfuture, that every boy before he is suffered to put his hand into either\r\nwheel, be brought by the proclaimer to the managers on duty, for them to\r\nsee that _the bosoms and sleeves of his coat be closely buttoned_, _his\r\npockets sewed up_, _and his hands examined_; and that during the time of\r\nhis being on duty, _he shall keep his left hand in his girdle behind\r\nhim, and his right hand open, with his fingers extended_; and the\r\nproclaimer is not to suffer him at any time to leave the wheel without\r\nbeing first examined by the manager nearest him.\r\n\r\nThe observance of the foregoing order is recommended by the managers on\r\nthis roll to those on the succeeding rolls, till the matter shall be\r\nmore fully discussed at a general meeting.\r\n\r\nCOPY, No. II.\r\n\r\nORDER _at_ GENERAL MEETING.\r\n\r\n  A PLAN OF RULES AND REGULATIONS to be observed, in order _to prevent\r\n  the boys committing frauds_, &c., in the drawing of the lottery,\r\n  agreeable to _directions_ received by Mr. JOHNSON, on Tuesday the 16th\r\n  of January, 1776, from the LORDS OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nTHAT ten managers be always on the roll at Guildhall, two of whom are to\r\nbe conveniently placed opposite the two boys at the wheels, in order to\r\nobserve that they strictly conform themselves to the rules and orders\r\ndirected by the committee at Guildhall, on Tuesday, December 12, 1775.\r\n\r\n_THAT it be requested of the TREASURER OF CHRIST’S HOSPITAL not to make\r\nknown who are the twelve boys nominated for drawing the lottery till the\r\nmorning the drawing begins; which said boys are all to attend every day,\r\nand the two who are to go on duty at the wheels are to be taken\r\npromiscuously from amongst the whole number_ by either of the\r\nsecretaries, _without observing any regular course or order; so that no\r\nboy shall know when it will be his turn to go to either wheel_.\r\n\r\nTHIS METHOD, though attended with considerable additional expense, by\r\nthe extra attendance of two managers and six boys, will, it is presumed,\r\neffectually prevent any attempt being made to corrupt or bribe any of\r\nthe boys to commit the fraud practised in the last lottery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is imagined, that to future inquirers concerning lotteries, with a\r\nview to its history, the publication of the preceding documents may be\r\nacceptable. So long a time has elapsed since the fraud they relate to\r\nwas perpetrated, that any motive which existed for keeping them private\r\nhas ceased. The blue-coat boy who secretly abstracted the tickets from\r\nthe wheel, and afterwards appeared to draw them fairly and openly, will\r\nbe regarded as having been pitiably exposed to seductions, which might\r\nhave been prevented if these regulations had been adopted on the\r\ncomplaint of the lad who was tampered with in June. Perhaps it was\r\nprudent, though not “quite correct,” to conceal that _three_ tickets had\r\nbeen improperly taken from the wheel: until now, it has not been\r\npublicly made known that there was more than _one_; and though, if the\r\npoint had been tried, that _one_ might have been sufficient to have\r\nvitiated the legality of the drawing of the lottery of 1775 altogether,\r\nit was not enough, in a popular view, to raise a hue-and-cry among the\r\nunfortunate holders against the disturbance of their chances. The\r\nconcealment of _three_ might have congregated the unsuccessful\r\nadventurers of the three kingdoms into an uproar, “one and indivisible,”\r\nwhich, with the law on their side, would have exceedingly puzzled the\r\nthen lords of the treasury to subdue, without ordering the lottery to\r\nhave been drawn over again, and raising a fresh clamour among the\r\nholders of tickets that had been declared prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY SUICIDE.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of January, 1777, “a young man, clerk to a merchant in the\r\ncity, was found in the river below bridge drowned: he had been dabbling\r\nin the lottery with his master’s money, and chose this way of settling\r\nhis accounts.”[475]\r\n\r\n\r\nA BLANK MADE A PRIZE.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1777, Joseph Arones and Samuel Noah, two jews, were examined\r\nat Guildhall before the lord mayor, charged with counterfeiting the\r\nlottery ticket No. 25,590, a prize of 2000_l._, with intent to defraud\r\nMr. Keyser, an office-keeper, knowing the same to have been false and\r\ncounterfeit. Mr. Keyser had examined the ticket carefully, and had taken\r\nit into the Stock-exchange to sell, when Mr. Shewell came into the same\r\nbox, and desired to look at the ticket, having, as he recollected,\r\npurchased one of the same number a day or two before. This fortunate\r\ndiscovery laid open the fraud, and the two jews were committed to take\r\ntheir trial for their ingenuity. It was so artfully altered from 23,590,\r\nthat not the least erasure could be discerned. Arones was but just come\r\nto England, and Noah was thought to be a man of property.\r\n\r\nIn February following, Arones and Noah were tried at the Old Bailey for\r\nthe forgery and fraud. Their defence was, that the prisoner Arones found\r\nit, and persons were brought to swear it; on which they were acquitted.\r\nThe figure altered was so totally obliterated by a certain liquid, that\r\nnot the least trace of it could be perceived.\r\n\r\nAt the same sessions, Daniel Denny was tried for forging,\r\ncounterfeiting, and altering a lottery ticket, with intent to defraud;\r\nand, being found guilty, was condemned.[476]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURING.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1778, came on to be tried at Guildhall, before lord Mansfield,\r\na cause, wherein a merchant was plaintiff and a lottery-office keeper\r\ndefendant. The action was brought for suffering a young man, the\r\nplaintiff’s apprentice, to insure with the defendant during the drawing\r\nof the last lottery, contrary to the statute; whereby the youth lost a\r\nconsiderable sum, the property of the merchant. The jury without\r\ngoing out of court gave a verdict for the plaintiff, thereby\r\nsubjecting the defendant to pay 500_l._ penalty, and to three months’\r\nimprisonment.[477]\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, parliament having discussed the evil of insuring,\r\nand the mischievous subdivision of the shares of tickets, passed an act\r\n“for the regulation of Lottery offices,” in which the principal clauses\r\nwere as follows--\r\n\r\n“To oblige every lottery-office keeper to take out a licence, at the\r\nexpense of 50_l._, and give security not to infringe any part of the\r\nact.\r\n\r\n“That no person shall dispose of any part of a ticket in any smaller\r\nshare or proportion than a sixteenth, on 50_l._ penalty.\r\n\r\n“That any person selling goods, wares, or other merchandise, or who\r\nshall offer any sum or sums of money, upon any chance or event\r\nwhatsoever, relating to the drawing of any ticket, shall be liable to a\r\npenalty of 20_l._\r\n\r\n“To enable the commissioners of his majesty’s treasury to establish an\r\noffice;--all shares to be stamped at that office;--the original tickets\r\nfrom which such shares are to be taken, to be kept at that office till a\r\ncertain time after drawing;--books of entry to be regularly\r\nkept;--persons carrying shares to be stamped to pay a small sum\r\nspecified in the act;--penalties for persons selling shares not stamped;\r\nand a clause for punishing persons who shall forge the stamp of any\r\nticket.”\r\n\r\nIn 1779, the drawing of the lottery and the conduct of lottery-office\r\nkeepers was further regulated by act of parliament.[478]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVASIONS OF THE INSURERS.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of parliament against the ruinous practice of insurance\r\nwere evaded by the dexterity of the lottery-office keepers. In 1781, the\r\nfollowing proposals were issued by the cunning, and greedily accepted\r\nby the credulous.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n  _November 7, 1781_\r\n\r\n  MODE OF INSURANCE,\r\n\r\nWhich continues the whole time of drawing the lottery, at CARRICK’S\r\nSTATE LOTTERY OFFICE, King’s Arms, 72, Threadneedle-street. _At one\r\nguinea each_ NUMBERS _are taken_, to return three twenty pound prizes,\r\nvalue sixty pounds, for every given number that shall be drawn any prize\r\nwhatever above twenty pounds during the whole drawing.\r\n\r\n⁂ _Numbers at half a guinea to receive half the above._\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nJ. Cook respectfully solicits the public will favour the following\r\n_incomparably advantageous plan_ with attention, by which _upwards of\r\nthirty-two thousand chances for obtaining a prize (out of the\r\nforty-eight thousand tickets) are given in one policy_.\r\n\r\nPOLICIES OF FIVE GUINEAS _with three numbers_, with the first number\r\nwill gain\r\n\r\n  20000 if a prize of £20000\r\n  10000               £10000\r\n   5000               £ 5000\r\n\r\n_with the second number_ will gain\r\n\r\n  6000 guineas if 20000\r\n  3000            10000\r\n  1500             5000\r\n\r\n_with the third number_ will gain\r\n\r\n  3000 guineas if 20000\r\n  1500            10000\r\n  1200             5000\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the lottery act of 1782 there was a clause designed to prevent the\r\ninsurance of tickets by any method. The lottery-office keepers persisted\r\nin their devices, and the magistrates enforced the law.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of January 1785 several lottery-office keepers were\r\nconvicted, before the lord mayor and aldermen, in penalties of fifty\r\npounds each for insuring numbers contrary to law; and in Trinity term\r\nthe following cause was tried at Westminster, before lord Loughborough.\r\n\r\nA lottery-office keeper near Charing-cross was plaintiff, and the\r\nsheriff of Middlesex defendant. The action was to recover one thousand\r\nfive hundred and sixty-six pounds, levied by the sheriff, about a year\r\npast, on the plaintiff’s goods, by virtue of three writs of _fieri\r\nfacias_, issued from the court of King’s-bench. It seems that the above\r\nplaintiff was convicted in three penalties of five hundred pounds each,\r\nfor insuring lottery tickets; but previous to the trial’s coming on, for\r\nsome indulgence, he had, by himself or agents, consented not to bring\r\nany writ of error, and an order of _nisi prius_ was drawn up, and served\r\nupon his attorney; notwithstanding which, three writs of error were sued\r\nout. The court of King’s-bench being then moved, made an order that the\r\nexecutions should be levied according to the original rule of court: the\r\nsheriff made the levy, and the money being paid and impounded in his\r\nhands, the above action was brought to get the same returned. The\r\nnovelty of the action caused much laughter among the counsel, and, after\r\na few minutes’ hearing, his lordship ordered the plaintiff to be\r\nnonsuited.[479]\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY WOOD CUTS.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, that at this period engravings on their printed\r\naddresses do not seem to have been resorted to by the lottery-schemers\r\nas they have been since, for the purpose of stimulating attention to\r\ntheir plans. No subject of the kind therefore can be given, to\r\nillustrate their proceedings at the time now under review; but on\r\narriving, as we shall presently, at days nearer our own, they crowd upon\r\nus, and _several_ will be given in the next sheet as specimens of their\r\ningenuity and taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES PRICE, _alias_ PATCH, &c.\r\n\r\nThis man was a lottery-office keeper. His notoriety and his fate render\r\nhim one of the most remarkable characters of the age wherein he lived;\r\nit is therefore proposed to give a brief outline of his life.\r\n\r\nHis father, Charles Price, was “by trade a tailor.” He came from South\r\nWales, about the year 1702, and worked at several places in London, till\r\nin 1710 he got into Monmouth-street, as journeyman to a salesman there.\r\nBy strict application he was, in a few years, enabled to set up as a\r\nmaster, and kept a saleshop the corner of Earl-street and West-street,\r\nSeven Dials. Some time previous to this he had married a woman who bore\r\na very good character. He was very clever in his business, but\r\nilliterate; yet exceedingly artful, and the flower of Monmouth-street\r\nfor oratory in the sale of his goods: at the same time, he was sincere\r\nin his friendships, despised downright knavery, and had a regard to\r\nreputation. His eldest son, Thomas, was bred to his father’s business.\r\nOne Creed, a salesman in Rosemary-lane, used to send him with a cart\r\nloaded with goods round the country; and Creed dying, Thomas decamped\r\nwith the produce of one journey, about 200_l._ For this, and for similar\r\nacts of knavery in his brother Charles, he left them only a shilling\r\neach, and bequeathed the rest of his property to his daughter. Thomas\r\ndied young.\r\n\r\nCharles, the hero of our history, when about six years of age, was sent\r\nto school, where he acquired the rudiments of the French language, and\r\nwas so neglected in his own, that he was complete in neither. At about\r\ntwelve years’ old he was taken home to assist his father, where he soon\r\ngave proofs of address similar to the following.\r\n\r\nA sailor who had staggered to Monmouth-street to buy some clothes, was\r\ncaught by Charles at the corner, and introduced by him into a room,\r\nwhere, in a summer’s noon, it was hardly possible to distinguish blue\r\nfrom black, or green from blue. The honest tar was shown a coat and\r\nwaistcoat, the real value of which was about two guineas. Though they\r\nwere considerably too little, Charles squeezed him up, and persuaded him\r\nthey fitted exactly. The price being demanded, Charles declared upon his\r\nhonour the lowest farthing he could take was five guineas. The sailor\r\nput his hand in his pocket, and laid down the money. Charles stepped\r\ndown to his father’s journeyman, under pretence of getting something to\r\nput the clothes in, and told him the customer he met with, and that he\r\nmight as well have had six guineas as five. “Do you,” said he, “follow\r\nme up stairs, inquire what I have done, pretend to be very angry, swear\r\nthey cost you six guineas, give me two or three kicks or cuffs, and I\r\ndare swear we shall get more money out of him, and then, as my father is\r\nnot at home, you shall go halves in all we get above the five guineas.”\r\nThe scheme was readily acquiesced in by the journeyman. Charles slipped\r\nup stairs; the journeyman followed, inquiry, blame, and sham blows\r\nensued; the journeyman declared the clothes cost him six guineas out of\r\nhis pocket, and was going to beat Charles again, when the sailor cried,\r\n“Avast, master, don’t beat the boy, if he has made a mistake in a\r\nguinea, why here it is;” and laying it down, departed well pleased with\r\nhis bargain, and that he had saved the lad a drubbing by the\r\ninsignificant trifle of an additional guinea. Charles gave his father\r\ntwo guineas, the journeyman half a one, and kept three guineas and a\r\nhalf to himself.\r\n\r\nThe father soon experienced the effects of his son’s knavery, and put\r\nhim apprentice to a hatter and hosier in St. James’s-street, with a\r\nconsiderable premium, hoping that his conduct would be quite different\r\nfrom what it had been at home; but his master had almost as much reason\r\nto complain of him as his father. Among his other frauds was the\r\nfollowing: he robbed his father of an elegant suit of clothes, in which\r\nhe dressed himself and went to his master, of whom he purchased about\r\nten pounds’ worth of silk stockings, leaving his address, Benjamin\r\nBolingbroke, esq., Hanover-square, and ordering them to be sent in an\r\nhour’s time, when he would pay the person who brought them. Incredible\r\nas it may appear, his master did not know him; to complete the cheat, he\r\ncame back in half an hour, in his usual dress, and was ordered to take\r\nthe goods home, which he actually pretended to do, and thus robbed his\r\nmaster. Having been detected in his villainies, he ran away; and his\r\nfather, in detestation of his principles, disinherited him, soon\r\nafterwards died, and was buried at Lambeth. It may be remarked, that he\r\nwas the first corpse carried over Westminster-bridge, which was on the\r\nfirst day it was free for carriages, when multitudes flocked to see the\r\nopening of the new structure.\r\n\r\nBefore his father’s death, Charles Price became a gentleman’s servant,\r\nand in that capacity lived some years, till he got into the service of\r\nsir Francis Blake Delaval, went with him the tour of Europe, returned to\r\nEngland, and through sir Francis, who was the companion of the\r\ncelebrated Samuel Foote, became comedian. He acted a principal part in\r\nthe scheme by which sir Francis obtained his lady, with a very large\r\nfortune. She went to consult a conjuror, and Foote performed the\r\ncharacter to the satisfaction of his friend. Price afterwards contrived\r\nto conjure Foote out of 500_l._ in a sham scheme in a brewery, wherein\r\nthat gentleman and Price were concerned. Price was made a bankrupt, and\r\nafterwards set up in a distillery, defrauded the revenue, was sent to\r\nthe King’s-bench, released by an insolvent act, again turned brewer, and\r\ndefrauded a gentleman out of 6000_l._ through one of his disguises. He\r\nthen became a lottery-office keeper and stockbroker, gambled in the\r\nalley, was ruined, again set up lottery-office keeper, courted a Mrs.\r\nPounteney, and ran away with her niece, who was the daughter of justice\r\nWood, in the Borough. He practised innumerable frauds, became an adept\r\nin swindling, and had the effrontery to avow his depredations, and laugh\r\nat those he injured.\r\n\r\nPrice was intimate with a Mr. R----s, a grocer retired from business,\r\nwith whom he had for a long time passed as a stockbroker. Price, who\r\nthen lived at Knightsbridge, frequently used to request the favour of\r\nMr. R. to take a bank-note or two into the city, and get them changed\r\ninto small ones. In this he had a two-fold plot. He informed his friend\r\nthat he was intimately acquainted with a very old gentleman, exceedingly\r\nrich, who had been an eminent broker in the alley, but had long retired;\r\nthat his monies in the funds were immense; that the only relation he had\r\nin the world was one sister, to whom he intended to bequeath the best\r\npart of his property; and that his sister was near fifty years of age,\r\nhad never been married, and determined never to marry; and that it was\r\nimpossible the old gentleman could live long, as he was very old, very\r\ninfirm, and almost incapable of going out of doors. This old gentleman,\r\nPrice said, had often asked him to become his executor; and besought him\r\nto recommend another person, in whose fidelity, character, and\r\nintegrity, he could repose an entire confidence, and that he would make\r\nit well worth their while, if they would undertake so friendly and\r\nsolemn an office.--“Now,” said Price to Mr. R., “here is an opportunity\r\nfor us to make a considerable sum in a short time, and, in all\r\nprobability, a very capital fortune in a few years; for the sister being\r\ndetermined not to marry, and having no relations in the world, there is\r\nno doubt but she will leave us the whole of the estate; and, after his\r\ndecease, she will become totally dependent upon us.--I shall see the old\r\ngentleman, Mr. Bond, to-day, and if you will join in the trust, the will\r\nshall be immediately made.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Charles Price, the Arch-Imposter,~\r\n\r\nIN HIS USUAL DRESS--AND IN DISGUISE.]\r\n\r\nTo this proposal Mr. R. consented. In the evening Price returned to\r\nKnightsbridge. He told Mr. R. that he had visited Mr. Bond, who\r\nexpressed great happiness and easiness of mind on such a recommendation,\r\nand desired to see Mr. R. the next day. Price appointed to meet him at\r\ntwelve o’clock at Mr. Bond’s. At the appointed hour, Mr. R. knocked at\r\nthe door. He was shown up stairs by the aforementioned sister-lady, and\r\nintroduced to Mr. Bond, seated in a great chair, his legs in another,\r\nand covered with a night-cap. The poor, infirm, weak, debilitated, old\r\ngentleman regretted the absence of his ever-dear friend Mr. Price, the\r\nmost worthy man in the world, and rang a peal on his friendship, honour,\r\nhonesty, integrity, &c., &c., accompanied with emaciated coughs--was\r\nobliged to go to the city coffee-house--a punctual man--never failed an\r\nappointment--it was the soul of business--and then he told Mr. R. that\r\nhis dear friend desired to meet Mr. R. there exactly at one o’clock--he\r\napproved highly of Mr. Price’s recommendation, and was now happy in his\r\nmind--it wanted but a quarter to one, he believed, and he hoped Mr. R.\r\nwould not fail, as his dear friend was very exact indeed. The usual\r\ncompliments passed; the sister conducted Mr. R. to the door, who posted\r\naway to the city coffee-house, and left old Mr. Bond, the rich brother,\r\nwho was in reality no other than Mr. Price, and the brother’s maiden\r\nsister, who was a Mrs. Pounteney, to laugh at Mr. R.’s credulity. Mr. R.\r\nhad not been five minutes in the coffee-house before he was joined by\r\nhis friend Price, to whom Mr. R. recapitulated what passed, and as soon\r\nas Price had despatched some pretended business, he proposed calling on\r\nMr. Bond. This was readily acquiesced in by Mr. R. and away they drove\r\nto Leather-lane. When they came there, they were informed by the lady,\r\nthat her brother was just gone out in a coach, on an airing, to\r\nHighgate. In short, Price carried on the scheme completely for several\r\ndays, during which time Mr. R. had twice or thrice seen the old\r\ngentleman. The will was made, and, on the strength of the joint\r\nexecutorship and expectancy, Mr. R. was swindled out of very near a\r\nthousand pounds in cash, and bonds to the amount of two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote, though it does not exhibit him in his Proteus-like\r\ncharacter, exemplifies his cunning and selfishness. He had formed a\r\nconnection with Mr. W----, a brewer, a man of character. Price, who was\r\nthen in the brewery, proposed a project, which was assented to, for\r\npurchasing hops to the amount of two thousand pounds, and he actually\r\nwent into the country, contracted for hops to that amount with\r\nhop-growers in Kent, and then applied to Mr. W. for the two thousand\r\npounds, alledging that there would be a sudden rise of hops, and they\r\ncould not be delivered too soon; and that Mr. W. should have his share\r\nof the profit. From some undisclosed motive, Mr. W. refused to advance\r\nthe money. An unexpected rise, however, did soon after take place, Price\r\nwent into Kent to demand delivery, the growers were shy in delivering,\r\nespecially as they found they had made a bad bargain, and he gained two\r\nhundred pounds for releasing them.\r\n\r\nPrice was servile to extreme meanness, where his servility could be\r\nrecompensed by a shilling. He was master of consummate effrontery, when\r\nprinciple called upon him for that shilling, if it was unsupported by\r\nlaw. He never paid but with an eye to further plunder; and then he\r\nabounded in that species of flattery distinguished under the word\r\n_palaver_. He possessed an extensive knowledge of men and manners, and\r\nto superficial observers appeared a very sensible person. He knew\r\nsomething of most of the living languages; had travelled all over France\r\nand Holland, and been at most of the German courts. He was at Copenhagen\r\nduring the crisis in the fate of the unhappy Matilda queen of Denmark,\r\nsister to George III.; and he wrote a pamphlet in her behalf, tending to\r\nprove that the true motive for the degrading attack on her character,\r\nwas to effect a revolution in favour of the queen dowager’s son. It\r\nproved him to have an eye directed to the cabals of the court, and an\r\nunderstanding capable of developing its intrigues.\r\n\r\nPrice’s character about the ’Change in London was well-known--he was a\r\nkeen, intriguing speculator, well versed in the mystery of the bulls and\r\nbears: his head enabled him to make the most accurate calculations, but\r\nhis heart would not permit him to enjoy the fruit of even his honest\r\nlabours; for he never would comply with the demands of a fortunate\r\ncustomer, unless terrified into it,--and to terrify him required no\r\nsmall portion of ingenuity and resolution. His dishonesty was the spring\r\nof all his misfortunes; it made him shift from place to place to avoid\r\nthe abuse of the vulgar, and the clamorous calls of the few fortunate\r\nadventurers in the lottery. His last office was the corner of\r\nKing-street, Covent-garden, from whence he was driven, by a run of\r\nill-luck, into a private decampment.\r\n\r\nFrom that period, Price lived in obscurity. Though a perfect sycophant\r\nabroad, at home he was an absolute tyrant; nor could a prudent, virtuous\r\nwoman, endowed with every qualification to render the marriage state\r\nhappy, soften his brutal disposition, when the ample fortune he obtained\r\nwith her had been squandered. Having a family of eight children to\r\nsupport, he turned his thoughts to fatal devices, and commenced to forge\r\non the bank of England. His first attack on the bank was about the year\r\n1780, when one of his notes had been taken there, so complete in the\r\nengraving, the signature, the water-marks, and all its parts, that it\r\npassed through various hands unsuspected, and was not discovered till it\r\ncame to a certain department, through which no forgery whatever can pass\r\nundiscovered. The appearance of this note occasioned a considerable\r\nalarm among the directors; and forgery upon forgery flowed in, about the\r\nlottery and Christmas times, without the least probability of\r\ndiscovering the first negociators. Various consultations were held,\r\ninnumerable plans were laid for detection, and they were traced in every\r\nquarter to have proceeded from one man, always disguised, and always\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\nHad Price permitted a partner in his proceedings--had he employed an\r\nengraver--had he procured paper to be made for him, with water-marks\r\nupon it, he must soon have been discovered--but he “was himself\r\n_alone_.” He engraved his own plates, made his own paper with the\r\nwater-marks, and, as much as possible, he was his own negociator. He\r\nthereby confined a secret to himself, which he deemed not safe in the\r\nbreast of another; even Mrs. Price had not the least knowledge or\r\nsuspicion of his proceedings. Having practised engraving till he had\r\nmade himself sufficient master of it, he then made his own ink to prove\r\nhis own works. He next purchased implements, and manufactured the\r\nwater-mark, and began to counterfeit hand-writings. Private attempts to\r\ndiscover him proved thoroughly abortive, and the bank came to the\r\nresolution of describing the offender by the following public\r\nadvertisement, which was continued in all the newspapers for a\r\nconsiderable time to no purpose. It is a very curious document, from the\r\nminuteness with which his disguise is particularized.\r\n\r\n_Public-office, Bow-street, Dec. 5, 1780._\r\n\r\nA FORGERY.\r\n\r\n  Whereas a person, answering the following description, stands charged\r\n  with forging two notes, purporting to be bank-notes, one for forty\r\n  pounds and the other for twenty pounds, whoever will apprehend him, or\r\n  give such immediate notice at this office as may be the means of\r\n  apprehending him, shall receive one hundred pounds’ reward on his\r\n  commitment.\r\n\r\n  Or, if any person concerned in the above forgery, (except the person\r\n  here-under described,) will surrender and discover his or her\r\n  accomplices, he or she will be admitted an evidence for the crown,\r\n  and, on conviction of any one offender therein, receive two hundred\r\n  pounds’ reward.\r\n\r\n  And if any engraver, paper-maker, mould-maker or printer, can give\r\n  information of the engraving any plate, making any mould or paper, or\r\n  printing any note resembling bank-notes, shall receive two hundred\r\n  pounds’ reward, on conviction of any of the offenders in the above\r\n  forgery.\r\n\r\n  He appears about fifty years of age, about five feet six inches high,\r\n  stout made, very sallow complexion, dark eyes and eye-brows, speaks in\r\n  general very deliberately, with a foreign accent; has worn a black\r\n  patch over his left eye, tied with a string round his head, sometimes\r\n  wears a white wig, his hat flapped before, and nearly so at the sides,\r\n  a brown camblet great coat, buttons of the same, with a large cape,\r\n  which he always wears so as to cover the lower part of his face;\r\n  appears to have very thick legs, which hang over his shoes, as if\r\n  swelled, his shoes are very broad at the toes, and little narrow\r\n  old-fashioned silver buckles, black stocking breeches, walks with a\r\n  short crutch stick with an ivory head, stoops, or affects to stoop\r\n  very much, and walks slow as if infirm; he has lately hired many\r\n  hackney-coaches in different parts of the town, and been frequently\r\n  set down in or near Portland-place, in which neighbourhood it is\r\n  supposed he lodges.\r\n\r\n  He is connected with a woman who answers the following\r\n  description:--She is rather tall, and genteel, thin face and person,\r\n  about thirty years of age, light hair, rather a yellow cast on her\r\n  face, and pitted with the small pox, a down-cast look, speaks very\r\n  slow, sometimes wears a coloured linen jacket and petticoat, and\r\n  sometimes a white one, a small black bonnet, and a black cloak, and\r\n  assumes the character of a lady’s maid.\r\n\r\n  N. B. It is said, that about fifteen months since he lodged at Mrs.\r\n  Parker’s, No. 40, in Great Titchfield-street, (who is since dead,) at\r\n  which time he went by the name of Wigmore.\r\n\r\nThis advertisement drove Price to extremities:--it forced him to refrain\r\nfrom the circulation of his forgeries, and for some months put a total\r\nstop to them. It was posted on the walls, and printed as hand-bills, and\r\ndelivered from house to house throughout the whole of the quarter where\r\nhe was most suspected to reside; at the very house which he daily\r\nresorted to, and where all his implements were fixed; in the\r\nneighbourhood of Marybone, Portland-place, Oxford-street, and\r\nTottenham-court-road. One of them was thrown down an area to the only\r\nperson in whom he placed any confidence, a female whom the reader will\r\nbe better acquainted with. By these means Price was informed of his\r\nimmediate danger, and took his measures accordingly. Eagerness to secure\r\nbanished the foresight and caution which are necessary in the pursuit of\r\nartful villany. The animal whose sagacity is a proverb, can never be\r\nsecured in haste; he must be entrapped by superior patience and caution.\r\n\r\nThough Price had no partner in any branch of the forgery of a bank-note,\r\nyet he had a confidante in his wife’s aunt, by the mother’s side, whom\r\nhe had known previous to his marriage. Her name was Pounteney; and,\r\nunknown to Mrs. Price, he was daily with her. He divided his\r\ndinner-times equally between the two, and Mrs. Price had for ten years’\r\npast, through the impositions of her husband, considered her aunt either\r\nas dead, or residing abroad. His wife had too little art, or\r\nunderstanding in the ways of the world, to be what is commonly called\r\ncunning. In short, her character was that of perfect simplicity. Price\r\ntherefore thought her not fit to be trusted. Her aunt, on the contrary,\r\nwas wily, crafty and capable of executing any plan Price would chalk out\r\nfor her. She was a woman after his own heart; and having made choice of\r\nthis woman as an assistant, and his apparatus being ready, he began his\r\noperations. He lived then at Paddington with his wife, whom he went to\r\nnightly; and at lodgings, near Portland-place, he daily visited her\r\naunt, where the implements for his undertakings were concealed. His next\r\nand chief object was a negociator, and he procured one in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the drawing of the lottery for the year 1780, Price put an\r\nadvertisement into the “Daily Advertiser” for a servant who had been\r\nused to live with a single gentleman, and the direction was to “C. C.\r\nMarlborough-street coffee-house, Broad-street, Carnaby-market.” An\r\nhonest young man, who at that time lived with a musical instrument-maker\r\nin the Strand, read this advertisement, and sent a letter to the\r\nspecified address. At the end of a week, one evening, about dusk, a\r\ncoachman inquired for the person who had answered the advertisement,\r\nsaying there was a gentleman over the way, in a coach, wanted to speak\r\nwith him. The young man went to the coach, was desired to step in, and\r\nthere saw an apparently aged foreigner, gouty, wrapped up with five or\r\nsix yards of flannel about his legs, a camblet surtout buttoned up over\r\nhis chin, close to his mouth, a large _patch_ over his left eye, and\r\nevery part of his face concealed except his nose, right eye, and a small\r\npart of that cheek. This person was Price, who caused the young man to\r\nsit at his left side, on which eye the patch was; so that Price could\r\ntake an askance look at him with his right eye, and discover only a\r\nsmall portion of his own face. Thus disguised, he seemed between sixty\r\nand seventy years of age, and afterwards, when the man saw him standing,\r\nhe appeared nearly six feet high, owing to boots or shoes with heels\r\nlittle less than four inches high. To aid the deception, he was so\r\nbuttoned up and straightened as to appear perfectly lank. Price’s real\r\nheight was about five feet six inches; he was a compact, neat made man,\r\nrather square shouldered, and somewhat inclined to corpulency; his legs\r\nwere firm and well set. His features assisted his design to look\r\nconsiderably older than he really was; his nose was aquiline, his eyes\r\nwere small and grey, his mouth stood very much inwards, his lips were\r\nvery thin, his chin was pointed and prominent, he had a pale complexion,\r\nand loss of teeth favoured his disguise of speech. His natural form was\r\nexceedingly upright; he was active and quick in his walk, and was what\r\nis usually described “a dapper made man.” To the young man, whose\r\nchristian name was Samuel, Price affected great age, with a faint hectic\r\ncough, and so much bodily infirmity as almost to disable him from\r\ngetting out of the coach. Price told him he was not wanted by himself,\r\nbut as under servant to a young nobleman of fortune, under age, and then\r\nin Bedfordshire, to whom he was, and had been some years, guardian. He\r\ninquired into the particulars of Samuel’s life, and thinking him honest\r\nand ingenuous, and therefore unsuspicious, and suitable to his purpose,\r\nhe talked to him about wages. Samuel inquired whether he was to be in\r\nlivery or not: Price replied, that he could not really tell, for the\r\nyoung nobleman was a very whimsical character, but that was a\r\ncircumstance which might be settled hereafter. To carry on the farce, he\r\ndesired Samuel to call his master to the coach to give him a character,\r\nand his master came and gave him such an one as Price pretended to\r\napprove; he then hired Samuel at eighteen shillings per week, and\r\ngave him a direction to himself, as Mr. _Brank_, at No. 39,\r\nTitchfield-street, Oxford-street.\r\n\r\nPursuant to appointment, on the second or third evening afterwards,\r\nSamuel went to Titchfield-street, and there entered on the service of\r\nthe minor nobleman, by waiting on Mr. _Brank_. Price resumed his\r\ndiscourse respecting his ward, the eccentricity and prodigality of his\r\nmanners, and his own hard task in endeavouring to prevent him from\r\nsquandering his money, especially in those deceitful allurances called\r\nlottery tickets. He said, although he was his guardian, he was still\r\nobliged to comply with some of those whims, in opposition to his own\r\nadvice and remonstrance. Old Mr. _Brank_ talked of the happy prospects\r\nfor Samuel by serving such a master, and Samuel talked of his wages and\r\nclothes, and whether he was to be in livery or not. It was concluded,\r\nthat for the present he should procure a drab coat, turned up with red,\r\ntill the nobleman’s pleasure was known, or he came to town: he was\r\nordered to get the clothes at his own charge, and make out his bill;\r\nwhich he did, but was never repaid. This circumstance corresponded with\r\nPrice’s usual conduct: he never was known to part with a shilling from\r\none hand, till he had more than double its value in the other. It should\r\nbe observed, that Samuel was so placed on the left side of the pretended\r\nMr. Brank, on which side the patch was, that during the whole of the\r\nconversation he could never see the right side of Price’s face.\r\n\r\nBefore Samuel took leave of the old gentleman, he was ordered to come\r\nagain in the evening of the first day of the drawing of the lottery.\r\nPrice pretended, that he seldom went to the nobleman’s town house of an\r\nevening, and therefore, to avoid giving him unnecessary trouble, he was\r\nto attend in Titchfield-street. On that evening he pulled out a variety\r\nof papers, letters, &c., and told Samuel he had received orders from the\r\nthoughtless young nobleman to purchase lottery tickets, as a venture\r\nagainst his coming to town, and for that purpose he meant to employ\r\nSamuel. He produced some seeming bank-notes, and gave Samuel two, one of\r\ntwenty pounds, the other of forty pounds. He directed him to take their\r\nnumbers and dates on a piece of paper, for fear of losing them, and to\r\ngo to a lottery office in the Hay-market, and with the one of twenty\r\npounds to purchase “an eight guinea chance:” from thence he was to go to\r\nthe corner of Bridge-street, Westminster, to buy another out of the\r\nforty pound note, and wait at the door of the Parliament-street\r\ncoffee-house till he came to him. With these notes Samuel bought each of\r\nthe chances, and was on his way to the Parliament-street coffee-house\r\nwhen, from the opposite side of the way, he was hailed by Mr. Brank, who\r\ncomplimented him on his speed, and said he had been so quick, that he,\r\nBrank, had not had time to get to the coffee-house. He was then\r\ninterrogated, if he had made the purchases, and, replying in the\r\naffirmative, was again commended for his diligence: Brank also inquired,\r\nif any mistake had happened; and all this with a deal of coughing,\r\nimbecility of speech, and feigned accent.\r\n\r\nWhen Samuel received the notes, he received as many canvass bags as he\r\nwas ordered to buy shares, and to put each distinct share, and the\r\nbalance of each note, into a separate bag, for fear, as Brank said, the\r\nchance of one office might be confused with the chance of another, and\r\nSamuel be thereby puzzled to know where he had bought the different\r\nchances; and by such confusion, or forgetfulness, it might not be\r\nrecollected where to apply in case of a fortunate number.\r\n\r\nMr. Brank having secured the chances and balances, ordered Samuel to go\r\nto Goodluck’s at Charing-cross, from thence to King-street,\r\nCovent-garden, and York-street, Covent-garden, and purchase some other\r\nsmall shares and chances, and then meet him at the city coffee-house,\r\nCheapside. To these places the young man went, and having bought his\r\nnumbers and changed his notes, as he was going along York-street, his\r\nmaster called to him from a coach, pretended he was fortunate in thus\r\nseeing him, made Samuel step in, got the produce of the forgery, and\r\naway they drove to the city.\r\n\r\nIn their way thither, Brank applauded his servant’s despatch; gave him\r\nmore notes, to the amount of four hundred pounds, with instructions to\r\npurchase shares and chances, at offices about the Exchange; and directed\r\nhim, as before, to put the chances and money received at each office in\r\na separate bag. For this purpose Samuel was set down from the coach in\r\nCheapside, and having executed his commissions returned, agreeable to\r\nhis orders, to the city coffee-house, where he waited a few minutes and\r\nthen Mr. Brank came hobbling up to him, and took him into a coach, that\r\nwas waiting hard by. Brank resumed complaints of his health and\r\ninfirmities, and observed, that the fatigues of business had kept him\r\nlonger than he expected; but he warned Samuel to be always exceedingly\r\npunctual. His reason for urging punctuality was the dread of a\r\ndiscovery, and to prevent consultations, by which he might be detected.\r\nOn their way to Long-acre, where the coachman was ordered to drive,\r\nBrank amused his servant with flattering promises for his attention and\r\nfidelity; and at parting put a guinea into his hand, and gave him orders\r\nto be in waiting, for a few days, at his old master’s in the Strand.\r\n\r\nIt afterwards appeared, that whenever Samuel went to an office a woman,\r\nunobserved by him, always walked in at the same time, and looked about\r\nher as if accompanying some one else in the shop; and as soon as Samuel\r\nhad done his business she also walked away. This woman was Mrs.\r\nPounteney, the aunt of Price’s wife, described in the advertisement and\r\nhand-bill issued by the bank. She constantly accompanied Price in a\r\ncoach whenever he went out, watched Samuel at every office, as soon as\r\nhe had safely got out stepped across the way to Price, who was in the\r\ncoach, informed him of the success, and then Samuel was hailed, and\r\nPrice secured the property while she kept out of sight; nor did Samuel\r\never see her during his servitude. During his residence at\r\nTitchfield-street, which was but a week, Price always appeared and went\r\nout as Brank, accompanied by Mrs. Pounteney. In case of any accidental\r\ndiscovery, she was ready to receive the disguise, so that Brank might be\r\ninstantly shifted to Price, and Price to Brank, and Samuel thereby be\r\nrendered incapable of identifying the man that had employed him.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday morning after Price’s last adventure, a coachman inquired\r\nfor Samuel at his old master’s, by whom the coachman was informed, that\r\nthough Sam worked he did not lodge there, and that he should not see him\r\ntill the next morning. The coachman held a parcel in his hand, which he\r\nsaid was for Samuel, and which the master desired him to leave, and he\r\nshould have it the next day; the coachman replied, he was ordered not to\r\nleave it, but to take it back in case he could not see the man, and\r\naccordingly went across the way with it; there the master saw the\r\nelderly gentleman, with whom he had conversed on Samuel’s character a\r\nfew days before, to whom the coachman delivered the parcel. Samuel’s\r\nmaster saw this old gentleman get into a coach; but in a minute the\r\ncoachman returned and left the parcel, which contained notes to the\r\namount of three hundred pounds, with a letter directing Samuel to buy,\r\non the next morning, a sixteenth, an eight guinea chance, and a whole\r\nticket, to repeat his purchases as before, till the whole were changed,\r\nand to meet his master, Mr. Brank, at Mill’s coffee-house,\r\nGerrard-street, Soho, at twelve o’clock the next day. Samuel duly\r\nexecuted these orders, but, on inquiry at the coffee-house, he found\r\nno such person as Mr. Brank had been there; in a few minutes,\r\nhowever, as he was standing at the coffee-house door, a coachman\r\nsummoned him to Mr. Brank, who was waiting in a coach at the corner of\r\nMacclesfield-street. He desired Samuel to come in, and made him sit on\r\nthe left hand, as before described, and having received the tickets,\r\nshares, and balances, ordered him to bid the coachman drive towards\r\nHampstead. On the way, he gave Samuel three sixteenths as a reward for\r\nhis diligence, and talked much of his ward, who, he said, would be in\r\ntown in a day or two, when he would speak highly of Samuel’s industry.\r\nHe discoursed on these subjects till they reached Mother Black-cap’s at\r\nKentish-town, and then Samuel received orders to bid the coachman turn\r\nround; and, on their way back, Samuel had notes for five hundred pounds\r\ngiven to him, with directions to lay them out in the same manner about\r\nthe ’Change, and meet his master at the same place in the evening, where\r\nhe said he should dine; but, for reasons easily imagined, Samuel was\r\nordered not to make his purchases at the offices he had been to before.\r\n\r\nSamuel, having performed this task also, went to the coffee-house, where\r\na porter accosted him, and conducted him to his master in a coach as\r\nusual. He was now blamed for his delay, and an appearance of anger\r\nassumed, with a declaration, that he would not do if not punctual, for\r\nthat the nobleman was very particular in time, even to a minute. Samuel\r\napologized, and Brank received the cash and shares, and ordered him to\r\ngo to the New Inn Westminster-bridge and hire a post-chaise to carry\r\nthem to Greenwich to meet the nobleman’s steward, who was also his\r\nbanker, to whom he was going for money to purchase more tickets;\r\nobserving, at the same time, on the imprudence and prodigality of his\r\nward.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich, Samuel was desired to go to the Ship and order a dinner,\r\nwhile Brank was engaged, as he pretended, in negociating his business;\r\nhe instructed him not to wait longer than three o’clock, but go to\r\ndinner at that time, if he, Brank, did not return. It was not till half\r\npast four that Brank came hobbling, coughing, and seemingly quite out of\r\nbreath with fatigue. They then drank tea together, and afterwards\r\nreturned in the chaise to Lombard-street, where it was discharged. There\r\nSam received more notes to the amount of 350_l._, which he got rid of in\r\nthe usual way; and at the city coffee-house was again fortunate enough\r\nto meet his master before he got to the door. Brank ordered him to\r\nattend the next evening at his lodgings, which he accordingly did, and\r\nafterwards at three or four other times, in the course of which\r\nattendance he negociated 500_l._ more of the forged notes.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the close of Samuel’s services. In negociating the last\r\nsum he had received, he went to Brooksbank’s and Ruddle’s, where he was\r\ninterrogated as to whom he lived with; Samuel said he was servant to a\r\nvery rich nobleman’s guardian, that he was at board-wages, and gave his\r\naddress to his old master, the musical instrument-maker. Having\r\ndelivered Brank the cash, &c. in the usual way, he was told, that\r\nperhaps he might not be wanted again for a week, and that he might wait\r\ntill sent for. Before the expiration of that time, however, Samuel was\r\napprehended, and taken to Bow-street, where he was examined by the\r\nmagistrates and gentlemen from the bank; and telling his artless tale,\r\nwhich was not believed, he was committed to Tothillfields-bridewell, on\r\nsuspicion of forgery.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the poor lad on his apprehension, his horror on being\r\nconfined in a prison, and his dread of being executed as a forger of\r\ncounterfeit bank-notes, were only equalled by the astonishment of the\r\ndirectors of the bank and the magistrates, at the sagacity of the\r\nmanufacturer, who had hitherto evaded every possibility of detection.\r\nNor did they appear at all persuaded of Sam’s innocence, though his\r\nstory was, in part, confirmed by his former master, the musical\r\ninstrument-maker. The forged note he had passed at Brooksbank’s and\r\nRuddle’s, where he had been interrogated, was the means of his\r\napprehension. In a day or two it was paid into the bank, traced back to\r\nBrooksbank’s and Ruddle’s office, and, immediate application being made\r\nto Bow-street, the lad was taken into custody.\r\n\r\nSamuel’s examinations were frequent and long, and in the end the\r\nfollowing scheme was laid to secure the fabricator. Samuel having been\r\nordered by Brank to stay till he was sent for, an inferior officer of\r\nBow-street was stationed at the musical instrument-maker’s in the\r\nStrand, where Samuel worked, in case Brank should call in the mean time.\r\nAfter the lapse of a few days, Price sent Samuel a message to meet him\r\nthe next day at Mill’s coffee-house, exactly at eleven o’clock. This\r\nwas communicated to Mr. Bond, a clerk at Bow-street office, who ordered\r\nSamuel to comply, but not to go till five minutes past the time. The\r\nabove inferior officer attended at a distance, disguised as a porter,\r\nwith a knot on his shoulder, and Bond, dressed as a “lady,” followed at\r\na small distance. When Samuel arrived at the coffee-house he found that\r\na real porter had that instant been there and inquired for him, and\r\ncould have been hardly got out of the door. This information Samuel\r\ndirectly communicated to the “lady,” (Bond of Bow-street,) and Samuel\r\nwas sent back to wait; but Brank, in a hackney-coach hard by, had\r\ndiscovered the momentary conversation between Samuel and the disguised\r\nofficers, and took immediate flight. An instant rush was made at\r\nTitchfield-street, but in vain; Blank had not been there since Samuel\r\nand he had left it together, and the police were entirely at fault. The\r\nadvertisements were again issued, and hand-bills were showered around to\r\nno purpose. Poor Samuel, however, having tolerably established his\r\ninnocence, was, after suffering eleven months’ imprisonment, discharged\r\nwith a present of twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing lottery, Price played the same artful game with notes of\r\nhigher value; those of 20_l._ and 40_l._ were grown too suspicious,\r\nanother lad had been taken into custody, another _rush_ made, and\r\n_Price_ was missed again by a moment.\r\n\r\nPrice’s next scheme was an advertisement for a person in the linen\r\ndrapery business; and with notes of from 50_l._ to 100_l._ two young\r\nmen, his agents, purchased linen drapery at different shops. They were\r\ndetected by having passed an 100_l._ note to Mr. Wollerton, a\r\nlinen-draper in Oxford-street, who recovered the whole of his property\r\nthrough Bond the officer, by whom it was seized at No. 3, on the\r\nTerrace, in Tottenham-court-road.\r\n\r\nTo follow Price through all his proceedings would be impossible: in\r\nNovember 1782, Mr. Spilsbury of Soho-square, the proprietor of some\r\nmedicinal “drops,” received a card bearing the name of Wilmott, which\r\nhad been left by a person who had called at his house in his absence.\r\nThe next evening the following note was delivered at Mr. Spilsbury’s.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Wilmott’s complits to Mr. Spilsbur. wishes to converse with him\r\n  10 minutes. having an Order for His drops, at half past five o’clock\r\n  this evening.\r\n\r\n  “No. 17, _Gresse-street, Rathbone-place_.”\r\n\r\nAt the time mentioned in the note Mr. Spilsbury went to Gresse-street,\r\nwhere he was shown into a parlour by a foot-boy, and waited until Mr.\r\nWilmott made his appearance. He appeared to be a very infirm old man, in\r\na great coat and a slouched hat, with a piece of red flannel round the\r\nlower part of his face, a large bush-wig on, and his legs wrapped over\r\nwith flannel; he wore green spectacles, and a green silk shade hanging\r\nfrom his hat, but no patch on his eye: this was Price. He and Mr.\r\nSpilsbury had frequently met at Percy-street coffee-house,\r\nRathbone-place, and often conversed together; but on this occasion Mr.\r\nSpilsbury had no idea or recollection of his old acquaintance. As soon\r\nas Price entered the parlour, he observed on his own dress; and said he\r\nhad exceedingly suffered from the drawing of a tooth by an unskilful\r\ndentist, and wore the flannel on his face in order to avoid catching\r\ncold. He then familiarly conversed with Mr. Spilsbury, extolled the\r\nmerits of his “drops,” recounted great cures which he knew they had\r\nperformed, styled himself a dealer in diamonds, and dismissed Mr.\r\nSpilsbury with the promise of an order in a few days. It was evidently\r\npostponed to strengthen Mr. Spilsbury’s opinion of him, but at last it\r\narrived in the following note:--\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Wilmott’s compliments to Mr. Spilsbur, desires he will put up\r\n  twelve bottles of drops at 3_s._ 6_d._ against Friday three o’clock.\r\n  the boy will call and pay for them. also, Mr. Spilsbur will send a\r\n  copy or form of an Advertisement--and attestation, leaving a blank for\r\n  the names. the case was--the man was violently broke out in legs, body\r\n  and face, and he actually had no other physic than two of the bottles.\r\n  and it is really astonishing how much He is recovered.--when Mr.\r\n  Wilmott comes to town to-morrow week He will send the voucher\r\n  authenticated by 6 people of consequence.\r\n\r\n  “_Gresse-street_, No. 17.”\r\n\r\nThe boy did not call on the Friday mentioned; but on the Friday week he\r\nbrought a letter, in which Mr. Wilmott desired Mr. Spilsbury to send two\r\nguineas’ worth of the drops, and change for a 10_l._ bank-note, and to\r\nbe particular in sending guineas of good weight. The bank-note appeared\r\nto be a new one, change was got in the neighbourhood, and the drops\r\nsent; and the next note Mr. Spilsbury received was from Sir Sampson\r\nWright, desiring his attendance at Bow-street, where, to his\r\nastonishment, he was informed of the forgery. He related the preceding\r\nparticulars to the magistrate, and produced the two letters. The\r\nofficers paid an immediate visit to Gresse-street, but old Mr. Wilmott\r\nhad previously departed.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, Mr. Spilsbury met his acquaintance, Mr. Price, at\r\nthe Percy-street coffee-house; and there, drinking his chocolate, and\r\ntalking over the occurrences of the day, Mr. Spilsbury told the\r\nforegoing story to his coffee-house acquaintance, while Price every now\r\nand then called out “Lack a day! Good God! who could conceive such\r\nknavery could exist! What, and did the bank refuse payment, sir?” “O\r\nyes,” said Mr. Spilsbury, with some degree of acrimony; “though it is on\r\nthe faith of the bank of England that I and a great many others have\r\ntaken them, and they are so inimitably executed, that the nicest judges\r\ncannot detect them.” “Good God!” said Price, “he must have been an\r\ningenious villain!--What a complete old scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nIt is related, that when the celebrated artist William Wynn Ryland was\r\nto be executed for forging an East-india bond, Price intreated the use\r\nof a dining-room window in Oxford-street, at the house of a gentleman\r\nwhom he had defrauded in the same manner he had done Mr. Spilsbury; and\r\nPrice was present when Ryland passed to Tyburn, and on that occasion\r\npointed to Ryland, saying “There goes one of the most ingenious men in\r\nthe world, but as wicked as he is ingenious--he is the identical man who\r\nhas done all the mischief in the character of _Patch_: he deserves his\r\nfate, and he would confess the fact, if he was not in hopes of a\r\nrespite; which he would have obtained, perhaps, had not the directors\r\nbeen certain that it was charity to the public to let him suffer.”\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the fraud practised by Price on Mr. R.\r\nof Knightsbridge. One in a family was not enough for him, and Mr. R’s\r\nbrother, who lived in Oxford-street, experienced the effect of Price’s\r\ningenuity in crime. Price had been often there, and bought a variety of\r\nthings, and was perfectly well known in his real person, and by his\r\nproper name. One day, however, a hackney-coach carried him thither\r\ndisguised as an old man, and in that character he made some purchases.\r\nIn a day or two he repeated his visit, and on a third day, when he knew\r\nMr. R. was from home, he went again with his face so coloured that he\r\nseemed in a deep jaundice. The shopman, to whom he was full of\r\ncomplaints, told him that he had a receipt for that disorder, which had\r\ncured his father of it, and offered him the prescription. Price accepted\r\nit, and promised that if it succeeded he would liberally reward him. In\r\na few days, he again appeared before the shopman perfectly freed from\r\nthe complaint, and acknowledging his great obligations to him, said he\r\nhad but a short time to live in the world, and having very few relations\r\nto leave any thing to, he begged his acceptance of a 50_l._ bank-note,\r\nat the same time, he said, he wanted cash for another. Mr. R. not being\r\nin the way, the grateful shopman stepped out, and got change for it. The\r\nnext day Price having watched Mr. R’s going out, prevailed on the lad to\r\ntake five other 50_l._ notes to his master’s banker, and there get them\r\nchanged for smaller ones. Price’s notes soon got to the bank, and of\r\ncourse were stopped. They were traced to Mr. R’s. His lad was\r\ninterrogated, and as Mr. R. positively refused to pay the 250_l._ to his\r\nbankers, they brought an action against him, which was tried in the\r\ncourt of common pleas, before Lord Loughborough, and the bankers\r\nobtained a verdict. The most extraordinary circumstances pending the\r\nsuit were, that Mr. R. communicated the story to Price, who offered him\r\nall the assistance in his power, and became a principal agent in the\r\ndefence. He was, of all others, the most active in procuring witnesses\r\nfor Mr. R., and actually attended the trial, without the least\r\nsuspicion, on the part of any individual concerned, that he was the\r\nperpetrator of the mischief.\r\n\r\nIt is an extraordinary and almost incredible fact, that during a period\r\nof six years, five of which had elapsed after the remarkable\r\nadvertisement issued at the instance of the bank in December 1780, Price\r\ncommitted depredations of this nature on the public with impunity. The\r\ndeceptions by which he circulated his forged notes through so long a\r\nperiod, were as varied as the nature of each new circumstance required.\r\nAt last he turned another species of forgery, equally artful, and, for a\r\ntime, equally successful. He went to the coffee-houses near the Royal\r\nExchange in a new disguise, and there was accustomed to get a boy to\r\ntake a sum of 10_l._ to the bank, with directions to receive from the\r\nteller the customary ticket to the cashier who pays; but the lad had his\r\nespecial orders not to go to the cashier for the money, as the teller is\r\naccustomed to direct, but as soon as the boy was out of the teller’s\r\nsight he was to turn another way, and bring the ticket to Price at the\r\ncoffee-house. There Price used to alter the teller’s tickets from 10_l._\r\nto 100_l._ by adding an 0, or by placing a 1 before any other sum where\r\nthe addition was easy, so as to make 50 into 150, &c., and then send the\r\ntickets by other hands to the cashiers, who paid the increased sums\r\nunsuspectedly.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was his last. One of the notes he had received at the bank,\r\non a forged ticket, he had passed at Mr. Aldous’s, a pawn-broker in\r\nBerwick-street, where he was known by the name of Powel, and went two or\r\nthree times a week to pledge things of value. An officer was placed at\r\nMr. Aldous’s till his next call, which was the next day but one, when he\r\nwas secured and carried to Bow-street. His behaviour there was\r\nexceedingly insolent. Mr. Bond, who, when Price kept a lottery-office in\r\nKing-street, Covent-garden, was clerk at Bow-street, had visited him on\r\naccount of some money due to Sir John Fielding’s maid servant, gained by\r\ninsuring with Price, which he had refused to pay her; but when informed\r\nby Mr. Bond who her master was, he waited on Sir John, and satisfied her\r\nclaim. He now taxed Mr. Bond, who had been made a magistrate, with\r\nprejudice against him on account of the insurance affair, and complained\r\nthat he should not have justice done him. He also urged against Mr.\r\nAbraham Newland, esq., principal cashier of the bank, that he could\r\nexpect nothing from him but every possible injury, on account of some\r\nformer antipathy that gentleman had conceived towards him; and he\r\nimputed desire of revenge to every individual whose duty it was to\r\nrender him amenable to justice.\r\n\r\nWhen under examination, the chief magistrate, Sir Sampson Wright,\r\nsuddenly called out “Sam;” the young man immediately answered, and at\r\nthe same moment appeared before his old master, who started as at a\r\nghost; but, recollecting himself, made a polite bow to his former\r\nservant, with a view either to awaken his sympathy, or to hint at what\r\nhe might expect if he disclaimed him. Samuel, however, could only swear\r\nto his voice, for he had not the least idea of his person or features.\r\nPrice was committed to Tothillfields-bridewell, where he turned his\r\nthoughts to the destruction of the implements. Well knowing that nothing\r\ncould be extracted from Mrs. Price, or any of his family, to affect him,\r\nhe had declared, when under examination, that he lived with them at a\r\ncheesemonger’s in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road; and he was\r\nequally secure that nothing could be found there to afford the least\r\nsuspicion of his being the forger described under the character of\r\n_Patch_. His next step was to obtain an interview with Mrs. Price and\r\nhis eldest son, a youth about fifteen years of age. To his wife’s great\r\nsurprise, he communicated to her the secret of his lodgings, and the\r\ncircumstances respecting her aunt. He wrote a letter to Mrs. Pounteney,\r\ninforming her of his situation, and desiring her instantly to destroy\r\nevery atom of the apparatus, clothes, &c.; he tore up the inner sole of\r\nhis son’s shoe, and putting the letter under, it passed safe.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Pounteney received the letter, she burnt every article of\r\nclothes in which Price had disguised himself, and sent for a carpenter,\r\nto whom he had never been visible, to take down the wood frame, presses,\r\nand other instruments with which Price had made his paper, and printed\r\noff his notes. While the maid was gone for the carpenter, her mistress\r\nput the copper-plates into the fire, and, rendering them pliable,\r\nreduced them to small pieces. These, with a large bundle of small wires,\r\nused in the manufacture of the paper and water-marks, she desired\r\nPrice’s son to take to the adjacent fields, and there distribute them\r\nbeneath the dust heaps; and the pieces lay there till, by a stratagem,\r\nthey were discovered and brought to Bow-street. The carpenter took down\r\nthe apparatus, and being paid and despatched, every thing was brought\r\ndown and reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nThroughout Price’s examinations, his assurance was the most remarkable\r\nfeature in his conduct; but the audacity by which he sought to baffle\r\nhis accusers was so reckless, as to disclose a circumstance which\r\nlargely added to the grounds for believing him to be the criminal who\r\nhad so long eluded justice. From the extreme art he had adopted to\r\neffectually disguise his person, while committing his enormous frauds,\r\nthere was no connected proof of his identity. Long before his\r\napprehension, he had hazarded experiments to discover whether his\r\ndisguises were effectual. He would go to the coffee-houses about the\r\n’Change, where he was thoroughly well known as Mr. Price, and in his\r\nreal character inquire for Mr. Norton, write a letter, and leave it at\r\nthe bar. In ten minutes he would return as Mr. Norton, receive the\r\nletter, and drink his coffee. While in Tothillfields-bridewell, a boy\r\nwho had more than once taken cash for him to the tellers at the bank,\r\ntogether with the boy’s mother, who had also seen him, were conveyed to\r\nthe prison to view him. The boy could not at all identify him: the\r\nmother was more positive, but still the proof was deemed scarcely\r\nsufficient to convict him. He had pledged things of value several times,\r\nunder the name of Powel, with Mr. Aldous. Mrs. Pounteney had done the\r\nsame in the character of Mrs. Powel. They had talked of each other, and\r\neach of them had at different times pledged the same article; yet Price\r\non his examination denied the least knowledge of her; impudently\r\nthreatened to bring actions for false imprisonment; and ridiculing the\r\nofficers for not finding a ten pound note in his fob, under his watch,\r\nwhen he was searched, he heedlessly produced it--this identical note was\r\none of the notes delivered by the cashier upon a teller’s ticket which\r\nPrice had forged!\r\n\r\nPrice had been brought up three times for the purpose of being viewed,\r\nand his sagacity perceived the impossibility of his escaping the hand of\r\njustice. He told the keeper he had been “_betrayed_,” but this was not\r\nthe fact. Meditating to avoid a public execution, he informed his son\r\nthat the people of the prison came into his room sooner than he wished;\r\nand that he had something secret to write, which they might get at by\r\nsuddenly coming upon him, which he wished to prevent. On this pretence\r\nhe gave his son money to purchase two gimblets and a sixpenny cord,\r\npointing out to him how he would fasten the gimblets in the post, and\r\ntie the cord across the door, which opened inwards. The poor youth\r\nobtained the implements, and Price having fastened the gimblets under\r\ntwo hat screws, was discovered hanging in his room, without coat or\r\nshoes, on the 25th of January, 1786.\r\n\r\nUnder his waistcoat were found three papers. One was a petition to the\r\nking, praying protection for his wife and eight children; all of whom,\r\nhe said, had never offended; and stating, that he had written a pamphlet\r\nwith a view to prevent a war between the crowns of England and Denmark,\r\nand to rescue the character of queen Matilda from the aspersions of the\r\nqueen dowager’s party. The second was a letter of thanks to Mr. Fenwick,\r\nthe keeper of the prison, for his indulgence and favours. The third was\r\na letter to his wife, wherein he begged her forgiveness for the injuries\r\nhe had done her, and intreated her attention to their offspring. In\r\nthese papers, written with his dying hand, the guilty man solemnly\r\ndenied every thing laid to his charge!\r\n\r\nImmediately upon Price’s self-destruction, his unhappy wife, who had\r\nbeen innocent of his iniquities, was urged to discover the woman with\r\nwhom he had been connected. She was assured, that though the verdict of\r\na coroner’s inquest must be formally complied with, yet, if she rendered\r\nthis act of justice to the country, his remains might afterwards receive\r\nchristian burial. Her son was present and added his intreaties that she\r\nwould tell, or suffer him to tell, who and where the woman was; the\r\nfeelings of the widow and the mother prevailed, and she communicated the\r\nresidence of her depraved aunt, who, on being taken into custody,\r\ndisclosed several of the circumstances attending the destruction and\r\nconcealment of the presses and implements. What remained of them were\r\ndestroyed by the police, and she was delivered out of custody to the\r\npunishment of her own thoughts. It was afterwards ascertained, on a\r\nsecond search, that she had not discovered all the machinery. The frame\r\nwith which Price had made his paper was produced to her, and she was\r\nasked what it was: “It is an instrument,” she said, “I use for\r\nmangling.” An answer which may be taken as evidence, that\r\nnotwithstanding the example of Price might have taught her the folly of\r\nwickedness, and though she herself had escaped by the sufferance of\r\nextreme mercy, her mind was still disposed to evil.\r\n\r\nPrice was buried in the cross-roads, but, in about a week, his body was\r\nprivately removed by night.\r\n\r\nThese particulars of Price are more numerous, and the account of him is\r\nmore diffuse, than might be expected in connection with the lottery; but\r\nas he was too remarkable to have been omitted among its incidents, so\r\nhis criminal career was too flagitious and notorious to be lightly\r\npassed over when he was mentioned at all.\r\n\r\nPrice’s lottery-office, in King-street, Covent-garden, was the house now\r\n(in 1826) occupied by Mr. Setchell, the bookseller. On part of the wall\r\nwhere Mr. Setchell’s shutters are placed, there are remains of Price’s\r\nlottery-bills still visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY SUICIDE AND HEARTBREAKING.\r\n\r\nThe “Gentleman’s Magazine” of 1787 inserts what is called “a copy of a\r\npaper left by the unhappy young gentleman who lately shot himself with\r\ntwo pistols in Queen-street, Westminster,” wherein he execrates “the\r\nhead that planned, and the heart that executed, the baneful, destructive\r\nplan of a _Lottery_.”\r\n\r\nThe same year, in a debate in the house of commons on a bill then\r\npassing to prevent insurance, Mr. Francis said his own family furnished\r\na striking instance of the dreadful effects of a passion for this\r\nruinous practice. He had given, at different times, to a female servant\r\nsums of money to the amount of two hundred pounds, to discharge\r\ntradesmen’s bills; and, to his great surprise, he found afterwards that,\r\nregardless of his character, or her own, she had risked the entire sum\r\nin insuring in the lottery, and had lost it. He would have been glad had\r\nthe loss of money been the only one, for he would have taken it upon\r\nhimself; but the poor woman lost her life within a week after this\r\ndiscovery had been made, dying broken-hearted and distracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARING A PRIZE.\r\n\r\nIn the Lottery of 1788 a guinea share of a ticket drawn a 20,000_l._\r\nprize had been duly registered by Shergold and Co. who sold it, and\r\nacquainted the holder by letter that it entitled him to 1500_l._ This\r\nlucky man, who lived in the country, attended his club the same evening,\r\nand imparted the good news he had received. His joy, however, was\r\nconsiderably damped by a person present, who assured him that he never\r\nwould be paid--that his prize was not worth a groat, and that he\r\nhimself knew one who at the beginning of the lottery had a half guinea\r\nshare a prize of 20,000_l._ and was entitled to 700_l._, but was glad to\r\ncompromise it for 50_l._ After reciting a variety of circumstances to\r\nthe same effect, and cunningly working up alarm to the highest pitch, he\r\nat length told the owner of the prize, that he knew some of the\r\nproprietors in Shergold’s house, and he believed he might be able to get\r\nsome money where another could get none; he would therefore venture to\r\ngive 100_l._ for the prize. This proposal being rejected, he advanced to\r\n200_l_. from thence to 300_l._ and at last to 600_l._, which was\r\naccepted. He accordingly paid the money to the unfortunate _fortunate_\r\nadventurer, got possession of the prize, and immediately set off for\r\nLondon, and received the 1500_l._ without difficulty. Several eminent\r\nlawyers, on considering the misrepresentations used in this transaction,\r\nwere of opinion, that it was what is termed a catching bargain, and\r\nadvised the owner, who was cozened out of 900_l._, to apply to equity\r\nfor relief.[480] He seems to have been afraid of the remedy; for, though\r\nhe took counsel’s opinion, it does not appear that he followed it into\r\nchancery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Haymarket theatre, in 1791, a comedy, called the “School for\r\nArrogance,” was produced with a prologue spoken in the character of a\r\nnews-hawker, with the Lottery as one of the topics of intelligence.\r\n\r\n  _After sounding, and calling “Great News!” without; he enters with a\r\n  postman’s horn, newspapers, cap and livery._\r\n\r\n    Great news! here’s money lent on bond, rare news!\r\n    By honest, tender-hearted, christian jews!\r\n    Here are promotions, dividends, rewards,\r\n    A list of bankrupts, and of new made lords.\r\n    Here the debates at length are, for the week;\r\n    And here the deaf and dumb are taught to speak.\r\n    Here Hazard, Goodluck, Shergold, and a band\r\n    Of gen’rous gentlemen, whose hearts expand\r\n    With honour, rectitude, and public spirit,\r\n    Equal in high desert, with equal merit,\r\n    Divide their tickets into shares and quarters;\r\n    And here’s a servant-maid found hanging in her garters!\r\n    Here! here’s the fifty thousand, sold at ev’ry shop!\r\n    And here’s the “Newgate Calendar”--and drop.\r\n    Rare news! strange news! extraordinary news!\r\n    Who would not give three halfpence to peruse?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShergolds seem to have persisted in a course of attempts to evade the\r\nlaw, by a peculiar mode of dividing and insuring tickets; but in\r\nMichaelmas term, 1791, the question was argued in the court of\r\nKing’s-bench on a special verdict, whether the sellers of their receipts\r\nwere liable to be apprehended and committed as vagrants under the\r\nLottery act, and the court determined, that they were vagrants within\r\nthe true intent of the act.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURING.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1793, the commissioners of the Lottery, in order to abate\r\ninsuring, determined that no persons should be suffered to take down\r\nnumbers, except the clerks of licensed offices known to the\r\ncommissioners: no slips were to be sent out; but the numbers were to be\r\ntaken down by one clerk in one book; Steel’s list of lottery numbers was\r\nto be abolished, and a recompence made for it; and the magistrates\r\nresolved to apprehend all suspicious persons who should be seen taking\r\nearly numbers.[481]\r\n\r\nYet, in 1796, we find “a class of sharpers, who take Lottery\r\nInsurances,” and that this gambling, among the higher and middling\r\nranks, was carried on to an extent exceeding all credibility, producing\r\nconsequences to many private families, of great worth and\r\nrespectability, of the most distressing nature.--Mr. Colquhoun\r\nrepresents them as “a class, in general, of very depraved or distressed\r\ncharacters, who keep unlicensed insurance offices, during the drawing of\r\nthe English and Irish Lotteries;” many of whom, during the intervals of\r\nsuch lotteries, had recently invented and set up private lotteries, or\r\nwheels, called _little goes_, containing blanks and prizes, which were\r\ndrawn for the purpose of establishing a ground for insurance, and\r\nproducing incalculable mischiefs, inasmuch as the rage and mania were\r\nso rooted, from habit and a spirit of gaming, that no domestic pressure,\r\nand no consideration, connected either with the frauds that were\r\npractised, or the number of chances against them, would operate as a\r\ncheck upon the minds of the infatuated. The criminal agents felt no want\r\nof customers. The houses and offices were not only extremely numerous\r\nall over the metropolis, but in general high rented, exhibiting the\r\nappearance of considerable expense, and barricadoed in such a manner\r\nwith iron doors and other contrivances as, in many instances, to defy\r\nthe arm of the law. A considerable portion of their emoluments was\r\ntraced to have been derived from menial servants in general; but\r\nparticularly the male and female domestics in the houses of men of\r\nfashion and fortune, who were said, almost without a single exception,\r\nto be in the constant habit of insuring in the English and Irish\r\nLotteries.\r\n\r\nSuch persons, with a spirit of gambling rendered more ardent than\r\nprevails in common life, from the example of their superiors, and from\r\ntheir idle and dissipated habits, entered keenly into the Lottery\r\nbusiness; and when ill luck attended them were often led, step by step,\r\nto that point where they lost sight of moral principle, and were\r\nimpelled, by desire of regaining what they had lost, to sell or pawn the\r\nproperty of their masters, whenever it could be pilfered so as to elude\r\ndetection; and this species of peculation sometimes terminated in more\r\natrocious crimes.\r\n\r\nThe insurance offices in the metropolis exceeded four hundred in number.\r\nTo many of them persons were attached, called _Morocco Men_, who went\r\nfrom house to house among their customers, or attended in the back\r\nparlours of public-houses, where they were met by them to make\r\ninsurances.\r\n\r\nIt was calculated, that at these offices (exclusive of what was done at\r\nthe licensed offices) insurances were made to the extent of eight\r\nhundred thousand pounds, in premiums during the Irish Lottery, and above\r\none million during the English; upon which it was calculated that they\r\nmade from fifteen to twenty-five per cent. profit. This confederacy,\r\nduring the English Lottery of the year 1796, supported about 2000 agents\r\nand clerks, and nearly 7500 Morocco men, including a considerable number\r\nof _ruffians and bludgeon men_, paid by a general association of the\r\nprincipal proprietors of the establishments, who regularly met in\r\ncommittee, in a well-known public-house in Oxford-market, twice or\r\nthrice a week, during the drawing of the lottery, for the purpose of\r\nconcerting measures to defeat the exertions of the magistrates, by\r\nforcibly resisting or bribing the officers of justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lottery was declared to be inseparable from illegal insurances, by\r\nthe parliamentary reports of 1807; and they further state, that “the\r\nLottery is so radically vicious, that under no system of regulations\r\nwhich can be devised will it be possible for parliament to adopt it as\r\nan efficient source of revenue, and at the same time divest it of all\r\nthe evils and calamities of which it has hitherto been so baneful a\r\nsource.” Among these evils and calamities, the committees of parliament\r\nenumerate that “idleness, dissipation, and poverty, were increased,--the\r\nmost sacred and confidential trusts were betrayed--domestic comfort was\r\ndestroyed--madness was often created--suicide itself was produced--and\r\ncrimes subjecting the perpetrators of them to death were committed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE GOES.\r\n\r\nThese were _little_ Lotteries on the same plan as the great State\r\nLotteries, and drawn in the same manner. There were generally five or\r\nsix “little goes” in the year, and they were actually set up and\r\nconducted by two or three of the licensed lottery-office keepers. The\r\nState Lottery was the parent of these “little goes.” Persons who had not\r\npatience to wait till another State Lottery gambled during the vacations\r\nin a “little go.” A “little go” was never heard of during the State\r\nLotteries.[482]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT GO.\r\n\r\nSir Nathaniel Conant, who in 1816 was chief magistrate of the police\r\nestablishment at Bow-street, stated in that year to a committee of the\r\nhouse of commons, that the Lottery was one of the predisposing causes by\r\nwhich the people of the metropolis were vitiated; that it led to theft,\r\nto supply losses and disappointments, occasioned by speculating on its\r\nchances; and that illegal insurances continued to be effected:--“there\r\nare,” he says, “people in the back ground who having got 40, or\r\n50,000_l._ by that, employ people of the lowest order, and give them a\r\ncommission for what they bring; there is _a wheel within a wheel_.”\r\nAnother magistrate, giving evidence before the same committee, said, “it\r\nis a scandal to the government thus to excite people to practice the\r\nvice of gaming, for the purpose of drawing a revenue from their ruin: it\r\nis an anomalous proceeding by law to declare gambling infamous, to hunt\r\nout petty gamblers in their recesses, and cast them into prison, and by\r\nlaw also to set up the giant gambling of the State Lottery, and\r\nencourage persons to resort to it by the most captivating devices which\r\ningenuity, uncontrolled by moral rectitude, can invent.”[483]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIncredible efforts were made in the summer of 1826 to keep the “last\r\nlottery” on its legs. The price of tickets was arbitrarily raised, to\r\ninduce a belief that they were in great demand at the very moment when\r\ntheir sale was notoriously at a stand; and the lagging attention of the\r\npublic of the metropolis was endeavoured to be quickened, by all sorts\r\nof stratagems, to the 18th of July, as the very last chance that would\r\noccur in England of gaining “SIX 30,000_l._ besides other Capitals,”\r\nwhich it was positively affirmed were “all to be drawn” on that fatal\r\nday. Besides the dispersion of innumerable bills, and the aspersions on\r\ngovernment relative to the approaching extinction of the Lottery, the\r\nparties interested in its preservation caused London and its environs to\r\nbe paraded by the following\r\n\r\n_Procession._\r\n\r\n1. Three men in liveries, scarlet and gold.\r\n\r\n2. Six men bearing boards at their backs and on their breasts, with\r\ninscriptions in blue and gold, “All Lotteries end Tuesday next, six\r\n30,000_l._”\r\n\r\n3. Band of trumpets, clarionets, horns, &c.\r\n\r\n4. A large purple silk banner carried by six men, inscribed in large\r\ngold letters “All Lotteries end for ever on Tuesday next, six\r\n30,000_l._”\r\n\r\n5. A painted carriage, representing the Lottery wheel, drawn by two\r\ndappled grey horses, tandem fashion; the fore horse rode by a postillion\r\nin scarlet and gold, with a black velvet cap, and a boy seated in a\r\ndickey behind the machine, turning the handle and setting the wheel in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n6. Six men with other Lottery labels.\r\n\r\n7. A square Lottery carriage, surmounted by a gilt imperial crown; the\r\ncarriage covered by labels, with “All Lotteries end on Tuesday next;”\r\ndrawn by two horses, tandem, and a postillion.\r\n\r\n8. Six men with labels.\r\n\r\n9. Twelve men in blue and gold, with boards or poles with “Lotteries end\r\nfor ever on Tuesday next.”\r\n\r\n10. A large purple silk flag, with “all Lotteries end on Tuesday next.”\r\n\r\nThis procession with its music drew the heads of the servant maids from\r\nthe windows in every suburb of the metropolis, and was followed by\r\ntroops of boys, till they tired on its frequency. It sometimes stopped,\r\nand a man with a bell cried “O yes!” and “God save the king!” and,\r\nbetween the two, proclaimed, in set words, the “death of the Lottery on\r\nTuesday next!” The event was likewise announced as certain in all the\r\nnewspapers, and by cart-loads of bills showered down areas, and thrust\r\nunder knockers; when, behold, “the Lords of the Treasury were pleased to\r\norder” the final drawing to be postponed to Thursday the 18th of\r\nOctober; but all the good people so informed were wisely uninformed,\r\nthat this “order” was obtained by the lottery-office folks, to give them\r\na long day to get rid of their unsold tickets.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the streets were cavalcaded by men, whose bodies were\r\nconcealed between long boards on each side of their horses (as\r\nrepresented in the engraving on page 1407) to announce the _next_ “last\r\nof the Lottery on the 18th of October” aforesaid; and men on foot walked\r\nwith labels on their breasts and backs, with the same never-dying\r\nintelligence, according to the further figure in the engraving of the\r\nlottery wheel (on page 1439,) which cut, it may be here observed,\r\nrepresents one of the government wheels, and the sledge it was drawn\r\nupon from Somerset-house to Coopers’-hall, at the commencement of the\r\ndrawing of every Lottery; on which occasion there were four horses to\r\neach wheel, and about a dozen horse-guards to protect the instruments of\r\n_Miss_-Fortune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the most pageant-like machine was an octagon frame work, covered by\r\nprinted Lottery placards (as exhibited in the engraving on page 1405)\r\nwith a single horse, and a driver, and a guard-like seat at the back.\r\nWhen drawn along the streets, as it was at a most funereal pace, it\r\novertopped the sills of the first-floor windows. Its slow motion, and\r\nthe route it chiefly took, evidenced the _low_ hopes of the proprietors.\r\nSt. Giles’s and the purlieus of that neighbourhood seem to have been\r\nselected as the favoured spots from whence favours were mostly to be\r\nexpected. An opportunity offered to sketch it, while it was pelted with\r\nmud and stones, and torn and disfigured by the unappreciating offspring\r\nof the sons of fortune whose regards it courted. The artist’s letter\r\ndescribes the scene: “As I was walking up Holborn on Monday the 9th\r\ninstant, I saw a strange vehicle moving slowly on, and when I came up to\r\nit, found a machine, perhaps from twenty to thirty feet high, of an\r\noctagon shape, covered all over with Lottery papers of various colours.\r\nIt had a broad brass band round the bottom, and moved on a pivot; it had\r\na very _imposing_ effect. The driver and the horse seemed as dull as\r\nthough they were attending a solemn funeral, whilst the different\r\nshopkeepers came to the doors and laughed; some of the people passing\r\nand repassing read the bills that were pasted on it, as if they had\r\nnever read one before, others stationed themselves to look at it as long\r\nas it was in sight. It entered Monmouth-street, that den of filth and\r\nrags, where so great a number of young urchins gathered together in a\r\nfew minutes as to be astonishing. There being an empty chair behind, one\r\nof them seated himself in it, and rode backwards; another said, “let’s\r\nhave a stone through it,” and a third cried “let’s sludge it.” This was\r\nno sooner proposed than they threw stones, oyster shells, and dirt, and\r\nburst several of the sheets; this attack brought the driver from his\r\nseat, and he was obliged to walk by the side of his machine up this foul\r\nstreet, which his show canvassed, halting now and then to threaten the\r\nboys, who still followed and threw. I made a sketch, and left the\r\nscene. It was not an every-day occurrence, and I accompany it with these\r\nremarks.”\r\n\r\nThis was the fag-end of the last struggle of the speculators on public\r\ncredulity for popularity to their “last, dying Lottery.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last, on Wednesday the 18th of October, 1826, the State Lottery\r\nexpired, and its decease was announced in the newspapers of the next day\r\nby the following article:--\r\n\r\nSTATE LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon, at about half past six o’clock, that old servant of\r\nthe state, the Lottery, breathed its last, having for a long period of\r\nyears, ever since the days of queen Anne, contributed largely towards\r\nthe public revenue of the country. This event took place at\r\nCoopers’-hall, Basinghall-street; and such was the anxiety on the part\r\nof the public to witness the last drawing of the Lottery, that great\r\nnumbers of persons were attracted to the spot, independently of those\r\nwho had an interest in the proceedings. The gallery of Coopers’-hall was\r\ncrowded to excess long before the period fixed for the drawing, (five\r\no’clock,) and the utmost anxiety was felt by those who had shares in the\r\nLottery for the arrival of the appointed hour. The annihilation of\r\nLotteries, it will be recollected, was determined on in the session of\r\nparliament before last; and thus a source of revenue bringing into the\r\ntreasury the sums of 250,000_l._ and 300,000_l._ per annum will be dried\r\nup. This determination on the part of the legislature is hailed by far\r\nthe greatest portion of the public with joy, as it will put an end to a\r\nsystem which many believe to have fostered and encouraged the late\r\nspeculations, the effects of which have been and are still severely\r\nfelt. A deficiency in the public revenue to the extent of 250,000_l._\r\nannually, will, however, be the consequence of the annihilation of\r\nLotteries, and it must remain for those who have strenuously supported\r\nthe putting a stop to Lotteries to provide for the deficiency.\r\n\r\nAlthough that which ended yesterday was the last, if we are informed\r\ncorrectly, the lottery-office keepers have been left with a great number\r\nof tickets remaining on their hands--a pretty strong proof that the\r\npublic in general have now no relish for these schemes.\r\n\r\nThe concourse of persons in Basinghall-street was very great; indeed the\r\nstreet was almost impassable, and everybody seemed desirous of\r\nascertaining the fortunate numbers. In the gallery the greatest interest\r\nwas excited, as the various prizes were drawn from the wheel; and as\r\nsoon as a number-ticket was drawn from the number-wheel every one looked\r\nwith anxiety to his share, in order to ascertain if Fortune smiled on\r\nhim. Only one instance occurred where a prize was drawn and a number\r\nheld by any individual present. The fortunate person was a little man,\r\nwho, no sooner had learned that his number was a grand prize, then he\r\nbuttoned up his coat and coolly walked off without uttering a word. As\r\nthe drawing proceeded, disappointment began to succeed the hopes\r\nindulged by those who were present. On their entrance to the hall every\r\nface wore a cheerful appearance; but on the termination of the drawing\r\na strong contrast was exhibited, and the features of each were strongly\r\nmarked with dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe drawing commenced shortly after five o’clock, and ended at twenty\r\nminutes past six.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the various Lottery-offices were also surrounded by persons\r\nawaiting the issue of the drawing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOTTERY PUFFS.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to go into the _Literature of the Lottery_ without\r\noccupying more room than can be spared, but young readers and posterity\r\nmay be amused and surprised by some figures, from among many hundreds of\r\nwood-cuts on the bills of schemes, and invitations to buy.\r\n\r\n“T. BISH, 4 Cornhill, and 9 Charing-cross, London, and by all his agents\r\nin the country,” put forth the following.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~Kitchen Maid.~\r\n\r\n        Mistress Molly, the Cook,\r\n        At the Scheme only look,\r\n    In wealth we may both of us roll,\r\n        If we _brush_ for a Prize\r\n        In the world we may rise,\r\n    And our _skuttles_ have plenty of _cole._\r\n\r\n~Cook Maid.~\r\n\r\n        If what you say is true,\r\n        I am all in a _stew_,\r\n    Lest we miss what we so much desire;\r\n        Should we lose this good plan,\r\n        For _a sup in the pan_,\r\n    All the _fat_ will be soon _in the fire_!\r\n\r\nExcept the verses which were placed in the bill beneath the preceding\r\ncut, it contained nothing but an announcement of the day when the\r\nLottery was to draw, and the number of capital prizes, subjoined by this\r\ninformation, “Tickets and shares are selling by T. BISH;” who seems to\r\nhave imagined he could propitiate the “kitchen maid” and “cook maid” in\r\nhis behalf, as a lottery-office keeper, by exhibiting a tea-kettle and\r\nfire implements to personify the one, and certain culinary utensils to\r\npersonify the other.\r\n\r\n    “Delightful _cut_ to rear the tender mind”\r\n\r\nfrom the _basement_ to the _capital_ story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n      RUN, Neighbours, run, the LOTTERY’S expiring,\r\n    When FORTUNE’S merry wheel, it will never turn more;\r\n      She now supplies all _Numbers_, you’re desiring,\r\n    ALL PRIZES, NO BLANKS, and TWENTY THOUSANDS FOUR.\r\n\r\n      Haste, Neighbours, haste, the Chance will never come again,\r\n    When, without pain, for little _Cash_--you’ll all be rich;\r\n      Prizes a plenty of--and such a certain source of gain,\r\n    That young and old, and all the world, it must bewitch.\r\n                                Then run, neighbours, run, &c.\r\n\r\nThis versified address and the engraving are from another bill.

No\r\nBlanks!--ALL IN ONE DAY!” Yet if the words, adapted from a popular duet,\r\nwere regarded as an easy vehicle to effect that benevolent purpose,\r\nthey could only be so to those who, with the contractors, forgot, or\r\nperhaps, with them, did not know, that the original tells of\r\n\r\n    “a day of jubilee _cajolery_.”\r\n\r\nSurely this must have been a “word of fear” to all except the\r\ncontractors themselves, who alone would be the gainers by what the body\r\nof adventurers hazarded in the “grand scheme” of “_cajolery_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the bills of a former Lottery begins as follows:--\r\n\r\nBISH\r\n\r\n_The Last Man._\r\n\r\nIn reminding his best friends, the public, that the State Lottery will\r\nbe drawn this day, 3d May, Bish acquaints them that it is the _very last\r\nbut one_ that will ever take place in this kingdom, and he is THE LAST\r\nCONTRACTOR whose name will appear _singly_ before the public, as the\r\nvery last will be a coalition of all the usual contractors. Bish, being\r\n“_the last man_” who appears _singly_, has been particularly anxious to\r\nmake an excellent scheme, and flatters himself the one he has the honour\r\nto submit must meet universal approbation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the back of this bill are the following verses, derived from the\r\n“_cajolery_” duet:--\r\n\r\nTO-DAY!

Insurances were allowed upon the fate of numbers through\r\nprotracted drawings, and as the insurances could be effected for very\r\nsmall sums, those who could ill afford loss, imbibed a spirit for\r\ngambling, which the legislature very wisely most effectually prevented,\r\nby adopting, in the year 1809, the present improved mode of _deciding\r\nthe whole Lottery in one day_.\r\n\r\nAs it is at present conducted, the Lottery is a voluntary tax,\r\ncontributed to only by those who can afford it, and collected without\r\ntrouble or expense; one, by which many branches of the revenue are\r\nconsiderably aided, and by means of which hundreds of persons find\r\nemployment. The wisdom of those who at this time resign the income\r\nproduced by it, and add to the number of the unemployed, may, as I have\r\nobserved in a former address, surely be questioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt, whose ability, in matters of financial arrangement, few will\r\nquestion, and whose morality was proverbial, would not, I am bold to\r\nsay, have yielded to an outcry against a tax, the continuing of which\r\nwould have enabled him to let the labourer drink his humble beverage at\r\na reduced price, or the industrious artisan to pursue his occupation by\r\na cheaper light. But we live in other times--in the age of\r\nimprovement!--To stake patrimonial estates at hazard or écarte in the\r\npurlieus of St. James’s is _merely amusement_, but to purchase a ticket\r\nin the Lottery, by means of which a man may _gain_ an estate at a\r\ntrifling risk, is--immoral! nay, within a few hours of the time I write,\r\nwere not many of our nobility and senators, some of whom, I dare say,\r\nvoted against Lotteries, assembled betting thousand upon a _horse race_?\r\n\r\nIn saying so much, it may be thought that I am somewhat presumptuous, or\r\nthat I take a partial view of the case. It is, however, my honest\r\nopinion, abstracted from personal considerations, that the measure of\r\nabolishing Lotteries is an unwise one, and as such I give it to that\r\npublic, of whom I have been for many years the highly favoured servant,\r\nand for whose patronage, though Lotteries cease, my gratitude will ever\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nAs one of the last contractors, I have assisted in arranging a scheme,\r\n&c.! &c.!! &c.!!!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter this, perhaps, the reader may exclaim “I am satisfied!” and\r\ntherefore, as we have the assurance of Mr. Bish that there will “never\r\nbe another Lottery” to be lamented, the time has arrived for subjoining\r\nthe following\r\n\r\n  ~Epitaph.~\r\n\r\n  In Memory of\r\n  THE STATE LOTTERY,\r\n  the last of a long line\r\n  whose origin in England commenced\r\n  in the year 1569,[488]\r\n  which, after a series of tedious complaints,\r\n  _Expired_\r\n  on the\r\n  18th day of October, 1826.\r\n  During a period of 257 years, the family\r\n  flourished under the powerful protection\r\n  of the\r\n  British Parliament;\r\n  the minister of the day continuing to\r\n  give them his support for the improvement\r\n  of the revenue.\r\n  As they increased, it was found that their\r\n  continuance corrupted the morals,\r\n  and encouraged a spirit\r\n  of Speculation and Gambling among the\r\n  lower classes of the people;\r\n  thousands of whom fell victims to their\r\n  insinuating and tempting allurements.\r\n  Many philanthropic individuals\r\n  in the Senate,\r\n  at various times for a series of years,\r\n  pointed out their baneful influence\r\n  without effect,\r\n  His Majesty’s Ministers\r\n  still affording them their countenance\r\n  and protection.\r\n  The British Parliament\r\n  being at length convinced of their\r\n  mischievous tendency,\r\n  HIS MAJESTY GEORGE IV.,\r\n  on the 9th July, 1823,[489]\r\n  pronounced sentence of condemnation\r\n  on the whole race;\r\n  from which time they were almost\r\n  NEGLECTED BY THE BRITISH PUBLIC.\r\n  Very great efforts were made by the\r\n  Partisans and friends of the family to\r\n  excite\r\n  the public feeling in favour of the last\r\n  of the race, in vain:\r\n  It continued to linger out the few\r\n  remaining\r\n  moments of its existence without attention\r\n  or sympathy, and finally terminated\r\n  its career unregretted by any\r\n  virtuous mind.\r\n\r\n  W. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Interesting Addenda.~\r\n\r\nA few remarkable facts, which were omitted in the proper order of\r\nnarration, are now inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT LOTTERY.\r\n\r\nAbout 1612 king James I., “in special favour for the plantation of\r\nEnglish colonies in Virginia, granted a Lottery to be held at the west\r\nend of St. Paul’s; whereof one Thomas Sharplys, a taylor of London, had\r\nthe chief prize, which was four thousand crowns in fair plate.”[490]\r\n\r\n\r\nA DOUBLE MISTAKE.\r\n\r\nOld Baron d’Aguilar, the Islington miser, was requested by a relation to\r\npurchase a particular ticket, No. 14,068, in the Lottery to be drawn in\r\nthe year 1802, (but which was sold some few days before). The baron died\r\non the 16th of March following, and the number was the first-drawn\r\nticket on the 24th, and, as such, entitled to twenty thousand pounds.\r\nThe baron’s representatives, under these circumstances, therefore\r\npublished an advertisement, offering a reward of 1000_l._ to any person\r\nwho might have found the said ticket, and would deliver it up. Payment\r\nwas stopped. A wholesale linen-draper, in Cornhill, who had ordered his\r\nbroker to buy him ten tickets, which he deposited in his chest, on\r\ncopying the numbers, for the purpose of examining them, made a mistake\r\nof one figure, and called it 14,168 instead of 14,068, which was the\r\n20,000_l._ prize. The lottery being finished, he sent ten tickets to be\r\nexamined and marked. To his utter astonishment, he then found the error\r\nof the number copied on his paper. On his demanding payment at the\r\nlottery office, a caveat was entered by old d’Aguilar’s executors; but\r\nan explanation taking place, the 20,000_l._ was immediately paid him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER BARTHOLOMEW.\r\n\r\nThis person, who inherited a good fortune from his parents, was\r\nprosperous in his business, and had every prospect of success and\r\neminence in life, fell a victim to an unconquerable itch for gambling in\r\nthe Lottery. At one time, the White-conduit-house, with its tea-gardens\r\nand other premises, as also the Angel-inn, now the best tavern in\r\nIslington, were his freeholds: and he rented land to the amount of\r\n2000_l._ a year, in the neighbourhood of that place, and Holloway. He\r\nwas remarkable for having the greatest quantity of haystacks of any\r\ngrower in the neighbourhood of London. He kept his carriage and servants\r\nin livery, and was believed to have been worth 50,000_l._ He was not\r\nonly the proprietor, but the landlord of White-conduit-house, to which,\r\nby his taste in laying out its grounds, and the manner of conducting his\r\nbusiness, he attracted great custom. On one occasion, having been\r\nunusually successful in the Lottery, he gave a public breakfast at his\r\ntea-gardens, “to commemorate the smiles of Fortune,” as he so expressed\r\nhimself upon the tickets of admission at this _fête champêtre_.\r\n\r\nAt times he was very fortunate in the Lottery, and this tended to\r\nincrease the mania which hurried him to his ruin. He was known to have\r\nspent upwards of 2000 guineas in a day for insurance, to raise which,\r\nstack after stack of his immense crops of hay were cut down and hurried\r\nto market, as the readiest way to obtain the supplies for these\r\nextraordinary outgoings; and at last he was obliged to part with his\r\nfreehold, from accumulated difficulties and embarrassments, and he\r\npassed the remaining thirteen years of his life in great poverty,\r\nsubsisting by the charity of those who knew him in “better days,” and by\r\nthe paltry emolument he derived from serving as a juryman in the\r\nsheriff’s court for the county. His propensity to the Lottery, even\r\nunder these degrading difficulties, never forsook him. Meeting one day,\r\nin the year 1807, with an old acquaintance, he told him he had a strong\r\npresentiment, that if he could purchase a particular number in the\r\nensuing Lottery it would prove successful. His friend, after\r\nremonstrating with him on the impropriety of persevering in a practice\r\nthat had been already attended with such evil consequences, was at last\r\npersuaded to advance the money to purchase a sixteenth, and go halves\r\nwith him in the adventure. It was drawn a prize of 20,000_l._, and from\r\nthe proceeds from this extraordinary turn of fortune, he was prevailed\r\nupon to purchase an annuity of 60_l._ _per annum_. Totally addicted,\r\nhowever, to the pernicious habit of insurance, he disposed of his\r\nannuity, and lost every shilling of the money; yet such was the meanness\r\nof his mind and circumstances, that he frequently applied to persons who\r\nhad been served by him in his prosperity, for an old coat, or some other\r\narticle of cast apparel; and not many days before he died, he begged a\r\nfew shillings to purchase necessaries.\r\n\r\nBartholomew in intellect and manners was superior to the generality of\r\nmen, and at one time possessed the esteem of all who knew him. His fate\r\nmay be a warning to all ranks, particularly to those who are in trade,\r\nnot to engage in hazardous pursuits. He died in a two pair of stairs\r\nroom, in Angel-court, Windmill-street, in the Haymarket, in March, 1809,\r\naged 68.[491]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA correspondent refers to Rees’s Cyclopædia as containing a good account\r\nof Lotteries, with table of chances relative to their schemes; and he\r\nadds, that Dr. Kelly, the well-known calculator, assured him he had\r\nascertained that the chances of obtaining certain prizes were even more\r\nagainst the adventurer than would appear by those tables.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the tickets were publicly drawn in Guildhall, and the drawing was\r\nprotracted for several weeks, it was a curious sight for an indifferent\r\nspectator to go and behold the visages of the anxious crowd; to mark the\r\nhopes and the fears that seemed to agitate them, as their numbers or\r\nnumbers near to theirs were announced. It is a fact, that poor medical\r\npractitioners used constantly to attend in the hall, to be ready to let\r\nblood, in cases where the sudden proclaiming of the fate of tickets in\r\nthe hearing of the holders of them, was found to have an overpowering\r\neffect upon their spirits. The late Mr. Dalmahoy, of Ludgate-hill, was\r\naccustomed to affirm, that he owed his first establishment in a business\r\nwhich afterwards proved so prosperous, to the gratitude of a person, to\r\nwhose assistance, when a young man, he had stept in, upon one of those\r\ncritical emergencies.[492]\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF LOTTERIES.\r\n\r\nThe historian of “Inventions” says, that if, as some had done, he were\r\nto “reckon among the first traces of Lotteries every division of\r\nproperty made by lot, it might be said that Joshua partitioned the\r\npromised land into Lottery prizes before it was conquered.” In his\r\nopinion, the peculiarity of Lotteries consists in their numbers being\r\ndistributed gratuitously, or, as in public Lotteries, for a certain\r\nprice; it being left to chance to determine what numbers were to obtain\r\nthe prizes, the value of which had been previously settled. He speaks of\r\nthe “conditions and changes invented by ingenuity to entice people to\r\npurchase shares, and to conceal and increase the gain of the\r\nundertakers;” and, of the “delusion they occasion to credulous and\r\nignorant people, by exciting hopes that have little probability in their\r\nfavour.” He deems that the hint of modern Lottery was derived from the\r\nRomans. The rich persons at Rome, and particularly the emperors,\r\nendeavoured to attach the people by distributing among them presents\r\nconsisting of eatables and other expensive articles, which were named\r\n_congiaria_. Tokens, or tickets, called _tesseræ_ (in Greek συμζολα,)\r\nwere generally given out, and the possessors, on presenting them at the\r\nstore or magazine of the donor, received those things which they\r\nannounced. In many cases, these tickets were distributed to every person\r\nwho applied for them, and then these donations resembled our\r\ndistribution of bread, but not our Lotteries, in which chance must\r\ndetermine the number of those who were to participate in the number of\r\nthings distributed. In the course of time, the Roman populace was called\r\ntogether, and the articles distributed thrown to them from a stage. Such\r\nthings were called _missilia_, and belonged to those who had the good\r\nfortune to catch them; but as oil, wine, corn, and such like articles,\r\ncould not be distributed in this manner, and as other articles were\r\ninjured by the too great eagerness of the people, tokens or tickets were\r\nthrown in their stead. These were square pieces of wood or metal, and\r\nsometimes balls of wood, inscribed with the names of the articles. Those\r\nwho had obtained these _tesseræ_ were allowed to transfer or sell\r\nthem.[493]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder “Lottery,” an antiquary refers to the _pittacia_ of Petronius. The\r\nRomans issued gratis, to their visitors in the Saturnalia, tickets which\r\nwere all prizes, and marked with inscriptions called _apophoreta_. The\r\nLotteries of Augustus were mere bagatelles for sport; Nero’s were very\r\ncostly; those of Heliogabalus ridiculous; as, a ticket for six slaves,\r\nanother for six flies, &c. these were handed round in vases.[494]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImitations, on a reduced scale, of the Roman _congiaria_ have amused the\r\ncontinental princes and princesses of modern times. They distribute\r\nsmall presents to their courtiers, by causing trinkets or toys to be\r\nmarked with numbers; the numbers being written on separate tickets,\r\nwhich are rolled up and put into a small basket or basin.[495]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Italy, during the middle ages, the merchants or shop-keepers, in\r\norder to sell their wares more speedily and advantageously, converted\r\ntheir shops into offices of luck, where each person, for a small sum,\r\nwas allowed to draw a number from the jar of fortune, which entitled the\r\nholder to the article written upon it; but as these shop-keepers gained\r\nexcessive profits, and cheated the credulous people, by setting on their\r\nwares an extravagant price, which was concealed by the blanks, these\r\npractices were prohibited, or permitted only under strict inspection,\r\nand on paying a certain sum to the poor, or the sovereign.\r\n\r\nFrom hence was derived the modern Lottery of the continent, when\r\narticles of merchandise were no longer employed as prizes, but certain\r\nsums of money instead, the amount of which was determined by the amount\r\nof money received, after the expenses and gain of the conductors were\r\ndeducted. In these Lotteries, the tickets were publicly drawn by the\r\ncharity boys, blindfolded. As they could not be conducted without\r\ndefrauding the adventurers, it was at first believed, through\r\nold-fashioned conscientiousness, that it was unlawful to take advantage\r\nof the folly and credulity of the people, except for pious or charitable\r\npurposes. The gains were sometimes applied to the portioning of poor\r\nyoung women, the redemption of captives, or the formation of funds for\r\nthe indigent, and other benificent objects. It was vainly imagined, that\r\nthese public games of hazard would banish others still more dangerous;\r\nnor was it foreseen, that the exposure of tickets for sale, and their\r\ndivision into shares, would maintain and diffuse a spirit of gambling.\r\nThis, however, was the result, and the profit from Lotteries became so\r\ngreat, that princes and ministers were induced to employ them as\r\noperations of finance: the people were forbidden to purchase tickets in\r\nforeign Lotteries, and, in order that the tickets of the state might be\r\ndisposed of sooner, and with more certainty, many rulers were so\r\nshameless as to pay part of the salaries of their servants in tickets,\r\nand to compel guild companies and societies to expend in Lotteries what\r\nmoney they had saved. In 1764, this abuse was mentioned by the states of\r\nWirtemburg among the public grievances, and in 1770 the duke promised\r\nthat it should be abolished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo early as 1521, the council of Osnaburg, in Germany, established a\r\nLottery with wearing articles of merchandise for the prizes. In 1615,\r\nthe magistrates of Hamburgh sanctioned a Lottery for building a house\r\nof correction in that city. An engraving is mentioned with the following\r\ntitle, “Representation of the _Loto Publico_, which was drawn in the\r\nlarge hall of the council-house at Nuremburg, anno 1715.” This is\r\nsupposed to have been the first Lottery in that city. The first Lottery\r\nat Berlin was drawn in July, 1740; it contained 20,000 tickets at five\r\ndollars each; there were 4028 prizes; and the capital one was a house\r\nworth 24,000 dollars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1549, a Lottery was drawn at Amsterdam for the building a church\r\nsteeple; and another at Delft in 1595. In the hospital for old men, at\r\nAmsterdam, there is a beautiful painting by Daniel Vinckenbooms, which\r\nrepresents the drawing of a Lottery in the night time. He was born about\r\n1578, and died in 1629.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, whither the Lottery was introduced from Italy, it was set on\r\nfoot by merchants, and the only prizes were articles of merchandise:\r\nbut, in 1539, Francis I. endeavoured to turn them to his own advantage.\r\nHe permitted them under the inspection of certain members of the\r\ngovernment, with a view, as was pretended, of banishing deceptive and\r\npernicious games of chance; but on condition that he should receive for\r\nevery ticket a _teston de dix sols six deniers_. It appears, however,\r\nfrom a royal order of recommendation, in February, 1541, that this\r\nLottery was not then completed, and it is not known whether it ever was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1572 and 1588, Louis de Gonzague duc de Nivernois established a\r\nLottery at Paris, for the purpose of giving marriage portions to poor\r\nvirtuous young women on his estates. The prize tickets were inscribed\r\n_Dieu vous a élue_, or, _Dieu vous console_; the former insured to the\r\nyoung woman who drew it 500 francs on her wedding-day; the latter,\r\ninscribed on the blanks, suggested the hope of better fortune the year\r\nfollowing. No Lottery was ever drawn with so much ceremony and parade.\r\nPope Sextus V. promised those who promoted it the remission of their\r\nsins: and, before the drawing, which began every year on Palm Sunday,\r\nmass was said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLadies of quality were induced by this example to establish similar\r\nLotteries for the building or repairing of churches or convents, and\r\nother religious or benevolent purposes. Three ladies set on foot a\r\nLottery with tickets at 40 sous each, for redeeming persons who had\r\nfallen into slavery among the Turks. Some other ladies instituted a\r\nLottery in behalf of their confessor, who had been made a bishop, that\r\nthey might buy him a carriage and horses, with other requisites, to\r\nsupport his episcopal dignity.\r\n\r\nFrench history records the institution of many Lotteries as the means\r\nemployed to make valuable presents to ladies, and other persons of\r\ndistinction. It is supposed the largest of the kind was one designed by\r\ncardinal Mazarine, to increase his splendour and popularity among the\r\ncourtiers. The tickets were distributed as presents.[496]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLouis XIV., on the days which were not fast days, went to dine at Marly\r\nwith madame de Maintenon and other ladies. After dinner, the minister\r\nwho wished to converse with him arrived, and when his business was\r\nfinished, if they did not walk, he conversed, listened to music, played\r\nat cards, or helped to draw _Lotteries_, the tickets of which cost\r\nnothing, but were all prizes. They were composed of trinkets, jewels,\r\nand silks; but there were never any snuff-boxes, because he could not\r\nendure snuff, or suffer those who used it to approach him.[497]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century these games of chance grew into Lotteries, in\r\nthe proper sense of the word. During a scarcity of money which prevailed\r\nin 1644, Lawrence Tonti came from Naples to Paris, and proposed that\r\nkind of life-rents, or annuities, which are named after him _Tontines_;\r\nthough they were used in Italy long before his time. After tedious\r\ndisputes, his proposal was rejected; for which, in 1556, he substituted,\r\nwith the royal approbation, a large Lottery in order to raise funds for\r\nbuilding a stone bridge and an aqueduct. This Lottery was never\r\ncompleted, and consequently never drawn; and a wooden bridge was\r\nconstructed, instead of that which had been burnt. The first Lottery on\r\nthe plan of Tonti was set on foot at Paris in 1660, when the conclusion\r\nof peace, and the marriage of Louis XIV., were celebrated. It was drawn\r\npublicly, under the inspection of the police. The price of each ticket\r\nwas a Louis d’or, which at that time was only eleven livres; and the\r\nhighest prize was a hundred thousand livres. This was gained by the king\r\nhimself, but he would not receive it, and left it to the next Lottery,\r\nin which he had no ticket. In 1661, all private Lotteries were\r\nprohibited under severe penalties, and from that time there were no\r\nother Lotteries than the _Loteries royales_.[498]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ill-famed Italian or Genoese Lottery in Germany was, as its name\r\nshows, an invention of the Genoese, and arose from the mode in which the\r\nmembers of the senate were elected; for when that republic existed in a\r\nstate of freedom, the names of the eligible candidates were thrown into\r\na vessel called _seminario_, or, in modern times, into a wheel of\r\nfortune; and during the drawings of them it was customary for people to\r\nlay bets in regard to those who might be successful. That is to say, one\r\nchose the name of two or three _nobili_, for these only could be\r\nelected, and ventured upon them, according to pleasure, a piece of\r\nmoney; while, on the other hand, the opposite party, or the undertaker\r\nof the bank, who had the means of forming a pretty accurate conjecture\r\nin regard to names that would be drawn, doubled the stakes several\r\ntimes. Afterwards the state itself undertook the bank for these bets,\r\nwhich was attended with so much advantage; and the drawing of the names\r\nwas performed with great ceremony. The _venerabile_ was exposed, and\r\nhigh mass was celebrated, at which all the candidates were obliged to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA member of the senate, named Benedetto Gentile, is said to have first\r\nintroduced this Lottery, in the year 1620; and it is added, that the\r\nname of Gentile having never been drawn, the people took it into their\r\nheads that he, and his names, had been carried away by the devil. But at\r\nlength, the wheel being taken to pieces in order to be mended, the name,\r\nwhich by some accident had never been drawn was found concealed in it.\r\n\r\nThis mode of Lottery is presumed to have been peculiar to the Genoese,\r\nwho, for their own benefit established in many continental towns\r\ncommissioners, to dispose of tickets, and to pay the prizes to those who\r\nhad been fortunate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese pernicious Lotteries continued till the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when they were almost every where abolished and forbidden. To\r\nthe honour of the Hanoverian government, no _Lotto_ was ever introduced\r\ninto it, though many foreigners offered large sums for permission to\r\ncheat the people in this manner. Those who wish to see the prohibitions\r\nissued against the _Lotto_, after making a great part of the people\r\nlazy, indigent, and thievish, may find them in Schlozer’s\r\nStaats-Anzeigen,\r\n\r\n    Si son exécrable mémoire\r\n      Parvient à la postérité,\r\n    C’est que le crime, aussi bien que la gloire,\r\n      Conduit à l’immortalité.[499]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST LOTTERY IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nElia says, in the “New Monthly Magazine,”--“The true mental epicure\r\nalways purchased his ticket early, and postponed inquiry into its fate\r\nto the last possible moment, during the whole of which intervening\r\nperiod he had an imaginary twenty thousand locked up in his desk--and\r\nwas not this well worth all the money? Who would scruple to give twenty\r\npounds interest for even the ideal enjoyment of as many thousands during\r\ntwo or three months? ‘_Crede quod habes, et habes_,’ and the usufruct of\r\nsuch a capital is surely not dear at such a price. Some years ago, a\r\ngentleman in passing along Cheapside saw the figures 1069, of which\r\nnumber he was the sole proprietor, flaming on the window of a Lottery\r\noffice as a capital prize. Somewhat flurried by this discovery, not less\r\nwelcome than unexpected, he resolved to walk round St. Paul’s, that he\r\nmight consider in what way to communicate the happy tidings to his wife\r\nand family; out upon repassing the shop, he observed that the number was\r\naltered to 10,069; and, upon inquiry, had the mortification to learn\r\nthat his ticket was blank, and had only been stuck up in the window by a\r\nmistake of the clerk. This effectually calmed his agitation; but he\r\nalways speaks of himself as having once possessed twenty thousand\r\npounds, and maintains that his ten minutes’ walk round St. Paul’s was\r\nworth ten times the purchase-money of the ticket. A prize thus obtained\r\nhas moreover this special advantage;--it is beyond the reach of fate, it\r\ncannot be squandered, bankruptcy cannot lay siege to it, friends cannot\r\npull it down, nor enemies blow it up; it bears a charmed life, and none\r\nof woman-born can break its integrity, even by the dissipation of a\r\nsingle fraction. Show me the property in these perilous times that is\r\nequally compact and impregnable. We can no longer become enriched for a\r\nquarter of an hour; we can no longer succeed in such splendid failures;\r\nall our chances of making such a miss have vanished with the Last of the\r\nLotteries.\r\n\r\n“Life will now become a flat, prosaic routine of matter-of-fact; and\r\nsleep itself, erst so prolific of numerical configurations and\r\nmysterious stimulants to Lottery adventure, will be disfurnished of its\r\nfigures and figments. People will cease to harp upon the one lucky\r\nnumber suggested in a dream, and which forms the exception, while they\r\nare scrupulously silent upon the ten thousand falsified dreams which\r\nconstitute the rule. Morpheus will stifle Cocker with a handful of\r\npoppies, and our pillows will be no longer haunted by the book of\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n“And who, too, shall maintain the art and mystery of puffing in all its\r\npristine glory when the Lottery professors shall have abandoned its\r\ncultivation? They were the first, as they will assuredly be the last,\r\nwho fully developed the resources of that ingenious art; who cajoled and\r\ndecoyed the most suspicious and wary reader into a perusal of their\r\nadvertisements, by devices of endless variety and cunning; who baited\r\ntheir lurking schemes with midnight murders, ghost stories, crim-cons,\r\nbon-mots, balloons, dreadful catastrophes, and every diversity of joy\r\nand sorrow to catch newspaper-gudgeons.

It was a coloured discoid halo, consisting of six several\r\nconcentric circles; the nearest to the moon, or the first disk around\r\nher, being dull white, then followed circles of orange, violet, crimson,\r\ngreen, and vermillion; the latter, or outermost, subtending in its\r\ndiameter an angle of above ten degrees. This phenomenon was evidently\r\nproduced by a refraction in the white mist of a stratus, which prevailed\r\nthrough the night, but it varied in its colours, as well as in its\r\nbrilliancy, at different times.[500]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 43·00.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIMS AND ODDITIES.\r\n\r\nThe company of odd-looking personages playing at nine-pins in the hollow\r\nof the wild mountain, were not greater objects of wonder to Rip Van\r\nWinkle, than forty original designs by Mr. Hood will be to the reader\r\nwho looks for the first time at this gentleman’s “Whims and\r\nOddities.”[501]\r\n\r\nAll the world knows, or ought to know, that among persons called\r\nliterary there are a few peculiarly _littery_; who master an article\r\nthrough confusion of head and materials, and, having achieved the\r\nsetting of their thoughts and places “to rights,” celebrate the\r\nimportant victory by the triumph of a short repose. At such a minute,\r\nafter my last toilsome adventure in the “Lottery,” sitting in my little\r\nroom before the fire, and looking into it with the comfortable knowledge\r\nthat the large table behind me was “free from all incumbrances,” I\r\nyearned for a recreative dip into something new, when Mr. Hood’s volume,\r\nin a parcel bearing the superscription of a kind hand, was put into\r\nmine. It came in the very nick; and, as I amused myself, I resolved to\r\nbe thenceforth, and therefrom, as agreeable as possible to my readers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the title-page of Mr. Hood’s book is this motto, “O Cicero! Cicero!\r\nif to pun be a crime, ’tis a crime I have learned of thee: O Bias! Bias!\r\nif to pun be a crime, by thy example I was biassed!--_Scriblerus._”\r\n\r\nThe first engraving that opened on me was of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DREAM.]\r\n\r\nIn this figure, “a medley of human faces, wherein certain features\r\nbelong in common to different visages,--the eyebrow of one, for\r\ninstance, forming the mouth of another,”--Mr. Hood has successfully\r\n“tried to typify a common characteristic of dreams; namely, the\r\nentanglement of divers ideas, to the waking mind distinct or\r\nincongruous, but, by the confusion of sleep, inseparably ravelled up,\r\nand knotted into Gordian intricacies. For, as the equivocal feature, in\r\nthe emblem, belongs indifferently to either countenance, but is\r\nappropriated by the head that happens to be presently the object of\r\ncontemplation; so, in a dream, two separate notions will mutually\r\ninvolve some convertible incident, that becomes, by turns, a symptom of\r\nboth in general, or of either in particular. Thus are begotten the most\r\nextravagant associations of thoughts and images,--unnatural connections,\r\nlike those marriages of forbidden relationships, where mothers become\r\ncousins to their own sons or daughters, and quite as bewildering as such\r\ngenealogical embarrassments.”\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this kind of dream, the author relates a dismal\r\none, “which originated in the failure of his first and last attempt as a\r\ndramatic writer;” and another, wherein the preliminaries were pleasant,\r\nand the conclusion was whimsical. “It occurred,” says Mr. Hood, “when I\r\nwas on the eve of marriage; a season, when, if lovers sleep sparingly,\r\nthey dream profusely. A very brief slumber sufficed to carry me in the\r\nnight-coach to Bognor. It had been concerted, between Honoria and\r\nmyself, that we should pass the honeymoon at some such place upon the\r\ncoast. The purpose of my solitary journey was to procure an appropriate\r\ndwelling, and which, we had agreed, should be a little pleasant house,\r\nwith an indispensable look out upon the sea. I chose one, accordingly; a\r\npretty villa, with bow-windows, and a prospect delightfully marine. The\r\nocean murmur sounded incessantly from the beach. A decent, elderly body,\r\nin decayed sables, undertook, on her part, to promote the comforts of\r\nthe occupants by every suitable attention, and, as she assured me, at a\r\nvery reasonable rate. So far, the nocturnal faculty had served me truly.\r\nA day-dream could not have proceeded more orderly; but, alas, just here,\r\nwhen the dwelling was selected, the sea view secured, the rent agreed\r\nupon, when every thing was plausible, consistent, and rational, the\r\nincoherent fancy crept in and confounded all,--by marrying me to the old\r\nwoman of the house!”\r\n\r\nBecause it never happened that Mr. Hood in his dreams fancied himself\r\ndeprived of any sense, he was greatly puzzled by this question,--\r\n\r\n    “_How does a_ BLIND _man dream?_”\r\n\r\n“I mean” says Mr. H. “a person with the opaque crystal from his birth.\r\nHe is defective in that very faculty which, of all others, is most\r\nactive in those night-passages, thence emphatically called Visions. He\r\nhas had no acquaintance with external images; and has, therefore, none\r\nof those transparent pictures that, like the slides of a magic-lantern,\r\npass before the mind’s eye, and are projected by the inward spiritual\r\nlight upon the utter blank. His imagination must be like an imperfect\r\nkaleidoscope, totally unfurnished with those parti-coloured fragments,\r\nwhereof the complete instrument makes such interminable combinations. It\r\nis difficult to conceive such a man’s dream.\r\n\r\n“Is it, a still benighted wandering,--a pitch-dark night progress, made\r\nknown to him by the consciousness of the remaining senses? Is he still\r\npulled through the universal blank, by an invisible power, as it were,\r\nat the nether end of the string?--regaled, sometimes, with celestial\r\nvoluntaries, and unknown mysterious fragrances, answering to our more\r\nromantic flights; at other times, with homely voices, and more familiar\r\nodours; here, of rank smelling cheeses, there, of pungent pickles or\r\naromatic drugs, hinting his progress through a metropolitan street. Does\r\nhe over again enjoy the grateful roundness of those substantial\r\ndroppings from the invisible passenger,--palpable deposits of an\r\nabstract benevolence,--or, in his nightmares, suffer anew those painful\r\nconcussions and corporeal buffetings, from that (to him) obscure evil\r\nprinciple, the Parish Beadle?\r\n\r\n“This question I am happily enabled to resolve, through the information\r\nof the oldest of those blind Tobits that stand in fresco against\r\nBunhill-wall; the same who made that notable comparison, of scarlet, to\r\nthe sound of a trumpet. As I understood him, harmony, with the\r\ngravel-blind, is prismatic as well as chromatic. To use his own\r\nillustration, a wall-eyed man has a _palette_ in his ear as well as in\r\nhis mouth. Some stone-blinds, indeed, dull dogs without any _ear_ for\r\ncolour, profess to distinguish the different hues and shades by the\r\ntouch; but _that_, he said, was a slovenly, uncertain method, and in the\r\nchief article, of paintings, not allowed to be exercised.\r\n\r\n“On my expressing some natural surprise at the aptitude of his\r\ncelebrated comparison,--a miraculous close likening, to my mind, of the\r\nknown to the unknown,--he told me, the instance was nothing, for the\r\nleast discriminative among them could distinguish the scarlet colour of\r\nthe mail guards’ liveries, by the sound of their horns: but there were\r\nothers, so acute their faculty! that they could tell the very features\r\nand complexion of their relatives and familiars, by the mere tone of\r\ntheir voices. I was much gratified with this explanation; for I confess,\r\nhitherto, I was always extremely puzzled by that narrative in the\r\n‘Tatler,’ of a young gentleman’s behaviour after the operation of\r\ncouching, and especially at the wonderful promptness with which he\r\ndistinguished his father from his mother,--his mistress from her maid.\r\nBut it appears, that the blind are not so blind as they have been\r\nesteemed in the vulgar notion. What they cannot get one way they obtain\r\nin another: they, in fact, realize what the author of Hudibras has\r\nridiculed as a fiction, for they set up\r\n\r\n    ---------communities of senses,\r\n    To chop and change intelligences,\r\n    As Rosicrucian Virtuosis\r\n    Can _see with ears_--and hear with noses.”\r\n\r\nNever having tried opium, and therefore without experience of “such\r\nmagnificent visions” as are described by its eloquent historian, “I have\r\nnever,” says Mr. Hood, “been buried for ages under pyramids; and yet,\r\nmethinks, have suffered agonies as intense as _his_ could be, from the\r\ncommon-place inflictions. For example, a night spent in the counting of\r\ninterminable numbers,--an inquisitorial penance,--everlasting\r\ntedium,--the mind’s treadmill.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat “the _innocent_--sleep,” is an exceptionable position. What happy\r\nman, with a happy wife by his side, and the first, sweet, restless\r\nplague and pledge of their happiness by hers, has not been awakened to a\r\nsense of his felicity, by a weak, yet shrill and spirit-stirring “la-a,\r\nla-a, la-a, la-a, la-a-a, la-a-a--a,” of some secret sorrow, “for ever\r\ntelling, yet untold.”\r\n\r\n    Happy the man whose only care\r\n    A _few_ paternal _achings_ are.\r\n\r\nGentle reader of the Benedictine order! I presume not to anticipate the\r\npleasure thou wilt derive from contemplating thyself engaged in a\r\ndomestic exercise, suited to the occasion,--pacing thy bed-room at “the\r\nheavy middle of the night,” holding the _little_ “innocent”\r\n\r\n    Fondly lock’d in _duty’s_ arms;\r\n\r\nits dear eyes provokingly open to the light of the chamber-lantern;\r\nthine own closed by drowsiness, yet kept unsealed by affection; thy lips\r\narranged for the piano of carminative sounds--“quivering to the\r\nyoung-eyed cherubim”--\r\n\r\n    Oh! slumber my darling\r\n    Thy sire is a knight--\r\n\r\n--thy “darling” ceasing its “sweet voice,” to offer more decisively by\r\nits looks, “I would out-night you.” Brother Benedict! there is an\r\nengraving of thee, and thine, in the book I speak of, mottoed, “Son of\r\nthe sleepless!”\r\n\r\nLet me extract another _cut_, seemingly a portrait of the _alarming_\r\n“hope of the family,” after thou hast for some few years tried,\r\nperchance, “the _Locke_ system; which, after all,” according to Mr.\r\nHood, “is but a _canal_ system for raising the babe-mind to unnatural\r\nlevels”--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “My son, sir.”]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about the age of “My son, sir,” boys seek to satisfy their curiosity,\r\nand gratify their taste. It is the _spelling_-time of young experience,\r\nand they are extremely diligent. Their senses are fresh and undepraved,\r\nand covetous of the simplest pleasures.\r\n\r\nEvery town in England, and every village, with inhabitants and wealth\r\nsufficient to consume a hogshead of “brown moist” within a reasonable\r\ntime, exhibits an empty sugar cask in the open street; it is every\r\nlittle grocer’s pride, and every poor boy’s delight:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “O! there’s nothing half so sweet in life!”]\r\n\r\n“Gentle reader, read the motto! read the motto!” Look at the engraving;\r\n“_show_ it to your children, and to your children’s children,” and ask\r\nthem what they _think_. If you desire an immediate living example to\r\nillustrate professor Malthus’s principle, that “population always comes\r\nup to the mean of subsistence,” set out a sugar cask, and there will be\r\na swarm of boys about it, from no one knows whither, in ten minutes. The\r\nfirst takes possession of the inside, and is “monarch of all he\r\nsurveys.” Like the throne, it is an envied, and an unquiet possession.\r\nFrom the emulous, on all sides, he receives vain addresses and\r\nremonstrances, and against their threatening hands is obliged to keep a\r\nsharp look out; but his greatest enemy, and for whom he keeps a sharp\r\nlook _over_, is the grocer’s man. A glimpse of that arch-foe “frightens\r\nhim from his impropriety” in a twinkling; unless, indeed, from the\r\nnearness of the adversary he fail to escape, when, for certain, his\r\ncompanions leave him “alone in his glory,” and then he knows for a\r\ntruth, that “after sweet comes sour.” The boy there, straddling like the\r\n“Great Harry,” has had his wicked will of the barrel to satiety, and\r\ntherefore vacates his place in favour of him of the hat, on whose nether\r\nend “time hath written strange defeatures.” It is not so certain, that\r\nthe fine, fat, little fellow, with his hands on the edge of the tub,\r\nand the ends of his toes on the ground, will ascend the side, as that he\r\nwho stoops in front is enjoying the choicest pickings of the prize. The\r\nothers are mere common feeders, or gluttons, who go for quantity; _he_\r\nis the epicure of the party--\r\n\r\n    He seeks but little here below\r\n      But seeks that little _good_;\r\n\r\nand, of foretaste, he takes his place at the bung-hole, where the sugar\r\ncrystallizes, and there revels in particles of the finest candies. “I\r\npity the poor child,” says Mr. Hood, “that is learned in alpha beta, but\r\nignorant of top and taw”--and I pity every poor child who only knows\r\nthat a sugar tub is sweet, and is ignorant of the sweetest of its\r\nsweets. There are as many different pickings in it as there are _cuts_\r\nin a shoulder of mutton, or Mr. Hood’s book. My authority for this\r\ninformation is an acute, pale-faced, sickly, printer’s boy, an adapt in\r\nlickerish things, who declared the fact the morning after he had been to\r\nsee Mr. Mathews, by affirming, with enthusiasm, “I’ve tried it, I’ve\r\nanalyzed it, and I know it.”\r\n\r\n    “Ah! little think the gay, licentious proud,”\r\n\r\nwho spend their money on bulls-eyes and hard-bake, which are modern\r\ninventions, of the delicacies within a grocer’s plain, upright and\r\ndownright, good, old, natural, brown sugar tub--\r\n\r\n    “O! there’s nothing half so sweet in life.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hood introduces another “sweet pleasure,” with another equally apt\r\nquotation:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Tell me, my heart, can this be Love?”]\r\n\r\nThis figure of “THE POPULAR CUPID,” Mr. Hood copied, “by permission,\r\nfrom a lady’s Valentine;” and he says, “in the romantic mythology it is\r\nthe image of the divinity of Love.” He inquires, “Is this he, that, in\r\nthe mind’s eye of the poetess, drifts adown the Ganges--\r\n\r\n    Pillow’d in a lotus flow’r,\r\n      Gather’d in a summer hour,\r\n    Floats _he_ o’er the mountain wave,\r\n      Which would be a tall ship’s grave?\r\n\r\n--Does Belinda believe that such a substantial Sagittarius lies ambushed\r\nin her perilous blue eye?--I can believe in his dwelling alone in the\r\nheart--seeing that he must occupy it to repletion: in his\r\nconstancy--because he looks sedentary, and not apt to roam: that he is\r\ngiven to melt--from his great pinguitude: that he burneth with a\r\nflame--for so all fat burneth: and hath languishings--like other bodies\r\nof his tonnage: that he sighs--from his size. I dispute not his kneeling\r\nat ladies’ feet--since it is the posture of elephants--nor his promise,\r\nthat the homage shall remain eternal. I doubt not of his dying--being of\r\na corpulent habit, and a short neck: of his blindness--with that\r\ninflated pig’s cheek. But, for his lodging in Belinda’s blue eye, my\r\nwhole faith is heretic--for she hath never a _sty_ in it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hood, doubtless, desires that the world should know his “Whims and\r\nOddities” through his own work; its notice here, therefore, while it\r\naffords a winter evening’s half hour entertainment, is not to mar his\r\nhopes. But it is impossible to close its merry-making leaves without\r\nshadowing forth a little more of the volume.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be observed, that the prints just presented are from\r\nengravings in Mr. Hood’s book, of which there are forty drawn by his own\r\npencil; and, that he attaches a motto to each, so antithetical, as to\r\nconstitute the volume a pocket portfolio of designs to excite\r\nrisibility. For example:--\r\n\r\nHe tells a story of his “Aunt Shakerly,” a lady of enormous bulk, who\r\nplaced Mr. Hood’s baby cousin in the nursing-chair while she took in the\r\nnews, and then, in her eagerness to read the accidents and offences,\r\nunthinkingly sat, with the gravity of a coroner’s inquest, in the\r\naforesaid chair, and thereby unconsciously suppressed “an article of\r\nintelligence”--an occurrence which there is little reason to doubt\r\nappeared among the “horribles,” in the favourite department of her\r\npaper, the next morning. The engraving that pictures this is mottoed,\r\n“THE SPOILED CHILD!”\r\n\r\nMr. Hood institutes “A Complaint against Greatness,” through “an unhappy\r\ncandidate for the show at Sadler’s repository,” described in the\r\nfollowing item of the catalogue--“The reverend Mr. Farmer, a four years’\r\nold Durham ox, fed by himself, upon oil-cake and mangel-wurzel.” The\r\ncomplainant, however, says, “I resemble that worthy agricultural vicar\r\nonly in my fat living.”\r\n\r\nThis being the season when these condemned animals come up from the\r\ncountry to the metropolis, it seems a fit time to hear the complainant’s\r\ndescription of his journey. “Wearisome and painful was my pilgrim-like\r\nprogress to this place, by short and tremulous steppings--like the\r\ndigit’s march upon a dial. My owner, jealous of my fat, procured a\r\ncrippled drover, with a withered limb, for my conductor; but even _he_\r\nhurried me beyond my breath. The drawling hearse left me labouring\r\nbehind; the ponderous fly-waggon passed me like a bird upon the road, so\r\ntediously slow is my pace. It just sufficeth, oh, ye thrice happy\r\noysters! that have no locomotive faculty at all, to distinguish that I\r\nam not at rest. Wherever the grass grew by the way-side, how it tempted\r\nmy natural longings--the cool brook flowed at my very foot, but this\r\nshort, thick neck forbade me to eat or drink; nothing but my redundant\r\ndewlap is likely ever to graze on the ground!--If stalls and troughs\r\nwere not extant, I must perish. Nature has given to the elephant a long,\r\nflexible tube, or trunk, so that he can feed his mouth, as it were, by\r\nhis nose: but is man able to furnish me with such an implement? Or would\r\nhe not still withhold it, lest I should prefer the green herb, my\r\nnatural, delicious diet, and reject his rank, unsavoury\r\ncondiments?--What beast, with free will, but would repair to the sweet\r\nmeadow for its pasture”--\r\n\r\nVerily, it is humane thus to lecture man from the mouth of an animal,\r\nwhose species is annually deformed for butcherly pride, and the loathing\r\nof the table--“to see the prize-steak loaded with that rank, yellow\r\nabomination, might wean a man from carnivorous habits for ever.” The\r\nsupplicant for our compassion adds, in behalf of himself and his\r\ndumb-fellow creatures, “It may seem presumption in a brute to question\r\nthe human wisdom; but truly, I can perceive no beneficial ends worthy to\r\nbe set off against our sufferings. There must be, methinks, a nearer\r\n(and a better) way of augmenting the perquisites of the kitchen-wench\r\nand the fire-man.” There is an admirable cut of the over-fed petitioner,\r\nbreathing “O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt!” The figure of\r\nthe crippled drover is excellent.\r\n\r\nMr. Hood devises a romantic adventure that befel a herd of these animals\r\nof the common class, and a little wooden, white-painted house on four\r\nwheels, to which a sedentary citizen and his wife had retired to spend\r\ntheir days, “impaled” by the wayside on Hounslow-heath, where--\r\n\r\n    Having had some quarters of school breeding,\r\n    They turn’d themselves, like other folks, to reading;\r\n    But setting out where others nigh have done,\r\n        And being ripen’d in the seventh stage,\r\n            The childhood of old age,\r\n    Began as other children have begun,--\r\n    Not with the pastorals of Mr. Pope,\r\n            Or Bard of Hope,\r\n    Or Paley, ethical, or learned Porson,--\r\n    But spelt, on sabbaths, in St. Mark, or John,\r\n    And then relax’d themselves with Whittington,\r\n            Or Valentine and Orson--\r\n    But chiefly fairy tales they loved to con,\r\n    And being easily melted, in their dotage,\r\n            Slobber’d,--and kept\r\n            Reading,--and wept\r\n    Over the White Cat, in their wooden cottage.\r\n\r\n        Thus reading on--the longer\r\n    They read, of course, their childish faith grew stronger\r\n    In gnomes, and hags, and elves, and giant grim,--\r\n    If talking trees and birds reveal’d to him,\r\n    She saw the flight of fairyland’s fly-waggons,\r\n            And magic-fishes swim\r\n    In puddle ponds, and took old crows for dragons,--\r\n    Both were quite drunk from the enchanted flaggons;\r\n    When as it fell upon a summer’s day.\r\n        As the old man sat a feeding\r\n            On the old babe-reading,\r\n    Beside his open street-and-parlour door,\r\n            A hideous roar\r\n    Proclaim’d a drove of beasts was coming by the way.\r\n\r\n    Long-horned, and short, of many a different breed,\r\n    Tall, tawny brutes, from famous Lincoln-levels,\r\n            Or Durham feed;\r\n    With some of those unquiet, black, dwarf devils,\r\n            From nether side of Tweed,\r\n            Or Firth of Forth;\r\n    Looking half wild with joy to leave the North,--\r\n    With dusty hides, all mobbing on together,--\r\n    When,--whether from a fly’s malicious comment\r\n    Upon his tender flank, from which he shrank;\r\n            Or whether\r\n    Only in some enthusiastic moment,--\r\n    However, one brown monster, in a frisk,\r\n    Giving his tail a perpendicular whisk,\r\n    Kick’d out a passage thro’ the beastly rabble;\r\n    And after a pas seul,--or, if you will, a\r\n    Horn-pipe, before the basket-maker’s villa,\r\n            Leapt o’er the tiny pale,--\r\n    Back’d his beef-steaks against the wooden gable,\r\n    And thrust his brawny bell-rope of a tail\r\n            Right o’er the page,\r\n            Wherein the sage\r\n    Just then was spelling some romantic fable.\r\n\r\n    The old man, half a scholar, half a dunce,\r\n    Could not peruse, who could?--two tales at once;\r\n            And being huff’d\r\n    At what he knew was none of Riquet’s tuft;\r\n            Bang’d-to the door,\r\n    But most unluckily enclosed a morsel\r\n    Of the intruding tail, and all the tassel:--\r\n            The monster gave a roar,\r\n    And bolting off with speed, increased by pain,\r\n    The little house became a coach once more,\r\n    And, like Macheath, “took to the road” again!\r\n\r\nWhen this happened the old man’s wife was absent,\r\n\r\n    Getting up some household herbs for supper,\r\n    Thoughtful of Cinderella, in the tale,\r\n    And quaintly wondering _how_ magic shifts\r\n    Could o’er a common pumpkin so prevail,\r\n    To turn it to a coach;\r\n\r\nnor did she turn round, till house and spouse had turned a corner out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n             The change was quite amazing;\r\n    It made her senses stagger for a minute,\r\n    The riddle’s explication seem’d to harden;\r\n    But soon her superannuated _nous_\r\n    Explained the horrid mystery;--and raising\r\n    Her hand to heaven, with the cabbage in it,\r\n        On which she meant to sup,--\r\n    “Well! this _is_ fairy work! I’ll bet a farden,\r\n    Little prince Silverwings has ketch’d me up,\r\n    And set me down in some one else’s garden!”\r\n\r\nHere ends the “fairy tale” of Hounslow-heath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“She is far from the land!” is a motto to an engraving of a _land_ lady,\r\nfrightened by voyaging in a Thames wherry, opposite St. Paul’s. Her\r\nafter alarms at sea are concluded pleasantly:--\r\n\r\n“We were off Flamborough-head. A heavy swell, the consequence of some\r\nrecent storm to the eastward, was rolling right before the wind upon the\r\nland:--and, once under the shadow of the bluff promontory, we should\r\nlose all the advantage of a saving westerly breeze. Even the seamen\r\nlooked anxious: but the passengers, (save one,) were in despair. They\r\nwere, already, bones of contention, in their own misgivings, to the\r\nmyriads of cormorants and waterfowl inhabiting that stupendous cliff.\r\nMiss Oliver alone was sanguine. She was all nods, and becks, and\r\nwreathed smiles; her cheeriness increased in proportion with our\r\ndreariness. Even the dismal pitching of the vessel could not disturb her\r\nunseasonable levity;--it was like a lightening before death--but, at\r\nlength, the mystery was explained. She had springs of comfort that we\r\nknew not of. Not brandy, for that we shared in common; nor\r\nsupplications, for those we had all applied to; but her ears, being\r\njealously vigilant of whatever passed between the mariners, she had\r\noverheard from the captain,--and it had all the sound, to her, of a\r\ncomfortable promise,--that ‘if the wind held, we should certainly _go on\r\nshore_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe popular ballad of “Sally Brown and Ben the Carpenter,” which first\r\nappeared in the “London Magazine,” is inserted in this volume. “I have\r\nnever been vainer of any verses,” says Mr. Hood, “than of my part in the\r\nfollowing ballad. The lamented Emery, drest as Tom Tug, sang it at his\r\nlast mortal benefit at Covent-garden; and, ever since, it has been a\r\ngreat favourite with the watermen of the Thames, who time their oars to\r\nit, as the wherrymen of Venice time theirs to the lines of Tasso. With\r\nthe watermen, it went naturally to Vauxhall: and, over land, to\r\nSadler’s-wells. The guards, not the mail coach but the life guards,\r\npicked it out from a fluttering hundred of others, all going to one air,\r\nagainst the dead wall at Knightsbridge. Cheap printers of Shoe-lane and\r\nCow-cross, (all pirates!) disputed about the copyright, and published\r\ntheir own editions; and, in the mean time, the authors, to have made\r\nbread of their song, (it was poor old Homer’s hard ancient case!) must\r\nhave sung it about the streets. Such is the lot of literature! the\r\nprofits of ‘Sally Brown’ were divided by the ballad-mongers: it has\r\ncost, but has never brought me, a halfpenny.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA “Recipe for Civilisation,” in Hudibrastic lines, is waggishly\r\nascribed to the “pen of Dr. Kitchiner--as if, in the ingredients of\r\nversification, he had been assisted by his _Butler_.” It is accompanied\r\nby a whimsical whole length of “the Cook’s Oracle,” adjusting musical\r\nnotes on the bars of a gridiron, a ludicrous allusion to the\r\ngood-humoured Doctor’s diversified attainments in science and\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom an odd poem, attributed to an odd personage, “The Last Man,” two\r\nverses are selected, as an example of feelings which the punning on the\r\ntitle-page seemed to have proscribed:--\r\n\r\n    I’ve buried my babies one by one,\r\n    And dug the deep hole for Joan,\r\n    And cover’d the faces of kith and kin,\r\n    And felt the old church-yard stone\r\n    Go cold to my heart, full many a time,\r\n    But I never felt so lone.\r\n\r\n    For the lion and Adam were company,\r\n    And the tiger him beguiled;\r\n    But the simple kine are foes to my life,\r\n    And the household brutes are wild.\r\n    If the veriest cur would lick my hand\r\n    I could love it like a child!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Hood’s pen essays “WALTON REDIVIVUS: _A New River Eclogue_.”\r\n\r\n“[Piscator is fishing--near the sir Hugh Middleton’s Head, without\r\neither basket or can. Viator cometh up to him, with an angling-rod and a\r\nbottle.]”\r\n\r\nIt is prefaced by a citation “_From a Letter of C. Lamb_,” in these\r\nwords:--“My old New River has presented no extraordinary novelties\r\nlately. But there Hope sits, day after day, speculating on traditionary\r\ngudgeons. I think she hath taken the fisheries. I now know the reasons\r\nwhy our forefathers were denominated East and West Angles. Yet is there\r\nno lack of spawn, for I wash my hands in fishets that come through the\r\npump, every morning, thick as motelings--little things that perish\r\nuntimely, and never taste the brook.”\r\n\r\nTo face this “Eclogue” there is a motto, “My banks they are furnished,”\r\nbeneath a whole length figure, _so_ like “poor Jemmy Whittle!”--only not\r\nlooking so good natured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Love me, love my dog,” is a fearful _cut_--Mr. Hood’s step-mother, and\r\nher precious “Bijou”--with a story, and a tail-piece--“O list unto my\r\ntale of woe,”--unnaturally natural.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the best pieces in the volume is “The Irish Schoolmaster,” who,\r\nfrom a clay cabin, “the College of Kilreen,” hangs out a board, “with\r\npainted letters red as blood,” announcing “CHILDREN TAKEN IN TO BATE.”\r\n\r\n      Six babes he sways,--some little and some big,\r\n      Divided into classes six;--alsoe,\r\n      He keeps a parlour boarder of a pig,\r\n      That in the college fareth to and fro,\r\n      And picketh up the urchins’ crumbs below\r\n      And eke the learned rudiments they scan,\r\n      And thus his A, B, C doth wisely know,--\r\n      Hereafter to be shown in caravan,\r\n    And raise the wonderment of many a learned man.\r\n\r\n      Alsoe, he schools some tame familiar fowls,\r\n      Whereof, above his head, some two or three\r\n      Sit darkly squatting, like Minerva’s owls,\r\n      But on the branches of no living tree,\r\n      And overlook the learned family;\r\n      While, sometimes, Partlet, from her gloomy perch,\r\n      Drops feather on the nose of Dominie,\r\n      Meanwhile, with serious eye, he makes research\r\n    In leaves of that sour tree of knowledge--now a birch.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Now, by the creeping shadows of the moon,\r\n      The hour is come to lay aside their lore;\r\n      The cheerful pedagogue perceives it soon,\r\n      And cries, “Begone!” unto the imps,--and four\r\n      Snatch their two hats and struggle for the door,\r\n      Like ardent spirits vented from a cask,\r\n      All blythe and boisterous,--but leave two more,\r\n      With Reading made Uneasy for a task,\r\n    To weep, whilst all their mates in merry sunshine bask,\r\n\r\n      Like sportive elfins on the verdant sod,\r\n      With tender moss so sleekly overgrown,\r\n      That doth not hurt, but kiss, the sole unshod,\r\n      So soothely kind is Erin to her own!\r\n      And one, at hare and hound, plays all alone,--\r\n      For Phelim’s gone to tend his step-dame’s cow;\r\n      Ah! Phelim’s step-dame is a canker’d crone!\r\n      Whilst other twain play at an Irish row,\r\n    And, with shillelah small, break one another’s brow!\r\n\r\n      But careful Dominie, with ceaseless thrift,\r\n      Now changeth ferula for rural hoe;\r\n      But, first of all, with tender hand doth shift\r\n      His college gown, because of solar glow,\r\n      And hangs it on a bush to scare the crow:\r\n      Meanwhile, he plants in earth the dappled bean,\r\n      Or trains the young potatoes all a-row,\r\n      Or plucks the fragrant leek for pottage green,\r\n    With that crisp curly herb, call’d Kale in Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n      And so he wisely spends the fruitful hours,\r\n      Linked each to each by labours, like a bee;\r\n      Or rules in learning’s hall, or trims her bow’rs;--\r\n      Would there were many more such wights as he,\r\n      To sway each capital academie\r\n      Of Cam and Isis; for, alack! at each\r\n      There dwells, I wot, some dronish Dominie,\r\n      That does no garden work, nor yet doth teach,\r\n    But wears a floury head, and talks in flow’ry speech!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the entire of the subjects already extracted from, and for many\r\nothers not adverted to, even by name, reference should be had to the\r\nwork itself. There is one design, however, so excellent a specimen of\r\nMr. Hood’s clear conception and decisive execution, that merely in\r\nfurther illustration of his talent it is here introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Very deaf, indeed.”]\r\n\r\nAn engraving of Mr. Hood’s admirable “Parish Beadle,” from his “Progress\r\nof Cant,” was inserted in an account of that print on p. 130 of the\r\npresent volume of the _Every-Day Book_. Great as was the merit of that\r\nprint, in point of wit and humour, and curious as it will always be\r\nregarded for its multiform developement of character, and relationship\r\nto the manners of the age, yet it is largely exceeded, in these\r\nrespects, by the volume of “Whims and Oddities.” Possessing the rare\r\ntalent, of illustrating what he writes by his own drawings, Mr. Hood is\r\nto be esteemed in a twofold capacity. He has, withall, the remarkable\r\nmerit of having acquired his knowledge of art by his own teaching; and,\r\nwhat augurs well, the praise which the “Progress of Cant” deserved and\r\nobtained, has wholesomely invigorated him to higher mastery. There is a\r\nfirmness of execution in the designs to the “Whims and Oddities,”\r\nsurprisingly superior to the general manner of his meritorious etching\r\njust mentioned. The book is altogether the most original that the press\r\nof late years has produced; and, luckily, it comes like a seasonable\r\nvisiter, to raise shouts of laughter “round about the coal-fire” in cold\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n  [500] The varieties and causes of these phenomena are described in Dr.\r\n  Forster’s “Researches about Atmospheric Phenomena,” 3d edition, p. 98.\r\n\r\n  [501] “Whims and Oddities, in Prose and Verse; with forty original\r\n  designs by Thomas Hood, one of the authors of ‘Odes and Addresses to\r\n  Great People,’ and the designer of the Progress of Cant, London,\r\n  Relfe, 1826.” 12mo. 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 17.~\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH,\r\n\r\n_Bishop of Lincoln_.\r\n\r\nHis name is in the church of England calendar and almanacs on this day,\r\nwhich was ordained his festival by the Romish church, wherein he is\r\nhonoured as a saint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSt. Hugh was born in Burgundy in 1140, educated in a convent, took the\r\nhabit of the Chartreuse near Grenoble before he was of age, was ordained\r\npriest, and, at the end of ten years, the procuratorship of the\r\nmonastery was intrusted to him. Henry II. of England, confiding in his\r\nprudence and sanctity, induced him to come over and regulate the new\r\nmonastery of Carthusians, founded by the king at Witham in\r\nSomersetshire, which was the first of that order established in England.\r\nHe was consecrated bishop of Lincoln, 21st September, 1186, exerted his\r\nepiscopal authority to restore ecclesiastical discipline, especially\r\namongst his clergy, and maintained the claims of the church against the\r\ncrown itself. In quality of ambassador from king John, he went to France\r\nand negotiated a peace; on his return he was seized with a fever,\r\npresumed to have been occasioned by his abstemiousness, and died at\r\nLondon, on blessed ashes strewed on the floor, as he directed, in the\r\nform of a cross, on the 17th of November, 1200. His body was embalmed,\r\nand conveyed with great pomp to Lincoln, where it was met by king John\r\nof England and king William of Scotland, with three archbishops,\r\nfourteen bishops, above a hundred abbots, and a great number of earls\r\nand barons. The two kings put their shoulders under the bier as it was\r\ncarried into the church.\r\n\r\nAlban Butler, from whom these particulars are derived, affirms that\r\nthree paralytic persons, and some others, recovered their health at St.\r\nHugh’s tomb. He further relates, that, during the saint’s life time,\r\nHenry II., being on his way from Normandy to England, in a furious\r\nstorm, prayed for mercy, through the merits and intercession of St.\r\nHugh, whereon a calm ensued, and the voyage was made in safety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE UNTOMBED MARINERS.\r\n\r\n_An incident really witnessed in the Bay of Biscay._\r\n\r\n    The waves roll’d long and high\r\n      In the fathomless Biscay,\r\n    And the rising breeze swept sullen by,\r\n      And the day closed heavily.\r\n\r\n    Our ship was tight and brave,\r\n      Well trimm’d and sailing free,\r\n    And she flew along on the mountain wave,\r\n      An eagle of the sea.\r\n\r\n    The red cross fluttering yet,\r\n      We lower’d the noble sign,\r\n    For the bell had struck, it was past sunset,\r\n      And the moon began to shine.\r\n\r\n    Her light was fitful, flung\r\n      From a sky of angry gloom,\r\n    Thick hurrying clouds o’er the waters hung,\r\n      Their hue was of the tomb.\r\n\r\n    Yet now and then a gleam\r\n      Broke through of her silent ray,\r\n    And lit around with her soften’d beam\r\n      Some spot of that plumbless bay.\r\n\r\n    O’er the bulwark’s side we heard\r\n      The proud ship break the spray,\r\n    While her shrouds and sheets by the wild winds stirr’d,\r\n      Made music mournfully.\r\n\r\n    And we talk’d of battles past,\r\n      Of shipwreck, rock, and shore,\r\n    Of ports where peril or chance had cast\r\n      Our sail the wide world o’er.\r\n\r\n    The watch look’d by the lee,\r\n      A shapeless log was seen,\r\n    A helmless ship it appear’d to be,\r\n      And it lay the waves between.\r\n\r\n    Oh ’twas a fearful sight\r\n      That helpless thing to see,\r\n    Swimming mastless and lone at high midnight\r\n      A corps on the black, black sea!\r\n\r\n    There were souls, perchance, on board,\r\n      And heaving yet their breath,\r\n    Men whose cry, amid their despair, was heard\r\n      Not to meet ocean-death.\r\n\r\n    Our chief on deck up sprung,\r\n      We lay too in that hollow deep--\r\n    Below, as our voices and trampling rung,\r\n      The sleepers sprang from sleep.\r\n\r\n    The boat we loosed and lower’d,\r\n      There were gallant hearts to go,\r\n    The dark clouds broke that the moon embower’d,\r\n      And her lights shone cheering through.\r\n\r\n    And we watch’d that little boat\r\n      Pull up the mountain wave,\r\n    Then sink from view, like a name forgot,\r\n      Within an ancient grave.\r\n\r\n    They go--they climb the hull,\r\n      As the waters wash the deck,\r\n    They shout, and they hear but the billows dull\r\n      Strike on that lonely wreck.\r\n\r\n    The skeletons of men\r\n      Lay blanch’d and marrowless there,\r\n    But clothed in their living garb, as when\r\n      That ’reft ship was their care.\r\n\r\n    Lash’d to their planks they lay,\r\n      The ropes still round them tied,\r\n    Though drifted long leagues in that stormy bay,\r\n      Since they hoped, despaired, and died.\r\n\r\n    Tombless in their decay,\r\n      Mid the watery solitude,\r\n    Days dawn’d upon them and faded away,\r\n      Cold moons their death-sleep view’d.\r\n\r\n    Their names no trace may tell,\r\n      Nor whither their passage bound,\r\n    And our seamen leave the desolate hull\r\n      With death and darkness round.\r\n\r\n    They tread their deck again,\r\n      And silent hoist their boat--\r\n    They think of the fate of the unknown men\r\n      Who for years may wildly float.\r\n\r\n    Those bones, that ocean bier,\r\n      They well may sadly see,\r\n    For they feel that the gallant ship they steer,\r\n      _Their_ sepulchre may be.\r\n\r\n    There is grief for beauty’s woe,\r\n      Laurels strew the hero’s hearse--\r\n    Are there none will the generous tear bestow\r\n      For those untomb’d mariners![502]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 42·02.\r\n\r\n  [502] New Monthly Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 18.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of November, 1777, died William Bowyer, an eminent printer\r\nof London, where he was born on the 17th of December, 1699. He had been\r\nalways subject to a bilious colic, and for the last ten years of his\r\nlife was afflicted with the palsy; yet he retained a remarkable\r\ncheerfulness of disposition, and his faculties, though somewhat\r\nimpaired, enabled him to maintain the conversation of his literary\r\nfriends, pursue a course of incessant reading, which was his principal\r\namusement, and correct the learned works, especially the Greek books,\r\nprinted at his press. Within a few weeks before his death, he sunk under\r\nhis maladies and the progress of decay. His numerous critical writings\r\nafford ample evidence of his ability as a scholar; and as a learned\r\nprinter, he had no rival for more than half a century. Of his regard to\r\nreligion and morals, both in principle and practice, his whole life bore\r\nunquestionable evidence. His probity was inflexible. The promptitude\r\nwith which he relieved every species of distress, and his modesty in\r\nendeavouring to conceal his benefactions, marked the benevolence and\r\ndelicacy of his disposition. In the decline of life, and in his\r\ntestamentary arrangements, he seems to have been influenced by a regard\r\nto two great objects; one was to repay the benefactions which had been\r\nconferred on his father at a time when he peculiarly needed assistance,\r\nand the other was to be himself a benefactor to the meritorious in his\r\nown profession. By his will, after liberally providing for his only\r\nsurviving son, and allotting various private bequests, he appropriated\r\nseveral sums to “the benefit of printing,” particularly with a view to\r\nthe relief of aged printers, compositors or pressmen, and to the\r\nencouragement of the journeyman compositor, whom he particularly\r\ndescribes, and who is required to be capable of reading and construing\r\nLatin, and, at least, of reading Greek fluently with accents. These\r\nlatter bequests he committed to the direction and disposal of the\r\nmaster, wardens, and assistants of the Company of Stationers.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowyer was buried, agreeably to his own direction, at Low-Layton, in\r\nEssex, and a monument erected, at the expense of his friend, Mr.\r\nNichols, to his father’s memory and his own, with a Latin inscription\r\nwritten by himself. There is a bust of him in Stationers’-hall, with an\r\nEnglish inscription annexed, in his own words: and beside it are a\r\nportrait of his father, and another of his patron, Mr. Nelson, all\r\npresented to the Company by Mr. Nichols, who was his apprentice,\r\npartner, and successor; and who has done ample justice to his eminent\r\npredecessor’s memory, by an invaluable series of “Anecdotes” of Mr.\r\nBowyer, and many celebrated literary characters of the last and present\r\ncentury, whose persons or writings Mr. Nichols’s professional labours\r\nand varied erudition had acquainted him with.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·82.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn this day in 1703 died, in the Bastille at Paris, an unknown prisoner,\r\ncelebrated throughout Europe under the appellation of the _Man with the\r\nIron Mask_; he had been confined, for state reasons, from the year 1661.\r\nThere have been various disquisitions and controversies respecting his\r\nidentity, but a recent work seems to have rendered it probable, that he\r\nwas an Italian diplomatist who counteracted certain projects of Louis\r\nXIV., and was therefore condemned, by that monarch’s despotism, to\r\nperpetual imprisonment, in an iron mask, for the concealment of his\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASANT ILLUSTRATIONS--AND ADDITIONAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\nA correspondent is pleased to communicate a series of reminiscences\r\noccasioned by accounts in the first volume. They form two interesting\r\narticles, viz.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA I.\r\n\r\n_On Vol. I. of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    “Pages attend on books as well as lords.”\r\n\r\n  J. R. P.\r\n\r\nSir,--It is obvious, that he who reads the _Every-Day Book_ will think\r\nof things connected with the contents stated, and wish to append them as\r\nmemoranda, for the perusal of those interested in the resuscitations of\r\nold customs and matters of fact. With this impression, I have collected\r\nmy stray knowledge, and condensed it in the following compass. The\r\n_pages_ quoted, refer to the _first_ volume. _Ex. g._\r\n\r\n122. “Powerful Optical Illusion.” Approaching a lamp in the high road\r\nnear town, an object crossed my path; it appeared like a _large crab_,\r\nand, as I drew nearer, ran up the side of a house in the road-way with\r\ngreat velocity. When I reached the lamp, to my satisfaction, I proved\r\nthis appearance to have been caused by a full-sized _spider_, which had\r\npassed the light, and made upwards to its web. Had I not accounted for\r\nthis natural circumstance, I should certainly have considered it as a\r\nphenomenon worthy of anxiety.\r\n\r\n123. “The Spectre.” A young lady in Bedfordshire, on coming of age, was\r\npromised by her father a present of any thing she chose to accept at his\r\nhand. She said, A skeleton! Her choice was gratified--a skeleton was\r\nsent for from London, and placed in a case in a room accessible to her.\r\nThe room has ever since gone by the name of the “_Stranger’s Room_.”\r\n“Have you seen? or will you see, the stranger?” is the question put to\r\nall visitors. The daughter of Herodias seems to have scarcely exceeded\r\nthe eccentric taste of this young lady.\r\n\r\n136. “St. Agnes’ Eve.” After fasting the whole of the day, upon going to\r\nbed an egg must be filled with salt, and eaten, which occasions a great\r\nthirst. The vessel the female dreams of drinking from, according to\r\nsituation and circumstances, denotes who will be her husband.\r\n\r\nThis charm for the _ague_, on “St. Agnes’ Eve,” is customary to be said\r\nup the chimney, by the eldest female in the family--\r\n\r\n    “Tremble and go!\r\n      First day shiver and burn:\r\n    Tremble and quake!\r\n      Second day shiver and learn:\r\n    Tremble and die!\r\n      Third day never return.”\r\n\r\n179. “Bears” are seen on the Stock Exchange in human shape, natural ones\r\nare kept by friseurs to supply grease for the hair. The Black Bear in\r\nPiccadilly, Taylor’s Bear in Whitechapel, the White Bear, and the Bear\r\nand Ragged Staff, as a punster would say, are _bear-able_ enough; but, I\r\nreprehend the “Dancing Bears” being led through the streets to perform\r\nantics for money. Two have appeared this month. Each with two monkeys, a\r\ncamel, dromedary, and organ. Travellers have told of their sagacity; we\r\nbelieve them: but, that bears are made to stand upon hot iron, and\r\nundergo the severest discipline before they are fit for public\r\nexhibition, is a truth which harrows the feeling, and makes me wish the\r\ndancing bears unmuzzled, and let loose upon those who have the guidance\r\nof their education. The _ursa major_ of the literary hemisphere, Dr.\r\nJohnson, might have been a match for them.\r\n\r\n207. “St. Blase.” He seems to have neglected the protecting the\r\n“Woolcombers.” Since the introduction of machinery, by Arkwright and\r\nothers, very little cloth is manufactured by hand. The woolcomber’s\r\ngreasy and oily wooden horse, the hobby of his livelihood, with the long\r\nteeth and pair of cards, are rarely seen. When scribblers, carders,\r\nbillies, and spinning jennies, came into use, the wheel no longer turned\r\nat the cottage door, but a revolution among the working classes gave\r\noccasion for soldiers to protect the mills--time, however, has ended\r\nthis strife with wool, and begun another with cotton.\r\n\r\n246. “Pancake Day.” It is a _sine qua non_ at “_Tedbury Mop_,” before a\r\nmaid servant is wholly qualified for the farmer’s kitchen, that she make\r\napple fritters, and toss them without soot, or spoiling the batter.\r\n\r\n348. “Sadler’s Wells.” It closed this season (1826) with a real benefit\r\nfor Mrs. Fitzwilliam, October 2d. The new feature has been the\r\nhorse-racing, in the open air, represented as at Newmarket. Boards were\r\nerected on every side, to conceal the race from the public in general,\r\nand ensure novelty to the play-going folks in particular. To give\r\npublicity to this amusement, the high-mettled racers, with riders, flags\r\nand bugles, in proper costume, paraded the environs daily, and\r\ndistributed bills descriptive of cups, plate, bets, and other taking\r\narticles of jockeyship, which took place at evening. The thing did not\r\ntake so much money as wished.\r\n\r\n364. “St. Patrick’s Day” being my natal day, though not of Erin’s clime,\r\nI never fail dedicating a large _plum pudding_ to his _saintship_; round\r\nmy table the “olive branches” spread, and I make this record to\r\nencourage all persons to do the same, in remembrance of _their_ parent’s\r\nsolicitude, and the prospective harmony of the young.\r\n\r\n402. “Good Friday.” The bun so fashionable, called the _Sally Lunn_,\r\noriginated with a young woman of that name in Bath, about thirty years\r\nago. She first cried them, in a basket with a white cloth over it,\r\nmorning and evening. Dalmer, a respectable baker and musician, noticed\r\nher, bought her business, and made a song, and set it to music in behalf\r\nof “Sally Lunn.” This composition became the street favourite, barrows\r\nwere made to distribute the nice cakes, Dalmer profited thereby, and\r\nretired; and, to this day, the _Sally Lunn_ cake, not unlike the\r\nhotcross bun in flavour, claims preeminence in all the cities in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n422. “Lifting” is a custom practised with hurdles among shepherds, in\r\nthe South Downs, at their marriages. The bride and bridegroom are\r\ncarried round a flock of sheep; a fleece is put for their seat, and\r\nmay-horns, made of the rind of the sycamore tree, are played by boys and\r\ngirls. There is another sort of “lifting,” however; I have seen a\r\ntale-bearer in the village tossed in a blanket by the maids, as it is\r\nrepresented in “Don Giovanni in London,” a scene in the King’s Bench.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your’s sincerely,\r\n\r\n  JEHOIADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA II.\r\n\r\n_On Vol. I. of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\n    Franklin says, ‘farthings will amount to pounds:--\r\n    So _memorandums_ saved, will books produce.\r\n\r\n  J. R. P.\r\n\r\n~Videlicit.~\r\n\r\n507. “The Martin.” It is considered a presage of good, for this bird to\r\nbuild its nest in the corner of the bedroom-window; and particularly so,\r\nshould the first inhabitants return in the season. I know it to be true,\r\nthat a pair of martins built their nest in the curtains of a bed\r\nbelonging to Mrs. Overton, of Loverrall, Yorkshire. The nest was\r\nsuffered to remain unmolested, and access given to it from the air. Six\r\nsuccessive seasons the old birds revisited their chosen spot, brought\r\nforth their young, and enjoyed their peace, till the death of their most\r\nkind benefactress; when a distribution of the furniture taking place, it\r\ndislodged the tenants of the wing, which to each of them was not all\r\n_Mihi Beati Martini_--“My eye, Betty Martin.”\r\n\r\n570. “Milkmaids’ garland.” After I had sailed up the river Wye, and\r\narrived at Chepstow-castle, my attention was arrested by one of the\r\nprettiest processions I remember to have enjoyed. It consisted of\r\nmilkmaids dancing and serenading round an old man, whose few gray hairs\r\nwere crowned by a wreath of wild flowers; he held a blossomy hawthorn in\r\nhis right hand, and bore a staff, with cowslips and bluebells, in his\r\nleft. A cow’s horn hung across his shoulders, which he blew on arriving\r\nat a house. The youths and lasses were more than thirty in number. Their\r\narms, and heads and necks, were surrounded by clusters of lilies of the\r\nvalley, and wild roses. Then came an apple-cheeked dame with a\r\nlow-crowned, broad-brim hat; she wore spectacles, mittens were drawn up\r\nto her elbows, her waist trim, a woollen apron bound it, her petticoat\r\nshort, blue worsted stockings, a high-heeled pair of shoes with silver\r\nbuckles, and a broad tongue reposing on each instep. In one hand she\r\nheld a brass kettle, newly scoured, it was full of cream; in the other,\r\na basket of wood strawberries. To whoever came up to her with a saucer\r\nor basin, she gave a portion of her cream and fruit, with the trimmest\r\ncurtsey I ever saw made by a dainty milkwoman betwixt earth and sky. She\r\nwas “Aunt Nelly,” and her “Bough Bearer,” called “Uncle Ambrose,” was\r\nknown for singing a song, “’Twas on one moonshiny night,” which his\r\ndefective pronunciation lisped “meaun sheeiney.” Ambrose strummed an\r\ninstrument in his turn, partly harp, and partly hirdy-girdy. Six goats,\r\nharnessed in flowers, carried utensils in milking and butter making; and\r\nthe farmer of the party rode on a bull, also tastily dressed with the\r\nproduce of the fields and hedges. A cheese and a hatchet were suspended\r\nbehind him, and he looked proudly as he guided the docile animal to the\r\npublic-house, into which the milkmaids and their sweethearts went,\r\nquickened in their motions by the cat-gut, which made stirring sounds up\r\nstairs. The flowery flag was thrust upwardly into the street, facing the\r\niron bridge; and, getting again into the fisherman’s boat, I sailed and\r\nloitered down the banks of the river, charmed with what I had seen,\r\nfelt, and understood. Of the milkmaids, Miss Thomas of Landcote was the\r\ndarkest, the neatest, and the tallest--she stood _only_ five feet, ten\r\ninches high.\r\n\r\n692. “Kiss in the ring.” The ‘_kissing crust_’ is that part of the loaf\r\nwhich is slightly burnt, and parted from the next loaf: hungry children\r\nwho go home from the baker’s, know best what it is, by the sly bits they\r\nfilch from that part denominated the ‘kissing crust.’\r\n\r\n807. “Buy a Broom!” Since Bishop harmonised this popular cry, the\r\nFlemish girls cry ‘Buy a _brush_?’ but a greater novelty has arisen in\r\nsome of them singing glees, quartets, and quintets in the streets. The\r\ntune is unconcordant, slow, and grave; these warblers walk in a line\r\ndown the centre, with their hands crossed before their stomachs. Their\r\nsimple attitude, together with their sunny cast, and artless glance,\r\nrender them objects of pity; but the pence fall not so plentily to them\r\nas to the real John Bull, straightforward songs of the young weavers\r\nthat go about with the model of a loom in work, fixed to the top of a\r\nrod five feet high.\r\n\r\n839. “French pulpit.” The pulpit at Union Chapel, Islington, is made of\r\nbeautiful grained “Honduras mahogany;” and that of St. Pancras,\r\nNew-road, of the farfamed “Fairlop oak.”--Wesley and Whitefield were\r\ncontented to emerge in their first career from the hogsheads of a grocer\r\nin Moorfields.\r\n\r\n858. “Copenhagen-house.” This year, the Spanish and Italian refugees\r\nhave resorted to this house in great numbers, and played many famous\r\nmatches at ball. Nothing can be more retired than the garden formed into\r\nbowers for visiters--if the building mania should not recover, age will\r\ngive the young plantations beauty, pleasure, and effect. Two new roads\r\nare made near Copenhagen-house; the one, leading from Kentish-town to\r\nHolloway, the other, from the latter to Pentonville. At “the Belvidere”\r\nracket is much played, and archery practised at “White Conduit-house.”\r\nIt is gratifying that the labours of the _Every-Day Book_ are _not in\r\nvain_--the “Conduit” spoken of in vol. ii. col. 1203 has undergone\r\nrepair; it is hoped, it will be enclosed by the proprietors as one of\r\nthe new relics of venerable antiquity.\r\n\r\n1435. “Beadles.” The beadle of Camberwell is a lineal descendant of Earl\r\nWithrington, of the same name so celebrated in the battle of Chevy\r\nChase.\r\n\r\n  JEHOIADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·25.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 20.~\r\n\r\nEdmund. King and Martyr.[503]\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFENSIVE BARBERS.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November, 1746, fifty-one barbers were convicted before\r\nthe commissioners of excise, and fined in the penalty of twenty pounds\r\neach, for having in their custody hair-powder not made of starch,\r\ncontrary to act of parliament; and, on the 27th of the same month,\r\nforty-nine other barbers were convicted of the like offence, and fined\r\nin the same penalty.[504]\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN STATIONS AT PANCRAS AND PENTONVILLE.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--The following observations have been the result of a visit to the\r\nsite of the undoubted Roman camp at Pentonville, and the conjectural\r\nremains at St. Pancras. Respecting the former, I have been able to\r\nascertain, that in the course of the year 1825 a labourer, who was\r\noccupied in digging in the prætorium, turned up a considerable quantity\r\nof arrow heads; and shortly afterwards, another labourer, digging a few\r\nyards to the south of the same spot, for materials to mend a road,\r\nuncovered a pavement of red tiles, about sixteen feet square, each tile\r\nbeing about an inch and a half thick, and about six inches square; they\r\nwere mostly figured, and some had “strange characters upon them:”\r\nunfortunately, the discoverer had neither taste nor curiosity, and they\r\nwere consigned to the bottom of a deep road.[505] Respecting the “Brill”\r\n(at Pancras) I have examined the ground, and find that S. G. (p. 1347,)\r\nis incorrect in stating the prætorium was perfect, half of it having\r\nbeen converted into bricks some months ago; and the brickmakers inform\r\nme, that nothing was found, not even a tile or brass coin. I will\r\nextract a little respecting this camp from a work of some authority,\r\nviz. The Environs of London.\r\n\r\nMr. Lysons, in that work, treats the idea of a camp having been made\r\nnear this spot as quite conjectural,[506] and remarks, that Dr.\r\nStukely’s imagination, in the pursuit of a favourite hypothesis, would\r\nsometimes enable him to see more than other antiquaries; leaving the\r\nlanguage of conjecture, the Dr. points out the disposition of the\r\ntroops, and the station of each general’s tent, with as much confidence\r\nas if he had himself been in the camp. Here was Cæsar’s prætorium; here\r\nwas stationed Mandubrace, king of London;[507] here were the quarters\r\nof M. Crassus, the quæstor; here was Cominus; there the Gaulish princes,\r\n&c. &c. It is but justice to Dr. Stukely’s memory to mention, that this\r\naccount of Cæsar’s camp was not printed in his life-time. As he withheld\r\nit from the public, it is probable he was convinced that his imagination\r\nhad carried him too far, on this subject. Dr. S. remarks, that the\r\nvallum thrown up in the civil war was in the fields next the duke of\r\nBedford’s: he adds, that it was levelled after the Restoration, and that\r\nscarcely a trace of it was (when he wrote) visible, notwithstanding\r\nCæsar’s camp remained in so perfect a state after an interval of 1800\r\nyears. Mr. Lysons does not suppose, that the entrenchment at the _Brill_\r\nwas thrown up by the Londoners in 1642, since the name denotes something\r\nmore ancient;[508] but it certainly appears, by the diurnals published\r\nat the time, that entrenchments and ramparts were thrown up in the\r\nfields near Pancras-church, during the civil war. He thinks it not\r\nimprobable, that the moated areas, above-mentioned, near the church,\r\nwere the sites of the vicarage and rectory-house, which are mentioned in\r\na survey of the parish of Pancras _circa_ 1251.[509] This is certainly\r\nthe most probable conclusion, and far superior to the wild chimeras of\r\nthe learned doctor.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this slight, and, I am aware, imperfect view of the\r\nvarious opinions, for and against, by observing, that I resided in\r\nSomers-town and its neighbourhood for a considerable period; I carefully\r\nwatched every excavation made for sewers, foundations for houses,\r\nchapels, &c., but I never heard of any discoveries having been made. The\r\nplace lies too low to have even been frequented by the Romans, more\r\nespecially when the violence of the river of Wells is considered, which\r\nmust have descended from the hills like a torrent, and have flooded the\r\nwhole of the neighbourhood of Somers-town, Battle-bridge, &c.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n  T.

A splendid entertainment was provided at\r\nStationers’-hall, which was constantly preceded by a performance of\r\nvocal and instrumental music, by the most capital performers. This feast\r\nis represented by Mr. Motteux, in 1691, as “one of the genteelest in the\r\nworld; there are no formalities nor gatherings like as at others, and\r\nthe appearance there is splendid.” The words, which were always an\r\nencomium on their patroness, were set by Purcell, Blow, and others of\r\nthe greatest eminence; and it became the fashion for writers of all\r\nranks to celebrate saint Cecilia. Besides the odes to her by Dryden, and\r\nPope, Addison, and Yalden, employed their talents on this subject. We\r\nhave also odes to saint Cecilia by Shadwell, D’Urfey, and some still\r\nmore indifferent poets. It appears by Mr. Motteux, that there were in\r\n1691 “admirable concerts in Charles-street and York-buildings.”\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of St. Cecilia, in 1697, a sermon was preached at\r\nSt. Bride’s church by Dr. Brady, which he published under the title of\r\n“Church Music Vindicated.” The last account discovered by Mr. Nichols,\r\nof any entertainment to her memory at Stationers’-hall, is in Mr.\r\nHughes’s ode in 1703. The festivity appears to have been also celebrated\r\nat Oxford, and to have been continued there longer. There are two odes\r\nto St. Cecilia; one, in 1707, composed by Mr. Purcell, the other, in\r\n1708, by Dr. Blow, “both performed at St. Mary-hall, in Oxon, by Mr.\r\nSaunders and Mr. Court, assisted by the best voices and bands.” Mr.\r\nAddison’s ode was performed there in 1699; and he has “a song,” without\r\ndate, on the same occasion.[512]\r\n\r\n\r\nCECILIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nThe “Cecilian Society,” established in 1785 by a few individuals, has\r\ncontinued, to the present day, to meet once a week for rehearsal, and\r\nonce a fortnight for the public performance of vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic, chiefly sacred, by Handel, occasionally relieved by popular\r\nmodern composition.\r\n\r\nThis society has been the school of eminent composers and performers:\r\nsuch as Barthelomon, Everett, Purkis, Banner, Busby, Griffin, Russel,\r\nMiss Bolton, Jacobs, Miss Gray, and many others; among whom are the\r\nbrothers, the Mr. Nightingales, so highly esteemed in the musical world\r\nfor their professional talent, and irreproachable demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe venerable president, Mr. Z. Vincent, is one of the old school of\r\nharmonists, and a man of letters. His heart and soul are identified in\r\nHandel’s oratorios, and his judgment continues unimpaired. A Mr. Edwards\r\nis another instance of attachment to the society, he having been a\r\nmember upwards of twenty years. The great “unity” that has prevailed,\r\nand still prevails, in this society, is an example worthy of a niche in\r\nthe _Every-Day Book_. Their present performances are held at the “Albion\r\nHall,” Moorfields, and well attended by the issue of “tickets.” In\r\nhonour of this day, a grand miscellaneous concert is annually performed;\r\nmany celebrated professionals attend, and the lovers of harmony never\r\nfail of having a high treat.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of November the sun enters Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nAccording to an old magical MS. of the fourteenth century, an aspect of\r\n“Sagittary” seems to have dominion over dogs. “_When you wish to enter\r\nwhere there are dogs; that they may not hinder you_, make a tin image\r\nof a dog, whose head is erected towards his tail, under the first face\r\nof _Sagittary_, and say over it, ‘I bind all dogs by this image, that\r\nthey do not raise their heads or bark;’ and _enter where you\r\nplease_.”[513]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~“Ben”--“the Old General”--of Nottingham.~]\r\n\r\n    Commander of some forces there,\r\n    And intimate with Mr. Mayor.\r\n\r\n  *\r\n\r\nBenjamin Mayo is believed to be the proper name of the “General,” his\r\nother appellations he derived from having been the ringleader of the\r\nboys, from his youth to the present time, on all occasions for which\r\nthey assemble together in the town of Nottingham.\r\n\r\nIn order “to secure the boundaries of the town, a certain number of\r\nrespectable characters, annually appointed, form what is called the\r\n_Middleton_, _Mickleton_, or _Leet Jury_, and circumambulate them twice\r\na year, with the coroner at their head; it is also the duty of this jury\r\nto break down all obstructions in old roads, to fine those persons who\r\nmay have made such encroachments as do not immediately obstruct a public\r\nroad, and to present all nuisances at the quarter sessions.”[514] At the\r\nEaster and Michaelmas quarter sessions, the day for these duties is\r\nalways appointed to be the Monday se’nnight following; and hence it is\r\ncalled _Middleton Monday_. The name of “Middleton is said to be retained\r\nfrom lord Middleton,” who is steward of the Peveril Court, which has now\r\nno jurisdiction in Nottingham, it being a town-county. The origin of\r\nthese matters, however, is of little consequence in an account of the\r\n“General;” they are only referred to as preparatory to the observation,\r\nthat he is a conspicuous personage in the ceremonial of the day.\r\n\r\nOn “Middleton Monday” all the school-boys in the town expect a holyday;\r\nit is the _juvenile Saturnalia_; and though the “General” is great on\r\nall occasions, he is especially so on “Middleton Monday;” for compared\r\nwith him, the mayor, the coroner, and other municipal authorities, are\r\nsubordinate officers in the estimation of the youthful tribes.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the jury commencing their survey, away trots “General,” with\r\nseveral hundreds of boys at his heels, to secure the sacred and\r\ninviolable right of a holyday. Two or three urchins, with shining,\r\nmorning faces, lead the way to their own schoolmaster’s, who, in\r\nviolation of the “orders of the day,” is seated amidst the few children\r\nwhose parents have refused to grant a holyday, and therefore dare not\r\n“play _travant_.” Some “devoted Decius” in miniature, ventures in, on\r\nthe forlorn hope of procuring liberty for the rest. Down drop books,\r\npens, pencils, to the increasing cry of “Out, out, out.” The\r\ncommander-in-chief arrives, amidst the cheers of his enthusiastic and\r\ndevoted troops, takes up his position opposite to the door, and commands\r\nthe onset. The advanced guard assail the portal with redoubled blows of\r\ntheir pocket-handkerchiefs, and old rope-ends, knotted into _tommies_,\r\nand the main body throw the missile mud. Ere long, a random stone breaks\r\nsome window; this is speedily followed by a second and third crash; out\r\nsallies the master to seize the culprit, his sentinels are overpowered,\r\nthe invaders rush in, the besieged are unmercifully belaboured till the\r\ncapitulation is completed, but no sooner do they join the “liberating\r\narmy,” than a shout of triumph is raised, and the place is abandoned.\r\nThe aide-de-camps having reported to “the General,” what other\r\nfortresses hold out, the nearest is attacked in the same way. It often\r\nhappens, however, that a parley is demanded, and “the General”\r\nshamelessly receives a bribe to desist. Alas! that one so devoted to the\r\ncause of liberty should be so easily corrupted--twopence will induce the\r\ncommander-in-chief to withdraw, with his faithful followers, of fickle\r\nprinciple, and leave the anxious garrison to the uncontrolled power of\r\nits wily governor.\r\n\r\nUpwards of twenty years ago, opposition to “the General” was rare, but\r\nabout that period schoolmasters began to learn their strength. One\r\nindividual successfully resisted during a three hours’ siege; the house\r\nfor years bore marks of the mud with which it was pelted; but ever after\r\nhe was triumphant, though frequently at the expense of an oaken staff,\r\nor an ash sapling, broken in repulsing the invaders. After repeated\r\nassaults, “the General” deemed this “hold” impregnable, and desisted\r\nfrom his attacks.\r\n\r\nSo many of the disciples of learning being emancipated, or prisoners, as\r\n“the General” can liberate or capture, he sets forward with the\r\n“surveying council,” escorted by his army, to commence the perambulation\r\nof the town. If a projecting scraper endanger the shins of the\r\nburgesses, it is recorded, and the Middleton jury pass on; but the\r\njuvenile admirers of summary and instantaneous justice are for the\r\nimmediate removal of the offender. Perhaps the good old dame of the\r\nhouse “likes not these new regulations,” and takes up a strong position\r\nin its defence, armed with a mop and bucket of water. After a momentous\r\npause, a hardy champion rushes forward to seize the offensive iron, and\r\nwrench it from its seat; he retires, overwhelmed and half drowned; hero\r\nafter hero presses on, and is defeated; till some modern Ajax grapples\r\nwith the mop, and making a diversion in favour of the assailants, the\r\nluckless scraper is borne off in triumph.\r\n\r\nView “the General” at eleven o’clock, with his forces drawn up in front\r\nof the Castle lodge, demanding admittance into the Castle yard--a\r\nsummons always evaded by the distribution of a quantity of cakes and\r\ngingerbread. On “the General’s” word of command the precious sweets are\r\nthrown, one by one, over the gate, and the confusion of a universal\r\nscramble ensues. After the whole is distributed, the popularity of “the\r\nGeneral” rapidly wanes; hundreds are reduced to scores, and scores to\r\nones--at noon he is\r\n\r\n    Deserted in his utmost need\r\n    By those his former bounty fed.\r\n\r\nIn memory, however, of his departed greatness, he never deigns to work\r\nfor the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nBefore the approach of “Middleton Monday,” fifty times a day the\r\nimportant question is put to the General, “When will be _Middleton\r\nMonday_?” Once he said, “I don’t know yet, the mayor ha’n’t ax’d me what\r\nday’ll suit me.” On the following Saturday he answered, “The mayor sent\r\nhis respects to know if I’d let it be Middleton Monday next week; and I\r\nsent my respects, and I’d come.”\r\n\r\nBen Mayo has ever been “null, void, and of no effect,” except in his\r\ncharacter of “General.” He is a harmless idiot, who, during most of his\r\nlife, has been an inmate of St. Peter’s workhouse. He is now nearly\r\nfifty years of age. If erect, he would be under the middle size; his\r\nstature not being more than four feet nine inches. He is very\r\nround-shouldered. His eyes are dark grey, and rather lively; the lower\r\npart of his face is no way remarkable, but his forehead is very high,\r\nand singularly prominent in the middle; his head, which is thinly\r\ncovered with hair cut very short, always projected before him in his\r\nshuffling gait, which is rather a run than a walk. His vestment\r\ngenerally consists of the “hodden grey” uniform of the parish; his shirt\r\ncollar, like that of some other public characters, is usually\r\nunbuttoned, and displays his copper-coloured bosom. Grey stockings and\r\nquarter boots complete his equipment, for he never wears a hat. Though\r\ncoarse, his dress is generally clean and tidy.\r\n\r\n“The General” is constant in his attendance at church, where his\r\nbehaviour is serious; and he would on no account be seen about in the\r\nstreets on the Sabbath, for, being one of the public characters of the\r\ntown, it would be setting a bad example. In politics, he is a staunch\r\nsupporter of the powers that be; on such occasions as the king’s\r\nbirth-day, and the coronation, Ben is sure to be seen with a bunch of\r\nblue riband to his coat, while at an election, to display his loyalty,\r\nhe is dusted with power-blue from the crown of his head to the skirts.\r\nHe has, however, no objection to aid “the Jacobin corporation,” as far\r\nas in him lies; and, according to his own account, he is particularly\r\nintimate with the mayor for the time being, whom he allows to be the\r\nfirst man in the town--himself being second. He is remarkably fond of\r\npeace and with his wand in hand will “charge” it, where there is no fear\r\nof its being broken.\r\n\r\nLike other military men, “General” is a favourite with the ladies,\r\ninasmuch as he is known equally to high and low, and makes promises to\r\nall indiscriminately (who please him) that he will marry them “next\r\nSunday morning;” at the same time, he cautions the favoured fair not to\r\nbe later than half past seven, “for fear somebody else should get him.”\r\n\r\nThe “General’s” usual occupation is to sell the cheap commodities of the\r\nwalking stationers, such as dreadful shipwrecks, horrid murders,\r\ncalendars of the prisoners, last dying speeches and behaviours, or lists\r\nof the race horses. Sometimes, when the titles of these occur closely,\r\nhe makes curious “varieties of literature.” Not long since, he was\r\ncalling “A right and true calendar of all the running horses confined in\r\nhis majesty’s _gole_, owners’ names, horses’ names, and colours of the\r\nriders, tried, cast, ’quit, and condemned before my lord judge this\r\n’sizes, and how they came in every heat of the three days, with the\r\nsentences of the prisoners.”\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, at Lenton fair and wakes, which are always at\r\nWhitsuntide, and numerously attended from Nottingham, being only a mile\r\ndistant, some wag set “General” to proclaim the Lenton fair. On this\r\noccasion he mounted an enormous cocked hat of straw, and had his wand in\r\nhis hand. He jumbled together pigs, gingerbread, baa-lambs, cows, dolls,\r\nhorses, ale, fiddling, sheep, &c. in a confused mass; whilst the latter\r\npart of the proclamation, though perfectly true, was very far from being\r\n“quite correct.”\r\n\r\nOf the many anecdotes current of “General,” one or two authentic ones\r\nwill display the union of shrewdness and simplicity common to persons of\r\nhis order of intelligence. On a certain occasion, when public attention\r\nwas directed towards the commander-in-chief, one evening in the twilight\r\nBen began, “Here’s the grand and noble speech as the duke of York made\r\nyesterday.” A person, who had heard nothing of such a speech,\r\nimmediately purchased one, and on approaching a window found himself\r\npossessed of a piece of blank paper. “General,” said he, “here’s nothing\r\non it.” “No, sir, the duke of York said _nowt_.” Being set, at the\r\nworkhouse, to turn a wheel, he did so properly enough for about half an\r\nhour, but becoming tired, he immediately began to turn backwards, nor\r\ncould he be persuaded to the contrary. A blockhead once tried to make\r\nhim quarrel with an idiot lad, as they were employed in sweeping the\r\nstreet together; “Oh,” said he, “he is a poor soft lad, and beneath _my_\r\nnotice.” There is another instance of his dislike of work: having been\r\nset to weed part of the garden, he performed the task by pulling up all\r\nthe flowers and herbs, and leaving the weeds growing. He once found a\r\nsixpence, and ran up the street shouting, “Who’s lost sixpence, who’s\r\nlost sixpence?” “It’s mine, General,” said one. “But had your’s a hole\r\nin it?” “Yes,” said he--“But this hasn’t,” rejoined General, and away he\r\nran. His mode of running is remarkable, inasmuch as one leg is\r\nconsiderably shorter than the other, which gives his body an up-and-down\r\nmotion. One peculiarity is, that when he has any fresh papers to sell he\r\nwill never stop to take money till quite out of breath, and arrived at\r\nthe extremity of the town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDAVID LOVE, of whom there is an account in the present volume of the\r\n_Every-Day Book_, p. 226, is still in Nottingham.

CLEMENT.[515]\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nSir,--In your last year’s volume I see you have taken great notice of\r\nSt. Clement, and the customs observed on his day; but I do not see any\r\nmention of a custom which was common in _Worcestershire_, where I was\r\nborn. I am entirely ignorant of its origin; yet in my youth I have often\r\nbeen at its celebration. The custom was as follows:--\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of St. Clement’s day, a number of boys collected\r\ntogether in a body, and went from house to house; and at the door of\r\neach house, one, or sometimes more, would recite, or chaunt, the\r\nfollowing lines--\r\n\r\n    Catherine and Clement, be here, be here;\r\n    Some of your apples, and some of your beer\r\n    Some for Peter, and some for Paul,\r\n    And some for him that made us all.\r\n    Clement was a good old man,\r\n    For his sake give us some;\r\n    Not of the worst, but some of the best,\r\n    And God will send _your soul to rest_.\r\n\r\nSome would say,\r\n\r\n    And God will send _you a good night’s rest_\r\n\r\nSometimes grown men would go in like manner, and, to such, the people of\r\nthe house would give ale or cider; but to the boys they gave apples, or,\r\nif they had none to spare, a few halfpence. Having collected a good\r\nstore of apples, which they seldom failed to do, the boys repaired to\r\nsome one of their houses, where they roasted and ate the apples; and\r\nfrequently the old would join the young, and large vessels of ale or\r\ncider would be brought in, and some of the roasted apples thrown hot\r\ninto it, and the evening would then be spent with much mirth and\r\ninnocent amusement; such as, I sorrow to think, have departed never to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nSuch, sir, was one of the usages “in my youthful days,” in that part of\r\nthe country of which I have spoken. I have had but little intercourse\r\nwith it of late years, but I fear these _improved_ times have left but\r\nlittle spirit or opportunity for the observance of such ways, or the\r\nenjoyment of such felicity. Much has been said of improvement, and the\r\nhappy state of the present over times past; but, on striking the\r\nbalance, it may be found that the poor have lost much of their solid\r\ncomfort, for the little improvement they have obtained.\r\n\r\nYou, Mr. Editor, have exposed with a masterly hand the superstitions and\r\nmonkery of the olden time, for which you have my best thanks, in common,\r\nI believe, with those of nine out of every ten in the nation; but should\r\na Mr. HONE arise two hundred years hence, I think he would have\r\nsomething to say upon these _our_ times. I fear, however, I am going\r\nbeyond my object, which is not to find fault, but to acquaint you with a\r\npractice which, if worthy a place in your pleasant, instructive, and\r\nhighly useful work, I shall be glad to see there memorialed.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  SELITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·02.\r\n\r\n  [515] See vol. i. col. 1497.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 24.~\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECTRES AND APPARITIONS.\r\n\r\nIn a popular “calendar” there are some observations on this day, which,\r\nas the time for telling “Ghost stories” is come in, seem appropriate.\r\nThey are to the effect, that there is an essential difference between\r\n“Ocular Spectres” and “Spectral Illusions.”\r\n\r\n_Ocular Spectres_ move with the motion of the eye, whatever may be the\r\nforms of the spectrum on the retina; hence, they are spectra in the eye.\r\n\r\n_Spectral Illusions_, or _Ghosts_, seem to move with their own proper\r\nmotion, like real persons, and the objects in dreams; hence they are not\r\nin the eye itself or retina, but may arise in the brain.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of the particular laws whereby these forms are\r\nregulated, as they occur without the conscious precurrence of the usual\r\nchains of thought, and often represent forms, and combinations of forms,\r\nalmost entirely new to us. Some persons only see these spectres once or\r\ntwice in their lives, and that only during diseases: others are\r\ncontinually harassed by them, and often mistake some one consistent\r\nspectre, which frequently comes and converses with them, for their\r\nguardian angel. In proportion, however, as the phantom gains on the\r\ncredulity of the patient who beholds it, the latter approximates towards\r\ninsanity. According to the disturbance of the brain of the individuals,\r\nthe spectres are either horrifying or delightful, and partake of the\r\ncharacter of the patient’s mind, as it is influenced variously by\r\ndesire, fear, hope, and so on. We have known instances where the\r\nantiphlogistic measures resorted to with success, have been viewed by\r\nthe patient, when recovered, as positive evils, having forcibly torn\r\nfrom him some perpetual and pleasing illusion.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. John Wheeler, prebendary of Westminster, used to relate a\r\nremarkable story of the Abbé Pilori at Florence, who incurred a\r\ntremendous spectral disorder in consequence of a surfeit of mushrooms he\r\none day ate. These fungi, not digesting, disturbed his brain, and he saw\r\nthe frightful and appalling forms of scorpions continually before his\r\neyes for a length of time.\r\n\r\nThis brings to our minds yet another observation with regard to spectra.\r\nPersons who are somewhat delirious from fever are apt to give to\r\nhalf-distinguished forms, in a darkish chamber, the most frightful\r\nimaginary shapes. This is a disorder distinct from that of seeing\r\nphantoms. A. Y.

The\r\nfollowing passage seems to allude to the wintry garb of nature:--“The\r\nearth mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed and withereth away;\r\nSharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their\r\nfruits.”--Isaiah, xxiii. 9.\r\n\r\nSoon shall we be compelled to exclaim with the poet, in reference to\r\nthis, generally speaking, gloomy season,\r\n\r\n    That time of year thou mayest in me behold,\r\n    When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang\r\n    On those wild boughs which shake against the cold,\r\n    Bare ruined quires, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\n\r\nNovember, however, has its bright as well as its dark side. “It is now,”\r\nobserves a pleasing writer, “that the labourer is about to enjoy a\r\ntemporary mitigation of the season’s toil. His little store of winter\r\nprovision having been hardly earned and safely lodged, his countenance\r\nbrightens, and his heart warms, with the anticipation of winter\r\ncomforts. As the day shortens and the hours of darkness increase, the\r\ndomestic affections are awakened anew by a closer and more lengthened\r\nconverse; the father is now once more in the midst of his family; the\r\nchild is now once more on the knee of its parent; and she, in whose\r\ncomfort his heart is principally interested, is again permitted, by the\r\nprivileges of the season, to increase and to participate his happiness.\r\nIt is now that the husbandman is repaid for his former risk and\r\nanxiety--that, having waited patiently for the coming harvest, he builds\r\nup his sheaves, loads his waggons, and replenishes his barns.” It is now\r\nthat men of study and literary pursuit are admonished of the best season\r\nsuited for the pursuits of literature; and the snug fireside in an armed\r\nchair, during a long winter’s evening, with an entertaining book, is a\r\npleasure by no means to be despised. There is something, too, very\r\npleasing in the festivals which are now approaching, and which preserve\r\nthe recollection of olden time.[517]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 41·52.\r\n\r\n  [517] Dr. Forster’s Perennial Calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~November 27.~\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL DEATH DAY.\r\n\r\nThe chapter of an old, black-letter book of wonderful things concludes\r\nwith the following amusing paragraph:--\r\n\r\n“Here may we also speak of the people, Lucumoria, dwelling among the\r\nhilles, beyond the river Olbis.

Several capital prizes are made, the\r\nprincipal of which is Fonthill Abbey, valued at 5_l._ There are others\r\nless valuable, Islington church, Cannonbury Tower, the Queen’s Head, Sir\r\nWilliam Curtis’s villa, at Southgate,--the house in which Garrick was\r\nborn,--many Italian buildings, and a variety to the number of 500. Each\r\nadventurer, by paying three shillings, draws a share which is equal, in\r\nthe worst chance, to the deposit. The scheme is contrived by an\r\ningenious artist and his wife, whose names are Golding. Previously to\r\nthe drawing-day, three days are allowed for friendly inspection. It is\r\nlaudable to see this Model Lottery patronised by the most respectable\r\nladies and gentlemen in the vicinity where it takes place. This is the\r\nsecond year of its existence.\r\n\r\nP.S.

In whose possession it now is? It is believed\r\nthe circumstance, if true, is not generally known in the neighbourhood.\r\n_Query_, the name of the Carpenter?\r\n\r\nThe idea of a subterraneous passage from Bradenstoke Priory to Malmsbury\r\nAbbey, a distance of eight or ten miles, intersected by a deep valley,\r\nthrough which the Avon meanders, is absurd, and can only be conceived as\r\none of the wild traditions derived from monkish times.\r\n\r\nCan your correspondent furnish further particulars of the horrible story\r\nof the boy murdered by his schoolmaster, when and whom?\r\n\r\nHis account of “Joe Ody’s” exploits may be very correct. He is well\r\nremembered by the elder peasantry.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed, your correspondent meant to say, that the song was\r\nattributed to _Bowles_ of _Bremhill_, not _Brinkworth_. The Rev. W. L.\r\nBowles is rector, or vicar, of Bremhill, about five or six miles from\r\nClack Brinkworth, about the same distance in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nYour correspondent might have noticed the mound called _Clack Mount_.\r\nPerhaps he will favour you with further recollections of the localities\r\nof Clack, and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe remains of a _may-pole_ are visible at Clack; but the pole itself is\r\nbelieved not to be remembered by any person now living, or, if\r\nremembered, by very old persons only.\r\n\r\n  A READER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECEMBER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    While I have a home, and can do as I will,\r\n    December may rage over ocean and hill,\r\n    And batter my door--as he does once a year--\r\n    I laugh at his storming, and give him good cheer.\r\n                                                  Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    I’ve a trencher and cup, and something to ask\r\n    A friend to sit down to--and then a good flask:\r\n    The best of all methods, to make Winter smile,\r\n    Is living as I do--in old English style.\r\n                                                  Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\nNow--whoever regards a comfortable fire, in an old-fashioned cottage, as\r\na pleasant sight, will be pleased by this sketch, as a cheerful\r\nillustration of the dreary season; nor may it be deemed too intrusive,\r\nperhaps, to mention, that the artist who drew and engraved it, is Mr.\r\nSAMUEL WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nIn this, the last, month of the year “the beautiful Spring is almost\r\nforgotten in the anticipation of that which is to come. The bright\r\nSummer is no more thought of, than is the glow of the morning sunshine\r\nat night-fall. The rich Autumn only just lingers on the memory, as the\r\nlast red rays of its evenings do when they have but just quitted the\r\neye. And Winter is once more closing its cloud-canopy over all things,\r\nand breathing forth that sleep-compelling breath which is to wrap all in\r\na temporary oblivion, no less essential to their healthful existence\r\nthan is the active vitality which it for a while supersedes.” Yet among\r\nthe general appearances of nature there are still many lively spots and\r\ncheering aspects. “The furze flings out its bright yellow flowers upon\r\nthe otherwise bare common, like little gleams of sunshine; and the moles\r\nply their mischievous night-work in the dry meadows; and the green\r\nplover ‘whistles o’er the lea;’ and the snipes haunt the marshy grounds;\r\nand the wagtails twinkle about near the spring-heads; and the larks get\r\ntogether in companies, and talk to each other, instead of singing to\r\nthemselves; and the thrush occasionally puts forth a plaintive note, as\r\nif half afraid of the sound of his own voice; and the hedge-sparrow and\r\ntitmouse try to sing; and the robin does sing still, even more\r\ndelightfully than he has done during all the rest of the year, because\r\nit now seems as if he sang for us rather than for himself--or rather to\r\nus, for it is still for his supper that he sings, and therefore for\r\nhimself.”[519]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Poetical Calendar” offers a little poem with some lines descriptive\r\nof the month, which are pleasant to read within doors, while “rude\r\nBoreas” is blustering without:--\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n    Last of the months, severest of them all,\r\n    Woe to the regions where thy terrors fall!\r\n    For lo! the fiery horses of the sun\r\n    Thro’ the twelve signs their rapid course have run,\r\n    Time, like a serpent, bites his forked tail,\r\n    And Winter on a goat bestrides the gale;\r\n    Rough blows the north wind near Arcturus’ star,\r\n    And sweeps, unrein’d, across the polar bar,\r\n    On the world’s confines where the sea bears prowl,\r\n    And Greenland whales, like moving islands, roll:\r\n    There, on a sledge, the rein-deer drives the swain\r\n    To meet his mistress on the frost-bound plain.\r\n    Have mercy, Winter!--for we own thy power,\r\n    Thy flooding deluge, and thy drenching shower;\r\n    Yes--we acknowledge what thy prowess can,\r\n    But oh! have pity on the toil of man!\r\n    And, tho’ the floods thy adamantine chain\r\n    Submissive wear--yet spare the treasur’d grain:\r\n    The peasants to thy mercy now resign\r\n    The infant seed--their hope, and future mine.\r\n    Not always Phœbus bends his vengeful bow,\r\n    Oft in mid winter placid breezes blow;\r\n    Oft tinctur’d with the bluest transmarine\r\n    The fretted canopy of heaven is seen;\r\n    Girded with argent lamps, the full-orb’d moon\r\n    In mild December emulates the noon;\r\n    Tho’ short the respite, if the sapphire blue\r\n    Stain the bright lustre with an inky hue;\r\n    Then a black wreck of clouds is seen to fly,\r\n    In broken shatters, thro’ the frighted sky:\r\n    But if fleet Eurus scour the vaulted plain,\r\n    Then all the stars propitious shine again.\r\n\r\n  [519] Mirror of the Months.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 1.~\r\n\r\n\r\nOBESITY.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Bright, of Maldon, in the county of Essex, who died at\r\ntwenty-nine years of age, was an eminent shopkeeper of that town, and\r\nsupposed to be, at that time, the largest man living, or that had ever\r\nlived in this island. He weighed six hundred, one quarter, and\r\ntwenty-one pounds; and stood about five feet nine inches high; his body\r\nwas of an astonishing bulk, and his legs were as large as a middling\r\nman’s body. Though of so great a weight and bulk, he was surprisingly\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nAfter Bright’s death, a wager was proposed between Mr. Codd and Mr.\r\nHants, of Maldon, that five men at the age of twenty-one, then resident\r\nthere, could not be buttoned within his waistcoat without breaking a\r\nstitch or straining a button. On the 1st of December, 1750, the wager\r\nwas decided at the house of the widow Day, the Black Bull in Maldon,\r\nwhen five men and two more were buttoned within the waistcoat of the\r\ngreat personage deceased. There is a half-sheet print, published at the\r\ntime, representing the buttoning up of the seven persons, with an\r\ninscription beneath, to the above effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 41·10.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 2.~\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER.\r\n\r\nWinter may be now considered as having set in; and we have often violent\r\nwinds about this time, which sweep off the few remaining leaves from the\r\ntrees, and, with the exception of a few oaks and beeches, leave the\r\nwoods and forests nothing but a naked assemblage of bare boughs.\r\nDecember, thus robbing the woods of their leafy honours, is alluded to\r\nby Horace, in his Epod. xi.:--\r\n\r\n    Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti\r\n      Inachiâ furere,\r\n    Sylvis honorem decutit.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself, gentle reader, one of these blustering nights, when\r\na tremendous gale from south-west, with rattling rain, threatens almost\r\nthe demolition of every thing in its way: but add to the scene the\r\ninside of a snug and secure cottage in the country,--the day closed, the\r\nfire made up and blazing, the curtains drawn over a barricadoing of\r\nwindow-shutters which defy the penetration of Æolus and all his\r\nexcarcerated host; the table set for tea, and the hissing urn or the\r\nkettle scarce heard among the fierce whistling, howling, and roaring,\r\nproduced alternately or together, by almost every species of sound that\r\nwind can produce, in the chimneys and door crannies of the house. There\r\nis a feeling of comfort, and a sensibility to the blessings of a good\r\nroof over one’s head, and a warm and comfortable hearth, while all is\r\ntempest without, that produces a peculiar but real source of pleasure. A\r\ncheerful but quiet party adds, in no small degree, to this pleasure. Two\r\nor three intelligent friends sitting up over a good fire to a late hour,\r\nand interchanging their thoughts on a thousand subjects of mystery,--the\r\nstories of ghosts--and the tales of olden times,--may perhaps beguile\r\nthe hours of such a stormy night like this, with more satisfaction than\r\nthey could a midsummer evening under the shade of trees in a garden of\r\nroses and lilies. And then, when we retire to bed in a room with thick,\r\nwoollen curtains closely drawn, and a fire in the room, how sweet a\r\nlullaby is the piping of the gale down the flues, and the peppering of\r\nthe rain on the tiles and windows; while we are now and then rocked in\r\nthe house as if in a cradle![520]\r\n\r\n_For the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nDECEMBER MUSINGS.\r\n\r\nSONNET STANZAS.\r\n\r\n    Ανεμων πνεοντων την ηχω προσκυνει.\r\n\r\n  PYTHAGORAS\r\n\r\n    _Quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem--\r\n    Aut, gelidas hybernus aquas cum fuderit auster,\r\n      Securem somnos, imbre juvante, sequi!_\r\n\r\n  TIBULLUS.\r\n\r\n    I love to hear the high winds pipe aloud,\r\n      When ’gainst the leafy nations up in arms;\r\n    Now screaming in their rage, now shouting, proud--\r\n      Then moaning, as in pain at war’s alarms:\r\n    Then softly sobbing to unquiet rest,\r\n      Then wildly, harshly, breaking forth again\r\n    As if in scorn at having been represt,\r\n      With marching sweep careering o’er the plain\r\n    And, oh!

Advent Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of December, 1729, died at Paris, John Hardouin, a learned\r\nJesuit, especially celebrated for his condemnation of the writings of\r\nalmost all the Greek and Latin authors as forgeries in the middle ages.\r\nHe supposed that all history, philosophy, science, and even divinity,\r\nbefore the middle of the XIVth century, had been forged in the abbies of\r\nGermany, France, and Italy, by a set of monks, who availed themselves of\r\nthe taking of Constantinople by the French in 1203, its recovery by the\r\nGreeks 1261, and the expedition of St. Louis to the Holy Land, to make\r\nthe world believe that the writings of the Greeks and Romans were then\r\nfirst discovered, and brought into the west: whereas they had been\r\ncompiling them in their cells, and burying them in their libraries, for\r\ntheir successors to draw forth to light. Though he was ably refuted by\r\nLe Clerc and other distinguished writers, and recanted his opinions, in\r\nconsequence of the superiors of his church proscribing his works, yet he\r\nrepeated these absurd notions in subsequent publications.[522]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·62.\r\n\r\n  [522] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 4.~\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WALKING POST.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1808, was living William Brockbank, whose daily pedestrian\r\nachievements occasioned public notice of him to the following effect. He\r\nwas the Walking Post from Manchester to Glossop, in Derbyshire, a\r\ndistance of sixteen miles, which he performed every day, Sundays\r\nexcepted; returned the same evening, and personally delivered the\r\nletters, newspapers, &c. in that populous and commercial country, to all\r\nnear the road, which made his daily task not less than thirty-five\r\nmiles, or upwards. What is more extraordinary, he\r\n\r\n    “This daily coarse of duty _walk’d_”\r\n\r\nin less than twelve hours a day, and never varied a quarter of an hour\r\nfrom his usual time of arriving at Glossop.\r\n\r\nBrockbank was a native of Millom, in Cumberland, and had daily walked\r\nthe distance between Whitehaven and Ulverstone, frequently under the\r\nnecessity of wading the river at Muncaster, by which place he constantly\r\nwent, which is at least three miles round. Including the different\r\ncalls he had to make at a short distance from the road, his daily task\r\nwas not less than forty-seven miles.[523]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER.\r\n\r\nNow is the time when, in some parts of England, a person of great note\r\nformerly, in every populous place, was accustomed to make frequent\r\nnocturnal rambles, and proclaim all tidings which it seemed fitting to\r\nhim that people should be awakened out of their sleep to harken to. For\r\nthe use of this personage, “the Bell-man,” there is a book, now almost\r\nobsolete as regards its use, with this title explanatory of its\r\npurpose,--“The Bell-man’s Treasury, containing above a Hundred several\r\nVerses fitted for all Humours and Fancies, and suited to all times and\r\nseasons.” London, 1707, 8vo. From the riches of this “treasury,” whence\r\nthe predecessors of the present parish Bell-man took so much, a little\r\nmay be extracted for the reader’s information. First then, if the noisy\r\nrogue were thereunto moved by a good and valuable consideration, we\r\nfind, according to the aforesaid work, and the present season, that we\r\nought to be informed, by sound of bell, and public proclamation,\r\n\r\n_Upon a Windy Night._\r\n\r\n    Now ships are tost upon the angry main,\r\n    And Boreas boasts his uncontrolled reign:\r\n    The strongest winds their breath and vigour prove,\r\n    And through the air th’ increasing murmurs shove.\r\n    Think, you that sleep secure between the sheets,\r\n    What skies your _Bell-man_ tempts, what dangers meets.\r\n\r\nThen, again, according to the book of forms, he is instructed to agitate\r\nus with the following\r\n\r\n_Upon a Star-light Night._\r\n\r\n    Were I a conjurer, such nights as these\r\n    I’d choose to calculate nativities;\r\n    For every star to that degree prevails,\r\n    One might e’en count, and then turn up their tails.\r\n    This night will _Flamstead_, and the _Moorfields’_ fry\r\n    Such knowledge gain, they’ll seldom tell a lye.\r\n\r\nAs an amplification of the common cry of watchmen, may be produced the\r\nancient Bell-man’s.\r\n\r\n_Upon a Night of all Weathers._\r\n\r\n    This night, so different is the changing _weather_,\r\n    Boisterous or calm, I cannot tell you whether\r\n    ’Tis either fair or foul; but, altogether,\r\n    Just as to cry a star-light night I study,\r\n    Immediately the air grows dark and cloudy:\r\n    In short, the temper of the skies, if _any_,\r\n    Is _all_, and nature makes a _miscellany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, professor Gruithausen, of Munich, wrote an essay to\r\nshow that there are many plain indications of inhabitants in the moon.\r\nIn answer to certain questions, the “Munich Gazette” communicates some\r\nremarkable results, derived from a great number of observations--\r\n\r\n1. In what latitude in the moon are there indications of vegetation?\r\n\r\n2. How far are there indications of animated beings?\r\n\r\n3. Where are the greatest and plainest traces of art on the surface of\r\nthe moon?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first question, it appears from the observations of\r\nSchroter and Gruithausen, that the vegetation on the moon’s surface\r\nextends to fifty-five south latitude, and sixty-five north latitude.\r\nMany hundred observations show, in the different colours and monthly\r\nchanges, three kinds of phenomena which cannot possibly be explained,\r\nexcept by the process of vegetation.\r\n\r\nTo the second question it is answered, that the indications from which\r\nthe existence of living beings is inferred, are found from fifty north\r\nlatitude, to thirty-seven, and perhaps forty-seven, south latitude.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the third question, points out the places on the moon’s\r\nsurface in which are appearances of artificial causes altering the\r\nsurface. The author examines the appearances that induce him to infer\r\nthat there are artificial roads in various directions; and he describes\r\na colossal edifice, resembling our cities, on the most fertile part near\r\nthe moon’s equator, standing accurately according to the four cardinal\r\npoints. The main cities are in angles of forty-five degrees and ninety\r\ndegrees. A building resembling what is called a star-redoubt, the\r\nprofessor presumes to be dedicated to religious purposes, and as they\r\ncan see no stars in the daytime (their atmosphere being so pure) he\r\nthinks that they worship the stars, and consider the earth as a natural\r\nclock. His essay is accompanied by plates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      The sombre sadness of the evening shades\r\n    Steal slowly o’er the wild sequester’d glen,\r\n    And seem to make its loneliness more lonely--\r\n    In ages past, nature was here convuls’d,\r\n    And, with a sudden and terrific crash,\r\n    Asunder rent the adamantine hills--\r\n    Now, as exhausted with the pond’rous work,\r\n    She lies extended in a deathful trance--\r\n    The mountains form her couch magnificent;\r\n    Heaven’s glittering arch her canopy;\r\n    The snows made paler by the rising moon,\r\n    Her gorgeous winding sheet; and the dark rocks\r\n    That cast deep shadows on the expanse below,\r\n    The sable ’scutcheon of the mighty dead--\r\n    The roar of waters, and the north wind’s moan\r\n    Give music meet for her funereal dirge.\r\n\r\n      Yon giant crag, the offspring of her throes,\r\n    Has rear’d his towering bulk a thousand years,\r\n    Grown hoary in the war of elements,\r\n    And still defies the thunder, and the storm\r\n    But in his summer pride, his stately form\r\n    Is mantled o’er with purple, green, and gold,\r\n    And his huge head is garlanded with flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNY LOTTERIES AT BROUGH, WESTMORELAND.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, when gardens look in a dormant state, there are\r\nfrequently Penny Lotteries in the north of England; and very often a\r\nwhole garden is purchased for one penny. There are sometimes twenty\r\ntickets or more, as the case may be, all written on them “blank,” save\r\n“_the prize_.” These are put into a hat, and a boy stands on a form or\r\nchair holding the hat on his head, while those who have bought a ticket\r\nascend the form alternately, “one by one,” and, shutting their eyes,\r\ntake a ticket, which is opened by a boy who is at the bottom for that\r\npurpose. The tickets are only a penny each, and sometimes a garden\r\n(worth a few shillings) or whatever the sale may be, is bought for so\r\ntrifling a sum.\r\n\r\n  W. H.

NICHOLAS’ EVE.\r\n\r\nThe versifier of ancient customs, Naogeorgus, relates through the\r\nEnglish of his translator, Barnaby Googe, a curious practice on the\r\nvigil of this festival:--\r\n\r\n    Saint Nicholas money usde to give to maydens secretlie,\r\n    Who, that he still may use his woonted liberalitie,\r\n    The mothers all their children on the Eeve doe cause to fast,\r\n    And when they every one at night in senselesse sleepe are cast,\r\n    Both Apples, Nuttes, and Peares they bring, and other things beside,\r\n    As caps, and shooes, and petticotes, which secretly they hide,\r\n    And in the morning found, they say, that this saint Nicholas\r\n      brought:\r\n    Thus tender mindes to worship saints and wicked things are taught.\r\n\r\nA festival or ceremony called Zopata, from a Spanish word signifying a\r\nshoe, prevails in Italy in the courts of certain princes on St.\r\nNicholas’ day. Persons hide presents in the shoes and slippers of those\r\nthey do honour to, in such manner as may surprise them on the morrow\r\nwhen they come to dress. This is said to be done in imitation of the\r\npractice of St. Nicholas, who used in the night time to throw purses in\r\nat the windows of poor maids, for their marriage portions.[525]\r\n\r\nMr. Brady says, that “St. Nicholas was likewise venerated as the\r\nprotector of virgins; and that there are, or were until lately, numerous\r\nfantastical customs observed in Italy and various parts of France, in\r\nreference to that peculiar tutelary patronage. In several convents it\r\nwas customary, on the eve of St. Nicholas, for the _boarder_ to place\r\neach a silk stocking at the door of the apartment of the abbess, with a\r\npiece of paper enclosed, recommending themselves to ‘_great St. Nicholas\r\nof her chamber_:’ and the next day they were called together to witness\r\nthe saint’s attention, who never failed to fill the stockings with\r\nsweetmeats, and other trifles of that kind, with which these credulous\r\nvirgins made a general feast.”[526]\r\n\r\n\r\nPIG-ALLS.\r\n\r\nA correspondent remarks, that it is now customary for boys to take their\r\npigs by the hedgeways in the country to feed upon the ‘haws,’ which in\r\nthe west are called _pegalls_, or _pigalls_. The boys go foremost with\r\nlong poles, and beat the hedges, while the swine, after hearing where\r\nthey fall, work most industriously for their provender till dusk, when\r\nthey are driven home till daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 40·70.\r\n\r\n  [525] Brand.\r\n\r\n  [526] Brady’s Clavis Calendaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 6.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

He was accused--\r\n\r\n1. Of having, on the 26th of last September, committed the crime of\r\nprivate forgery, by counterfeiting, or causing to be counterfeited, a\r\nbond for four thousand francs, and by signing it with the forged\r\nsignatures, Berton, Mehul, Nicolo, and Boyeldieu.\r\n\r\n2.

Of having, on the 20th of January, 1817, committed a private forgery,\r\nby counterfeiting a resolution of the shareholders of the theatre\r\nFeydeau, with the same forged signature.\r\n\r\n4. Of having, on the 1st of March, 1817, committed a commercial forgery,\r\nby fabricating a bill of exchange for 16,500 francs, and signing it with\r\nthe forged signatures, Despermont, Perregaux, Lafitte and Company, and\r\nBerton.\r\n\r\n5. Of having, on the 9th of March, 1817, committed a private forgery, by\r\ncounterfeiting an invoice of musical instruments, and a bond for 14,000\r\nfrancs, and signing them with the forged signature of Pozzo di Borgo.\r\n\r\n6.

But afterward there were many St. Nicholases: and every\r\nparish, almost, had its St. Nicholas. And from this St. Nicolas’s day to\r\nInnocents’ day at night, this boy bore the name of a bishop, and the\r\nstate and habit too, wearing the mitre and the pastoral staff, and the\r\nrest of the pontifical attire; nay, and reading the holy offices. While\r\nhe went his procession, he was much feasted and treated by the people,\r\nas it seems, much valuing his blessing; which made the people so fond of\r\nkeeping this holyday.”[528]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the register of the capitulary acts of York cathedral,\r\nthat the Boy Bishop there was to be handsome and elegantly shaped.[529]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Henry Jenkins--Older than Old Parr.~]\r\n\r\n    He lived longer than men who were stronger,\r\n    And was too old to live any longer.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December, 1670, died Henry Jenkins, aged one hundred and\r\nsixty-nine years.\r\n\r\nJenkins was born at Bolton-upon-Swale in 1500, and followed the\r\nemployment of fishing for one hundred and forty years. When about eleven\r\nor twelve years old, he was sent to Northallerton, with a horse-load of\r\narrows for the battle of Flodden-field, with which a bigger boy (all\r\nthe men being employed at harvest) went forward to the army under the\r\nearl of Surrey; king Henry VIII. being at Tournay. When he was more than\r\na hundred years old, he used to swim across the river with the greatest\r\nease, and without catching cold. Being summoned to a tithe cause at\r\nYork, in 1667, between the vicar of Catterick and William and Peter\r\nMawbank, he deposed, that the tithes of wool, lamb, &c. were the\r\nvicar’s, and had been paid, to his knowledge, one hundred and twenty\r\nyears and more. And in another cause, between Mr. Hawes and Mr. Wastel\r\nof Ellerton, he gave evidence to one hundred and twenty years. Being\r\nborn before parish registers were kept, which did not come into use till\r\nthe thirtieth of Henry VIII., one of the judges asked him what memorable\r\nbattle or event had happened in his memory; to which he answered, “that\r\nwhen the battle of Flodden-field was fought, where the Scots were beat,\r\nwith the death of their king, he was turned of twelve years of age.”\r\nBeing asked how he lived, he said, “by thatching and salmon fishing;”\r\nthat when he was served with a subpœna, he was thatching a house, and\r\nwould dub a hook with any man in Yorkshire; that he had been butler to\r\nlord Conyers, of Hornby-castle, and that Marmaduke Brodelay, lord abbot\r\nof Fountains, did frequently visit his lord, and drink a hearty glass\r\nwith him; that his lord often sent him to inquire how the abbot did, who\r\nalways sent for him to his lodgings, and, after ceremonies, as he called\r\nit, passed, ordered him, besides wassel, a quarter of a yard of\r\nroast-beef for his dinner, (for that monasteries did deliver their\r\nguests meat by measure,) and a great black jack of strong drink. Being\r\nfurther asked, if he remembered the dissolution of religious houses, he\r\nsaid, “Very well; and that he was between thirty and forty years of age\r\nwhen the order came to dissolve those in Yorkshire; that great\r\nlamentation was made, and the country all in a tumult, when the monks\r\nwere turned out.”\r\n\r\nIn the same parish with Jenkins, there were four or five persons reputed\r\na century old, who all said he was an elderly man ever since they knew\r\nhim. Jenkins had sworn in Chancery and other courts to above a hundred\r\nand forty years’ memory. In the king’s remembrancer’s office, in the\r\nexchequer, is a record of a deposition taken, 1665, at Kettering, in\r\nYorkshire, in a cause “Clark and Smirkson,” wherein Henry Jenkins, of\r\nEllerton-upon-Swale, labourer, aged 157 years, was produced and sworn as\r\na witness. His diet was coarse and sour; towards the latter end of his\r\ndays he begged up and down.\r\n\r\nBorn when the Roman catholic religion was established, Jenkins saw the\r\nsupremacy of the pope overturned; the dissolution of monasteries, popery\r\nre-established, and at last the protestant religion securely fixed on a\r\nrock of adamant. In his time the invincible armada was destroyed; the\r\nrepublic of Holland was formed; three queens were beheaded, Anne Boleyn,\r\nCatherine Howard, and Mary queen of Scots; a king of Spain was seated\r\nupon the throne of England; a king of Scotland was crowned king of\r\nEngland at Westminster, and his son and successor was beheaded before\r\nhis own palace; lastly, the great fire in London happened in 1666, at\r\nthe latter end of his wonderfully long life.\r\n\r\nJenkins could neither read nor write. He died at Ellerton-upon-Swale,\r\nand was buried in Bolton church-yard, near Catterick and Richmond, in\r\nYorkshire, where a small pillar was erected to his memory, and this\r\nepitaph, composed by Dr. Thomas Chapman, master of Magdalen-college,\r\nCambridge, from 1746 to 1760, engraven upon a monument in Bolton church.\r\n\r\n  INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n  Blush not, MARBLE!\r\n  To rescue from oblivion\r\n  The Memory of\r\n  HENRY JENKINS;\r\n  A person obscure in birth,\r\n  But of a life truly memorable:\r\n  For,\r\n  He was enriched\r\n  With the goods of Nature\r\n  If not of Fortune;\r\n  And happy\r\n  In the duration,\r\n  If not variety,\r\n  Of his enjoyments:\r\n  And, tho’ the partial world\r\n  Despised and disregarded\r\n  His low and humble state,\r\n  The equal eye of Providence\r\n  Beheld and blessed it,\r\n  With a patriarch’s health, and length of\r\n  days:\r\n  To teach mistaken man,\r\n  These blessings\r\n  Were intail’d on temperance,\r\n  A life of labour, and a mind at ease.\r\n  He liv’d to the amazing age of\r\n  169,\r\n  Was interr’d here _December_ 6th,\r\n  1670;\r\n  And had this justice done to his memory\r\n  1743.[530]\r\n\r\nThere is a large half sheet portrait of Henry Jenkins, etched by\r\nWorlidge, (after an original painting by Walker,) from whence the\r\npresent engraving is copied, and there is a mezzotinto of him after the\r\nsame etching.\r\n\r\n  [527] From the MS.

A _Dwarf_, from Glamorganshire, in his fifteenth year, two feet six\r\ninches high, weighing only twelve pounds, yet very proportionable.\r\n\r\n2. _John Coan_, a Norfolk dwarf, aged twenty-three; he weighed, with all\r\nhis clothes, but thirty-four pounds, and his height, with his hat,\r\nshoes, and wig on, was but thirty-eight inches; his body was perfectly\r\nstraight, he was of a good complexion, and sprightly temper, sung\r\ntolerably, and mimicked a cock’s crowing very exactly. A child three\r\nyears eight months old, of an ordinary size, with his clothes on,\r\nweighed thirty-six pounds, and his height, without any thing on his\r\nhead, was thirty-seven inches seven-tenths, which on comparison gives an\r\nidea of the smallness of this dwarf.\r\n\r\n3. A _Negro_, who by a most extraordinary and singular dilatation and\r\ncontraction of the deltoid and biceps muscles of the arm, those of the\r\nback, &c., clasped his hands full together, threw them over his head and\r\nback, and brought them in that position under his feet. This he\r\nrepeated, backwards or forwards, as often as the spectators desired,\r\nwith the greatest facility.\r\n\r\n4. A _Female Rhinoceros_, or true Unicorn, a beast of upwards of eight\r\nthousand pounds weight, in a natural coat of mail or armour, having a\r\nlarge horn on her nose, three hoofs on each foot, and a hide stuck thick\r\nwith scales pistol proof, and so surprisingly folded as not to hinder\r\nits motion.\r\n\r\n5. A _Crocodile_, _alive_, taken on the banks of the Nile in Egypt, a\r\ncreature _never seen before alive in England_.[531]\r\n\r\nThis is a verbatim account of these sights published at the time; the\r\nprices of admission are not mentioned, but they were deemed worthy of\r\nnotice as remarkable exhibitions at the period. In the present day the\r\nwhole of them would scarcely make more than a twopenny show; and, at\r\nthat low rate, without a captivating showman, they would scarcely\r\nattract.

He writes in explanation, and adds some\r\nvery pleasant particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLACK FALL FAIR.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I cannot allow your pages to close without replying to the\r\n“Corrections and Illustrations,” p. 1584, made by “A Reader” respecting\r\n“Clack and its vicinity.”\r\n\r\n_First._ I observe that Bradenstoke priory is usually called the\r\n“Abbey,” in the neighbourhood,--not the “Priory.” There is a tree\r\ngrowing upon the tower, and a legend respecting it. I was once taken up\r\nto see it blossom, having slept in the room under it with my\r\nschoolfellow, John Bridges, whose mother, at that time a widow, kept the\r\nfarm, and a most excellent woman she was.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ I should have considered the stating, “that a carpenter,\r\nwhile digging, struck his spade against an image of gold, and has it in\r\nhis possession,” was sufficient, without further inquiry or remark. I\r\nrepeat the fact for a truth. I _know_ the _man_, and have _seen_ the\r\nIMAGE. As an antiquary myself, I assure you, sir, I could fain dig for\r\nsimilar hidden treasures in the hope of like reward. The person who owns\r\nthe image is not needy, he therefore would not part with his weight of\r\ngold for more sovereign current weight.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ When young, I descended several feet into the “subterraneous\r\npassage” referred to by your “Reader.” Though I am willing to admit the\r\npossibility of monkish imposition--such a passage has, however, been\r\nbelieved to have existed by the oldest people of Clack. Similarly, it is\r\nconjectured, that a passage once ran from Canonbury-tower, Islington, to\r\nthe palace Kensington. Your “Reader” is rather too sceptical to\r\nchallenge me to a proof, which I take only in a topographical sense. Of\r\nwhatever effect tradition may be, much historical truth is\r\nnotwithstanding embodied in it: furthermore, it is well known, that\r\nsubterraneous passages led from place to place, when castle building was\r\nin vogue.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ The oldest man living in Seagry, at the time I was shown the\r\nstone in Malmsbury abbey, whose name was Carey, was the occasion of my\r\ngoing to that place to see the stone: I paid sixpence to the person who\r\ngave me a view of it. He represented it to have been done by “Geoffry\r\nMiles”--the boy was a choirister: this is his information, not mine. The\r\nimpression ever after guarded my conduct in school.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ As to “Joe Ody,” your “Reader’s” own words prove the truth of\r\nwhat I have said of him, and the “_may be correct_” is not called for.\r\nThe lord chancellor could not have been more doubtful than your\r\nanonymous “Reader,” as to my information and communication. Some of the\r\nOdy family are now residing in Camberwell, whither your “Reader” may\r\nresort, should he be desirous of learning more of Joe’s merry-andrewism,\r\nwho was no mean disciple of the rev. Andrew, his patron.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly._ Your “Reader’s” hit at “Bowles” is corrected by me at the\r\npage in which his reference stands. Would that the “Bowles’ controversy”\r\nwith Byron and Roscoe, respecting Pope, had been as easily terminated,\r\nand with as little acrimony and as much satisfaction!\r\n\r\n_Seventhly._ The room I have already occupied in this paper prevents my\r\nstating much concerning “Clack Mount;”--this mount is, however,\r\nremarkable for two things,--the resort of bonfire makers, November 5,\r\nand the club at Whitsuntide. At the time of the _ox-roasting_ many years\r\nsince, in peaceful-ending times and rejoicing, this “mount” was a scene\r\nof delight and festivity. A band of music resorted thither, a line was\r\nformed as on club-day, beer was given round, and the collected people of\r\nboth sexes, young and old, joined in the hilarious jubilee; after which\r\nthe band, graced by every pretty girl, paraded to the priory, and played\r\nthere in the best room. Its furniture, I remember, looked clubbed, dark,\r\nand glossy; it seemed, to me, a pity to tread on the shining floor, it\r\nwas so antiquely neat and sacred. Given to kissing, when very young, I\r\nshall never forget touching the rosy cheeks of Miss Polly Bridges behind\r\nthe awful door of the sacristy, at which theft I was caught by her\r\nlaughing mother;--I beg to apologise to your “Reader,” sir, for this\r\n(digression) _confession_, but as my ancestors came from the priory, and\r\n_Christmas_ being near, I trust he will _pardon_ me, as Polly’s mother\r\ngave me _absolution_. On this ox-roasting occasion, Clack seemed really\r\nrising out of the stones. Dancing, music, holyday, and mirth, pervaded\r\nevery house; and, very unusual, every poor person that brought a plate\r\nfor the portion of slices of sheep, roasted opposite at baker Hendon’s,\r\npretended to have _more_ children than there were at home; some families\r\nimposed on the cook by two and three applications.--Who does not\r\nrecollect the ox and sheep roasting? I can hardly resist a description\r\nof the many scenes I witnessed several days successively in the various\r\nvillages--of the many happy hearts, and their intimate enjoyments. I\r\ncould almost follow the example of “Elia” himself, and at once be\r\njocose, classical, and fastidious. But mercy on your readers’ patience\r\ndenies me the pleasure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, _Lastly_, “The Maypole.” It was standing, fifteen feet high,\r\nthirty-six years ago. The higher part was cut off at the request of\r\nMadam Heath, before whose house, and the Trooper, it stood. I once\r\nmyself saw the “morris-dance” round it, when cowslips, oxlips, and other\r\nflowers were suspended up and down it: nails were driven round the lower\r\npart to prevent a further incision. Unfortunately for the writer, the\r\nland which lies from “Clack to Barry-end,” a distance less than two\r\nmiles, once belonged to my forefathers. Maud Heath, who caused a\r\n_causeway_ to be made and kept in order to this day, from\r\nCallaway’s-bridge to Chippenham, was one of my collaterals.\r\n\r\nThanking you, sir, for your indulgence, and a “Reader” for his giving me\r\nan opportunity of illustrating his positions,\r\n\r\n  I am,\r\n\r\n  truly yours,\r\n\r\n  AN OLD CORRESPONDENT.\r\n\r\n  _Dec. 11, 1826._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·82.\r\n\r\n  [531] Gentleman’s Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 8.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCEPTION B. V. M.\r\n\r\nThis day is so marked in the church of England calendar and almanacs. It\r\nis the Romish festival of “_The Immaculate Conception of the Holy\r\nVirgin_,” whom that church states to have been conceived and born\r\nwithout original sin. A doctrine whereon more has been written, perhaps,\r\nthan any other point of ecclesiastical controversy. One author, Peter\r\nD’Alva, has published forty-eight folios on the mysteries of the\r\nConception.\r\n\r\nThe immaculate conception and happy nativity of the Virgin are\r\nmaintained to have taken place at Loretto, about 150 miles from Rome;\r\nand further, that at that particular place, “hallowed by her birth,” she\r\nwas saluted by the angel Gabriel, and that she there nurtured our\r\nSaviour until he was twelve years of age. The popular belief readily\r\nyielding to that which power dictated, Loretto became one of the richest\r\nplaces in the world, from the numerous pilgrimages and votive presents\r\nmade to the “_Sancta Casa_,” or “Holy House,” to enclose which, a\r\nmagnificent church was erected and dedicated to the Virgin, hence\r\ngenerally styled “our Lady of Loretto.”\r\n\r\nPeter the Lombard originally started the mystery of the immaculate\r\nconception in the year 1060; though Baronius affirms, that it was\r\n“discovered by Revelation” in the year 1109, to one, (but his name is\r\nnot recorded,) “who was a great lover of the Virgin, and daily read her\r\noffice.” On the day he was to be married, however, he was “so much\r\noccupied,” that this usual piece of devotion escaped his attention until\r\nhe was in “the nuptial office,” when, suddenly recollecting the\r\nomission, he sent his bride and all the company home while he performed\r\nit. During this pious duty, the Virgin appeared to him with her son in\r\nher arms, and reproached him for his neglect, affording, however, the\r\nglorious hope of salvation, if he would “quit his wife and consider\r\nhimself espoused to her,” declaring to him the whole of the\r\ncircumstances of her nativity, which he reported to the pope, who\r\nnaturally caused her feast immediately to be instituted.\r\n\r\nThe canons of Lyons attempted to establish an office for this mystery in\r\nthe year 1136, but Bernard opposed it. The council at Oxford, in 1222,\r\nleft people at liberty either to observe the day or not. Sixtus IV.,\r\nhowever, in the year 1476, ordered it to be generally held in\r\ncommemoration, although the alleged circumstances attendant upon this\r\nimmaculate conception are not, even in the church of Rome, held as an\r\narticle of faith, but merely reckoned a “pious opinion.” The council of\r\nTrent confirmed the ordinances of Sixtus, but without condemning as\r\nheretics those who refused to observe it; and Alexander V. issued his\r\nbull, even commanding that there should not be any discussion upon such\r\nan intricate subject. The Spaniards, however, were so strenuous in their\r\nbelief of this mystery, that from the year 1652, the knights of the\r\nmilitary orders of St. James of the sword, Calatrava, and Alcantara,\r\neach made a vow at their admission to “defend” the doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn the popish countries, the Virgin is still the principal favourite of\r\ndevotion, and is addressed by her devotees under the following, from\r\namong many other titles, ill suiting with the reformed sentiments of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n_Empress of Heaven!_\r\n\r\n_Queen of Heaven!_\r\n\r\n_Empress of Angels!_\r\n\r\n_Queen of Angels!_\r\n\r\n_Empress of the Earth!_\r\n\r\n_Queen of the Earth!_\r\n\r\n_Lady of the Universe!_\r\n\r\n_Lady of the World!_\r\n\r\n_Mistress of the World!_\r\n\r\n_Patroness of the Men!_\r\n\r\n_Advocate for Sinners!_\r\n\r\n_Mediatrix!_\r\n\r\n_Gate of Paradise!_\r\n\r\n_Mother of Mercies!_\r\n\r\n_Goddess! and_\r\n\r\n_The only Hope of Sinners!_\r\n\r\nUnder the two latter, they implore the Virgin for salvation by the power\r\nwhich, as a mother, she is inferred to possess of “commanding her son!”\r\nThe legends afford tales in support of the opinion, that she not only\r\npossesses, but actually exerts such authorities.--“O Mary,” says St.\r\nBonaventure, “be a man never so wicked and miserable a sinner, you have\r\nthe soft compassion of a mother for him, and never leave him until you\r\nhave reconciled him to his judge.” One instance of which peculiar\r\nprotection of sinners is recorded from father Crassett, who with much\r\nsolemnity states, that “a soldier, hardened by his occupation, had not\r\nonly renounced Christ, but given himself up wholly to the devil and the\r\nmost vicious courses, though, as he did not also renounce the Virgin, he\r\nin a time of much necessity fervently prayed for her intercession.” This\r\napplication, he adds, “was instantly attended to, and the man heard the\r\nbenevolent mother of our Lord desire her son to have mercy upon him;\r\nwho, not to refuse his parent, answered, he would do it for her sake,\r\nnotwithstanding he had himself been wholly forgotten and unnoticed.”\r\n\r\nThe first who was particularly noticed as introducing this worship of\r\nthe Virgin, is Peter Gnapheus, bishop of Antioch, in the fifth century,\r\nwho appointed her name to be called upon in the prayers of the church.\r\nIt is said that Peter Fullo, a monk of Constantinople, introduced the\r\nname of the Virgin Mary in the public prayers about the year 480; but it\r\nis certain, she was not generally invoked in public until a long time\r\nafter that period.[532]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·22.\r\n\r\n  [532] Mr. Brady’s Clavis Calendaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 9.~\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH MARRIAGE CEREMONY.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December, 1809, the following cause was tried in the court\r\nof King’s-bench, Guildhall, London, before lord Ellenborough and a\r\nspecial jury.\r\n\r\n  _Holme_ and others v. _Noah_.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrow stated this to be an action upon a bill of exchange for a\r\nsmall sum of money for coals, which the plaintiffs, who were\r\ncoal-merchants, had furnished to the defendant, who was an ingenious\r\nlady, employing herself in drawing pictures. The bill, when due, had not\r\nbeen honoured.\r\n\r\nMr. Park, in defence to the action, maintained, that the defendant was\r\na married woman, and said he held an excellent treatise in his hand,\r\ncalled “_Uxor Hebreiaca_,” from whence he cited in behalf of his client,\r\nwho was a Jewess, whose husband was alive.\r\n\r\nMr. Philips, reader of the Synagogue of the Jews in Leadenhall-street,\r\nproved the marriage to have taken place in the year 1781; he was present\r\nat it. The proper priest, now dead, officiated in the usual form and\r\nsolemnity, and these parties were duly united in lawful marriage,\r\naccording to the Mosaic form. He was one of the attesting witnesses of\r\nthe entry of the marriage in the book of the priest.\r\n\r\nMr. Levi proved that he knew the husband and wife; was present at the\r\nmarriage, he being then only thirteen.\r\n\r\nJos. Abidigore, a teacher of the Hebrew language, read in English the\r\nentry in the priest’s book of this marriage; the ceremony was executed\r\nby the priest. The entry in English was thus:\r\n\r\n“Fourth day of the week, in the second month Neron, in the year 5541\r\nafter the creation of the world, according to the reckoning here in\r\nLondon. Henry Noel said to Emily--“Become thou a wife unto me, according\r\nto the law of Moses, and I will ever after maintain thee according to\r\nthe rites of the Jews;” and the priest said, “I heard him account her\r\nwife, and she shall bring to him the dowry of her virginity according to\r\nthe law, and she shall remain and cohabit with him.” To which the lady\r\ndid consent and become unto him his wife, and she offered him presents\r\nconsisting of silver and gold, and splendid ornaments of gold, and 100\r\npieces of fine silver; and the bridegroom accepted these presents of the\r\nbride, and brought also 100 pieces of the like gold, ornaments, and fine\r\nsilver; the whole amounting together to 200 pieces of gold and fine\r\nsilver; and the bridegroom doth take all the responsibility of the care\r\nof all for himself, for his bride, and for their children.

I\r\nentered, and found them employed in the baptism of a child. The font was\r\na pint basin, placed on a small plate; the humble table was covered with\r\na clean napkin. The minister, a brawny, round-shouldered young man, with\r\ndeep-cut features and overhanging brows, his eyes closed, and his body\r\nmoving in every direction, roared out in the most discordant and\r\ndeafening din; his voice then suddenly fell--then rose, and fell again,\r\nwith most surprising, but most inharmonious modulation. The child he\r\nthen proceeded to _cross_, “in the name, &c.,” the whole being in the\r\nWelsh language: the name of the child (Henry) was the only English sound\r\nwhich caught my ear. Next followed, what appeared to me, an address to\r\nthe parents. The scene was picturesque. The cottage rude, and but half\r\nillumined by the dim light--the vehement contortions of the\r\npreacher--the mother and the child, with several young women, whose\r\ncheeks were as ruddy as the Welsh cloaks with which they were _adorned_,\r\nsitting beside the fire--the father, in his countenance a mixture of\r\nrudeness and of puritanism, leaning against the wall in an attitude of\r\nthe profoundest attention--two or three old women coughing and groaning\r\naround the preacher--some labourers standing in a group, in a dark\r\ncorner, scarcely discernible--and the chubby children, half wishing, but\r\nnot daring, to continue their sports: these, and the other features of\r\nthis unstudied scene, would have formed an admirable subject for the\r\npencil of a Wilkie. At length the preacher approached to a conclusion,\r\nand wound up his address in a peroration, distinguished by increased\r\nenergy of manner, by more hideous faces, by accelerated motions of his\r\nlimbs, and by louder vociferation. He suddenly sat down: the religious\r\npart of the ceremony was over, and I was invited to partake of the\r\nrustic fare which had been provided for the occasion.\r\n\r\n  J.

Do not eat\r\nto full satiety. Breakfast betimes; it is not wholesome to go out\r\nfasting. In winter, a glass or two of wine is an excellent preservative\r\nagainst unwholesome air. Make a hearty meal about noon, and eat plain\r\nmeats only. Avoid salted meats: those who eat them often have pale\r\ncomplexions, a slow pulse, and are full of corrupted humours. Sup\r\nbetimes, and sparingly. Let your meat be neither too little nor too much\r\ndone. Sleep not till two hours after eating. Begin your meals with a\r\nlittle tea, and wash your mouth with a cup of it afterward.\r\n\r\nThe most important advice which can be given for maintaining the body in\r\ndue temperament, is to be very moderate in the use of all the pleasures\r\nof sense; for all excess weakens the spirits. Walk not too long at once.\r\nStand not for hours in one posture; nor lie longer than necessary. In\r\nwinter, keep not yourself too hot; nor in summer too cold. Immediately\r\nafter you awake, rub your breast where the heart lies, with the palm of\r\nyour hand. Avoid a stream of wind as you would an arrow. Coming out of a\r\nwarm bath, or after hard labour, do not expose your body to cold. If in\r\nthe spring, there should be two or three hot days, do not be in haste to\r\nput off your winter clothes. It is unwholesome to fan yourself during\r\nperspiration. Wash your mouth with water or tea, lukewarm, before you go\r\nto rest, and rub the soles of your feet warm. When you lie down, banish\r\nall thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·57.\r\n\r\n  [533] See vol. i. 1570.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 14.~\r\n\r\n\r\nIRISH LINEN.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1738, was shown at the Linen Hall, in Dublin, a piece of\r\nlinen, accounted the finest ever made; there were 3800 threads in the\r\nbreadth.

Though at any time we may like, yet now\r\nwe _love_ to hear accounts of sayings and doings in former times; and,\r\ntherefore, it seems that a description of an old house in the country,\r\nand an old and true story belonging to it, may be agreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ANCIENT HALL.\r\n\r\nLittlecotes-house, two miles from Hungerford, in Berkshire, stands in a\r\nlow and lonely situation. On three sides it is surrounded by a park that\r\nspreads over the adjoining hill; on the fourth, by meadows, which are\r\nwatered by the river Kennet. Close on one side of the house is a thick\r\ngrove of lofty trees, along the verge of which runs one of the principal\r\navenues to it through the park. It is an irregular building of great\r\nantiquity, and was probably erected about the time of the termination\r\nof feudal warfare, when defence came no longer to be an object in a\r\ncountry-mansion. Many circumstances in the interior of the house,\r\nhowever, seem appropriate to feudal times. The hall is very spacious,\r\nfloored with stones, and lighted by large transom windows, that are\r\nclothed with casements. Its walls are hung with old military\r\naccoutrements, that have long been left a prey to rust. At one end of\r\nthe hall is a range of coats of mail and helmets, and there is on every\r\nside abundance of old-fashioned pistols and guns, many of them with\r\nmatchlocks. Immediately below the cornice hangs a row of leathern\r\njerkins, made in the form of a shirt, supposed to have been worn as\r\narmour by the vassals. A large oak-table, reaching nearly from one end\r\nof the room to the other, might have feasted the whole neighbourhood;\r\nand an appendage to one end of it, made it answer at other times for the\r\nold game of shuffle-board. The rest of the furniture is in a suitable\r\nstyle, particularly an arm-chair of cumbrous workmanship, constructed of\r\nwood, curiously turned, with a high back and triangular seat, said to\r\nhave been used by judge Popham in the reign of Elizabeth. The entrance\r\ninto the hall is at one end by a low door, communicating with a passage\r\nthat leads from the outer door, in the front of the house, to a\r\nquadrangle within; at the other it opens upon a gloomy staircase, by\r\nwhich you ascend to the first floor, and passing the doors of some\r\nbed-chambers, enter a narrow gallery, which extends along the back front\r\nof the house from one end to the other of it, and looks upon an old\r\ngarden. This gallery is hung with portraits, chiefly in the Spanish\r\ndresses of the sixteenth century. In one of the bed-chambers, which you\r\npass in going towards the gallery, is a bedstead with blue furniture,\r\nwhich time has now made dingy and threadbare; and in the bottom of one\r\nof the bed-curtains you are shown a place where a small piece has been\r\ncut out and sewn in again; a circumstance which serves to identify the\r\nscene of the following story:--\r\n\r\nIt was a dark, rainy night in the month of November, that an old midwife\r\nsat musing by her cottage fire-side, when on a sudden she was startled\r\nby aloud knocking at the door. On opening it she found a horseman, who\r\ntold her that her assistance was required immediately by a person of\r\nrank, and that she should be handsomely rewarded, but that there were\r\nreasons for keeping the affair a strict secret, and, therefore, she must\r\nsubmit to be blindfolded, and to be conducted in that condition to the\r\nbed-chamber of the lady. After proceeding in silence for many miles\r\nthrough rough and dirty lanes, they stopped, and the midwife was led\r\ninto a house, which, from the length of her walk through the apartment,\r\nas well as the sounds about her, she discovered to be the seat of wealth\r\nand power. When the bandage was removed from her eyes, she found herself\r\nin a bed-chamber, in which were the lady, on whose account she had been\r\nsent for, and a man of haughty and ferocious aspect. The lady gave birth\r\nto a fine boy. Immediately the man commanded the midwife to give him the\r\nchild, and, catching it from her, he hurried across the room, and threw\r\nit on the back of the fire, that was blazing in the chimney. The child,\r\nhowever, was strong, and by its struggles rolled itself off upon the\r\nhearth, when the ruffian again seized it with fury, and, in spite of the\r\nintercession of the midwife, and the more piteous entreaties of the\r\nmother, thrust it under the grate, and raking the live coals upon it,\r\nsoon put an end to its life. The midwife, after spending some time in\r\naffording all the relief in her power to the wretched mother, was told\r\nthat she must be gone. Her former conductor appeared, who again bound\r\nher eyes, and conveyed her behind him to her own home; he then paid her\r\nhandsomely, and departed. The midwife was strongly agitated by the\r\nhorrors of the preceding night; and she immediately made a deposition of\r\nthe fact before a magistrate. Two circumstances afforded hopes of\r\ndetecting the house in which the crime had been committed; one was, that\r\nthe midwife, as she sat by the bed-side, had, with a view to discover\r\nthe place, cut out a piece of the bed-curtain, and sewn it in again; the\r\nother was, that as she had descended the staircase, she had counted the\r\nsteps. Some suspicions fell upon one Darrell, at that time the\r\nproprietor of Littlecote-house and the domain around it. The house was\r\nexamined, and identified by the midwife, and Darrell was tried at\r\nSalisbury for the murder. By corrupting his judge, he escaped the\r\nsentence of the law; but broke his neck by a fall from his horse in\r\nhunting, in a few months after. The place where this happened is still\r\nknown by the name of Darrell’s hill: a spot to be dreaded by the peasant\r\nwhom the shades of evening have overtaken on his way.[535]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·67.\r\n\r\n  [535] In Dr. Drake’s “Shakspeare and his Times,” from sir Walter\r\n  Scott’s “Rokeby.”\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 17.~\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY MANSIONS.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII., and even of Mary, they were, if we\r\nexcept their size, little better than cottages, being thatched\r\nbuildings, covered on the outside with the coarsest clay, and lighted\r\nonly by lattices. When Harrison wrote, in the age of Elizabeth, though\r\nthe greater number of manor-houses still remained framed of timber, yet\r\nhe observes, “such as be latelie builded, are com’onlie either of bricke\r\nor hard stone, or both; their roomes large and comelie, and houses of\r\noffice further distant from their lodgings.” The old timber mansions,\r\ntoo, were then covered with the finest plaster, which, says the\r\nhistorian, “beside the delectable whitenesse of the stuffe itselfe, is\r\nlaied on so even and smoothlie, as nothing in my judgment can be done\r\nwith more exactnesse:” and at the same time, the windows, interior\r\ndecorations, and furniture, were becoming greatly more useful and\r\nelegant. “Of old time our countrie houses,” continues Harrison, “instead\r\nof glasse did use much lattise, and that made either of wicker or fine\r\nrifts of oke in chekerwise. I read also that some of the better sort, in\r\nand before the time of the Saxons, did make panels of horne instead of\r\nglasse, and fix them in woodden calmes. But as horne in windows is now\r\nquite laid downe in everie place, so our lattises are also growne into\r\nlesse use, because glasse is come to be so plentifull, and within a\r\nverie little so good cheape if not better then the other. The wals of\r\nour houses on the inner sides in like sort be either hanged with\r\ntapisterie, arras worke, or painted cloths, wherein either diverse\r\nhistories, or hearbes, beasts, knots, and such like are stained, or else\r\nthey are seeled with oke of our owne, or wainescot brought hither out of\r\nthe east countries, whereby the roomes are not a little commanded, made\r\nwarme, and much more close than otherwise they would be. As for stooves\r\nwe have not hitherto used them greatlie, yet doo they now begin to be\r\nmade in diverse houses of the gentrie. Like in the houses of knights,\r\ngentlemen, &c. it is not geson to behold generallie their great\r\nprovision of Turkie worke, pewter, brasse, fine linen, and thereto\r\ncostlie cupbords of plate, worth five or six hundred or a thousand\r\npounds, to be deemed by estimation.”\r\n\r\nThe house of every country-gentleman of property included a neat chapel\r\nand a spacious hall; and where the estate and establishment were\r\nconsiderable, the mansion was divided into two parts or sides, one for\r\nthe state or banqueting-rooms, and the other for the household; but in\r\ngeneral, the latter, except in baronial residences, was the only part to\r\nbe met with, and when complete, had the addition of parlours; thus\r\nBacon, in his Essay on Building, describing the household side of a\r\nmansion, says, “I wish it divided at the first into a hall, and a\r\nchappell, with a partition between, both of good state and bignesse; and\r\nthose not to goe all the length, but to have, at the further end, a\r\nwinter and a summer parler, both faire: and under these roomes a faire\r\nand large cellar, sunke under ground: and likewise, some privie\r\nkitchens, with butteries and pantries, and the like.” It was the custom\r\nalso to have windows opening from the parlours and passages into the\r\nchapel, hall, and kitchen, with the view of overlooking or controlling\r\nwhat might be going on; a trait of vigilant caution, which may still be\r\ndiscovered in some of our ancient colleges and manor-houses.\r\n\r\nThe hall of the country squire was the usual scene of eating and\r\nhospitality, at the upper end of which was placed the orsille, or high\r\ntable, a little elevated above the floor, and here the master of the\r\nmansion presided, with an authority, if not a state, which almost\r\nequalled that of the potent baron. The table was divided into upper and\r\nlower messes, by a huge saltcellar, and the rank and consequence of the\r\nvisitors were marked by the situation of their seats above and below the\r\nsaltcellar; a custom which not only distinguished the relative dignity\r\nof the guests, but extended likewise to the nature of the provision, the\r\nwine frequently circulating only above the saltcellar, and the dishes\r\nbelow it being of a coarser kind than those near the head of the\r\ntable.[536]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·50.\r\n\r\n  [536] Dr. Drake\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 18.~\r\n\r\nOxford Term ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ENGLISH LIVING.\r\n\r\nThe usual fare of country-gentlemen, relates Harrison, was “foure, five,\r\nor six dishes, when they have but small resort,” and accordingly, we\r\nfind that Justice Shallow, when he invites Falstaffe to dinner, issues\r\nthe following orders: “Some pigeons, Davy; a couple of short-legged\r\nhens; a joint of mutton; and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell\r\nWilliam Cook.” But on feast-days, and particularly on festivals, the\r\nprofusion and cost of the table were astonishing. Harrison observes,\r\nthat the country-gentlemen and merchants contemned butcher’s meat on\r\nsuch occasions, and vied with the nobility in the production of rare and\r\ndelicate viands, of which he gives a long list; and Massinger says,\r\n\r\n    “Men may talk of country Christmasses,\r\n    Their thirty-pound butter’d eggs, their pies of carp’s tongues,\r\n    Their pheasants drench’d with ambergris, the carcasses\r\n    Of three fat wethers bruised for gravy, to\r\n    Make sauce for a single peacock; yet their feasts\r\n    Were fasts, compared with the city’s.”\r\n\r\n  _City Madam_, act ii. sc. 1.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in the houses of the country-gentlemen to retire after\r\ndinner, which generally took place about eleven in the morning, to the\r\ngarden-bower, or an arbour in the orchard, in order to partake of the\r\nbanquet or dessert; thus Shallow, addressing Falstaffe after dinner,\r\nexclaims, “Nay, you shall see mine orchard: where, in an arbour, we will\r\neat a last year’s pippin of my own graffing, with a dish of carraways,\r\nand so forth.” From the banquet it was usual to retire to evening\r\nprayer, and thence to supper, between five and six o’clock; for, in\r\nShakspeare’s time, there were seldom more than two meals--dinner and\r\nsupper; “heretofore,” remarked Harrison, “there hath beene much more\r\ntime spent in eating and drinking than commonlie is in these daies; for\r\nwhereas of old we had breakfasts in the forenoone, beverages or nuntions\r\nafter dinner, and thereto reare suppers generallie when it was time to\r\ngo to rest. Now these od repasts, thanked be God, are verie well left,\r\nand ech one in manner (except here and there some yoonge hungrie stomach\r\nthat cannot fast till dinner time) contenteth himselfe with dinner and\r\nsupper onelie. The nobilitie, gentlemen, and merchantmen, especiallie at\r\ngreat meetings, doo sit commonlie till two or three of the clocke at\r\nafternoone, so that with manie it is an hard matter to rise from the\r\ntable to go to evening praier, and returne from thence to come time\r\nenough to supper.”\r\n\r\nThe supper, which, on days of festivity, was often protracted to a late\r\nhour, and often, too, as substantial as the dinner, was succeeded,\r\nespecially at Christmas, by gambols of various sorts; and sometimes the\r\nsquire and his family would mingle in the amusements, or, retiring to\r\nthe tapestried parlour, would leave the hall to the more boisterous\r\nmirth of their household; then would the blind harper, who sold his fit\r\nof mirth for a groat, be introduced, either to provoke the dance, or to\r\nrouse their wonder by his minstrelsy; his “matter being, for the most\r\npart, stories of old time,--as the tale of sir Topas, the reportes of\r\nBevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke, Adam Bell, and Clymme of the\r\nClough, and such other old romances or historical rimes, made purposely\r\nfor recreation of the common people, at Christmas dinners and\r\nbrideales.”\r\n\r\nThe posset, at bed-time, closed the joyous day--a custom to which\r\nShakspeare has occasionally alluded: thus Lady Macbeth says of the\r\n“surfeited grooms,” “I have drugg’d their possets;” Mr. Quickly tells\r\nRugby, “Go; and we’ll have a posset for’t soon at night, in faith, at\r\nthe latter end of a sea-coal fire;” and Page, cheering Falstaffe,\r\nexclaims, “Thou shalt eat a posset to-night at my house.” Thomas\r\nHeywood, a contemporary of Shakspeare, has particularly noticed this\r\nrefection as occurring just before bed-time: “Thou shalt be welcome to\r\nbeef and bacon, and perhaps a bag-pudding; and my daughter Nell shall\r\npop a posset upon thee when thou goest to bed.”[537]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 39·35.\r\n\r\n  [537] Dr. Drake.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 19.~\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UPSTART.\r\n\r\nBishop Earle says, “he is a holiday clown, and differs only in the\r\nstuff of his clothes, not the stuff of himself; for he bare the king’s\r\nsword before he had arms to wield it; yet, being once laid o’er the\r\nshoulder with a knighthood, he finds the herald his friend.

He is guarded with more gold lace than all the gentlemen of\r\nthe country, yet his body makes his clothes still out of fashion. His\r\nhouse-keeping is seen much in the distinct families of dogs, and\r\nserving-men attendant on their kennels, and the deepness of their\r\nthroats is the depth of his discourse. A hawk he esteems the true burden\r\nof nobility, and is exceeding ambitious to seem delighted in the sport,\r\nand have his fist gloved with his jesses. A justice of peace he is to\r\ndomineer in his parish, and do his neighbour wrong with more right. He\r\nwill be drunk with his hunters for company, and stain his gentility with\r\ndroppings of ale. He is fearful of being sheriff of the shire by\r\ninstinct, and dreads the assize week as much as the prisoner.

See vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD ENGLISH SQUIRE.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, an old gentleman of ancient times in Dorsetshire, was low\r\nof stature, but strong and active, of a ruddy complexion, with flaxen\r\nhair. His clothes were always of green cloth, his house was of the old\r\nfashion; in the midst of a large park, well stocked with deer, rabbits,\r\nand fish-ponds. He had a long, narrow bowling-green in it; and used to\r\nplay with round sand bowls. Here, too, he had a banqueting-room built,\r\nlike a stand, in a large tree. He kept all sorts of hounds, that ran\r\nbuck, fox, hare, otter, and badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both\r\nlong and short winged. His great hall was commonly strewed with marrow\r\nbones; and full of hawk-perches, hounds, spaniels, and terriers. The\r\nupper end of it was hung with fox-skins, of this and the last year’s\r\nkilling. Here and there a pole-cat was intermixed; and hunters’ poles in\r\ngreat abundance. The parlour was a large room, completely furnished in\r\nthe same style. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some of the\r\nchoicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels. One or two of the great chairs\r\nhad litters of cats in them, which were not to be disturbed. Of these,\r\nthree or four always attended him at dinner; and a little white wand lay\r\nby his trencher, to defend it if they were too troublesome. In the\r\nwindows, which were very large, lay his arrows, cross-bows, and other\r\naccoutrements. The corners of the room were filled with his best hunting\r\nand hawking poles. His oyster table stood at the lower end of the room,\r\nwhich was in constant use twice a day all the year round; for he never\r\nfailed to eat oysters both at dinner and supper, with which the\r\nneighbouring town of Pool supplied him. At the upper end of the room\r\nstood a small table with a double desk; one side of which held a church\r\nbible, the other the book of martyrs. On different tables in the room\r\nlay hawks’ hoods, bells, old hats, with their crowns thrust in, full of\r\npheasant eggs; tables, dice, cards, and store of tobacco pipes. At one\r\nend of this room was a door, which opened into a closet, where stood\r\nbottles of strong beer and wine; which never came out but in single\r\nglasses, which was the rule of the house; for he never exceeded himself,\r\nnor permitted others to exceed. Answering to this closet was a door into\r\nan old chapel, which had been long disused for devotion; but in the\r\npulpit, as the safest place, was always to be found a cold chine of\r\nbeef, a venison pasty, a gammon of bacon, or a great apple-pie, with\r\nthick crust well baked. His table cost him not much, though it was good\r\nto eat at. His sports supplied all but beef and mutton; except on\r\nFridays, when he had the best of fish. He never wanted a London pudding,\r\nand he always sang it in with “My part lies therein-a.” He drank a glass\r\nor two of wine at meals; put sirup of gillyflowers into his sack; and\r\nhad always a tun glass of small beer standing by him, which he often\r\nstirred about with rosemary. He lived to be a hundred; and never lost\r\nhis eye-sight, nor used spectacles. He got on horseback without help;\r\nand rode to the death of the stag, till he was past four-score.[538]\r\n\r\nAnciently it was the custom with many country gentlemen to spend their\r\nChristmas in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·17.\r\n\r\n  [538] Dr. Drake; from Hutchins’s Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 21.~\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

The “Lumber-Troop” muster strong\r\nat their head-quarters near Gough-square; the “codgers” enlighten each\r\nother and their pipes in Bride-lane; the “Counsellors under the\r\nCauliflower” hold divided council, they know where; and the “free and\r\neasy Johns” are to night more free than easy. These societies are under\r\ncurrents that set in strong, and often turn the tide of an election in\r\nfavour of some “good fellow,” who is good no where but in “sot’s-hole.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the “gentlemen of the inquest,” chosen “at the church” in the\r\nmorning, dine together as the first important duty of their office; and\r\nthe re-elected ward-beadles are busy with the fresh chosen constables;\r\nand the watchmen are particularly civil to every “drunken gentleman” who\r\nhappens to look like one of the new authorities.

The\r\nsubject to which I allude is the annual solicitation for charity on St.\r\nThomas’s day. It has taken place here from time immemorial; consequently\r\nmy object in writing is to request you will favour us in your\r\ninstructive miscellany, with the origin of the custom, if possible. I\r\nshall relate a few instances of its prevalency which come within my own\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAt Loose, near Maidstone, Mr. T. Charlton gives the poor of the parish\r\ncertain quantities of wheat, apportioned to their families, in addition\r\nto which, his daughters give the widows a new flannel petticoat each;\r\nwho, at the same time, go to the other respectable inhabitants of the\r\nplace to solicit the usual donation, and it is not an uncommon thing for\r\na family to get in this way six or seven shillings.\r\n\r\nThis custom is also prevalent at Linton, an adjoining parish; and I am\r\ninformed that lord Cornwallis, who resides there, intends giving to the\r\nresident poor something very considerable.

She wore leather shoes and black worsted\r\nstockings, a black stuff gown with a muslin frill at the neck, and a red\r\nand black shawl round her shoulders, and a black cotton shawl on her\r\nhead. Her height was about five feet two inches, and she carried a small\r\nbundle on her arm containing a few necessaries. Her clothes were\r\nloosely and tastefully put on in an oriental fashion. Her eyes and hair\r\nwere black, her forehead was low, her nose short, her mouth wide, her\r\nteeth white, her lips large and full, her under lip projected a little,\r\nher chin was small and round, her hands were clean and seemed unused to\r\nlabour. She appeared about twenty-five years of age, was fatigued,\r\nwalked with difficulty, spoke a language no one could comprehend, and\r\nsignified by signs her desire to sleep in the village. The cottagers\r\nwere afraid to admit her, and sought the decision of Mr. Worrall, a\r\nmagistrate for the county, at Knole, whose lady caused her own maid to\r\naccompany her to a public-house in the village, with a request that she\r\nshould have a supper, and a comfortable bed.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Mrs. Worrall found her, with strong traces of sorrow and\r\ndistress on her countenance, and took her with her to Knole, but she\r\nwent reluctantly. It was Good Friday, and at the mansion, observing a\r\ncross-bun, she cut off the cross, and placed it in her bosom.\r\n\r\nPaper and a pen were handed to her to write her name; she shook her\r\nhead: and when she appeared to comprehend what was meant, pointed to\r\nherself, and cried “Caraboo.” The next day she was taken to Bristol,\r\nexamined before the mayor, at the Council-house, and committed to St.\r\nPeter’s Hospital as a vagrant, whither persons of respectability flocked\r\nto visit the incomprehensible inmate. From that place Mrs. Worrall\r\nremoved her once more to Knole. A gentleman, who had made several\r\nvoyages to the Indies, extracted from her signs, and gestures, and\r\narticulation, that she was the daughter of a person of rank, of Chinese\r\norigin, at “Javasu,” and that whilst walking in her garden, attended by\r\nthree women, she had been gagged, and bound, and carried off, by the\r\npeople of a pirate-prow, and sold to the captain of a brig, from whence\r\nshe was transferred to another ship, which anchored at a port for two\r\ndays, where four other females were taken in, who, after a voyage of\r\nfive weeks, were landed at another port: sailing for eleven more weeks,\r\nand being near land, she jumped overboard, in consequence of ill usage,\r\nand swimming ashore, found herself on this coast, and had wandered for\r\nsix weeks, till she found her way to Almondsbury. She described herself\r\nat her father’s to have been carried on men’s shoulders, in a kind of\r\npalanquin, and to have worn seven peacocks’ feathers on the right side\r\nof her head, with open sandals on her feet, having wooden soles; and she\r\nmade herself a dress from some calico, given her by Mrs. Worrall, in the\r\nstyle of her own which had been embroidered. The late Mr. Bird, the\r\nartist, sketched her, according to this account, as in the engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Caraboo.~]\r\n\r\nThe particulars connected with these recitals, and her general conduct,\r\nwere romantic in the extreme. At the end of two months she disappeared;\r\nand, to the astonishment of the persons whose sympathies she had\r\nexcited, the lady Caraboo a native of Javasu, in the east, was\r\ndiscovered to have been born at Witheridge in Devonshire, where her\r\nfather was a cobbler! A very full account of her singular imposition is\r\ngiven in “A Narrative,” published by Mr. Gutch of Bristol, in 1817, from\r\nwhence this sketch is taken. After her remarkable adventures, she found\r\nit convenient to leave this country. A Bath correspondent writes as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nIn the year 1824, Caraboo having returned from America, took apartments\r\nin New Bond-street, where she made a public exhibition of\r\nherself--admittance _one shilling_ each person; but it does not appear\r\nthat any great number went to see her.\r\n\r\n  Z.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  GENTLE CRAFTSMEN,\r\n\r\n  An opportunity has not occurred, till now, to introduce the following\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~A Lady’s old Shoe, and Clog.~]\r\n\r\nIt was purposed to have been accompanied by others: as it is, indulgence\r\nis craved for it as a specimen of the art and dexterity of our ancestors\r\nin shoe-making and wearing.

The\r\nprincipal scene of his exploits is said to have been in Sherwood Forest,\r\nand the period, that of the reign of Richard I., thus described by\r\nStowe:--\r\n\r\n“In this time (1190) were many robbers and outlaws; among the which\r\nRobin Hood and Little John, renowned thieves, continued in woods,\r\ndispoyling and plundering the goods of the rich; they killed none but\r\nsuch as would invade them, or by resistance for their own defence.\r\n\r\n“The said Robert entertained an hundred tall men and good archers with\r\nsuch spoiles and thefts as he got, upon whom four hundred (were they\r\never so strong) durst not give the onset. He suffered no woman to be\r\noppressed, violated, or otherwise molested; poor men’s goods he spared,\r\nabundantly relieving them with that which by theft he got from abbeys,\r\nand the houses of rich earles: whom Major (the historian) blameth for\r\nhis rapine and theft, but of all thieves he affirmeth him to be the\r\nprince, and the most gentle theefe.”[543]\r\n\r\n“It is said,” writes Baker, “that he was of noble blood, at least made\r\nnoble, no less than an earl, for deserving services, but having wasted\r\nhis estate in riotous courses, very penury forced him to this\r\ncourse.”[544]\r\n\r\nRobin Hood was the hero of many popular songs, several of which are to\r\nbe found in “Evans’s Collection of Old Ballads,” as early as the reign\r\nof Edward III. R. Langlande, a priest, in his “Pierce Plowman’s\r\nVisions,” notices him:--\r\n\r\n    “I cannot perfitly my Paternoster, as the priest it singeth,\r\n    I can rimes of Robenhod and Randal of Chester,\r\n    But of our Lorde or our Lady I learne nothyng at all.”\r\n\r\nHe is reported to have lived till the year 1247; but Baker, in his\r\n“Chronology,” makes his death, which is said to have been caused by\r\ntreachery, to have taken place in the reign of Richard I. “The King set\r\nforth a Proclamation to have him apprehended; it happened he fell sick,\r\nat a certain nunnery in Yorkshire, called Berckleys, and desiring to be\r\nlet blood, was betrayed, and made to bleed to death.”[545]\r\n\r\nThe manner of his death is also recorded in an old ballad, entitled\r\n“Robin Hood and the valiant Knight, together with an Account of his\r\nDeath and Burial.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “And Robin Hood he to the green wood,\r\n      And there he was taken ill.\r\n    And he sent for a monk, to let him blood\r\n      Who took his life away;\r\n    Now this being done, his archers did run,\r\n      It was not time to stay.”\r\n\r\nAt Kirklees, in Yorkshire, formerly a Benedictine nunnery, is a\r\ngravestone, near the park, under which it is said Robin Hood lies\r\nburied. There is the remains of an inscription on it, but it is quite\r\nillegible. Mr. Ralph Thoresby, in his “Ducatus Leodiensis,” gives the\r\nfollowing as the epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    “Hear undernead dis laith stean\r\n    Laiz Robert Earl of Huntington,\r\n    Nea arcir ver az hie sa geude:\r\n    An piple kaud im Robin Heud.\r\n    Sic utlawz as hi, an iz men,\r\n    Wil England never sigh agen.\r\n    Obiit 24 kal. Dekembris, 1247.”\r\n\r\nSome of his biographers have noticed him as earl of Huntingdon, but they\r\nare not borne out in this by any of the old ballads, this epitaph alone\r\ncalling him by that title. All the learned antiquarians agree in giving\r\nno credence to the genuineness of the above composition, alleging, among\r\nother causes, the quaintness of the spelling, and the pace of the metre,\r\nas affording them strong grounds for suspicion.\r\n\r\nHowever strongly the name and exploits of Robin Hood may have been\r\nimpressed on our memories from the “oft told” nursery tales, yet we have\r\nlately had it in our power to become more intimately, and, as it were,\r\npersonally acquainted with this great chieftain of outlaws, through the\r\nmedium of the author of “Waverley,” who has introduced “friend Locksley”\r\nto the readers of his “Ivanhoe,” in such natural and glowing colours, as\r\nto render the forgetting him utterly impossible.\r\n\r\n  HENRY BRANDON.\r\n\r\n  _Leadenhall-street._\r\n\r\n\r\n~Christmas-eve.~\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLMAN’S VERSES\r\n\r\n_Upon Christmas-eve_.\r\n\r\n    This night (you may my Almanack believe)\r\n    Is the return of famous Christmas-eve:\r\n    Ye virgins then your cleanly rooms prepare,\r\n    And let the windows bays and laurel wear;\r\n    Your _Rosemary_ preserve to dress your _Beef_,\r\n    Nor forget me, which I advise in chief.\r\n\r\n_Another on the same._\r\n\r\n    Now, _Mrs. Betty_, pray get up and rise,\r\n    If you intend to make your _Christmas_ pies:\r\n    Scow’ring the pewter falls to _Cisley’s_ share;\r\n    And _Margery_ must to clean the house take care:\r\n    And let Doll’s ingenuity be seen,\r\n    In decking all the windows up with _green_.[546]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remind the reader, that several notices of\r\nthis day have been already presented; yet, many as they are, there are\r\nothers from whence a few may be gleaned, with the probability of their\r\nstill being acceptable.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Leigh Hunt, who is foremost among modern admirers of the old\r\nfestivals of the season, Christmas is, as it ought to be, the chief. His\r\npapers, in 1817, which occasioned the following letter, are not at hand\r\nto cite; and, perhaps if they were, the excellent feelings of his “fair\r\ncorrespondent” might be preferred to some of even _his_ descriptions.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Examiner._\r\n\r\nSir,--I am of the number of your readers who recollect, with pleasure\r\nand gratitude, your papers last year on keeping Christmas, and I looked\r\nforward with a hope, which has not been disappointed, that you would\r\ntake some notice again of its return. I feel unwilling to intrude on\r\nyour valuable time, yet I cannot refrain from thanking you for your\r\ncheering attempts to enforce a due observance of this delightful season.\r\nI thank you in my own name, and I thank you in the name of those to whom\r\nthe spring of life is opening in all its natural and heartfelt\r\nenjoyments. I thank you in the name of the more juvenile part of the\r\nholyday circle, who, released from the thraldom of school discipline,\r\nare come _home_, (that expressive word,) to bask awhile in the eyes and\r\nthe smiles of their fond parents; and, lastly, I thank you on behalf of\r\nthose who have none to plead for them, and to whom pleasure is but a\r\nname--the sick at heart and sick in body, the friendless and the\r\nfatherless, the naked and the hungry. To all of these I hope to extend a\r\nportion of happiness and of help, with a heart full of gratitude to Him\r\nwho has “cast my lot in a goodly heritage.” I have, under this feeling,\r\nbeen for some days past busily employed in preparing for passing\r\nChristmas _worthily_. My beef and mince-meat are ready, (of which, with\r\nsome warm garments, my poor neighbours will partake,) and my holly and\r\n_mistletoe_ gathered; for I heartily approve of your article, and am of\r\nopinion that to the false refinement of modern times may be traced the\r\nloss of that primitive and pure simplicity which characterised “other\r\ntimes.” To your list of “authorities” I beg leave to add that learned\r\nand truly Christian prelate, Bishop Hall, who, in his “Contemplation on\r\nthe Marriage of Cana,” so strongly enforces the doctrine, that the\r\nCreator is best honoured in a wise and _rational_ enjoyment of the\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nCordially wishing you the chief of sublunary blessings, _i. e._ health\r\nof body and health of mind, I remain, Sir, your obliged and constant\r\nreader,\r\n\r\n  A WIFE, A MOTHER, AND\r\n\r\n  AN ENGLISHWOMAN.\r\n\r\n  _South Lambeth, Dec. 21, 1818._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Nichols’s Collection of Poems there are some pleasant verses,\r\nwhich seem to have proceeded from his own pen:--\r\n\r\nTO H----Y M----N, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  _On his refusing a_ CHRISTMAS DINNER _with a Friend, on pretence of\r\n  gallanting some Ladies to Leicester_.\r\n\r\n    When you talk about Leicester\r\n    I hope you’re a jester.\r\n    Why desert an old friend,\r\n    For no purpose or end?\r\n    But to play the gallant,\r\n    With belles who will flaunt,\r\n    And who, cruel as vain,\r\n    Will rejoice in your pain!\r\n    No--Come to our pudding\r\n    We’ll put all things good in\r\n    Give you beef, the sirloin,\r\n    If with us you will dine;\r\n    Perhaps too a capon,\r\n    With greens and with bacon:\r\n    Give you port and good sherry,\r\n    To make your heart merry,\r\n    Then sit down to a pool,\r\n    ’Stead of playing the fool;\r\n    Or a rubber at whist,\r\n    But for this as you list.\r\n    Next, give muffins and tea,\r\n    As you sometimes give me.\r\n    As for supper, you know,\r\n    A potato, or so;\r\n    Or a bit of cold ham,\r\n    As at night we ne’er cram;\r\n    Or a tart, if you please,\r\n    With a slice of mild cheese.\r\n    Then we’ll sing--sing, did I say?\r\n    Yes: “The Vicar of Bray;”[547]\r\n    And, what I know you don’t hate\r\n    “My fond shepherds of late:”[548]\r\n    Nor think me a joker,\r\n    If I add “Ally Croaker.”[549]\r\n    In fine, we’ll sing and delight ye,\r\n    Till you say, “Friends, good night t’ ye.”\r\n\r\n  1780.\r\n\r\n  N. J.\r\n\r\n  Whether these verses were written by Mr. Nichols or not, the mention\r\n  of his name occasions it to be observed, that about a week before the\r\n  present date he died, at the age of eighty-five.\r\n\r\n  The editor of this humble work, who has derived much assistance in its\r\n  progress from the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” which Mr. Nichols edited for\r\n  nearly half a century, would omit to do rightly if he were not thus to\r\n  acknowledge the obligation. Nor can he recollect without feelings of\r\n  respectful gratitude, that his name appeared a few years ago in the\r\n  “Domestic Occurrences” of the “Gentleman’s Magazine” with fidelity to\r\n  its readers, unaccompanied by remarks which some of its admirers\r\n  might, perhaps, at that time have admired. Its critical pages\r\n  subsequently distinguished the volume on “Ancient Mysteries” by\r\n  approval; and since then they have been pleased to favour, and even\r\n  praise, the publication of which this is the last sheet. There was no\r\n  personal intimacy to incline such good-will, and therefore it may be\r\n  fairly inferred to have resulted from pure feelings and principles of\r\n  equity. Mr. Nichols’s rank as a literary antiquary is manifested by\r\n  many able and elaborate works. As he declined in life, his active\r\n  duties gradually and naturally devolved on his successor: may that\r\n  gentleman live as long in health and wealth, and be remembered with as\r\n  high honour, as his revered father.\r\n\r\n  _Dec. 23, 1826._\r\n\r\n  W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASTONBURY THORN.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas-eve, (new style,) 1753, a vast concourse of people attended\r\nthe noted thorn, but to their great disappointment there was no\r\nappearance of its blowing, which made them watch it narrowly the 5th of\r\nJanuary, the Christmas-day, (old style,) when it blowed as\r\nusual.--_London Evening Post._\r\n\r\nOn the same evening, at Quainton, in Buckinghamshire, above two thousand\r\npeople went, with lanterns and candles, to view a blackthorn in that\r\nneighbourhood, and which was remembered to be a slip from the famous\r\nGlastonbury thorn, and that it always budded on the 24th, was full\r\nblown the next day, and went all off at night. The people finding no\r\nappearance of a bud, it was agreed by all, that December 25 (new style)\r\ncould not be the right Christmas-day, and accordingly refused going to\r\nchurch, and treating their friends on that day as usual: at length the\r\naffair became so serious, that the ministers of the neighbouring\r\nvillages, in order to appease them, thought it prudent to give notice,\r\nthat the _Old_ Christmas-day should be kept holy as before.[550]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis famous hawthorn, which grew on a hill in the church-yard of\r\nGlastonbury-abbey, it has been said, sprung from the staff of St. Joseph\r\nof Arimathea, who having fixed it in the ground with his own hand on\r\nChristmas-day, the staff took root immediately, put forth leaves, and\r\nthe _next_ day was covered with milk-white blossoms. It has been added,\r\nthat this thorn continued to blow every Christmas-day during a long\r\nseries of years, and that slips from the original plant are still\r\npreserved, and continue to blow every Christmas-day to the present time.\r\n\r\nThere certainly was in the abbey church-yard a hawthorn-tree, which\r\nblossomed in winter, and was cut down in the time of the civil wars: but\r\nthat it always blossomed on Christmas-day was a mere tale of the monks,\r\ncalculated to inspire the vulgar with notions of the sanctity of the\r\nplace. There are several of this species of thorn in England, raised\r\nfrom haws sent from the east, where it is common. One of our countrymen,\r\nthe ingenious Mr. Millar, raised many plants from haws brought from\r\nAleppo, and all proved to be what are called Glastonbury thorns. This\r\nexotic, or eastern thorn, differs from our common hawthorn in putting\r\nout its leaves very early in spring, and flowering twice a year; for in\r\nmild seasons it often flowers in November or December, and again at the\r\nusual time of the common sort; but the stories that are told of its\r\nbudding, blossoming, and fading on Christmas-day are ridiculous, and\r\nonly monkish legends.[551]\r\n\r\n\r\n“HODENING” IN KENT.\r\n\r\nAt Ramsgate, in Kent, they begin the festivities of Christmas by a\r\ncurious musical procession. A party of young people procure the head of\r\na dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length, a\r\nstring is tied to the lower jaw, a horse cloth is then attached to the\r\nwhole, under which one of the party gets, and by frequently pulling the\r\nstring keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied by the rest of\r\nthe party grotesquely habited and ringing hand-bells. They thus proceed\r\nfrom house to house, sounding their bells and singing carols and songs.\r\nThey are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money.\r\nThis is provincially called a _hodening_; and the figure above described\r\na “hoden,” or wooden horse.\r\n\r\nThis curious ceremony is also observed in the Isle of Thanet on\r\nChristmas-eve, and is supposed to be an ancient relic of a festival\r\nordained to commemorate our Saxon ancestors’ landing in that\r\nisland.[552]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS POTTAGE.\r\n\r\nAmongst the customs observed on Christmas-eve, the Venetians eat a kind\r\nof pottage, which they call _torta de lasagne_, composed of oil, onions,\r\npaste, parsley, pine nuts, raisins, currants, and candied orange peel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSEILLES’ FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\nMany festivals, abrogated in France by the revolution, were revived\r\nunder Buonaparte. Accordingly, at Marseilles on Christmas-eve all the\r\nmembers of any family resident in the same town were invited to supper\r\nat the house of the senior of the family, the supper being entirely _au\r\nmaigre_, that is, without meat,--after which they all went together to a\r\nsolemn mass, which was performed in all the churches at midnight: this\r\nceremony was called in Provence _faire calène_. After mass the party\r\ndispersed and retired to their respective houses; and the next day,\r\nafter attending high mass in the morning, they assembled at dinner at\r\nthe same house where they had supped the night before, a turkey being,\r\nas in England, an established part of the dinner. The evening was\r\nconcluded with cards, dancing, or any other amusement usual on holydays.\r\nFormerly there had been the midnight mass, which was often irregularly\r\nconducted, and therefore on the revival of the old custom it was\r\nomitted.[553]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n    With footstep slow, in furry pall yclad,\r\n      His brows enwreathed with holly never sere\r\n      Old Christmas comes, to close the wained year;\r\n    And aye the shepherd’s heart to make right glad;\r\n    Who, when his teeming flocks are homeward had,\r\n      To blazing hearth repairs, and nutbrown beer,\r\n      And views well pleased the ruddy prattlers dear\r\n    Hug the grey mungrel; meanwhile maid and lad\r\n    Squabble for roasted crabs.

The word _noel_ is derived from _natalis_, and\r\nsignified originally a cry of joy at Christmas.[554]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·87.\r\n\r\n  [541] Stukeley’s Palæographia Britannica, No. 11. 1745.\r\n\r\n  [542] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [543] Stowe’s Annals, 159.\r\n\r\n  [544] Baker’s Chronicles, 94.\r\n\r\n  [545] Ibid.\r\n\r\n  [546] Bellman’s Treasury, 1707.\r\n\r\n  [547] “In good king Charles’s golden days.”\r\n\r\n  This is said to have been written by an officer in colonel Fuller’s\r\n  regiment, in the reign of king George I.

I enclose herein a printed copy of the\r\nplay, which is said, or rather sung, at and about that time, by numbers\r\nof boys in this town. The comedians, of which there are many companies,\r\nparade the streets, and ask at almost every door if the _mummers_ are\r\nwanted. They are dressed in the most grotesque fashion; their heads\r\nadorned with high paper caps, gilt and spangled, and their bodies with\r\nribbons of various colours, while St. George and the prince are armed\r\nwith ten swords. The “mysterie” (query?) ends with a song, and\r\nafterwards a collection is made. This is the only relic of ancient times\r\nwhich exists in this town, excepting, indeed, it be the _Waites_--a few\r\npersons who parade the streets for a fortnight or three weeks before\r\nChristmas, and play upon violins one or two lively jig tunes, and\r\nafterwards call upon the inhabitants for a few pence each. The same\r\npersons, when they hear of a marriage, or of the arrival from abroad of\r\na sea-faring man, regularly attend and fiddle away till they raise the\r\nperson or persons; and for this they expect a trifling remuneration.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied you will join me, in surprise, that for so great a number\r\nof years, such a mass of indecent vulgarity as “Alexander and the king\r\nof Egypt,” should been used without alteration.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of any individual, poor or rich, in this town, and the\r\nday before the funeral, the parish clerk, or the clerk of the church in\r\nwhose church-yard the corpse is to be interred, goes round the town,\r\nwith or without mourning as the case may be, and rings a bell, like a\r\nbellman, and thus announces his purpose: “All friends and neighbours are\r\ndesired to attend the corpse of A. B. from Queen-street to St. James’s\r\nchurch to-morrow afternoon at four o’clock.”\r\n\r\nSome of these hints may be of use to you--if so I shall rejoice; for a\r\nkinder-hearted publication than yours I never perused.\r\n\r\n  For the present I am, Mr. Hone,\r\n\r\n  Yours, most respectfully,\r\n\r\n  AN ADMIRER OF YOUR EVERY-DAY BOOK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tract accompanying the preceding communication is entitled\r\n“Alexander and the King of Egypt; a mock Play, as it is acted by the\r\nMummers every Christmas.

The lessee of the tithes, which belong\r\nto New College, Oxford, supplies a boar’s head dressed, and garnished\r\nwith bay-leaves, &c. In the afternoon, it is carried in procession into\r\nthe Mill Field, adjoining the church-yard, where it is wrestled for; and\r\nit is afterwards feasted upon, at one of the public-houses, by the\r\nrustic conqueror and his friends, with all the merriment peculiar to the\r\nseason. And here it may be observed, that there is another custom, at\r\nthis place, of having a model of an ox’s head, with horns, affixed on\r\nthe top of the eastern end of the chancel of the church. A few years\r\nago it had been suffered to fall into decay; but in the year 1824 it was\r\nrenewed by the present vicar. This church formerly belonged to the\r\nconvent on Mount St. Bernard in Savoy; and it has been suggested, that\r\nthe ox’s head, with the horns, may perhaps be the arms or crest of the\r\nconvent, and that the custom, as well as the name of the place,\r\noriginated from that circumstance. I shall be happy to be informed\r\nwhether this suggestion be founded on matter of fact; and if not, to\r\nwhat other cause the custom can be assigned.\r\n\r\n  IGNOTUS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the ancient doings of Christmas, there is a bountiful imagining, by a\r\nmodern writer, in the subjoined verses:--\r\n\r\n    The great King Arthur made a sumptuous feast,\r\n      And held his Royal Christmas at Carlisle,\r\n    And thither came the vassals, most and least,\r\n      From every corner of this British Isle;\r\n    And all were entertained, both man and beast,\r\n      According to their rank, in proper style;\r\n    The steeds were fed and littered in the stable\r\n    The ladies and the knights sat down to table.\r\n\r\n    The bill of fare (as you may well suppose)\r\n      Was suited to those plentiful old times,\r\n    Before our modern luxuries arose,\r\n      With truffles and ragouts, and various crimes;\r\n    And therefore, from the original in prose\r\n      I shall arrange the catalogue in rhymes:\r\n    They served up salmon, venison, and wild boars\r\n    By hundreds, and by dozens, and by scores.\r\n\r\n    Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard,\r\n      Muttons, and fatted beeves, and bacon swine;\r\n    Herons and bitterns, peacocks, swan, and bustard,\r\n      Teal, mallard, pigeons, widgeons, and in fine\r\n    Plum-puddings, pancakes, apple-pies, and custard\r\n      And therewithal they drank good Gascon wine,\r\n    With mead, and ale, and cider of our own;\r\n    For porter, punch, and negus, were not known.\r\n\r\n    All sorts of people there were seen together,\r\n      All sorts of characters, all sorts of dresses;\r\n    The fool with fox’s tail and peacock’s feather,\r\n      Pilgrims, and penitents, and grave burgesses;\r\n    The country people with their coats of leather,\r\n      Vintners and victuallers with cans and messes;\r\n    Grooms, archers, varlets, falconers, and yeomen,\r\n    Damsels and waiting-maids, and waiting-women.\r\n\r\n  WHISTLECRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBTERRANEAN CHRISTMAS BELLS.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Every-Day Book._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--Near Raleigh, in Nottinghamshire, there is a valley, said to\r\nhave been caused by an earthquake several hundred years ago, which\r\nswallowed up a whole village, together with the church.\r\n\r\nFormerly, it was a custom for people to assemble in this valley, on\r\nChristmas-day morning, _to listen to the ringing of the bells of the\r\nchurch beneath them_!

Formerly, an\r\nagricultural society awarded prizes to the successful candidates for the\r\nbreed of horses, cows, sheep, &c. The _April_ cattle show was entirely\r\nof the male kind, and in every respect calculated to afford pleasure and\r\ninstruction to the naturalist, being replete with variety, form, colour,\r\nand as much beauty as could be found in that part of the animal\r\ncreation; so much so, that in turning from the scene with reluctance,\r\nyou might exclaim, “Accuse not nature, she hath done her part; man, do\r\nthou but _thine_.” Morland, Potter, Cooper, and Bewick[557] might _all_\r\nhave found variety for the exercise of their several powers; and,\r\nindeed, the latter has given portraits of many of the specimens there\r\nexhibited, in his “History of Quadrupeds.” The _October_ show was of the\r\nfemale kind, and inferior to the former. At this meeting, two additional\r\nprizes were given; one to the grower of the finest crop of turnips,\r\nwhich was decided by taking so many rows of a given number of yards in\r\nlength, and weighing them; the other was the sum of ten pounds, to the\r\nperson who could prove that he had reared the largest family without\r\nassistance from the parish. The privilege of contest was confined to\r\nhinds (husbandmen.)\r\n\r\nThe fair is principally for the sale of cattle, and the show is not\r\ngreater than that of Smithfield on market-day, excepting pigs, which\r\nhere and at Stainshaw (Stagshaw) bank fairs supply the principal stock\r\nto the Cumberland and Westmoreland pig feeders. In the morning a\r\nprocession moves from the principal alehouse for the purpose of _riding\r\nthe fair_, as they call it, headed by the two Northumberland pipers,\r\ncalled _the duke of Northumberland’s pipers_, in a light blue dress, a\r\nlarge cloak of the same colour with white cape, a silver half-moon on\r\none arm as a _cognizance_, and white band and binding to the hat. Each\r\nis mounted on a rosinante, borrowed, without consent, by the busy\r\nhostler from some whiskey smuggler or cadger, reconciled to the liberty\r\nby long custom. Those who have noticed the miller and his horse in\r\nStothard’s picture of the “Pilgrimage to Canterbury,” may form a\r\ntolerable notion of the manner in which this “Jemmy Allen” and son are\r\nmounted; the accompanying sketch, from recollection, may more\r\nconveniently illustrate my description:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~“Riding the Fair”--at Avingham.~]\r\n\r\n    And what have those _troopers_ to do here to-day?\r\n    The duke of Northumberland’s _pipers_ are they.\r\n\r\nThe pipers, followed by the duke’s agent, bailiff, constable, and a\r\nnumerous body of farmers, principally the duke’s tenantry, proceed first\r\nthrough the fair, where the proclamation is read, that the fair shall\r\nlast nine days, &c.;[558] and then, the duke being lord of the manor,\r\nthey walk the boundary of all that is or has been common or waste land.\r\nThat task completed, they return to the alehouse with the pipers playing\r\nbefore them, where they partake freely of store of punch at the duke’s\r\nexpense. The farmers are so proud of being able to express their\r\nattachment to his grace “_in public_,” as they term it, that they mount\r\ntheir sons on cuddies, (asses,) rather than they should not join the\r\nprocession, to drink with them “the health o’ his grace, and lang may he\r\nleeve ta pratect and study the interests o’ his tanentry.” Then there’s\r\n“Here’s te ye Tam, thank’s te ye Joke,” and so they separate for the\r\nfair, there to “settle how mickle per heed they con git for their nowte\r\nan swine.”\r\n\r\nAvingham fair, like others, is attended by many a “gaberlunzie,” with\r\ndifferent kinds of amusement for children, such as the “E and O,\r\nblack-cock and grey;” and, above all, for the amusement of the pig\r\ndrivers and “gadsmen,” Punch and Toby, (so called by them,) and a number\r\nof those gentlemen who vomit fire, as if they had swallowed the wicks of\r\nall the candles they had snuffed for Richardson. Many of those worthies\r\nI recollect having attended ever since I was able to see above the level\r\nof their stalls. At my last visit, I was much amused with one who seemed\r\nto have been just arrived from the sister kingdom; he was surrounded by\r\nploughboys and their doxeys, their cheeks as red as their topknots. He\r\nhad a large pan suspended from his neck, and, as the girls observed, a\r\n“skimmering” white apron and bib, and he bellowed as loud as he could,\r\n“Hearse a’ yer rale dandy candy, made ap wa’ sugar an brandy, an tha\r\nrale hoile a mint; it’s cood far young ar hold, cough or cold, a\r\nshortness a’ breath, ar a pain at tha stamach, it’s cood far hany\r\ncamplaint whatsamever; A, fate! an yil try it:--noo leddies, hif ye try\r\nit, an yer sure ta buy it.” And sure enough this was the case, for\r\nwhatever might be its qualities, it pleased the “leddies,” who purchased\r\nin such abundance, that they besmeared their faces so as to destroy that\r\nrosy red, love’s proper hue, which dwells upon the cheeks of our\r\nnorthern rustic beauties.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention that the October fair is more numerously\r\nattended by those who go for pleasure. Unlike the southern holyday\r\nfolks, they prefer autumn for this reason, that “hearst” is just ended,\r\nand they have then most money, which, with the “leddies,” is generally\r\nexpended in dress suitable to this and similar occasions. After baking a\r\nsufficient number of barley bannocks for the following day, and the milk\r\nset up, they throw off their “linsey-woolsey petticoats,” and “hale made\r\nbed-goons” for a gown, a good specimen of their taste, in the two\r\nwarmest colours, a red flower or stripe upon a yellow ground, and as\r\nmuch of a third colour round the waste, as would make them vie with\r\nIris. In this butterfly state they hasten to the scene of mirth, and\r\nmost of them dance till they have reason to suppose it is time to “gang\r\nhame, an git a’ ready be’ crowdie time.” The style of dancing is the\r\nsame as in Scotland, country dances, reels, jigs, and hornpipes; the\r\nlast mentioned is much admired. No merry-making is allowed to pass over\r\nwithout some rural “admirable Crichton” having shown his agility in this\r\nstep. The hornpipe is introduced between each country dance, while “Love\r\nblinks, wit sleeps, an’ social mirth forgets their’s care upon the\r\nearth.” The following day is called by the inhabitants “gwonny\r\nJokesane’s” day; why so is not known; all they know is, that it is and\r\nhas been so called since the recollection of the oldest alive; and that\r\nis sufficient to induce them to continue a custom, which is peculiar to\r\nit, as follows. When a sufficient number have assembled, they elect what\r\nthey are pleased to call a mayor, who they mount upon a platform, which\r\nis borne along by four men, headed by the musician that attended the\r\npreceding evening, and followed by a number of bailiffs with white\r\n“wans,” and all the men, wives, maids, and white-headed urchins in the\r\nvillage. Thus, all in arms, they proceed first to the minister’s house,\r\nand strike up a dance in front. His worship, “the mayor,” as a\r\nprivileged person, sometimes evinces a little impatience, and if the\r\nminister has not made his appearance, demands to speak to him. On his\r\nadvancing, “his worship” begins thus, “A yes! twa times a yes! an’ three\r\ntimes a yes! If ony man, or ony man’s man, lairds, loons, lubburdoons,\r\ndogs, skelpers, gabbrigate swingers, shall commit a parliament as a\r\ntwarliament, we, in the township o’ Avingham, shall hea his legs, an\r\nheed, tied ta tha cagwheel, till he say yence, twice, thrice, prosper\r\nthe fair o’ Avingham, an’ gwonny Jokesane’s day.” This harangue, however\r\nridiculous, is always followed with cheering, in which their\r\ngood-tempered pastor freely joins, with his hat above his head, and\r\nstepping forward, shakes “his worship” by the hand, giving him a cordial\r\nwelcome, trusting he will not leave the manse till he takes a “drap a\r\nyel, a’ his ain brewin.” This is of course acceded to. The ale being\r\nhanded round in plenty, and being found to be good, “an’ what is na guid\r\nthat the minister hes,” they engage themselves for some time, “while\r\nnews much older than their ale goes round.” The musicians meanwhile play\r\nsuch airs as “The Reel Rawe,” “The Bonny Bit,” “Laddie Wylam away,” &c.\r\nThe dance goes round, “the young contending as the old survey,” until\r\nsilence is called, when “his worship” gives as a toast, “Health, wealth,\r\nmilk, and meal, the de’al tak ye a’ thot disent wish him (the minister)\r\nweal--hip! hip! huzza!” Raising “his worship” shoulder height again,\r\nthey proceed round the village, repeating their gambols in front of\r\nevery respectable house where they meet with a similar reception.\r\n\r\nAfter this, foot-racing commences, for hats, handkerchiefs, and (as\r\nMathews calls them) she-shirts. The several races run and prizes\r\ndistributed, they return to the last and gayest of their mirthful\r\nscenes, not without bestowing some little pains in selecting colours\r\ncalculated to give the finishing touches to the picture.\r\n\r\n    “Wi’ merry sangs, an’ friendly cracks,\r\n    I wat they did na weary;\r\n    An’ unco tales, an’ funny jokes,\r\n    Their sports were cheap an’ cheary.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Syne, wi’ a social glass o’ strunt,\r\n    They parted aff careerin,\r\n          Fu’ blythe that night.”\r\n\r\nSo ends the fair of Avingham and its sports, which was to me, “in my\r\nyouthful days,” a source of great amusement, but whether it is in\r\ncomparing the present with the past, from a consciousness of having\r\n\r\n    “Dealt with life, as children with their play,\r\n    Who first misuse, then cast their toys away,”\r\n\r\nthat we do not derive the same pleasure from what passes before us in\r\nmaturer age; or whether, in boyhood, the impressions of such trifles as\r\nI have related are deeper rooted in the memory; yet, certain it is,\r\nwhatever be our situation in life, we all come to the conclusion, that\r\nour early days were our happiest.\r\n\r\n  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  J--N J--K--N.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATH ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n_A Member for the City_, 1645.\r\n\r\nIn December 1645, the following letter was sent by the mayor and first\r\nalderman of Bath, to sir John Harrington, announcing their design of\r\nelecting him one of their representatives, entreating him to accept the\r\ntrouble thereof. The bold eagerness with which a seat in parliament is\r\n_solicited_ now, and the modest coyness that marked the conduct of those\r\nwho were _called_ to that honour in the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, strikingly contrast. The person chosen at that period to\r\nrepresent a county or city, was generally allowed a gratuity by his\r\nconstituents in consideration of his trouble.\r\n\r\n  COPY.\r\n\r\n  _To our muche honoured and worthie Friend, John Harrington, Esq. at\r\n  his house at Kelstone, near Bathe._\r\n\r\n  Worthie Sir,\r\n\r\nOut of the long experience we have had of your approved worth and\r\nsincerity, our citie of Bathe have determined and settled their\r\nresolutions to elect you for a burgess for the House of Commons in this\r\npresent parliament, for our said citie, _and do hope you will accept the\r\ntrouble thereof_; which if you do, our desire is, you will not fail to\r\nbe with us at Bathe on Monday next, the _eighth of this instant, by\r\neight of the morning, at the furthest_, for then we proceed to our\r\nelection: and of your determination we entreat you to certify us by a\r\nword or two in writing, and send it by the bearer to\r\n\r\n  Your assured loving friends,\r\n\r\n  JOHN BIGG, the maior,\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM CHAPMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Bathe, Dec. 6, 1645._\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN’S ACCOUNT OF HIS PROCEEDINGS.\r\n\r\n  _A Note of my Bathe businesse aboute the Parliament._\r\n\r\nSaturday, Dec. 26th 1646 went to Bathe, and dined with the maior and\r\ncitizens, conferred about my election to serve in parliament, as my\r\nfather was helpless, and ill able to go any more; went to the George inn\r\nat night, met the bailiffs, and desired to be dismissed from serving,\r\n_drank strong beer and metheglin_, expended about _iijs_, went home\r\nlate, but could not get excused, as they entertained a good opinion of\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\nMonday, Dec. 28th went to Bathe, met sir John Horner, we were chosen by\r\nthe citizens to serve for the city. The maior and citizens conferred\r\nabout parliament busines. _The maior promised sir John Horner and myself\r\na horse apiece_, when we went to London to the parliament, _which we\r\naccepted of_, and we talked about the synod and ecclesiastical\r\ndismissions.

The magistrates told him he had no\r\nclaim to her, and advised him to deliver her up to her husband, which he\r\nat last reluctantly did. The following is a true copy of the stamped\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\n“RECEIVED of Edward Gale, the sum of four pounds ten shillings, for good\r\nand chattels; and also the black mare and Mrs. Naish, as parting man and\r\nwife.

I think the name is more\r\nappropriate than “Ninepenny-marl;” and moreover, we of Norfolk have the\r\nauthority of our immortal bard in his “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” where\r\nthe queen of the fairies, speaking to Oberon, says, “The _Nine Men’s\r\nMorris_ is filled up with mud.”\r\n\r\nThere are some men who are not a little proud at being proficients at\r\nthis game. I heard an anecdote at North Walsham of a man named Mayes,\r\nstill living in that neighbourhood, who is so great a lover of the\r\npastime, that a wager was laid by some wags, that they would prevent his\r\ngoing to church, by tempting him to play; and, in order to accomplish\r\ntheir purpose, they got into a house, building by the road side, where\r\nMayes was sure to pass. Being a great psalm-singer, he had a large book\r\nunder his arm; they called him in to settle some disputed point about\r\nthe game, and he was very soon tempted to play, and continued to do so\r\ntill church time was over, and got a good scolding from his wife for\r\nbeing too late for dinner.\r\n\r\nI have been led to make these remarks from the pleasure I have derived\r\nfrom your publication; and you may excuse me, perhaps, if I add, with a\r\nsmile, that I have found some amusement in the game of Morris, by\r\nplaying it with my chess men: it requires more art to play it well, than\r\nyou would imagine at first sight.\r\n\r\n  I am, dear sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n  T. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith almost the same pleasure that room has been made for this letter,\r\nfrom a well-remembered kind neighbour, will his communication be read in\r\nNorfolk by his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\n    He graces it from charmed metre, but\r\n    I (spoil’d of Shakspeare’s line) take prose from Strutt.\r\n\r\nThe erudite historian of the “Sports and Pastimes of the People of\r\nEngland,” says, that “_Merelles_, or, as it was formerly called in\r\nEngland, _Nine Men’s Morris_, and also _Fivepenny Morris_, is a game of\r\nsome antiquity.” He gives a figure of the “Merelle-table,” as it\r\nappeared in the fourteenth century, the lines of which are similar to\r\nthose in the scheme of “_Ninepenny Marl_,” engraved with the account of\r\nthe game communicated by *, *, P., with only this difference, that at\r\neach corner, formed by the angles and intersections, are black spots.\r\n\r\nThe game is played in France with pawns or men, made on purpose, termed\r\n_merelles_: hence the pastime derived that denomination. The manner of\r\nplaying is briefly thus: two persons, each having nine men, different in\r\ncolour and form, for distinction sake, place them alternately one by one\r\nupon the spots; and the business of either party is to prevent his\r\nantagonist from placing three of his pieces so as to form a row of\r\nthree, without the intervention of an opponent piece. If he forms a row\r\nhe takes one of his antagonist’s pieces from any part, except from a\r\nrow, which must not be touched if he have another piece on the board.\r\nWhen all the pieces are laid down, they are played backwards and\r\nforwards in any direction that the lines run, but they can only move\r\nfrom one spot to another at one time. He that takes all his opponent’s\r\npieces is the conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe rustic players of “Nine Men’s Morris,” in England, who draw their\r\nlines on the ground, make a small hole for every dot, and play in them\r\nwith stones of different forms or colours. The pastime is supposed to\r\nhave derived the appellation of “Nine Men’s Morris,” from the different\r\ncoloured men being moved backwards or forwards as though they were\r\ndancing a morris.[560]\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 38·70.\r\n\r\n  [557] The small cottage wherein Bewick was born, stands at a short\r\n  distance from this village (Avingham.)\r\n\r\n  [558] It never continues longer than one day.\r\n\r\n  [559] At col. 983.\r\n\r\n  [560] Strutt.\r\n\r\n\r\n~December 31.~\r\n\r\nTO DECEMBER.\r\n\r\n    The passing year, all grey with hours,\r\n      Ends, dull month, with thee;\r\n    Chilled his summer, dead his flowers,\r\n      Soon will his funeral be;\r\n    Frost shall drink up his latest breath,\r\n    And tempests rock him into death.\r\n\r\n    How he shivers! from his age\r\n      All his leaves have faded,\r\n    And his weary pilgrimage\r\n      Ends at last unaided\r\n    By his own sun that dims its ray,\r\n    To leave him dark in his decay.\r\n\r\n    Hark! through the air the wild storm bears\r\n      In hollow sounds his doom,\r\n    While scarce a star its pale course steers\r\n      Athwart the sullen gloom;\r\n    And Nature leaves him to his fate,\r\n    To his grey hairs a cold ingrate.\r\n\r\n    She goes to hail the coming year,\r\n      Whose spring-flowers soon shall rise--\r\n    Fool, thus to shun an old friend’s bier,\r\n      Nor wisely moralize\r\n    On her own brow, where age is stealing\r\n    Many a scar of time revealing:--\r\n\r\n    Quench’d volcanoes, rifted mountains,\r\n      Oceans driven from land,\r\n    Isles submerged, and dried up fountains,\r\n      Empires whelm’d in sand--\r\n    What though her doom be yet untold--\r\n    Nature, like Time, is waxing old!\r\n\r\n  _New Monthly Magazine._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURALISTS’ CALENDAR.\r\n\r\nMean Temperature 37·50.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE INDEXES TO THE VOLUME WILL END THE EVERY-DAY BOOK.\r\n\r\nOn taking leave, as Editor of this work, I desire to express my thanks\r\nfor its favourable acceptation.

Inconsistencies and\r\n  unusual spelling have been retained; French and German accents and\r\n  diacriticals have not been added, except as mentioned below.\r\n\r\n  The source document was mostly, but not entirely, printed in two\r\n  columns, with each column having its own column number. For this\r\n  e-text these columns have been combined into a single page; the page\r\n  numbering used in this e-text (not available in all formats) therefore\r\n  consists of two column numbers per page, as in [151, 152].\r\n\r\n  Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, some\r\n  characters or other elements may not display as intended.\r\n\r\n  The original work has several gaps where numbers are missing or have\r\n  deliberately been left out; these are represented here as blanks.\r\n\r\n  Several entries in the indexes do not refer to the correct pages, and\r\n  some entries are inconsistent in their references; these have not been\r\n  corrected, unless mentioned below.\r\n\r\n  Volume I and Volume III are available at Project Gutenberg as well\r\n  (www.gutenberg.org).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Specific remarks\r\n\r\n  Page 25/26, footnote [13]: Blount’s Plug.

The list of illustrations (page 1709/1710) gives\r\n  the first illustration as being of Jeffery Dunstan, and the second as\r\n  being of sir G. Cooke, M.P. for Garrett, who is not mentioned\r\n  elsewhere in the book.
