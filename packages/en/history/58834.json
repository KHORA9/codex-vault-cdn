All that has preceded it has dealt with the history of London as\r\na whole; now we turn to London in its topographical aspect and treat it\r\nstreet by street, with all the historical associations interwoven in a\r\ncontinuous narrative with a running commentary of the aspect of the\r\nstreets as they were at the end of the nineteenth century, for the book\r\nis strictly a Survey of London up to the end of the nineteenth century.\r\nSir Walter Besant himself wrote the greater part of the volume now\r\nissued, calling it “The Antiquities of the City,” and it is exclusively\r\nconfined to the City. For the topographical side of the great work,\r\nhowever, he employed assistants to collect material for him and to help\r\nhim; for though, as he said, he had been “walking about London for the\r\nlast thirty years and found something fresh in it every day,” he could\r\nnot himself collect the mass of detail requisite for a fair presentation\r\nof the subject. In the present volume, therefore, embedded in his\r\nrunning commentary, will be found detailed accounts of the City\r\nCompanies, the City churches and other buildings, which are not by his\r\nhand. A word as to the plan on which the volume is made may be helpful.\r\nIn cases where the City halls are standing, accounts of the Companies\r\nthey belong to are inserted there in the course of the perambulation;\r\nbut where the Companies possess no halls, the matter concerning them is\r\nrelegated to an Appendix. The churches, however, being peculiarly\r\nassociated with the sites on which they are standing, or stood, are\r\nconsidered to be an integral part of the City associations, and\r\nchurches, whether vanished or standing, are noted in course of\r\nperambulation. A distinction which shows at a glance whether any\r\nparticular church is still existing or has been demolished is made by\r\nthe type; for in the case of an existing church the name is set in large\r\nblack type, as a centre heading, whereas with a vanished church it is\r\ngiven in smaller black type set in line.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the book is simplicity itself; it follows the lines of\r\ngroups of streets, taken as dictated by common sense and not by the\r\nsomewhat arbitrary boundaries of wards. The outlines of these groups are\r\nclearly indicated on the large map which will be found at the end of the\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                      THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GROUP I\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n STREETS NORTH AND SOUTH OF CHEAPSIDE AND THE POULTRY                  1\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP II\r\n\r\n STREETS NORTH OF GRESHAM STREET AND WEST OF MOORGATE STREET          63\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP III\r\n\r\n STREETS BETWEEN MOORGATE AND BISHOPSGATE STREETS                     91\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP IV\r\n\r\n STREETS BETWEEN FENCHURCH AND BISHOPSGATE STREETS                   146\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GROUP V\r\n\r\n THAMES STREET AND THE STREETS NORTH AND SOUTH OF IT                 190\r\n\r\n THE TOWER OF LONDON                                                 288\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP VI\r\n\r\n NEWGATE STREET AND THE STREETS NORTH AND SOUTH OF IT                300\r\n\r\n ST.

CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems convenient in treating of the history and archæology of the\r\nCity to take the streets in groups, each group being in connection with\r\nthe main street to which it belongs. We may in this fashion conveniently\r\narrange the streets as follows:—\r\n\r\n (1) Those north and south of Cheapside and the Poultry.\r\n\r\n (2) Those north of Gresham Street and west of Moorgate Street.\r\n\r\n (3) Those between Moorgate and Bishopsgate Streets.\r\n\r\n (4) Those between Fenchurch and Bishopsgate Streets.\r\n\r\n (5) Thames Street and the streets north and south of it.\r\n\r\n (6) Newgate Street and the streets north and south of it.\r\n\r\n (7) Fleet Street and the adjacent Courts (including the Temple and the\r\n       Rolls).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP I\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cheapside.=—We begin with the true heart of London, West Chepe, as it\r\nwas formerly called, and the streets lying north and south of this\r\nmarketplace. St. Paul’s Churchyard and Foster Lane mark our western\r\nboundary; Princes Street and Walbrook, our eastern; Gresham Street\r\n(formerly Cateaton Street) is on the north, and Cannon Street on the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nBy the time of Queen Elizabeth we find the West Chepe, with its streets\r\nnorth and south, laid out with something like the modern regularity. We\r\nmust therefore go back to earlier centuries to discover its origin.\r\n\r\nWest Chepe, from time immemorial, has been the most important market of\r\nthe City. It was formerly, say in the twelfth century, a large open\r\narea. This area contained no fewer than twenty-five churches, of which\r\nnine still exist. The churches are dotted about in apparent disorder,\r\nwhich can be partly explained. For the market of Chepe was extended in\r\nfact from the Church of St. Michael le Querne on the west, to that of\r\nSt. Christopher le Stock on the east, and lay between the modern Gresham\r\nStreet in the north and Watling Street in the south.\r\n\r\nIt is ordered in _Liber Albus_ that all manner of victuals are to be\r\nsold between the kennels of the streets. The so-called streets were\r\nnarrow lanes, many of which remain to the present day.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a principal way, not a street in our sense of the\r\nword, on either side of which, on the north and on the south, as well as\r\nalong the middle, were stalls and shops. These stalls were at first mere\r\nwooden sheds; the goods were exposed by day and removed at night; in\r\ncourse of time they became permanent shops with living rooms at the back\r\nand an upper chamber. Among the sheds stood “selds.” The seld was a\r\nbuilding not unlike the present Covent Garden Market, being roofed over\r\nand containing shops and store-houses. Several “selds” are mentioned in\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. These were the “great-seld” in\r\nthe Mercery, called after the Lady Roisia de Coventre. This was near the\r\nhouse of St. Thomas of Acon, where now stands the Mercers’ Hall. There\r\nwas also the “great seld of London,” in the ancient parish of St.\r\nPancras, therefore on the south side of Cheapside. There was again the\r\n“seld of Fryday Street serving for foreign tanners, and time out of mind\r\noccupied with these wares”; and there was a seld held in 1304 by John de\r\nStanes, mercer.\r\n\r\nIn the _Liber Albus_ the seld is distinguished from the “shop, the\r\ncellar or solar.” It is also alluded to in the same book as the place\r\nwhere wool and other commodities are sold. Bakers were forbidden to\r\nstore their bread in selds longer than one night. The seld was therefore\r\na warehouse, a weighing place, as well as a shop. Since we hear nothing\r\nabout selds in the _Calendar of Wills_ after the fourteenth century, we\r\nmay infer that a change had been made in the methods of the market. The\r\nchange in fact was this. North and south of what is now Cheapside were\r\narranged in order the stalls of those who sold everything; these stalls\r\nwere protected from the weather; the various branches or departments of\r\nthe market were separated by narrow lanes. It is impossible at this time\r\nto assign all the various trades accurately each to its own place—in\r\nfact, they always overlapped; but we can do so approximately. The names\r\nof the streets belonging to Cheapside are a guide. For instance, Wood\r\nStreet, Milk Street, Honey Lane, Ironmonger Street, Old Jewry, the\r\nPoultry, Scalding Alley, Soper Street, Bread Street, Friday Street, Old\r\nChange, explain a great part of the disposition of the ancient market.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that twenty-five churches stood in or about the great\r\nmarket, and that they were all presumably more ancient than the\r\nConquest, we may deduce the fact that the stalls very early became\r\nclosed shops, and in many cases permanent houses of residence, and that\r\nthe market contained a large resident population by which industries\r\nwere carried on as well as shops. With certain wares, such as milk,\r\nhoney, wood, spices, mercery, salt-fish, poultry, meat, and herbs, there\r\nwas no other industry than that of receiving, packing, and distributing.\r\nWe therefore find few churches between Wood Street and Ironmonger Lane,\r\nthe chief seat of these branches; while on the south side, for the same\r\nreason, there are still fewer churches.\r\n\r\nThe South Chepe was occupied by money-changers, salt-fish dealers,\r\nleather-sellers, bakers, mercers, pepperers, and herb-sellers.\r\nSoap-makers were there also at one time, but they were banished to\r\nanother part of the City before the time of Edward the Second.\r\n“Melters,” _i.e._ of lard and tallow, were also forbidden to carry on\r\ntheir evil-smelling trade in West Chepe so far back as 1203.\r\n\r\nA brief study, therefore, enables us to understand, first, why the\r\nchurches stand thickly in one part and thinly in another; next, that\r\nWest Chepe was a vast open market containing a resident population,\r\ncrowded where industries were carried on, and sparse where the goods\r\nwere simply exposed for sale; and, thirdly, that the place could be\r\neasily converted into a tilting ground, as was done on many occasions,\r\nby clearing away the “stationers,” that is to say, the people who held\r\nstalls or stations about the crosses in Cheapside. On one occasion, at\r\nleast, this was done, to the great indignation of the people.\r\n\r\nThere are certain places in the country, and on the Continent, where the\r\nmediæval market is still preserved in its most important features. For\r\ninstance, there is the market-place of Peterborough, which is still\r\ndivided by lanes, and which has areas allotted to the different trades;\r\nand that of Rheims, where the ancient usages are preserved and followed,\r\neven to the appearance of Autolycus, the Cheap Jack, and the Quack, who\r\nmay be seen and heard on every market day.\r\n\r\nWe may take Stow’s description of the Elizabethan Chepe:\r\n\r\n“At the West end of this Poultrie, and also of Bucklesbury, beginneth\r\nthe large street of West Cheaping, a market place so called, which\r\nstreet stretcheth west till ye come to the little conduit by Paule’s\r\ngate, but not all of Cheape ward. In the east part of this street\r\nstandeth the great conduit of sweet water, conveyed by pipes of lead\r\nunderground from Paddington for the service of this city, castellated\r\nwith stone, and cisterned in lead, about the year 1285, and again new\r\nbuilt and enlarged by Thomas Ilam, one of the sheriffs 1479.\r\n\r\n“About the midst of this street is the Standard in Cheape, of what\r\nantiquity the first foundation I have not read. But Henry VI., by his\r\npatent dated at Windsor the 21st of his reign, which patent was\r\nconfirmed by parliament 1442, granted license to Thomas Knolles, John\r\nChichele, and other, executors to John Wells, grocer, sometime mayor of\r\nLondon, with his goods to make new the highway which leadeth from the\r\ncity of London towards the palace of Westminster, before and nigh the\r\nmanor of Savoy, parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster, a way then very\r\nruinous, and the pavement broken, to the hurt and mischief of the\r\nsubjects, which old pavement then remaining in that way within the\r\nlength of five hundred feet, and all the breadth of the same before and\r\nnigh the site of the manor aforesaid, they to break up, and with stone,\r\ngravel, and other stuff, one other good and sufficient way there to make\r\nfor the commodity of the subjects.\r\n\r\n“And further, that the Standard in Cheape, where divers executions of\r\nthe law beforetime had been performed, which standard at the present was\r\nvery ruinous with age, in which there was a conduit, should be taken\r\ndown, and another competent standard of stone, together with a conduit\r\nin the same, of new, strongly to be built, for the commodity and honour\r\nof the city, with the goods of the said testator, without interruption,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n“Of executions at the Standard in Cheape, we read, that in the year 1293\r\nthree men had their right hands smitten off there, for rescuing of a\r\nprisoner arrested by an officer of the city. In the year 1326, the\r\nburgesses of London caused Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exceter,\r\ntreasurer to Edward II., and other, to be beheaded at the standard in\r\nCheape (but this was by Paule’s gate); in the year 1351, the 26th of\r\nEdward III., two fishmongers were beheaded at the standard in Cheape,\r\nbut I read not of their offence; 1381, Wat Tyler beheaded Richard Lions\r\nand other there. In the year 1399, Henry IV. caused the blank charters\r\nmade by Richard II. to be burnt there. In the year 1450, Jack Cade,\r\ncaptain of the Kentish rebels, beheaded the Lord Say there. In the year\r\n1461, John Davy had his hand stricken off there, because he had stricken\r\na man before the judges at Westminster, etc.\r\n\r\n“Then next is a great cross in West Cheape, which cross was there\r\nerected in the year 1290 by Edward I. upon occasion thus:—Queen Elianor\r\nhis wife died at Hardeby (a town near unto the city of Lincoln), her\r\nbody was brought from thence to Westminster; and the king, in memory of\r\nher, caused in every place where her body rested by the way, a stately\r\ncross of stone to be erected, with the queen’s image and arms upon it,\r\nas at Grantham, Woborne, Northampton, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, St.\r\nAlbones, Waltham, West Cheape, and at Charing, from whence she was\r\nconveyed to Westminster, and there buried.\r\n\r\n“This cross in West Cheape being like to those other which remain to\r\nthis day, and being by length of time decayed, John Hatherle, mayor of\r\nLondon, procured, in the year 1441, license of King Henry VI. to\r\nre-edify the same in more beautiful manner for the honour of the city,\r\nand had license also to take up two hundred fodder of lead for the\r\nbuilding thereof of certain conduits, and a common granary. This cross\r\nwas then curiously wrought at the charges of divers citizens: John\r\nFisher, mercer, gave six hundred marks toward it; the same was begun to\r\nbe set up 1484, and finished 1486, the 2nd of Henry VII.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1599, the timber of the cross at the top being rotted\r\nwithin the lead, the arms thereof bending, were feared to have fallen to\r\nthe harming of some people, and therefore the whole body of the cross\r\nwas scaffolded about, and the top thereof taken down, meaning in place\r\nthereof to have set up a piramis; but some of her majesty’s honourable\r\ncouncillors directed their letters to Sir Nicholas Mosley, then mayor,\r\nby her highness’ express commandment concerning the cross, forthwith to\r\nbe repaired, and placed again as it formerly stood, etc.,\r\nnotwithstanding the said cross stood headless more than a year after.\r\nAfter this (1600) a cross of timber was framed, set up, covered with\r\nlead, and gilded, the body of the cross downward cleansed of dust, the\r\nscaffold carried thence. About twelve nights following, the image of Our\r\nLady was again defaced, by plucking off her crown, and almost her head,\r\ntaking from her her naked child, and stabbing her in the breast, etc.\r\nThus much for the cross in West Cheape” (Stow’s _Survey_, 1633, pp.\r\n278-80).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHEAPSIDE CROSS (AS IT APPEARED ON ITS ERECTION IN 1606).\r\n\r\n  From an original Drawing in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cross was the object of much abuse by the Puritans, who at last\r\nsucceeded in getting it pulled down. “On May 2nd, 1643, the Cross of\r\nCheapside was pulled down. A troop of horse and two companies of foot\r\nwaited to guard it; and, at the fall of the top cross, drums beat,\r\ntrumpets blew, and multitudes of caps were thrown into the air.... And\r\nthe same day, at night was the leaden popes[1] burnt in the place where\r\nit stood, with ringing of bells and a great acclamation” (Wilkinson’s\r\n_Londina Illustrata_).\r\n\r\nTo continue Stow’s account:\r\n\r\n“Then at the west end of West Cheape Street, was sometime a cross of\r\nstone, called the Old Cross. Ralph Higden, in his _Policronicon_, saith,\r\nthat Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exceter, treasurer to Edward II., was\r\nby the burgesses of London beheaded at this cross called the Standard,\r\nwithout the north door of St. Paul’s church; and so is it noted in other\r\nwriters that then lived. This old cross stood and remained at the east\r\nend of the parish church called St. Michael in the Corne by Paule’s\r\ngate, near to the north end of the old Exchange, till the year 1390, the\r\n13th of Richard II., in place of which old cross then taken down, the\r\nsaid church of St. Michael was enlarged, and also a fair water conduit\r\nbuilt about the 9th of Henry VI.\r\n\r\n“In the reign of Edward III., divers joustings were made in this street,\r\nbetwixt Sopers lane and the great cross, namely, one in the year 1331,\r\nthe 21st of September, as I find noted by divers writers of that time.\r\n\r\n“In the middle of the city of London (say they), in a street called\r\nCheape, the stone pavement being covered with sand, that the horses\r\nmight not slide when they strongly set their feet to the ground, the\r\nking held a tournament three days together, with the nobility, valiant\r\nmen of the realm, and other some strange knights. And to the end the\r\nbeholders might with the better ease see the same, there was a wooden\r\nscaffold erected across the street, like unto a tower, wherein Queen\r\nPhilippa, and many other ladies, richly attired, and assembled from all\r\nparts of the realm, did stand to behold the jousts; but the higher\r\nframe, in which the ladies were placed, brake in sunder, whereby they\r\nwere with some shame forced to fall down, by reason whereof the knights\r\nand such as were underneath, were grievously hurt; wherefore the queen\r\ntook great care to save the carpenters from punishment, and through her\r\nprayers (which she made upon her knees) pacified the king and council,\r\nand thereby purchased great love of the people. After which time the\r\nking caused a shed to be strongly made of stone, for himself, the queen,\r\nand other estates to stand on, and there to behold the joustings, and\r\nother shows, at their pleasure, by the church of St. Mary Bow, as is\r\nshowed in Cordwainer street ward” (_ibid._).\r\n\r\nIn 1754 Strype writes:\r\n\r\n“Cheapside is a very stately spacious street, adorned with lofty\r\nbuildings; well inhabited by Goldsmiths, Linen-Drapers, Haberdashers,\r\nand other great dealers. The street, which is throughout of an equal\r\nbreadth, begins westward at Paternoster Row, and, in a straight line,\r\nruns to the Poultry, and from thence to the Royal exchange in Cornhill.\r\nAnd, as this Street is yet esteemed the principal high street in the\r\nCity, so it was formerly graced with a great Conduit, a Standard, and a\r\nstately Cross; which last was pulled down in the Civil Wars. In the last\r\nPart, almost over-against Mercers Chapel, stood a great Conduit; but\r\nthis Conduit, standing almost in the Middle of the street, being\r\nincommodious for Coaches and Carts, was thought fit by the Magistracy,\r\nafter the great Fire, to be taken down, and built no more.”\r\n\r\nThe great Conduit of Chepe, commenced in 1285, brought the water from\r\nPaddington, a distance of 3½ miles. It stood opposite Mercers’ Hall and\r\nChapel. It was a stone building long and low, battlemented, enclosing a\r\nleaden cistern. In the year 1441 at the west end of Chepe and in the\r\neast end of the Church of St. Michael le Querne, the smaller conduit was\r\nerected. Both conduits were destroyed in the Great Fire—the larger one\r\nwas not rebuilt. The Standard opposite Honey Lane was in later years\r\nfitted with a water cock always running. At the Standard many public\r\nexecutions took place (Strype, vol. 1. p. 566).\r\n\r\nHardly any street of London is more frequently mentioned in annual\r\ndocuments than Chepe. There are many ancient deeds of sale and\r\nconveyances still preserved at the Guildhall, relating to property in\r\nChepe. In the _Calendar of Wills_, houses, etc., in Chepe are bequeathed\r\nin more than two hundred wills there quoted; many ordinances concerning\r\nChepe are recorded in Riley’s _Memorials_.\r\n\r\nStow has given some of the history of Chepe. His account may be\r\nsupplemented by a few notes on other events and persons connected with\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of the street is proved by the discovery of Roman coins,\r\nRoman _tesserae_, Romano-British remains of various kinds, and Saxon\r\njewels. It is not, however, until the thirteenth century that we find\r\nhistorical events other than the conveyance, etc., of land and tenements\r\nin Cheapside.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century a part of Cheapside, if not the whole, was\r\ncalled the Crown Field; the part so called was probably confined to a\r\nspace on the east of Bow Church.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1232 we find the citizens mustering in arms at Mile End and\r\n“well arrayed” in Chepe.\r\n\r\nIn 1269 it is recorded that the pillory in Chepe was broken, and so\r\nremained for a whole year by the negligence of the bailiffs, so that\r\nnobody could be put in pillory for that time. The bakers seized the\r\nopportunity for selling loaves of short weight—even a third part short.\r\nBut in 1270, on the Feast of St. Michael, the sheriffs had a new pillory\r\nmade and erected on the site of the old one. Then the hearts of the\r\nbakers failed them for fear, and the weight of the loaves increased.\r\n\r\nIn 1273 the Mayor removed from Chepe all the stalls of the butchers and\r\nfishmongers, together with the stalls which had been let and granted by\r\nthe preceding sheriffs, although the persons occupying them had taken\r\nthem for life and had paid large sums for their leases. This was a\r\npolitical move, the intention being to deprive the stall-keepers of\r\ntheir votes. The Mayor, however, defended the action on the ground that\r\nthe King was about to visit the City, and that it behoved him to clear\r\nthe way of refuse and encumbrances.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1326 a letter was sent by the Queen and her son Edward\r\ncalling upon the citizens of London to aid with all their power in\r\ndestroying the enemies of the land, and Hugh le Despenser in especial.\r\nWherefore, when the head of Hugh was carried in triumph through Chepe,\r\nwith trumpets sounding, the citizens rejoiced.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year when the Bishop of Exeter, Walter de\r\nStapleton, was on his way to his house in “Elde Dean’s Lane” to dine\r\nthere, he was met by the mob, dragged into Chepe with one of his\r\nesquires, and there beheaded. Another of the Bishop’s servants was\r\nbeheaded in Chepe the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the birth of Edward III. on November 13, 1312, the people of London\r\nmade great rejoicings, holding carols, _i.e._ dances and songs, in Chepe\r\nfor a fortnight, while the conduits ran wine.\r\n\r\nIn 1482 a grocer’s shop in Cheapside with a “hall” over it—perhaps a\r\nwarehouse—was let for the rental of £4 : 6 : 8 per annum. The owner of\r\nthe shop was Lord Howard, created Duke of Norfolk in 1483.\r\n\r\nReferences to Cheapside multiply as we approach more modern times. In\r\n1522, when Charles V. came to England, lodgings were appointed for his\r\nretinue. Among them was a house in Cheapside, a goldsmith’s. It\r\ncontained one parlour, one kitchen, one chamber, and one bed. The murder\r\nof Dr. Lambe in 1631, the execution of William Hacket in 1591, the\r\nburning of the Solemn Covenant in 1661,—these are incidents in the\r\nhistory of Cheapside. Many other events belonging either to the history\r\nof the City or of the realm have been mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century one of the sights of London was the Goldsmiths’\r\nRow, built in 1491 on the site of certain shops and selds. Stow calls\r\nthe Row “a most beautiful frame of faire houses and shops consisting of\r\nten faire dwellinghouses and fourteen shops, all in one frame, builded\r\nfoure stories high, beautified towards the street with the Goldsmith’s\r\nArms and the likeness of woodmen, in memory of his name, riding on\r\nmonstrous beasts all richly painted and gilt.” Maitland, who certainly\r\ncould not remember it, says that it was “beautiful to behold the\r\nglorious appearance of the Goldsmith’s shops in the South row of\r\nCheapside, which in a course reached from the Old Change of Bucklersbury\r\nexclusive of four shops only, of three trades, in all that space.”\r\n\r\nComing now to a description of Cheapside as it is at present, we find a\r\nstatue of Sir Robert Peel standing on a block of granite. The whole is\r\nmore than 20 feet in height. The statue was put up in 1855, and on the\r\npedestal is the inscription of Peel’s birth and death. On the north of\r\nCheapside is a large stone block of building in one uniform style with\r\nshops on the ground floor. This contains the Saddlers’ Hall, and in the\r\nmiddle is the great entrance way solidly carried out in stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SADDLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The date of the formation of the Company, and the circumstances\r\n  under which it was founded, are unknown. It existed at a very remote\r\n  period. There is now preserved in the archives of the Collegiate\r\n  Church of Saint Martin’s-le-Grand a parchment containing a letter\r\n  from that foundation, in which reference is made to the then ancient\r\n  customs of the Guild. This document is believed to have been written\r\n  about the time of Henry II., Richard I., or John, most probably in\r\n  the first of these reigns. In this letter reference is made to\r\n  “Ernaldus, the Alderman of the Guild.” This Ernaldus is stated by\r\n  Mr. Alfred John Kempe, in his work _Historical Notices of the\r\n  Collegiate Church of Saint Martin’s-le-Grand_, to have lived before\r\n  the Conquest, by which it may be inferred that the Company is of\r\n  Anglo-Saxon origin.\r\n\r\n  King Edward I., A.D. 1272, granted a charter. King Edward III., by\r\n  his charter 1st December, 37 Edward III., A.D. 1363, granted that as\r\n  well in the City of London as in every other city, borough, or town\r\n  where the art of Saddlers is exercised, one or two honest and\r\n  faithful men of the craft should be chosen and appointed by the\r\n  Saddlers there dwelling to superintend and survey the craft. This\r\n  charter was exemplified and confirmed by Henry VI., Henry VII., and\r\n  Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n  Richard II., by charter 20th March, 18 Richard II., A.D. 1374,\r\n  granted to the men of the mystery of Saddlers of the City of London,\r\n  that for the good government of the mystery they may have one\r\n  commonalty of themselves for ever, and that the men of the same\r\n  mystery and commonalty may choose and appoint every year four\r\n  keepers of the men of the commonalty to survey, rule, and duly\r\n  govern the same. Furthermore, that the keepers and commonalty, and\r\n  their successors, may purchase lands, to the yearly value of twenty\r\n  pounds, for the sustentation of the poor, old, weak and decayed\r\n  persons of the mystery, and this charter was exemplified, ratified,\r\n  and confirmed by Edward IV.\r\n\r\n  Queen Elizabeth, by charter 9th November, 1 Elizabeth, A.D. 1558,\r\n  exemplifies, ratifies, and confirms the previous charters, and\r\n  reincorporates the Company by the name of the wardens or keepers and\r\n  commonalty of the mystery or art of Saddlers of the City of London.\r\n  The charter names and appoints four wardens to hold office from the\r\n  date of the charter until the 14th August then following, and\r\n  authorises them to keep within their common hall an assembly of the\r\n  wardens or keepers or freemen of the same mystery, or the greater\r\n  part of them, or of the wardens, and of eight of the most ancient\r\n  and worthy freemen, being of the assistants of the mystery, and that\r\n  the wardens and eight of the assistants at least being present shall\r\n  have full power to treat, consult, and agree upon the articles and\r\n  ordinances touching the mystery or art aforesaid, and the good rule,\r\n  state, and government of the same. Power is given to elect four\r\n  wardens on the 14th August yearly. Power of giving two votes is\r\n  given to the master at doubtful elections. Powers are also given for\r\n  the government and regulation of the trade.\r\n\r\n  This is one of the most ancient, as it is also one of the most\r\n  interesting, of the City Companies. Their original quarter was at\r\n  St. Martin’s-le-Grand. The saddle played an important part in every\r\n  man’s life at a time when riding was the only method of travelling.\r\n\r\n  The saddlers were connected with the Church of St. Martin’s-le-Grand\r\n  and made some kind of convention with the Canons, the nature of\r\n  which is uncertain. Probably the Canons promised them their aid in\r\n  support of their rights and privileges, in return for which their\r\n  religious gifts and fees were paid to the Church of St. Martin. The\r\n  mystery of saddlery, like all others, overlapped, and encroached\r\n  upon, other mysteries and crafts. Then there followed quarrels. Thus\r\n  in 1307 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 156) there was an affray between the\r\n  saddlers on one side and the loriners, joiners, and painters on the\r\n  other, on account of such encroachments. The quarrel was adjusted by\r\n  the Mayor and Aldermen. Another trouble to which so great a trade\r\n  was liable, was the desire of the journeymen to break off into\r\n  fraternities of their own. This pretension was seriously taken in\r\n  hand in 1796, and such fraternities were strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n  The Company has had three halls, all on the same site. The first was\r\n  burned in the Great Fire; the second in 1822; the present hall was\r\n  built after the second fire, and is at No. 141 Cheapside.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Wood Street is what remains of the churchyard of St.\r\nPeter’s, Westcheap, the building of which was destroyed in the Great\r\nFire: a railed-in space, gravel covered and uninteresting, except for\r\nthe magnificent plane-tree which spreads its branches protectingly over\r\nthe low roofs in front. On the walls of the old houses near are fixed\r\ntwo monuments, and a little stone tablet rather high up, with the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n “Erected at the sole cost and charges of the Parish of St. Peter’s,\r\n    Westcheap, A.D. 1687,”\r\n\r\nfollowed by the names of the churchwardens.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Peter, Westcheap=, was also called SS. Peter and\r\n  Paul. After the Great Fire its parish was annexed to that of St.\r\n  Matthew, Friday Street. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1302.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Abbot of St.\r\n  Alban’s before 1302. Henry VIII. seized it and granted it in 1545 to\r\n  the Earl of Southampton, in whose successors it continued up to\r\n  1666.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 360.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here at the Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary\r\n  by Nicholas de Faringdon, Mayor of London, 1313 and 1320, for\r\n  himself and Rose his wife, to which Lawrence Bretham de Faversham\r\n  was admitted chaplain, October 24, 1361; the endowment fetched £29 :\r\n  3 : 4 in 1548, when Sir W. Alee was priest. There was another at the\r\n  Altar of the Holy Cross.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Munday, goldsmith, Mayor, was buried here in 1527; also Sir\r\n  Alexander Avenon, Mayor in 1569; and Augustine Hind, clothworker,\r\n  Alderman, and Sheriff of London, who died in 1554.\r\n\r\n  The only charitable gifts recorded by Stow are: £2 : 4 : 4, the gift\r\n  of Sir Lionel Ducket; 3s. 4d., the gift of Lady Read; 7s. 6d., the\r\n  gift of Mr. Walton.\r\n\r\n  John Gwynneth, Mus. Doc. and author, was rector here in 1545; also\r\n  Richard Gwent, D.D., and William Boleyn, Archdeacon of Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. MARY-LE-BOW\r\n\r\n  But the ornament of Cheapside is St. Mary-le-Bow, which derived its\r\n  additional name from its stone “bows” or arches. The date of its\r\n  foundation is not known, but it appears to have been during or\r\n  before the reign of William the Conqueror. The court of the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury was held here before the Great Fire; and\r\n  though the connection between the church and the ecclesiastical\r\n  courts has ceased, it is still used for the confirmation of the\r\n  election of bishops. The “Court of Arches” owes its name to the fact\r\n  that it was held in the beautiful Norman crypt which still survives.\r\n  The church has been made famous, Stow observes, as the scene of\r\n  various calamities, of which he records details. In 1469 the Common\r\n  Council ordained the ringing of Bow Bell every evening at nine\r\n  o’clock, but the practice had existed for already more than a\r\n  century; in 1515 the largest of the five bells was presented by\r\n  William Copland. The church was totally destroyed in 1666, as well\r\n  as those of St. Pancras, Soper Lane and Allhallows, Honey Lane; the\r\n  two last were not rebuilt, their parishes being annexed to St.\r\n  Mary’s. Wren began building the present church in 1671 and completed\r\n  it in 1680. The cost was greater than any other of Wren’s parish\r\n  churches by £3000, £2000 of which was contributed by Dame\r\n  Williamson. The steeple was repaired by Sir William Staines in the\r\n  eighteenth century, and again in 1820 by Mr. George Gwilt. In 1758,\r\n  seven of the bells were recast, new ones were added, and the ten\r\n  were first rung in 1762 in honour of George III.’s birthday; the\r\n  full number now is twelve. In 1786 the parish of Allhallows, Bread\r\n  Street, was united with this.\r\n\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1242.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church has always been in the hands of the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury and his successors, but Henry III.\r\n  presented to it in 1242.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 65 feet in length, 63 feet in breadth, and 38\r\n  feet in height; it contains a nave and two side aisles. The great\r\n  feature of the building is the steeple, which is the most elaborate\r\n  of all Wren’s works and only exceeded in height by St. Bride’s. It\r\n  rises at the north-west end of the church and measures 32 square\r\n  feet at the base. The tower contains three storeys. The highest is\r\n  surmounted by a cornice and balustrade with finials and vases, and a\r\n  circular dome supporting a cylinder, lantern, and spire. The\r\n  weather-vane is in the form of a dragon, the City emblem. The total\r\n  height is 221 feet 9 inches. The Norman crypt already mentioned\r\n  still remains, consisting of three aisles formed by massive columns;\r\n  it probably formed part of the building in William I.’s time.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here:\r\n\r\n  By John Causton, to which John Steveyns was admitted chaplain,\r\n  December 2, 1452; by John Coventry, in the chapel of St. Nicholas;\r\n  by Henry Frowycke, whose endowment fetched £15 : 10s. in 1548; by\r\n  John de Holleghe, whose endowment produced £7 in 1548; by Dame\r\n  Eleanor, Prioress of Winchester, whose endowment yielded £4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The original church does not appear to have contained many monuments\r\n  of note. Among the civic dignitaries buried here was Nicholas\r\n  Alwine, Lord Mayor in 1499, whose name is familiar to readers of\r\n  _The Last of the Barons_.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Coventry, Mayor in 1425, was also buried here.\r\n\r\n  There is a tablet fixed over the vestry-room door, commemorating\r\n  Dame Dionis Williamson, who gave £2000 towards the building of the\r\n  church. On the west wall a sarcophagus commemorates Bishop Newton,\r\n  rector, who won celebrity by his edition of Milton first published\r\n  in 1749.\r\n\r\n  The parish possessed a considerable number of charities and gifts:\r\n\r\n  George Palin was donor of £100, to be devoted to the maintenance of\r\n  a weekly lecture.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Banton, of £50 for the same purpose. There were others, to the\r\n  total amount of £60.\r\n\r\n  There was one Charity School belonging to Cordwainer and Bread\r\n  Street Wards for fifty boys and thirty girls, who were put to\r\n  employments and trades when fit.\r\n\r\n  The following are among the notable rectors:\r\n\r\n  Martin Fotherby (d. 1619), Bishop of Salisbury; Samuel Bradford\r\n  (1652-1731), Bishop of Gloucester; Samuel Lisle (1683-1749), Bishop\r\n  of Norwich; Nicholas Felton (1556-1626), Bishop of Bristol; Thomas\r\n  Newton (1704-1782), Bishop of Bristol; and William Van Mildert\r\n  (1765-1836), Bishop of Llandaff, and later the last Prince-Bishop of\r\n  Durham.\r\n\r\nQuaint sayings and traditions have gathered more thickly about St.\r\nMary’s than about any of the City churches. Dick Whittington’s story has\r\nmade the name familiar to every British child; while to be born “within\r\nsound of Bow Bells” is more dignified than to own oneself a Cockney. In\r\nsooth-saying we have the prophecy of Mother Shipton that when the\r\nGrasshopper on the Exchange and the Dragon on Bow Church should meet,\r\nthe streets should be deluged with blood. They did so meet, being sent\r\nto the same yard for repair at the same time, but the prophecy was not\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the Bow bells in the Middle Ages signified closing-time\r\nfor shops, and the ringer incurred the wrath of the apprentices of Chepe\r\nif he failed to be punctual to the second.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the =Poultry=.\r\n\r\nStow thus describes the place:\r\n\r\n“Now to begin again on the bank of the said Walbrooke, at the east end\r\nof the high street called the Poultrie, on the north side thereof, is\r\nthe proper parish church of St. Mildred, which church was new built upon\r\nWalbrooke in the year 1457. John Saxton their parson gave thirty-two\r\npounds towards the building of the new choir, which now standeth upon\r\nthe course of Walbrooke.”\r\n\r\nStrype says of it:\r\n\r\n“The Poultry, a good large and broad Street, and a very great\r\nthoroughfare for Coaches, Carts, and foot-passengers, being seated in\r\nthe Heart of the City, and leading to and from the Royal Exchange; and\r\nfrom thence to Fleet Street, the Strand, Westminster, and the western\r\nparts: and therefore so well inhabited by great tradesmen. It begins in\r\nthe West, by the old Jewry, where Cheapside ends, and reaches the Stocks\r\nmarket by Cornhill. On the North side is Scalding Alley; a large place,\r\ncontaining two or three Alleys, and a square Court with good buildings,\r\nand well inhabited; but the greatest part is in Bread Street Ward, where\r\nit is mentioned.”\r\n\r\nRoman knives and weapons have been found in the Poultry. The valley of\r\nthe Walbrook, 130 feet in width, began its slope here. Nearly opposite\r\nPrinces Street, a modern street, there was anciently a bridge over the\r\nstream. We find in the thirteenth century an inquest held here over the\r\nbody of one Agnes de Golden Lane, who was found starved to death, a rare\r\ncircumstance at that time, and only possible, one would think,\r\nconsidering the charity of the monastic houses, in the case of a\r\nbedridden person forgotten or deserted by her own people. In the\r\nfourteenth century there are various bequests of shops and tenements in\r\nthe Poultry. In the fifteenth century we find that there was a brewery\r\nhere, near the Compter; how did the brewer get his water? In the same\r\ncentury the Compter—which was one of the two sheriffs’ prisons—seems to\r\nbelong to one Walter Hunt, a grocer. In the sixteenth century one of the\r\nrioters of 1517 was hanged in the Poultry; there was trouble about the\r\npavements and complaints were made of obstructions by butchers,\r\npoulterers, and the ancestors of the modern coster, who sold things from\r\nbarrows, stopping up the road and refusing to move on. Before the Fire\r\nthere were many taverns in the Poultry; some of them had the signs which\r\nhave been found belonging to the Poultry.\r\n\r\nThe later associations of the place have been detailed by Cunningham:\r\n\r\n“Lubbock’s Banking-house is leased of the Goldsmiths, being part of Sir\r\nMartin Bowes’s bequest to the Company in Queen Elizabeth’s time. The\r\nKing’s Head Tavern, No. 25, was kept in Charles II.’s time by William\r\nKing. His wife happening to be in labour on the day of the King’s\r\nrestoration, was anxious to see the returning monarch, and Charles, in\r\npassing through Poultry, was told of her inclination, and stopped at the\r\ntavern to salute her. No. 22 was Dilly, the bookseller’s. Here Dr.\r\nJohnson met John Wilkes at dinner; and here Boswell’s life of Johnson\r\nwas first published. Dilly sold his business to Mawman. No. 31 was the\r\nshop of Vernor and Hood, booksellers. Hood of this firm was father of\r\nthe facetious Tom Hood, and here Tom was born in 1798” (_Hand-book of\r\nLondon_).\r\n\r\nHere is a little story. It happened in 1318. One John de Caxtone,\r\nfurbisher by trade, going along the Poultry—one charitably hopes that he\r\nwas in liquor—met a certain valet of the Dean of Arches who was carrying\r\na sword under his arm, thinking no evil. Thereupon John assaulted him,\r\napparently without provocation, and drawing out the sword, wounded the\r\nsaid valet with his own weapon. This done, he refused to surrender to\r\nthe Mayor’s sergeant, nor would he give himself up till the Mayor\r\nhimself appeared on the spot. We see the crowd—all the butchers in the\r\nPoultry collected together: on the ground lies the wounded valet,\r\nbleeding, beside him is the sword, the assailant blusters and swears\r\nthat he will not surrender, the Mayor’s sergeant remonstrates, the crowd\r\nincreases, then the Mayor himself appears followed by other sergeants, a\r\nlane is made, and at sight of that authority the man gives in. The\r\nsergeants march him off to Newgate, the crowd disperses, the butchers go\r\nback to their stalls, the women to their baskets, the costers to their\r\nbarrows. For five days the offender cools his heels at Newgate. Then he\r\nis brought before the Mayor. He throws himself on the mercy of the\r\njudge, sureties are found for him that he will keep the peace, and he\r\nconsents to compensate the wounded man.\r\n\r\nFor Stocks Market, St. Mary Woolchurch Haw, on the site of which the\r\nMansion House stands, and the vicinity, formerly included in the\r\nPoultry, see Group III.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the Poultry is =Grocers’ Alley=, formerly Conyhope\r\nLane, of which Stow says:\r\n\r\n“Then is Conyhope Lane, of old time so called of such a sign of three\r\nconies hanging over a poulterer’s stall at the lane’s end. Within this\r\nlane standeth the Grocers’ hall, which company being of old time called\r\nPepperers, were first incorporated by the name of Grocers in the year\r\n1345.” The Grocers’ Hall really opens into Princes Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GROCERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Company’s records begin partly in Norman-French, partly in Old\r\n  English, as follows: “To the honour of God, the Virgin Mary, St.\r\n  Anthony and All Saints, the 9th day of May 1345, a Fraternity was\r\n  founded of the Company of Pepperers of Soper’s Lane for love and\r\n  unity to maintain and keep themselves together, of which Fraternity\r\n  are sundry beginners, founders, and donors to preserve the said\r\n  Fraternity.”\r\n\r\n  (Here follow twenty-two names.)\r\n\r\n  The same twenty-two persons “accorded to be together at a dinner in\r\n  the Abbot’s Place of Bury on the 12th of June following, and then\r\n  were chosen two the first Wardens that ever were of our Fraternity,”\r\n  and certain ordinances were agreed to by assent among the\r\n  Fraternity, providing that no person should be of the Fraternity “if\r\n  not of good condition and of this craft, that is to say, a Pepperer\r\n  of Soper’s Lane or a Spicer in the ward of Cheap, or other people of\r\n  their mystery, wherever they reside”; for contributions among the\r\n  members, for the purposes of the Fraternity, including the\r\n  maintenance of a priest; the wearing of a livery; arbitration by the\r\n  Wardens upon disputes between members; attendance at Mass at the\r\n  Monastery of St. Anthony on St. Anthony’s Day, and at a feast on\r\n  that day or within the octave, at which feast the Wardens should\r\n  come with chaplets and choose and crown two other Wardens for the\r\n  year ensuing; attendance at the funerals of members; the taking of\r\n  apprentices; assistance of unfortunate members out of the common\r\n  stock; and that “any of the Fraternity may according to his\r\n  circumstance and free will devise what he chooses to the common box\r\n  for the better supporting the Fraternity and their alms.”\r\n\r\n  From external evidence it appears that for two centuries at least\r\n  before 1345 there had existed a Guild of Pepperers, who had\r\n  superseded the Soapers in Soper’s Lane, and probably absorbed them.\r\n  The twenty-two Pepperers, who in 1345 founded the social,\r\n  benevolent, and religious fraternity of St. Anthony, were of “good\r\n  condition,” probably the most influential and wealthy men in the\r\n  Pepperers’ guild; in founding the new brotherhood “for greater love\r\n  and unity” and “to maintain and assist one another,” they did not\r\n  desert their old guild, but formed a new fraternity within it. They\r\n  did not seek, apparently, to alter the institution of the Guild of\r\n  Pepperers, nor did they adopt a distinctive title for themselves;\r\n  but the movement was obviously an important one, and attracted\r\n  notice and jealousy, which was perhaps increased by the foreign\r\n  connections of some of the members. So rapidly did the Company gain\r\n  favour and strength that in 1383, not forty years after its\r\n  foundation, there were one hundred and twenty-nine liverymen of whom\r\n  not less than sixteen were Aldermen. At that time, no doubt, the\r\n  Company exercised a preponderating influence in the City of London.\r\n\r\n  The new brotherhood was styled the Fraternity of St. Anthony from\r\n  1348 to 1357. After this year there is an hiatus in the Company’s\r\n  records, and when these recommence in 1373 the title is “company” or\r\n  “fraternity” of “gossers,” “grosers,” “groscers,” or “grocers.”\r\n\r\n  The origin of the term “grocer” and its application to the Company\r\n  are involved in considerable obscurity. As far as can be\r\n  ascertained, the first use of the word, officially, is against the\r\n  Company from without, and in an aspect of reproach. It occurs in a\r\n  petition to the King and Parliament in 1363, against the new\r\n  fraternity that “les Marchantz nomez Grossers engrossent toutes\r\n  maneres de marchandises vendables.”\r\n\r\n  It is by no means improbable that the term, first suggested by less\r\n  successful rivals in trade, was adopted by the leading dealers “en\r\n  gros” for the name of the company, which formed round the Fraternity\r\n  of St. Anthony, and probably absorbed the whole Guild of Pepperers.\r\n\r\n  From this time forward the Company began to act with energy in the\r\n  interests of trade. In 1394 we find them, together with some Italian\r\n  merchants, presenting a petition to the Corporation complaining of\r\n  the unjust mode of “garbling,” _i.e._ cleansing or purifying spices\r\n  and other “sotill wares.” The petition was entertained, and the\r\n  Company were requested to recommend a member of their own body to\r\n  fill the office, and on their nomination Thomas Halfmark was chosen\r\n  and sworn garbeller of “spices and sotill ware.”\r\n\r\n  The fraternity, after holding their meetings for three years at\r\n  the Abbot of Bury’s, assembled in 1348 at Fulsham’s house at the\r\n  Rynged Hall, in St. Thomas Apostle, close to St. Anthony’s Church\r\n  in Budge Row, Watling Street, where they at this time obtained\r\n  permission to erect a chantry, etc., and called themselves the\r\n  Fraternity of St. Anthony. They ultimately collected at\r\n  Bucklersbury (“Bokerellesbury”), at the Cornet’s Tower, which had\r\n  been used by Edward III. at the beginning of his reign as his\r\n  exchange of money and exchequer. Here the Company began to\r\n  exercise the functions entrusted to them of superintending the\r\n  public weighing of merchandise.\r\n\r\n  In 1411 a descendant of Lord FitzWalter, who, in the reign of Henry\r\n  III., had obtained possession of the chapel of St. Edmund which\r\n  adjoined his family mansion, sold the chapel to the Company for 320\r\n  marks, and in the next reign the Company purchased the family\r\n  mansion and built their Hall upon the site. The foundation stone was\r\n  laid in 1427 and the building was completed in the following year.\r\n  The expenses were defrayed by the contributions of members. Five\r\n  years later the garden was added.\r\n\r\n  In 1428 the Company’s first charter of incorporation was granted by\r\n  King Henry VI., and they became a body politic by the name of\r\n  “Custodes et Communitas Mysterii Groceriæ Londini.” Nineteen years\r\n  later the same king granted to the Company the exclusive right of\r\n  garbling throughout all places in the kingdom of England, except the\r\n  City of London.\r\n\r\n  In 1453 the Company, having the charge and management of the public\r\n  scale or King’s Beam, made a regular tariff of charges. It appears\r\n  that to John Churchman, grocer, who served the office of sheriff in\r\n  1385, the trade of London is indebted for the establishment of the\r\n  first Custom House. Churchman, in the sixth year of Richard II.,\r\n  built a house on Woolwharf Key, in Tower Street Ward, for the\r\n  tronage or weighing of wools in the port of London, and a grant of\r\n  the right of tronage was made by the King to Churchman for life. It\r\n  is probable that Churchman, being unable of himself to manage so\r\n  considerable a concern as the public scale, obtained the assistance\r\n  of his Company, and thus the management of the weigh-house and the\r\n  appointment of the officers belonging to it came into the hands of\r\n  the Grocers Company.\r\n\r\n  Henry VIII. granted to the City of London the Beam with all\r\n  appurtenances, and directed its management to be committed to some\r\n  expert in weights. The City thereupon gave the management to the\r\n  Company, only requiring one-third of the profits. The Company\r\n  enjoyed, uninterruptedly, these privileges up to 1625, when a\r\n  dispute arose with the City, and an agreement was made whereby the\r\n  Company were to appoint four under-porters, and present four\r\n  candidates for Master Porter, the Lord Mayor to choose one of them.\r\n  Several disputes followed with the Corporation, who in 1700 ejected\r\n  the officers appointed by the Company, and tried their right at law.\r\n  No result is reported, but the Company filled up vacancies after\r\n  that date, and up to 1797, when a Bill was passed for making Wet\r\n  Docks at Wapping, and this appears to have had the effect of\r\n  depriving the Company of their privileges.\r\n\r\n  The Company throughout this period kept, in common with others, a\r\n  store of corn, according to ancient custom, for the supply of the\r\n  poor at reasonable prices when bread was dear.\r\n\r\n  The Company was also bound to maintain an armoury at their Hall.\r\n\r\n  At the time of the Great Plague in 1665 the Company were assessed in\r\n  various sums of money for the relief of the poor, and they also\r\n  provided a large quantity of coals.\r\n\r\n  The next year the Great Fire of London inflicted losses on the\r\n  Company from which it did not recover for nearly a century. The\r\n  Company’s Hall and all the adjacent buildings (save the turret in\r\n  the garden, which fortunately contained the records and muniments of\r\n  the Company) and almost all the Company’s houses were destroyed. The\r\n  silver recovered from the ruins of the Hall was remelted and\r\n  produced nearly 200 lbs. weight of metal; this was sold for the\r\n  Company’s urgent present necessities. In 1668 Sir John Cutler came\r\n  forward and proposed to rebuild the parlour and dining-room at his\r\n  own charge. In the same year ninety-four members were added to the\r\n  Livery. The next year a petition was presented to Parliament praying\r\n  for leave to bring in a Bill to raise £20,000 by an equal assessment\r\n  upon the members of the Company of ability. The application to\r\n  Parliament failed, and an effort was then made to raise the £20,000\r\n  among the members, but only £6000 was subscribed.\r\n\r\n  In January 1671 a Special Court was summoned to consider a Bill\r\n  exhibited in Parliament by some of the Company’s creditors, praying\r\n  for an Act for the sale of the Company’s Hall, lands, and estates to\r\n  satisfy debts; and to make members of the Court liable for debts\r\n  incurred. A Committee was appointed and in 1672 the Hall was, at the\r\n  instance of the Governors of Christ’s Hospital, sequestered, and the\r\n  Company ejected till 1679, when, after great difficulties and\r\n  impediments, money was borrowed to pay off the debts and get rid of\r\n  the intruders. In 1680 the Court of Assistants agreed that the most\r\n  effectual way of regaining public confidence was to rebuild the\r\n  Hall.\r\n\r\n  In order to prevent a second sequestration an Inquisition was taken\r\n  in 1680 before Commissioners for Charitable Uses, and, pursuant to a\r\n  decree made by those Commissioners, a period of twenty years was\r\n  allowed to the Company to discharge their debts. The next year, to\r\n  secure an accession of influence and talent for the support of the\r\n  Company, sixty-five members were added to the Court, and a number of\r\n  Freemen were summoned, and eighty-one members added to the Livery.\r\n\r\n  In 1683 the Company arranged, by arbitration, their difficulties\r\n  with the Governors of Christ’s Hospital, and their prospects\r\n  appeared more hopeful when the celebrated Writ of Quo Warranto was\r\n  issued by King Charles II. against the City charters and liberties.\r\n  The Company, with the view of propitiating the King, by deed under\r\n  seal, voluntarily surrendered the powers, franchises, privileges,\r\n  liberties, and authorities granted or to be used or exercised by the\r\n  Wardens and Commonalty, and the right of electing and nominating to\r\n  the several offices of Wardens, Assistants, and Clerk of the\r\n  Company, and besought his Majesty to accept their surrender. Charles\r\n  II. obtained judgment upon the Quo Warranto against the City, and\r\n  all the redress that the Company could obtain was the grant of\r\n  another charter under such restrictions as the King should think\r\n  fit. His successor, James II., with a view to secure the goodwill\r\n  and support of the City, sent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, and\r\n  voluntarily declared his determination to restore the City charters\r\n  and liberties as they existed before the issuing of the Writ of Quo\r\n  Warranto; and subsequently Judge Jeffreys came to Guildhall and\r\n  delivered the charters with two grants of restoration to the Court\r\n  of Aldermen.\r\n\r\n  The history of the Company during the eighteenth century is an\r\n  account of pecuniary difficulties and the gradual extrication by the\r\n  public spirit and foresight of the members.\r\n\r\n  As regards the profession or trade of the members, a return exists\r\n  of the whole numbers for the year 1795 when the Court contained 32,\r\n  the livery numbered 81, and the freemen 228. Of these, 40 were\r\n  Grocers.\r\n\r\n  The number of the Livery returned in 1898 was 183. The Corporate\r\n  Income was £37,500; the Trust Income was £500.\r\n\r\n  The advantages of being a member of the Company are as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Freemen are entitled to apply on behalf of their children for\r\n  the Company’s presentations (six in number) to Christ’s Hospital;\r\n  for the Company’s Scholarships for free education at the City of\r\n  London School. The orphan children of freemen are alone eligible for\r\n  the three presentations to the London Orphan Asylum.\r\n\r\n  Freemen are entitled to take apprentices.\r\n\r\n  Freemen, and widows and daughters of freemen, in needy circumstances\r\n  may apply for relief, either temporary or permanent. Loans to\r\n  freemen are practically abolished.\r\n\r\n  (2) Twelve months after a liveryman has been elected he is entitled,\r\n  provided he live within twenty-five miles of the polling place,\r\n  Guildhall, to be put upon the Register of Voters for the City, which\r\n  entitles him to a vote at the election of Members of Parliament for\r\n  the City; a liveryman is also entitled to vote at the election of\r\n  the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London. The livery receive\r\n  invitations from the Master and Wardens to the four public dinners\r\n  in the months of November, February, May, and July, in each year,\r\n  and at every fifth dinner an invitation for a friend as well.\r\n\r\n  In some years when the honorary freedom of the Company is bestowed\r\n  on distinguished personages, there is an extra public dinner to\r\n  which the livery are invited. At the public dinner in May, called\r\n  the Restoration Feast, a box of sweetmeats is presented to every\r\n  guest. Liverymen, and the widows and daughters of liverymen in needy\r\n  circumstances may apply for relief, either temporary or permanent.\r\n\r\n  The Hall of the Company has always occupied the same site since the\r\n  first erection in 1427, when the Wardens bought part of the demesne\r\n  of Lord FitzWalter in Conyhope Lane.\r\n\r\n  This building perished in the Great Fire of 1666. A new hall was\r\n  built, but in 1798-1802 this building was pulled down and rebuilt.\r\n  Alterations and additions were made in 1827, when the present\r\n  entrance into Princes Street was constructed. There were formerly\r\n  three ways of access to the hall—one from the Old Jewry; one by the\r\n  lane called Grocers’ Alley; and one by Scalding Lane from St.\r\n  Mildred, Poultry, of which a scrap of the churchyard still remains.\r\n  The two lanes opened on a small _Place_ on the north side of which\r\n  was Grocers’ Hall and on the south side the Poultry Compter.\r\n\r\n  The hall destroyed in 1666 would have become by this time historical\r\n  as the place to which the Houses removed from Westminster in 1642\r\n  after the attempt to seize the five members on 4th January of that\r\n  year. The Committee appointed by both Houses met first at Guildhall\r\n  and adjourned to Grocers’ Hall to “treat of the safety of the\r\n  Kingdoms of England and Ireland.” It was in this hall that the City\r\n  entertained the Houses, June 17, 1645, in the midst of the Civil\r\n  War, and on June 7, 1649, when the Civil War was over. For forty\r\n  years, 1694-1734, the Grocers’ Hall was rented and occupied by the\r\n  Governors and Company of the Bank of England.\r\n\r\n  The Company numbered among its members Charles II., James II.,\r\n  William III., the Earl of Chatham, William Pitt, George Canning, and\r\n  many others.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, the “Lane” was chiefly occupied by houses\r\ncalled spunging houses; here persons were confined by the sergeants\r\nbelonging to the Poultry Compter, so that they might come to some\r\ncompromise with their creditors, and not be taken into prison.\r\nHawkesworth, essayist and man of letters, was originally clerk to an\r\nattorney in this court. Boyse, the ragged poet, was confined in one of\r\nthe spunging houses. Here he wrote the Latin letter to Cave:\r\n\r\n                  INSCRIPTION FOR ST. LAZARUS’S CAVE.\r\n\r\n                     Hodie, teste coelo summo,\r\n                     Sine pane, sine nummo;\r\n                     Sorte positus infeste,\r\n                     Scribo tibi dolens moeste.\r\n                     Fame, bile, tumet jecur:\r\n                     Urbane, mitte opem, precor,\r\n                     Tibi enim cor humanum\r\n                     Non a malis alienum:\r\n                     Mihi mens nec male grato,\r\n                     Pro a te favore dato.—ALCÆEUS.\r\n\r\n                     Ex gehenna debitoria,\r\n                     Vulgo domo spongiatoria.\r\n\r\nThe Alley led to an open court. In this open place in 1688 a cart-load\r\nof seditious books was burned.\r\n\r\nThe east side of the Place is at present occupied by one wall of the\r\nGresham Life Assurance Society, a magnificent building facing Poultry.\r\nIt has finely proportioned polished granite columns with Corinthian\r\ncapitals adding strength to the frontage, and a balcony with parapet\r\nrunning horizontally across the front. This was rebuilt in 1879. It\r\nstands on the site of St. Mildred, Poultry.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Mildred, Poultry=, was situated on the north side\r\n  of the Poultry. It was rebuilt in 1456, and, after being destroyed\r\n  by the Great Fire, again rebuilt in 1676, when the parish of St.\r\n  Mary Colechurch was annexed. In 1872 it was taken down, and the\r\n  parish joined to St. Olave, Jewry. The earliest date of an incumbent\r\n  is 1247. The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior\r\n  and Convent of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, 1325; Henry VIII., 1541,\r\n  and so continued in the Crown.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 277.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by Solomon Lanfare or Le Boteler,\r\n  citizen and cutler, at the Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary, to which\r\n  Wm. de Farnbergh was admitted chaplain, October 4, 1337; by Hugh\r\n  Game, poulterer, who endowed it with rents, which fetched £10 in\r\n  1548, when John Mobe was priest; by John Brown, for himself, his\r\n  wife, Margaret his daughter, and Giles Walden, etc., to which John\r\n  de Cotyngham was admitted chaplain, April 6, 1366. One John Mymmes\r\n  had licence from Richard II. to found the Guild of Fraternity of\r\n  Corpus Christi here; the endowment fetched £10 : 8 : 8 in 1548, when\r\n  John Wotton was priest thereof. Here was a “Little Chapell” valued\r\n  at 60s. in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Ashehill was buried here; he gave great help in rebuilding\r\n  the church about 1450; also Thomas Morstead, chirurgeon to Henry\r\n  IV., V., and VI., and one of the sheriffs of London. In more recent\r\n  times, Wm. Cronne was commemorated; he was a Fellow of the Royal\r\n  Society and of the College of Physicians, and died in 1706.\r\n\r\n  A great number of benefactors are recorded by Stow, of which the\r\n  most notable are: William Watson, of £100, whereof £65 was received;\r\n  William Tudman, of £247 in all, for various charities; Sarah Tudman,\r\n  of £80; Lady Elizabeth Allington, £200, towards rebuilding.\r\n\r\n  One free school is recorded, called Mercers’ School (Stow).\r\n\r\n  John Williams (d. 1709), Bishop of Chichester, 1696, was rector\r\n  here; also Benjamin Newcome, D.D., Dean of Rochester.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Grocers’ Hall Court stood the =Poultry Compter=.\r\n\r\nStrype describes the place and its government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. MILDRED, POULTRY\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Somewhat west to this Church is the Poultry Compter, being the Prison\r\nbelonging to one of the Sheriffs of London, for all such as are arrested\r\nwithin the City and liberties thereof. And, besides this Prison, there\r\nis another of the same Nature in Wood Street for the other Sheriff; both\r\nbeing of the same nature, and have the like officers for the Execution\r\nof the concerns belonging thereunto, as shall be here taken notice of.\r\nSo that what is said here for Poultry Compter, belongs also to Wood\r\nStreet Compter.\r\n\r\n“The Charge of those prisons is committed to the Sheriffs.\r\n\r\n“Unto each Compter also belongs a Master Keeper; and under him two\r\nTurnkeys, and other servitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INSIDE THE POULTRY COMPTER\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The poorer sort of prisoners, as well in this Compter, as in that in\r\nWood Street, receive daily relief from the sheriff’s table, of all the\r\nbroken meat and bread. And there are divers gifts given by several well\r\ndisposed people, towards their subsistence. Besides which, there are\r\nother benevolences frequently sent to all the prisons by charitable\r\npersons; many of which do conceal their names, doing it only for charity\r\nsake. And there are other gifts, some for the releasement of such as lie\r\nin only for prison fees; and others, for the release of such, whose\r\ndebts amount not to above such or such a sum” (Strype, vol. i. p. 567).\r\n\r\nThis was the only prison in London with a ward set apart for Jews. “Here\r\ndied Lamb, the conjuror (commonly called Dr. Lamb), of the injuries he\r\nhad received from the mob, who pelted him (June 13, 1628), from Moorgate\r\nto the Windmill in the Old Jewry, where he was felled to the ground with\r\na stone, and was thence carried to the Poultry Compter, where he died\r\nthe same night. The rabble believed that the doctor dealt with the\r\ndevil, and assisted the Duke of Buckingham in misleading the king. The\r\nlast slave imprisoned in England was confined (1772) in the Poultry\r\nCompter. This was Somerset, a negro, the particulars of whose case\r\nexcited Sharpe and Clarkson in their useful and successful labour in the\r\ncause of negro emancipation” (Cunningham’s _Hand-book of London_).\r\n\r\nWhen Whitecross Street Prison (1815-1870) was erected, the prisoners\r\nwere removed there from the Poultry, and the site of the Compter was\r\nbuilt upon partly by a Congregational Chapel, the congregation of which\r\nremoved to the Holborn Viaduct when the City Temple was built.\r\n\r\nThe prison was burned down in the Fire, whereupon the prisoners were\r\ntaken to Aldgate until it was rebuilt. It was an ill-kept, unventilated,\r\nnoisome place.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the earliest bequest to the Compter mentioned\r\nin the _Calendar of Wills_ belongs to the fifteenth century, and that\r\nmost of the legacies to the prisoners were made after the Reformation\r\nand in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In some of them we find mention of\r\nthe “Hole” and of the “Twopenny Ward.”\r\n\r\nIn 1378 there was an altercation between the Mayor and one of the\r\nsheriffs. Allusion is made to that sheriff’s “own compter” in Milk\r\nStreet, which may be taken for that of Wood Street, as the Compter lay\r\nbetween the two, though it stood in Bread Street until the year 1555. In\r\nthe year 1382 a sumptuary law was issued restricting the dress of women\r\nof loose life, and those who offended were to be taken to one of the\r\nCompters. In 1388 we find the porter of a Compter insulting Adam Bamme,\r\nalderman, for which he was removed from his office. We find also a\r\nhouseholder taken to the Compter for refusing to pay his rates and\r\nabusing the collector. In 1413, an old man named John Arkwythe, a\r\nscrivener, was summoned by Alderman Sevenoke for allowing the escape of\r\na certain priest caught in adultery in St. Bride’s Church. John Arkwythe\r\nlost his temper, clutched the Alderman by the breast and threatened him.\r\nThey sent him to Newgate, but, considering his age, they let him go,\r\nonly depriving him of the freedom of the City. In 1418, one William\r\nFoucher, for contempt of Court, was sent to solitary imprisonment in the\r\nCompter, and prohibited from speaking to any one except those who should\r\ncounsel him repentance and amendment.\r\n\r\nFrom these cases it would appear that the Compters were used partly as\r\nhouses of detention before trial, and that trial was frequently deferred\r\nin order that the offender might endure a term of imprisonment in\r\naddition to the pillory, or the release on finding security, which would\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nWest of Grocers’ Alley is the =Old Jewry=, one of the most interesting\r\nplaces in the whole of London on account of its having been the Ghetto,\r\nthough not a place of humiliation, for the Jews of London. When they\r\ncame to London they received this quarter for their residence; why this\r\nplace, so central, so convenient for the despatch of business, was\r\nassigned to them, no one has been able to discover. In the learned work\r\nof Mr. Joseph Jacobs (_The Jews of Angevin England_) he shows that Jews\r\nwere in Oxford and Cambridge as well as in London in the time of the\r\nNormans.\r\n\r\nThe older name of the street was Colechurch Street. In the Receipts and\r\nPerquisites of the Tower from the Jews of London are found the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n For two pounds found in the Jewry for\r\n   forfeit                                         60s.\r\n\r\n[The sense of this entry is doubtful. Perhaps the two pounds were\r\nforfeited and 60 is wrongly transcribed for 40 (lx. for xl.).]\r\n(Guildhall MS. 129, vol. ii. p. 95_a_.)\r\n\r\n From a certain Christian woman found in the\r\n   Jewry for the purpose of making an\r\n   exchange. She fled and threw away the\r\n   money                                          100s. (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n From a certain goldsmith fighting in the\r\n   Jewry, of a fine                                21s. (_ibid._ p. 96).\r\n From Nicholas, the convert, goldsmith of\r\n   London, for his boys fighting in the Jewry     100s. (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n From a certain Christian found in the Jewry\r\n   by night                                   7s. 11½d. (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n From a certain boy coming into the Jewry      66s. 8d. (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n From John of Lincoln because he was found in\r\n   the Jewry by night                                £6 (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n From a certain Christian woman in the Jewry\r\n   by night                                        18s. (_ibid._ p. 97).\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the Jewry was walled in with gates. Had it been a\r\nsimple street, a thoroughfare, there could have been no objection to any\r\none passing through. As for the teaching of the Church respecting Jews,\r\nthese extracts from Mr. Jacob’s book will show the hatred which was\r\ninculcated towards them.\r\n\r\n“If any Christian woman takes gifts from the infidel Jews or of her own\r\nwill commits sin with them, let her be separated from the church a whole\r\nyear and live in much tribulation, and then let her repent for nine\r\nyears. But if with a pagan let her repent seven years.\r\n\r\n“If any Christian accepts from the infidel Jews their unleavened cakes\r\nor any other meat or drink and share in their impieties, he shall do\r\npenance with bread and water for forty days; because it is written ‘to\r\nthe pure all things are pure.’\r\n\r\n“It is allowable to celebrate mass in a church where faithful and pious\r\nones have been buried. But if infidels or heretics or faithless Jews be\r\nburied, it is not allowed to sanctify or celebrate mass; but if it seem\r\nsuitable for consecration, tearing thence the bodies or scraping or\r\nwashing the walls, let it be consecrated if it has not been so\r\npreviously.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of the Jews occurs in the _Terrier of St. Paul’s_,\r\n1115:\r\n\r\n“In the ward of Haco ... in the Jew’s street (?Old Jewry) the land of\r\nLusbert, in the front on the west side, is 32 feet in breadth. Towards\r\nSt. Olave’s is fourscore and fifteen feet; again towards St. Olave’s is\r\n65 feet, and in the front 13 feet. The land in the front is 73 feet, and\r\nin depth 41 feet, and pays 10s.”\r\n\r\nIn 1264, and again in 1267, the popular hatred of the Jews broke out\r\nwith unmistakable violence. They fled to the Tower, while the mob\r\ndestroyed and sacked their buildings.\r\n\r\nIn 1290 they were banished.\r\n\r\nTheir synagogue, which stood in the north-east corner of the present\r\nstreet, was given to the Fratres de Saccâ (see _Mediæval London_, vol.\r\nii. p. 365), and on their dissolution it was ceded to Robert FitzWalter\r\nand converted into a merchant’s residence. Here lived and died Robert\r\nLarge to whom Caxton was apprenticed.\r\n\r\nThe later history of the street may be quoted from Cunningham:\r\n\r\n“The last turning but two on the east side (walking towards Cateaton\r\nStreet) was called Windmill Court, from the Windmill Tavern, mentioned\r\nin the curious inventory of ‘Innes for Horses seen and viewed,’\r\npreparatory to the visit of Charles V. of Spain to Henry VIII., in the\r\nyear 1522. ‘From the Windmill,’ in the old Jewry, Master Wellbred writes\r\nto Master Knowell, in Ben Jonson’s play of _Every Man in his Humour_.\r\nKitely, in the same play, was a merchant in the Old Jewry. The house or\r\npalace of Sir Robert Clayton (of the time of Charles II.), on the east\r\nside, was long a magnificent example of a merchant’s residence,\r\ncontaining a superb banquetting-room, wainscotted with cedar, and\r\nadorned with battles of gods and giants. Here the London Institution was\r\nfirst lodged; and here, in the rooms he occupied as librarian, Professor\r\nPorson died (1808). Dr. James Foster, Pope’s ‘modest Foster’—\r\n\r\n                  Let modest Foster, if he will, excel\r\n                  Ten Metropolitans in preaching well—\r\n\r\nwas a preacher in the Old Jewry for more than twenty years. He first\r\nbecame popular from Lord Chancellor Hardwicke stopping in the porch of\r\nhis chapel in the Old Jewry, to escape from a shower of rain. Thinking\r\nhe might as well hear what was going on, he went in, and was so well\r\npleased that he sent all his great acquaintances to hear Foster.”\r\n\r\nAlexander Brown, the cavalier song-writer, was an attorney in the Lord\r\nMayor’s Court in this street, and Bancroft, who built the almshouses of\r\nMile End, was an officer in the court. Sir Jeffrey Bullen, Lord Mayor,\r\n1457, lived in this street, where he was a mercer.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century there was standing in Old Jewry, north of St.\r\nOlave’s Church, and extending to the north end of Ironmonger Lane and\r\ndown the lane as far as St. Martin’s Church, a large building of stone\r\n“very ancient,” the history and purpose of which were unknown except\r\nthat Henry VI. appointed one John Stert, keeper of the place, which he\r\ncalled his principal palace in the Old Jewry. It was standing when Stow\r\nwas a boy, but he says the outward stone-work was little by little taken\r\ndown, and houses built upon the site. It was known as the Old Wardrobe.\r\nI know of no other reference to this place, but one would like to learn\r\nmore. The taking away of the stone “little by little” accounts in like\r\nmanner for the gradual disappearance of the ruins of the monastic\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe modern street is not of much interest. The City Police Office is in\r\na court of some size near the north end. The Old King’s Head is in an\r\nelaborate building faced with red sandstone, and a grimy blackened old\r\nbrick house close by contains the Italian Consulate.\r\n\r\nIn Frederick Place are two rows of Georgian houses in dull brick,\r\nvarying only slightly in detail. The iron link-holders of a past fashion\r\nstill survive on the railings before some of the houses. No. 8, at the\r\nsouth-eastern corner, contains some curious and interesting mantels. One\r\nof these has a central panel representing a boar hunt; this is in relief\r\nenclosed in a large oval. There are fine details also in other\r\nfireplaces in the house.\r\n\r\nBut these are not the only objects of interest in Frederick Place, for\r\nin exactly the opposite corner, the north-west, in a house numbered 4,\r\nare one or two fireplaces which surpass these in beauty if not in\r\nquaintness. In one of the rooms there is a very high and\r\nwell-proportioned white marble mantelpiece, with singularly little\r\ndecoration, which is yet most effective. All these houses are now used\r\nas offices by business men, and the evidences of bygone domestic\r\noccupation add a human interest to the daily routine.\r\n\r\n  =St. Mary Colechurch= was situated in the Poultry at the south-west\r\n  corner of the Old Jewry. It was burnt down in the Great Fire, and\r\n  not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of St. Mildred,\r\n  Poultry. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1252.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of Henry III., who\r\n  presented to it one Roger de Messendene, April 21, 1252; then the\r\n  Master and Brethren of St. Thomas de Acon; afterwards Henry VIII.,\r\n  who granted it to the Mercer’s Company, April 21, 1542.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 220.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by Thomas de Cavendish, late citizen and\r\n  mercer, at the Altar of St. Katherine, to which Roger de Elton was\r\n  instituted chaplain, March 15, 1362-63; Agnes Fenne, who left by\r\n  Will, dated March 28, 1541, £140 to maintain a priest for twenty\r\n  years; Henry IV. granted a licence to William Marechalcap and others\r\n  to found a Fraternity in honour of St. Katherine, February 19,\r\n  1399-1400; a further licence was granted by Henry VI., June 19,\r\n  1447, the endowment of which fetched £9 in 1548, when Robert Evans\r\n  was Chaplain.\r\n\r\n  No monuments are recorded by Stow. In this church St. Thomas à\r\n  Becket and St. Edmund were baptized. The parish had one gift-sermon,\r\n  but no other gifts or legacies are recorded.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Horton (d. 1673), Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, 1649, was a\r\n  rector here.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Olave, Jewry=, stood on the west side, near the\r\n  middle of Old Jewry, and was sometimes called St. Olave, Upwell. It\r\n  was destroyed in the Great Fire and rebuilt in 1673. It was\r\n  subsequently taken down. The tower, which alone was left, is now\r\n  part of a dwelling-house. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1252.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s, who granted it in 1171 to the Prior and Convent of\r\n  Butley, Suffolk, when it became a vicarage. Henry VIII. seized it,\r\n  and so it continues in the Crown.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 198.\r\n\r\n  The open space, belonging to the ancient graveyard, abuts on\r\n  Ironmonger Lane.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by John Brian, rector, who died in 1322,\r\n  and a licence was granted by the King, August 20, 1323; Robert de\r\n  Burton, chaplain, exchanged with William de Aynho, June 15, 1327. In\r\n  1548 the endowment fetched £13 : 1 : 4.\r\n\r\n  Robert Large, Mayor in 1440, and donor of £200 to the church, was\r\n  buried here. Among the later monuments is one in memory of Sir\r\n  Nathaniel Herne, Governor of the East India Company; he died 1679.\r\n\r\n  The church was not rich in charitable gifts and legacies. Among the\r\n  benefactors, Sir Thomas Hewet gave £5 : 4s. yearly; Henry Lo gave\r\n  £10 for ever; Gervase Vaughan gave a house, rented at £14 per annum,\r\n  to provide bread for the poor every Sunday.\r\n\r\n  On the west side of Old Jewry there was a free school, said to be\r\n  founded by Thomas à Becket in 1160, for 25 scholars. There were two\r\n  almshouses for 9 poor widows of armourers, each of whom received 6s.\r\n  per quarter, and 9 bushels of coal a year; those past labour\r\n  received £1 a quarter. These were the gift of Mr. Tindal, citizen\r\n  and armourer of London.\r\n\r\n  Anthony Ellys, D.D. (1690-1761), Bishop of St. David’s, was rector,\r\n  also Joseph Holden Pott (1759-1847), Archdeacon of London.\r\n\r\nOld Jewry runs through into Gresham Street, which is roughly parallel\r\nwith Cheapside.\r\n\r\n=Gresham Street=, formerly called Catte, Cateaton, or Ketton Street, or\r\nCattling Street, when changed to its present name also swallowed up Lad\r\nLane and Maiden Lane.\r\n\r\nCatte Street is mentioned in a deed dated the Saturday after Ascension\r\n1294, in which Hugh de Vyenne, Canon of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, grants to\r\nthe master and scholars of Balliol, _inter alia_, four shillings of\r\nyearly rent from the tenement held by Martin the arbitrator, in Catte\r\nStreet, opposite the church of St. Lawrence, also the same amount from\r\nthe tenement of Adam de Horsham opposite the church.\r\n\r\nOn the Feast of Ascension in the year 1360 a case of great interest was\r\nheard at the Hustings of common pleas.\r\n\r\nIn this case, John de Wyclif, Master of Balliol, Oxford, was attached to\r\nmake answer to Nicholas Marchant in a plea of distresses taken. Wyclif\r\nis accused of having made an unlawful seizure upon the freehold of\r\nNicholas in the parish of St. Lawrence, Jewry, on Wednesday after the\r\nFeast of St. Gregory that year. From the pleading it appears that the\r\nhouse was once the property of “one Thippe, wife of Isaac of Suthwerk, a\r\nJewess”; after her exit from England it came to King Edward, grandfather\r\nof Edward III. Their tenement in Catte Street was given (so the\r\npleadings show) by that king to Adam de Horsham, mercer, uncle of\r\nNicholas above named, at a rent of one penny per annum to the King.\r\nWyclif joins the suit. Nicholas has to pay arrears and is amerced\r\n[hitherto Wyclif’s mastership of Balliol was ascribed to date from 1361,\r\nhence the importance of this MS.] (Historical MS. Commission, Report\r\nIV., p. 448).\r\n\r\nThere is another ancient mention of Catte Street, belonging to the year\r\n1281, in which one Aaron, a wealthy Jew and a money-lender, contracts\r\nwith Rudolph the mason for the building of a house in Catte Street.\r\n\r\nFrom Aldermanbury westward to Wood Street, Gresham Street was formerly\r\ncalled Lad Lane. The name occurs certainly as early as 1301, as\r\ncontaining a house belonging to Coke Bateman, a Jew. It is first found\r\nin the _Calendar of Wills_ in 1362, after which we hear no more of it\r\ntill 1419. Here a Roman pavement was found.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the old coaching inns, the Swan with two\r\nNecks, stood in Lad Lane. From this place an amazing number of coaches\r\nand wagons set out every day. The sign is still to be seen over the\r\nentrance to the London and South Western Railway Company’s yard.\r\n\r\nThe street was widened in 1845. It has a picturesque appearance, for the\r\nhouses project irregularly at the corners of the cross streets. The\r\nChurch of St. Lawrence occupies part of the north side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. LAWRENCE, JEWRY\r\n\r\n  The date of the foundation of St. Laurence or Lawrence, Jewry, is\r\n  not known, but the church was burnt down by the Great Fire, and\r\n  rebuilt by Wren 1671-76, when the parish of St. Mary Magdalene was\r\n  annexed. The new building was erected at the expense of the\r\n  parishioners, assisted by a liberal subscription from Sir John\r\n  Langham. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1321. The patronage of\r\n  the church was in the hands of Henry de Wickenbroke, who, May 30,\r\n  1294, gave the Rectory to Balliol College, Oxford, when a Vicarage\r\n  was here ordained, and in this college it still continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 148.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 82 feet in length, 71 feet in breadth, and 39\r\n  feet in height. It contains only one aisle, on the north side,\r\n  separated from the rest of the building by Corinthian columns. Above\r\n  the columns is a richly worked entablature, which is continued all\r\n  round the church. The east front has a façade formed by four\r\n  Corinthian columns with entablature, supporting the pediment. The\r\n  tower, which is three storied, is surmounted by a square turret,\r\n  supporting a square pedestal, and above this by an octagonal\r\n  spirelet with a ball and vane; the vane is in the form of St.\r\n  Laurence’s emblem, the gridiron. The total height is 160 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For William de Kancia at the Altar of\r\n  St. John, July 10, 1321; by Thomas Wytton at the Altar of Virgin\r\n  Mary, the endowment of which fetched £8 : 4 : 8 in 1548, when Thomas\r\n  Sandlord was chaplain; by William Myldreth at the Altar of St.\r\n  Michael the Archangel, the endowment of which yielded £7 : 6 : 8 in\r\n  1548, when Rowland Robynsonne was chaplain; by Simon Bonyngton,\r\n  whose endowment fetched £22 : 13 : 4 in 1548 when Thomas Sylvester\r\n  was chaplain; by Simon Bartlett, whose endowment yielded £5 : 4 : 8\r\n  in 1548, when Thomas Ballard was chaplain; by Simon Gosseham, for\r\n  two chaplains, whose endowment fetched £14 : 6 : 8 in 1548, when\r\n  Thomas Begley and Henry Whorleston were the priests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  ST. LAWRENCE, JEWRY\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The old church was the burying-place of a considerable number of\r\n  eminent citizens. Among them were: Richard Rich, ancestor of the\r\n  Earls of Warwick and Holland, who died in 1469; Sir Geffney Bullen,\r\n  Lord Mayor in 1459 and great-great-grandfather to Queen Elizabeth;\r\n  Sir Richard Gresham, Lord Mayor in 1537 and father of Sir Thomas\r\n  Gresham; Sir Michael Dormer, Lord Mayor in 1541; Roger Thorney, who\r\n  founded a Fellowship at Jesus College, Cambridge; Dame Alice Avenon,\r\n  a benefactress to the parish. Against the west wall there is a\r\n  monument displaying three busts, in memory of Alderman Sir William\r\n  Halliday, sheriff in 1617; this was erected in 1687 by Dame Margaret\r\n  Hungerford in place of that destroyed by the Fire. Dr. John Wilkins,\r\n  Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and vicar here in 1662, was\r\n  buried under the north wall of the chancel. There are monuments also\r\n  to John Tillotson, lecturer here for some years, and to Dr. Benjamin\r\n  Whichcote, the celebrated preacher, who succeeded Wilkins as vicar.\r\n  On the western part of the south wall a large monument commemorates\r\n  Mrs. Sarah Scott, who died in 1750, leaving £700 for parish\r\n  purposes. Sir John Langham was a donor of £250 for the purpose of\r\n  church repairing, etc., and no gifts or bequests belonging to the\r\n  parish are recorded by Stow, except two weekly lectures each at £30\r\n  per annum, the donors of which are not stated by him. There was one\r\n  Grammar School, kept over the vestry. William Bell, Master of\r\n  Balliol College, Oxford, in 1494 was a rector here; also William\r\n  White, Master of Balliol College, Oxford 1125-39; Edward Reynolds\r\n  (1629-1698), Bishop of Norwich; Seth Ward (1617-1689), Bishop of\r\n  Exeter; John Mapletoft (1631-1721), President of Zion College; and\r\n  Benjamin Morgan Cowie (1816-1900), Dean of Exeter.\r\n\r\nGresham College stands at the end of a row of uniform plaster-faced\r\nhouses. The College itself is a great yellow-plastered building with\r\ndisproportionately heavy cornice and rigid balconies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by J. Coney._\r\n\r\n  SS. ANNE AND AGNES\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Guildhall Yard is a fine view of the ornamental gateway of the\r\nGuildhall. On the east is the Guildhall Tavern, and on the west, beyond\r\nthe church, is an open space, formerly the churchyard, with a few\r\nplane-trees dotted about, and a fountain of Gothic design, erected in\r\n1866, with statues upon it representing St. Lawrence and the Magdalene.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin’s House, on the north side, is a modern red sandstone\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nSt. Anne’s Churchyard, with one or two plane-trees of good size, makes a\r\nbreak in the line of modern houses beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SS. ANNE AND AGNES, ALDERSGATE\r\n\r\n  This church stands on the north side of Gresham Street, towards the\r\n  west end. The date of the foundation of the original church is\r\n  uncertain, but mention is made of it in a deed dating between\r\n  1193-1212, in St. Paul’s Cathedral. It was damaged by fire in 1548,\r\n  reconstructed and again destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666. The\r\n  present building was completed by Wren in 1681. The earliest date of\r\n  an incumbent is 1322.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of:\r\n\r\n  The Dean and Canons of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, 1322; the Abbot and\r\n  Convent of Westminster, 1510; the Bishop of Westminster by grant of\r\n  Henry VIII., January 11, 1540-41; the Bishop of London and his\r\n  successors by grant of Edward VI., July 4, 1550; confirmed by Queen\r\n  Mary, March 3, 1553-54.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  The present building is of brick, and measures 53 feet square, and\r\n  35 feet in height. Within this area four Corinthian columns form\r\n  another square. The tower, rising at the west, measures 14 feet at\r\n  the base and culminates in a vane; the total height is 95 feet.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by Thomas Juvenal and Alice his wife at\r\n  the Altar of St. Nicholas; to which Richard Grant was instituted\r\n  chaplain, April 10, 1363.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained monuments to Stephen Brackynbury,\r\n  gentleman, Usher to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen\r\n  Elizabeth. William Gregory, Mayor of London, 1461, was buried here,\r\n  but no monument remained in 1598.\r\n\r\n  The principal benefactors were William Gregory, alderman and\r\n  skinner, and John Werke, goldsmith, both of whom bequeathed a number\r\n  of houses to the parish in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n  Some of the most notable rectors were: John Hopton (d. 1558), Bishop\r\n  of Norwich; Samuel Freeman, Dean of Peterborough, 1691; and Fifield\r\n  Allen, Archdeacon of Middlesex.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Noble Street is the churchyard of St. John Zachary,\r\nwhich parish is now incorporated with St. Anne and St. Agnes. This is a\r\nfairly large piece of ground surrounded by brick houses. There are many\r\nupright tombstones among the blackened shrubs within. Beyond there is a\r\nlarge building of red brick finished with piers of polished granite.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. John Zachary=, which was situated in Maiden Lane,\r\n  was burnt down in the Great Fire and its parish annexed to that of\r\n  St. Anne, Aldersgate. It was built or founded by a monk named\r\n  Zachary. The earliest date of an incumbent is some year between 1217\r\n  and 1243.\r\n\r\n  The church has always been in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  St. Paul’s, from the earliest record up to 1666, when the parish was\r\n  annexed to that of St. Anne and St. Agnes.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 240.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by Thomas Lichfield in 1320; for Roger\r\n  Beynyn and Isabel his wife before 1322.\r\n\r\n  Stow records that the monuments in this church were well preserved\r\n  in his time. Some of the most notable persons commemorated were: Sir\r\n  James Pemberton, who founded a free school in Lancashire, and was\r\n  donor of many other charitable gifts (died 1613); Philip Strelley\r\n  (d. 1603), benefactor to the parish, and Henry de Spondon, rector\r\n  here in 1366.\r\n\r\n  There were some small legacies belonging to the parish, but few\r\n  names are recorded by Stow. Colonel Henry Drax was donor of £20, and\r\n  his wife of £30. Philip Strelley, of 40s. a year.\r\n\r\n  By the subscribers of the united parishes thirty boys and twenty\r\n  girls were taught, clothed, and put out as apprentices.\r\n\r\n  William Byngham, founder of Christ Church College, Cambridge, was\r\n  rector here.\r\n\r\nIn Gresham Street are also the halls of two City Companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE HABERDASHERS COMPANY\r\n\r\nIt has been surmised that the haberdashers were originally a branch of\r\nthe mercers, and formed a trade association for the protection and\r\ngeneral supervision of the trade carried on by the haberdashers and\r\nmilliners. They are supposed to have existed as early as the year 1372,\r\nbeing mentioned in the City records as having then promulgated their\r\nfirst ordinances. By the Company’s earlier minute books they seem to\r\nhave been at one time associated with the felt-makers.\r\n\r\nThe first charter granted to the Haberdashers Company was by Henry VI.\r\n(June 3, 1448); it authorised and empowered the liegemen of the mystery\r\nof haberdashers to erect and found a guild or fraternity in honour of\r\nSt. Katherine. The charter grants that the fraternity shall be a\r\nperpetual and incorporate fraternity of haberdashers of St. Katherine of\r\nLondon, to hold lands to themselves and their successors and with a\r\ncommon seal.\r\n\r\nHenry VII. by charter united the crafts of hurriers and hatter merchants\r\ninto one craft, and by another charter, 17th Henry VII., he united the\r\nhurriers and hatter merchants with the craft of haberdashers, and\r\ndeclared they should be one craft and perpetual commonalty by the name\r\nof Merchant Haberdashers.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII.—November 1511—by charter of this date confirmed previous\r\ncharters, and, on the application of the Merchant Haberdashers, altered\r\nand translated the style of the said guild into the name of the Master\r\nand Four Wardens of the Guild of Fraternity of St. Katherine, of the\r\nCraft of Haberdashers, in the City of London. It enacted that no\r\nforeigner or stranger in London should make any caps or hats for the use\r\nof any stranger, unless admitted by the master and wardens, under pain\r\nor forfeiture of the thing made, one half to go to the Mayor and\r\nCommonalty of the City, and the other to the use of the mystery or craft\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nPhilip and Mary—1557—by charter of this date confirmed all previous\r\ncharters.\r\n\r\nElizabeth—June 19, 1578—by charter confirmed all previous charters, and\r\nit is under this charter that the Company is now governed.\r\n\r\nIt is thought there can be little doubt that the Haberdashers Company\r\nwas originally established for trade purposes, and was in former times\r\nassociated with other trades, as the felt-makers and hatters. The\r\nbefore-mentioned charters of incorporation gave the Company considerable\r\npowers for regulating the trade in haberdashery, and for enforcing its\r\norders in reference thereto, and these powers were no doubt exercised\r\nfor many years. In course of time, however, the business or trade of\r\nhaberdashery became so interwoven with other trades, such as drapers,\r\nmilliners, mercers, hosiers, etc., that there is no longer any distinct\r\nbusiness of haberdashery. The Company, however, being anxious to help\r\nthose who are engaged in it have for the last eight or nine years\r\nadvertised that the sum of £100 will be annually awarded as prizes to\r\nthe actual inventors of new patterns, designs, or specimens of articles\r\nof haberdashery proper, provided such inventors were not manufacturers\r\nor dealers. No control is now exercised by the Company in reference to\r\nthe trade of haberdashery.\r\n\r\nFreemen are eligible for pensions and gifts if in needy circumstances.\r\nThe children of freemen have the privilege of competing for certain\r\nexhibitions in the gift of the Company.\r\n\r\nLiverymen are also eligible for the pensions and gifts under similar\r\ncircumstances, and their children have like privileges for competing in\r\nexhibitions. They are also eligible (provided their fathers or\r\ngrandfathers are not members of the governing body) for educational\r\ngrants which are made voluntarily by the Company annually towards\r\ndefraying the cost of education, and liverymen’s children who have\r\ndistinguished themselves in their studies are also eligible for four\r\nexhibitions of £40 each, also voluntarily given by the Company and\r\ntenable for three years, for the purpose of pursuing their studies in\r\nthe higher branches of learning. The children of liverymen and freemen\r\nhave also a priority of claim over outsiders for admission to the\r\nCompany’s Aske’s Schools at Hatcham and West Hampstead and Acton.\r\n\r\nThe members of the governing body, on attending courts and committees\r\n(but not otherwise), receive fees for their attendance.\r\n\r\n  The present number of pensioners is 152, and the amount paid to them\r\n  £2999 : 10s.\r\n\r\n  The present number of recipients of annual gifts is 40, and the\r\n  amount paid to them £215 : 2s.\r\n\r\n  It is believed that few, if any, of the recipients of the above\r\n  pensions and gifts carry on or have carried on the trade the name of\r\n  which is borne by the Company. Considerable grants are made every\r\n  year to poor clergy and poor hatters.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the above yearly gifts various sums are from time to\r\n  time voluntarily granted to poor members of the Company, their\r\n  widows and families, amounting in 1879 to £276 : 10s.\r\n\r\n  The Hall is at 77 Gresham Street. It was built by Wren but burned\r\n  down in 1864.\r\n\r\n  The Trust Income of the Company is expended in schools and\r\n  almshouses, the most important schools being Aske’s, referred to\r\n  above. There are other almshouses at Monmouth, at Newland in\r\n  Gloucestershire, and at Newport, Salop. There are also schools at\r\n  Monmouth, Pontypool, Newport, Salop, and Bunbury connected with the\r\n  Company. They give several exhibitions, and they grant pensions and\r\n  give large subscriptions to philanthropic objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE WAX CHANDLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  There is no documentary evidence in the possession of the Wax\r\n  Chandlers’ Company of an earlier date than 45th Edward III., A.D.\r\n  1371, which is a petition to the Court of Aldermen of the City of\r\n  London for leave to choose searchers for bad wares, and for approval\r\n  of byelaws then submitted for the regulation of the craft. The\r\n  prayer of this petition seems to have been acceded to, for Walter\r\n  Rede and John Pope were in the same year chosen and sworn to oversee\r\n  the said craft, and the defaults from time to time found to present\r\n  to the mayor and aldermen, etc. These documents are set out (p. 104)\r\n  in the Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations in\r\n  England and Wales dated 1837. That the craft of wax chandlers had an\r\n  association previous to this date there are no documents to show,\r\n  although from the petition it would appear that it had, but without\r\n  power to enforce obedience to its orders.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of the charters, etc., granted at various\r\n  times to the Company:\r\n\r\n  1. Charter of 1 Richard III., 1484. 2. Grant of arms, 2 Richard\r\n  III., 1485. 3. Further grant of arms, 28 Henry VIII., 1536. 4.\r\n  Exemplification and confirmation of said charter of Richard III. by\r\n  Philip and Mary, 7th June, 4 and 5 Philip and Mary. 5. Letters\r\n  Patent of confirmation of said charter by Queen Elizabeth, 2\r\n  Elizabeth, 1560. 6. Ditto, ditto. King James I., 2 James I., 1604.\r\n  7. Charter of 15 Charles II., 1663. 8. Byelaws pursuant to\r\n  last-mentioned charter, and the statute 19 Henry VII., approved and\r\n  signed and sealed by the Lord Chancellor and two Chief Justices of\r\n  the King’s Bench and Common Pleas, dated June 28, 1664, referred to\r\n  at p. 100 of the above-mentioned report. 9. Charter of 1 James II.,\r\n  1685 (this charter was avoided under the General Statute).\r\n\r\n  At present they have a livery of twenty-seven, a Corporate Income of\r\n  £1370, a Trust Income of £230, and a hall in Gresham Street.\r\n\r\n  The use of wax tapers and candles not only in the churches, but also\r\n  in the houses of the wealthy sort, caused the material to be\r\n  valuable and the mystery of preparing it prosperous. The Company was\r\n  in fact in great credit until the Reformation, when the greater part\r\n  of its work—that of providing lights for the churches—vanished.\r\n\r\nIn ancient documents the =Guildhall Yard= is mentioned frequently, as\r\nmight be expected. In Agas’s map the yard is enclosed, and entered by a\r\ngateway. Some of the land belonged to Balliol College, Oxford. It was\r\nwidened by taking off part of the churchyard of St. Lawrence, Jewry.\r\nHere were the taverns of the Three Tuns and the White Lyon. Sir Erasmus\r\nde la Fountaine had property here and gave his name to Fountain Court.\r\n\r\nA passage out of Guildhall Yard and others out of Basinghall Street and\r\nCateaton Street led to the two courts of =Blackwell= or =Bakewell Hall=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLACKWELL HALL, 1819\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf this historic mansion Stow speaks at some length. He says that it was\r\nbuilt upon vaults of stone brought from Caen in Normandy, and that it\r\nwas covered over in painting and carved stone with the arms of the\r\nBasings or Bassings, viz. “a gyronny of twelve points gold and azure.”\r\nThis family when Stow writes was “worn out.” In the 36th year of Edward\r\nIII., one Thomas Bakewell was living in this house. In the 20th of\r\nRichard II., for a sum of £50, licence was given to transfer this hall\r\nwith certain messuages appertaining to the mayor and commonalty of the\r\nCity. Here was established the year after, by Whittington, thrice Mayor,\r\na weekly market for cloth, no foreigners being allowed to sell cloth\r\nanywhere except in Blackwell Hall and in the courts thereof. In the year\r\n1588 the house, being decayed, was taken down and rebuilt. In the Great\r\nFire the Hall was destroyed, together with a great quantity of cloth\r\nstored by country manufacturers in its warehouses. “What,” says Lord\r\nClarendon, “have we lost in clothe if the little Company [the\r\nstationers] lost £200,000 in books?”\r\n\r\n“The late edifice of Blackwell Hall appears to have been erected about\r\nthe year 1672, and it exhibited the dull and prison-like appearance of\r\nthe older storehouses of London, in the unglazed transom-windows with\r\niron bars, contained in the front. The attic was ornamented with a\r\ncornice and pediment, and in the centre was a heavy stately stone\r\ngateway between two Doric columns, surmounted by the royal arms, carved\r\nin a panel above; and the city arms, impaling those of Christ’s\r\nHospital, supported by winged boys, were sculptured in the head of the\r\narch. The disposition of the interior consisted of two quadrangular open\r\ncourts, one beyond the other, surrounded by buildings of freestone.\r\nWithin the Hall were several large rooms or warehouses, both above and\r\non the ground floor, in which the factors employed by the clothiers\r\nexposed their cloths on the established market days, Thursday, Friday,\r\nand Saturday, the first being the principal. These apartments formed the\r\nDevonshire, Gloucester, Worcester, Kentish, Medley, Spanish, and Blanket\r\nHalls, etc., in which one penny was charged for the pitching of each\r\npiece of cloth, and one halfpenny per week each for resting there. The\r\nprofits paid to Christ’s Hospital arising from those charges are said to\r\nhave produced £1000 yearly” (Wilkinson’s _Londina Illustrata_, vol. ii.\r\np. 36).\r\n\r\nThe changes gradually made in the cloth trade caused the decay of the\r\nmarket. In 1815 an Act was passed enabling the Mayor and Corporation to\r\npull down the hall of St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, which was stated to be\r\nin a ruinous condition, and to replace it by buildings for courts.\r\n\r\nThe present Art Gallery, the Museum, the Library, Guildhall Buildings,\r\nthe Courts, etc., stand upon the site of the Hall, the Chapel, and the\r\nadjacent ground. The Hall was taken down in 1819.\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall, like the Mansion House, Royal Exchange, etc., is so woven\r\nin with the history of the City that an account of it must be sought in\r\nthe historical volumes preceding this.\r\n\r\nWe may return to the Poultry by the next north and south thoroughfare,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n=Ironmonger Lane=, which is frequently mentioned in early deeds and\r\ndocuments. As early as the middle of the twelfth century documents are\r\nspoken of in “Ismongers’ Lane,” in the parish of St. Mary Colechurch. In\r\n1245 there are shops, solars, and cellars in the street. Riley (_Mem._\r\n128. 15) presents two most interesting inquests connected with two\r\nmurders in this street. The lane is called variously Ismongers’,\r\nIremongers’, and Ironmongers’.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of this street, near Cheapside, was the Church of St.\r\nMartin Pomeroy.\r\n\r\n  =St. Martin Pomeroy= is supposed by Stow to have gained its second\r\n  name from an apple garden there, but it was more probably from a\r\n  family named Pomeroy. In 1629 the church was repaired, but it was\r\n  burnt down in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being\r\n  united to that of St. Olave, Jewry. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1361.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo. Sandell, Ltd._\r\n\r\n  MERCERS’ HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church before 1253 was in the hands of Ralph\r\n  Tricket, who gave it in 1253 to the Prior and Canons of St.\r\n  Bartholomew, Smithfield; after the Reformation it continued in the\r\n  Crown up to 1666, when it was annexed to St. Olave.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 120.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were, founded here: For Henry atte Roth, chandeler, to\r\n  which Richard Scot was admitted, February 7, 1391-92; for William\r\n  Love, to which Stephen Benet was collated, January 24, 1391-92. Only\r\n  two monuments are recorded by Strype, neither of which commemorate\r\n  persons of eminence. There was a free school, said to have been\r\n  founded by Thomas à Becket, in the Old Jewry, for twenty-five\r\n  scholars. There were also two almshouses for nine widows of\r\n  Armourers or Braziers, the gift of Mr. Tindal, citizen and armourer\r\n  of London.\r\n\r\n  John Kingscote, Bishop of Carlisle, 1462, was rector here.\r\n\r\nIn Ironmonger Lane is the Mercers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MERCERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Mercers, although not incorporated until the year 1393 (17th\r\n  Richard II.), were in very early times associated voluntarily for\r\n  the purposes of mutual aid and comfort. They come to light as a\r\n  fraternity first in the time of Henry II., for Gilbert à Becket, the\r\n  father of St. Thomas of Canterbury, is said to have been a mercer;\r\n  and in the year 1192, Agnes de Helles, sister of St. Thomas, and her\r\n  husband, Thomas Fitztheobald de Helles, in founding the hospital of\r\n  St. Thomas of Acon, which is distinctly stated to have been built on\r\n  the spot where the future archbishop was born, constituted the\r\n  fraternity of mercers patrons of the hospital. The hospital and the\r\n  Company were intimately connected until the Reformation, and afford\r\n  a good example of the connection of secular guilds and\r\n  ecclesiastical foundations in the Middle Ages, secular guilds being\r\n  established for the promotion of trade and almsdeeds, and\r\n  ecclesiastical foundations for devotion and almsdeeds.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that a guild could not be carried on without the\r\n  King’s licence at this early date; and it would seem a necessary\r\n  interference that the mercers had a licence at the time of Henry\r\n  II., from their not appearing among the “adulterine” guilds, or\r\n  guilds set up without the King’s licence, which were fined in 1180\r\n  for being established without such licence.\r\n\r\n  The Merchant Adventurers Company gradually became detached from the\r\n  Mercers Company in the course of the fifteenth century, especially\r\n  by the opening of the trade with Flanders in the year 1497; and yet\r\n  more so in 1564, when Queen Elizabeth, by charter, constituted the\r\n  Merchant Adventurers a distinct body politic or corporation in\r\n  England; but the Mercers Company still kept up an intimate\r\n  connection with the “Brotherhood beyond the Sea,” the last link\r\n  connecting the two companies being only severed by the Great Fire of\r\n  London in 1666, which destroyed the office which the Merchant\r\n  Adventurers held of the mercers under Mercers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n  It is probable, however, that trade in former times was separated\r\n  into main divisions, the staple and the miscellaneous, now known as\r\n  mercery. Silk, when first imported, fell in England into the latter\r\n  division, hence the combined appellation “silk mercers”; but on the\r\n  Continent the word was applied to the vendors of all goods carried\r\n  about for sale. Cervantes, speaking of the original history in\r\n  Arabic of Don Quixote, says he purchased it of a book mercer; and\r\n  Guicciardini, in his description of the Netherlands, speaks of\r\n  merceries as well of silk as of other materials, and in another\r\n  place says that mercery comprehends all things sold by retail or by\r\n  the little balance or scales. Skinner, in his _Etymologicon_,\r\n  published in 1671, says “that a mercer was _mercator peripateticus_”\r\n  or an itinerant merchant.\r\n\r\n  The master and wardens superintended the taking of apprentices by\r\n  their members, searching the weights and measures of shopkeepers\r\n  belonging to the Company, and otherwise regulating their commercial\r\n  dealings. The Company appointed brokers of mercery wares, under the\r\n  first charter to the City by Edward II., by which it was declared\r\n  that there should be no brokers in the City but those chosen by the\r\n  merchants in the mysteries in which they exercised their office, and\r\n  under the charter of Edward III., which declared that none should\r\n  exercise the office of broker in foreign merchandise in London\r\n  unless chosen by the merchants of the mysteries in which they should\r\n  act. The Company also appointed a common meter of linen cloth and\r\n  silk, a common weigher of raw silk, and tackle porters to do their\r\n  work at the waterside. The Company no longer appoint to any of these\r\n  offices, because of the different methods of carrying on business\r\n  which have obtained in modern times.\r\n\r\n  In the 13th year of Edward II. the Companies had advanced towards\r\n  the phase of “Livery Companies.” “_Moultz des gens de Mesters en\r\n  Loundres furent vestus de suite._”\r\n\r\n  The Company seem to have exercised some supervision over the\r\n  retailers of silk and other mercery wares previous to the reign of\r\n  Queen Elizabeth; but such supervision was probably not founded on\r\n  any legal basis, as a petition to the privy council at the\r\n  commencement of that queen’s reign, praying that these rights should\r\n  be recognised, was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n  The numbers of the Company have been recruited by the admission of\r\n  apprentices, and from the sons of mercers, who have from very early\r\n  times been always entitled to the freedom; and one reason for the\r\n  smallness of the Company may probably have been the old custom,\r\n  established so long ago as 1347, that no strangers should be\r\n  admitted to the freedom without the consent of the generality. The\r\n  Company has never been very numerous. In 1347, when it was\r\n  refounded, 103 persons paid their entrance fees; in 1527 the Company\r\n  numbered 144; in 1707, when most numerous, 331; and on December 31,\r\n  1880, 166.\r\n\r\n  The earliest date of which there is a record in the Company’s books\r\n  is the year 1347, when it was reorganised, if not refounded.\r\n\r\n  The statement that no one should take as an apprentice one who had\r\n  carried packs through the country, called pedlars, seems to show\r\n  that a mercer at this time had ceased to be, if he had ever been, a\r\n  pedlar.\r\n\r\n  Previous to the charter granted by Richard II., the mercers did not\r\n  pretend to be a corporation, but simply a member of the City. In\r\n  their petition to Parliament in 10th Richard II., against Nicholas\r\n  Brembre, then mayor, they call themselves “the folk of the mercerie,\r\n  a member of the city.” The Company, having at this time no hall of\r\n  their own, assembled either in the house of one of the wardens, or\r\n  in the hall or church of the hospital of St. Thomas of Acon, the\r\n  site of which is now occupied by their chapel and hall, and\r\n  subsequently occasionally at the Prince’s Wardrobe in the Old Jewry.\r\n  They had then no landed property, and their income was derived from\r\n  subscriptions, apprentice fees, and fines, and amounted to about £20\r\n  a year.\r\n\r\n  The Company’s first charter, enrolled at the Record Office (the\r\n  original of which has been lost), is dated at Westminster the 13th\r\n  January, 17th Richard II. (1393).\r\n\r\n  The most important event in the early history of the Mercers Company\r\n  was the appointment of the Company as trustees of the charities of\r\n  Sir Richard Whittington, several times master or principal warden of\r\n  the Company, and four times Lord Mayor of London. He died in the\r\n  year 1422-23. It is not necessary to enumerate precisely the\r\n  munificent works of charity which were carried out by Sir Richard\r\n  Whittington in his lifetime, or by his executors after his death;\r\n  suffice it to say that he, or they by his direction, rebuilt the\r\n  parish church of St. Michael Royal, rebuilt the prison of Newgate,\r\n  built or repaired the City conduits, contributed very largely to the\r\n  building of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and of the Guildhall, to the\r\n  library of the Corporation of London, and the library of the\r\n  Greyfriars, and established a chaplain at St. Paul’s. Whittington\r\n  appointed John Coventry, John White, John Carpenter, and William\r\n  Grove to be executors of his will, which was proved in March\r\n  1422-23. On the 12th November, 3rd Henry VI. (1424), his executors\r\n  obtained a charter from the King to found Whittington college and\r\n  almshouses. Of both these foundations the Mercers Company were made\r\n  trustees.\r\n\r\n  The Company’s second charter was granted by Henry VI. at the prayer\r\n  of the executors of Whittington.\r\n\r\n  On the accession of Edward IV. it became necessary for the quieting\r\n  of men’s titles that the grants made by the Lancastrian kings should\r\n  be confirmed, and accordingly the statute 1st Edward IV. cap. 1 was\r\n  passed, by which it was enacted that all liberties and franchises\r\n  granted by Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI., to counties or\r\n  corporations, and among others to the wardens and commonalty of the\r\n  Mystery of Mercers of the City of London, should be of the same\r\n  force and virtue as if they had been granted by kings reigning _de\r\n  jure_. The Mercers Company is the only company named in the Act, the\r\n  others being included in general words.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MERCERS’ HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\n  1463. This year is a most important one in the Company’s annals, as\r\n  in it the court of assistants was first established. The business of\r\n  the Company having very much increased, both on account of their\r\n  connection with the Merchant Adventurers Company and also from the\r\n  management of the trusts of Whittington, Abbot, and Estfield, it was\r\n  felt that the whole burden of the Company’s affairs should not be\r\n  cast upon the wardens, and that it was not desirable that the\r\n  generality should be constantly called together. For many years\r\n  previous to this date it had been the practice that the wardens, and\r\n  the aldermen free of the Company, and their peers, should hold\r\n  assemblies for the devising of ordinances or other matters, their\r\n  deliberations being afterwards submitted to a general court for\r\n  approval. On the 23rd of July 1463, at a general court of the\r\n  Company, the following resolution was passed: “It is accorded that\r\n  for the holding of many courts and congregations of the fellowship\r\n  it is tedious and grievous to the body of the fellowship, and\r\n  specially for matters of no great effect, that hereafter yearly\r\n  shall be chosen and associate to the custoses for the time being, 12\r\n  other sufficient persons to be assistants to the said custoses, and\r\n  all matters by them, or most part of them, finished, to be holden\r\n  firm and stable, and the fellowship to abide by them.”\r\n\r\n  The rest of the history of the Mercers Company is mainly occupied by\r\n  a recital of charities which were placed in their hands to\r\n  administer. It is sufficient to call attention to the many and\r\n  splendid endowments which have been placed in the hands of the\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  The general court appoint three trustees of the Prisons’ Charities\r\n  Trust, decide when the corporate seal shall be affixed, and\r\n  determine the amount of fees which shall be paid for attendance at\r\n  general courts, courts of assistants, and committees. The fee paid\r\n  to a member for his attendance at general courts and courts of\r\n  assistants is £4 : 4s., and to a member attending a committee, £2 :\r\n  2s.\r\n\r\n  (1) A freeman is entitled from Lady Campden’s legacy for loans, and\r\n  from the money legacies for loans, to have the loan of not more than\r\n  £500 without interest for not more than five years, giving approved\r\n  security.\r\n\r\n  He is entitled, if his circumstances warrant it, and within the\r\n  limits of the Company’s nominations, to have his sons placed in\r\n  Christ’s Hospital under Daniel Westall’s gift, and clothed, boarded,\r\n  and educated there from eight years old to fifteen, and perhaps to\r\n  nineteen; and his daughters educated out of the Company’s funds at\r\n  an expense not exceeding £50 per annum, from nine years of age to\r\n  fifteen, and if they show reasonable proficiency and ability to\r\n  seventeen, under regulations approved by the general court.\r\n\r\n  He is also entitled in case of old age, misfortune, or infirmity to\r\n  receive relief proportioned to his circumstances out of the\r\n  Company’s or out of Sir Richard Whittington’s estate, which was left\r\n  to the Company specially for that purpose; and his widow and\r\n  daughters are entitled to relief under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n  (2) Liveryman.—A liveryman is entitled to the same advantages as a\r\n  freeman, and in addition is invited to three dinners in the course\r\n  of the year. He has the right to attend common hall, and to vote at\r\n  elections of lord mayors and sheriffs and of such other officers of\r\n  the Corporation of London as are elected by the livery; and if\r\n  resident within a radius of twenty-five miles from the City, to vote\r\n  at elections of members of Parliament for the City of London.\r\n\r\n  He is eligible, and if of sufficient position and standing he is\r\n  generally called in rotation by the court of assistants, to be a\r\n  member of their body.\r\n\r\n  (3) Master, Warden, or otherwise a member of the governing body.—A\r\n  member of the court of assistants is summoned to general courts as\r\n  well as to meetings of the court of assistants (which are held\r\n  weekly, except during Christmas and Easter weeks and six weeks in\r\n  August and September). He is also eligible to be placed on\r\n  committees appointed by the court and on the Gresham committee.\r\n\r\n  He is invited to dine at all dinners in the Company’s hall.\r\n\r\n  He recommends in rotation to appointments to Mercers’ School, and to\r\n  out-pensions on the Whittington estate, and to the Whittington\r\n  almshouses.\r\n\r\n  The court of assistants appoint nine governors of St. Paul’s School\r\n  under the provisions of the scheme, and also governors and members\r\n  of the council and of the executive committee of the City and Guilds\r\n  of London Institute for the Advancement of Technical Education.\r\n\r\n  The master and wardens are members of every committee appointed by\r\n  the Company. They distribute Alderman Walthall’s and Lady\r\n  Hungerford’s gifts, appoint preachers in Mercers’ Chapel under\r\n  various gifts, and are _ex officio_ governors of St. Paul’s School.\r\n\r\n  They also receive under various wills of benefactors to the Company\r\n  certain small annuities, and are entitled to the surplus of\r\n  Blundell’s estate, which surplus amounted in 1880 to £205 : 9 : 9.\r\n\r\n  A member of the Company will probably come on to the court of\r\n  assistants when he is about forty-five years of age, and he remains\r\n  a member for life.\r\n\r\n  The Company does not carry on any trade or occupation whatever.\r\n\r\n  The Mercers’ Hall is interesting as standing on the site of the\r\n  ancient House of St. Thomas Acon. On the dissolution the Mercers\r\n  purchased the buildings of the House.\r\n\r\n  The Mercers had occupied a house adjoining for more than a hundred\r\n  years before this acquisition. The Religious House itself was\r\n  undoubtedly on the site of the house where Thomas was born. The\r\n  buildings were destroyed in the Great Fire. The second hall was\r\n  built on the same site with another chapel in which service is held\r\n  every Sunday evening. Fragments of the ancient buildings can still\r\n  be seen. The present hall is said to have been designed by Wren. The\r\n  entrance in Cheapside was built in 1879.\r\n\r\n  Among the more distinguished members of this great Company have been\r\n  Whittington, Caxton, and Sir Thomas Gresham, Sir Henry Colet, Sir\r\n  Baptist Hicks. The present number of the livery is returned in\r\n  _Whitaker_ as 187; the Corporate Income as £48,000; the Trust Income\r\n  as £35,000.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the Hospital of St. Thomas of Acon, which at first\r\nextended from Ironmonger Lane to Old Jewry, see _Mediæval London_, vol.\r\nii. p. 262.\r\n\r\n=King Street= was constructed after the Fire, in order to give a nobler\r\napproach to the Guildhall. Pepys refers to the ground having been\r\nalready bought in December 1667. Strype says that “it is well inhabited\r\nby Norwich Factors and other wholesale dealers of wealth and\r\nreputation.” He calls it New King Street.\r\n\r\n=Trump Street= or =Trump Alley= is not named in Agas, Stow, or Ogilvy;\r\nStrype calls it Duke Street.\r\n\r\nThe mention of John Carsyl, Tromppour, Trumper or Trumpet-maker (1308),\r\nalso of William Trompeor (1321) and William le Trompour, gives Riley\r\noccasion for the following notes:\r\n\r\n“The persons who followed this trade mostly lived, in all probability,\r\nin Trump Street, formerly Trump Alley (a much longer street then than it\r\nis now), near the Guildhall; their principal customers not improbably\r\nbeing the City waits, or watchmen; each of whom was provided with a\r\ntrumpet, also known as a “wait,” for sounding the hours of the watch,\r\nand giving the alarm. In reference to this trade it deserves the remark,\r\nthat the only memorial that has come down to us of the Chapel of St.\r\nMary the Virgin, and of St. Mary Magdalen and all Saints, formerly\r\nadjoining the Guildhall, is a massive stone coffin (now in the Library\r\nat Guildhall) with its lid, whereon is sculptured a cross between two\r\ntrumpets, and around its margin the following inscription: Godefrey le\r\nTrompour: gist: ci: Deu: del: ealme: eit: merci. ‘Godefrey the Trompour\r\nlies here, God on the soul have mercy.’ In Trump Alley, close adjoining,\r\nhe probably lived, sold trumpets, and died—if we may judge from the\r\ncharacter of the writing, in the latter half of the fourteenth century”\r\n(Riley’s _Memorials_, p. xxi).\r\n\r\n=St. Lawrence Lane.=—“Antiquities in this lane I find none other, than\r\nthat among many fair houses, there is one large inn for receipt of\r\nTravellers called Blossoms inn, but corruptly Bosoms inn, and hath to\r\nsign St. Laurence the Deacon, in a border of blossoms or flowers”\r\n(Stow’s _Survey_).\r\n\r\nCunningham adds as follows:\r\n\r\n“When Charles V. came over to this country in 1522, certain houses and\r\ninns were set apart for the reception of his retinue, and in St.\r\nLawrence Lane, at ‘the signe of Saint Lawrence, otherwise called Bosoms\r\nyn, xx beddes and a stable for lx horses’ were directed to be got ready.\r\nThe curious old tract about Bankes and his bay horse (_Maroccus\r\nExtaticus_) is said to be by ‘John Dando, the wier-drawer of Hadley, and\r\nHarrie Runt, head ostler of Besomes Inne.’”\r\n\r\nThe inn was also called “Bossamez” Inn and Boscham’s Inn.\r\n\r\n=Honey Lane Market= was established soon after the Fire. Strype thus\r\nspeaks of it (vol. i. p. 566):\r\n\r\n“Adjoining to this street, on the north side, is Honey Lane, being now,\r\nas it were, an alley with a Freestone pavement, serving as a passage to\r\nHoney Lane Market; the former Lane, and other buildings, being since the\r\nfire of London converted into this market. Among which buildings, was\r\nthe Parish Church of St. Allhallow’s, Honey Lane; and, because it was\r\nthought fit not to rebuild it, the parish is united to St. Mary-le-Bow.\r\nThis Market is well served, every Week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays\r\nand Saturdays, with Provisions. The Place taken up by this Market is\r\nspacious. In the middle is a large and square Market-house, standing on\r\npillars, with rooms over it, and a bell-tower in the midst. There are in\r\nthe market one hundred and thirty-five standing stalls for butchers,\r\nwith racks, blocks, and others necessaries, all covered over, to shelter\r\nthem from the injury of the weather; and also several stalls for\r\nfruiterers. The west end of the market lieth open to Milk Street, where\r\nthere is a cock of conduit water for the use of the market. There are\r\ntwo other passages into it, that is, one out of St. Lawrence’s Lane,\r\nbesides that which comes out of Cheapside; which passages are inhabited\r\nby grocers, Fishmongers, Poulterers, Victuallers, and Cheesemongers.”\r\n\r\nComplaints are found in the wardmote book of people making fires in the\r\nmarket; of butchers killing sheep and lambs there; and of the annoyance\r\ncaused by the farmers letting soil and refuse lie about the place. Honey\r\nLane, which led to it, is said by Stow to be so called, being a dark and\r\nnarrow place, on account of the constant washing required to keep it\r\nclean—a far-fetched derivation. The name is indeed very ancient. In a\r\ngrant, dated 1203-15, made by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s to one\r\nRichard de Corilis mention is made of “Huni” Lane, and in another grant\r\nof the same period the house in question, “a stone built house,” is\r\nmentioned in between Milk Street and “Huni” Lane. There was one Elias de\r\nHoney Lane in 1274.\r\n\r\nThe market was closed in 1835 and the City of London School built on its\r\nsite. The school has now been removed to the Embankment and the place is\r\nlet out in offices.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of Allhallows, Honey Lane=, stood on the north side of\r\n  Cheapside in Honey Lane. It was burnt down in the Great Fire and the\r\n  parish was then annexed to St. Mary-le-Bow. Honey Lane Market was on\r\n  the site of the church. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1327.\r\n\r\n  The patronage was in the hands of: Simon de Creppyng, citizen, who\r\n  presented in 1327; several private persons, among whom was Thomas\r\n  Knoles, Mayor of London, 1399; the Grocers Company, 1471-1666, when\r\n  it was annexed to St. Mary-le-Bow.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 150.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL, MILK STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here for John Fourneys, citizen, and\r\n  Katherine his wife, at the Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary, August 22,\r\n  1396 (Pat. 20 Rd. II. p. i. m. 21), and by Alexander Speat, Thomas\r\n  Trompington, John Downe, and Henry Edelmeton. Sir John Norman, Mayor\r\n  of London, 1453, was buried in this church. No bequests or\r\n  charitable gifts are recorded in Parish Clerk’s Summary of 1732.\r\n\r\n  Among the notable rectors were Thomas Garrard, who was burnt at\r\n  Smithfield, and John Young, Bishop of Gallipoli.\r\n\r\n=Milk Street= is one of the streets of Cheapside which peculiarly\r\nrecalls the site of the old market by its name. There is not much\r\nrecorded of this street. Sir Thomas More was born here, “the brightest\r\nstar,” says Fuller, “that ever shone in that _via Lactea_.” In the\r\nCalendar of Wills the street is repeatedly mentioned as containing\r\nshops. The earliest date on which it occurs is 1278. In Riley’s\r\n_Memorials_ we find a cook living here in 1351; in 1377 the sheriff has\r\n“his own Compter” in this street; in 1390 one Salamon Salaman, a mercer\r\nof Milk Street, gets into trouble for having putrid fish in his\r\npossession; and in 1391 one William of Milk Street, no name or trade\r\ngiven, is falsely imprisoned by means of a conspiracy.\r\n\r\nMilk Street in the thirteenth century was the residence of certain Jews.\r\nThus in 1247 Peter the Jew had a house there; and in 1250 leave was\r\ngranted to John Brewer to build a chapel in his house, formerly that of\r\nBenedict the Jew; and in 1285 Cresse the Jew had a house there. In 1294\r\nMartin the Arbalestin lived in Milk Street; and in 1285 the mayor had\r\nhis residence there, his house being rented of the Prior of Lewes.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Milk Street=, formerly stood on\r\n  the east side, towards the south end of Milk Street, Cheapside. It\r\n  was burnt down in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being\r\n  annexed to that of St. Lawrence, Jewry. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1162.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s continuously from 1162, until it was burnt down, when\r\n  the parish was annexed; the Dean and Chapter now share the alternate\r\n  patronage of the amalgamated parish (see Hist. MSS. Rept. ix. p.\r\n  18^{bc} 19^a as to a lawsuit concerning the patronage).\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 220.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Robert de Kelsey, about 1334, for\r\n  himself, Julian his wife, Hen. de Galeys, and Sara de Eldham, to\r\n  which Hen. de Kelsey was admitted chaplain, September 5, 1336; the\r\n  above Robert de Kelsey endowed it with the “Caufare” in Westcheap,\r\n  which fetched £3 : 14 : 8 in 1548; John Offam, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £14 : 9 : 6 in 1548, when William Baker was priest; Thomas\r\n  Kelsey, whose endowment fetched £12 : 13 : 4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  A great number of the monuments in this church had been defaced by\r\n  Stow’s time. He records the interment of Thomas Knesworth, mayor in\r\n  1505; Sir John Langley, mayor in 1576. No names of benefactors are\r\n  recorded by him.\r\n\r\n  Lawrence Bothe, Bishop of Durham 1457, of York 1476, was rector\r\n  here; also John Bullingham (d. 1598), Bishop of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n=Wood Street= or Lane is the next important thoroughfare westward. It is\r\nsupposed by Stow to have been so called because it was built wholly of\r\nwood; but Stow suggests also an alternative derivation, that it may have\r\nbeen named after one Thomas Wood, sheriff in 1491. The latter suggestion\r\nmust be ruled out, because in 1394 a testator bequeathed his “mansion”\r\nin Wood Street. It is worthy of note that the first mention of the\r\nstreet is of houses, rents, and tenements, and so it continues until the\r\nend of the thirteenth century, when we begin to hear of shops; in 1349 a\r\nbrewery is spoken of—the water, as in the case of Mugwell Street, must\r\nhave been furnished by one of the numerous City wells. There were many\r\ninns in Wood Street: the Bell, the Coach and Horses, the Castle, and the\r\nCross Keys. The Castle is still commemorated in a stone slab.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Michael, Wood Street=, was sometimes called St.\r\n  Michael Hogge or Huggen from one of that name who lived in the lane\r\n  which runs down by the church. It was destroyed by the Great Fire\r\n  (with the exception of the steeple) and rebuilt by Wren, who\r\n  completed it in 1675, when the parish of St. Mary Staining was\r\n  annexed. It was repaired in 1888, and taken down at the end of the\r\n  nineteenth century. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1150.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot of St.\r\n  Albans before 1150; Henry VIII., who seized it in 1540 and sold it\r\n  in 1543 to William Burwell; John Marsh and others in trust for the\r\n  parish—it so continued up to 1666, when St. Mary Staining was\r\n  annexed and the patronage was alternately in the Crown and\r\n  parishioners.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 317.\r\n\r\n  The latest church was very plain and measured 63 feet in length, 42\r\n  feet in breadth, and 31 feet in height. The east front had four\r\n  Ionic pilasters supporting a pediment, and in the spaces between the\r\n  columns there were three circular-headed windows. The tower, which\r\n  was connected with the church by a porch, contained three stories,\r\n  terminated by a parapet which was surmounted by a narrow spire with\r\n  a vane; the total height was 130 feet.\r\n\r\n  Richard de Basingstoke founded a chantry here before 1359, probably\r\n  at the Altar of St. John Baptist. Amongst those buried in the old\r\n  church was Alderman John Lambarde, sheriff, 1551, who was father to\r\n  Stow’s great friend William Lambard, the antiquary; he died in 1554.\r\n  The church contained a monument to Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  The legacies of charity left to the parish were: 8s. per annum, of\r\n  which Lady Read was donor; 5s. per annum, of which Mr. Hill was\r\n  donor; £2 for 20 years, of which Mr. Longworth Cross was donor; £1\r\n  per annum, of which Mr. Bowman was donor. There were also\r\n  ground-rents amounting to £36 : 4s. leased for 61 years.\r\n\r\n  Anthony Ellis or Ellys (1690-1761), Bishop of St. David’s, was a\r\n  rector here; also Thomas Birch (1705-66), Secretary to the Royal\r\n  Society, 1752-65.\r\n\r\nThe modern =Wood Street=, for a considerable distance after Gresham\r\nStreet, is one series of immensely high warehouses, on which the\r\nvertical lines of bricks between the plate-glass windows are the most\r\nprominent feature. The effect of these lines is rather neat and\r\nworkmanlike; horizontally beneath the windows are carved stone designs\r\nof flowers and fruit in very heavy relief. On the other side of the\r\nstreet are the entries into Pickford’s Yard under an old\r\neighteenth-century house of the plainer sort.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Alban, Wood Street, is too far north to fall within\r\nour present section; but as it belongs to this street it must find a\r\nplace here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. ALBAN, WOOD STREET\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Alban, the only one remaining in this street, is\r\n  on the west side, in the Cripplegate Ward. In 1632 it was pulled\r\n  down, but was rebuilt in 1634, probably by Inigo Jones, but was\r\n  destroyed by the Great Fire, and the present building is the work of\r\n  Wren, who completed it in 1685. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1244.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church, as far as can be traced, was in the\r\n  hands of: St. Alban’s Abbey, who exchanged it in 1077 to Westminster\r\n  Abbey; St. James’ Hospital, Westminster, presented before 1244;\r\n  Provost and Fellows of Eton, 1477, with whom it remained up to 1666,\r\n  when the parish of St. Olave, Silver Street, was annexed and the\r\n  patronage shared alternately with the Dean and Chapter of St.\r\n  Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  The church is in a quasi-Gothic style and somewhat after the model\r\n  of the church destroyed by the Fire. It measured 33 feet in height,\r\n  66 feet in length, and 59 feet in breadth, and has two side aisles\r\n  divided from the central portion by clustered columns and flat\r\n  pointed arches. The church terminates at the east in an apse,\r\n  containing three stained-glass windows. It has been greatly altered\r\n  and modernised, the most striking alteration being the formation of\r\n  the apse and the substitution of three smaller windows for the\r\n  original large east window. The tower attains a height of 85 feet\r\n  and terminates in an open parapet; it is surmounted by eight\r\n  pinnacles of 7 feet each, giving a total altitude of 92 feet. On the\r\n  north side there is a small churchyard, separating the church from\r\n  Little Love Lane.\r\n\r\n  There was a chantry founded here by Roger Poynel before 1366. The\r\n  church formerly contained monuments to Sir John Cheke (1514-57),\r\n  tutor of Edward VI. and others.\r\n\r\n  The donors of charitable gifts were: William Peel, of St. Mary\r\n  Savoy, who bequeathed an annuity of £10 in 1623 for the use of the\r\n  poor; Gilbert Keat; Susan Ibel, £40 for providing coals for the\r\n  poor; Richard Wynne, £20 to be distributed among eight poor people,\r\n  at 2s. 6d. apiece; Thomas Savage, citizen and goldsmith, donor of\r\n  premises in Holborn Bridge; Mr. Londson, £1 : 6s. per annum for\r\n  bread for the poor, through the Company of Embroiderers.\r\n\r\n  There was a charity school for fifty boys and twenty-five girls,\r\n  supported by voluntary contributions from the Church of St. Alban\r\n  and others, from which the boys were apprenticed and the girls\r\n  placed out to service. The parish had in 1732 a workhouse hired in\r\n  the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate.\r\n\r\n  The following are some of the notable vicars of the church: William\r\n  Watts (d. 1649), chaplain to Charles I.; John Adams (1662-1720),\r\n  chaplain to William III. and Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n=Foster Lane= was originally St. Vedast’s. It is mentioned in a document\r\nof 1281 as St. Fauster’s, which was actually a corruption of St.\r\nVedast’s. It was, before the Fire, a neighbourhood much frequented by\r\ngoldsmiths and jewellers; William Fleetwood, Recorder of London in 1571,\r\ndated some of his letters to Lord Burleigh from Foster Lane.\r\n\r\n  =St. Vedast’s= Church, commonly known as St. Fauster’s or\r\n  Foster’s. It was severely damaged by the Fire, and rebuilt by\r\n  Wren; the steeple was erected in 1697, the old one having been\r\n  retained until then. The parish was united after the Fire with St.\r\n  Michael-le-Querne, and St. Matthew, Friday Street, to which St.\r\n  Peter, Westcheap, had been annexed. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1291.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury; the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n  before 1396, in whose successors it continued up to 1666, when the\r\n  parish of St. Michael-le-Querne was annexed and the patronage was\r\n  alternately shared with the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s up to\r\n  1882, when St. Matthew, Friday Street, with St. Peter, Westcheap,\r\n  were annexed; the patronage is now in the hands of the Bishop of\r\n  London for two turns, the Duke of Buccleugh for one turn.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 460.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 69 feet in length, 51 feet in breadth, and 36\r\n  feet in height, and consists of a nave and south aisle separated by\r\n  arches supported on four Tuscan columns. The steeple, which rises at\r\n  the south-west, consists of a tower, surmounted by three stages, the\r\n  lowest of which is concave, the second convex, and the third an\r\n  obelisk-shaped spire; the total height is about 160 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Galfridus atte gate for himself and\r\n  his wives Joan and Alice, about 1447, when Edmund Brennyng was\r\n  admitted chaplain—the lands fetched £8 : 6 : 8, which was augmented\r\n  by Christopher Tury and yielded in all £14 : 10s. in 1548, when John\r\n  Markehame was priest, “of the age of 59 years, of mean qualities and\r\n  learning”; by William de Wyndesore for himself and Tolonia his wife;\r\n  by John de Wyndesore, brother of the above William; by Mr. Cote in\r\n  1530, who gave £160 to purchase lands for the endowing of it, which\r\n  were not purchased, but one Mr. Hayton, in 1548, finds a priest; by\r\n  William Tryston, who endowed it £6 : 14 : 4, which was augmented by\r\n  Simon Atwoll to £18 : 5 : 2 in 1548, when Albert Copeman was priest,\r\n  “of the age of 39 years, of mean qualities and mean learning.”\r\n\r\n  John Longson, Master of the Mint, was buried in this church in 1583.\r\n  Among the later interments Stow records those of: William Fuller,\r\n  D.D., Dean of Durham, who suffered imprisonment for his loyalty in\r\n  the times of the rebellion; Sir John Johnson, Alderman of the City,\r\n  who died in 1698; and William Hall, deputy of this ward, who died in\r\n  1680; Robert Herrick was baptized here in 1591. No legacies or gifts\r\n  are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  CHURCH OF ST. VEDAST\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Thomas Rotherham (1423-1500), afterwards Archbishop of York, was\r\n  rector here; also Isaac Maddox (1697-1759), Bishop of St. Asaph and\r\n  of Worcester; Adam Moleynes (or Molyneux, d. 1450), LL.D., Bishop of\r\n  Chichester, who was slain by the marines at Portsmouth, incited by\r\n  Richard, Duke of York; Thomas Blage (d. 1611), Dean of Rochester;\r\n  Nathaniel Marshall (d. 1730), Canon of Windsor.\r\n\r\nIn Gresham Street, between Foster Lane and Gutter Lane corners, is the\r\nGoldsmiths’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE GOLDSMITHS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Goldsmiths Company is mentioned in the year 1180, when it\r\n  appears to have been a voluntary association. It doubtless had its\r\n  origin in a combination of goldsmiths, for their mutual protection,\r\n  and to guard the trade against fraudulent workers. In the year 1300\r\n  the existence of the Company is recognised by a statute, viz., the\r\n  28th Edward I., cap. 80, which provides for the standards of gold\r\n  and silver, and enacts that all articles of those metals shall be\r\n  assayed by the wardens of the craft, to whom certain powers of\r\n  search are also given.\r\n\r\n  The first of the Company’s charters was granted to them by Edward\r\n  III., in the first year of his reign (1327).\r\n\r\n  It states that it had been theretofore ordained that all those who\r\n  were of the goldsmiths’ trade should sit in their shops in the High\r\n  Street of Cheap (Cheapside), and that no silver or plate, nor vessel\r\n  of gold or silver, ought to be sold in the City of London, except at\r\n  the King’s Exchange, or in the said street of Cheap amongst the\r\n  goldsmiths, and that publicly, to the end the persons of the said\r\n  trade might inform themselves whether the sellers came lawfully by\r\n  such vessel or not; that no gold or silver shall be manufactured to\r\n  be sent abroad but what shall be sold at the King’s Exchange, or\r\n  openly amongst the goldsmiths, and that none pretending to be\r\n  goldsmiths shall keep any shops but in Cheap.\r\n\r\n  By two subsequent charters Edward III. confirmed and extended the\r\n  privileges before granted, and he gave the Company licence to\r\n  purchase and hold tenements and rents to the value of £20 per annum,\r\n  for the relief of infirm members.\r\n\r\n  Richard II., by letters patent of the sixteenth of his reign, after\r\n  reciting that Edward III. had allowed the Company of the said craft\r\n  to accept charitable donations, and to purchase estates as\r\n  aforesaid, and that they might retain a chaplain to celebrate Mass\r\n  amongst them every day, confirmed the liberties granted by Edward\r\n  III. and granted and licensed the men of the craft that thenceforth\r\n  they may be a perpetual community or society amongst themselves.\r\n\r\n  Henry IV., by letters patent of his fifth year, recited and\r\n  confirmed the preceding charters of Edward III. and Richard II.\r\n\r\n  Henry VI., by letters patent of his first year, also recited and\r\n  confirmed the charter of Henry IV.\r\n\r\n  Edward IV., by letters patent of his second year, recited and\r\n  confirmed the charters of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, he granted that the said then wardens and their successors\r\n  may be a corporation or body corporate to consist of and be called\r\n  the Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Goldsmiths of the City\r\n  of London. That they may be capable in law to purchase, take, and\r\n  hold in fee and perpetuity lands, tenements, rents, and other\r\n  possessions whatsoever of any persons whomsoever that shall be\r\n  willing to give, devise, and assign the same to them. That they may\r\n  have perpetual succession and a common seal.\r\n\r\n  Henry VII., by letters patent of the twentieth year of his reign,\r\n  confirmed the whole of the preceding charters, and on account of the\r\n  Company being opposed in their trade search and assay, granted by\r\n  Edward IV., gave them the additional power to imprison or fine\r\n  defaulters in the trade at their discretion; to seize and break\r\n  unlawful work; to compel the trade, within three miles of the City,\r\n  to bring their work to the Company’s common hall, to be assayed and\r\n  stamped; and gave them power for ever, when it was not standard, to\r\n  utterly condemn the same, without rendering account to the Crown.\r\n\r\n  The whole of the liberties and franchises granted to the Company by\r\n  the preceding charters are set forth and confirmed by inspeximus\r\n  charters of 1st of Henry VIII., 1st of Edward VI., 1st of Mary, 3rd\r\n  of Elizabeth, 2nd of James I., and 18th of Charles II.\r\n\r\n  The Company also received a charter from James II. dated 4th of May\r\n  in the first year of his reign, whereby, amongst other things, that\r\n  monarch reserved to the Crown a right of control over the\r\n  appointment of the wardens and clerk. The statute was made void by\r\n  the Act of Parliament 2nd William and Mary, cap. 8.\r\n\r\n  The Company have also a copy of that part of the following patent\r\n  which relates to their property, viz. 4th of Edward VI. The King to\r\n  Augustine Hynde, and others.\r\n\r\n  The Company have also an exemplification under the great seal of\r\n  letters patent granted to them by James I., in the seventeenth year\r\n  of his reign (July 24, 1619), confirming to them the possession of a\r\n  large quantity of property in the City of London.\r\n\r\n  The powers of the Company are exercised at the present time chiefly\r\n  under the Acts of 12th George II., cap. 26, and 7th and 8th\r\n  Victoria, cap. 22.\r\n\r\n  As before stated, it appears that the Company was at first a\r\n  voluntary association, and had for its chief objects the protection\r\n  of the mystery or craft of goldsmiths; but it was evidently also\r\n  formed for religious and social purposes, and for the relief of the\r\n  poor members.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a drawing by Thos. H. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  GOLDSMITHS’ HALL, 1835\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The powers exercised by this voluntary association over the craft\r\n  were subsequently confirmed to them by their charters. The wardens\r\n  fined workmen for making wares worse than standard, entered their\r\n  shops and searched for and seized false wares, settled disputes\r\n  between masters and apprentices, and frequently punished rebellious\r\n  apprentices by flogging, levied heavy fines upon members for slander\r\n  and disobedience of the wardens, and for reviling members of the\r\n  livery; and generally exercised a very powerful and absolute\r\n  control, not only over the members of the fellowship, but also over\r\n  all other persons exercising the goldsmiths’ trade.\r\n\r\n  For the purpose of the assay they had an assay office in the early\r\n  part of the fourteenth century. The statute of 28th Edward I. enacts\r\n  that no vessel of gold or silver shall depart out of the hands of\r\n  the workman until it is assayed by the wardens of the craft, and\r\n  stamped with the leopard’s head; the leopard being at that time part\r\n  of the royal arms of England.\r\n\r\n  The Company and its members, even at this early period, appear to\r\n  have acted as bankers and pawnbrokers. They received pledges, not\r\n  only of plate, but of other articles, such as cloth of gold and\r\n  pieces of napery.\r\n\r\n  The London goldsmiths were divided into two classes, natives and\r\n  foreigners. They inhabited chiefly Cheapside, Old Change, Lombard\r\n  Street, Foster Lane, St. Martin’s-le-Grand, Silver Street,\r\n  Goldsmiths’ Street, Wood Street, and the lanes about Goldsmiths’\r\n  Hall. Cheapside was their principal place of residence; the part of\r\n  it on the south side, extending from Bread Street to the Cross, was\r\n  called “the Goldsmiths’ Row.” The shops here were occupied by\r\n  goldsmiths, and here the Company possess many houses at the present\r\n  time. The Exchange for the King’s coin was close by, in what is now\r\n  called Old Change.\r\n\r\n  The native and foreign goldsmiths appear to have been divided into\r\n  classes, and to have enjoyed different privileges. First, there were\r\n  the members of the Company, who were chiefly, but not exclusively,\r\n  Englishmen; their shops were subject to the control of the Company;\r\n  they had the advantages conferred by the Company on its members, and\r\n  they made certain payments for the support of the fellowship. The\r\n  second division comprised the non-freemen, who were called\r\n  “Allowes,” that is to say, allowed or licensed. There were the\r\n  “Allowes Englis,” “Allowes Alicant,” “Alicant Strangers,”\r\n  “Dutchmen,” “Men of the Fraternity of St. Loys,” etc. All these paid\r\n  tribute to the Company, and were also subject to their control. The\r\n  quarterage paid by the members, and the tribute so paid by the\r\n  “Allowes,” constituted the Company’s original income. We find\r\n  frequent mention of efforts made by the English goldsmiths to\r\n  prevent foreign goldsmiths from settling in London, but they did not\r\n  succeed. The wise men of the craft probably knew that the best\r\n  artists were foreigners, and were willing to profit by observation\r\n  of their works and mode of working. In 1445, thirty-four persons,\r\n  who were strangers, were sworn, and paid 2s. a head. In 1447 Carlos\r\n  Spaen paid £8 : 6 : 8 to the alms of St. Dunstan, to be admitted a\r\n  freeman, and in 1511 John de Loren paid £20 for the same object.\r\n\r\n  The wardens also frequently obliged foreigners applying for the\r\n  freedom to produce testimonials from the authorities of the towns\r\n  abroad where they had resided.\r\n\r\n  The government of the trade under the Company’s charters continued\r\n  up to the reign of Charles the Second. But some time before this\r\n  period, and in the interval between it and the passing of the Act of\r\n  the 12th George II., cap. 26, the powers which had been granted to\r\n  the Company began to be questioned, and the Company experienced\r\n  difficulty in putting them into force. In 1738 the Company\r\n  considered it expedient to obtain an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  And the 12th George II., cap. 26, passed in 1739, was prepared by\r\n  the officers of the Company, brought into Parliament by them, with\r\n  the assent of the government of the time, and all the cost of\r\n  soliciting it and getting it passed was paid for by the Company,\r\n  although it is a public Act.\r\n\r\n  Under this Act the Assay Office is regulated. The Company are\r\n  empowered thereby to make charges for the assaying and marking plate\r\n  sufficient only to defray the expenses of the office, and are\r\n  prohibited from making any profit thereby or deriving any pecuniary\r\n  advantage therefrom.\r\n\r\n  It may here be mentioned that at a very early period we find members\r\n  of the governing body of the Company, both wardens and assistants,\r\n  who were not of the craft. Amongst others, the leading bankers,\r\n  themselves the descendants in trade of the old goldsmiths, from the\r\n  time of the Stuarts to the present time, have been some of the most\r\n  conspicuous members of the body. Amongst them we find the names of\r\n  Sir Martin Bowes, who was Master of the Mint in the reign of\r\n  Elizabeth; Sir Hugh Myddelton, the enterprising founder of the New\r\n  River; Sir Francis Child, of Temple Bar; Sir Charles Duncombe, Sir\r\n  James Pemberton, Sir Robert Vyner; and in the 19th century, Robert\r\n  Williams and Thomas Halifax, Henry Sykes Thornton, William Banbury,\r\n  John Charles Salt, Herbert Barnard, William Newmarch, William\r\n  Cunliffe Brooks, Robert Ruthven Pym, Arthur B. Twining, Charles\r\n  Hoare, and Robert Williams, jun.\r\n\r\n  It remains to mention the connection of the Company with the coinage\r\n  of the realm in what is called the trial of the Pyx, an office which\r\n  has been performed by the Company ever since the reign of Edward I.\r\n  Its object is to ascertain that the metal of which the gold and\r\n  silver money coined by the Mint is composed is standard, and that\r\n  the coins themselves are of the prescribed weight.\r\n\r\n  This duty was performed in ancient times at uncertain intervals, and\r\n  usually had for its immediate object the giving an acquittance to\r\n  the Mint Master, who was bound to the Crown by indentures to coin\r\n  money of the prescribed fineness and weight. But the Coinage Act of\r\n  1870 provides for and establishes an annual trial, and since that\r\n  date the Pyx has been brought to Goldsmiths’ Hall and tried\r\n  annually.\r\n\r\n  In 1900, for the first time, at the request of H.M.’s Treasury, a\r\n  Pyx from each of the Colonial Mints coining Imperial Coinage was\r\n  tried.\r\n\r\n  Formerly a jury of competent freemen, summoned by the wardens, was\r\n  charged by the Lord Chancellor, who subsequently received their\r\n  verdict.\r\n\r\n  The jury is sworn by the Crown Remembrancer, who, the trial having\r\n  been made and the verdict of the jury reduced to writing, attends at\r\n  the Hall and receives them; after which their names are published in\r\n  the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\n  The number of the livery is 150. The Hall is in Foster Lane.\r\n\r\n  Privileges of membership:\r\n\r\n  A freeman of the Company has no advantages as such, except that if\r\n  he be a deserving man and in need of pecuniary assistance he is\r\n  eligible to receive, and would certainly receive, aid from the\r\n  Company, either by pension or donation.\r\n\r\n  When the Guild first had a Hall we know not, but the Hall has stood\r\n  on its present site for upwards of 550 years.\r\n\r\n  About 1340, land and a house at St. Vedast Lane and Ing Lane[2]\r\n  corner, formerly belonging to Sir Nicholas de Segrave, was bought.\r\n  This land still underlies part of the present Hall, and was in the\r\n  midst of the gold- and silver-smiths’ quarter. In 1407, Sir Dru\r\n  Barentine built the Goldsmiths a second Hall, wherefrom a gallery\r\n  led to his house. Within the great hall were arras hangings,\r\n  streamers, banners, tapestried benches, worked cushions, and a\r\n  screen bearing their patron’s (St. Dunstan’s) silver-gilt statue\r\n  bejewelled. There were chambers, parlour, ‘say-house, chapel with\r\n  coloured hangings, great kitchen, vaults, granary, armoury, clerk’s\r\n  house, beadle’s house, assayer’s house. This Hall decayed. Borrowing\r\n  money, they built a third and larger, 1635-40, Stone being surveyor.\r\n\r\n  After the Great Fire they repaired and partly rebuilt their Hall,\r\n  1666-69, raising money slowly. Jarman was architect. The buildings,\r\n  brick and stone, surrounded a paved quadrangle entered through the\r\n  Doric archway in Foster Lane.\r\n\r\n  The great hall was “magnificent” with marbled floor, moulded\r\n  ceiling, pillared screen, high wainscot, painted banners, costly\r\n  plate. Within 140 years they found this Hall decaying. They pulled\r\n  it down and built the present (fourth) Hall in 1830-35, Philip\r\n  Hardwick being architect.\r\n\r\n  Like the Drapers, the Goldsmiths Company has taken up the cause of\r\n  Technical Higher Education.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  On the west side of Foster Lane stood also =St. Leonard’s Church=,\r\n  which was the parish church for St. Martin’s-le-Grand. It was burnt\r\n  down in the Great Fire and its parish annexed to that of Christ\r\n  Church, Newgate Street. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1291.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: the Dean and Canons\r\n  of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, 1291; the Abbot and Convent of\r\n  Westminster, 1509; Henry VIII., who seized it in 1540; the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of Westminster, 1553-54, in whose successors it continues,\r\n  they being the alternate patrons of Christ Church, Newgate Street.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 452.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by and for William de Wyndesore, at the\r\n  Altar of Virgin Mary, before 1368, when his endowment fetched £3 :\r\n  13 : 4. There are few charities recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  The church of =St. Mary Staining= was situated on the north side of\r\n  Oat Lane, Foster Lane, and derived its name Staining from Painter\r\n  Stainers dwelling there; or, according to some from _stein_, the\r\n  Saxon for stone, other churches being built of wood. It was repaired\r\n  and redecorated in 1630, and was burnt down in the Great Fire, but\r\n  not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of St. Michael, Wood\r\n  Street; the site of this church was made a burying-ground. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1270.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prioress and\r\n  Convent of St. Mary, Clerkenwell; Henry VIII., and so continued in\r\n  the Crown till the Great Fire, when the parish was annexed to St.\r\n  Michael, Wood Street.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 98.\r\n\r\n  Two monuments only are recorded by Stow, one in memory of George\r\n  Smithes, goldsmith and alderman, who died in 1615, and the other of\r\n  Sir Arthur Savage, knighted at Cadiz in 1596, who was General of\r\n  Queen Elizabeth’s forces in France at the siege of Amiens; he died\r\n  in 1632.\r\n\r\n  The parish received three legacies, payable yearly, namely: 15s. 6d.\r\n  from Lady Read and Mr. Hill; £1 : 4s. from Mr. Lawne; and 1s. 6d.\r\n  from Mr. Dean.\r\n\r\nWhat Gresham Street is on the north of our present section, so =Watling\r\nStreet= is on the south. It runs roughly parallel with Cheapside and\r\nPoultry. Stow says of it:\r\n\r\n“Then for Watheling Street, which Leland called Atheling, or Noble\r\nStreet; but since he showeth no reason why, I rather take it to be so\r\nnamed of that great highway of the same calling. True it is that at the\r\npresent the inhabitants thereof are wealthy drapers, retaillers of\r\nwoollen cloths, both broad and narrow, of all sorts, more than in any\r\none street of this city.”\r\n\r\nHow came Watling Street, the old country road, into the City? The old\r\nRoman road, as it approached the Thames, passed down the Edgware Road.\r\nWhere is now the Marble Arch it divided into two, of which the older\r\npart crossed the marsh, and so over Thorney Island? The other ran along\r\nwhat is now Oxford Street and Holborn.\r\n\r\nIt then crossed the valley of the Fleet and entered the City at the New\r\nGate. If now we draw a line from Newgate to London Stone, just south of\r\nits present position, we shall find that it passes the north-east course\r\nof St. Paul’s precinct, cutting it off, so to speak, and meets the\r\npresent Watling Street where it bends to the south of Bow Lane; it then\r\nfollows the old Budge Row as far as the Stone. That was the original\r\nWatling Lane of the City. The Saxons, however, who found the streets a\r\nmass of confused ruins, built over part of the old Watling, and\r\ncontinued it as far as the south-east course of St. Paul’s. The street\r\nhas few antiquities apart from its churches.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of Watling Street in Riley’s _Memorials_.\r\n\r\nIn the Calendar of Wills we find shops in this street in 1307, a brewery\r\nin 1341, a widow’s mansion in 1349, and shops in 1361, “lands,\r\ntenements, and rents” in 1373, a house called “le Strelpas” in 1397. The\r\nother references to Watling Street are those of “tenements” only.\r\n\r\nThe yearly procession of the City rectors with the mayor and aldermen\r\nstarted from St. Peter’s, Cornhill, marched along Chepe as far as St.\r\nPaul’s Churchyard, turning to the south and so to “Watling Street\r\nClose,” which was the eastern entrance to the churchyard.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire, while the rubbish was being cleared away, on the east of\r\nthe street were discovered nine wells in a row. They were supposed to\r\nhave belonged to a street of houses from Watling Street to Cheapside.\r\nBut one hardly expects to find a well in every house.\r\n\r\nIn Watling Street and its continuation, Budge Row, were the following\r\nchurches, beginning at the west end: St. Augustine’s; Allhallows, Bread\r\nStreet; St. Mary Aldermary; St. Anthony’s. For St. Augustine’s see p.\r\n62, and for Allhallows see p. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. MARY ALDERMARY\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Mary Aldermary stands in a triangle formed by Bow\r\n  Lane, Queen Victoria Street, and Watling Street. It is called Alder,\r\n  Older, or Elder, Mary, from its being the oldest church in the City\r\n  having that dedication. Sir Henry Keble, Lord Mayor in 1510, began\r\n  to rebuild it, and left at his death £1000 towards its completion;\r\n  this was augmented by William Rodoway and Richard Pierson in 1626.\r\n  The building was destroyed by the Great Fire, but rebuilt by Wren in\r\n  1681-82. For this purpose the legacy of £5000 was applied, which had\r\n  been left by Henry Rogers for the rebuilding of a church;\r\n  stipulation, however, was made that the new church should be an\r\n  exact imitation of Keble’s, so that Wren was forced to adopt methods\r\n  very different from his own. The building was greatly restored in\r\n  1876-77. The church now serves for four parishes—its original one,\r\n  that of St. Thomas the Apostle, of St. Antholin, and of St. John the\r\n  Baptist. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1233.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of Henry III., 1233;\r\n  the Prior and Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, 1288, who\r\n  exchanged it with the Archbishop of Canterbury, 1401, in whose\r\n  successors it continued up to 1666, when the parish of St. Thomas\r\n  was annexed; and thus the Archbishop shared the patronage\r\n  alternately with the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 400.\r\n\r\n  The church is in the Tudor style of architecture, and consists of a\r\n  nave, chancel, and two side aisles, separated from the central part\r\n  by clustered columns and slightly pointed arches. It is 100 feet\r\n  long, 63 feet broad, and about 45 feet high. The north side of the\r\n  chancel is longer than the south, which gives the church a somewhat\r\n  curious appearance. The tower, the upper portion of which was\r\n  rebuilt about 1701, contains four storeys, with an open parapet, and\r\n  is surmounted by four pinnacles. The total height is 135 feet.\r\n\r\n  Sir Henry Keble, the founder of the original church, was buried\r\n  here, and a monument erected to him in 1534; also Sir William\r\n  Laxton, mayor, 1556, and Henry Gold, one of the rectors here, who\r\n  was executed at Tyburn in 1534. “The Holy Maid of Kent” was also\r\n  buried here. The monuments in the present church are of little\r\n  interest. Over the west door there is a Latin inscription recording\r\n  the munificence of Henry Rogers. Mr. Garret gave £100 to the\r\n  lecturer of this church, to endure as long as the Gospel was\r\n  preached. The particulars of the numerous other gifts and charities\r\n  did not come into the possession of Stow. There were two almshouses\r\n  for the poor of the Salters Company, who are four in number, each of\r\n  whom has an allowance of 1s. per week.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Browne (d. 1673), chaplain to Charles I., was rector here;\r\n  also Robert Gell (1595-1665), Fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge;\r\n  Offspring Blackall (1654-1716), Bishop of Exeter; White Kennett\r\n  (1660-1728), Bishop of Peterborough; Henry Ware, Bishop of\r\n  Chichester; Henry Gold, who was executed at Tyburn, 1534; George\r\n  Lavington, D.D. (1684-1762), Bishop of Exeter.\r\n\r\n=Budge Row=, northward, was spelt Begerow in 1376. Of it Stow says: “So\r\ncalled of Budge fur and the Skinners dwelling there.”\r\n\r\nAt the south-western corner of Sise Lane, in Budge Row, there is a\r\nrectangular railed-in space about a dozen feet by six, sheltered by the\r\ncorner of the adjoining house. Against the wall, facing eastward, is a\r\nmonument in stone of considerable size. Two columns with Corinthian\r\ncapitals support an architrave, and enclose a view in slight relief of\r\n=St. Antholin’s= as it was. Beneath the view are the words:\r\n\r\n  Here stood the parish church of St. Antholin, destroyed in the Great\r\n  Fire, A.D. 1666, rebuilt 1677 by Sir Christopher Wren, architect.\r\n\r\nOn the bases of the columns are inscribed the names of the churchwardens\r\nof St. Antholin’s and St. John Baptist’s, Walbrook, respectively. While\r\nthe following inscription is beneath:\r\n\r\n  The change of population in the City during two centuries rendering\r\n  the church no longer necessary, it was taken down A.D. 1875, under\r\n  the Act of Parliament for uniting City Benefices; the funds derived\r\n  from the sale of the site were devoted in part to the Restoration of\r\n  the neighbouring church of St. Mary Aldermary, where are also\r\n  erected the monumental tablets removed from St. Antholin, and the\r\n  erection at Nunhead of another church dedicated to St. Antholin\r\n  greatly needed in that thickly populated district.\r\n\r\nAnd again, right across the bases of the pillars and the stone, run the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  In a vault beneath are deposited the greater part of the human\r\n  remains removed from the Old church. The remainder are laid in a\r\n  vault in the City of London Cemetery at Ilford, where also a\r\n  monument marks the place of interment.\r\n\r\n  The Church of =St. Anthony= or =Antholin= stood on the north side of\r\n  Budge Row, at the corner of Shoe Lane, in Cordwainer Street Ward. It\r\n  derived its name from being dedicated to St. Anthony of Vienna, who\r\n  had a cell here founded by Henry II., but it is not known when the\r\n  church was first built. About 1399 it was rebuilt, and again in\r\n  1513, but the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed it. From Wren’s design it\r\n  was rebuilt, and completed in 1682; it was remarkable for its tower,\r\n  with a spire all of freestone. In 1874 the building (except the\r\n  steeple) was taken down, and in 1876 the steeple was also\r\n  demolished, the materials of which were sold for £5. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1181.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was always in the hands of the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s, who granted one part to John, son of Wizo the\r\n  goldsmith, about 1141.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 240.\r\n\r\n  In 1623 a very beautiful gallery was added to the church, every\r\n  division of which (52 in number) was filled with the arms of kings,\r\n  queens, and princes of the kingdom, from Edward the Confessor to\r\n  Frederick, Count Palatine of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Nicholas Bole, citizen and skinner,\r\n  at the Altar of St. Katherine, to which William Pykon was admitted\r\n  chaplain, 1390, on the resignation of Richard Hale—the endowment\r\n  fetched £6 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Robert Smythe was chaplain; John\r\n  Grantham, whose endowment fetched £4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  In this church Thomas Hind and Hugh Acton, benefactors to the\r\n  parish, were buried. There was also a monument to William Daunsey,\r\n  mercer and alderman of the City.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of gifts and charities were: the Mercers and\r\n  Drapers, of £6 respectively; Sir William Craven and William Parker,\r\n  £100, to which £118 were added by the parishioners, for establishing\r\n  a daily lecture. There were a considerable number of charities in\r\n  this parish.\r\n\r\n  Among the rectors of this church were William Colwyn, who made a\r\n  recantation at St. Paul’s Cross, Advent 1541, and Thomas Lamplugh\r\n  (1615-91), Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the street extends for some way a really old\r\nbrick building, evidently built immediately after the Fire. Over a\r\ncentre window is a curved pediment of brickwork. Beneath, an opening\r\nleads into a yard, and the building is used by Stationers. The west side\r\nof the lane is modern.\r\n\r\n=St. Pancras Lane= was formerly Needlers’ Lane. The church, the parish,\r\nthe chantries and endowments, and the parishioners are mentioned\r\nfrequently in the _Calendar of Wills_. The earliest entry there is of\r\nA.D. 1273, where John Hervy bequeaths to Juliana his daughter his\r\nmansion in the parish of St. Pancras, and to his daughter Johanna his\r\nshop in the parish of Colechurch. The Lane, except that it contained two\r\nparish churches, was of little importance.\r\n\r\nPancras Lane is an open space, once the graveyard of St. Pancras, Soper\r\nLane. The houses are dull brick and stucco. The graveyard bears a great\r\nsimilarity to all that is left of the others; it is covered with dingy\r\ngravel and decorated by blackened evergreens. The iron gate bears a\r\nlittle shield telling that it was erected in 1886. There are one or two\r\ntombs still left.\r\n\r\n  The Church of =St. Pancras, Soper Lane=, stood near a street called\r\n  Soper Lane, but since the Fire called Queen Street. It was repaired\r\n  1621, and in 1624 Thomas Chapman the younger built a porch to it.\r\n  The building was destroyed by the Great Fire, when its parish was\r\n  annexed to that of St. Mary-le-Bow. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1312.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, who granted it, April 25,\r\n  1365, to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in whose successors it\r\n  continued up to 1666, when the church was destroyed in the Great\r\n  Fire and the parish annexed to St. Mary-le-Bow.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 146.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: John Causton at the Altar of St.\r\n  Anne, which was augmented by Simon Rice and Lettice his wife, before\r\n  1356, to which William de la Temple was presented by the King,\r\n  January 10, 1374-75—the endowment was valued at £13 in 1548, when\r\n  Adam Arnolde was priest; Margaret Reynolds, who bequeathed £233 :\r\n  6 : 8, which the Mercers had, and guaranteed a rent charge of £8 :\r\n  13 : 4 for the same to find a priest.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained monuments to John Stockton, mercer\r\n  and mayor, 1470; Richard Gardener, mercer and mayor, 1478; and\r\n  Thomas Knowles, twice Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n  Two charitable gifts are recorded by Stow, the donors of which were\r\n  Thomas Chapman, whose benefaction was lost by Stow’s time, and\r\n  Thomas Chapman his son, to the amount of £11 : 3 : 8.\r\n\r\nOnly a few steps farther on is another melancholy little spot, with a\r\nstone slab on the wall near with inscription as follows: “Before the\r\ndreadful Fire, Anno 1666, stood the church of St. Benet Sherehog.” The\r\nrailing and low wall were put up in 1842. Within the enclosure stands a\r\ntomb over the “Family Vault of Michael Davison, 1676.”\r\n\r\n  The church was called =St. Benet Sherehog=, from one Benedict\r\n  Shorne, or Shrog, or Shorehog, who was connected with it in the\r\n  reign of Edward II. It was repaired in 1628, but destroyed by the\r\n  Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to St. Stephen,\r\n  Walbrook, and its site made into a burying-ground. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1285.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior and\r\n  Convent of St. Mary Overy, of Southwark, 1324; then the Crown, since\r\n  Henry VIII. seized it in 1542.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For Ralph le Fever and Lucy his\r\n  wife—the endowment fetched £3 : 11 : 8 in 1548, when Anthony Gyplyn,\r\n  lately deceased, had been priest; for Thomas Romayn and Julia his\r\n  wife, to which John de Loughebourgh was admitted, August 12, 1326.\r\n\r\n  Edward Hall, who wrote the large chronicle from Richard II. to Henry\r\n  VIII., was buried here. The church formerly contained a monument to\r\n  Sir Ralph Warren, twice Lord Mayor of London, who died in 1553. Mrs.\r\n  Katherine Philips of Cardigan, the poetess, who died in 1664, was\r\n  also buried here.\r\n\r\n  Only one charitable gift is recorded by Stow in this parish, that of\r\n  £5 per annum left by Mr. Davison for keeping his family vault in\r\n  repair. Some of this was used for charitable purposes.\r\n\r\n  John Wakering (d. 1425), Bishop of Norwich, was rector here.\r\n\r\n=Queen Street= was constructed in part after the Fire, and covers the\r\nold Soper Lane, so called from the soap-makers who formerly lived here\r\n(though Stow wants to derive the name from an ancient resident). The\r\nsouth end, leading to the river, seems to have been the later part.\r\n\r\nSoper Lane is mentioned in the _Calendar of Wills_ as early as 1259,\r\nwhen Nicholas Bat, a member of the old City family of that name,\r\nbequeathed to his wife rents in Sopers’ Lane.\r\n\r\nHere, in 1297, there sprang up an evening market—“Eve Chepynge”—called\r\nthe New Fair. It was established against the knowledge of the mayor by\r\n“strangers, foreigners, and beggars,” and was the cause of many deeds\r\nmade possible by selling in the dark, and of much strife and violence.\r\nTherefore it was abolished.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward II. Soper Lane was the market-place of the\r\nPepperers; seventy years later of the Curriers and Cordwainers. In the\r\nreign of Queen Mary there were many shops here for the sale of pies.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1316 the “good folks in Soper Lane, of the trade of\r\nPepperers,” agreed upon certain regulations for the observance of the\r\ntrade and the prevention of dishonesty.\r\n\r\nIn 1375 we find cordwainers between Soper Lane and the Conduit.\r\n\r\nThe name of Size Lane is derived from St. Osyth.\r\n\r\nFor =Bucklersbury= we will first let Stow speak:\r\n\r\n“Bucklersbury, so called of a manor and tenements pertaining to one\r\nBuckle, who there dwelt and kept his courts. This manor is supposed to\r\nbe the great stone building, yet in part remaining on the south side of\r\nthe street, which of late time hath been called the Old Barge, of such a\r\nsign hanged out near the gate thereof. This manor or great house hath of\r\nlong time been divided and letten out into many tenements; and it hath\r\nbeen a common speech, that when Walbrooke did lie open, barges were\r\nrowed out of the Thames, or towed up so far, and therefore the place\r\nhath ever since been called the Old Barge.\r\n\r\n“Also on the north side of this street, directly over against the said\r\nBucklersbury, was one ancient and strong tower of stone, the which tower\r\nKing Edward III., in the 18th of his reign, by the name of the king’s\r\nhouse, called Cornet stoure in London, did appoint to be his Exchange of\r\nmoney there to be kept. In the 29th he granted it to Frydus Guynysane\r\nand Landus Bardoile, merchants of Luke, for twenty pounds the year. And\r\nin the 32nd he gave the same tower to his college or free chapel of St.\r\nStephen at Westminster, by the name of Cornet Stoure at Bucklersbury in\r\nLondon. This tower of late years was taken down by one Buckle, a grocer,\r\nmeaning in place thereof to have set up and built a goodly frame of\r\ntimber; but the said Buckle greedily labouring to pull down the old\r\ntower, a part thereof fell upon him, which so sore bruised him that his\r\nlife was thereby shortened, and another that married his widow set up\r\nthe new prepared frame of timber, and finished the work.\r\n\r\n“This whole street called Bucklersbury on both the sides throughout is\r\npossessed of grocers and apothecaries towards the west end thereof: on\r\nthe south side breaketh out one other short lane called in records\r\nPeneritch street; it reacheth but to St. Sythe’s Lane, and St. Sythe’s\r\nchurch is the farthest part thereof, for by the west end of the said\r\nchurch beginneth Needler’s Lane, which reacheth to Soper Lane, as is\r\naforesaid” (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 276).\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name of Bucklersbury is Bukerel, and not Buckle;\r\nBukerel was the name of an old City family. Andrew Bukerel was mayor\r\nfrom 1231 to 1236.\r\n\r\nMany Roman antiquities, pavements, bronzes, Samian ware, spoons, etc.,\r\nhave been found in Bucklersbury. A bronze armlet also found there may\r\nbelong to pre-Roman times. The street is mentioned in many ancient\r\ndocuments, beginning with the thirteenth century. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury there were tenements here known as “Sylvestre tour” assigned by\r\nthe Dean of St. Stephen, Westminster, to the Dean and Chapter of St.\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, druggists, furriers,\r\nherbalists, and tobacconists had shops in Bucklersbury.\r\n\r\nIn 1688 there was a Roman Catholic chapel in Bucklersbury, which was one\r\nof those destroyed or burned by the mob, chiefly consisting of London\r\napprentices, during the riots pending the arrival of the Prince of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\nAn argument between the Dean and Canons of St. Paul’s and a carpenter of\r\nBucklersbury shows that the parish of St. Benet Sherehog was called in\r\n1406 the parish of St. Osyth, in which part of Bucklersbury stood. In\r\n1455 the former name is given to the parish.\r\n\r\nBucklersbury was cut in two when Queen Victoria Street was made. The\r\nupper portion consists chiefly of large modern many-windowed business\r\nhouses. Near the north-east corner there is an old brick house\r\ncontaining part of Pimm’s restaurant. In the southern half Barge Yard is\r\nmodern. The Bourse Buildings, occupied by a great number of engineers,\r\naccountants, and business men of all sorts, take up a large part of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nPassing westward we come to =Bow Lane=, which was formerly called in the\r\nlower part Hosier Lane, from the trade of those who occupied it, and in\r\nthe upper part, for a similar reason, Cordwainers’ Street.\r\n\r\nThe street spoken of in the _Calendar of Wills_ by the name of Hosier\r\nLane belonged to the parish of St. Sepulchre without the wall. The same\r\nstreet is mentioned in Riley’s _Memorials_.\r\n\r\nFor the Church of St. Mary-le-Bow see p. 10.\r\n\r\nIn its modern aspect Bow Lane is not uninteresting.\r\n\r\nA covered entry, inappropriately named New Court, leads into a\r\nfascinating corner. There is a gateway really and ruinously old; it is\r\nsaid to have survived the Fire. The ironwork pattern is lost now in\r\nmeaningless and broken twists, though there is a semblance of what might\r\nhave been a monogram over the centre gate. The houses all round the\r\ncourt evidently date from the period directly after the Fire. That\r\nfacing the street is of red brick toned by age, and is said to have been\r\nthe residence of a Lord Mayor. The others are of dark brick, picked out\r\nin red. No. 5 contains the offices of the _Financial World_.\r\n\r\nBeyond it a narrow passage leads at an angle round to the churchyard. A\r\nmore spacious way runs beside the church itself. At the corner of this\r\nis a polished granite drinking fountain, erected in 1859, supporting\r\ngreen painted dolphins.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard a scene of confusion and turmoil daily takes place on\r\nthe pavement which lies over the bones of the “ancient dead.” Great\r\nwooden crates and packing-cases are littered about. They are from that\r\nlarge modern building on the west, facing the church, belonging to\r\nwarehousemen and manufacturers. But one old seventeenth-century house,\r\nof a date immediately succeeding the Fire, remains, on the south side of\r\nthe churchyard, facing Cheapside. Its quiet blackened bricks and flat\r\nwindows have beheld many a change of scene on the stage before it. The\r\nground-floor windows and doorway are connected by an ornamental cornice.\r\nThe red bricks of the church in Bow Lane contrast with a long narrow\r\nbuilding of the eighteenth century which is squeezed against them. These\r\ncontrast with the gaping cellars and basements of the more modern\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nOf =Bread Street= there is very early mention. In 1204 the leprous women\r\nof St. James’s received a charter respecting a certain tenement in\r\nChepe, at the head of Bread Street; in 1290 this tenement again becomes\r\nthe subject of a charter. In 1263 there was a fire which consumed a part\r\nof Bread Street.\r\n\r\n“So called of bread in old time there sold: for it appeareth by records,\r\nthat in the year 1302, which was the 30th of Edward I., the bakers of\r\nLondon were bound to sell no bread in their shops or houses, but in the\r\nmarket: and that they should have four hall-motes in the year, at four\r\nseveral terms, to determine of enormities belonging to the said Company.\r\n\r\n“Bread Street is now wholly inhabited by rich traders; and divers fair\r\ninns be there, for good receipt of carriers and other travellers to the\r\ncity. It appears in the will of Edward Stafford, Earl of Wyltshire,\r\ndated the 22nd of March, 1498, and 14 Hen. VII., that he lived in a\r\nhouse in Bread-street in London, which belonged to the family of\r\nStafford, Duke of Bucks afterwards; he bequeathing all the stuff in that\r\nhouse to the Lord of Buckingham, for he died without issue” (Strype,\r\nvol. i. pp. 686-687).\r\n\r\nThe bakers gave continual trouble to the City by their light-weight\r\nloaves and their bad bread. When they were “wanted” by the alderman they\r\ngat themselves out of the City and to their hills beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the mayor. It was ordained, in order to meet this\r\ndifficulty, that the servants who sell the bread thus complained of\r\nshould be punished as if they were masters. It was also discovered that\r\n“hostelers and habergeons” bought bread in the market and sold it to\r\ntheir guests at a profit. This was not allowed in mediæval times. It was\r\nordered that every loaf was to be bought of a baker, with his special\r\nstamp, and sold at the price regulated by the assize of bread.\r\n\r\nBut there were others besides bakers who used the market of Bread\r\nStreet, Cheapside; it became a place for cooks. In 1351, one Henry\r\nPecche bought a caper pasty of Henry de Passelowe, cook at the Stocks,\r\nand found on opening it that the fowl was putrid. The case coming before\r\nthe mayor, experts were called in, among them six cooks of Bread Street\r\nand three of Ironmonger Lane. The story shows how the exclusive\r\ncharacter of a market had to be broken up for the conveniences of the\r\npeople. Here we have cooks carrying on their trade in three different\r\nparts of the great market of Chepe. A few years later, one of the Bread\r\nStreet cooks, John Welburgh Man by name, was convicted by the evidence\r\nof his neighbours of selling a pie of conger, knowing the fish to be\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nIn 1595 a singular discovery was made at the north-east end of this\r\nstreet. In the construction of a vault was found, 15 feet deep, a “fair”\r\npavement, and at the farther end a tree sawed into five steps—Stow says:\r\n“which was to step over some brook running out of the west towards\r\nWalbrooke; and upon the edge of the said brook, as it seemeth, there\r\nwere found lying along the bodies of two great trees, the ends whereof\r\nwere then sawed off, and firm timber as at the first when they fell,\r\npart of the said trees remain yet in the ground undigged. It was all\r\nforced ground until they went past the trees aforesaid, which was about\r\nseventeen feet deep or better; thus much hath the ground of this city in\r\nthat place been raised from the main.”\r\n\r\nThe first turning to the east going down Bread Street was, until\r\nrecently, called the Spread Eagle Court. One of the corner houses of\r\nthis court is supposed to have been the work-place of John Milton, whose\r\nfather traded under the sign of the “Spread Eagle.” He was baptized in\r\nthe church of Allhallows. House and church were destroyed in the Fire,\r\nbut the register remains.\r\n\r\nOn the corner house between Watling and Bread Streets is a stone slab\r\nfixed to the wall; this bears a bust of the poet in _alto relievo_. The\r\nrest of the building, which runs along Watling Street as far as Red Lion\r\nCourt, is in new red brick, dated 1878. It has ornamental brickwork and\r\nfestoons here and there, and the roof terminates in curiously shaped\r\ngables, some of which follow the old shell pattern. The doorways and\r\nwindows are carried out in stone. The penthouse pediment over Milton’s\r\nbust is also in brick. Beneath, two little red cherubs hold a laurel\r\nwreath. Below the head is the one word—Milton; and lower follows the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n   Born in Bread Street, 1608.\r\n   Baptized in the Church of Allhallows, which stood here ante 1678.\r\n\r\nThe Mermaid, like many other London inns, stood in a court with an\r\nentrance from Friday Street and from Bread Street.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of Bread Street, on a site which, when Stow wrote, was\r\noccupied by “large houses for merchants and fair inns for passengers,”\r\nstood the Bread Street Compter, one of the two sheriffs’ prisons. As we\r\nhave seen, it was later removed to Wood Street.\r\n\r\nBehind St. Mildred’s Church stood =Gerard’s Hall=, the entrance from\r\nBasing Lane. Of this place Stow speaks at length:\r\n\r\n“On the south side of this lane is one great house, of old time built\r\nupon arched vaults, and with arched gates of stone, brought from Caen in\r\nNormandy. The same is now a common hostrey for receipt of travellers,\r\ncommonly and corruptly called Gerards hall, of a giant said to have\r\ndwelt there. In the high-roofed hall of this house sometime stood a\r\nlarge fir pole, which reached to the roof thereof, and was said to be\r\none of the staves that Gerard the giant used in the wars to run withal.\r\nThere stood also a ladder of the same length, which (as they say) served\r\nto ascend to the top of the staff. Of later years this hall is altered\r\nin building, and divers rooms are made in it. Notwithstanding, the pole\r\nis removed to one corner of the hall, and the ladder hanged broken upon\r\na wall in the yard. The hosteler of that house said to me, ‘the pole\r\nlacketh half a foot of forty in length’: I measured the compass thereof,\r\nand found it fifteen inches.\r\n\r\n“I read that John Gisors, mayor of London in the year 1245, was owner\r\nthereof, and that Sir John Gisors, knight, mayor of London, and\r\nconstable of the Tower 1311, and divers others of that name and family,\r\nsince that time owned it. William Gisors was one of the sheriffs 1329.\r\nMore, John Gisors had issue, Henry and John; which John had issue,\r\nThomas; which Thomas deceasing in the year 1350, left unto his son\r\nThomas his messuage called Gisor’s Hall, in the parish of St. Mildred in\r\nBread Street: John Gisors made a feoffment thereof, 1386, etc. So it\r\nappeareth that this Gisor’s Hall, of late time by corruption hath been\r\ncalled Gerard’s Hall for Gisor’s Hall; as Bosom’s inn for Blossom’s inn,\r\nBevis Marks for Buries Marks, Marke Lane, for Marte Lane, Belliter Lane\r\nfor Belsetter’s Lane, Gutter Lane for Guthuruns Lane, Cry Church for\r\nChrist’s Church, St. Michel in the Querne for St. Michel at corne, and\r\nsundry such others. Out of this Gisor’s Hall, at the first building\r\nthereof, were made divers arched doors, yet to be seen, which seem not\r\nsufficient for any great monster, or other man of common stature to pass\r\nthrough, the pole in the hall might be used of old time (as then the\r\ncustom was in every parish), to be set up in the summer as May-pole,\r\nbefore the principal house in the parish or street, and to stand in the\r\nhall before the screen, decked with holme and ivy, at the feast of\r\nChristmas. The ladder served for the decking of the may-pole and roof of\r\nthe hall. Thus much for Gisor’s hall, and for that side of Bread street,\r\nmay suffice” (Stow’s _Survey_, 393-394).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GERARD’S HALL CRYPT IN 1795\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe crypt of this house escaped the Fire. On its site was erected an inn\r\ncalled Gerard’s Hall, which contained seventy-eight bedrooms, and was\r\none of the principal hotels of the City. The whole was removed for the\r\nconstruction of Cannon Street; Basing Lane, which ran from Bread Street\r\nto Bow Lane, disappeared at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. MILDRED, BREAD STREET\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Mildred, Bread Street, still stands. It is on the\r\n  east side of the street, a little to the south of Cannon Street, and\r\n  is supposed to have been rebuilt in 1300 by Lord Trenchaunt, of St.\r\n  Alban’s, knight, whose monument was in the church. It was destroyed\r\n  by the Great Fire and rebuilt by Wren in 1683, when the parish of\r\n  St. Margaret Moses was annexed. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1170.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, who had it in 1300, and\r\n  granted it to John Incent and John Oliver, 1333; the above Prior and\r\n  Convent.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 216.\r\n\r\n  The present church measures 62 feet in length, and 36 feet in\r\n  breadth, while the total height, to the summit of the cupola, is 52\r\n  feet. The interior remains practically in its original state. The\r\n  carvings about the altar-piece and pulpit are attributed to Grinling\r\n  Gibbons. The steeple, which rises at the south-east, consists of a\r\n  plain brick tower, lantern, and slender spire culminating in a ball\r\n  and vane. The total height is 140 feet, but only the upper portion\r\n  is visible, owing to the buildings surrounding it.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by Stephen Bull, citizen, of which Thomas\r\n  Chapman was chaplain, April 26, 1453.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained monuments to: Lord Trenchaunt, a\r\n  great benefactor, who was buried here about 1300; also Sir John\r\n  Shadworth, mayor, 1401, who gave a parsonage house and other gifts\r\n  to the church. Here too John Ireland and Ellis Crispe were buried in\r\n  1614 and 1625, the grandfather and father of Sir Nicholas Crispe,\r\n  the devoted adherent of Charles I., who is greatly eulogised for his\r\n  loyalty by Dr. Johnson; he died in 1666.\r\n\r\n  Few details of the charities belonging to the parish are recorded by\r\n  Stow; Thomas Langham and Mr. Coppinger being the only names\r\n  mentioned besides those commemorated by monuments.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Mangey (1688-1755), D.D., Prebendary of Durham, was a rector\r\n  here; also Hugh Oldham (d. 1519) of Exeter.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of Allhallows, Bread Street=, stood on the east side of\r\n  the street. In 1625 the building was repaired, but ruined by the\r\n  Great Fire shortly after. It was subsequently rebuilt. In 1878 it\r\n  was taken down. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1284.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior and\r\n  Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury; Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\n  April 24, 1365, by gift (1284-85) from the above, in whose\r\n  successors it continued up to 1666, when St. John’s, Watling Street,\r\n  was annexed to it, these being annexed to St. Mary-le-Bow by Order\r\n  in Council dated July 21, 1876.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  On the south side of the chancel there was a small part of the\r\n  church, called “The Salters’ Chapel,” containing a window with the\r\n  figure of the donor, Thomas Beaumont, wrought upon it. The church\r\n  originally had a steeple, but in 1559 it was destroyed by lightning\r\n  and not restored. The King granted a licence to Roger Paryt and\r\n  Roger Stagenhow to found a guild in honour of our Lord, April 12,\r\n  1394 (Pat. 17 Rd. II. p. 2 m. 15). Some of the most notable\r\n  monuments were those of Thomas Beaumont of the Company of Salters,\r\n  John Dunster, a benefactor of the church, and Arthur Baron.\r\n\r\n  The following were among the numerous benefactors: David Cocke,\r\n  £100; William Parker, £100; John Dunster, £200, to be laid out in\r\n  lands and tenements; Edward Rudge, £200, to be laid out in lands and\r\n  tenements; Lady Middleton, £100.\r\n\r\n  The most notable rectors of the church were: William Lyndwood (d.\r\n  1446), Chancellor to the Archbishop of Canterbury; Thomas Langton\r\n  (d. 1501), Bishop of St. David’s. John Milton was baptized in this\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  A tablet formerly affixed to the exterior of the church in\r\n  commemoration of the event was put up outside St. Mary-le-Bow after\r\n  the destruction of Allhallows.\r\n\r\n=Friday Street.=—“So called,” says Stow, “of fishmongers dwelling there,\r\nand serving Friday’s market.” In the roll of the Scrope and Grosvenor\r\ncontroversy, the poet Chaucer is recorded as giving evidence connected\r\nwith this street, for when he was once in Friday Street he observed a\r\nsign with the arms of Scrope hanging out; and on his asking what they\r\ndid there, was told they were put there by Sir Robert Grosvenor.\r\n\r\nCunningham also notes as follows: “The Nag’s Head Tavern, at the\r\nCheapside corner of Friday Street, was the pretended scene of the\r\nconsecration of Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth. The real consecration took place in the adjoining\r\nchurch of St. Mary-le-Bow; but the Roman Catholics chose to lay the\r\nscene in a tavern. ‘The White Horse,’ another tavern in Friday Street,\r\nmakes a conspicuous figure in the _Merry Conceited Jests of George\r\nPeele_. In this street, in 1695, at the ‘Wednesdays Clubs,’ as they were\r\ncalled, certain well-known conferences took place, under the direction\r\nof William Paterson, which ultimately led to the establishment of the\r\nBank of England.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1247, certain lands in Friday Street are held by the nuns of\r\n“Halliwelle.” In 1258, one William Eswy, mercer, bequeathed to the Earl\r\nof Gloucester all his tenements in Friday Street for 100 marks, wherein\r\nhe was bound to the Earl, and for robes, capes, and other goods received\r\nfrom him. In 1278, Walter de Vaus left to Thomas, his uncle, shops in\r\nFriday Street. Therefore in the thirteenth century the street was\r\nalready a lane of shops. The date shows that the former character of\r\nChepe market as a broad open space set with booths and stalls had\r\nalready undergone great modifications. Other early references to the\r\nstreet show that it was one of shops. Chaucer’s evidence shows that a\r\nhundred years later there were “hostelers” or “herbergeours” living\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn 1363, certain citizens subscribed money as a present to the King.\r\nAmong them is one Thomas, a scrivener of Friday Street, and in 1370 we\r\nfind one Adam Lovekyn in possession of a seld which has been used for\r\ntime out of mind by foreign tanners. He complains that they no longer\r\ncome to him, but keep their wares in hostels and go about the streets\r\nselling them in secret.\r\n\r\nIn Friday Street at the corner in Watling Street is a railed-in space,\r\nall that remains of an old churchyard, the churchyard of St. John the\r\nEvangelist. This is a piece of ground containing very few square yards,\r\nseparated from the street by high iron railings, and filled with stunted\r\nlaurel bushes and other evergreens. A hard gravel walk runs round a\r\ncircular bed of bushes, and on one side stands a raised tomb-like\r\nerection. On the wall are one or two slabs indicating the names of those\r\nwho are buried in the vault below.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. John the Evangelist= was burnt down in the Great\r\n  Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to Allhallows, Bread\r\n  Street, and both of these to St. Mary-le-Bow, by Order in Council,\r\n  1876. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1354.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, before 1354; Henry VIII.\r\n  seized it in 1540; the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church,\r\n  Canterbury, 1546 up to 1666, when it was annexed to Allhallows,\r\n  Bread Street.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 100.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by William de Angre, before 1361, whose\r\n  endowment fetched £8 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when John Taylor was\r\n  chaplain. No monuments of any note are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\nIn the north part of Friday Street is Blue Boar Court on the east side.\r\nThis court was rebuilt in 1896, but previous to this was surrounded by\r\nold houses. One of these, No. 56, was interesting as having been the\r\nCity home of Richard Cobden until 1845. It is said that this house was\r\nbuilt on the site of a garden attached to Sir Hugh Myddelton’s house in\r\nCheapside. The cellars beneath the building once covered the bullion\r\nbelonging to the Bank of England. This was at the time when the Bank was\r\nin a room of the old Grocers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Matthew, Friday Street=, was situated on the west\r\n  side of the street near Cheapside. It was burnt down in the Great\r\n  Fire, and rebuilt from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in 1685;\r\n  it was then made the parish church for this and St. Peter’s,\r\n  Westcheap, which was annexed to it. About 1887 the building was\r\n  pulled down. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1322.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot and\r\n  Convent of St. Peter, Westminster, 1322, then Henry VIII., who\r\n  seized it and gave it to the Bishop of Westminster, January 20,\r\n  1540-41; the Bishop of London, March 3, 1553-54; it continued in his\r\n  successors up to 1666, when St. Peter’s, Cheapside, was annexed, and\r\n  the patronage was shared alternately with the patron of that parish.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 200.\r\n\r\n  The church was plain, without aisles, measuring 64 feet by 33 feet\r\n  and having a tower 74 feet high.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Adam de Bentley, goldsmith, for\r\n  himself and Matilda his wife, to which Adam Ipolite de Pontefracto\r\n  was admitted chaplain, June 14, 1334; by Thomas Wyrlyngworth, at the\r\n  Altar of St. Katherine, to which John Donyngton was admitted\r\n  chaplain, November 13, 1391: the King granted his licence, June 16,\r\n  1404; by John Martyn, whose endowment fetched £10 in 1548, when\r\n  Henry Coldewell was priest, “70 years of age, meanly learned”; for\r\n  Nicholas Twyford, _miles_, about 1400.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained monuments to Sir Nicholas Twyford,\r\n  goldsmith and mayor, who died 1583, also Sir Edward Clark, Lord\r\n  Mayor in 1696. Sir Hugh Myddelton, the designer of the New River,\r\n  was a parishioner, and was buried here in 1631.\r\n\r\n  A legacy of £5 a year was left to the poor of the parish by Mrs.\r\n  Cole.\r\n\r\n  James Smith, Edward Clark, and others contributed to the furnishing\r\n  of the necessities of the church. The parish was to receive £240 out\r\n  of the “cole-money” for the use of the parish or poor (Stow).\r\n\r\n  John Thomas (1691-1766), Bishop of Lincoln, 1744, of Sarum 1761-66,\r\n  was rector here; also Edward Vaughan (d. 1522), Bishop of St.\r\n  David’s; John Rogers, who was burnt at Smithfield, 1555; Lewis\r\n  Bayley (d. 1631), Bishop of Bangor, and Michael Lort (1725-90),\r\n  Vice-President of Society of Antiquaries; Henry Burton, the ardent\r\n  Puritan, who was put in the pillory and imprisoned for his religious\r\n  opinions and attacks.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Margaret Moses= was situated on the east side of\r\n  Friday Street, opposite Distaff Lane, now merged in Cannon Street,\r\n  and derived its name from one Moses, who founded it. It was burnt\r\n  down in the Great Fire and its parish annexed to that of St.\r\n  Mildred, Bread Street. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1300.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Robert Fitzwalter,\r\n  the founder, who gave it in 1105 to the Priors and Canons of St.\r\n  Faith, Horsham, Norfolk, being confirmed to that house by Pope\r\n  Alexander III. in his Bill dated at Turin, May 26, 1163; Edward\r\n  III., who seized it from St. Faith, as an alien priory, and so it\r\n  continued in the Crown till the parish was annexed to St. Mildred,\r\n  Bread Street, in 1666.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 240.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Nicholas Bray, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £8 : 16 : 8 in 1548, when John Griffyn was “priest of the\r\n  age of 46 years, of virtuous living and of small learning”; John\r\n  Fenne, whose endowment yielded £9 : 10s. in 1548, when John\r\n  Brightwyse was “priest of the age of 46 years, of honest behaviour\r\n  and indifferently learned”; Gerard Dannyell, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £8 in 1548, when Nicholas Prideoux was priest.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained monuments to Sir Richard Dobbes,\r\n  mayor, 1551; Sir John Allot, mayor, 1591.\r\n\r\n  Only two legacies are recorded by Stow: 18s. per annum, the gift of\r\n  John Bush; 16s. per annum, the gift of John Spot.\r\n\r\n  John Rogers, who was burnt at Smithfield in 1555, was rector here.\r\n\r\n=Distaff Lane.=—“On the west side of Friday Street, is Mayden lane, so\r\nnamed of such a sign, or Distaffe lane, for Distar lane, as I read in\r\nthe record of a brew-house called the Lamb, in Distar Lane, the 16th of\r\nHenry VI. In this Distar Lane, on the north side thereof, is the\r\nCordwainers, or Shoemakers’ hall, which company were made a brotherhood\r\nor fraternity, in the 11th of Henry IV. Of these cordwainers I read,\r\nthat since the fifth of Richard II. (when he took to wife Anne, daughter\r\nto Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia), by her example, the English people had\r\nused piked shoes, tied to their knees with silken laces, or chains of\r\nsilver or gilt, wherefore in the 4th of Edward IV. it was ordained and\r\nproclaimed, that beaks of shoone and boots, should not pass the length\r\nof two inches, upon pain of cursing by the clergy, and by parliament to\r\npay twenty shillings for every pair. And every cordwainer that shod any\r\nman or woman on the Sunday, to pay thirty shillings.\r\n\r\n“On the south side of this Distar Lane, is also one other lane, called\r\nDistar Lane, which runneth down to Knightrider Street, or Old Fish\r\nStreet, and this is the end of Bread Street Ward” (Stow’s _Survey_, p.\r\n393).\r\n\r\nThe other lane was afterwards called Little Distaff Lane. Another name\r\nfor this street was Maiden Lane. There was another Maiden Lane in Thames\r\nStreet, and a third in Lad Lane, and a fourth on Bank side.\r\n\r\nDistaff Lane is absorbed by Cannon Street, and the “Little Distaff Lane”\r\nhas been promoted by the omission of the adjective.\r\n\r\n=Old Change.=—Of this street Stow tells us everything that is of\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n“A street so called of the King’s exchange there kept, which was for the\r\nreceipt of bullion to be coined. For Henry III., in the 6th year of his\r\nreign, wrote to the Scabines and men of Ipre, that he and his council\r\nhad given prohibition, that none, Englishmen or other, should make\r\nchange of plate or other mass of silver, but only in his Exchange at\r\nLondon, or at Canterbury. Andrew Bukerell then had to farm the Exchange,\r\nand was mayor of London, in the reign of Henry III. In the 8th of Edward\r\nI., Gregory Rockesly was keeper of the said Exchange for the king. In\r\nthe 5th of Edward II., William Hausted was keeper thereof; and in the\r\n18th, Roger de Frowicke.\r\n\r\n“These received the old stamps, or coining-irons, from time to time, as\r\nthe same were worn, and delivered new to all the mints in England, as\r\nmore at large in another place I have noted.\r\n\r\n“This street beginneth by West Chepe in the north, and runneth down\r\nsouth to Knightrider Street; that part thereof which is called Old Fish\r\nStreet, but the very housing and office of the Exchange and coinage was\r\nabout the midst thereof, south from the east gate that entereth Pauls\r\nchurchyard, and on the west side in Baynard’s castle ward.\r\n\r\n“On the east side of this lane, betwixt West Cheape and the church of\r\nSt. Augustine, Henry Walles, mayor (by license of Edward I.), built one\r\nrow of houses, the profits rising of them to be employed on London\r\nBridge” (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 35).\r\n\r\nLord Herbert of Cherbury lived in a “house among gardens near the Old\r\nExchange.”\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s School was founded by Dean Colet in 1509, and the schoolhouse\r\nstood at the east end of the Churchyard, facing the Cathedral. It was\r\ndestroyed by the Great Fire and rebuilt by Wren, and then again taken\r\ndown and rebuilt in 1824, and subsequently removed to Hammersmith to the\r\nnew building designed by Alfred Waterhouse, R.A., in 1884. For further,\r\nsee “Hammersmith” in succeeding volume. The old site in St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard is now covered by business houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ST. AUGUSTINE\r\n\r\n  At the corner of Old Change and Watling Street stands St.\r\n  Augustine’s Church.\r\n\r\n  It was burnt down by the Great Fire and rebuilt by Wren in 1682, and\r\n  the parish of St. Faith’s annexed to it. The steeple, however, was\r\n  not completed till 1695. As it possessed no proper burying-ground of\r\n  its own, a portion of the crypt of St. Paul’s was used for the\r\n  interment of parishioners. The earliest date of an incumbent was\r\n  1148.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was always in the hands of the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s, who granted it to Edward, the priest, in\r\n  1148.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 360.\r\n\r\n  The present church measures about 51 feet in length, 30 feet in\r\n  height, and 45 feet in breadth; it is divided into a nave and side\r\n  aisles by six Ionic columns and four pilasters. The steeple rises at\r\n  the south-west, consisting of a tower, lantern, and spire. It is 20\r\n  feet square at the base, and has three stories. The lantern is very\r\n  slender. The total altitude is 140 feet. No chantries are recorded\r\n  to have been founded here. The ancient church contained few\r\n  monuments of note. The present building has a tablet to the memory\r\n  of Judith (died 1705), the first wife of the eminent lawyer William\r\n  Cowper.\r\n\r\n  Some of the benefactors were: Thomas Holbech, rector of the parish,\r\n  1662, who gave £100 towards finishing the church; Dame Margaret\r\n  Ayloff, £100. After the parish of St. Faith’s was annexed, gifts to\r\n  the amount of £700 were received from various sources.\r\n\r\n  William Fleetwood (1656-1723), Bishop of St. Asaph, was rector here;\r\n  also John Douglas (1721-1807), Bishop of Carlisle and of Sarum, and\r\n  Richard H. Barham (1788-1845), author of _The Ingoldsby Legends_.\r\n\r\nWith this we end the first section of the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second group of streets will be those lying north of Gresham Street,\r\nwith Noble Street and Monkwell Street on the west, and Moorgate Street\r\non the east. This part of the City is perhaps less rich in antiquities\r\nand associations than any other. The north part was, to begin with,\r\noccupied and built over with houses much later than the south. For a\r\nlong time the whole area north of Gresham (then Cateaton) Street and\r\nwithin the Wall presented the appearance of gardens and orchards with\r\nindustrial villages as colonies dotted here and there, each with its\r\nparish church and its narrow lane of communication with the great market\r\nof Chepe. Some of the names, as Oat Lane, Lilypot Lane, Love Lane,\r\npreserve the memory of the gardens and their walks.\r\n\r\nIn this district grew up by degrees a great many of the industries of\r\nthe City, especially the noisy trades and those which caused annoyance\r\nto the neighbours, as that of the foundry, the tanyard, the tallow\r\nchandlers.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the _Calendar of Wills_ down to the fifteenth century\r\nis in one sense disappointing, because it affords no insight into the\r\nnature of the trades carried on in the area before us. On the other\r\nhand, it curiously corroborates the theory that this part of the City\r\nwas in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries purely industrial,\r\nbecause among the many entries referring to this quarter there is but\r\none reference, down to the seventeenth century, of any shops. There are\r\nrents, tenements—“all my Rents and Tenements” several times repeated;\r\nland and rents—“all my Land and Rents”; there are almshouses, Halls of\r\nCompanies, gardens; but there are no shops, and that at a time when the\r\nstreets and lanes about Cheapside are filled with shops!\r\n\r\nThe Companies’ Halls offer some index to the trades of the quarter.\r\nThere are still Broderers’ Hall, Curriers’ Hall, Armourers’ Hall,\r\nCoopers’ Hall, Parish Clerk’s Hall, Brewers’ Hall, Girdlers’ Hall; and\r\nthere were Haberdashers’ Hall, Mercers’ Hall, Wax Chandlers’ Hall,\r\nMasons’ Hall, Plaisterers’ Hall, Pinners’ Hall, Barber Surgeons’ Hall,\r\nFounders’ Hall, Weavers’ Hall, and Scriveners’ Hall, which have now been\r\nremoved elsewhere or destroyed. These trades, we may note, are for the\r\nmost part of the humbler kind.\r\n\r\n=Coleman Street= is described by Stow as “a fair and large Street on\r\nboth sides built with divers fair houses, besides alleys with small\r\ntenements in great numbers.”\r\n\r\nCunningham enumerates the chief events connected with the street:\r\n\r\n“The five members accused of treason by Charles I. concealed themselves\r\nin this street. ‘The Star,’ in Coleman Street, was a tavern where Oliver\r\nCromwell and several of his party occasionally met.... In a conventicle\r\nin ‘Swan Alley,’ on the east side of this street, Venner, a wine-cooper\r\nand Millenarian, preached the opinions of his sect to ‘the soldiers of\r\nKing Jesus’” (see _London in the Time of the Stuarts_, p. 68 _et seq._).\r\n“John Goodwin, minister in Coleman Street, waited on Charles I. the day\r\nbefore the King’s execution, tendered his services, and offered to pray\r\nfor him. The King thanked him, but said he had chosen Dr. Juxon, whom he\r\nknew. Vicars wrote an attack on Goodwin, called ‘The Coleman-street\r\nConclave Visited!’ Justice Clement, in Ben Jonson’s _Every Man in his\r\nHumour_, lived in Coleman Street; and Cowley wrote a play called _Cutter\r\nof Coleman-street_. Bloomfield, author of ‘The Farmer’s Boy,’ followed\r\nhis original calling of a shoemaker at No. 14 Great Bell-yard in this\r\nstreet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. STEPHEN, COLEMAN STREET\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Stephen, Coleman Street, was “at first a Jews’\r\n  synagogue, then a parish church, then a chapel to St. Olave’s in the\r\n  Jewry, now (7 Edward IV.) incorporated as a parish church” (Stow).\r\n  It is situated on the west side of Coleman Street, near to the south\r\n  end. It was consumed by the Great Fire and rebuilt by Wren. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1311.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s, who granted it to the Prior and Convent of\r\n  Butley; Henry VIII. seized it, and in the Crown it continued till\r\n  Queen Elizabeth granted it, about 1597, to the parishioners, in\r\n  whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 880.\r\n\r\n  The church is plain, long and narrow, without any aisles, measuring\r\n  75 feet in length and 35 feet in breadth. The steeple, which rises\r\n  at the north-west, consists of a stone tower, a lantern, and small\r\n  spire, the total height being about 65 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: William Grapefig, for which the King\r\n  granted a licence, August 6, 1321, and to which John de Maderfield\r\n  was admitted chaplain, June 23, 1324; Rodger le Bourser, for which\r\n  the King granted his licence, August 1, 1321; Stephen Fraunford and\r\n  John Essex, both citizens of London, of which John de Bulklegh was\r\n  chaplain, who died in 1391: founded July 1361; Edward IV., who\r\n  endowed it with lands, etc., which fetched £50 : 5 : 4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Anthony Munday, the dramatist, arranger of the City pageants and the\r\n  continuation of Stow’s _Survey_, who died in 1633, was buried here.\r\n\r\n  A very large number of legacies and charitable gifts are recorded by\r\n  Stow, amongst which are: £640, the gift of Christopher Eyre, for the\r\n  building and maintenance of six almshouses; £100, the gift of Sir\r\n  Richard Smith, for coals for the poor; £100, the gift of Hugh Capp,\r\n  for lands for the poor; £400, the gift of Barnard Hyde, to purchase\r\n  land for six poor people for ever.\r\n\r\n  In White Alley there were six almshouses built by Christopher Eyre\r\n  for six poor couples, each of whom were allowed £4 per annum.\r\n\r\n  Richard Lucas (1648-1715), author of several theological works, was\r\n  a rector here; also John Davenport (1597-1670), he was one of the\r\n  leaders of a party who went over to America in 1637, and founded\r\n  Newhaven in Connecticut. He had a design of founding a university\r\n  (Yale), but this was not carried into effect until sixty years\r\n  later.\r\n\r\n  Over the stuccoed gateway of the churchyard is a skull and\r\n  cross-bones, with an elaborate panel in relief below, representing\r\n  the Last Judgment; this is a replica in oak of the original panel,\r\n  which was removed, for its better preservation, to the Vestry.\r\n\r\nAs for the present street the most notable building is the Armourers’\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ARMOURERS AND BRASIERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The trade of armourer was of great importance in the ages when men\r\n  went out to war clad in iron. There were many kinds of armour. Some\r\n  were taught to make helmets and some corslets. There was armour of\r\n  quilted leather worn under the armour or acting as armour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _T. H. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  THE ARMOURERS’ AND BRASIERS’ ALMSHOUSES, BISHOPSGATE WITHOUT (1857)\r\n]\r\n\r\n  A great number of people lived by the making of armour. The custom\r\n  of wearing armour decayed gradually, not rapidly. It is still kept\r\n  up for purposes of show but no longer for any use in defence.\r\n\r\n  The origin of the Company of Armourers and Brasiers is lost in\r\n  antiquity. The Company was, however, founded previously to the\r\n  beginning of the fourteenth century, for records are in existence\r\n  showing that at that time (1307-27) the Company had vested in it the\r\n  right of search of armour and weapons. It would appear from\r\n  documents in the possession of the Company that as early as the year\r\n  1428 the Company was in the possession of a hall. In the year 1453\r\n  the Company was incorporated by a charter from King Henry VI. by the\r\n  title of “The Fraternity or Guild of St. George of the Men of\r\n  Mistery of Armorers of our City of London,” and had licence granted\r\n  to it to appoint a chaplain to its chapel in St. Paul’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\n  It is believed that the Company of Brasiers was incorporated about\r\n  the year 1479 by Edward IV., and that the craft of bladesmiths was\r\n  incorporated with the Company of Armourers about the year 1515, but\r\n  the Company has no authentic evidence in its possession as to these\r\n  facts.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1559, Queen Elizabeth granted a charter of Inspeximus,\r\n  confirming the Letters Patent of King Henry VI.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1618, King James I., in consideration of the sum of\r\n  £100, granted Letters Patent confirming the title of the Fraternity\r\n  or Guild of St. George of the Men of Mystery of Armourers in the\r\n  City of London, to the messuages and lands then held by it. The\r\n  greater part of these messuages and lands is still in the possession\r\n  of the Company.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1685, King James II. granted Letters Patent to the\r\n  Company which (_inter alia_) directed that all edge tools and\r\n  armour, and all copper and brass work wrought with the hammer within\r\n  the City of London, or a radius of five miles therefrom, should be\r\n  searched and approved by expert artificers of the Company.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1708 the Company of Armourers was, by Letters Patent\r\n  granted by Queen Anne, incorporated with the Brasiers under the\r\n  corporate title of “The Company of Armourers and Brasiers in the\r\n  City of London.” In this charter it is recited that of late years\r\n  many of the members of the Company of Armourers had employed\r\n  themselves in working and making vessels, and wares of copper and\r\n  brass wrought with the hammer, and that for want of powers to search\r\n  and make byelaws to bind the workers of such wares in the City of\r\n  London, frauds and deceits in the working of such goods and vessels\r\n  had increased, and power was thereby granted to the Company of\r\n  Armourers and Brasiers to make byelaws for the government of the\r\n  Company; and also of all persons making any work or vessel of\r\n  wrought or hammered brass or copper, in the Cities of London and\r\n  Westminster, or within a radius of five miles thereof, and with\r\n  authority to inflict fines and penalties against persons offending\r\n  against such byelaws. And the Company was invested with power to\r\n  inspect and search for all goods worked or wrought with the hammer\r\n  and exposed to sale within such limits as aforesaid. No person was\r\n  allowed to sell or make armour or vessels, or wares of copper or\r\n  brass wrought with the hammer, unless he was a member or had been\r\n  apprenticed to a member of the Company.\r\n\r\n  It would appear that the master and wardens exercised a very\r\n  extensive jurisdiction in ancient days, fining and punishing members\r\n  of the Company for social offences as well as for infringements of\r\n  the byelaws of the Company, and hearing and adjudicating upon all\r\n  questions arising between members of the Company and their\r\n  apprentices, and also inflicting fines on persons making or selling\r\n  goods of an improper quality.\r\n\r\n  This Company is still in the habit of binding apprentices to masters\r\n  engaged in the trades of workers of brass and copper, and of\r\n  pensioning infirm members of those trades. Their workshops were\r\n  situated close to London Wall, below Bishopsgate, probably in order\r\n  to remove their hammering as far as possible from the trading part\r\n  of the City.\r\n\r\n  The Company is governed by a Master, an Upper Warden and a Renter\r\n  Warden, with eighteen assistants, and, together with the livery, now\r\n  number 91. The Hall is at 81 Coleman Street. Stow mentions the Hall\r\n  on the north end of Coleman Street and on the east side of it. “The\r\n  Company of Armourers were made a Fraternity or Guild of St. George\r\n  with a Chantry in the Chapel of St. Thomas in Paul’s Church in the\r\n  1st of Henry VI.”\r\n\r\nOn the north side of King’s Arms Yard extends the elaborate and very\r\nhandsome building of the Metropolitan Life Assurance Society, which has\r\nits entrance at the corner of Moorgate Street. This has deeply recessed\r\nwindows, and the corner is finished off by an octagonal turret which\r\nbegins in a projecting canopy over the door, and is carried up to the\r\nroof. In niches here and there are small stone figures. This building is\r\nthe work of Aston Webb and Ingress Bell in 1891. Opposite, in great\r\ncontrast, are oldish brick houses, very plain in style. Round the\r\nnorthern corner into Coleman Street is carried a building which is\r\nchiefly remarkable for the amount of polished granite on its surface. On\r\nthe west, a little higher up, is another entrance of the Wool Exchange\r\nfrom which a large projection overhangs the street. There is a lamb in\r\nstonework over the door.\r\n\r\n=Basinghall Street= (or Bassishaw Street) runs from London Wall to\r\nGresham Street. The street used to contain the Masons’, Weavers’,\r\nCoopers’, and Girdlers’ Halls. Only the Girdlers’ and Coopers’ Halls now\r\nremain. The names Basinghall and Bassishaw are frequently supposed to\r\nhave the same origin. Riley, however, quotes a passage in which (A.D.\r\n1390) there is mention of the “Parish of St. Michael Bassishaw in the\r\nWard of Bassyngeshaw,” which he considers indicates that the word\r\nBasseshaw is Basset’s haw, and Bassyngeshaw is Basing’s haw, referring\r\nto two families and not one. There is a great number of references to\r\nBasings and to Bassets. Yet the names seem to refer to the same place.\r\nThus in 1280 and 1283 we hear of houses in Bassieshaw. In 1286 we hear\r\nof houses in Bassinge haw. Basinghall was the hall or house of the\r\nBasings, an opulent family of the thirteenth century. Solomon and Hugh\r\nBasing were sheriffs in 1214; Solomon was mayor in 1216; Adam Basing was\r\nsheriff in 1243. Basinghall passed into the hands of a family named\r\nBanquelle or Bacquelle. John de Banquelle, Alderman of Dowgate, had a\r\nconfirmation and quit claim to him of a messuage in St. Michael,\r\nBassieshawe, in 1293.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of Basinghall Street was a fine stone house\r\nbuilt by a “certain Jew named Manscre, the son of Aaron.” Thomas\r\nBradberry (d. 1509) kept his mayoralty there.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GIRDLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Girdlers Company traces its existence to a very early period,\r\n  and cannot, in the strict sense of the word, be said to have been\r\n  founded. It is believed to have been a fraternity by prescription,\r\n  which owed its origin to a lay brotherhood of the order of Saint\r\n  Laurence, maintaining themselves by the making of girdles and\r\n  voluntarily associating for the purpose of mutual protection and for\r\n  the regulation of the trade which they practised, and the\r\n  maintenance of the ancient ordinances and usages established to\r\n  ensure the honest manufacture of girdles with good and sound\r\n  materials.\r\n\r\n  The earliest public or State recognition of the Company of which it\r\n  now possesses any evidence consists of Letters Patent of the first\r\n  year of King Edward III., A.D. 1327, addressed to them as an\r\n  existing body, as “les ceincturiers de notre Citée de Loundres,” by\r\n  which the “ancient ordinances and usuages” of the said trade are\r\n  approved and their observance directed. The King also grants licence\r\n  to the girdlers that they shall have power to elect one or two of\r\n  their own trade to seek out false work and present it before the\r\n  mayors or chief guardians of the places where found, who shall cause\r\n  the same to be burnt and those who have worked the same to be\r\n  punished; all amercements resulting therefrom to belong to the\r\n  mayors of the places where the false work is found.\r\n\r\n  Some ten years later we find the girdlers presenting a code of laws\r\n  for the governance of their trade to the mayor and aldermen;\r\n  therefore, though their charter enabled them to search into and\r\n  discover bad work, it gave them no power to make laws for the\r\n  safeguarding of the trade. Moreover, the charter gave them no power\r\n  over wages, nor did it compel the workers of the trade to join the\r\n  Fraternity, nor did it empower them to hold land, to sue or to be\r\n  sued. Considering these omissions, the document quoted by Riley\r\n  ought not, strictly speaking, to be considered a charter.\r\n\r\n  The said Letters Patent were confirmed in 1 Richard II. (1377) and 2\r\n  Henry IV. (1401), and the Company was incorporated in 27 Henry VI.\r\n  (1448) by the Master and Guardians of the Mystery of Girdlers of the\r\n  City of London.\r\n\r\n  Further confirmations were made in 2 Edward IV., 10 Elizabeth, 15\r\n  Charles I., and 1 James II.\r\n\r\n  No important change in the original constitution of the Company was\r\n  made by any of the charters prior to that of 10 Elizabeth, which\r\n  directed that the three arts or mysteries called Pinners,\r\n  Wyerworkers, and Girdlers should be joined and invited together into\r\n  one body corporate and polity, and one society and company for ever,\r\n  and did incorporate them by the name of the Masters and Wardens or\r\n  Keepers of the Art and Mystery of Girdlers, London.\r\n\r\n  It does not appear that the Pinners and Wyerworkers brought any\r\n  accession of property to the Girdlers.\r\n\r\n  The Hall has always been in Basinghall Street. Here it is mentioned\r\n  by Stow along with Masons’ Hall and Weavers’ Hall.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 on the east of Basinghall Street was probably built early in the\r\nnineteenth century; the buildings which follow it are chiefly modern.\r\nThe whole street is rather fine, though too narrow for much effect.\r\nThere are in it many great “houses,” “chambers,” and “buildings”\r\noccupied in floors. Gresham Buildings are faced with dark-coloured stone\r\nand rise comparatively high. The ground-floor walls on the exterior are\r\ncovered with the most elaborate stonework representations of flowers and\r\nfoliage. The City of London Court in the passage known as Guildhall\r\nBuildings is picturesquely built in a perpendicular style of Gothic. A\r\ngreat square stone building opposite was built in 1890, and next to it a\r\nplain Portland stone edifice contains the Lord Mayor’s court office. The\r\nCity Library and Museum form a picturesque group of buildings in the\r\nwest of Basinghall Street.\r\n\r\nNear at hand is the Coopers’ Hall with a narrow frontage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE COOPERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Coopers Company was incorporated in 1501 by charter of King\r\n  Henry VII., dated 29th April, in the sixteenth year of his reign.\r\n  There is no record, however, of any anterior charter. There is no\r\n  doubt that the Coopers were one of the early mysteries or\r\n  brotherhoods of the City of London, though it is difficult to assign\r\n  a correct date of their origin. The Company’s archives, however,\r\n  show that the Company had existed for a considerable period prior to\r\n  the date of its incorporation. A subsequent charter was granted on\r\n  the 30th August, in the thirteenth year of King Charles II. This is\r\n  the governing charter, and its provisions regulate the management of\r\n  the Company to the present day. Under the statute of 23 Henry VII.\r\n  cap. 4, power is given to the wardens of the Company with one of the\r\n  mayor’s officers to gauge all casks in the City of London and the\r\n  suburbs, and within two miles’ compass without the suburbs, and to\r\n  mark such barrels when gauged. By a subsequent Act, 31 Elizabeth,\r\n  cap. 8, “for the true gauging of vessels brought from beyond the\r\n  seas, converted by brewers for the utterance and sale of ale and\r\n  beer,” brewers were prohibited from selling or putting to sale any\r\n  ale or beer in any such vessels within the limits before mentioned\r\n  before the same should be lawfully gauged and marked by the master\r\n  and wardens of the Coopers Company. The Company do not now exercise,\r\n  and have not for a considerable period exercised, any control over\r\n  the trade of coopers.\r\n\r\n  It is quite certain that a craft so technical and so useful as that\r\n  of the cooper must have been constituted as a guild as soon as\r\n  craftsmen began to work together at all. In the year 1396 (Riley, p.\r\n  541), “the goodmen of the trade of Coopers” presented a code of\r\n  ordinances for the regulation of the trade. They complained that\r\n  certain persons of the trade were in the habit of making casks out\r\n  of wood which had been used for oil and soap casks, so that ale or\r\n  wine put into these casks was spoiled. Therefore it is certain that\r\n  their guild did not possess authority over the trade at that time.\r\n  This is shown again in 1413, when certain Master Coopers again\r\n  complained to the mayor that one Richard Bartlot, fishmonger, had\r\n  made 260 vessels called barrels and firkins of unseasoned wood and\r\n  of false measure. These vessels were ordered to be destroyed.\r\n  Perhaps in order to prevent similar practices, it was decreed that\r\n  every cooper should mark his work by his own trade-mark.\r\n\r\n  The Corporate Income of the Company is given in 1898 as £2400; the\r\n  Trust Income as £5000; the number of the livery as 200. Their Hall\r\n  is 71 Basinghall Street, on the site of two previous halls.\r\n\r\nClose by is the “Wool Exchange and Colonial Office” with an open entry\r\nsupported by polished granite pillars, whose capitals are carved as\r\nrams’ heads. This is rather a fine building, with segmental windows set\r\nclosely all across the frontage. Bevois House, just completed, takes a\r\ngood line of curvage and is of white stone. Before Guildhall Chambers\r\nthere is an old house built of narrow red bricks, with semicircular\r\npillars on each side of the centre window frame, and above, on a slab of\r\nstone, the date 1660. The site of =St. Michael’s Church= is here. A row\r\nof straight ordinary business houses succeeds. On the east are\r\n=Guildhall Chambers=, plastered houses built round an asphalt court. The\r\ncentre one has a small portico with Ionic columns; the rest of the court\r\nis plain and severe, but not ineffective.\r\n\r\n  =The Church of St. Michael, Bassishaw=, was situated on the west\r\n  side of Basinghall Street. It was rebuilt in the fifteenth century,\r\n  but destroyed by the Great Fire, and again rebuilt, by Wren, between\r\n  1676 and 1679. In 1895 the church was closed, a commission having\r\n  been issued in 1893 by the Bishop of London to inquire into the\r\n  expediency of uniting this with the parishes of St. Lawrence, Jewry,\r\n  and St. Mary Magdalene, Milk Street. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1286.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Canons of St. Bartholomew’s about 1140, given by the Bishop of\r\n  London; Henry III.; Thomas de Bassinges, 1246, who left it to his\r\n  wife by will dated 1275; Henry Bodyk, 1327, who left it to Johanna\r\n  his wife; Nicholas de Chaddesdon, who sold it in 1358 to Sir John de\r\n  Beauchamp, brother to the Earl of Warwick; Dean and Chapter of St.\r\n  Paul’s, 1435, in whose successors it continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 500.\r\n\r\n  The present church measures 70 feet in length, 50 feet in breadth,\r\n  and 42 feet in height, and includes a nave and two side aisles\r\n  separated by Corinthian columns. The ceiling is divided into panels,\r\n  and is pierced with openings to admit the light. The tower, which\r\n  rises at the west, contains four stories concluded by a cornice and\r\n  parapet; above this is a lead-covered octagonal lantern in two\r\n  stages surmounted by a short spire with ball, finial, and vane. The\r\n  total height is 140 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By John Hannem, citizen, before 1326;\r\n  by John Asche, whose endowment, “called the bell on the hope,”\r\n  fetched £3 : 6 : 8; by James Yardeford, Knt., whose endowment\r\n  yielded £16 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of monuments are recorded by Stow, the most\r\n  notable of which are those of Sir John Gresham (d. 1556), Lord Mayor\r\n  of London, uncle to the more famous Sir Thomas Gresham; and Dr.\r\n  Thomas Wharton (d. 1673), a physician who gained great glory from\r\n  his labours during the Plague of 1665.\r\n\r\n  The parish received a large number of gifts and charities, some of\r\n  which were as follows: £9 from Lady Anne Vaughan, for lectures; £10\r\n  from Sir Wolstan Dixey, for lectures; £20 from Lady Anne Bacon; £70\r\n  from Sir Robert and Lady Ducie.\r\n\r\n  George Gardiner (d. 1589), chaplain to Queen Elizabeth and\r\n  Chancellor of Norwich, was rector here; also George Lavington\r\n  (1684-1762), Bishop of Exeter 1746-47.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  ST. MARY, ALDERMANBURY, IN 1814\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Aldermanbury= is another ancient City street. The name, according to\r\nStow, is derived from the Court of Aldermen formerly held in the first\r\nGuildhall, the ruins of which, on the east side of the street, were\r\nstanding in his day. They had then been converted into a carpenter’s\r\nshop. Here, in 1383, Sir Robert Tressilian, Lord Chief Justice, had his\r\nresidence. At the north end of this street, before the memory of men\r\nliving in 1415, a postern had been built leading from the City to the\r\nmoor. In Riley’s _Memorials_ there is a full account of a crowded\r\nmeeting of citizens in the Guildhall, July 2, 1415, to consider the\r\nstate of the moor and certain nuisances outside the postern and within\r\nBishopsgate. It was resolved to lay out the moor, then a waste place, in\r\ngardens to be allotted to citizens at a certain rental. The street is\r\nfrequently mentioned from the thirteenth century. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury the street had become a place of residence for the better sort.\r\n“Here be divers fair houses on both sides meet for merchants and men of\r\nworship.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. MARY, ALDERMANBURY\r\n\r\n  This church is of very ancient date, as appeared from a sepulchral\r\n  inscription, said to have been in the old church, dated 1116. The\r\n  building was destroyed by the Great Fire, and re-erected by Wren in\r\n  1668-76. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1200.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s, who, June 1113, appropriated it to Elsing\r\n  Spital, with certain restrictions. The living is now in the gift of\r\n  the parishioners.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 371.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 72 feet in length, 45 feet in breadth, and 38\r\n  feet in height, and includes two aisles separated by six Corinthian\r\n  columns from the nave. Externally, the church is rather imposing.\r\n  The east front has a handsome cornice and pediment, with carved\r\n  scrolls and figures. The steeple, which rises at the west, consists\r\n  of a tower completed by a cornice and parapet. This is surmounted by\r\n  a square turret in two stages, and a concave roof tapering to a\r\n  point, with a finial and vane; the total height is about 90 feet.\r\n  There is a churchyard on the south side, open to the public for\r\n  several hours daily.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By William Estfelde, augmented by\r\n  Stephen Bockerell, at the Altar of St. George, for Stephen, Isabella\r\n  his wife, and William his son, before 1363; by Henry Bedeyk—the\r\n  advowson thereof was released to Sir John de Beauchamp by John de\r\n  Bovenden and Katherine his wife, in 1359; by Adam de Bassyng.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of citizens of repute were buried in the old\r\n  church, amongst whom the two most interesting to posterity are Henry\r\n  Condell (d. 1627) and John Heminge (d. 1630), the fellow-actors of\r\n  Shakespeare and editors of the folio of 1623. The celebrated divine\r\n  Edmund Calamy (the elder) was rector here for some years, and was\r\n  buried in 1666 beneath the ruined building with which he had been so\r\n  long connected. In the register of the church the marriage of Milton\r\n  with his second wife Katherine Woodcock, 1656, is entered. The\r\n  remains of Judge Jeffreys, interred in the Tower after his death\r\n  there in 1689, were removed here and deposited in a vault beneath\r\n  the communion table in 1693.\r\n\r\n  According to Stow, there were no legacies or bequests to the church,\r\n  but a legacy to the poor, by the Lady Gresham, of £3 per annum, paid\r\n  by the Mercers Company.\r\n\r\n  Among other celebrated rectors are Edmund Calamy the younger, and\r\n  Dr. Kennett (d. 1728), author of Kennett’s Register, afterwards\r\n  Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ST. ALPHAGE\r\n\r\n  At the north end of Aldermanbury at the corner of London Wall, is\r\n  the Church of St. Alphage. This parish church originally stood on\r\n  the other side, against the Wall. It is dedicated to St. Alphage,\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury, who was canonised in 1012. Its old\r\n  churchyard may still be seen. It is built on part of the site of the\r\n  hospital and priory founded by William Elsing in 1329 and 1332. The\r\n  priory harboured one hundred poor blind men, and suffered\r\n  suppression along with the rest at the Dissolution. Under Henry\r\n  VIII. a remnant of the priory church became parochial and was\r\n  extensively repaired and rebuilt in 1624, 1628, and 1649. It escaped\r\n  the Great Fire, but was taken down in 1774 and the present building\r\n  erected by Sir William Staines and opened in 1777. Part of the\r\n  original structure may still be seen in the porch. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1137.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Deans and\r\n  Canons of St. Martin’s-le-Grand before 1324, from whom it passed to\r\n  the Abbot and Convent of Westminster from 1505; the Bishop of\r\n  Westminster by grant of Henry VIII., January 20, 1540; the Bishop of\r\n  London by gift of Edward VI. in 1550, confirmed by Mary, March 3,\r\n  1553-54, in whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 345.\r\n\r\n  The present church possesses two fronts, an eastern and\r\n  north-western; the north-west door leads into a porch, the pointed\r\n  arches of which show it to have once formed part of the old priory\r\n  church. This is the only relic of past times. The interior is plain,\r\n  the ceiling flat, and there are no aisles.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by John Graunte, whose endowment yielded\r\n  £15 : 10 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The church contains a handsome monument on the north wall to Sir\r\n  Rowland Hayward, Lord Mayor in 1570 and 1591; it was placed on the\r\n  south side of the old church. On the same wall, farther east, a\r\n  marble monument commemorates Samuel Wright, who at his death in 1736\r\n  left charitable bequests to the extent of £20,950.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PORCH OF ST. ALPHAGE, LONDON WALL, 1818.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of gifts were Sir Rowland Hayward, 20d. for bread\r\n  every Sabbath day for the poor, 1591, and John Brown, £30 for church\r\n  repairs, 1629.\r\n\r\n  There was a school for fifty boys and twenty-five girls, who were\r\n  clothed and educated and put out to trades and service at the charge\r\n  of the ward. There were also ten almshouses for ten men and ten\r\n  women, each of whom was allowed £4 per annum, founded by the Rev.\r\n  Dr. Thomas White. Part of the almshouses in Monkwell Street belonged\r\n  to this parish.\r\n\r\n  A notable rector of this church was Philip Stubbs (1665-1738),\r\n  Archdeacon of St. Alban’s.\r\n\r\nJust opposite to Philip Street is still preserved the old churchyard of\r\nSt. Alphage, a rectangular railed-in space with ivy growing over the old\r\nwall that forms the backbone. On a slab near the centre is the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n  The burial ground of St. Alphage containing part of the old Roman\r\n  City wall. Closed by Act of Parliament 1853. Laid out as a garden\r\n  1872.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the churchyard once stood Sion College. This was built in\r\n1623 with almshouses attached, according to the will of Dr. Thomas\r\nWhite, vicar of St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West. It stood on the site of\r\nElsing Spital (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 248).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SION COLLEGE, LONDON WALL, 1800\r\n\r\n  From an original drawing in the possession of the President and\r\n    Fellows of Sion College.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSion College had a fine library left by the will of Dr. John Simson,\r\nrector of St. Olave, Hart Street, and a third of these books was burnt\r\nin the Great Fire, which almost destroyed the College. Up to 1836 the\r\nCollege enjoyed the privilege of receiving a gratuitous copy of every\r\npublished book. The City clergy were Fellows of the College. In 1886 a\r\nnew building on the Embankment was opened to take the place of the old\r\none, and now the ancient site is covered by business houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CURRIERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Curriers were incorporated by James I. in April 30, 1606, for a\r\n  master, two wardens, twelve assistants, and 103 liverymen.\r\n\r\n  The exact date of the origin of the Company is unknown, but it must\r\n  have had some sort of existence previous to 1363, for in that year\r\n  it is recorded that the Company contributed five marks to aid King\r\n  Edward III. in carrying on his wars with France.\r\n\r\n  There are no documents in existence referring to the origin of the\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  Many indications of the antiquity of this Fraternity occur. It was\r\n  attached to the White Friars’ Church in Fleet Street. The Curriers\r\n  settled in Soper Lane; they asked for ordinances in 1415; they were\r\n  authorised to appoint the City scavengers.\r\n\r\n  Their Hall is the third erected on the same site; it was founded in\r\n  1874. The first Hall perished in the Fire. The quarter where the\r\n  curriers lived and worked was in the north facing London Wall, where\r\n  they built their Hall.\r\n\r\nOf =Addle Street= Stow says: “The reason of which name I know not.” It\r\nmay have been derived from “Ethel,” meaning noble. In it is the Brewers’\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BREWERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  In the year 1445 the Brewers were first incorporated. Like many\r\n  other trades, they had been associated long before. Thus in 1345 the\r\n  Brewers (Riley’s _Memorials_, p. 225) are treated as a body, being\r\n  ordered not to use the water of the Chepe conduit for making beer\r\n  and ale, seeing that it was wanted for the supply of the citizens.\r\n  (Fishmongers at the same time were forbidden to use the water for\r\n  washing their fish.)\r\n\r\n  The original charter of February 22, 1445, granted by Henry VI.,\r\n  after citing the Brewers Company as one of the ancient mysteries,\r\n  incorporates the Company into one body and perpetual community.\r\n\r\n  The charter granted 11th November, 2 Elizabeth, and the charter of\r\n  August 29, 1563, confirm the previous charter of Henry VI.\r\n\r\n  The charter of July 13, 21 Elizabeth, appears to have been granted\r\n  owing to the great increase of persons engaged in and practising the\r\n  trade of brewing. The charter incorporates all persons in or about\r\n  the City of London or the suburbs, or within two miles of the City.\r\n\r\n  The charter of 6th April, 15 Charles I., recites previous charters,\r\n  but increases the jurisdiction of the corporation over the brewing\r\n  trade in or about the City of London to a limit of four miles.\r\n\r\n  This charter of Charles I. confers a great deal of power on those in\r\n  authority over the trade. It allows them to make rules and\r\n  ordinances, and generally to exercise supervision over all members\r\n  of the trade in and about the City, and within a four-mile radius.\r\n\r\n  Byelaws on the strength of this charter were framed for the Company\r\n  on July 9, Charles I., 1641.\r\n\r\n  The charter of 18th March, 1 Charles II., after reciting the charter\r\n  of 22nd February, 16 Henry VI., the confirmation of the said charter\r\n  by Queen Elizabeth on August 29, 1563, and a surrender of the right\r\n  to elect master, warden, or assistant, incorporates the Company\r\n  again, nominates William Carpenter to be master till June 24, 1686,\r\n  further nominates wardens and assistants; provides for the\r\n  institution of search and quarterage, and for the binding of\r\n  apprentices; gives the corporation the right to inspect brew-houses\r\n  within certain limits, and to inflict penalties; orders that every\r\n  assistant elected shall be a communicant, and allows the commonalty\r\n  to distil aqua-vitæ or spirits.\r\n\r\n  The deed of July 1, 1684, surrenders the Company’s charter and all\r\n  rights appertaining to it.\r\n\r\n  The charter of 18th March, James II., after reciting the charter of\r\n  16 Henry VI., and 4 Elizabeth, 1563, and the surrender of their\r\n  charter by the Company, orders all brewers within eight miles of the\r\n  City or suburbs of London to be of the corporation; establishes\r\n  search and quarterage payments according to the number of servants\r\n  employed; gives the Company power to make laws or set penalties;\r\n  grants a licence in mortmain to purchase lands up to the value of\r\n  £60; orders every master, warden, assistant, and clerk to take the\r\n  oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and to subscribe the declaration;\r\n  orders each person elected to be a communicant.\r\n\r\n  The Company have a copy of byelaws drawn up in the year 1714, and\r\n  signed by all the members of the court.\r\n\r\n  The present constitution, orders, rules, and conditions, as drawn up\r\n  by the master, wardens, and assistants, were made on July 13, 1739.\r\n  They provide for the holding of the courts; the election of masters,\r\n  wardens, and assistants; for certain penalties for refusing to\r\n  serve; for the auditing of accounts, for the election to the livery\r\n  and freedom; for binding apprentices; for making the search and\r\n  quarterage; for certain restrictions in the case of freemen; for\r\n  power for the master and wardens to sue for penalties; for the\r\n  taking of the oaths, and the signing of the declarations.\r\n\r\n  In February 13, 1857, the byelaws were altered under the Act of 6\r\n  William IV., as far as regards the taking of oaths, and an order was\r\n  made that a declaration should be substituted for the oath.\r\n\r\n  The Company is governed by a master, three wardens, and twenty-six\r\n  assistants.\r\n\r\n  This Company is one of the richest of the City Companies; it has an\r\n  annual income of £2500 and administers Trusts and charities to the\r\n  extent of £25,000 more; it has a livery of 47; it admits none but\r\n  members of the trade. The Company has always, as might be expected,\r\n  been rich and flourishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BRODERERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The first charter of the Company of Broderers, or embroiderers, is\r\n  dated in 1561, and this is the earliest definite evidence now in the\r\n  possession of the Company of the date of its existence as a Company,\r\n  though the association existed long before incorporation. In an\r\n  indenture of conveyance of certain of the Company’s property in\r\n  Gutter Lane, dated 5 Henry VIII., one Thomas Foster (the grantee) is\r\n  described as a citizen and broyderer, and “The wardens of the\r\n  mystery of broyderers within the city of London” are described as a\r\n  definite body in the will of the same Thomas Foster.\r\n\r\n  25th October, 3 Elizabeth, 1561.—Original charter of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  Incorporates the freemen of the mystery or art of the broderers of\r\n  the City of London and the suburbs by the name of Keepers or Wardens\r\n  and Society of the Art or Mystery of the Broderers of the City of\r\n  London, to have perpetual succession and a common seal, to bring and\r\n  defend actions, and especially in the City of London to hold lands\r\n  of the annual value of £30, for the assistance and support of poor\r\n  men and women of the mystery.\r\n\r\n  Grants powers to the keepers or wardens from time to time to make\r\n  good and salutary statutes and ordinances for the good regulation\r\n  and government of the mystery and the freemen thereof, which shall\r\n  be inviolably observed.\r\n\r\n  Grants to the keepers or wardens power to overlook and govern the\r\n  art and all using the same in the City and suburbs thereof, the City\r\n  of Westminster, Saint Katherine’s in Middlesex, and the borough of\r\n  Southwark, and to punish all men for not truly working or selling.\r\n\r\n  20th April, 7 James I., 1609.—Original charter of James the First.\r\n\r\n  Contains only a recital and confirmation of the charter of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth without any alteration or addition.\r\n\r\n  The above is an abstract of the subsisting charter of the Company.\r\n\r\n  It was the Broderers who produced the palls used by many Companies\r\n  at the funerals of their members. They also made the pulpit cloths\r\n  and altar cloths of the churches, the vestments of the clergy, the\r\n  caparison of horses, and the decoration of arms and armour.\r\n\r\n  The livery in 1900 was 28. Their Trust Income about £32 : 9s. The\r\n  beautiful art of embroidery is encouraged by this Company by\r\n  scholarships at the Royal School of Art Needlework, Decorative\r\n  Needlework Society, and Clapton and Stamford Hill Government School\r\n  of Art.\r\n\r\n=Milton Street=, one of the dreariest and dullest of thoroughfares,\r\ndeserves some comment, having originally been that Grub Street for ever\r\nassociated with starveling authors. In 1600 it was inhabited by bowyers,\r\nfletchers, bowstring-makers and such occupations. There were many\r\nbowling alleys and dicing houses. Andrew Marvell speaks of the Puritans\r\nof Grub Street.\r\n\r\nIt was in the eighteenth century that the poorer sort of literary men\r\nseem to have lived here.\r\n\r\nSwift and Pope both ridiculed Grub Street writers; and Swift’s advice to\r\nGrub Street verse-writers is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n                 I know a trick to make you thrive:\r\n                   Oh! ’tis a quaint device:\r\n                 Your still-born poems shall survive,\r\n                   And scorn to wrap up spice.\r\n\r\n                 Get all your verses printed fair,\r\n                   Then let them well be dried:\r\n                 And Curll must have a special care\r\n                   To leave the margin wide.\r\n\r\n                 Lend these to paper-sparing Pope,\r\n                   And when he sits to write,\r\n                 No letter with an envelope\r\n                   Could give him more delight.\r\n\r\n                 When Pope has filled the margin round,\r\n                   Why then recall your loan;\r\n                 Sell them to Curll for 50 pound,\r\n                   And swear they are your own!\r\n\r\nLet us commemorate some of the Grub Street poets and a few others of the\r\nsame obscure kind. The names of those selected justify my assertion that\r\nthe miseries of poets fell only on those who were profligate, indolent,\r\nor incapable.\r\n\r\nSamuel Boyse, a colonist, so to speak, of Grub Street, since he\r\nevidently belonged to that and no other quarter, was not a native of\r\nLondon, but of Dublin, where his father was a dissenting minister of\r\ngreat name and fame. The young man was sent to Glasgow University, where\r\nhe brought his university career to a close by marrying a wife at the\r\nage of nineteen. As he had no means of his own, he was obliged to take\r\nhis wife, with her sister, to Dublin, where his father supported them,\r\nselling an estate he had in Yorkshire to defray his son’s debts. On his\r\nfather’s death Samuel Boyse removed to Edinburgh, where he published a\r\nvolume of poems and wrote an elegy on the death of Lady Stormont.\r\n\r\nHe had many introductions, but his natural indolence forbade his taking\r\nadvantage of them. He seems to have been unable to converse with persons\r\nin higher life, and when letters failed he made no further effort to win\r\ntheir favour. Like all the poets of Grub Street, he was of a grovelling\r\nhabit, and loved to make friends with men of low life and habit; at the\r\nsame time he was selfishly extravagant, and would feast upon a casual\r\nguinea while his wife and child were starving at home. The casual guinea\r\nhe mostly got by writing begging letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRUB STREET HERMIT\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt one time he was so far reduced that he had no garment of any kind to\r\nput on; all, including his shirts, were at the pawnbrokers; he sat up in\r\nbed with a blanket wrapped round him through which he had cut a hole for\r\nhis arm, in which condition he wrote his verses. He died in 1749 in a\r\nlodging in Shoe Lane. A friend endeavoured to get up a subscription to\r\nsave him from a pauper’s funeral. It was in vain; the parish officers\r\nhad to take away the body.\r\n\r\nThe man was a hopeless tenant of Grub Street, without foresight, without\r\nprudence, without care, except for the present, without dignity or\r\nself-respect; his poetry was third-rate, yet there are fine passages in\r\nit; he had scholarly tastes, especially for painting and music, and in\r\nheraldry he was well skilled. In a word, Samuel Boyse is quite the most\r\nillustrious example of the poetaster who has failed to reach even the\r\nlower levels of genius; whose life was utterly contemptible; who would\r\nhave brought, had such a man been worth considering, discredit by his\r\nsordidness and his want of principle, morals, and honour, upon the\r\nprofession of letters.\r\n\r\nAnother case is that of Thomas Britton. He was born about the year 1650\r\nat Higham Ferrers. He was apprenticed to a small coalman in Clerkenwell\r\nand followed the same trade. He walked the streets carrying his sack on\r\nhis back, dressed in the blue frock of his profession. When he had\r\ndisposed of his coal he walked home, looking at the book-stalls and\r\npicking up bargains. It was a splendid time for picking up bargains.\r\nThere were still the remnants of the old Monastic libraries and MSS.\r\ntogether with the old books which had escaped the Great Fire.\r\n\r\nMany collectors used to search about among the same book-stalls. Britton\r\nbecame known to them and was employed by them. The Earls of Oxford,\r\nPembroke, Sunderland, and Winchelsea, and the Duke of Devonshire, were\r\namong those collectors.\r\n\r\nPresently it was discovered that the small coalman, besides being an\r\nexcellent hand at discovering an old book, was also a very good\r\nmusician. Then the wonderful spectacle was to be seen of the great ones\r\nof the earth—the aristocracy, the wits, the musicians—assembling in an\r\nupper room of an itinerant pedlar of small coals to hear a concert of\r\nmusic. Handel played the harpsichord here; Dubourg played the violin.\r\nThese concerts were begun in 1678 and continued for many years. Britton\r\nhimself played the viol de gamba. But he was not only a musician and a\r\nbibliophile, he was also an antiquarian; he was a collector of music; in\r\naddition to all these things, he was also a chemist and had a laboratory\r\nof his own. He died in 1714, aged about sixty-four. He was buried in\r\nClerkenwell Churchyard.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget the famous Tom Brown. Though most of his life was\r\nspent in London, he was a native of Shifnal in Shropshire. He was sent\r\nto Christ Church, Oxford, where he distinguished himself as a linguist,\r\na scholar, and a writer of pieces which were certainly witty whatever\r\nelse they might be. He was so brilliant as a wit that he found it\r\nnecessary to exchange Oxford for London, where he nearly starved.\r\nHowever, he obtained, just in time to save him, the school of\r\nKingston-on-Thames, which he held for a while, giving it up after a very\r\nshort tenure of office. Once more he came to London, and became poet,\r\nsatirist, descriptive writer, and libeller. He was one of the earliest\r\nauthors by profession, having, in fact, no other means of livelihood\r\nthan the proceeds of his writings. There is very little known concerning\r\nhis life; he is said to have been deficient in the courtliness which was\r\nnecessary in the society of Addison and the wits of society; indeed, he\r\nbelonged to a somewhat earlier time. He had no patron among the\r\nnobility, though it is related that he was once invited to dinner by the\r\nEarl of Dorset, who placed a bank-note for £50 under his plate. This was\r\nthe solitary exception, however. Nothing is known as to his private\r\ncircumstances, though it would be extremely interesting to learn what\r\nsums he received for his Dialogues, Letters, and Poems. He closed a\r\nshort, merry, godless, waggish life at the early age of forty-one, a\r\nfact which suggests drink and good living, with other easy ways of\r\nshortening life. He is said—which one readily believes—to have died in\r\ngreat poverty, and he was buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate poet named William Pattison belongs to Grub Street. He\r\nwas the son of a farmer in Sussex. By the kindness of Lord Thanet he was\r\nsent to school and to Cambridge. He quarrelled, however, with the tutor\r\nof this College, and took his name off the boards. He then went up to\r\nLondon intending to live by his pen. It was a very bad time for living\r\nby the pen, and the boy, for he was no more, arrived with a very slender\r\nequipment of experience and knowledge. He began by soliciting\r\nsubscriptions for a volume of poems; he seems to have had no friends;\r\nbut he made some impression at the coffee-house by clever talk. When he\r\nhad brought out his poems and spent all the subscription money, he fell\r\ninto absolute indigence and was forced to accept a post as assistant in\r\nthe shop of the notorious Curll. Before he did that, he wrote to Lord\r\nBurlington a poem called _Effigies Authoris_, in which he said that he\r\nwas destitute of friends and money, half-starved, and reduced to\r\nsleeping on a bench in St. James’s Park. To another person he writes, “I\r\nhave not enjoyed the common necessaries of life these two days.” He did\r\nnot long continue in this post of bookseller’s assistant, because\r\nsmall-pox attacked him and he died. He was not yet twenty-two years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n          Not with less glory mighty Dulness crowned\r\n          Shall take through Grub Street her triumphant round,\r\n\r\nsays Pope in “The Dunciad.”\r\n\r\nAmong others who lived in Grub Street was Foxe the martyrologist.\r\nGeneral Monk is said to have had a house in a court off Grub Street. As\r\nto the origin of the later name of the street, it is in doubt, some\r\nasserting it was from a builder named Milton, and others that it was so\r\ncalled from Milton’s many residences in the neighbourhood. The latter\r\nexplanation sounds probable; Milton lived at different times in\r\nAldersgate Street, in Jewin Crescent, in Little Britain, and in Bunhill\r\nFields, all within the district.\r\n\r\nEastward is Moorgate Street Station, and not far from it St.\r\nBartholomew’s Church, founded in 1850 to meet new demands. Northward in\r\nWhite Street is the =City of London College=. This is a very large\r\nbuilding occupying all the space between White’s Court and Finsbury\r\nStreet. The lower part is red brick and above is glazed white brick. The\r\ncharacter of the building changes just before the corner, having stone\r\nfacings and a turret angle, which springs from above the first floor.\r\nThis institution was founded in 1848 and was first established at Crosby\r\nHall. It removed to Sussex Hall, Leadenhall Street, in 1881, and the\r\npresent building was opened in 1884. In 1895 the secondary portion in\r\nWhite Street, connected with the main building by means of a bridge, was\r\nadded. The institution was first established as Metropolitan Evening\r\nClasses. In 1891 it became, under a scheme of the Charity Commissioners,\r\none of the constituent Institutes of the City Polytechnic. It is in\r\nunion with the Society of Arts, the Science and Art Department, and the\r\nCity and Guilds of London Technical Institute. The number of individual\r\nstudents in attendance during the session 1894-95 was 2257 (College\r\nCalendar, 1895-96). Besides languages, sciences, and arts, the\r\ncurriculum includes a practical knowledge of technical subjects. There\r\nis accommodation for 4000 students.\r\n\r\nIn Redcross Street the long line of wall bounding the yard of the\r\nMidland Railway goods station occupies much of the east side. Beyond\r\nthis is a grey brick house partly stone faced, and very ugly, with “Lady\r\nHolles’ School for Girls, founded 1702,” running across the front. The\r\nwest side of the street is all composed of manufactories and warehouses\r\nin various styles.\r\n\r\nThere is a tree-covered space in the middle of =Bridgewater Square=.\r\nAlong the south side is Tranter’s Temperance Hotel, a dingy building, in\r\nthe same style as the houses in the street just mentioned. On the west\r\nnear the south end are one or two old tiled houses. On the north the new\r\nbuilding of the Cripplegate Without Boys’ School rises high, with narrow\r\nfrontage and projecting bow window in the centre resting on a bracket.\r\nUp near the roof is the figure of a boy in a long coat standing in a\r\nniche. At this school there is accommodation for 260 boys; of these 150\r\nare clothed by Trust, and an outfit on leaving and a situation found for\r\nall who pass the VIIth Standard.\r\n\r\nThe houses on either side of the school are of recent date, but from\r\nthat on the west, to the west corner, stretches a long row of old houses\r\nwith windows under the tiles on the roof. The west side of the square is\r\nalmost wholly eighteenth century, in the usual style. The staircases are\r\npanelled, and have spiral balusters. The rooms are all completely\r\nwainscotted, and have heavily recessed fireplaces. The entrance ways are\r\ncompletely panelled, and many door lintels and window frames are\r\nperilously askew.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. GILES, CRIPPLEGATE\r\n\r\n  By far the most interesting object in the ward without the Walls is\r\n  the Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, which stands at the south end\r\n  of Red Cross Street. It was built about 1090 by Alfure, who became\r\n  the first Hospitaller of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; the building\r\n  was replaced by a second church, towards the end of the fourteenth\r\n  century, and this was burnt down in 1545. It was at once rebuilt,\r\n  and escaped the Great Fire of 1666, and has remained substantially\r\n  the same up to the present time. It is of exceptional interest in\r\n  contrast with the uniformity of Wren’s City churches. In 1791 the\r\n  pitch of the roof was raised, and during the latter half of the\r\n  eighteenth century there was extensive restoration. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1181.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church has been in the hands of the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s, who received it from Almund the priest in\r\n  1100, or thereabouts, up to the present time.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 2440.\r\n\r\n  This church is in the Perpendicular style and contains a nave,\r\n  chancel, and two side aisles separated from the central part by\r\n  clustered columns and pointed arches. The total length is 146 feet 3\r\n  inches, and the height 42 feet 8 inches; the total height of the\r\n  steeple 146 feet 3 inches, that of the four pinnacles rising from\r\n  the corners of the parapet of the tower 12 feet 9 inches.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded in the church: By Richard Chaurye, whose\r\n  endowment fetched £4 in 1548; by Matthew Ashebye, whose endowment\r\n  yielded £9 : 7 : 8 in 1548. The King granted his licence to found\r\n  the Fraternity of Our Lady and St. Giles, September 21, 1426; there\r\n  were several chantries endowed here by John Bullinger, William Lake,\r\n  and William Serle, and by William Grove and Richard Heyworth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From a drawing by W. Pearson._\r\n\r\n  ST. GILES, CRIPPLEGATE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Among the several memorial windows of the church the most\r\n  interesting is that at the west of the south aisle, comprising three\r\n  subjects, erected in memory of Edward Alleyne, the founder of\r\n  Dulwich College. The earliest monument now existing is of Thomas\r\n  Busby, who died in 1575. On the west wall, at the end of the north\r\n  aisle, is a tablet commemorating the martyrologist John Foxe, who\r\n  died in the parish in 1587. Sir Martin Frobisher was buried here,\r\n  but it was not till 1888 that a monument was erected to his memory,\r\n  on the eastern part of the south wall. On the same wall, farther\r\n  west, John Speed is commemorated, author of various works dealing\r\n  with the history of Great Britain. The chief interest attaching to\r\n  this church is the fact that in it John Milton was buried in 1674;\r\n  there is a stone commemorating him. In 1793 a monument in the shape\r\n  of a bust was erected to him at the expense of Samuel Whitbread, and\r\n  in 1862 a cenotaph designed by Edmund Woodthorpe was placed in the\r\n  south aisle. The church contains numerous other monuments, a great\r\n  many of which have a considerable degree of interest; many of them\r\n  have been erected to the memory of benefactors and vicars. It was\r\n  here that the wedding of Oliver Cromwell was solemnised in 1620; the\r\n  register also contains entries to another family whose name is also\r\n  linked with Milton’s—that of the Egerton’s, Earls of Bridgewater.\r\n\r\n  The greatest of the benefactors recorded by Stow seems to have been\r\n  Throckmorton Trotman, who gave to the parish £547 in all. In later\r\n  times, Sir William Staines, Lord Mayor in 1800, was a liberal donor,\r\n  founding and endowing four almshouses for decayed parishioners; also\r\n  the Rev. Frederick W. Blomberg, D.D., vicar of this church in 1833.\r\n\r\n  There was a school for 150 boys in the Freedom; also another for 50\r\n  girls, supported by the donation of the Lady Eleanor Holles, the\r\n  Haberdashers’ Free School. There were six almshouses, founded by Mr.\r\n  Allen, also the Lorrimer’s almshouses.\r\n\r\n  John Buckeridge (d. 1631), Bishop of Rochester, was vicar here; also\r\n  William Fuller (d. 1659), Dean of Durham; Lancelot Andrewes\r\n  (1555-1626), Bishop of Chichester, Ely, and Winchester; John Rogers,\r\n  (1679-1729), chaplain to the Prince of Wales (afterwards George\r\n  II.); John Dolben (1625-86), Archbishop of York; William H. Hale\r\n  (1795-1870), Master of Charterhouse.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard contains a drinking fountain in the shape of the old\r\nCripplegate, which is neatly laid out and intersected by a public\r\nfootpath; there is also an interesting relic, a bastion of the old\r\nLondon Wall, 36 feet wide and about 12 feet high, the most perfect\r\nfragment of the wall now existing. It is of inconsiderable height, not\r\nmore than 12 feet, and made of many odd pieces of different kinds of\r\nstone, laid in cement. It looks solid enough to last another 400 years.\r\nIvy grows over it and over the adjoining wall, which is a modern\r\naddition. Within this bastion was formerly a small religious house\r\ncalled St. James-on-the-Wall (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 368).\r\nThe backs of great warehouses and the east side of the box-like vicarage\r\nsurround the churchyard. Over the entry from =Fore Street= are several\r\nvery old houses. We are outside the limits of the Fire here, as the date\r\nof the entry, 1660, testifies. This entry has a semicircular canopy or\r\npediment containing this date, and the names of the churchwardens of the\r\nperiod, deeply and clearly cut. On either side are the representations\r\nof two large hour-glasses. A skull and cross-bones on the one side, and\r\nan hour-glass on the other, are carved in relief below, and the whole is\r\ncovered with plaster. The backs of the houses are covered with\r\noverlapping pieces of wood which rise right up to the gable ends. Facing\r\nthe street, there are projecting bays running up the front containing\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe street, =London Wall=, until the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nconsisted of a south row of houses facing the wall itself. In two places\r\nthe space before the wall was occupied by churchyards, that of\r\nAllhallows-on-the-Wall and that of St. Alphage. Farther to the east, St.\r\nMartin Outwich also had a burial-ground beside the wall. The pulling\r\ndown of the wall, the building of houses upon it and against it on\r\neither side, was the work of many years. To this day there are houses on\r\nthe north side of the street to which access is gained by a step,\r\nshowing that they were built actually on the wall. Towards the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century a long piece of wall, where is now the opening to\r\nFinsbury Square, was taken down to allow of more sunshine in the front\r\nof Bethlehem Hospital. The appearance of the street at that time was\r\nvery pleasing. Sion College, the churches of Allhallows and St. Alphage,\r\nand the Armourers’ Hall, with the venerable wall on the north, gave it a\r\nvery striking and picturesque character. It is a great pity that the\r\nwall was taken down. The distance marked by the length of a lane\r\nconnecting London Wall with the south side of Fore Street gives the\r\nbreadth of the wall and of the town ditch beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LONDON WALL\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the east end of London Wall is the church of\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ALLHALLOWS, LONDON WALL\r\n\r\n  This church stands on the old Roman wall erected in the third\r\n  century, and probably marks the site of one of the earliest\r\n  Christian churches built in this country.\r\n\r\n  The earliest authentic records give particulars of a church on the\r\n  present site, which dates from the year A.D. 1300, and there is\r\n  little doubt that it replaced an earlier structure, which had stood\r\n  since the Norman Conquest, and had fallen into disrepair. In A.D.\r\n  1474 Allhallows Chapel was constructed, probably for the\r\n  accommodation of the Ankers, or Anchorites, who were closely\r\n  associated with the church. The most famous of these was Sir Simon,\r\n  or Master Anker, the author of a devotional book which has been\r\n  preserved in the British Museum, entitled _The Fruits of\r\n  Redemption_, who was a great benefactor to Allhallows.\r\n\r\n  In A.D. 1527 a new aisle was added to the church. Possibly Sir\r\n  Simon, when he attached himself to Allhallows, discarded the loft\r\n  over the chapel, and settled himself in a cell in the bastion of the\r\n  old Roman wall, which now forms the vestry. If, as is probable, he\r\n  had taken a vow never to emerge from his retirement, it may be that\r\n  when the new aisle was added he was persuaded to place his eloquence\r\n  at the disposal of the parishioners, by consenting to preach on\r\n  condition that a private passage was made from his cell leading\r\n  straight into the pulpit. This would explain why, when the present\r\n  church was built, the conditions were reproduced by which the pulpit\r\n  is not accessible from the church, but can only be reached by a\r\n  staircase leading through the vestry.\r\n\r\n  The list of rectors can only be traced back to A.D. 1335, but there\r\n  is an interesting record in the _Croniques de Londres_, which\r\n  mentions that in A.D. 1320 the priest of Allhallows (whose name is\r\n  not given) was murdered by Isabel de Bury, who took refuge in the\r\n  church, but the Bishop of London would not allow her to seek\r\n  sanctuary there, so she was seized, and was hanged five days\r\n  afterwards.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of Allhallows was for many centuries in the hands of\r\n  the Prior and Convent of Holy Trinity, Aldgate. At the dissolution\r\n  of the monasteries in the sixteenth century it passed to the Crown,\r\n  and since then has belonged to the Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n  The church was fortunate enough to escape destruction during the\r\n  Great Fire in 1666, but it fell into a ruinous state about a century\r\n  later, and had to be demolished. The present structure, for the\r\n  erection of which a special Act of Parliament was passed, was\r\n  commenced in A.D. 1765, and cost £3000. The architect was George\r\n  Dance the younger, and it was his brother, Sir Nathaniel Dance\r\n  Holland, R.A., who presented to the church the magnificent painting\r\n  which hangs over the altar. It was a copy made by himself of the\r\n  famous picture in the Church of the Conception at Rome by Pietro\r\n  Berretini di Cortona, a Florentine painter of repute who died in\r\n  1669. The subject is the restoration to sight of Saul of Tarsus (St.\r\n  Paul) by Ananias at Damascus. The fifteenth-century monk in the\r\n  crowd gives a quaint touch of mediævalism to the scene.\r\n\r\n  The architecture of the church deserves a passing notice. The plan\r\n  is intended to reproduce a modified Roman Basilican church, but the\r\n  evidences of the Greek revival are shown in the character of the\r\n  Ionic capitals of the interior columns, as well as in the famous\r\n  Greek honeysuckle ornament, which appears both in the Roman\r\n  barrel-vault of the ceiling and in the frieze round the interior\r\n  walls. The church is almost unique in representing the transition\r\n  stage between the Italian renaissance and the short-lived\r\n  introduction of the Greek style.\r\n\r\n  Among the most famous rectors during the nineteenth century were the\r\n  Rev. William Beloe, the well-known translator of Herodotus and Aulus\r\n  Gellius; the Rev. Robert Nares, the Shakespearian glossary writer;\r\n  and the Rev. George Davys, who was tutor to the late Queen Victoria,\r\n  and became successively Rector of Allhallows, Dean of Chester, and\r\n  Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\nReturning to our section, from which we have somewhat strayed, we find\r\nWood Street has been already described.\r\n\r\nIn =Noble Street= stood the houses of Sir Nicholas Bacon and Sergeant\r\nFleetwood, Recorder of London. This street is dismissed by Stow in a few\r\nwords; it faced the City Wall westward, and so long as the Wall was\r\npreserved there was an open space of twenty feet at least free from\r\nbuildings, while without there was the City Ditch. It began at the end\r\nof Foster Lane, having the Church of St. John Zachary in the east, and\r\non the west, separated by a block of houses, the Church of St.\r\nAnne-of-the-Willows. Going up the street we pass Lilypot Lane, Oat Lane,\r\nleading to St. Mary Staining Church (see p. 47), and two or three\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of Noble Street was Engain Lane, called also Maiden\r\nLane, Ingelene Lane, or Ing Lane. Here a Roman pavement was found\r\n(_Proceedings of Soc. Antiq. Series_, i. 2. p. 184). Riley, in his\r\nIntroduction to the _Memorials_, thinks that this lane is lost. He\r\nsupposes, however, that the St. Michael “Hoggene Lane” was St. Michael\r\nQueenhithe, instead of St. Michael by Huggin Lane, which is adjacent.\r\n\r\nA continuation of Maiden Lane is St. Anne’s Lane or Distaff Lane.\r\n\r\nIn 1339, William de Clif bequeaths tenements in Igene Lane “elsewhere\r\ncalled Ing Lane and Engaynes end, afterwards Maiden Lane” (Prideaux,\r\n_Goldsmiths’ Company_, vol. i. p. 4). In 1560, “Mother Lowndes” had a\r\nmelting furnace in Maiden Lane. In 1627, Lord Nowell had the lease of a\r\nhouse in the lane. In 1642, Lord Campden wanted to purchase the messuage\r\nof which he held a lease, but was refused. In Staining Lane stood the\r\nalmshouses of the Haberdashers for the men of that Company.\r\n\r\nIn the modern Noble Street the new Post Office Hotel is a conspicuous\r\nobject on the east. Close by is Ye Noble Restaurant. Lilypot Lane is one\r\nconsecutive series of the less ornamental style of modern brick and\r\nstone warehouses. Ye Olde Bell next to Oat Lane is evidently an old\r\nhouse, and, seen in the vista of the street, has a considerable bow\r\nforward. It is plastered. The coat-of-arms over the wooden doorway of\r\nthe Coachmakers’ Hall arrests attention for a moment. Then we see Nos.\r\n16 and 17 on either side over the entry of Fitchett’s Court, which are\r\nreally old. They are of roughened red brick, dating from the rebuilding\r\nafter the Fire. Fitchett’s Court is a narrow stone-flagged _cul de sac_\r\nlined on either side with similar houses. At the upper end is a modern\r\nglass-roofed building. It is inhabited chiefly by manufacturers’ agents,\r\nbut is quaint, with a projecting bowed window near the entry, and a dark\r\nwoodwork doorway with two carved brackets supporting the cornice. The\r\nhouse mentioned above in Noble Street on the north of the Court is The\r\nRoyal Mail Tavern. The remainder of this street contains no point of\r\ninterest. The Coachmakers’ Hall stands on the east side of Noble Street,\r\nnorth of Oat Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE COACHMAKERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Hall stands on the site of Shelley House, owned by Sir Thomas\r\n  Shelley _temp_ Henry IV. Afterwards it was named Bacon House by\r\n  Nicholas Bacon. “A plain man, direct and constant, without all\r\n  finesse and doubleness,” who dwelt here till the Queen, Elizabeth,\r\n  made him Lord Keeper in 1558, when he moved hence. He was the father\r\n  of Lord Bacon, the philosopher. He sometime rebuilt this house, and\r\n  was buried in St. Paul’s, where his effigy yet remains. After the\r\n  Lord Keeper’s departure, William Fleetwood, Recorder of London,\r\n  lived here between 1575 and 1586, yet he seems to have died in a\r\n  house of his own building, in Noble Street, to the north of this\r\n  (1593-94). By continual industry, advanced by natural good parts, he\r\n  attained to the name of an eminent lawyer. He was a man of a merry\r\n  conceit, eloquent and very zealous against vagrants, mass-priests,\r\n  and papists. In 1638, Sir Arthur Savage and others sold the house to\r\n  one Charles Bostock, scrivener. Now, the Common Scriveners had been\r\n  a Company of this City by prescription, time out of mind. They made\r\n  regulations for their profession in 1373; in 1390 they began their\r\n  Common Paper, a book of ordinances and signatures, still extant. Yet\r\n  there is no account of any Hall for them. In 1497 they met at the\r\n  dwelling-place of Henry Woodcock, their warden; in 1557 at Wax\r\n  Chandlers’ Hall. Their Charter of Incorporation (January 28,\r\n  1616-17) ordained a Hall, so in 1631 they bought Bacon House for\r\n  £810. After the Great Fire of 1666 they rebuilt this.\r\n\r\n  Afterwards the Coachmakers Company treated for its purchase, and\r\n  bought it with houses in Oat Lane, for £1600, raised by gift. For\r\n  though coaches had become common since the seventeenth century\r\n  began, and the Coach and Coach-Harness Makers had been incorporated\r\n  in 1677, they had up till then no Hall.\r\n\r\n  Early in the nineteenth century the Hall had become a warehouse,\r\n  whose counting-house retained the Coachmakers’ arms and a name-list\r\n  of their benefactors. In 1841 they rebuilt it; in 1843 furnished it\r\n  anew by subscription.\r\n\r\n  In 1870, borrowing money, they built the present Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE COACH AND COACH-HARNESS MAKERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The date of the first charter is 31st May, 29 Charles II., 1677, and\r\n  is for the general protection and supervision of the trade of\r\n  coachmakers and coach-harness makers.\r\n\r\n  In the early days of the Company, the master, wardens, and\r\n  assistants used to visit all the workshops within the prescribed\r\n  limits of the Company’s sphere of action, but that seems to have\r\n  engendered bad feelings among the various members of the trade, and\r\n  so gradually fell into desuetude; but in 1864 the Company granted\r\n  the free use of the hall for the operative Coachmakers’ Industrial\r\n  Exhibition, which was opened under the auspices of the Marquis of\r\n  Lansdowne and the Very Reverend Dean Milman, D.D. From that time to\r\n  the present the Company have continuously offered prizes to those\r\n  connected with the trade.\r\n\r\n  At present the number of the livery is 115. The Corporate Income is\r\n  £970; there is no Trust Income. The Company have of late held\r\n  exhibitions and offered prizes for the encouragement of\r\n  coach-building.\r\n\r\nSt. Olave’s Churchyard is on the south side of Silver Street. A stone\r\ninscription tells us that the road was widened 8 feet in 1865 just at\r\nthis point. The disused graveyard is now open to the public as a\r\nrecreation ground, and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association have\r\ndistributed seats about among the old tombs. Low down by the steps at\r\nthe entrance is a stone slab bearing a heading of a skull and\r\ncross-bones, and beneath the following words:\r\n\r\n  This was the parish church of St. Olave’s, Silver Street, destroyed\r\n  by the Dreadful Fire in the year 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. OLAVE, SILVER STREET\r\n\r\n  This church was situated on the south side of Silver Street, in\r\n  Aldersgate Ward. It was destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt,\r\n  its parish being annexed to that of St. Alban’s, Wood Street. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1343.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was always in the hands of the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 130.\r\n\r\n  No monuments of any interest are recorded.\r\n\r\n  The parish received two charitable gifts: a messuage purchased for\r\n  £58, the gift of Roger James; and £5 : 10s., to be paid every tenth\r\n  year, the gift of Bernard Hyde.\r\n\r\nIn Silver Street, No. 24 is the Parish Clerks’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PARISH CLERKS\r\n\r\n  The Parish Clerks were first incorporated by 12 Henry III., 1232,\r\n  and confirmed by 14 Henry IV., 1412. In 1547, the first year of\r\n  Edward VI., all lands and properties belonging to fraternities not\r\n  being mysteries and crafts, were declared Crown possessions; thus\r\n  the Parish Clerks suffered the loss of their hall in Bishopsgate,\r\n  which was sold to Sir Robert Chester in 1548. In vain they disputed\r\n  the King’s claim; in vain obtained powerful support in the City, and\r\n  hoped to win the day: Sir Robert pulled down their hall, and they\r\n  were homeless. Then they took quarters at the north-west corner of\r\n  Broad Lane in the Vintry; the site is now thrown into the roadway of\r\n  Queen Street Place. Immortal Machyn, in his diary, 1562, records\r\n  that, after service at the Guildhall chapel and procession, that\r\n  year the Parish Clerks went to “their own” hall to dine; this was\r\n  the Broad Lane house. Little enough is known of the premises: the\r\n  Clerks were paying thirty-one nobles (£10 : 6: 8) rent in 1583; in\r\n  1592 they commenced publishing the Bills of Mortality; on renewing\r\n  the lease in 1628, for forty years, they handed to “the superior”\r\n  £40 as fine. By this time they had been reincorporated by the 8\r\n  James I., 1611, and were confirmed by 12 Charles I., 1636. They seem\r\n  to have covered their rent from 1648 onwards by letting the lower\r\n  rooms and cellars on lease for £11 per annum. In 1625 the Star\r\n  Chamber granted them permission to set up a printing-press in this\r\n  hall for the purpose of issuing the weekly Bills of Mortality. Here\r\n  also the Company appointed its own joiner, carpenter, and\r\n  bricklayer, nor omitted to secure the all-important cook. By 1637\r\n  the bricklayer had new-tiled the roof; he charged £12: also the\r\n  joiner had wainscotted the parlour, but the Clerks thought his bill\r\n  of £13 rather too much; he must include “some convenient work in\r\n  addition,” to be set up above the three doors in the newly\r\n  wainscotted room, then they would pay him and appoint him their\r\n  official joiner. The Great Fire destroyed this hall two years before\r\n  the lease was up. For some time the Court of the Company wandered\r\n  from tavern to tavern, but in 1671 ultimately settled at their\r\n  present hall in Silver Street.\r\n\r\n=Monkwell Street=, anciently written Mugwell, Muggewell, or Mogwell\r\nStreet, was so called, according to Stow, after a well in the Hermitage\r\nof St. James at the north end of the street. The Hermitage was a cell\r\nbelonging to Garendon Abbey where two or three of the brethren resided\r\nas chaplains. There is no doubt about the house or the Hermitage, and\r\nvery possibly there was a well within its small precinct. At the same\r\ntime the ancient form of the name, Mugwell, does not suggest the word\r\nMonk. It seems probable that the name was originally Mugwell, and that\r\nafter the Dissolution the memory of the well was kept up by a corruption\r\nof the name. The street appears to have been outside the industries of\r\nNorth London. It is mentioned many times in the _Calendar of Wills_, but\r\nnever in connection with workshops or trading shops. Between 1277 and\r\n1576 there are the entries of the street. They all speak of rents,\r\ntenements, and houses. In the year 1349 we find a brewery in the street.\r\nThis naturally inclines us to think that there must have been a well—?\r\nMugwell—to supply the brewery. In Riley’s _Memorials_ it is mentioned\r\nonce only in connection with a tourelle of London Wall near the street.\r\nThe Hermitage was succeeded by Lamb’s Chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BARBERS\r\n\r\n  This Fraternity should also be of extreme antiquity. When or why the\r\n  barbers took upon themselves the practice of surgery I do not know.\r\n  It was the custom of the Roman Catholic Church to allow\r\n  ecclesiastics to become physicians on the condition (Council of\r\n  Tours, 1163) that they abstained from fire and steel; Rabelais, for\r\n  instance, in the fifteenth century, practised medicine subject to\r\n  this condition. But some kinds of surgery are necessary:\r\n  bone-setting, for instance, which was understood and performed by\r\n  the common people; dentistry, which at first fell into the hands of\r\n  barbers but afterwards became a separate mystery practised by\r\n  itinerants; cupping, blood-letting, the dressing of wounds, and\r\n  amputations also fell into the hands of the barbers. But not of all\r\n  the barbers. Surgery advanced by degrees; it became a distinct\r\n  profession before it was recognised.\r\n\r\n  That the barbers practised blood-letting is proved by an ordinance\r\n  of 1307 forbidding them to put blood in their windows in view of\r\n  folks. In 1308, Richard le Barber is presented to the mayor and\r\n  admitted Master over the trade of Barbers. He swore to make scrutiny\r\n  among the craft, and if he found any keeping brothels or acting\r\n  unseemly he would distrain upon them. The oath indicates that\r\n  barbers were suspected of keeping disorderly houses; in fact they\r\n  looked after the bagnios, which were always regarded with\r\n  well-founded suspicion. Barbers were often appointed as gatekeepers.\r\n  The reason would seem difficult to find, until it is remembered that\r\n  it was strictly forbidden that lepers should enter the City, and\r\n  that barbers were better able than other men from their medical\r\n  knowledge to detect them.\r\n\r\n  The earliest admission of a surgeon is recorded in the year 1312.\r\n  John of Southwark is described as “cirurgicus.” Clearly he was that\r\n  and nothing else; not a shaving man at all.\r\n\r\n  Some of them were wealthy. For instance, Hamo the Barber in 1340 was\r\n  assessed at £10 as his contribution towards a forced loan of £5000\r\n  to the King.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1376, the fraternity was ruled by two masters\r\n  representing the two divisions of barbers—who could also let blood\r\n  and draw teeth—and surgeons.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1388, the King sent writs all over the kingdom to\r\n  inquire into the constitution of the guilds and fraternities then\r\n  existing in the country. The returns appear to have been lost. But\r\n  the return sent in by the barbers still exists in a copy preserved\r\n  at Barbers’ Hall. It is published _in extenso_ in Mr. Sidney Young’s\r\n  book. It is a long document, and it pours a flood of light upon the\r\n  guilds and their laws. The original is in Norman French.\r\n\r\n  Since the barbers were not yet incorporated, they had no authority\r\n  except over their own members. They could not, therefore, prevent\r\n  the formation of a Fraternity of Surgeons, who practised without any\r\n  reference to the barbers. In 1376, the barbers, no doubt because of\r\n  this rival guild, complained against incompetent persons practising\r\n  surgery, and prayed that two masters should rule the craft, and that\r\n  none should be admitted without examination. In 1390, the Surgeons’\r\n  Guild obtained powers to appoint five masters for the directing of\r\n  those practising surgery and of women as well as men. The surgeons\r\n  thereupon tried to exercise the right of scrutiny over the barbers,\r\n  who claimed and obtained the protection of the City.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1461, Edward IV. granted the barbers a Charter of\r\n  Incorporation.\r\n\r\n  The preamble to the Letters Patent, 1 Edward IV., by which the\r\n  Company were incorporated, recites that the Freemen of the Mystery\r\n  of Barbers of the City of London, using the Mystery or Faculty of\r\n  Surgery, had for a long time exercised and sustained and still\r\n  continued to exercise and sustain great application and labour, as\r\n  well about the curing and healing wounds, blows, and other\r\n  infirmities as in the letting of blood and drawing of teeth, and\r\n  that by the ignorance and unskilfulness of some of the said barbers,\r\n  as well freemen of the said City as of others being foreign\r\n  surgeons, many misfortunes had happened to divers people by the\r\n  unskilfulness of such barbers and surgeons in healing and curing\r\n  wounds, blows, hurts, and other infirmities, and that it was to be\r\n  feared that the like or worse evils might thereafter ensue unless a\r\n  suitable remedy was speedily provided in the premises.\r\n\r\n  And it was thereby granted to the freemen of the said mystery of\r\n  barbers in the said City of London, that the said mystery and all\r\n  the men of the said mystery, should be one body, and one perpetual\r\n  community, with power for electing two masters or governors, and\r\n  that the said masters or governors and commonalty and their\r\n  successors might make statutes and ordinances for the government of\r\n  the said mysteries. And that the masters or governors for the time\r\n  being, and their successors, should have the survey, search,\r\n  correction, and government of all the freemen of the said City being\r\n  surgeons, using the mystery of barbers in the said City, and other\r\n  surgeons being foreigners practising the mystery of surgery within\r\n  the said City and suburbs thereof, and the punishment of them for\r\n  offences in not perfectly executing, performing, and using the said\r\n  mystery, and should have the survey of all manner of instruments,\r\n  plaisters, and other medicines, and the receipts used by the said\r\n  barbers and surgeons for the curing and healing of sores, wounds,\r\n  hurts, and such like infirmities. And that no barber using the said\r\n  mystery of surgery within the said City or suburbs should be\r\n  thereafter admitted to exercise the same mystery unless he had first\r\n  been approved of as well instructed in that mystery by the said\r\n  masters or governors, or their successors sufficiently qualified in\r\n  that behalf.\r\n\r\n  By the Act of Parliament of 32 Henry VIII., after reciting that\r\n  within the said City of London there were then two several and\r\n  distinct companies of surgeons exercising the science and faculty of\r\n  surgery, the one company called the Barbers of London, and the other\r\n  called the Surgeons of London, and that the former were incorporated\r\n  by the Letters Patent of 1 Edward IV., but the latter had not any\r\n  manner of incorporation; it was enacted that the two several and\r\n  distinct companies, and their successors, should from thenceforth be\r\n  united and made one entire and whole body corporate, which should\r\n  thereafter be called by the name of Masters or Governors of the\r\n  Mystery or Commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons of London.\r\n\r\n  The Letters Patent of 1 James and 5 Chas. I., granted and confirmed\r\n  to the united companies: All and singular the manors, messuages,\r\n  lands, tenements, customs, liberties, franchises, immunities,\r\n  jurisdictions, and hereditaments of the united companies of barbers\r\n  and surgeons then held by them and enjoyed under any letters patent\r\n  of any former kings and queens or by colour of any lawful\r\n  prescription, with power to make byelaws, annual elections, appoint\r\n  examiners of surgeons, and that no person should exercise surgery\r\n  within the cities of London and Westminster or within the distance\r\n  of seven miles of the said cities, unless previously examined; and\r\n  by the public letters testimonial of the said company, under their\r\n  common seal, and admitted to exercise the said art or mystery of\r\n  surgery under the penalty therein mentioned; and that all persons so\r\n  examined and admitted as aforesaid might exercise the art in any\r\n  other places whatsoever of the kingdom of England, with power to\r\n  appoint lectures for instruction in the principles and rudiments in\r\n  the art of chirurgery.\r\n\r\n  By the Act of 18 Geo. 2, cap. 15, after reciting the\r\n  before-mentioned Acts, and that the barbers had for many years past\r\n  been engaged in a business foreign to and independent of the\r\n  practice of surgery, and the surgeons being then become a numerous\r\n  and considerable body, and finding their union with the barbers\r\n  inconvenient in many respects, and in no degree conducive to the\r\n  progress of the art of surgery, and that a separation of the\r\n  corporation of barbers and surgeons would contribute to the\r\n  improvement of surgery, it was enacted that the said union and\r\n  incorporation of barbers and surgeons should, after June 24, 1745,\r\n  be dissolved, and the surgeons were constituted a separate and\r\n  distinct body corporate by the name of the Master, Governors, and\r\n  Commonalty of the Art and Science of Surgeons of London; and the\r\n  barbers were thereby constituted a body corporate and commonalty\r\n  perpetual, which should be called by the name of the Master,\r\n  Governors, and Commonalty of the Mystery of Barbers of London.\r\n\r\n  The Barbers Company, since their separation from the surgeons, have\r\n  continued to conduct the affairs of the Company.\r\n\r\n  The Hall of the Company is mentioned by Stow with certain\r\n  particulars of their history:\r\n\r\n  “In this west side is the Barbers-Chirurgeons’ hall. This Company\r\n  was incorporated by means of Thomas Morestede, esquire, one of the\r\n  sheriffs of London 1436, chirurgeon to the kings of England, Henry\r\n  IV., V., and VI.: he deceased 1450. Then Jaques Fries, physician to\r\n  Edward IV., and William Hobbs, physician and chirurgeon for the same\r\n  king’s body, continuing the suit the full time of twenty years,\r\n  Edward IV., in the 2nd of his reign, and Richard, Duke of\r\n  Gloucester, became founders of the same corporation in the name of\r\n  St. Cosme and St. Damiane. The first assembly of that craft was\r\n  Roger Strippe, W. Hobbs, T. Goddard, and Richard Kent; since the\r\n  which time they built their hall in that street, etc.”\r\n\r\n  The number of the livery is about 120. There are no particulars as\r\n  to the Corporate Income of the Company. The Trust Income is about\r\n  £650 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GROUP III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third group of streets is that which is bounded on the south by\r\nCannon Street, on the east by Bishopsgate Street and Gracechurch Street,\r\nand on the west by Moorgate Street, Princes Street, and Walbrook, and\r\nnorthward by the City limits.\r\n\r\nThis, with Cheapside, includes the very heart and centre of the City. In\r\nit are the streets called Cornhill, Lombard Street, Threadneedle Street,\r\nThrogmorton Street, Lothbury, Princes Street, and Broad Street. Here\r\nwere formerly the ecclesiastical foundations of the Austin Friars and\r\nSt. Anthony’s. Here are the Royal Exchange, the Bank of England, the\r\nMansion House, the offices of many Banks and of Companies; the site of\r\nsuch well-known houses as the Baltic, the South Sea House, Garraway’s,\r\nthe Jerusalem, the London Tavern. In Lombard Street we have the first\r\nhouse of City Firemen and the first Post Office. In Broad Street is the\r\nsite of Gresham House, afterwards Gresham College, founded with such a\r\nnoble ambition, fallen now to so poor a place.\r\n\r\nIn this place it is proposed to take the principal streets and lanes and\r\nto set down whatever points of interest have not been touched upon in\r\nthe large History of London.\r\n\r\n=Cornhill= has been a crowded street from time immemorial. Stow says\r\nthat there was here a corn market. It does not seem proved, however,\r\nthat there ever was one here. Loftie points out that the London corn\r\nmarket was on the east side of St. Michael-le-Querne, opposite Bread\r\nStreet. It has been suggested that the family of Coren Hell or Corn Hill\r\ngave their name to the ward. In 1125 there is Edward Heep Cornhill among\r\nthose engaged in the conveyance of the Portsoken to the Holy Trinity\r\nPriory. But a market of some sort was most certainly held here, and it\r\nmay have been originally a corn market.\r\n\r\nWe must not suppose that the division of trades and markets was ever\r\nrigidly observed. If there were bakers in Bread Street, there may have\r\nbeen bakers elsewhere for the general convenience. Then in 1347 (Riley’s\r\n_Memorials_, p. 236) there was a corn market in Gracechurch Street and\r\nanother in Newgate Street. The market was opposite the Franciscan House,\r\nso that perhaps we may accept Stow’s statement and conclude that the\r\ncorn market of Cornhill gradually receded eastward into Gracechurch\r\nStreet, where it was presently absorbed by Leadenhall Market, which is\r\nreckoned by Stow as in Cornhill.\r\n\r\nIn 1310 proclamation was made in the City as follows:\r\n\r\n“It is ordered and commanded on the King’s behalf, that no man or woman\r\nshall be so daring or so bold as from henceforth to hold a common market\r\nfor any manner of merchandise in the highway of Chepe after the hour of\r\nNone, as heretofore they have done; nor yet in any other place within\r\nthe City, save only upon Cornhulle; and that, from Matins until the hour\r\nof None, and not after: on pain of forfeiture of the goods so carried\r\nthere to sell, by way of holding common market there” (Riley’s\r\n_Memorials_, p. 75).\r\n\r\nThe hour of “None” is from two to three. What was the meaning of this\r\nproclamation? Why must the markets of Chepe be closed at three while\r\nthose of Cornhill remained open? But in 1369, because many cheats had\r\nbeen possible by selling things after dark, it was ordered that at the\r\nringing of the bell upon the Tun at sunset (not the bell of St.\r\nMary-le-Bow, which only belonged to West Chepe), all shops and stalls\r\nwere to be closed.\r\n\r\nThe Tun, of which mention has often been made in other volumes of this\r\nbook, was a small prison, something like a tun, built by Henry le Waleys\r\nin 1282. Beside it was a conduit built by the same citizen. And there\r\nwas a standard for Thames water brought there by the contrivance of one\r\nPeter Morris, a Dutchman. Distances were reckoned from the standard of\r\nCornhill.\r\n\r\nHere were stocks for the sturdy beggar, the lazar, should he venture\r\ninto the City, and fraudulent dealers. Here was a pillory for similar\r\noffenders; one William Felde stood in it in 1375 for cheating hucksters\r\nof ale. Here Gyleson also, in 1348, was so put to public shame for\r\nselling putrid pork, some of which was burned under his nose to his\r\nunspeakable discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe earliest occupants of Cornhill, according to Strype, were drapers.\r\nIt is, however, certain that other trades were established there. Thus\r\nin 1302 there is a baker of Cornhill; in 1318 a bakehouse opposite the\r\nPillory; in 1345 the City poulterers are ordered not to sell east of the\r\nTun on Cornhill, while the “foreign” poulterers are sent to Leadenhall;\r\nin 1342, “false” blankets are burned in Cornhill; in 1347 there is a\r\nturner of Cornhill; in 1364 a tailor; in 1365 the pelterers are ordered\r\nto carry on their business in Cornhill, Walbrook, and Budge Row only; in\r\n1372 the blacksmiths are confined for the exhibition of their wares to\r\nGracechurch Street, St. Nicholas Fleshambles’ (Newgate), and the Tun of\r\nCornhill.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of common clerks illustrated by Stow is noted elsewhere.\r\nAs regards the Tun, he writes:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE PUMP IN CORNHILL, 1800\r\n]\r\n\r\n“By the west side of the foresaid prison, then called the Tun, was a\r\nfair well of spring water curbed round with hard stone; but in the year\r\n1401, the said prison house, called the Tun, was made a cistern for\r\nsweet water, conveyed by pipes of lead from Tiborne, and was from\r\nthenceforth called the Conduit upon Cornhill. Then was the well planked\r\nover, and a strong prison made of timber called a cage, with a pair of\r\nstocks therein set upon it, and this was for night walkers. On the top\r\nof which cage was placed a pillory, for the punishment of bakers\r\noffending in the assize of bread, for millers stealing of corn at the\r\nmill, for bawds, scolds, and other offenders. As in the year 1468, the\r\n7th of Edward IV., divers persons being common jurors, such as at\r\nassizes were forsworn for rewards, or favour of parties, were judged to\r\nride from Newgate to the pillory in Cornhill, with mitres of paper on\r\ntheir heads, there to stand, and from thence again to Newgate, and this\r\njudgment was given by the mayor of London. In the year 1509, the 1st of\r\nHenry VIII., Darby, Smith, and Simson, ringleaders of false inquests in\r\nLondon, rode about the city with their faces to the horse tails, and\r\npapers on their heads, and were set on the pillory in Cornhill, and\r\nafter brought again to Newgate, where they died for very shame, saith\r\nRobert Fabian.\r\n\r\n“The foresaid conduit upon Cornhill, was in the year 1475 enlarged by\r\nRobert Drope, draper, mayor, that then dwelt in that ward; he increased\r\nthe cistern of this conduit with an east end of stone and castellated it\r\nin comely manner” (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 208).\r\n\r\nIn the time of Stow there were still standing some of the old houses,\r\nbuilt of stone in accordance with the regulations of Henry Fitz Aylwin\r\nand other mayors. The danger of fire was thus diminished. But those\r\nhouses which in many cases were built round open courts, covering a\r\nlarge space and of no more than two stories in height, were gradually\r\ntaken down and houses of four or five stories built in their place, a\r\nfact which must be remembered when we read of the Great Fire. All those\r\nbroad courts and open spaces which might have checked the Fire at so\r\nmany points were gone in 1666, and replaced by high houses standing\r\ntogether and by narrow courts.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Exchange, the Bank of England, and the Mansion House are so\r\nmixed up with the general history of London that they must be sought for\r\nin the volumes that have preceded this.\r\n\r\nThe Weigh-house was the place where all merchandise brought across the\r\nsea was taken to be weighed at the King’s beam. “This house hath a\r\nmaster, and under him four master porters, with porters under them: they\r\nhave a strong cart, and four great horses, to draw and carry the wares\r\nfrom the merchants’ houses to the beam and back again” (Stow, p. 73).\r\nThe house was built by Sir Thomas Lovell, “with a fair front of\r\ntenements towards the street.” The cart therefore was taken into an\r\ninner court through a gateway, as we might expect.\r\n\r\nThere were many taverns in and about Cornhill.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century was still standing one of the old stone houses\r\nof which we have spoken. This was popularly known as “King John’s\r\nHouse.” Now at the granting of the commune to the City, John lodged at\r\nthe house of Richard Fitz Richer, the sheriff. Possibly this was the\r\nhouse. Pope’s Head Alley marks the site of the Pope’s Head Tavern, which\r\nhad the ancient arms of England, three leopards between two angels,\r\nengraved in stone on the front. Stow thinks it may have been a royal\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nA perspective view of =Cornhill= at the present day gives a very fine\r\neffect. The sides are lined with large buildings on the erection of\r\nwhich no time or expense has been spared, and the protuberant stone\r\ndecoration and the lines of enriched windows give on the whole an\r\nappearance of wealth and dignity. Yet, taken singly, there are few of\r\nthese buildings that deserve any commendation. There is a sameness and\r\nwant of originality. Everywhere are round-headed windows and stone\r\nfoliage; everywhere the same shaped roof projections and pinnacles. The\r\nflagged space in front of the Royal Exchange is decorated by trees in\r\ntubs, and on it stands an equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington.\r\nThis was executed by Sir Francis Chantrey in 1844. The Royal Exchange\r\nlines the side of the street for some distance and all round the\r\nground-floor are shops, etc. Beyond it is a second open space. The\r\nstatue here facing southward is of Rowland Hill. The figure is on a\r\nblock of polished granite.\r\n\r\nBeyond Finch Lane the Union Bank of Australia stands out as one of the\r\nexceptions to the general monotony of the street. It is of white stone,\r\nin a severe style without undue excrescences, and the chief ornament is\r\na row of sculpturesque figures supporting the cornice.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Cornhill an entrance to St. Peter’s Church first\r\nattracts attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. PETER, CORNHILL\r\n\r\n  This church is possibly the most ancient in the City. It was\r\n  practically rebuilt in the reign of Edward IV. and thoroughly\r\n  renovated in 1632, but so damaged by the Great Fire that after\r\n  attempts at restoration it had to be rebuilt. The present building\r\n  was erected by Wren in 1680-81. The earliest known date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1263—one John de Cabanicis. There is an unbroken\r\n  succession since John de Exeter, 1282.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the family of Nevil\r\n  before 1263, one of whom, Lady Alice Nevil, conveyed it in 1362 to\r\n  Richard, Earl of Arundell, for a term of years; in 1380 to Thomas\r\n  Coggeshall and others; in 1402 to Hampweyde Bohern, Earl of\r\n  Hereford. It was again conveyed about, or shortly before, 1395 to\r\n  Robert and Margaret Rykedon and others, who presented to it in 1405;\r\n  it was confirmed to Richard Whittington and others in 1408, who in\r\n  turn confirmed it in 1411 to the Mayor and Commonalty of London, in\r\n  whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 500.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 80 feet in length, 47 feet in breadth, and 40\r\n  feet in height, and contains a nave and two aisles separated from\r\n  the central portion by Corinthian columns. There is a very fine\r\n  screen, one of the only two erected in the City of London, and the\r\n  only one remaining in its original position. The steeple, which\r\n  rises at the south-west, attains a height of 140 feet, and consists\r\n  of a tower and cornice surmounted by a cupola, an octagonal lantern,\r\n  and a spire, terminating in St. Peter’s emblem, the Key. The view of\r\n  the exterior is blocked on the north by intervening houses, but on\r\n  the south the church is open to the churchyard.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by Roger FitzRoger previous to 1284; by\r\n  Nicholas Pycot at the Altar of St. Nicholas in 1312; by Philip de\r\n  Ufford at the Altar of St. Katherine in 1321; by Robert de la Hyde\r\n  at the Altar of St. George in 1328; by William Elliot (William of\r\n  Kingston) at the Altar of the Holy Trinity, for himself, Sarah and\r\n  Alynor his wives, and for his father and mother in 1375; by John\r\n  Foxton at the Altar of St. George in 1382; by John Waleys at the\r\n  same altar in 1409; and by Dame Alice Brudenel in 1437 to the Altar\r\n  of St. Nicholas. There were also chantries founded by Richard\r\n  Morley, Peter Mason, and John Lane. The Guild or Fraternity of St.\r\n  Peter was established in this church by Henry IV. in 1403 at the\r\n  intercession of Queen Johanna, William Aghton being rector. The\r\n  valuation of the Rectory _temp_ Henry VIII. was £39 : 5 : 7½, to\r\n  which was added tenths from the chantries amounting to £14 : 14 : 4.\r\n\r\n  A large number of monuments are recorded by Stow, some of the most\r\n  notable of which were in memory of: William of Kingston; Margery\r\n  Clopton, widow of Robert Clopton; Sir Christopher Morice, Master\r\n  Gunner of England to Henry VIII.; Sir Henry Huberthorne, Merchant\r\n  Taylor, and Lord Mayor of the City; Francis Breerewood, Treasurer of\r\n  Christ’s Hospital; Sir William Bowyer. John Carpenter, the famous\r\n  Town Clerk of London and compiler of the _Liber Albus_, was also\r\n  buried here. In the vestry is an interesting tablet copy of one\r\n  hanging in St. Paul’s Cathedral from A.D. 1300, and preserved from\r\n  the Great Fire, to the effect that this church was the first founded\r\n  in London, and that it was erected by King Lucius in 179—a legend\r\n  which Stow himself appears not to have believed. There is here,\r\n  also, the old key-board and organ-stops used by Mendelssohn when he\r\n  played in St. Peter’s in 1840 and 1842. The portraits of Bishop\r\n  Beveridge and Bishop Waugh, both of whom were rectors here for some\r\n  years, hang on the walls. A fine manuscript Vulgate, with\r\n  illuminations, written for the Altar of the Holy Trinity in St.\r\n  Peter’s, is also preserved in the vestry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  ST. PETER’S, CORNHILL\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Among the most important charities were those of: Laurence Thompson,\r\n  1601, who left £100 in trust for tea, coal, and bread for the poor\r\n  of the parish. William Walthal, 1606, who left £246 : 13 : 4, £200\r\n  of which was to be lent to the struggling shopkeepers of the parish,\r\n  the interest to be distributed in bread and coal. The Robert Warden\r\n  (1609) bequest for Ash Wednesday sermons and Sunday bread to be\r\n  administered through the Poulterers Company. The Lucy Edge (1630)\r\n  bequest for the weekly lecture. Sir Benjamin Thorowgood’s (1682)\r\n  bequest of three shops at the west end of the church for the\r\n  maintenance of the organ and organist; and the Gibbs’ bequest\r\n  (1864). Of these, all, with the exception of the Lucy Edge and\r\n  Gibbs’ bequests, which provide for the Thursday lecturer, and part\r\n  of the Robert Warden bequest, which provides for the Ash Wednesday\r\n  sermon before the Poulterers Company, have been appropriated, with\r\n  other endowments, by the City Parochial Charities, out of which\r\n  common fund a yearly allowance is made for the upkeep of the Church.\r\n\r\n  John Hodgkin, Bishop of Bedford, 1537, was rector here; also John\r\n  Taylor (d. 1554), Bishop of Lincoln; Francis White (d. 1638), Bishop\r\n  of Ely; William Beveridge (1637-1708), Bishop of St. Asaph; John\r\n  Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle, 1723—he is buried in front of the present\r\n  altar.\r\n\r\nNext door to the church is another of the exceptions in the street, a\r\nwell-designed terra-cotta building. The building is in a late\r\nPerpendicular or Tudor style, and is appropriately named Tudor Chambers.\r\nSt. Peter’s Alley leads to the graveyard at the back of the church,\r\nwhich is cut in two by an abnormally broad sweeping way up to the centre\r\ndoor. Plainly built chambers of many stories look down on the dusty\r\nevergreens of the churchyard. The next object of interest is the deeply\r\nrecessed and beautifully ornamented porch of St. Michael, which stands\r\nback a little from the line of the street. By the side of the church is\r\nSt. Michael’s Alley, which leads us to the graveyard. In this a small\r\ncloister or entry with vaulted roof leads through to the churchyard, a\r\nspace of newly turned soil with a fringe of the inevitable evergreen\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nThe great London coffee-house was set up in St. Michael’s Alley in 1652\r\nby one Pasqua Rosee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. MICHAEL, CORNHILL\r\n\r\n  The body of St. Michael’s Church was destroyed in the Great Fire and\r\n  rebuilt by Wren in 1672; the tower was injured and pulled down in\r\n  1722, when the present tower, also the work of Wren, was erected. In\r\n  1858 it was greatly altered by Sir Gilbert Scott. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1287.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Alnoth the priest,\r\n  before 1133, who granted it to the Abbot and Convent of Evesham, who\r\n  gave it in 1133 to Sparling the priest; the Abbot and Convent of\r\n  Evesham, who granted it in 1505 to Simon Hogan, who bequeathed it to\r\n  the Drapers’ Company, who presented to it in 1515, and in whose\r\n  successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 87 feet in length, 60 feet in breadth, and 35\r\n  feet in height, and contains two aisles divided from the nave by\r\n  Doric columns. The church was originally in the Italian style, but\r\n  the alterations in 1858-60 by Sir Gilbert Scott give the appearance\r\n  of a nineteenth-century imitation of mediævalism. The tower is\r\n  Gothic in architecture, and contains three stories crowned by a\r\n  parapet from the angles of which four pinnacles rise up. The total\r\n  height is 130 feet. The church has always been famous for its bells,\r\n  of which it possesses 12.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Walter de Bullingham, to which John\r\n  de Bourge was admitted chaplain, August 22, 1390; Thomas Baker\r\n  augmented the endowment by £2 : 18 : 8; Ralph More was chaplain in\r\n  1548, “a man of 50 yrs. who hath lyen bedridden this 18 years”;\r\n  Simon Smith; William Comerton at the Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary;\r\n  Hamo Box, for which the King granted his licence, July 28, 1321;\r\n  William Rus, whose endowment for this and other purposes fetched\r\n  £27 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when William Penne was priest “of the age of\r\n  38 years, and of indifferent learning and hath none other living but\r\n  this his yearly stipend of £8”; Andrew Smythe, who endowed it with\r\n  lands, etc., which fetched £12 in 1548, when John Paddye was priest\r\n  “of the age of 26 years, indifferently learned, having no other\r\n  living or promotion over and above his stipend of £7 : 6 : 7”; Simon\r\n  Mordonne, mayor, 1368, who left tenements valued at £9 in 1548, when\r\n  John Campyon was priest, “of the age of 66 years, a good singer and\r\n  indifferently well learned, having none other living besides this\r\n  his stipend of £6 : 18 : 4”; John Langhorne, who endowed it with\r\n  tenements which yielded £10 : 8s. in 1548, when Abail Mortcock was\r\n  priest, “of the age of 36 years, whose qualities, conversation, and\r\n  learning is as the other and hath none other living but this his\r\n  stipend of £6 : 13 : 4.” The King granted his licence to Peter Smart\r\n  and others to found a guild in honour of St. Anne and Our Lady,\r\n  September 27, 1397, which was valued at £17 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when\r\n  Sir William Bryck was chaplain “of the age of 33 years, moderately\r\n  well learned.” John Shopman and others have licence to found a guild\r\n  in honour of Blessed Virgin Mary with special devotion to St.\r\n  Michael the Archangel, October 4, 1442.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CONFECTIONER’S SHOP, CORNHILL\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Alderman Robert Fabian (d. 1513) was buried here in 1513; he\r\n  compiled an elaborate chronicle, _The Concordance of Histories_,\r\n  dealing with France as well as England. This church is specially\r\n  connected with the antiquary John Stow, and both his father and\r\n  grandfather were buried here. Against the north walk there is a\r\n  monument in memory of John Vernon, erected in place of one consumed\r\n  by the Fire, by the Merchant Taylors in 1609; he was a donor of\r\n  several large legacies. In 1609 John Cowper was buried here—founder\r\n  of a family whose memory is still preserved in connection with\r\n  Cowper’s Court, Cornhill. To this family the poet Cowper belonged.\r\n\r\n  The parish was extremely rich in charitable gifts. Brass tablets are\r\n  affixed to the sides of the tower recording the dates, etc., of\r\n  repairs, and the benefactors in connection, amongst whom are the\r\n  following: Sir John Langham, £500; Sir Edward Riccard, £100; James\r\n  Clotheroe, £50. Other benefactors were Robert Drope, donor of £30,\r\n  and his wife Jane, afterwards Viscountess Lisle, of £90.\r\n\r\n  William Brough (d. 1671), Dean of Gloucester, and author of several\r\n  religious works, was rector here; also Robert Poole-Finch\r\n  (1724-1803), chaplain of Guy’s Hospital and a preacher of some\r\n  eminence.\r\n\r\nNo. 15 Cornhill is the oldest shop of its class in the Metropolis. The\r\nwindow is set in a carved wooden framework, painted green, which\r\nencloses the small glass panes in three arches. It was established as a\r\nconfectioner’s shop in the time of George I., and it is a confectioner’s\r\nstill. Within, the low roof and thick woodwork testify its age. It might\r\neasily be overlooked, as the brick house rising above it presents no\r\nnoticeable feature.\r\n\r\nOf =Change Alley= one has to note that Jonathan’s Coffee-house was the\r\nresort of those who dealt and dabbled in stocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GARRAWAY’S COFFEE-HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\n            Why did ‘Change Alley waste thy precious hours,\r\n            Among the fools who gap’d for golden show’rs?\r\n            No wonder if we found some poets there,\r\n            Who live on fancy and can feed on air;\r\n            No wonder they were caught by South-Sea schemes,\r\n            Who ne’er enjoyed a guinea but in dreams.\r\n\r\nHere also were Garraway’s and Robins’ Coffee-houses. In 1722 “the better\r\nsort,” according to Defoe, who carried on business as a hosier in\r\nFreemason’s Court, met at these coffee-houses before going to the\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\nThe present Stock Exchange was not erected till the year 1801.\r\n\r\nStrype thus speaks of the Alley as it was after improvements:\r\n\r\n“Exchange Alley, that lies next eastward, hath two passages out of\r\nCornhill; one into Lombard Street, and another bending east into Birchin\r\nLane. It is a large Place vastly improved, chiefly out of an house of\r\nAlderman Backwall’s, a Goldsmith, before the Great Fire, well built,\r\ninhabited by tradesmen; especially that passage into Lombard Street\r\nagainst the Exchange, and is a place of a very considerable concourse of\r\nMerchants, seafaring men and other traders, occasioned by the great\r\nCoffee houses, Jonathan’s and Garraway’s, that stand there. Chiefly now\r\nbrokers, and such as deal in buying and selling of Stocks, frequent it.\r\nThe Alley is broad and well paved with free-stones, neatly kept. The\r\nFleece Tavern, seated in Cornhill, hath a passage into this Alley, being\r\na very large house and of great resort.” At No. 41 Thomas Gray the poet\r\nwas born on December 24, 1716.\r\n\r\nChange Alley is at present a winding and tortuous thoroughfare. It bears\r\nthe date 1886 over the western entry, and contains many red and glazed\r\nwhite brick houses. Close by this entry is the Bakers’ Chop House, a\r\ncurious little old building with projecting windows of dark wood.\r\n\r\nIn the next portion of Change Alley is a well-built red brick building\r\nby R. Norman Shaw, with a slab on the north-east corner bearing the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n           The site of Garraway’s Coffee House, rebuilt 1874;\r\n\r\nand beneath is a large stone grasshopper.\r\n\r\n=Gracechurch Street=, called also Grass church, Garscherche, and\r\nGracious Street, was formerly a market for hay, corn, malt, cheese, etc.\r\nThere was uncertainty about the name, for in 1329 we find it written\r\nGrescherche Street, in 1333 Grascherche Street, a form of the name which\r\nis afterwards repeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1275 there is a will by one Martin de Garscherche bequeathing\r\nproperty to his sons and daughters; in 1294, 1311, and 1324, we hear of\r\ntenements in Garscherche, which seems as if the place was then an open\r\nmarket, not yet settled down to a street; perhaps, however, the dignity\r\nof a street was sometimes conferred upon it, for in 1296 there is\r\nmention of Leadenhall in Garscherch Street, and in 1342 it is also named\r\nas a street.\r\n\r\nIn 1320 one of the supervisors of shoes was Richard le Cordewaner of\r\n“Gras cherche”; in 1347 a jury of “Graschirche,” consisting of a butcher\r\nand eleven others, accused John de Burstalle of selling corn at more\r\nthan the legal price, and he was sent to prison for forty days; in 1372\r\nit was ordained that the blacksmiths should send their work either to\r\n“Graschirche” or to the “Pavement” by St. Nicholas Fleshambles, or by\r\nthe Tun on Cornhill, and should stand by their work openly. Therefore\r\nthe market here was not confined to hay and corn. In 1386 one Thomas\r\nStokes was in trouble for pretending to be an officer and taker of ale\r\nfor the household of the King, under which pretence he marked with an\r\narrowhead several barrels in the brewery of William Roke of Graschirche.\r\nThere was therefore a brewery in the market. One finds so many breweries\r\nscattered about the City that one asks how they got the water; it must\r\ncertainly have been drawn up from a local well. Another case of\r\npersonating an officer of the King was that of William Redhede in 1417,\r\nwho tried to carry off certain bushels of wheat at Graschirche\r\npretending that they were for the King. He was clapped into prison and\r\nthen put in pillory. “Upon the three market days ensuing he was to be\r\ntaken each day from the Prison of Newgate to the Market called ‘le\r\nCornmarket’ opposite to the Friars Minors and there the cause of the\r\njudgment aforesaid was to be proclaimed: and after that he was to be\r\ntaken through the middle of the high street of Chepe to the Pillory on\r\nCornhille; and upon that he was to be placed on each of those three days\r\nthere to stand for one hour each day, the reason of his sentence being\r\nthen and there proclaimed, and after that he was to be taken from thence\r\nthrough the middle of the high street of Cornhill to the Market of\r\nGraschirche aforesaid, where like proclamation was to be made: and from\r\nthence back to prison.”\r\n\r\nRoman remains, such as vases, bronzes, coffins, have been found in this\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nIn 1654 Brethmer, citizen of London, gave to the Church at Canterbury\r\nhis messuage at “Gerscherche” as also the Church of Allhallows, Lombard\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe street is continually mentioned in connection with tenements,\r\nmessuages, houses, and rents.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times Richard Tarleton the actor lived in Gracechurch\r\nStreet, at the sign of the Saber. Probably he acted in the courtyard of\r\nthe Cross Keys in the same street, licensed in 1570, but only for that\r\nyear. Many pageants and processions were conducted through Gracechurch\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nIn Gracechurch Street at the corner of Fenchurch Street was St. Benet’s\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n  =St. Benet, Grasschurch=, was so called after St. Benedict. The date\r\n  of its foundation is unknown. It was burnt down in the Great Fire,\r\n  rebuilt and finished in 1685. In 1868 the building was pulled down,\r\n  and in 1869 and 1870 the site was occupied by offices. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1170.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s, who granted it about 1142 to Algarus the priest, for\r\n  his life.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 223.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here in the chapel of St. Mary and St.\r\n  Katherine for Lady Joan Rose; the endowment fetched £14 : 3 : 4 in\r\n  1548.\r\n\r\n  Few notable monuments in this church are recorded by Stow. It\r\n  originally contained Queen Elizabeth’s monument. The parish was rich\r\n  in charitable gifts, some of the donors of which were: Mrs. Doxie of\r\n  £50, for the better maintenance of the parson; Lady Elizabeth Newton\r\n  £40, and many others whose names are not recorded.\r\n\r\nIn modern Gracechurch Street, at the corner of Eastcheap, is a fine new\r\nbuilding of the National Provident Institution for Mutual Life\r\nAssurance. The courts opening out of the street are lined with countless\r\nwindow reflectors and are very monotonous. The Russian Bank is fine and\r\nof great height; on the west there is a long line of brick and stucco\r\nbuildings which can boast no style at all. The street is given over to\r\nmerchants, solicitors, bankers, agents, etc. The great building at the\r\ncorner of Lombard Street is the City Linen Company Bank, and is\r\nconspicuous by reason of its stone ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of the street is not remarkable for architectural\r\nbeauty. The street consists chiefly of great square blocks of buildings\r\ninterspersed with dull early nineteenth-century brick boxes. In Bell\r\nYard there is an almost unbroken line of old houses on the south side,\r\nand at the end the half-embedded gilt bell over a public-house points to\r\nthe name-derivation. On the east of Gracechurch Street a high arch of\r\nrusticated stone leads to Leadenhall market (see p. 160). Gracechurch\r\nBuildings follow, and Bull’s Head Passage, leading to Skinner’s Place,\r\nis lined by open stalls. The flat end of St. Peter’s, Cornhill, faces\r\nLeadenhall Buildings.\r\n\r\n=Lombard Street.=—Shops and tenements are mentioned belonging to Lombard\r\nStreet in the fourteenth century. The _Calendar of Wills_ has a\r\nreference in the year 1327. Riley’s earliest reference is 1382.\r\n\r\nWhen the street first received its name is not known. Stow ventures back\r\nno further than Edward II., but there were Italian merchants before that\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n“Then have ye Lombard Street, so called of the Longobards, and other\r\nmerchants, strangers of divers nations assembling there twice every day,\r\nof what original or continuance I have not read of record, more than\r\nthat Edward II., in the 12th of his reign, confirmed a messuage,\r\nsometime belonging to Robert Turke, abutting on Lombard Street, toward\r\nthe south, and toward Cornehill on the north, for the merchants of\r\nFlorence, which proveth that street to have had the name of Lombard\r\nStreet before the reign of Edward II. The meeting of which merchants and\r\nothers there continued until the 22nd of December, in the year 1568; on\r\nthe which day the said merchants began to make their meetings at the\r\nburse, a place then new built for that purpose in the ward of Cornhill,\r\nand was since by her majesty, Queen Elizabeth, named the Royal\r\nExchange.”\r\n\r\nThe Lombards came over at first as collectors of the papal revenue; but\r\nthey did much more than this: they opened up trade between the Italian\r\ntowns and London—every year the fleets of Genoa and Venice brought goods\r\nfrom the East and from the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Italians in\r\nEngland sent wool from England instead of precious metals by way of\r\nFlorence, if not other cities. Their wealth enabled them to take the\r\nplace of the Jews in their expulsion; if the City was suddenly and\r\nheavily taxed they made advances to the merchant who could not\r\nimmediately realise. Of course they charged heavy interest—as heavy as\r\nthe necessities of the case permitted—and they became unpopular. The\r\nlending of money, forbidden and held in abhorrence, was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the conduct of business: those who carried on this trade\r\nnaturally lived together, if only to be kept in knowledge of what was\r\ngoing on. And as the progress of trade went on, their power increased\r\nyear by year. Lombard Street, where they lived, was the daily mart of\r\nthe London merchants before the erection of the Exchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POPE’S HOUSE IN PLOUGH COURT\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Jane Shore’s husband was a goldsmith in this street; so at least the\r\nold ballad, printed in Percy’s _Reliques_, would lead us to believe. No.\r\n68, now Messrs. Martin, Stones and Martin’s (bankers), occupies the site\r\nof the house of business of Sir Thomas Gresham, founder of the Royal\r\nExchange. When Pennant wrote, the Messrs. Martin still possessed the\r\noriginal grasshopper that distinguished his house. ‘How the Exchange\r\npasseth in Lombard Street’ is a phrase of frequent occurrence in Sir\r\nThomas Gresham’s early letters. No. 67, now in the occupation of Messrs.\r\nGlyn and Co. (bankers), belongs to the Goldsmiths’ Company, to whom it\r\nwas left by Sir Martin Bowes, an eminent goldsmith in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth. Guy, the founder of Guy’s Hospital, was a bookseller in this\r\nstreet. The father of Pope, the poet, was a linendraper in Lombard\r\nStreet; and here, in 1688, his celebrated son was born. Opposite the\r\nold-fashioned gate of the Church of St. Edmund the Martyr is a narrow\r\ncourt, leading to a Quakers’ Meeting-house where Penn and Fox frequently\r\npreached” (Cunningham’s _Handbook_).\r\n\r\nThe house in which Pope is said to have been born is that at the end of\r\nPlough Court.\r\n\r\nBetween the Church of St. Edmund and the west end of the street were two\r\nmansions formerly belonging, one to William de la Pole, Knight Banneret,\r\nand “King’s Merchant” in the reign of Edward III., and afterwards to his\r\nson, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, and the other to Sir Martin\r\nBowes, mayor, 1545. Here also was the Cardinal’s Hat Tavern, one of the\r\noldest of the City taverns, mentioned in 1492.\r\n\r\nThe modern street gives a general impression similar to that of\r\nCornhill. Everywhere we are confronted by solid banks and insurance\r\noffices, which seem to divide the ground between them.\r\n\r\nGeorge Yard contains the imposing building of the Deutsche Bank in\r\nLondon, as well as a couple of large houses let in flats, and presents a\r\ndecidedly dignified appearance. The Bank is an immense building, with a\r\ngranite-columned portico, and rusticated stonework round it.\r\n\r\nOf the two churches now remaining in this street, one is\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. EDMUND, KING AND MARTYR\r\n\r\n  This church was anciently called by some St. Edmund Grass-Church,\r\n  because of its proximity to the grass market. It was burnt down in\r\n  the Great Fire and rebuilt by Wren in 1690. In 1864 and 1880 the\r\n  church was restored. After the Great Fire, the parish of St.\r\n  Nicholas Acon was annexed. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1150.\r\n\r\n  The patronage was in the hands of the Prior and Convent of Holy\r\n  Trinity, London, but Henry VIII. seized it and granted it to the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury in 1545, in whose successors it continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 240.\r\n\r\n  The present church measures 59 feet in length, 40 feet in breadth,\r\n  and 57 feet 9 inches in height. It is singular from its standing\r\n  north and south, but this was forced upon Wren by the position of\r\n  the ground at his disposal. There are no aisles. The steeple, which\r\n  rises at the south, consists of a three-storied tower and octagonal\r\n  lantern and spire, and a pedestal supporting a finial and vane. The\r\n  lantern is ornamented at the angles by flaming urns, in allusion to\r\n  the Great Fire. A projecting clock is attached to the face of the\r\n  second story and is a prominent feature in Lombard Street. The total\r\n  height is 136 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Thomas Wyllys for himself and\r\n  Christian his wife, whose endowment fetched £24 in 1548, when\r\n  Richard Auncell was chaplain; by and for Matilda at Vane, relict of\r\n  John Atte Rose, dedicated to SS. John, Peter, and Thomas the martyr,\r\n  to which John Reynes was admitted chaplain on the resignation of\r\n  William Belgrave, September 25, 1382; by Richard Toky for himself\r\n  and Matilda his wife, to which William Howes de Blackolm was\r\n  admitted chaplain, October 20, 1362; by John Longe, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £35 in 1548, when William Myller and Edward Mamyn or Hamonde\r\n  were chaplains.\r\n\r\n  The old church contained a monument to John Shute, a\r\n  painter-stainer, who wrote one of the earliest English works on\r\n  Architecture. He died in 1563. On the east wall a monument\r\n  commemorates Dr. Jeremiah Milles, Dean of Exeter, President of the\r\n  Society of Antiquaries, and rector of the united parishes, who died\r\n  in 1784.\r\n\r\n  Addison was married in this church to the Dowager Countess of\r\n  Warwick and Holland in 1716.\r\n\r\n  This parish was not rich in charitable gifts. Some of the donors\r\n  were: Richard Jaie of 45s. for bread, etc., for the poor; Mrs. Joan\r\n  Lowen of 52s.; Mrs. Anne Whitmore, £5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ALLHALLOWS, LOMBARD STREET\r\n\r\n  This church went by the name of Allhallows “Grasse Church” from its\r\n  proximity to the grass and hay market. It was consumed by the Great\r\n  Fire, but subsequently rebuilt and completed by Wren in 1694. The\r\n  parish of Allhallows was one of the thirteen “Peculiars” of the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury in the City of London. The earliest date of\r\n  an incumbent is 1279.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Brihterus, citizen\r\n  of London, who in 1052 gave it to the Prior and Convent of Christ\r\n  Church, Canterbury; the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, in whose\r\n  successors it continued, who first presented to it in 1552.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  The interior of the church is constructed on a rectangular plan,\r\n  without aisles, and with only one pillar, rising at the centre of\r\n  the west gallery. It is 84 feet in length, 52 feet in breadth, and\r\n  the height 30 feet. The church contains much good woodwork, the\r\n  carved oak altar-piece being especially fine. The stone tower, which\r\n  rises at the south-west, is divided into three stories, the lowest\r\n  of which has a large doorway at its south face; the second is\r\n  pierced by a circular-headed window, and the third by square\r\n  openings with louvres, each surmounted by a cornice. The height of\r\n  the tower is about 85 feet. The church is entered by a porch and\r\n  vestibule through a doorway in the tower.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were here founded by: John Chircheman, citizen, and\r\n  Richard Tasburgh, late parson of Heylesdon County, Norfolk, July 15,\r\n  1392 (Pat. 16 Richard II. p. i. m. 25); John Buck, whose endowment\r\n  yielded £40 : 6s. in 1548; John Maldon, whose endowment yielded\r\n  £20 : 3 : 4 in 1548, when Edward Hollonde was priest; William\r\n  Trystor, who endowed it with £6 : 6 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The most notable of the monuments in this church is to the memory of\r\n  Simon Horsepoole, Sheriff of London in 1591.\r\n\r\n  The sole donor of charities seems to have been this same Simon\r\n  Horsepoole, who appointed to this parish £4 : 4s. per annum.\r\n\r\n  The original church was indebted for its south aisle, steeple, and\r\n  other sections to John Warner, Robert Warner, and the Pewterers.\r\n\r\n  Clothes were found for forty boys, as well as books, and the boys\r\n  were put out as apprentices by a Society of Langbourn Ward.\r\n\r\n  The most notable rectors were: Robert Gilbert, Bishop of London,\r\n  1436; Thomas Langton (d. 1501), Bishop of St. David’s and Sarum, and\r\n  of Winchester; Francis Dee (d. 1638), Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\nAt the corner formed by the junction of Lombard and King William Streets\r\nstands the Church of\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. MARY WOOLNOTH\r\n\r\n  “The church was founded by Wulfnuth, son of Earl Godwin, about the\r\n  time of the Confessor. This name was corrupted into Woolnoth” (Rev.\r\n  J. M. S. Brooke, Rector). It was rebuilt, according to Newcourt,\r\n  from its very foundations about 1438. Though damaged by the Great\r\n  Fire, it was not destroyed, and Wren repaired and rebuilt various\r\n  parts in 1677. In 1716 the building was pulled down and the present\r\n  church, the work of Nicholas Hawksmoor, was commenced and finished\r\n  in 1727. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1252.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church, before 1252, was in the hands of: The\r\n  Prioress and Convent of St. Helen’s, London; then Henry VIII., who\r\n  seized it and granted it to Sir Martin Bowes, Alderman and Mayor of\r\n  London, whose son and heir, Thomas Bowes, sold it to William Pelham,\r\n  December 19, 1571; Robert Viner Miles, and several other persons,\r\n  the last being Sir George Broke-Middleton, who presented to it in\r\n  1883.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  The interior of the church is almost square. It contains twelve\r\n  Corinthian columns, placed at the angles in groups of three, and\r\n  supporting an entablature prolonged to the walls by means of\r\n  pilasters. There is a clerestory above, pierced on its four sides by\r\n  semicircular windows. The tower, which rises at the west, contains\r\n  the doorway in its basement story; the cornice is surmounted by a\r\n  pedestal supporting composite columns, and the summit is divided\r\n  into two turrets with balustrades above. The north front has three\r\n  niches, each enclosing two Ionic columns on pedestals; the south\r\n  front is plain.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Gregory de Rokeslie, Mayor of\r\n  London, 1275-81, for himself and Amicia his wife, to which John de\r\n  Pory was admitted chaplain, July 15, 1333; Thomas Noket, for himself\r\n  and for Alice, wife of Gregory de Norton, called atte Shire, at the\r\n  Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Anne, in the south side of\r\n  the church, to which William Weston was admitted chaplain, January\r\n  28, 1400-1401; the endowment fetched £13 : 6 : 8 in 1548, when\r\n  William Wentors, or Ventrys, and Richard Browne were chaplains;\r\n  Henry Brige, Knt., whose endowment yielded £13: 13 : 4 in 1548, when\r\n  John Meres was priest.\r\n\r\n  Sir Hugh Brice, keeper of the King’s Exchange under Henry VII., was\r\n  buried in this church; he built a chapel here called the “Channel”;\r\n  also Sir Thomas Ramsey, Lord Mayor in 1577; William Hilton, Merchant\r\n  Taylor and Taylor to Henry VIII., and Sir Martin Bowes, patron of\r\n  the church for over thirty years.\r\n\r\n  Among the later monuments, Stow records one in memory of Sir William\r\n  Phipps, who discovered a sunken Spanish ship in 1687 containing\r\n  silver to the value of £300,000 sterling, and one commemorating Sir\r\n  Thomas Vyner, goldsmith, and Mayor of London, who died in 1665.\r\n\r\n  The list of legacies and bequests was too long for insertion, Stow\r\n  says, but was to be seen by any one in the Parish Book. He records a\r\n  gift of £1 : 6s. per annum from Sir Nicholas Rainton, and one of\r\n  £3 : 15 : 8 paid by the Merchant Taylors.\r\n\r\n  Richard Rawlins (d. 1536), Bishop of St. David’s, was rector here;\r\n  also John Newton, author of “Olney Hymns.”\r\n\r\n=King William Street= contains few associations of interest, having been\r\nbuilt, as its name implies, in the reign of the fourth monarch of that\r\nname, whose statue on a pedestal, which outrivals every other in the\r\nCity on the score of weight alone, stands at the south end. This is the\r\nwork of W. Nixon and was set up in December 1844. The figure is 15 feet\r\n3 inches high, and the whole statue weighs 20 tons. Special arrangements\r\nhad to be made for carrying the Metropolitan Railway beneath it. The\r\nstatue is on the site of the Boar’s Head Tavern, noted in old days as a\r\nfamous rendezvous, and familiar to readers of Shakespeare from\r\nFalstaff’s frequent resort thither. Goldsmith and Washington Irvine have\r\nwritten on the Boar’s Head Tavern, which rose again after the Fire; the\r\nsign of the later house is preserved in the Guildhall Museum.\r\n\r\nKing William Street was cut through various lanes, which are now dealt\r\nwith. At the north end in Gresham Place is Gresham Club, which was built\r\nin 1844; the architect was Henry Flower. It is for merchants and City\r\nmen; the entrance fee is twenty guineas, annual subscription eight\r\nguineas, and the membership is limited to 500. It is a grey stone\r\nbuilding with triangular stone pediments projecting over the upper\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  ST. MARY WOOLNOTH\r\n]\r\n\r\n=St. Clement’s Lane= leads to St. Clement’s Church. I find a reference\r\nto rents in Clement’s Lane in 1322. In 1371 the “good folk” of\r\nCandelwyke Street and Clement’s Lane petitioned the mayor against\r\ncertain plumbers who proposed to melt their lead in a place hard by\r\ncalled the Woodhaugh; they said that the vapours were noxious and even\r\nfatal to human life, that trustworthy people would depose to the\r\nmischief caused by inhaling these fumes, and that the shaft of the\r\nfurnace was too low. In the end the plumbers were allowed to go on with\r\ntheir work, provided that they raised the shaft. In the lane was the\r\nbank in which Samuel Rogers was a partner.\r\n\r\nIn Church Court, we come to the ancient graveyard of St. Clement, a\r\nminute space with one great shapeless tomb in the centre of the asphalt\r\nand a few small erect tombstones in the little border running inside the\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. CLEMENT, EASTCHEAP\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Clement was destroyed by the Great Fire, but\r\n  rebuilt by Wren in 1686, when St. Martin’s Orgar was annexed to it.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1309.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot and\r\n  Convent of Westminster, 1309; then Henry VIII., who seized it and\r\n  gave it to the Bishop of Westminster in 1540; next the Bishop of\r\n  London, by Mary, March 3, 1553-54, in whose successors it continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 271.\r\n\r\n  The present building measures 64 feet in length, 40 feet in breadth,\r\n  and 34 feet in height. It has one aisle on the south side, separated\r\n  from the rest of the church by two high-based columns. The square\r\n  tower at the south-west is built of brick, with stone dressings, and\r\n  contains three stories, with a cornice and balustrade above. The\r\n  total height is 88 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: by John Chardeney for himself and\r\n  Margaret his wife, to which William Hocchepound was admitted\r\n  chaplain, July 23, 1371, at the Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary;\r\n  for William Ivery.\r\n\r\n  There were very few monuments in this church originally. In the west\r\n  window is a memorial to Thomas Fuller, the church historian, Bishop\r\n  Bryan Walton, and Bishop Pearson. Fuller and Pearson were lecturers\r\n  here for some time; the preaching of Pearson on the Creed and\r\n  Thirty-nine Articles made him famous. Walton, the compiler of the\r\n  Polyglot Bible, was created Bishop of Chester, 1660. The\r\n  stained-glass window on the southern side was erected in 1872 by the\r\n  Clothworkers’ Company in memory of Samuel Middlemore, who died in\r\n  1628, leaving a charitable bequest to the parish. Henry Purcell and\r\n  Jonathan Battishill, the musical composers, who were organists at\r\n  the church, are commemorated by brass tablets.\r\n\r\n  There were several gifts belonging to the parish, but the names of\r\n  the donors are not recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  Sir Thomas Gooch (1674-1754), Bishop of Bristol, of Norwich and of\r\n  Ely, was rector here.\r\n\r\n=St. Nicholas Lane=, also one of the most ancient lanes in London. In\r\n1258 we find that one Ralph was chaplain in the Church of St. Nicholas\r\nAcon. In 1275 the church is endowed with a small rent; in 1279, a\r\ntestator bequeaths his “Stone house” in the lane; and in many subsequent\r\nentries the lane is mentioned. The dedication of the church may possibly\r\nindicate the date of its foundation. It was in the eleventh century that\r\nthe bones of St. Nicholas were brought from Myra in Asia Minor, then in\r\nthe hands of the Mohammedans, to Bari on the Adriatic, where they still\r\nlie. There grew up quite suddenly an extraordinary belief in the power\r\nof this saint. Pilgrimages were instituted, in which thousands flocked\r\nto his tomb; miracles were multiplied at the sacred spot; the churches\r\nwithout end were dedicated to his name of Nicholas. In England 372\r\nchurches are said to be named after him. It would be interesting to\r\nlearn the date of this dedication. May we, however, connect this saint\r\nof Italian pilgrimage with the coming of Italian merchants to London?\r\nSt. Nicholas was the protector of sailors, virgins, and children.\r\nCunningham calls him also the protector of merchants, but of merchants\r\nas sailors. His emblem was the three purses, round and filled with gold,\r\nor the three golden balls. We may therefore at least assume that this\r\nwas the church of the “Lombards” and the financiers from Italy. The\r\nchurchyard still remains, a square patch of ground, railed in, very\r\nsimilar to the generality of such quiet little spaces. It has asphalt\r\npaths running in and out of stunted evergreen bushes. Nicholas Passage\r\nruns on the south side, and near is the Acorn public-house, an old\r\nhouse, with its sign of a huge gilt acorn hanging over the door.\r\n\r\n  =St. Nicholas Acon= was situated on the west side of Nicholas Lane,\r\n  near Lombard Street; it was burnt down in the Great Fire, and not\r\n  rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of St. Edmund the King and\r\n  Martyr, and its site turned into a burying-ground. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1250.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of Godwin: and Thurand\r\n  his wife gave it in 1084 to the Abbot and Convent of Malmesbury;\r\n  Henry VIII. seized it, 1542, and so it continued in the Crown up to\r\n  1666, when it was annexed to St. Edmund the King; since then the\r\n  patronage is alternately in the Crown and the Archbishop of\r\n  Canterbury.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 154.\r\n\r\n  Johanna Macany, who left large legacies to the parish about 1452,\r\n  was buried in this church, also John Hall, Master of the Company of\r\n  Drapers; he died in 1618.\r\n\r\n  No legacies or gifts are recorded by Stow except that of Johanna\r\n  Macany, of which he gives full details.\r\n\r\n  Maurice Griffith, Bishop of Rochester in 1554, was rector here.\r\n\r\nOf =Birchin Lane= Stow says it should be Birchover Lane. It is also\r\nspelt Berchernere and Borcherveres Lane. It is frequently mentioned in\r\nthe _Calendar of Wills_. In 1260 there is “land” in the lane; in 1285\r\nthere is a mansion house; there are a bakehouse and shops in 1319; in\r\n1326, a tenement; twenty years later, other tenements; in 1358, a place\r\ncalled “la Belle”; in 1363, lands and a tenement; and in 1372, tenements\r\nin “Berchers” Lane. In 1386 and the following century we have it spelled\r\nBirchin Lane. In 1348, Riley quotes the name as Bercherners Lane.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the lane was inhabited by\r\n“fripperers,” _i.e._ old-clothes men. Here was Tom’s Coffee-house,\r\nfrequented by Garrick. Chatterton wrote a letter to his sister from this\r\nhouse. In a court leading out of Birchin Lane is the George and Vulture,\r\na well-known tavern, which still preserves the custom of serving chops\r\nand steaks on pewter.\r\n\r\n=Abchurch Lane= gives its name to the church of St. Mary Abchurch,\r\nwhich, according to Stow, is also Upchurch (see below). The parish of\r\nAbchurch or Abbechurch is mentioned as early as 1272 and 1282, and\r\ntenements in Abbechurch Lane are devised by a testator of the year 1297.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. MARY ABCHURCH\r\n\r\n  The additional name signifies “Up-church,” and is accounted for by\r\n  the position of the edifice on rising ground. The church was burnt\r\n  down by the Great Fire and rebuilt in 1686 from the designs of Sir\r\n  Christopher Wren, when the parish of St. Lawrence Pountney was\r\n  annexed. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1323.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency_.\r\n\r\n  ALTAR OF ST. MARY ABCHURCH\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior and\r\n  Convent of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, who exchanged it to the Master\r\n  and Wardens of Corpus Christi College near St. Lawrence Pountney,\r\n  1448; Henry VIII., who seized it in 1540, and so continued in the\r\n  Crown till Elizabeth, in 1568, granted it to Corpus Christi College,\r\n  Cambridge, with whom it continued. Elizabeth’s grant was procured by\r\n  Archbishop Parker, who gave her the rectory of Penshurst in Kent, in\r\n  order that he might make over the patronage of a London living to\r\n  his old college.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 368.\r\n\r\n  The church is almost square, measuring 63 feet in length and 60 feet\r\n  in breadth, and is surmounted by a cupola 51 feet in height\r\n  supported by pendentives attached to the walls; the latter is\r\n  decorated with painting by Sir James Thornhill. The altar-piece is\r\n  adorned with carving, which is considered to be some of Gibbon’s\r\n  finest work. The steeple consists of a tower of four stories,\r\n  finished by a cornice, and surmounted by a cupola, lantern, and\r\n  lead-covered spire, with ball and cross; the total height is about\r\n  140 feet. The building is of red brick with Portland stone\r\n  dressings.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By and for Simon de Wynchecombe,\r\n  citizen and armourer, in the chapel of Holy Trinity, to which Robert\r\n  de Bruysor Chesterson was admitted, November 18, 1401—a licence was\r\n  granted by the King to found this, July 26, 1359; by John Lyttelton;\r\n  by Simon Wryght.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained monuments to Sir James Hawes and Sir\r\n  John Branch, mayors in 1574 and 1580; and to Master Roger Mountague,\r\n  “illustrious Precedent of Bounty and pious Industry.” Against the\r\n  eastern wall, there is a large monument to Sir Patience Ward, mayor\r\n  in 1680, and senior member for the City of London in the Convention\r\n  Parliament of 1688-89.\r\n\r\n  The parish had no legacies or charitable gifts of any considerable\r\n  amount. Mrs. Hyde gave £3 : 18s. for bread. The Merchant Taylors\r\n  Company (the gift of several benefactors) gave £16 : 19 : 6 for\r\n  coal.\r\n\r\n=Sherborne Lane.=—Stow asserts that originally Langbourn Water,\r\n“breaking out of the ground in Fenchurch Street, ran down the same\r\nstreet, Lombard Street, to the west end of St. Mary Woolnoth’s church,\r\nwhere, turning south and breaking into small shares, rills, or streams,\r\nit left the name of Share-borne Lane,” or as he had also read it,\r\nSouth-borne Lane, “because it ran south to the river Thames.” Wheatley\r\nthinks that _Scrieburne_, from _scir_, a share (_sciran_, to divide), is\r\nthe more likely etymology. This “long bourne of sweet water,” Stow\r\nfurther relates, “is long since stopped up at the head, and the rest of\r\nthe course filled up and paved over, so that no sign thereof remaineth\r\nmore than the names.” The existence of the stream indeed is more than\r\nproblematical. The lane is narrow, and now occupied wholly by business\r\npremises more or less modern. The back of the City Carlton Club shows on\r\nthe west side, and near the north end is the narrow way into St.\r\nSwithin’s Lane at the south end of the street (possibly Plough Alley);\r\nand the back way into the old General Post Office “by the sign of the\r\nCock” (east side, north end), both shown in Strype’s 1754 map, have\r\nvanished. The former is built up; the latter is occupied by King William\r\nStreet, which was cut clean through St. Mary Woolnoth’s churchyard and\r\nthe old General Post Office (formerly the residence of Sir Robert Vyner,\r\nLord Mayor, 1675). Before the Fire the General Postmaster lived “at his\r\nhouse in Sherburne Lane neere Abchurch,” and hither “_The Carriers’\r\nCosmographie_, by John Taylor, the Water Poet,” written in 1637, bids\r\nrepair all who desired to send letters abroad or to various parts of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe name occurs as early as A.D. 1300, and is very frequently referred\r\nto in the _Calendar of Wills_, but under quite another form, viz. as\r\n“Shiteburn Lane.” Stow’s derivation of “Sharebone” or “Southbone” Lane\r\nwill not, therefore, hold.\r\n\r\n=St. Swithin’s Lane.=—Oxford Court in this lane was so called from John\r\nde Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, who died here in 1562.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1277 we find houses in St. Swithin’s Lane. In 1310 we find\r\nturners of St. Swithin’s Lane.\r\n\r\nThe houses are of modern brick and stone, some of them are finished with\r\npolished granite piers. The great richly wrought iron gates before the\r\ncourtyard of Salters’ Hall immediately attract attention. The hall\r\nitself, built in 1823, is painted and stuccoed, and has a fine Ionic\r\nportico. Salters’ Hall was used as a Presbyterian chapel in the reign of\r\nWilliam III.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SALTERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The first evidence of the existence of the Company is a Patent Roll\r\n  of 17 Richard II., 1394; but from documents in their possession,\r\n  there is every reason to believe that the Company had a much earlier\r\n  existence.\r\n\r\n  In 1454 Thomas Beamond, citizen and salter (at one time sheriff in\r\n  London), left to the wardens of the brotherhood and guild of the\r\n  Body of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Church of All Saints, Bread\r\n  Street, London, and their successors for ever, land in Bread Street,\r\n  whereon had recently been erected the “Salters’ Hall,” together with\r\n  other property, out of the rents and profits of which he directed\r\n  that the hall should be repaired or rebuilt as occasion might\r\n  require. This will also gave directions for certain religious\r\n  observances, and for the support of poor Salters in almshouses, etc.\r\n\r\n  At some time subsequently to 1454 an attempt was made to prove that\r\n  the religious guild and the Company of Salters were distinct\r\n  corporations, and that Mr. Beamond intended to bequeath the property\r\n  mentioned in his will to the spiritual body exclusively, but the\r\n  legal decision was that the religious guild and the Salters Company\r\n  were identical.\r\n\r\n  In the reign of Edward IV., 1465, ordinances were made for the good\r\n  government of the “Company of Salters”; and in a suit presented by\r\n  Lord Arundel against the Company (about the same time) it was proved\r\n  that the Company of Salters and the guild or fraternity mentioned in\r\n  the Patent Roll of Richard II. were identical corporations.\r\n\r\n  1507.—Ordinances were confirmed by the Lord Chancellor, the Lord\r\n  Treasurer, and the two Lord Chief Justices, to the wardens and\r\n  fellowship of the mystery and craft of Salters in the City of\r\n  London, and keepers of the fraternity of Corpus Christi in the\r\n  Church of Allhallows, Bread Street.\r\n\r\n  1530.—Arms were granted to the Company by Thomas Benolt,\r\n  Clarencieux. This deed of grant is in the Company’s possession.\r\n\r\n  1539.—The hall in Bread Street was burnt down, and rebuilt by the\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  1551.—In consideration of a large payment made by them King Edward\r\n  VI. reconveyed to the Company of Salters the whole of the annual\r\n  payments issuing out of their property in respect of superstitious\r\n  uses, which had been held forfeited to the Crown at the time of the\r\n  abolition of chantries in the reign of Henry VIII. (1545).\r\n\r\n  1559.—First charter of incorporation granted by Queen Elizabeth to\r\n  the “Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the art or mystery of\r\n  Salters, London.” About the same time some new ordinances were drawn\r\n  up and doubtless sanctioned by the proper authorities, which make\r\n  provision for the government of the guild, and prescribe oaths for\r\n  its various members and officers; and also conferred the right of\r\n  search in the premises of persons using the art or mystery of\r\n  Salters in the City of London and suburbs thereof, for unwholesome\r\n  merchandise and false weights and measures.\r\n\r\n  1607-1609.—Acts of Parliament passed in the reign of James I.,\r\n  confirming to the Company all their property.\r\n\r\n  In these years a fresh charter and statutes were granted by the\r\n  King.\r\n\r\n  1613 to 1619.—The Company’s Irish estate was acquired by payment to\r\n  the Crown of the sum of £5000 (being the twelfth part of £60,000\r\n  raised by the twelve chief companies) with the object of planting an\r\n  English and Scotch Protestant colony there.\r\n\r\n  1641.—Oxford House (with gardens), which formerly stood on the\r\n  present site of the Company’s hall and offices, was purchased with\r\n  corporate funds of the Company, and used as their hall: this was the\r\n  third, that left by Mr. Beamond (1454) having been destroyed by fire\r\n  and rebuilt about 1539.\r\n\r\n  1666.—The whole of the Company’s estate in London and the greater\r\n  part of their archives were destroyed by the “great fire,” whereby\r\n  heavy losses were entailed on them.\r\n\r\n  1684, 1685.—King James II. granted the Company another charter, but\r\n  the whole of these proceedings were rendered void by an Act passed\r\n  in the following reign, William and Mary, under which the Salters\r\n  Company, amongst others, were restored to their ancient rights,\r\n  privileges, and franchises.\r\n\r\n  1821, 1827.—The hall of the Company, erected after the Fire in 1666,\r\n  was taken down, and the existing building was erected, being the\r\n  fifth hall of the Company.\r\n\r\n  The application of salt to the preservation of food, and\r\n  particularly of fish for consumption in winter, must have given rise\r\n  to a distinct trade for that purpose in the earliest times; and, as\r\n  civilization advanced, the term “Salter” no doubt became more\r\n  extended in its commercial interpretation, until it included, as in\r\n  the present day, all persons trading wholly or partially in salt,\r\n  such as oilmen, drysalters, and druggists.\r\n\r\n  Salt manufacturers and merchants, oilmen, druggists, and grocers\r\n  (who made salt one of their trading commodities) have been and are\r\n  largely represented on the guild.\r\n\r\n  The number of liverymen is given as 183; the Corporate Income is\r\n  £20,000; the Trust Income is £2000.\r\n\r\n  The only advantage incident to the position of a freeman is a claim\r\n  for relief, if in pecuniary distress.\r\n\r\n  Liverymen are entitled to vote at the election for the office of\r\n  renter warden, of assistant, of master and of wardens; and, if free\r\n  of the City of London, for candidates for the office of Lord Mayor,\r\n  and for some officers of the corporation; also, if free of the City,\r\n  and resident within a radius of twenty-five miles, for members of\r\n  Parliament for the said City. All liverymen not in receipt of\r\n  pecuniary assistance are invited to entertainments of the Company,\r\n  and have a claim for relief should they fall into misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe present Salters’ Hall and garden, with some adjoining land, occupies\r\nthe site of the “fair and large built house” which Sir Robert Aguylum\r\ndevised in 1285-86 to the priors of Tortington in Sussex for their town\r\ninn or mansion. The Dissolution brought it to the Crown, and Henry\r\nVIII., in 1540, gave it to John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Then it became\r\nknown as Oxford Place or House. Mary probably restored it; at all events\r\nElizabeth regranted it in 1573 to the Earldom of Oxford, then held by\r\nEdward, grandson of John de Vere above named. The new tenant apparently\r\nresided here in good style. Stow quaintly tells of his pomp. “He hath\r\nbeen noted within these forty years to have ridden into this City, and\r\nso to his house by London Stone, with 80 gentlemen in a livery of\r\nReading tawny, and chains of gold about their necks, before him, and one\r\nhundred tall yeomen in the like livery to follow him, without chains but\r\nall having his cognisance of the blue boat embroidered on their left\r\nshoulder.” He appears not to have remained here long, for Sir Ambrose\r\nNicholas, salter, kept his mayoralty here in 1575, and Sir John Hart\r\ndwelt here as Lord Mayor in 1589. Hart bought the place from the Earl,\r\nwho was then dissipating his great estates from motives of pique and\r\nindignation against his father-in-law, Cecil, Lord Burleigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. H. Shepherd_.\r\n\r\n  SALTERS’ HALL, 1822\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe house was sold to the feofees of the Salters Company in 1641. The\r\nGreat Fire of 1666 probably destroyed only a part of the great house\r\n(Wilkinson in _Londina Illustrata_ goes too far in maintaining that the\r\nbuilding wholly escaped, but is probably nearer right than those who say\r\nit was quite destroyed), statements to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nfor, at the request of the Bishop of London, the parishioners of St.\r\nSwithin’s assembled in the long parlour for worship whilst their church\r\nwas building, and several of the companies held their courts here until\r\ntheir halls had risen from the ashes. The destroyed portion, perhaps\r\nindeed the whole, and the wall of the great garden, and some adjoining\r\nhouses, were rebuilt about this time by the Company and their tenants.\r\nThe history of the Salters’ Hall has already been told.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 a congregation of “protestant dissenters” took from the Company,\r\non moderate terms, a lease of certain ground on which part of Oxford\r\nHouse had stood before the Fire. Here they built their meeting-house,\r\nwhere Mr. Mayo preached until his death in 1695, drawing, by his\r\neloquence, congregations so large that it is said even the windows were\r\ncrowded when he preached. William Long, writer for Matthew Henry’s\r\n_Commentary_, was minister in 1702. In 1716 he and Mr. John Newman,\r\npopular with the congregation, became co-pastors. In 1719 the general\r\nbody of dissenting ministers met here to discuss means for stopping the\r\nspread of Arianism. “You that are against subscribing to a declaration\r\nas a test of orthodoxy, come upstairs,” cried the Arians and the\r\nprivate-judgment men of a stormy synod. “And you that are for declaring\r\nyour faith in the doctrine of the Trinity, stay below,” replied Mr.\r\nBradbury of New Court. A count showed fifty-seven to have gone up, and\r\nfifty-three to have remained down, giving the “scandalous majority” of\r\nfour. Arianism meanwhile had become the coffee-house topic of the town.\r\nIn March 1726 Long died, and Newman became sole pastor till his death in\r\n1741. In the reign of William III., Robert Bragge started a “Lord’s Day\r\nevening lecture,” popular for many years, but afterwards removed by the\r\noriginator to his meeting-house in Lime Street. The celebrated Thomas\r\nBradbury shortly afterwards revived it at Salters’ Hall Chapel, and for\r\nmore than twenty years delivered it to crowded audiences. Samuel Baker\r\ncontinued it on Bradbury’s resignation in 1725. Presbyterians of some\r\neminence followed him, as Dr. William Prior, Dr. Abraham Rees, Dr.\r\nPhilip Furneaux, and Hugh Farmer (1761), the writer of an exposition on\r\ndemonology and miracles, which aroused sharp controversy. When the\r\nSalters determined to rebuild their hall, they gave the congregation\r\nnotice to quit by Lady Day 1821. Whereupon the congregation acquired\r\npremises in Oxford Court, upon the site of which they erected a handsome\r\nnew meeting-house completed in 1822. But the glory of the place as a\r\ndissenting centre was departing, and the Presbyterians abandoned it.\r\nThen came some erratic fanatics who called themselves “The Christian\r\nEvidence Society,” and their meeting-house was “Areopagus.” Their leader\r\nwent bankrupt and the experiment collapsed. In 1827 the Baptists\r\nreopened the place, and remained there for some years, but, shortly\r\nbefore 1870, removed to Islington, where to this day the “Salters’ Hall”\r\nChapel in the Baxter Road preserves the memory of the struggles,\r\nquarrels, and triumphs of the old City meeting-house. In Tom Brown’s\r\n_Laconics_ (1709) is this allusion: “A man that keeps steady to one\r\nparty, though he happens to be in the wrong, is still an honest man. He\r\nthat goes to a Cathedral in the morning, and Salters’ Hall in the\r\nafternoon, is a rascal by his own confession.”\r\n\r\nIn _Hudibras Redivivus_ (1706) this is found:\r\n\r\n               I thumb’d o’er many factious Reams,\r\n               Of canting Lies, and Poets’ Dreams,\r\n               All stuffed as full of Low-Church Manners,\r\n               As e’er was Salters’ Hall with Sinners.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of St. Swithin’s Lane is Founders’ Hall. The hall is\r\non the first floor, and there are shops below. The building is of stone\r\nwith pilasters running up the front, and the coat-of-arms is over the\r\ndoor, which has a very projecting cornice. The hall was rebuilt 1877. On\r\nthe north side of Salters’ Hall is New Court showing through behind a\r\ncovered entry. The opposite side of St. Swithin’s Lane seems to contain\r\nthe offices of an absolutely unlimited number of companies. The court,\r\nopening out of it, consists of uninteresting earth brick houses shut in\r\nby an iron gate. The City Carlton Club is in Nos. 28 and 29. It is a\r\nConservative Club, with fifteen-guinea entrance fee, and eight-guinea\r\nsubscription. The building is of stone with a porch over the door. There\r\nare bay windows with polished granite columns. Richard Roberts was the\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FOUNDERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Founders Company existed as a “Mistery” prior to the year 1365,\r\n  as appears from a petition to the City of London from the “Good Men\r\n  of the Mistery of the Founders of the City of London.” This petition\r\n  is to be found in the Letter Books at Guildhall, and the entry is\r\n  also evidence that ordinances were granted on the 29th July, 39\r\n  Edward III. The Company possesses no copy of these ordinances.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1389 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 512), certain “good folks\r\n  of the trade of Founders” made plaint to the mayor and aldermen as\r\n  to the bad work put into candlesticks, stirrups, buckles, and other\r\n  things, and they prayed that certain ordinances which they submitted\r\n  should be accepted by the mayor and made law. Among these ordinances\r\n  was one to the effect that two or three masters should be chosen and\r\n  sworn to guard and oversee the trade.\r\n\r\n  In Williams’ _History_ of this Company (1867) he gives the above\r\n  petition word for word under the date of 1365. It is certain from\r\n  this document, as with many other Companies, that as yet the\r\n  Fraternity of Founders had no power or authority to enforce good\r\n  work on pains and penalties.\r\n\r\n  They were incorporated January 1, 1614, for a master, 2 wardens, 15\r\n  assistants, and 100 liverymen. At present the number of the livery\r\n  is 79; their Corporate Income is £1855; their Trust Income is £102;\r\n  and their Hall is in St. Swithin’s Lane. The original home of the\r\n  Founders was that part of London north of Lothbury.\r\n\r\n  The name of Founders’ Court marks the site; this was formerly the\r\n  lane which led through the Company’s buildings to a garden beyond;\r\n  the buildings stretched from St. Margaret Street to Coleman Street,\r\n  Moorgate Street not then existing. This hall was burnt down in the\r\n  Great Fire and rebuilt. The Company let off portions of their hall,\r\n  and in 1853 let the whole on a long lease and bought a house in St.\r\n  Swithin’s Lane, on the site of which they built their present hall\r\n  in 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. SWITHIN’S CHURCH\r\n\r\n  St. Swithin, to whom this church is dedicated, was Bishop of\r\n  Winchester and Chancellor to King Egbert. Formerly the usual\r\n  designation of the church was St. Swithin’s in Candlewick Street,\r\n  but Newcourt (1708) states that St. Swithin, London Stone, was\r\n  becoming the more common title. The stone at that time stood on the\r\n  south side of the road opposite to the church. No record exists of\r\n  the original foundation of the church. Probably it was built soon\r\n  after the death of St. Swithin in 862, or at any rate before A.D.\r\n  1000. It is mentioned in the taxation book of Pope Nicholas IV. in\r\n  1291. The first rector given by Newcourt is Robert de Galdeford, who\r\n  resigned in 1331. In 1420 licence was obtained to rebuild and\r\n  enlarge the church and steeple, and Sir John Hend, Lord Mayor, 1391\r\n  and 1404, was, says Stow, “an especial benefactor thereunto, as\r\n  appeareth by his arms in the glass windows, even in the tops of\r\n  them.” The hall of the Drapers Company was at that time Sir John\r\n  Hend’s house in St. Swithin’s Lane. The church thus rebuilt\r\n  consisted of a chancel and a nave separated from the north and south\r\n  aisles by pillars. There was a chapel of St. Katherine and St.\r\n  Margaret. From the date of rebuilding it is evident that the style\r\n  of the architecture was Early Decorated. The maps of Aggas (1560)\r\n  and Newcourt (1658) agree in showing a small battlemented church,\r\n  with a square battlemented tower (without spire) at the west end and\r\n  level with the street. In 1607-1608 the church was “fully beautified\r\n  and finished at the cost and charge of the parishioners.” It was\r\n  again repaired shortly before the Great Fire, when £1000 was spent\r\n  upon it. The church was burnt down in the Great Fire, and rebuilt by\r\n  Wren in 1678, when the neighbouring parish of St. Mary Bothaw was\r\n  annexed. In 1869 and 1879 it was entirely “rearranged.”\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Sir Robert Aguylum,\r\n  Knt., who gave it by will dated February 28, 1285, to Richard, Earl\r\n  of Arundel, who has licence from the King to assign it to the Prior\r\n  and Convent of Tortington, June 21, 1367; the Prior and Convent of\r\n  Tortington, Sussex, in whose successors it continued up to 1538,\r\n  when Henry VIII. seized it and granted it June 8, 1536, to John de\r\n  Vere, Earl of Oxford, who sold it, 1561, to John Hart, citizen and\r\n  alderman of London, who gave it to George Bolles (his son-in-law),\r\n  citizen of London, from whose descendants it was purchased about\r\n  1683; the Salters Company, in whose successors it continued up to\r\n  1666, when the parish of St. Mary Bothaw was annexed, and the\r\n  patronage shared alternately with the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  Canterbury; Elizabeth Beachcroft presented to it in 1765, the\r\n  Salters Company having parted with their share of the patronage.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 320.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 61 feet in length, 42 feet in breadth, and 41\r\n  feet in height. It is surmounted by an octagonal cupola, divided by\r\n  bands, and powdered with stars on a blue ground. The tower, which\r\n  rises at the north-west, is square but contracted at the top into an\r\n  octagonal shape. Above this a simple spire rises with a ball and\r\n  vane. The total height is 150 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Roger de Depham at the Altar of SS.\r\n  Katherine and Margaret, to which William de Kyrkeby was presented,\r\n  November 5, 1361—in 1548 the mayor and commonalty of London paid to\r\n  carry out the object of Roger de Depham’s will, £5 : 6 : 8; by\r\n  William Newe, who endowed it with lands, etc., which fetched £17 :\r\n  8 : 4, when John Hudson was priest; by James de Sancto Edmund, who\r\n  left five marks per annum for an endowment in 1312; by Geoffrey\r\n  Chittick, who gave lands to endow it which fetched £13 : 6 : 8 in\r\n  1548, when Sir Roger Butte was priest; by John Betson, who endowed\r\n  it with all his lands in this parish, which yielded £13 : 6 : 8 in\r\n  1548, when Richard Hudson was priest.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Hart and Sir George Bolles, patrons of the church, were\r\n  both buried here, but their monuments perished in the Great Fire.\r\n  There is a large tablet affixed to a column on the north side of the\r\n  church commemorating Michael Godfrey, first deputy governor of the\r\n  Bank of England; he was slain in 1695 by a cannon ball at Namur,\r\n  whither he was sent on business to King William’s camp.\r\n\r\n  In 1663 Dryden was married here to Lady Elizabeth Howard.\r\n\r\n  Only two charities are recorded by Stow: 12d. per week in bread,\r\n  50s. per annum in coals for the poor, the gift of Henry Hobener;\r\n  £10 : 10s. for a weekly lecture, the gift of Thomas Wetnal.\r\n\r\nThe parish churchyard is situated in Salters’ Hall Court, by which it is\r\nseparated from the church. It is elevated above the court and contains\r\ntwo trees, two or three bushes and shrubs, and a few tombstones. Across\r\nit is a right-of-way to the premises of the National Telephone Company,\r\nto which it has the appearance of being a garden.\r\n\r\n=George Street= was anciently Bearbinder Lane. Riley notes\r\n“Berbynderslane” in the City records so early as 1358. It was renamed\r\nGeorge Street within the nineteenth century. If Charlotte Row, west of\r\nthe Mansion House, was so called in honour of Queen Charlotte, surely\r\nthis was rechristened in honour of George III., whom she married in\r\n1761. It is quite small compared with its former extent, for it once ran\r\nfrom Walbrook past the south side of St. Mary Woolchurch into St.\r\nSwithin’s Lane, and also had a northern limb, passing the west end of\r\nDove Court, into Lombard Street. Now the Mansion House stands upon all\r\nthe old course west of Walbrook churchyard, and the northern limb is\r\nbuilt over. This was the fatal spot where the plague of 1665 first made\r\nits appearance within the City. Defoe, in his history of the dire\r\ndisease, relates how a Frenchman living in Long Acre, near the\r\nplague-stricken houses, moved hither “for fear of the distemper.” Alas!\r\nhe was already stricken, and in the beginning of May he died, the first\r\nvictim within the City walls. Strype calls Bearbinder Lane “a place of\r\nno great account as to trade: well inhabited by merchants and others.”\r\nIn his time about thirty yards at the east end were reckoned in\r\nLangbourn ward, and apparently also most of the northern arm. It now\r\nbelongs wholly to Walbrook ward, and is merely a narrow passage\r\ncontaining no houses older than the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe now take =Walbrook=, leaving Cannon Street to be dealt with\r\nsubsequently. The memory of the stream of the Walbrook coming down from\r\nthe heights to the north is preserved in the name of this short street.\r\n\r\nIn 1279 and in 1290 we find that there were houses on the banks of the\r\nstream. In the year 1307, there was one William le Marischale living\r\nbeside the stream. It must have been almost impossible, even then, to\r\nlive near the stream, because it was a common open sewer with latrines\r\nbuilt over it. These were farmed by certain persons. Part of the stream,\r\nhowever, was covered over by the year 1300; it was not till the close of\r\nthe sixteenth century that it was completely covered over. Empson and\r\nDudley, the instruments of Henry VII.’s extortions, lived in Walbrook;\r\nand later Sir Christopher Wren is said to have lived here at the house\r\nafterwards No. 5.\r\n\r\nThe modern street is chiefly composed of ordinary stone-faced business\r\nhouses. But on the west side are three charming seventeenth-century\r\nbuildings of mellow red brick, Nos. 10, 11, and 12. On the centre one is\r\na stone tablet supported by brackets, and covered by a projecting\r\ncornice; this bears date 1668. A little farther up on the opposite side\r\nan eighteenth-century brick house stands over the entry to Bond Court.\r\nThe doorway immediately opposite the entry is a nice piece of woodwork.\r\nThere are also one or two doorways of different designs in the northern\r\npart of the court. These belong to old houses, though those buildings on\r\nthe west facing them are quite modern.\r\n\r\nReturning to the street, the ornamental front of the City Liberal Club,\r\nfounded 1874, draws attention to itself. The front is of light stone\r\nwith the windows and doorway framed in granite. Farther north on the\r\nsame side is Ye Olde Deacons Tavern, next door to Bell Court, a narrow\r\npassage of no particular interest. Representations of almost every trade\r\noccupy the street; it contains two great houses let in flats, one of\r\nwhich, Worcester House, seems to be especially given up to the offices\r\nof company promoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. STEPHEN, WALBROOK\r\n\r\n  St. Stephen, Walbrook, stands at the back of the Mansion House. It\r\n  was formerly often called St. Stephen-upon-Walbrook, from the fact\r\n  that its first site was actually upon the bank of the stream so\r\n  named. There is only one other church in the City dedicated to St.\r\n  Stephen, viz. St. Stephen, Coleman Street. The date of its\r\n  foundation is not known, but it dates back at least as far as the\r\n  reign of Henry I.; Eudo Dapifer’s gift of it to his Abbey of St.\r\n  John, Colchester, in 1096, being the earliest reference to it. It\r\n  was rebuilt early in Henry VI.’s reign, chiefly through the agency\r\n  of Robert Chicheley, Lord Mayor in 1411 and 1421. It was totally\r\n  consumed by the Fire, and rebuilt by Wren in 1672, when the\r\n  neighbouring parish of St. Benet Sherehog was annexed. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1315.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Eudo, Steward to\r\n  Henry I., who gave it to the Abbot and Convent of St. John,\r\n  Colchester, who held it up to 1422; John, Duke of Bedford, who sold\r\n  it in 1432 to Sir Robert Whytingham, Knt., who gave it to Richard\r\n  Lee in 1460, who gave it in 1502 to the Grocers Company, in whose\r\n  successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 250.\r\n\r\n  This church is, after St. Paul’s Cathedral, considered Wren’s\r\n  masterpiece. It is oblong in shape, traversed by four rows of\r\n  Corinthian columns, which divide it into five aisles, of which the\r\n  central is the broadest; it is crowned by a circular dome supported\r\n  on eight arches. The effect thus produced of the circle springing\r\n  from an octagonal base is especially graceful. The building measures\r\n  82½ feet in length, 59½ feet in width, and the height to the dome is\r\n  63 feet, to the ceiling of the side aisles 36 feet. The tower\r\n  contains four stories; upon it the steeple is placed, tapering to a\r\n  spirelet with finial and vane; the total height is about 130 feet.\r\n  Against the wall of the north transept is a picture of St. Stephen\r\n  being carried from the scene of his martyrdom; this is by Benjamin\r\n  West, P.R.A., and is generally considered his best work; it was\r\n  presented by the rector, Dr. Wilson, and put up in 1776, though it\r\n  then stood over the reredos.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Lettice Lee, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £14 : 10s. in 1548; by William Adams, who left £126 : 13 : 4 as an\r\n  endowment for a priest to sing for his soul “as long as the money\r\n  would endure”—this in 1548 was in the hands of one named Myller of\r\n  Lynn, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained a monument in memory of Sir Thomas\r\n  Pope, the founder of Trinity College, Oxford. The oldest monument\r\n  is one in memory of John Lilbourne, citizen and grocer of London,\r\n  who died in 1678. On the north wall two physicians are\r\n  commemorated—Nathaniell Hodges, who wrote a treatise on the\r\n  Plague, and died in 1688; and Percival Gilbourne, who died 1694.\r\n  In 1726 Sir John Vanbrugh the architect was interred here; he was\r\n  also a playwright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  ST. STEPHEN, WALBROOK\r\n]\r\n\r\n  According to Stow, the parish possessed £100 per annum, employed in\r\n  repairing the church, etc., the exact uses of which were unknown. He\r\n  records a legacy of £20 per annum for charitable uses left by one\r\n  named Dickenson.\r\n\r\n  Henry Chicheley, L.L.D. (d. 1443), Archbishop of Canterbury, was a\r\n  rector here; also Thomas Wilson (1703-84), author of the _History of\r\n  St. Margaret’s_; John Kite (d. 1537), Archbishop of Armagh; and\r\n  Thomas Howell (1588-1646), Bishop of Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Stephen stood on the west side of the original course\r\nof Walbrook stream. Over the new course of the stream a “covering” or\r\nsmall bridge was made for access to the church, and in 1300 the\r\nparishioners were found, by inquisition before the mayor, to be under\r\nthe obligation of repairing it. Little is known of this building; that\r\nit possessed a belfry is shown from an entry in the coroner’s roll of\r\n1278, which records the death of one William le Clarke, who, having gone\r\npigeon-nesting in the belfry, accidentally fell as he was climbing the\r\nbeams, and so ruptured and crushed his body on one of them that he died.\r\nThe fatal beam was thereupon “appraised at four pence, and two\r\nneighbours nearest to the church were attached, each by two sureties, to\r\nsee the fine or deodand paid” (Riley’s _Memorials of London_, p. 13).\r\n\r\nThe “parsonage house,” before the Great Fire, stood, Stow tells us, on\r\nthe site of the first church, next to the course of the Walbrook. It was\r\nrebuilt by one Jerome Raustorne (or Rawstorne) upon a lease of forty\r\nyears, commencing 1674, and by this, Newcourt says, was “reserved to the\r\nparson £17 a year ground-rent.” The parish at this time enjoyed an\r\nincome of £100 a year, and with part of this, supplemented by sums of\r\nmoney received from leases, and from compensations for encroachments and\r\nnew “lights” made upon the churchyard at the rebuilding of the City\r\nafter the Fire, the Vestry determined to build a new rectory house. The\r\nleave of the Grocers Company, as patrons, and a faculty from the Bishop\r\nof London, dated 1692-93, having been obtained, the new house was built\r\n(between 1693 and 1708) adjoining the west end of the church by the\r\ntower on a piece of ground, about 20 feet square, previously occupied by\r\na portion of the ante-Fire edifice. It was considered that the rector\r\nhad a title to some portion of the ground, and to half the compensation\r\nmoney paid for new lights, and accordingly it was provided that in case\r\nthe rector or any of his successors should find it inconvenient or\r\ninadvisable to live in the house, then the Vestry should let the same\r\nfrom year to year, the parish to have two-thirds of the rental, and the\r\nremaining third to go to the rector. This house is still standing, but\r\nis let out for offices, the rector living at Brockley. It is a quaint\r\nand small house, which almost touches the church wall at the back. Two\r\nof its rooms stand over the church porch. The original staircase and\r\npanelled walls remain. It is the only old house standing on the east\r\nside of Walbrook. The churchyard is situated at the east end of the\r\nchurch. It has a round flower-bed in the centre, two trees, and several\r\nbushes, and is kept in excellent order. It is entered from Church Row by\r\nan iron gate, and from the church by the door in the east wall.\r\n\r\nThe Mansion House occupies the sites of Stocks Market and St. Mary\r\nWoolchurch Haw.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. MARY WOOLCHURCH HAW\r\n\r\n  This church was situated on the eastern side of the market. It\r\n  probably derived its name “Woolchurch” from the fact that a beam was\r\n  erected in the churchyard for the weighing of wool. It was probably\r\n  built about the time of William I. by one Hubert de Ria, founder of\r\n  the Abbey of St. John in Colchester. His son Eudo Dapifer, Steward\r\n  to the Conqueror, endowed his newly-built Abbey and Convent of St.\r\n  John, Colchester, with it. The charter of foundation (1096) calls it\r\n  St. Mary de Westcheping, or Newchurch, and states that Ailward Gross\r\n  the priest held the living by gift of Hubert de Ria. The exact words\r\n  are these, and constitute the earliest mention of the church:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photochrom Co., Ltd._\r\n\r\n  THE MANSION HOUSE AND CHEAPSIDE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  _Et ecclesiam S. Mariae de Westcheping, London, quae vocatur\r\n  Niewecherche, concedente Ailwardo Grosso, presbytero qui in eadem\r\n  ecclesia et donatione antecessoris mei Huberti de Ria personatum\r\n  consecutus fuerat_ (Newcourt 1. p. 459).\r\n\r\n  In the “Taxatio Ecclesiastica” of Pope Nicholas IV. (1291) occurs\r\n  reference to _ecclesia Sancte Marie de Wolchurche hawe_, indicating\r\n  that the names of St. Mary de Westcheping and Niewecherche had alike\r\n  disappeared to give place to a title in some way derived from the\r\n  wool staple and market. This is Stow’s etymology of the name. Mr. J.\r\n  H. Round doubts the theory; he suggests that this St. Mary’s was a\r\n  daughter-church to St. Mary Woolnoth (_Athenæum_, August 17, 1889,\r\n  p. 223) (Woollen-hithe-hatch, or haw). This would give as the full\r\n  and new name of our “Niewecherche” St. Mary-in-Woollenhaw,\r\n  Church-Haw, and by contraction St. Mary Woolchurch Haw. It is\r\n  actually styled St. Mary Wolmaricherch in 1280-81, which certainly\r\n  appears to support Mr. Round’s theory.\r\n\r\n  The first rector given by Newcourt is John Dyne, who resigned in\r\n  1382. By licence granted 1442 (20 Henry VI.), the church was\r\n  rebuilt; the new building stood farther south than the old, in\r\n  accordance with a condition imposed by the licence, which ordained\r\n  it to be 15 feet from the Stocks Market “for sparing of light to the\r\n  same.” The foundation stone of this new building was discovered when\r\n  digging the foundations of the Mansion House in 1739.\r\n\r\n  The stone was drawn by R. West, engraved by Toms, and relegated to\r\n  an obscurity from which it has never since emerged: its whereabouts\r\n  is unknown. The new church, whose foundation was laid on May 4,\r\n  1442, is described by Stow as “reasonably fair and large.”\r\n\r\n  The church was destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, its\r\n  parish being annexed to the neighbouring one of St. Mary Woolnoth.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1349.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Hubert de Ria,\r\n  father of Eudo, Steward of the Conqueror’s household; Abbot and\r\n  Convent of St. John, Colchester, being the gift of Eudo; Henry VIII.\r\n  seized it, and thus it continued in the Crown until the church was\r\n  burnt down and the parish annexed to St. Mary Woolnoth, of which the\r\n  Crown shares the alternate patronage.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 360.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Anne Cawood, at the Altar of St.\r\n  Nicholas, whose endowment fetched £8 in 1548, when Henry Cockes was\r\n  priest, and to which John Chamberlayne was admitted June 2, 1525;\r\n  Roger Barlow, whose endowment fetched £3 : 6 : 8 in 1548, which was\r\n  spent on maintaining the Cawood chantry: by Godwine le Hodere in\r\n  1313 for himself and his wife, for which the King granted his\r\n  licence July 8, 1321.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained monuments to several benefactors,\r\n  amongst whom were John Winger, mayor in 1504, donor of £20 for\r\n  church purposes; Richard Shaw, sheriff in 1505, and donor of £20.\r\n\r\n  Stow records that the list of legacies and gifts was too long for\r\n  the churchwardens to give account of in their parochial visitation\r\n  of 1693, but that it could be seen in the parish registers.\r\n\r\n  William Fuller (1608-75), Bishop of Lincoln, was rector here.\r\n\r\nOf the =Wool Haw= it is interesting to know: “They set up a beam for the\r\ntronage or weighing of wool in the churchyard of St. Mary, Westcheping,\r\nwhich was henceforth known as the Wool Haw or yard, and became a wool\r\nmarket. The date is not known, but it was before 1275 (‘S. Mary de\r\nWolcherche’ occurs in a will of 1265 (see _Calendar of Wills_, vol. i.\r\np. 26)). ‘Les Customes de Wolchirchaw’ as ordained in the reign of\r\nEdward I., were as follows (_Liber Albus_, p. 216):—‘For one pound of\r\nwool (sold) to a foreigner (non-freeman) one halfpenny; and for one\r\nsack, only one halfpenny. For two woolfels and more, one halfpenny, and\r\nfor one hundred only one halfpenny. For one pound of woolen yarn, one\r\nhalfpenny; for one hundred only one halfpenny. If any foreigner brings\r\nwool, woolfels, or yarn through the city for sale, to the value of ten\r\npence and more, he shall pay as custom one farthing.’\r\n\r\n“The weighing of wool was continued here until 1383 (6 Richard II.) when\r\nJohn Churchman, having built the Custom House upon Wool Quay (Tower\r\nWard) the tronage was discontinued in this spot” (Strype).\r\n\r\nWhen the watercourse of the Walbrook was open, there was a bridge over\r\nit at the junction of Walbrook, Broad Street, and Cheap wards. At the\r\neast side of the Mansion House, running from Mansion House Street to\r\nChurch Row, is Mansion House Place. It contains only the sides of\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the erection of the Mansion House, Mansion House Place\r\nformed merely the east side of Stocks Market, and was planted with rows\r\nof trees. On the east, about the middle, was a court, and in it, says\r\nStrype (1720), “a good large house, the habitation of Godfrey Woodward,\r\none of the attorneys of the Sheriff’s court.” Strype’s map shows the\r\nposition of the court, which opened into a fair-sized quadrangle.\r\n\r\n=Stocks Market.=—In Plantagenet London the Westcheping (Westcheping\r\ncomprised at least the present Cheapside, Poultry, and Mansion House\r\nStreet) had an open space, “very large and broad,” where the Mansion\r\nHouse now stands. South of the space was St. Mary Woolchurch Haw,\r\nalready described; in the space itself a pair of stocks for punishment\r\nof offenders. By patent of Edward I., in 1282, Henry Waley, several\r\ntimes mayor, built sundry houses in the City, whose profits were\r\ndestined for the maintenance of London Bridge. The void space by the\r\nWoolchurch he built and otherwise turned into a market, known as “Les\r\nStokkes,” otherwise Stocks Market, sometimes Woolchurch Market. He\r\nappointed it a market-place for fish and flesh. The keepers of the\r\nbridge let out the stalls to fishmongers and butchers for term of their\r\nlives, until 1312-13, when John de Gisors, mayor, and the whole\r\ncommonalty decreed that life-leases should not be granted in future\r\nwithout the consent of the mayor and commonalty (for full text of the\r\ndecree see Strype, 1754 ed.). In 1322, Edward II. sent Letters Patent\r\nfrom the Tower commanding that no one should sell fish or flesh save in\r\nthe markets of Bridgestreet, Eastcheap, Old Fish Street, St. Nicholas\r\nShambles, and Stocks Market—a first offence to be punished by forfeiture\r\nof such fish or flesh as was sold, second offence by loss of freedom;\r\nand it was accordingly thus decreed by the mayor, Hamo de Chigwell. The\r\nrents of the market at that time amounted to £46 : 13 : 4 per annum.\r\nForeigners, _i.e._ non-freemen, were allowed to sell in this “house\r\ncalled the Stocks,” but under conditions. None might cut meat after 2\r\nP.M. rung at St. Paul’s; meat cut and remaining unpurchased at that time\r\nwas all to be sold by vespers, “without keeping any back or carrying any\r\naway.” In 1320 three alleged “foreigners” were accused of selling their\r\npork and beef by candlelight, after curfew had rung at St.\r\nMartin’s-le-Grand. One did not appear to defend himself, one\r\nacknowledged his offence; the meat of both was forfeited. The third\r\ncontended that he possessed the City freedom, and his meat was returned\r\nto him (Riley, _Memorials of London_).\r\n\r\nThe “butchers of the Stokkes” were jealous of their honour. In 1331 they\r\npetitioned Sir John Pountney, mayor, and the aldermen, that ordinance\r\nshould be made against certain abuses. Their prayer was granted;\r\nhenceforth no butcher having once or twice failed in payment should\r\ntrade in the market until he had paid his debts. The trade had evidently\r\ngot into bad repute owing to insolvent butchers. Likewise no “foreigner”\r\nwas to sell by retail in the market; no butcher to “take another’s man”\r\nexcept such man had paid his former master that he owed him, otherwise\r\nthe new master was to be held responsible for his servant. Also that\r\nbutchers of the market who had bought their freedom should be obliged to\r\nlive in the City. Hitherto some of them had dwelt in Stratford, and had\r\nthus avoided bearing “their part in the franchise of the City.”\r\nInfringement of the ordinance was punishable by a fine of 40s. payable\r\nto the Chamber of London (Riley, _ibid._).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STOCKS MARKET\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy degrees the flesh and fish trade centred hereabouts overflowed into\r\nthe King’s highway from Cheap conduit to the market, and became an\r\nobstruction. The common serjeant complained to the mayor and aldermen in\r\n1345. As a result, ordinary butchers, poulterers, and fishmongers were\r\nto confine their operations to their houses and shops: market men to\r\nsell within the market. On fish days the fishmongers were to occupy the\r\nmarket enclosure, and the butchers the pent-house adjoining; on flesh\r\ndays the enclosure was for the butchers, and the pent-house for the\r\nfishmongers. Obstruction of the highway henceforth entailed forfeiture\r\nof goods exposed for sale. That same year the common serjeant found\r\nthree butchers selling from stalls in the highway of Poultry, and\r\nconfiscated their meat (Riley, _ibid._).\r\n\r\nThe butchers of the “Stokkes” gave £17 to Edward III. for the carrying\r\non of the French Wars. This was a large contribution, showing their\r\nprosperous condition. Their brethren, St. Nicholas Shambles, gave only\r\n£9, those of West Cheap only £8; the greater Companies £20 to £40, the\r\nlesser mostly below £7. This old market was under strict supervision. In\r\n1319 the market wardens cited one William Sperlyng for offering two\r\nputrid beef carcases for sale. A jury of twelve pronouncing the carcases\r\nputrid as alleged, the unhappy man was ordered to be put in the pillory\r\nand to have the two carcases burned beneath him (Riley), as in the case\r\nof the pork butcher already mentioned. In 1351 one Henry de Passelewe,\r\ncook, was cited before the commonalty on a charge of selling at the\r\nStocks a pasty in which the two capons baked therein were “putrid and\r\nstinking, and an abomination to mankind: to the scandal, contempt and\r\ndisgrace of all the City,” and the manifest peril of the life of the\r\npurchaser. Passelewe contended that when sold the capons were “good,\r\nwell-flavoured, fitting and proper.” However, eight good and trusty\r\ncooks pronounced them “stinking and rotten, and baneful to the health of\r\nman.” So poor Passelewe was sentenced to the pillory, the offensive\r\npasty to be carried before him, and a proclamation to be made as to the\r\nreason of his punishment.\r\n\r\nConsiderable prejudice existed against non-freemen using the market. In\r\n1382 Adam Carlelle, late alderman of Aldgate, approached the places of\r\nthe “foreign fishmongers” and “in a haughty and spiteful manner cursed\r\nthe said strangers, saying that he did not care who heard it or knew of\r\nit, but that it was a great mockery and badly ordained than such ribalds\r\nas those should sell their fish in the City, and further that he would\r\nrather a fishmonger who was his neighbour in the City should make 20s.\r\nby him, than such a ribald barlelle was adjudged to have thus expressed\r\ncontempt for the command of the king and the ordinance of the City, and\r\nwas excluded from ever holding any offices of dignity in the City”\r\n(Riley, _Memorials_).\r\n\r\nIn 1410 (2 Henry IV.) it was found necessary to rebuild the market, and\r\nthe work was completed in the next year. The annual rents were valued at\r\n£56 : 19 : 6 in 1507, an increase of £10 on 185 years. In 1543, only 36\r\nyears later, the sum reached £82 : 3s. per annum. The market must have\r\nbeen fully let at that time: fishmongers had 25 stalls, producing £34 :\r\n13 : 4 in rent; the butchers rented 18 stalls at £41 : 16 : 4; there\r\nwere also 16 upper chambers rented at £5 : 13 : 4—total £82 : 3s. per\r\nannum (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 243, 1754).\r\n\r\nIn 1509 (1 Henry VIII.) the dwellers about the Stocks obtained leave of\r\nthe Common Council to substitute for a leaden water-pipe at the\r\nsouth-east of the market a stone conduit, or, as it is called in the\r\npetition, “a portico of stone, with a cesterne of lead therein” from\r\nwhich water was “to bee drawne out by cocks.” Time wrought changes in\r\nthe market and its uses. After the Great Fire, the fishmongers and most\r\nof the butchers gave place to the sellers of fruits, roots, and herbs.\r\nIt was of note, says Strype (1720), “for having the choicest in the kind\r\nof all sorts, surpassing all other markets in London.” The post-Fire\r\nmarket was increased by the addition of the sites of St. Mary Woolchurch\r\nHaw and its churchyard, the sites of three houses belonging to the\r\nparish, purchased for £350, and of the site of the rectory house,\r\nobtained at a perpetual rental of £10 per annum. Thus the new market was\r\n230 feet from north to south, and 108 feet from east to west, measured\r\nat the middle; besides the open roadways or passages on the west and\r\neast sides. The eastern side was planted with “rows of trees, very\r\npleasant.” The market-place itself had twenty-two covered fruit stalls,\r\nmost of them at the north side; two ranges of covered butchers’ stalls,\r\nwith racks, blocks, and scales, in the south-east corner; the remaining\r\nspace was occupied by gardeners and others who sold “fruits, roots,\r\nherbs, and flowers” (Strype, 1720). Well might Shadwell ask in his _Bury\r\nFair_ (1689), “Where is such a garden in Europe as the Stocks Market?”\r\nHere follows an amusing description of it taken from a paper called _The\r\nWandering Spy_ (1705):\r\n\r\n“I saw Stocks Market, all garnished with nuts, and pears, and grapes,\r\nand golden pippins, all in rank and file most prettily. And then on the\r\nother side for physic herbs there is enough to furnish a whole country,\r\nfrom the nourishing Eringo, to the destructive Savine, where a man may\r\nbuy as much for a penny as an apothecary will afford for half-a-crown,\r\nand do a man twice as much good as their specific bolusses, hipnotic\r\ndraughts, sudorific hausteses, anodyne compositions, and twenty other\r\nflip-flops with hard names, which only disorder the body, put nature\r\ninto convulsions, and prepare a man for the sexton. But here a man may\r\nconsult a female doctor in a straw hat without fee, have what quantity\r\nhe pleases, of what herb he pleases, be his distemper what it will, and\r\nconvert it into a juice, concoction, syrup, purge, or glister, in a\r\nquarter of an hour, without any danger to body or pocket” (Malcolm,\r\n_Londinium Redivium_).\r\n\r\nOak Apple Day, 1672, was a gala day for the market. Then it was that Sir\r\nRobert Vyner inaugurated the “nobly great statue of King Charles II. on\r\nhorseback” which he had, at his own charge, caused to be set upon the\r\nconduit at the north end of the same. The King was represented in\r\narmour, his head uncovered; the horse trampled beneath its feet the\r\nfallen form of Oliver Cromwell. The whole, which was of white marble,\r\nstood upon a freestone pedestal 18 feet high, carved with the royal arms\r\nand niches containing dolphins. Handsome iron gates and rails enclosed\r\nthis loyal tribute to a great king. That day the market conduit ran with\r\nwine; three years afterwards Sir Robert Vyner was Lord Mayor. Alas! the\r\nglory of the statue, as of the monarch it portrayed, was short-lived. It\r\nwas soon criticised as a clumsy work, and the revelation of its history\r\nturned it into a laughing-stock. Early in the eighteenth century it was\r\ndiscovered that the loyal Vyner had found somewhere abroad a statue of\r\nJohn Sobieski, King of Poland, conqueror of the Turks at Choozim. The\r\nstatue represented the King’s horse trampling on a Turk. It lay on the\r\nsculptor’s hands. Sir Robert, seeing the means of paying his sovereign a\r\ncompliment without great expense, obtained the statue, and secured\r\nLatham to substitute the head of Charles for that of the Pole. The\r\ndowntrodden Turk was christianised into Cromwell, only, unfortunately,\r\nLatham omitted to alter the Turk’s turban, which remained intact and\r\nincongruous upon Oliver’s head, and served as a confirmation of the\r\nstory. There is a lampoon on the statue worth quoting. It occurs in Lord\r\nRochester’s _History of the Insipids_ (1676):\r\n\r\n                  Could Robert Vyner have foreseen\r\n                  The glorious triumphs of his master,\r\n                  The Woolwich Statue gold had been,\r\n                  Which now is made of alabaster:\r\n                  But wise men think had it been wood\r\n                  ’Twere for a bankrupt king too good.\r\n\r\nWhen Stocks conduit was removed, the “ridiculous statue” was relegated\r\nto the rubbish heaps of Guildhall; finally the Common Council granted it\r\nto Mr. Robert Vyner, a descendant of Sir Robert, in 1779, and it was\r\ntaken by its new owner to adorn his country seat at Gantly Park,\r\nLincolnshire. The year 1737 saw the end of Stocks Market in this place.\r\nOn March 12 the sheriffs petitioned the House of Commons to remove it to\r\nFleet Ditch, and to erect the Mansion House upon its site. Their prayer\r\nwas granted; the market was removed at Michaelmas 1737, and the ancient\r\nmarket-place was enclosed with a broad fence. In its new home the name\r\nwhich it had borne for 255 years was lost, and it became known as the\r\nFleet Market. At Michaelmas 1829, exactly 82 years after its removal, it\r\nwas closed and the site cleared to form Farringdon Street. St.\r\nChristopher le Stocks, so called from its proximity to the market, stood\r\non part of the site of the present Bank of England. Seven streets now\r\nmeet before the Bank and pour forth omnibuses, cabs, and other vehicles\r\nin an endless stream of traffic. Below are the white-bricked subways of\r\nthe electric railway which form a safe crossing for those who cannot\r\nford the river of traffic.\r\n\r\n  =St. Christopher le Stocks= stood on the north side of Threadneedle\r\n  Street in the ward of Broad Street. The date of its foundation is\r\n  unknown. The building was much injured by the Great Fire and\r\n  subsequently repaired. In 1780, after the Gordon Riots, it was taken\r\n  down and its site is now covered by part of the Bank of England. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1280.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The family of Nevil\r\n  in 1281; the Bishop of London, 1415, in whose successors it\r\n  continued up to 1783.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 221.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  BANK OF ENGLAND FOUNTAIN\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained monuments to Robert Thorne, a donor\r\n  of £4445 to the parish for charitable uses; William Hampton, mayor,\r\n  1472, and great benefactor, and other donors. Few of these were to\r\n  be seen after the Fire.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By John Walles, mercer, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £10 : 13 : 4 in 1548; for Thomas Legg, to which William\r\n  Swynbrok was admitted chaplain, January 10, 1370-71; for John\r\n  Gedney, Mayor of London, 1427, at the Altar of Holy Trinity; for\r\n  Margerie de Nerford, William de Bergh, cl. and Christian Vaughan,\r\n  widow, at the Altar of Holy Trinity, for which the King granted his\r\n  licence, February 23, 1406-1407: the endowment was valued at £10 :\r\n  4s. in 1548; by John Plonkett, whose endowment fetched £13 : 17 : 8\r\n  in 1548; by Alice, wife of Benedict Harlewyn, late citizen and\r\n  clothier, at the Altar of Holy Trinity, for the king, John Wenlok,\r\n  Knt., herself, Richard, Duke of York, and Benedict her husband; the\r\n  King granted his licence, March 20, 1461-62: the endowment fetched\r\n  £5 : 13 : 4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Robert Thorne was donor of more than £4445 to the parish. John\r\n  Kendrick was also a great benefactor, whose will is recorded in full\r\n  by Stow. Sir Peter le Maire bequeathed £100 to the poor of the\r\n  parish. There were many other donors of smaller amounts.\r\n\r\n  Among notable vicars were John Pearson (1631-86), Bishop of Chester,\r\n  the theologian, and William Peirse, Bishop of Peterborough in 1630.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Church of St. Bartholomew is now also absorbed by the\r\nBank.\r\n\r\n  =St. Bartholomew Exchange=, formerly called Little St. Bartholomew,\r\n  stood at the south-east corner of St. Bartholomew Lane, over against\r\n  the Royal Exchange. The date of its foundation is unknown, but about\r\n  1438 it was rebuilt. In 1840 it was sold, and possession given to\r\n  Kames William Freshfield, junr., for the Bank of England; instead\r\n  thereof the Church of St. Bartholomew, Moor Lane, was built. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1331.\r\n\r\n  The patronage was in the hands of: Simon Goddard, citizen and draper\r\n  of London, who bequeathed it to his heir, Johanna, in 1273-74;\r\n  Edward III. in 1364; Richard Plessy; Abbot and Convent of St. Mary\r\n  Graces, 1374, confirmed February 19, 1422-23; Henry VIII., and\r\n  continued in the Crown.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 392.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here for: Richard de Plessis, Dean of the\r\n  Arches, who died 1362, when John Radyng was admitted chaplain; Mary,\r\n  wife of Sir John Lepington.\r\n\r\n  Sir William Capell, mayor, 1509, was buried here, also James\r\n  Wilford, sheriff, 1499. The church originally contained a monument\r\n  to Richard Croshawe, Master of the Company of Goldsmiths. He lived\r\n  in this parish for thirty-one years, and left by his will over £4000\r\n  for the maintaining of lectures, relief of the poor, and other\r\n  charitable uses. There are no other gifts recorded.\r\n\r\n  Ralf Brideoake (1613-78), Bishop of Chichester, was rector here;\r\n  also John Sharp (1645-1714), Archbishop of York, and Zachary Pearce\r\n  (1690-1774), Bishop of Rochester and Bangor.\r\n\r\n=Threadneedle Street.=—The derivation of this extraordinary name is very\r\nuncertain. Stow calls it Threeneedle Street, and it may possibly have\r\narisen from some tavern with the sign of the three needles. The arms of\r\nNeedlemakers Company are “three needles in fesse argent.” This is one of\r\nthe humbler Companies and has no hall.\r\n\r\nOn the north side there were in the sixteenth century “divers fair and\r\nlarge” houses, after which came the Hospital of St. Anthony, close to\r\nthe Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe very interesting foundation of St. Anthony is considered elsewhere,\r\nas so long an account would interrupt our perambulation unduly. One of\r\nthe oddest customs at a time when there were so many odd customs, was\r\nthat the pigs belonging to this house were allowed to roam about the\r\nCity as they pleased, and on the 17th January, any year, had the\r\nprivilege of going into any house that was open. But in 1281, and again\r\nin 1292, there are no exceptions made to the rule that all pigs, to\r\nwhomsoever they may belong, shall be killed, if found in the street.\r\n\r\nAn open concrete-covered space beyond the Royal Exchange lines part of\r\nthis street. Here there is a fountain erected in 1878 by the exertions\r\nand donations of an alderman. A gilded canopy overhangs a stone group of\r\na mother and two children. The pedestal and basins are of granite. On\r\nthe east there is a seated figure of Peabody, life size. The buildings\r\non the north side of the street do not require much comment; the North\r\nBritish & Mercantile Insurance Company is the most noticeable, because\r\nthe horizontal lines are broken by the deeply recessed windows. The\r\nPostal Telegraph Office next door has a little tower on the summit, and\r\nthe frontage is sprinkled with rather conventional stone panels and has\r\na superfluity of stone ornament. The Consolidated Bank, after the\r\nfollowing corner, has a plain frontage, which makes a deep frieze across\r\nthe upper part more striking; this is an allegorical subject in a stone\r\n_bas relievo_ under a heavy cornice. The National Bank of India is a\r\nsolid, well-proportioned building with symmetrical columns of polished\r\ngranite running up the front.\r\n\r\n  =St. Benet Finck= was situated on the south side of Threadneedle\r\n  Street, east of the Royal Exchange. It was dedicated to St. Benedict\r\n  and took its additional name from its founder, Robert Fincke. The\r\n  date of its foundation is unknown. It was burnt down in the Great\r\n  Fire, and rebuilt by Wren, who completed it in 1673. The church was\r\n  taken down in 1842, and its parish united with that of St.\r\n  Peter-le-Poer. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1323. The\r\n  patronage of the church was in the hands of: The family of Nevils in\r\n  1281, who presented to it as a Rectory; Master and Brethren of the\r\n  Hospital of St. Anthony, then the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, 1474,\r\n  up to 1844, when it was annexed to St. Peter-le-Poer.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300 and above.\r\n\r\n  Wren’s church was elliptical in shape, and measured 63 feet by 48\r\n  feet. It was traversed by six composite columns, which, with the\r\n  connecting arches, supported the roof. The steeple, which rose to a\r\n  height of 110 feet roughly, consisted of a tower, lead-covered\r\n  cupola, and lantern.\r\n\r\n  The original church contained monuments to John Wilcocks and Dame\r\n  Anne Awnsham (d. 1613), both benefactors of the parish. After the\r\n  Great Fire a Table of Benefactors was set up to the memory of:\r\n  George Holman, donor of £1000 to the rebuilding of the church; Anne\r\n  Thriscrosse, donor of £100 for apprenticing poor children, and\r\n  several other donors. On a table in the organ loft there was an\r\n  inscription to Mrs. Sarah Gregory, donor of £600 for various\r\n  charitable purposes. In 1662 Richard Baxter, the celebrated\r\n  Nonconformist divine, was married here.\r\n\r\nIn Threadneedle Street, at the corner of =Bartholomew Lane=, is the Sun\r\nFire Office with glittering gilt suns over the corner and windows. The\r\nangle has been sliced off to form an entrance. A heavy wreath of foliage\r\nin stone surrounds the window above. The architect was C. R. Cockerell.\r\nA graceful new building in white stone with engaged pillars fluted,\r\nrising from the top of the ground-floor, contains the Life Alliance and\r\nFire Office in Bartholomew Lane. Next door is Bartholomew House with the\r\nusual stereotyped stone detail, and a couple of somewhat cumbrous stone\r\nfigures reclining over each side window. Capel Court leads to the Stock\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  ST. BENET FINCK\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt No. 40 Threadneedle Street is a paved courtyard shut in by iron gates\r\nand behind an archway, striking because of its size and the massiveness\r\nof its stonework. This leads to entrances of the National Provincial\r\nBank of England, and the Mercantile Bank of India. Beyond it is the\r\nBaltic and South Sea House. This differs from all the preceding\r\nbuildings because it belongs to the eighteenth century, as the deep\r\ntinge of its well-preserved bricks tells.\r\n\r\nThe centre window and doorway are encased in stonework, and the solidity\r\nof the whole structure is in contrast with its “bubble” reputation. It\r\nis now occupied as chambers by merchants, brokers, etc., and the\r\nsecretary of the Baltic Company finds lodging here among others.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Threadneedle Street we have the Bank of\r\nAustralasia. Then two great doorways with an interval between them.\r\nThese bear over them the arms of the powerful Merchant Taylors Company,\r\nwhose hall is behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MERCHANT TAYLORS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The precise date of the foundation of the Company is not known, but\r\n  one of the earliest civic records mentioning the Taylors as a\r\n  separate craft, is the “Chronicle of the Mayors and Sheriffs of\r\n  London,” which narrates their dispute with the Goldsmiths in\r\n  November 1267.\r\n\r\n  In 1299 Edward I. granted them his licence to adopt the name of\r\n  “Taylors and Linen Armourers of the Fraternity of St. John the\r\n  Baptist.” Stow says that on St. John Baptist’s Day, 1300, a master\r\n  (Henry de Ryall) and four wardens were chosen, the master being then\r\n  called “the pilgrim,” as travelling for the whole Company, and the\r\n  warders “the purveyors of alms or quarterages,” plainly showing that\r\n  the gild was originally a charitable as well as a commercial\r\n  fraternity.\r\n\r\n  In March 1326 the first charter was granted to the Company by Edward\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  In 1371 the Company, under this charter, made an ordinance to\r\n  regulate their trade, with the special object of recovering damages\r\n  from workmen miscutting the cloth entrusted to them.\r\n\r\n  The Company acquired that portion of their Threadneedle Street\r\n  estate upon which their present hall stands in 1331.\r\n\r\n  In 1351 they enrolled their first honorary member; and about 1361\r\n  obtained a grant of a chapel at the north side of St. Paul’s, in\r\n  honour of St. John the Baptist, for daily service and prayers for\r\n  “the preservation of them that are or shall be of the fraternity.”\r\n\r\n  In 1480 the Company received their first grant of arms, taking\r\n  religious emblems, viz. a holy lamb set within a sun, the crest\r\n  being within the pavilion, Our Blessed Lady St. Mary the Virgin,\r\n  Christ her Son standing naked before her, holding between His hands\r\n  a vesture (_tunica inconsutilis_).\r\n\r\n  In 1484 the celebrated controversy for precedence in processions,\r\n  etc., between the Taylors and Skinners arose, which was settled by\r\n  the award of the Lord Mayor that each Company should have precedence\r\n  in alternate years, and that each should invite the other to dine\r\n  once in every year. This custom has been ever since kept up, the\r\n  master and wardens of the Taylors dining with the Skinners on the\r\n  first Thursday in December, the master and wardens of the Skinners\r\n  with the Taylors on the 14th July.\r\n\r\n  It was not till 1502 that the Company attained to the full\r\n  privileges which they afterwards enjoyed. Under Henry VII.’s\r\n  charter, not only were the Company made “Merchant” Taylors, but they\r\n  ceased to be exclusively Taylors, and were permitted to receive\r\n  others into their fraternity.\r\n\r\n  The principal object of the guild was the preservation of the trade\r\n  or calling of the fraternity, no one being permitted to work in\r\n  London as a “tailor” unless a freeman of the Company. For the\r\n  protection of the trade the right of search was vested in the guild,\r\n  such search being a guarantee to the public that the honest usages\r\n  of trade were observed, and to the fraternity that their monopoly\r\n  was not infringed. Before a tailor’s shop was opened a licence had\r\n  to be obtained from the master and wardens of the Company, and they\r\n  granted the licence only when satisfied of the competency of the\r\n  freeman. Until the abolition of Bartholomew Fair in 1854, after an\r\n  existence of 700 years, the beadle of the Company used annually to\r\n  attend the fair and to proceed to the drapers’ shops, taking with\r\n  him the Company’s silver yard stick as the standard by which to test\r\n  the measures used for selling cloth in the fair.\r\n\r\n  In 1555, anticipation of the foundation of Merchant Taylors’ School,\r\n  Sir Thomas White, a member of the Court of the Merchant Taylors\r\n  Company, founded St. John’s College, Oxford, reserving forty-three\r\n  out of its fifty endowed fellowships for scholars from the school.\r\n\r\n  The Company’s school was founded in 1561 on Lawrence Pountney Hill.\r\n\r\n  Great Crosby School, near Liverpool, of which the Company are sole\r\n  trustees and managers, was founded in 1618 by John Harrison.\r\n\r\n  In 1622 Dr. Thomas White established Sion College, giving to the\r\n  Company the nomination to eight of the twenty almshouses which he\r\n  connected with the college.\r\n\r\n  In 1666 the losses sustained by the Company in the Fire of London\r\n  obliged them to let their land in the City upon small ground-rents\r\n  to enable their tenants to rebuild, and their resources were thus\r\n  much crippled.\r\n\r\n  The number of the livery is 288. The Corporate Income is £37,000;\r\n  the Trust Income is £13,000. Their hall is at 30 Threadneedle\r\n  Street.\r\n\r\n  Privileges of membership:\r\n\r\n  (1) The only advantages that a freeman in easy circumstances\r\n  possesses is eligibility for the livery, and prospectively for the\r\n  court, and the comfortable assurance that, should he fall into\r\n  poverty by misfortune and maintain his respectability, he will\r\n  receive a pension from the Company varying in amount from £5 to £40\r\n  a year, and that, should his wife and daughters be left in poverty,\r\n  they will be assisted by the Company to earn a living. Freemen are\r\n  eligible for certain gifts and loans of money for their advancement\r\n  in life.\r\n\r\n  Poverty from ill-health, old age, or incapacity to earn a\r\n  livelihood, alone constitutes a claim to a pension or donation.\r\n\r\n  The only patronage enjoyed by individual members of the court is the\r\n  power of presenting boys to the Company’s school in London. Each\r\n  member of the court has two or sometimes three presentations\r\n  annually, according to vacancies.\r\n\r\n  The present magnificent hall was built in 1671 by Jerman. It has\r\n  been altered and improved, but it remains much the same as when\r\n  Jerman handed it over to the Company.\r\n\r\n  The Company has almshouses and schools, notably the great school on\r\n  the site of the Charter House. It also gives largely to the City and\r\n  Guilds of London Technical Institute.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of Threadneedle Street, where it meets Bishopsgate\r\nStreet, stood St. Martin Outwich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. MARTIN OUTWICH\r\n]\r\n\r\n  =St. Martin Outwich= was called Oteswich or Outwich from four\r\n  brothers of that name who founded it. It escaped the Great Fire, but\r\n  was rebuilt in 1796 by the Merchant Taylors Company. In 1873 the\r\n  parish of St. Martin Outwich was united with that of St. Helen,\r\n  Bishopsgate, and the former church pulled down; the Capital and\r\n  Counties Bank stands on its site. The earliest date of an incumbent\r\n  is 1300.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the Church was in the hands of: Edward III., who\r\n  granted it to John de Warren, Earl of Surrey, in 1328; the\r\n  Oteswiches, who, by their trustee, John Churchman, conveyed it to\r\n  the Merchant Taylors Company, July 15, 1406, who presented it up to\r\n  1855.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 227.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by John de Bredstrete, whose endowment\r\n  for this and other purposes fetched £4 : 3 : 4 in 1548. The King\r\n  granted his licence to found the Guild of St. Baptist, July 15,\r\n  1406.\r\n\r\n  Money fetched 5 per cent in 1548, for one John Kyddermester the\r\n  elder by his will bequeathed £200 to purchase £10 by year to keep an\r\n  obite, etc., in St. Martin Outwich.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of monuments are recorded by Stow. Some of the\r\n  most notable are those in memory of: Matthew Pemberton, Merchant\r\n  Taylor, donor of £50 for repairing the chapel of St. Lawrence;\r\n  Richard Staper, alderman, 1594, and greatest merchant of his day;\r\n  George Sotherton, sometime Master of the Merchant Taylors Company,\r\n  and M.P. for the City of London, who died in 1599. All the monuments\r\n  in St. Martin Outwich were removed to St. Helen, Bishopsgate, on the\r\n  union of the parishes.\r\n\r\n  No detailed account of the charities is recorded by Stow. The\r\n  benefactors whose names are given, were: Sir Henry Rowe, donor of £5\r\n  yearly; Mrs. Taylor, donor of £2 : 15s., for two special sermons a\r\n  year.\r\n\r\n  George Gardiner (d. 1589), chaplain to Queen Elizabeth and Dean of\r\n  Norwich, was rector here; also Richard Kidder (1633-1703), Bishop of\r\n  Bath and Wells; Samuel Bishop (1731-95), head master of Merchant\r\n  Taylors’ School.\r\n\r\n  There was near the church a well with two buckets; this was\r\n  afterwards turned into a pump.\r\n\r\nThere are references to “rents” in =Broad Street= as early as 1258; in\r\n1278, Matthew de Hekham, on his way from Broad Street to the Jewry, was\r\nmurdered by Jews; in 1331 there is the conveyance of a very large and\r\nsubstantial house belonging to Edmund Crepin, citizen, and deed of hire\r\nby Sir Oliver Ingham, Knt. In 1387, the parson of St. Peter’s, Broad\r\nStreet, brings to the mayor and aldermen a breviary called “Portehers,”\r\n_i.e._ for carrying about, bequeathed to the prison of Newgate by the\r\nlate Hugh Tracy, chaplain, so that priests and clerks there imprisoned\r\nmight say their service from it. And he also obtained permission to\r\nvisit the prison from time to time in order to see that the book was\r\nwell kept.\r\n\r\n“East from Currier’s row is a long and high wall of stone, inclosing the\r\nnorth side of a large garden adjoining to as large an house, built in\r\nthe reign of King Henry VIII., and of Edward VI., by Sir William Powlet,\r\nlord Treasurer of England. Through this garden, which of old time\r\nconsisted of divers parts, now united, was sometimes a fair footway,\r\nleading by the west end of the Augustine Friars church straight north,\r\nand opened somewhat west from Allhallows church against London wall\r\ntowards Moregate; which footway had gates at either end, locked up every\r\nnight; but now the same way being taken into those gardens, the gates\r\nare closed up with stone, whereby the people are forced to go about by\r\nSt. Peter’s church, and the east end of the said Friars church, and all\r\nthe said great place and garden of Sir William Powlet to London Wall,\r\nand so to Moregate.\r\n\r\n“This great house, adjoining to the garden aforesaid, stretcheth to the\r\nnorth corner of Broad Street, and then turneth up Broad Street all that\r\nside to and beyond the east end of the said Friars church. It was built\r\nby the said lord treasurer in place of Augustine Friars house, cloister,\r\nand gardens, etc. The Friars church he pulled not down, but the west end\r\nthereof, inclosed from the steeple and choir, was in the year 1550\r\ngranted to the Dutch nation in London, to be their preaching place: the\r\nother part, namely, the steeple, choir, and side aisles to the choir\r\nadjoining, he reserved to household uses, as for stowage of corn, coal,\r\nand other things; his son and heir, Marquis of Winchester, sold the\r\nmonuments of noblemen (there buried) in great number, the paving-stone\r\nand whatsoever (which cost many thousands), for one hundred pounds, and\r\nin place thereof made fair stabling for horses. He caused the lead to be\r\ntaken from the roofs, and laid tile in place whereof; which exchange\r\nproved not so profitable as he looked for, but rather to his\r\ndisadvantage” (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 184).\r\n\r\nThis house stood on the north side of what was afterwards called\r\nWinchester Street; the garden and grounds between it and the nave of\r\nAustin Friars’ Church having been built over. The beautiful steeple of\r\nthe church, in spite of the remonstrances of the parishioners and of a\r\nletter of remonstrance addressed to the Marquis by the mayor and\r\naldermen, was pulled down in 1604. The letter, the earliest in favour of\r\nthe preservation of ancient monuments, is given in Strype, vol. i. p.\r\n442:\r\n\r\n  “RIGHT HONORABLE, MY VERY GOOD LORD—There hath been offered of late,\r\n  unto this Court, a most just and earnest Petition, by divers of the\r\n  chiefest of the Parish of St. Peter the Poor, in London, to move us\r\n  to be humble Suitors unto your Lordship in a Cause, which is\r\n  sufficient to speak for itself, without the Mediation of any other,\r\n  viz.:—for the Repairing of the ruinous Steeple of the Church,\r\n  sometime called, The Augustine Friars, now belonging to the Dutch\r\n  Nation, situate in the same Parish of St. Peter the Poor: The Fall\r\n  whereof, which, without speedy Prevention, is near at hand, must\r\n  needs bring with it not only a great deformitie to the whole City,\r\n  it being, for Architecture, one of the beautifullest and rarest\r\n  Spectacles thereof, but also a fearful eminent danger to all the\r\n  inhabitants next adjoining. Your Lordship being moved herein, as we\r\n  understand, a year since, was pleased then to give honorable\r\n  Promises with Hope of present help, but the effects not following\r\n  according to your honorable intention, we are bould to renew the\r\n  said Suit agayne; eftsoons craving at your Lordship’s hands a due\r\n  consideration of so worthy a work, as to help to build up the House\r\n  of God; one of the cheefest fountains, from whence hath sprung so\r\n  great glory to your Lordship’s most noble descendency of the\r\n  Powlets; whose steps your Lordship must needs follow, to continue,\r\n  to all posterity, the fame of so bountiful benefactors both to\r\n  Church and Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  “So that I trust we shall have the less need to importune your\r\n  Lordship in so reasonable a suite; first, Bycause it doth\r\n  principally concern your Lordship, being the Owner of the greatest\r\n  part of the said Speare, or Steeple; but especially that by\r\n  disbursing of a small sum of money, to the value of 50 or 60 £s,\r\n  your Lordship shall do an excellent work, very helpful to many, and\r\n  most grateful to all, as well English as strangers; who, by this\r\n  means, shall have cause to magnify to the world this so honorable\r\n  and charitable an action. And I and my brethren shall much rejoice\r\n  to be releeved herein by your Lordship’s most noble disposition,\r\n  rather than to fly to the last remedie of the Law of the Land;\r\n  which, in this case, hath provided a Writ De reparatione facienda.\r\n\r\n  “Thus, hoping as assuredlie on your Lordship’s favour, as we pray\r\n  incessantlie for your continual Felicitie, we humbly take leaves of\r\n  your Lordship. From London, the 4th of August, 1600.\r\n\r\n                “Your Lordship’s humbly to be commauned,\r\n\r\n                                  NYCHOLAS MOSLY, MAYOR.

All that remains\r\nis the nave. In 1862 this was badly damaged by fire, but was carefully\r\nrestored, the window tracery and roof dating from that time as well as\r\nmany other additions. For an account of the Austin Friars, see _Mediæval\r\nLondon_, vol. ii. p. 345.\r\n\r\nGilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, lived in Broad Street in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s reign, Lords Weston and Dover in that of Charles I.\r\n\r\n“Here was a Glass House where Venice Glasses were made and Venetians\r\nemployed in the work; and Mr. James Howel (author of the familiar\r\nLetters which bear his name) was Steward to this house. When he left\r\nthis place, scarce able to bear the continual heat of it, he thus\r\nwittily expressed himself, that had he continued still Steward he should\r\nin a short time have melted away to nothing among those hot Venetians.\r\nThis place afterwards became Pinners’ Hall” (Cunningham’s _Handbook_).\r\n\r\nGeneral Monk (February 1660) took up his quarters at the Glass House. On\r\nthe north side was the Navy Pay Office, on the south the Excise Office.\r\n\r\nOn the site of the Excise Office was Gresham College. Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, who died in 1596, bequeathed his dwelling-house in Bishopsgate\r\nStreet for the purposes of the college, besides presenting the\r\nCorporation of the City of London and the Mercers Company with the Royal\r\nExchange on the condition that they carried on lectures in the college\r\nas he prescribed. His house was a very fine one, well suited for the\r\npurpose he had in view. After the death of his widow in 1596, lectures\r\non seven subjects were appointed and the work began. The house escaped\r\nthe Great Fire of 1666, and the mayor took the college for courts and\r\nmeetings; the merchants used the inner court for their Exchange, and\r\ntemporary shops were put up for the use of those who had been burned out\r\nby the destruction of the Exchange. In the history of the college there\r\nhas been a good deal of litigation, the full story of which may be found\r\nin Maitland and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRESHAM COLLEGE\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following Regulations are given in Stow and Strype, in 1720, in\r\nfull. They are here abridged:\r\n\r\n    1.

To have a common table, and not to entertain friends as guests at\r\n        more than three meals in one month.\r\n\r\n    5. The Year to consist of five terms:\r\n\r\n        (1) To begin on the Monday before Trinity Term and to continue\r\n            one month.\r\n\r\n        (2) From the first Monday in September and to continue a\r\n            fortnight.\r\n\r\n        (3) From the Monday before Michaelmas Term and to continue to\r\n            the end of that Term.\r\n\r\n        (4) From the Monday after Epiphany to continue two months or\r\n            sixty days.\r\n\r\n        (5) From the Monday seven night after Easter Day to the end of\r\n            Easter Term.\r\n\r\n    6. The Divinity Lecture to be read on Monday and Wednesday at 8 A.M.\r\n        in Latin and on Friday in English.\r\n\r\n    7. The Divinity Lecturer to deal especially with the controversies\r\n        which affect the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\n    8. The Law and Physick Lectures to be read, like the Divinity\r\n        Lecture, twice in Latin and once in English.\r\n\r\n    9. The other lectures in Astronomy, Geometry, Rhetoric, and Music to\r\n        be read alternately in Latin and English.\r\n\r\n    10. The Professors to wear their hoods and gowns.\r\n\r\n    11. A keeper of the House to be appointed by the Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe college was intended to be a rival, in some sort, to Oxford and\r\nCambridge. It seems never to have succeeded in attracting students. Dr.\r\nJohnson attributed its failure to the fact that the lectures were free,\r\nand that what is given is not valued. The House was pulled down in 1768\r\nand the Excise Office took its place. The lectures were then read in a\r\nroom at the Royal Exchange. In 1843 the present building was erected and\r\nthe college entered upon a new course. So far, however, it does not seem\r\nto fulfil the intentions of the Founder as a great educational centre.\r\nIsaac Barrow, Robert Hooke, and Christopher Wren have been Professors in\r\nthe college. The Royal Society held its meetings here for fifty years\r\n(1660-1710).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. PETER-LE-POER\r\n\r\n  In Broad Street at present still stands St. Peter-le-Poer, nearly\r\n  opposite the Excise Office. It escaped the Great Fire, but was\r\n  rebuilt in 1791 from the designs of Jesse Gibson. In 1842-44 St.\r\n  Benet Finck was demolished, and its parish was united with this. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1356.\r\n\r\n  So far as there is any record, since 1181 at least, the patronage of\r\n  the church has always been in the hands of the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 160 or 200.\r\n\r\n  The church is circular in shape, with a recess at the north for the\r\n  altar; a gallery originally ran round the building, but in 1888 the\r\n  greater part of this was removed. The steeple rises at the south,\r\n  the only side on which the exterior is visible, owing to surrounding\r\n  buildings. It consists of a square tower, supporting a stone cupola\r\n  which is terminated by a vane.\r\n\r\n  The most interesting monument which the present church contains is\r\n  that in memory of Dr. Richard Holdsworth, rector here in 1623, who\r\n  was for some time imprisoned by the Long Parliament. He was Master\r\n  of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and several times Vice-Chancellor of\r\n  the University. The church originally contained monuments to: John\r\n  Lucas, Master of the Requests to Edward VI., who died 1556; Robert\r\n  Calthrop, mayor, 1588; Sir William Roche, mayor, 1540; and Sir\r\n  William Garaway, at whose expense a new aisle was made in 1616,\r\n  costing £400.\r\n\r\n  Some of the charities given yearly to the poor were: £4, the gift of\r\n  Lady Ramsey; £5, the gift of John Quarles, for bread; £20, the gift\r\n  of Lady Richard, for housekeepers at Christmas time; £30, the gift\r\n  of Gerard Vanheithuysens, to be distributed among the poor.\r\n\r\n  There were six almshouses in Broad Street, the gift of Sir Thomas\r\n  Gresham.\r\n\r\n  Richard Holdsworth (1590-1649), Dean of Worcester, was rector here;\r\n  also Benjamin Hoadley (1676-1761), successively Bishop of Bangor, of\r\n  Hereford, of Sarum, of Winchester.\r\n\r\nOpposite the church of St. Peter-le-Poer stood the “old” South Sea\r\nHouse, and behind it the yards used by the Company. This was the back of\r\nSouth Sea House, the front of which was at the east end of Threadneedle\r\nStreet where it runs into Bishopsgate Street. The City of London Club\r\nnow has its premises here; it is a large building with a massive porch,\r\nbuilt by P. Hardwick.\r\n\r\nOf the other business houses in this street there is nothing to say. At\r\nthe corner of Winchester Street is Winchester House (modern), which\r\nkeeps alive the memory of old Winchester House, standing until 1839, the\r\ntown house of the marquises of Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe Pinners’ Hall was formerly in this street (see Appendix).\r\n\r\n=Wormwood Street= is a continuation of London Wall, facing it. “In the\r\nstreet,” says Strype, “briefly, there be divers courts and alleys.” In\r\nother words, that part of London was occupied as lately as 1720 or 1750\r\nby a population of industrial folk not yet driven out by the increase of\r\nmerchants’ offices and banks. There appear to have been no antiquities\r\nin this street, unless we reckon a small burial-ground belonging to St.\r\nMartin Outwich, which lay in the point of the wall.\r\n\r\nOf =London Wall= we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nNorthward are three stations, Broad Street, Bishopsgate Street, and\r\nLiverpool Street.\r\n\r\nThere are dreary rows of old brick houses on either side of the part of\r\nNew Broad Street which runs east and west. Towards the west end of the\r\nstreet are one or two well-built business houses. The site of the Jews’\r\nSynagogue is occupied by Blomfield House, largely inhabited by\r\nsecretaries of companies and syndicates. When we turn the corner into\r\nthe part of New Broad Street running north and south, we find some large\r\nmodern buildings. On the east the building is uniform for a considerable\r\nway. Broad Street House occupies all the frontage between the two\r\npassages of St. Botolph’s Churchyard. It is stone fronted and is in an\r\nItalian style. Dashwood House behind it covers a very large area of\r\nground. It is of ugly design in red brick with each line of windows in a\r\ndifferent style. Both of these are largely occupied by agents,\r\nengineers, secretaries of companies, etc. Dashwood House looks out on\r\nthe churchyard. This is an uninviting strip of ground surrounded on the\r\nsouth by the backs of warehouses. A small house at the east end is\r\ncalled “The Old Watchhouse,” and bears an inscription to the effect that\r\nit was rebuilt in 1771 by an alderman named James Townsend.\r\n\r\nIn Blomfield Street was formerly the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital,\r\nnow removed to the City Road. The Hospital had its origin in 1804 when\r\nsome gentlemen founded a free dispensary for eye diseases.\r\n\r\nThere are some large buildings on the east known as Blomfield Buildings,\r\nalso the London Provident Institution Savings Bank, and the headquarters\r\nof the London Missionary Society. The bank bears an inscription to the\r\neffect that it was erected 1835 and enlarged 1875. This Society was\r\nfirst formed a hundred years ago (January 15, 1795) in the Castle and\r\nFalcon Inn, Aldersgate Street, and it now sends missionaries to every\r\nquarter of the world. Close by is St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Chapel,\r\nstucco-covered, and a Roman Catholic School. At the corner of =East\r\nStreet= is a fine building called Finsbury House, with grey granite\r\ncolumns of considerable strength running from the ground-floor upwards.\r\nIt is well proportioned and has a well-finished angle.\r\n\r\nFinsbury Circus is surrounded by a uniform line of dull brick houses\r\nhaving their ground-floors covered with yellow stucco. At one point only\r\ndo the area railings give way, and that is at the London Institution,\r\nbuilt of Portland stone, with a heavy portico and fluted columns. The\r\nInstitution was established in 1806 in Old Jewry and afterwards removed\r\nto King’s Arms Yard, Coleman Street. It was incorporated a year after\r\nits establishment. The present building was founded in 1815 and opened\r\nfour years later.\r\n\r\nA great many solicitors have their offices in the Circus, and there is\r\nalso a sprinkling of surgeons, accountants, and secretaries of\r\ncompanies. The centre of the Circus is occupied by a wide space of grass\r\nsurrounded by a thick shrubbery of trees.\r\n\r\nNorthward of this is =Finsbury Square=, built in 1789 by George Dance.\r\nAt the junction of Finsbury Pavement and Moorgate Street stood Moor Gate\r\nfrom which northwards outside the walls stretched the great open moor,\r\nthe playground of the London citizens; this is now all built over with\r\nthe exception of the Square and Circus mentioned above.\r\n\r\n=Moorfields= so frequently occurs in documents before the end of the\r\neighteenth century, and played so large a part in the life of the\r\nLondoner, that it deserves some notice. The earliest mention made of it\r\nis in the reign of Henry II., and was apparently a large open mere or\r\nmarsh on which water lay in parts, so that in winter it was covered with\r\nice, and formed a playground where the young citizens practised a\r\nprimitive kind of skating. It was drained in 1627, and in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s time was much resorted to for the practice of archery. It\r\nwas also used as a general rendezvous for all who desired to meet\r\nwithout the gates, a perpetual fair, a drying ground, a preaching place,\r\nand many other things. It is generally said that the houseless people\r\nassembled here after the Great Fire; but Moorfields could have\r\naccommodated but a tenth part of them, so that the camps must have\r\nextended northward and westward far beyond the limits of Moorfields into\r\nFinsbury Fields northwards and to Islington.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts were made from time to time to enclose parts of\r\nMoorfields and build on the space, and these were resisted by the\r\ncitizens with much ardour; but the spreading tide heeds not resistance,\r\nand gradually the whole area was built over—even in the seventeenth\r\ncentury the fields were enclosed and surrounded by shops.\r\n\r\nMoor Gate was rebuilt in 1672, and the central gateway made higher than\r\nusual that the City Trained Bands might march through with pikes erect.\r\n\r\nFrom end to end Moorgate Street is composed of comparatively uniform\r\nstucco-fronted houses in a hideous Victorian style, with little\r\nprojecting pediments and cornices over the windows. To this there is one\r\nexception, at the south-east corner, in the British and Fire Insurance\r\nOffice, a stone and grey granite building of imposing size.\r\n\r\nGreat Swan Alley is a narrow entry which comes out just beside Ye Old\r\nSwan’s Nest public-house, which is a new stone-faced building. At the\r\nnorth-east corner are Swan Chambers, designed by Basil Champneys in\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nMoorgate Court (late Coleman Street Buildings) contains the Institute of\r\nChartered Accountants, a very fine building of stone, with panels of\r\nfemale figures in relief; on each panel is a shield, and the words Arts,\r\nSciences, Crafts, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, Manufacture, Mining,\r\nRailways, Shipping, India, Colonies, Building are inscribed on these\r\nshields. This frieze extends across the whole frontage, but is cut up by\r\nintersecting columns. It is the work of Hamo Thorneycroft. The angle at\r\nthe corner has the merit of being thoroughly unconventional. The figure\r\nof Justice surmounts the balcony. The building was designed by John\r\nBelcher, 1892. Facing south is a red brick and stone building known as\r\nMoorgate Court. This is in a picturesque style of Perpendicular Gothic,\r\nand the building over the projecting porch is carried up to the roof,\r\ngiving relief to the frontage. Altogether this is an unexpectedly\r\npicturesque Court. In the covered entry leading to it from Moorgate\r\nStreet are two old doorways, the northern one fascinating, with\r\ngrotesque faces on the keystone of the lintel, and vertical Wrenian\r\nornaments on either side. Looking back at the entry from the street we\r\nsee that these doorways belong to a very old plaster house, with tiled\r\nroof, which stands back from the street line, overlooking two shops, one\r\non either side the entry, which are finished with parapets. The windows\r\nin the tiled roof also peep over a parapet. This is the only picturesque\r\nbit in that very ugly but useful thoroughfare—Moorgate Street.\r\n\r\nClose at hand the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation have fitted\r\nup their ground-floor with pink terra-cotta which jars with the yellow\r\nplaster above. Altogether, to the east of Moorgate Street lie an amazing\r\nnumber of quiet courts, without beauty, but lined by respectable solid\r\nbrick-and-plaster houses.\r\n\r\nBetween Moorgate and Old Broad Streets east and west, and London Wall\r\nand Throgmorton Street north and south, lies a typical business quarter.\r\n\r\nIn Copthall Buildings we see great modern houses. The Chambers here are\r\nfilled by stock-jobbers and stockbrokers. Copthall Avenue is made up of\r\nfine well-built houses and little old ones. Lanthorn, Moorgate,\r\nThrogmorton, Copthall Houses are all in a sensible but not displeasing\r\nstyle. Some are of the lighter red brick and light stone which shows up\r\nwell in a London Street, others in grey stone and granite. Copthall\r\nHouse, which runs round the corner along the south part of Sun Court,\r\nhas windows bayed in imitation of an old style. Basil Champneys was the\r\narchitect. For the old houses, Nos. 4 and 6 on the east side date from\r\nthe seventeenth century. Nos. 10 and 12 are of about the same date. Nos.\r\n22, 24, and 26 farther northward are also old, and are perhaps early\r\neighteenth century; their discoloured bricks and the bent lines of the\r\nwindows and doorway bear testimony to their years.\r\n\r\nOf =Lothbury= there is not much to say; it contains the Bank of\r\nScotland, and the chief office of the London and Westminster Bank, and\r\nnumerous companies are promoted and worked from this address.\r\n\r\nThe building at the corner of Tokenhouse Yard is in the style known as\r\nVenetian Gothic. It is harmoniously carried out. There is a somewhat\r\ndeeply recessed doorway. The building bears a frieze or panel on it\r\nwhich divides an upper window into two parts. It was designed by G.\r\nSomers Clarke and built in 1866. No. 19, the Auction Mart in Tokenhouse\r\nYard, owns the same architect, and is characterised by the same air of\r\nneatness and finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. MARGARET, LOTHBURY\r\n\r\n  St. Margaret, Lothbury, was probably rebuilt about 1440; the\r\n  building was destroyed by the Great Fire; the present church was\r\n  designed by Wren and completed in 1690. It serves, besides its own\r\n  original parish, for 6 other parishes—those of St. Christopher, St.\r\n  Bartholomew by the Exchange, St. Olave Jewry, St. Martin Pomeroy,\r\n  St. Mildred in the Poultry, and St. Mary Colechurch. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1181.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: the Abbess and\r\n  Convent of Barking, Essex, 1303. Henry VIII. who seized it, and so\r\n  it continues in the Crown to the present time.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 279.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 66 feet in length, 54 feet in breadth, and 36\r\n  feet in height. It contains a nave, chancel, and one aisle,\r\n  separated by Corinthian columns. The south aisle, which is railed\r\n  off, contains a side-altar at the east. The steeple consists of a\r\n  three-storied tower and cornice, surmounted by a lantern and obelisk\r\n  with finial and vane; its total height is 140 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: John le Boteler, sen., citizen, for\r\n  himself and Matilda his wife, for which the King granted his\r\n  licence, August 2, 1321; John Julyan, whose endowment fetched £7 :\r\n  4 : 0 in 1548, when John Badye was priest; John Iforde, whose\r\n  endowment yielded £6 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Patrick Faber was\r\n  priest.\r\n\r\n  Reginald Coleman, son of Robert, who is supposed to be the first\r\n  builder of Coleman Street, was buried here in 1483. Also John Benet,\r\n  rector of the parish and a great benefactor; John Dimocke, who\r\n  served Henry VIII. and Edward VI.; Nicholas Style, Alderman of\r\n  London, who died in 1615.\r\n\r\n  On the demolition of St. Olave’s, a monument to Alderman John\r\n  Boydell, the engraver (Lord Mayor in 1790), was removed to this\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  Anthony Bedingfield gave £100 to the parish; Mary Barnes, £100;\r\n  Thomas Bremley, £5; Henry VIII., £3 : 6 : 8; John Hanson, £50 for\r\n  the completion of the church. Many other names are recorded on the\r\n  Table of Benefactors.\r\n\r\n=Throgmorton Street= takes its name from Sir Nicholas Throckmorton who,\r\ntradition says, was poisoned by Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Queen\r\nElizabeth’s favourite. Sir Nicholas Throckmorton was born in 1515 and\r\ndied in 1570. There is nothing to warrant the statement that he was\r\npoisoned by Dudley, with whom he was on friendly terms. What was the\r\nname of the street before the life and death of Sir Nicholas\r\nThrockmorton? Stow simply says that in Throgmorton Street, Thomas\r\nCromwell built a large house in the place of certain tenements. The\r\nhouse in 1541 became the property, and the second hall, of the Drapers\r\nCompany. It could hardly have been named after a man at that time only\r\ntwenty-six years of age.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, other Throckmortons; the name in the _Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography_ occupies nearly eight pages. Most of them lived a\r\ngood deal in London; all of them occupied good positions; the street,\r\nformerly part of Lothbury, may have received its name from one or other\r\nof the family. The following imperfect genealogy of the family will\r\nillustrate this possibility:\r\n\r\n Sir John Throgmorton (Under Treasurer of Chamberlain of Exchequer) Lived\r\n    in London, where his will is dated (d. 1445).\r\n +Alianora, heiress of Sir Guy de la Spirn of Coughton.\r\n ├── Sir Thomas (d. 1472).\r\n │   └── Sir Robert, Privy Councillor Henry VII. (d. 1518).\r\n │       └── Sir George\r\n │           +Katherine, daughter of Lord Vaux.\r\n │           ├── Thomas (d. 1614).\r\n │           │   └── Thomas, Baronet, 1642.\r\n │           ├── Clement.\r\n │           │   └── Job (1545-1601), Puritan Controversialist.\r\n │           ├── Sir Nicholas (1515-1570).\r\n │           │   └── Etc.\r\n │           └── Sir John (Master of Requests, lived in London, d. 1580).\r\n │               └── Francis, Conspirator (b. 1554, executed Aug. 1584).\r\n ├── John.\r\n └── Seven daughters.\r\n\r\nWe have here a choice of four generations of Throckmortons, all more or\r\nless intimately connected with London, any one of whom may have given\r\nhis name to the street.\r\n\r\nThe courts leading out of Throgmorton Street on the north were, in 1750,\r\nWhalebone Court, Angel Court, Copt Hall Court, Warnford Court, and\r\nAustin Friars. On the south were formerly Bartholomew Lane, Bartholomew\r\nCourt, Shorters Court, and Crown Court. All of these, except Whalebone\r\nand the Bartholomew Courts, still exist.\r\n\r\nThe present =Throgmorton Street= is lined by the usual business houses\r\nin a decorative style, with a general uniformity pervading all. The\r\nDrapers’ Hall occupies a great part of the northern side with its\r\ncurving frontage and highly decorative frieze.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DRAPERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The association from which the Drapers Company derive their origin\r\n  appears to have partaken of the nature of a social and religious as\r\n  well as a commercial guild. The exact date of their foundation\r\n  cannot be ascertained, but they undoubtedly existed as a brotherhood\r\n  at a very early period. Madox (_Hist. Exch._ p. 391) mentions the\r\n  Gilda Parariorum, whereof John Maur was alderman, among the\r\n  adulterine guilds amerced in the 26 Henry II. (1180). The Company\r\n  possess a certificate by William Camden, Clarencieux King-of-Arms,\r\n  certifying the arms borne by Henry Fitz Alwin, Lord Mayor 1198-1212,\r\n  and that he was a member of the Drapers Company.\r\n\r\n  The earliest charter of which the Company have any record is the\r\n  Charter of Privileges of 38 Edward III.\r\n\r\n  The earliest ordinances of which the Company possess any record\r\n  purport to be a revision of an earlier set made in 1322. The revised\r\n  ordinances were made in 1418.\r\n\r\n  The earliest accounts in the possession of the Company are those of\r\n  the wardens for the year 1415. In that year the number of members is\r\n  shown to exceed 100, and quarterage was received from 83 persons,\r\n  and due from 13 more.\r\n\r\n  The arms of the Company were first granted by Sir William Bruges,\r\n  Garter King-of-Arms, March 10, 1439-40. This grant was confirmed\r\n  with the addition of crest and supporters by William Harvey,\r\n  Clarencieux, July 10, 1561, and again confirmed with a slight\r\n  alteration by Sir William Segar, Garter, June 6, Jac. I. 1613.\r\n\r\n  In 1607 the Company obtained an entirely new charter (4 Jac. I.,\r\n  19th January), incorporating them by their ancient style of “The\r\n  Masters and Wardens and Brethren and Sisters of the Guild or\r\n  Fraternity of the Blessed Mary the Virgin of the Mystery of Drapers\r\n  of the City of London,” and vesting the government in the master,\r\n  four wardens and assistants. Under this charter the government of\r\n  the Company has been carried on down to the present day.\r\n\r\n  (1) The advantages incident to the position of a freeman of the\r\n  Company consist of the eligibility to participate in the various\r\n  charitable funds held by the Company in trust for their members, and\r\n  to become liverymen of the Company.\r\n\r\n  (2) Liverymen of the Company, as such, have no pecuniary or other\r\n  direct advantages, but they constitute the class from which the\r\n  governing body is elected, and every liveryman, except in cases of\r\n  special disqualification, is in his turn placed in nomination for\r\n  the governing body.\r\n\r\n  (3) The master is entitled to, and is paid, certain small bequests\r\n  which amount to £2 : 13 : 4 per annum.\r\n\r\n  The wardens are also entitled to certain bequests and allowances\r\n  which amount on an average to £106 : 4 : 10 per annum. This sum is\r\n  not paid to them, but goes towards the cost of the election dinner\r\n  in August, which in ancient times was provided by the wardens.\r\n\r\n  The members of the governing body, as such, have no direct pecuniary\r\n  or other advantages.\r\n\r\n  Freemen and liverymen of the Company receive no fees.\r\n\r\n  The fees paid to the master, wardens, and other members of the\r\n  governing body, for their attendance at courts and committees during\r\n  the last ten years, average £3225 : 12 : 6 per annum.\r\n\r\n  No pensions or donations are paid to liverymen. Liverymen who have\r\n  become reduced in circumstances, and have applied for and received\r\n  the return of their livery fine, are then eligible to receive\r\n  charitable assistance as freemen.\r\n\r\n  Assistance by way of pension or donation is not granted to any\r\n  member of the Company except on full inquiry into his circumstances,\r\n  to ascertain that he is in need of assistance, and that his\r\n  necessity is not occasioned by his own improvidence or misconduct.\r\n\r\n  The number of the livery of the Drapers is 300; their Corporate\r\n  Income is £50,000; their Trust Income is £28,000.\r\n\r\n  The Drapers have had several places of meeting. The first is said to\r\n  have been the Church of St. Mary Bethlehem outside Bishopsgate; the\r\n  next, where Nos. 19 to 23 St. Swithin’s Lane now is. This was\r\n  formerly the house of Sir John Hend, draper, Lord Mayor 1391 and\r\n  1404, who materially assisted towards the rebuilding of St.\r\n  Swithin’s Church in 1420. In 1479 the Company’s annals have this\r\n  entry respecting tithes: “Paid to the parson of St. Swithin for our\r\n  place for a year VIs. VIIId.,” implying that it had now regularly\r\n  passed into the Company’s hands. Herbert, in his _History of the\r\n  London Livery Companies_, has sifted out information regarding this\r\n  hall, which tells much concerning its apartments, and the brave\r\n  feasts held therein on election days and other occasions. The great\r\n  hall was strewed with rushes and hung mostly with tapestry, but the\r\n  upper end, above the dais for the high table, with blue buckram. It\r\n  must have been of large dimensions, capable of dining two to three\r\n  hundred persons, and here assembled bishop and prior and parson,\r\n  Lord Mayor and Mayoress, to feast with the master and wardens and\r\n  brethren and sisters of the Drapers Company all seated at table in\r\n  due order of rank. The sisters had a dining-room of their own, “the\r\n  ladies’ chamber,” and there was a “chekker chamber” laid with mats\r\n  and set apart for “maydens,” but both married and unmarried ladies\r\n  usually dined in hall with the brothers of the fraternity. Besides\r\n  the refectory, there was a large kitchen with its three fire-places,\r\n  and there were buttery and pantry, a store-house for cloth, and “a\r\n  scalding yard”; also a court-room, a “great chamber” or livery-room,\r\n  and parlours hung with tapestry or painted green, and all contained\r\n  beneath the shelter of leaded roofs. The Drapers continued to feast\r\n  and transact their business here until 1541, when they bought the\r\n  house in Throgmorton Street which had belonged to Thomas Cromwell,\r\n  Earl of Essex.\r\n\r\n  The Earl had suffered attainder under Henry VIII. This estate formed\r\n  the finest hall that any City Company had hitherto obtained. It\r\n  contained, besides the buildings, a large garden at the back. This\r\n  garden was still preserved until a few years ago, when the greater\r\n  part of it was sold and converted into offices.\r\n\r\n  The hall, after the Fire, was rebuilt, but a hundred years\r\n  afterwards, in 1774, it was greatly damaged by another fire. The\r\n  present hall was altered and remodelled, with the addition of a\r\n  screen, in 1866-70.\r\n\r\n  In February 1660 General Monk made Drapers’ Hall his headquarters.\r\n  The Company point to many illustrious members. The Pulteneys, Earls\r\n  of Bath; the Capels, Earls of Essex; the Brydges, Dukes of Chandos\r\n  were descended from members of the Drapers Company.\r\n\r\n  What was said of the Mercers may be repeated of this Company. They\r\n  administer their great Trust Income in the endowment of hospitals,\r\n  schools, and almshouses; and they have large funds for purely\r\n  charitable and philanthropic purposes. Of late the Drapers Company\r\n  have taken up the cause of Technical Education; at the People’s\r\n  Palace they have a Polytechnic attended by thousands of students,\r\n  with classes of instruction in all the principal trades.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of Throgmorton Avenue, near London Wall, is the\r\nCarpenters’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CARPENTERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  A brotherhood or guild of carpenters is believed to have existed in\r\n  London about 1350, but under what circumstances we have no\r\n  information. The first charter to the present Company was granted in\r\n  1477, 17 Edward IV. This granted to certain freemen of the mystery\r\n  of carpentry of the City of London, that they or any of them might\r\n  establish a brotherhood or guild within the City to remain for ever,\r\n  to consist of one master, three wardens, and commonalty of freemen\r\n  of the mystery of carpentry abiding in the City of London, and the\r\n  suburbs and precincts of the same, and of the brethren and sisters\r\n  of the freemen of the said mystery, and of all others who of their\r\n  devotion will be of the same brotherhood or guild; and that the same\r\n  master, wardens, and commonalty should be one body and one\r\n  commonalty, incorporated by the name of Master, Wardens, and\r\n  Commonalty of the Mystery of Freemen of the Carpentry of the City of\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n  This charter was exemplified, ratified, and confirmed by Philip and\r\n  Mary (a Charter of Inspeximus), and also by Elizabeth; the latter\r\n  exemplification being dated 8th November, 2 Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  James I., by charter (dated 15th July, 5 James I.), granted to the\r\n  master, wardens, and commonalty of the mystery of freemen of the\r\n  carpentry of the City of London, that they should exercise the\r\n  powers of search, correction, and government of all the freemen of\r\n  the art or mystery of Carpenters of the City, or using or exercising\r\n  the said art or mystery within the said City or the suburbs of the\r\n  same, or within two miles thereof, together with powers for the\r\n  inspection of timber, and regulation of matters relating to the\r\n  trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. W. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  CARPENTERS’ HALL, LONDON WALL, 1830\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Charles I., by charter (dated 17th July, 16 Charles I.), reciting\r\n  the preceding charters, and that various frauds and deceptions were\r\n  practised in the trade, granted to the master, wardens, and\r\n  commonalty of the Company, that the master, wardens, and assistants\r\n  for the time being, to the number of twelve or more, of which the\r\n  master and wardens for the time being to be four, being met together\r\n  upon summons to be made for that purpose, should have full power and\r\n  authority to appoint, constitute, and make ordinances, decrees, and\r\n  constitutions in writing for the good rule and government of the\r\n  master, wardens, and commonalty of the mystery, and of all other\r\n  persons being free of the art or mystery, or using the same art or\r\n  mystery within the City of London, or liberties of the same, and for\r\n  declaring in what manner the master, wardens, and commonalty, and\r\n  all such persons as aforesaid, should behave themselves, and use the\r\n  occupation of the said art or mystery.\r\n\r\n  Charles II., by charter (dated 20th October, 26 Charles II.),\r\n  reciting and confirming the preceding charters, granted, upon the\r\n  humble petition of the master and wardens of the Company, the\r\n  oversight and government of all and singular persons, whether\r\n  freemen of the said mystery, or using or occupying the same within\r\n  the City of London, or within four miles of the same, together with\r\n  very extensive powers and privileges for exercising the oversight,\r\n  search, and measurement of all and all manner of timber, timber\r\n  stuff, and materials, and the works and workmanship thereto within\r\n  the before-mentioned limits.\r\n\r\n  In 1666 an Act of Parliament was passed ordering brick building in\r\n  place of wood, and all carpenters, etc., not freemen of the City\r\n  employed in the building were, for the space of seven years, to be\r\n  allowed the liberty of working as freemen, and all who should so\r\n  help for seven years were to enjoy the same liberty for their lives.\r\n  In 1693 an Act of Common Council was passed by which all persons\r\n  carrying on the trade of carpentry in the City of London were\r\n  compelled to bind their apprentices to the Carpenters Company.\r\n\r\n  The Company is now governed by a master, three wardens, and a\r\n  varying number of assistants.\r\n\r\n  The livery numbers 150. The hall in Throgmorton Avenue was built\r\n  when the old hall at London Wall was taken down in 1876. The\r\n  Corporate Income of the Company is £16,000 and the Trust Income is\r\n  £1180.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next group is a triangle, of which Bishopsgate Street and Fenchurch\r\nStreet are two sides. It is a part of very considerable interest, though\r\nnot so full of history as Cheapside or Thames Street. It contains the\r\ngreat market of Leadenhall Street, which is itself a continuation of\r\nthat market which extended eastward from West Chepe to the Poultry, to\r\nCornhill, to Gracechurch Street or Grass Street, and so to Leadenhall,\r\nthe distributing market of London, and from London to the country. Its\r\nfinancial centre was Lombard Street before the Exchange was built. At\r\ntwo points it had a City gate; it had three monastic houses, St.\r\nHelen’s, The Papey, and the Holy Trinity; it has been for three hundred\r\nyears especially a Jewish quarter; it had the East India Houses one\r\nafter the other, and it has within its borders the most ancient church\r\nin the City, that of St. Ethelburga, with three other churches which\r\nwere not destroyed by the Fire.\r\n\r\n=Fenchurch Street.=—The origin of the name has been generally accepted\r\nas from a supposed situation in a marsh or fen. According to Stow, “of a\r\nfenny or moorish ground, so made by means of this borne”—“Langborne.” We\r\nmay admit the fenny ground, but we are not obliged to admit the\r\nexistence of a stream here. Maitland, who loves to be precise, says that\r\nthe stream rose in a place called Magpie Alley close to St. Katherine\r\nColeman, and ran down Fenchurch Street and Lombard Street as far as the\r\nwest end of St. Mary Woolnoth, where it turned south at Sherborne Lane\r\n(whence the name) and divided into many rivulets, where it fell into the\r\nThames. Now, no trace of any such stream has ever been found. Moreover,\r\nthough the levels of the streets have been raised by many feet, they\r\nhave been raised in proportion, and if such a stream now ran along\r\nFenchurch Street, it would run up-hill for half its course. Further, the\r\nname Sherborne does not mean what Maitland thinks at all. Its real\r\nmeaning may be found in the _Calendar of Wills_ (vol. i. p. 147, and on\r\nmany other pages). Langborne appears as Langford in an early list.\r\nSomewhere near the end of Sherborne Lane was the wall, and perhaps the\r\nfosse of the Roman citadel. But Stow, and Maitland after him, call the\r\nward Langborne and Fennie About. Langborne was one part—that of which\r\nLombard Street is the principal part—and Fennie About the other, in the\r\nmarshy ground.\r\n\r\nThe ward is mentioned in a murder case (Riley’s _Memorials_) in 1276.\r\nReference to the parish occurs repeatedly between 1276 and 1349\r\n(_Calendar of Wills_). There are mentioned messuages, rents, tenements,\r\nshops, a brew-house, etc., in the parish. The street is mentioned\r\nseparately later. In the fourteenth century there are dwelling-places,\r\ntenements, mansion-houses, brew-houses, bakehouses, and shops. But there\r\nare no signs of a fen in or about the street. It is suggested that as\r\nGracechurch Street is the street of Grass, so Fenchurch Street is\r\nFoin-church, the street of Hay, both streets belonging to the market of\r\nhay, grass, and corn. But Professor Skeat replies to this suggestion:\r\n“It is impossible to derive _fen_ from the French _foin_. No French _oi_\r\nbecomes _e_ in English. But it might be derived from the Anglo-French\r\n_fein_, which is the corresponding word to the French _foin_ and had the\r\nsame sense. In this case it ought to be possible to find the spelling\r\n_fein_. Otherwise _fen_ can only mean _fen_. Note that the English _fen_\r\nmay be spelt also _fenne_. But the Anglo-French _fein_ could not take\r\neither _n_ or _ne_ at the end of it. I suspect Stow is right. I see no\r\nevidence to the contrary.”\r\n\r\nAgain, writing later, Professor Skeat says: “I think we can get at\r\nFenchurch now, by help of the history.\r\n\r\n“Fen was an extremely common word in Middle English, not merely in the\r\nsense of _morass_, but in the sense of the modern word _mud_. ‘Mud’ is\r\nquite a late word, but I presume that the thing was known in the City\r\neven in the earliest times, and the name of it was ‘fen.’ This being so,\r\nit is tolerably certain that if the name originally was anything that\r\ncould be readily turned into _fen_, that would soon become the\r\npronunciation and the ‘popular’ etymology.\r\n\r\n“If we start from the idea of Hay, we proceed through the Norman form\r\nwhich was not _foin_ (this could never have given us _fen_), but _fein_\r\nor _fayn_, or _fain_, pronounced as modern English _fain_ (the nasal _n_\r\nin Norman being of little account except after the simple vowels _a_ and\r\n_e_). But the corresponding verb ‘to cut hay’ was actually ‘fener.’ The\r\nphrase ‘Li fain estoient fené’ is quoted from Froissart in Godefroy’s\r\n_Old French Dictionary_, s.v. _Fener_. And the verb _fener_ is still in\r\nuse in Burgundy.\r\n\r\n“It is easy to see how the word _fain_ could thus be associated with a\r\npronunciation _fen_, and Englishmen who knew no French (there were\r\nplenty of them) may very well have imagined in their hearts that the\r\nreference was to the mud in the streets. That there _was_ mud may be\r\ntaken for granted. There is some left still.\r\n\r\n“There was also a remarkable adjective _feneresse_, whence the word\r\n_feneresse_, a female seller of hay. And there was a word _fenerie_\r\nwhich meant a barn for hay. And _feneron_, a hay maker.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Skeat later repeats that if the word for hay is used by itself\r\nin London, it will be in the form of fein-fain. The spelling Fanchurch\r\nis especially valuable; in fact, it settles it, for _fan_ may be short\r\nfor _fain_ whereas _fan_ cannot be another form of _fen_.\r\n\r\nThere are extant many ancient deeds connected with this street. Here was\r\na brew-house called Le George super le Hoop.\r\n\r\nRoman remains have been found here, vases, things in bronze, and an iron\r\ncandlestick.\r\n\r\nAt No. 119 Fenchurch Street is a tavern known as the Elephant. It stands\r\non the site of a house called the Elephant and Castle. In the Great Fire\r\nthis house, being built of stone, resisted the flames, and offered\r\nshelter to many homeless people. Is the same thing related of the\r\nchurches? They, too, were built of stone. Why did not they resist the\r\nflames?\r\n\r\nWallace was taken, on his arrival in London as a prisoner, to the house\r\nof William de Leyre in Fenchurch Street.\r\n\r\nAt the King’s Head Tavern, Queen Elizabeth was regaled with pork and\r\npeas on a certain visit to the City.\r\n\r\nIn Fenchurch Street at present, on the south side, the building numbered\r\n3 and 4, which contains the Castle Mail Packet Company, is well\r\ndesigned, with wide, deeply-recessed windows enriched by mouldings. The\r\nground-floor is encased in grey polished granite. Langbourn Chambers is\r\na huge mass of building. Down the side of the street are various plain\r\nbrick buildings of different ages interspersed with modern erections,\r\nstone fronted.\r\n\r\nThe huge building at the west corner of Mark Lane running round into\r\nFenchurch Street is so covered with stone ornamentation, statues, etc.,\r\nthat the red brickwork is hardly to be seen. This is the London Tavern,\r\nand contains the City Glee Club. Both Mark and Mincing Lanes abound in\r\ngreat commercial buildings. Fen Court has an old stuccoed house over the\r\ntunnel-like entrance, but in itself is all composed of flat-windowed\r\nexpressionless offices. These look down on the ancient graveyard, a very\r\nlarge space for one of the City churches. It is surrounded by railings,\r\nand divided down the centre by a flagged path. Several flat tombstones\r\nlie in the middle, and one or two altar tombs complete the quiet\r\npicture, over which the leaves of the wych-elms throw shadows. Those who\r\nhave read Mrs. Riddell’s tragic story _George Geith of Fen Court_ will\r\nremember her description of the Court. Beyond Fen Court is the Spread\r\nEagle Bread Company, a fine old house of the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The gilt eagle spreads its wings in front of a square red-brick\r\nblock with antiquated windows, and a general tint of age.\r\n\r\nThe Ironmongers’ Hall, a large building, faces Fenchurch Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE IRONMONGERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The earliest notice of the craft is in 1351. The first charter\r\n  incorporating the Company was granted by Edward IV. in the year\r\n  1463, but it appears that a voluntary company or fraternity of\r\n  members of the iron trade had existed for many years previous to\r\n  that date.\r\n\r\n  There followed an Inspeximus Charter of Philip and Mary, dated June\r\n  20, 1558, which confirmed the charter of Edward IV.; Letters Patent\r\n  of the second year of Queen Elizabeth, dated November 12, 1560, by\r\n  which the charter of Edward IV. was further confirmed. James I., by\r\n  Letters Patent dated June 25, 1605, confirmed the privileges and\r\n  possessions of the Company. He also, in 1620, confirmed the Company\r\n  in the possession of certain lands and tenements therein mentioned,\r\n  in consideration of £100 paid to him. James II., by charter dated\r\n  March 18, 1685, confirmed all their privileges and granted new and\r\n  additional privileges, and by Letters Patent, dated November 19,\r\n  1688, he confirmed the last-mentioned charter.\r\n\r\n  Stow merely mentions the Hall, which occupied the area between\r\n  Fenchurch and Leadenhall Streets. It existed in 1494 and was rebuilt\r\n  in 1587. The present Hall was erected in 1748-50 on the site of an\r\n  Elizabethan house which had escaped the Fire.\r\n\r\n  The number of liverymen varies; it is now thirty-seven. The\r\n  Corporate Income is £12,000; the Trust Income is £11,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IRONMONGERS’ HALL IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n]\r\n\r\n  1. Freemen are invited to two dinners yearly, and they, their wives,\r\n  and children are entitled to the benefit of the various charities\r\n  bequeathed for their use by members of the Company or others,\r\n  particulars of which are furnished to them on admission to the\r\n  freedom.\r\n\r\n  2. Liverymen form the court and receive fees for their attendance on\r\n  courts and committees for transacting the business of the Company\r\n  and the charities. The amount of fees paid to members of the Company\r\n  for their attendances at courts and committees during the last ten\r\n  years averages £735 for each year. No fees are paid out of the trust\r\n  estates.\r\n\r\n  3. The master and wardens have no privileges beyond the other\r\n  liverymen, and no liveryman receives any money from the charities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. KATHERINE COLEMAN\r\n\r\n  St. Katherine Coleman stands on the south side of Fenchurch Street,\r\n  farther east. Its second name is derived from its proximity to a\r\n  garden, anciently called “Coleman’s Haw.” In 1489 Sir William White,\r\n  Draper and Lord Mayor, enlarged the church; it was further enlarged\r\n  in 1620 and a vestry built in 1624. It escaped the Great Fire of\r\n  1666, but by the subsequent elevation of Fenchurch Street its\r\n  foundations were buried. In 1734 the building was pulled down and\r\n  the present one erected from the designs of an architect named\r\n  Horne. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1346.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Dean and Canons\r\n  of St. Martin’s-le-Grand since 1346, then the Abbot and Convent of\r\n  Westminster, 1509; Thomas, Bishop of Westminster, by grant of Henry\r\n  VIII., January 20, 1540-41; Bishop of London by grant of Edward VI.\r\n  in 1550, confirmed by Queen Mary, March 3, 1553-54, in whose\r\n  successors it continued. The present building is of brick, with\r\n  stone dressings. The tower rises at the west.\r\n\r\n  Sir Henry Billingsley, Lord Mayor of London, was buried here in\r\n  1606. A few monuments are recorded by Strype, but the individuals\r\n  commemorated are of little note. The finest monument still preserved\r\n  is that to Lady Heigham (d. 1634), wife of Richard Heigham,\r\n  gentleman pensioner to King Charles I.\r\n\r\n  Sir H. Billingsley left £200 for the poor at his death, but his\r\n  heirs did not carry out his instructions. Jacob Lucy was donor of\r\n  £100; Thomas Papillon of £61. Other names also were recorded on the\r\n  Table of Benefactors erected in 1681. There was a workhouse\r\n  belonging to the parish.\r\n\r\n  =St. Gabriel, Fenchurch=, was situated in the middle of Fenchurch\r\n  Street between Rood Lane and Mincing Lane. It was burnt down by the\r\n  Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to St. Margaret\r\n  Pattens by Act of Parliament. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1321.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of this church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Holy Trinity, 1321-1519; the Crown from 1540 up to 1666,\r\n  when the church was burnt down and the parish annexed to St.\r\n  Margaret Pattens.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 200.\r\n\r\nFor Rood Lane, Mincing Lane, and the other streets south of Fenchurch\r\nStreet leading to Thames Street, see Group V.\r\n\r\n=Billiter Street=, not, as Stow says, from its first owner Belzetter,\r\nbut from being the quarter in which stood the Bell Founders. Agnes,\r\nsister of Thomas à Becket, had land in Bellzetter Lane, parish of St.\r\nMichael, Aldgate. The lane is mentioned in the _Calendar of Wills_ in\r\n1298, and on many occasions afterwards. Strype, in 1720, calls it a lane\r\nof very ordinary account, the houses being very old and of timber (the\r\nplace escaped the Fire), the inhabitants being “inconsiderable, as small\r\nbrokers, chandlers, and the like.” But the chief “ornament” of this\r\nplace was Billiter Square, which was then newly built with good brick\r\nhouses “well inhabited.”\r\n\r\n=Lime Street= runs between Fenchurch and Leadenhall Streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1576 a passage was constructed at the north-east corner of this\r\nstreet; in the necessary excavation was discovered what Stow calls a\r\n“hearth” made of Roman tiles, every tile half a yard square and two\r\ninches thick. It was six feet under ground, corresponding in depth with\r\nRoman remains found on Cornhill. The passage was duly set up and was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nThe name of the street occurs in the _Calendar of Wills_ for the year\r\n1298. We are now approaching that imaginary belt of the City lying\r\nbetween the markets and Thames Street, in which the merchants and the\r\nnobles mostly had their houses. Stow enumerates a long list of the great\r\nhouses in Lime Street:\r\n\r\n“In Lime Street are divers fair houses for merchants and others; there\r\nwas sometimes a mansion-house of the kings, called the King’s Artirce,\r\nwhereof I find record in the 14th of Edward I., but now grown out of\r\nknowledge. I read also of another great house in the west side of Lime\r\nStreet, having a chapel on the south and a garden on the west, then\r\nbelonging to the Lord Nevill, which garden is now called the Green yard\r\nof the Leaden hall. This house, in the 9th of Richard II., pertained to\r\nSir Simon Burley, and Sir John Burley his brother; and of late the said\r\nhouse was taken down, and the forefront thereof new built of timber by\r\nHugh Offley, alderman. At the north-west corner of Lime Street was of\r\nold time one great messuage called Benbrige’s inn; Ralph Holland,\r\ndraper, about the year 1452 gave it to John Gill, master, and to the\r\nwardens and fraternity of tailors and linen-armourers of St. John\r\nBaptist in London, and to their successors for ever. They did set up in\r\nplace thereof a fair large frame of timber, containing in the high\r\nstreet one great house, and before it to the corner of Lime Street three\r\nother tenements, the corner house being the largest, and then down Lime\r\nStreet divers proper tenements; all which the merchant-tailors, in the\r\nreign of Edward VI., sold to Stephen Kirton, merchant-tailor and\r\nalderman: he gave, with his daughter Grisild, to Nicholas Woodroffe the\r\nsaid great house, with two tenements before it, in lieu of a hundred\r\npounds, and made it up in money £366 : 13 : 4. This worshipful man, and\r\nthe gentlewoman his widow after him, kept those houses down Lime Street\r\nin good reparations, never put out but one tenant, took no fines, nor\r\nraised rents of them, which was ten shillings the piece yearly: but\r\nwhether that favour did overlive her funeral, the tenants now can best\r\ndeclare the contrary.\r\n\r\n“Next unto this, on the high street, was the Lord Sowche’s messuage or\r\ntenement, and other; in place whereof, Richard Wethell, merchant-tailor,\r\nbuilt a fair house, with a high tower, the second in number, and first\r\nof timber, that ever I learnt to have been built to overlook neighbours\r\nin this city.\r\n\r\n“This Richard, then a young man, became in a short time so tormented\r\nwith gouts in his joints, of the hands and legs, that he could neither\r\nfeed himself nor go further than he was led; much less was he able to\r\nclimb and take the pleasure of the height of his tower. Then is there\r\nanother fair house, built by Stephen Kirton, alderman; Alderman Lee did\r\nthen possess it, and again new buildeth it; but now it is in the custody\r\nof Sir William Craven.\r\n\r\n“Then is there a fair house of old time called the Green gate; by which\r\nname one Michael Pistoy, a Lumbard held it, with a tenement and nine\r\nshops in the reign of Richard II., who in the 15th of his reign gave it\r\nto Roger Corphull, and Thomas Bromester, esquires, by the name of the\r\nGreen Gate, in the parish of St. Andrew upon Cornhill, in Lime Street\r\nward; since the which time Philip Malpas, sometime alderman, and one of\r\nthe sheriffs, dwelt therein, and was there robbed and spoiled of his\r\ngoods to a great value by Jack Cade, and other rebels, in the year 1449.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards, in the reign of Henry VII., it was seised into the King’s\r\nhands, and then granted, first, unto John Alston, after that unto\r\nWilliam de la Rivers, and since by Henry VIII. to John Mutas, a Picarde\r\nor Frenchman, who dwelt there, and harboured in his house many\r\nFrenchmen, that kalendred wolsteds, and did other things contrary to the\r\nfranchises of the citizens; wherefore on evil May-day, which was in the\r\nyear 1517, the apprentices and others spoiled his house; and if they\r\ncould have found Mutas, they would have stricken off his head. Sir Peter\r\nMutas, son to the said John Mutas, sold this house to David Woodroffe,\r\nalderman, whose son, Sir Nicholas Woodroffe, alderman, sold it over to\r\nJohn Moore, alderman, that then possessed it.\r\n\r\n“Next is a house called the Leaden porch, lately divided into two\r\ntenements; whereof one is a tavern, and then one other house for a\r\nmerchant, likewise called the leaden Porch, but now turned to a cook’s\r\nhouse. Next is a fair house and a large, wherein divers mayoralties have\r\nbeen kept, whereof twain in my remembrance; to wit, Sir William Bowyer\r\nand Sir Henry Huberthorne” (Stow’s _Survey_, pp. 162-163).\r\n\r\nIn modern Lime Street the first thing that attracts attention is an old\r\niron gateway leading to a little paved yard where once stood St. Dionis\r\nBackchurch. Laid in a horizontal row are nine tombstones, on which one\r\ncan look down. A steep flight of stone steps leads up to the parish\r\noffices, and the backs of business houses surround the court. At No. 15\r\nis the Pewterers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PEWTERERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The earliest information respecting the Company is found in the\r\n  records of the City of London, 22 Edward III., A.D. 1348, when the\r\n  mayor and aldermen are prayed by the good folk of the trade to hear\r\n  the state and points of the trade, to provide redress and amendment\r\n  of the defaults thereof for the common profit, and to ordain two or\r\n  three of the trade to oversee the alloys and workmanship.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1443 (22 Henry VI.), in consequence of the complaints of\r\n  “the multitude of tin which was untrue and deceyvable brought to the\r\n  City, the defaults not being perceptible until it comes to the\r\n  melting,” the mayor and aldermen granted to the Company the right to\r\n  search and assay all the tin which was brought into the City of\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n  Edward IV. (1473-74) incorporated the Company by royal charter.\r\n\r\n  This power was recognised and confirmed by charters granted\r\n  successively by Henry VIII., Philip and Mary, Queen Elizabeth, James\r\n  I., and Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n  An Act of Parliament confirming the Company’s powers to search for\r\n  bad wares was passed in 1503-1504, 19 Henry VII. c. 6., confirmed by\r\n  other Acts, 4 Henry VIII. c. 7., 1512-13; 25 Henry VIII. c. 9.,\r\n  1533-34; and a statute 33 Henry VIII. c. 4., 1541-42, prohibited the\r\n  hawking of pewter.\r\n\r\n  The maintenance of the good faith of the trade appears to have been\r\n  one of the primary considerations in the proceedings of the Company.\r\n\r\n  In 1555 it was resolved that any member buying metal of tylors,\r\n  labourers, boys, women, or suspected persons, or between six at\r\n  night and six in the morning, if the metal should prove to have been\r\n  stolen, should not only be dismissed the Company, but stand to such\r\n  punishment as the Lord Mayor and aldermen might direct.\r\n\r\n  The Company appear to have furnished a certain number of men with\r\n  arms for the defence of the City, and to have kept at the Hall\r\n  equipments for them—calyvers, corslets, bills, pikes, etc.—and to\r\n  have appointed an armourer to preserve them in good condition.\r\n\r\n  The Company used to cast into bars such tin as was to be transported\r\n  out of the realm, whereby the poor of the Company were wont to\r\n  provide for part of their living; but after these bars were made by\r\n  strangers beyond the sea, the poor were greatly “hindered.” A\r\n  petition was presented to Queen Elizabeth in 1594, and after a delay\r\n  of four years Letters Patent were granted to the Company, giving\r\n  permission for a small charge to be made on the smelting and casting\r\n  of bars of tin.\r\n\r\n  The fellowship of the craft and mystery of Pewterers of London and\r\n  elsewhere represented, before Henry VIII.’s reign, one of the best\r\n  handicrafts within the realm.\r\n\r\n  The master and wardens appear at the commencement of the seventeenth\r\n  century to have exercised the right to nominate the casters of tin\r\n  in London, and the Company received a small royalty on the casting,\r\n  which was distributed to the poor of the Company. They also appear\r\n  to have had from the Council of the Revenue of the Prince of Wales\r\n  an allotment of certain proportions of the tin produced in Cornwall,\r\n  and to have derived some profit from the privilege. In fact, the\r\n  pewter trade in London was supplied with tin from Cornwall through\r\n  the Company, and frequent disputations are recorded between the\r\n  Company and the Prince’s Council as to the rate, which was sometimes\r\n  said to be so high that the poor of the Company could not live\r\n  thereby.\r\n\r\n  At a later period the Company, in order to prevent the public from\r\n  imposition, and to sustain the credit of the pewterers’ trade,\r\n  appointed the standard assays of the various wares and the weight of\r\n  metal for each article.\r\n\r\n  The Hall stands upon a piece of ground presented to the Company by\r\n  W. Smallwood, Master, 1487. The first building was destroyed in the\r\n  Great Fire and the present one is that which replaced it.\r\n\r\n  The Company now have a livery of 103; a Corporate Income of £5400;\r\n  and a Trust Income of £233.\r\n\r\n  The Ordinances of the Pewterers were submitted to the mayor and\r\n  aldermen in 1348. They may be found in Riley (_Memorials_, 241).\r\n  They contain clauses similar to those in the ordinances of other\r\n  trades, including the power of appointing overseers of their own\r\n  body. Two years later we find a Pewterer named John de Hiltone\r\n  brought before the mayor on the charge of making “false”\r\n  salt-cellars and “potels.” The “false” vessels were forfeited. The\r\n  use of pewter for domestic purposes was universal. Dishes, plates,\r\n  basins, drinking cups, measures were all made of pewter. There are\r\n  luncheon-rooms in the City at the present day where steaks and chops\r\n  are served on pewter: at Lincoln’s Inn the dishes are still of\r\n  pewter; in the last century children and servants took their meals\r\n  off pewter. These facts explain the flourishing condition of the\r\n  Company and its large income.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  =St. Dionis Backchurch= was situated at the south-west corner of\r\n  Lime Street behind Fenchurch Street, from which position it probably\r\n  derived its name of Backchurch. It was burnt down by the Great Fire,\r\n  and rebuilt by Wren in 1674, and the steeple added in 1684. In 1878\r\n  this building was pulled down by an Order in Council. Part of the\r\n  money obtained from the site was given to the foundation of a new\r\n  church of St. Dionis at Parsons Green erected in 1885. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1288.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: In 1248, the Prior\r\n  and Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury; then the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of Canterbury 1552, in whose successors it continued up to 1878,\r\n  when the church was demolished and the parish annexed to Allhallows,\r\n  Lombard Street.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 405.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By John Carby, Alderman of London,\r\n  whose endowment fetched £13 in 1548, when James Servaunt was priest;\r\n  by Maude Bromeholme, whose endowment yielded £5 : 7 : 4 in 1548; by\r\n  John Wrotham, whose endowment was £15 : 7 : 4, when Nicholas\r\n  Metcalfe was chaplain.\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained a considerable number of monuments,\r\n  the most notable of which were in memory of John Hewet of the\r\n  Clothworkers Company and benefactor of the parish; Sir Robert\r\n  Jeffreys, Knt., Alderman and Lord Mayor of the City, who died in\r\n  1703; and Edward Tyson, M.D.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of charitable gifts were: Dame Elizabeth Clark,\r\n  £30; Robert Williams, £25, towards a bell; James Church, £10. Many\r\n  others gave various fittings for the church.\r\n\r\n  Lionel Gatford (d. 1665); Archdeacon of St. Alban’s, was rector\r\n  here; also Nathanial Hardy (1618-1670), Dean of Rochester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A REMARKABLE OLD HOUSE IN LEADENHALL STREET\r\n\r\n  From a drawing by S. Rawle. Published January 1801.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Leadenhall Street= was so named after the Leadenhall, _i.e._ the hall\r\ncovered with lead, which stood at the corner of that street and\r\nGracechurch Street. An early reference to the place is found in the\r\n_Calendar of Wills_ in the year 1296, when certain “rents near la\r\nLedenhalle in Gracechurch Street” are mentioned. The next reference does\r\nnot occur till the year 1369. But in Riley’s _Memorials_, we are told\r\nthat on the eve of St. John the Baptist, June 24, the mayor delivered to\r\nthe chamberlain “one silver mark arising from a certain small garden\r\nannexed to Leden Hall, which mark was taken ... for completing the\r\npavement belonging to the Court of Leaden Hall.” Riley gives a very\r\nbrief history of the place:\r\n\r\n“At the beginning of the 14th century, it was occasionally used as a\r\nCourt of Justice; see the MS. _Liber de Antiqu. Legibus_, at Guildhall,\r\nfol. 61. In October, 1326, after the flight of Edward II., the Commons\r\nof London met there, when making terms with the Constable of the Tower”\r\n(Riley, _Memorials_, p. 138).\r\n\r\nStow gives a long account of the various hands through which the _manor_\r\nof Leadenhall passed, confusing the hall with the manor on which it was\r\nbuilt. In the year 1411, according to Stow, the manor came into\r\npossession of the City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. H. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  LEADENHALL STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Then in the year 1443, the 21st of Henry VI., John Hatherley, mayor,\r\npurchased licence of the said king to take up two hundred fodder of\r\nlead, for the building of water conduits, a common granary, and the\r\ncross in West Chepe, more richly, for the honour of the City. In the\r\nyear next following, the parson and parish of St. Dunstan, in the east\r\nof London, seeing the famous and mighty man (for the words be in the\r\ngrant, _nobilis et potens vir_), Simon Eyre, citizen of London, among\r\nother his works of piety, effectually determined to erect and build a\r\ncertain granary upon the soil of the same city at Leadenhall, of his own\r\ncharges, for the common utility of the said city, to the amplifying and\r\nenlarging of the said granary, granted to Henry Frowicke, then mayor,\r\nthe aldermen and commonalty, and their successors for ever, all their\r\ntenements, with the appurtenances, sometime called the Horsemill, in\r\nGrasse Street, for the annual rent of four pounds, etc. Also, certain\r\nevidences of an alley and tenements pertaining to the Horsemill\r\nadjoining to the said Leaden hall in Grasse Street, given by William\r\nKingstone, fishmonger, unto the parish church of St. Peter upon\r\nCornehill, do specify the said granary to be built by the said\r\nhonourable and famous merchant, Simon Eyre, sometime an upholsterer, and\r\nthen a draper, in the year 1419. He built it of squared stone, in form\r\nas now it showeth, with a fair and large chapel in the east side of the\r\nquadrant, over the porch of which he caused to be written, _Dextra\r\nDomini exaltavit me_ (The Lord’s right hand exalted me). Within the said\r\nchurch on the north wall, was written, _Honorandus famosus mercator\r\nSimon Eyre hujus operis_, etc. In English thus: ‘The honourable and\r\nfamous merchant, Simon Eyre, founder of this work, once mayor of this\r\nCity, citizen and draper of the same, departed out of this life, the\r\n18th day of September, the year from the incarnation of Christ 1459, and\r\nthe 38th year of the reign of King Henry VI.’” (Stow’s _Survey_, p.\r\n162).\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the fourteenth century Leadenhall had become a\r\nmarket for poultry. In 1345 it was ordered that strange folk, _i.e._\r\npeople from outside the City, bringing poultry for sale should no longer\r\nhawk it about from house to house, but should take it to the Leaden\r\nHall, and should there sell it, and nowhere else. Also that citizens who\r\nsell poultry should offer it on the west side of the Tun of Cornhill\r\n(Riley, pp. 220, 221).\r\n\r\nThe market was not, however, confined to the sale of poultry, as is\r\nproved by the following request of the commons of the City, in the year\r\n1503:\r\n\r\n“Please it, the lord mayor, aldermen and common council, to enact, that\r\nall Frenchmen bringing canvass, linen cloth, and other wares to be sold,\r\nand all foreigners bringing wolsteds, sayes, Stamins, Kiverings, nails,\r\niron work, or any other wares, and also all manner of foreigners\r\nbringing lead to the city to be sold, shall bring all such their wares\r\naforesaid to the open market of the Leaden Hall, there and no where else\r\nto be sold and uttered, like as of old time it hath been used, upon pain\r\nof forfeiture of all the said wares showed or sold in any other place\r\nthan aforesaid; the show of the said wares to be made three days in the\r\nweek, that is to say, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; it is also thought\r\nreasonable that the common beam be kept henceforth in the Leaden Hall,\r\nand the farmer to pay therefore reasonable rent to the chamber; for\r\nbetter it is that the chamber have advantage thereby than a foreign\r\nperson; and also the said Leaden Hall, which is more chargeable now by\r\nhalf than profitable, shall better bear out the charges thereof; also\r\nthe common beam for wool at Leaden Hall, may yearly pay a rent to the\r\nchamber of London, toward supportation and charges of the same place;\r\nfor reason it is, that a common office, occupied upon a common ground,\r\nbear a charge to the use of the commonalty; also, that foreigners\r\nbringing wools, felts, or any other merchandises or wares to Leaden\r\nHall, to be kept there for the sale and market, may pay more largely for\r\nthe keeping of their goods than free men” (Stow’s _Survey_, p. 164).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SKIN MARKET, LEADENHALL, 1825\r\n]\r\n\r\nA granary was kept at Leaden Hall, the use of which depended entirely on\r\nthe forethought of the mayor. Thus, in 1512, Roger Acheley, the mayor,\r\nfound that there were not one hundred quarters of wheat in all the\r\ngarners of the City. He took immediate steps, and not only imported\r\nwheat for present necessities, but also filled the granaries of the\r\nCity. Stow adds a note as to the activity of the mayor: “He kept the\r\nmarket so well, that he would be at the Leaden Hall by four o’clock in\r\nthe summer mornings; and thence he went to other markets, to the great\r\ncomfort of the citizens.”\r\n\r\nIn 1529 a petition was presented by the Commons to the Common Council on\r\nthe uses to which Leaden Hall might be put. It should not be let out to\r\nfarm to any person or to any Company incorporate for any time of years,\r\nand they proceeded to give their reasons.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1534 an effort was made to convert Leadenhall into a\r\nBurse. This failed, and the Burse continued to be held in Lombard Street\r\nuntil the building of the Royal Exchange. This is interesting, because\r\nit shows that Gresham was not alone in desiring to have a convenient\r\nbuilding for the meeting of the merchants.\r\n\r\n“The use of Leaden Hall in my youth (says Stow) was thus:—In a part of\r\nthe north quadrant, on the east side of the north gate, were the common\r\nbeams for weighing of wool and other wares, as had been accustomed; on\r\nthe west side of the gate were the scales to weigh meal; the other three\r\nsides were reserved for the most part to the making and resting of the\r\npageants showed at Midsummer in the watch; the remnant of the sides and\r\nquadrants was employed for the stowage of wool sacks, but not closed up;\r\nthe lofts above were partly used by the painters in working for the\r\ndecking of pageants and other devices, for beautifying of the watch and\r\nwatch-men; the residue of the lofts were letten out to merchants, the\r\nwool winders and packers therein to wind and pack their wools” (p. 166).\r\n\r\nThe market in 1754 is thus described by Strype:\r\n\r\n“Leadenhall is a very large building of Free-stone, containing within it\r\nthree large Courts or Yards, all encompassed with buildings, wherein is\r\nkept a market, one of the greatest, the best, and the most general for\r\nall provisions in the City of London, nay of the Kingdom; and, if I\r\nshould say of all Europe, I should not give it too great a praise. The\r\nbuilding hath flat battlements leaded at the top; and, for the\r\nconveniency of People’s coming to this great market, which is kept every\r\nday of the week, except Sundays, for one thing or the other, besides the\r\nprincipal entrance out of Leadenhall Street, there are two or three\r\nothers, one out of Lime Street, and the rest out of Gracechurch Street.\r\n\r\n“Of the three Courts or Yards that it consists of, the first is that at\r\nthe north-east corner of Gracechurch Street, and opens into Leadenhall\r\nStreet; this court or yard contains, in length, from north to south, one\r\nhundred and sixty-four feet, and, in breadth, from east to west, eighty\r\nfeet; within this court or yard, round about the same, are about one\r\nhundred standing stalls for butchers for the selling only of beef, and\r\ntherefore this court is called the Beef Market, many of which stalls are\r\neight, ten, or twelve feet long, and four, five, or six feet broad, with\r\nracks, hooks, blocks, and all other conveniences for the sale of their\r\nmeat: All which stalls are either under warehouses above head, or\r\nsheltered from the weather by roofs over them. This yard is, on\r\nTuesdays, a market for leather, to which the tanners do resort. On\r\nThursdays the waggons from Colchester, and other parts, come with Baiz,\r\netc., and also the Felmongers with their wool; and on Fridays it is a\r\nmarket for raw hides, besides Saturdays for Beef, as also other\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n“The second market-yard is called the Green yard, as being once a green\r\nPlat of Ground. Afterwards it was the City’s Store-yard for Materials\r\nfor building, and the like, but now a market only for veal, mutton,\r\nlamb, etc. This yard is one hundred and seventy feet in length, from\r\neast to west, and ninety feet broad from north to south: It hath in it\r\none hundred and forty stalls for the butchers, all covered over, and of\r\nthe bigness of those in the beef-market. In the middle of this Green\r\nyard Market, north to south, is a row of shops, with kitchens, or rooms\r\nover them, for fishmongers; and, also, on the south side and west end,\r\nare houses and shops also for fishmongers. Towards the east end of this\r\nyard is erected a fair market-house, standing upon columns, with vaults\r\nunderneath, and rooms above, with a bell-tower and a clock, and under it\r\nare butchers’ stalls. The tenements round about this yard are, for the\r\nmost part, inhabited by cooks, victuallers, and such-like; and, in the\r\npassages leading out of the streets, into this market, are fishmongers,\r\npoulterers, cheesemongers, and such-like traders for provision.\r\n\r\n“The third market belonging to Leadenhall is called the Herb Market, for\r\nthat herbs, roots, fruits, etc., are only there sold. This market is\r\nabout one hundred and forty feet square; the west, east, and south sides\r\nhave walks round them, covered over for shelter, and standing upon\r\ncolumns; in which walks there are twenty-eight stalls for gardeners,\r\nwith cellars under them. There is also, in this yard, one range of\r\nstalls covered over for such as sell tripe, neats-feet, sheeps-trotters,\r\netc., and, on the south side, the tenements are taken up by Victuallers,\r\nCheesemongers, Butchers, Poulterers, and such-like.\r\n\r\n“The rooms in the stone building about the beef-market, which is\r\nproperly Leadenhall, are employed for several uses, as the west side was\r\nwholly used for the stowage of wares belonging to the East-India\r\nCompany; on the east side is the meal-warehouse and the Wool-hall; on\r\nthe south end is the Colchester Baiz-hall, and at the north end is the\r\nwarehouse for the sealing of leather.\r\n\r\n“The general conflagration of this city, in 1666, terminated in that\r\npart of the City near adjoining to this hall; all the houses about it,\r\nand within the yards belonging to it, being destroyed, there did, of\r\nthis fabric, only remain the stonework; since which, the Courts and\r\nyards belonging to this building, and some other adjacent grounds\r\npurchased by the City, are wholly converted into a market for the City’s\r\nuse; the place for the reception of Country butchers, and others who\r\nbrought provisions before to the City, being then only in Leadenhall\r\nStreet, between Gracechurch Street and Lime Street, which was very\r\nincommodious to the market people, as well as to the passengers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEADENHALL CHAPEL IN 1812\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Leadenhall Market= is in four rays of varying lengths; the longest is\r\nabout 80 feet, the shortest about 30. These are covered in by a wide\r\narched roof of glass, supported by girders, and are about 30 feet wide.\r\nAt each entrance there is a similar design. On either side a couple of\r\nmassive fluted columns are surmounted by griffins, which support the\r\narch. These are decorated with gilt. Over the entry is an arch of great\r\nheight, with a stone relief, and on the frieze below the words\r\n“Leadenhall Market.” The market was built in 1881, designed by Sir\r\nHorace Jones, and is occupied to a very great extent by poulterers and\r\nbutchers. There are roughly about fifty holdings and two taverns, the\r\nLamb and the Half Moon.\r\n\r\nThere was a chapel in the market, to which was attached a Fraternity of\r\nthe Trinity of sixty priests, with other brethren and sisters, in which\r\nservice was celebrated every day.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was taken down in 1812 (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p.\r\n373).\r\n\r\nIn Leadenhall Street have been found Roman remains, a pavement, pottery,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nA crypt existed under the house 153 Leadenhall Street until 1896, when\r\nit was destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CRYPT IN LEADENHALL STREET, 1825\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Under the corner house of Leadenhall and Bishopsgate Streets, and two\r\nhouses on the east, and one on the north, side thereof, was situate a\r\nvery ancient church of Gothic construction, the principal part of which\r\nis still remaining under the said corner house, and two adjoining in\r\nLeadenhall Street; but part of the north aisle beneath the house\r\ncontiguous in Bishopsgate Street, was lately obliged to make way to\r\nenlarge the cellar. When or by whom this old church was founded I cannot\r\nlearn, it not being so much as mentioned by any of our historians or\r\nsurveyors of London that I can discover.\r\n\r\n“Some other ancient architectural remains, perhaps originally connected\r\nwith the former, were also found under the houses extending up the\r\neastern site of Bishopsgate Street. The description of their situation,\r\ngiven by Maitland, fixes their locality to the side of the very house at\r\nwhich the fire of 1765 commenced; and which appears to have continued\r\nuntil that time in the same kind of occupation as it was when the\r\nensuing account of these ruins was written. ‘At the distance of 12 feet\r\nfrom this church,’—namely the remains already noticed at the north-east\r\ncorner of Leadenhall Street—‘is to be seen, under the house at the late\r\nMr. Macadam’s, a peruke-maker in Bishopsgate Street, a stone building of\r\nthe length of 30 feet, breadth of 14, and altitude of 8 feet 6 inches\r\nabove the present floor; with a door in the north-side, and a window at\r\nthe east end, as there probably was one in the west. It is covered with\r\na semi-circular arch, built with small piers of chalk in the form of\r\nbricks, and ribbed with stone, resembling those of the arches of a\r\nbridge. What this edifice at first was appropriated to is very\r\nuncertain; though, by the manner of its construction, it seems to have\r\nbeen a chapel; but the ground having been since raised on all sides, it\r\nwas probably converted into a subterraneous repository for merchandise;\r\nfor a pair of stone stairs, with a descending arch over them, seems to\r\nhave been erected since the fabric was built’” (Wilkinson, _Londina\r\nIllustrata_).\r\n\r\nThe most important house in the street next to the Leadenhall itself was\r\nthe East India House, which stood near to the Hall. The Company first\r\nmet, according to tradition, at the Nag’s Head Tavern, Bishopsgate; they\r\nthen had a house in Leadenhall Street; they took on lease in\r\n1701—perhaps it was their first house—Sir William Craven’s large house\r\nin Leadenhall Street, with a tenement in Lime Street. This is probably\r\nthe house pictured in a print in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIn 1726 the “Old” East India House was built, of which several parts\r\nwere retained in the new buildings of 1799.\r\n\r\nHardly any part of the City, unless it be the south of Cornhill, is so\r\nhoneycombed with courts and passages as the quarter upon which we are\r\nnow engaged. For the most part they are not distinguished by any\r\nhistorical associations. Some of them formerly contained taverns and\r\ninns. The courts are greatly diminished in size; some of them were\r\nnarrow lanes with houses standing face to face, a few feet apart; some\r\nof them formerly contained gentlemen’s houses. Why were these houses\r\nbuilt in a court? The explanation is easy. The town-house of noble or\r\nmerchant was built like a college: a gateway with a chamber over it in\r\nfront, rooms beside the gate in case of a nobleman with a retinue; in\r\nother cases a wall enclosing a garden in a square, on either side rooms,\r\nat the back the Hall and what we call reception rooms, with the private\r\nrooms of the family. When land became more valuable the rooms beside the\r\ngateway became shops, then there was building at the back of the shops,\r\nthe sides became contracted, and there were left at last only the court,\r\nthe gateway, and the house beyond. There are several places in the City\r\nwhere this history of a house may be traced, the modern offices being\r\nbuilt on the site of the old foundation, the gateway having disappeared,\r\nand the court still remaining.\r\n\r\n“Anno 1136. A very great fire happened in the City, which began in the\r\nhouse of one Ailward, near London Stone, and consumed all the way east\r\nto Aldgate, and west to St. Erkenwald’s shrine in St. Paul’s Cathedral,\r\nboth which it destroyed, together with London Bridge, which was then\r\nconstructed of wood.\r\n\r\n“It is reasonable to conjecture, that the accumulation of ruins these\r\nextensive fires occasioned left the distressed inhabitants little choice\r\nin their determination; and as it would have caused infinite trouble and\r\ninconvenience to have cleared and removed the same, they wisely\r\npreferred sacrificing a few (to them) useless buildings, raised and\r\nlevelled the ground, and began a foundation for new dwellings on the\r\nsite of the roofs of some of their remaining habitations. The amazing\r\ndescent to the banks of the Thames from several parts of the City\r\nconfirms the opinion that most of the buildings denominated crypts,\r\noratories, or undercrofts, were, in their pristine states, level in\r\ntheir foundations with the dwelling-places of their original builders.\r\nWhat greatly adds to the probability is the circumstance of our being\r\ninformed that near Belzeter’s Lane (Billiter Lane) and Lime Street,\r\nthree new houses being to be built, in the year 1590, in a place where\r\nwas a large garden plot enclosed from the street by a high brick wall,\r\nupon taking down the said wall and digging for cellarage, another wall\r\nof stone was found directly under the brick wall with an arched gateway\r\nof stone, and gates of timber to be closed in the midst towards the\r\nstreet. The timber of the gates was consumed, but the hinges of iron\r\nwere then remaining on their staples on both sides: moreover, in that\r\nwall were square windows with bars of iron on each side this gate. The\r\nwall was above two fathoms deep under the ground, supposed to be the\r\nremains of those great fires before mentioned. Again, we learn, on the\r\neast side of Lime Street opening into Fenchurch Street, on that site,\r\nafter the fire of 1666, Sir Thomas Cullum built thirty houses, and that\r\na short time previous to 1757, the cellar of one of the houses giving\r\nway, there was discovered an arched room, ten feet square and eight feet\r\ndeep, with several arched doors round it stopped up with earth”\r\n(Wilkinson, _Londina Illustrata_, vol. ii. p. 43).\r\n\r\nIn 1660 the mayor, Sir Thomas Allen, resided in Leadenhall Street and\r\nentertained Monk. At the corner of St. Mary Axe stood, in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the town-house of the De Veres, Earls of Oxford.\r\n\r\nGibbon’s great-grandfather, one of the last of the younger sons of\r\ncounty families who came to London and went into trade, had his shop as\r\na draper in Leadenhall Street.\r\n\r\nIn this street Peter Anthony Motteux, translator of _Don Quixote_, kept\r\nan “East India” shop. He was a Huguenot, and could speak and understand\r\nmany languages. He was also employed as a linguist at the Post Office.\r\nIn addition to his shop and his office, he worked as a poet and man of\r\nletters generally; being the author of plays, prologues, and epilogues.\r\nHe is best known by his completion of Urquhart’s _Translation of\r\nRabelais_. He was a loose liver, and died in a disorderly house in St.\r\nClement Danes. Like the lady of Père la Chaise, “Resigned unto the\r\nHeavenly Will, His wife kept on the business still.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. KATHERINE CREE\r\n\r\n  St. Katherine Cree, in Leadenhall Street, is on the site of the\r\n  cemetery of the Priory of Holy Trinity, whence it derives its name\r\n  Creechurch or Christchurch. This priory is said to have been built\r\n  in the same place where Siredus sometime began to erect a church in\r\n  honour of the Cross and of St. Mary Magdalen. This ancient church\r\n  contributed thirty shillings to the Dean and Chapter of Waltham. The\r\n  abbey church here is also dedicated to the Holy Cross, and when\r\n  Matilda founded Christ Church or Trinity she gave to the Church of\r\n  Waltham a mill instead of this payment. But little is known of the\r\n  building of Siredus; but Matilda’s Priory is said to have occupied\r\n  parts of the parishes of St. Mary Magdalen, St. Michael, St.\r\n  Katherine, and the Blessed Trinity, which now was made but one\r\n  parish of the Holy Trinity, and was in old time of the Holy Cross or\r\n  Holy Rood parish. At this time, therefore (1108), the old parish of\r\n  the Holy Rood had disappeared, and four parishes appear on its site.\r\n  In the perambulation of the old soke of the Priory we find the\r\n  parishes of Coleman Church (St. Katherine), St. Michael, St. Andrew\r\n  (Undershaft), and of the Trinity (now St. James’s, Duke’s Place),\r\n  but St. Mary Magdalen and Holy Rood are not mentioned. This loss of\r\n  St. Mary Magdalen is not easily explained. Could the Church of St.\r\n  Andrew have been dedicated formerly to St. Mary Magdalen? Such\r\n  changes in dedication are known, and, even in this ward or soke,\r\n  Stow tells us that St. Katherine Coleman was called St. Katherine\r\n  and All Saints.\r\n\r\n  This would make up all the parishes which are given at the several\r\n  periods in this locality. The existence of St. Katherine Coleman and\r\n  St. Katherine Cree as two distinct parishes adjoining is remarkable.\r\n  The parish of St. Katherine Coleman belonged to the ancient\r\n  establishment of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and so remained until the\r\n  Dissolution. Was it a part of this parish which was taken into the\r\n  precinct of the Trinity? The inhabitants of the enclosed parish of\r\n  Cree Church at first used the Priory church, but it was agreed\r\n  afterwards that they should have a church erected, and use the\r\n  Priory church only at certain times. This would be what we might\r\n  expect of a part of a parish detached at the establishment of the\r\n  Priory, but which desired to be released from the control of the\r\n  prior, and to be a parish of itself, with its own church. We must\r\n  not confound the parish of St. Mary Magdalen with a small parish of\r\n  St. Mary the Virgin, St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins. This was on\r\n  the west side of St. Mary Axe, and belonged to the Priory of St.\r\n  Helen. The church was destroyed, and the parish united, by Edmund\r\n  Grindal, Bishop of London, to St. Andrew, Undershaft, in the year\r\n  1561.\r\n\r\n  The parishioners had been allowed to worship at an altar in the\r\n  Priory church, but this being inconvenient, St. Katherine’s was\r\n  built through the agency of Richard de Gravesend, Bishop of London,\r\n  1280-1303. It was rebuilt in 1628-1630, possibly after the design of\r\n  Inigo Jones. The steeple, which was built in the early sixteenth\r\n  century, is still standing. The church was consecrated by Laud in\r\n  1631. In 1874 the parish of St. James’s, Duke’s Place, was annexed.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1436.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of which was in the hands of the Prior and Canons of\r\n  Holy Trinity, London. Henry VIII. seized it in 1540, and soon after\r\n  granted it to Sir Thomas Audley, who gave it, by his will dated\r\n  April 19, 1544, to the Master and Fellows of Magdalene College,\r\n  Cambridge, in whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 542.\r\n\r\n  The church is a mixture of the Gothic and classical styles. It\r\n  contains two narrow aisles separated from the nave by Corinthian\r\n  columns and round arches, above which is a clerestory. The roof is\r\n  groined, and the arms of the City and several City Companies are\r\n  displayed on it. The building is 94 feet long, 51 feet broad, and 37\r\n  feet high. It is larger than the original church, of which the sole\r\n  relic now existing is a pillar at the south-west, less than three\r\n  feet above ground, owing to the higher level of the new church. The\r\n  stone steeple rises at the west and consists of a tower surmounted\r\n  by a Tuscan colonnade with a cupola and vane; its total height is 75\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here at the Altar of St. Michael.\r\n\r\n  The church is not rich in historical monuments. It contains,\r\n  however, the tomb of Nicholas Throckmorton, Chief Butler of England\r\n  and intimate friend of Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  Tradition said that Hans Holbein was buried here, but there is no\r\n  evidence for it except that he died in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n  There is a brass in the floor in front of the communion table,\r\n  commemorating Sir John Gayer, Lord Mayor in 1646 and staunch\r\n  adherent of Charles I., for which he suffered imprisonment.\r\n\r\n  At the west end there is a bas-relief to Samuel Thorpe (died 1791):\r\n  this is only interesting as being the work of the elder Bacon.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Gayer bequeathed £200 for charitable purposes, amongst them\r\n  a fee for a sermon to be preached on October 16 annually, and though\r\n  the charity is now diverted, yet the “Lion sermon,” in commemoration\r\n  of the donor’s delivery from a lion in Arabia, is still kept up.\r\n\r\n  There was a charity school at the end of Cree Church Lane, in which\r\n  forty boys were clothed and taught, by subscriptions from the\r\n  inhabitants of the ward.\r\n\r\n  Roger Maynwaring (1590-1653), Bishop of St. David’s, was a perpetual\r\n  curate here; also Nicholas Brady (1659-1726), joint author of Tate\r\n  and Brady’s version of the Psalter.\r\n\r\nThe north of Leadenhall Street between St. Katherine Cree and Aldgate,\r\nfrom the year 1130 and the suppression of the Religious Houses, was\r\ncovered with the buildings of the Priory of the Holy Trinity already\r\ndescribed (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 241).\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the Priory were given by the King to Sir Thomas Audley\r\nin 1531 after the surrender.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Suffolk, son of the Duke who was beheaded in 1572, sold the\r\nhouse and precinct to the City of London, and built Audley End in Essex.\r\nThe City seems to have pulled down the mansion and laid out the grounds\r\nin streets and courts. The disposition of these seems to preserve, to a\r\ncertain extent, that of the old Priory.\r\n\r\nWhen the people began to settle in the precinct, they found themselves,\r\nalthough so close to St. Katherine Cree, without a parish church. They\r\ntherefore petitioned the Archbishop of Canterbury, who obtained\r\npermission of the King to build a new church here, and to erect a new\r\nparish. The church was finished and dedicated to St. James in 1622. The\r\nmemory of the consecration is described at length by Strype. This\r\nquarter was assigned to the Jews by Oliver Cromwell in 1650. Here is the\r\nGreat Synagogue of the German Jews.\r\n\r\nSt. James’s was one of the most notorious of the many places for\r\nirregular marriages, those without licence, because as standing in the\r\nancient precinct of the Priory it was without the jurisdiction of the\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\n  =St. James’s, Duke’s Place=, escaped the Great Fire of 1666.\r\n\r\n  In 1873 the church was pulled down and its parish united with that\r\n  of St. Katherine Cree Church. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1622.\r\n\r\n  This church was in the gift of the Lord Mayor and Commonalty of\r\n  London from 1622.\r\n\r\n  Few monuments, and none of much note, are recorded by Stow. Booker,\r\n  an astrologer, was commemorated by a stone inscription.\r\n\r\n  Sir Edward Barkham is the only benefactor whose name is recorded by\r\n  Stow.\r\n\r\nThe modern Leadenhall Street is at the west end full of fine,\r\nwell-executed Chambers. Of these, New Zealand Chambers are the most\r\nnoticeable. The building is by R. Norman Shaw in the pseudo-ancient\r\nstyle. It was erected in 1872, and is carried out in red brick. The\r\nbayed windows on either side of the entrance are placed in wide recesses\r\nwhich run right up the frontage. Africa House is in a commonplace style,\r\nbut has rather good stone panels on the front. On the north Leadenhall\r\nHouse is solidly faced in granite, with granite columns on the frontage.\r\nWest India House is neatly built in white stone.\r\n\r\nFarther eastward the street is singularly dull; it is lined at first by\r\ndreary blocks of imitation stone buildings. These are succeeded by brick\r\nbuildings all turned out of the same mould. The north side is better\r\nthan the south, and is chiefly made up of solid, well-built houses on\r\nvarious designs.\r\n\r\nAt No. 153 the ground-floor is occupied by a bric-à-brac shop. Below the\r\nparapet there is a curious triangular pediment let into the brickwork.\r\nThis encloses a round stone with an inscription on it, of which the\r\nfirst word seems to be “incendio”; on either side is a small shelf.\r\n\r\nThe London Joint Stock Bank is a few doors off. No. 140, an Aerated\r\nBread Shop, is fantastically built, in imitation of an old style. The\r\nPeninsular & Oriental Steamship Company is in a stone and terra-cotta\r\nbuilding, with well-designed figures in slight relief in the corners of\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\n=Aldgate=, spelt otherwise Alegate or Algate, was probably, but not\r\ncertainly, opened and constructed by Queen Matilda, Consort of Henry I.,\r\nwho is also said to have built the bridge over the Lea at Bow. There\r\nseems no reason for doubting the story.\r\n\r\nOn the spelling of the name Professor Skeat writes, September 18, 1897:\r\n\r\n“It occurs to me to say that in any case of interpreting spellings, the\r\ndate of the spelling is of the greatest service. We now know the\r\nmeanings of all the vowel symbols at all dates. If we can obtain a few\r\nearly spellings of Aldgate, with approximate dates, we ought to be able\r\nto decide it. We have to remember that _all_, in composition meant\r\n‘wholly,’ and was adverbial as in Al-mighty, and ‘wholly gate’ gives no\r\nsense. If ‘for all’ were intended, it would be _alra_, _aller_, or\r\n_alder_, the genitive of plural. This is not a question of etymology but\r\nof grammar. On the other hand, if the M.E. _Ald_ [now spelt _Old_] were\r\nmeant, I have proof that a Norman scribe would be apt to omit the _d_;\r\nso that _Alegate_ would, in fact, be quite regular. And it would _not_\r\nnecessarily become _Oldgate_ in course of time; just as Acton, though it\r\nmeans _Oaktown_, is called Acton still. This is due to what we call the\r\npreservation of a short or shortened vowel, owing to stress.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, writing on 21st September, he says:\r\n\r\n“The list of spellings which you send me is most interesting, but it is\r\nnot easy to explain it. I can remember a time when I should have drawn\r\nthe conclusion that they are very much against connecting the word with\r\nthe Old Mercian _ald_, which we now spell _old_. But my recent\r\ninvestigations tell the other way; not only were perfectly common words\r\npersistently (but regularly) mis-spelt in Domesday and early charters,\r\nfrom the time of the Conquest till about 1350, but in many instances (as\r\nwould likely be the case in official documents) such habits became\r\nstereotyped. The early scribes were nearly all Norman, and they brought\r\nin Norman spelling to that extent that the whole of modern English is\r\npervaded by it; indeed, no one who does not know the phonetic laws of\r\nAnglo-French can explain why the word _house_ is spelt with _ou_, or the\r\nword _build_ with _ui_.... The explanation of the spelling Ald in 1270\r\nis probably simply this: that this particular charter (contrary to\r\npractice) was entrusted to an English scribe. It is a simple\r\nsupposition—English spellings began to prevail in these matters in the\r\nperiod from 1350-1400, and it is just here that we get two instances.\r\nThe Normans learnt Latin easily: to an English scribe it was a foreign\r\nlanguage. This is why the French scribes were preferred for writing\r\nLatin documents. After 1400 such French spellings as affect the true\r\nsound are rare; this is why, after that the E. form prevails. But we\r\nmust remember that many Englishmen do not fully pronounce the _d_ in\r\n_Aldgate_ even now, but slur it over; and in days of phonetic spelling\r\nsuch things were reproduced. I should say the evidence can only be\r\nexplained, on the _whole_, from the supposition that the English word\r\nwas _Ald_, preserved in composition instead of being turned into _old_\r\n(as it did when standing alone); and this will explain _eald_ also, as\r\n_eald_ is the Wessex form of _Ald_, adopted in 1598 as a mere bit of\r\npedantry, but at the same time showing that the belief then prevailed.\r\nThis is all I have to say about Aldgate.”\r\n\r\nThe gate was rebuilt by Norman, first Prior of Holy Trinity. The\r\nweigh-house for weighing corn was in the gateway.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire, Aldgate was used for the prisoners who had been confined\r\nin the Poultry Compter.\r\n\r\nIn 1374 the gate was let on lease to Geoffrey Chaucer. Here followeth\r\nthe lease itself:\r\n\r\n“To all persons to whom this present writing indented shall come, Adam\r\nde Bury, Mayor, the Aldermen, and the Commonalty of the City of London,\r\ngreeting. Know ye that we, with unanimous will and assent, have granted\r\nand released by these presents unto Geoffrey Chaucer the whole of the\r\ndwelling-house above the gate of Algate, with the rooms built over, and\r\na certain cellar beneath, the same gate, on the South side of that gate,\r\nand the appurtenances thereof; to have and to hold the whole of the\r\nhouse aforesaid, with the rooms so built over, and the said cellar, and\r\nthe appurtenances thereof, unto the aforesaid Geoffrey, for the whole\r\nlife of him, the said Geoffrey. And the said Geoffrey shall maintain and\r\nrepair the whole of the house aforesaid, and the rooms thereof, so often\r\nas shall be requisite, in all things necessary thereto, competently and\r\nsufficiently, at the expense of the same Geoffrey, throughout the whole\r\nlife of him, the same Geoffrey. And it shall be lawful for the\r\nChamberlain of the Guildhall of London, for the time being, so often as\r\nhe shall see fit, to enter the house and rooms aforesaid, with their\r\nappurtenances, to see that the same are well and competently, and\r\nsufficiently, maintained and repaired, as aforesaid. And if the said\r\nGeoffrey shall not have maintained or repaired the aforesaid house and\r\nrooms competently and sufficiently, as is before stated, within forty\r\ndays after the time when by the same Chamberlain he shall have been\r\nrequired so to do, it shall be lawful for the said Chamberlain wholly to\r\noust the before-named Geoffrey therefrom, and to re-seise and resume the\r\nsame house, rooms, and cellar, with their appurtenances, into the hand\r\nof the City, to the use of the Commonalty aforesaid; and to hold the\r\nsame in their former state to the use of the same Commonalty, without\r\nany gainsaying whatsoever thereof. And it shall not be lawful for the\r\nsaid Geoffrey to let the house, rooms, and cellar, aforesaid, or any\r\npart thereof, or his interest therein, to any person whatsoever. And we,\r\nthe Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty aforesaid, will not cause any gaol\r\nto be made thereof, for the safekeeping of prisoners therein, during the\r\nlife of the said Geoffrey; but we and our successors will warrant the\r\nsame house, rooms, and cellar, with their appurtenances, unto the\r\nbefore-named Geoffrey, for the whole life of him, the same Geoffrey, in\r\nform aforesaid: this however excepted, that in time of defence of the\r\ncity aforesaid, so often as it shall be necessary, it shall be lawful\r\nfor us and our successors to enter the said house and rooms, and to\r\norder and dispose of the same, for such time, and in such manner, as\r\nshall then seem to us to be most expedient. And after the decease of the\r\nsame Geoffrey, the house, rooms, and cellar aforesaid, with their\r\nappurtenances, shall wholly revert unto us and our successors. In\r\nwitness whereof, as well the Common Seal of the City aforesaid as the\r\nseal of the said Geoffrey, have been to these present indentures\r\ninterchangeably appended. Given in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the\r\nCity aforesaid, the 10th day of May, in the 48th year of the reign of\r\nKing Edward, after the Conquest the Third” (Riley’s _Memorials_, pp.\r\n377-378).\r\n\r\n“This,” says Stow, “is one and the first of the four principal gates,\r\nand also one of the seven double gates, mentioned by Fitzstephen. It\r\nhath had two pair of gates, though now but one; the hooks remaineth yet.\r\nAlso there hath been two portcloses; the one of them remaineth, the\r\nother wanteth, but the place of letting down is manifest.”\r\n\r\n“This gate being very ruinous, was pulled down Anno 1606; when, in\r\ndigging for a new foundation, divers Roman coins were discovered, two of\r\nwhich Mr. Bond, the Surveyor, caused to be cut in stone, and placed in\r\nthe east front on each side the passage. The first stone of this edifice\r\nwas laid Anno 1607, at the depth of sixteen feet, and finished Anno\r\n1609.\r\n\r\n“Here was only one postern, and that on the north side, for\r\nfoot-passengers; and a water-conduit at the south-east angle thereof;\r\nbut the last being disused for many years, two houses were erected in\r\nlieu of it, in the year 1734, and a postern made on the south side of\r\nthe gate. The apartments over this gate are appropriated to the use of\r\none of the Lord Mayor’s Carvers, and at present are lett to the Charity\r\nSchool founded by Sir John Cash” (Maitland, vol. i. pp. 22-23).\r\n\r\nThe gate was taken down in 1761.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. H. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  ALDGATE IN 1830\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1291, Thomas de Alegate leaves to his wife Eleanor, his houses within\r\nAlegate (_Calendar of Wills_). The street is often mentioned afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe ward of Aldgate in the year 1276 was called the ward of John of\r\nNorthampton, the then alderman. There was a hermitage on the south side\r\nof the gate within a garden; the garden was let, in 1325, to one Peter a\r\n“blader,” or corn merchant. It is not stated whether the hermitage was\r\nthen occupied. There were houses beside the gate in 1354. The Prior of\r\nHoly Trinity, Aldgate, was alderman _ex officio_ of Portsoken Ward; in\r\n1378 we find him sworn to fill the office “and faithfully to do all\r\nthings touching that office.”\r\n\r\nIn 1349, the _Calendar of Wills_ speaks of tenements in “Algate Street.”\r\nRoman remains have been found in Aldgate; at the gate there was a\r\n“Roomland”; without the gate was a great pit for the burial of those who\r\ndied of the plague. In 1315 Sir John de Sandale, leaving London on\r\nbusiness of the King, put the Great Seal into the custody of Sir William\r\nde Ayremynn at his inn near Aldgate. In the same year he received at his\r\ninn Edward de Baliol, newly returned from beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the street, under a house facing the pump, was still\r\nto be seen, until 1868, a crypt formerly supposed to have been that of\r\nan ancient church, dedicated to St. Michael and taken down when the\r\nPriory of the Holy Trinity was first founded.\r\n\r\nThis handsome Gothic structure, which is situated between the east end\r\nof Leadenhall and Fenchurch Streets, under the houses fronting the pump\r\nat Aldgate, is still remaining entire, exhibiting a most beautiful\r\nspecimen of ancient architecture.\r\n\r\nIt is shown (_L. & M. Archæological Journal_, iv. p. 223 _et seq._) that\r\nthe crypt could not have been that of St. Michael’s Church. The paper\r\nreferred to proved that the Church of St. Michael was not on that site\r\nat all. It quotes from the _Liber Dunthorne_ the boundaries of the soke\r\nof the monastery of the Trinity, which are very nearly the same as those\r\nof Aldgate ward.\r\n\r\nIt concludes that it was more likely the crypt of a great house, perhaps\r\nthe ward house.\r\n\r\nRowland Taylor, before being burned for heresy, was taken to the\r\nWoolpack, an inn without Aldgate, and kept there.\r\n\r\nA curious story is told concerning the Duke of Buckingham in 1663. “When\r\nthe Duke came from Newmarket he stayed at an Inn by Aldgate. Here a\r\nfellow told him his fortune, saying that he would die unfortunately, as\r\nhis father did, or that a similar attempt would be made upon him by the\r\n1st of April. On the Tuesday prior to the date of the letter, the usher\r\nof the duke’s hall went to bed about 9 at night and rose again about one\r\nin the morning and came up at the back and private way to the duke’s\r\nchamber where only he, his lady, and a maid were talking. The maid\r\nopened the door at his knock and the usher rushed in with a naked sword,\r\nat which the maid squeaking gave my lord an alarm and he turning back\r\nsnatched up a knife and by his boldness daunted the fellow so that he\r\ngot within him, became master of his sword, and by that time company\r\ncame in. The duke sent after the fortune-teller but the writer did not\r\nknow whether he had heard of him.”\r\n\r\nNorthward of Aldgate, Mitre Street leads to Mitre Square which is\r\nsurrounded by large new buildings belonging to merchants. The ward\r\nschool is reached through a rounded tunnel-like entry and proves a\r\npleasant surprise. In itself it is only a square old brick house without\r\nan atom of style or ornament, but before it is a garden plot where lilac\r\nbushes grow, and over the blackened bricks of the house and adjoining\r\nwall climb big trees, hiding the dinginess. From here we get a view of\r\nthe old red-tiled roofs of the houses in Duke Street. In the school\r\nthere is free education, and 110 children are clothed at the expense of\r\nthe charity.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the ward school stood, until 1874, St. James’s, Duke’s\r\nPlace (see p. 165).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. BOTOLPH, ALDGATE\r\n\r\n  St. Botolph, Aldgate, stands at the junction of Aldgate Street and\r\n  Houndsditch, and is said to have been originally founded about the\r\n  reign of William the Conqueror. The old building remained standing\r\n  till 1741, when it was pulled down and the present one erected under\r\n  the direction of the elder Dance and completed in 1744. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1362. The patronage of the church was in the\r\n  hands of: The Prior and the Canons of Holy Trinity, London; Henry\r\n  VIII.; Robert Halywell, by grant of Elizabeth; George Puttenham,\r\n  granted by Elizabeth in the 30th year of her reign; Francis Morrice,\r\n  by James I., in the 7th year of his reign, since which time it has\r\n  been held by several private persons, but is now in the hands of the\r\n  Bishop of London. The benefice, which had been previously united\r\n  with that of St. Katherine by the Tower, was in 1899 united with\r\n  that of Holy Trinity Minories.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 1530.\r\n\r\n  The present church is built of brick, with stone dressings. It\r\n  includes two side-aisles separated from the central portion by\r\n  Tuscan columns, supporting a flat ceiling. There are a great many\r\n  windows, mostly filled with stained glass. The tower stands at the\r\n  south, facing Aldgate High Street, and is surmounted by a small\r\n  spire.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For John Romeney, at the Altar of the\r\n  Blessed Virgin Mary, to which Humphrey de Durham was admitted\r\n  chaplain, June 3, 1365; by Thomas Weston, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £5 : 6 : 8 in 1548; by Alex. Sprot and John Grace, whose endowments\r\n  yielded £22 : 15 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The most interesting monument in this church is a tomb inscribed to\r\n  the memory of Thomas, Lord Darcy and Sir Nicholas Carew, both of\r\n  whom were concerned in the Roman Catholic plots against Henry VIII.\r\n  and beheaded on Tower Hill, the former in 1537 and the latter in\r\n  1538. The memory of Robert Dowe, the charitable Merchant Taylor, is\r\n  preserved by a monument erected by his Company, originally affixed\r\n  to a pillar in the chancel, but now removed to the east gallery.\r\n\r\n  A great number of benefactors are recorded by Stow, some of the most\r\n  notable of whom were: Robert Cockes, donor of £100; George Clarke,\r\n  donor of £200 for a public school, and other large sums for parish\r\n  purposes. The sum total of all the yearly gifts belonging to this\r\n  parish recorded, amounted to £151 : 15 : 8.\r\n\r\n  There were two charity schools, one in the Freedom having fifty boys\r\n  and forty girls, erected by Sir John Cass, alderman; the other, in\r\n  East Smithfield, having forty boys and thirty girls maintained by\r\n  subscription.\r\n\r\n  James Ardene (1636-91), D.D., Dean of Chester, 1682, was perpetual\r\n  curate here in 1666; also White Kennett (1660-1728), Bishop of\r\n  Peterborough.\r\n\r\nSt. Botolph’s Churchyard is a wide gravelled space with seats provided\r\nby the Metropolitan Public Spaces Association. There is an altar-tomb\r\nnear the centre, and a row of flat tombstones of the usual pattern set\r\nback against the wall of the church. There are a few plane-trees and a\r\nrow of little limes. It is a pleasant breathing space, used by the\r\npoorest of humanity, who come here for a little rest and sleep.\r\n\r\n=High Street, Whitechapel=, is of great width and contains some large\r\nnew brick and stone buildings. The Three Nuns Hotel, an immense\r\nred-brick building erected in 1877, and recently added to, stands near\r\nthe station. By Crown Place, No. 23, is an old bow-windowed chop-house.\r\nOn the east the chief feature is the large number of shops or stalls\r\nopen to the street, covered by an awning or by a glass roof. These\r\nbelong chiefly to butchers, and have a characteristic aspect. The last\r\nfive or six houses before Mansell Street are all of considerable age and\r\nvery picturesque.\r\n\r\nReturning now westward we find:\r\n\r\n  The church and parish of =St. Mary Axe=, which are mentioned in the\r\n  _Calendar of Wills_ in the thirteenth century. Stow says of it:\r\n\r\n  “In St. Marie street had ye of old time a parish church of St. Marie\r\n  the Virgin, St. Ursula and the eleven thousand Virgins, which church\r\n  was commonly called St. Marie at the Axe, of the sign of an axe,\r\n  over against the east end thereof, or St. Marie Pellipar, of a plot\r\n  of ground lying on the north side thereof, pertaining to the\r\n  Skinners in London. This parish, about the year 1565, was united to\r\n  the parish church of St. Andrew Undershaft, and so was St. Mary at\r\n  the Axe suppressed and letten out to be a warehouse for a merchant.”\r\n\r\n  Cunningham corrects this statement. The church was called St. Mary\r\n  Axe because it possessed an Axe, one of the three with which the\r\n  11,000 Virgins were beheaded.\r\n\r\n  The parish is now united with that of St. Andrew Undershaft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. ANDREW UNDERSHAFT\r\n\r\n  The Church of St. Andrew Undershaft stands at the corner of St. Mary\r\n  Axe, and on the north side is the churchyard, a little space where a\r\n  few young trees grow. It derives its name from the May-day custom of\r\n  setting up a pole higher than the steeple before the south door.\r\n  This custom was discontinued after “Evil May Day” (see _Tudor\r\n  London_, p. 24). The present building, occupying the site of the\r\n  original one, of unknown date, was erected, according to Stow, in\r\n  1520, at the expense of a Sir Stephen Jennings, William\r\n  Fitzwilliams, and others. The work of restoration has been carried\r\n  on here during the last thirty years. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1361. The patronage has always been in the hands of the\r\n  Bishop of London, in whose successors it continues; he presented to\r\n  it in 1361.\r\n\r\n  The church is a late example of the Perpendicular style, consisting\r\n  of a nave and two side aisles, and surmounted by a tower, rebuilt in\r\n  1830, which is about 91 feet in height, and contains six bells. The\r\n  aisles are divided from the nave by clustered columns and obtusely\r\n  pointed arches, and above this is the clerestory. The spandrels\r\n  between the arches were embellished with scriptural paintings in\r\n  1726, but they are now much faded. In 1875 the series of full-length\r\n  portraits of Edward VI., Elizabeth, James I., Charles I., and\r\n  Charles II., were transferred from the east window to the west, and\r\n  modern stained glass took their place. A chantry was founded here by\r\n  Alan de Chepe in 1311.\r\n\r\n  The most interesting monument is that of the great antiquarian John\r\n  Stow; it is made of terra-cotta and is placed near the eastern end\r\n  of the north wall. There is another dedicated to Sir Hugh\r\n  Hammersley, sheriff 1618, and Lord Mayor 1627, part of the sculpture\r\n  of which is very fine. On the east wall of the north aisle is a\r\n  brass to Nicholas Levin, sheriff in 1534, and a liberal contributor\r\n  to the work of building the church; the brass is not large, but\r\n  twenty well-defined figures have been introduced. Sir William\r\n  Craven, Lord Mayor, 1640, a great benefactor to the parish, was\r\n  interred here, but has no monument; also Peter Antony Motteux, who\r\n  wrote comedies and masques, and died in 1718. Seven remarkable old\r\n  books are preserved in the vestry, Foxe’s _Acts and Monuments_, Sir\r\n  W. Raleigh’s _History of the World_, and others; a fragment of the\r\n  chain which formerly fastened Foxe’s book to a desk is still\r\n  retained.\r\n\r\n  This church and parish received many charitable gifts, some of the\r\n  donors of which were: Robert Gayer, £50; Sir Thomas Rich, £400; the\r\n  widow of Mr. Van Citters, £200, for the apprenticeship of two parish\r\n  children, 1706; and Joseph Chamberlain, £121 : 1s. in 1706. There\r\n  was a charity school for fifty boys and thirty girls who were\r\n  clothed, taught, and put out as apprentices by contribution. Among\r\n  the most notable rectors were: John Russell (died 1494), Bishop of\r\n  Rochester; John Pricket, Bishop of Gloucester; Robert Grove\r\n  (1631-1696), Bishop of Chichester; and William Walsham How\r\n  (1823-1897), Bishop of Bedford and of Wakefield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. ANDREW UNDERSHAFT\r\n]\r\n\r\nStow died in this parish and, it is believed, in St. Mary Axe itself,\r\nhis windows overlooking the grounds and ruins of St. Helen’s nunnery.\r\n\r\nAnother parish church stood in St. Mary Axe, at the north end against\r\nthe wall. It was called St. Augustine’s-in-the-Wall. In the year 1430\r\nthe church was allotted to the Fraternity of the Papey, the house for\r\npoor priests.\r\n\r\nThe house was suppressed in the reign of Edward VI., and was afterwards\r\noccupied by Sir Francis Walsingham (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p.\r\n377).\r\n\r\nThe modern St. Mary Axe is not interesting. The old house at the corner\r\nof Great St. Helen’s is the first to be noticed. Next to it is another\r\nold one, stuccoed. A few doors northward is the Grapes public-house.\r\nThen follow a succession of more or less new warehouses, with narrow\r\nfrontage, chiefly in red brick, not unpicturesquely designed. A very new\r\nred brick building with much ornamental detail is St. Anne’s Chambers,\r\nNos. 37 to 41. This is succeeded by the ward school, which is of red\r\nbrick and bears its name across its frontage. It is the ward school of\r\nCornhill and Lime Street, and was established 1710. The present building\r\nwas erected in 1846. A little model of St. George and the Dragon gives a\r\ntouch of vivacity to its appearance. Beyond this are large brick\r\nbusiness houses and warehouses. Bishopsgate Avenue is occupied chiefly\r\nby stationers and printers.\r\n\r\n=Bevis Marks.=—“Then next is one great House, large of Rooms, fair\r\nCourts and Garden Plots, sometime pertaining to the Bassets, since that,\r\nto the Abbots of Bury in Suffolk, and therefore called Buries Marks,\r\ncorruptly Bevis Marks. And since the Dissolution of the Abbey of Bury,\r\nto Thomas Heneage the Father, and Sir Thomas Heneage the Son.\r\n\r\n“This House and Ground is now encreased into many Tenements: And among\r\nthe rest, the Jews of London have of late built themselves a large\r\nSynagogue here, wainscotted round. It stands East and West like one of\r\nour Churches. The great Door is on the West: Near to which West End is a\r\nlong Desk upon an Ascent, somewhat raised from the rest of the Floor;\r\nwhere I suppose the Law is read. The East wall is in part railed in; and\r\nbefore the Wall is a Door, which is to open with a Key, where their Law\r\nseems to be laid up. Aloft on this Wall are the Ten Commandments, or\r\nsome part of them, inscribed in Golden Hebrew Letters without Points.\r\nThere be seven great Branched Candlesticks of Brass hanging down from\r\nthe Top; and many other Places for Candles and Lamps. The Seats are\r\nBenches, with Backs to them that run along from West to East” (Strype,\r\nvol. i. bk. ii. p. 73).\r\n\r\nThe modern Bevis Marks is lined on the west by substantial red-brick\r\nbuildings chiefly occupied by merchants.\r\n\r\n=Heneage Lane=, leading out of Bevis Marks, a narrow and dark\r\nthoroughfare, contains the synagogue of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews.\r\nIt is a plain structure externally, built in the year 1700. Standing in\r\nthe midst of its courts and almshouses the place has somewhat the\r\nappearance of a Spanish convent. The interior is spacious and fitted\r\nwith two galleries, one for women. The children attend service under one\r\nof the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of =Houndsditch= as given by Stow is as unsavoury as the\r\nreputation the street later earned. “Called Hounds-ditch for that in old\r\ntime when the same lay open much filth (conveyed forth of the Citie)\r\nespecially dead dogges was there laid or cast.” Beyond the mud wall that\r\nenclosed the ditch was a “fayre field” where were the almshouses of the\r\nPriory of Holy Trinity.\r\n\r\n“In my youth, I remember,” continues Stow, “devout people as well men as\r\nwomen of the Citie, were accustomed oftentimes, especially on Frydayes\r\nweekely, to walke that way purposely, and there to bestow their\r\ncharitable almes; every poor man or woman lying in their bed within\r\ntheir window, which was toward the street open so low, that every man\r\nmight see them.”\r\n\r\nAt present looking down Houndsditch from Bishopsgate Within the street\r\npresents a not unpicturesque appearance. On the south, indeed, it is one\r\ncontinuous row of dull brick box-like houses, but on the north one or\r\ntwo old projecting houses break the line. No. 96 is an old stuccoed\r\nhouse which projects in a broad bay above the first floor. Besides these\r\nold houses several high plain warehouses break up the monotony of the\r\nstreet line. Houndsditch is the centre of the old-clothes trade. To the\r\nnorth lie huge warehouses and industrial dwellings.\r\n\r\n=Bishopsgate=.—There were two northern gates to the Roman wall: one of\r\nthem corresponding with Newgate and the other with Bishopsgate. But the\r\nSaxon and mediæval Bishopsgate was not built on the site of the Roman\r\ngate, but a little to the west. The foundations of the Roman gate have\r\nbeen found in Camomile Street; they were built with carved stones taken\r\nfrom some Roman building, perhaps a villa, an illustration of my theory\r\nthat the wall was built in great haste and that all the stone buildings\r\nof the City were used in its construction.\r\n\r\nThe massive masonry of the ancient “Newgate” has also been found close\r\nby the later gate in Giltspur Street.\r\n\r\nThe traffic along Bishopsgate Street, which led into the Roman Fort, and\r\nto the Bridge from the north and eastern parts of the island, caused a\r\nsettlement and a street to be established here long before the wall was\r\nbuilt. For the same reason, when the City began to fill up after its\r\nlong period of desolation, the line was one of the first to be settled\r\nagain, while on either side there were vacant spaces, orchards, fields,\r\nand gardens. Houses and shops sprang up both within and without the\r\nwall; the latter only when the Norman power had removed the fear of\r\nanother siege. It is impossible to say with any certainty when the\r\nstreet was actually recognised as such. Thus, to quote such facts as are\r\naccessible in Riley’s _Memorials_, in the _Calendar of Wills_, etc., we\r\nfind that in 1259, 1272, 1285, and 1288 there are mentioned “houses\r\nnear, or within, Bishopsgate,” and in 1309 and 1311 there are “houses\r\nwithout” Bishopsgate. In 1329 we find a brew-house in Bishopsgate\r\nStreet. Again, in 1314 the shops of one Roger Poyntel are in danger by\r\nreason of an overhanging elm-tree, thanks to which we learn that there\r\nwere at that time residents close by the gate; in 1305 a tourelle in the\r\nwall near the gate is given to William Coeur de Lyon, chaplain, on\r\ncondition that he keeps it in repair; in 1314 another tourelle near the\r\ngate is given to John de Elyngham, chaplain in charity, on the same\r\ncondition; in 1318 the upper chamber of the gate, together with a\r\ntourelle on the east, and a garden against the wall, is granted to John\r\nde Long, an Easterling, or member of the Hanseatic League, on the same\r\ncondition. In 1324 he renounced his lease and, apparently, went home.\r\n(Here we have an instance of a Hanseatic merchant living outside the\r\n_Domus_, or _Aula Teutonicorum_, where they were all supposed to live.\r\nBut no absolute rule about anything can be laid down in these\r\ncenturies.) The Almaines or Easterlings who were responsible for the\r\nrepair and maintenance of the gate, were exempt from toll. On the other\r\nhand (another illustration of the conflicting “rights” of the time), the\r\nBishop of London claimed one stock out of every cart-load of wood that\r\npassed through the gate. Let the Bishop, then, keep the hinges in\r\nrepair!\r\n\r\nThe gate was built, it is said, by Bishop Erkenwald in 685. One\r\nsupposes, since he did not rebuild on the Roman foundations, that a way\r\nhad been made through the wall on the west side, and that traffic had,\r\nfor convenience, chosen that way. The gate was considered, in some\r\nsense, to be under the special care of the Bishop. But the burden of its\r\nmaintenance was laid upon the Hanseatic merchants. The case was tried\r\nand decided in 1282, when the merchants were ordered to keep the gate,\r\nand to find men and money if necessary in its defence for one-third of\r\nthe cost. On the antiquities of the gate, hear also Stow:\r\n\r\n“The eldest note that I read of this Bishopsgate, is that William Blund,\r\none of the sheriffs of London, in the year 1210, sold to Serle Mercer,\r\nand William Almaine, procurators or wardens of London Bridge, all his\r\nland, with the garden, in the parish of St. Buttolph without\r\nBishopsgate.\r\n\r\n“Next I read in a charter, dated the year 1235, that Walter Brune,\r\ncitizen of London, and Rosia his wife, having founded the priory or new\r\nhospital of our blessed Lady, since called St. Mary Spittle without\r\nBishopsgate, confirmed the same to the honour of God and our blessed\r\nLady, for canons regular.\r\n\r\n“Also in the year 1247, Simon Fitzmary, one of the sheriffs of London,\r\nthe 29th of Henry III., founded the hospital of St. Mary, called Bethlem\r\nwithout Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\n“This gate was again beautifully built in the year 1479, in the reign of\r\nEdward IV., by the Haunce merchants.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, about the year 1551, these Haunce merchants, having prepared\r\nstone for that purpose, caused a new gate to be framed, there to have\r\nbeen set up, but then their liberties, through suit of our English\r\nmerchants, were seized into the king’s hand; and so that work was\r\nstayed, and the old gate yet remaineth.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BISHOPSGATE STREET, SHOWING CHURCH OF ST. MARTIN, OUTWICH, AND THE\r\n    PUMP, 1814\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1731 the old gate was taken down and another erected. This, with the\r\nother City gates, was removed in 1760.\r\n\r\nIf we walk down Bishopsgate Street Within, we cannot do better than take\r\nStow with us, remembering that he is writing in the year 1598:\r\n\r\n“And first to begin on the left hand of Bishopsgate street, from the\r\ngate you have certain tenements of old time pertaining to a brotherhood\r\nof St. Nicholas, granted to the parish clerks of London, for two\r\nchaplains, to be kept in the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, near unto the\r\nGuildhall of London, in the 27th of Henry VI. The first of these houses\r\ntowards the north, and against the wall of the city, was sometime a\r\nlarge inn or court called the Wrestlers, of such a sign, and the last in\r\nthe high street towards the south was sometime also a fair inn called\r\nthe Angel, of such a sign. Among these said tenements was on the same\r\nstreet side a fair entry, or court, to the common hall of the said\r\nparish clerks, with proper almshouses, seven in number, adjoining, for\r\npoor parish clerks, and their wives and their widows, such as were in\r\ngreat years not able to labour. This brotherhood, amongst other, being\r\nsuppressed, in the reign of Edward VI. the said hall, with the other\r\nbuildings there, was given to Sir Robert Chester, a knight of\r\nCambridgeshire; against whom the parish clerks commencing suit, in the\r\nreign of Queen Mary, and being like to have prevailed, the said Sir\r\nRobert Chester pulled down the hall, sold the timber, stone, and lead,\r\nand thereupon the suit was ended. The almshouses remain in the queen’s\r\nhands, and people are there placed, such as can make best friends; some\r\nof them, taking the pension appointed, have let forth their houses for\r\ngreat rent, giving occasion to the parson of the parish to challenge\r\ntithes of the poor, etc.”\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning St. Ethelburga, St. Helen’s, and St. Andrew Undershaft,\r\nhe goes on:\r\n\r\n“Then have you one great house called Crosby place, because the same was\r\nbuilt by Sir John Crosby, grocer and woolman, in place of certain\r\ntenements, with their appurtenances, letten to him by Alice Ashfeld,\r\nprioress of St. Helen’s, and the convent, for ninety-nine years, from\r\nthe year 1466 unto the year 1565, for the annual rent of £11 : 6 : 8.\r\n\r\n“Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and lord protector, afterwards king, by\r\nthe name of Richard III., was lodged in this house; since the which\r\ntime, among other, Anthonie Bonvice, a rich merchant of Italy, dwelt\r\nthere; after him, Garmain Cioll, then William Bond, alderman, increased\r\nthis house in height, with building of a turret on the top thereof: he\r\ndeceased in the year 1576, and was buried in St. Helen’s church. Divers\r\nambassadors have been lodged there; namely, in the year 1586, Henry\r\nRamelius, chancellor of Denmark, ambassador unto the queen’s majesty of\r\nEngland from Frederick II., the king of Denmark; an ambassador of\r\nFrance, etc. Sir John Spencer, Alderman, lately purchased this house,\r\nmade great reparations, kept his mayoralty there, and since built a most\r\nlarge warehouse near thereunto.\r\n\r\n“From this Crosbie place up to Leaden Hall corner, and so down Grass\r\nStreet, amongst other tenements, are divers fair and large built houses\r\nfor merchants and such like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Schnebbelie_.\r\n\r\n  ST. HELEN, BISHOPSGATE, 1817\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Now for the other side of this ward, namely, the right hand, hard by\r\nwithin the gate, is one fair water conduit, which Thomas Knesworth,\r\nmayor, in the year 1505, founded: he gave £60, the rest was furnished at\r\nthe common charges of the city. This conduit hath since been taken down\r\nand new built. David Woodroffe, alderman, gave £20 towards the\r\nconveyance of more water thereunto. From this conduit have you, amongst\r\nmany fair tenements, divers fair inns, large for receipt of travellers,\r\nand some houses for men of worship; namely, one most spacious of all\r\nother thereabout, built of brick and timber by Sir Thomas Gresham,\r\nknight, who deceased in the year 1579, and was buried in St. Helen’s\r\nchurch, under a fair monument, by him prepared in his life: he appointed\r\nby his testament this house to be made a college of readers, as before\r\nis said in the chapter of schools and houses of learning.\r\n\r\n“Somewhat west from this house is one other very fair house, wherein Sir\r\nWilliam Hollis kept his mayoralty, and was buried in the parish church\r\nof St. Helen. Sir Andrew Jud also kept his mayoralty there, and was\r\nburied at St. Helen’s: he built almshouses for six poor alms people near\r\nto the said parish church, and gave lands to the Skinners, out of the\r\nwhich they are to give 4s. every week to the six poor alms people, 8d.\r\nthe piece, and 25s. 4d. the year, in coals amongst them for ever”\r\n(Stow’s _Survey_, p. 181).\r\n\r\nShakespeare, who lived for a time in St. Helen’s, and therefore knew\r\nCrosby Hall well, has introduced it in Richard III. Sir Thomas More\r\nlived here for a time, the guest of Bonvici, to whom from the Tower he\r\nwrote, and in whose gown, of silk camlet, he went to his execution. In\r\n1547 Bonvici let the house on lease to William Roper, More’s son-in-law,\r\nand to his nephew William Rastell, a printer. Under Edward VI., Bonvici,\r\nRastell, and Roper went abroad, but came home under Mary. Meantime\r\nEdward VI. had conferred the house upon Sir Thomas D’Arcy, afterwards\r\nLord D’Arcy, who seems to have sold it to William Bond, alderman and\r\nsheriff. Sir John Spencer next became the owner of the house. He\r\nreceived the Duc de Sully, Grand Treasurer of France, with all his\r\nretinue.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the inheritance of this great merchant came to the\r\nComptons is told by Hare:\r\n\r\n“Sir John Spencer, having but a poor opinion of the Compton family in\r\nthat day, positively forbade the first Earl of Northampton to pay his\r\naddresses to his daughter, who was the greatest heiress in England. One\r\nday, at the foot of the staircase, Sir John met the baker’s boy with his\r\ncovered barrow, and, being pleased at his having come punctually when he\r\nwas ordered, he gave him sixpence; but the baker’s boy was Lord\r\nNorthampton in disguise, and in the covered barrow he was carrying off\r\nthe beautiful Elizabeth Spencer. When he found how he had been duped,\r\nSir John swore that Lord Northampton had seen the only sixpence of his\r\nmoney he should ever receive, and refused to be reconciled to his\r\ndaughter. But the next year Queen Elizabeth, having expressed to Sir\r\nJohn Spencer the sympathy which she felt with his sentiments upon the\r\ningratitude of his child, invited him to come and be “gossip” with her\r\nto a newly-born baby in which she was much interested, and he could not\r\nrefuse; and it is easy to imagine whose that baby was. So the Spencer\r\nproperty came to the Comptons after all” (Hare, vol. i. pp. 284-85).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CORNHILL MILITARY ASSOCIATION, WITH A VIEW OF THE CHURCH OF ST.\r\n    HELEN’S AND LEATHERSELLERS’ HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1642 the Earl of Northampton was killed at Hopton Heath, beside the\r\nKing. Here lived the Countess of Pembroke, Sidney’s sister, immortalised\r\nby Ben Jonson’s epitaph. In 1640 Sir John Langham, sheriff in 1642,\r\nleased the house; it is said to have been used as a prison for\r\nRoyalists. His son, Sir Stephen Langham, succeeded, and in his time a\r\ngreat part of the house was destroyed by fire. In 1672, its great hall\r\nbecame a Presbyterian meeting-house; it was then turned into a packers’\r\nwarehouse. In 1831 it was converted into an institute for lectures and\r\nis now a restaurant.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COUNCIL ROOM, CROSBY HALL, 1816\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe streets and courts leading out of Bishopsgate Street Within are\r\nneither important nor numerous. On the west side going south from the\r\ngate were inns called the Vine, the Four Swans, the Green Dragon, the\r\nBlack Bull, and the Cross Keys (in Gracechurch Street).\r\n\r\nBeginning at the south end of the modern Bishopsgate we see on the west\r\nthe Bank of Scotland, the National Bank of Australasia, and the Delhi\r\nand London Bank, housed under one roof in a large stone building with\r\nthe lower windows enclosed in exceptionally high and bold arches. Baring\r\nBros. Bank is opposite. It is a plain, well-proportioned brick building,\r\nsymmetrical and without tawdry ornament; it was designed by R. Norman\r\nShaw. It is flanked on either side by a public-house, The Black Lion and\r\nthe City of London Tavern. Just opposite the entrance of Threadneedle\r\nStreet the Wesleyan Centenary Hall attracts attention by its size and\r\nsolidity. Four immense fluted columns run up the facade to a frieze and\r\ntriangular pediment. It was erected in 1839. Close by is the Bank of\r\nScotland. It looks out on the really fine National Provincial Bank of\r\nEngland at the north corner of Threadneedle Street. This has fluted\r\nstone columns running up to the frieze along the whole frontage. They\r\nenclose very tall, round-headed windows, and above the windows are deep\r\npanels of great size executed in _basso-relievo_. It was erected in 1833\r\nand the architect was J. Gibson. Along the parapet of the roof at\r\nintervals are placed statues which break the hard line.\r\n\r\nImmediately opposite the entry, on the east side of the square we see a\r\ndreary block of brick houses; these are Crosby Buildings, and are fully\r\noccupied by representatives of trade and commerce. On the south side\r\nthere is an old stuccoed house with a square pillared porch. The next\r\nhouse is of red brick with decorative brick panels let in on the face.\r\nThis is an old house which has been recased. Its fine stuccoed doorway\r\nis still preserved. On the west a large red brick building bearing date\r\n1876 fills up the space, and on the north is an old brick house with a\r\nplain projecting pediment over the door, and brackets similar to those\r\non the south side. No. 7 in the north-east corner is a new stone house\r\nof plain but rather original design. A couple of little plane-trees grow\r\nup at either end of the quiet square.\r\n\r\nA covered entry leads from Crosby Square to Great St. Helen’s. The first\r\npart of this tortuous thoroughfare is lined by the side of Crosby\r\nBuildings, modern brick, on the one side, and the end of the stuccoed\r\nsynagogue, which stands back from the frontage of the street, on the\r\nother. About this part, and the narrow lane which succeeds it running\r\nnorth and south, there is little to say; the substantial business spirit\r\npervades even the bricks and mortar. But in the open space beyond,\r\nfacing the church, are some features of interest. Nos. 8, 9, and 10 have\r\nall been rebuilt in the large-windowed flat modern style. No. 7 is a\r\nfine old red brick house. No. 2 is a delightful one and has an\r\nornamental doorway with fluted columns and pilasters supporting the\r\nlintel, beneath which on either side are cherubs’ heads. Across the wide\r\nspace before the quaint and interesting church are other red brick\r\nhouses, some old and some of more modern date. Close by the entry the\r\nbuilder is at work on the site of some charming old gabled houses\r\ndemolished within the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. HELEN, BISHOPSGATE\r\n\r\n  There is a well-known tradition that a church was built here in the\r\n  fourth century by the Emperor Constantine, and there is a record\r\n  preserved which proves that the church was in existence before the\r\n  year 1010. A church standing on this site was given by one Ranulph,\r\n  and Robert his son, to the Dean and Canons of St. Paul’s at a date\r\n  unknown. About 1212, permission was obtained to found the Priory of\r\n  St. Helen for nuns of the Benedictine Order and with this the real\r\n  history of the church begins. It is always stated that the north\r\n  aisle of the church was used by the nuns, while the south was\r\n  occupied by the parishioners, but the first rector mentioned dates\r\n  from 1541, that is to say, after the suppression of the Religious\r\n  Houses. On the dissolution of the priory in 1538 the church was\r\n  given in its entirety to parochial uses. It was largely repaired in\r\n  1631 (under the direction of Inigo Jones), in 1841, 1865, and again\r\n  in 1891-93. In 1873 the Parish of St. Martin Outwich was united with\r\n  this, its church having been pulled down.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 220.\r\n\r\n  The church consists of two parallel naves, each of 122 feet in\r\n  length and about 25 feet in width, and a south transept, out of\r\n  which two eastern chapels open. In the north wall is an arched\r\n  doorway which led from the choir into the priory, also a hagioscope\r\n  through which the nuns were able to discern the high altar from the\r\n  cloisters. All this part and some of the south transept dates from\r\n  the thirteenth century; the side chapels were added about the middle\r\n  of the fourteenth and the rest dates from the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded in honour of the Holy Ghost for the soul of\r\n  Adam Fraunceys, to which Joan, Prioress of the Convent of St. Helen,\r\n  presented Robert Gryngeley, May 18, 1399, and for Agnes his wife\r\n  (Hennessey’s _Chantries_, p. 39).\r\n\r\n  The church contains a remarkable number of interesting monuments.\r\n  The following are commemorated: Alderman John Robinson, Merchant\r\n  Taylor and merchant of the Staple of England; died 1599. Francis\r\n  Bancroft, who bequeathed over £28,000 to the Drapers Company for the\r\n  erection of almshouses and a school for boys; he died 1727. Martin\r\n  Bond, M.P. in 1624 and 1625 for the City of London. Alberticus\r\n  Gentilis, Merchant Adventurer and a prolific legal author who was an\r\n  exile from Italy on account of his Protestant opinions; he became\r\n  Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford and died in 1608. Sir Thomas\r\n  Gresham, founder of the Royal Exchange and Gresham College, who died\r\n  in 1579. Sir Andrew Judde, Lord Mayor in 1550, and a great\r\n  benefactor of the parish. Sir Julius Cæsar, judge, Master of the\r\n  Rolls under James I.; his monument was executed by Nicholas Stone,\r\n  Master Mason to King Charles I. Sir William Pickering, Knt., soldier\r\n  and scholar, whose monument is the most magnificent in the church;\r\n  he distinguished himself greatly under Henry VIII., Edward VI.,\r\n  Mary, and Elizabeth; he died in 1574. Sir John Crosby, already\r\n  mentioned in connection with Crosby Hall. Sir John Spencer, Lord\r\n  Mayor in 1594, commonly known as “Rich Spencer” on account of his\r\n  vast wealth. The Rev. J. E. Cox, D.D., who was Vicar-in-charge of\r\n  the united parishes, wrote _The Annals of St. Helen’s, Bishopsgate,\r\n  London_; he was for nine years in succession Grand Chaplain of\r\n  England. On the floors of the two chapels there are several brasses\r\n  very well executed.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of benefactors are recorded by Stow, but the\r\n  amounts of their gifts were small individually. Sir John Crosby, at\r\n  his death in 1475, bequeathed 500 marks for the repair of the\r\n  church. In more recent times Francis Bancroft bequeathed over\r\n  £28,000; this has been devoted to founding a school at Woodford,\r\n  Essex, for boys—100 boarders and 200 day-boys. Sir Andrew Judde left\r\n  the Skinners Company trustees for the accomplishment of charitable\r\n  aims.\r\n\r\n  There were five almshouses near the church for as many decayed\r\n  Skinners and their wives. Six almshouses also were founded by Sir\r\n  Andrew Judde; in Little St. Helen Street there were seven houses for\r\n  the same number of widows, each of whom had £5 : 4s. per annum.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Horton (d. 1673), Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, 1649, was\r\n  rector here.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the ancient nunnery of St. Helen, see _Mediæval\r\nLondon_, vol. ii. p. 313.\r\n\r\nSt. Helen’s Place is a quiet corner with monotonous rows of Early\r\nVictorian or Georgian brick houses finished off with yellow paint. No.\r\n1, near the entrance, and No. 2 have slight pillared porches over their\r\ndoorways. In the northeast corner the small but richly-decorated front\r\nof the Leathersellers’ Hall attracts attention. The place is shut off\r\nfrom the street by spiked iron gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LEATHERSELLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  Dealers in leather are supposed to have existed as a society or\r\n  corporation in Britain from the time of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE TO LEATHERSELLERS’ HALL. DEMOLISHED 1799\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The “leathersellers,” as a company, are first mentioned about A.D.\r\n  1372, in Edward III.’s reign, when their “probi homines,” or “bons\r\n  gentz,” their wardens or seniors, came before the Court of Aldermen,\r\n  together with those of the craft of Pursers, afterwards amalgamated\r\n  with the Leathersellers Company, and jointly presented a bill or\r\n  “supplication” desiring some stringent regulations to be made for\r\n  the prevention of the sale of other than genuine leather, and to\r\n  prevent fraudulent colouring of leather.\r\n\r\n  The leathersellers were known as a corporation in London, and were\r\n  governed by ordinances, 1377-99.\r\n\r\n  The first charter of incorporation was granted to the Company by 22\r\n  Henry VI., 1444. It is still in their possession, and, “after\r\n  reciting the petition of Thomas Bigge and fourteen others, men of\r\n  the mistery of leathersellers of the city of London, sets forth an\r\n  ordinance made by Richard Whittington, mayor, and the aldermen of\r\n  the city, 21 Richard II., A.D. 1398, that two or four of the better\r\n  or more approved men of the mistery should yearly be chosen and\r\n  sworn to guard and oversee defaults in the same mistery, and to\r\n  present, from time to time, to the mayor and chamber of the said\r\n  city aforesaid for the time being; and that none of the mistery\r\n  aforesaid, to wit, master or servant, should be rebellious or\r\n  contrarious to such men so chosen and sworn, duly exercising search\r\n  in the said mistery, nor points, or laces, unless they were well and\r\n  sufficiently made, nor straps of the leather of sheep or calf, nor\r\n  thereof any other work, should falsely or deceitfully be wrought to\r\n  the deception of the people under pain of the heavy punishment upon\r\n  such cases ordained, and the payment of 6s. 8d.; to wit, to the use\r\n  of the Chamber of the city aforesaid 40d., and to the use of the\r\n  said mistery 40d.”\r\n\r\n  There are now 151 members of the livery. They have a Corporate\r\n  Income of £17,000 and a Trust Income of £3000. With the\r\n  Leathersellers were incorporated the White Tawyers, or makers of\r\n  white leather; the Pouchmakers, the Pursers, the Mailmakers, the\r\n  Galoche-makers, the Tiltmongers, the Leather-dressers, the\r\n  Parchment-makers and the Leather-dyers.\r\n\r\n  The earliest quarters of the trades connected with Leather were in\r\n  the north under London Wall. Here they had their first hall. After\r\n  the dissolution of the Religious Houses the Company obtained the\r\n  site of the nunnery known as St. Helen’s. Part of the house was\r\n  converted into the Company’s Hall, the old Refectory becoming the\r\n  Company’s place of meeting and banqueting. This ancient structure\r\n  was destroyed in 1797, the present one was built in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe low small Church of =St. Ethelburga= peers over some old houses,\r\nwhich seem to have stuck to it as barnacles to a decayed ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. ETHELBURGA THE VIRGIN\r\n\r\n  This church is dedicated to Ethelburga, who was sister of Erconwald,\r\n  fourth Bishop of London, and first Abbess of Barking. In all\r\n  probability the parish was formed and the church was built in the\r\n  century which succeeded the Conquest. It escaped the Great Fire, and\r\n  has subsequently had a great deal of attempted restoration. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1304.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: the Prioress and\r\n  Convent of St. Helen’s, London, 1366; then Henry VIII. seized it and\r\n  it was granted in 1569 to the Bishop of London, and continues with\r\n  his successors.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 140.\r\n\r\n  The present church, originally Early English, appears to have been\r\n  altered at the close of the fourteenth century or early fifteenth.\r\n  It is very small, measuring less than 60 feet by 30, and under 31\r\n  feet in height, and is almost crowded out by houses. Entrance is\r\n  obtained through an archway between two shops, the upper stories of\r\n  which conceal everything but the top of the west window and turret.\r\n  It contains a south aisle separated from the rest by four pointed\r\n  arches, with a clerestory above. The roof is divided into\r\n  compartments and slopes slightly at the sides. The arch at the\r\n  entrance of the nave is fine and there are remnants of wood-carving,\r\n  probably of the sixteenth century, on the porch.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here at the Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary\r\n  by Gilbert Marion, and Christina his wife, to which Thomas More was\r\n  admitted chaplain, December 15, 1436.\r\n\r\n  There are tablets affixed to the wall commemorating parishioners,\r\n  but little interest attaches to the individuals. The only two\r\n  connected with this church of any eminence are John Larke, a friend\r\n  of Sir Thomas More, who was executed in 1554 for denying the King’s\r\n  supremacy; and Luke Milbourne (1649-1720), Dryden’s hostile critic,\r\n  rector here in 1704. William Bray (d. 1644), chaplain to Archbishop\r\n  Laud, was also sometime rector.\r\n\r\nIn Clark’s Place is a building containing the Marine Society, with the\r\nstatues of a woman and boy in a niche. In Bishopsgate Street, No. 68, is\r\nan old stuccoed house with projecting upper stories. No. 67 is also old\r\nthough not so noticeable.\r\n\r\nPart of Ethelburga House and the numbers on the north, as far as 23\r\ninclusive, are in this ward. The corner house has a stone mitre of large\r\nsize on its corner and an inscription, rather quaintly worded,\r\nannouncing that the gate stood formerly “adjoining to this spot.”\r\nLooking back down Bishopsgate from here we get a fine perspective view.\r\nThe modern buildings are of all heights, but distance blends them not\r\ninharmoniously, leaving enough variety to be pleasing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by R. West, 1736._\r\n\r\n  ST. ETHELBURGA, BISHOPSGATE ST.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Mail Coach public-house is at the corner, and on the opposite house\r\nis a small mitre in memory of the Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\nJust outside the City Wall is\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. BOTOLPH, BISHOPSGATE\r\n\r\n  This church escaped the Great Fire of 1666, but was rebuilt in\r\n  1725-29 by James Gold. In 1615 the City gave the parishioners\r\n  additional ground on the west for burial purposes. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1323.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church has always been in the hands of the\r\n  bishops of London since 1323.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 650.\r\n\r\n  The building includes two aisles, separated from the main body by\r\n  composite columns. There are galleries on the north, south, and\r\n  west. The steeple rises at the east end, and the chancel, therefore,\r\n  is formed beneath the tower. It is built of stone and consists of\r\n  three stories, the third of which is completed by a small composite\r\n  temple surrounded by a balustrade and surmounted by an urn. The\r\n  remainder of the exterior is of red brick with stone dressings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  ST. BOTOLPH, BISHOPSGATE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Sir Paul Pindar, a great benefactor to the church, who acted as\r\n  James I.’s Turkish Ambassador in 1611, was buried in this church,\r\n  and a monument was erected to his memory. Close to this, also in the\r\n  chancel, is a brass plate in memory of Sir William Blizard,\r\n  President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who died in 1835. John\r\n  Keats was baptized here in 1795, and Edward Alleyn, founder of\r\n  Dulwich College, in 1566. Here also Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of\r\n  Argyll and father of the celebrated first marquis, was married in\r\n  1609.\r\n\r\n  There were a considerable number of small charitable gifts belonging\r\n  to this parish. Of the larger, Ralph Pindar was a donor of £60;\r\n  Nicholas Reive, of £406 : 5s. in 1626; William, Earl of Devonshire,\r\n  of £100.\r\n\r\n  There was one charity school for twenty-five boys and twenty-five\r\n  girls, who were taught and made apprentices by subscription and\r\n  legacies. Also almshouses in Lamb’s Court for the poor of the\r\n  parish, maintained by Dulwich College, and three almshouses by the\r\n  pesthouse for three poor widows, the gift of Lady Lumley.\r\n\r\n  Some of the notable rectors were: Alfred Earle, Bishop of\r\n  Marlborough, in 1888; Charles James Blomfield (1786-1857), Bishop of\r\n  Chester; John Lake (1624-89), Bishop of Chichester.\r\n\r\nOn the site of Spital Square, Bishopsgate Street Without, stood the\r\nancient house called St. Mary Spital, for an account of which see\r\n_Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 322.\r\n\r\nBishopsgate Street Without is a curious mixture of old houses, some with\r\ngrotesque features, and modern buildings presenting only a strip of\r\nmuch-ornamented stone or brick frontage. After the Great Eastern Hotel\r\non the west, the frontage of the station presents a very long row of\r\nuniform buildings in new red brick with stone dressings and ornamental\r\ngable ends. The famous old house named Paul Pindar’s was pulled down to\r\nmake way for these.\r\n\r\nPaul Pindar (b. 1565) was the son of Ralph Pindar, alderman’s deputy for\r\nthe ward of Bishopsgate. At sixteen he was apprenticed to one Parvish,\r\nan Italian merchant who sent him to Venice as his factor, and he stayed\r\nthere many years. In 1615 he was sent to Turkey as Ambassador by request\r\nof the Turkey Company, and he remained there for nine years. He returned\r\nin 1623, and was knighted. The King offered him also the Lieutenancy of\r\nthe Tower, which he declined. Charles thereupon made him Farmer of\r\nCustoms.\r\n\r\nIn 1639 he possessed £236,000, out of which he gave large sums to the\r\nKing. He died August 22, 1650. The row of houses that now stand on the\r\nsite of his house have fairly good shops on the ground-floors, and there\r\nare one or two archway entrances into the station premises near the\r\nnorth end. The Black Raven public-house is one of these. Acorn Street,\r\nSkinner Street, and Primrose Street need very little comment. They are\r\nchiefly composed of the sides of houses fronting Bishopsgate, and some\r\nordinary modern brick buildings.\r\n\r\nNos. 131-2-3 are old plaster houses, and No. 120, beyond Acorn Street,\r\nhas a projecting bay window carried up two stories. This is also an old\r\nhouse. These are all on the west side. On the east, beginning again from\r\nthe south end, the first building to attract attention is the\r\nMetropolitan Fire Brigade Station, erected 1885. It is an improvement on\r\nthe monstrosities continually perpetrated in the name of the Fire\r\nBrigade. The Bishopsgate Institute is near Brushfield Street. It fronts\r\nBishopsgate with an elaborate yellow terra-cotta façade, and has an open\r\nentry. The entrance to the Bishopsgate Chapel is under an old stuccoed\r\nhouse, and the chapel itself is a large stuccoed building. Beyond this,\r\nafter a Great Northern Receiving Office, are some very old houses,\r\nplastered with rough stucco in imitation of stone. These are Nos. 82 to\r\n84. One of them has wooden rusticated work from above the first story to\r\nthe top of the gable end. The date 1590 is stated to have been visible\r\non one of them within the memory of man. On the corner house of Spital\r\nStreet is a tablet noting the point of the City Bounds. This was placed\r\nhere in 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP V\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come next to those streets which run north and south of Thames\r\nStreet. The area is bounded on the north by Ludgate Hill, St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, Cannon Street, and Fenchurch Street; on the south by the\r\nThames; on the east by Tower Hill and the site of London Wall; and on\r\nthe west by the bed of the Fleet River, now New Bridge Street. For the\r\nsake of convenience we will begin at the west end.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the City originally crossed Ludgate Hill at the gate, and\r\nran down nearly in a straight line to the river. The Castle or Tower of\r\nMontfichet was in the middle of this piece of wall, and Baynard’s Castle\r\nwas at the south end of it. The Tower of Montfichet passed into the\r\nFitzwalter family, who also owned the soke beside it. Now, when the\r\nfirst enmity broke out between John and Fitzwalter, all the castles and\r\nhouses of the latter were dismantled and destroyed by the King’s\r\ncommand. In 1276 the Dominicans begged permission to occupy a piece of\r\nground lying between the wall and the river Fleet. Lord Fitzwalter gave\r\nthe Friars the site of Castle Baynard and of Montfichet. They also\r\nobtained permission to pull down the town wall at this place, and to\r\nrebuild it farther west, so as to include their ground. Here the Black\r\nFriars settled and built great buildings, and claimed the right of\r\nsanctuary. Westward of the Black Friars was the house of the Carmelites,\r\ncalled the White Friars. They claimed right of sanctuary also, a right\r\nwhich descended to a haunt of rogues, called Alsatia, an account of\r\nwhich may be read in _The Fortunes of Nigel_:\r\n\r\n“The ancient sanctuary at Whitefriars lay considerably lower than the\r\nelevated terraces and gardens of the Temple, and was therefore generally\r\ninvolved in the fogs and damps of the Thames. The brick buildings by\r\nwhich it was occupied crowded closely on each other.... The wailing of\r\nchildren, the scolding of their mothers, the miserable exhibition of\r\nragged linens hung from the windows to dry, spoke the wants and\r\ndistresses of the wretched inhabitants; while the sounds of complaint\r\nwere mocked and overwhelmed in the riotous shouts, oaths, profane songs,\r\nand boisterous laughter that issued from the alehouses and taverns,\r\nwhich, as the signs indicated, were equal in number to all the other\r\nhouses.”\r\n\r\nWhere is now Bridge Street was formerly the Fleet River, and on its\r\nwestern bank was Bridewell Palace, a palace where the Norman kings held\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe old palace, burnt down in the Great Fire, was built round two\r\ncourtyards; in its later days rebuilt, it followed the frequent fate of\r\nsuch ancient monuments, and became partly a “hospital” for poor boys,\r\npartly a prison for vagrants and other unwanted persons. It was also a\r\nhospital for lunatics, and was put under the same management as\r\nBethlehem in 1557. Bridewell is also fully described in _London in the\r\nEighteenth Century_. The part of London bounded north and south by Fleet\r\nStreet and the River, east and west by New Bridge Street and the Temple,\r\nis now almost entirely occupied by mammoth printing-offices; yet on the\r\nEmbankment are one or two buildings of note: Sion College, opened here\r\nin 1886 to supersede the old building on London Wall; the Guildhall\r\nSchool of Music; the City of London School for Girls (all modern).\r\n\r\nAfter Blackfriars Bridge, running behind the line of wharves and\r\nwarehouses, begins Thames Street, Upper and Lower, once one of the\r\nprincipal thoroughfares in London, a London that knew nothing of what is\r\nnow called the “West End.” It is now a noisy street “pestered” with\r\ndrays and vans, with cranes and their accompaniments, so that to walk\r\ntherein in work-hours is a perilous proceeding.\r\n\r\nYet this ancient street, Thames Street, is, not even excepting West\r\nChepe, the most interesting and the most venerable of all the streets of\r\nLondon. It is the seat of the export and the import trade. From Thames\r\nStreet the City sent abroad the products of the country—the iron, the\r\nwool, the skins and hides; from Thames Street the City distributed the\r\nimports to the various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nOff the wharves of Thames Street lay the shops of all the nations of\r\nWestern Europe. In the narrow lanes leading down to the stairs between\r\nthe quays lived the seafaring folk and those who worked for them, and\r\nthose who worked for the merchants.\r\n\r\nLondon at one time was roughly divided into belts of population. The\r\nfirst belt is that of the Service. It consists of the foreshore between\r\nThames Street and the river, with the lanes and houses upon it. The\r\nsecond is that of the Merchants, between Thames Street and the Markets\r\nof West and East Chepe. The third is that of the Markets. The fourth\r\nthat of the Industries between the Markets and the Wall.\r\n\r\nAs to the first: The Wall of London, when it was first erected, was\r\ncarried along the river from the south-west angle to the Walbrook.\r\nBeyond the Walbrook the south wall of the Roman fortress formed a\r\nriver-wall, which was continued as far as the south-east angle.\r\n\r\nBeyond that stream the south wall of the Roman fort was allowed to\r\nremain as the river-side wall of the City, when all the rest of the\r\nRoman buildings, temples, public edifices, tombs, and villas were\r\nruthlessly pulled down to build the wall towards the end of the fourth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nNow, the wall between the south-west angle and the Walbrook ran along\r\nthe middle of Thames Street. At the time of its construction there were,\r\ntherefore, no buildings between the wall and the river. It was built\r\nabout the middle of the bank, which sloped to the river below, with a\r\nnarrow stretch of mud at low tide; and above it rose on the hill which\r\nstill exists, to the higher ground on which the City stood. The breadth\r\nof the foreshore varied, but, of course, it was not very great. The\r\nfirst break in the wall was that which allowed for the waters of the\r\nWalbrook. Here there was the first port—the Roman port. It may have been\r\nthe only port, unless, in their haste to complete the wall, which was\r\nundoubtedly built under the pressure of panic, the builders deliberately\r\nexcluded other ports. In that case there may have been many, for nothing\r\nwas easier than to make a small port, such as the two which still remain\r\nof Billingsgate and Queenhithe. A small square space was dug in the mud\r\nand shingle of the foreshore. It was maintained by piles placed close\r\ntogether along the three sides of the square, leaving the fourth side\r\nopen for the ships. Other piles furnished support for wharves and quays.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore quite possible that there may have been other such\r\nports. Puddle Dock may have been one. In the absence of any evidence\r\nwhich might lead one even to form a conjecture, we may believe that\r\nQueenhithe, originally Edred’s hithe, was of later, or Saxon,\r\nconstruction; while Billingsgate, close to London Bridge and Bridge\r\nGate, was probably still earlier.\r\n\r\nWhat happened, therefore, was this: On the increase of trade, when\r\nLondon was again settled in the sixth century, wharves and quays began\r\nto be pushed out on piles upon the foreshore of Billingsgate and\r\nWalbrook, or afterwards at other places, when a break in the wall\r\nallowed access to the City. When Queenhithe was constructed as an\r\nadditional port, another break was needed in the wall, and wharves and\r\nquays were built along this part of the foreshore as well. The erection\r\nof the wharf on piles was speedily followed by the erection of tenements\r\nfor the people between the wharf and the wall on the bank. The wharf\r\nextended laterally; the houses grew up laterally with the wharf; the\r\nwharf was pushed out farther upon the mud of the low tide; the wall was\r\nbroken into here and there at intervals, continually growing less in\r\nlength. These breaks are marked, possibly, by the ancient stairs, such\r\nas those of Paul’s Wharf and Trig Stairs.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the whole of the first belt, that of the Service, is later\r\nthan the Roman wall. It belongs, therefore, to the Saxon period, and in\r\ngreat part, perhaps, to the early Norman times. It seems likely that, if\r\nthe riverside wall had been pierced or broken in parts, the Danish and\r\nNorwegian besiegers would have attacked the City at those vulnerable\r\npoints. A narrow stream, such as Walbrook, with wharves on either side,\r\ncould be easily defended by chains drawn across; but a dozen places\r\nwhere the wall was broken—and there was nothing to defend it except\r\nwooden wharves and wooden huts—would have been difficult to defend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLACKFRIARS BRIDGE, 1796\r\n]\r\n\r\nThames Street in later times, when the wall had disappeared, became the\r\nmost crowded, the most busy part of the City. Its south side was wholly\r\noccupied by wharves, warehouses, and the dwellings of the working\r\npeople, the Service of the port. On the north side and in the streets\r\nrising up the hill were the houses of the merchants and the better\r\nclass—the second belt of the City. Here stood the townhouses of the\r\nnobles among the equally stately houses of the merchants. Here kings\r\nwere entertained by the mayors and aldermen. The great number of\r\nchurches shows not only the crowded condition of this part, but also the\r\nwealth of the merchants by whom the churches were founded, rebuilt,\r\nadorned, and endowed.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the foreshore as at present built upon varies from 150\r\nfeet at its narrowest, which is at the western end, to 450 feet at its\r\nbroadest, which is on either side of the Walbrook. The modern breadth,\r\nhowever, must not be taken to represent the breadth in the twelfth\r\ncentury. The excavations for London Bridge in 1831 disclosed three\r\ndistinct lines of piles, representing three several occasions when the\r\nforeshore was built upon. And the oldest plan of London, called after\r\none Agas, clearly represents the erection by the riverside built upon\r\npiles. There are no churches on this belt of reclaimed land. As it was\r\ngradually added to the City, so it was gradually added to the riverside\r\nparishes. Four churches are built on the south side of Thames Street,\r\nviz. Allhallows the Great, Allhallows the Less, St. Botolph, and St.\r\nMagnus. The dedication of the last two proclaims their late origin. The\r\nlast, for instance, must belong to the late eleventh or the twelfth\r\ncentury. The very small size to which the parishes would be reduced if\r\nwe took away the reclaimed foreshore seems to indicate that much was\r\nreclaimed before the Norman Conquest. The dedication of the churches\r\nalong Thames Street—St. Peter, St. James, St. Michael, St. Mary, St.\r\nAndrew—has been supposed to indicate the site of Roman churches. Perhaps\r\nthe parish boundaries may have been adjusted from time to time.\r\n\r\n“Roomland” was the name given to the quays and the adjacent plots of\r\nland of Queenhithe, Dowgate, Billingsgate, etc., whereon goods might be\r\ndischarged out of vessels arriving there.\r\n\r\nIn 1311 and in 1349 we find mention of houses built upon “la Romeland”\r\nby St. Michael, Queenhithe. In 1338, and again in 1349, we read of a\r\ntenement near the King’s garden upon _le Romelonde_, near the Tower. In\r\n1339 we learn that there was a Roomland in the parish of Allhallows\r\nBarking. After 1374 we find no more mention of any Roomland. Perhaps the\r\nlimits of the quays were by this time contracted and defined; perhaps\r\nthe foreshore had been enlarged and the “land” behind had been built\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThames Street was the Exchange, the place of meeting for the merchants.\r\nOne supposes, however, that the lesser sort transacted business at the\r\ntaverns. Here walked in great dignity Aylwin of London Stone, the first\r\nmayor; Whittington, Philpott, Rokesley, and the Beckets, Faringdons,\r\nWalworths, Sevenokes, and all the great men of the City, each in his\r\ngeneration, not only building up their own fortunes, but fighting\r\nagainst disorder and crime in their wards, and against encroachments\r\nfrom the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Fire swept through the street, raging among the stores of the\r\nwarehouses, laying low churches, destroying monuments, and burning up\r\nold memories and associations.\r\n\r\nThe warehouses were at once rebuilt, but, according to Malcolm (1803),\r\nmany of the buildings had in his time become ruinous or decayed. There\r\nis very little left of the building immediately after the Fire: hardly a\r\nsingle warehouse, and on the north side only one or two of the mansions\r\nbuilt by the merchants. The two ports, Billingsgate and Queenhithe,\r\nstill remain, though the trade of the City is no longer carried on upon\r\nthe quays. The Custom House still stands very nearly on its old site;\r\nthe bridge has been moved farther west; there are other City\r\nbridges—Blackfriars and Southwark; one can still walk down lanes as\r\nnarrow as when they were first reclaimed from the foreshore; and there\r\nare still one or two of these narrow lanes where, as of old, the people\r\nof the Service live.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the old signs in Thames Street:\r\n\r\n“The White Bear” inn; “The White Lion” inn near London Bridge; “The\r\nWhite Lion” inn at the White Lion Wharf; “The Blew Ancor” inn; “The Old\r\nSwan” inn; “The Bull Head” inn; “The Naggs Head Tavern” inn; “The\r\nPrinces Arms” inn; “The Fling Hors” inn; “The Lion and Key” inn; “The\r\nBlack Bell inn; “The Woodmongers Arms” inn; “The Crose Bulets” inn; “The\r\nSuggar Lofe” inn; “The Lobster” inn; “The Bear and Ragged Staff” inn;\r\n“The Two Fighting Cocks” inn; “The Blue Boar and Three Horse Shoes” inn;\r\n“The Horse Shoe” inn; “The Royal Arms on Shield” inn; “The Cross against\r\nBarkin Church” inn.\r\n\r\nThames Street itself is the subject of a great many references in the\r\n_Calendar of Wills_ dated from 1275 to 1688. The earliest is in 1275,\r\nafter which they occur repeatedly. In 1280 a tenement is mentioned as\r\nthat of Ernald Thedmar; in 1282 Henry de Coventre bequeathed to his wife\r\nhis mansion in the Vintry from Thames Street to the waterside.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have spoken of Thames Street and the riverside generally; let\r\nus now take our section in detail.\r\n\r\nOnly a short way to the north lay =Ludgate=, one of the principal\r\nentrances to the City.\r\n\r\nLudgate can hardly have been so named later than the Norman Conquest.\r\nStow, in his explanation of the ancient street leading from Aldgate to\r\nLudgate, clearly conveys the belief that it was an ancient gate. Perhaps\r\nthe necessity of land communications from the City to Westminster caused\r\nthe piercing of this gate and the construction of the causeway and the\r\nbridge over the valley and stream of the Fleet. In that case, one would\r\nnaturally think of King Knut and his palace at Westminster. The name is\r\nsaid to mean a postern.\r\n\r\nLudgate was either repaired or rebuilt in 1215, when the barons, in arms\r\nagainst King John, entered London and destroyed the houses of the Jews,\r\nusing the stones in the restoration of the City walls and of Ludgate\r\nmore especially. Stow records a curious confirmation of this\r\ncircumstance, the discovery, when the gate was rebuilt in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, of a stone with a Hebrew inscription, signifying the\r\nsign or note of Rabbi Moses, the son of Rabbi Isaac. On the east side,\r\nin a niche, on this renewal, were placed the statues of Lud and his two\r\nsons in Roman costumes; and on the west side the statue of Queen\r\nElizabeth. When the gates were taken down (1761-62), Lud and his sons\r\nwere given by the City to Sir Francis Gosling, who intended to set them\r\nup at the east end of St. Dunstan’s Church, in Fleet Street. This,\r\nhowever, he did not carry into effect, and the king and his two sons\r\nwere deposited in the parish bone-house. The statue of Elizabeth met\r\nwith a better fate, having a niche assigned it in the outer wall of old\r\nSt. Dunstan’s, Fleet Street. The Lud gate of 1586 was gutted in the\r\nGreat Fire, and the stonework seriously injured.\r\n\r\nLudgate was first erected into a prison in the reign of Richard II., and\r\nwas anciently appropriated to the freemen of the City and to clergymen.\r\nThe place soon became too small for the growing occasions of the City,\r\nand it was enlarged at the expense of Dame Agnes Forster, widow of\r\nStephen Forster, mayor in 1454.\r\n\r\n“Formerly Debtors that were not able to satisfy their debts, put\r\nthemselves into this prison of Ludgate for shelter from their creditors.\r\nAnd these were merchants and tradesmen who had been driven to want by\r\nlosses at sea. When King Philip, in the month of August, 1554, came\r\nfirst through London, these prisoners were thirty in number, and owed\r\n10,000 pounds, but compounded for 2000 pounds, who represented a\r\nwell-penned Latin speech to that Prince to redress their miseries, and\r\nby his royal generosity to free them. ‘And the rather for that place was\r\nnot Sceleratorum Carcer, sed Miserorum Custodia, _i.e._ a gaol for\r\nvillains, but a place of restraint for poor unfortunate men; And that\r\nthey were put in there, not by others, but themselves fled thither; and\r\nthat not out of fear of punishment, but in hope of better fortune.’ The\r\nwhole letter was drawn by the curious pen of Roger Ascham, and is extant\r\namong his epistles, _Lib._ III.” (Cunningham).\r\n\r\nThe rules and customs of Ludgate are given by Strype:\r\n\r\n“If a freeman or freewoman of London be committed to Ludgate, they are\r\nto be excused from the Ignominy of irons, if they can find sureties to\r\nbe true prisoners, and if the sum be not above £100. There is another\r\ncustom for the liberal and mild imprisonment of the citizens in Ludgate;\r\nwhereby they have indulgence and favour to go abroad into any place,\r\nunder the guard and superintendency of their keeper; with whom they must\r\nreturn again to the prison at night.\r\n\r\n“This custom is not to hinder and delay Justice nor to defraud men of\r\ntheir debts and executions, as it is quarrelled against by some, but\r\nserves for a mitigation of their punishment; and tends rather for the\r\nexpedition of their discharge, and speedy satisfaction of their\r\ncreditors. While they may go and inform themselves, upon their mutual\r\nreckonings, both what they owe, and what is due unto them.” For further\r\naccount of this prison see _London in the Eighteenth Century_, pp.\r\n581-87.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1659, one Marmaduke Johnson, a prisoner in Ludgate,\r\npresented a memorandum on the prison and its Government to the Lord\r\nMayor. In this document he sets forth the history of the prison, its\r\nconstitution and laws, its officers, its charities, and the grievances\r\nof the prisoners.\r\n\r\nA great many benefactors have left money to the prison, amounting in all\r\nto about £60 a year. In addition, the Lord Mayor allowed the prisoners a\r\nbasket of broken meat every day; and provisions of some kind were every\r\nday, to some small extent, bestowed upon them by the markets. Besides\r\nwhich there were two grates, one in Ludgate, and the other on the\r\nBlackfriars side, where all day long a man stood crying, “Pity the poor\r\nprisoners.” There were about fifty of the prisoners “on the Charity,” as\r\nit was called. But the warders and turnkeys, by their exactions, got\r\nmost of the money.\r\n\r\n=Ludgate Hill= was formerly Bowyer Lane. On the south, until a few years\r\nago, were to be seen some fragments of London Wall, now vanished.\r\n\r\nOn the top of Ludgate Hill, and on the west side of St. Paul’s, Digby,\r\nGrant, Winter, and Bates were executed, January 30, 1606, for their\r\nparticipation in the Gunpowder Plot.\r\n\r\nThe houses on the south side of the hill were set back when the street\r\nwas widened in modern times. On the north side there are several old\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. MARTIN, LUDGATE\r\n\r\n  This church was rebuilt in 1437 for Sir John Michael, then mayor,\r\n  but was destroyed by the Great Fire, and rebuilt from the designs of\r\n  Wren in 1684. The benefice was united with the united benefices of\r\n  St. Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street, and St. Gregory by St Paul’s,\r\n  by Order in Council, 1890. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1322.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church, long before 1322, was in the hands of:\r\n  The Abbot and Convent of Westminster; Henry VIII., who seized it and\r\n  granted it to the Bishop of Westminster, January 20, 1540-41; the\r\n  Bishop of London, by grant of Edward VI., 1550, confirmed by Queen\r\n  Mary, March 3, 1553-54, in whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 476.\r\n\r\n  The interior of the church is noticeable as being broader and higher\r\n  than it is long, its width being 66 feet, height 59 feet, and length\r\n  51 feet. The appearance is rendered cruciform by four composite\r\n  columns, which, with pilasters on the walls, support entablatures at\r\n  the angles of the church. The ceiling is lowered in the quadrangular\r\n  corners thus formed. The tower rises at the centre of the south\r\n  front, and contains three stories; this is concluded by a cornice,\r\n  above which there is a narrow stone stage surmounted by an octagonal\r\n  cupola, with a lantern and balcony. The steeple is completed by a\r\n  tapering spire, with ball, finial, and vane; its height is 158 feet.\r\n  It is said to have been especially built by Wren to form a\r\n  foreground to the towering dome of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: William Sevenoke, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £3 : 6 : 8 in 1548; Michael de London and John le Hatte,\r\n  augmented by Roger Payn, William Pows, Simon Newell, and Thomas\r\n  Froddashame, to which John de Derby was admitted as chaplain,\r\n  January 11, 1392-93, on being vacated by Roger Shirrene; William\r\n  Alsone, who also founded chantries in Northants and Derbys.\r\n\r\n  William Sevenoke, grocer, who founded a free school and almshouses\r\n  in the town of Sevenoaks, Kent, Mayor of London, 1419, was buried\r\n  here and commemorated by a monument. The other monuments recorded by\r\n  Stow are of little note. No benefactors are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  Sixty boys and fifty girls, belonging to the charity school of the\r\n  ward, were clothed and disposed of (when fit) by subscriptions from\r\n  the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  William Glyn (d. 1558), Bishop of Bangor, was rector here; also\r\n  Richard Rawlins (d. 1536), Bishop of St. David’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photochrom Co., Ltd._\r\n\r\n  LUDGATE CIRCUS AND LUDGATE HILL\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn Ludgate Hill we find also Stationers’ Court, where is the Stationers’\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE STATIONERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Company was incorporated in 1557, but it is believed that a\r\n  brotherhood or society existed upwards of a century and a half\r\n  previously, called the Brotherhood or Society of Text-writers.\r\n\r\n  There was a Gild of Stationers as early as the beginning of the\r\n  fifteenth century. It appears to have been a branch of the\r\n  Scriveners, and to have left them to carry on the preparation of\r\n  legal documents while they themselves took over the production of\r\n  books. The charter of the Company shows that it was regarded as a\r\n  company of printers, and that Queen Mary intended it to be\r\n  especially a guard against the issue of heretical doctrines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. H Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  STATIONERS’ HALL IN 1830\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The original charter was destroyed in the Fire of London, but the\r\n  Company have a copy of it; also of the charter granted by William\r\n  and Mary, confirming the privileges granted by the charter of 1556.\r\n\r\n  The Company has continued ever since its incorporation, and still\r\n  is, a trade guild consisting exclusively of members of the trade of\r\n  a stationer, printer, publisher, or bookmaker, and their children,\r\n  and descendants born free. The greater number of printers’\r\n  apprentices in the City of London are bound at Stationers’ Hall, and\r\n  the Company’s pensioners, and the recipients of the charities under\r\n  their control, are principally journeymen printers, compositors, and\r\n  pressmen.\r\n\r\n  The Company was originally established for the purpose of fostering\r\n  and encouraging the trade of a printer, publisher, and stationer,\r\n  and from the time of its original foundation to this date a limited\r\n  number of liverymen of the Company have carried on at Stationers’\r\n  Hall the trade of a publisher for their own benefit, and a division\r\n  of profits has been annually made amongst the partners. Other\r\n  portion of the profits has been distributed annually amongst poor\r\n  freemen of the Company, applied towards the necessary expenses of\r\n  the Company, and invested in the purchase of the hall and premises\r\n  adjoining. The capital for this trade was originally subscribed by\r\n  the members of the Company in certain proportions or shares, and\r\n  these shares have been regularly transmitted from time to time since\r\n  1605, as in the case of shares of trade companies.\r\n\r\n  The copyright registry was first established by the Company at the\r\n  commencement of the sixteenth century or even earlier. It would\r\n  appear from the ancient records that a register of copies had\r\n  existed previous to the incorporation. In 1565 rules were made by\r\n  the Company regulating the transmission of copies upon the decease\r\n  of the owner, and requiring them to be entered in the books of the\r\n  Company. In 1584 the Privy Council (through the Lord Mayor) ordered\r\n  that all copies should be entered in the Company’s register, and\r\n  copyrights were from time to time transferred by entries in these\r\n  registers. Between 1580 and 1615, there are letters from the Lords\r\n  of the Council and the Lord Mayor calling attention to the\r\n  publication of certain books of a traitorous or mischievous\r\n  tendency. There is no mention of any power or authority belonging to\r\n  the Stationers Company for the suppression of these books. On one\r\n  occasion the Wardens of that Company are ordered to produce the\r\n  printer of a certain pamphlet with the person who was circulating\r\n  it. Various orders were from time to time issued by the Lords of the\r\n  Privy Council and High Commissioners, regulating printing. In 1660 a\r\n  committee of the House of Commons was appointed to prepare a Bill\r\n  regulating printing, and in 1662 the Bill was passed, and was known\r\n  as the Licensing Act. It required all printed works to be registered\r\n  at Stationers’ Hall. This Act expired in 1681, and in 1710 the first\r\n  copyright Act was passed, which has been superseded by the Act of\r\n  1842. The Act of 1710 required copies to be entered at Stationers’\r\n  Hall before publication, and the Act of 1842 makes entry at\r\n  Stationers’ Hall a condition precedent to the title to sue for\r\n  protection against infringements. As a printer, not as a novelist,\r\n  Samuel Richardson was a member.\r\n\r\n  The most ancient hall stood in Milk Street, Cheapside, but in 1553\r\n  the Company moved to St. Peter’s College, near the Deanery of St.\r\n  Paul’s, and in 1611 they purchased Abergavenny House in Stationers’\r\n  Court. This was burnt in the Great Fire. The present building was\r\n  erected in 1670, and in 1805 the exterior was cased in Portland\r\n  stone, according to a design by the Company’s architect, Robert\r\n  Mylne, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  The present livery is 284; the Corporate Income is but small, and\r\n  the Trust Income £1200.\r\n\r\n  The Company formerly published almanacks, primers, “A.B.C.’s,”\r\n  psalters, and school books, in which they maintained a valuable\r\n  monopoly until the middle of the eighteenth century, when it was\r\n  declared illegal.\r\n\r\n  The Company established a school at Bolt Court, Fleet Street, in\r\n  1861; this is now at Ridge Road, Hornsey. The school has\r\n  accommodation for more than three hundred boys.\r\n\r\nThis corner of London to the south of Ludgate Hill was covered with\r\nnarrow lanes and courts into which light was admitted by the\r\nconstruction of Queen Victoria Street. It is the site of the\r\n=Blackfriars’ Precinct=. This house was in the hands of the Dominicans.\r\nSee _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 354.\r\n\r\nChurch Entry marks the site of\r\n\r\n  =St. Anne, Blackfriars=, standing adjacent to the walls of\r\n  Blackfriars’ Monastery; it was consecrated in 1597 by Edmund\r\n  Stanhope, Doctor of Laws, by virtue of a commission from the Bishop\r\n  of London. It was enlarged on the south side in 1613, which was\r\n  consecrated by the Bishop of London in 1617. The church was burnt\r\n  down in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, but the parish was annexed\r\n  to St. Andrew by the Wardrobe. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1597.\r\n\r\n  The patronage was in the hands of the Crown and parishioners\r\n  alternately, since the Great Fire when it was burnt down, and the\r\n  parish was annexed to St. Andrew by the Wardrobe; before this the\r\n  parishioners presented.\r\n\r\n  Isaac Oliver, miniature painter, was buried here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STATIONERS’ HALL (INTERIOR)\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The charities and reliefs recorded in this parish were few. John\r\n  Bobhurst was a donor of £2 per annum, also Edward Corbet and Mrs.\r\n  Miller. The greatest benefactor was Peter Jorge, who founded a free\r\n  school, appointing Sion College trustees.\r\n\r\n  Forty boys and thirty girls were to be taught reading and writing,\r\n  and some useful work besides. All were to be given clothing once a\r\n  year and two to be put out as apprentices. The school was endowed\r\n  with £150 a year, and salaries for teachers. As there were many\r\n  tailors among the foundation, the children of such were to have\r\n  preference of admission (Stow and Strype).\r\n\r\n  St. Anne’s had some notable vicars, among them William Gouge (or\r\n  Goughe), D.D., forty-six years minister of the parish. In November\r\n  1633 “Mr. William Goughe, Doctor of Divinity, prayed to be admitted\r\n  freeman of the Society of Apothecaries, and was so.”\r\n\r\nOn the west is an open space fairly wide, with asphalt centre and\r\nscrubby bushes round. This is jealously guarded by iron rails and wall\r\nfrom all intruders. It was sacred ground, the churchyard, though there\r\nare no monuments or stones left to bear testimony. Close beside the\r\nchurchyard in a carpenter’s shop are certain old arches belonging to the\r\nDominicans’ Buildings.\r\n\r\nWestward there is a small court, called Fleur-de-Lys, on the west side\r\nof St. Anne’s churchyard, which escaped the Fire, though here the Fire\r\nhad raged most hotly. A little consideration will show the reason. An\r\nopen space called Church Entry lay between the backs of the Fleur-de-Lys\r\nHouses and St. Anne’s Church and churchyard. Now the church stood high,\r\nand during the continuance of the Fire the wind blew steadily from the\r\neast. The view of the City after the Fire shows that the walls of the\r\nchurches and of many houses were still standing. Therefore, even though\r\nthe roof was burned, the flames blew _over_ this court, while, when the\r\nroof had fallen, the walls of the church sheltered the little court on\r\nthe other side. I dare say that, had we a more exact account of the\r\nFire, it would be found that many houses or courts escaped in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Eminent inhabitants—(of Blackfriars), Isaac Oliver, the\r\nminiature-painter. He died here in 1617, and was buried in St. Anne’s,\r\nBlackfriars. Lady Ayres, wishing to have a copy of Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury’s picture to wear in her bosom, went ‘to Mr. Isaac the painter\r\nin Blackfriars, and desired him to draw it in little after his\r\nmanner.’—Cornelius Jansen, the painter (d. 1665). He lived in the\r\nBlackfriars for several years, and had much business, but left it a\r\nlittle before Van Dyck’s arrival. Sir Anthony Van Dyck, from his\r\nsettlement in England in 1632, to his death in 1641. The rent of his\r\nhouse, ‘at a moderate value,’ was estimated, in 1638, at £20, and the\r\ntithe paid £1 : 6 : 8. His daughter Justina was born here December 1,\r\n1641, and baptised in St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, December 9, 1641, the day\r\nof her father’s death. Ben Jonson, who dates his dedication of Volpone\r\nor The Fox ‘from my house in the Blackfriars, this 11th day of February,\r\n1607.’ Here he has laid the scene of The Alchemist. The Earl and\r\nCountess of Somerset were living in the Blackfriars when Overbury was\r\nmurdered. The precinct no longer exists, but is now a part of the ward\r\nof Farringdon Within. I have not been able to trace any attempt to\r\nassert its privileges later than 1735, when in the July of that year the\r\nCourt of Common Council brought an action against Daniel Watson, for\r\nopening a shop and vending shoes in the Blackfriars without being free\r\nof the City. The court of King’s Bench gave it in favour of the City.\r\nThe sheriffs could arrest here many years before” (Cunningham).\r\n\r\nNote that the Earl of Northumberland had a town house in 1612 in the\r\nunfashionable precinct of Blackfriars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FLEUR-DE-LYS COURT\r\n]\r\n\r\nWithin the precinct were—and are—several places of interest. The\r\nBlackfriars Theatre was built in 1576. It was rebuilt or extensively\r\nrepaired in 1596 when Shakespeare and Richard Burbage were sharers. In\r\n1633 it was let by Cuthbert and William Burbage for a rent of £50. The\r\nbuilding was pulled down in 1655 and tenements put up in its place.\r\nPlayhouse Yard preserves the memory of the theatre.\r\n\r\nStanding at the western end of Queen Victoria Street and taking a\r\ngeneral view we see St. Paul’s Station of the L.B. and S.C. Railway.\r\n=Water Lane= runs by the railway. Here is the Apothecaries’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE APOTHECARIES COMPANY\r\n\r\n  Two opposite forces acted upon the City Companies: one separating\r\n  them and multiplying Companies for different parts of the same trade\r\n  or craft; the other uniting in one Company crafts which were related\r\n  chiefly by using the same material. Thus the Barbers divided into\r\n  Barbers and Surgeons; the Grocers into Grocers and Apothecaries;\r\n  while at one time the Weavers included in their body all those\r\n  trades which had to do with woven stuffs, and were so powerful that\r\n  they threatened to rule the whole City. It happened sometimes that\r\n  some trades were injured by the inability of the Company to look\r\n  after them. Thus it was quite natural that the Grocers who imported\r\n  drugs and spices and oils used by Apothecaries should include these\r\n  persons in their own livery. But, the wardens not being skilled in\r\n  the use of medical prescriptions and preparations, could not look\r\n  after their own people. Consequently complaints became general of\r\n  the ignorance and incompetence of Apothecaries for want of proper\r\n  supervision. Towards the end of the sixteenth century these\r\n  complaints were brought forward categorically. It took time for the\r\n  matter to be understood, and it was not until 1617 that James\r\n  bestowed a separate charter upon the Apothecaries in spite of the\r\n  remonstrances of the Grocers.\r\n\r\n  The objects of this charter, concisely stated, are to restrain the\r\n  Grocers (the former associates of the Apothecaries) or any other\r\n  City Company from keeping an apothecary’s shop or exercising the\r\n  “art, faculty, or mystery of an apothecary within the City of London\r\n  or a radius of seven miles.” To allow no one to do so unless\r\n  apprenticed to an apothecary for seven years at least, and at the\r\n  expiration of such apprenticeship such apprentice to be approved and\r\n  allowed by the master and wardens and representatives of the College\r\n  of Physicians, before being permitted to keep an apothecary’s shop,\r\n  or prepare, dispense, commix, or compound medicines. To give the\r\n  right of search within the City of London or a radius of seven miles\r\n  of the shops of apothecaries or others, and “prove” the drugs, and\r\n  to examine within the same radius all persons “professing, using, or\r\n  exercising the art or mystery of apothecaries.”\r\n\r\n  It also confers the power to burn “before the offender’s doors” any\r\n  unwholesome drugs, and to summon the offenders before the\r\n  magistrates.\r\n\r\n  And to buy, sell, or make drugs. Up to the passing of the\r\n  Apothecaries Act, 1815, so far as the prescribed radius extended,\r\n  the three first-stated objects of the charter and the existence of\r\n  the society in relation to its members were identical. A member of\r\n  the Society of Apothecaries and an apothecary of the City of London\r\n  or within seven miles were convertible terms.\r\n\r\n  As regards the fourth object prescribed by the charter, the Society,\r\n  doubtless from its want of means, has never itself until the present\r\n  time bought, sold, or made drugs, but owing to the great difficulty\r\n  of its members obtaining pure drugs it allowed them to raise money\r\n  themselves and create stock or shares for that purpose, and to carry\r\n  on such trade in the name of the Society for their own personal\r\n  profit as a private Company or partnership under various titles.\r\n  Owing to such trade having ended in a loss, this private partnership\r\n  was dissolved in 1880, and the Society is now itself carrying on the\r\n  trade at its own risk.\r\n\r\n  As regards the three first-stated powers of the charter, the Society\r\n  (by means of the Apothecaries Act of 1815) extended them so greatly\r\n  as to effect not only a revolution in their own sphere of\r\n  operations, but also in the medical profession and in the relations\r\n  subsisting between the latter and the general public.\r\n\r\n  This Act (after placing the right of search referred to in the\r\n  third-stated power of the charter on a more precise and practical\r\n  basis, but to which it is unnecessary to allude as having fallen\r\n  into necessary desuetude by the various Pharmacy and Poisons Acts)\r\n  created a court of 12 examiners to be appointed by the master,\r\n  wardens, and court of assistants, who were to examine all persons in\r\n  England and Wales as to their skill and ability in the science and\r\n  practice of medicine, and five examiners to examine assistants for\r\n  the compounding and dispensing of medicine. It authorised the\r\n  Society to receive fees for granting the respective licences, and\r\n  (saving the rights of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons) it\r\n  empowered the Society to recover penalties for practising or\r\n  compounding without such licences.\r\n\r\n  The Apothecaries Act, 1815, contained, however, two restrictions\r\n  which were removed by the Apothecaries Act Amendment Act, 1874,\r\n  namely, (_a_) the obligation of the 12 examiners being members of\r\n  the Society of Apothecaries, and being of at least 10 years’\r\n  standing, and (_b_) of candidates for examination having served an\r\n  apprenticeship of five years to an apothecary.\r\n\r\n  The Act of 1874 also contains other provisions which relate more to\r\n  questions of medical legislation than this present inquiry. Shortly\r\n  the effect of the Act of 1815 was to make the Society of\r\n  Apothecaries one of the three great medical licensing bodies for\r\n  England and Wales [the number of its present licentiates is between\r\n  8000 and 9000], and of the Act of 1874 was to throw open the\r\n  Society’s examinerships, and to confer on it a freedom in reference\r\n  to future medical reform to an extent not exceeded by any other\r\n  body.\r\n\r\n  The Company consists of about 400 members including the court, the\r\n  livery, and the yeomanry or freemen.\r\n\r\n  The hall, which stands on the eastern side of Water Lane, formerly\r\n  consisted of the town house of Lady Howard of Effingham. It was, of\r\n  course, destroyed by the Fire, but the buildings which were erected\r\n  after the Fire have a delightful air of quiet and peace, such as\r\n  belongs very fitly to a scientific society. The hall stands behind a\r\n  small paved court; on the left hand is the shop, at the north end of\r\n  the hall are the offices, the library and the court rooms. The\r\n  Physic Gardens at Chelsea also belong to the Apothecaries on certain\r\n  conditions, especially that the Company should every year present to\r\n  the Royal Society fifty dried specimens of plants growing in these\r\n  gardens, till the number of 2000 was reached. As this was in 1731,\r\n  that number has long since passed and the Company’s debt is paid.\r\n\r\n  Among the more eminent members of this Company have been William and\r\n  John Hunter, Jenner, Smollett, Humphry Davy, Dr. Sydenham, Erasmus\r\n  Wilson, and Sir Spencer Wells. Oliver Goldsmith and Keats were also\r\n  members.\r\n\r\n=Printing House Square= contained the King’s Printing House.\r\n\r\n“The first I have discovered was John Bill, who, ‘at the King’s Printing\r\nHouse in Black Friars,’ printed the proclamations of the reign of\r\nCharles II., and the first London Gazette, established in that reign.\r\nCharles Eyre and William Strahan were the last King’s printers who\r\nresided here, and in February, 1770, the King’s Printing House was\r\nremoved to New Street, near Gough Square, in Fleet Street, where it now\r\nis. The place still continues to deserve its name of Printing House\r\nSquare, for here every day in the week (Sunday excepted) _The Times_\r\nnewspaper is printed and published, and from hence distributed over the\r\nwhole civilized world. This celebrated paper, finding daily employment\r\non the premises for between 200 and 300 people, was established in\r\n1788,—the first number appearing on the 1st of January in that year.”\r\n(Cunningham.) _The Times_ office is a very notable feature in Queen\r\nVictoria Street by reason of its great height and conspicuous clock.\r\nQueen Victoria Street and Upper Thames Street gradually diverge at a\r\nvery acute angle. The former is on a lower level than the latter, and is\r\ndivided from it for about seventy yards by a low wall only, with an open\r\nspace crossed by steps. In Queen Victoria Street on the left is the\r\nsquare tower of St. Andrew by the Wardrobe, outlined in white stone, and\r\nthrown into relief by a rather ornamental red-brick building which\r\nstands in front.\r\n\r\n=St. Andrew’s Hill= was sometimes called Puddle Dock Hill. In Ireland\r\nYard stood the house bought by Shakespeare in 1612, and bequeathed by\r\nhim to his daughter Susanne Hall. In Green Dragon Court there stood,\r\nuntil a year or two ago, one of the oldest of the London taverns from\r\nwhich the court took its name.\r\n\r\n=The Wardrobe.=—On the north side of St. Andrew’s church stands a small\r\nsquare which, with its trees and the absence of vehicles or shops, is\r\none of the most quiet spots in the whole City. This square was formerly\r\nthe court of the town house built by Sir John Beauchamp (d. 1359), whose\r\ntomb in St. Paul’s Cathedral was commonly called Duke Humphrey’s tomb.\r\nBefore his death the house became the property of King Edward III. who\r\nmade it a Royal Wardrobe House, and so it remained until the Great Fire.\r\nJames I. gave the collection of dresses—called by Fuller a “Library of\r\nantiquaries wherein to read the fashion and mode of garments in all\r\nages”—to the Earl of Dunbar, by whom they were all sold and dispersed.\r\nThe wardrobe was taken after the Fire to the Savoy and then to\r\nBuckingham Street, Strand. The last keeper was Ralph, Duke of Montagu\r\n(d. 1709).\r\n\r\nWhen Charles V. came to England in 1522, among the lodgings assigned to\r\nhis suite was the house of Margaret Hanley, “under the Wardrobe side,\r\nhaving two chambers and two beds.”\r\n\r\n=Wardrobe Place= is a delightful spot with an air of brooding quietness.\r\nThe houses are nearly all old “post fire,” dating from about 200 years\r\nago. That on the east side of the entry is black with age, and the lines\r\nin the brickwork waver as they cross its front. Next to it on the east\r\nside of the court is a plaster-fronted one, and then a row of three\r\ndark-brick houses with the so-called “flat arch” of brighter red bricks\r\nglowing above the rectangular windows. Nearly a dozen twisted plane\r\ntrees, all young, and measured by inches only in circumference, straggle\r\nirregularly from the cobblestones of the courtyard. On the west side\r\nthere are charming houses in the same style as the above-mentioned. The\r\nlargest of these, No. 2, is wainscotted from floor to ceiling, and has\r\nin many rooms great projecting fireplaces forming recesses on either\r\nside half the width of the rooms. From the south-east corner there is a\r\ncovered-in passage leading to the back of the Old Bell Hotel, and with\r\nWardrobe Chambers opening into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. ANDREW BY THE WARDROBE\r\n\r\n  The church derived its title from its proximity to the\r\n  King’s Wardrobe above described. It was formerly called St.\r\n  Andrew-juxta-Baynard’s Castle. After the Great Fire, the church was\r\n  rebuilt by Wren and completed in 1692, and the parish of St. Anne,\r\n  Blackfriars, was united with it. The earliest date of an incumbent\r\n  is 1261.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of this church was in the hands of: The family of\r\n  Fitzwalter, Lords of Woodham, 1361, which becoming extinct, it\r\n  passed to Thomas, Lord Berkeley, then to Richard, Earl Warwick, who\r\n  married Berkeley’s daughter; the three daughters of the Countess of\r\n  Warwick, viz. Lady Talbot, afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury; Lady\r\n  Ross; and Lady Latimer, afterwards Countess of Dorset in 1439; and\r\n  the Crown, since St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, was annexed to it.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 450.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency_.\r\n\r\n  BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  This church measures 75 feet in length, 59 in breadth, and 38 feet\r\n  in height, and contains two side aisles divided from the nave by\r\n  square pillars, encased in wood to the height of the top of the\r\n  galleries. The ceiling is exceptionally fine, with beautifully\r\n  moulded wreaths. The exterior is of red brick with stone dressings.\r\n  The tower, which is square and of four stories, rises at the\r\n  south-west; the two lower ones contain windows, the third a clock,\r\n  and the highest has square-headed openings with louvres. A cornice\r\n  and balustrade complete the tower, which is about 86 feet in height.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: John Parraunt, armiger, for himself\r\n  and Clemencia his late wife, and for John Loc, alias Foxton, citizen\r\n  and fishmonger, and Margaret, his wife (licence was granted December\r\n  3, 1409; the endowment fetched £12 : 3 : 4 in 1518 when Thomas Mores\r\n  was priest, “aged 54, meanly learned”); Humphrey Talbot, whose\r\n  endowment fetched £7 : 6 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  There are three pyramidal monuments of white marble to three\r\n  successive rectors—the Rev. William Romaine, a celebrated preacher;\r\n  the Rev. William Goode, rector in 1795; and the Rev. Isaac Saunders,\r\n  who held the living for nearly twenty years.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of charities were: John Lee, of a house and\r\n  wharf, leased for £30 per annum; Mrs. Paradine, £3 per annum; Mrs.\r\n  Cleve, thirteen penny loaves to be dealt out every Sunday.\r\n\r\n  There was a free school founded by a private person for the benefit\r\n  of the children of poor tailors, where forty boys and thirty girls\r\n  were taught and clothed. Also three almshouses maintained by the\r\n  rent of an adjoining house, built partly by charity of the Lady\r\n  Elizabeth, Viscountess Chomondeley, and partly at the expense of the\r\n  inhabitants, in 1679.\r\n\r\n  Among the most notable of the rectors were: Philip Baker (d. 1601),\r\n  Vice-Chancellor Cambridge University; William Savage (d. 1736),\r\n  Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; William Romaine (1714-1795),\r\n  Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London; William Goode\r\n  (1762-1816), President of Sion College; John Harding (1805-74),\r\n  Bishop of Bombay.\r\n\r\nA little passage, right-of-way to the public, goes round the north and\r\neast sides of the church, and at the corner where this joins St.\r\nAndrew’s Hill stands the old Rectory House. This is a charming old\r\nbuilding, dating from soon after the Fire. There is, curiously enough,\r\nno oak in the woodwork, excepting only in the cross-pieces of the\r\nwindow-frames. The fireplace in the study is of interest, fashioned of\r\nmarble and tiles set in polished wood; and on the overmantel there is a\r\nlittle slab bearing the words, all in capital letters:\r\n\r\n  Laus Deo per Jesum Christum. Church Missionary Society, Instituted\r\n  April 12, 1799, in this room; the committee meetings of the Society\r\n  were held from June 17, 1799, to January 3, 1812: and here on\r\n  January 2, 1804, its first missionaries were appointed to preach\r\n  among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe house betrays its age in all its lines, and though there is no other\r\nspecial feature worthy of comment in it, the tiny garden behind is well\r\nworth a visit; it contains a plane-tree, and is a curious little oasis\r\nin a wilderness of bricks and mortar.\r\n\r\n=Queen Victoria Street= was only begun in 1867-68 as a direct\r\nthoroughfare from the embankment to the Mansion House. It was formally\r\nopened November 4, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the British and Foreign Bible Society is solidly\r\ndesigned, with pilasters running up the front between the windows. Over\r\nthe great door, supported by blocks of polished granite, is a heavy\r\nstone balcony, and three smaller balconies project from the windows\r\nabove. An ornamental cornice runs round the roof. The architect was Mr.\r\nEdward l’Anson.\r\n\r\nThe library contains the Fry collection of English Bibles, the most\r\ncomplete ever made. This was purchased by the Society for £6000. It\r\nincludes a copy of the earliest edition of _Coverdale_ printed abroad\r\n1535, and one of the earliest editions printed in England two years\r\nlater. In the cases about the room are many objects of interest—a German\r\nBible printed 1473; Codex Zacynthus, a palimpsest, of which the earlier\r\nwriting is supposed to date from the fifth or sixth century, the later\r\nfrom the twelfth. The Society was founded in 1804. Its object is simply\r\nto “circulate the Bible without note or comment, in all languages and in\r\nall lands.”\r\n\r\nSince its foundation over 140 million copies of the Bible, whole or in\r\nparts, have been issued. The Society now produces the Bible in about 330\r\nlanguages and dialects. The University Press monopolises the printing of\r\nEnglish Bibles, and much of the printing of the Society in foreign\r\nlanguages is done abroad. The only actual printing carried on in Queen\r\nVictoria Street is that done by one man, who works with two hand-presses\r\nfor the blind. But the issue of fresh copies by the Society comes to an\r\naverage of 13,000 for every working day.\r\n\r\nThe General Post Office Savings Bank offices, with a frontage of about\r\n250 feet, are next door. The garden belonging to the old Doctors Commons\r\nstretched across the roadway at this point, and was only finally cleared\r\naway in 1867 at the making of the new street.\r\n\r\nThe Heralds’ College or College of Arms is a fine old building in\r\ndeep-coloured brick. The front stands back from the street, and is\r\nsupported by two wings. The small courtyard resulting is separated from\r\nthe street front by high iron railings and gates. There are two brick\r\nand stone piers at each gateway, with that favourite ornament of the\r\nStuart period—stone balls—on their summits. The back of the eastern wing\r\nabuts on Peter’s Hill, and the wide, outside flap shutters of an\r\nold-world style give the little hill a quaint aspect. The College was\r\nrebuilt after the Fire, and restored at the opening of Queen Victoria\r\nStreet. It was originally Derby House, built by the first Earl of Derby\r\nand presented in 1555 by Queen Mary to the then Garter King-of-Arms; so\r\nit has long been devoted to its present use. Returning to Queen Victoria\r\nStreet we see opposite in enormous gilt letters, each four or five feet\r\nlong, “Salvation Army International Headquarters” right across the front\r\nof a great building.\r\n\r\n=Addle Hill=, like Addle Street, is supposed to be derived from the\r\nSaxon Adel, _noble_. It has been found written Adling Hill. The whole\r\nspace between Addle Hill and Bell Yard, and between Queen Victoria\r\nStreet and Carter Lane, with the exception of Knightrider Street, is now\r\noccupied by General Post Office Savings Bank Department. Northward, on\r\nthe south side of St. Paul’s Churchyard, near the west end, was the\r\nchurch of St. Gregory mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=Carter Lane= was formerly divided into Great and Little Carter Lane.\r\nFrom the Bell Inn, Bell Yard, in Carter Lane, the only letter addressed\r\nto Shakespeare that is known to exist was sent to him by Richard\r\nQuiney—“To my loveing good friend and country man, Mr. William\r\nShakespeare, deliver these.” Bell Yard led to the Prerogative Will\r\nOffice, Doctors’ Commons.\r\n\r\nCarter Lane, also called Shoemakers’ Row, is mentioned in the _Calendar\r\nof Wills_ in the year 1295. The west end still retains that name in\r\nOgilby’s map of 1677. In 1424 the exchequer paid to John Kyllyngham,\r\nmaster of a house called The Bell in Carter Lane, the sum of £17 : 14 :\r\n8 for costs and expenses of Sir Gilbyn de Lauvoy, knight, and John de la\r\nRoe, Esq., and their servants and horses for twenty-eight days. The said\r\nSir Gilbyn and John de la Roe had been sent to the Holy Land by Henry V.\r\n“upon certain important causes.” Deeds of the fourteenth century speak\r\nof tenements in Carter Lane. In this street were several taverns of note\r\nsuch as the White Horse, the Sun, the Bell, and the Saracen’s Head. Here\r\nwas a famous meeting-house in which many of the most distinguished of\r\nNonconformist ministers preached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency_.\r\n\r\n  THE COLLEGE OF ARMS\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere is the school for St. Paul’s choir-boys, with a stencilled frieze.\r\nThe playground is on the roof.\r\n\r\n=Creed Lane= was formerly called Sporier Row. An inn in Sporier Row is\r\nassigned in the fifteenth century by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s\r\nto their canons. After the Fire there were differences as to the sites\r\nand boundaries of houses destroyed in Creed Lane. The Lane was widened\r\nin 1750 as one of the improvements made at that time.\r\n\r\nDean’s Court has now warehouses erected on the north and east sides. The\r\nhouse over the archway was said to have been occupied by Sir Christopher\r\nWren as his office during the building of St. Paul’s. Within this court\r\nwere also the vicar general’s, the commissary and the consistory courts,\r\nand offices for procuring marriage licences.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter’s College adjoined Dean’s Court on the west side in St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard (see under the Stationers Company, p. 199).\r\n\r\nWhen Charles V. came to London in 1522, Doctors’ Commons among other\r\nplaces furnished for his suite a hall, a parlour, and three chambers\r\nwith feather beds. Mention is made of the dining-hall of Doctors’\r\nCommons and of the “entre going into the great canonicale House now\r\nnaymed the Doctors’ Commons with a chamber over the said entre,” and of\r\nother parts of the building.\r\n\r\nThis ancient College or House of Doctors of Law was swept away in\r\n1861-67 in consequence of alterations in legal procedure. The courts\r\nwere removed, and the business of the proctors was merged in the\r\nordinary work of the High Courts of Justice and the Bar.\r\n\r\nThe Deanery itself is on the west side standing back behind a high brick\r\nwall, painted yellow. It is attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, and was\r\nbuilt soon after the Great Fire. The stone piers of the gates are\r\nsurmounted by cones. The building itself is tiled with three dormer\r\nwindows standing out from the roof and heavy projecting eaves. In the\r\ninterior there is no carving or anything of antiquarian interest calling\r\nfor remark, but the front door has some rich wood-carving in the style\r\nof Grinling Gibbons.\r\n\r\nPaul’s Chain and the greater part of St. Bennet’s Hill are now Godliman\r\nStreet. The origin of the name “Godliman” is unknown. Cunningham says\r\nthat the earliest mention of the name is 1732. It is not found in Ogilby\r\nnor in Strype. It has been spelt “Godalmin.”\r\n\r\nA little court named Paul’s Bakehouse seems to have been asleep while\r\nthe rest of the world passed it by. It is true the house immediately\r\nfronting the entry is covered with ugly yellow plaster, but it is by no\r\nmeans obtrusively modern, and if we except an iron railing in the corner\r\nover an area in the north-east, and the house above it, the remainder of\r\nthe court has been touched by time alone since it left the builders’\r\nhands in the seventeenth century. The houses on the north and south\r\nsides are of brick; the northern ones bulge forward out of the\r\nperpendicular, and they have low wooden doorways. That in the south-west\r\ncorner is supported by grooved pilasters. The northern building claims a\r\nbetter staircase in the interior—a staircase with spiral balusters and\r\ncarved woodwork, low and substantial.\r\n\r\n=Knightrider Street.=—Why this street should be named, as Stow says,\r\n“after knights riding” more than any other street, it is impossible to\r\nexplain. One may, however, suppose that it was named after some branch\r\nof the Armourers’ or Loriners’ Craft. Dr. Linacre lived here.\r\nKnightrider Street now extends to Queen Victoria Street, but formerly\r\nthe eastern part from Old Change was called Old Fish Street. Do Little\r\nLane, between Carter Lane and Knightrider Street, now Knightrider Court,\r\nis found in many ancient documents called “Dolite,” “Do Lyttle,”\r\n“Doelittle” in deeds of Edwards I., II., and III.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DOCTORS’ COMMONS, 1808\r\n\r\n  From a drawing by Rowlandson and Pugin.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. NICHOLAS COLE ABBEY\r\n\r\n  The church stands in Knightrider Street; it has been known by\r\n  several other names, Coldenabbey, Coldbey, etc. It was burnt down in\r\n  the Great Fire, and rebuilt from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren\r\n  in 1677, when the parish of St. Nicholas Olave was annexed. In 1873\r\n  it was thoroughly repaired. Four other parishes were subsequently\r\n  united. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1319.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Dean of St.\r\n  Martin’s-le-Grand, then the Abbot and Convent of Westminster, 1532.\r\n  Henry VIII., who seized it, and so continued in the Crown till Queen\r\n  Elizabeth granted it in 1559 to Thomas Reeve and George Evelyn, from\r\n  whom it passed to several private persons and at length came to the\r\n  Hacker family in 1575, one of whom, Colonel Francis Hacker, was\r\n  involved in the beheading of Charles I.; he was finally executed as\r\n  a traitor, his estate including this advowson being forfeited and\r\n  thus it came to the Crown, and so continued until St. Nicholas Olave\r\n  was annexed after the Great Fire, when the patronage was shared\r\n  alternately with the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 180.\r\n\r\n  The interior of the church, which contains no aisles, measures 63\r\n  feet in length, 43 feet in breadth, and 36 feet in height. The\r\n  steeple, which rises at the north-west, consists of a tower of four\r\n  stories concluded by a cornice with urns at each angle; above this a\r\n  spire rises, completed by a balcony, and supporting a square\r\n  pedestal with a finial, ball, and vane. The total height is about\r\n  135 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By John Sywarde and Thomas Blode, who\r\n  endowed it with lands which fetched £6 in 1548, when Anthony Little\r\n  was priest “of 50 years and of mean learning”; by John Tupley, who\r\n  left lands and tenements valued at £12 : 8 : 4 in 1548, when Ralph\r\n  Jackson was priest “of 30 years of age and very well learned”;\r\n  Thomas Barnard, John Saunderash, and William Cogshale, who gave\r\n  their lands in Distaff Lane to endow the same, which yielded £7 :\r\n  6 : 8 in 1548, when William Benson was priest, “46 years of age, and\r\n  a very poor and sickly man.”\r\n\r\n  The church contained no monuments of any special note. Walter Turke,\r\n  mayor in 1349, was interred here.\r\n\r\n  Barnard Randolph bequeathed £900 to this parish and St. Mary\r\n  Magdalene for charities; he died in 1583. No other names are\r\n  recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  Herbert Kynaston (1809-1878), High Master of St. Paul’s School, was\r\n  rector here. But the most notable among the rectors is the most\r\n  recent, Prebendary Shuttleworth, whose death in 1900 left a gap\r\n  difficult to fill. Among the most notable of his social schemes was\r\n  the foundation of a social club for young men and women who work in\r\n  the City (see p. 219).\r\n\r\nOld Fish Street, partly wiped out by Knightrider Street, was a row of\r\nnarrow houses built along the middle of the street like the old houses\r\nat Holborn Bars, or like Butchers’ Row behind St. Clement Danes; or like\r\nHolywell Street, Strand. Stow says:\r\n\r\n“These houses, now possessed by fishmongers, were at the first but\r\nmoveable boards or stalls, set out on market-days to show their fish\r\nsold; but procuring license to set up sheds, they grew to shops, and by\r\nlittle and little to tall houses of three or four stories in height, and\r\nnow are called Fish Street.”\r\n\r\n  =St. Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street=, was situated on the north\r\n  side of Knightrider Street at the west corner of the Old Change. It\r\n  was destroyed by the Great Fire, and subsequently rebuilt and made\r\n  the parish church for this and the parish of St. Gregory; but it was\r\n  again burnt down in 1886, and has not been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n  In 1890 these two parishes were united to St. Martin, Ludgate. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1162.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s, as a vicarage, about 1162, but about 1319 it was a\r\n  rectory in the same patronage and has so continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 360.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained a considerable number of monuments,\r\n  but the individuals commemorated were of comparatively little note.\r\n  Among them was one, Barnard Randolph, common sergeant of the City of\r\n  London, and benefactor of the parish. He died in 1583.\r\n\r\n  Some of the charitable gifts recorded by Stow are: A messuage,\r\n  leased at £28 per annum, the gift of Thomas Berry; 40s. per annum,\r\n  the gift of Justice Randall; £3 : 18s. per annum, the gift of the\r\n  Company of Wax Chandlers.\r\n\r\n  In St. Gregory’s Parish, in the Ward of Castle Baynard, there was a\r\n  school purchased at the cost of Alderman Barber, where thirty boys\r\n  and twenty girls were educated. There was one almshouse upon Lambeth\r\n  Hill.\r\n\r\n  John Hewitt was rector here; he was tried by Cromwell’s High Court\r\n  of Justice in 1658 and beheaded. Also William Crowe (d. 1743),\r\n  Chaplain in Ordinary to George II.\r\n\r\n=Sermon Lane.=—According to Stow this was originally Sheremonier’s Lane.\r\nThe name is found as “Sarmoneres,” “Sarmoners,” “Sarmouneris,” and\r\n“Seremoneres” Lane. The most interesting mention of the Street is\r\ncontained in the Hist. MSS. Comm. Rept. IX., Part I. 26b. (A.D. 1315):\r\n\r\n“Whereas a house belonging to the Chapter of St. Paul’s, at the\r\nnorth-east corner of ‘Sarmouneris’ Lane, has been assigned to Sir\r\nNicholas Housebonde, minor canon of St. Paul’s, for his residence, the\r\nsaid Sir Nicholas has complained that it is inconvenient for the purpose\r\non account of the grievous perils which are to be feared by reason of\r\nits distance from the cathedral and the crossing of dangerous roads by\r\nnight, and the attacks of robbers, and other ill-disposed persons, which\r\nhe had already suffered, and also on account of the ruinous condition of\r\nthe building and the crowd of loose women who live around it. The\r\nChapter, therefore, assigns to him a piece of ground at the end of the\r\nschools upon which to make a house.”\r\n\r\nIn Sermon Lane is the charity school. It was built in the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Two quaint figures of charity children, each\r\nperhaps a couple of feet high, project from the first floor. The boy\r\ndressed in the long lapelled coat, the girl in panniers, apron, and cap.\r\nThe house is of brick. The two lower floors have ordinary wide arched\r\nwindows, but the two upper ones have each a unique display of no less\r\nthan nine narrow, circular headed windows in a row extending across all\r\nthe front. These give a curious cloistral aspect to the place. Over the\r\ndoorway and two ground-floor windows are scrolls fixed up, but on one\r\nonly is there an inscription, which is clearly readable, as follows:\r\n\r\n  To the Glory of God and for the benefit of the poor children of this\r\n  parish of Castle Baynard Ward this house was purchased at the sole\r\n  cost of John Barber, Esq., Alderman of this ward, in the year of our\r\n  Lord 1722.\r\n\r\nAnd on an immense plaster slab running all across the story above is\r\n“Castle Baynard Ward School, supported by voluntary contributions.”\r\n\r\n=St. Bennet’s Hill.=—Strype: “Upon Paul’s Wharf Hill, within a great\r\nGate, and belonging to that gate next to the Doctors’ Commons are many\r\nfair Tenements, which in their Leases made from the Dean and Chapter go\r\nby the name of _Camera Dianæ_, or Diana’s Chamber. So denominated from a\r\nspacious building that in the time of Henry II. stood where they now are\r\nstanding. In this Camera, an arched and vaulted structure, this Henry\r\nII. kept, or was supposed to have kept, that jewel of his heart, fair\r\nRosamund, whom there he called Rosa Mundi; and hereby the name of Diana.\r\nTo this day are remains and some evident testifications of turnings\r\ntedious and windings as also of a passage underground from this House to\r\nCastle Baynard, which was, no doubt, the king’s way from thence to his\r\n_Camera Dianæ_.”\r\n\r\nIn 1452 (Hist. Comm. IX.) the “Inn called _Camera Dianæ_,” _alias_\r\nSegrave, in the parish of St. Benet is assigned by the Dean and Chapter\r\nof St. Paul’s to a Canon Residentiary of the Cathedral. And in 1480 we\r\nfind the _Camera_ described as a messuage with a garden let at eight\r\nmarks a year to Sir John Clay; it was formerly occupied by Lord Berners,\r\n“but probably belonging to Richard Lichefield, Canon Residentiary, who\r\npays to the Chapter 26s. a year for the obit of Richard Juvenis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. BENET, PAUL’S WHARF\r\n\r\n  St. Benet, Paul’s Wharf, is sometimes called St. Bennet Huda, or At\r\n  the Hyth, and sometimes St. Benet Woodwharf. The date of the\r\n  foundation of the original church is unknown. It was destroyed by\r\n  the Great Fire, and the present building, the work of Wren, was\r\n  finished in 1683. The neighbouring church of St. Peter was not\r\n  rebuilt and after the Fire the parishes were united. This rectory\r\n  has ceased to be parochial, its parish having been united with that\r\n  of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey. In 1879 the church was handed over to\r\n  the Welsh congregation by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners ratified\r\n  by an Order in Council. The patron is the Bishop of London. It is\r\n  now used for services for Welsh residents in London. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1150.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church had always been in the hands of the Dean\r\n  and Chapter of St. Paul’s since 1150 up to 1879.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 336.\r\n\r\n  The present church is built of red brick, with stone quoins and\r\n  festoons over the windows. It is 54 feet long, 50 feet broad, and 36\r\n  feet high. There is one aisle, on the north side, separated from the\r\n  nave by two Corinthian columns on lofty bases. The steeple, rising\r\n  at the north-west, reaches a height of 115 feet and consists of a\r\n  square-based tower, with a cornice, a cupola with oval openings, and\r\n  a lantern supporting a ball and vane.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here at the Altar of Our Lady for Sir William\r\n  de Weyland, to which John Love de Canterbury was admitted, April 10,\r\n  1334.\r\n\r\n  This church formerly contained monuments to: Sir William Cheyne,\r\n  Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who died in 1442; Dr. Richard\r\n  Caldwell, President of the Royal College of Physicians, who died in\r\n  1585; Inigo Jones was buried here in 1652, but his memorial perished\r\n  in the Great Fire; there is a marble tablet to his memory on the\r\n  north-side wall. Many heralds and dignities of the Ecclesiastical\r\n  Courts were buried in this church owing to its contiguity to the\r\n  College of Arms and Doctors’ Commons, among whom are John Charles\r\n  Brooke, William Oldys, author of the _Life of Raleigh_, who died in\r\n  1761, also Mrs. Manley, author of the _New Atlantis_, who died in\r\n  1724. Elias Ashmole, the antiquary, was married here.\r\n\r\n  There was a charity school here for twenty poor boys; also\r\n  almshouses, consisting of six tenements for six poor widows. Each\r\n  widow received 7s. 4d. per quarter from Christ’s Hospital, 9s. 6d.\r\n  at Christmas from the Embroiderers, and 25s. each at Christmas from\r\n  the churchwardens. In the event of marriage, the benefit of this\r\n  foundation was forfeited.\r\n\r\nAs this brings us down to Thames Street again, we must retrace our steps\r\nand come right along the river-side from the westward limit of our\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo. York & Son._\r\n\r\n  QUEEN VICTORIA STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\nPuddle Dock was called Waingate in Stow’s time; it was possibly an\r\nartificial port constructed like Queenhithe, in the mud of the\r\nforeshore. Beside the dock, in the sixteenth century, was a brewery, the\r\nfirst of the many river-side breweries.\r\n\r\nBaynard’s Castle has already been mentioned. There was no house in the\r\nCity more interesting than this. Its history extends from the Norman\r\nConquest to the Great Fire—exactly 600 years; and during the whole of\r\nthis long period it was a great palace. First it was built by one\r\nBaynard, a follower of William. It was forfeited in A.D. 1111, and given\r\nto Robert Fitzwalter, son of Richard, Earl of Clare, in whose family the\r\noffice of Castellan and Standard-bearer to the City of London became\r\nhereditary. His descendant, Robert, in revenge for private injuries,\r\ntook part with the barons against King John, for which the King ordered\r\nBaynard’s Castle to be destroyed. Fitzwalter, however, becoming\r\nreconciled to the King, was permitted to rebuild his house. It was again\r\ndestroyed, this time by fire, in 1428. It was rebuilt by Humphrey, Duke\r\nof Gloucester, on whose attainder it reverted to the Crown. During one\r\nof these rebuildings it was somewhat shifted in position. Richard, Duke\r\nof York, next had it, and lived here with his following of 400 gentlemen\r\nand men-at-arms. It was in the hall of Baynard’s Castle that Edward IV.\r\nassumed the title of king, and summoned the bishops, peers, and judges\r\nto meet him in council. Edward gave the house to his mother, and placed\r\nin it for safety his wife and children before going out to fight the\r\nBattle of Barnet. Here Buckingham offered the crown to Richard.\r\n\r\n              Alas! why would you heap those cares on me?\r\n              I am unfit for state and majesty;\r\n              I do beseech you, take it not amiss\r\n              I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. lived in this palace, which he almost entirely rebuilt.\r\nPrince Henry, after his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, was conducted\r\nin great state up the river, from Baynard’s Castle to Westminster, the\r\nmayor and commonalty of the City following in their barges. In the time\r\nof Edward VI. the Earl of Pembroke, whose wife was sister to Queen\r\nCatherine Parr, held great state in this house. Here he proclaimed Queen\r\nMary. When Mary’s first Parliament was held, he proceeded to Baynard’s\r\nCastle, followed by “2000 horsemen in velvet coats, with their laces of\r\ngold and gold chains, besides sixty gentlemen in blue coats with his\r\nbadge of the green dragon.” This powerful noble lived to entertain Queen\r\nElizabeth at Baynard’s Castle with a banquet, followed by fireworks. The\r\nlast appearance of the place in history is when Charles II. took supper\r\nthere just before the Fire swept over it and destroyed it.\r\n\r\nBaynard’s Castle is mentioned repeatedly in ancient documents. During a\r\nlawsuit heard before the Justices Itinerant at the Tower of London (14\r\nEdward II.) a charter of Henry I. was produced granting permission to\r\nthe Bishop of London to make a wall over part of the ditch of Baynard’s\r\nCastle, and referring back to the possession of the castle by Eustace,\r\nEarl of Boulogne, in 1106. In 1307 there were mills “without” Castle\r\nBaynard, which were removed as a nuisance. The Brethren of the Papey had\r\na tenement adjoining Baynard’s Castle.\r\n\r\nIn 1276 Gregory Rokesley, mayor, gave the Archbishop of Canterbury two\r\nlanes or ways next the street of Baynard’s Castle. In 1423 a great fire\r\ndestroyed a part of the castle. In 1501 Henry VII. rebuilt the place or\r\nrestored it. In 1463 Cicely, Duchess of York, wrote from “our place at\r\nBaynard’s Castle.” In 1551 the castle was in the hands of Lord Pembroke,\r\nwhose wife, Anne Parr, sister of Queen Catherine Parr, died there,\r\nFebruary 28, 1552, and was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe house, as it stood a little before the Fire, was a striking and\r\npicturesque palace. The river-front was broken by three towers of\r\nunequal height and breadth; the spaces between these were ornamented by\r\ntourelles containing the windows; a gateway with a portcullis opened\r\nupon the river with a broad stone “bridge” or pier, and stairs. Within,\r\nit contained two courts.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire the site of Baynard’s Castle lay for a long time\r\nneglected. Ogilby’s map shows an area not built upon, approached by a\r\nlane from Thames Street, called Dunghill Lane. At the river-edge is a\r\nsmall circle denoting a tower. Strype says that it was all burned down\r\nexcept a little tower. Strype also says that the site was converted into\r\n“Buildings and Wharves,” but his map shows neither.\r\n\r\nNear Baynard’s Castle, but not marked on the maps, was a place called\r\nButchers’ Bridge, where the offal and blood of the beasts killed in the\r\nshambles, Newgate, were thrown into the river. It was ordered (43 Edward\r\nIII.) that the bridge, a pier or jetty such as at New Palace Yard was\r\ncalled Westminster Bridge, should be taken away, and the offal should be\r\ncarried out of the City.\r\n\r\nStow speaks of another tower on the west side of Baynard’s Castle, built\r\nby Edward II. “The same place,” he says, “was since called Legate’s Inn,\r\nwhere be now divers wood wharves.”\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the castle stood “a great messuage” belonging to the\r\nAbbey of Fécamp. During the wars Edward III. took it, and gave it to Sir\r\nSimon Burley, from whom it was called Burley House.\r\n\r\nNext came another great house, called Scrope’s Inn, “belonging to Scrope\r\nin the 31st of Henry VI.”\r\n\r\nPaul’s Wharf, a “common stair,” was very ancient, and may very well mark\r\nthe site of an early break in the wall. In 1354 Gilbert de Bruen, Dean\r\nof St. Paul’s, bequeaths his “tenements and wharf, commonly called\r\n‘Paule’s Wharf,’ to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s and their\r\nsuccessors, so that they maintain a chantry in the Chapel of St.\r\nKatherine” (in the cathedral) “for the good of his soul and the souls of\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nIn 1344 there was a dispute concerning the right of free access to the\r\nriver by Paul’s Wharf. The matter was referred to certain wardsmen.\r\n“They say that Paul’s Wharf used to be common to the whole city for\r\ntaking water there, but they say that Nicolas de Tailleur, ‘heymonger,’\r\ntenant by rent service of Dominus William de Hagham, collects the\r\nquarterly payments of those who take water there against the custom of\r\nthe city.”\r\n\r\nPaul’s Wharf was also called the Wharf of the Dean and Chapter of St.\r\nPaul’s.\r\n\r\nBeyond Paul’s Wharf was a great house, formerly—_i.e._ in the fourteenth\r\ncentury—called Beaumont’s Inn, but given by Edward IV. to Lord Hastings.\r\nIn 1598 it was called Huntingdon House, as belonging to the Earls of\r\nHuntingdon.\r\n\r\n  =St. Peter, Paul’s Wharf=, stood at the south-east corner of St.\r\n  Peter’s Hill in Upper Thames Street. It was sometimes called St.\r\n  Peter’s Parva. It was destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt,\r\n  its parish being annexed to that of St. Benet, Paul’s Wharf. Its\r\n  burying-ground may still be seen amidst the surrounding warehouses.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1315.\r\n\r\n  The church has always been in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul, since 1181, and continued in their successors up to\r\n  1666, when the church was burnt down and the parish annexed to that\r\n  of St. Benet, Paul’s Wharf.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: William Bernard for himself and\r\n  Isabel his wife, to which James Payne was admitted January 22,\r\n  1542-43; Walter Kent.\r\n\r\n  No monuments remained in Stow’s time except that in memory of Queen\r\n  Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nFish Wharf was near Queenhithe. In 1343 Thomas Pykeman, fishmonger,\r\nbequeathed to his wife the messuage wherein he lived, situate upon “la\r\nFisshewharfs,” with shops, for life. In 1347 Simon de Turnham,\r\nfishmonger, ordered the sale of “his shops and solars” at “le\r\nFisshewharfs in the parish of St. Mary Somerset.” In 1374 the Fishwharfs\r\nis said to be in the parish of St. Magnus. Now, there are four parishes\r\nbetween St. Mary Somerset and St. Magnus. The latter “Fish Wharf” is\r\nprobably “Fresh” Wharf in St. Magnus’s parish. In 1291 Thomas Pikeman\r\n(father of the above named [?]), Henry Poteman, and John Aleyn,\r\nfishmongers of Fishers’ Wharf, pray that they may be allowed to go on\r\nselling fish, fresh or salted, in their houses on the above wharf by\r\nwholesale or retail, as their ancestors have been accustomed to do. The\r\nFish Wharf of St. Magnus was also called the Fish Wharf at the Hole.\r\n\r\n  =St. Mary Mounthaw= was situated on the west side, about the middle\r\n  of Old Fish Street Hill, and derived its name “Mounthaw” or\r\n  “Mounthault” from its having belonged to the family of Mounthaul or\r\n  Monhalt who owned a house in the parish. It was destroyed by the\r\n  Great Fire and its parish annexed to that of St. Mary Somerset, its\r\n  site being made into a burying-ground for the inhabitants. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1344.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The family of\r\n  Mounthault, who sold it to Ralph de Maydenstone, about 1234, who\r\n  gave it to his successors the Bishop of Hereford, in whose\r\n  successors it continued till 1666, when the church was burnt down\r\n  and the parish annexed to St. Mary Somerset, who shared the\r\n  alternate patronage of that church up to 1776.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by John Gloucester, late citizen, before\r\n  1345, to which John Whutewey was admitted, February 18, 1381.\r\n\r\n  Two monuments only are mentioned by Stow, one in memory of John\r\n  Gloucester, alderman in 1345, and John Skip, Bishop of Hereford,\r\n  1552.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-four boys and twenty girls were taught and clothed by the\r\n  gentlemen of Queenhithe Ward.\r\n\r\n  The parish, together with others, had a gift of 8s. per annum left\r\n  by Randolph Bernard, and 40s. per annum left by Robert Warner.\r\n\r\nBoss Alley, now vanished, preserved the memory of a “boss” of water\r\nplaced there by the executors of Whittington. Beside Boss Alley was a\r\nhouse once belonging to the Abbots of Chertsey in Surrey, as their inn\r\nwhen they came to town. It was afterwards known as Sandie House. “I\r\nthink the Lord Sands has been lodged there.”\r\n\r\nTrig Lane follows, leading down to Trig Stairs:\r\n\r\n              A pair of stairs they found, not big stairs,\r\n              Just such another pair as Trig Stairs.\r\n\r\nBroken Wharf is mentioned so far back—_e.g._ 1329 and 1349—that one\r\nsuspects that the wall, not the wharf, was at this place broken. In 1598\r\na stone house stood beside the wharf, with arched gates. It belonged in\r\nthe forty-third year of Henry III. to Hugh de Bygod; in the eleventh of\r\nEdward III. to Thomas Brotherton, the King’s brother, Earl of Norfolk,\r\nMarshal of England; and in the eleventh of Henry VI. to John Mowbray,\r\nDuke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n  Within the gate of this house (now belonging to the city of London)\r\n  is lately—to wit, in the years 1594 and 1595—built one large house\r\n  of great heith called an engine, made by Bevis Bulmar, gentleman,\r\n  for the conveying and forcing of Thames water to serve in the middle\r\n  and west parts of the city. The ancient great hall of this messuage\r\n  is yet standing, and pertaining to a great brewhouse for beer\r\n  (Stow’s _Survey_).\r\n\r\n  =St. Mary Somerset= was situated on the north side of Upper Thames\r\n  Street, opposite Broken Wharf, and was so-called from a man’s name\r\n  Summer’s Hith. It was burnt down in the Great Fire, and rebuilt from\r\n  the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in 1695, when St. Mary Mounthaw\r\n  was annexed to it. The building, with the exception of the tower,\r\n  was pulled down in 1868. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1280.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: William de\r\n  Staundon, who gave it by will, dated November 20, 1273, to Arabella\r\n  de Staundon, his wife; Sir John de Peyton, 1335; Edward III., 1363\r\n  (see Braybroke, _London Review_, 146, as to a dispute about the\r\n  patronage when Thomas de Bradeston claimed it); Richard II., as\r\n  custodian of Thomas de Bradeston, 1387; Walter de la Pole, in right\r\n  of his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas de Bradeston; Thomas de\r\n  Ingaldesthorp, cousin and heir of Walter de la Pole; Henry VI.,\r\n  1435; William Norris, Knight, married to Isabel, daughter of Edmund\r\n  de Ingaldesthorp, 1478; Edward VI., 1550; Mary, 1554; G. Comb,\r\n  generosus, 1560; Elizabeth, 1585; George Coton, 1596; and several\r\n  others until the Great Fire in 1666, when the parish was annexed to\r\n  St. Mary Mounthaw.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By and for John Gildesburgh, in the\r\n  time of Edward III., at the Altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the\r\n  King granted in mortmain to Richard, son of W. de Segrave, May\r\n  18—the endowment fetched £4 : 6 : 8 in 1548, when John Bordell was\r\n  priest; by Thomas Wilforde, who had a licence from Henry IV., whose\r\n  endowment fetched £3 : 7 : 4 in 1548, when John Moryalle was priest.\r\n\r\n  Most of the monuments of the original church were defaced by Stow’s\r\n  time, and those which he records are of individuals of little\r\n  eminence. In later times the memory of Gilbert Ironside, Bishop of\r\n  Hereford, was honoured by a stone inscription within the communion\r\n  rails.\r\n\r\n  Ralph Bernard left 8s. per annum, and John Moysier 7s. 6d. per\r\n  annum. No other gifts or charities are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-four boys and twenty girls were clothed and educated at the\r\n  charge of the gentlemen of Queenhithe Ward.\r\n\r\n  Samuel Croxall, D.D. (d. 1752), Chancellor of Hereford, was rector\r\n  here.\r\n\r\nTimber Hithe crossed the narrow lanes parallel to Thames Street. It is\r\nnow called High Timber Street. These lanes have changed their names;\r\n“Dunghill Lane,” for instance, became Gardeners’ Lane. There used to be\r\nhere a quaint little figure of a gardener, dated 1670, of the kind to be\r\nfound at one time in many parts of London, but now very scarce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A BAS-RELIEF OF A GARDENER, GARDENERS’ LANE, 1791\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fye Foot Lane is the Shuttleworth Club, founded in 1889 by Prebendary\r\nShuttleworth. It was intended to provide “a comfortable place of social\r\nintercourse, culture and recreation,” for men and women in business in\r\nthe City. The affairs of the Club are managed by the members themselves,\r\nand no religious test of any kind is required. The Club at first went by\r\nthe name of St. Nicholas, but it was rechristened the Shuttleworth Club\r\nin honour of the founder. Every form of recreation is provided—from\r\ncricket in the summer months, and dancing, to lectures and chess. In the\r\nbasement there is a fine billiard room with two tables. On the ground\r\nfloor there is a refreshment bar, where alcoholic as well as\r\nnon-alcoholic beverages are provided, and also dining-rooms, which look\r\nout at the back of the house on the dreary little strip of ground—all\r\nthat remains of St. Mary Somerset Churchyard. The experiment is\r\ninteresting, as this is the first mixed Club established in the City.\r\n\r\nOf =Bread Street Hill= there seems to be no recorded history; here on\r\nthe west side once stood\r\n\r\n  =St. Nicholas Olave=, destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt,\r\n  its parish being annexed to that of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1327.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Bishop of\r\n  London, by whom it was given in 1172 to the Dean and Chapter of St.\r\n  Paul’s, with whom it continued up to 1666, when the parish was\r\n  annexed to St. Nicholas Cole Abbey.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 163.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Lewen, sheriff in 1537, who died 1555, was buried here; also\r\n  Blitheman, organist of the Queen’s Chapel, who died 1591; John\r\n  Widnell, Master of the Merchant Taylors Company.\r\n\r\n  Stow says that the parish received no gifts for any purposes.\r\n\r\n  Hugh Weston (d. 1558), Dean of Westminster, was a rector here. The\r\n  churchyard still remains.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all the many points of interest in Thames Street, that open\r\ndock or harbour called Queenhithe is the most interesting. It\r\noriginally, as we have seen, belonged to one Edred, a Saxon, but fell\r\ninto the hands of King Stephen, as valuable property had a way of\r\nfalling into kings’ hands in those early days. After being held by an\r\nintermediate possessor, William de Ypres, who gave it to a convent, it\r\ncame again to the Crown, and was given by King John to his mother, the\r\nDowager Queen Eleanor. It was a valuable property by reason of the dues\r\ncollected from the ships unlading here. King Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n  commanded the constables of the Tower of London to arrest the ships\r\n  of the Cinque Ports on the River of Thames, and to compel them to\r\n  bring their corn to no other place, but to the Queen’s Hithe only.\r\n  In the eleventh of his reign he charged the said constable to\r\n  distrain all fish offered to be sold in any place of this city, but\r\n  at the Queen Hithe (Stow).\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this order the larger ships, as well as the smaller\r\nones, were compelled to come up beyond London Bridge, and were admitted\r\nby a drawbridge. In 1463 the “slackness” of the drawbridge impeded their\r\nprogress, and Queenhithe suffered accordingly. At Queenhithe were\r\ndelivered goods varying in quantity and quality, but the two great\r\ntrades were in fish: for the fish-market, the principal one—Billingsgate\r\nnot being then a free and open port—was at Old Fish Market; and grain,\r\nin memory whereof we may still see the vane on the top of St. Michael’s\r\nChurch in the form of a ship made to contain exactly a bushel of corn.\r\nIt was in Henry III.’s reign that the “farm” of Queenhithe was granted\r\nto the Lord Mayor and Commonalty of the City to be held by them, but the\r\nprofits were soon “sore diminished,” partly by reason of the competition\r\nof Billingsgate.\r\n\r\n  =St. Michael, Queenhithe=, was situated on the north side of Upper\r\n  Thames Street, and was sometimes called St. Michael, Cornhith. It\r\n  was burnt down in the Great Fire, and rebuilt from the designs of\r\n  Wren in 1677, when the parish of Trinity Church was annexed. In 1876\r\n  the building was pulled down. Several portions of the building and\r\n  fittings were preserved; the font has been removed to St. Paul’s, as\r\n  well as a number of the monuments, and the old oak pulpit to St.\r\n  James’, Garlickhithe. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1150.\r\n\r\n  The church has always been in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 100.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Richard Marlowe, ironmonger and\r\n  mayor of London, 1409 and 1417; by Stephen Spelman, who died in 1414\r\n  and endowed it with lands, which fetched £11 : 16 : 8 in 1548, when\r\n  Thomas Gilbank was priest; by Robert Parres, Thomas Eure, and John\r\n  Clarke, who endowed it with tenements, etc., which fetched £7 : 13 :\r\n  4, when Sir Thomas Bigge was priest.\r\n\r\n  Few monuments are recorded by Stow, as many had been quite defaced\r\n  by his time. He mentions Stephen Spelman as a benefactor to the\r\n  church in 1404; and here was buried also Richard Marlow, mayor in\r\n  1409, who gave £20 to the poor of the parish, and Richard Gray,\r\n  donor of £40.\r\n\r\n  The gifts and benevolences belonging to the parish were registered\r\n  in the parish book, but the details of them are not recorded by\r\n  Stow.\r\n\r\n  There was a school for forty-three boys and girls.\r\n\r\n  John Russell (1787-1863), D.D., headmaster of Charterhouse, was\r\n  rector here.\r\n\r\n=Huggin Lane= was known as Hoggene Lane in 1329, 1373, 1429, 1430, 1431,\r\n1433 (see _Calendar of Wills_). In its south-east corner stood the\r\nChurch of St. Michael, Queenhithe. The churchyard still remains.\r\n\r\nIn =Little Trinity Lane= is the Painter Stainers’ Hall, opposite to\r\nwhich was the Lutheran Church. In Great Trinity Lane was the Church of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, not rebuilt after the Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE PAINTERS OR PAINTER STAINERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  This Company was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, 1582, for a\r\n  master, 2 wardens, 19 assistants, and a livery of 124. The present\r\n  livery is 130; their Corporate Income is £700; their Trust Income is\r\n  £2300. Their hall is in Little Trinity Lane. The history of the\r\n  Company has been written by Mr. John Gregory Grace, late master. It\r\n  was an ancient Gild, but how ancient cannot be learned. In the\r\n  fifteenth century the Painters sent unto the mayor and aldermen the\r\n  usual petition that they might be allowed to choose two persons of\r\n  their Mystery who should be authorised to make search for bad and\r\n  “false” work. This Company originally included painters of portraits\r\n  and other kinds, as well as decorators, sign painters, etc. It\r\n  might, in fact, have become the City Academy of Arts, and it seems a\r\n  great pity that its nobler side was lost sight of. The hall,\r\n  formerly the residence of Sir John Brown, Sergeant Painter to Henry\r\n  VIII., was destroyed by the Great Fire and rebuilt immediately\r\n  afterwards. The Company can show many distinguished names on the\r\n  roll of members, including those of Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey\r\n  Kneller, Antonio Verrio, Sir James Thornhill, and Richard Lovelace.\r\n\r\n  =Holy Trinity the Less= was situated in Knightrider Street. In 1607\r\n  and 1629 it was rebuilt and repaired, but it was destroyed in the\r\n  Great Fire of 1666, and its parish annexed to that of St. Michael,\r\n  Queenhithe. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1323.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, before 1316; Henry VIII.\r\n  seized it, when it soon came, either by exchange or grant, to the\r\n  Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, with whose successors it continued\r\n  till 1666, when the church was destroyed and the parish annexed to\r\n  St. Michael, Queenhithe.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 170.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Thomas Cosyn; John Bryan.\r\n\r\n  John Bryan was buried in this church—he was an alderman in the reign\r\n  of Henry V. and a great benefactor; also John Mirsin, auditor of the\r\n  Exchequer in 1471.\r\n\r\n  No legacies or gifts are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  There was a school for forty-three boys and girls belonging to St.\r\n  Michael, Queenhithe.\r\n\r\n  John Rogers, who was burnt as a heretic at Smithfield in 1555, was a\r\n  rector here; also Francis Dee (d. 1638), Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\n=Great Trinity Lane=, together with Great St. Thomas Apostle and the\r\nwest half of Cloak Lane, formerly counted as part of Knightrider Street,\r\nwhich joins the western end of Great Trinity Lane.\r\n\r\nIt was changed to the present style after the Fire. In 1888 the\r\nunderground “Mansion House” station ousted all the houses on the south\r\nside of the lane; but Jack’s Alley was a right-of-way into Keen’s\r\nmustard factory—its loss had to be made good, and hence the iron bridge\r\nwhich crosses the station from the lane to the factory: really it is an\r\nalley suspended in mid-air.\r\n\r\nGreat St. Thomas Apostle was an important street in old days. It was\r\nso-called from the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle.\r\n\r\n  At St. Paul’s Cathedral is a document of 1170 relating to =St.\r\n  Thomas-the-Apostle=; that is the earliest reference. In 1181 the\r\n  book of Dean Ralph de Diceto describes it as “Ecclesia Sancti\r\n  Thomae,” a church with burial-ground belonging. The Cathedral canons\r\n  collated to it, and one Stephen was then priest. The name at that\r\n  time is simply written “St. Thomas”; it was the only church of the\r\n  name in the City. A few years later the church dedicated to St.\r\n  Thomas à Becket was founded in Cheapside and styled St. Thomas of\r\n  Acres: after that, necessity of distinction caused the earlier\r\n  church to be known as “St. Thomas-ye-Apostle.” Of the building,\r\n  scant information exists. Roesia de Burford erected upon the south\r\n  side a new chapel shortly before 1329.[4] At about the same time a\r\n  partial or complete rebuilding of the church took place: John\r\n  Bernes, mercer, Lord Mayor 1371, was a substantial contributor to\r\n  the new work, and a coat-of-arms existing in the stone work and the\r\n  windows until Stow’s time (1598) was believed to attest his\r\n  munificence. A Fraternity of St. Eligius, or Eloy, Bishop of Noyon,\r\n  had quarters here, and there was an altar to their saint. In the\r\n  years 1629-1630 the building was “well repaired and finely\r\n  varnished” at a cost of nearly £300. Then in 1666 came the trial by\r\n  fire, and the church succumbed. The parish was united to St. Mary\r\n  Aldermary, and the Dean and Chapter, as patrons of St. Thomas, were\r\n  allotted alternate presentation to the united living. The sites of\r\n  the church and rectory were thrown into Queen Street, cut from\r\n  Cheapside to Thames Street soon after the Fire. Some small portion\r\n  of the churchyard remained, east and west of the new thoroughfare.\r\n  Part of the western space was shortly built upon; the very houses\r\n  still stand, with the tree-planted churchyard as a garden entrance:\r\n  beneath the garden are the vaults, once used as a last resting-place\r\n  for deceased parishioners, now as a wine store. The western space\r\n  still contained some remains of the church until plastered over in\r\n  1828. The ground was curtailed by the widening of Queen Street and\r\n  the allotment of a rectory site for St. Mary Aldermary in 1851. Thus\r\n  it has been reduced to a tiny and flagged square. On the north wall\r\n  a tablet bears this inscription: “Near this spot stood the church of\r\n  St. Thomas the Apostle, destroyed in the Great Fire of London,\r\n  September 1666: the burial ground belonging to which, extending 55\r\n  feet northward of Cloak Lane, and 20 feet on an average eastward of\r\n  Queen Street, was circumscribed to the space here enclosed a.d.\r\n  1851, when by virtue of an Act of Parliament 10 and 11 Vict. cap.\r\n  CCLXXX, the remnant of the ground was taken to widen Queen Street\r\n  and Cloak Lane. All remains of mortality which could be discovered\r\n  were carefully collected and deposited within the vault beneath this\r\n  stone. H. B. Wilson DD, rector: Matthew T. Bishop: John Pollock:\r\n  churchwardens.” The earliest date of an incumbent is 1365.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church has always been in the hands of the Dean\r\n  and Chapter of St. Paul’s, and was given to them in the twelfth\r\n  century by Wicelonis the priest and Gervasius his nephew.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 298.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Thomas Romayn, whose will was dated\r\n  December 21, 1312, for himself and Juliana his wife, to which John\r\n  Wariner, priest, was admitted chaplain, April 20, 1368; by Roger\r\n  atte Wine, whose endowment fetched £2 : 13 : 4 in 1548; by William\r\n  Champneys, to which Walter Badewynde de Canterbury dio was admitted\r\n  chaplain, June 12, 1368—the endowment fetched £5 : 6 : 7 in 1548\r\n  (the above three were consolidated and united in January 9,\r\n  1400-1401, when Thomas Jordan was admitted chaplain); by Richard\r\n  Chawry, who gave to the Salters Company certain lands, etc., to find\r\n  a priest, which were valued at £6 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Sir George\r\n  Walpole was chaplain; by William Brampton, who endowed it with\r\n  lands, etc., which fetched £6 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Sir John Barnes\r\n  was chaplain.\r\n\r\n  Very few monuments of special interest are recorded by Stow. John\r\n  Foy, citizen and Merchant Taylor, was buried here in 1625; he was a\r\n  benefactor of the parish.\r\n\r\n  The charitable gifts belonging to this parish were few and small:\r\n  £13 : 0 : 4 the gift of Mr. Hinman; £2 : 12s. the gift of Mr.\r\n  Beeston; and others to the amount of £5.\r\n\r\n  Two almshouses for the poor of the Salters Company belonging to St.\r\n  Mary Aldermary.\r\n\r\n  John Walker (d. 1741), Archdeacon of Hereford, was rector here; also\r\n  Thomas Cartwright (1634-1689), Bishop of Chester.\r\n\r\nJust beyond its eastern end, across the present College Hill, stood the\r\n=Tower Royal=. The wine merchants of La Reole, near Bordeaux, settled in\r\nand round the present College Hill during or before the reign of Edward\r\nI. The hill and the immediate neighbourhood became termed “the Reole”:\r\nthe word “Royal” is a corrupted form, and has nothing to do with kings.\r\nThe tower, tenement, or inn situated in “the Reole” stood on the north\r\nof Cloak Lane, at College Hill corner; it extended eastwards nearly to\r\nthe Walbrook, northwards perhaps to Budge Row. It had a south gate, and\r\nprobably also a courtyard opening into the lane; and a west gate\r\nstanding on the hill. Perhaps Henry I. was the founder: Stow wishes us\r\nto believe that Stephen lodged here, “as in the heart of the City for\r\nhis more safety,” which is very likely true.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the tower, or main building, was reserved to the King\r\nfinds support in 1331, when Edward III. granted “La Real” to Queen\r\nPhillippa for life, to serve as her wardrobe. A few years later\r\nPhillippa repaired, perhaps rebuilt, it; particulars of the work done\r\nstill survive (Cottonian MS.). In 1369, a few months after Phillippa’s\r\ndeath, the King gave this “inn (hospitum) with its appurtenances, called\r\nle Reole” to the canons of his college of St. Stephen’s, Westminster,\r\nthe annual value being then £20. By some means the place still continued\r\nat the royal disposal, both to dwell in and to grant away. When the Wat\r\nTyler rebellion in 1381 drove Johanna, the King’s mother, from the Tower\r\nof London, she took refuge here, the place being then called the Queen’s\r\nWardrobe: thither came Richard II. when he returned from Smithfield,\r\nafter the death of Tyler. Richard was still here in 1386, “lying in the\r\nRoyal,” as Stow has it, when he granted a charter of £1000 per annum to\r\nthe refugee Leon VI., King of Armenia. The place was granted by Richard\r\nIII. to John Howard, Duke of Norfolk. In later times the Tower became\r\nneglected, and converted into stabling for the King’s horses. When Stow\r\nwrote (1598), it was divided into tenements let out to divers persons.\r\nAll perished in the Great Fire; but at the rebuilding the south entrance\r\nand courtyard in Cloak Lane were plainly marked by Balding’s Yard; the\r\nwest gateway by Tower Royal Court in what was then Tower Royal Street,\r\nbut is now the upper end of College Hill. Neither survived; but a small\r\nlane called Tower Royal, in Cordwainer Ward, marks the western boundary.\r\n\r\nWest of the Church of St. Thomas Apostle, reaching to Bow Lane, was the\r\ngreat house called =Ypres Inn=, first built by William of Ypres, who\r\ncame over from Flanders with other Flemings to aid Stephen against\r\nMatilda.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1377 John of Ypres lived there: on a certain day came John\r\nof Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and Lord Henry Percy the marshal to dine\r\nwith him. Both the Duke and Percy had been defending Wyclyf before the\r\nBishop of London: the citizens, enraged, sought the life of both, going\r\nin pursuit of them to the Savoy. A knight of the Duke’s hastened to\r\nYpres Inn with the news: the frightened Duke “leapt so hastily from his\r\noysters that he hurt both his legs against a form,” refused the\r\nconsolation of wine, left the Inn with Percy by a back gate, and taking\r\na boat at the Thames “never stayed rowing” until he came to Kennington,\r\nwhere he was safe. Thus the hunters missed the fox at his hole, whilst\r\nthe fox, lying in hiding at the hunter’s back door, conveyed himself to\r\na place of security. What eventually happened to the Inn is not\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n=Garlick Hill=, or Garlick Hithe, where, one supposes, garlick was\r\nformerly sold, has at present in it nothing remarkable except the Church\r\nof St. James. “Garleckhithe” occurs in a record of 1281. Of old time,\r\nStow relates, garlic was sold upon the Thames bank near this hill: as a\r\nstrong flavouring it was much in vogue for the dressing of food among\r\nthe common folk: and an ordinance of 1310 relating to Queenhithe, close\r\nby, makes reference to ships with cargoes of garlic and onions. Here, no\r\ndoubt, the garlic market was held, hence this particular hithe, hive,\r\nharbour, or quay was the Garlickhithe, and the church on the hill just\r\nabove was called St. James-at-Garlickhithe. At the north-east corner of\r\nthe hill stood Ormond Place, a great stone house, sometimes the\r\nresidence of the Earls of Ormond. It had just been demolished when Stow\r\nwrote his _Survey_, and tenements and a tavern built on the site. The\r\nhill was “well built and inhabited” after the Great Fire, says Strype.\r\nSir John Coke was living here in 1625.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. JAMES, GARLICKHITHE\r\n\r\n  “St. James _versus vinitariam_” occurs in a document of about\r\n  1170;[5] “St. James in Garleckhithe” is found written in 1281:[6]\r\n  both names were at that time used without distinction, but the\r\n  former was eventually dropped. “Vinitarium” or Vintry applied to the\r\n  general district of the wine trade situated hereabouts;\r\n  “Garleckhithe,” to the harbour, just below the church, where the\r\n  garlic-monger made sale of his wares. St. James is the saint here\r\n  honoured.\r\n\r\n  The earliest church is well-nigh recordless: it was in part rebuilt\r\n  and chiefly restored by Richard de Rothing, probably the same who\r\n  was sheriff in 1326; here, within the walls of his munificence, was\r\n  he buried. He did not complete the restorations. John de Rothing,\r\n  Richard’s son, left by will in 1375 money towards completing the\r\n  repairs, towards the rebuilding of the old belfry, and for\r\n  re-erecting a doorway in the north side.\r\n\r\n  It was burnt down in the Great Fire, and rebuilt from designs by\r\n  Wren, 1676-1683. During the last century the church was several\r\n  times repaired, but not substantially altered. The earliest date of\r\n  an incumbent is 1259.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot and\r\n  Convent of Westminster, 1252; Henry VIII. seized it in 1540 and\r\n  granted it to Thomas Thirlby, Bishop of Westminster, the same year,\r\n  viz. January 20, 1540-1541; the Bishop of London, by grant of Edward\r\n  VI. in 1550, confirmed by Mary, March 3, 1553-1554.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 400.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 75 feet in length, 45 feet in breadth, and 40\r\n  feet in height. There are two side-aisles separated from the nave by\r\n  Ionic columns, six on either side, with a clerestory above. This is\r\n  interrupted at the centre, and three eastern and three western\r\n  columns each bear half of it, thus presenting a cruciform\r\n  appearance. The tower, measuring 20 feet square at the base, rises\r\n  at the west, surmounted by a dome, lantern, ball finial, and vane;\r\n  the total height is 125 feet. The transitions are softened by vases\r\n  and urns. Above the door projects a bracket clock topped by the\r\n  grotesque figure of St. James in pilgrim’s garb, locally known as\r\n  “old Jimmy Garlick.” Much of the woodwork in the interior was\r\n  brought from St. Michael, Queenhithe, when that church was pulled\r\n  down.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By John Whitthorn, of three\r\n  chaplains—one Thomas Haverbergh, chaplain, exchanges it with William\r\n  Gedelston, rector of Ongar ad Castrum, Essex, July 31, 1381; by\r\n  William Hawye, at the Altar of St Katharine, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £12 : 18 : 8 in 1548, when Thomas Dale was priest; by John de\r\n  Oxenford, citizen and vintner, which was augmented by Roger de\r\n  Fordham, whose will is dated next after the Feast of St. Barnabas,\r\n  1349; by Thomas Lincoln and Richard Lyon in 1548, when John Borell\r\n  was chaplain; by Thomas Bodynge, whose endowment yielded £22 : 10s.\r\n  in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Richard Rothing, the reputed founder of this church, was buried\r\n  here. So also were the following: Walter Nele, vintner, sheriff in\r\n  1337; John Oxenford, vintner, mayor in 1341; John Wroth, fishmonger,\r\n  mayor in 1360; John Bromer, fishmonger, alderman in 1474; William\r\n  Venor, grocer, mayor in 1389; William Moor, vintner, mayor in 1395;\r\n  Robert Chichele, grocer, mayor in 1421; James Spencer, vintner,\r\n  mayor in 1527; Richard Lyons, sheriff in 1374, beheaded by Wat\r\n  Tyler; Richard Platt, brewer, founder of a free school and\r\n  almshouses in Hertfordshire. There were tombs of importance:\r\n  especially curious were those of Richard Lyons and the Countess of\r\n  Worcester, which had either great brasses or recumbent effigies;\r\n  also the tombs of Sir George Stanley, K.G., and his first wife; John\r\n  Stanley; Lord Strange, 1503; and the Countess of Huntingdon. The\r\n  church owned many precious things: an inventory of its jewels in\r\n  1449 is still preserved at Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n  There was a charity school in Maiden Lane, which by the subscription\r\n  of the whole ward maintained fifty boys.\r\n\r\n  Arthur Bulkely (died 1553), Bishop of Bangor, was rector here. Also\r\n  Charles Booth, Bishop of Hereford, 1516.\r\n\r\nAdjoining to the church on the south side stood a house called “The\r\nCommons”: it had been given by one Thomas Kente for keeping his\r\nanniversary in the church. Here dwelt the chantry priests, who held the\r\ntenure. When the chantries were suppressed by Edward VI. “The Commons”\r\nwas valued at 53s. 4d. a year: no fewer than nine “incumbents,” who had\r\nlife interests in the chantry property of the parish, received pensions\r\nunder Mary in 1555-1556. The total chantry property fetched £2551 : 3s.\r\nIn the church was founded a Guild or Fraternity of St. James in 1375: it\r\nwas practically a religious Benefit Society: the members, men and women,\r\nwere sworn together for the amendment of their lives: on one Sunday in\r\nthe year they held an annual feast: they paid entrance fees and\r\nperiodical subscriptions. A member of seven years’ standing was eligible\r\nfor a sickness or old age allowance of fourteen-pence a week, and in\r\ncase of false imprisonment a needy member would be granted a sum of\r\nthirteen-pence a week. In the year 1566 the church was repaired. The\r\nparish bought the rood-loft which had been taken in Protestant propriety\r\nfrom St. Martin Vintry; the woodwork was utilised for their new\r\nfittings. Edmund Chapman, the Queen’s joiner, carried out the work. He\r\nwas afterwards buried in the church, and his monument narrated that:\r\n\r\n                 Fine pews within this church he made,\r\n                   And with his Arms support\r\n                 The table and the seats in choir\r\n                   He set in comely sort.\r\n\r\nHere it was that Sir Richard Steele heard the Common Prayer read so\r\ndistinctly, emphatically and fervently that inattention was\r\nimpossible.[7] The reader who drew forth his praise was the then rector,\r\nPhilip Stubbs, afterwards Archdeacon of St. Albans. There is kept in the\r\nchurch a shrouded corpse in a remarkable state of preservation; formerly\r\nit was one of the show things for the benefit of the churchkeeper, but\r\nthough still above ground it is not now publicly exposed. The parish\r\nregisters date back to 1536, two years before Thomas Cromwell made a\r\ngeneral order for the keeping of such records. They are amongst the\r\noldest in the City. Before the Great Fire there stood south of the\r\nchurch, nearly opposite to Vintners’ Hall, a parsonage. In 1670 it was\r\nrebuilt and leased to one Richard Corbet for forty-one years.\r\n\r\nOpposite, at the corner of Garlick Hill, was Ormond Place, residence of\r\nthe Earls of Ormond. Farther east, on the same side, stood =Ringed\r\nHall=. At the west end of the Church of St. Thomas was a lane called by\r\nStow Wringwren Lane, a most interesting survival. Of old not only were\r\nwines imported into Vintry ward, but grapes were grown here. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon name for wine-press was “winwringa”; that word reversed into\r\n“wringa-win” is undoubtedly contained in the corrupted form of\r\n“Wringwren.” Perhaps a wine-press stood in the lane; the proximity of\r\n“Ringed” Hall seems to strengthen the probability.\r\n\r\nThe lane called =Worcester Place= serves to mark the site of Worcester\r\nHouse, the old residence of the Earls of Worcester. One of them, John\r\nTiptoft, Lord High Treasurer of England, dwelt here in the reign of\r\nEdward IV. This earl was a patron of Caxton, and a great lover of books;\r\nto Oxford University he gave volumes to the value of 500 marks. He was\r\nbeheaded on Tower Hill in 1470, when, as Fuller puts it, “the axe then\r\ndid in one blow cut off more learning than was in the heads of all the\r\nsurviving nobility.” Nevertheless he was known as “The Butcher of\r\nEngland.” He had impaled forty Lancastrians at Southampton, and slain\r\nthe infant children of Desmond, the Irish chief. One of the countesses\r\nof Worcester was buried in the old church of St. James, Garlickhithe,\r\nclose by. By the end of Elizabeth’s reign the premises were let out in\r\ntenements. In 1603 they were in possession of one Matthew Paris,\r\ngirdler, who left them, by will bearing that year’s date, to his mother\r\nKatherine, then living in Aldermanbury.[8] The Fruiterers Company were\r\nthen occupying one or more of the tenements as their Hall, although they\r\nwere not incorporated until 1606. Their choice of this locality\r\nindicates that much of the fruit trade was centred here. Worcester House\r\nperished in the Great Fire. The Fruiterers were too poor to establish a\r\nnew hall, but met in that of the Parish Clerks.\r\n\r\n=Maiden Lane= appears as “Kyrunelane” in 1259. Stow writes it Kerion\r\nLane, “of one Kerion sometime dwelling there,” but this etymology is\r\nguesswork, as shown by the earlier forms. Before the Fire the lane\r\ncontained “divers fair houses for merchants,” says Stow, and the\r\nGlaziers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n=Queen Street= was cut shortly after the Great Fire of 1666 in common\r\nwith King Street, Cheapside, to connect the Guildhall with the Thames;\r\nthus the Lord Mayor now had a straight course for his procession when he\r\n“took water” at the Three Cranes Stairs on his way to be sworn at\r\nWestminster Hall. The new thoroughfare included the present Queen Street\r\nPlace, and was named New Queen Street in honour of the wife of Charles\r\nII. The prefix “New” subsequently vanished. Close to Queen Street in\r\nUpper Thames Street is the Vintners’ Hall (see p. 229). The rectory\r\nhouse of the parish stands on a portion of St. Thomas the Apostle\r\nChurchyard; the remainder of the churchyard on this side of the street\r\nconsists of a small flagged square enclosed by a railing. The portion of\r\nthe churchyard on the west side of the road, opposite, contains two\r\nhouses; they are the only houses remaining of the post-Fire rebuilding.\r\nIn front, the churchyard serves them for a garden; its two fine\r\nplane-trees set off their quaint red brick walls and pillared and\r\npedimented doorways. The southern house has a delightful room on the\r\nfirst floor, now used as the board room of the Tredegar Iron Company.\r\nThe mantel is exquisite, carved with all the beauty of the Grinling\r\nGibbons school; the walls are wainscotted; the doors all solid mahogany,\r\nover each a carved panel; the medallion cornice, of minutely beautiful\r\ndetail, once carried a panelled ceiling now removed. An ante-room has a\r\nsecond delicately carved mantel, and a panelled ceiling.\r\n\r\n  =St. Martin Vintry= stood at the south corner of Royal or\r\n  Queen Street, Upper Thames Street. Authentic history dates\r\n  back to the Conqueror’s reign, when Ralph Peverell gave the\r\n  Church of St. Martin, London, to the Abbey Church of St.\r\n  Peter, Gloucester. In a document at St. Paul’s (_Hist. MSS.\r\n  Comm. Rep._ IX.) of the year 1257 “St. Martin de Beremanes\r\n  churche” is met with. In the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\n  centuries “St. Martin de Barmannes-cherche” and St. Martin\r\n  Vintry are both used. The church was rebuilt in the beginning\r\n  of the fifteenth century, several bequests having been left\r\n  for the purpose. It was burnt down in the Great Fire and not\r\n  rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of the church, St.\r\n  Michael Royal. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1250.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Bishop of\r\n  Winchester; Ralph Peverell; Abbot and Convent of St. Peter’s,\r\n  Gloucester, from 1388; Henry VIII.; Bishop of Worcester by grant of\r\n  Edward VI., in whose successors it continued up to 1666, when the\r\n  parish was annexed to St. Michael Royal.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 460.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by John Gisors or Jesores, for himself\r\n  and Isabel his wife, to which Geoffrey Stowe was admitted chaplain,\r\n  September 5, 1368.\r\n\r\n  Very few monuments of interest are recorded by Stow. Sir John\r\n  Gisors, mayor in 1311, was buried here; also Sir Ralph Austrie and\r\n  Sir Cuthbert Hacket, mayors. A considerable number of those\r\n  commemorated were “Vinetarii.”\r\n\r\n  According to Stow, there were no bequests or legacies belonging to\r\n  the church, or for public uses; though there were a few for the\r\n  poor. The Stationers Company was donor of £2 : 10s., for bread; the\r\n  Dyers Company was donor of £4 every two years, for clothing; and\r\n  George Lucas was donor of £2.\r\n\r\n  In St. Martin, Vintry, there was a workhouse, and thirteen\r\n  almshouses founded by Sir Richard Whittington, each person being\r\n  allowed 3s. 10d. a week.\r\n\r\n  Bruno Ryves (1596-1677), who suffered much persecution in Puritan\r\n  times, Dean of Chichester and of Windsor, was rector here.\r\n\r\nThe site became a burial-ground. A part is now covered with buildings,\r\nbut the remainder forms a small square, planted with trees—three great\r\nelms, two small limes, one large plane: six trees in all—really quite a\r\nleafy wood for the City! The paths and flower-beds are well tended. A\r\nfew gravestones impart an aspect of sepulchral solemnity. Thus the site\r\nof St. Martin Vintry is not wholly effaced.\r\n\r\nThe =Vintry= stood east of Queenhithe; it was a wharf on which “the\r\nmerchants of Bordeaux craned their wine out of lighters and other\r\nvessels, and then landed and made sale of them within forty days after,\r\nuntil the 28th of Edward I., at which time the said merchants complained\r\nthat they could not sell their wines, paying poundage, neither hire\r\nhouses nor cellars to lay them in.”\r\n\r\nThis was remedied by building storehouses with vaults and cellars for\r\nstorage, where formerly had stood a row of cooks’ shops.\r\n\r\nOn the Vintry wharf were three cranes standing. They gave the name to\r\nThree Cranes Lane. At Three Cranes Stairs, in 1552, the Duke of Somerset\r\nwas landed on his way to the Tower. In 1554 Queen Mary landed here, when\r\nshe paid a visit to the Guildhall and “showyd hare mynde unto the Mayor,\r\naldermen, and the whole craftes of London in hare owne person.”\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Thames Street, just above the Three Cranes wharf\r\nand opposite to St. Martin Vintry, stood a large house built of stone\r\nand timber; below it were vaults for the stowage of wines, for it was a\r\nwine merchant’s mansion known as “The Vintry.” John Gisors, vintner,\r\nmayor 1311, 1312, and 1314, constable of the Tower, dwelt here; also\r\nHenry Picard, vintner, Lord Mayor, 1356. In the year 1363 Picard\r\nsumptuously feasted in this house Edward III.; John II. of France, the\r\nBlack Prince’s prisoner; David, King of Scots; the King of Denmark; the\r\nKing of Cyprus, and many nobles. Truly an illustrious gathering. It is\r\nsaid that the toast of “five times five,” still drunk, owed origin to\r\nthis feast of the five kings. Picard kept his hall for all comers that\r\nwere willing to play dice with him; his wife, the Lady Margaret, kept\r\nher chamber to the same intent for the princesses and ladies. The King\r\nof Cyprus won fifty marks from Picard, but afterwards lost a hundred\r\nmarks and was at pains to conceal his chagrin. “My Lord and King,” said\r\nthe host, “be not agrieved, I covet not your gold but your play, for I\r\nhave not bid you hither that I might grieve you, but that amongst other\r\nthings I might try your play.” Thereupon Picard restored the monarch’s\r\nmarks and good humour at one and the same time, “plentifully bestowing\r\nof his own among the retinue.” Moreover, he gave rich gifts to King\r\nEdward and to the nobles and knights who had that day dined with him “to\r\nthe great glory of the citizens of London.” (Stow).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE VINTNERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  It is probable that a fraternity or company of the Mystery of\r\n  Vintners, by the name of the Wine Tunners of Gascoigne, has existed\r\n  in London from time immemorial.\r\n\r\n  The Company is mentioned in a Municipal Ordinance of the year 1256.\r\n\r\n  By letters patent, 37 Edward III., it was ordained and granted,\r\n  amongst other things, that no merchant should go into Gascony for\r\n  wines, nor use the trade of wine in England, except those who in\r\n  London were enfranchised in the said mystery there, or who, in other\r\n  cities, boroughs, and towns, had skill therein, and that no stranger\r\n  should retail wines; and that the merchants of the said mystery of\r\n  Vintners should elect four persons to see that all wines were sold\r\n  by retail in taverns at a reasonable price for such wine, and of\r\n  such conditions, as they were known, or named, to be; and that the\r\n  taverners should be ruled by such four persons, and likewise that\r\n  the said four persons should correct and amend all defaults that\r\n  should be found in the exercise of the said mystery, and inflict\r\n  punishments by their good advice and consideration, if need were,\r\n  without the mayor, bailiff, or other chief magistrate; and the King\r\n  gave licence to the said Merchant Vintners to export cloth, fish,\r\n  and herrings in exchange for wines; and did ordain that all wines\r\n  coming to London should be landed above London Bridge, westward\r\n  towards the Vintry, so that the King’s butler and gauger and\r\n  searchers might have knowledge thereof, and take the customs and\r\n  prices of right due. Which Letters Patent were exemplified and\r\n  confirmed by inspeximus by King Henry the Sixth by Letters Patent,\r\n  bearing date the eighth day of November, in the sixth year of his\r\n  reign.\r\n\r\n  By another charter of King Henry VII., the King and Queen ordained\r\n  and constituted the mystery of Vintners of the City of London a\r\n  mystery of itself, and the freemen and commonalty thereof were to be\r\n  one body corporate and politic, in deed, fact, and name, by the name\r\n  of the master and wardens and freemen and commonalty of the mystery\r\n  of Vintners of London.\r\n\r\n  Other charters are recited from Edward VI., Queen Mary, Queen\r\n  Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  The members of the Vintners Company, by patrimony or servitude, and\r\n  their widows have, by its various charters, the right to sell\r\n  foreign wine without a licence; and the court of assistants as the\r\n  governing body, when a complaint is made that the privilege is\r\n  abused by any member, summons him to attend, and after hearing the\r\n  evidence on both sides, adjudicates according to its discretion. The\r\n  utmost penalty is disfranchisement.\r\n\r\n  The Company exercises control only over its own members.\r\n\r\n  The Company claims to exercise through its members the privilege of\r\n  selling foreign wine without licence throughout England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COUNCIL CHAMBER, VINTNERS’ HALL\r\n\r\n  Vintner Sheriff receiving the Congratulations of his Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  It appears that from time immemorial this Company also enjoyed the\r\n  exclusive right of loading and landing, rolling, pitching and\r\n  turning all wines and spirits imported to, or exported from the City\r\n  of London, and all places within three miles of the same. From this\r\n  franchise which was, and still is exercised by its tackle porters,\r\n  the Company derived a very considerable emolument till in the years\r\n  1799, 1800, 1804, and 1805, several Acts of Parliament were passed,\r\n  by which this privilege was in a great measure curtailed. The\r\n  Company indemnifies those persons employing its tackle porters\r\n  against all losses of wines and spirits caused through their\r\n  negligence or accident.\r\n\r\n  The number of liverymen called during ten years is 206. The\r\n  Corporate Income is £9500; the Trust Income is £1500.\r\n\r\n  1. A freeman or his widow has a claim to relief. When admitted by\r\n  patrimony or servitude, a freeman, or his widow, enjoys the\r\n  privilege of a “Free Vintner,” and, if exercising such privilege, is\r\n  exempt from “Billeting,” _i.e._ having soldiers or sailors quartered\r\n  in his or her house.\r\n\r\n  2. The average annual sum distributed amongst the members of the\r\n  court of assistants has amounted, during the last ten years, to\r\n  £886 : 11s., being about £50 each per annum (income tax free).\r\n\r\n  Members of the court receive no pensions or donations.\r\n\r\n  No fees are paid to liverymen or freemen.\r\n\r\n  The average annual sum paid to liverymen and freemen, and their\r\n  widows, in pensions and donations during the last ten years has\r\n  amounted to £2503.\r\n\r\n  3. The qualifications for a pension are: being a member or widow of\r\n  a member in reduced circumstances, between the ages of fifty and\r\n  sixty, or, if younger, being in ill-health. For a donation:\r\n  membership, or being the widow or child of a member.\r\n\r\n  The site of Vintners’ Hall appears in reliable records of the\r\n  fourteenth century. Strype has the account of it: That Sir John\r\n  Stodeye, who held it of Edward III. in free burgage, gave it in\r\n  1329, under style of the Manor of the Vintry, to John Tuke, parson\r\n  of St. Martin Vintry, as a feoffment; that Tuke’s successors claimed\r\n  it as belonging absolutely to the church, whereas it really\r\n  appertained to the Vintners’ Company; that an inquisition was held\r\n  in relation thereto before Sir Ralph Joslyn, in 1477; that a trial\r\n  in the Exchequer followed; and that finally Richard III. decided the\r\n  ownership in favour of the Company,[9] reciting the above statements\r\n  in his grant. It is difficult to harmonise this account with other\r\n  known facts; therefore, leaving it on record, we pass to better\r\n  authenticated matter. Now, Edmund de Sutton owned the site in the\r\n  reign of Edward III.; upon the Thames bank lay his quay, towards the\r\n  high street of the Vintry his houses, cellars, and solars. Upon the\r\n  east stood Spital Lane and the tenements of the Abbess of St. Clare\r\n  in Aldgate; on the west, Cressingham Lane and the tenement of John\r\n  Cressingham; through the midst ran the boundary line between St.\r\n  Martin Vintry parish and St. James-at-Garlickhithe. Sutton’s\r\n  possession was disputed, trial followed, and Sutton “recovered it\r\n  from Walter Turke by Writ of Novel disseisin.” Turke was alderman of\r\n  the ward, and mayor, 1349. Then in 1352 Edmund de Sutton granted the\r\n  whole to John de Stodeye who was sheriff that year. The Vintners\r\n  Company had as yet no licence in mortmain; perhaps Stodeye was\r\n  acting as feoffee for them, perhaps not. Stow relates that he gave\r\n  Spital Lane, “with all the quadrant wherein Vintners’ Hall now\r\n  standeth, with the tenements round about, to the Vintners”; but the\r\n  statement proves nothing either way. Stodeye’s will is dated 1375;\r\n  it makes no mention of the property. His heirs granted it to\r\n  feoffees, and it passed from one to another as a feoffment, until\r\n  finally vested in the Company by the wills of Guy Shuldham (1446)\r\n  and John Porter (1496).[10] Shuldham’s will[11] conveys the\r\n  impression that of his own bounty he added to the original property\r\n  of which he was feoffee. To his foundation are attributed the\r\n  Vintners’ almshouses. His will describes them as “thirteen little\r\n  mansions lying together.” He directs that in them should dwell rent\r\n  free thirteen poor and needy men and women of the Vintners’ craft,\r\n  each to have a penny every week; any of them to be ejected for\r\n  misconduct after three warnings. These “little mansions” were\r\n  probably on the Spital Lane (at that time Stodeye’s Lane) side of\r\n  the Hall; after the Great Fire they were removed to Mile End. Not\r\n  much is known of the old premises, but Shuldham’s will tells us\r\n  something. There was a great hall and a refectory, a parlour with a\r\n  leaden roof, and adjoining it a counting-house with two rooms above;\r\n  a kitchen, pantry and buttery, a coal-house, and a “yard” with a\r\n  well. No doubt the yard lay betwixt hall and river, and answered to\r\n  what was the garden in later years. When the Vintners “built for\r\n  themselves a fair hall and thirteen almshouses” (to quote John\r\n  Stow), these miscellaneous and doubtless inconvenient buildings\r\n  disappeared. In 1497 the premises were inspected for the purpose of\r\n  assessing the fine for amortising them pursuant to the act.[12] Here\r\n  a new pair of stocks was erected in 1609 for punishment of deserving\r\n  members; here General Monk was feasted and entertained by special\r\n  music on April 12, 1660, shortly after the Restoration. Six years\r\n  later a restoration of a different sort was required; the Great Fire\r\n  had wrought its work of woeful ruin, and the Vintners Company must\r\n  needs rebuild. In 1823 the hall was almost entirely rebuilt again.\r\n\r\n=College Street.=—The Walbrook stream, crossing the street, divided\r\nVintry from Dowgate ward. It was spanned by a bridge called in the\r\ntwelfth century Pont-le-Arch, also, but probably later, Stodum Bridge.\r\nThe earliest style of the lane east of that bridge was “Les Arches\r\nLane,” and that would be derived from the bridge. Later, just as St.\r\nMary de Arcabus became St. Mary-le-Bowe, so this lane became “the lane\r\ncalled Le Bowe”; a will of 1307 so styles it. Quite possible Little\r\nCollege Street did not then exist, or existed only as a path on the east\r\nside of the brook; if the latter, there would thus be a bow-like passage\r\nfrom Dowgate Hill to Thomas Street, and both shape and name would be\r\nsingularly in accord. West of the bridge the lane was probably, and in\r\ncommon with the present College Hill, “Paternoster Lane”; afterwards the\r\nhill became “the high street called le Riole,” but this lane seems to\r\nhave retained the old title until Stow wrote of it. When Walbrook stream\r\nbecame arched over, the strict division between Paternoster Lane and Le\r\nBowe Lane disappeared. The course of Walbrook so divided the lane that\r\nthe north side from the church to Skinners’ Hall was included in\r\nPaternoster Lane, and the south side opposite was part of Bowe Lane;\r\nthis distinction would naturally disappear on the covering of the brook.\r\nBefore that event Le Bowe Lane would be all in the parish of Allhallows\r\nthe Great; in 1307 reference is made to it in the parish of St.\r\nMichael’s (_Wills in the Court of Hustings_, pt. i. p. 190), so that the\r\ncovering of the brook appears already to have taken place, at least in\r\npart, by that date. By Stow’s time Le Bowe Lane had become Elbow Lane,\r\nand ran by a crescent course from Dowgate Hill to Thames Street;\r\nPaternoster Lane continued as before. Stow makes an error in each case;\r\nhe misses the true etymology of the former, implying that its elbow-like\r\nbending was the origin of its name, and he surmises that “Les Arches”\r\nwas the old title for Paternoster Lane, which was not so. After the\r\nGreat Fire the whole thoroughfare from College Hill to Dowgate Hill\r\nbecame Elbow Lane, and later Great Elbow Lane; the bend into Thames\r\nStreet was renamed Little Elbow Lane. Subsequently the present styles\r\nwere adopted, and, like College Hill, commemorate Whittington’s College.\r\nCollege Street is quaint: on the south side No. 24 has been rebuilt, and\r\nNo. 27 refaced since the post-Fire rebuilding; otherwise the Vintry\r\nportion remains unaltered. The Skinners’ Hall and all the garden\r\nbelonging to it are close by, though the entry is on Dowgate Hill (see\r\np. 238).\r\n\r\nIn College Street is the Innholders’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE INNHOLDERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  From the records of the Company it appears that it was a Guild or\r\n  Fraternity by prescription under the name of “Hostiller” before the\r\n  same was incorporated by charter.\r\n\r\n  Its earliest known record is a petition preferred on the 12th\r\n  December, 25 Henry VI. (1446), by certain “Men of the Mistery of\r\n  Hostillars of the City,” in the chamber at Guildhall before John\r\n  Colney, mayor, and the aldermen of the City praying them to confirm\r\n  certain ordinances which were ordered to be entered upon the Record\r\n  and observed in all future times.\r\n\r\n  The next record is a petition preferred on 28th October, 13 Edward\r\n  IV., 1437, by the wardens and certain men of the Mistery of\r\n  Hostillers in the chamber of Guildhall, before Mr. Hampton, mayor,\r\n  and the aldermen of the City, stating that the craft or mistery were\r\n  called hostillers and not innholders as they were indeed, by which\r\n  no diversity was perceived between them in name and their servants\r\n  being hostillers indeed, and praying that they might be called\r\n  innholders and in no wise hostillers, which was ordained\r\n  accordingly.\r\n\r\n  On 31st July, 1 Richard III., 1483, another petition was preferred.\r\n\r\n  The present number of liverymen is 86; the Corporate Income is\r\n  £1900; the Trust Income is £225.\r\n\r\n  The Innholders were an ancient fraternity which grew out of the\r\n  Hostelers or Hostillers and the Haymongers. The former provided a\r\n  bare lodging for travellers; the latter provided stabling. The\r\n  visitor or lodger had to go to the tavern for his food and drink.\r\n  The Innholder advanced a step; he received the traveller with his\r\n  horses and his following. If the traveller was a trader, the inn\r\n  received his wagon, his merchandise; while the stable belonging to\r\n  the inn received his horses. The inn provided food, wine, and ale.\r\n  The old Hosteler became the servant of the Innholder and was at last\r\n  restricted to service in the stable.\r\n\r\n  Stow describes the hall as a fair house. After the Great Fire it was\r\n  rebuilt (about 1670) by Wren and Jarman, and the west side of the\r\n  great hall facing Little College Street is of this date. The present\r\n  College Street front was built in 1886 from designs by Mr. J.\r\n  Douglass Mathews, architect. It is a very handsome three-storied\r\n  building of red brick. The door is of remarkably fine carving, of\r\n  curious form, having the appearance of two doors, the smaller\r\n  imposed upon the greater. Above the door under a pedimental canopy\r\n  are the Company’s arms. The great hall, which dates from the old\r\n  building, is a plain apartment, with wainscotted walls, and a flat\r\n  square-panelled ceiling. The fire-place is framed in a fine piece of\r\n  marble, and the mantel is of carved wood.\r\n\r\n  The reception-room is remarkable for a splendid ceiling, said to be\r\n  Wren’s. It has a handsomely moulded oval panel, covering the centre,\r\n  whilst the four corners bear respectively: the date 1670, the arms\r\n  of Charles II., the City arms, and the Innholders’ arms. The room is\r\n  panelled and has a good oak overmantel.\r\n\r\n  In the window of the staircase is some old seventeenth-century\r\n  stained glass, removed from a window of the great hall. One piece\r\n  has the arms of Deputy John Knott, “3rd time master 1670”; the other\r\n  the arms of Captain Richard Pennar, “once master 1678.” The modern\r\n  court-room is of the 1886 rebuilding, and has a good moulded ceiling\r\n  and carved overmantel. It contains two curious old pictures. One the\r\n  arms of Charles II., bearing the mark “C.R.2,” and showing Might and\r\n  Power crushing down Rebellion whilst a peaceful king reigns. The\r\n  other is a representation of the Nativity in the Inn at Bethlehem,\r\n  said to have been presented by Charles II. It depicts St. Joseph\r\n  holding a crucifix. The star in the Innholders’ arms is the Star of\r\n  Bethlehem, which is, of course, shown in this picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. MICHAEL ROYAL\r\n\r\n  St. Michael Royal on College Hill derived its name Royal from the\r\n  adjacent lane “La Riole” (see p. 223); it was sometimes called St.\r\n  Michael Paternoster from Paternoster Lane. “Paternoster-cherch” is\r\n  first found written in the _Calendar of Wills_ (Court of Hustings,\r\n  Part I. p. 3) in 1259; “St. Michael de Paternoster-cherch” in 1284;\r\n  and “Paternostercherche near la Rayole” in 1301. It was rebuilt by\r\n  Sir Richard Whittington. Early in the fifteenth century the old\r\n  church was small, frail, and ruinous: it stood where it now stands,\r\n  but north and east lay unbuilt spaces, green with grass, and\r\n  possibly tree-planted. Across the green to the north stood “The\r\n  Tabard,” the dwelling-house of Whittington, who rebuilt the church\r\n  on a larger scale, granting land of his own for the purpose in 1411.\r\n  The site available measured 113 feet long from east to west, just as\r\n  now there is a graveyard 26 feet long. The new building had a\r\n  castellated parapet: the tower stood at the west end, square,\r\n  embattled, surmounted by a great cross. Beneath the tower a great\r\n  doorway opened upon Paternoster Lane. It was destroyed in the Great\r\n  Fire and rebuilt by Edward Strong, Wren’s master-mason, in 1694; the\r\n  steeple was added in 1713. The church of St. Martin Vintry was not\r\n  rebuilt after the Fire, its parish being annexed to this. The\r\n  parishes of Allhallows the Great and Allhallows the Less were also\r\n  annexed in 1893. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1282.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, 1282; the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  Canterbury from 1550 to 1666, when St. Martin Vintry was annexed and\r\n  the patronage was alternate with the Bishop of Worcester.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 213.\r\n\r\n  The church is oblong in shape, 67 feet in length, 47 feet in width,\r\n  and 38 feet in height. The oak altar-piece is said to be the work of\r\n  Grinling Gibbons, and above it there is a painting by William\r\n  Hilton, R.A., presented in 1820 by the directors of the London\r\n  Institution. The tower is square and contains three stories\r\n  terminated by a cornice and parapet, with vases at the angles; it is\r\n  surmounted by a shallow dome on four arches, and encircled by Ionic\r\n  columns. Above this the steeple is octagonal, crowned by a pedestal\r\n  with finial and vane. The total height is 128 feet 3 inches. The\r\n  church was repaired and the interior arrangements remodelled in\r\n  1864; in 1895 was again repaired; at this date the carved woodwork\r\n  and the organ case from Allhallows the Great were utilised on the\r\n  demolition of that church. Beneath the tower is preserved a carving\r\n  of the royal arms (William and Mary); this stood above the reredos\r\n  before the placing of the picture there in 1820. The tower contains\r\n  one bell.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by Lawrence Duket in 1289.\r\n\r\n  The church contained but few monuments of note. There was one in\r\n  memory of John Haydon, mercer, Sheriff 1582, and benefactor of the\r\n  parish. Sir Richard Whittington, the founder of the church, was also\r\n  commemorated; he was buried here with his wife, and the traditional\r\n  site of the tomb, which was destroyed in the Great Fire, is where\r\n  the sanctuary rail and organ are.\r\n\r\n  The only monument of any interest in the present building is one to\r\n  Sir Samuel Pennant, who died 1750, during his mayoralty; he died of\r\n  gaol fever, caught in discharging his duty in visiting Newgate.\r\n  There is a memorial tablet to Jacob Jacobsen on the west wall;\r\n  Bishop Wadington’s arms can be seen in the south-west window.\r\n\r\n  Reginald Peacock, Bishop of Chichester, 1449, was rector here; also\r\n  William Ive (d. 1485), Vice-Chancellor of Oxford; Humphrey Hody\r\n  (1659-1707), Regius Professor of Greek, Oxford; and Richard Smith\r\n  (1500-1563), Dean of Douai and a great pillar of the Catholic\r\n  Church.\r\n\r\nUnder Whittington’s will, the church became collegiate in 1424. A\r\ncollege of St. Spirit and St. Mary, the college house, the almshouse,\r\nalso of Whittington’s foundation, and a parcel of ground then a garden,\r\nbut intended for consecration as a new churchyard, were grouped north of\r\nthe church, between that and Whittington’s own dwelling. They probably\r\ncomposed a quadrangle. The almshouse was called “God’s House or\r\nAlms-house or the hospital of Richard Whittington.” It was for twelve\r\npoor folk, men and women, and a “tutor” who had custody of the goods,\r\nand was to preserve order. He had a separate apartment—the twelve others\r\nlived more together; all dined and supped in common hall. They were to\r\npray daily for their founder, his wife and others; to behave seemly; to\r\nread, work, or meditate; to dress in dark brown, “not staring nor\r\nblazing in colour.” The college house was for the accommodation of five\r\nfellows or chaplains, two clerks, and four choristers; these composed\r\nthe collegiate staff. The fellows were secular priests, that is to say,\r\nnot regulars or conventual clergy; they were to be masters of art, poor\r\nmen, unbeneficed. One of them was to occupy the position of master. The\r\nchurch ceased as a rectory when it became a collegiate. The then rector\r\nwas appointed the first master and he was to continue his parochial\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the century the members had formed themselves into a\r\nfraternity—_Fraternitas Scantæ Sopluæ_—for the reading of a divinity\r\nlecture. A little later a divinity reader was provided by a bequest, and\r\nanother legacy was allotted to the fellows, so that each should deliver\r\ntwo additional sermons every year, either in the City or out.\r\nWhittington’s estates originally produced £63 per annum for the college\r\nand £40 per annum for the almshouse. At the suppression of the former,\r\nunder Edward VI., the value was returned at only £20 : 1 : 8 per annum;\r\nthe college house and garden were sold for £92 : 2s. to Armagil Waad, or\r\nWade, Clerk of the Council, in 1548. The almshouse was not then\r\naffected, but was and is administered by the Mercers Company. It was\r\nrebuilt after the Great Fire. In 1808 the almshouse people were removed\r\nto Highgate. The Mercers’ School, rebuilt in Old Jewry in 1670, removed\r\nto Budge Row in 1787, and burnt down and removed to 20 Red Lion Court,\r\nopposite to St. Antholin’s, Watling Street, in 1804, was settled in the\r\nold almshouses on their becoming empty. In 1832 the premises were\r\nrebuilt. Externally they present a plain structure of stone, with a\r\ngreat projecting cornice; the interior is spacious, the flagged\r\nplayground still preserves a suggestion of collegiate cloisters. Here\r\nalmsmen walked, here college fellows paced, here hearty schoolboys\r\nshouted—now all is silent and untenanted. The Mercers’ School is now\r\nremoved to Holborn.\r\n\r\nThe name College Hill does not occur in Stow, but Newcourt’s map of 1658\r\nso styles it: it bore reference to Whittington’s College. As the Duke of\r\nBuckingham’s “Litany” (1679) has it, there was thus “Nought left of a\r\nCollege, but College Hill.” Ogilby’s post-Fire map (1677) names the\r\nstreet College Hill only so far north as Cloak Lane; above that it was\r\nTower Royal Street: both portions are now reckoned as College Hill as\r\nfar as Cannon Street. At the corner of the present Maiden Lane was\r\nsituated, in the fourteenth century, the house and tavern of Richard\r\nChaucer, vintner, step-grandfather to Geoffrey Chaucer, the poet.\r\nPerhaps the latter dwelt here.\r\n\r\nAfter the Great Fire “a very large and graceful building” with great\r\ncourtyards was erected on College Hill. Here lived the second and last\r\nVilliers, Duke of Buckingham, “for the more security of his trade, and\r\nconvenience of driving it among the Londoners.” This dissolute but\r\nclever courtier was nicknamed “Alderman Buckingham” and satirised by\r\nDryden as “Zimri” who was “everything by starts and nothing long.” The\r\nhouse was sometime the residence of Sir John Lethieullier, merchant and\r\nalderman, sheriff in 1674; it has since disappeared, but portions of the\r\ncourtyard remain. One of these is Newcastle Court, on the west of\r\nCollege Hill, now merely a yard between backs of great houses, and a\r\npostern entrance to the Cloak Lane Police Station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WHITTINGTON’S HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the general houses which Strype (1720) says were “well built and\r\ninhabited by merchants and others,” none remain, except Nos. 3 and 4 on\r\nthe west side, of which the latter has a quaintly carved tympanum above\r\nthe front door: and Nos. 21 and 22 on the east side. The two last or\r\nsome part of them stand upon the site of “The Tabard,” Whittington’s own\r\ndwelling-house. Here are two stories of cellars in the northern house,\r\nwhose foundation walls are built from stones possibly once forming the\r\nmaterials of Whittington’s mansion. Both premises have massive\r\nstaircases, and the southernmost possesses some well-carved doorcases.\r\nThe little courtyards before them are each entered through a great porch\r\nwith timbered sides, and heavy panelled doors shut it off from the\r\nstreet. The arched gateways of the porches are pedimented, the tympanums\r\nfilled with a profusion of luxuriant carvings—grotesque heads, drapery,\r\ngarlands of flowers and fruit. Above the gateways stand porch-rooms;\r\nstill higher little latticed dormer windows peep out of the quaint,\r\ntiled roofs. The porches are the pride of the hill, and well serve to\r\nmark so illustrious a site.\r\n\r\nStow calls =Dowgate Hill= “the high street called Downgate,” and by that\r\nhe doubtless includes both the hill on the north side of Thames Street\r\nand Dowgate Dock on the south side of the same. The east side is now\r\nwholly occupied by the immense wall of Cannon Street hotel and station.\r\nOnly a portion of the former is in the ward. Beneath the latter, opening\r\nupon the street, are several cellars called Dowgate vaults. Previously\r\nto the erection of the station a lane called Chequer Yard ran from\r\nopposite Dyers’ Hall to Bush Lane. Stow terms it Chequer Lane, or Alley,\r\n“of an inn called the Chequer.” Its former name, he says, was Carter\r\nLane, “of carts and carmen having stables there.” Strype calls it “a\r\npretty good open space.” Malcolm (1802) says Chequer Yard then consisted\r\nof a vast range of warehouses, many stories in height, always filled\r\nwith tobacco, cotton, coffee, etc. Amongst these were the Plumbers’ Hall\r\nwarehouses. Here formerly stood Plumbers’ Hall (see Appendix) and the\r\nChequer Inn. “The Chequer” is mentioned as a brew-house so early as the\r\nreign of Richard III., when it appears to have appertained to the Erber.\r\nIt was rebuilt as an inn after the Great Fire, and stood in a courtyard\r\non the south side of the lane, near the west end. It had a gate and a\r\npassage into Dowgate Hill. Strype (1720) says it was “an inn of no great\r\naccount, being chiefly for livery stables and horses.” In Strype’s 1754\r\nedition all mention of the inn is omitted, so that it had, presumably,\r\nvanished during the intervening thirty-four years. At the north-west\r\ncorner of Chequer Yard was the site of the Erber (p. 245). Previously to\r\nthe erection of the station, the hill forked opposite to Skinners’ Hall\r\nand turned into Cannon Street by two narrow lanes. Of these the\r\nnorth-eastern was Turnwheele Lane, “from a turnpike in the middle\r\nthereof”; the north-western retained the name of Dowgate Hill. They had\r\nbetween them at the fork a block of buildings. When the station was\r\nbuilt, Turnwheele Lane was covered and Dowgate Hill was widened by\r\nabsorbing the block. Towards “the upper end of the hill, stood the fair\r\nConduit-upon-Dowgate,” mentioned by Stow as “castellated, and made in\r\nthe year 1568, at charges of the citizens.” In Ryther’s map, 1604\r\n(British Museum), it is shown to stand in the middle of Dowgate Hill\r\nopposite the end of Cloak Lane. It was destroyed in the Great Fire and\r\nnot rebuilt. Allen, in his _History of London_, places it at the\r\nsouth-east corner of Walbrook, in Walbrook ward; evidently he is\r\nmistaken. On the west side the ward begins at the corner of Cloak Lane,\r\nof which only a part of the southern side is in Dowgate. Thence\r\nproceeding southwards is Tallow Chandlers’ Hall (see p. 243).\r\n\r\nAt 8 Dowgate Hill is\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SKINNERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  It is probable that, like other traders who came to London in early\r\n  times, men following the trade of Skinners were assigned some\r\n  separate locality in the town and associated together for the\r\n  purposes of a guild.\r\n\r\n  In course of time, as the guild grew in importance, the Skinners\r\n  seem to have absorbed or affiliated unto themselves two other\r\n  trades, the Upholders and the Tawyers.\r\n\r\n  It is clear that as long ago as the reign of Henry VI. the guild\r\n  included among its members other than those who exercised the trades\r\n  of Skinner, Tawyer, and Upholder, for in one of the Company’s books,\r\n  dated 25th July, 23 Henry VI., there is a list of names of the\r\n  brethren and sistren of the guild at that time. They amount to\r\n  twenty in all, and include one doctor, three gentlemen, nine of no\r\n  trade or description, two butchers, one dyer, one joiner, one\r\n  skinner, one grocer, as brethren, and one sister as silkwife.\r\n\r\n  The Company has a copy of the charter of Henry VI., but none of that\r\n  of Philip and Mary. They are Inspeximus charters, as also is that of\r\n  22nd March, 2 Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  During the reign of Queen Elizabeth differences arose between the\r\n  working “artesans” of the guild and the rest of the fraternity,\r\n  especially the governing body, which continued for many years and\r\n  culminated in a surreptitious application in 1606 by the Artisan\r\n  Skinners for new Letters Patent from the Crown without the consent\r\n  or privity of the master and wardens of the guild, and in December\r\n  1606 (4 James I.) a charter was issued. Full inquiry was made. The\r\n  Lord Mayor and aldermen made their report to the lords of the Privy\r\n  Council, who thereupon ordered (March 22, 1606) that the privy seal\r\n  that had been procured by the Artisan Skinners for this new charter\r\n  appertaining to the Company of Skinners should be cancelled.\r\n\r\n  The charters and title deeds of the Skinners Company were\r\n  surrendered in 1625 like those of the other City Companies, but in\r\n  1641 their privileges were restored.\r\n\r\n  After the restoration of King Charles II. the Skinners Company\r\n  obtained the charter dated 20th June, 19 Charles II. It grants\r\n  nothing new, but merely confirms to the master and wardens of the\r\n  guild or fraternity all they had under any of their previous\r\n  charters.\r\n\r\n  Passing to 1744, the Artisan Skinners appear to have thought that if\r\n  they could only be more fully represented on the governing body of\r\n  the Company, their trade grievances would be redressed, and they\r\n  accordingly, in October 1744, presented a remonstrance to the Court.\r\n\r\n  The result of this was that in three months the master and three\r\n  wardens were served with a copy of a rule for a mandamus commanding\r\n  them to choose a number of Artisan Skinners to be wardens and\r\n  assistants. The governing body, in reply, set out the whole of the\r\n  proceedings of 1606, but the mandamus was ultimately issued and a\r\n  return made to the writ. At the hearing, counsel for the\r\n  prosecutors, the artisans, informed the Court of King’s Bench that\r\n  he had perused the return and could not find any fault with it, and\r\n  accordingly the judges ordered the return of the master and wardens\r\n  to be affirmed.\r\n\r\n  In December 1747 similar hostile proceedings were renewed, and led\r\n  finally to an information for a false return being filed against the\r\n  master and wardens in June 1748. The cause came on for trial at the\r\n  King’s Bench bar on the 24th April following, and the jurors,\r\n  without going out of court, brought in a verdict of not guilty.\r\n\r\n  The number of liverymen is 200; the Corporate Income is £27,500; the\r\n  Trust Income is £17,500.\r\n\r\n  A freeman of the Skinners Company is eligible, as vacancies from\r\n  time to time occur, to a presentation for his child to Christ’s\r\n  Hospital, ten such presentations being given to the Company under\r\n  the benefaction of Mr. William Stoddart. Besides being eligible for\r\n  certain almshouses and pensions, poor freemen who have fallen into\r\n  straitened circumstances obtain charitable assistance from the\r\n  Company at the discretion of the governing body, as also do the\r\n  widows and children of such poor freemen. Freemen are entitled to a\r\n  preference among applicants for loans under trusts administered by\r\n  the Company. They are also with their sons and apprentices eligible\r\n  under certain conditions for exhibitions founded by the Company, and\r\n  their sons will have a preference for admission into the Company’s\r\n  Middle School, referred to in another part of this return, if there\r\n  should not be room for all the candidates. Liverymen have similar\r\n  claims. They also attend at dinners given to the livery at the\r\n  Company’s Hall, and have the privilege of occasionally introducing\r\n  friends at such dinners. The master and wardens and other members of\r\n  the court have similar rights and privileges. They also receive fees\r\n  as members of the governing body in respect of their attendance at\r\n  courts and committees as already stated.\r\n\r\n  Assistance is granted by the Company to members if it appears upon\r\n  inquiry that from misfortune or by reason of sickness, infirmity, or\r\n  from other good cause they are in need.\r\n\r\n  Stow describes Skinners’ Hall as “a fair house, which was sometime\r\n  called Copped Hall by Downgate.” Copped Hall was purchased by the\r\n  Skinners, together with several small tenements adjacent, in the\r\n  reign of Henry III. (about 1260-62). The Company afterwards held it\r\n  under a licence of mortmain granted by that king. It was\r\n  subsequently alienated, though by what means is uncertain, and in\r\n  1326, according to Stow, it was possessed by Ralph de Cobham, the\r\n  brave Kentish warrior, who made Edward III. his heir. Edward III.\r\n  restored the hall to the Skinners at about the time of the Company’s\r\n  legal incorporation (1327).\r\n\r\n  Of Copped Hall no plan exists, but it is probable that four small\r\n  tenements occupied the Dowgate Hill frontage (50 feet), and it is\r\n  known that there was a court or quadrangle somewhat like the present\r\n  one with an entrance from it direct into the hall. It perished in\r\n  the Great Fire of 1666, soon after which the rubbish and lead were\r\n  sold. There still remain, however, some of the old walls, and the\r\n  great stone fireplace of the kitchen was discovered when excavating\r\n  in the present cellars about 1870. On October 15, 1668, a committee,\r\n  of which Sir George Waterman, Master of the Skinners, and Sir Thomas\r\n  Pilkington were members, was appointed to carry out the rebuilding,\r\n  the Company meanwhile holding their courts in various places as at\r\n  Salters’ Hall, the Red Bull Inn, Bishopsgate, and in the church of\r\n  St. Helen.\r\n\r\n  In November 1688 “the front houses at Skinners’ Hall” were ordered\r\n  to be rebuilt; in the February following the Renter was empowered to\r\n  make a gateway of stone or timber as he thought fit; and the\r\n  quadrangle was ordered to be 40 feet square. By 1672 the rebuilding\r\n  must have been practically finished, for Sir George Waterman kept\r\n  his mayoralty here in 1672-73, renting the hall for £160.\r\n\r\n  The Dowgate Hill front was rebuilt under the Company’s surveyor in\r\n  1777, and Mr. Jupp, afterwards surveyor to the Company, also made\r\n  some alterations. This front is somewhat like that of Old Covent\r\n  Garden Theatre in the time of Garrick. It is a regular three-storied\r\n  building of the Ionic order. The basement part to the level of the\r\n  first story is of stone, and rusticated; from this rise six\r\n  pilasters supporting an entablature and pediment all of the same\r\n  material. In the tympanum are the Company’s arms. In the facade are\r\n  two doorways, one leading to the quadrangle before the great hall,\r\n  the other to the clerks’ offices. Across the quadrangle is a carved\r\n  doorway, the principal entrance to the lobby in front of the great\r\n  hall. This hall is a very handsome apartment. It was rebuilt 1849-50\r\n  under the direction of Mr. G. B. Moore, and was restored and\r\n  decorated in 1891 at much expense. Up to that time the walls had\r\n  been wainscotted; they are now panelled in light oak to a higher\r\n  level, the panelling being crowned by a fine frieze decorated with\r\n  raised shields, and a cornice. The carved roof is richly decorated\r\n  and contains a wagon-headed skylight. The entrance to the hall is at\r\n  the north end through a splendid carved oak screen, which in 1891\r\n  supplanted the original Ionic screen ordered for the hall in 1760.\r\n  Behind the hall is a small Committee room with a good fireplace,\r\n  above which is a carved panel in the style of Grinling Gibbons.\r\n  Beyond is the court room. On the floor above is the great cedar\r\n  parlour or withdrawing room. It is a magnificent chamber, redolent\r\n  with the scent of the red cedar, in which material the whole of the\r\n  interior is executed. The cedar wood is said to have been presented\r\n  by the East India Company. The walls are wainscotted up to the\r\n  frieze and cornice, the former of which is carved both in light and\r\n  dark wood, the whole being richly gilt. From the cornice springs the\r\n  coved ceiling, which is panelled and painted, and which, some years\r\n  ago, when the room was redecorated under the mastership of Mr.\r\n  Charles Barry, architect, was substituted for the old ceiling. The\r\n  doors are handsomely carved and pedimented. Over the fireplace is a\r\n  panel carved in Grinling Gibbon’s best style, displaying the\r\n  Company’s arms wreathed about with festoons of dark wood on the\r\n  light cedar panel.\r\n\r\n  At one end, in glass cases, are two curious coloured statuettes, one\r\n  representing Edward III., the other Sir Andrew Judd, both neat\r\n  pieces of work.\r\n\r\n  The grand staircase is well designed, and displays some of the massy\r\n  carving and rich ornaments in vogue just after the Great Fire.\r\n  Attached to the hall is a small garden, in which are a tree and\r\n  several flower-beds, also a curiously embossed cistern dated 1768.\r\n  The original cost of the Skinners’ Hall was, according to the _New\r\n  View of London_ (1708), £18,000, but much has since been spent upon\r\n  it. Several Lord Mayors and sheriffs have kept their year of office\r\n  here, and in 1691 the new East India Company, before their\r\n  incorporation with the old Company, began to hold their meetings\r\n  here, paying an annual rent of £300. In consequence of these\r\n  meetings the new Company afterwards presented to the hall a carved\r\n  mahogany court-table and silver candlesticks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE DYERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Dyers Company was in existence in 1381, and probably even\r\n  earlier.\r\n\r\n  The first charter was that granted by Henry VI. in 1471; this was\r\n  renewed by Edward IV. in 1472. The charter was confirmed or renewed\r\n  by Henry VIII., Edward VI., Elizabeth, and Mary. An Inspeximus\r\n  charter was granted, 2 Elizabeth 1559 and by 4 James I. 1606; James\r\n  II. gave the Company a charter 1688, and they were re-incorporated\r\n  by Anne 1704.\r\n\r\n  The number of the livery is now 61; the Corporate Income is £5000;\r\n  the Trust Income £1000.\r\n\r\n  The Company has the right to keep swans on the river Thames. This\r\n  privilege they share with the vintners, and the “Barge masters” of\r\n  both Companies have the care of the swans.\r\n\r\n  Dyers’ Hall extends from Skinners’ Hall to the corner of College\r\n  Street, and occupies the site of Jesus’ Commons, which was, says\r\n  Stow (1598), “a college of priests, a house well furnished with\r\n  brass, pewter, napery, plate, etc., besides a fair library well\r\n  stored with books, all which of old time was given to a number of\r\n  priests that should keep commons there, and as one left his place,\r\n  by death or otherwise, another should be admitted into his room, but\r\n  this order within this thirty years being discontinued, the said\r\n  house was dissolved, and turned to tenements.”\r\n\r\n  The Dyers’ Hall consists of a plain four-storied building, the\r\n  basement being of stone, the upper part of white brick with stone\r\n  facings. Part of the lower story is let out as business premises,\r\n  the corner at College Street being allotted to the Bunch of Grapes\r\n  Inn. The great hall is a large and lofty room, but comparatively\r\n  plain. It is relieved by rather handsome frieze and cornice and is\r\n  lighted by two windows, one at either end.\r\n\r\n  The Company’s Hall in use prior to 1666 stood at the south end of\r\n  what is now Dyers’ Hall Wharf, Upper Thames Street. It was destroyed\r\n  in the Great Fire and apparently rebuilt in a stately manner, but\r\n  again destroyed by fire in 1681. (Malcolm, 1802.) For several years\r\n  the Company met in Salters’ Hall. Maitland (1739) says “the Company\r\n  has converted one of their houses in little Elbow Lane into a hall\r\n  to transact their business in.” This fell down in 1768. The next\r\n  hall was erected about 1770. It was a tolerably spacious unassuming\r\n  building, the exterior distinguished by a double flight of steps,\r\n  but was not of any architectural merit. The present hall was built\r\n  1839-40 (Charles Dyer, architect). Some additions and alterations\r\n  were made to it 1865-67 by D. A. Corbett, architect. (See Lond. and\r\n  Mid. _Arch. Trans._ vol. v. p. 452.)\r\n\r\n  The Dyers’ Wharf estate is now covered with warehouses. Those on the\r\n  riverside are known as the Monument Bonded Warehouses. The archives\r\n  of the Company were destroyed in the Great Fire.\r\n\r\nThe slope of Dowgate Hill is now a gradual one, but Stow speaks of it as\r\nof rapid descent, and relates that in 1574 the channels became so\r\nswollen and swift in a heavy storm of rain, that a lad of eighteen,\r\nendeavouring to leap over near the conduit, was taken with the stream\r\nand carried thence against a cartwheel that stood in the watergate,\r\n“before which time he was drowned and stark dead.” Strype (1720)\r\nmentions that the hill was still so steep that in great rains floods\r\narose in the lower parts. Ben Jonson speaks of “Dowgate torrents falling\r\ninto Thames.”\r\n\r\nDowgate Wharf or Dock is supposed to have gained its name from its steep\r\ndescent to the river, as it was sometimes called Downgate, but this\r\nderivation sounds highly improbable. One of the most ancient ferries\r\nover the Thames was at Dowgate. On the east side of the dock is Walbrook\r\nWharf, showing the spot where the ancient stream, the Walbrook, reached\r\nthe Thames.\r\n\r\nRobert Green the dramatist, from whom Shakespeare borrowed the plot of\r\nhis _Winter’s Tale_, died (1592) in an obscure lodging at the house of a\r\nshoemaker in Dowgate, indebted to his landlord for the bare necessaries\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of Dowgate Hill near Cloak Lane stood St. John the\r\nBaptist’s Church.\r\n\r\n  =St. John the Baptist= was situated on the west side of Dowgate Hill\r\n  in the ward of Walbrook. _Ecclesia Sancti Johannis super Walbroc_,\r\n  occurs about 1181; _ecclesia Sancti Johis de Walbrook_ is set down\r\n  in the “Taxatio Ecclesiasticus” of Pope Nicholas IV. (1291). The\r\n  first mention of the church is contained in a book at the Cathedral\r\n  (Newcourt, i. p. 371) compiled in the time of Ralph de Diceto made\r\n  dean 1181. The entry is as follows:—“_Ecclesia Sancti Johannis super\r\n  Walbroc_ est Canonicorum, & reddit eis ii sol. per manum _Vitalis_\r\n  clerici, solvit Synodalia ivd, Archidiacono xiid. & habet in domino\r\n  suo quondam terram, quae reddit ii sol. & est de feodo _Willimi de\r\n  la Mare_, & etiam terrulam, quae est inter ecclesiam & _Walbroc_ &\r\n  reddit iii sol.   non habet coemiterium.”\r\n\r\n  Thus the earliest church stood upon the east side of the stream, a\r\n  little tract of land intervening between its west wall and the bank.\r\n  When the watercourse was diverted to flow more eastwards, the\r\n  chancel bordered on the brook. It was rebuilt about 1412, and again\r\n  in 1621, but destroyed by the Great Fire in 1666, when its parish\r\n  was annexed to that of St. Antholin. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1150.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of St. Paul’s in 1150, who granted it to the Prioress and\r\n  Convent of St. Helen about 1373, till it was seized by Henry VIII.\r\n  and so continued in the Crown up to 1671, when it was annexed to St.\r\n  Antholin.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 375.\r\n\r\n  Only two monuments are recorded by Stow as being of note—W.\r\n  Combarton, Skinner, who gave lands to the church, buried 1410; and\r\n  John Stone, Taylor, Sheriff 1464.\r\n\r\nThe site of the building was converted into a churchyard, and upon the\r\nwall is a stone with this inscription:\r\n\r\n  “‘Before the dreadfull Fire, anno domini 1666, here stood the parish\r\n  church St. John Baptist, upon Walbrook—William Wilkins, James\r\n  Whitchurch, churchwardens this present year anno domini 1674.’ The\r\n  above stone was refaced, and the letters fresh cut anno domini\r\n  1836—Rev. John Gordon M.A. rector, Edward Jones, Lewis Williams,\r\n  churchwardens.”\r\n\r\nThe parsonage was not rebuilt, and Strype notes (1754, vol. i. p. 516)\r\nthat neither its site nor that of its garden was given in the 1693\r\nvisitation. Newcourt (_Repertorium_, i. p. 371) further notes that the\r\nsame visitation records great encroachments having been made on the\r\nchurchyard since the Fire “to some of which the parish had consented,\r\nand others have been done by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen,\r\nwithout the consent of the Archbishop and Bishop of London (as ’tis\r\nsaid) and the Chamberlain of London receives the rent for them.”\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the commercial civilisation of this century to\r\n“encroach” the churchyard out of existence. The Act of the Metropolitan\r\nRailway gave the Company power to construct their Cannon Street Station\r\n(1883) under the burial-ground, and to remove the human remains. The\r\nchurchyard is no more; the greater part of its site is enclosed by a\r\nbrick wall which screens the opening in the roof of the station below.\r\nAt the extreme west end an asphalted square has been railed in and\r\nreserved as a home for gravestones, and a large ornament bearing this\r\nmelancholy and curious inscription:\r\n\r\n  Sacred to the memory of the dead interred in the ancient church and\r\n  churchyard of St. John the Baptist upon Walbrook during four\r\n  centuries. The formation of the District Railway having necessitated\r\n  the destruction of the greater part of the churchyard, all the human\r\n  remains contained therein were carefully collected and re-interred\r\n  in a vault beneath this monument A.D. 1884.—Rev. LEWIS BORRETT\r\n  WHITE, D.D., rector; JOHN R. W. LUCK, EDWARD WHITE, churchwardens.\r\n\r\nBut why sacred to the memory of the dead during “four centuries” only?\r\nHad not those buried previously to 1484 any right to commemoration? The\r\nchurchyard existed in 1378 and the church in 1181. Truly inscription\r\nwriters are marvellous in their discriminating powers. The vault\r\ncontaining the remains is situated alongside the railway line beneath.\r\n\r\nVery interesting discoveries were made when excavating for the station.\r\nMr. E. P. Seaton, the resident engineer, has preserved some careful\r\nnotes, from which the following is an extract: “At the west end of the\r\nchurchyard was found a subway running north and south. The arch was\r\nformed of stone blocks (Kentish rag) placed 3 feet apart, the space\r\nbetween being filled up with brickwork. The sides were of worked red\r\nragstones, 8 by 11 inches, and 3 feet long (some 1 foot 4 inches long),\r\nsurrounded with rough rubble masonry, set in mortar of a brown colour.\r\nThe flat bottom varied from 2 to 4 feet in thickness and was formed of\r\nrandom rubble masonry. The brick invert was of much later date, about 6\r\ninches thick and almost a semicircle. The space between the underside of\r\nthat and the bottom was filled with made earth. A portion of the arch\r\nhad been broken in, and was filled with human bones. The other parts of\r\nthe subway or sewer were filled with hand-packed stones. This is\r\nsupposed to be the centre of the ancient Walbrook (this supposition is\r\nquite correct) and made earth was found to a distance of 35 feet from\r\nthe surface. Clay of a light grey colour was then found, impregnated\r\nwith the decayed roots of water-plants. The foundations (it is a matter\r\nof regret that no plan of the foundations was taken; the opportunity is\r\nnow lost for ever) of the old church of St. John the Baptist, destroyed\r\n1666, and pulled down about 1677, were discovered about 10 to 12 feet\r\nfrom the surface and composed of chalk and Kentish ragstones. They ran\r\nabout north-north-east to south-south-west. Piles of oak were found\r\nwhich seem to denote that the church was built on the edge of the brook,\r\nwhich must have been filled up during the Roman occupation, as numerous\r\npieces of Roman pottery were found.” The bottom of the Walbrook valley\r\nwas reached at 32 feet below the present street level, and is now 11\r\nfeet below the level of the lines in the station. During the excavations\r\nthe piles and sill of the Horseshoe bridge which crossed the Walbrook\r\nhereabouts were also found near the churchyard, together with the\r\nremains of an ancient boat. These were unfortunately too rotten to\r\npreserve, but a block of Roman herring-bone pavement, formerly\r\nconstituting part of a causeway or landing-place on the brook, is now at\r\nthe Guildhall Museum. It was found beneath the churchyard 21 feet below\r\nthe present level of the street, and was presented by the rector and\r\nchurchwardens. Most of the Samian pottery and Roman coins found at this\r\ntime were also presented to the Guildhall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE TALLOW CHANDLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The first charter of incorporation of this Company bears date the\r\n  8th of March 1462, 2 Edward IV., wherein the then members of the\r\n  Company are described as “our beloved and faithful subjects, the\r\n  Freemen of the Mystery or Art of Tallough Chandlers of our City of\r\n  London.”\r\n\r\n  It is evident, however, that a company, guild, or other association\r\n  of tallow chandlers existed in London before the date of the above\r\n  charter, seeing that in the year 1426, or thirty-six years prior\r\n  thereto, Letters Patent were granted by Henry VI. to the mayor of\r\n  the City of London, and the master and wardens of the Mystery or\r\n  Craft of Tallow Chandlers of the same city for the time being,\r\n  empowering them to search for and destroy all bad and adulterated\r\n  oils.\r\n\r\n  Also in the year 1456, or six years prior to the said charter, a\r\n  grant of arms and crest was made by John Smert, Garter King-at-Arms,\r\n  to John Priour, John Thurlow, William Blakeman, and Richard\r\n  Grenecroft, sworn wardens or keepers (gardiens) and several other\r\n  notable men of the trade and of the Company of Tallow Chandlers\r\n  (Chandeliers de Suif) of the City of London, on behalf of and in the\r\n  name of their whole confraternity.\r\n\r\n  At present there is a livery of 102; the Corporate Income was not\r\n  returned to the Commissioners. The Trust Income is £220. Maitland\r\n  says that the Fraternity anciently dealt not only in candles, but\r\n  also in oils, vinegar, butter, hops, soap, etc.\r\n\r\n  Stow designates the hall of the Tallow Chandlers “a proper house.”\r\n  After the Great Fire it was rebuilt (1672). In 1884 a large red\r\n  brick and terra-cotta building of five stories, standing upon a\r\n  granite base, was erected on Dowgate Hill instead, and upon the site\r\n  of the old house of the Company’s clerk and beadle, and the hall is\r\n  now approached by a vestibule running under this building. The\r\n  vestibule leads into an open quadrangle, which was diminished when\r\n  the above-mentioned house was built. It is surrounded by a Tuscan\r\n  piazza of ten arcades. This piazza in part belongs to the 1672\r\n  building. It was restored in 1871. The building itself is of red\r\n  brick. On the first floor is the great hall, a handsome apartment 50\r\n  feet long by 27 feet wide, having a decorated ceiling, and walls\r\n  wainscotted with oak panelling and looking-glass to a height of 30\r\n  feet. On the south wall are three great mirrors; in a broken\r\n  pediment over the central one are the arms of Charles II. At the\r\n  north end is a carved oak screen, in the centre of which are the\r\n  entrance doors, of handsome carved work filled with stained glass,\r\n  erected in 1894. The screen itself is of the 1672 building. A heavy\r\n  carved frieze and cornice passes round the hall above the long\r\n  windows. The pictures include two by Sir Godfrey Kneller. The court\r\n  parlour is the handsomest room. It is wainscotted to the ceiling,\r\n  which is magnificently panelled in oak, and richly gilt, having in\r\n  the centre an oval compartment enclosed by an exquisitely moulded\r\n  wreath of flowers. The rest is divided into squares and oblongs,\r\n  filled with groups of flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\n  An inscription tells us:\r\n\r\n  “This parlour was wainscotted at the expense of Sir Joseph Sheldon,\r\n  Knt., a member of this Company and Lord Mayor of this City A.D.\r\n  1675. Who also gave this Company a barge with all its furniture.”\r\n\r\n  On the second floor is the court-room, which is also wainscotted to\r\n  the ceiling.\r\n\r\nDowgate, the Steelyard, and Cold Harbour were all very near together.\r\nThe Steelyard was so called from the beam of steel by which goods\r\nimported into London were weighed. It stood just where Cannon Street\r\nStation now is. It had a fine hall and courtyard, and was for 300 years\r\nheld by the members of the Hanseatic League, a community of foreigners\r\nwho enjoyed the monopoly of importing hemp, corn, wax, linen and many\r\nother things into England, to the great loss of our own traders. (See\r\n_London in the time of the Tudors_, p. 82.)\r\n\r\nBeyond the station is the City of London Brewery. The archway spanning\r\nthe central entrance to this occupies the site of an earlier arch which\r\nonce carried the choir and steeple of Allhallows the Less, and led to\r\nwhat Stow speaks of as “the great house called Cold Harbrough.” Its site\r\nis now covered by the brewery. The name of the house is conjectured to\r\nbe a corruption of the German words Colner Herberg (Cologne Inn), which\r\npassed into Coln Harbrough, Cole Harbrough, Cold Harbrough, and Cold\r\nHarbour. Cologne being one of the principal of the Hanse towns, the\r\nproximity of the steelyard makes this derivation appear likely. There\r\nare several Cold Harbours in England, none of them remarkable for bleak\r\nsituations, but most of them existing in places where commerce once\r\ngreatly throve. The house stood at the water’s edge. It was a large\r\nbuilding, with steps leading down to the river through an arched door.\r\nAbout the year 1600 it is represented with five gables facing the water,\r\nand rows of mullioned diamond-pane windows—a beautiful building. It had\r\nthe right of sanctuary, though how or when gained is not known.\r\n\r\nUntil 1607 Cold Harbour had been outside the City jurisdiction, for it\r\nis one of the places added to the City’s rule by the charter of James I.\r\nto the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London in that year. It must\r\nhave been deserted by its original inhabitants, the Cologne merchants,\r\nbefore the reign of Edward II. It belonged to the Poultney family, and\r\nwas for some time called Poultney’s Inn.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1397, 21 Richard II., John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, was\r\nlodged there, and Richard II., his brother, dined with him. It was then\r\ncounted a right fair and stately house: but in the next year following\r\nEdmond, Earl of Cambridge, was there lodged, notwithstanding the said\r\nhouse still retained the name of Poultney’s Inn in the reign of Henry\r\nVI., the 26th of his reign” (Stow).\r\n\r\nIn 1410 Henry IV. gave it to Henry, Prince of Wales, for life. Margaret,\r\nCountess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., lodged here temporarily; in\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII., the Bishop of Durham’s house, already\r\nmentioned, “being taken into the King’s hands,” Cuthbert Tunstall,\r\nBishop of Durham, was lodged in “the Cold Harbrough.” This Bishop of\r\nDurham remained here until 1553, when he was deposed from his bishopric\r\nand Cold Harbour was taken from him. It was granted by Edward VI.,\r\ntogether with its appurtenances and six houses or tenements in the\r\nparish of St. Dunstan’s-in-the-East, and certain lands in Yorkshire, to\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury and his heirs. Edward VI. is said to have given\r\nit to the Earl at the instance of the Duke of Northumberland, “who\r\npractised to gain as many of the nobility as he could to his purpose.”\r\nIt then became known as Shrewsbury House. Francis, fifth Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, who died in 1560, and his son, the sixth Earl, the guardian\r\nfor fifteen years of Mary, Queen of Scots, took it down, “and in place\r\nthereof built a great number of small tenements, now letten out for\r\ngreat rents to people of all sorts” (Stow). The Earl died in 1590. The\r\ntenements were destroyed in the Fire of 1666. No remains of the building\r\nexist unless Wren utilised some of the stones in rebuilding Allhallows\r\nthe Great. Hubbard, writing in 1843, says that a foundation wall of the\r\nhouse and the ancient stairs still survived in his time.\r\n\r\nStow calls =The Erber= a “great old house” and says that Geoffrey\r\nScroope held it by gift of Edward III. in 1341. It subsequently belonged\r\nto John Nevil, Earl of Raby, who appears to have died some years prior\r\nto 1396. The last of the honourable family of the Scroopes to possess it\r\nwas William de Scroope, Knt., who lived in the reign of Henry IV. He\r\ngave it for life to his brother Ralph Nevil, Earl of Westmoreland, who\r\nmarried, as his second wife, Joan, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.\r\nRalph Nevil died, seised of the Erber, in 1426, and his wife in 1441.\r\nTheir son Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury, was lodged here in 1547. He\r\ndied in 1460, and the Erber passed to his son Richard, Earl of Warwick\r\nand Salisbury, “the king-maker,” who was slain at the battle of Barnet\r\nField in 1471. In 1474, George, Duke of Clarence, who had married\r\nIsabel, daughter of “the king-maker,” then received it from Edward IV.\r\nwho gave it to him and his heirs so long as there was living male issue\r\nof the Marquis Montacute. If the said male issue should die during the\r\nduke’s life, then the duke to remain seised for life, taking precedence\r\nof the rights of all others than the marquis and his issue. The Duke of\r\nClarence died in 1479. After his death, Edward, his son, was seised of\r\nthe Erber, and George, Duke of Bedford, son of John Nevil, Marquis\r\nMontacute, dying without male issue in 1483, the lands remained in the\r\nhands of Edward till 1500, when he was attainted and the lands thus came\r\nto the Crown. Here they remained until 1512, when Henry VIII. gave them\r\nto John, Earl of Oxford, and his heirs male. In 1513 the King gave the\r\nreversion to Sir Thomas Bulleyn, Knt., and his male heirs. In 1514 he\r\nrestored Margaret, daughter and heir to George, Duke of Clarence, and to\r\nall the lands of Richard, Earl of Salisbury, “who by colour of\r\nrestitution entered, and was attainted in 1540. So the lands came back\r\nto the Crown, and were given in the next year to Sir Philip Hoby, who in\r\n1545 sold the Erber to one Doulphin, a draper, who in 1553 sold it to\r\nthe Drapers Company. Strype, who gives these particulars, says that\r\nnotwithstanding this account “by some lawyers and historians in those\r\ndays,” it appears by the Rolls (1405) that there was a surrender of the\r\nErber from Ralph, Earl of Westmoreland, to the King for the use of John\r\nDarrel, and Walter de Arkham; that Richard III. possessed it under the\r\nname of “The King’s Palace,” and that one Ralph Dowel, a yeoman of the\r\nCrown, was keeper of this place. Dowel seems to have repaired not only\r\nthe Erber, but also other houses belonging to it, “particularly a\r\nbrewhouse called the Chequer,” as appears by a ledger-book of the King’s\r\nin which the accounts of Dowel are said to be examined by John Hewyk,\r\none of the King’s auditors. Orders were given to Lethington, bailiff of\r\nthe lordship of the Clavering in Essex, “to content him,” but £14 : 18 :\r\n3 still remained in arrears due to him for the repairs. Stow says that\r\nthe Erber had been lately rebuilt by Sir Thomas Pullison, and that it\r\nwas afterwards inhabited by Sir Thomas Drake.\r\n\r\n  =St. Mary Bothaw= was situated on the east side of Turnwheele Lane,\r\n  Cannon Street. The date of foundation is unknown. Newcourt mentions\r\n  Adam Lambyn as a rector, who died 1279. In the Taxation Book of Pope\r\n  Nicholas IV., 1291, the church occurs as Sancte Marie de Bothaw. It\r\n  was destroyed by the Great Fire, but not rebuilt, its parish being\r\n  annexed to that of St. Swithin. Stow supposes, for want of a better\r\n  theory, that “this church being near unto the Down-Gate in the river\r\n  of Thames, hath the addition of Bothaw, or Boat Haw, of near\r\n  adjoining to a haw or yard, wherein of old time boats were made, and\r\n  landed from Downgate to be mended.” Strype mentions that it seems\r\n  “of old to be called St. Mary de Bothache,” and Mr. Loftie in his\r\n  _London City_ (1891) says that the name is “most likely from ‘la\r\n  board hatch,’ a wooden gate-lock called also in some ancient\r\n  documents ‘Board-Hatch.’” The map by Agas _c._ 1560, and Hollar’s\r\n  view of London, call the church St. Mary Buttolph Lane. It is\r\n  somewhat remarkable that Dowgate is almost the only one of the older\r\n  City gates which has no Church of St. Botolph near by, as at\r\n  Billingsgate, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, and Aldersgate. The term St.\r\n  Mary Bothol occurs more than once in records of the sixteenth\r\n  century. Can it be that the name bears witness to the existence of a\r\n  St. Botolph’s Church here, which was dedicated to the Virgin, with\r\n  the name Botolph attached as a remembrance of the former\r\n  appellation? The earliest date of an incumbent is 1281.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, before 1281; the Dean and\r\n  Chapter of Canterbury from 1552 up to the time it was annexed to St.\r\n  Swithin in 1666.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 182.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Lady Joan Fastolf, to which Robert\r\n  Kirke was instituted, May 10, 1445; by and for John, son of Adam de\r\n  Salusbury, who endowed it with a tenement called the “Key” in\r\n  Coleman Street, which fetched £7 in 1548; by and for John Hamond,\r\n  before 1387; by James le Butler; by Hugh Fostall.\r\n\r\n  Many noble persons were buried here, as appeared from the arms in\r\n  the windows, the defaced tombs, and print of plates torn up and\r\n  carried away. The most remarkable, perhaps, was that of Sir Henry\r\n  Fitz-Alwine, draper, the first Lord Mayor of London, who continued\r\n  in his position for twenty-four years. Here, too, Robert Chicheley,\r\n  grocer and mayor of London in 1422, was buried; he appointed by his\r\n  will that 2400 poor men should each have a good dinner on his\r\n  birthday, and he also gave a plot of land for the building of the\r\n  parish church, called St. Stephen’s, Walbrook.\r\n\r\n  No charitable gifts are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\nAt the construction of Cannon Street station and hotel, in 1866-68, the\r\nchurchyard was built over. Its site is now immediately under the steps\r\nleading from the hotel to the forecourt, and is occupied by part of a\r\ncorridor, a carpenter’s shop, a knife-cleaning room, and a coal cellar,\r\nall of which belong to the hotel basement.\r\n\r\nThe north-western side of the station forecourt stands upon the site of\r\n=Turnwheele Lane=, a narrow turning which formerly led from Cannon\r\nStreet by a westerly slope into Dowgate Hill, which it joined opposite\r\nthe northern boundary of Skinners’ Hall. Stow calls it “a little lane\r\nwith a turnpike in the middle thereof.” Strype (1720) terms it\r\nTurnwheele Lane, but the _New Remarks of London_ (1732) style it\r\nTurnmill Lane. By the eastern side of the station runs Allhallows Lane\r\nleading northward into Bush Lane. The church of Allhallows the Great\r\nstood here until 1898, and east of it was Allhallows the Less.\r\n\r\n  =Allhallows the Great= was situated on the south side of\r\n  Thames Street. This church has been known, at various times,\r\n  as All Saints, Allhallows-ad-foenum, Allhallows-in-the-Hay,\r\n  Allhallows-in-the-Ropery (“because,” says Stow, “of hay sold\r\n  thereunto at Hay Wharf, and ropes of old time made and sold in\r\n  the high street”), Allhallows the More (“for a difference from\r\n  Allhallows the Less”), Allhallows the Great, which has been\r\n  the name at least since the Fire. Of its first foundation\r\n  there is no record, but from the fact that the riverside is\r\n  the oldest inhabited part of the City it may be nearly coeval\r\n  with the establishment of Christianity in London. The first\r\n  actual mention of it is in 1361 when, according to Newcourt,\r\n  one Thomas de Wodeford was rector. In 1627 and 1629 it was\r\n  repaired and redecorated, and a gallery built at the west end,\r\n  but the whole was destroyed by the Great Fire. In 1683 it was\r\n  rebuilt, the architect being Wren, and Allhallows the Less,\r\n  its neighbour, united with it by Act of Parliament. In 1877\r\n  the tower and north aisle were taken down to widen Thames\r\n  Street. The church was taken down in 1898. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1279.\r\n\r\n  The patronage was in the hands of the family of Le Despensers before\r\n  1314; Richard Beauchamp; Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick and\r\n  Salisbury, 1465; George, Duke of Clarence, before 1480; Edward,\r\n  eldest son of Isabel, Duchess of Clarence, 1480; Edward IV.; Henry\r\n  VII., as a gift from Anne, widow of Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick\r\n  and Salisbury; Henry VIII.; the Archbishop of Canterbury, by\r\n  exchange, 1569, in whose successors it continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 550.\r\n\r\n  There was a large cloister originally on the south side of the\r\n  church, but it was in a considerable state of ruin in 1627.\r\n\r\n  The plan was nominally an oblong square, but, owing probably to the\r\n  desire of Wren to make use of the old foundations, its walls were\r\n  neither built parallel nor four-square. The length was 87 feet, the\r\n  height 33 feet, and the width 60 feet, of which the nave was made 48\r\n  feet wide and a north aisle 12 feet wide. To the north aisle was\r\n  also attached a heavy square tower, occupying a portion of the\r\n  aisle. The elevation was finished with a cornice and parapet. The\r\n  tower rose above the second division from the east to a height of 86\r\n  feet. The church was celebrated for its beautiful woodwork, which,\r\n  on its demolition, was removed to St. Michael Royal.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Richard de Preston, citizen and\r\n  grocer, at the Altar of St. Katherine, for himself and Agnes his\r\n  wife, and to which Alfred Lyndon was admitted chaplain in 1396;\r\n  Peter Cosin whose will is dated 1291 (Pat. 43 Edward III. p. 2 m.\r\n  12); Sir Nicholas Lovin for himself and dame Margaret his wife;\r\n  William Lichfield, augmented by Thomas Westhowe, both of which\r\n  endowments fetched £8 : 16 : 8 in 1548; and William Peston.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained monuments to: William Lichfield,\r\n  Doctor of Divinity; John Brickles, a great benefactor. Queen\r\n  Elizabeth’s monument, “If Royal Vertues, etc.,” was also in this\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  Two charity schools were erected in 1715, consisting of thirty boys\r\n  and twenty girls supported by voluntary subscriptions from the\r\n  inhabitants of the ward.\r\n\r\n  Among the notable rectors of this church are: Thomas White\r\n  (1628-98), Bishop of Peterborough; Hon. James York, Bishop of Ely,\r\n  1781; Robert Richardson, D.D. (1732-81), Dean of Lincoln; Edward\r\n  Waddington (d. 1731), Bishop of Chichester; William Vincent\r\n  (1739-1815), Dean of Westminster; William Cave, author (1637-1713).\r\n\r\nIn 1877 a new vestry was built on the south side of the church. It is\r\napproached from Allhallows Lane by steps, through an arched doorway,\r\nabove which stands what is called “the tower,” a mean erection and a\r\nmere apology for a tower. Its height does not extend beyond the church\r\nroof. The vestry is fitted with the panelling and the pedimented doorway\r\nbrought from the old north aisle, from which also come the two\r\nfantastically and beautifully carved wooden shields, now placed\r\nrespectively over the fireplace and the door. The ceiling is a neat\r\npiece of panelling. The room is used for the holding of the Dowgate\r\nwardmotes. The churchyard (south of the church) is much higher than the\r\nlane at its side. It contains one tree, several tombs, and in the\r\nnorth-west corner the vestry-room. The enclosure remains an open space\r\neven after the demolition of the church.\r\n\r\nAllhallows Church was dismantled in 1894. The screen, the pulpit, the\r\naltar rails, the brass candelabra, and some of the woodwork went to St.\r\nMargaret, Lothbury; the organ case, the font rails, the statues of Moses\r\nand Aaron, most of the carved woodwork, the monuments, and the\r\nstained-glass arms of Bishop Waddington went to St. Michael, Paternoster\r\nRoyal. The carved-wood altar was allotted to the new Church of\r\nAllhallows, North St. Pancras, which was to be erected partially from\r\nthe funds arising out of the sale. The clock by Ericke was bought by a\r\ngentleman connected with the City of London Brewery, where it now\r\nstands. The site and the materials of the fabric were sold by auction on\r\nJuly 31, 1894, for £31,100.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ALLHALLOWS THE LESS\r\n\r\n  Allhallows the Less was situated on the south side of Thames Street,\r\n  to the east of Allhallows the Great; it was called by some\r\n  Allhallows-on-the-Cellars, from its standing on vaults. It is said\r\n  to have been built by Sir John Poultney. After the Great Fire the\r\n  church was not rebuilt and the parish was annexed to Allhallows the\r\n  Great. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1242.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Bishops of\r\n  Winchester in 1242; master and chaplains of Corpus Christi College,\r\n  Candlewick Street.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 200.\r\n\r\n  The steeple and choir of this church stood on an arched gate, which\r\n  was the entry to a great house called Cold Harbour. Dormers were\r\n  made on the south side of the church in 1613 to lighten it, and\r\n  several galleries subsequently added.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by James Andrew, the endowment of which\r\n  fetched £8 : 9 : 4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The donors of charities to this church were: Elizabeth Bannister,\r\n  £5; Anne Hope, £5; Roger Daniel, £8; and Samuel Goldsmith, £6, paid\r\n  by the Company of Dyers.\r\n\r\n  Two charity schools were erected in 1715 consisting of thirty boys\r\n  and twenty-eight girls supported by voluntary contributions from the\r\n  inhabitants of the ward.\r\n\r\n=Cannon Street= was formerly Candlewick Street. It was part of the\r\nancient Roman highway that ran through the City and was once called\r\nWatling Street throughout its whole length. Many deeds are extant\r\nrelating to Candlewick Street.\r\n\r\nRoman remains have been found in Cannon Street including tessellated\r\npavements and a bronze statuette of Hercules.\r\n\r\nIn 1369 mention is made of the “Yeldehalle” in Candlewick Street,\r\nprobably the “Hula Dacorum,” Hall of the Danes mentioned in the _Liber\r\nAlbus_, where we learn that it was occupied by the Cologne merchants and\r\nperhaps by those of Dinant also. The building was probably the “Great\r\nstone Binn” called “Olde Hall” mentioned by Stow.\r\n\r\nOne of the Caxton family, of whom there were so many in the City, named\r\nWilliam de Caxton, lived here in 1342, and left to the Rector of St.\r\nSwithin his mansion in this street for the maintenance of a chantry.\r\n\r\nThe _Calendar of Wills_ proves that we are in the most populous and\r\nancient part of London. Between 1259 and 1350 there are more than fifty\r\nreferences to Candlewyke Street. The place is famous for its weavers,\r\nand especially for the coarse cloth they made here called “burel.” There\r\nwas a fraternity of the “Burellers” working here. In 1334 one hundred\r\nfoot-soldiers were provided with “gowns” of cloth made in Candlewyke\r\nStreet. There was also a petition drawn up by the “good-folk” of this\r\nstreet and Clement’s Lane against the melting of lead in their midst.\r\n\r\nFrom Eastcheap to Walbrook, the title was for many centuries Candlewick,\r\nCandlewright, or Canewyke Street. “Candelwykestrete” is mentioned in the\r\nCity Records as early as 1308; “Canewykestrete” appears 1376-99, and\r\nagain as “Cainwicke St.” in the map of Ralph Agas c. 1560. Stow gives\r\nthree possible derivations: (1) From Candlewright, a maker of candles;\r\n(2) from the yarn or cotton candle-wick; (3) from candle-wike, a “wike”\r\nbeing a place where things are made. The proximity of Tallow Chandlers’\r\nHall in Dowgate Hill points to this as the candlemakers’ quarter of the\r\nCity, and favours the first and third theories rather than the second.\r\nIn Ryther’s map of London, 1604, it is styled “Conning Streete,”\r\n(probably a misprint for Canning Street), and Newcourt in his 1658 map\r\nof London calls it “Cannon Street,” so that the change from Candlewick\r\nto Canwyke, Conning, and Cannon appears to have taken place within a\r\ncomparatively short space of time.\r\n\r\nThe weavers of woollen cloths, brought from Flanders by Edward III.,\r\nprobably dwelt here: “cloth of Candelwykestrete” is mentioned in City\r\nrecords in 1334; and Stow says that these weavers obtained permission in\r\n1371 to meet in the churchyard of St. Lawrence Pountney close by. They\r\nappear not to have remained long in the neighbourhood, but their advent\r\nled to a settlement of many drapers in this part of the City and\r\nultimately to the founding of the Drapers’ Hall in St. Swithin’s Lane.\r\nIn Stow’s time the street was “possessed by rich drapers, sellers of\r\nwoollen cloth, etc.” After the Great Fire the street, Strype says, was\r\n“well built and inhabited by good tradesmen.”\r\n\r\nThere are two churches in the street, which is now extended to the\r\nsouth-east corner of St. Paul’s, sweeping away Distaff Lane, Basing\r\nLane, Little St. Thomas Apostle, and a bit of Budge Row. London Stone is\r\nin this street. Beside London Stone Henry Fitz Ailwyn or Alwyne, first\r\nmayor of London, had his residence. Here lived the Earl of Oxford, who,\r\nabout the year 1540, according to Stow, rode to his house with eighty\r\ngentlemen in “livery of Reading tawny,” and chains of gold about their\r\nnecks and “one hundred tall yeomen in the like livery to follow him\r\nwithout chains, but all having his cognizance of the blue boar\r\nintroduced on their left shoulders.” This retinue was discountenanced by\r\nthe Tudors and fell into disuse. Perhaps this earl was the last to\r\nmaintain so great a following.\r\n\r\nLondon Stone was probably the pillar set up in the Roman fort to mark\r\nthe _milliarium_, the beginning of mile.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed this stone to be the remains of a British druidical\r\ncircle or religious monument. Strype quotes Owen of Shrewsbury as giving\r\nrise to this view by his assertion that “the Druids had pillars of stone\r\nin veneration, which custom they borrowed from the Greeks, who, as\r\nPausanius writeth, adored rude and unpolished stones.” Malcolm suggests\r\nthat, if it is of British origin, “policy may have induced the Romans to\r\npreserve it, as a relic highly valued by the Londoners, or as the\r\nmonument of some great event.” The general opinion, since Camden’s time,\r\nseems to be that the stone is of Roman origin, but its first purpose\r\nstill remains uncertain. Stow notes that some considered it to have been\r\nset “as a mark in the middle of the City within the wall; but, in truth,\r\nit standeth far nearer to the river of Thames than to the wall of the\r\nCity.” He says, also, that others thought it was set for the payment of\r\ndebts, on appointed days, “till, of later times, payments were most\r\nusually made at the font in Pont’s Church (St. Paul’s), and now most\r\ncommonly at the Royal Exchange.”\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Wren was of opinion that “by reason of its large\r\nfoundation, it was rather some more considerable monument in the Forum;\r\nfor, in the adjoining ground to the south, upon digging for cellars\r\nafter the Great Fire, were discovered some tessellated pavements, and\r\nother extensive remains of Roman workmanship and buildings.” Originally,\r\nno doubt, the erection was of considerable proportions, and a suggestion\r\nis made in the _Parentalia_ that this milliarium was not in the form of\r\na pillar as at Rome, but probably resembled that at Constantinople,\r\nwhich must have been a large building “for under its roof, according to\r\nCedrenus, and Seidas, stood statues of Constantine and Helena, Trajan,\r\nan equestrian statue of Hadrian, a statue of Fortune, and many other\r\nfigures and decorations.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CANNON STREET, LOOKING WEST\r\n]\r\n\r\nStrype considers it likely that this stone was, in after days, the place\r\nfrom which proclamations and public notices were made. This is confirmed\r\nin _Pasquill and Marforius_ (1589): “Set up this bill at London Stone.\r\nLet it be done solemnly with drom and trumpet.” Malcolm considers that\r\nit was certainly regarded for some ages as “a rallying point for the\r\ncitizens in times of insurrection, as Guildhall would now be.” At any\r\nrate, when in 1540 Jack Cade, “the Kentish rebel, who feigned himself to\r\nbe Lord Mortimer,” forced his way into the City from Southwark, he\r\nmarched to London Stone, where he found a great concourse of citizens,\r\nthe Lord Mayor being among them. Here, according to Holinshed’s account,\r\nhe struck his sword upon the stone, exclaiming, “Now is Mortimer Lord of\r\nthis City,” as if, Pennant remarks, “that had been a customary ceremony\r\nof taking possession.” This scene occurs in the second part of _Henry\r\nIV._, Act iv. Sc. 6, where Shakespeare makes Cade enter Cannon Street\r\nwith his followers, and strike the stone with his _staff_ instead of his\r\n_sword_. To quote Fabian, “Rome, Carthage, and Jerusalem have been caste\r\ndowne” with many other “cytyes,” yet\r\n\r\n                   Thys, so oldely founded,\r\n                   Is so surely grounded,\r\n                   That no man may confounde yt,\r\n                             It is so sure a stone\r\n                   That yt is upon sette,\r\n                   For though some have it thrette\r\n                   With Manasses grym and great,\r\n                             Yt hurt hath it none:\r\n                   Chryste is the very stone\r\n                   That the Citie is set upon:\r\n                   Which from all his foon\r\n                             Hath ever preserved it.\r\n                   By means of dyvyne servyce\r\n                   That incontinuall wyse\r\n                   Is kept in devout guyse\r\n                   Within the mure of it.\r\n\r\nHowever great the stone may have been in the beginning, the ravages and\r\nfires of London could have left but little of the original remaining in\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire its foundations were disclosed by Wren: no doubt a\r\ncertain part of its upper end had been destroyed in the flames and\r\npossibly damaged in clearing away debris, but at all events a small\r\nportion of it, in shape somewhat like a cannon ball, was saved, says\r\nStrype, and placed within “a new stone handsomely wrought, cut hollow\r\nunderneath, so as the old stone may be seen, the new stone being over it\r\nto shelter and deface the venerable one.” Strype’s map shows that the\r\nstone, in its new case, was at first re-erected on the old site on the\r\nsouth side of the street. On December 13, 1742, it was complained of as\r\nan obstruction, and was removed by order of the churchwardens of St.\r\nSwithin, at a cost of 12s., to the opposite of the “kerbstone” on the\r\nnorth side of the street. By kerbstone is here meant the stone\r\nprotecting the foot of the buildings and not (as now) a stone protecting\r\na pavement. At the beginning of 1798 the church was about to undergo a\r\ncomplete repair, and the historic stone was actually doomed to be\r\nremoved as a nuisance. Fortunately Mr. Thomas Maiden, a printer of\r\nSherborne Lane, championed the cause, and prevailed on one of the parish\r\nofficers to preserve it and to have it replaced against the church wall.\r\nThe enclosing stone, “somewhat like a Roman altar,” had formerly a\r\ncurved bar of iron projecting across the elliptical aperture through\r\nwhich the relic is seen; but the present grill was placed over the front\r\nof the case in 1869, when the present inscription, in English and Latin,\r\nwas cut in the wall of the church over the stone at the instance of a\r\nCommittee consisting of members of the London and Middlesex\r\nArchæological Society, and the parish officers. At the same time a\r\ncareful examination of the stone itself was made. It was found to\r\nmeasure about a foot cube, and that instead of being basaltic, capable\r\nof giving off sparks when struck by steel, it was in reality an oolite,\r\nsuch as the Romans used extensively in their buildings, and sometimes\r\nfor coffins and sepulchral monuments, thus corroborating the idea of its\r\nRoman origin.\r\n\r\nIn Cannon Street is the Cordwainers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CORDWAINERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Allutarii or Cordwainers appear to have been voluntarily\r\n  associated together as a craft or mystery from very remote times,\r\n  probably as early as the Conquest, in close connection with the\r\n  municipality of London. Its object was to encourage and regulate the\r\n  trades connected with the leather industry, and included the\r\n  flaying, tanning, and currying of hides, and also the manufacture\r\n  and sale of shoes, boots, goloshes, and other articles of leather.\r\n  In the thirteenth and following centuries several branches separated\r\n  and formed distinct communities, such as the girdlers, tanners,\r\n  curriers, and leather sellers.\r\n\r\n  The first existing Ordinance of the Cordwainers (Allutarii) is found\r\n  in _Liber Horn_, folio 339, and was made in the 56th year of King\r\n  Henry III., Anno Domini 1272.\r\n\r\n  The Company was originally called the “Allutarii,” and became first\r\n  connected with the “Coblers” in the 14th century. Maitland explains\r\n  that the Cobler was not only the maker but the vendor of boots and\r\n  shoes. As people in cold countries always wanted shoes, the Guild or\r\n  Fraternity of shoemakers was certainly ancient. In 1375 the\r\n  “reputable” Cordwainers submitted their ordinances to the mayor. In\r\n  1378 we learn that “discreet” men of the trade had authority to\r\n  seize hides badly tanned. In 1395 the Cordwainers and the\r\n  Coblers—_i.e._ the workers in new and old shoes—adjusted their\r\n  differences, but that in 1409 the dissensions between them broke out\r\n  again and were once more composed. In 1387 three journeymen\r\n  cordwainers were haled before the mayor, charged with illegally\r\n  forming a Fraternity of themselves excluding the masters. Another\r\n  indication of the existence of an ancient Fraternity is that of the\r\n  brawling and fighting in 1304 of the cordwainers and the tailors.\r\n\r\n  The first charter of incorporation was granted by King Henry VI.\r\n  1439, whereby, in consideration of the payment of fifty marks, he\r\n  granted to the freemen of the Mysterie of Cordwainers (Allutariorum)\r\n  of the City of London that they should be one body or commonalty for\r\n  ever, that they should every year elect and make of themselves one\r\n  master and four wardens to rule and govern the said mysterie, and\r\n  all men and workers of the mysterie and commonalty, and all workmen\r\n  and workers whatsoever of tanned leather relating to the said\r\n  mysterie, to search and try black and red tanned leather and all new\r\n  shoes which should be sold or exposed for sale, as well within the\r\n  said City as without, within two miles thereof.\r\n\r\n  The above charter was exemplified and confirmed by the charter 4 and\r\n  5 Philip and Mary (June 17, 1557).\r\n\r\n  The charter or Letters Patent of Queen Elizabeth, dated August 24,\r\n  in the fourth year of Her Majesty’s reign (A.D. 1562), exemplifies\r\n  and confirms the exemplification of Philip and Mary.\r\n\r\n  The charter further grants to them the government of all persons\r\n  exercising the said trade within the City of London and three miles\r\n  round about the said City and suburbs, the privilege having\r\n  previously run only to two miles. Also the power of making bylaws\r\n  for such purpose is thereby given to the master, wardens,\r\n  assistants, and commonalty.\r\n\r\n  King James I., in the tenth year of his reign, granted another\r\n  charter to the Company.\r\n\r\n  A new charter was granted by King James II. in the first year of his\r\n  reign, but it would appear that this charter was afterwards annulled\r\n  by Act 2 William and Mary, cap. 9; but this same Act restored and\r\n  confirmed all previous charters.\r\n\r\n  The first Hall was burned in the Great Fire: it stood in Great\r\n  Distaff Street; since this street was swallowed up by Cannon Street,\r\n  the Hall, rebuilt after the Fire, and again in 1788, and greatly\r\n  altered since then, has now a frontage in Cannon Street.\r\n\r\n  The livery is now 100; the Corporate Income is £7700; the Trust\r\n  Income £1600.\r\n\r\n  Of the cordwainers, Stow speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n  “In this Distar Lane, on the north side thereof, is the\r\n  Cordwainers’, or Shoemakers’ hall, which company were made a\r\n  brotherhood or fraternity, in the 11th of Henry IV. Of these\r\n  cordwainers I read, that since the 5th of Richard II. (when he took\r\n  to wife Anne, daughter of Vesalaus, King of Boheme), by her example,\r\n  the English people had used piked shoes, tied to their knees with\r\n  silken laces, or chains of silver or gilt, wherefore in the 4th of\r\n  Edward IV. it was ordained and proclaimed, that beaks of shoone and\r\n  boots should not pass the length of two inches, upon pain of cursing\r\n  by the clergy, and by parliament to pay twenty shillings for every\r\n  pair. And every cordwainer that shod any man or woman on the Sunday\r\n  to pay thirty shillings.”\r\n\r\nSuffolk House, in =Suffolk Lane=, stands upon the site of the old\r\nMerchant Taylors’ School, and hence also upon the site of the =Manor of\r\nthe Rose=.\r\n\r\nThis was a famous mansion once called Poultney’s Inn, from Sir John\r\nPoultney, who dwelt here after his removal from Cold Harbour. This was\r\nprobably in 1348, for in that year (the year after he founded his\r\ncollege of Corpus Christi, by the church of St. Lawrence Poultney (or\r\nPountney) on Lawrence Poultney Hill) he gave the Cold Harbour to the\r\nEarl of Hereford and Essex, for “one Rose at Midsummer, to him and his\r\nheirs for all services, if the same were demanded” (Stow). It seems most\r\nprobable that this light “service” is accountable for the name of the\r\nManor of the Rose. Subsequently the Manor belonged to John Holland, Duke\r\nof Exeter, then to William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, attainted and\r\nbeheaded 1450. His son John, made Duke of Suffolk in 1463, does not\r\nappear to have possessed it, but his son John, Earl of Lincoln, owned it\r\nat the time of his attainder in 1487. It remained with the Crown until\r\n1495, when it was restored to Edmund de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, on\r\nwhose forfeiture of it by treason it was granted in 1506 to Edward\r\nStafford, Duke of Buckingham, who kept possession of it until he was\r\nattainted and beheaded in 1521. Shakespeare (_Henry VIII._, Act i. Sc.\r\n2) alludes to “The Rose within the parish of St. Lawrence Poultney,” in\r\nconnection with the Duke of Buckingham. After remaining with the Crown\r\nfor about four years it was granted in 1526 to Henry Courtenay, Earl of\r\nDevon, who had recently been created Marquis of Exeter. He was beheaded\r\nin 1539, when the property again fell to the Crown. In 1540 it was\r\ngranted to Robert Radcliffe, Lord Fitzwalter, Earl of Sussex, whose son\r\nand grandson held it in turn. In 1560-61 it was sold and shortly after\r\ndivided into moieties, of which one part was afterwards sold for the use\r\nof the Merchant Taylors’ School. All that remained intact of the mansion\r\nperished in the Fire of 1666, except a few portions of which the chief\r\nwere a wall in Ducksfoot Lane, and a crypt extending from Suffolk Lane\r\nto Lawrence Poultney Hill. At the rebuilding of the City, No. 3 Lawrence\r\nPoultney Hill stood over this crypt, which remained until that house was\r\npulled down in 1894, when, despite the protests of the antiquarians, the\r\ncrypt was ruthlessly destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OLD MERCHANT TAYLORS’ SCHOOL, SUFFOLK LANE, CANNON STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire the school was rebuilt on the old site, in 1675, the\r\nhead-master’s house being erected adjoining it.\r\n\r\nThe school premises were enlarged at various times, especially in 1829.\r\nIn 1875 they became too small for the requirements of the school, and\r\nthe old Charterhouse School having been removed to Godalming, the\r\nCharterhouse site was bought by the Merchant Taylors Company for\r\n£90,000, and Merchant Taylors’ School was moved to its present quarters.\r\nThe old premises were taken down, and Suffolk House was erected in part\r\nupon their site in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe pious Robert Nelson, author of the _Fasts and Festivals_, was born\r\nin Suffolk Lane, June 22, 1656. His father, John Nelson, was a wealthy\r\ntrader to the Levant.\r\n\r\nStrype calls =Ducksfoot Lane= Duxford. The name is, perhaps, a\r\ncorruption of Duke’s Footmen’s Lane, tradition asserting that this lane\r\ncontained the servants’ entrance to the Duke of Suffolk’s house, the\r\nManor of the Rose. In that case “footmen” is equivalent to retainers, or\r\nmen-at-arms, whose quarters would probably be at the back of the\r\nmansion. Wilson (_History of St. Lawrence Poultney_) thinks it was once\r\ncalled Duke’s-foot-lane, meaning a narrow way to the mansion.\r\n\r\nThe only old house in the Lane is No. 2, which possesses a very\r\ninteresting interior. The building is now used for offices, but was\r\noriginally a merchant’s residence. The old dining-room is a fine\r\nchamber, having panelled walls profusely decorated with florid designs\r\nin raised composition. The panel over the chimney-piece is particularly\r\ngood. The entablature of the handsome mantel is supported by fluted\r\nIonic pilasters, the frieze filled with flowers and fruit, and the\r\nkeystone embellished with a curious rural scene. There are several other\r\nquaint mantels in the house, one being of coloured marbles exquisitely\r\npainted with figures and scenes. The great staircase with its\r\nwainscotted walls and fine balusters is a good piece of work. The\r\ncellars are very extensive, and there are traces of a subterranean\r\npassage which formerly led to the Thames. The staircase and the old\r\ndining-room were copied by Mr. John Hare, and staged at the Garrick\r\nTheatre for Mr. Pinero’s play _The Profligate_, first performed in 1889.\r\n\r\n=Laurence Pountney Hill.=—Stow calls this hill St. Laurence Hill. The\r\npart from Cannon Street to Suffolk Lane was formerly Green Lettice Lane,\r\nbut was renamed under the present title only, on the widening of Cannon\r\nStreet, 1853-54. The two houses at the corner of Suffolk Lane are\r\nsplendid specimens of early eighteenth-century architecture. Both are\r\nfinished with a handsome cornice. The doorways of both are side by side\r\nand have lintels and architraves of such rich carving as to be\r\nunsurpassed in the City by any doorways of similar size and style. The\r\nlintels are both concave: that on the southern house contains garlands\r\nof flowers, a cherub’s head, and the date 1703, that on the northern\r\nconsists of a large scallop shell having in it two naked children. The\r\nstaircase in the northern house, with its fine twisted balusters, is one\r\nof the best original staircases left in the City. The southern house has\r\nbeen modernised for business premises and spoiled. Next below is a plot\r\nrecently bared, where was the vault alluded to under Suffolk Lane.\r\n\r\nAt the north-east corner of Ducksfoot Lane is an old house, a good\r\nspecimen of the domestic architecture after the Fire. Next to it\r\neastwards is the southern half of St. Lawrence Pountney Churchyard now\r\ndisused. It contains three trees and several tombs. In summer a\r\nlarge-leafed plant covers almost the whole area. Across the enclosure is\r\nanother fine old house, now used for offices, containing handsome rooms\r\nand a fine balustered well-staircase.\r\n\r\nDr. William Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, came\r\nto live with his brother Eliab opposite St. Lawrence Pountney Church,\r\nafter the surrender of Oxford. Both Eliab and another brother Daniel\r\nwere rich and distinguished merchants on the hill. Richard Glover, the\r\nauthor of _Leonidas_, was also an eminent merchant on this hill.\r\n\r\nThe character of Laurence Pountney Lane on both sides (except the modern\r\nwarehouses on the east side at the corner of Upper Thames Street) is\r\nthat of the rebuilding after the Fire. Perhaps as a whole this lane\r\npreserves this character better than any other thoroughfare in the ward.\r\nAt the Upper Thames Street end, on the west side, is a house which,\r\nthough rebuilt on the Upper Thames Street front, retains the old side\r\nwall. This is still pierced with narrow windows filled with little\r\nsquares of glass in lead-work. On the same side of the lane are several\r\ncarved lintels, and well-panelled deeply recessed doorways. Near the\r\nlower end is an old house beneath which is an archway leading to a\r\ncourtyard, cellars, and offices. The house is partly tenanted by Messrs.\r\nCooper, Box & Co., who first made beaver hats here in 1830 or\r\nthereabouts. The back part at the end of the yard, and the front windows\r\nwere added about 1855. The cellars at the rear of the yard used to\r\ncontain the vats in which the beaver hats were dyed. The lease of the\r\nhouse dating from shortly after the Fire is still in existence. In the\r\nyard is an arched doorway of stone, and solid arches of the same\r\nmaterial support the walls of the house in the basement cellars. The\r\nstone no doubt came out of the ruins of buildings destroyed in the Fire;\r\npossibly some of it from the Manor of the Rose.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1543 Master Arundel kept a house of entertainment in\r\nthis lane, much resorted to by the gay young men of that time. Henry,\r\nEarl of Surrey, the poet, was summoned before the Privy Council to\r\nanswer certain charges, when Mistress Arundel, being examined, said that\r\nthe Earl of Surrey and other young noblemen frequented her house. They\r\nate meat in Lent and committed other improprieties. At Candlemas they\r\nwent out at 9 o’clock at night, with stone bows, and did not return till\r\npast midnight; and next day there was a great clamour of breaking of\r\nwindows, both of houses and churches, and shouting at men in the street,\r\nand the voice was that those hurts were done by my lord and his company.\r\nAgain at night, rowing on the Thames, they used these stone bows to\r\nshoot, as she was told, “at the queens on the Bankside” (MS. quoted by\r\nFroude, vol. iv. p. 253).\r\n\r\n  =St. Lawrence Poultney= or =Pountney= was situated on the west side\r\n  of Laurence Pountney Lane, between Cannon Street and Thames Street\r\n  in the Ward of Candlewick Street. Thomas Cole added to it a chapel\r\n  of Jesus, for a master and a chaplain, and this together with the\r\n  parish church was made into a college by John Poultney and confirmed\r\n  by Edward III. At the suppression of the religious houses it was\r\n  valued at £97 : 17 : 11 and surrendered in the reign of Edward VI.\r\n  The church was burnt down by the Great Fire and its parish annexed\r\n  to that of St. Mary Abchurch. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1318.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The chaplains of\r\n  this college; Henry VIII., who seized it and so continued in the\r\n  Crown till Queen Elizabeth granted it to Edward Dorening and Roger\r\n  Rant as an appendage of the manor of East Greenwich.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 270.\r\n\r\n  No benefactors are recorded by Stow. There are few monuments\r\n  recorded, and those of little note: John Oliffe, alderman, was\r\n  buried in the church in 1577; also Robert and Henry Radcliffe, Earls\r\n  of Sussex.\r\n\r\n  William Latymer was master of this college; he was prosecuted for\r\n  complaining with John Hooper, of Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London.\r\n\r\nIn Martin’s Lane a high tower resembling the steeple of a church\r\nprojects at the end of a block of modern buildings. The old clock, which\r\nis attached and hangs out over the street, makes the resemblance to a\r\nchurch more noticeable. The building was erected on the site of the old\r\nchurch of St. Martin Orgar. The churchyard below is comparatively large\r\nand includes a row of trees. It is considerably above the level of the\r\nstreet. At the east end are some old seventeenth or eighteenth century\r\nhouses with rusticated woodwork beneath their gables. On the west side\r\nof the lane No. 7 is an old eighteenth-century house, a fine specimen,\r\nwith brick courses across its frontage.\r\n\r\n  =St. Martin Orgar= was situated in St. Martin’s Lane, near\r\n  Candlewick Street. It was burnt down in the Great Fire and not\r\n  rebuilt, its parish being annexed to St. Clement’s, Eastcheap. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1348.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Orgarus, who gave\r\n  it about 1181 to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s, who held it up\r\n  to 1666, when the church was burnt down.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 280.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: William Cromer, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £30 : 15 : 4 in 1548, when John Carre was priest; John\r\n  Weston, who gave to the Augmentation of Our Lady’s Mass to be “songe\r\n  by note” £12 : 18 : 8 a year in 1548; William Oreswicke, whose\r\n  endowment for two chaplains fetched £13 : 5 : 0 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The church contained monuments to: William Crowmer, mayor, who built\r\n  a chapel on the south side of the church, and who was buried there\r\n  in 1433; Sir Humphrey Browne, Lord Chief Justice (d. 1562); Sir\r\n  Allen Cotton, lord mayor (d. 1628). There was also a monument to\r\n  Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  According to Stow the parish enjoyed the benefits of many\r\n  benefactors. Among others, Benedict Barnham was donor of £10 yearly;\r\n  Thomas Nicolson of £5; Sir Humphrey Walwyn of £5; and James Hall of\r\n  three tenements to the value of £18 : 10 : 0.\r\n\r\n  Brien Walton (d. 1661), Bishop of Chester, was rector here.\r\n\r\n=Crooked Lane= has been partly destroyed to make way for the approach to\r\nLondon Bridge, which has also swallowed up St. Michael’s Lane and Great\r\nEastcheap. In Crooked Lane stood a house before the Fire called “the\r\nLeaden Porch,” which belonged to one Sir John Sherston in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The lane also contained St. Michael’s Church, the burial-place\r\nof William Walworth.\r\n\r\n  =St. Michael, Crooked Lane=, was situated on the east side of\r\n  Miles’s Lane, Great Eastcheap, and was one of the thirteen\r\n  “Peculiars” in the City, subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury. It\r\n  was repaired and redecorated in 1610, but burnt down by the Great\r\n  Fire and rebuilt from Wren’s designs in 1687; the steeple was not\r\n  built till 1698. In 1831 the building was pulled down, its parish\r\n  being united with those of St. Magnus and St. Margaret. The earliest\r\n  date of an incumbent is 1286.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, before 1286; the Archbishop of\r\n  Canterbury, who presented in 1408, in whose successors it continued\r\n  up to 1848, when the church was annexed to St. Magnus the Martyr.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 354.\r\n\r\n  The church built by Wren, which was without aisles, measured 78 feet\r\n  in length and 46 feet in breadth. The tower was surmounted by a\r\n  circular lantern in three stages, supporting a cupola with a lofty\r\n  vane and cross, and reached a height of about 100 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By William Walworth (mayor 1380) of\r\n  five chaplains; he endowed it with lands, etc., which fetched £20 :\r\n  13 : 4 in 1548, when the priests were William Berte, Thomas Harper,\r\n  William Hale, William Clayton, and John Nesehame; by John Rothinge,\r\n  who left £6 yearly, which is appropriated to finding a Walworth\r\n  chaplain; by Walter Morden, who endowed it with the “bores hedde” in\r\n  Eastcheap, valued at £4 a year; by William de Burgo, who had the\r\n  King’s licence June 21, 1318, whose endowment fetched £6 : 13 : 4 in\r\n  1548; by Pentecost Russel and Gerard de Staundon at the altar of St.\r\n  Thomas Martyr and St. Edmund; the King granted his licence July 14,\r\n  1321, for himself, his father and mother, and G. de Staundon, late\r\n  parson of Stevenage, Herts; by Henry Grubbe, for which the King\r\n  granted his licence April 20, 1371; by Roger Steere, who endowed it\r\n  with tenements valued at £8 : 8 : 0 yearly, which is spent towards\r\n  finding the Walworth chaplains; by William Jordan, who left £5 :\r\n  16 : 8 to find a priest, but this was also appropriated to the\r\n  Walworth chaplains; by Robert Brocket, who endowed it with £7 a\r\n  year; by John Longe, who left 10s. per annum; March 10, 1380-81—the\r\n  King granted his licence to William Walworth, citizen and merchant\r\n  of London, to unite diverse chantries in this church, founded by\r\n  Pentecost Russell; Matilda and Roger Steere; John Harewe; John\r\n  Abell; W. Burgh; Henry Grubbe; William Jordan; Walter Mordon; and\r\n  Thomas atte Leye, which by changes of time are insufficient to\r\n  maintain these chantries, and he was further empowered to found a\r\n  college of one master and nine chaplains there.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained monuments to: John Lovekin,\r\n  fishmonger, four times Lord Mayor, through whom the church, 1348,\r\n  1358, 1365, and 1366, was rebuilt; also Sir William Walworth, the\r\n  mayor who overthrew Wat Tyler—he enlarged the church with a new\r\n  choir and side-chapels and founded a college in connection with it;\r\n  Sir John Brug, mayor 1520, donor of £50.\r\n\r\n  No legacies or charitable gifts are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n  John Poynet (d. 1556), Bishop of Rochester and of Winchester, was\r\n  rector here; also Adam Molens or Molyneux (d. 1450), Bishop of\r\n  Chichester, who was slain at Portsmouth by the Marines, incited by\r\n  Richard, Duke of York; Giovanni Giglii (d. 1498), Bishop of\r\n  Worcester.\r\n\r\nAt the end of =Swan Lane= is Old Swan Pier, beneath which are the famous\r\nOld Swan Stairs; these now consist of stone steps followed by a flight\r\nof wooden ones, descending straight into the water. Stow calls them “a\r\ncommon stair on the Thames.” In 1441, when the Duchess of Gloucester did\r\npenance at Christchurch-by-Aldgate, she landed here, and walked the rest\r\nof the way. When persons did not care to risk “shooting London Bridge,”\r\nit was customary for them to land at these stairs, walk to the other\r\nside of the bridge, and then take to the water again. Pepys in his\r\n_Diary_ (1661) mentions taking Mr. Salisbury to Whitehall: “But he could\r\nnot by any means be moved to go through the bridge, and we were fain to\r\ngo round by the Old Swan Pier”; and Boswell says that he and Johnson\r\n“landed at the Old Swan and walked to Billingsgate,” where they took\r\noars for Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe race for Doggett’s Coat and Badge, open to watermen, is rowed\r\nbetween the Old Swan and the White Swan at Chelsea. Near these stairs\r\nwas John Hardcastle’s counting-house, where were first brought forth the\r\nHibernian Society, the London Missionary Society, the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society, and the Religious Tract Society.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Swan Lane (west side) is the entrance to the subway called\r\nWaterside. It passes beneath Tennants’, Commercial, and Dyers’ Hall\r\nwharves, in front of Red Bull Wharf (the only place where it emerges\r\ninto the open), and ultimately runs under the City of London Brewery\r\ninto All Hallows Lane. In Strype’s 1754 map the whole of the riverside\r\nfrom Swan to All Hallows Lane is shown as a broad path (40 feet wide)\r\nopen to the water, and called New Key, upon which debouch all the lanes\r\nleading from Thames Street to the shore. It was part of a design of Wren\r\nfor improving the river-bank after the Great Fire. In a map of 1819 the\r\n“key,” though mostly open, is shown to be a subway under a portion of\r\nthe brewery. It is marked as a “Public Way.” It has been gradually\r\ncovered over by the extension of the brewery and the wharves, so that\r\nnow what was once a riverside walk has become a subway, from which the\r\nwater is nowhere visible, unless one of the wharf doors happens to be\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe Fishmongers’ Hall rises squarely beside London Bridge, and not far\r\noff is the Monument, with an absurd _chevaux de frise_ of spikes rising\r\nfrom its golden ball, and representing flames, very much as they are\r\nrepresented in the contemporary illustrations of the Fire. St. Magnus’s\r\nwhite steeple makes a good foreground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE FISHMONGERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The origin of the Fishmongers Company is lost in remote antiquity;\r\n  it is unquestionable that it existed prior to the reign of Henry\r\n  II., and originated in an association or brotherhood.\r\n\r\n  The Fishmongers Company lost the greater part of its earlier\r\n  records, books, and muniments in the Great Fire of London; the\r\n  earliest existing record in the possession of the Company being a\r\n  court book dating from 1592.\r\n\r\n  The privileges of the Company were confirmed by royal charters in\r\n  the reign of Edward I., 1272, Edward II., 1307, and Edward III.,\r\n  1327.\r\n\r\n  The first extant charter is in Norman French, dated July 10, 1364,\r\n  37 Edward III.\r\n\r\n  It recites that from ancient times, whereof memory runs not, it was\r\n  a custom that no fish should be sold in the City of London but by\r\n  fishmongers, except stockfish, which belongs to the mistery of\r\n  stockfishmongers (subsequently incorporated with the fishmongers),\r\n  and further recites that the mistery of fishmongers had grants from\r\n  the King’s progenitors in ancient times, that the fishmongers should\r\n  choose yearly certain persons of the mistery to well and lawfully\r\n  rule the same.\r\n\r\n  The foregoing charter was confirmed by a proclamation of the\r\n  following year, July 12, 1365, 38 Edward III., which granted further\r\n  power and privileges to the mistery of fishmongers of the City of\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  FISHMONGERS’ HALL, PRESENT DAY\r\n]\r\n\r\n  By a further mandate of King Edward III., dated July 24 in the same\r\n  year, the King granted to the fishmongers of the said city, and of\r\n  the liberty of the halmote of the same mistery, that no person,\r\n  stranger or inhabitant, should in any manner occupy the mistery of\r\n  fishmongers in the said city, or intermeddle therewith, unless he\r\n  were of the same mistery; and that the fishmongers of the same\r\n  liberty should be able in every year to elect four persons (to be\r\n  sworn) to oversee the buying and selling of fish in the said city,\r\n  and well and faithfully to rule the said mistery “for the common\r\n  commodity of our people.”\r\n\r\n  In the twenty-second year of King Richard II., May 9, 1399, another\r\n  charter was granted.\r\n\r\n  By an Inspeximus of 6 Henry VI., July 10, 1427, the charter of King\r\n  Richard II. was confirmed.\r\n\r\n  By charter of 23 Henry VII., dated July 3, 1508, the Letters Patent\r\n  of 11 Henry VI., 1433, are set forth and ratified and confirmed.\r\n\r\n  By a charter of 24 King Henry VII., dated September 20, 1508, the\r\n  stockfishmongers of the City of London were incorporated by the name\r\n  of “The Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery of Stockfishmongers of\r\n  the City of London,” with perpetual succession and a common seal.\r\n\r\n  In the twenty-seventh year of King Henry VIII., 1537, a charter was\r\n  granted by which the two corporations of the Fishmongers Company and\r\n  Stockfishmongers Company were incorporated as one company, and in\r\n  the same year a deed was executed between the two companies\r\n  regulating the terms of such union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  LONDON BRIDGE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The rest of the brief history furnished by the Company is a recital\r\n  of the later charters, which do not seem of very great importance.\r\n  The number of liverymen in 1898 was 344; the Corporate Income was\r\n  £46,053; the Trust Income was £7235.\r\n\r\n  Freemen, the widows of freemen, and freewomen, being in poor\r\n  circumstances, are eligible for pecuniary relief by way of grant or\r\n  pension, or for election to the Company’s almshouses. The children\r\n  of freemen are eligible for weekly pensions or pecuniary relief.\r\n\r\n  Loans are also made by the Company in special cases in aid of\r\n  freemen in necessitous circumstances.\r\n\r\n  The Company has established a number of educational exhibitions for\r\n  the children of deserving freemen, and subscribe liberally to the\r\n  City of London Institute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FISHMONGERS’ HALL IN 1811\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The children of freemen are also eligible for the nominations to\r\n  Christ’s Hospital in the gift of the Company.\r\n\r\n  Liverymen have the usual privileges, and receive invitations in turn\r\n  to dine at livery dinners in the Company’s hall.\r\n\r\n  The Company’s first hall was the house of Lord Fanhope given to the\r\n  Fishmongers by him in the reign of Henry VIII. It was rebuilt after\r\n  the Fire by Jarman. It stood on the north foot of the present\r\n  bridge. The present hall was erected when New London Bridge\r\n  swallowed up its predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. MAGNUS, LONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\n  St. Magnus stands on the south side of Thames Street at the bottom\r\n  of Fish Street Hill; it was called the “Martyr” from its dedicatory\r\n  saint, who suffered martyrdom in Cæsarea in the time of Aurelian the\r\n  Emperor. It was burnt down by the Great Fire, and rebuilt by Wren,\r\n  who completed it in 1676, with the exception of the steeple, which\r\n  was not added till 1705. The parish of St. Margaret, New Fish\r\n  Street, was annexed to this after the Fire. In 1831 that of St.\r\n  Michael, Crooked Lane, was also annexed. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1247.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  ST. MAGNUS\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Bermondsey before 1252, and the Abbot and Convent of\r\n  Westminster alternately, since 1252; Henry VIII. seized it, and\r\n  granted it to the Bishop of Westminster, January 20, 1540-41; Bishop\r\n  of London by grant of Edward VI. in 1550, confirmed by Queen Mary,\r\n  March 3, 1553-54, in whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 535.\r\n\r\n  The building is one of the most beautiful of all the City churches;\r\n  it measures 90 feet in length, 59 feet in breadth, and 41 feet in\r\n  height. It contains a nave and side-aisles separated by slender\r\n  Ionic columns standing a considerable distance from each other. The\r\n  steeple rising near London Bridge is seen to great advantage, and is\r\n  considered one of the best of Wren’s works. It consists of a tower\r\n  with a cornice, parapet, and vases, surmounted by an octagonal\r\n  lantern with a cupola, which, in its turn, is surmounted by a\r\n  slender lantern and spire, with a finial and vane. The total height\r\n  is 185 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Andrew Hunt, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £6 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Gilbert Smythe was chaplain; Thomas\r\n  Makinge, whose endowment yielded £16 in 1548, when Thomas Parker was\r\n  chaplain; Sir John Deepdene, Knt., for himself and Elizabeth his\r\n  wife, at the Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary, and also at the same\r\n  altar by Robert Ramsey, for himself and Jane his wife, for which the\r\n  King granted his licence, February 5, 1404-1405—the endowments\r\n  fetched £16 : 13 : 4 in 1548, when Joseph Stepneth was chaplain;\r\n  Ralph de Gray, whose endowment fetched £4 in 1548; Hugh Pourt, who\r\n  was sheriff of London 1303, for himself and Margaret his wife, at\r\n  the Altar of Blessed Virgin Mary, to which Hugo de Waltham was\r\n  admitted chaplain, October 10, 1322—this chantry was augmented by\r\n  Roger Clovill, and the King granted his licence in mortmain, June\r\n  10, 1370; John Bever, for the support of two priests, whose\r\n  endowment fetched £20 : 6 : 8 in 1548, but no priests have been\r\n  found since Henry IV.’s time—the King granted his licence, May 26,\r\n  1448, to constitute the Guild of S. Maxentius and S. Thomas; Andrew\r\n  Hunt and several others founded and endowed the Brotherhood of Salve\r\n  Regina, whose gifts fetched £49 : 0 : 4 in 1548, when John Swanne\r\n  and William Bunting were the chaplains.\r\n\r\n  The old church was the place of sepulture of several persons of note\r\n  in their day, amongst whom may be mentioned Henry Yeuele,\r\n  master-mason to Edward III., Richard II., and Henry IV.; Sir W.\r\n  Gerrard, mayor in 1555; and Sir John Gerrard, mayor in 1601; and\r\n  Thomas Collet, for twenty years deputy of this ward, who died in\r\n  1703. On the demolition of St. Bartholomew by the Exchange, the\r\n  remains of Miles Coverdale were brought here, as he had been rector\r\n  of the church 1563-66. His monument is on the east wall, south of\r\n  the communion table.\r\n\r\n  Sixty boys and forty girls were maintained in the Candlewick and\r\n  Bridge Wards.\r\n\r\n  The parish did not possess many large charitable gifts: Samuel Petty\r\n  was donor of £600, of which only £250 was received, owing to the\r\n  bonds not being good; Susanna Chambers, £17; Thomas Arnold, £2 :\r\n  12s.; John Jennings, £13.\r\n\r\n  Besides Miles Coverdale, other rectors of note were: Richard de\r\n  Medford or Mitford, Bishop of Chichester in 1389; Maurice Griffith\r\n  (d. 1558), Bishop of Rochester.\r\n\r\n=Great Eastcheap=, now destroyed, was in Stow’s time a market-place for\r\nbutchers: it had also cooks mixed among the butchers and such others as\r\nsold victuals ready dressed of all sorts. “For of old time when friends\r\ndid meet and were disposed to be merry, they went not to dine and sup at\r\ntaverns but to the cooks, where they called for meat what they liked\r\nwhich they found ready dressed and at a reasonable rate.” In Great\r\nEastcheap was the immortal tavern of the Boar’s Head, already mentioned\r\np. 106.\r\n\r\nThere was apparently another Boar’s Head in this ward. Maitland mentions\r\nit:\r\n\r\n“In this Ward there was a house called The Boar’s Head, inhabited by\r\nWilliam Sanderson, which came to King Edward VI. by the Statute about\r\nChantries; which, with the shops, cellars, solars, and other Commodities\r\nand easements, he sold in the second of his reign, together with other\r\nlands and tenements, to John Sicklemore and Walter Williams for two\r\nthousand six hundred and sixty-eight pounds, and upwards” (Maitland,\r\nvol. ii. p. 793).\r\n\r\n=Fish Street Hill=, or New Fish Street, formerly Bridge Street, led to\r\nOld London Bridge past St. Magnus’s Church. It contained an ancient\r\nstone house which had once been occupied by the Black Prince, and was\r\nafterwards converted into an inn called the Black Bell. Very frequent\r\nmention is made of Bridge Street. Here lived Andrew Horne, fishmonger,\r\nCity Chamberlain, author of the _Liber Horne_. A note which concerns him\r\nmay be found in Riley’s _Memorials_, A.D. 1315. Among the signs of the\r\nstreet were the “King’s Head”; the “Harrow”; the “Swan and Bridge”; the\r\n“Star”; the “Mitre”; the “Golden Cup”; the “Salmon”; the “Black Raven”;\r\nthe “Crown”; the “Maiden Head”; the “White Lion”; the “Swan,” etc.\r\nFoundations of Roman buildings have been found here. Riley has notices\r\nof the street between 1311 and 1340. Notices are found in the _Calendar\r\nof Wills_ from 1273. In the Guildhall MSS. the earliest mention of the\r\nstreet is 1189. In this street stood the Church of St. Margaret, not\r\nrebuilt after the Fire. This church was on the west above Crooked Lane.\r\n\r\n  =St. Margaret, New Fish Street=, sometimes called St. Margaret,\r\n  Bridge Street, stood on the east side of Fish Street Hill, where the\r\n  Monument now stands; it was destroyed by the Great Fire, and its\r\n  parish united to that of St. Magnus the Martyr. The earliest date of\r\n  an incumbent is 1283.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church, before 1283, was in the hands of: The\r\n  Abbot and Convent of Westminster, 1283-84; Henry VIII., who granted\r\n  it to the Bishop of Westminster, January 20, 1540-41; the Bishop of\r\n  London, by grant of Edward VI. in 1550, confirmed by Queen Mary,\r\n  March 3, 1553-54, in whose successors it continued up to 1666, when\r\n  the parish was annexed to St. Magnus.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 200.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Roger de Bury, for which the King\r\n  granted his licence in 1318; John Coggeshall, at the Altar of St.\r\n  Peter—his endowment fetched £13 : 10s. in 1548, when Richard Bec was\r\n  chaplain; Thomas Dursley, whose endowment yielded £4 in 1548; John\r\n  Rous, whose endowment fetched £5 in 1548; Robert Whaplode, whose\r\n  endowment yielded 40s. in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Only one monument of note is recorded by Stow, that of John\r\n  Coggeshall, 1384, and the reason of his eminence is not stated.\r\n\r\n  Some of the chantries belonging to this parish were: £2 : 10s., the\r\n  gift of John Wybert; £2, the gift of Katherine Parry; £1 : 10s., the\r\n  gift of Mr. Mosyer.\r\n\r\n  Candlewick and Bridge Wards maintained sixty boys and forty girls.\r\n\r\n  John Seton (d. 1568), Prebendary of York, author of _Dialectica_;\r\n  William Cotton (d. 1621), Bishop of Exeter; Samuel Hasnet,\r\n  Archbishop of York 1629, are among the notable rectors.\r\n\r\nOn the east side, higher up, stood the Church and burial-ground of St.\r\nLeonard’s Milk Church, also destroyed by the Fire and not rebuilt (see\r\np. 266). The most important building in Fish Street is, of course, the\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nFor =The Monument= we quote the account taken by Maitland from the life\r\nof Sir Christopher Wren:\r\n\r\n“In the year 1671, the Surveyor began the building of the great fluted\r\ncolumn of Portland Stone, and of the Dorick Order (commonly called the\r\nMonument of London, in memory of the burning and rebuilding of the\r\nCity), and finished it in 1677. The Artificers were obliged to wait\r\nsometimes for Stones of proper scantlings; which occasioned the work to\r\nbe longer in execution than otherwise it would have been. The altitude\r\nfrom the pavement is two hundred and two feet, the diameter of the shaft\r\nor body of the column is fifteen feet, the ground bounded by the Plinth\r\nor lowest part of the pedestal is twenty-eight feet square, and the\r\npedestal in height is forty feet. Within is a large staircase of black\r\nmarble, containing three hundred and forty-five steps, ten inches and an\r\nhalf broad, and six inches rising. Over the Capital is an Iron Balcony,\r\nencompassing a Cippus or Meta, thirty-two feet high, supporting a\r\nblazing urn of brass gilt. Prior to this, the Surveyor (as it appears by\r\nan original drawing) had made a design of a pillar of somewhat less\r\nproportion, viz.: fourteen feet in diameter, and after a peculiar\r\ndevice: For, as the Romans expressed by Relievo, on the pedestals, and\r\nround the shafts of their Columns, the history of such actions and\r\nincidents as were intended to be thereby commemorated; so this Monument\r\nof the conflagration and resurrection of the City of London was\r\nrepresented by a pillar in flames; the flames, blazing from the\r\nloopholes of the shaft (which were to give light to the stairs within),\r\nwere figured in brasswork gilt, and on the top was a Phoenix rising from\r\nher ashes, of brass gilt likewise.” The total expense was about £14,500.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE MONUMENT IN 1752\r\n\r\n  From a drawing by Signor Canalsti.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe height (202 feet) is supposed to be equal to its distance eastward\r\nfrom the house in Pudding Lane in which the Fire broke out. Inside are\r\n345 steps, by which any one after paying 3d. may ascend to the caged-in\r\nplatform near the top. The pedestal has Latin inscriptions on the north,\r\nsouth, and east panels. In 1681 a further inscription, running round the\r\nbase of the pedestal, was added as follows:\r\n\r\n  This pillar was set up in perpetual remembrance of that most\r\n  dreadful burning of this Protestant City begun and carried on by y^e\r\n  treachery and malice of y^e Popish factio, in y^e beginning of\r\n  Septem in y^e year of our Lord 1666 in order to y^e carrying on\r\n  their horrid plott for extirpating the Protestant religion and old\r\n  English liberty, and the introducing Popery and slavery.\r\n\r\nThis was obliterated in the reign of James II., but recut in that of his\r\nsuccessor, causing Pope’s comment:\r\n\r\n             Where London’s column, pointing to the skies,\r\n             Like a tall bully rears its head and lies.\r\n\r\nThe obnoxious inscription was not erased until 1831.\r\n\r\nOn the west panel of the pedestal is a bas-relief representing Charles\r\nII. in Roman dress attended by Liberty, Genius, and Science.\r\n\r\nIn the background the City is being rebuilt, and at the King’s feet Envy\r\ntries to rekindle the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. LEONARD, EASTCHEAP\r\n\r\n  This church stood at the corner of Eastcheap on Fish Street Hill; it\r\n  was sometimes called St. Leonard Milk Church, from one Am. Milker,\r\n  who built it. It suffered considerably from a fire in 1618, but was\r\n  subsequently well repaired. The building was destroyed by the Great\r\n  Fire, and its parish annexed to that of St. Benet, Gracechurch\r\n  Street. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1348.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, 1353; Henry VIII., who seized\r\n  it in 1540, and soon after gave it to the Dean and Chapter of\r\n  Canterbury.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 260.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Reginald de Canterbury, citizen, at\r\n  the Altar of St. Thomas the Archbishop in 1329, when John de\r\n  Lacelbrigge was admitted chaplain; William Ivorye, whose endowment\r\n  yielded £8 : 6 : 8 in 1548; John Bromesburye and John Wasselbye,\r\n  whose endowments fetched £10 in 1548; Margery Bedyn, whose endowment\r\n  yielded £10 : 8s. in 1548; Hugo Browne, whose endowment fetched\r\n  £18 : 11s. in 1548; John Doggett, whose endowment yielded £10 in\r\n  1548; Robert Boydon.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of monuments were recorded by Stow to have\r\n  been well preserved. That of the greatest antiquity was one in\r\n  memory of John Johnson, who died 1280. Several were erected to\r\n  various members of the Doggett family, of whom Walter Doggett was\r\n  sheriff in 1380, John Doggett, a citizen of eminence in his day,\r\n  buried 1456 (_circa_); Robert Fitzhugh (d. 1436), Bishop of London,\r\n  was rector here.\r\n\r\n=Pudding Lane= was formerly Rother Lane, or Red Rose Lane. It was\r\ncalled, according to Stow, “Pudding Lane, because the butchers of\r\nEastcheap have their scalding houses for hogs there, and their puddings\r\nwith other filth of beasts are voided down that way to their dung boats\r\non the Thames. This lane stretcheth from Thames Street to Little East\r\nCheap, chiefly inhabited by basket makers, turners and butchers, and is\r\nall of Billingsgate Ward” (Cunningham). But the lane has its chief claim\r\nto remembrance in the fact that here originated the Great Fire.\r\n\r\nIn Stow’s time it was occupied by basket-makers, turners, and butchers.\r\nOn the north-east of the lane stood Butchers’ Hall, destroyed by the\r\nFire, and rebuilt; burned again in 1829; rebuilt in 1831; removed to\r\nBartholomew Close in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. GEORGE’S CHURCH\r\n\r\n  St. George’s Church was burnt down in the Great Fire, rebuilt by\r\n  Wren in 1674, and became the parish church for St. Botolph’s,\r\n  Billingsgate, which had been also destroyed but not re-erected. In\r\n  1895 the building was closed on account of its dilapidated state.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1321. [Since pulled down.]\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Prior and\r\n  Convent of St. Saviour, Bermondsey, in 1321; then the Crown, since\r\n  1541 up to 1666, when it was annexed to St. Botolph, Billingsgate,\r\n  and with it to St. Mary-at-Hill.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 123.\r\n\r\n  The present church measures 54 feet in length, 36 feet in breadth,\r\n  and 36 feet in height. It has two side-aisles, each separated from\r\n  the nave by two composite columns, placed far apart. The tower,\r\n  which rises at the north-west, consists of three stories, concluded\r\n  by a cornice and parapet, the angles of which are adorned with\r\n  vases. The total height is about 84 feet.\r\n\r\n  Stow records a chantry founded by Roger Delakere.\r\n\r\n  The monuments of the original church were well preserved, Stow says.\r\n  Those commemorated, however, were of comparatively little eminence;\r\n  amongst them were William Combes, donor of £40; James Mountford,\r\n  another benefactor to the church, who died 1544. Among the more\r\n  recent ones was one in memory of George Clint, parish clerk for\r\n  thirty years, who died in 1605.\r\n\r\n=Monument Street= was only opened about ten years ago, and cost half a\r\nmillion of money; this was spent partly in compensation to the\r\ndispossessed leaseholders. It was designed to afford a wide and direct\r\nroute to the City for the fish brought from Billingsgate. A row of new\r\nred brick buildings lines part of the way on the right; at the corner of\r\nSt. Mary-at-Hill is a post-office. Beyond these buildings is the ancient\r\ngraveyard of St. Botolph, Billingsgate, which church was burnt in the\r\nGreat Fire and not rebuilt. The graveyard is now used as a public\r\nrecreation ground, and is fronted by a neat wall with a parapet, and on\r\neither side of the gate is a high brick pier with a lamp on the summit.\r\nOn the south side of Monument Street fragments of waste ground remain\r\nstill unbuilt on, and form receptacles for decayed fish and garbage.\r\n\r\nFor the Coal Exchange see p. 270.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE WATERMEN\r\n\r\n  In the sixth year of the reign of Henry VIII. an Act was passed\r\n  regulating the traffic of watermen, ferrymen, and bargemen on the\r\n  Thames, and settling the fares to be charged by them. In 1555 a\r\n  court was held by the “Company,” and in 1648 a proclamation\r\n  compelled certain “dirtboats and bumboats” to submit to the\r\n  regulations of “the Company.” The Lightermens Company was united to\r\n  the Watermens in 1667. But the first charter of incorporation was\r\n  not granted until 7 and 8 George IV., 1827; and this was amended by\r\n  two acts of Victoria in 1859 and 1864.\r\n\r\n  After the Great Fire the Watermen’s Hall was erected on the\r\n  south-west corner of the Cold Harbour quay, where Strype’s map shows\r\n  it. It was a handsome brick building, and was in use by the Company\r\n  until 1780, when, their premises being required for an extension of\r\n  the brewery, they vacated them, afterwards removing to their present\r\n  hall in St. Mary-at-Hill. The old hall faced the Thames upon New\r\n  Key, and in front to the river there was a large flight of stone\r\n  stairs, open at all times to watermen and the public. They had been\r\n  in uninterrupted use for a long period since the Great Fire, and had\r\n  neither gate nor other obstruction. They became at length much\r\n  dilapidated, and were “altogether removed and the wharf closed up”\r\n  says Wilkinson, a few years prior to 1825. The hall, wharf, and\r\n  stairs are shown in an engraving published by S. and N. Buck in\r\n  1749.\r\n\r\nLove Lane was formerly Rope Lane, afterwards Lucas Lane, and then\r\ncorruptly Love Lane.\r\n\r\nIt is a crooked winding thoroughfare paved by flags, and the houses are\r\nmainly inhabited by fish salesmen who work at Billingsgate. Beyond the\r\nchurch are large warehouses, and business houses in the usual style.\r\n\r\nThe back of a famous old house now used as a ward school is in Love\r\nLane, but its front faces on to a cobble-stone yard connected with\r\nBotolph Lane by a covered entry. Within the house everything points to\r\nits having been the residence of some one of wealth and taste. The hall\r\nis paved with alternate slabs of black and white marble. The staircase\r\nis wide and beautifully proportioned and decorated. The date 1670 is on\r\nthe ceiling; on the first floor four doors with rich wood carving on the\r\npediments and lintels attract attention. Ceilings and fireplaces alike\r\nbespeak careful work. One of the latter is inlaid in different coloured\r\nmarbles with a white marble plaque of a sleeping child. But downstairs,\r\nin a small room on the ground floor, is the chief feature of interest.\r\nThe walls and panels are literally covered with oil-paintings with the\r\nartist’s name and the date “R. Robinson, 1696.” The subject seems to be\r\nlife in different parts of the globe. The ceiling is of oak heavily\r\ncarved, though, alas! whitewashed.\r\n\r\nThe house is now a ward school, and though in repair shows inevitable\r\nsigns of wear and tear. The hall pavement is stained and broken, the\r\ncarved woodwork thickly covered with paint and varnish, yet in spite of\r\nall this is a place well worth seeing, probably the oldest\r\ndwelling-house in the City.\r\n\r\n  =St. Andrew Hubbard=, sometimes called St. Andrew, Eastcheap,\r\n  formerly stood in Love Lane. It was burnt down in the Great Fire and\r\n  not rebuilt. The parish was then annexed to St. Mary-at-Hill. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1366.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Earl of\r\n  Pembroke in 1323; John, Lord Talbot, cousin and heir of the above,\r\n  1427; Edward IV., who restored it, 1463, to the Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\n  who presented it in 1470; the Earl of Northumberland up to 1666,\r\n  when it was annexed to St. Mary-at-Hill, after which the alternate\r\n  patronage was shared with the Duke of Somerset.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 282.\r\n\r\n  The charitable gifts recorded of this parish are very few; the\r\n  donors of them were: Margaret Dean, 3s. 4d. per annum; Mr. Jacobs,\r\n  £1 : 6 : 4; Mr. Green, £1. All were for the use of the poor.\r\n\r\n  The most notable rector was John Randall (1570-1622), Fellow of\r\n  Lincoln College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn =Little Eastcheap= was the weigh-house, built on the site of St.\r\nAndrew Hubbard, and rebuilt after the Fire.\r\n\r\n“Which said Weighhouse was before in Cornhill. In this House are weighed\r\nmerchandizes brought from beyond seas to the King’s Beam, to which doth\r\nbelong a Master, and under him four Master Porters, with labouring\r\nPorters under them. They have Carts and Horses to fetch the goods from\r\nthe Merchants’ Warehouses to the Beam, and to carry them back. The house\r\nbelongeth to the Company of Grocers, in whose gifts the several\r\nPorters’, etc., places are. But of late years little is done in this\r\noffice, as wanting a compulsive power to constrain the merchants to have\r\ntheir goods weighed; they alleging it to be an unnecessary trouble and\r\ncharge” (Cunningham).\r\n\r\n=Philpot Lane= was named after Sir John Philpot, mayor.\r\n\r\nAt the south-east end of =Rood Lane= is the Church of St. Margaret\r\nPattens, so called, according to Stow, because pattens were sold there.\r\nFormerly the lane was called St. Margaret Pattens, but when about\r\n1536-38 the church was rebuilt, a rood was set up in the churchyard and\r\noblations made to the rood were employed in building the church. But in\r\n1538 the rood was discovered to be broken, together with the\r\n“tabernacle” wherein it had been placed. There was then a colony or\r\nsettlement of basket-makers in the parish, among whose houses a fire\r\nbroke out in the same month, which destroyed twelve houses and took the\r\nlives of nine persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. MARGARET PATTENS\r\n\r\n  This church was rebuilt, as Stow records, in the reign of Henry\r\n  VIII.; thoroughly repaired in 1614 and 1632, but destroyed by the\r\n  Great Fire. The present church was completed by Wren in 1687. The\r\n  parish of St. Gabriel’s, Fenchurch, was annexed to it after 1666.\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1305.\r\n\r\n  The derivation of the name is obscure; Stow’s conjecture has already\r\n  been given.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The family of the\r\n  Nevils in 1281; Robert Rickenden and Margaret his wife, who\r\n  confirmed it to Richard Whittington, who bestowed it on the Mayor\r\n  and Commonalty of London in 1411, with whom it continued up to 1666\r\n  when St. Gabriel’s was annexed, and it was therefore shared\r\n  alternately with the Crown.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 223.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 66 feet in length, 52 feet in breadth, and 32\r\n  feet in height, and consists of a nave, chancel, and north aisle.\r\n  The steeple consists of a tower, terminated by a cornice and\r\n  balustrade, with four pinnacles at the corners, above which a spire\r\n  rises, culminating in a ball and vane. The spire, which is 200 feet,\r\n  is taller than any other of Wren’s similar ones, and the steeple\r\n  comes third in order of height of those of his churches. There is a\r\n  picture on the north side of the church which is said to be the work\r\n  of Carlo Maratti (1625-1713), a Roman painter. The church is famous\r\n  for its canopied pews, the only ones in the city; in one of these\r\n  the initials C. W., supposed to be those of Sir Christopher Wren,\r\n  and the date 1686, are inlaid.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by: Peter at Vyne, at the Altar of\r\n  Blessed Virgin Mary, to which John Skelton was admitted chaplain\r\n  1472-73.\r\n\r\n  The original church does not seem to have possessed any monuments of\r\n  note. Of the later ones, the most interesting are those of: Giles\r\n  Vandeput, erected by his son, Sir Peter Vandeput, who was sheriff in\r\n  1684, and donor of £100 to the parish; Sir Peter Delme, Lord Mayor\r\n  in 1723, whose monument is the work of Johan Michael Rysbrack, or\r\n  Rysbrach, of Antwerp; Dr. Thomas Birch, Secretary of the Royal\r\n  Society, and author, who was rector here for nearly nineteen years,\r\n  was buried in the chancel, 1766. The side altar of the north aisle\r\n  contains a Della Robbia plaque representing the Virgin and Child, in\r\n  memory of Thomas Wagstaffe, the ablest of the non-jurors, appointed\r\n  rector here in 1684 and deprived in 1690.\r\n\r\n  Sir Peter Vandeput was donor of £100 to the parish; —— Collyer of\r\n  £5; Thomas Salter of £20; Richard Camden of £20. The other\r\n  charitable gifts recorded amounted to £6 per annum.\r\n\r\n  John Milward (1556-1609), chaplain to James I., was rector here;\r\n  also Thomas Birch (1705-66), Secretary to the Royal Society; and\r\n  Peter Whalley (1722-91), head-master of Christ’s Hospital, and\r\n  author of various works.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. MARY-AT-HILL\r\n\r\n  We pass on to St. Mary-at-Hill; a church well known on account of\r\n  the energetic work of its rector, Rev. W. Carlile, founder of the\r\n  Church Army, who popularises church work among his poor parishioners\r\n  by lantern services and other devices. The date of the foundation of\r\n  the original church is not known, but there is evidence of its\r\n  existence in the middle of the fourteenth century. In 1616 it was\r\n  thoroughly repaired, but the body of it was destroyed by the Great\r\n  Fire and rebuilt by Wren, 1672-77. The stone tower remained standing\r\n  till 1780, when it was considered insecure and pulled down, when it\r\n  was replaced by the present one. In 1892 the church was closed for\r\n  two years, while 3000 bodies were removed from beneath the flooring\r\n  to Norwood Cemetery. The parish of St. Andrew Hubbard was not\r\n  rebuilt after the Fire, and was annexed to this. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1337.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of Richard Hackney,\r\n  sheriff of London, who presented to it in 1337, and so on; it\r\n  remained in private persons up to 1640, when the parishioners\r\n  presented to it, up to 1666, when the parish of St. Andrew Hubbard\r\n  was annexed to it, the patronage now being alternate, Sir Henry Peek\r\n  having presented last in right of St. Andrew Hubbard in 1891.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 400.\r\n\r\n  The church measures 96 feet in length and 60 feet in breadth, and is\r\n  crowned by a cupola which rises to the height of 38 feet. The cupola\r\n  is divided into panels and is supported by four Doric columns,\r\n  forming two side aisles. The ceiling to the east and west of this is\r\n  arched, as well as that of the side aisles between the columns, so\r\n  that the appearance of the roof is thus rendered cruciform. There is\r\n  a great quantity of carving in the church, but of a late date, being\r\n  the work of Mr. W. Gibbs Rogers, who executed it in 1848-49 when the\r\n  church was remodelled.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By Rose Wrytell, at the Altar of St.\r\n  Edmund the King, before 1336. She left six marks for an endowment,\r\n  and Michael de Leek was licensed as chaplain, November 5, 1365. The\r\n  value was £8 : 2 : 6 in 1548, when Christopher Burley was priest at\r\n  the age of 43 years, “a good singer and well learned.” By John\r\n  Weston, whose endowment fetched £8 : 13 : 4 in 1548. By John Nasing,\r\n  at the Altar of St. Katherine. Harry Yorkflete the chaplain\r\n  exchanged it with John atte Welle, February 20, 1395-96; Thomas\r\n  Lewes was priest in 1548, “of the age of 42 years, a good singer and\r\n  player on the organ and prettily learned.” By William Cambridge,\r\n  whose endowment fetched £10 : 6 : 8 in 1548, when Matthew Berye was\r\n  priest, “of the age of 40 years, a good singer and indifferently\r\n  well learned.” By John Cawston, whose endowment yielded £20 : 17 : 8\r\n  in 1548, when Edmond Alston was priest, “of 36 years, a good singer\r\n  and handsomely learned.” By Richard Gosselinge, whose endowment\r\n  produced £9 in 1548, when John Sherpyn was priest, “of the age of 44\r\n  years, a teacher of children.” By John Bodman, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £14 : 6 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  The church formerly contained a considerable number of monuments,\r\n  but the persons commemorated are of comparatively little eminence.\r\n  Sir John Hampson, Knight and alderman, was buried here in 1607.\r\n  Within the communion rails of the present building the body of the\r\n  Rev. John Brand lies interred, who died in 1806; he was Fellow and\r\n  Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, and rector here for some\r\n  years. Edward Young, the poet, was married here to Lady Elizabeth\r\n  Lee, in 1731.\r\n\r\n  £10 or £11 per annum were given to the poor by several benefactors,\r\n  to be expended on bread. Other gifts recorded by Stow are: £40, from\r\n  Sir William Leman, for the maintenance of a Divinity Lecture; from\r\n  Jane Revel; £4 : 10s. to be paid every tenth year, from Bernard\r\n  Hyde.\r\n\r\n  Andrew Snape, D.D., Master of Eton College, Vice-Chancellor of\r\n  Cambridge 1721-23, was rector here.\r\n\r\nAt the south-eastern corner of St. Mary-at-Hill stands the mighty\r\nbuilding of the Coal Exchange. The material used is Portland stone, and\r\nthe great tower and cupola which rises above the street still retains\r\nits whiteness. The Exchange was opened in 1849. Monday is the principal\r\nmarket day, but markets are also held on Wednesdays and Fridays. Under\r\nthe Exchange are the remains of an old Roman bath, which was discovered\r\nwhen the foundations were being made. Strype says that above the stairs\r\nat Billingsgate “the coalmen and woodmongers meet every morning about\r\neight or nine o’clock, this place being their Exchange, for the coal\r\ntrade which brings a great resort of people and occasions a great trade\r\nto the inhabitants. And this place is now more frequented than in\r\nancient time, when Greenhithe was made use of for the same purpose, this\r\nbeing more commodious. And therefore it was ordained to be the only port\r\nfor all such sorts of merchandise.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  THE COAL EXCHANGE\r\n]\r\n\r\nUp to 1846 Billingsgate Fish-market contained only sheds and squalid\r\nbuildings in which the fish trade was carried on. But in that year J. B.\r\nBunning, the City architect, was employed to build a regular market. In\r\n1872 the great increase of the trade and the necessity for further\r\naccommodation induced the Corporation to pull down this building and\r\nrebuild on a larger scale. Old Darkhouse Lane and Billingsgate Stairs\r\nwere utilised to gain an increased site as the great bulk of the Custom\r\nHouse prevented any expansion eastward.\r\n\r\nSir Horace Jones was the architect. The building is of an Italian design\r\nand is of Portland stone with facings of yellow brick and polished grey\r\ngranite plinths and wall linings. A long arcade faces Thames Street, and\r\nat each end there are pavilion buildings. Within, the basement has an\r\narea of about 20,000 superficial feet. On the ground floor the area is\r\n39,000 square feet. The roof is on the Louvre glass principle carried on\r\nlattice girders of 60 feet span. There is a gallery with an area of 4000\r\nfeet; this is utilised for the sale of haddocks and dried fish.\r\n\r\n  =St. Botolph, Billingsgate=, stood against St. Botolph’s Lane, on\r\n  the south side of Thames Street. It was repaired in 1624, but burnt\r\n  down by the Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to\r\n  St. George, Botolph Lane. It stood against the Bridge Gate of the\r\n  first London Bridge, just as the other three churches of St. Botolph\r\n  stood at Aldgate, Aldersgate, and Bishopsgate. The earliest date of\r\n  an incumbent is 1343.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Dean and Chapter\r\n  of St. Paul’s, who received it from Orgarus about 1181.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 300.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: By and for Thomas Snodyland, late\r\n  rector, who died 1349, in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of\r\n  which Nicholas de Wansyngdon was chaplain, and exchanged it April\r\n  11, 1163—the King granted a licence for it December 15, 1371; by\r\n  John Pickman, at the Altar of Our Lady, whose endowment fetched £10\r\n  in 1548, when Thomas Serle was priest, “of the age of 50 years, of\r\n  good consideration and learning touching ordinary things”; by Thomas\r\n  Aubrey, whose endowment fetched £8 : 6 : 8 in 1548, when Thomas\r\n  Baynton was priest, “of the age of 60 years, of good consideration\r\n  and learning”; by Roger Smallwood. Here was founded the Fraternity\r\n  of Our Lady and St. John the Baptist. The endowment fetched £14 in\r\n  1548, when William Lucay was priest, “of the age of 50 years, a man\r\n  of good conversation and small learning.”\r\n\r\n  The church originally contained many monuments, but most of them had\r\n  disappeared by 1633. John Rainwell, mayor, 1426, had been buried in\r\n  it; also Stephen Forster, mayor in 1454.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of charitable gifts to the parish were: Robert\r\n  Fellows, of £25; William Fellows, of £25; Thomas Barber, of £6 :\r\n  18 : 6, and others of small amounts.\r\n\r\n  The parishes of St. George, Botolph Lane, and St. Botolph,\r\n  Billingsgate, in conjunction with the other part of Billingsgate\r\n  ward, maintained forty boys by subscription.\r\n\r\n  Laurence Bothe, rector here, became Bishop of Durham, 1457; of York,\r\n  1476-80 (died): also William Sherlock (d. 1707), Dean of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n=Billingsgate=, like Queenhithe, is an artificial port, constructed with\r\ngreat ease by digging out the foreshore of mud and shingle, and\r\nprotecting the square harbour thus formed by piles of timber, on which\r\nbeams were laid to form a quay, and sheds were built up for the\r\nprotection of the merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe port was close to the north end of the first bridge, so that goods\r\nlanded here might be easily carried into the Roman fort, while the port\r\nitself was protected by the fort. After the desertion of London by the\r\nRomans, the occupation by the Saxons, and the revival of trade,\r\nBillingsgate remained the principal port, though a large share of the\r\ntrade went to Queenhithe. The mouth of the Walbrook seems to have ceased\r\nvery early in the history of London to be a port. Billingsgate robbed\r\nQueenhithe of its trade in spite of all injunctions of restraint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency, Photo._\r\n\r\n  BILLINGSGATE MARKET\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fish-market has long since overwhelmed every other kind of\r\nmerchandise. The language and manners, the rough customs, and the\r\ndrinking habits of the Billingsgate fish-wives are proverbial. They have\r\nnow, however, all vanished, and the market is as quiet and decorous as\r\nany other. A curious custom is noted by Cunningham. The porters who\r\nplied at Billingsgate used to invite the passengers to stop and salute a\r\ncertain post. If one complied, and paid down sixpence, they gave him a\r\nname, and pretended to be his sponsors. If one refused, they laid hold\r\nof him and bumped him against the post. The custom reminds one of the\r\nsame bumping practised in walking the bounds of the parish; it had\r\nprobably the same origin, in keeping alive the memory of something by\r\nthe infliction of pain. The custom remained when the cause and reason\r\nhad long been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis end of Thames Street was called Petty Wales. Stow has an\r\ninteresting note on this subject:\r\n\r\n“Towards the east end thereof, namely, over against Galley key, Wool\r\nkey, and the Custom House, there have been of old time some large\r\nbuildings of stone, the ruins thereof do yet remain, but the first\r\nbuilders and owners of them are worn out of memory, wherefore the common\r\npeople affirm Julius Cæsar to be the builder thereof, as also of the\r\nTower itself. But thereof I have spoken already. Some are of another\r\nopinion, and that a more likely, that this great stone building was\r\nsometime the lodging appointed for princes of Wales, when they repaired\r\nto this city, and that, therefore, the street in that part is called\r\nPetty Wales, which name remaineth there most commonly until this day,\r\neven as where the kings of Scotland were used to be lodged betwixt\r\nCharing Cross and White Hall, it is likewise called Scotland, and where\r\nthe earls of Britons were lodged without Aldersgate, the street is\r\ncalled Britain Street, etc.\r\n\r\n“The said building might of old time pertain to the princes of Wales, as\r\nis aforesaid, but is since turned to other use.”\r\n\r\nThe Custom House itself, with its magnificent frontage and fine quay, is\r\nthe fifth built upon the same spot. The first was built in 1385. The\r\nsecond, third, and fourth were all destroyed by fire. No doubt the\r\nCustom officers could tell fine tales of exciting adventure, of ruin or\r\nfortune, of clever evasions and despicable tricks; but these things are\r\nsecret. The House itself, with the ships, the busy wharfingers, the\r\nboatmen, and the general liveliness of the scene, are all that are\r\napparent. Yet it requires little imagination to see the enormous\r\nimportance of the business done in this solid building of Smirke’s. A\r\ngreat source of our national income, a large part of the nation’s\r\nwealth, comes from this house. Tons of goods—ranging from hemp, honey,\r\nleeches, tobacco, to manufactured goods, marble, sugar, and spirits—are\r\ndaily surveyed by the Customs officers. Our total imports for 1901 were\r\nworth nearly £522,000,000.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Custom House is Wool Wharf, then several small quays, of\r\nwhich one, Galley Quay, carries a history in its name. It was so called\r\nbecause the Venetian and Genoese galleys here discharged their cargoes.\r\nThere is a tradition of some religious house having stood here also.\r\nHear what Stow says:\r\n\r\n“In this Lane of old time dwelt divers strangers, born of Genoa and\r\nthose parts; these were commonly called galley men, as men that came up\r\nin the galleys brought up wines and other merchandises, which they\r\nlanded in Thames Street, at a place called Galley key; they had a\r\ncertain coin of silver amongst themselves, which were halfpence of\r\nGenoa, and were called Galley halfpence; these halfpence were forbidden\r\nin the 13th of Henry IV., and again by parliament in the 4th of Henry V.\r\nAnd it was enacted that if any person bring into this realm Galley\r\nhalfpence, suskins, or dodkins, he should be punished as a thief; and he\r\nthat taketh or payeth such money shall lose a hundred shillings, whereof\r\nthe king shall have the one half, and he that will sue the other half.\r\nNotwithstanding, in my youth, I have seen them pass current, but with\r\nsome difficulty, for that the English halfpence were then, though not so\r\nbroad, somewhat thicker and stronger.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE BAKERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The Guild or Fraternity of Bakers would seem to have been in\r\n  existence as early as any other, seeing that the craft or mystery of\r\n  baking is the most ancient in existence. In the reign of Henry II.,\r\n  A.D. 1155, the Fraternity was charged in the Great Roll of the\r\n  Exchequer with one mark of gold for their Guild.\r\n\r\n  The Bakers Company, as the united Company of White and Brown bakers,\r\n  was first incorporated by charter of Henry VIII., dated July 22,\r\n  1509, to make, create, build, and establish a certain perpetual\r\n  fraternity or guild of one master and four keepers of the commonalty\r\n  of freemen of the mystery of bakers of the City of London and\r\n  suburbs thereof then dwelling, or thereafter to dwell, and of the\r\n  brothers and sisters freemen of the said mystery and others who\r\n  would choose to be of the same fraternity or guild within the City\r\n  aforesaid, and that the same master, four keepers, and commonalty\r\n  should for ever continue to be one corporate body, with power to\r\n  elect annually from among themselves one master and four keepers for\r\n  the superintending, ruling, and governing of the said mystery and\r\n  commonalty.\r\n\r\n  Previous to 1509 there were separate Companies of White Bakers and\r\n  Brown Bakers, and the White Bakers appear to have been incorporated\r\n  as early as 1307. From 1509 to 1622 the two Companies remained\r\n  united as the Bakers Company, but in 1622 the Brown Bakers,\r\n  conceiving themselves in some way ill-used or neglected, succeeded\r\n  in getting a separate charter of their own, and remained a separate\r\n  Company for thirty to forty years, when a peace was patched up, and\r\n  the two Companies were finally united in the Bakers Company.\r\n\r\n  Their hall in Harp Lane, formerly Hart Lane, is said by Stow to have\r\n  been the residence of one of the Chichele family, a grand-nephew of\r\n  the Archbishop and grandson of his brother the mayor or his brother\r\n  the sheriff. It was burned down in 1714 and rebuilt in 1719. The\r\n  genealogy below shows how this John Chichele was related to the\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury and Founder of All Souls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo. York & Son._\r\n\r\n  CUSTOM HOUSE\r\n]\r\n\r\n                John Chichele\r\n                ├── Henry, Archbishop.\r\n                ├── Robert, Sheriff, 1402; Mayor, 1411.\r\n                └── William, Alderman and Sheriff, 1409.\r\n                    ├── John, Chamberlain.\r\n                    │   └── Twenty-four children.\r\n                    └── William, Archdeacon.\r\n\r\n  The livery consists of 111; the Corporate Income is about £1580; the\r\n  Trust Income is £320.\r\n\r\nRoman remains have been found in =Tower Street=. Mention is made of the\r\nstreet from the thirteenth century, if not earlier, but the street is\r\nsingularly lacking in historical associations. Here the Earl of\r\nRochester, escaping from his friends, took up lodgings and pretended for\r\nsome weeks, not without success, to be an Italian physician. Here was\r\nthe tavern frequented by Peter the Czar after getting through his day’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of Tower Street was a “fair house” once belonging to one\r\nGriste, by whom Jack Cade was feasted. After the feast he requited his\r\nhost by robbing him.\r\n\r\nThere is also a house once owned by Sir John Champney, mayor in 1534. He\r\nbuilt a high tower of brick, proposing, in his pride, to look down upon\r\nhis neighbours. But he did not succeed, being punished by blindness. The\r\nhouse was afterwards occupied by Sir Percival Hart, Knight Harbinger to\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. DUNSTAN IN THE EAST\r\n\r\n  St. Dunstan in the East stands on St. Dunstan’s Hill, between Great\r\n  Tower Street and Upper Thames Street, and was anciently known as St.\r\n  Dunstan Juxta-Turrim. The date of its foundation is not known, but\r\n  an enlargement is recorded in 1382. It was partially destroyed in\r\n  the Great Fire and restored under Wren’s hands in 1698. This\r\n  building, with the exception of the steeple, was pulled down in\r\n  1810, and in 1817 the body of the present church was built of\r\n  Portland stone in the Perpendicular style by Laing and Tite. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1312.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the Prior and\r\n  Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, who granted it, April 24,\r\n  1365, to Simon Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, and his successors,\r\n  in whom it continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 900.\r\n\r\n  The present church is in the Perpendicular Gothic style, and\r\n  contains two side aisles divided from the central portion by slender\r\n  clustered columns and pointed arches, with a clerestory above. It\r\n  measures 115 feet in length, 65½ feet in breadth, and 40 feet in\r\n  height. The steeple is one of Wren’s most striking works. The tower,\r\n  measuring 21 square feet at the base, has four stories, surmounted\r\n  by four tall pinnacles; from behind these spring four arched ribs,\r\n  supporting a lantern and spire, terminating in a ball and vane. The\r\n  total height is 180 feet 4 inches. Though it is fragile in\r\n  appearance, it is very scientifically and strongly constructed. The\r\n  central east window has been closely copied from fragments which\r\n  were found during the excavations previous to rebuilding, and is the\r\n  work of Mr. John Buckler. Many of the windows contain the\r\n  coats-of-arms of benefactors, the work of Messrs. Baillie.\r\n\r\n  The only relics of the wood-carving by Grinling Gibbons which\r\n  adorned Wren’s church are the arms of Archbishop Tenison, primate\r\n  from 1695, now placed in the vestry-room; and the organ case for\r\n  Father Smith’s organ—this was sold to St. Alban’s Abbey, but is to\r\n  be brought back.\r\n\r\n  Several chantries were founded here: The Fraternity of Our Lady\r\n  founded by John Joye; by Joan Maken and Alice Lynne, at the Altar of\r\n  Jesus—their endowment fetched £20 : 11 : 8 in 1548, when Philip\r\n  Matthew was chaplain; for Richard de Eymne in 1285; by John Bosham\r\n  cl., and Alice, who was the wife of Nicholas Potyn, at the Altar of\r\n  Holy Trinity, for John and Alice, and for Nicholas Potyn (the King\r\n  granted his licence June 20, 1408; the endowment fetched £17 : 16 :\r\n  8 in 1548, when Robert Neale was priest); by Richard Coldbrok, whose\r\n  endowment fetched £13 : 3 : 4 in 1548, when Thomas Rock was priest;\r\n  by William Barret, at the Altar of Our Lady—his endowment yielded\r\n  £12 in 1548, when John Flude was chaplain.\r\n\r\n  Before the Great Fire, the church contained a monument to Sir John\r\n  Hawkins, the naval hero; and here Admiral Sir John Lawson, who was\r\n  mortally wounded in the sea-fight with the Dutch off Lowestoft in\r\n  1665, was buried. The present building contains a considerable\r\n  number of monuments, but few of those commemorated were persons of\r\n  eminence. There is a monument on the north wall to Sir John Moore,\r\n  President of Christ’s Hospital, and friend and partisan of Charles\r\n  II.; he died in 1702. The largest monument is one on the south side\r\n  of the chapel to Sir William Russell, who died in 1705. On the north\r\n  wall there is a tablet in memory of Richard Hale, in gratitude for\r\n  his granddaughter’s (Lady Williamson) gift of £4000 for the\r\n  rebuilding of the church. The most recent memorial is one affixed to\r\n  the north wall commemorating Colonel John Finnis, one of the heroes\r\n  of the Indian Mutiny 1857.\r\n\r\n  The names of a large number of benefactors are recorded by Stow,\r\n  among them, Sir Bartholomew James, William Sevenoaks, Sir William\r\n  Hariott, whose coat-of-arms is to be seen in the windows of the\r\n  north and south walls. William Bateman was a donor of £200, and\r\n  Gilbert Keate of £120.\r\n\r\n  Richard Smith (1503-63), Dean of Douai, was rector here 1554-57;\r\n  also John May (d. 1598), Bishop of Carlisle; Dr. John Jortin\r\n  (1698-1770), author of _The Life of Erasmus_; John Morton,\r\n  Archbishop of Canterbury; William Barlow (d. 1613), Bishop of\r\n  Rochester and Bishop of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n=Mincing Lane= is so called from having been at one time the residence\r\nor the property of certain Minchuns or Nuns, Stow says, belonging to St.\r\nHelen’s. This house was only founded in 1212.\r\n\r\nThis street is not mentioned in Riley’s _Memorials_. In the _Calendar of\r\nWills_ it occurs in 1273, “houses in Menechinlane”; also in 1294; in\r\n1304, “land and shops in Minchom Lane.” In 1362, “Mengeonlane”; and many\r\nother dates up to 1620.\r\n\r\nFrom end to end this street is lined with solid business houses chiefly\r\nin dark imitation stone. A building which attracts attention about\r\nhalf-way down on the east side is the Commercial Sale Rooms, occupying\r\nNos. 30 to 34. This is new, of light-coloured stone, and along the\r\nfrontage of the top floor run small granite columns in couples. Dunster\r\nCourt is surrounded by offices, etc. In it is Dunster House, occupied\r\nchiefly by brokers and merchants. Next to it is the Clothworkers’ Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CLOTHWORKERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  The craft of Fullers, and the Fraternity of Sheermen, arose out of\r\n  an association of persons subsidiary to the ancient “Gild” of\r\n  Tellarii, or woollen weavers, together with the Burrellers and\r\n  Testers, who seem to have been absorbed into the great guilds or\r\n  companies of Drapers and Merchant Taylors, all being associations of\r\n  persons connected with the fabrication, finishing, or vending of\r\n  cloth. The earliest notice existing in the Company’s archives is in\r\n  1456, respecting the Sheermen.\r\n\r\n  It appears, by reference to patent roll of 19 Edward IV., membrane\r\n  28, “Pro Pannariis Civitatis London,” that the wardens of the\r\n  fellowship of Sheermen, albeit unincorporate, had the power of\r\n  search over their own craft, “according to the laudable custom of\r\n  the city,” but the master wardens and fellowship of the two crafts\r\n  and mysteries of Drapers and Taylors, were thereby assured that no\r\n  charter of incorporation should be given to the Sheermen, etc.\r\n\r\n  The Fullers were incorporated the next year, 28th April, 20 Edward\r\n  IV., “Pro Fraternitate in arte Fullorum.” They would appear to have\r\n  been resident in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel Church, that\r\n  parish having been called “Villa Beatæ Mariæ de Matfellon,” a\r\n  designation derived, as has been supposed, from the fact of the herb\r\n  called “Matfellon” (“Fullers’ Teasel”), used extensively by the\r\n  fullers inhabiting that quarter, growing in a field hard by where\r\n  their tenter grounds were situate; the patron saint of the Fullers,\r\n  as of the Clothworkers afterwards, being the Blessed Virgin Mary.\r\n  The Fullers’ Hall was in Billiter Square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Thos. H. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n  CLOTHWORKERS’ HALL\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The Sheermen received their charter, “Incorporatio de lez Shermen,\r\n  Lond.,” 24th January, 23 Henry VII., 1507-8.\r\n\r\n  The guilds or companies of Fullers and Sheermen were united and\r\n  reincorporated under the name and style of “The Master Wardens and\r\n  Commonalty of Freemen of the Art or Mystery of Clothworkers of the\r\n  City of London,” 18th January, 19 Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n  A freeman or woman of the Company is entitled, if well accounted and\r\n  continuing of good name and fame, and having fallen into poverty or\r\n  necessity, to be refreshed weekly, monthly, or quarterly towards his\r\n  or her sustentation and living, out of the corporate funds of the\r\n  Company, as well as out of the trust funds specifically left for\r\n  that purpose by benefactors; also to be decently buried on their\r\n  decease at the costs of the Company. There are a limited number of\r\n  almshouses for freemen and women, founded by members of the Company,\r\n  and there are trust funds likewise left by former benefactors for\r\n  the relief and sustentation of decayed or worn-out members.\r\n\r\n  The livery is 180 in number; the Corporate Income is £42,000; the\r\n  Trust Income is £18,000. The hall is at 41 Mincing Lane. Stow merely\r\n  mentions the existence of the hall. The original hall was burned\r\n  down in the Fire, rebuilt, taken down in 1856, and rebuilt by Samuel\r\n  Angell, architect. Among the most distinguished members of this\r\n  Company were Samuel Pepys, President of the Royal Society, and\r\n  Master of the Company in 1677; and Lord Kelvin, who filled similar\r\n  positions.\r\n\r\n  This rich Company has long been remarkable even among the other\r\n  wealthy Companies of the City for the encouragement and advancement\r\n  of technical education. It has either wholly or in part endowed\r\n  technical and scientific schools at Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield,\r\n  Keighley, Bristol, and other places. It has contributed to the City\r\n  and Guilds of London Technical Institute sums amounting to £118,350,\r\n  and in addition gives an annual subsidy of £3300.\r\n\r\n=Mark Lane=, once Mart Lane, is mentioned in the thirteenth century; in\r\n1276, Robert le Chaloner had a house in Mark Lane in the ward of William\r\nde Hadestocke, _i.e._ Town Ward. And the _Calendar of Wills_ mentions\r\nthe lane a little later and has many references to it. In 1750 it\r\ncontained “divers large houses for merchants, though some of them are\r\nold timber houses.” The street escaped the Fire.\r\n\r\nMilton’s friend Cyriack Skinner lived here. Isaac Watts was assistant\r\npreacher in a meeting-house in this street.\r\n\r\nMark Lane is of the same general character as Mincing Lane, but\r\npossesses a point of distinction in the Corn Exchange. The new building\r\nis on the east side, a little to the south of the old one. This is a\r\nfine building, erected 1881 by Edward l’Anson. The high glass roof is\r\nsupported in the interior by rows of light stone columns. The old Corn\r\nExchange, rebuilt 1747 by J. Woods, has a heavy colonnade of fluted\r\nDoric columns which attracts attention in the line of the street. In a\r\nsmall court opposite the new building is a fine doorway, and passing\r\ndown the entry we find ourselves facing a splendid old red-brick City\r\nmansion in good repair. Brick pilasters ending in ornate stuccoed\r\ncapitals run up to a frieze or cornice above the first floor. The\r\nelaborate pediment over the doorway is supported by fluted columns and\r\nencloses a design of cherubs and foliage.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Mark Lane we have Nos. 69 and 70 of rather unusual\r\ndesign, and the remainder of the street is one uniform sweep of\r\nbuildings in an unobtrusive and useful style.\r\n\r\nOn the west side near the north end was the church of Allhallows\r\nStaining.\r\n\r\n  =Allhallows Staining= was so called from its having been built of\r\n  stone and not of timber. It was not burnt down in the Great Fire,\r\n  but fell down suddenly in 1669, and was rebuilt in 1694. The\r\n  building was taken down in 1870. The earliest date of an incumbent\r\n  is 1258.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The family of de\r\n  Waltham, 1285; the Abbey and Convent of St. Mary Graces; the Crown;\r\n  George Bingley and others; Lady Slaney, 1802, who bequeathed it to\r\n  the Grocers Company.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 424.\r\n\r\n  The church contained a beautiful east window of pointed glass\r\n  presented by the Company of Grocers.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: William de Grenestede, to which John\r\n  de Paxton, priest, was admitted November 27, 1362; William Palmer,\r\n  whose endowment fetched £3 : 6 : 8 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  This church contained monuments to: John Gostin, a benefactor to the\r\n  parish; Sir Richard Yate, Knight Ambassador for Henry VIII.; William\r\n  Frith, painter; and Ralf Hanson, a benefactor of the church.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of charitable gifts were: John Gostin, of 800\r\n  bushels of coal; Mary Baynham, of £5 : 4s.; Thomas Bulley, Esq., of\r\n  £15 for the minister and poor; William Winter, of £30 for the\r\n  education of six boys. Six boys were taught to read and write, and,\r\n  when qualified, put out as apprentices, with each of whom was given\r\n  £10, in accordance with the will of William Winter.\r\n\r\n=Hart Street, Crutched Friars, Seething Lane.=—These streets may all be\r\ntaken together. The most remarkable historical association of the\r\nstreets is the Crutched Friars’ House, on the site of which was\r\nafterwards erected the Navy Office. The square court of the office,\r\nwhich had one entrance in Crutched Friars and another in Seething Lane,\r\nwas originally the cloister garth of the convent. The Navy Office has\r\nbeen removed, but the square remains, and one may still see the lions\r\nthat were placed at the principal entrance. Pepys lived for nine years\r\nin Seething Lane so as to be near his office. Sir Francis Walsingham\r\nlived and died in this street, and here the Earl of Essex had his town\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WHITTINGTON’S HOUSE, CRUTCHED FRIARS, 1796\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe monastery of the Crutched or Crossed Friars was founded in 1298. The\r\nsymbol was a cross worn upon their habit; this cross was made of red\r\ncloth. Henry VIII. granted their house to Sir Thomas Wyatt, who built a\r\nnew mansion on part of the site.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the house, the site of the church became a\r\n“Carpenter’s yard, a tennis court, and the like.” The Friars’ Hall\r\nbecame a glasshouse until 1575, when it was destroyed by fire. There\r\nappear to be no remains at all of the monastic buildings. For account,\r\nsee _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 342.\r\n\r\nIt was in Crutched Friars that the massive fragment of the three seated\r\ngoddesses, the _Dea Matres_, was found.\r\n\r\nHere were the Milbourne Almshouses.\r\n\r\n“Concerning this gift of Sir John Milbourn, it appears by Dolphin’s will\r\nthat he built thirteen Almshouses in his Life time on a Plot of Ground\r\nin the Parish of St. Olave’s near the Tower Algate Ward, next adjoining\r\non the South part of the Choir, or Chancel of the Conventual Church of\r\nthe Priory of Crossed Friers of London, and the Convent of the said\r\nPlace, within the Precinct sometime of their House.”\r\n\r\nPepys’ connection with Seething Lane has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn Hart Street lived Sir Richard Whittington; his house was round a\r\ncourtyard entered by a gateway not far from Mark Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ST. OLAVE, HART STREET\r\n\r\n  This church is at the corner of Hart Street and Seething Lane. It\r\n  was formerly called St. Olave Juxta-Turrim. The date of its\r\n  foundation is unknown, but the present building was probably\r\n  constructed during the fifteenth century. Stow speaks of Richard and\r\n  Robert Cely as the “principal builders and benefactors,” but gives\r\n  no date. It was expensively repaired early in the reign of Charles\r\n  I. and again in 1863 and 1870, when several interesting relics were\r\n  transferred from Allhallows Staining, which was annexed. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1314.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of the family of\r\n  Nevils, 1281, from whom it passed to John Luffwick, and others about\r\n  1398, and so passed to several private persons, up to 1557, when it\r\n  came to the Windsor family, from whom it passed to Sir Andrew\r\n  Riccard, Knt., who in 1672 bequeathed it to trustees for the parish,\r\n  of whom there are five.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 1435.\r\n\r\n  The present church is built in the Perpendicular style, and contains\r\n  two side aisles separated from the central portion by clustered\r\n  columns and pointed arches with a clerestory above. It is one of the\r\n  smallest of the City churches being a square of only 54 feet.\r\n\r\n  There are many interesting monuments, the most ancient of which is a\r\n  brass in memory of Sir Richard Haddon, mercer, twice Lord Mayor\r\n  (1506 and 1512). On the east wall of the south aisle William Turner\r\n  is commemorated, Dean of Wells and physician to Protector Somerset;\r\n  he was the author of a botanical book, _Herbal_, the first of its\r\n  kind published in English. Against the north wall there is a\r\n  monument to Sir Andrew Riccard (d. 1672), one of the greatest\r\n  merchants of his age. The most interesting person connected with\r\n  this church is Samuel Pepys, the Diarist, Secretary to the Admiralty\r\n  in 1673, and President of the Royal Society 1684-85. He was buried\r\n  here in 1703, and a monument erected to him in 1884 and unveiled by\r\n  the late James Russell Lowell. His colleague, Admiral Sir John\r\n  Mennis, is also commemorated by a tablet at the south end of the\r\n  chancel; he was Comptroller of the Navy and part author of _Musarum\r\n  Deliciae_. In the parish register the baptism of Robert Devereux,\r\n  3rd Earl of Essex, is entered; he commanded the parliamentary forces\r\n  at the outbreak of the Civil War.\r\n\r\n  The most notable of the benefactors to this parish were: Sir John\r\n  Worstenholm, donor of £100; Andrew Windsores, of £6 : 13 : 4; Sir\r\n  James Dean, of £5 : 4s.\r\n\r\n  In Crutched Friars there were fifteen almshouses belonging to the\r\n  Drapers Company for as many decayed freemen of that Company and\r\n  their wives, to whom 5s. per month was allowed and one load of coals\r\n  per annum. In Gunpowder Alley there were ten almshouses (the gift of\r\n  Lord Banyan in 1631, but surrendered to the parish by 1732), which\r\n  allowed each of their poor in that place 1s. to 4s. per week and\r\n  two, three, or four bushels of coals at Christmas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  PEPYS’ CHURCH (ST. OLAVE, HART STREET)\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Dr. Daniel Mills, to whom Samuel Pepys frequently refers in his\r\n  _Diary_, was rector here for thirty-two years.\r\n\r\n=Seething Lane= betrays some characteristic features. A pair of similar\r\neighteenth-century houses with porches stand on each side of the\r\nentrance to Catherine Court. Opposite them are old grimy warehouses.\r\nSucceeding these are huge buildings known as Corn Exchange Chambers. No.\r\n40 on the east is an old stuccoed house, and facing the church are more\r\ntowering warehouses. The churchyard is a quaint little spot, with many\r\ntombstones inclining at every imaginary angle and a few twisted young\r\nelm-trees. The gateway is curious, being surmounted by a peculiar\r\n_chevaux de frise_ of spikes and ornamented by three stuccoed skulls.\r\n\r\nCatherine Court is delightful in its completeness. Every house in the\r\ntwo long sober coloured rows, which face one another across a narrow\r\nflagged space, is of the same date. The date is given on an oval slab\r\nset in the wall at the east end, “Catherine Court, Anno Dom. 1725.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALLHALLOWS BARKING\r\n\r\n  The church of Allhallows Barking stands at the east end of Tower\r\n  Street near Mark Lane Station. It was dedicated to the Blessed\r\n  Virgin Mary and all Saints, whence its name. The date of its\r\n  foundation is unknown, but it is to the convent of Barking that its\r\n  foundation is probably due, which might carry it back to the end of\r\n  the seventh century. It was endowed and enlarged by Richard I.,\r\n  Edward I., and Richard III. During the seventeenth century it was\r\n  repaired five times; it narrowly escaped the Great Fire of 1666.\r\n  There was extensive restoration during the last century. The\r\n  earliest date of an incumbent is 1269.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The kings of\r\n  England, while it was a rectory, 1269; the Abbess and Convent of\r\n  Barking from 1387, when it became a vicarage; the Crown, at the\r\n  suppression in 1540, who exchanged it with the Archbishop of\r\n  Canterbury, who presented in 1584, and in whose successors it\r\n  continues.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 800.\r\n\r\n  The church consists of a nave and chancel together with north and\r\n  south aisles. It is 108 feet in length, 67 feet in breadth, and in\r\n  height 35 feet to the ceiling of the nave, but to that of the aisles\r\n  considerably less. The western portion is older than the chancel,\r\n  and probably the original building only occupied the site of the\r\n  present nave. The massive pillars at the west end are of Norman\r\n  character in contrast to the slender columns of the eastern arches,\r\n  probably not erected before the fifteenth century. The large east\r\n  window, in the Late Decorated style, seems to have been left\r\n  untouched during the numerous alterations of the seventeenth\r\n  century. The present tower, erected in 1659 after the original had\r\n  been destroyed by an explosion, is of plain brick, with a turret and\r\n  weather-vane, and rises above the west end of the nave. The original\r\n  tower rose from the west end of the south aisle. The total height of\r\n  it is 80 feet.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here by: Adam de Blackeneye, citizen, for\r\n  himself and Cecilia his wife, A.D. 1295 (his will, dated 1310);\r\n  Thomas Crolys, and Thomas Pilke, before 1365; John Cade; Robert\r\n  Tate, mayor of London, who died in 1488; Richard I., augmented by\r\n  Edward I., who erected there an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary;\r\n  Edward IV. granted a licence to found a fraternity here (Pat. 9\r\n  Edward IV. p. 2. m. 2). This chapel was newly built by Richard III.,\r\n  who founded a college here consisting of a dean and six canons.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the proximity of the Tower, Allhallows was frequently used\r\n  for the temporary interment of the remains of those who perished on\r\n  the scaffold on Tower Hill. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, Bishop\r\n  Fisher, and Archbishop Laud, found here a temporary grave. Humphrey\r\n  Monmouth, sheriff in 1535, is one of the most notable persons buried\r\n  here. Allhallows contains the best collection of monumental brasses\r\n  to be found in any London church. Some of the most noteworthy are: A\r\n  Flemish brass, in memory of Andrew Evyngar; that of William Thynne,\r\n  one of the earliest editors of Chaucer’s works; William Armer, of\r\n  the Clothworkers Company; and the Tonge brass, the oldest in the\r\n  City. Under the east window of the south aisle is a monument by\r\n  Peter Scheemakers, the sculptor of several monuments in Westminster\r\n  Abbey; the name of the Quaker William Penn is associated with this\r\n  church, where he was baptized in 1644.\r\n\r\n  Some of the donors of charitable gifts were: Margaret Martin, £1 :\r\n  6 : 8 per annum for the poor; William Armer; Alice Polstead, £6 :\r\n  13 : 4 per annum; William Haines, £5 per annum. The parish received\r\n  a very large number of gifts.\r\n\r\n  A school was founded in this parish, 1692, by Alderman Hickson for\r\n  twenty boys. There was also a hospital for the insane, in the time\r\n  of Edward III.\r\n\r\n  The most notable vicar was Thomas Ravis (d. 1609), who became Bishop\r\n  of London.\r\n\r\n=Jewry= was formerly called Poor Jewry Street. This street originally\r\nconsisted of mean tenements, and was greatly improved by the removal of\r\nthe wall which admitted air into the street and gave space for building.\r\nStow says that “in time of old” there were Jews living in this place,\r\nwhence its name. In his time there were only a few poor tenements. The\r\nname “Poor Jewry” is found in the Records of 1438. As the Jews were\r\nbanished in 1290, we may therefore conclude that the name was certainly\r\nolder than that date.\r\n\r\n=Trinity Square=, Tower Hill, is of an irregular shape, including an\r\noval garden. It is named after Trinity House, which stands on the north\r\nside. In Ogilby’s map is a part of Great Tower Hill. Cooper’s Row was\r\nthen called Woodruff Lane; George Street was then George Yard, where was\r\nthe postern of the wall. North of George Street there is still a long\r\npiece of the wall standing within certain warehouses. Here are also\r\nother walls and fireplaces which are said to have belonged to a\r\nworkhouse. I cannot, however, discover that there was any workhouse on\r\nthis spot. This is apparently the same part of the wall that is figured\r\nin Wilkinson’s _Londina Illustrata_.\r\n\r\n=Trinity House.=—Maitland’s account of the house and the corporation is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“In Water Lane is situated Trinity House which belongs to an ancient\r\nCorporation of Mariners, founded in King Henry VIII.’s time, for the\r\nRegulation of Seamen, and security and convenience of ships and mariners\r\non our coasts. In the said King’s reign lived Sir Thos. Spert, Knight,\r\nComptroller of the Navy to that King; who was the first founder and\r\nmaster of the said society of Trinity House; and died Anno 1541, and was\r\nburied in the chancel of Stepney church. To whose memory the said\r\nCorporation, Anno 1622, set up a monument there for him eighty years and\r\none after the decease of the said Spert, their founder. And by an\r\ninscription antienter than that set up by the said corporation, lost\r\nlong since in the church, but preserved by Norden; we learn, that this\r\ngentleman had three wives, Dame Margery, Dame Anne, and Dame Mary, all\r\nlying in the chancel there; and that his Coat of Arms was Two Launces in\r\nSaltier, between four Hearts, on a Chief, a ship with the sails furled.\r\nHe was commander of the biggest ship then that the sea bore, namely,\r\n_Henry Grace de Dieu_, built by King Henry VIII. near the beginning of\r\nhis reign.\r\n\r\n“The house, where the corporation usually meets, belonged to them before\r\nthe great Fire, but how long I know not. They took a long lease and\r\nrebuilt it. This house was burnt down about the year 1718 again, but is\r\nnow by the said Brotherhood built up fairly a second time.\r\n\r\n“This corporation one of the considerablest in the Kingdom, is governed\r\nby a master, four wardens, eight assistants, and the eldest brothers of\r\nthe Company, as they are called, one and thirty in all. The rest of\r\ntheir Company are called Younger Brothers, without any fixed number: For\r\nany seafaring men that will, are admitted into the Society under that\r\nname: But they are not in the Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRINITY HOUSE, TOWER HILL\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Their service and use is, that they appoint all pilots: They set and\r\nplace the buoys and seamarks for the safe direction of ships in their\r\nsailing. For which they have certain duties payable by Merchant-men.\r\nThey can licence poor seamen, antient and past going to sea, to exercise\r\nthe calling of a waterman upon the Thames, and take in fares, tho’ they\r\nhave not been bound to any one free of the Watermen’s Company. They do\r\nmaintain in pensions at this time two thousand poor seamen, or their\r\nwidows; every one of which have at least half-a-crown paid them every\r\nfirst Monday in the month, and some more, besides accidental distressed\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\n“They have three fair Hospitals, built by themselves; two at Deptford,\r\nand one at Mile End, near London. That at Mile End is a very handsome\r\nstructure with a fair chapel, and is peculiar for decayed\r\nSea-Commanders, masters of vessels, or such as have been pilots, and\r\ntheir widows.\r\n\r\n“And thus as they do a great deal of good, so they have large revenues\r\nto do it with: Which arise partly, from sums of money given and\r\nbequeathed unto them for charitable uses, partly from Houses and Lands\r\nalso given them, and particularly and chiefly from ballast. For they\r\nonly have, by Act of Parliament, the benefit of providing ballast for\r\nships in the Thames; and all ships that take in ballast pay them 12d. a\r\nton: For which it is brought to their ship’s side. They have also\r\ncertain light-houses, as at Scilly and Dungeness in the West. To which\r\nHouses all ships pay one half-penny a tun.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Drawn by Schnebbelie._\r\n\r\n  REMAINS OF LONDON WALL, TOWER HILL, 1818\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe house that was burned down in 1718 was again rebuilt and pulled down\r\nin 1787, when the Corporation removed to Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nLastly, in this group of streets, we arrive at =Tower Hill=. The\r\nmemories of this place are summed up by Stow and others.\r\n\r\n“From and without the Tower ditch west and by north is the said Tower\r\nHill, sometime a large plot of ground, nowe greatly strengthened\r\n[straitened] by means of incrochments (unlawfully made and suffered) for\r\ngardens and houses.... Upon this Hil is alwayes readily prepared, at the\r\ncharges of the Citie, a large scaffold, and gallows of timber, for the\r\nexecution of such traitors or other transgressors as are delivered out\r\nof the Tower, or otherwise to the sheriffes of London, by writ, there\r\nwere to be executed.... On the north side of this hill is the said Lord\r\nLumley’s house.”\r\n\r\nThe scaffold was removed about the middle of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nMany were the disputes between the King and the City as to the setting\r\nup of scaffold and gallows, which the King claimed to do, as Tower Hill\r\nwas in the Liberties of the City and not the City itself. Among notable\r\npersons executed there are the names of:\r\n\r\nBishop Fisher, June 22, 1535; Sir Thomas More, July 6, 1535:\r\n\r\n  Going up the scaffold, which was so weak that it was ready to fall,\r\n  he said hurriedly to the Lieutenant, “I pray you, Master Lieutenant,\r\n  see me safe up, and for my coming down let me shift for\r\n  myself.”—Roper’s _Life_.\r\n\r\nCromwell, Earl of Essex, July 28, 1540; Margaret, Countess of\r\nShrewsbury, mother of Cardinal Pole, May 27, 1541; Earl of Surrey the\r\npoet, January 21, 1547; Thomas, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, the Lord\r\nAdmiral, beheaded March 20, 1549, by order of his brother the Protector\r\nSomerset; the Protector Somerset January 22, 1552; Sir Thomas Wyatt,\r\n1554; John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Northumberland, 1553; Lord\r\nGuildford Dudley (husband of Lady Jane Grey), February 12, 1553-54; Sir\r\nGervase Elways or Helwys, Lieutenant of the Tower, hanged for his share\r\nin the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury; Earl of Strafford, May 12, 1641;\r\nArchbishop Laud, January 10, 1644-45; Sir Harry Vane, the younger, June\r\n14, 1662 (“The trumpets were brought under the scaffold that he might\r\nnot be heard”); William Howard, Lord Viscount Stafford, December 29,\r\n1680, beheaded on the perjured evidence of Titus Oates and others;\r\nAlgernon Sidney, December 7, 1683:\r\n\r\n  Algernon Sidney was beheaded this day; died very resolutely, and\r\n  like a true rebel, and republican.—Duke of York to Prince of Orange,\r\n  December 7, 1683.\r\n\r\nDuke of Monmouth, July 15, 1685; Sir John Fenwick, January 28, 1697;\r\nEarl of Derwentwater and Lord Kenmuir, implicated in the Rebellion of\r\n1715; Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino, August 18, 1746:\r\n\r\n  Kilmarnock was executed first and then the scaffold was immediately\r\n  new strewn with sawdust, the block new covered, the executioner new\r\n  dressed, and a new axe brought. Then old Balmerino appeared,\r\n  treading the scaffold with the air of a general, and reading\r\n  undisturbed the inscription on his coffin.—Walpole to Mann, August\r\n  21, 1746.\r\n\r\nSimon, Lord Lovat, April 9, 1747. He was not only the last person\r\nbeheaded on Tower Hill, but the last person beheaded in this country.\r\nThe Tribulation on Tower Hill, mentioned by Shakespeare, has puzzled his\r\ncommentators; the reference seems to be to a Puritan congregation, but\r\nit is hard to see why they should be ready to endure “the youths that\r\nthunder at a playhouse.”\r\n\r\n“_Porter._ These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse, and fight\r\nfor bitten apples; that no audience but the Tribulation of Tower Hill,\r\nor the limbs of Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to\r\nendure.”—Shakespeare, _Henry VIII._, Act v. Scene 4.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 Marillac, the French Ambassador, lived on Tower Hill, and the\r\nDuke of Norfolk (son of the victor of Flodden) and his brother, Lord\r\nWilliam Howard, frequently paid him “mysterious midnight visits.” Lady\r\nRaleigh lodged on Tower Hill while her husband was a prisoner in the\r\nTower.\r\n\r\n“The Lady Raleighe must understand his Ma^{ts} Expresse Will and\r\ncommandment that she resort to her house on Tower Hill or ellswhere\r\nw^{th} her women and sonnes to remayne there, and not to lodge hereafter\r\nw^{th}in the Tower.”—Orders concerning the Tower of London, to be\r\nobserved by the Lieutenant (Sir Wade’s Reg., 1605, 1611; Addit. MSS.\r\nBrit. Mus., No. 14,044).\r\n\r\nWilliam Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, was born on Tower Hill,\r\nOctober 14, 1644.\r\n\r\n“Your late honoured father dwelt upon Great Tower Hill on the east side,\r\nwithin a court adjoining to London Wall.”—P. Gibson to William Penn, the\r\nQuaker (_Sir W. Penn’s Life_, 615).\r\n\r\nAt a public-house on Tower Hill, known by the sign of the Bull, whither\r\nhe had withdrawn to avoid his creditors, it is said Otway, the poet,\r\ndied of want, April 14, 1685; but the precise locality and manner of his\r\ndeath are disputed. In a cutler’s shop on Tower Hill Felton bought the\r\nknife with which he stabbed the first Duke of Buckingham of the Villiers\r\nfamily; it was a broad, sharp hunting knife, and cost one shilling. The\r\nsecond duke often repaired in disguise to the lodging of a poor person,\r\n“about Tower Hill,” who professed skill in horoscopes. Smith has\r\nengraved a view of a curious old house on Tower Hill, enriched with\r\nmedallions, evidently of the age of Henry VIII., and similar to those at\r\nold Whitehall and at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nHatton, writing in 1708, describes Tower Hill as a place where there are\r\n“many good new buildings mostly inhabited by gentry and merchants.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TOWER OF LONDON\r\n\r\n                            By W. J. LOFTIE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  BLOCK, AXE, AND SCAVENGER’S DAUGHTER\r\n]\r\n\r\nRomance has been more busy with this one building than with all the\r\nother edifices of England put together. A volume might be filled with\r\nthe stories founded in the imaginations of Harrison Ainsworth and his\r\npredecessors and imitators. The benefactors, about whose doings he has\r\nso much to tell, were first appointed here by Edward VI., to the number\r\nof fifteen from the Yeomen of the Guard. The interesting drawings made\r\nby George Cruikshank of chambers in towers now long since restored away\r\nor otherwise destroyed have been mixed up with fictitious pictures of\r\nLady Jane kneeling at a _prie-Dieu_ on a straw-strewn scaffold, while a\r\nhangman brandishes an axe; or of the burning of a sorcerer in the\r\nconfined space of Tower Green, with flames which would have been\r\nsufficient to consume the buildings of the whole fortress. Many as were\r\nthe inhabitants from time to time, many as were the prisoners, great or\r\nsmall, no “executions,” that is, no putting to death by process of law,\r\never took place within the precincts, except those of four ladies of the\r\ncourt of Henry VIII. and one other under Queen Mary, while political\r\nconsiderations and fear of a popular movement in favour of the culprit\r\nled to the death in the same semi-private place of one of Queen\r\nElizabeth’s some time favourites, Essex. To believe the tale-writers,\r\nthe Tower and its courtyards were ordinary places of public punishment.\r\nIt is often remarked as a matter of surprise that no blocks, no axes\r\nhave remained like jewels and inscriptions in various stone towers. But\r\nif we ask why there should be any, we get no answer. The block long\r\nshown is probably an ordinary chopping block for faggots and of no great\r\nantiquity. The axe is of Roman make, and is known to have been brought\r\nhere in 1687. Some curious correspondence is in existence as to the\r\npreparation of a block by the Sheriff of Middlesex for the decapitation\r\nof Lord Lovat. The culprit was so old, obese, and infirm that it was\r\nproposed to arrange for the provision of block at which he could kneel\r\nwithout lying down, and some measurements were, it is believed,\r\nfurnished to the Sheriff with this object. I well remember as a child\r\nbeing permitted, in the old Tower Armoury, to lay my head on Queen Anne\r\nBoleyn’s block, as it was called. But Queen Anne, we know, had no block,\r\nand was kneeling up when the French executioner, sent by Lord Wentworth,\r\nthen Governor of Calais, cut off her head by the sweep of a sword.\r\nAlmost as unfortunate as Ainsworth’s anachronisms are those of\r\ninnumerable historical writers who confound the Constable with the\r\nLieutenant and both with the Tower Major.\r\n\r\nThings are very different now, from the visitors’ point of view, to what\r\nthey were years ago or less. In those days the so-called “Horse Armoury”\r\nwas the principal object of attraction. This was built as a long wooden\r\nshed on the south side of the White Tower, and was filled with\r\nfictitious figures on which some of the ancient armour was shown as that\r\nof successive English kings from the Conqueror to James II. We emerged\r\nfrom this gallery by a staircase which led us up into the crypt of the\r\nNorman chapel through a window in the apse. It was impossible for any\r\none who had not previously undergone architectural training to recognise\r\nthe crypt in “Queen Elizabeth’s Armoury,” as this chamber was called. A\r\npriest’s cubicle in the side wall was pointed out as “Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh’s dungeon,” but the Queen’s robe, covered with mock jewelry, was\r\nan object of far greater interest. At every point make-believe was the\r\nrule, and when we at last visited a great hall, the roof, side-walls,\r\nand pillars of which bristled with swords, bayonets, flint locks, and\r\nother similar adornments, our powers of recognising that we were\r\ntraversing the rooms of the White Tower, which, before the reign of\r\nHenry III., formed the principal residence of Rufus, Beauclerc, and\r\nother descendants of the Conqueror, were completely obscured. We could\r\nperhaps see that we had been made parties to a fiction which dwarfed the\r\nmost flagrant of Ainsworth or even Victor Hugo, but better counsels\r\nprevailed when Hepworth Dixon pointed out, in his two volumes entitled\r\n_Her Majesty’s Tower_, the great educational value of a visit to these\r\nancient precincts and the difficulty, under existing arrangements, of\r\nobtaining any clear ideas. By degrees everything has been changed. The\r\nvisitor can pause at every step and can obtain without difficulty the\r\nfullest information. In one particular, a serious mistake was committed.\r\nThe inscribed stones in the Beauchamp Tower were removed and grouped in\r\na single chamber, and it was not perceived till too late that thus they\r\nlost more than half their historical value and all that kind of value\r\nwhich may be termed sentimental. There are inscriptions in all the\r\ninhabited buildings, and it is satisfactory to know that the mistake has\r\nnot been repeated, while the example, coupled with the modern aspect of\r\nthe Beauchamp Tower, forms a useful lesson for would-be architectural\r\nrestorers.\r\n\r\nThe Tower of London formed the principal feature of a system of\r\nfortification by which William the Norman proposed at once to defend\r\nLondon from without and to prevent the Londoners from rebellion against\r\nhis authority. The other castles are generally supposed to be those of\r\nWallingford and of Berkhampstead. Here, as a feature of Alfred’s rebuilt\r\nRoman Wall, there was a bastion of extra size, and there are supposed\r\nreferences to a building which may have stood on the site afterwards\r\ncovered by the Norman Keep, or possibly a little lower on the line of\r\nthe Roman Wall, where the Wakefield Tower, much altered, now serves for\r\nthe preservation and exhibition of the crown jewels.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Keep has been known at least since the time of Henry III. as\r\nthe White Tower. It was commenced in or near 1078, the architect being\r\nGundulf, Bishop of Rochester, who seems to have laboured here, at\r\nRochester Cathedral and Castle, at West Malling, and probably in other\r\nplaces until well on in the reign of Henry I. When, in 1108, he died,\r\nhis works here and elsewhere were still uncompleted. He probably left\r\nthe Keep, to which there was no entrance except by a system of\r\nscaffolding and ladders connected with the Cold Harbour Tower and the\r\nWakefield Tower by strong walls enclosing a narrow triangular court. The\r\nprecinct surrounding this fortress gradually grew partly within, partly\r\nwithout, the City boundaries, until it extended over the Outer Ward, as\r\nfar as the Bell Tower to the west, the Devereux on the north, and the\r\nMartin on the east. It included the parish church, afterwards known as\r\nSt. Peter’s, and the Lanthorn Tower on the south-east, part of an\r\nextension of the royal apartments. Adjoining the palace there was a\r\nlittle later, say, in the reign of Henry III., an open space or “garden”\r\nsouth of the White Tower. What had formed the Outer Ward of the Norman\r\nCastle now became the Inner Ward of still more extensive precincts under\r\nRichard and John. Bishop Longchamp took in a further tract to eastward.\r\nKing John in 1210 and later years strengthened himself against the\r\nBarons of Magna Charta by increasing the outer fortifications, and work\r\nwent on constantly during the long reign of Henry III. and did not add\r\nto his popularity with London citizens. Under Edward I. we first hear of\r\nthe Barbican, afterwards, down to 1834, known as the Lion Tower. There\r\nare two interesting views of this building in Ainsworth’s book: one\r\nevidently a careful woodcut of Cruikshank’s drawing on the spot before\r\nthe destruction of the building; the other an etching with imaginary\r\nfigures. Outside the defences at this corner was the so-called Conning\r\nor Con Tower, a building of timber, opening into a narrow passage. It\r\nled out at right angles to the north. The wooden gate, on this site,\r\nstill faces this way, and it is probable that not only the Tower gates\r\nbut the City gates at Newgate and Bishopsgate were similarly planned, a\r\npoint too often forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1347 gunpowder was made in the Tower for the French wars of\r\nEdward III.—“pulvis pro ingeniis suis,” as we read. The Salt Tower must\r\nhave received its name from the storage of saltpetre. In 1381 Richard\r\nII. was lodged here for safety from Wat Tyler’s mob; and here they\r\nseized the Archbishop Sudbury and murdered him. It was here in 1399 that\r\nRichard II. surrendered the crown to Henry IV. Jack Cade’s mob attacked\r\nthe Tower unsuccessfully. It was attacked again ten years later with a\r\nsimilar result, and after this period the history of the fortress as a\r\nfortress may be said to terminate.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the Tower combined the functions of a palace and a prison\r\nit became customary for every new sovereign to ride in state to the\r\ncoronation at Westminster through the City from the gate of the Tower.\r\nThus it was that Queen Anne (Boleyn), who had figured in such a\r\nprocession, was afterwards a prisoner and was here condemned to death\r\nand beheaded on Tower Green. Here again her daughter, Elizabeth, after\r\nhaving been a prisoner during the reign of her sister Mary, passed out\r\nto her coronation, pausing on the way at the Lion Tower, where in a\r\nshort prayer she compared herself to Daniel emerging in safety from the\r\nlion’s den. The last English king who thus went to Westminster was\r\nCharles II. He and his brother James II. were lodged in the Tower on\r\nseveral occasions of public danger, but the Civil War, then recently\r\nended, had shown plainly the weakness of mediæval fortification against\r\nartillery. At the time of the death of Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, who\r\nin 1683 committed suicide or was murdered in his lodgings in the\r\nLieutenant’s House, both Charles and his brother were in the royal\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tower ceased to be used as a palace, the old buildings to the\r\nsouth of the Keep fell into ruin and have now all disappeared. They\r\nincluded an annex of some size and importance which contained a few\r\nRoman bricks, possibly taken from such parts of the wall as here reached\r\nthe river’s bank. The garden disappeared with the hall and the wardrobe,\r\nand even the names of the buildings adjoining were changed. The Garden\r\nTower is now called the Bloody, and the odd reason used to be given that\r\nit was because here the sons of Edward IV. were smothered. This is\r\nextremely unlikely, and the name of the gateway was more likely derived\r\nfrom the supposed suicide of Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland,\r\nwho was found dead in his bed with three bullets through his heart on\r\nJune 21, 1585. The Hall Tower, since the disappearance of the adjoining\r\nHall (in which Queen Anne Boleyn was tried), has been renamed _The\r\nWakefield_, and here the regalia, described below, are now shown. This\r\nis the sole relic, with the White Tower, of the Norman buildings of\r\nGundulf. There is a Norman crypt, but the upper structure has been\r\n“restored” away, with large but unsightly windows, and there is a bridge\r\nfor the convenience of the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, whose apartments\r\nare in St. Thomas’s Tower, usually renamed _The Traitors Gate_. Between\r\nthe archway of this gate and the _Byward Tower_, the chief entrance from\r\nthe outer ward, is a long wall, facing which, on the north side of the\r\nnarrow roadway, the buildings of the Lieutenant’s Lodgings look over the\r\nwalls of the inner ward, ending with the _Bell Tower_. The bell now does\r\nduty at St. Peter’s Church. The roadway is continued to the north as\r\nMint Street, which further on used to be known as Irish Mint Street.\r\nFrom the corner under the Bell Tower we see the _Beauchamp Tower_, and\r\nbeyond it again the _Devereux_. There is a walk along the leads of the\r\nroofs connecting the Bell with the Devereux, and here, it is said by the\r\nromance writers, Lady Jane, confined in the Lieutenant’s Lodgings, used\r\nto meet her husband, who carved her name in his chamber in the Beauchamp\r\nTower. The Lieutenant’s Lodgings have of late been renamed _The King’s\r\nHouse_, and in the late reign, the Queen’s House, a change for which no\r\nreason has ever been assigned.\r\n\r\nThe towers along the south curtain of the outer ward are the _Cradle_,\r\nso named probably from an arrangement for receiving supplies from a boat\r\non the Thames, the _Well_, and the _Develin_ or Galleyman’s, so named\r\nafter an old warder. On the north side are three comparatively modern\r\nforts, called _Legge’s Mount_, _North Bastion_, and _Brass Mount_, the\r\nfirst from George Legge, Lord Dartmouth, Master General of the Ordnance\r\nin 1682.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the inner ward are some old and, for the most\r\npart, unrestored buildings known as _Martin’s Tower_, at the\r\nnorth-eastern corner; _Constable’s Tower_, _Broad Arrow_, and the _Salt\r\nTower_, already mentioned. The regalia used to be kept in the Martin,\r\nwhich was also known as the Burbidge or Brick Tower. Here in 1671 the\r\ncrown, then in the custody of Talbot Edwards, was stolen by Colonel\r\nBlood, who carried it nearly to the gate of the Byward Tower before he\r\nwas stopped. He was eventually pardoned by Charles II. The Broad Arrow\r\nshows us what some of us remember—the Beauchamp before Salvin’s ruthless\r\n“restoration.”\r\n\r\nThe Church of _St. Peter ad Vincula_ was so called from the Romanist\r\nsaint’s day, August 1, on which it was consecrated, and not from any\r\nallusion to the Tower as a prison. It has often of late been described\r\nas a Chapel Royal, but if there is any Chapel Royal in the Tower it is\r\nSt. John’s. What we now see was built in 1512, after a fire. The old\r\nchurch was long vacant because of the murder, by the parson, of a friar\r\nnamed Randolph in 1419. Edward IV. proposed to place here a dean and\r\nchapter, but died before anything was arranged. Edward VI. put the\r\nchurch under the care of the Bishop of London, and it has since usually\r\nbeen served by a chaplain appointed by the Crown. The organ was formerly\r\nin the Chapel Royal at Whitehall. There are few monuments, but the\r\nburial-places in the chancel of the headless bodies of two of the wives\r\nof Henry VIII., as well as of the Dukes of Somerset and Northumberland\r\nand some others, are marked by an encaustic pavement, highly\r\ninappropriate to what Lord Macaulay described as the saddest spot on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThere are several oratories in the different towers, as, for example,\r\nthe apartments over the Traitors’ Gate, known as St. Thomas’s Tower,\r\nwhere the Keeper of the Jewels is lodged. A similar place for private\r\nprayer in the Wakefield Tower has been in great part obliterated. Here,\r\naccording to an ancient tradition, the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards\r\nRichard III., stabbed Henry VI. at his devotions in 1471.\r\n\r\nThe yeoman waiters or warders are not Yeomen of the Guard, but members\r\nof a separate corps. There are forty yeomen, all old soldiers and\r\nranking as sergeant majors in the army. They seemed to have been called\r\nbeefeaters from the very beginning in Tudor times. The word “yeomen” is\r\noften reckoned as “gentlemen,” being next below “esquire.” They were\r\nonly fifteen at first, but Charles II. improved their position and\r\nincreased their numbers. Part of their duty used to be to assist the\r\nyeoman gaoler in the custody of prisoners. Persons condemned were by\r\nthem handed over to the Sheriff of Middlesex at the Con Gate, where the\r\nCity and Tower precincts meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE JEWELS\r\n\r\nThe crown and other parts of the regalia of the state were long\r\ntreasured in the Martin Tower. They were previously in a building\r\nadjoining the palace, on the south side of the White Tower. The removal\r\ntook place about 1641, which may be the date at which the palace\r\nbuildings were finally pulled down. There had been a “secret jewell\r\nhouse” in the White Tower in which the most precious or venerable\r\nobjects were kept. At the time of the Great Rebellion they were taken to\r\nWestminster and were all broken up and, as far as possible, destroyed.\r\nThis sacrilege, for so it must be called, took place in 1649, in the\r\nAugust which followed the death of Charles I. A certain number of\r\narticles were sent back to the Tower, no doubt to be melted down at the\r\nMint. These last included “Queen Edith’s crown” of silver-gilt and “King\r\nAlfred’s crown” of gold wirework, with a few slight jewels set in it and\r\ntwo bells. This must have been an object of the highest antiquity,\r\nperhaps reaching back to the eleventh century. It need hardly be\r\nremarked that “Queen Edith” is a wholly mythical person in this\r\nconnection, no wife of a sovereign of the house of Wessex being called\r\n“Queen” or wearing a crown. The Confessor’s wife was “the lady Edith,”\r\nhis mother “the old lady.” There is no saying what England lost by the\r\nwholesale destruction of these old crowns. There is a certain\r\nsatisfaction in reflecting that the Roundhead treasury was not greatly\r\nbenefited, the value of the objects sold or melted amounting only to\r\n£14,221 : 15 : 4. The Crown jewels as we see them now consist mainly of\r\nthose required at a coronation, but the old “Regalia” comprised “one\r\nchristall pott” standing on crystal balls and mounted with silver gilt,\r\nwith a mannikin on the handle, valued then at £9; two gold trencher\r\nplates at £85; more than two dozen crystal cups mounted in gold, and\r\nmany set with jewels; crystal and gold dishes; a crystal watch, valued\r\nat £30; salt-cellars of all kinds of precious materials; twenty-six\r\nagate bowls and cups—agate was thought to protect the drinker against\r\npoison; mazers, some mounted in gold; an “old rusty knife, forke, and\r\nspoone,” garnished with gold—it is often asserted that Charles II.\r\nbrought in the use of forks, but there were several forks in the old\r\ncollection; candlesticks; an old woman of gold for a salt-cellar, and\r\nnumerous objects of mother-of-pearl. In addition there were many single\r\nstones, and among them “one ruby ballass pierced, and wrapt in a paper\r\nby itselfe, valued at £4.” The Puritan framers of the catalogue did not\r\ndare evidently to call any attention to the historical and monarchical\r\nassociations of this stone. It remained unsold until Oliver Cromwell\r\ncoming into sole power, and perhaps foreseeing that, if he lived, these\r\nthings might be useful in a coronation, stopped the sale and destruction\r\nof the Crown jewels. This ruby, though it is not of first-rate quality\r\nand is pierced, was saved and is identified by antiquaries as the jewel\r\nwhich Peter, King of Castile, gave to the Black Prince in 1367, as part\r\npayment, it is supposed, for his help in the battle of Najera. Peter,\r\nwho received the name of “the Cruel,” is said to have fought the Moorish\r\nking of Grenada for the sake of his jewels, of which this was one, and\r\nto have murdered him in cold blood. Henry V. wore it at Agincourt, in\r\n1415, in his helmet. Another relic of the old regalia is the sapphire in\r\nthe front of the circlet. It was carried away by James II. when he left\r\nEngland in 1688, and was restored by Cardinal York (Henry IX.) by will,\r\nwith some other jewels, to George III., in 1807. Another sapphire\r\nfigures in the cross on the summit of the State crown, as it did on that\r\nof Queen Victoria. Its history points to its having been worn by Edward\r\nthe Confessor in a ring. The legend connecting it with the present\r\nregalia is in the _Coronation Book of Edward VII._, p. 56 (Cassell and\r\nCompany, 1902). A silver-gilt spoon of thirteenth-century work, possibly\r\nof twelfth, is the only other object known to have been in the old\r\nregalia.\r\n\r\nThe other objects exhibited were chiefly made for the coronation of\r\nCharles II. Silver or silver-gilt plate of that period is very scarce,\r\nand the examples before us, most of which were made by Sir Robert Vyner,\r\nare of the highest quality of which the period was capable. It is not\r\nnecessary to go through the different items of which the collection\r\nconsists. It will be sufficient to warn the visitor that when he reads\r\non the label “Crown of St. Edward,” he must take it as if the words were\r\n“Crown (made by Vyner in imitation of that in the old regalia called the\r\nCrown) of St. Edward.” The State crown was worn by King Edward VII. at\r\nhis coronation and is the same as that of Queen Victoria, somewhat\r\nenlarged. It is of silver and has about 3000 diamonds, 227 pearls, 5\r\nrubies, 17 sapphires, and 11 emeralds. The Sword of State was carried by\r\nthe Marquis of Londonderry, the Sceptre by the Duke of Argyll, and the\r\nSword of Mercy by the Duke of Grafton. At the coronation of George III.\r\nthe sword was forgotten and was left behind in St. James’s Palace. The\r\nLord Mayor’s sword was borrowed in the Abbey and was borne by the Earl\r\nof Huntingdon. The right sword was, however, brought and laid on the\r\naltar before the close of the service. At the coronation of George IV.\r\nit was carried by the Duke of Dorset, and at that of William IV. by the\r\nDuke of Wellington. At the coronation of Queen Victoria the sword was\r\nborne by Lord Melbourne. Three other swords were borne at the coronation\r\nof George IV., those, namely, of temporal justice, of spiritual justice,\r\nand of mercy.\r\n\r\nA visitor who has time should not leave the Wakefield Tower without\r\nseeing an interesting series of stars, collars, and badges of the\r\ndifferent orders of knighthood. They are exhibited in the side cases, as\r\nare also the silver trumpets of the Guards and other objects of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ARMOURY\r\n\r\nAlthough great stores of arms were accumulated in the Tower during the\r\nTudor reigns, we do not know of any special collection of ornamental\r\nsuits until much later. The armourers of Henry VIII.—men from Italy, and\r\nin particular from Milan and Mantua, whence such words as milliner,\r\nportmanteau, and others—dwelt and worked at Greenwich, where in the\r\nGreen Chamber were twelve suits of tilting armour for men and horses, in\r\nthe Great Chamber, nine, and in the Harness Chamber, seven, some of them\r\nstill incomplete when the inventory was made in 1631. The tilting suits\r\nwere removed to the Tower in 1660. Previously the arms stored there were\r\nchiefly for soldiers, and comprised, in the reign of Elizabeth, 2000\r\nequipments for foot-soldiers, known as demi-lances, as many corslets,\r\n1000 shirts of mail, 3000 morions or helmets, and as many steel caps,\r\ncalled “skulles” in the inventory. Towards the end of the reign the more\r\nornamental horse and tilting armour began to be brought up from\r\nGreenwich, but the removal was not complete till the time of Charles\r\nII., when the old palace was pulled down to make way for the first\r\nbuildings of what is now Greenwich Hospital.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the picturesque building, now used as a military hospital,\r\nwas designed by Sir Christopher Wren for the reception of the armour.\r\nAbout the same time, Wren’s friend, Grinling Gibbons, was employed to\r\ncarve the horses on which the full knightly panoply could be exhibited.\r\nSome of these horses still remain and must be admired as real works of\r\nart. Previously, no doubt, the equestrian armour was placed upon horses\r\nsuch as are now called clothes-horses in a house, or saddle horses in a\r\nharness room, convenient enough for the purpose, but unsuitable for any\r\nscenic effect.\r\n\r\nThe armour was next removed to the Small Armoury. The name does not mean\r\nthat the building was small, but that it was designed for the storage\r\nand exhibition of small arms, as distinguished from cannon and other\r\ngreat guns. It was situated where the Waterloo Barracks are now, and was\r\nentirely destroyed by fire in 1841, having become a store and being full\r\nof inflammable material. It must have resembled the central part of the\r\ngreat barrack at Winchester, built also by Wren. It was 245 feet long by\r\n60 wide. Founded by James II., it was finished by William and Mary, who\r\nat the opening dined in the great room in state “having all the warrant\r\nworkmen and labourers to attend them, dressed in white gloves and\r\naprons, the usual badges of the orders of masonry,” as Dodsley tells us,\r\nwriting in 1761. The “entablature and triangular pediment of the Doric\r\norder” of which he speaks, “and the king’s arms, with enrichments of\r\ntrophy work,” were saved, and are now built into a wall on the south\r\nside of a storehouse near the new Lanthorn Tower. The great Small\r\nArmoury was undisturbed in 1821, but large quantities of weapons had\r\noverflowed into the White Tower, where an armourer named Harris, whose\r\noperations were much admired in their day, with his successors, arranged\r\nthem in various fantastic designs, many of them very ingenious. It was\r\nHarris who made the trophies of arms at Hampton Court. “He was a common\r\ngunsmith, but after he had performed this work, which is the admiration\r\nof people of all nations, he was allowed a pension from the Crown for\r\nhis ingenuity.” This Small Armoury contained, at the time of the fire in\r\n1841, 280 stands of muskets and small arms, ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe horse armoury had fortunately been removed some ten or twelve years\r\nbefore the fire. A shed-like gallery, already mentioned, was built south\r\nof the White Tower, and was ready in 1826, when the collection was\r\nremoved and arranged by Sir Samuel Meyrick. The visitor on entering saw\r\na long line of equestrian figures, twenty-two in number, clothed in the\r\narmour supposed to belong to various reigns from Edward I. to James II.\r\nAs a fact, very little of the armour dated before the time of Henry\r\nVIII., and the chain mail on a figure labelled Edward I. probably came\r\nfrom India. A rearrangement was made by Mr. Hewitt about 1859, and a\r\ncatalogue. Ten years later a further arrangement was carried out by Mr.\r\nPlanché. In 1883, the whole collection was removed to the upper stories\r\nof the White Tower, where it has been examined and put into something\r\nlike order by Lord Dillon, whose views are considerably more scientific\r\nthan those of Meyrick, Hewitt, or Planché. The change in the aspect of\r\nthe collection is considerable, and the visitor may be certain of a\r\ngreat number of pieces of which few could be considered authentic\r\nbefore. Lord Dillon calls attention to the mounted figure in chain mail\r\nwhich used to do duty for Edward I. and before that, for William the\r\nConqueror. There are several other suits of Oriental armour, but this\r\none seems, in part at least, to be Persian. The only dated suit was sent\r\nto Charles II. by the Great Mogul about 1660. In the so-called Council\r\nChamber is a suit worn by Lord Waterford at the Eglinton Tournament. It\r\nshows armour of the time of Richard III. Several suits made for Henry\r\nVIII. are beside it, and some also from Nuremberg of the same date. The\r\nfinest “was sent over in 1514, having been made by Conrad Sensenhofer,\r\nwhose mark is on the helmet. It was a present from the Emperor\r\nMaximilian to his ally and relative, Henry VIII. Another maker is well\r\nrepresented, Missaglia of Milan, by a suit for foot combats. Another\r\nbears the Burgundian “cross ragulé,” which must not be confused with the\r\nragged staff of Robert Dudley, Queen Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester. This\r\nlast-named suit is very rich in extra pieces for the protection of the\r\nleft side in tournaments. Another was worn by Dymoke of Scrivelsby at\r\nthe coronation of George II. It would be tedious to go through all the\r\narmour, but a case in the first room contains an extensive collection of\r\nhelmets, many of them modern imitations, made in Germany, of ancient\r\nforms. “The genuine tilting helmets,” says Lord Dillon, “will be\r\ndistinguished from false ones by the arrangement of the ocularium or eye\r\nslit, which in the modern examples would allow of the easy insertion of\r\nthe opponent’s lance point.”\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while here to observe that in the lists two knights\r\npassed each other on the left hand. In many modern pictures of mediæval\r\nfights we see the knights each with his lance in the right hand and\r\npointing towards another knight on his right. This would have been\r\nimpossible, the weight of the lance alone being sufficient to make it\r\nso. If the combatant struck his opponent, he must infallibly have put\r\nhis shoulder out and probably would also have broken some of his ribs\r\nwith his heavily mailed elbow. In old pictures, and particularly in\r\nthose representing tilt yards, the knights will be seen keeping the “off\r\nside,” the lance being held diagonally across the horse’s neck, the\r\nelbow being free so that no fracture ensues when the point strikes\r\nanything hard. The extra pieces in the so-called Leicester’s suit were,\r\ntherefore, as Lord Dillon points out, “for the tilt yard and protected\r\nthe left side, that on which the riders passed each other.” Pictures in\r\nthe National Gallery and illuminated manuscripts in the British Museum\r\nmay be consulted on this subject.\r\n\r\nOf the more miscellaneous objects in the collection it is not necessary\r\nto say much here. Everything is carefully labelled. There is some Greek\r\nbronze armour from Cumæ near Naples. The series of halberds is\r\nremarkably fine and varied, as are the swords, the maces, early\r\nfire-arms, and gauntlets. We may sum up, in the words of the _Guide_ of\r\n1888, and make up our minds “that of the early linen armour,\r\nsupplemented with iron, of the Bayeux Tapestry, we have no examples\r\nextant; that of the Crusaders and their ‘panoply’ in the twelfth century\r\nwe are almost equally ignorant; that monumental brasses and illuminated\r\nmanuscripts enable us both to judge how the knight was armed in the\r\nthirteenth century, and also to identify a rare helmet here and there as\r\nof the same period; but that for authentic suits of _cap a pie_ and even\r\nmuch less, and for horse armour, apart from mere saddlery or harness, we\r\nmust depend on a period long after the invention and common use of guns\r\nand gunpowder, a period when the skill of the armourer was exercised to\r\nornament tilting suits, defence against fire-arms proving impossible.”\r\n\r\nFor an account of the ancient foundation known as St. Katherine’s by the\r\nTower see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 335.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ST. PETER AD VINCULA\r\n\r\n  For history see p. 292.\r\n\r\n  The earliest date of an incumbent is 1355.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church has always been in the hands of the\r\n  Crown; it was constituted a rectory with a rector and three\r\n  chaplains by Edward III., February 10, 1353-54.\r\n\r\n  The chapel consists of a nave and chancel and an aisle on the north\r\n  side, separated from the nave by columns of the Decorated period of\r\n  architecture. It is 66 feet in length, 54 feet in width, and 25 feet\r\n  in height.\r\n\r\n  In this church are buried: Anne Boleyn; Katherine Howard; Sir Thomas\r\n  More; Cromwell, Earl of Essex; Lady Shrewsbury; Admiral Lord\r\n  Seymour; the Protector Somerset; John Dudley, Earl of\r\n  Northumberland; Lady Jane Grey; Lord Guilford Dudley; Sir Thomas\r\n  Overbury; Sir John Elcot; Okey the Regicide; the Duke of Monmouth;\r\n  Lords Lovat, Kilmarnock, and Balmerino, and others of lesser note.\r\n\r\n=The Minories= lies within Portsoken Ward. Stow says:\r\n\r\n“This Portsoken which roundeth as much as the Franchise at the gate, was\r\nsometime a guilde and had this beginning as I have reade. In the dayes\r\nof King Edgar more than 600 yeres since, there were thirteen knights\r\nwellbeloved to the king and realme (for service by them done) which\r\nrequested to name a certain portion of land on the east part of the\r\nCitte, left desolate and forsaken by the inhabitants by reason of too\r\nmuch servitude. They besought the king to have this land, with the\r\nLibertie of a guilde for ever; the king granted to their request with\r\nconditions following that is that each of them should victoriously\r\naccomplish three combates, one above the ground, one under ground, and\r\nthe thirde in the water, and after this at a certaine day in East\r\nSmithfield they should run with speares against all commers, all which\r\nwas gloriously performed.”\r\n\r\nOf the Minories, Stow says:\r\n\r\n“From the west part of this Tower Hill towards Ealdegate being a long\r\ncontinual street amongst other smaller buildings in that row there was\r\nsometimes an abbey of Nunnes of the order of St. Clare called the\r\nMinories.”\r\n\r\nThis abbey was founded in 1293 by Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, King Edward\r\nI.’s brother, and was suppressed in 1539. For account see _Mediæval\r\nLondon_, vol. ii. p. 329.\r\n\r\nThe Minories was later noted for its gunsmiths. “In place of this house\r\nof Nunnes is now builded divers faire and large houses, for armour, and\r\nthe habiliments of war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HOLY TRINITY, MINORIES\r\n\r\n  On the suppression of the abbey its chapel became a parish church\r\n  for the inhabitants of the old monastic precincts. It escaped the\r\n  Great Fire, but was entirely rebuilt in 1706, at the expense of\r\n  Daniel King, Lady Pritchard and the parishioners. The earliest date\r\n  of an incumbent is 1595.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church originally in the hands of the Crown\r\n  passed by its union with St. Botolph, Aldgate (1899), to the Bishop\r\n  of London.\r\n\r\n  The building is very unpretentious. Since 1899 it has been used as a\r\n  Sunday School and parish institute. It has no proper tower, only a\r\n  turret at the west end. There is some fine carving at the west end,\r\n  preserved from the old church and bearing the date 1620.\r\n\r\n  No chantries were founded here.\r\n\r\n  The church contains monuments to Colonel William Legge,\r\n  Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance to Charles I. and Charles II.,\r\n  who died in 1672, also his son, first Lord Dartmouth, Admiral of the\r\n  Fleet, who died in 1691. When the vaults were examined in 1849 a\r\n  head was brought to light, said to be that of Henry Grey, Duke of\r\n  Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey, which had been preserved from\r\n  decay by sawdust; it is now kept in a glass case in the vestry of\r\n  St. Botolph, Aldgate. The church was attended by Sir Isaac Newton,\r\n  when Master of the Mint.\r\n\r\n  Daniel King was donor of £200 and Lady Pritchard of £100 in 1706,\r\n  for the rebuilding of the church. No legacies or bequests are\r\n  recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GROUP VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth group of streets in our division of the City contains all\r\nthose streets lying north of St. Paul’s Churchyard and Ludgate Hill.\r\n\r\nWe may consider this group as connected with Newgate Street and the\r\nstreets to the north, and Paternoster Row with the streets and lanes to\r\nnorth and south. These lie partly in the ward of Farringdon Within and\r\npartly in that of Farringdon Without.\r\n\r\nProbably at or before the beginning of the thirteenth century, certainly\r\nin its latter half, the present two wards of Farringdon Without and\r\nFarringdon Within formed but one ward under one alderman. That ward in\r\nearly records is found named, as are most other wards, after its\r\nsuccessive aldermen, thus: “Ward of Anketin de Auvergne” (1276-77)\r\n(Riley’s _Memorials_); “the ward which was that of Ralph le Fevre”\r\n(1278); “Ward of William de Farndone” (1283); “Warda Willelmi de\r\nFarendone infra et extra” (1286-87). Yet just before the last date the\r\nward was called after the two City gates which it contained, thus:\r\n“Warda de Lodgate et Neugate: Willelmus de Farndon [aldermannus]” (_c._\r\n1285) (Sharpe, _Calendar of Wills_); and so it continued some time, for\r\nwe find: “Warda Ludgate et Neugate presentat Nicholaum de Farndon\r\n[aldermannum]” (1293). In each case the whole ward, both within the\r\ngates and without, is intended, but it is said that the part without the\r\ngates was sometime known as the “Ward of Fletestrete” (Riley’s\r\n_Memorials_). In the fourteenth century the name of William de Farendone\r\nbecame permanently attached to this ward, as: [warda] “Farndon Infra\r\n[et] Farndon Extra: Nicholaus de Farndon [aldermannus]” (1319-20)\r\n(Sharpe); [warda] “Farndone infra et extra” (1320) (Riley); “Warda de\r\nFarndone” (1320); “Garde de Faryngdone” (1383). In 1393 the ward was\r\nmade into two wards, each with its separate alderman. Henceforward the\r\naldermanry without the walls was known by an equivalent to the present\r\nstyle, as: “Ward of Farndone Without” (1415) (Riley); “Ward of Faryndone\r\nWithout” (1416) (Riley); “Ward of Faryngdon Without” (1444) (_Catalogue\r\nof Ancient Deeds_); “Warde of Faringdon Extra, or Without” (1598)\r\n(Stow); and so on with varieties of spelling.\r\n\r\nThe Roman gate of the west stood a little to the north of the later\r\ngate. The massive alcoves of the gate were uncovered in Giltspur Street\r\nnear the end of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stow, the “New Gate” was erected by Henry I. to relieve the\r\ntraffic which had been stopped by the enclosures of St. Paul’s Precinct.\r\nFormerly, he said, the traffic had been conducted along a single street\r\nleading from Aldgate to Ludgate. There is evidently some confusion here.\r\nThe “West Gate” is mentioned in a charter dated 857. It is possible that\r\nit means Ludgate; it is not, however, probable that the Saxons allowed\r\nthe trade of the north and the west, which was brought down the great\r\nhighway to the marsh of Thorney and was then, even before the Roman\r\noccupation, diverted along Oxford Street and Holborn, to resume its old\r\ncourse across the Marsh and Thorney Island, or that they would have gone\r\nout of their way to construct a new line of route along the present\r\nPiccadilly and the Strand.\r\n\r\nIt seems perfectly certain that the old line of trade was followed,\r\npartly because trade always does follow in accustomed lines, and partly\r\nbecause there was no reason why it should not do so. I read, therefore,\r\nthe history of Newgate as follows:—The Roman Highway lay along Oxford\r\nStreet and Holborn; it crossed the valley of the Fleet by a causeway\r\nthrough the mud and by a bridge over the stream—the causeway kept in\r\nplace by piles and the bridge also resting on wooden piles. On the other\r\nside, the causeway sloped up the bank to the west gate, which stood on\r\nthe hill as part of the Roman wall. When the Saxons in the sixth century\r\ncame in to the City the causeway and the bridge had been swept away and\r\ndestroyed; the old gate was ruinous. The merchants themselves, when they\r\nresumed the former trade, found it easier to break through the wall than\r\nto clear away the ruins of the old gate. They then made their own\r\ncauseway and built their own bridge over the marshy valley and the\r\nstream. When Alfred restored the walls, he accepted the new gate and\r\nprobably strengthened it, and built up the wall over the old Roman gate.\r\nThis gate it was which Henry I. rebuilt, not, as Stow says, built. By\r\nthis time, however, Ludgate had been opened as a postern; another\r\ncauseway and another bridge had been built across the valley, and houses\r\nwere springing up along the rising ground of Fleet Street and the\r\nStrand. And it is also quite possible that the rebuilding of the gate\r\nled to some reconstruction of the line of way through the City.\r\n\r\nHenry I., therefore, rebuilt New Gate.\r\n\r\nIt was a prison from the first. All the City gates were prisons, the\r\nupper chambers being strong and easily guarded by the permanent watch\r\nbelow. Newgate, however, became a more important prison than any of the\r\nothers, “as appeareth,” says Stow, “by records in the reign of King John\r\nand of other kings.”\r\n\r\nIt would take a whole volume to pass in review the prisoners of Newgate.\r\nLet me take one—an obscure person—because he belongs to the life of\r\nLondon, whereas the better known prisoners belong to the history of the\r\ncountry. It was on the eve of Pentecost, 1388, that William Wotton,\r\nAlderman of Dowgate, went to the Shambles in Newgate Street and asked of\r\none Richard Bole, a butcher, the price of certain pieces of beef.\r\nRichard replied that it was four shillings. “That,” said the Alderman,\r\n“is too dear.” Quoth Richard, impudently, “I do verily believe that the\r\nmeat is too dear for thee; who, I suppose, never bought as much meat as\r\nthat, for thine own use.” Observing, then, that the inquirer wore an\r\nAlderman’s hood, he asked, “Art thou an Alderman?” “Yes,” William Wotton\r\nreplies; “why askest thou?” Whereupon he said, “It is a good thing for\r\nthee and thy fellows, the Aldermen, to be so wise and wary, who make but\r\nlight of riding on the Pavement, as some among ye have been doing.” Here\r\nwe have reference to some grievance of the day. Why should the Aldermen\r\nride upon the pavement? One supposes that the pavement was meant for the\r\nconvenience of the stalls and not intended for horses. It was\r\nconstructed in 1339.\r\n\r\nHowever, William Wotton very speedily had this impudent butcher laid by\r\nthe heels in Newgate. He was haled before the Mayor and sentenced to six\r\nmonths’ imprisonment, after which he was to carry a lighted taper\r\nthrough the Shambles and Chepe as far as St. Lawrence Lane, when he was\r\nto offer his taper at the Guildhall Chapel. His fellows of the same\r\ntrade, however, petitioned, and the imprisonment was remitted; but he\r\nwalked in procession bearing that lighted taper, an object-lesson to\r\nthose who would beard an Alderman.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century the want of ventilation and the confinement of\r\nmany in so narrow a place bred gaol-fever, which never afterwards left\r\nthe prison. In 1419 the gaolers of Newgate all died, and prisoners to\r\nthe number of sixty-four.\r\n\r\nThe case of Hugh le Bever may also be mentioned. He was charged with the\r\nmurder of his wife Alice. He refused to plead. He was therefore taken to\r\nNewgate and there put in penance until his death. That is to say, he was\r\nplaced in solitary confinement—one can still see the narrow cell in the\r\nold gate-prisons (for example, that at Rouen)—and there left to his own\r\nmeditations, with a daily allowance of bread and water. One wonders how\r\nlong the poor wretch lingered there. Perhaps his mind fell into a\r\ncomatose condition in which the days passed on without any other feeling\r\nthan that of blank misery, while the body grew weaker. Perhaps he went\r\nmad. Perhaps he begged to be taken out and hanged. So difficult it was,\r\nso heavy the task of making the people obedient to the law.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century we find a new departure of a remarkable\r\ncharacter. There sprang up a new thing in the land—a feeling of\r\ncompassion for the misery of the unhappy prisoners of Newgate and other\r\ngaols in London. The wills beginning in the year 1348 show bequests for\r\nthe poor prisoners. From 1348 to 1500 the wills published in the\r\n_Calendar_ show eighty-one such bequests. This is very curious. It shows\r\nan humanising influence of some kind—what was it? Not the influence of\r\nmonks and friars, because their spiritual force was fast declining. Was\r\nit the Lollarding with which the City of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies was notoriously “infested”? The question is not easy to\r\nanswer. But the fact remains. Further, we find that light bread was\r\nconfiscated and given to the prisoners of Newgate; that all other kinds\r\nof food when confiscated for any reason, were also sent there; and that\r\nbroken meats were sent to the prison from all men’s tables. It would\r\nappear, therefore, that no food was supplied to prisoners at the time,\r\nan inhuman practice, followed, until their abolition, by all the\r\ndebtors’ prisons, causing for hundreds of years miseries unspeakable and\r\nincredible, were it not that compassion is a plant of such slow growth\r\nand so fragile.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of gaol fever of 1419 was caused by the well-meant but\r\ninjudicious action of the Mayor and Corporation.\r\n\r\nThey issued an ordinance, the reason of which is explained by the\r\npreamble.\r\n\r\n“Whereas the commendable intentions and charitable purpose of those who\r\nhave been governors and presidents of the City of London heretofore have\r\nordained a prison, called Ludgate, for the good and comfort of poor\r\nfreemen of the said city who have been condemned, to the end that such\r\npoor prisoners might, more freely than others who are strangers, dwell\r\nin quiet in such place, and pray for their benefactors, and live upon\r\nthe alms of the people.... Now, from one day to another, the charitable\r\nintentions and commendable purposes aforesaid are frustrated and turned\r\nto evil, inasmuch as many false persons, of bad disposition and purpose,\r\nhave been more willing to take up their abode there, so as to waste and\r\nspend their goods upon the ease and licence that there is within, than\r\nto pay their debts; and, what is even more, do therein compass,\r\nconspire, and imagine oftentimes, through others of their false _coin_,\r\nto indict good and loyal men for felonies and treasons of which they\r\nhave never been guilty.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, freemen of the City chose rather to live in the gaol of\r\nLudgate, on the alms provided for poor prisoners, than to work and pay\r\ntheir debts; and, worse still, they made use of their time to get up\r\nconspiracies against honourable citizens. The only remedy that could be\r\ndevised was to move all the prisoners to Newgate, and close the gaol.\r\nThis was done in the month of June, but in November, Richard Whittington\r\nbeing mayor, it was found that most of the wretches taken to Newgate had\r\ndied there, “by reason of the fetid and corrupt atmosphere”; whereupon\r\nLudgate was reopened, “seeing that every person is bound to support and\r\nbe tender of the lives of men.”\r\n\r\nIn April 1431, Whittington being dead, the prisoners of Ludgate were\r\nonce more removed to Newgate, and, to the general indignation, eighteen\r\nof them were led through the streets, pinioned as if they had been\r\nfelons, to the Sheriff’s Compter, probably with the view of not crowding\r\nNewgate again. But in June of the same year they were all taken back to\r\nLudgate, which remained a debtor’s prison for the citizens of London\r\ntill the year 1762, when the gate was taken down and the prisoners\r\nremoved to the London Workhouse in Bishopsgate Street. This double\r\nremoval looks as if works of enlargement or of repair were in progress\r\nat Ludgate. Twenty years later, in 1454, it was greatly enlarged by Dame\r\nAgnes Forster; see also p. 196.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, New Gate and Prison had been enlarged or practically\r\nrebuilt by Whittington, who began it, and his executors, who finished\r\nit. He seems to have furnished the prison with additional chambers on\r\nthe south side. It is pleasant to think that one of the last actions of\r\nthis great and good man was to improve the “fetid and corrupt atmosphere\r\nin the noxious Prison of Newgate.”\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that the gate was decorated with a bas-relief of the\r\nfamous cat, showing that there was current in Whittington’s own life the\r\nstory of the cat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NEWGATE MARKET, 1856\r\n]\r\n\r\nOther works of repair, enlargement, and restoration were carried on in\r\n1555 and in 1630. In 1666 the gate and prison were destroyed in the\r\nGreat Fire, but rebuilt in 1672.\r\n\r\nThe gate was removed in 1767, and now the prison has been demolished\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe modern account of Newgate Prison will be found in _London in the\r\nEighteenth Century_, p. 538.\r\n\r\nOutside Newgate and on the western edge of the river, there was a suburb\r\ndating from very early times. It grew up round Smithfield where horses\r\nwere bought and sold, and where young men shot with the bow and ran and\r\nwrestled. It contained the people who belonged to the service of the\r\nreligious houses there, and those who belonged to the hospital. We also\r\nfind, outside Newgate, “rents” in the thirteenth century, and bakehouses\r\nand tanneries also outside Newgate, while the spurriers in 1355 are\r\nenjoined to work in their quarters outside Newgate until curfew rings\r\nfrom St. Sepulchre’s Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NEWGATE, 1799\r\n]\r\n\r\nWithin Newgate, where a “pavement” was constructed to keep the stalls\r\nfrom the mud of the unpaved street, was the Market of the Shambles. Here\r\nwere two churches—St. Ewen’s, at the north-east corner of Warwick Lane,\r\nand St. Nicholas Fleshambles in what is now King Edward Street, formerly\r\nButcher’s Lane or Stinking Lane. Both parishes were united to form that\r\nof Christ Church after the Dissolution.\r\n\r\nNewgate Market is generally spoken of as a meat market only, which in\r\nlater years it became; but formerly many other things were sold there.\r\nIt is the natural tendency of markets to admit goods for sale other than\r\nthose for which they were created.\r\n\r\nThus we find in the fourteenth century that wheat was sold in the “corn\r\nmarket of Newgate”; that poulterers who were freemen had to sell their\r\nfowls either in Newgate Market or else west of the Tun in Cornhill; that\r\ncheese brought into the City by “foreigners” had to be sold in the\r\nmarket between the Shambles and Newgate, and nowhere else; that\r\nblacksmiths were forbidden to sell their goods except in the pavement of\r\nNewgate or else by the Tun of Cornhill; and that pork was also sold in\r\nthe market. Further investigations would doubtless bring to light the\r\nfact that it became a general market.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of trouble with the butchers. They were an unruly\r\nclass—we have seen how one of them was put to shame for impudence; they\r\npersisted in pouring the blood from the shambles down the gutters; they\r\ncarried the offal through the streets, and threw it into the river at\r\nthe Temple. In 1369 strict ordinances were passed that animals should be\r\nslaughtered outside the walls. As the butchers disobeyed the law it was\r\nagain proclaimed two years later, with the exception for the butchers of\r\nEast Chepe and the Stocks. I do not think, however, that the slaughter\r\nof beasts was ever carried on without the walls. The market stood all\r\nalong Newgate Street, with a “Middle Row” of sheds, under which were the\r\nstalls for the sale of grain, cheese, butter, poultry, etc., besides\r\nthat of meat. The butchers also had their stalls in Butchers’ Lane. The\r\nMiddle Row became like that in Holborn—a row of houses over shops. This\r\nMiddle Row must have made Newgate Street narrow and intolerably dark and\r\nclose. The Great Fire swept it away, and among the improvements made\r\nafter the Fire it was ordered “that the Ground where the Middle Row of\r\nthe Shambles stood and the ground of the four late houses in Newgate\r\nMarket between Warwick Lane End and the Bell Inn there shall be laid\r\ninto the streets” (Maitland).\r\n\r\nThose who can remember Newgate Street before the butchers’ shops were\r\ntaken to Smithfield, can bear witness to the horrible appearance of the\r\nstreet, lined as it was with butchers’ shops, where the passenger, who\r\nnever went through the street if he could avoid it, was jostled by\r\ngreasy blue smocks, and saluted on the cheek with ribs and legs of\r\nbleeding ox flesh. The end of Newgate Street and of Paternoster Row\r\nfacing Cheapside was, in 1720, called Jackanapes Row, a modern name\r\ngiven for some unknown reason. Passing along Newgate Street on the north\r\nside we come to Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHRIST’S HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the pre-Reformation schools to the great institution\r\nof Christ’s Hospital, which has become indissolubly associated with the\r\nname of Edward VI., the first Protestant king of England, we might\r\nexpect to find that we passed from darkness to light; from groping in\r\nthe dark after fragmentary hints of evidence, to an era of charters and\r\ndocuments well known and well understood. Yet there is no great school\r\nthe history of which has been more misunderstood or misrepresented than\r\nthat of Christ’s Hospital. In 1898, at the laying of the foundation\r\nstone of the new buildings at Horsham, Sussex, which are destined to\r\nconvert Christ’s Hospital from a London school into a “non-local” public\r\nschool, the Duke of Cambridge, as Chairman of the Governors of Christ’s\r\nHospital, gave the layer of the stone, the Prince of Wales, a succinct\r\nversion of the story of its origin.\r\n\r\n“It was founded,” he said, “by the saintly King Edward the VIth, who,\r\nbesides assigning it a site in the City of London, with his own hands\r\ninserted in the charter power to take lands in mortmain, which has\r\nenabled the munificence of subsequent benefactors to provide for nearly\r\nthree and a half centuries for the nurture and education of children.”\r\n\r\nSo the historian of Cambridge University, Mr. J. Bass Mallinger,[13]\r\nspeaking of Edward VI. had said: “Upwards of 30 Free Grammar Schools\r\nfounded at this time have permanently associated the name of Edward VI.\r\nwith popular education”; and among the thirty free grammar schools\r\nfounded by him, he includes Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nCarlisle, in his _Endowed Grammar Schools_, made a more cautious\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n“The precise endowment of the institution by the Royal Founder is not\r\nknown. It is certain that part of the premises which it now comprises,\r\ncommonly called Grey Friars and the Cloisters, with a part of the\r\nbuilding, were given by Edward VI.”\r\n\r\nA closer examination of the facts will show us that Christ’s Hospital\r\nwas not founded as a grammar school; that neither site nor buildings\r\nwere given by Edward VI.; and that he did not inscribe a licence in\r\nmortmain with his own hand. Christ’s Hospital was founded as a Foundling\r\nHospital and Ragged School for gutter children of both sexes, by the\r\ninhabitants of London, by means of public subscriptions and rates, on a\r\nsite and in buildings already acquired by the City from Henry VIII., and\r\nEdward VI.’s contribution to it consisted of a piece of parchment, some\r\nconfiscated church linen, and his name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most startling revelation to those who have heard so often\r\nof the magnificence of the foundation of Edward VI., is to find that\r\nChrist’s Hospital at first had no endowments beyond its sites and\r\nbuildings, and never received a penny of income from the property\r\ncomprised in Edward’s charter.\r\n\r\nChrist’s Hospital is alone among the great public schools in that it has\r\nentirely departed from the class and the objects for which it was\r\noriginally intended. Winchester and Eton, Westminster and St. Paul’s\r\nwere intended always for the same class or classes which now frequent\r\nthem. The scholars were meant to be, and were, taken from the poorer\r\nmembers of the upper middle class, squires, parsons, barristers,\r\nmerchants, and the like, “who could not, without help, send their sons\r\nto the University”; the commoners or paying boys from the richer members\r\nof the same class. Christ’s Hospital, unlike these, was intended for the\r\npoorest of the poor. Its foundation was not due, like that of the other\r\nancient public schools, to any single founder, or to any desire to\r\nfurther education. It was a part of a great scheme to put down\r\npauperism, and so effect by voluntary and charitable effort what in\r\nElizabeth’s day and since has been effected, or attempted, by compulsion\r\nand the Poor Law. It was intended to rid the streets of London of the\r\ncurse of sturdy rogues and vagabonds, on principles which were strictly\r\nin accordance with the doctrines of political economy, and would be\r\nhighly approved by the Charity Organisation Society. It aimed at getting\r\nrid of the poor by setting those who were merely unfortunate to work,\r\nwhile making things unpleasant for the undeserving and idle, and by\r\nbringing up their children in the way they should go to earn their own\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHRIST’S HOSPITAL, FROM THE CLOISTERS, 1804\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Christ’s Hospital is inextricably mixed up with\r\nthat of the other “Royal Hospitals,”[14] St. Bartholomew’s and St.\r\nThomas’s Hospital and the Bridewell. It may be traced to a movement to\r\nrid London, and especially the parish churches, of the crowds of poor,\r\nsome sick and diseased, some mere idle “rogues and vagabonds.”\r\nHistorians like Father Gasquet in his _Henry VIII. and the Monasteries_,\r\nfollowing some older authors, _laudatores temporis acti_, write as if\r\nbeggary and vagrancy were a special product of the Reformation Era, and\r\nwere caused by the suppression of the monasteries. This is putting the\r\ncart before the horse. It could easily be shown that hundreds of years\r\nearlier the State made efforts to put them down. But for the present\r\npurpose we need go no further back than the first part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In London an Act of Common Council,[15] passed in 1518, before\r\nLuther had ever been heard of beyond Wittemburg, and long before the\r\nsuppression of monasteries had even been dreamt of by Henry, directed\r\nthat for getting rid of “all mighty beggars, vagabonds, and all other\r\nsuspect and evil-disposed persons out of this city, every alderman in\r\nhis ward shall get two or three persons in each parish to form lists of\r\nall persons living on alms, and certify them to the Common Council.”\r\n\r\nBut, while the monasteries and friaries, and especially the latter—those\r\ngreat schools of pauperism and seminaries of beggary—were continually\r\ncreating new swarms of the poor they were supposed to relieve, any real\r\ndiminution of beggary was hopeless. We find the Common Council in 1533,\r\nbefore the suppression, vainly trying to abate the evil by the\r\ninstitution of a voluntary poor-rate, directing the aldermen to “weekly\r\ndepute some honest persons of every parish to gather the devotions of\r\nthe parishioners, and the same to be delivered at the church doors to\r\npoor folk,” so as to prevent them crowding into the churches, carrying\r\ntheir disgusting sores and infection with them.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the dissolution of the monasteries, August 1,\r\n1540, the City began to negotiate with Henry VIII. for the purchase of\r\nthe “four houses and churches of Friars,” the Black, White, Grey, and\r\nAustin, because they were the finest buildings in the City after St.\r\nPaul’s and St. Martin-le-Grand. The Grey Friars’ Church was no less than\r\n300 feet long. The City urged that they would be “a very great comfort,\r\naid and refuge for the avoiding and eschewing” of plague and sickness.\r\nThey offered “a thousand marks esterling (£666 : 13 : 4), if they can be\r\ngotten no better cheap, down for them.”[16] Sir Richard Gresham was the\r\nnegotiator, and had to inform the court of aldermen that His Highness\r\nthought the citizens “pinchpence” to offer so little, and refused. At\r\nlast, however, in 1547, they came to an agreement, not for all the\r\nhouses unfortunately, but for the Grey Friars only. They also acquired\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s Hospital, which had been dissolved as part of the\r\nPriory of St. Bartholomew, and Bethlehem or Bedlam Hospital, which,\r\nbeing in the hands of the secular clergy, had not been dissolved. What\r\nwas paid for the grant does not appear in the documents; though that\r\nsomething considerable was paid there is little doubt. On December 27,\r\n1547, the City got a conveyance from Henry, confirmed by charter of the\r\nsame date, with a licence in mortmain precisely in the same words as the\r\none which, we are told, was so providentially invented by Edward VI.; as\r\nwas perhaps not surprising since the formula was some two centuries old.\r\n\r\nHenry purported to make the grants of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and the\r\nGrey Friars’ Church, cloisters, and conventual buildings with the whole\r\nprecinct, and all the houses in it, valued at some £50 a year, because\r\nhe considered “the miserable estate (the poor, aged, sick, sore and\r\nimpotent people), as well men as women, lying and going about begging in\r\nthe common streets of the City of London[17] and the suburbs of the\r\nsame ... to the great infection and [an]noyance of his grace’s loving\r\nsubjects.”\r\n\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s was to be a hospital or house for the poor. The Grey\r\nFriars was not granted for a hospital but for a church. It was to be a\r\nparish church for the Grey Friars’ precinct, Newgate and St. Sepulchre’s\r\nparish, with a vicar; “a visitor of Newgate,” or prison chaplain, and\r\nfive other priests, partly curates, partly chantry-priests, all to be\r\nappointed by the corporation of the City. The City, that is, “the Mayor\r\nand Commonalty and citizens,” were given a licence in mortmain to hold\r\nlands up to the value of a thousand marks a year for the purposes of\r\nthis grant. By the same grant they were made the custodians of the\r\nBethlehem Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Common Council, on obtaining possession of the Grey Friars’ Church,\r\npromptly gutted it[18] of all its famous and beautiful tombs, royal and\r\ncivic alike, stripping down its stall-work, and reducing the dimensions\r\nof the nave. In fact, they emulated the Crown and nobility in the work\r\nof plunder and destruction, not sparing their own ancestors.\r\n\r\nAt first efforts were made to maintain St. Bartholomew’s Hospital by\r\nvoluntary donations, “a weekly collection of the devotion of the\r\npeople,” but this was found not to “take any good success or semblance\r\nof good contynnance,” and by an order of Common Council, September 29,\r\n1547, “a moietie or half deale of one hole fiftene” was levied for its\r\nsupport. In December 1543 certain dues levied in respect of the\r\nmeasuring of leather up to 500 marks a year were granted to it; and the\r\nother 500 marks to be paid out of the half-fifteenth[19] was assessed\r\ninstead on the Companies at the rate of £24 a quarter from the Mercers\r\ndown to 13s. 4d. a quarter from small Companies like the Glaziers.\r\n\r\nIn 1549 the City was already in treaty with the Protector Somerset[20]\r\n“for the alteration of parcel of the foundacion of the house of the\r\npoor.” Nothing, however, was done during his stormy reign, which ended\r\nby his being sent to the Tower in January 1550. In the following Lent,\r\nLever,[21] the Master of St. John’s College, Cambridge, preached some\r\nfamous sermons at St. Paul’s Cross, inveighing against the breach of the\r\nActs of dissolution both of monasteries and chantries, according to\r\nwhich the proceeds were to be applied “for erecting of Grammar Schools,\r\nthe further augmenting of the Universities and better provision for the\r\npoor.” He voiced, not merely the wishes of his own college and\r\nuniversity, but also those of the City of London. Edward VI.’s action\r\nhas been attributed to a sermon of Ridley “the martyr,” the Bishop of\r\nLondon, in 1552. It seems doubtful, however, whether Ridley was the\r\nprime mover or only an agent of the City. A letter of his own, intended\r\nto be pathetic, but which surely must have had a ring of comicality even\r\nto his contemporaries, goes to show that Lord Mayor Sir Richard Dobbs\r\nwas the originator of the movement.\r\n\r\n“O Dobbs, Dobbs, alderman and Knight, thou in thy year didst win my\r\nheart for evermore for that honourable act, that most blessed work of\r\nGod, of the erection and setting up of Christ’s holy hospitals and truly\r\nreligious houses which by thee and through thee were begun.... Thou\r\ndidst plead their cause (the cause of Christ’s ‘silly members’) yea and\r\nnot only in thine own person thou didst set forth Christ’s cause but to\r\nfurther the matter thou broughtest me into the Council Chamber of the\r\nCity before the Aldermen alone, whom thou hadst assembled there together\r\nto hear me speak what I would say as an advocate by office and duty in\r\nthe poor man’s cause.”[22]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, in fact, acted as the Bishops of London now do, as a kind of\r\npublic orator and common vouchee of all charitable organisations; he was\r\nnot the originator or organiser.\r\n\r\nThe detailed story of the foundation is told in an account written by J.\r\nHowes, “Renter” of Christ’s Hospital, in the form of a delightful\r\ndialogue between Dignity (an Elizabethan alderman) and Duty, or Howes\r\nhimself.[23]\r\n\r\nDobbs, he tells us, with the Bishop and a few others, “devised a book”\r\nto provide for the various classes of poor. “First[24] they devised to\r\ntake out of the streets all the fatherless children and other poor men’s\r\nchildren that were not able to keep them, and to bring them to the late\r\ndissolved house of the Grey Friars, which they devised to be an Hospital\r\nfor them, where they should have meat and drink and clothes, lodging and\r\nlearning, and officers to attend upon them. They also devised that there\r\nshould be provision made to keep the sick from the whole, and laid a\r\n‘platte’ (a plot or plan) to have purchased Finsbury Court, and there to\r\nhave kept the children in fresh air in the time of sickness, because\r\nthey feared lest through the corrupt nature of the children, who might\r\ninfect one another, being packed up in one house, and so put the whole\r\ncity in danger of infection. Then the Governors devised that the sucking\r\nchildren and such as were not able to learn should be kept in the\r\ncountry and always at Easter brought home.” The lame and aged poor were\r\nto be removed to St. Thomas’s Hospital, forthwith; the “Lazar” people\r\nshould be removed out of the streets, and have monthly pensions paid to\r\nthem to the end they should not annoy the King’s subjects resorting to\r\nthe City; and all the decayed poor citizens should be made known and\r\nevery one of them have weekly a pension according to his necessity. But\r\n“all the idle and lusty rogues, as well men as women, should all be\r\ntaken up and conveyed into some house where they should have all things\r\nnecessary and be compelled to labour.” A committee of thirty was\r\nappointed to collect statistics. They reported that the number to be\r\nprovided for was—\r\n\r\n            Fatherless children                         300\r\n            Sore and sick persons                       200\r\n            Poor men overburthened with their children  350\r\n            Aged persons                                400\r\n            Decayed householders                        650\r\n            Idle vagabonds                              200\r\n                                                       ————\r\n                                                       2100\r\n                                                       ————\r\n\r\nThey then set to work to provide ways and means.\r\n\r\nThe committee of thirty found close on £1500 themselves. The parsons\r\nwere set to work to extract weekly “pensions” from their parishioners;\r\nboxes were distributed to the wardens of every Company. There was a\r\n“devise that every honest householder in London should have a bill\r\nprinted, wherein there was a glass window left open for his name and for\r\nhis sum of money,” and the churchwardens were to get these filled in.\r\n\r\nIn February 1551[25] the City began to negotiate for the purchase of\r\n“the Hospitall in Suthwarke,” the Hospital of St. Thomas à Becket in\r\nSouthwark, which until the Dissolution had been in the hands of\r\nAugustinian canons. On the 25th March the Privy Council granted an order\r\nfor the purchase to be carried into effect. A detailed estimate of the\r\ncharges and net income of the hospital on the proposal to purchase is\r\nextant at the Record Office.[26] From this it appears that the total\r\ngross value of its possessions was £314 : 17 : 1: the charges for the\r\npoor, the priests, and so on were estimated at £154 : 17 : 1, leaving a\r\nsurplus of about £160 a year. Of this, £36 odd was derived from land\r\nestimated at twenty years’ purchase, and £123 from houses and cottages\r\ntaken at fourteen years’ purchase. The City paid £2461 : 2 : 6 down for\r\nthe grant of the endowment, with the hospital site and buildings thrown\r\nin. The transaction was completed by Letters Patent of August 12 and 13,\r\n1551, which included a licence in mortmain up to £46 a year above the\r\nissue of the lands, _i.e._ £200 a year in all.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired St. Thomas’s Hospital for the sick poor, the City next\r\nset itself to work to petition[27] the King for a grant of the old\r\npalace of Bridewell. For the proposed inhabitants of this they had in\r\n“readiness most profitable and wholesome occupations for the continuing\r\nin godly exercise ... which is the guider and begetter of all wealth,\r\nvirtue and honesty.” This was followed up by a further grant of the\r\nSavoy Hospital, founded by Henry VII. on the site of the old mansion of\r\nJohn of Gaunt, and completed by Henry VIII. It was intended for old\r\nsoldiers and pilgrims.\r\n\r\nWe gather from Howes that the motives of the King in making the grant of\r\nBridewell, and of the revenues of the Savoy Hospital, to Christ’s\r\nHospital were not of the very highest order.\r\n\r\n“What” [says Dignity] “should move the King to depart from so beautiful\r\na house as Bridewell was, so richly garnished, with so great charges,\r\nand being so late builded, and to convert the lands of the Savoy to the\r\nCity?”\r\n\r\n“The situation of Bridewell” [replies Duty] “was such that all the cost\r\nwas cast away; there was no coming to it but through stinking lanes or\r\nover a filthy ditch, which did so continually annoy the house, that the\r\nKing had no pleasure in it. And therefore the King being required by the\r\ncitizens to converte it to so good a use God moved his heart to bestow\r\nit to that use, rather than to be at any charge in keeping of it, or to\r\nsuffer it to fall down; and so not profitable to any. And this, I am\r\nsure, was the reason that moved the King. For at that time it stood void\r\nand was daily spoiled by the keepers. And now as touching the turning\r\nover of the Savoy lands you shall understand that the Savoy was erected\r\nby King Henry VIIth in the time of papistry chiefly for pilgrims,\r\nwayfaring men, and for maimed and bruised soldiers that they might have\r\nmeat, drink and lodging for a time. The pilgrims being suppressed and so\r\nno use of them, and as for such wayfaring men and soldiers as that house\r\ndid commonly harbour, [they] were none other but common rogues and idle\r\npilfering knaves, which they received in at night and every morning\r\nturned out at the gates without meat, drink or clothes; and so lay\r\nwandering all day abroad seeking their adventure in filching and\r\nstealing, and at night came and were received in again. And so the Savoy\r\nwas nothing else but a nursery of all villany. The revenues and profits\r\nof the rents came wholly to the use of the Masters, who were priests,\r\nand officers of the house. And so the virtuous prince King Edward had\r\ngreat reason in converting the lands to the City, where the poor\r\nreceived the profits.”\r\n\r\nThe Savoy lands were worth £450 a year; but the institution was in debt\r\nto the amount of £178, which the City had to pay off, and they also had\r\nto pension the officers of the Savoy Hospital to the extent of £101 :\r\n6 : 8 a year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Howes, all the income from endowment went to St. Thomas’s\r\nHospital, the Bridewell was maintained by labour, and Christ’s Hospital\r\nchiefly by the liberal devotion of the citizens; but if any one of these\r\nthree wanted then the other two did supply the lack.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on July 26, 1552, the City began to repair the Grey Friars for\r\nthe use of the poor children.\r\n\r\nSeparate committees of the thirty above-mentioned were appointed to\r\nprepare or “make sweet” the various places for the poor. That for\r\nChrist’s Hospital consisted of Mr. Roe, “which was afterwards Lord\r\nMayor,” as Treasurer, and Stephen Cobbe, John Blondell, Thomas Lodge,\r\nThomas Bartlett, Thomas Eaton, and Richard Grafton as “surveyors.” “The\r\nlate dissolved Grey Friars at that time[28] stood void and empty, only a\r\nnumber of ‘whores and rogues’ harboured therein at nights; saving one\r\nThomas Bryckett, vicar of Christchurch, with whom the Governors\r\ncompounded and bought all his tables, bedsteads and other things; and\r\nmade out of his lodgings ‘a compting house and lodging for their\r\nclerk.’” Then they appointed officers: a warden, clerk, steward, butler,\r\nunder-butler, cook, two porters; surgeon, barber, tailor, coal-keeper, a\r\n“mazer” or bowl scourer, a matron, twenty-five sisters or nurses, a\r\nporter, and a sexton. With them were also the schoolmasters in the old\r\ntriple division of grammar, song, and writing, with reading (assumed in\r\nthe ordinary grammar school to have been already mastered) added.\r\n\r\nThere was—\r\n\r\n                                                             £ _s._ _d._\r\n A Grammar Schoole Mayster, John Robynson, whose yearly\r\n   fee was                                                  15    0    0\r\n A Grammar Usher, James Seamer                              10    0    0\r\n A Teacher to wrighte, John Watson                           3    6    8\r\n Schoolmasters for the Petties ABC, Thomas Lowes and\r\n   Thomas Cutts, whose yearly fees to each of them was       2   13    4\r\n A schule maister for musicke                                2   13    4\r\n A teacher of pricksonge whose yearly fee was                2   13    4\r\n\r\nJohn Watson the writing master was also clerk, in which latter capacity\r\nhe received £10 a year. The status of the various teachers may be judged\r\nfrom the fact that the head surgeon received the same stipend as the\r\nhead schoolmaster; the under-surgeon received £4 against the usher’s\r\n£10, while the arts got £8. The “Absies,” _i.e._ ABC or elementary\r\nschoolmaster, received 13s. 4d. a year more than the barber, and a great\r\ndeal less than the porters, who had £6 a year each.\r\n\r\nThe foundation was a stupendous charitable effort, the money it cost\r\nbeing certainly underestimated by the common reckoning at twelve times\r\nthe then value, or £30,000 of our money. It included, for instance, “500\r\nfeather beds, and 500 pads of straw to put under the feather beds, and\r\nas many blankets and 1000 pair of sheets” from one contractor alone. In\r\nall, double that number was provided. But many “there were that brought\r\nfeather beds, coverlets, sheets, blankets, shirts and smocks, and\r\ndisbursed great sums of money, which never came to any public account.”\r\nThe “virtuous prince” himself was most generous. He issued a warrant\r\nunder his own hand “that all the linen belonging to the churches in\r\nLondon should be brought and delivered to the Governors for the use of\r\nthe poor, reserving sufficient for the Communion Table, with towels and\r\nsurplices for the ministers and churches.” The linen, we are told, did\r\ngood service, “and especiale in St. Thomas Hospital.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn November 1552[30] no less than 380 children were taken into the\r\nhouse. At first the “idle men and women” were also brought into Christ’s\r\nHospital “and put in what is now (_i.e._ in 1582) the schoolmaster’s\r\nhouse, where they were kept from doing any further harm, although not\r\nemployed to any occupations, for the place served not.” When Bridewell\r\nwas obtained, the workhouse folk were removed there; but this was not\r\nbefore midsummer 1554.[31]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of Christ’s Hospital was entirely done by voluntary\r\ncontributions. For St. Thomas’ the City granted £100, and “turned over”\r\nto it “£50 a year of that which had been purchased from the King.” But\r\nno endowment income was forthcoming for Christ’s Hospital. Nor is it\r\npossible to ascertain how much capital was given for Christ’s Hospital\r\nalone as the contemporary “State and charge of the new erected\r\nHospitals—A.D. 1553”[32] gives the cost of St. Thomas’ indistinguishably\r\nmixed with that of Christ’s Hospital. The total was £2479 : 15 : 10,\r\ntowards which £2476 was received in subscriptions and donations.\r\n\r\nThough Christ’s Hospital was in full working order from November 1552,\r\nthe legal foundation, which appears to have been delayed by the\r\nconclusion of the arrangements about Bridewell, was not complete till\r\nJune 1553. An “Indenture of Covenants,” dated June 12, 7 Edward VI.\r\n(1553), was made in English between the King and the mayor, commonalty,\r\nand citizens of London, which was carried out by Letters Patent in Latin\r\non the 26th June. The patent contained grants of the manor of Bridewell,\r\nthe lands belonging to the Savoy Hospital, and the bedding in the same;\r\nbut not the hospital itself. It created the City Corporation a special\r\ncorporation with a separate common seal by the name of “the Governors of\r\nthe possessions, revenues and goods of the Hospitals of Edward the\r\nSixth, King of England, of Christ, Bridewell and St. Thomas the\r\nApostle,” and gave them a licence in mortmain to hold lands for the\r\npurposes of the three hospitals up to 4000 marks (£3333 : 16 : 8) a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe charter in the most distinct terms emphasises the poor law character\r\nof the foundation, and states also with equal distinctness that the idea\r\ndid not originate with the King. “Whereas we pitying the miserable\r\nestate of the poor, fatherless, decrepit, aged, sick, infirm and\r\nimpotent persons, languishing under various kinds of diseases, and also\r\nof our special grace thoroughly considering the honest and pious\r\nendeavours of our most humble and obedient subjects the Mayor and\r\nCommonalty and citizens of our city of London, who by all ways and\r\nmethods diligently study for the good provision of the aforesaid poor\r\nand of every sort of them”—such is the preamble to the grant. The\r\ncharter deals with every class of destitute poor: sick, aged, orphans;\r\nthe poor by misfortune; and rogues and vagabonds; the wilfully poor. The\r\npreamble states as its object “that neither children yet being in their\r\ninfancy shall lack good education and instruction, nor when they shall\r\nattain riper years shall be without honest callings and occupations, nor\r\nthat the sick or diseased when they be recovered and restored to healthe\r\nmay remain idle and lazy vagabonds, but that they in like manner may be\r\nplaced and compelled to labour.” In like manner the conclusion of the\r\ncharter is a grant to the corporation of power to search towns and\r\nplayhouses, and arrest ruffians, vagabonds, and beggars.\r\n\r\nThe story of the boy king inserting the licence in mortmain with his own\r\nhands is absurd. The licence, occupying a good quarto page of close\r\nprint, is in the usual legal common form. The story arose, no doubt,\r\nfrom an exaggerated version of Strype’s[33] tale that “space was left in\r\nthe patent for His Grace to put in what sum it pleased him” up to the\r\nyearly value of which the City might hold lands in mortmain for the\r\nhospitals, not Christ’s Hospital alone, but all together. “He looking on\r\nthe void place called for pen and ink, and with his own hand wrote this\r\nsum, 4000 marks by the year.” Unfortunately for the story, in the patent\r\nthe sum is written in the same hand as the rest of the document, and the\r\nsum had been previously settled, since it appears in the agreement\r\nexecuted a fortnight before, and could not have been altered without a\r\nbreach of contract. In the agreement it is written in a different hand\r\nto the rest of the document; but there is no reason to think that it was\r\nEdward’s own hand, which it does not the least resemble. So much for the\r\nlegend of St. Edward the VI. It is as apocryphal as the picture, said to\r\nbe by Holbein, which hangs in the Great Hall of Christ’s Hospital and\r\nshows Edward on his throne surrounded by the Council, giving the charter\r\nto the Lord Mayor on his knees, while 15 boys and 15 girls of the\r\nHospital kneel in the foreground, the smallest boy and girl facing the\r\nthrone and holding up their hands in rapt admiration. It is a matter of\r\nhistory that the poor boy-king died within a week of the date of the\r\ncharter—July 6, 1553,—and was invisible for many days before he died; a\r\npassing glimpse of him being exhibited to assure the people that he was\r\nstill alive.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Edward VI. nearly succumbed under his successor Mary.\r\nWhen “she came out of Norfolk and was to be received into London, the\r\nGovernors set up a stage without Aldgate and placed themselves and the\r\nchildren on the stage, and prepared a child of the Free School to make\r\nan oracion to hir. But when she came near unto them she cast her eye\r\nanother way and neither stayed nor gave any countenance to them.” “She\r\ndid not like ‘the blewe boyes,’” said Howes; “but if they had been so\r\nmany Grey Friars she would have given them better countenance.”\r\nAccording to him, “the Friars made great friends and great means to be\r\nrestored to that house because it stood whole, and was not spoiled, as\r\nother houses were, but they never durst open their mouths to suppress\r\nthat house as long as Friar John was within the land.” He tells a famous\r\ntale, “how Friars Peto and Perrin did their good wills to have subverted\r\nall.” But Friar John, a Spaniard, was brought by the rest of the\r\nCommissioners to have his opinion, who, “being there at dinner-time and\r\nseeing the poor children set at the tables in the hall and seeing them\r\nserved with meat, he was so wrapt in admiration that suddenly he burst\r\ninto tears, and said in Latin to the company that he had rather be a\r\nscullion in their kitchen than steward to their king.” “Alfonsus,” the\r\nKing’s Confessor, also supported them, while Dr. Story was made a friend\r\nby having been given the lease of the house where he dwelt, which was\r\n“parcel” of the Friars, for he thought that if the Friars were restored\r\nthat then they would bring his house in question; while the Bishop of\r\nChichester being tenant of the chief lodging of the Prior was also\r\nfriendly for the same reason. The children were therefore kept\r\nundisturbed, though Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, when Chancellor,\r\n“clapped Mr. Grafton fast in the Fleet for two days because he suffered\r\nthe children to learn the English Premier when they should have learned\r\nthe Latin Absies (A, B, Cs).”\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of evidence as to the class of children taken into\r\nChrist’s Hospital. The most striking is a passage from Howes’ book. “A\r\nnumber of the children,” he says, “being taken from the dunghill, when\r\nthey came to sweet and clean keeping and to a pure diet died\r\noutright.... And a number of them would watch daily when the porters\r\nwere absent that they might steal out and fall to their old occupation.”\r\nThis is corroborated by the Court Book of the Hospital, which\r\nunfortunately only begins in December 1556, with such entries as this:\r\nMay 10, 1557, “Graunted that a woman child left on Mr. Gunter’s stall in\r\nCornhill, and by him kept since Candlemas, should be admitted.” November\r\n8, “a woman childe left in a pewe at St. Peter’s, Cornhill, admitted.”\r\nMarch 14, 1557, a child “found in Thames Streete near the Bridge\r\nadmitted.” In the “Children’s Register,” beginning 1563, we come across\r\nmany names pointing to the foundling origin of the children. Richard\r\nNomoreknowen, five years old. He died in the sick-ward in 1570.\r\nAugustine Old Change, six years old. “To service, March 30, 1567.”\r\n“Dorothy Buttriedore” (she had evidently been deposited behind the\r\nbuttery door), “three years old. To service, 1570. Delivered to Mr. His\r\nfor his own, but received back. Delivered to Margaret Garraway for her\r\nown, 1571; again to F. Tousbury, April 19, 1572.” “Jane Fridaiestreete,\r\naged six, sent to service 1568.” Perhaps the two quaintest names were\r\n“Grace-That-God-sent-us,” “delivered out on the 19th, and died April 21,\r\n1563,” and “Jane-that-God-sent-us,” sent to service 1568.\r\n\r\nStow says of Christ’s Hospital: “A full Courte shal be when xiij of the\r\nGovernours of this said Hospitall be assembled at the least, whereof two\r\nshal be Aldermen, the one of them to be the President, with ten\r\nCommoners besides the Thresorer; and what these xiij Persons or vij of\r\nthem at the leaste, the President being one of the Number, shal decree,\r\nordaine or agree upon, the same shal stand in Force, and shal not be\r\naltered nor disallowed except by a like Courte to be called in that\r\nbehalfe.\r\n\r\n“Item. That no Governour be taken into this Hospitall in the Place of\r\nany that shal happen to die within the Year except it be at a full\r\nCourte, to be holden as afore, for weighty Causes; and the Name of him\r\nso admitted, to be presented to the Maior and Courte of Aldermen, before\r\nhe be called to receive his Charge.\r\n\r\n“Item. That no Sale of Land, Tymber, or Wood, Lease, Alienation,\r\nBuildinge, or Reparation be determined or done, of Lands or Tenements\r\ngeven to th’ onlye Use of Christ’s Hospitall, or in any wise belonginge\r\nproperlie to the same, except at a full Courte, to be holden in the said\r\nHospitall as before.\r\n\r\n“Item. That no Reward be given to any Person above the Some of v\r\nShillings at once; which must be done by the consent of the Thresorer\r\nand one of the Almoners at the least; except first the same be graunted\r\nand determined in a full Courte, as before.\r\n\r\n“Item. That there be no Leases lett in Reversion but one Year before the\r\nould Lease be expired; and that no such Graunt be made but by a full\r\nCourte, as before, or els not; and that all the same Leases be drawn in\r\nPaper by a Scryvenor, one of the Governours of the saide Hospitall,\r\nbefore they be engrossed; and he to be allowed for every Draught\r\naccordinge to the Quantitie: And the Clerke of the said Hospitall to\r\nengrosse them, and to procure the Sealing of all such Leases before the\r\nLord Maior and Courte of Aldermen, in the Chamber of London, where the\r\nCommon Seal of the Hospitall doeth remaine.\r\n\r\n“That noe manner of Bargaines be made for Timber, Tile, or such like, or\r\nany other Necessaries for the saide howse, before the same be determined\r\nat a full Courte, to be holden as before; and the Persons then and there\r\nto be named and appointed which shal be the Doers thereof” (Stow,\r\nAppendix II.).\r\n\r\nIn 1680 Sir John Frederick rebuilt the hall at his own expense; Sir\r\nRobert Clayton rebuilt the east cloister and south front. In 1825 the\r\nHospital was largely rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe two chief classes in the school are the Grecians and Deputy\r\nGrecians; of which many of the former go on to the universities with\r\nexhibitions. The Mathematical School was founded by Charles II. in 1672,\r\nand the boys are called “King’s boys.” The King’s boys and Grecians are\r\nthe only boys who remain in the school after the age of fifteen. The\r\nancient costume, consisting of long blue gown, leather belt, yellow\r\nstockings, combined with an absence of head-covering, makes the boys\r\nconspicuous wherever they may be. The old customs of supping in public\r\nin Lent, and the visit to the Lord Mayor on Easter Tuesday, are still\r\nkept up. But the old English diet of bread and beer for breakfast was\r\ndone away with in 1824.\r\n\r\nAmong the most distinguished names of old scholars are those of S. T.\r\nColeridge, the poet (d. 1834), Charles Lamb (d. 1834), Leigh Hunt (d.\r\n1859). The system of admission is by presentations by governors; the\r\nLord Mayor makes two presentations annually. A governor must give at\r\nleast £500.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the Grey Friars see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p.\r\n348.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo, R. W. Thomas._\r\n\r\n  AN EXCITING GAME, CHRIST’S HOSPITAL\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHRIST CHURCH\r\n\r\n  Christ Church, which unites the ancient parishes of St. Ewen’s and\r\n  St. Nicholas and part of St. Sepulchre, stands on the eastern part\r\n  of the noble Franciscan Church which was greatly destroyed by the\r\n  Fire.\r\n\r\n  On the suppression of the convent of the Franciscans, their Church\r\n  was named Christ Church and was made parochial. After the Great Fire\r\n  it was rebuilt by Wren between 1687 and 1704. St. Leonard’s, Foster\r\n  Lane, was annexed to this parish in 1672. The earliest date of a\r\n  custodian is 1225. The earliest date of a vicar is 1547.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was given by Henry VIII. to the\r\n  governors of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, in whose successors it\r\n  continues.\r\n\r\n  The present building contains two side-aisles separated from the\r\n  nave by slender Corinthian columns. At the east part of the church\r\n  shelves are attached to the north and south walls, to hold loaves\r\n  for distribution among the poor. The steeple attains a height of 153\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n  The original church of the Franciscans was a favourite place of\r\n  sepulture. Dame Mary Ramsey, a benefactress to Christ’s Hospital and\r\n  other institutions, was buried here in 1596, and a modern tablet\r\n  records her deeds on the north wall of the church. The two most\r\n  conspicuous monuments are those of the Rev. Samuel Crowther and the\r\n  Rev. Michael Gibbs, both of whom were vicars of the parish for many\r\n  years. Lady Venetia, wife of Sir Kenelm Digby, was buried here. Also\r\n  the celebrated Nonconformist, Richard Baxter, in 1691, and his wife\r\n  in 1681. On the east wall a tablet commemorates John Stock, who at\r\n  his death in 1781 bequeathed £13,000 to charitable purposes.\r\n\r\n  No large gifts are recorded in this parish by Stow: John Bankes was\r\n  donor of £1 for a sermon; Thomas Barnes was donor of £1 for a\r\n  sermon, and several others were donors of the same amounts.\r\n\r\n  There were two charity schools, one for fifty boys and one for forty\r\n  girls.\r\n\r\n  Some of the most notable vicars were: Sampson Price (1585-1620);\r\n  William Jenkyn (1613-1685); Robert Cannon (1663-1722), Prebendary of\r\n  Westminster; Joseph Trapp, D.D. (1679-1747); and William Bell\r\n  (1731-1816), Prebendary of Westminster.\r\n\r\n=King Edward Street= was formerly Butchers’ Lane or Stinking Lane or\r\nChick Lane. The Franciscans, on their coming to London, were allotted a\r\npiece of ground on the west side of this lane, probably the least\r\ndesirable place of residence in the whole city. When we read of shops\r\nand tenements in the Shambles, this is the place intended.\r\n\r\n=Roman Bath Street= comes next. This place was formerly called Pinnock’s\r\nLane, _i.e._ Pentecost Lane. Houses in Pentecost Lane are mentioned as\r\nearly as 1280. It contained the forbidden slaughter-houses. At the upper\r\nend stood the Royal Bagnio. There were two Bagnios—this of Pinnock’s\r\nLane and another in Long Acre. The Royal Bagnio was opened in 1679; it\r\nwas simply a turkish bath, a place for sweating and hot bathing: for a\r\ntime it was very much esteemed as a preventative against some forms of\r\ndisease and a cure for headache. The Royal Bagnio contained one large\r\nroom with a cupola and several smaller rooms, the walls of which were\r\nlined with Dutch tiles. The place was converted into a hot and cold\r\nbathhouse, and finally closed and pulled down in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ST. SEPULCHRE\r\n\r\n  This church was rebuilt, Stow says, about the time of Henry VI. or\r\n  Edward IV., mainly by “one of the Pophames.” The greater part was\r\n  destroyed by the Great Fire, and in 1670 it was again rebuilt, by\r\n  whom is uncertain. It received considerable alterations in 1738,\r\n  1837, 1863, 1875, and again 1878-80. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1249.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: Roger, Bishop of\r\n  Sarum (1107-39), who gave it to the Prior and Convent of St.\r\n  Bartholomew, Smithfield ; Henry VIII., who seized it and so it\r\n  continued in the Crown up to 1609, when James I. gave the advowson\r\n  of the Vicarage to Francis Philips and others; the President and\r\n  Scholars of St. John’s College, Oxford, who presented to the\r\n  Vicarage in 1662, and in whose successors it continued.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 3400.\r\n\r\n  The church consists of a nave, chancel, and two side-aisles, and an\r\n  adjunct on the north side called the chapel of St. Stephen; it\r\n  measures 150 feet in length, 81 feet in width, and 149 feet 11\r\n  inches in height, to the summit of the tower. The organ was built by\r\n  Renatus Harris, and is considered one of his finest productions; its\r\n  case is said to have been the work of Grinling Gibbons.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by: John de Tamworth, who had a licence\r\n  from the King to assign one messuage and sixteen cottages in the\r\n  suburbs of London, for a chaplain to sing for his soul, on certain\r\n  days in this church, February 20, 1373-74. Here also was founded the\r\n  Brotherhood of Our Lady and St. Stephen, endowed by various persons\r\n  with rents, etc., which fetched £9 : 13 : 4 in 1548.\r\n\r\n  Roger Ascham, Queen Elizabeth’s tutor, and author of _Toxophilus_\r\n  and the _Scholemaster_, who died in 1568, was buried here, but has\r\n  no memorial. Here also the remains of Captain John Smith were\r\n  interred in 1631; he was Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New\r\n  England, and author of the _General History of Virginia_. His\r\n  monument has perished, but there is a replica of the original\r\n  inscription on a plate on the south wall. Sir Robert Peake, a\r\n  distinguished cavalier and engraver, was also interred here in 1667,\r\n  but no one else of eminence appears to have been buried in the\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  In 1605 Robert Dowe gave £50 to the parish on condition that the\r\n  night before every execution a hand-bell, which he presented, should\r\n  be rung in front of the condemned prisoners’ dungeon, and an\r\n  exhortation given them. His donation has now passed into the hands\r\n  of the Charity Commissioners. No names of benefactors are recorded\r\n  by Stow. According to the Record of the Parish Clerk of 1732 the\r\n  donations of the poor, for ever, amounted to £250, besides which\r\n  there were forty-seven other donations of less value than £40 or £20\r\n  per annum. Richard Reeves left £100 per annum. In addition, the\r\n  stock of money given by eight persons was £500, and eight others\r\n  gave £128 : 15s. per annum to provide coals and fuel.\r\n\r\n  There were two charity schools, one for fifty boys and one for fifty\r\n  girls, and without the Liberty there were two for thirty boys and\r\n  twenty girls. There were also three almshouses, for eight poor\r\n  people, who had from 5s. to 15s. paid them every quarter by the\r\n  Company of Armourers.\r\n\r\n  Rowland Lee (d. 1543), D.D., Bishop of Lichfield, was a rector here;\r\n  also C. Blake (1664-1739), divine and poet; and John Rogers, who was\r\n  burnt at Smithfield, 1555.\r\n\r\n=Giltspur Street=, which is alternately called by Stow Knightrider’s\r\nStreet, is obviously connected with the knights riding to Smithfield.\r\n\r\nAt the south end is a low building with the inscription, “The water\r\nhouse erected 1791.” To the north of this are the schools, in a long low\r\nbuilding covered with rough stucco. Little wych-elms and limes shadow\r\nthe small playground before them. The row of houses succeeding are all\r\nsimilar—plain, severe brick; in the middle is the White Hart Hotel.\r\nGreen Dragon Yard is closed by iron gates; the next court is very small.\r\nNear Windmill Court is the Plough public-house. The houses here are\r\neither brick or stucco; some old, some modern.\r\n\r\nAt the north end, on the Fortune of War public-house, at the corner of\r\nHosier Lane, is a quaint little stucco figure of a fat child about a\r\ncouple of feet high. This is _Pie Corner_, the spot where the Great Fire\r\nended.\r\n\r\n=Cock Lane= is a filthy, narrow little street, and looks almost\r\ndeserted, as many of the buildings are untenanted. Bits of paper and\r\nrefuse bestrew the pavement, grimy old warehouses stand in melancholy\r\ndisorder with dirty little yards between. It is chiefly associated with\r\nthe ridiculous imposture known as the Cock Lane Ghost, which deceived\r\neven Dr. Johnson. For Smithfield see p. 357.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the streets south of Newgate, we find =Warwick Lane= is\r\nmentioned in the Guildhall MSS. as early as 1206; by Riley (_Mem._) in\r\n1313, and in the _Calendar of Wills_ in 1364; in Eldedene Street (Old\r\nDean Street) Hon. Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, had a town house.\r\nIn the _Chronicle of the Mayors and Sheriffs_ a brief account of his\r\nmurder by the mob is presented.\r\n\r\nWarwick Inn, Stow says, was formerly described as a messuage in Eldedene\r\nLane in 28th Henry VI., when Cecily, Duchess of Warwick, possessed it.\r\nThere were other houses in the Lane in the fourteenth century. It was in\r\nthis house that the Earl of Warwick maintained his following of 600 men\r\nwhen he was in London.\r\n\r\nWe have already read (pp. 4, 6) of the beheading of Walter Stapleton,\r\nBishop of Exeter, in Cheapside; he was seized as he was riding towards\r\nhis hostel in “Eldedeaneslane” to dine there; and just then he was\r\nproclaimed a traitor: upon hearing of which he took to flight and rode\r\ntowards St. Paul’s church, where he was met and instantly dragged from\r\nhis horse, and carried into “Chepe”: and there he was despoiled, and his\r\nhead cut off. Also one of his esquires, William Walle by name, and John\r\nde Padington, warden of the said bishop’s manor, were beheaded the same\r\nday in Chepe. On the same day towards Vespers came the choir of St.\r\nPaul’s and took the headless body of the bishop into St. Paul’s, where\r\nthey were given to understand that he had died under sentence, upon\r\nwhich the body was carried to the church of St. Clement [Danes].\r\n\r\nAbout the same date is a grant by Godfrey de Acra, chaplain to the Dean\r\nand Chapter of St. Paul’s, and to a perpetual chaplain who shall\r\ncelebrate for him and his benefactors in the chapel of St. James, in St.\r\nPaul’s, of all his houses, rents, etc., in the parish of St. Faith,\r\n“inter vicum veteris Decani versus occidentem et vicum Cecilie de Turri\r\nversus orientem.” He made provision for the maintenance of the chaplain,\r\nand for the distribution of the money on his anniversary: Thomas Fitz\r\nThomas, Mayor of London, and eleven others are named as witnesses\r\n(Historical MSS., Com. Rep. IX. Pt. I. p. 9a).\r\n\r\nSir John Paston (1475) writes to his brother, John Paston, or to his\r\nuncle, William Paston, in Warwick Lane. The street had, therefore, in\r\nthe fifteenth century received its new name after the great house of the\r\nEarl of Warwick. In 1496 William Paston wills that all “godes moveable\r\nin Warwikes Inn” shall be sold to pay his debts. When Charles V. came to\r\nEngland in 1522, two houses in Warwick Lane were assigned to his\r\nretinue—that of Mistress Lewes having a little entry, a hall, two\r\nchambers, and three feather beds; the other that of Edward Sharnebroke\r\nhaving one hall, four chambers, two parlours, a chapel, four feather\r\nbeds, with houses of office, and a stable for eight horses.\r\n\r\nIn the Historical MSS. Report IX. there are many deeds and documents in\r\nwhich this street is mentioned. Roman remains have been found here.\r\n\r\nIn the street stood the _College of Physicians_ built by Wren.\r\n\r\nThe first house of the College was that of Linacre, physician to Henry\r\nVIII., the founder of the College in Knightrider Street: the Physicians\r\nthen moved to Amen Corner and, after the Fire, to Warwick Lane, where\r\nthey continued until 1823 when the new College in Pall Mall East was\r\nopened by Sir Henry Halford.\r\n\r\nThere were two famous inns in Warwick Lane, of which one was the Bell.\r\n\r\n“Archbishop Leighton used often to say that if he were to choose a place\r\nto die in, it should be an Inn; it looking like a pilgrim’s going home,\r\nto whom this world was all as an Inn, and who was weary of the noise and\r\nconfusion in it. He added that the officious tenderness and care of\r\nfriends was an entanglement to a dying man; and that the unconcerned\r\nattendance of those that could be procured in such a place would give\r\nless disturbance. And he obtained what he desired; for he died [1684] at\r\nthe Bell Inn in Warwick Lane.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE OXFORD ARMS, WARWICK LANE\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inn has gone, but Old Bell Inn Yard, now a railway booking-office\r\nwagon yard, is there to mark the site. On the west side was an equally\r\nfamous inn, the Oxford Arms.\r\n\r\nAt the Oxford Arms Inn lived John Roberts, from whose shop issued the\r\nmajority of the squibs and libels on Pope. The inn was south of Warwick\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nViews of this picturesque old inn have been preserved in the Crace\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe Cutlers’ Hall adds vivid colour to Warwick Lane farther north by its\r\nbrilliant red brick, and its handsome frieze in relief. It is faced with\r\nred sandstone. The next few houses look doubly grimy by contrast with\r\ntheir neighbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CUTLERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  An Ordinance of the Cutlers was enrolled in the Guildhall in the\r\n  year 1380. Their dissensions with the Sheath-makers were settled in\r\n  1408; and in 1413 we find (Riley, p. 597) the freedom of the City\r\n  withdrawn from one William Wysman because, being already a member of\r\n  the trade of Cutlers, he had joined that of the Coursers\r\n  (horse-dealers).\r\n\r\n  There are no means for supplying the exact date of the foundation of\r\n  the Company, but it would appear that it was in existence in the\r\n  year 49 Edward III., as at that time it was stated to have elected\r\n  two members of the Court of Common Council.\r\n\r\n  It would appear that the first charter granted to the Company was in\r\n  the reign of Henry V., 1415, which was confirmed by a charter of\r\n  Henry VI. in 1422. Charters were also granted by Henry VIII. in\r\n  1509, Philip and Mary in 1553, Elizabeth in 1558, and James I. in\r\n  1607. James II., in 1685, revoked these charters; but in 1668 the\r\n  Act of James II. was made void, and by a statute of William and Mary\r\n  in 1689 the charter of James I. was confirmed, and it was\r\n  subsequently reaffirmed by a charter of Queen Anne in 1703. The\r\n  charter, therefore, of James I., which was granted in 1607, is now\r\n  the governing charter of the Cutlers’ Company. The Company has no\r\n  means of furnishing an abstract of the earlier charters, nor would\r\n  this appear to be necessary, inasmuch as they are documents of\r\n  record.\r\n\r\n  The Cutlers were united some time with the Sheath- and Haft-makers,\r\n  a fact commemorated in their arms, the supporters of which are two\r\n  elephants.\r\n\r\n  In 1898 the number of the livery was 100; the Corporate Income was\r\n  £5350; the Trust Income £50.\r\n\r\n  On the south side of Cloak Lane, east of College Hill, is the old\r\n  site of Cutlers’ Hall. The history is retraceable to the twelfth\r\n  century. Lawrence Gisors, living, apparently, in the reign of Henry\r\n  III., possessed this land: his son Peter succeeded; Peter’s son\r\n  John, by will enrolled 1282, ordained that his houses in St.\r\n  Michael, Paternostercherche parish, should be sold to fulfil his\r\n  testament:[34] the site in question was presumably involved. Stow\r\n  records, without giving a date, that it afterwards passed to Hugonis\r\n  de Dingham; moreover, that in 1296 Richard de Wilehale confirmed to\r\n  Paul Butelar the edifices upon the same land. The boundaries at the\r\n  time were: the stream of Walbrook on the east; Wilehale’s own\r\n  tenement to the south; Paternoster-church Lane, now College Hill, on\r\n  the west. Butelar was to pay yearly “one clove Gereflowers[35] at\r\n  Easter, and to the prior and convent of St. Mary Overie, Southwark,\r\n  six shillings.” Simon Dolseley, pepperer, mayor 1359, owned it and\r\n  bequeathed it for life to his wife Johanna by will dated 1362.[36]\r\n  In the year 1451 Thomas Frill executed to the Cutlers Company a\r\n  conveyance of messuages in College Hill and Cloak Lane. The property\r\n  consisted of two houses: one became converted into the Company’s\r\n  Hall, and one served as a house for their beadle. The Fire of 1666\r\n  necessitated complete rebuilding. The new hall was erected in\r\n  1667-68; it received Maitland’s praise in 1739 as “convenient and\r\n  beautiful.” Allen, 1828, differs: in his eyes it was “a plain brick\r\n  building, totally devoid of architectural adornment.”\r\n\r\n  When the Cutlers’ old Hall was pulled down the present College Hill\r\n  Chambers was built upon its site.[37]\r\n\r\nOn the north-west corner of Warwick Lane is an effigy of Guy, Earl of\r\nWarwick. He is dressed as a knight in armour, and the stone bears date\r\n1668. The capital letters “G. C.” on one side, and below are the words—\r\n\r\n  Restored J. Deykes 1817 a ch. 492, Pennant’s _London_, 5th edit.\r\n\r\nThe last word and the date are only conjectural, being considerably worn\r\naway.\r\n\r\n=White Hart Street=, on the east side of Warwick Lane, connected it with\r\nNewgate Market, the square afterwards called Paternoster Square. White\r\nHart Street was chiefly occupied by poulterers.\r\n\r\n=Rose Street= connected Newgate Street with Newgate market.\r\n\r\n=Ivy Lane= occurs in 1312, where an Inquisition was held as to a piece\r\nof land between that and Warwick Lane. It was also called Fulk-mere-lane\r\nor Folks-mare-lane. Riley (_Memorials_, p. xii.) thinks that Ivy Lane\r\nwas inhabited in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by wax\r\nchandlers, who supplied wax tapers for St. Paul’s and the City churches.\r\nThe symbolic use of the lighted taper, borne through the streets by way\r\nof punishment and penance, is not easy to understand in a country and an\r\nage when, happily, ecclesiastical symbolism is little practised. There\r\nwas a club held at the King’s Head Tavern in Ivy Lane, 1749-65. Dr.\r\nJohnson was a member. Every visitor to London turns out of St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard or Newgate Street to see the sign still remaining on the east\r\nwall of Panyer Alley. It consists of a pannier with a boy sitting upon\r\nit, and the inscription—\r\n\r\n                 When you have sought the City round,\r\n                 Yet still this is the highest ground,\r\n\r\nwith the date August 26, 1668. I believe that this is not the highest\r\nground. The site of the “Standard” in Cornhill is slightly higher.\r\n\r\nNewgate Street formerly ended at Panyer Alley, where Blowbladder Street\r\nbegan, which ran on into Cheapside, and is now included in it.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, by a glance at the map, that Newgate Street was here a\r\ncontinuation of Cheapside. So far Stow’s statement about the continued\r\nstreet from Aldgate to Ludgate is confirmed. But if we consider the\r\nimprovements effected here after the Fire, we shall understand that\r\nthere was at first no thought of a continuation of Cheapside into\r\nNewgate.\r\n\r\nNewgate Street, then, ended at Panyer Alley. What followed was a narrow\r\nlane bending sharply to the south. Into this lane on the north ran\r\nanother narrow lane, now St. Martin’s-le-Grand. Panyer Alley was a\r\npassage only wide enough for one person at a time, and there were many\r\nof these narrow passages from one street to another. After the Fire,\r\nBlowbladder Street was enlarged to the breadth of 40 feet. This increase\r\nof width made it possible for Newgate Street to appear as a continuation\r\nof Cheapside; the lane running through St. Martin’s-le-Grand was also\r\nenlarged to the breadth of 40 feet; and Panyer Alley was enlarged to the\r\nbreadth of 9 feet and paved with freestone. Further, to block the\r\npassage from Cheapside to Newgate, there stood outside Paternoster Row\r\nthe parish church of St. Michael le Querne.\r\n\r\n=St. Michael le Querne= derived its name Querne, or Corn, from its\r\nproximity to a corn-market. It was repaired in 1617, but burnt down in\r\nthe Great Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of St.\r\nVedast. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1274.\r\n\r\nThe church has always been in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of St.\r\nPaul’s.\r\n\r\nHouseling people in 1548 were 350.\r\n\r\nChantries were founded here: By Robert Newcomen, at the Altar of the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary about 1304, for himself and for Matilda his\r\nwife—William Wilton was chaplain and died in 1370; by John Combe, at the\r\nAltar of St. Katherine, for himself, and Petronella his wife—licence was\r\ngranted by the King, May 18, 1405; by John Lydat, whose will was dated\r\nJune 23, 1545—he gave £7 : 10s. for a priest for seven years; by John\r\nMundham before 1310.\r\n\r\nJohn Leland, the antiquary, was buried here in 1552; his monument\r\nperished in the Fire, but his great work, _The Itinerary_, still\r\nremains. The church also contained a monument in memory of John Bankes\r\nwho died in 1630, leaving £6000 to be distributed amongst various\r\ncharities and parishes. In 1605 Sir Thomas Browne, author of _Religio\r\nMedici_, was baptized here.\r\n\r\nThere were several bequests given to the poor for clothing and bread;\r\nbut no names are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\nAnthony Tuckney (1599-1670), Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and\r\nVice-Chancellor of Cambridge, was rector here; also George Downham (d.\r\n1634), Bishop of Derry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ST. PAUL’S\r\n\r\n                            By W. J. LOFTIE\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Paul’s Church is the cathedral of the diocese of London, and was so\r\ndedicated by its first founder. According to Beda, this was Ethelbert,\r\nKing of Kent, “who had command over all the nations of the English as\r\nfar as the river Humber.” His nephew, Sebert, King of the East Saxons,\r\nheld London in 604, when Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nsent Mellitus to preach Christianity north of the Thames. He does not\r\nseem to have succeeded very well, and after the deaths of Augustine,\r\nEthelbert and Sebert, Mellitus was expelled. From that time for sixty\r\nyears or more, we hear nothing of St. Paul’s, and the next bishops of\r\nthe East Saxons do not seem to have lived in London. They converted the\r\nkings who made Rendlesham, Tillingham, and Tilbury their headquarters.\r\nThe City within the Roman wall was probably but sparsely inhabited. The\r\nAnglo-Saxons disliked Roman sites, and especially hated the repair of\r\nwalls. There is a tradition that Erkenwald, or Archibald, the fourth\r\nbishop, incited the Londoners to this task and himself built the\r\nnorthern gate, since named Bishopsgate. Another tradition relates that\r\nat his death, which is variously placed in 685 and 693, the citizens\r\nburied his body in the cathedral. In 1148, it was translated into a\r\nsumptuous tomb. Against the whole legend of St. Erkenwald, as it grew in\r\nthe Middle Ages, there is so much of inconsistent anachronism to be\r\nalleged that we must pass it by, merely assuming that a bishop of that\r\nname comes fourth on the list, that he was designated by Ini, King of\r\nWessex, a predecessor of Alfred, as “Erkenwald, my bishop,” and that he\r\nmade a serious effort to restore the bishopric to the “bishop’s stool”\r\nof Mellitus.\r\n\r\nAuthentic history, however, does not begin till the time of King Alfred.\r\nEven here we cannot be certain of the name of the bishop for whom the\r\nKing built or rebuilt the cathedral church, but it was probably\r\nHeathstan, or Ethelstan, who died in 898. It is not even certain that\r\nthe old site was retained. When Alfred came to London he saw its\r\ncapabilities as a bulwark against the Danes: but the Roman wall was\r\nempty. For thirty years, we read, London had lain desolate. Alfred\r\nrepaired the wall. He probably built the church. He revived as much as\r\nhe could the ancient memories. The two land gates were placed nearly,\r\nthough not exactly, on the Roman sites—one, Bishopsgate, opening on the\r\ntwo great northern roads, and the other, Westgate, on the Watling\r\nStreet. It is possible that he repaired the bridge. The church was\r\nplaced in the triangular space cut off by the course of the Watling\r\nStreet from the bridge through the City, and when the wards were divided\r\nthis corner became the _Warda Episcopi_.\r\n\r\nThe bishop figures as an alderman in the first list of the wards which\r\nhas come down to us. It must have been drawn up about forty years after\r\nthe Norman Conquest, and is now preserved in the cathedral library. It\r\nis a list of the City lands which belonged to St. Paul’s, arranged in\r\nwards, of which twenty are enumerated. The first is the bishop’s. The\r\nbishop, at this time always a Norman, or Frenchman, as he was called,\r\nwas probably but little acquainted with English, and his jurisdiction\r\nwas exercised by a deputy, called in Latin _prepositus_, that is\r\nprovost. A provost was the abbot’s deputy at Bury St. Edmund’s, and the\r\ntitle was later also assumed by other laymen who acted for\r\necclesiastical personages, as the provost of the Alderman of Portsoken,\r\nwho was the Prior of Aldgate.\r\n\r\nWhen William the Conqueror granted to the citizens the brief charter\r\nwhich is still at Guildhall, he addressed the bishop and the portreeve.\r\nThe King, that is, wrote to the alderman who had charge of the\r\necclesiastical government, and to the alderman who had charge of the\r\ncivil government:—“William, King, greets William, Bishop, and Gosfrith,\r\nPortreeve.” Bishop and Alderman William, a Norman who had been chaplain\r\nto Edward the Confessor, had succeeded Bishop Robert, also a Norman, in\r\n1051. He was succeeded by Hugh de Orivalle, another Norman, in 1075; so\r\nwe obtain approximately the date of the charter, namely, between 1066\r\nand 1075. The date of the document in which we have mention of the\r\nBishop’s ward was after 1108, from internal evidence, but probably\r\nbefore 1115.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the cathedral was according to the system which has\r\nbeen aptly named “the old foundation.” This pattern was followed in\r\nother cathedrals throughout England wherever there was no monastery\r\nattached to the church; and as the municipal government of London was\r\nimitated in other cities, so the “Government Spirituell” of St. Paul’s\r\nwas taken as a model at York, Chichester, Exeter, Wells, Hereford,\r\nLincoln, and six or seven other churches where there were no monks. The\r\nservices were conducted by priests, who held estates both singly and as\r\na corporation. There were generally more canons than estates. At St.\r\nPaul’s there were thirty, and a majority of them had each a manor\r\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood of London. There they lived like other\r\nlords of manors, with their wives and children, much respected, no\r\ndoubt, for their “clergy,” or clerkly learning, in districts where none\r\nof their neighbours could read or write, except, perhaps, the parsons of\r\nthe parish churches, who in many cases, like their patrons, had wives\r\nand children. Their chief anxieties besides those common to a country\r\nlife were the fear of Danish incursions, and the chance of being able to\r\nleave their prebendal stalls to their sons. The care of the estates,\r\nboth in the City and in places more distant from the church, constantly\r\noccupied the chapter. To it we owe the list of wards mentioned above.\r\nNewcourt tells us of a meeting of the canons in 1150, which was long\r\nremembered as a settlement of various important questions. It was known\r\nas the “Constitution concerning bread and beer.” Among the prebendal\r\nmanors some are described in Domesday Book as being “held by the Canons\r\nfor their food.” One of these is Willesden. There was a Canon of\r\nWillesden, but apart from his estate the rest of the manor was held by\r\n“villains,” their rent going towards the provision of bread and beer in\r\nthe bakery and brewery at St. Paul’s. It was resolved in 1150 to break\r\nup the whole manor, in order to endow those canons who had previously\r\ndepended only on “surplice fees.” Mapesbury, Brondesbury, and Brownswood\r\nmay be named as being called from the first canons after this\r\narrangement. Walter Map, in particular, is remembered still for his\r\nwitty poems, in rhyming Latin, satirising the married clergy; and the\r\nname may be seen on a prebendal stall (12th on south side) in St.\r\nPaul’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE POST OFFICE, ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL, AND BULL AND MOUTH INN, LONDON\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe staff of the cathedral consisted first of the dean; next to him were\r\nfour archdeacons, London, Essex, Middlesex, and Colchester, to which, at\r\nthe Reformation, St. Albans was added, to be transferred with the\r\narchdeaconries of Essex and Colchester to the new See of St. Albans in\r\n1877. It should be observed that previously Essex came next after London\r\nin dignity and before Middlesex, Colchester, and St. Albans, a little\r\nhistorical point on which it would be easy to enlarge. After the\r\narchdeacons came the precentor “likewise called Cantor,” whose office it\r\nwas “to look after the singing-men and singing”; the treasurer, whose\r\noffice does not seem to have existed till after the Conquest; and the\r\nchancellor, who was at first called “magister scholarum,” and had charge\r\nof education in the City, with the duty of appointing the master of St.\r\nPaul’s School, “not,” says Newcourt, “that long after founded by Dean\r\nColet,” but that which was endowed by Bishop Richard Belmeis or Balmes\r\nin the reign of Henry I. After these officers came the thirty canons, of\r\nwhom there are some further notes below. In 1845 the canons, generally\r\nnow described as “prebendaries,” were superseded by four canons\r\nresidentiary, who with the dean and the archdeacons form the present\r\nchapter. They have no prebendal estates but are called canons. A college\r\nof minor canons was formed at an early period, and incorporated by\r\ncharter of Richard II. in 1394. It consists of eight members, formerly\r\ntwelve, answering to the Vicars at Wells. The close stands in the\r\nparishes of St. Augustine, St. Faith, St. Mary Magdalene, and St.\r\nGregory. The arms of the Dean and Chapter are “Gules, two swords, in\r\nsaltire, proper; in chief the letter, D. or.” One sword, on a shield, is\r\ncarved in many places and forms a kind of badge; the same sword,\r\nemblematic of St. Paul, appearing also in the arms of the City, where it\r\nis often mistaken for the dagger of Walworth.\r\n\r\nIt may be added here that there seems to be evidence that at first St.\r\nPaul’s was one of the three or four City parish churches; that the Dean\r\nand Chapter gradually divided the _warda episcopi_ into smaller parishes\r\nand built churches on them, while the clergy of St. Paul’s ceased to\r\nperform parochial functions. It is not now reckoned parochial, though in\r\nrare cases marriages have been performed in it by special licence, and\r\nthere is a register which begins in 1697, the year of the opening of the\r\nnew church.\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation the estates of the bishop, the dean, and the\r\ncanons were very extensive, and formed almost a semicircle round the\r\nCity, from Stepney on the east to Willesden on the west. Other estates\r\nwere in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex, while there were\r\nisolated holdings in all the City wards. The canons at first preserved\r\ntheir prebendal estates with jealous care, residing on them and, as has\r\nbeen said, hoping to leave them to their sons. After the enforcement of\r\nthe celibacy of the clergy as one of the consequences of King John’s\r\nsubmission to the Pope, the canons leased away their estates until there\r\nwas nothing left. Thus, in 1315, Robert Baldock leased Finsbury to the\r\nmayor and commons of London at £1 a year, and the lease was only\r\nterminated by the Ecclesiastical Commission in 1867. The manor of\r\nPortpoole formed the chief estate of the Lords Grey of Ruthin, and is\r\nnow Gray’s Inn. Rugmere, part of which is Bloomsbury, part St. Giles’s,\r\nWenlakesbarn, Ealdstreet, now Old Street, Hoxton, Cantlers, Islington,\r\nand the rest, were all leased away, and are now, for the most part, the\r\nprincipal endowments of wealthy noblemen. Cantlers, now Kentish town,\r\npaid £80 a year to the lord of the manor, now presumably to the\r\nCommissioners. The owner of the lease is the Marquis Camden. This is one\r\nexample only. As late as the middle of thirteenth century we find\r\nmention of the families of canons. A very prominent member of the\r\nchapter in 1145 was prebendary of St. Pancras, Osbert “de Auco,” who was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Robert, whose son, John, does not seem to have\r\nbecome a priest; and Robert de Auco was succeeded at his death by\r\nWalter, the son of the bishop. Before 1138 we meet with the names of\r\nWlured and his two sons, all canons. Gervase of Canterbury, a canon, had\r\na son, John. Richard, a canon, was son of Archdeacon Richard. The manor\r\nof Caddington Major, now called Aston Bury in Bedfordshire, was held by\r\nRoger the Archdeacon, son of Robert the Archdeacon. A little earlier we\r\nfind that Ralph Flambard, appointed Bishop of Durham in 1099, who\r\nfigures in the history of the Tower of London in the reign of Henry II.,\r\nand who died in 1128, was prebendary of Tatenhall. His son, Elias, was\r\nprebendary of Sneating, near Kirkeby in Essex, where he was succeeded by\r\nWilliam, son of Archdeacon Otho, at whose death Ralph, brother of Canon\r\nElias, a younger son of the Bishop of Durham, succeeded to the stall. Of\r\nanother of the married archdeacons, Nicholas Croceman, we read that he\r\nheld Oxgate, and that his son, another Nicholas, succeeded him in both\r\narchdeaconry and canonry. One of the two Bishops Balmes had two sons,\r\nHenry, prebendary of Mora, and Walter, of Newington, in the reign of\r\nHenry II. The first bishop appointed by Richard I. was his treasurer,\r\nthe son of Nigel, Bishop of Ely; he was one of the most eminent of those\r\nwho held the See of London in the twelfth century, and figures as Bishop\r\nRichard Fitz Neal. In short, before the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury we may assume that most of the secular clergy were married men,\r\nand the enforcement of celibacy, no doubt, was one of the causes of the\r\nunpopularity of the Church in London before the Reformation; while it\r\nled indirectly to the alienation of the prebendal estates.\r\n\r\nOld St. Paul’s is the name by which the building destroyed in the Great\r\nFire of 1666 is usually distinguished. All that is left of it may be\r\ntraced within the railings on the south side of the present cathedral.\r\nThe original church of Alfred and his successors perished in 962, and\r\nthe new building then set up was burnt in 1136. Old St. Paul’s may be\r\nsaid, therefore, to date from the middle of the twelfth century, but it\r\nwas continually being altered and added to until 1633, when it was\r\ncompleted by the construction of a magnificent portico at the west end\r\nby Inigo Jones. The spire seems to have been the tallest in Christendom,\r\nrising 520 feet to the eagle and cross, which contained a portion of the\r\ntrue cross. It was finished in 1498, but was burnt in 1561 and never\r\nrebuilt. The nave and choir each contained twelve bays united by a wide\r\ntransept. The arches of the nave and transept were Norman, of the east\r\nend pointed, a great rose window terminating the Chapel of St. Mary, and\r\noverlooking the west end of Cheap, on which it encroached. The\r\nCorinthian pillars of the portico did not look incongruous with the\r\nRomanesque nave and the similar little church of St. Gregory which stood\r\non the south side. The western towers, one of which was described as the\r\nLollard’s Tower, were low but massive. A bell tower was at the east end\r\nof the churchyard until Sir Miles Partridge won it “at one cast of the\r\ndice,” says Dugdale, from Henry VIII., and pulled it down. The famous\r\nPaul’s Cross, where public sermons were preached, stood on the north\r\nside of the choir, and a chapel, or charnel house, near it, “having\r\nunder it a vault, wherein the bones taken out of sundry graves in that\r\ncemetery were, with great respect and care decently piled together.”\r\nThis chapel had a warden and an establishment of priests. Another\r\nsimilar chapel was in “Pardon Church Yard,” a little to the westward,\r\nand had a cloister painted with the Dance of Death, with “English verses\r\nto explain the meaning, translated out of French by John Lydgate, a monk\r\nof St. Edmond’s Bury,” says Dugdale. Over the cloister was a library.\r\nAnother cloister, of which some relics remain, was on the south side of\r\nthe nave and was built in 1332, together with a chapter-house. This\r\nbuilding occupied the site of a garden, south of which, between the\r\nchurch and Paul’s Wharf, was a tilt yard, used by Lord Fitzwalter for\r\ndrilling the City Trained Bands. It is marked for us by Paul’s Chain and\r\nKnightrider Street. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the\r\ndoctrine of masses for the dead attained a great height, and it is\r\nbelieved that at least one hundred mass priests attended daily at St.\r\nPaul’s. Churches were no longer built in the City but chantries\r\nmultiplied everywhere, especially after the Black Death in the middle of\r\nthe fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe church was very full of monuments. Some were shrines of legendary\r\nsaints, among which may be reckoned the supposed tombs of King Sebert\r\nand Bishop Erkenwald, both held in great veneration. What Becket became\r\nat Canterbury, the canons tried to make of Erkenwald at St. Paul’s, and\r\nthe shrine was covered with gold and precious stones. There were many\r\nrelics, including the arm of Mellitus, and most of the oblations seem to\r\nhave been preserved in the north aisle of the choir till Henry VIII.\r\nsent them in cart loads to the Jewel Tower. (More may be read on the\r\nsubject in Sparrow Simpson’s _St. Paul’s and Old City Life_.) The\r\nmonuments included many chantries with altars, no fewer than\r\nseventy-three being enumerated in the fourteenth century. The cost may\r\nbe estimated by what Dr. R. Sharpe tells us. A bequest of twenty-five\r\nshillings secured three hundred masses. There were thirty-five of these\r\naltars at the Reformation, employing only fifty-four priests owing to a\r\nmovement for uniting them, and there were fifty-four obits. The mass\r\npriests and their dissolute lives had, no doubt, much to do with the\r\nwelcome accorded in London to the reforms of Henry VIII. and Edward VI.\r\nAmong the finest monuments were those of John of Gaunt; Sir John\r\nBeauchamp, which was usually called Duke Humphry’s; and of many of the\r\nbishops, including Bishop William Kemp, Chishull, and others. After the\r\nReformation many “marble hearses” of great size and magnificence were\r\nerected, among others to Dean Colet, Sir William Hewit, Sir Nicholas\r\nBacon, Sir William Cokain, the earl and countess of Pembroke, William\r\nAubrey, John Wolley, Sir Thomas Heneage, and especially to Sir\r\nChristopher Hatton, the largest in the church. Fragments still survive\r\nof some of them, and the curious effigy of Dean Donne (d. 1631), rising\r\nlike an Arabian genie from an urn, has been repaired and stands in the\r\nsouth aisle of the choir.\r\n\r\nThe Fire of 1666 broke out on the 2nd September among the bakers’ shops\r\nin Pudding Lane, a thoroughfare of Eastcheap answering to Bread Street\r\nin Westcheap. It reached St. Paul’s on the 3rd, and is briefly described\r\nby Pepys on the 7th as “a miserable sight,” the roofs destroyed, “the\r\nbody of the quire fallen into St. Fayth’s.” Evelyn speaks of the\r\nscaffolds which were up for the repairs as hastening the ruin, and of\r\nthe melting lead running down the streets in a stream. He specially\r\nlaments the loss of Inigo Jones’s portico—immense stones calcined,\r\nornaments, columns, capitals of massy Portland stone flying off. “The\r\nlead over the altar at the east end was untouched and among the divers\r\nmonuments the body of one bishop remained entire.”\r\n\r\nWren, after the Fire, found St. Paul’s completely ruined. The marble\r\nportico was reduced to a heap of lime; the roofs had fallen in; the\r\nchoir had sunk. Nearly all the monuments had perished; and an attempt by\r\nDean Sancroft and the canons to repair a portion at the west end only\r\nadded to the general destruction. Nevertheless, it was not till June 21,\r\n1675, that the first stone was laid of a new cathedral. Various\r\nexperiments had been made in the meanwhile, but they only demonstrated\r\nthe untrustworthy character of the foundations. Contrary to what we\r\noften hear about the mediæval builders, it was abundantly evident that\r\nhere their moving principle had been to produce the greatest effect by\r\nthe cheapest means, stability being everywhere sacrificed to show. The\r\nKing, Charles II., and his brother, afterwards James II., hindered\r\nWren’s work in many ways, design after design being rejected as not\r\nsuitable for the Romanist worship they secretly hoped to re-establish.\r\nWren at length obtained leave to proceed with his task, but one of the\r\nmodels he had prepared is still to be seen in the triforium. Many other\r\ncauses interfered to check the work, and it was long after both the\r\nkings, as well as their successor, Queen Mary II., were dead, in 1697,\r\nthat the choir was ready for use. A celebration of the Peace of Ryswick\r\ntook the place of any form of consecration, such as would now be thought\r\nneedful, and the building was completed in most essential particulars by\r\n1718, when Wren was superseded by a wholly incompetent architect named\r\nBenson, chiefly remembered as building the unfortunate balustrade with\r\nwhich he endeavoured to dwarf Wren’s dome. Wren had already been\r\noverruled as to the decoration of the dome. Benson was dismissed in\r\n1720. A silly story is constantly repeated as to St. Paul’s having been\r\ncompleted by one architect, under one bishop, and with one clerk of the\r\nworks. But Bishop Henchman was in office when Wren began his work, and\r\nwas succeeded by Compton in 1675, who saw the choir finished. After him,\r\nin 1713, came Robinson, who was still in office at the time of Wren’s\r\ndeath. It was under this bishop that Wren was dismissed and subsequently\r\nBenson, and a third architect, Robert Mylne, came in. So, too, several\r\nclerks of the works were employed, among whom we may name Thomas Strong,\r\nwho died in 1681; his brother, Edward, who died in 1723; and Christopher\r\nKempster, who seems to have been told off by Wren to build St. Stephen,\r\nWalbrook, which even more than St. Paul’s commemorates the genius of the\r\ngreat architect. Kempster himself was the architect of the market-house\r\nat Abingdon, often attributed to Inigo Jones; he died in 1715.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photochrom Co., Ltd._\r\n\r\n  ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is well, if possible, to approach St. Paul’s from the west. When it\r\ncomes into sight from the end of Fleet Street, the dome is seen to\r\nadvantage, rising clear of surrounding buildings on the top of a hill.\r\nIn this respect it surpasses the only cathedral church in England which\r\ncan be compared to it, namely Salisbury, which stands on low ground. If\r\nwe compare it with Lincoln or Durham we miss the magnificent central\r\nfeature. The dome competes, especially in a city, very successfully with\r\na spire. As we approach Ludgate Hill, the tower of St. Martin, 158 feet\r\nhigh, offers a measure to the eye—the needlessly ugly railway viaduct\r\ninterfering much less than was feared at first. From Ludgate the two\r\nwestern towers, supporting the double portico, are well seen, and are\r\nesteemed as among the best of Wren’s compositions. The towers, of which\r\nthe southern carries the clock and the great bell, are 220 feet high.\r\nThe whole west front, as seen from the entrance of St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, is 180 feet in height and the same in width. The lower\r\npillars of the portico are 40 feet high. The statue in the front was\r\nsculptured by Francis Bird in 1712, mutilated by a lunatic in 1743, and\r\nrestored a few years ago. Between it and the steps, an inscription, cut\r\nin the granite pavement, commemorates the fact that here the aged Queen\r\nVictoria gave public thanks for the sixty years of her reign in 1897.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the church shows two orders, the lower Corinthian, and\r\nthe upper, what Wren described as “a Composition.” In the tympanum over\r\nthe portico is a relief by Bird representing the conversion of St. Paul,\r\nand on the pediment above are statues of St. Paul between St. Peter and\r\nSt. James. The railing, now removed from the front, is of iron, cast at\r\nLamberhurst in Sussex. The plan of the cathedral is cruciform, the\r\ntransepts north and south ending with graceful semicircular porticoes.\r\nThe east end has a semicircular apse. The cupola, which, as Gwilt says,\r\nrises from the body of the church “in great majesty,” should be seen\r\nfrom near the statue of Peel in Cheapside. A fountain within the rails\r\nmarks the site of Paul’s Cross. From the south a fine view can be\r\nobtained from the little garden in which the foundations of the\r\ncloisters and chapter-house have been uncovered. The gilt cross is 365\r\nfeet above the pavement. The colonnade round the dome is of the\r\ncomposite order, consisting of 32 pillars standing on a circular\r\npedestal 20 feet high and 112 feet in diameter. The columns are not in\r\npairs as at St. Peter’s, but are placed at regular intervals, every\r\nfourth intercolumniation being filled with masonry. A sense of stability\r\nis thus gained without any sacrifice of lightness.\r\n\r\nThe best idea of the interior will be obtained by entering at the west\r\nend. The great central door is only opened on state occasions; but by\r\neither side door we find ourselves in a vestibule with the morning\r\nchapel on the north and the consistorial court, which has been made a\r\nchapel of the order of St. Michael and St. George, on the south. The\r\ncarved oak screens should be observed. At the entrance of the nave are\r\nfine bronze candelabra. The nave consists of three bays clear, which we\r\nenter from the vestibule. There are side aisles, the full width being\r\n102 feet. The height of the central aisle is 89 feet. Beyond the nave,\r\nwhich is 340 feet long, we see the area under the dome, 112 feet across.\r\nBeyond this, the choir extends eastward 140 feet. A screen is seen\r\nbehind the communion table, beyond which in the apse there is a chapel.\r\nThe screen, erected from the designs of Messrs. Bodley and Garner in\r\n1888, takes the place of a baldacchino, which Wren is said to have\r\nintended. The whole length from the west door to the apse is 500 feet.\r\nThe transept from the north door to the south is 250 feet long, or half\r\nthe length, and this simple proportion occurs throughout the building;\r\nbut the western towers are two-thirds the height of the cupola, being\r\nexactly double the height of the adjacent roofs. The windows are 12 feet\r\nwide and 24 feet high; the aisles are 19 feet in clear width by 38 feet\r\nin height. The vestibule is a square of 47 feet and 94 feet high. So,\r\ntoo, the space under the dome, which is 108 feet wide, is 216 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe side aisles lead to the dome and transepts by an ingenious but\r\nsimple plan, which Wren is believed to have adapted from that of Ely\r\nCathedral. The inner dome appears very high when we stand under it, but\r\nit hardly rises above the colonnade of the outer dome. A cone of\r\nbrick-work which interposes between the outer and the inner dome carries\r\nat its apex the ball and cross. The ball is 6 feet 2 inches in diameter,\r\nbut it is only to be attained by a long ascent from the whispering\r\ngallery, 200 feet above the pavement. A curious echo may be remarked\r\nhere. Above the whispering gallery an ascent of 108 steps, some 70 feet,\r\ntakes us to the stone gallery, formed by the balustrade round the\r\nexternal base of the dome, from which a fine view of the far-reaching\r\nCity may be obtained. A winding and difficult stair leads under the\r\nouter dome to the golden gallery, about 100 feet higher, and a farther\r\nclimb of 45 feet is needed before we reach the ball, within which six\r\npeople may be seated. The best external view is from the golden gallery.\r\n\r\nThe same staircase by which we approach the dome takes us to the\r\ntriforium over the south aisle of the nave. At the western extremity is\r\nthe library, and in a room adjacent may be seen a large model which Wren\r\nmade of his first design for the church. In the gallery at the west end\r\nis the collection of ancient records belonging to the Dean and\r\nChapter—some of which are dated as early as the reigns of the Saxon\r\nkings, the immediate successors of Alfred.\r\n\r\nA door into the south-west tower opens just beyond the library, and\r\nadmits to the so-called geometrical staircase.\r\n\r\nThe organ was originally constructed by the famous “Father Schmidt.” He\r\ngave special attention to the wooden pipes. Some of his stops are still\r\nin use, but the instrument which formerly stood across the entrance to\r\nthe choir and interrupted the view from the nave and the dome, has been\r\ndivided and greatly improved, while some of the pipes, which were\r\nuseless for want of room, are now placed in convenient spaces above the\r\nstalls and even in the triforium.\r\n\r\nReturning to the dome we may see and admire the choir stalls, carved in\r\nwood by Grinling Gibbons. Beautiful wreaths of flowers, carved by him in\r\nstone, may be found in many places on the vaulting. The iron work in the\r\ngates, the doors of the choir and many other places well repays\r\nexamination. It was chiefly designed by Tijou. A pair of bronze\r\ncandelabra on the steps of the reredos are copied from an ancient pair\r\nin a Belgian church, which are said to have been taken from old St.\r\nPaul’s after the Fire.\r\n\r\nIn the south choir aisle are the altar tombs of Dean Milman and Bishops\r\nBlomfield and Jackson. A statue of Bishop Heber is at the farther end,\r\nand against a pier the (restored) monument of Dean Donne, from the old\r\nchurch, representing him in his shroud rising from an urn. In a modern\r\nchapel at the extreme east end is the altar tomb of Canon Liddon (d.\r\n1890).\r\n\r\nVery few of the monuments in St. Paul’s can be admired. Beginning at the\r\nwestern end the first we meet is a recumbent figure on a marble\r\nsarcophagus of Lord Leighton (d. 1896). Next is a low cenotaph to\r\nGeneral Gordon, murdered at Khartoum, 1885. The great Wellington\r\nmonument is still incomplete, but is the best example of English\r\nsculpture in the church. It was first placed in the south-west chapel or\r\nconsistorial court, where it could not be seen. In 1895 Lord Leighton,\r\nat that time President of the Royal Academy, formed a committee which\r\nobtained leave to remove it to the middle arch on the north side of the\r\nnave. It is now seen to great advantage, though wanting the equestrian\r\nfigure. The great Duke lies on his bier “with his martial cloak around\r\nhim.” The “cartouches” at either side bear his arms, above the marble\r\narch, which is supported over his head on composite columns. The shafts\r\nare formed of oak leaves. Two bronze groups on the arch represent Virtue\r\ntrampling upon Vice, and Truth silencing Falsehood. Alfred Stevens, the\r\nsculptor, died in 1875, aged 58.\r\n\r\nIn the third bay, against the north wall, is the singular but poetical\r\nmonument by Marochetti, of the brothers Lamb, successive Viscounts\r\nMelbourne. The elder, William, was Queen Victoria’s first prime minister\r\nand died in 1848. The younger, Frederick, Lord Beauvale, died five years\r\nlater. An ebony door, on which the names and dates are inscribed in\r\ngold, is guarded on either side by the Angels of Death and of the\r\nResurrection, sculptured in white marble. The design and sentiment excel\r\nthe execution.\r\n\r\nSeveral large monuments are in the south aisle of the nave, chiefly in\r\nvery bad taste. Almost every panel in both aisles has its tablet\r\ncommemorating naval or military heroes. The pulpit is a memorial of an\r\nofficer, Fitzgerald; and the tombs of several other men of Indian fame,\r\nincluding three Napiers, are in the north transept, and compete in\r\npoverty of design and sculpture with Bacon’s absurd figure of Dr.\r\nJohnson, who was buried at Westminster, and his John Howard (d. 1790),\r\nthe first statue set up in the church. Somewhat better than its\r\nneighbours is Rossi’s monument, in the north transept, of Lord Rodney\r\nbetween figures supposed to represent Fame and the Historic Muse. Nelson\r\nand Cornwallis face each other across the south transept, each\r\nsurrounded by allegorical groups, wholly inappropriate to the place.\r\nThere are also monuments of Sir John Moore, Sir Ralph Abercromby, Lord\r\nHeathfield, Lord Howe, Sir Henry Lawrence, and many more of which it may\r\nsafely be said that not one is worthy either of the situation or of the\r\npersonage commemorated. Mr. Birch quotes the opinion that at St. Paul’s\r\nthe apostles are placed outside and the heathen divinities within. Much\r\nmore satisfactory is the brief inscription over the inner portico of the\r\nnorth door which speaks of the career of Sir Christopher Wren “who lived\r\nnot for his own good but for that of the public,” and ends with the\r\nwords—“Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice”; to which we may add\r\nWren’s own saying, “Building is for eternity.”\r\n\r\nThe roof of the choir and of the apse beyond it now glow, as Wren\r\ndesired they should, with colour and gold. The designs by Sir William\r\nRichmond, K.C.B., R.A., have been carried out under his personal\r\nsuperintendence in English mosaic, which should be viewed with a strong\r\nopera-glass. The faces of the principal figures represented will repay a\r\nlittle trouble. The central figure at the east end is above life-size\r\nbut carefully adapted to the general proportions, already mentioned, of\r\nthe building. Each panel is a picture, and the scheme is worked out in\r\nthe stained glass of the windows, while the harmony of colour, form, and\r\nproportion produces an effect upon the mind comparable only with that of\r\nthe best music. Unfortunately, the designs for the figures of prophets\r\nand evangelists, under the dome, seem to have been made in ignorance or\r\ndefiance of the conditions by which Sir William Richmond has been\r\nguided; while they are dull, heavy, and dark in colour. They were\r\nproduced some fifty years ago, and have a highly discordant effect.\r\n\r\nSir William Richmond’s work has been carried out in conformity with a\r\nsettled plan, based upon the proportions of the whole building. At the\r\neast end, the roof of the apse shows the figure of Our Lord seated, with\r\nuplifted hands. In the adjoining panels right and left are Recording\r\nAngels, attended by winged cherubim. The lower rectangular spaces are\r\nfilled with figures of the Virtues and such scenes as the sacrifice of\r\nNoah and the blessing of Abraham. Many other allusive and allegorical\r\nsubjects fill the panels of the vaulting as far as the entrance of the\r\nchoir, supplemented by abundant gilding and by marble inlay, all\r\ncarefully harmonised and subdued so as to produce a gorgeous but not a\r\ngarish effect. The stained-glass windows are similarly subdued to the\r\ngeneral scheme of colour, and the result gives great encouragement to\r\nthose who would see the dome similarly treated if not the nave and\r\ntransepts also—a work of such magnitude that few of us can hope ever to\r\nsee it accomplished.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA door in the south transept admits the visitor to the crypt, a very\r\ninteresting part of the church. It appeals to the architect and\r\nscientific builder as well as to the historical student and the\r\nsightseer. We can study Wren’s methods of construction here much more\r\nreadily than above, and can, moreover, see where he was eventually\r\nforced to alter the plans with which he commenced operations, and which\r\nwere in his mind in the preparative work here apparent. First at the\r\nfoot of the steps we reach “the Artists’ Corner.” At the eastern end,\r\njust where it is believed the high altar of Old St. Paul’s was placed,\r\nis the grave of the great architect himself. It is inscribed with the\r\nmemorable sentence already quoted as over the northern entrance. Close\r\nby are the graves of Reynolds, Turner, Landseer, and other great\r\npainters including Lord Leighton and Sir J. E. Millais. Some eminent\r\narchitects are near—Mylne, who succeeded as surveyor of St. Paul’s, and\r\nCockerell who came after him. Goss, part of whose funeral ode on\r\nWellington is inscribed on his tombstone, and Boyce represent music. In\r\nthe crypt too were laid the scanty remains found in the Arabian desert\r\nof Palmer and his companions, murdered in 1882. Sir Bartle Frere and\r\nanother great colonial statesman, Dalley, are both laid here. But to\r\nmost visitors no tombs or memorials are so interesting as those of\r\nNelson and Wellington. In a kind of chapel marked by its own candelabra,\r\nand situated just under the choir, the lofty sarcophagus which contains\r\nthe body of the great Duke forms a conspicuous object in the view. It is\r\nformed of a large block of red porphyry from Cornwall, standing on a\r\npedestal of the same stone, and a base of grey granite—all studiously\r\nplain. The funeral took place in 1852, three months after Wellington’s\r\ndeath; even then the sepulchre was not ready and the coffin rested for\r\nsome weeks on the Nelson tomb farther east. Beside the Duke are the\r\nremains of Sir Thomas Picton, his comrade and lieutenant at Waterloo.\r\nPicton was killed in the battle, and his body was brought home to his\r\nhouse in Edwardes Street, now Seymour Street, Portman Square. Thence it\r\nwas removed to the vaults of the chapel of St. George, now altered, in\r\nthe Uxbridge Road, where it rested till 1859, when, nearly seven years\r\nafter Wellington’s funeral, it was brought here. The tomb of Nelson is\r\nunder the dome. He died on October 21, 1805, at the great victory of\r\nTrafalgar, and his body was brought home and buried here. It had been\r\nintended that his coffin should be enclosed in a black marble\r\nsarcophagus which, lying unused in Wolsey’s Chapel at Windsor, was\r\npresented by the King for the purpose. It had been sculptured by a\r\nFlorentine named Bernardo da Rovezzano, for Cardinal Wolsey, and\r\nremained in the chapel. The wooden coffin, made of the mast of\r\n_L’Orient_, blown up at the battle of the Nile, which had been presented\r\nto Nelson by his friend Hallowell, of the _Swiftsure_, was too large to\r\ngo into the marble sarcophagus, which is still empty. It stands on a\r\nfine base of black and white marble, and Nelson’s body is in the masonry\r\nbelow. Beside Nelson sleep Collingwood (d. 1810), the second, and\r\nNorthesk (d. 1831), the third in command at Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Nelson’s tomb is preserved the funeral car or hearse made\r\nfor the burial of the Duke of Wellington—a monumental work in itself. It\r\nwas cast from cannon taken in the Duke’s victories, from designs by\r\nRedgrave, and is so fine as to have led many critics to attribute it to\r\nStevens—wrongly, however, as Redgrave’s drawings are still extant.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the tombs here to be seen and the names of great men on\r\nevery side, this crypt is well worth a visit. We observe in it, the care\r\nand attention to details which Wren bestowed upon every part of his\r\ngreat design. He altered the axis of the new church, the east end of\r\nwhich is slightly to the northward of that of old St. Paul’s. By this\r\nmeans he obtained fresh ground for the more important parts of his\r\nfoundations. The great piers which support the dome do not stand where\r\nthose which supported the old central tower stood. At one place, said to\r\nbe near the north-east corner, he found that a gravel pit had been made\r\nand “the hard pot earth,” on which he depended, had been removed. He\r\nsunk a pit to where, at the very foot of the hill on which St. Paul’s\r\nstands, he found a firm foundation, and laid upon it a mass of masonry,\r\n10 feet square, on which he could rely. It was not his intention to\r\ninterrupt the view of the central aisle by placing the organ over the\r\nentrance to the choir, but, in the crypt, we see that when he had to\r\ncomply with the taste of the time, he built “a row of columns and arches\r\nto strengthen the floor for the extra weight it was called upon to\r\ncarry.”\r\n\r\nThe modest _Guide_, by Mr. Gilbertson, which is to be had at the ticket\r\noffice at the foot of the stairs to the dome, contains by far the best\r\naccount of the church. It is supplemented by a description of the\r\nmosaics, mentioned above. For a magnificent series of views a volume by\r\nthe late Mr. Birch on the _City Churches_ may be named. There is no\r\nmodern history of the cathedral which can be recommended to the student\r\nas, so far, the great collection of records preserved in the library has\r\nnot been used by historians. Milman and Longman do not seem to have been\r\naware of its existence. The late Dr. Sparrow Simpson, whose delightful\r\nbut desultory volumes have already been mentioned, made many extracts\r\nfrom these manuscripts, but his example has hardly been followed.\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts were well catalogued in 1883, by Sir H. Maxwell Lyte,\r\nfor the Historical Manuscripts Commission.\r\n\r\n  =St. Faith= was situated under the choir of old St. Paul’s. In 1549,\r\n  Jesus Chapel in the cathedral being suppressed by Edward VI., the\r\n  parishioners of St. Faith’s were allowed to remove from their crypt\r\n  to this chapel. It continued so till St. Paul’s was burnt down, when\r\n  the parish was annexed to St. Augustine’s by Act of Parliament\r\n  (1670). The earliest date of an incumbent is 1277.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of this church has always been in the hands of: The\r\n  Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s—as far back as 1148; and in 1277\r\n  Robert le Seneschal was rector.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 400.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of monuments are recorded by Stow, but none\r\n  are of much note. The most interesting is that of Katherine, third\r\n  daughter of Edward, Lord Neville.\r\n\r\n  There was a table in the south aisle of the church with the names of\r\n  the benefactors, amongst whom were: John Sanderson, donor of £150,\r\n  and Elizabeth Underwood, donor of £70.\r\n\r\n  Richard Layton (d. 1544), Dean of York, was rector here.\r\n\r\n  =St. Gregory by St. Paul’s= was situated on the south side of St.\r\n  Paul’s, near the west end, in the ward of Castle Baynard. The date\r\n  of its foundation is not known, but it is said that the body of\r\n  Edmund, King of the East Angles, who was put to death by the Danes\r\n  in 870, rested here for three years. It was burnt down by the Great\r\n  Fire and not rebuilt, its parish being annexed to that of St. Mary\r\n  Magdalene, Old Fish Street. The earliest date of an incumbent is\r\n  1181.\r\n\r\n  It was a Rectory in the gift of the Prebendary of St. Pancras and\r\n  formed part of the manor of that prebendary. It was appropriated in\r\n  1445 to the minor canons of St. Paul’s, and so continued until the\r\n  church was annexed to St. Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street, in 1666.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 600.\r\n\r\n  A chantry was founded here by Robert Rosamonde, whose endowment\r\n  fetched £13 : 18s. in 1548, when Peter Jacksonne was priest, aged\r\n  thirty-nine years, “a teacher for children, and hath, for that he\r\n  was a religious person, a pension of £5 : 6 : 8 over and besides\r\n  this his stipend of £6 : 13 : 4.”\r\n\r\n  No monuments of any special note are recorded in this church by\r\n  Stow.\r\n\r\n  There was a school in this parish for thirty boys and twenty girls,\r\n  purchased at the expense of Alderman Barber; and one almshouse, upon\r\n  Lambeth Hill.\r\n\r\n  John Hewitt, tried by Cromwell’s High Court of Justice and beheaded\r\n  in 1658, was rector here, and was buried in this church.\r\n\r\nIn =St. Paul’s Churchyard= the chapter-house first attracts our\r\nattention, a square, plain, red-brick building, with a modern office for\r\nthe cathedral architect on one side; the top story was added in the last\r\ntwenty years of the nineteenth century. These additions are not so\r\nnoticeable as might be supposed, but are wonderfully harmonised by smoke\r\nand weather already. The building is finished with Portland stone, and\r\nthe two semicircular projecting pediments over the two front doorways\r\nare of the same material. In each of these there is a curious niche or\r\nrecess, which was evidently designed to receive a coat-of-arms, but no\r\ncoat-of-arms has ever been placed there. The age of the chapter-house is\r\nindefinite. Mr. Penrose, the cathedral architect, judges it to have been\r\nbuilt shortly after the year 1700. There is negative evidence to show\r\nthat it did not exist before that date, for in a design of Wren’s,\r\nshowing the limits of old St. Paul’s, the frontage of houses to the\r\nstreet is incompatible with the position of the chapter-house, and the\r\nbuildings are also marked as ordinary dwelling-houses. But this plan is\r\nnot altogether trustworthy, for it does not give the cathedral\r\nfoundations correctly, and may therefore be inaccurate in other\r\nparticulars. It is supposed, on account of this inaccuracy, to have been\r\none of the later plans, probably made about 1700, when the old\r\nfoundations had been built over and forgotten. It bears no date, and the\r\nevidence must be taken for what it is worth. Knight, in his _London_,\r\ngives a print dated 1701, and says that Wren repaired and restored the\r\nchapter-house after the Fire, which is obviously incorrect.\r\n\r\nWithin the chapter-house all is simple and solid. A square wainscotted\r\nhall, paved with plain white marble slabs, deep-set doors and windows in\r\nthe thickness of the walls, and a fine, wide, shallow-stepped staircase\r\nwith well-worked iron supports to the handrail. The character of the\r\nbalustrade changes above the first floor, and the handrail is supported\r\nby spiral wooden balusters. The walls of the finely proportioned\r\nchapter-room are all wainscotted, otherwise there is nothing to remark\r\nupon. This room is occasionally lent to ecclesiastical conferences. In\r\none of the other rooms are eight panels, 2 feet 6 by 1 foot 9 inches,\r\nenclosed in small gilt frames. These hang rather high up round the\r\nwalls. They are monotint, and are Sir James Thornhill’s original designs\r\nfor the frescoes in the dome of the cathedral. These designs are\r\nexcellently clear, and show what the now faded frescoes must have been.\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon of the cathedral has a suite of rooms in the\r\nchapter-house, and the remainder of the house is carried out in the same\r\nplain domestic style.\r\n\r\nThe north side of the churchyard consists of a row of dingy brick\r\nbuildings of various heights and ages. One or two are showing signs of\r\ndecrepid old age, others still flourishing, with the names of their\r\ntradesmen occupants in mighty gilt letters across their smoky fronts.\r\nThe irregular roofs of tiles or slates, with fantastic little iron\r\nrailings high up, or windows peeping over the parapets, are sufficiently\r\noriginal to be interesting. Every class of goods seems to find\r\nrepresentatives here—we see confectioners, milliners, bootmakers,\r\nphotographers, etc. The Religious Tract Society has one entrance in the\r\nchurchyard. On the east side we find all the houses modern, in the\r\nmodern style, with stone facings; they are chiefly occupied by\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nWe turn next to =Paternoster Row=.\r\n\r\nIn every large town on the Continent, wherever a cathedral has been\r\nerected, there are streets occupied by shops where all kinds of\r\necclesiastical things are made and sold, such as beads, crucifixes, wax\r\ntapers, service books, meditations, and such like. Paternoster Row\r\nserved this purpose for St. Paul’s in the first instance, and, as there\r\nis only one other street so called, namely, the lane of Paternoster in\r\nthe Riole, one may reasonably conclude that, with this other street, it\r\nsupplied all the churches and all the faithful of the City with these\r\nthings. We read of “Paternoster” meaning rosaries, and of a\r\n“Paternostrer” or one whose trade it was to make rosaries, etc. There\r\nare frequent references to both Paternoster “Street” of St. Michael le\r\nQuerne, and Paternoster Lane, or Paternoster Church Lane of St. Michael,\r\nPaternoster Royal. Of the first, for instance, there are houses and\r\nrents spoken of in wills of 1312 and 1321.\r\n\r\nThis is, in fact, one of the most ancient, as well as one of the most\r\ninteresting of the City Streets.\r\n\r\nWe can catch glimpses here and there of the actual residents of this\r\nstreet, the place where they made the rosaries. They should have been a\r\nquiet and God-fearing folk; but they were not. In 1381 one Godfrey de\r\nBelstred was assaulted by three “Paternostrers” of this parish, whether\r\nfor purposes of robbery or in a quarrel does not appear; he was picked\r\nup wounded, and carried off to die. In the same century we find persons\r\nowning houses in this street; one, William de Ravenstone, Almoner of St.\r\nPaul’s, leaves by will a house in Paternoster Row. Did his functions\r\npermit him to live outside the precinct which sheltered such a goodly\r\ncompany of ecclesiastics? About the same time William Russell—surely the\r\nearliest mention of that illustrious name—bequeaths his house in the\r\nRow; Garter King-at-arms has a house there; John de Pykenham,\r\nPaternostrer, leaves various tenements to his wife, who claims as one of\r\nthem a house in the Row. William le Marbler, a vintner, has a house\r\nthere; the name shows that a man might by this time leave the trade of\r\nhis father, and take to another without changing his surname, just as\r\nthe name of Chaucer, who never belonged to the “gentle craft,” means\r\nshoemaker. There are other instances of “Paternostrers,” all of whom\r\nbelong to the Parish, if not to the Row, which formed the most important\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PATERNOSTER ROW (AS IT WAS)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe street, in fact, belonged to two parishes; one of these was the\r\nparish of St. Faith under Paul’s (see p. 340). St. Faith’s parish\r\nincludes Paternoster Square, the Row, and Ivy Lane, with little fringes\r\nor strips, on the north and south. The east end of the Row is in the\r\nparish of St. Michael le Querne (see p. 326). This little parish, whose\r\nchurch is now St. Vedast’s, Foster Lane, included no more than 250 feet\r\nof the Row, with that part of Chepe west of Foster Lane, and the\r\nbuildings on the north-west of the cathedral precinct. If you stand now\r\non the site of the church, you will find it difficult to understand how\r\nthere could be room for a parish church and a graveyard on the little\r\nspace between the Row and the west end of Cheapside. By measurement,\r\nhowever, you will ascertain that a line drawn from the shop at the end\r\nof the Row to the corner of Cheapside is 130 feet in length, while a\r\nline drawn perpendicular to the buildings is 110 feet. Now the mediæval\r\nbuilders were ingenious in cramming churches and halls into small areas.\r\nI have laid down the church as it might have been, and I put the present\r\nstatue of Peel at the crossing of the transepts if it was a cruciform\r\nchurch. I do not think, however, that it was cruciform, but that it\r\nconsisted of a nave and chancel only, with a small burial-ground on the\r\nnorth, and a tower on the east side. The Fire of 1666 left it rootless,\r\nbroke its windows, melted its glass, calcined its marbles, and destroyed\r\nits woodwork. It also burned up the coffins with their contents in the\r\nvaults. The parish was poor and small; the “Paternostrers” existed no\r\nlonger; the parishioners decided not to rebuild the church; they\r\namalgamated their parish with another; they widened the way that led\r\nfrom Newgate Street into Cheapside; and the bones of the dead, which\r\nwere now so much grey powder, were trampled in the mud and dust of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Reformation came, the trade of the street was annihilated.\r\nFortunately for the poor “Paternostrers” the work of destruction was not\r\nsudden; it took time for the old services and the old ceremonies, which\r\nrequired their handiwork, to be abolished. What they did when the\r\naccession of the Protestant party to power closed their shops; how they\r\ngot rid of their unsold stock, their piles of rosaries, beads,\r\ncrucifixes, candlesticks; what new trades they learned; what\r\nbankruptcies and disasters fell upon them, no one knows. There is no\r\nchronicle to tell of the immediate effects of the Reformation on the\r\ntrade and the common life of the City. It is, however, certain that the\r\nPaternostrers had to try something else.\r\n\r\nThey vanish; the historian hears no more of them; they rejoiced, we may\r\nbe very sure, when Queen Mary brought back the ancient things; they\r\ntrembled when Queen Elizabeth showed herself as independent and as\r\nmasterful as her father.\r\n\r\nBut the place is central; it is a quiet and convenient place, retired\r\nfrom the noisy market; it is essentially a street for business of a\r\nquiet kind. Therefore the people who had formerly occupied the stalls of\r\nBroken Cross, the Standard, and the Great Cross, changed their quarters\r\nand took the small shops of the Paternostrers, where they sold paper,\r\nparchment, ink, pens, and the like—being the forerunners of the\r\nbooksellers.\r\n\r\nBut the day of the booksellers was not yet. Paternoster Row was too\r\nlarge for the stationers; the mercers, silkmen, and lacemen found out\r\nthe place and began to crowd out the stationers. It became the principal\r\nplace for the sale of these fashionable goods; in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries all the great ladies went to Paternoster Row for\r\ntheir fineries; latterly the lane was thronged with carriages.\r\n\r\nThen came the Fire.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire, according to Strype, the mercers migrated to Covent\r\nGarden, Henrietta Street, and King Street. According to Defoe, the Row\r\nwas rebuilt after the Fire, for the convenience of these trades; “the\r\nspacious shops, back warehouses, skylights, and other conveniences made\r\non purpose for their trade are still to be seen.” He goes on to say that\r\nthe other traders were then dependent on the more important shops:\r\nlacemen were in Ivy Lane, button shops at the Cheapside end, shops for\r\ncrewels and fringe in Blowbladder Street. He says that this continued\r\nfor twenty years after the Fire, and that the mercers began then to\r\nmigrate to Covent Garden, where, however, they did not remain many\r\nyears. They then returned to the City and established themselves on\r\nLudgate Hill.\r\n\r\nBut all the mercers and silkmen did not desert the Row. In 1720 there\r\nwere still some “with many tirewomen.” It is at this period that we\r\nfirst hear of booksellers in the Row. Their previous quarters, before\r\nthe Fire, had been St. Paul’s Churchyard not far off. After the Fire,\r\nsome of them went to the upper end of Paternoster Row, where there were\r\nbuilt “large warehouses for booksellers well situated for learned and\r\nstudious men’s access thither, being more retired and private” (Strype).\r\nOthers retreated, their stocks destroyed by the Fire, in an impoverished\r\ncondition, to the cheaper street of Little Britain, where they continued\r\nfor eighty years, when they began to flock into Paternoster Row.\r\n\r\n“From the manufacture of paternosters to the publication and sale of\r\nbooks is a long step. The Row, however, gradually lost all its mercers,\r\nlacemen, and silkmen, and became the home of books, old and new. Other\r\nbooksellers there were in other parts, but not many—Dodsley, for\r\ninstance, in Pall Mall, Murray in Fleet Street, Newbery in St. Paul’s;\r\nbut the greater number had their shops, being booksellers as well as\r\npublishers, in the Row. No longer did the coaches rumble along the\r\nnarrow street; posts placed across forbade the passage of coach or cart;\r\nit became the most quiet street in all London. Gradually another change\r\nfell upon the place: the booksellers’ shops disappeared, and with them\r\nthe throng of scholars who had been wont to meet and talk among the\r\nbooks. The Row became a wholesale place, whither the ‘trade’ came to\r\nbuy; printers, bookbinders, and papermakers came for orders; and needy\r\nauthors came, hat in hand, in the hope of picking up a guinea.\r\n\r\n“There is a book called _Travels in Town_, written in the year 1839. The\r\nauthor, speaking of the output of books, boldly states that they had all\r\nto pass through Paternoster Row—certainly an exaggeration, but by far\r\nthe greater number had to do so. The busiest day in the month was\r\nMagazine day, when the new magazines were sold to the trade. About\r\n400,000 copies left the Row that morning. When we consider the nature of\r\nthese magazines—the _Gentleman_, _Tait’s_, the _New Monthly_, the\r\n_Metropolitan_, _Blackwood’s_, _Fraser’s_—there can be no doubt that\r\namong the better class of readers the magazine occupied a much more\r\nimportant place then than it does at present.\r\n\r\n“The Row kept up its character as the headquarters of the book trade for\r\nmany years. But other changes have set in. There now are as many\r\npublishers outside the Row as in it. We find publishers about Covent\r\nGarden and Charing Cross; booksellers there are, of course, everywhere.\r\nThe _Directory_ gives a list of over four hundred publishers, of whom\r\nnot more than forty or fifty need be taken into account. Of the four\r\nhundred, however, the Row still numbers thirty; while of booksellers,\r\nstationers, and other persons connected with the book trade, there are\r\nanother thirty in the Row. So the old literary atmosphere hangs about\r\nthe place, and, though most of the greater publishers are gone, there\r\nare enough left to keep up the traditions of the past. And north of the\r\nRow, in Paternoster Square and the courts and lanes, other publishers\r\nand booksellers are found who lend their name to make the Row and its\r\nvicinity still the headquarters of new books.\r\n\r\n“As for the social side of the Row. It once boasted two places of resort\r\nwhere men could meet and dine, or sit and talk. The first of them was\r\nDolly’s Chop House. This house was built in the time of Queen Anne for a\r\ncertain cook named Dolly. It is said to have stood on the site of an\r\nordinary kept by Tarleton the Elizabethan mime. If this is true, there\r\nwas probably, according to the conservative habits of our people, a\r\ntavern kept up on the spot continuously. It was not the custom, in the\r\nearly years of the eighteenth century, to create a new tavern, but to\r\ncarry on an old one. However, Dolly’s remained a place of great resort\r\nfor more than a hundred years. It seems to have been famous for its\r\nbeefsteaks.\r\n\r\n“The other, a more important place, was the Chapter Coffee House. This\r\nplace was in the eighteenth century the resort of the booksellers; here\r\nthey met for the sale, among themselves, of copyrights, and for the\r\nsharing of any new enterprise in new books. Here also met many of the\r\nwits and writers during the last half of that century—Goldsmith,\r\nJohnson, Lloyd, Churchill, and many others came here to sup and to talk.\r\nChatterton found his way here, sitting in a corner and thinking himself\r\nalready admitted among the acknowledged poets of the day. In the early\r\npart of this century the coffee house was frequented by a knot of\r\nwriters of some importance in their own day. There was Alexander\r\nStevens, Dr. Buchan, the Rev. W. Murray, the Rev. Dr. Berdmore, Walker\r\n‘the rhetorician,’ Dr. Towers, Dr. Fordyce, Johnson, called in his day\r\n‘king of the booksellers,’ Phillips, editor of the _Monthly Magazine_,\r\nAlexander Chalmers, Macfarlane, and others whose names are well-nigh\r\nforgotten, who yet thought themselves no mean citizens, and formed a\r\ngroup which came here every night and talked. Sad it is to think that to\r\nthese circles, as well as to that of the Chapter Coffee House, Time will\r\napply the sponge and efface their names and their sayings from the\r\nmemory of the world.” (_Paper on Paternoster Row._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PATERNOSTER ROW AS IT IS\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Ave Maria Lane= was “so called” (Stow) “because of stationers and text\r\nwriters who wrote and sold there all sorts of books then in use, namely,\r\nA.B.C. with the Pater Noster, Ave, Creed, the Graces, etc.”\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Ave Maria Lane was the “Vicarage” of the Vicars\r\nChoral of St. Paul’s, “bounded on the east by the Penitentiarie’s house;\r\non the west by Ave Maria Lane; on the south by the highway leading\r\nthrough St. Paul’s churchyard; and on the north by the Bishop’s Palace.”\r\n\r\nThe Garden of the Bishop of London’s Palace on the west was divided from\r\nAve Maria Lane by a great brick wall reaching to an old house in\r\nPaternoster Row, the Three White Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Bishop’s Palace was in London House Yard. The Palace was\r\npulled down in 1650 and tenements built upon its site.\r\n\r\nHere has been demolished the old tavern, No. 8, distinguished by its\r\nsign of the Goose and the Gridiron. The tavern stood, perhaps, on the\r\nsite of the Mitre, where, in 1642-44, was exhibited a collection of\r\ncuriosities which, according to their Catalogue, must have consisted\r\nmainly of rarities similar in kind to those of “Tradeskins Ark” at\r\nLambeth, or of the Royal Society when lodged at Gresham College. The\r\nCatalogue says they are “daily to be seen at the place called the Music\r\nHouse at the Mitre near the west end of St. Paul’s Church.” The sign may\r\nhave been designed in burlesque of that of the Swan and Harp in\r\nCheapside, as cited in _Little London Directory_ of 1677. It formed the\r\nmeeting-place of the St. Paul’s Masonic Lodge, to which Wren belonged\r\nfor many years. He presented to the sodality of the Lodge, the mallet\r\nand trowel that had been used in laying the first stone of St. Paul’s\r\n(_Midd. and Herts. Notes and Queries_, vol. ii. p. 179).\r\n\r\n=Amen Corner= is chiefly modern, but the two brick houses next the gate\r\nwhich shuts in Amen Court are both ancient, one of them being restored.\r\nThrough great claret-painted wooden gates we pass to Amen Court where\r\nthere is an unbroken line of old seventeenth-century houses facing the\r\nback of Stationers’ Hall. These are all of brick, creeper-covered, with\r\niron lamp-holders arching over the doorways, and link sockets attached.\r\nOne or two have quaint old iron scrapers. They were built by Sir C.\r\nWren. The court is the ecclesiastical residence for many of the\r\ndignitaries connected with St. Paul’s. A gravelled walk leads round the\r\ncorner by a buttressed wall to the more modern part. Quite a large\r\ngarden space lies before the houses. The later row, built in 1876, are\r\nin a modern Queen Anne style, and the material used is glowing red\r\nbrick.\r\n\r\nThe lodge or entrance to this side from the lane stands back behind\r\npicturesque iron gates with red brick piers surmounted by great urns.\r\nOver the foot entry is a Latin inscription, and in the street on a stone\r\nslab set in the brickwork under a projecting cornice are the words:\r\n\r\n Pro omnibus mortus christus ut et qui vivunt jam non sibi vivant sed ei\r\n    qui pro ipsis mortuus est et resurrexit.\r\n\r\nIn Ave Maria Lane are the ordinary business houses.\r\n\r\nAmen Corner formerly ran from Ave Maria Lane as far as the wall. The\r\npresent court has been constructed on part of the ground formerly\r\noccupied by the Oxford Arms Inn. Stationers’ Hall (see p. 199) was also\r\nbuilt against the wall; its small garden is the old burial-ground of St.\r\nMartin, Ludgate Hill.\r\n\r\nSt. Martin’s Lane had St. Martin-le-Grand on the east side. This was a\r\nhouse for Augustine canons, and William of Wykeham was one of its deans.\r\nIt formed a precinct with its own liberty, which survived the\r\nDissolution. In the sanctuary Forrest, the murderer of the little\r\nprinces in the Tower, died (see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 234).\r\nStow tells the story of the famous action in which the City challenged\r\nthe claims of sanctuary set up by St. Martin’s in the year 1442.\r\n\r\n“This college claimed great privileges of sanctuary and otherwise, as\r\nappeareth in a book, written by a notary of that house, about the year\r\n1442, 19 Henry VI., wherein, amongst other things, is set down and\r\ndeclared, that on the 1st of September, in the year aforesaid, a\r\nsoldier, prisoner in Newgate, as he was led by an officer towards the\r\nGuildhall of London, there came out of Panyer Alley five of his\r\nfellowship, and took him from the officer, brought him into sanctuary at\r\nthe west door of St. Martin’s church, and took grithe of that place; but\r\nthe same day Philip Malpas and Robert Marshall, then sheriffs of London,\r\nwith many others, entered the said church, and forcibly took out with\r\nthem the said five men thither fled, led them fettered to the Compter,\r\nand from thence, chained by the necks, to Newgate; of which violent\r\ntaking the dean and chapter in large manner complained to the king, and\r\nrequired him, as their patron, to defend their privileges, like as his\r\npredecessors had done, etc. All which complaint and suit the citizens by\r\ntheir counsel, Markham, sergeant at the law, John Carpenter, late common\r\nclerk of the city, and other, learnedly answered, offering to prove that\r\nthe said place of St. Martin had no such immunity or liberty as was\r\npretended; namely, Carpenter offered to lose his livelihood, if that\r\nchurch had more immunity than the least church in London.\r\nNotwithstanding, after long debating of this controversy, by the king’s\r\ncommandment, and assent of his council in the starred chamber, the\r\nchancellor and treasurer sent a writ unto the sheriffs of London,\r\ncharging them to bring the said five persons with the cause of their\r\ntaking and withholding afore the king in his Chancery, on the vigil of\r\nAllhallows. On which day the said sheriffs, with the recorder and\r\ncounsel of the City, brought and delivered them accordingly, afore the\r\nsaid lords; whereas the chancellor, after he had declared the king’s\r\ncommandment, sent them to St. Martin’s, there to abide freely, as in a\r\nplace having franchises, whiles them liked, etc.” (Stow). The whole of\r\nthe district is now being gradually covered by the mighty buildings of\r\nthe General Post Office, which has inherited the name of its\r\npredecessor, and is known as St. Martin-le-Grand. For the history see\r\n_London in the Nineteenth Century_, p. 307.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CITY BOUNDARY, ALDERSGATE\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Aldersgate=, formerly called Aldrechegate and Aldresgate, was built\r\nduring the Saxon occupation. It is named in the laws of Ethelred. It is\r\nalso mentioned in the _Calendar of Wills_, but not very early. Riley\r\ncontains some interesting notices of the gate and the ward.\r\n\r\nThus in 1277 an inquest is held on the unlucky Matilda, wife of Henry le\r\nCoffeur, who fell down, being drunk, broke her right arm, and soon after\r\ndied, and was laid in the house of the said Henry in the ward of Anketin\r\nde Auvergne, _i.e._ Aldersgate. In 1339 the Chamberlain of Guildhall\r\nexpended 20s. 4d. on the pavement of the gate of Aldersgate, the\r\npavement being one of cobbled stones laid close and rammed down. The\r\nfirst pavements were those laid down in much frequented places such as\r\nthe City gates and markets, where otherwise the feet of the passers-by\r\nwould make pools of mud. In 1346 a certain Simon is hanged for robbery\r\nin the ward of Aldersgate—observe that the name of the alderman is no\r\nlonger given to the ward. In 1350 mention is made of shops within\r\nAldersgate. In 1375, there are ordinances, already referred to,\r\nconcerning “foreign” poulterers. In 1379 there are ordinances respecting\r\nthe cattle-market of Smithfield without Aldersgate. In 1391 a scrivener\r\nstands in pillory without Aldersgate for forgery.\r\n\r\nAldersgate was not thrown open as a highway. Bishopsgate received the\r\ntraffic from the north; Aldgate from the east; Newgate from the west;\r\nand Bridge Gate from the south. Aldersgate simply opened upon the moor\r\nbeyond which was the great forest. It became necessary to have this gate\r\nfor access to Smithfield, when that place began to be used as a market\r\nfor horses and cattle; as the City playground, and as the site of races,\r\nwrestling matches, and archery practice. It was also, later, used as a\r\nplace of execution; and it was partly occupied by religious houses.\r\n\r\nStow’s derivation from the “Elder” or “Older” gate is too far-fetched.\r\nIt is named probably from one Ealdered, its earliest name being\r\n“Aldredesgate.” It is mentioned in a deed witnessed by Henry of London\r\nStone, Mayor of London. In 1274 John Blackthorn is alderman of this\r\nward, but in 1115 there is found in the documents of St. Paul’s a Warda\r\nBrickmarii Montlarii, Ward of Brickman, the Moneyer, which is probably\r\nAldersgate.\r\n\r\nStow says of it:\r\n\r\n“This is the fourth principal gate and hath at sundry times been\r\nincreased with buildings, namely, on the south, or inner side, a great\r\nframe of timber hath been added, and set up, containing divers large\r\nrooms and lodgings; also on the east side is the addition of one great\r\nbuilding of timber, with one large floor, paved with stone or tile, and\r\na well therein curbed with stone, of a great depth, and rising into the\r\nsaid room, two stories high from the ground; which well is the only\r\npeculiar note belonging to that gate, for I have not seen the like in\r\nall this City to be raised so high” (Stow).\r\n\r\n“The gate described by Stow was taken down in 1617, and rebuilt the same\r\nyear from a design by Gerard Christmas, the architect, as Vertue\r\nthought, of old Northumberland House. On the outer front was a figure in\r\nhigh relief of James I. on horseback, with the prophets Jeremiah and\r\nSamuel in niches on each side; on the inner or City front an effigy of\r\nthe King in his chair of state. King James, on his way to take\r\npossession of his new dominions, entered London by the old gate; the new\r\ngate referred to this circumstance, with suitable quotations from\r\nJeremiah and Samuel placed beneath the figures of the two prophets. The\r\nheads of several of the regicides were set on this gate, which suffered\r\nby the Great Fire, but was soon after repaired and ‘beautified.’ The\r\nwhole fabric was sold on the 22nd of April, 1761, and immediately taken\r\ndown. I may add that it is written Aldrichgate in the London Chronicle\r\nof Edward IV.’s time, printed by Sir Harris Nicholas; and that John Day,\r\nthe printer of Queen Elizabeth’s time, dwelt ‘over Aldersgate,’ much in\r\nthe same manner as Cave subsequently did at St. John’s” (Cunningham).\r\n\r\nMilton took a “pretty garden-house” in Aldersgate Street on his return\r\nfrom his foreign tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. BOTOLPH, ALDERSGATE\r\n\r\n  This church is opposite the General Post Office, at the corner of\r\n  Little Britain. The building was repaired in 1627, but was damaged\r\n  by the Great Fire. It was pulled down in 1754, when the present\r\n  church was erected. The earliest date of an incumbent is 1333.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Dean of St.\r\n  Martin-le-Grand, as a Rectory, 1333; the Dean and Canons of St.\r\n  Martin-le-Grand, as a Donative or Curacy, united to St. Martin’s\r\n  December 18, 1399; the Abbot and Convent of Westminster; the Dean\r\n  and Chapter of Westminster, who are still the patrons.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 1100.\r\n\r\n  The present church is divided into a nave and side aisles by\r\n  Corinthian columns, and contains galleries on the north, south, and\r\n  west sides respectively. The building is of brick. The tower rises\r\n  at the west, crowned by a turret. There is a façade of four Ionic\r\n  columns on the east side, constructed in 1831. The churchyard is of\r\n  considerable size and extends to the south and west of the church;\r\n  it is open to the public and is well laid out.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For Thomas de Lilsington and Lucy his\r\n  wife; by John Bothe. Here was the Brotherhood of Holy Trinity at\r\n  that altar in the south part of the which, and for which the King\r\n  granted a licence to Lady Johanna Asteley, Robert Cawode, and Thomas\r\n  Smythe, sen., July 9, 1446.\r\n\r\n  The oldest monument remaining is that of Dame Anne Packington, a\r\n  benefactress to the parish, who died in 1563. There are also\r\n  monuments to Sir John Micklethwait, President of the College of\r\n  Physicians, and Dr. Bernard, also a medical practitioner of the\r\n  seventeenth century; to Richard Chiswell, principal bookseller of\r\n  his time, who died in 1711; and to Daniel Wray, F.R.S., F.S.A., one\r\n  of the original Trustees of the British Museum and friend of the\r\n  poets Dyer and Akenside.\r\n\r\n  The charitable gifts belonging to this parish recorded by Stow are\r\n  very numerous. Richard Chiswell, bookseller, was the donor of £50 to\r\n  the schools at his death; Mrs. Hannah Jones of £60 in all during her\r\n  life and at her death.\r\n\r\n  Fifty boys and fifty girls were clothed and educated by\r\n  subscription.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard has been converted into a pleasant garden with smooth\r\ngrass plots and irregularly growing trees, and is locally known as the\r\nPostmen’s Park. In the _Daily Chronicle_ of April 16, 1896, a\r\ncondensation of a speech by Mr. Norman, senior, churchwarden of St.\r\nBotolph Without, appeared, part of which was as follows:\r\n\r\n“The land in question had been let by the Charity Commissioners for\r\nbuilding in spite of the protests of the parishioners. It was in digging\r\nfor foundations that an enormous quantity of human remains came to\r\nlight, and the workmen at last became disgusted and refused to remove\r\nany more the masses of bones disturbed. The building lessees, however,\r\ndetermined to go on and legal proceedings were taken. The result was a\r\ndeclaration by the judge that although about one half of the site was a\r\nportion of the churchyard, technically, the whole site had now been\r\ndealt with in such a way as to enable the central governing body to\r\nbuild upon it.\r\n\r\n“Many tons of human remains were still unexcavated, while a vast\r\nquantity piled pell-mell against the church tower—preparatory to the\r\nintended removal—had been covered with a few inches of earth. It seemed\r\nimpossible that the central governing body should now treat the ground\r\nas a building site, especially as one of their principal duties was the\r\npreservation of open spaces where they were most wanted, viz. in the\r\nheart of the City, besides which they had now vested in them the whole\r\nof the parish property of the value of about £100,000. He had every hope\r\nthat they would see their way to foregoing the small profit derivable\r\nfrom letting the site for building purposes, and he believed there was\r\nnow a probability of the ground being secured for the public, in which\r\nevent the churchyard garden would not only be preserved, but enlarged\r\nand greatly improved.”\r\n\r\nOn the west side of St. Martin’s Lane, Aldersgate, near Blowbladder\r\nStreet stood a great house called Northumberland House, which at one\r\ntime belonged to the Percies. Henry IV. gave it to the Queen and it was\r\ncalled her wardrobe; in Stow’s time it was a printing house.\r\n\r\nIn Bull and Mouth Street stood the Bull and Mouth Inn. It became one of\r\nthe famous coaching inns of London.\r\n\r\nThe principal towns served from the Bull and Mouth were: Holyhead,\r\nOxford, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Kidderminster, Worcester, Leominster,\r\nLudlow, Hereford, Kendal, Glasgow, Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield,\r\nNottingham, and Northampton. Coaches started from these places daily,\r\nthree times, or twice a week. The traffic appears strangely divided;\r\nthis, however, was due to the competition of other coaches. Thus, a\r\ncoach started twice a day for Birmingham, and also twice a day for\r\nKendal.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one coaches ran out of the Bull and Mouth every Monday. The same\r\nnumber came in. Other days were quite as busy. Besides, there were the\r\nwagons, of which twelve went out every week. The offices of the Post\r\nOffice are now built over the site of this inn.\r\n\r\nFarther north to the west of Aldersgate is the district ravaged by the\r\nfire of 1897, which burned down blocks of houses and streets. Jewin\r\nCrescent and Australian Avenue were the centre of the conflagration, but\r\nboth have risen from their ashes. In Jewin Street Milton lived before\r\nhis third marriage.\r\n\r\n=Little Britain= was in the reigns of the Stuarts the centre of the\r\nbookselling trade, as Paternoster Row was later. Here lived Richard\r\nChiswell (d. 1711), “the Metropolitan bookseller”; also Samuel Buckler,\r\npublisher of the _Spectator_; and Benjamin Franklin lodged for a time in\r\n“Little Britain.” But the association which confers the greatest\r\ndistinction upon the street is that it was for a short time the\r\nresidence of Milton when he lodged with the bookseller Millington about\r\n1670.\r\n\r\nThe street at present is lined on one side by the uniform row of the\r\nbuildings in the hospital precincts; these are of dingy brick with\r\nstuccoed ground-floor. On the east, there are a few modern buildings\r\nmingled with one or two older ones, which give the street a quaint\r\naspect. No. 37 and the two numbers to the south of it are decidedly\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nA full account of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and Priory has been given\r\nin _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 251.\r\n\r\nThe Priory on its suppression was granted to Sir Richard, afterwards 1st\r\nBaron, Rich, with the exception of the choir and south transept of the\r\nchurch, which were given to the parishioners, and it is this beautiful\r\nfragment that now forms the church of St. Bartholomew the Great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. BARTHOLOMEW THE GREAT\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. BARTHOLOMEW THE GREAT\r\n\r\n  The date of the first prior, Rahere, was 1123, that of the first\r\n  rector 1544.\r\n\r\n  When the Priory was suppressed, the patronage was given by Henry\r\n  VIII. to Sir Richard Rich, who granted it to Queen Mary. It was\r\n  inherited by Queen Elizabeth, who regranted it to Sir Richard (then\r\n  Lord) Rich, in whose family it remained until it was purchased by\r\n  William Phillips early in the nineteenth century, in whose\r\n  descendants it now remains.\r\n\r\n  From West Smithfield, the entrance to the church is through an Early\r\n  English arch with the dogtooth ornament. The length of the church is\r\n  over 130 feet, the breadth 57 feet; the Lady Chapel, built early in\r\n  the fourteenth century, is about 60 feet long by 26 feet wide. The\r\n  style of the building is mainly Norman, and was executed by Rahere\r\n  (1123-1144) and his successor Thomas of St. Osyth (1144-1174);\r\n  during the next half-century the Early English nave was added. The\r\n  clerestory, in the Perpendicular style (1405), is in marked contrast\r\n  with the Norman Triforium beneath it: the ambulatory passes behind\r\n  the altar. The most striking innovation early in the fifteenth\r\n  century was the pulling down of the Norman apse and the erection of\r\n  an east wall, rendering the eastern portion of the church square\r\n  instead of semicircular; a new apse was built, however, by Aston\r\n  Webb, to whom also is due the flat oak ceiling of the tower, erected\r\n  in 1886, and the north transept, and the north and west porches, in\r\n  1893. A bone crypt is situated beneath the eastern part of the Lady\r\n  Chapel, and was vaulted by arches of a single span of 22 feet; it\r\n  was restored in 1895. Three bays of the east walk of the cloister\r\n  exist, and were restored in 1905. The tower, built in 1628, contains\r\n  five of the oldest bells in London, dating from before 1510.\r\n\r\n  Many chantries were founded here, but went with the suppression in\r\n  1539.\r\n\r\n  This church contains a number of interesting monuments. The most\r\n  notable is that of the founder, Rahere, placed on the north side of\r\n  the church within the communion rails. In the south aisle there is\r\n  the tomb of Sir Walter Mildmay (d. 1589), one of Queen Elizabeth’s\r\n  ablest statesmen, and founder of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. On the\r\n  south wall there is a monument to Edward Cooke, a physician of\r\n  repute who died in 1652; this is composed of a soft kind of marble,\r\n  known as “weeping marble,” because in a damp atmosphere it breaks\r\n  out into moisture. The renovation of the church has caused it to\r\n  weep no more. Thomas Roycroft, the printer of the Polyglot Bible (d.\r\n  1677), has a memorial by the Lady Chapel screen, erected by his son\r\n  Samuel. On the north wall of the choir a tablet records the death of\r\n  John Whiting, who, on his death in 1704, left the parish a sum of\r\n  money for educational purposes, which is still applied in accordance\r\n  with his wishes. Sir John Deane, the first rector here and founder\r\n  of the Witton Grammar School, Northwich, in 1557, is commemorated by\r\n  a brass opposite the founder’s tomb. The font in the south transept\r\n  is that in which the painter Hogarth was baptized in 1697; he was\r\n  created a life-governor of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in\r\n  acknowledgment of his gift of staircase paintings when the Hospital\r\n  was rebuilt.\r\n\r\n  There were many charities attached to this parish after Stow’s time\r\n  (1605), but they were all swept away under Bryce’s Act except John\r\n  Whiting’s schools.\r\n\r\n  Thirty boys and twenty girls were maintained by subscription and\r\n  John Whiting’s gift.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the most notable rector was Thomas Westfield (1605-1644),\r\n  Bishop of Bristol.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. BARTHOLOMEW THE LESS\r\n\r\n  This church served as the Hospital chapel in monastic times, and has\r\n  been used as a parish church for those within the Hospital precincts\r\n  since the dissolution of the priory. In 1789 the interior of the\r\n  tower was remodelled by the younger Dance, but in 1823 the church\r\n  was practically rebuilt by Thomas Hardwick. It has since been\r\n  restored, and the only trace of the old work is to be found in the\r\n  vestibule beneath the tower. The date of the first custodian was\r\n  1223. The date of the first vicar was 1532.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Priors of St.\r\n  Bartholomew, Smithfield, up to 1532; the Governors of St.\r\n  Bartholomew’s Hospital.\r\n\r\n  The interior was remodelled on an octagonal plan by Dance in 1789;\r\n  this shape is obtained by means of clustered columns and arches\r\n  although the area enclosed by the walls is almost square. Above the\r\n  arches there is a clerestory pierced by windows. The ceiling is\r\n  groined.\r\n\r\n  No chantries are recorded to have been founded here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n   _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  GENERAL POST OFFICE\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The old church contained a large number of monuments and a few have\r\n  been preserved. The most ancient is one in memory of William\r\n  Markeley, who died in 1439. There is a tablet erected by Sir Thomas\r\n  Bodley, founder of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, to his wife Anne.\r\n  Sir Ralph Winwood, James I.’s ambassador to Holland and Secretary of\r\n  State, was buried here; also James Heath, author. In 1573 Inigo\r\n  Jones was baptized in this church. His father was a clothworker\r\n  living in or near Cloth Fair.\r\n\r\n  No charitable gifts or bequests are recorded by Stow.\r\n\r\n=Bartholomew Close= is a curious place with many ramifications.\r\nBeginning at the south end, in the bit adjoining Westmoreland Buildings,\r\nthere is nothing of especial interest. The old house at the end facing\r\nwestward is used for offices, the remainder containing printing,\r\npublishing, and manufacturing premises. The great wide space,\r\nBartholomew Close proper, has been to a very great extent rebuilt. On\r\nthe east there are plain substantial business houses. At the corner of\r\nthe entrance from Little Britain there is a large eighteenth-century\r\nhouse in excellent repair. This has a line of no less than nine windows\r\nacross its breadth and is four stories in height. It has evidently been\r\nat one time a single dwelling-house. It is now cut up into three\r\nnumbers, and contains many offices. On the north side of the Close there\r\nis a row of houses of the Georgian period which occupy the site of the\r\nFrater of the Monastery. These stand back a little from the line of the\r\nstreet. One has a small garden, and the others covered entries or\r\none-storied offices before them.\r\n\r\nThe next arm of the Close, running up to the passage to the church,\r\ncontains also a long line of old houses on the west. Many of these have\r\nsmall shops on the ground-floor; some possess the slightly bowed windows\r\nin fashion at the time they were built.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BUTCHERS COMPANY\r\n\r\n  As early as the year 1180 the fraternity or guild of Butchers of the\r\n  City, then and long after called “bochers,” was in existence.\r\n\r\n  This Company was incorporated in the year 1606, having existed\r\n  without a charter from time immemorial. I venture to advance the\r\n  theory that one reason why the Butchers did not seek corporation\r\n  before this date was the authority which the City claimed and\r\n  exercised in all matters connected with food, and especially with\r\n  meat, fish, and bread; and that which every alderman exercised in\r\n  his own ward. Thus it was the duty of the alderman to be notified as\r\n  to the names of every person in the ward exercising any trade\r\n  connected with food; and the mayor’s regulations as to the trade of\r\n  butcher (see _Liber Albus, passim_) seem to leave little need for\r\n  the scrutiny of a Master.\r\n\r\n  The principal seat of the butchers was in Newgate Street, then\r\n  called St. Nicholas Shambles. The spot was chosen as a place near\r\n  the principal communications of the City with the north and west\r\n  respectively. Animals brought in to be slaughtered had not far to go\r\n  within the City. Moreover, it was not a crowded part of London, and\r\n  was removed from the principal place of trade and from the port. The\r\n  butchers had also a market at the “Stocks,” and another at East\r\n  Chepe. There was, however, a very great dislike to living near the\r\n  Shambles or to keeping shops and stalls near those of the butchers.\r\n\r\n  Thus Riley (_Memorials_) quotes a complaint against the butchers\r\n  that they carried their offal through the streets to a jetty called\r\n  Butchers’ Bridge. The way, I suppose, was down Warwick Lane, Creed\r\n  Lane, and St. Andrew’s Hill to Puddle Dock or near it. The carriage\r\n  of this stuff, often stinking and always dripping blood along the\r\n  street, caused great complaints. Thus orders were issued one after\r\n  the other in 1368, 1369, and 1371, commanding the butchers to find a\r\n  place outside the City for a slaughter-house. The law was never\r\n  obeyed: probably the butchers made some kind of compromise or were\r\n  more careful in the carriage of the offal. They had already a place\r\n  on the banks of the Fleet to which they were allowed to cart their\r\n  refuse, on condition that it was thrown in at the turn of the tide.\r\n\r\n  The livery of the Company is 159; their trust and charitable Income\r\n  amounts to £831 a year.\r\n\r\n  Daniel Defoe, son of James Foe, citizen and butcher, was a member of\r\n  this Company by patrimony; admitted January 12, 1687.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLOTH FAIR\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of =Cloth Fair= from the Smithfield end is full of\r\ninterest and attraction. It abounds in very old houses with projecting\r\nstories and gable ends. Many of these have the bowed curve of old age\r\nresembling the curving back of an old man. In others door-lintels and\r\nwindow-frames have slipped out of their horizontal lines. Barley Mow\r\nPassage is dull; it contains only plain warehouse-like buildings. In\r\nCloth Fair, Nos. 6 to 4 are covered with rough stucco and have bayed\r\nwindows and gable ends. These are the fronts of those seen over the\r\nchurchyard. In New Court are buildings of a similar nature. There are\r\ninterspersed with these quaint remnants of old domestic architecture\r\nbusiness houses of no particular style. No. 13 on the north side, and\r\nthe next one or two following it, are really old, and then we come to\r\nthe corner of Kinghorn Street, where one of the oldest taverns remaining\r\nin London stands. This is the Dick Whittington. The corner is rounded\r\noff, and each story projects a little farther than the lower one. There\r\nis an ornamental cornice and gable end; the whole is covered with rough\r\nstucco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OLD COACH AND HORSES, CLOTH FAIR\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Smithfield.=—Stow says: “Then is Smithfield Pond, which of old times in\r\nrecordes was called Horse Poole, for that men watered horses there, and\r\nwas a great water. In the 6th of Henry the fifth a new building was made\r\nin this west part of Smithfielde betwixt the said Pool and the River of\r\nthe Wels or Turnemill Brooke in a place (then called the Elmes, for that\r\nthere grew many Elme trees), and this had been the place of execution\r\nfor offenders, since the which time the building there hath been so\r\nincreased that now remaineth not one tree growing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LONG LANE, SMITHFIELD, 1810\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Elms here mentioned was the place of public execution until the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century; an honour transferred to St.\r\nGiles-in-the-Fields, and later to the more notorious Tyburn. Among the\r\nbest known of those who suffered execution at Smithfield is William\r\nWallace. Jack Straw, the rebel, was hanged at Smithfield, and here took\r\nplace the picturesque scene, when the beautiful boy-king, Richard II.,\r\nmet Wat Tyler, and showed courage such as won admiration for the promise\r\nof his future, a promise destined to remain unfulfilled. Then and later\r\nSmithfield was the great jousting field and playground of London. Many\r\nwere the brilliant tourneys held here, when knights met in chivalrous\r\ncontest, and all the flower of England’s manhood drew together to try\r\nprowess at arms.\r\n\r\nSmithfield, however, will be always best remembered by the blood of the\r\nmartyrs which watered the ground. The spot where these cruelties took\r\nplace is probably somewhere near the gate of St. Bartholomew’s. Between\r\n1555 and 1611, many were the sufferings endured at Smithfield. Timbs\r\nsays that of the 277 martyrs in Mary’s reign the greater number suffered\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BARTHOLOMEW FAIR, 1721\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Henry VIII.’s reign poisoners were boiled to death at Smithfield. A\r\nplace more closely associated with the life of London than this could\r\nhardly be imagined, yet nowadays who associates Smithfield with anything\r\nbut markets!\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the open space is an inclined plane winding downward\r\nwith a corkscrew turn until it passes into the basement of the Meat\r\nMarket. Northward is the huge building erected by Act of Parliament in\r\n1860, the year preceding the dismarketing of Newgate, which was closed\r\nat its opening seven years later. Sir Horace Jones was the architect,\r\nand the style is that generally known as Italian. The chief points of\r\narchitectural effect are the four towers, the frontispieces or façades\r\nof the public roadway, which passes through the market from north to\r\nsouth, and the pedimented gateways to the east and west fronts. The plan\r\nor interior arrangement of the ground-floor is exceedingly simple. A\r\ngreat central roadway runs through from north to south. This was a\r\ncompromise or concession to existing interests. It is from 50 to 60 feet\r\nwide, and the gateways at the entrances are very fine.\r\n\r\nThat on the south is ornamented by emblematical figures representing\r\nLondon and Edinburgh, and that on the north by similar figures symbolic\r\nof Dublin and Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe central roadway is bisected by an east and west avenue 25 feet in\r\nwidth. The entrance gates at the ends of this are somewhat similar to\r\nthose of the larger roadway. Six smaller avenues run parallel to the\r\ncentral roadway, cutting this secondary avenue at right angles. The\r\nblocks between the avenues contain the shops. These average about 36\r\nfeet by 15, and have offices and accommodation rooms above. The four\r\ncorner blocks formerly contained taverns, but only two of these now\r\nremain. The roof is an adaption of the Mansard principle, and is filled\r\nin with glass louvres. A peculiar feature of the market is the great\r\nunderground basement which is hollowed out to a depth of 22 feet, and\r\nextends even some distance beyond the limits of the building. This is\r\nsupported by iron girders measuring roughly about five miles, and\r\ncontaining about 3000 tons of wrought iron. This is intersected by\r\nrailway lines. Over the northern half the Metropolitan Railway has\r\nrunning powers; the southern forms a depot of the Great Western Railway.\r\nThere are here two hydraulic hoists, and the meat brought by the Great\r\nWestern lines is hoisted straight into the market. The circular\r\ndepression mentioned as being in the centre of West Smithfield is in\r\nconnection with this depot. All other meat is brought in vans and\r\nunloaded in the usual way. From 1 o’clock in the middle of the night for\r\nthree mornings in the week, and from 2 o’clock the other two mornings\r\nthe market is open, and closes alternately at 1 o’clock and 2 o’clock in\r\nthe daytime.\r\n\r\nFrom very early times Smithfield has been a market in addition to its\r\nmanifold other uses. Stow says:\r\n\r\n“There be the pens or folds, so called of sheep there parted, and penned\r\nup to be sold on market days.”\r\n\r\nThe Poultry Market adjoining was opened December 1, 1875. It covers an\r\narea of rather less than 1½ acres. It is similar generally in exterior\r\ntreatment to the market already described but differs in small\r\nparticulars. It is also on a different plan internally from the Meat\r\nMarket, having a square of shops round the outer edge and four\r\nintersecting avenues which cut it up into central blocks. Here every\r\nshop has its cellar beneath, and the vaults which run beneath the\r\navenues are occupied by a cold-air storage company, to whom belongs the\r\ngreat ventilating shaft in the triangular bit of land facing King\r\nStreet. The London, Chatham, and Dover line also cuts diagonally beneath\r\nthe market, but though the tunnelling is raised a little above the level\r\nof the flooring it still leaves room for vaults where it passes. There\r\nis one tavern in the Poultry Market.\r\n\r\nThe General Market is more expensive to the holder than either of the\r\nabove, for it is let by tender to the highest bidder, whereas the\r\nothers, by Act of Parliament, cannot claim a higher rental than a penny\r\nper square foot, and something extra for office space, etc.\r\n\r\nThis market was built to supersede the old Farringdon Market, and was at\r\nfirst meant for vegetables. At the time (1883) there was a movement\r\ntowards a new Fish Market, and so the building was devoted to that\r\npurpose. The fish business, however, was not successful, and in December\r\n1889 the market was transformed into a general market supplementary to\r\nthe meat and poultry. It is now fully occupied, and brings in a very\r\ngood rental.\r\n\r\nThe Fish Market on Snow Hill was opened in 1888. It is of triangular\r\nshape, and contains an inner triangle also. This is managed on much the\r\nsame plan as the rest, but does not seem to be very successful; for some\r\nreason the fish trade does not flourish at Smithfield.\r\n\r\nFor a full account of Bartholomew Fair, so popular while it lasted, see\r\n_London in the Eighteenth Century_, p. 465.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GROUP VII\r\n\r\n                   FLEET STREET AND ADJACENT STREETS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the south side, Fleet Street presents a long line of historical\r\nassociations—Bridewell, the Carmelites or Whitefriars, the Fleet Prison,\r\nAlsatia, and Sanctuary. These are all described in other parts of this\r\nwork (see _London in the Eighteenth Century_). On the north side are the\r\ncourts and streets of later origin. These, with the houses and shops of\r\nthat side, present memories chiefly of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nRoman remains have been found all along the river on the west of the\r\nCity. In the year 1800 was discovered a sepulchral monument, now in the\r\nGuildhall Museum; a tessellated pavement was found in 1681, near St.\r\nAndrew’s, Holborn; in 1595, a stone pavement supported on piles was\r\nfound near Chancery Lane, the piles proving the marshy character of the\r\nground; the “old Roman bath” is in Strand Lane; in 1722, in digging for\r\nthe foundations of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, an arch, a stone\r\nsarcophagus, and other Roman relics were found; and on Thorney Island\r\nitself numerous Roman remains have been discovered. In other words,\r\nthere were Roman villas and residences all along the river from Ludgate\r\nto Westminster inclusive.\r\n\r\nFleet Street began to be settled before the thirteenth century; in 1228,\r\none Henry le Buke slew another in Fleet Street and took sanctuary in St.\r\nMary Overies, Southwark. In 1311, certain servants of the King’s\r\nhousehold were arrested for a burglary in Fleet Street; at the same time\r\ncomplaints were made that the way from “La Barre du Novel Temple” and\r\nthe Palace of Westminster was choked with bushes and thickets. One of\r\nthe residents of Fleet Street supplied Edward II. with boots and tassels\r\nof silk in 1321. Shortly after, the houses from the Temple Church\r\nnorthwards were erected by the Templars.\r\n\r\nThe history of Fleet Street from the sixteenth century is much more\r\ndetailed than can be given here; the reader must be referred to the\r\nspecial histories of the street and the locality. It suffered greatly in\r\nthe Plague of 1625, when over 500 of the parishioners of St. Dunstan’s\r\nwere carried off.\r\n\r\nThe Fire of London terminated on this side in the third house, east of\r\nSt. Dunstan’s Church. The plan of the ruins drawn up by Wren and Hooke\r\nshows that Fleet Street was 37 feet in width west of Fetter Lane; at\r\nWater Lane it was 70 feet; at St. Bride’s Court 63 feet; thence to Bride\r\nLane 32 feet; and to Fleet Bridge only 23 feet. Shoe Lane was only 9\r\nfeet wide at the south end; Water Lane 11 feet at the north, and 26 at\r\nthe south; Salisbury Court 23 feet at the north end. After the Fire\r\nparts of Fleet Street were set back, and the street made more convenient\r\nfor the increasing traffic.\r\n\r\nFleet Street is especially remarkable for its taverns, its booksellers,\r\nand its banking-houses. In a valuable paper contributed by Mr. Hilton\r\nPrice to the _Archæological Journal_, December 1895, may be found a list\r\nas complete as can be hoped for of all the houses in Fleet Street with\r\ntheir signs. The learned writer has collected 315 signs, and has been\r\nable to fix 250 of them.\r\n\r\nAmong the taverns we may notice:\r\n\r\n(1) The _Devil_, called also _St. Dunstan’s_, or the _Old Devil_, sacred\r\nto the memory of Ben Jonson. Here was the _Apollo_, a room in which all\r\nkinds of clubs and societies met and entertainments were held. Ben\r\nJonson’s “Rules” are well known. They are painted in letters of gold on\r\na black board still preserved in Childs’ Bank:\r\n\r\n           Welcome all who lead or follow\r\n           To the oracle of Apollo—\r\n           Here he speaks out of his pottle,\r\n           Or the tripos, his Tower bottle;\r\n           All his answers are divine,\r\n           Truth itself doth flow in wine.\r\n           Hang up all the poor hop drinkers,\r\n           Cries old Sim, the King of Skinkers;\r\n           He who the half of life abuses,\r\n           That sits watering with the Muses,\r\n           Those dull girls no good can mean us;\r\n           Wine it is the milk of Venus,\r\n           And the poets’ horse accounted:\r\n           Ply it and you all are mounted.\r\n           ’Tis the true Phoebian liquor;\r\n           Cheers the brain, makes wit the quicker,\r\n           Pays all debts, cures all diseases,\r\n           And at once three senses pleases.\r\n           Welcome all who lead or follow\r\n           To the oracle of Apollo.\r\n\r\n                         PRICE, _Signs of Old Fleet Street_.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Rainbow_, opened in 1657 as a coffee-house by one James Farre,\r\nbarber surgeon. It was the second coffee-house in London.\r\n\r\n(3) The _Mitre_, where the Society of Antiquaries dined from 1728 to\r\n1775 on St. George’s Day. Here also the Royal Society held its meetings\r\nfor some years.\r\n\r\n(4) The _Bolt in Tun_, an ancient tavern of the fifteenth century. The\r\n_Daily News_ now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n(5) The _Cock_. Everybody knows Tennyson’s lines. The tavern has been\r\ntaken down and the site built over.\r\n\r\nMr. Hilton Price enumerates nearly fifty more.\r\n\r\nIf the street was full of taverns, it was equally the favourite place of\r\nbusiness for printers and booksellers. Again referring to Mr. Price’s\r\npaper we can compile the following list, omitting names of no importance\r\nin the commercial history of literature.\r\n\r\nRichard Pynson (1493). At Temple Bar.\r\n\r\nWilliam How (1571-90). Printer over Temple Bar.\r\n\r\nWard and Mundee. Booksellers over Temple Bar (1578).\r\n\r\nJohn Starkey (1660-81).

Publisher of the _Peerage_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sandby (1786). Bookseller, afterwards partner in Snow & Co.,\r\nStrand.\r\n\r\nWilliam Griffin (1556-71).\r\n\r\nJohn MacMurray, afterwards John Murray, who succeeded William Sandby\r\n(1760-1812).\r\n\r\nJohn Pemberton (1709-    ), No. 53, at the _Golden Buck_. Published\r\n(1716) _The Cries of London_.\r\n\r\nJacob Tonson. At the _Judge’s Head_ (1682-98). Published Dryden’s works,\r\nand was secretary to the Kit Kat Club.\r\n\r\nEdmund Curll.

Printers.\r\n William Redman (1556)       }\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  FLEET STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\nRobert Copland, an assistant of Caxton (1508-47).\r\n\r\nWilliam Copland (1553-69). Printer of Juliana Berner’s _Book of\r\nHawking_, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this long list, Mr. Hilton Price gives the names of 702\r\nbooksellers and printers. It is true that their names cover two\r\ncenturies at least, but they show conclusively that the real home of the\r\nbook trade from the sixteenth century to the end of the eighteenth was\r\nFleet Street. As we have seen, there were booksellers in St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, in Paternoster Row, in Little Britain at different times,\r\nbut Fleet Street contained by far the greater number of those in the\r\n“trade.”\r\n\r\nA third point of interest in Mr. Price’s list is that of the\r\nbanking-houses and goldsmiths who kept “running cashes.” Among these are\r\nthe names of Blanchard and Child, afterwards Child; James Chambers\r\n(1680), from whom are descended Messrs. Gosling and Sharpe; John Mawson\r\n& Co. (1677), the forerunners of Messrs. Hoare & Co.; James Heriot,\r\nbrother of George Heriot of Edinburgh; and others of less note.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to notice the residence of Izaak Walton. Mr. Price\r\nplaces it at the third house in the south-west corner of Chancery Lane.\r\nAt the corner was the King’s Head Tavern; next, on the west side, the\r\nsign of the Harrow; the next house, sometimes called the Harrow and\r\nCrown, was Izaak Walton’s.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the preceding that Fleet Street, from the fourteenth\r\ncentury at least, has always been a place of great resort. The large\r\nnumber of taverns was chiefly due, without doubt, to the Inns of Court\r\nand the lawyers. Suitors from all parts of the kingdom had to come to\r\nFleet Street; in its courts they found lodgings and in its taverns they\r\nfound refreshment and feasting. The place was convenient also for the\r\nCourt end of town, and for the people of the great nobles living in the\r\nStrand; there were no merchants in the street; the trade was all of the\r\nretail character, such as bookselling; when banks began to be\r\nestablished Fleet Street was much more convenient for the country\r\ngentlemen and nobles than Lombard Street; its coffee-houses were more\r\neasy of access to the lawyers, poets, wits, and actors who lived in the\r\nInns of Court and about Covent Garden, than those of the City or Charing\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nThe preceding lists do not exhaust the well-known names connected with\r\nFleet Street. In addition, to mention only a few, are those of Cowley,\r\nthe poet; Drayton; many of the early printers, successors of Caxton;\r\nmany booksellers of note; Milton, Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, Samuel\r\nRichardson, Tompion the watchmaker, Alderman Waithman, William Hone,\r\nDouglas Jerrold, the many distinguished writers who have created the\r\n_Daily Telegraph_, the _Daily Chronicle_, the _Daily News_, the\r\n_Standard_, and the host of papers and journals whose offices are in the\r\nstreet. In the burial-ground of St. Andrew’s, Shoe Lane, lie the remains\r\nof Thomas Chatterton; in Fetter Lane Wesley and Whitefield preached; in\r\nthis street was published Abbott’s _Weekly Register_; we may also\r\nenumerate Sedley the poet, Jacob Tonson, John Hoole, Crockford of\r\ngambling fame, Sir Symonds D’Ewes, antiquary, Henry Woodfall, Printer\r\n“without Temple Bar,” and Charles Knight. It may, indeed, be fairly\r\nstated that, during the whole of the eighteenth and a large part of the\r\nnineteenth century, Fleet Street was the haunt of all the literary men\r\nof the time, and that at the present moment it is the most important\r\ncentre of journalism. On the east of Ludgate is the office of _The\r\nTimes_; all the other London dailies, and a great number of provincial\r\nand colonial journals, have their offices in Fleet Street. But poets,\r\nnovelists, dramatists, and scholars are no longer found in this street;\r\nthey belong to West End Clubs and no longer congregate in taverns and\r\ncoffee-houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IZAAK WALTON’S HOUSE IN FLEET STREET\r\n]\r\n\r\nBell Yard, Temple Bar, one side of which is now occupied by the High\r\nCourts of Justice, is called by Pope in 1736 a “filthy old place.”\r\n\r\n=Shire Lane=, now built over by the Courts, was known also as Rogers\r\nLane; it was also called Sheer Lane; this lane, in spite of an evil\r\nname, possessed many associations. Here, at an inn called the Trumpet,\r\nIsaac Bickerstaffe was supposed to receive his friends, and was fabled\r\nto have his residence. In this lane was founded the Kit Kat Club, a\r\nsociety of gentlemen devoted to the Protestant interest; here lived\r\nElias Ashmole, the antiquary; here Sir Charles Sedley, the dramatic\r\npoet, was born; and here in a spunging-house Theodore Hook made the\r\nacquaintance of Dr. Maginn.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Fleet Street, Wynkyn de Worde, the printer, lived\r\nin Falcon Court; in Mitre Court was the Mitre, where Dr. Johnson and\r\nBoswell met to drink port. The Royal Society used to dine at the Mitre\r\n(1743-80). Sarah Malcolm, whose portrait was taken by Hogarth, was\r\nhanged opposite Mitre Court for the murder of Lydia Duncombe, Elizabeth\r\nHarrison, and Anne Price. Ram Alley, now Hare Court, opposite Fetter\r\nLane, was one of the later places of sanctuary; that is to say, a place\r\nwhere bailiffs and writs were not admitted. It had a passage into the\r\nTemple and another into Serjeant’s Inn, and was, as might be expected, a\r\nplace of evil reputation.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first building of St. Dunstan’s Church is not known, but\r\nit was before the thirteenth century. It narrowly escaped the Fire, and\r\nwas extensively repaired in 1701. The church, which was taken down in\r\n1829-30, was a later edifice; it occupied part of the present street,\r\nand had a row of shops along its south side. It was famous for its\r\n“Saints,” a couple of figures which struck the hours. They were\r\npurchased by the Marquis of Hertford and set up at St. Dunstan’s Villa,\r\nRegent’s Park. The statue of Queen Elizabeth, originally on the west\r\nfront of Ludgate, was happily preserved, and still stands over the\r\nvestry of the new church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ST. DUNSTAN IN THE WEST\r\n\r\n  This church stands on the north side of Fleet Street, between Fetter\r\n  Lane and Chancery Lane, in the ward of Farringdon Without. It\r\n  escaped the Great Fire, but very narrowly. It was extensively\r\n  repaired in 1701, and towards the close of 1829 taken down; the new\r\n  building, the work of John Shaw, was set back 30 feet from the\r\n  former site, and consecrated in 1833. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1318.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot and\r\n  Convent of Westminster as a Rectory, who gave it to Henry III. about\r\n  1272, when he founded the Domus Conversorum, then the Custos Domus\r\n  Conversorum; Edward II. and his successors; the Abbot and Convent of\r\n  Alnwick, October 29, 1386—a vicarage was ordained here in 1437, in\r\n  the same patronage, and so continued up to 1540; Henry VIII.;\r\n  William James, 1556; Lord Dudley, by grant of Edward VI.; Sir\r\n  Richard Sackvill, Knt.; George Rivers; Simeon Trustees since 1834.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 110.\r\n\r\n  The interior of the present church is octagonal in shape, containing\r\n  seven recesses, separated from each other by clustered columns and\r\n  pointed arches, with a clerestory above. The roof is groined and is\r\n  formed by eight beams of iron, united at the centre. The tower,\r\n  which rises at the south, contains three stories, and is surmounted\r\n  by an octagonal lantern; the whole is terminated by a high open\r\n  parapet. At each angle of the tower there are large pinnacles. The\r\n  total height of the steeple is 130 feet. The body of the church is\r\n  chiefly composed of brick, but the tower is of yellow freestone.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For Richard Bardelby, Prebendary of\r\n  Dunnington in York, who died in 1316, at the altar of St. Michael;\r\n  by Robert Hez, whose endowment fetched £10 : 19 : 8 in 1548, but\r\n  there hath been no priest found for twenty years before that time,\r\n  and so the money is employed in repairs of the church; for Nicholas\r\n  Coningstow, John Knape at the Altar of St. Katherine; by John Burrel\r\n  de Askham, for himself and for John de Langeton and Simon Flemyng,\r\n  for which the King granted his licence, May 8, 1375. Here was\r\n  founded the Brotherhood of Our Lady and St. Dunstan, wherein was the\r\n  Guild of St. Anne, endowed by William Chapman, valued at £11 in\r\n  1548, when Randall Smith was chaplain; within the same Guild was a\r\n  Chantry, founded by William Marshall, whose endowment fetched £22 in\r\n  1548, when William Neale was chaplain; and yet another Chantry was\r\n  endowed in the same Brotherhood by William Westwood, and for which\r\n  the King granted his licence July 22, 1440, at the Altar of St. Mary\r\n  in the south part of the church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. DUNSTAN IN THE WEST (OLD CHURCH)\r\n]\r\n\r\n  A large number of monuments belonging to the old church are affixed\r\n  to the walls, commemorating Gerard Legh, a member of the Inner\r\n  Temple, who died 1563; Cuthbert Fetherstone, the King’s doorkeeper,\r\n  who died 1615; Alexander Layton, a famed swordsman, who died 1679,\r\n  and others. Among later monuments are those of two Sir Richard\r\n  Hoares, both Lord Mayors, in 1712 and 1745, whose descendants were\r\n  liberal benefactors of the new church. Ralph Bane, Bishop of\r\n  Lichfield and Coventry, and Oglethorpe, Bishop of Carlisle, were\r\n  buried here in 1559, also Dr. Thomas White, founder of Sion College.\r\n  Here, too, were baptized the great Earl of Strafford in 1593, and\r\n  Bulstrode Whitelocke in 1605, author of the _Memorials of English\r\n  Affairs_. William Tyndale was a frequent preacher in this church,\r\n  and in more recent times William Romaine was appointed Lecturer\r\n  (1749). In 1895 a stained-glass window at the north-west was erected\r\n  in memory of Izaak Walton.\r\n\r\n  A considerable number of gift sermons are recorded by Stow: Dr.\r\n  White gave £18; Mr. Adams gave £2. The total of the smaller\r\n  contributions was £5 : 6 : 8.\r\n\r\n  There were two charity schools, one for fifty boys, four of whom\r\n  were taught navigation; the other for forty girls, who were fitted\r\n  for service. These were established in 1708, and an infants’ school\r\n  was founded shortly after in Fetter Lane. The three still exist as\r\n  “fee-paying” church schools.\r\n\r\n  Among the clergy of the church have been William Tyndale (d. 1536);\r\n  Dr. Thomas White (d. 1624), founder of Sion College; Dr. John Donne\r\n  (1573-1631), Dean of St. Paul’s; the silver-tongued Dr. William\r\n  Bates, ejected in 1660; Richard Baxter (1615-91); and William\r\n  Romaine (1714-95).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TEMPLE\r\n\r\n                            By W. J. LOFTIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Temple is situated on the left bank of the Thames, partly within the\r\nCity of London and partly within the ancient county of Middlesex. It\r\nconsisted originally of the Inner, Middle, and Outer Temples, of which\r\nthe first and second were in what was described in the thirteenth\r\ncentury as “the suburb of London,” and afterwards as the ward of\r\nFarringdon Without. This former suburb had many descriptions and\r\ndesignations, owing to its geographical situation between two tributary\r\nbrooks or bournes and the tidal waters of the Thames. The brooks have\r\nnow disappeared under ground, but the Fleet, along the City wall, and\r\nthe Millbrook, where Mill Ford Lane is now, formed the east and west\r\nboundaries of a green slope between Fleet Street and the river. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this whole region, as far as the wall, was in Westminster, but\r\nHenry III. and the citizens divided it between them when the London\r\nboundaries were pushed out to “The Bar of the New Temple,” and when\r\nPeter of Savoy built his palace on the open strand beyond it. After the\r\nConquest the only access to the City was by a lane which followed a\r\nridge of higher ground from the Roman landing-place at the Millbrook,\r\nand it entered the City walls at Newgate. When Ludgate, a postern, as\r\nits name denotes, was opened and a bridge crossed the Fleet, all was\r\nchanged, and the easy way from Westminster by land no longer led up\r\nShow-well-lane (now Shoe Lane) to Newgate, but through Fleet Street to\r\nLudgate. Then a church was built at St. Bride’s Well, the Whitefriars or\r\nCarmelites settled beside it in 1241, and the Templars, an order of\r\nmilitary monks, bought the lands called after them the Inner and Middle\r\nTemples, with, outside the City bar, the fields known as the Coney\r\nGarth, Fickett’s Field, and the Outer Temple as tilting and exercising\r\ngrounds. Fetter Lane recalls the existence of armourers who made\r\nfetters, that is, lance rests, for the knights, and the City still pays\r\nan annual rent to the Crown for the forge, where, no doubt, weapons were\r\nmended and war-horses shod. The Templars had lived at first at the\r\nHolborn end of Chancery Lane, where Southampton Buildings are now, and\r\nafter they migrated here in 1184 their house was called the New Temple.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on the eastern part of the site, and the circular church\r\nwas built in the year following, namely 1185, the choir being added in\r\n1240. As long as the Templars remained here it seems probable that their\r\nbuildings did not extend any farther west. The local names, such as\r\nFountain Court, Garden Court, Elm Court, are all in the Middle Temple,\r\nand seem to contain reminiscences of the time when it was still part of\r\nthe gardens. The names in the Inner Temple, Cloister Court, King’s Bench\r\nWalk, Crown Office Row, have an appearance of greater antiquity; but Fig\r\nTree Court is in the same division, and Brick Court in the Middle\r\nTemple, so it will not do to press the argument very far.\r\n\r\nIn December 1307 the Temple was seized by the Sheriffs of London in\r\nobedience to a writ issued by King Edward II., and the order was soon\r\nafter formally suppressed. The Templars had long been remarkable for\r\ntheir wealth and pride; their campaigns in the Holy Land were\r\nineffective, chiefly on account of their quarrels with the Hospitallers,\r\nand in most European kingdoms they were suspected of sorcery, heresy,\r\nand other crimes. Their suppression was attended with greater cruelty\r\nabroad than in England, and though some thirty members of the order were\r\nsent to the Tower, most of them were subsequently released, and a\r\npension was granted to some. The “New Temple” was given by the King as a\r\nresidence to his cousin, Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. He died in\r\n1324, but had left the Temple long before, having in 1314 transferred it\r\nto Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, with the King’s consent. The grant\r\nincludes Fickett’s Field, and as Lancaster’s wife was the heiress of\r\nLacy, Earl of Lincoln, he came into possession, by a curious\r\ncoincidence, of the future sites of Lincoln’s Inn, the two Temples, and\r\nthe new Law Courts, as well as of the Savoy. Lancaster was beheaded at\r\nPontefract in 1322, but was esteemed a saint and martyr by the people on\r\naccount of his long opposition, first to Gaveston, and later to the\r\nDespencers, the unworthy favourites of Edward II. Meanwhile the\r\nHospitallers or Knights of St. John at Clerkenwell obtained a papal\r\ndecree that they were to succeed to the property of the Templars, and in\r\n1324 they were allowed to take possession. The Pope made it a condition\r\nthat the Temple was not to be put to profane uses, and the new owners in\r\npromptly letting it to the lawyers—who were in those days almost all in\r\nholy orders, clergy, that is, able to read and write—may have supposed\r\nthey were fulfilling the papal injunction.\r\n\r\nA survey was made about this time, and from it and other indications we\r\nmay form some idea of what the house was like when the Templars lost it.\r\nThe chapel of St. Mary stood where it still is, and beside it the\r\nsmaller chapel of St. Anne. There were already two gates. The Master’s\r\nhouse was eastward of the church, but nearer than the present house, and\r\nformed, with the treasury and the hall, a quadrangle round the chapel.\r\nThis treasury was occasionally used by King John and King Henry before\r\nthe regalia was lodged in the Tower. John was here himself in 1212;\r\nHenry III. in 1232, when he seized the money of Hubert de Burgh,\r\ndeposited in the treasury; and Edward I. in 1283. The library probably\r\noccupies the site. The treasurer’s house adjoined, as it does still; and\r\nthere was a cloister, as there is still. Notwithstanding the number of\r\nyears between the expulsion of the Templars and the organisation of the\r\nlawyers, the old names were preserved. The chaplain was the Master, the\r\ntreasurer was the chief of the lawyers. It would seem as if the old\r\ntitles of the officials were kept alive by the buildings.\r\n\r\nWe obtain a glimpse of the daily life of these new Templars from\r\nChaucer. If he lived in the Savoy, as he seems to have done, before he\r\nwent to Westminster, he had the lawyers close at hand, and in one of his\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ he tell us that the Manciple belonged to the Temple,\r\nwhere he had thirty masters, for whom he was caterer. From which we may\r\nconclude that the number of lawyers had reached thirty in 1380, unless,\r\nindeed, there were several houses full. The servants of the Templars,\r\nthe _servientes_ or serjeants, survived the expulsion of their masters,\r\nand after they died out their place was taken by the common law\r\npractitioners, who formed themselves into a society or inn, which\r\nadjoined the Temple on the northeast as early as 1333; while in 1337 we\r\nbegin to hear of two halls, and in the reign of Henry VI. the Templars\r\nconsisted of two separate bodies, which professed absolute equality. The\r\nInner, however, is very much richer than the Middle Temple and has more\r\nmembers. Every year the benchers of one dine with the benchers of the\r\nother; and when James I. granted the site without any rents or\r\nrestrictions, such as had survived till then, his charter is addressed\r\nto the members of both societies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Outer Temple had been leased to the Bishops of Exeter,\r\nand the land between Fickett’s Field and Lincoln’s Inn to the Bishop of\r\nChichester. Another bishop had lodgings actually within the Temple. On\r\nthe east side of Inner Temple Lane, north of the porch of the Round\r\nChurch, was Ely House, with its chapel of St. Thomas of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThe Great Fire of 1666 made the Temple its western terminus. The\r\nMaster’s house was burned, but the chapel was spared, the flames ceasing\r\nwithin a very few feet of the chancel. Wren built the new gate facing\r\nChancery Lane and the Master’s house, removing it to where it still\r\nstands. His style, if not his hand, may also be seen in other buildings,\r\nsuch as the doorways in King’s Bench Walk. The archway of the Inner\r\nTemple Gate dates from 1607, but the front of the house above it in\r\nFleet Street has been refaced lately in a suitable style.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to note here that the other round churches in England\r\nwere not built by the Templars; there are three—St. Sepulchre at\r\nCambridge, St. Sepulchre at Northampton, and St. John of Jerusalem at\r\nLittle Maplestead, in Essex. The last named was probably built by the\r\nHospitallers. There is also a round chapel in Ludlow Castle.\r\n\r\nThe visitor will probably go first to the chapel. It is usual to mark\r\nits importance and size by calling it “the Temple Church.” It was built\r\nby the Templars, the round part, Norman in style, being consecrated in\r\n1185 by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, who happened to be in England\r\non a begging tour. With its porch, it has been rebuilt, repaired,\r\nimproved, and “restored,” until very little of the original masonry, if\r\nany, remains. The choir was added in 1240 and was a very pure and\r\nbeautiful example of the “Early English” or first pointed style. It has\r\nbeen ever since very obnoxious to ignorant builders, and a mere list of\r\nthe alterations would perhaps produce an impression that nothing is left\r\nworth seeing. This is not the case; but it is true that after an\r\nornamental reparation in 1685, another after a fire ten years later, and\r\nagain after forty years, it must have seemed very venerable and still in\r\nparts very picturesque even after a general repair in 1811. The\r\nmonuments, some very magnificent, others historically interesting, were\r\nstill undisturbed, and, from the recumbent effigies in the Norman round\r\nnave to the judges in their robes and collars in the chancel, formed an\r\nunequalled series of curious and sometimes fine works of art. The\r\nexquisite carving of the Corinthian reredos behind the communion table\r\nsufficed to bring the various inconsistent styles together. But the\r\nfirst notions of those who began to study old English architecture led\r\nto an attack on this incongruity in 1824. The Norman carvings were all\r\nreplaced by modern work and some additions. The arcade, with its\r\ngrotesque heads, was set up in 1827, and though it is out of place and,\r\nmoreover, deceptive, will certainly be admired. Various ancient\r\nbuildings, one of them the chapel of St. Anne, were removed. But it was\r\nnot until 1830 that the great restoration was begun. During the progress\r\nof these disastrous operations the circular church was vaulted in stucco\r\nand painted; the flooring was lowered, the tombs and effigies of the\r\nknights removed and their bones cast out; the chancel was gutted, the\r\nmonuments taken down, much injured in the process, and finally “as far\r\nas possible” set up again in the triforium, a few being hidden away\r\nunder the bellows of the organ; the beautiful reredos was taken away,\r\nthe whole chancel repaved, revaulted, and painted; the church filled\r\nwith tiers of pews, hiding any Gothic memorials which were allowed to\r\nremain; and finally, all the windows were reglazed, in a style supposed\r\nto be Early English and, at all events, no worse than what would be put\r\nin at the present day to judge by some neighbouring examples. All this\r\nwork of destruction went on for ten years and cost more than £70,000.\r\n\r\nOn entering the church now, the visitor is surprised that so much\r\nremains to be admired. A semicircular arch, in the Norman style of 1824,\r\nadmits us to the Round Church, where the arches are pointed. The\r\neffigies of the knights have been replaced on the floor in neat groups,\r\nand labelled, but somewhat conjecturally, with the names of certain\r\nEarls of Pembroke and others who are recorded to have been buried here.\r\nThe diameter of this part of the church, which is now the nave, is 58\r\nfeet, the choir beyond being 58 feet in width and 82 feet in length. The\r\ncentral part of the nave is the same in width as the middle aisle of the\r\nthree in the choir, namely 23½ feet, while the circular aisle and each\r\nof the side aisles are 15½ feet. The three aisles are 37 feet high and\r\nthe modern roof of the nave 60 feet. The seats are of dark oak and rise\r\nin tiers on each side. Two modern doors open on the north side, and a\r\nstair, winding and very narrow, conducts the visitor to the triforium of\r\nthe Round Church. Here, in a very unsuitable situation, are most of the\r\nmonuments removed from the chancel.\r\n\r\nThe monuments comprise an interesting series of all periods from the\r\nReformation down, and some fragments of sculpture removed, with the\r\ncomplete tombs at the time of the “restoration,” in 1830. One of the\r\noldest represents Edward Plowden who died in 1584. The brasses were\r\nformerly very numerous but have all disappeared, together with a great\r\nmany tablets, such as Pepys describes in 1666 when he says he looked\r\n“with pleasure on the monuments and epitaphs.” Plowden adhered to\r\nRomanism, but his epitaph contains a quotation from the Book of Common\r\nPrayer. There is a monument to Oliver Goldsmith erected in 1837. In the\r\nchurch is a bust of the “Judicious” Hooker (d. 1600); a tablet to John\r\nSelden (d. 1654); and at the south-east end, partly hidden by the pews,\r\nan effigy supposed to represent Silvester Everden, Bishop of Carlisle,\r\nkilled by a fall in 1254. At the entrance to the triforium is the only\r\none left of many small chambers which formerly adjoined the church; it\r\nis labelled by the vergers the Penitential Cell, I do not know why.\r\n\r\nNorth of the chapel is the little plot of ground in which Oliver\r\nGoldsmith was buried in 1774. It is so small that, when a gravestone was\r\nlaid down in 1860, there was little choice as to the exact place, which,\r\nhowever, is really unknown.\r\n\r\nThe arms of both Temples may be seen in many places in the church. Those\r\nof the Middle Temple consist of a red cross on a white ground, with a\r\nfigure of the Pascal Lamb in the centre, being the arms of the Templars.\r\nThe arms of the other society are, strictly speaking, not heraldry,\r\nbeing, on a blue ground, a representation of the Greek mythical Pegasus,\r\nin white. It is said to be derived from an ancient device or badge\r\nrepresenting two knights of the Temple on one horse, and was adopted in\r\n1503.\r\n\r\nThough the Inner Temple must be considered older than the Middle Temple,\r\nthere is less to be seen in it. The Hall is not beautiful externally. It\r\nwas built in 1869 by Sidney Smirke, and the exterior gives one no idea\r\nthat the interior is worth a visit. However, the fine open timber roof\r\nand a very handsome screen will be admired, as well as the heraldry in\r\nthe windows. The Library is spacious within and convenient, but suffers\r\nwithout, like the Hall, from a want of proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INNER TEMPLE GATE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  By permission of the London County Council.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe eminent inhabitants have been very numerous. A mere list would\r\noccupy many pages. In the Master’s house have lived Sherlock, Dean of\r\nSt. Paul’s; his son, the Bishop of London; Vaughan, Dean of Llandaff;\r\nand Alfred Ainger. Charles Lamb was born in 1775 at No. 4 Inner Temple\r\nLane—now rebuilt. Thackeray had chambers at 10 Crown Office Row. William\r\nCowper lived in the Inner Temple in 1755. Dr. Johnson was living at 1\r\nInner Temple Lane in 1763. The house has been pulled down to make way\r\nfor Johnson’s Buildings. Among the great lawyers were Lyttleton, as well\r\nas Coke, who wrote upon him; Sir Julius Cæsar; Finch, Earl of\r\nNottingham; Thurlow; Tenterden; Daines Barrington, the correspondent of\r\nWhite of Selborne; Thesiger, Lord Chelmsford; but perhaps the greatest\r\nof them all was Murray, Earl of Mansfield, whose chambers were at 5\r\nKing’s Bench Walk.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of the Middle Temple is the ancient Hall, and the\r\ngreatest glory of the Hall is that a play by William Shakespeare was\r\nacted in it in February 1602. This was _Twelfth Night_, which had not\r\nthen been printed, and is supposed to have only just been written. John\r\nManningham, a student then in the Temple, describes it in his Diary, now\r\nin the British Museum. The Christmas and Candlemas festivities in the\r\nHall, of which the play formed part, are described at great length by\r\nDugdale.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was built in 1572, the screen in 1574, so that the local legend\r\nwhich says the wood of some ships of the Spanish Armada was used cannot\r\nbe true. The heraldry is copious and interesting, both in the windows\r\nand on the panelling and roof, some of it being as old as the Hall. The\r\nwhole building is of great interest architecturally. The windows are\r\nstrictly Gothic, while everything else is Elizabethan or later in form.\r\nThe screen has Tuscan columns and round arches, and is exquisitely\r\ncarved from a bold design. The internal length is 100 feet, the width\r\n42, and the height 47. The roof is extremely fine but simple in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe Library is an imposing but modern building south of the Hall and\r\ngarden near the Embankment. It is in an early style of Gothic, the\r\nprincipal room being 86 feet long, 42 wide, and 63 high, designed by H.\r\nR. Abraham in 1861. A couple of stories of offices and an external\r\nstaircase are rather picturesque, and the whole building is by far the\r\nbest erected in either Temple during the last fifty years. A gateway\r\nnear, leading to the Embankment, can only be described as an eyesore.\r\n\r\nReturning through the gardens to Fountain Court we note several sundials\r\nnear the Hall, in Pump Court and Brick Court, one in particular near the\r\nexit to the Outer Temple—_Vestigia nulla retrorsum_—which seems to\r\nconvey a warning to those who seek the lawyers. The largest sundial is,\r\nhowever, in the Inner Temple, the famous “Blackamoor,” removed thither\r\nwhen Clement’s Inn was pulled down. It is of lead, and replaces one\r\nmentioned by Lamb which bore the uncivil motto, “Begone about your\r\nbusiness.” In Brick Court, near the fountain, with the Middle Temple\r\nHall on one side, memories of three if not four great authors seem to\r\nmeet. Goldsmith bought the chambers at 2 Brick Court, looking on the\r\nfountain and the Hall, about 1765, and lived here till his death in\r\n1774. Here he wrote _The Deserted Village_ and _The Traveller_, and\r\ndescribed in _Animated Nature_ the doings of a rookery in the old trees\r\non which his windows opened. The place is also connected with Thackeray,\r\nwho describes the chambers in his _English Humourists_. We have already\r\nnamed Shakespeare and the performance of _Twelfth Night_ in the Hall,\r\nbut there is direct mention of the gardens and their roses in the First\r\nPart of _Henry VI._ But to most of us it is Dickens who is most clearly\r\nremembered when we stand by the fountain. In _Martin Chuzzlewit_ he\r\nbrings Ruth Pinch here to meet John Westlock. “The Temple fountain might\r\nhave leaped up twenty feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood\r\nthat in her person stole on, sparkling through the dry and dusty\r\nchannels of the Law.” With Shakespeare, Goldsmith, Dickens and Thackeray\r\nwe might close the list of eminent inhabitants, but the Middle Temple\r\nhas been very fortunate in this respect. Edmund Burke was here before\r\n1750. Tom Moore was a student in 1799, and Sheridan some twenty years\r\nearlier. Among the eminent lawyers may be named the Norths, Rowden,\r\nClarendon, Somers, Cowper, Blackstone, Eldon, Stowell, and Talfourd—a\r\ngoodly list, though far from complete.\r\n\r\nChancery Lane will be found in the succeeding volume under Holborn, but\r\nthe liberty of the Rolls is dealt with here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ROLLS AND THE RECORD OFFICE\r\n\r\nA fine new building in Chancery Lane, extending to Fetter Lane, stands\r\non the site occupied by an ancient institution called The Rolls. The\r\nearly history of the Rolls has yet to be written. It is intimately\r\nconnected from the first with that of the Jewish Colony which came to\r\nEngland from Rouen with William I. At that time the canon law forbade\r\nChristians to take usury. The Jews were the licensed usurers of the\r\nKing. A masterly essay, prefixed to the _Catalogue_ of the Jewish\r\nExhibition in 1887, explains the situation in a few words: “the\r\nexchequer treated the money of the Jews as held at the pleasure of the\r\nKing.” Special Justices were appointed to preside in the Jews’\r\nExchequer; all deeds, contracts, bonds, and other documents relating to\r\nmonetary transactions had to be registered and placed in charge of the\r\nRolls Court or Record Office at the King’s palace at Westminster. The\r\nHebrew word _Shetár_, which means a legal document, gave its name to the\r\nStar Chamber, and long after the Jews had left England the court held\r\nthere retained the old name. We may assume that the chief of the\r\njustices of this Rolls Court was the principal controller of the whole\r\ncolony, and that, when Henry III. opened the House for Converts, it fell\r\nnaturally under the same jurisdiction. Accordingly we find from the\r\nfirst that the Master of the Rolls was also connected with the House of\r\nConverts. A similar house was founded at Oxford, but this one in London\r\nowed its continued existence to the fact that the Master of the Rolls\r\nlived in it. When the law was relaxed and the Jews ceased to be the only\r\nusurers, the Master’s jurisdiction extended to the Lombards and Italian\r\nbankers, and when, sixty years after the foundation of the house, the\r\nJews were expelled, the double office continued to exist and in the same\r\nplace. Converts were still received there till the reign of Charles II.\r\nMeanwhile, under the Commonwealth, the laws of 1290 against the Jews had\r\nbeen in great part rescinded; but the Master of the Rolls continued to\r\nbe called “Keeper of the House of Converts” down to 1873, when Sir\r\nGeorge Jessel, himself a Jew, was appointed Master of the Rolls but not\r\nKeeper of the House.\r\n\r\nThe history of the house has been detailed by Mr. W. J. Hardy. It became\r\nruinous early in the eighteenth century, and a new building of good\r\nproportions was erected by Colin Campbell in 1717. This, in its turn,\r\nwas pulled down to make way for the Record Office. With it also perished\r\nthe chapel, usually called “The Rolls Chapel,” of which Sir Henry\r\nMaxwell Lyte, who holds the office of Deputy Keeper, instituted in 1837,\r\nhas written an account, appended to the Fifty-Seventh Annual Report in\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nThe first Master of the Rolls who is known to have also been Keeper of\r\nthe House of Converts was Adam de Osgodeby, appointed in 1307. The next\r\nMaster was William Ayremyne, who also held both offices, but they were\r\nnot formally united till 1378. The house stood in Chancery Lane, a\r\nlittle to the north of the present principal entrance of the Record\r\nOffice. Henry III. endowed it with 700 marks a year, calling it “the\r\nhouse in New Street in the suburbs of London which he had founded for\r\nconverts from Judaism.” It was rebuilt by William Burstall, Master in\r\n1372, together with the chapel. Here, and in the subsequent house, the\r\nsuccessive Masters held their court and also lived. At the opening of\r\nthe new law courts all the space was surrendered to the Records, the\r\nhouse disappeared, and, though a strong effort was made to save it, the\r\nchapel too, except the monuments. The present great building, begun in\r\n1856, from designs by Pennethorne, in a very stiff style of Gothic, was\r\ncompleted in 1897. The Rolls and other documents have gradually been\r\nhoused in it, comprising all those which were previously in the Tower,\r\nthe Chapter House, Westminster, Carlton Ride, St. James’s, and the State\r\nPaper Office, including the paybooks of the Navy, the registers of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster, and many other sets of manuscripts. The final\r\ndesigns were made by Sir John Taylor of the office of Works, and though\r\nthe Chancery Lane front harmonises very well with Pennethorne’s work it\r\nis a good deal less stiff. Two statues on the inner face of the entrance\r\ntower represent Henry III. and Edward III., and the removal was effected\r\nin October 1895. All the floors are now fireproof, and the cases to\r\ncontain the Rolls are of steel with slate shelves. The Chancery Lane\r\nfront is 225 feet long and 84 feet high. There are two great public\r\nreading-rooms where both legal and historical researches are daily\r\ncarried on, with the learned assistance of a large staff of clerks,\r\ntrained to decipher the most crabbed writing and to translate mediæval\r\nLatin and law French, as well as to calendar thousands of documents\r\nbearing on the ancient official correspondence here preserved—such\r\nsubjects as Chancery and Exchequer proceedings, court rolls, colonial\r\nletters and despatches, domestic state papers, accounts, and a hundred\r\nother kinds of affairs of public and private interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the Record Office used to be the Rolls\r\nChapel. An arch of the fourteenth century, probably of Burstall’s\r\nbuilding, has been set up in the garden against an east wall. The site\r\nof the destroyed chapel is on the left as we pass through the principal\r\nentrance from Chancery Lane. Here a handsome hall, with five fine\r\nwindows in the Perpendicular style, has been built for a museum. On the\r\nnorth side very nearly as they stood in the chapel are two most\r\ninteresting monuments, and a third which was formerly on the opposite\r\nside. The rest of the space is taken up with the desks and cases\r\ndescribed below. The museum is open free every afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe monuments comprise those of Masters of the Rolls and of members of\r\ntheir families whose graves were underneath the flooring of the chapel.\r\nThe most ancient is that of John Yong, Master from January 22, 1508.\r\nThree converts, we are told, one man and two women, were received during\r\nhis keepership of the house, which lasted till his death. Yong was Dean\r\nof York, and an eminent diplomatist under Henry VIII. He was a friend of\r\nErasmus, who dedicated a book to him of Colet and the other early\r\nreformers. He died of the “sweating sickness” on April 25, 1516, the day\r\non which he had made his will, enjoining upon his executors that he\r\nshould be buried in the Rolls Chapel. The monument is by Pietro\r\nTorregiano, who was employed at Westminster at the time on the effigy of\r\nHenry VII. Yong is represented recumbent in a long red gown with tippet\r\nand hood and a square cap, such as we see in Holbein’s portraits. Behind\r\nthe figure are the heads of Christ and two cherubs, all of which show\r\ntraces of colour and gilding as well as the sarcophagus below, and\r\nYong’s arms, Lozenge vert and argent, on a chevron, azure, 3 annulets,\r\nor, on a chief of the second, a goat’s head erased between two scallop\r\nshells, gules. This motto is on the sarcophagus: “Dominus firmamentum\r\nmeum.” In his report (1896) Sir H. Maxwell Lyte proves that the whole\r\nmonument was removed probably from the chancel of the chapel when it was\r\npulled down in the seventeenth century. The cherubs’ heads he considers\r\nlater than the rest of the sculpture. A brief inscription mentions the\r\ndate of Yong’s death and adds that “his faithful executors” placed this\r\nmonument in 1516, the year of his death. It is curious to observe that\r\nthere were living in 1516 three men of the same name, John Yong, all\r\nscholars of Winchester, all fellows of New College, Oxford, and a fourth\r\nwho was Norroy King of Arms. Of them one, who was suffragan to\r\nFitzjames, the Bishop of London, who had become blind, and Bishop of\r\nGallipoli, _in partibus_, is usually confused with his namesake the Dean\r\nof York, who was Master of the Rolls; indeed, Sir H. Maxwell Lyte\r\nremarks that neither the tomb nor the epitaph gives any indication that\r\n“he was titular bishop of Gallipoli.” Bishop Yong, who does not seem to\r\nhave shared his namesake’s reforming views, survived him for ten years.\r\nTwo other fine monuments with effigies are to Richard Alington, who died\r\nin 1561, and to Edward Bruce, Lord Bruce of Kinloss, who died in 1611.\r\nThere are several tablets, a statue of George I., and a bust of Lord\r\nRomilly.\r\n\r\nThe cases contain typical manuscripts, many of them finely illuminated.\r\nAmong them are examples of royal charters, (A); letters patent, (B);\r\nvolumes like the “Black Book of the Exchequer,” (C); Rolls with\r\npictures, (D); and on the centre table the two volumes which contain the\r\ncelebrated “Domesday Survey,” completed in 1086. In case E is the great\r\nbook which contains the agreement between Henry VII. and the Abbot of\r\nWestminster concerning the masses to be celebrated “for ever” in the\r\nKing’s chapel. Some very fine illuminations are in the treaty of peace\r\nwith Francis I. (Case F). Letters and despatches of interest will be\r\nfound in the remaining cases, such as the account of Nelson’s death\r\n(Case I); Great Seal for Virginia and for New York, and a letter of\r\nGeorge Washington to George III. (Case M); besides boxes and coffers\r\nmade for the preservation of important books or documents.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf =Fetter Lane= Stow says: “There is Fewter Lane which stretches south\r\ninto Fleet Street, by the east end of St. Dunstan’s Church and is\r\nso-called of fewters (or idle people) lying there as in a way leading to\r\ngardens; but the same is now of latter years on both sides built through\r\nwith many fair houses.”\r\n\r\nOthers derived the name from the fetters of criminals or the fetters or\r\nrests on the breastplates of the knights riding through to forays in\r\nFickett’s Field (Lincoln’s Inn Fields) adjoining (see p. 370). Tom\r\nPayne, who wrote _The Rights of Man_, lived at No. 77, and it is said\r\nthat Dryden lived at No. 16, now demolished.\r\n\r\n=Crane Court= is lined by rows of old buildings mingled with some\r\nwarehouses of more modern date. The tiled roofs and projecting parapets,\r\nwith rows of little windows peeping out under the roof, are in contrast\r\nwith the new red brick of the building belonging to the Scottish\r\nCorporation erected in 1880. This is at the north end of the court,\r\nfacing the entry, and is on the site of the building temporarily\r\noccupied by the Royal Society. The earlier building was built by Sir C.\r\nWren, and contained a fine hall with richly stuccoed ceiling; the walls\r\nwere hung with pictures by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Wilkie, etc., but\r\nunfortunately it was destroyed by fire, November 1877, together with all\r\nrelics. The Scottish Corporation originated in a Society formed shortly\r\nafter the accession of James I. for relieving the unfortunate poor among\r\nthose of the Scottish nation who had followed their king to England.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 the premises in Crane Court were bought from the Royal Society\r\nfor £1000. The fire which destroyed the hall destroyed almost all\r\nrecords. On July 21, 1880, the present hall was opened by the Duke of\r\nArgyll. On the ground-floor is a spacious chapel in which are held the\r\nmonthly religious services, and where the pensioners are accommodated on\r\npay days; above are the offices and the hall for the meeting of the\r\ngovernors. Professor T. L. Donaldson was the architect, and he has tried\r\nto infuse as much of the national sentiment as possible into the design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SUPPOSED HOUSE OF DRYDEN, FETTER LANE\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Johnson’s Court Dr. Johnson lived (1766-76) at No. 7. The Court,\r\nhowever, is not named after him. The Society of Arts was founded in this\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nIn Bolt Court are several old stucco buildings. One at the north end\r\ncontains the London County Council Technical Education Board. Another on\r\nthe east has a curious old doorway with “The Medical Society of London”\r\nin well-worn letters running round the upper part of a bas-relief. The\r\nhouse belonged to Dr. Lettsom, who was the founder of the Medical\r\nSociety. Johnson lived in Bolt Court at No. 8, but the house was burned\r\ndown in 1849. The present technical schools are on the site.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Johnson’s Court was not named after the learned\r\ndoctor, though he lived here, in No. 7, from 1766 to 1776. James\r\nFerguson the astronomer died at No. 4 in 1776. William Cobbett also\r\nlived in Bolt Court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Pictorial Agency._\r\n\r\n  DR. JOHNSON’S HOUSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Gough Square= is also associated with the name of the great\r\nlexicographer. The Society of Arts have placed a circular tablet on the\r\nwall of the house, No. 17, which faces eastward. Johnson lived here from\r\n1741 to 1758. The house is an old eighteenth-century brick one, not very\r\nlarge, and not remarkable in any way. A printer and a publisher share\r\nthe ground-floor, and above is a reading club. The doorway is slightly\r\ndecorative, and the heavy woodwork of the door itself and the massive\r\nchain remain as they were in Johnson’s time. The Club was founded by a\r\nMr. Campbell in 1887 for the recreation and assistance of working lads\r\nand girls in the district. There are now one hundred members. The\r\nremainder of the Square varies in character. On the south side, and at\r\nthe east end, there are old eighteenth-century brick houses of the usual\r\npattern. One or two of the doorways have carved brackets, and one fluted\r\npilasters. Over the entry from Goldsmith Street is another house similar\r\nin character, but the rest of the north side is of obtrusively new brick\r\nbuildings. The Square continuing southward contains some warehouses and\r\na few old houses.\r\n\r\nThe name of =Water Lane= was changed to Whitefriars Street. Thomas\r\nTompion (d. 1713), the “father of English watch-making,” lived at the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n=Salisbury Square= occupies the site of the courtyard of Salisbury\r\nHouse, the residence of the Bishops of Salisbury, afterwards called\r\nDorset House. In Dorset Gardens beside the river was the Duke’s Theatre.\r\nBetterton, Harris, Underhill, and Sandford, actors, lived in this court.\r\nHere also lived for a time John Dryden, Shadwell, and Lady Davenant,\r\nwidow of Sir William Davenant. But the chief glory of Salisbury Court or\r\nSquare is its memory of Richardson, novelist and printer. His house was\r\nin the north-west angle, his printing offices on the east side; here he\r\nwrote _Pamela_; here, for a time, Goldsmith was his press corrector. The\r\ntheatre called the Salisbury Court Theatre was constructed in 1629 out\r\nof the barn or granary at the lower end of the court. It was the\r\nseventeenth theatre opened in London within a period of sixty years. The\r\nhouse was pulled down in 1649: rebuilt in 1660, and occupied by the\r\nDuke’s Company until their new theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields was ready\r\nfor them. It was destroyed in the Great Fire. The Duke’s Theatre in\r\nDorset Gardens, opened on November 9, 1671, stood facing the river on a\r\ndifferent site. In Salisbury Square is the headquarters of the Church\r\nMissionary Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ST. BRIDE\r\n\r\n  St. Bride’s or St. Bridget’s is another Fleet Street church. It\r\n  derives its name from St. Bridget, a saint of the seventh century.\r\n  No mention of the church has been discovered earlier than 1222. It\r\n  was destroyed by the Great Fire and rebuilt in 1680 by Wren; the\r\n  steeple, one of his greatest achievements, was added in 1701. This\r\n  has been struck several times by lightning, and in 1764 part of it\r\n  was taken down and lowered by 8 feet. The earliest date of an\r\n  incumbent is 1306.\r\n\r\n  The patronage of the church was in the hands of: The Abbot and\r\n  Convent of Westminster as a rectory from 1306 up to 1507, when a\r\n  vicarage was ordained in the same patronage; Dean and Chapter of\r\n  Westminster, in whose successors it continues, since 1573.\r\n\r\n  Houseling people in 1548 were 1400.\r\n\r\n  The interior of this church is considered to be one of the best\r\n  specimens of Wren’s work. It is entered by a porch within the tower,\r\n  and is divided into a nave and aisles by an arcade of doubled\r\n  columns on both sides. The length of the church is 111 feet, its\r\n  breadth 57 feet, and its height, to the roof of the nave, 41 feet.\r\n  The height of the tower to the top of the parapet is 120 feet, above\r\n  which the spire rises in four octagonal stories, surmounted by an\r\n  obelisk and vane. There are vases at the corners of the parapet,\r\n  introduced to soften the transitions. St. Bride’s Avenue, designed\r\n  by J. B. Papworth in 1825, affords an open view of this steeple,\r\n  before obstructed by intervening houses.\r\n\r\n  The only relics of the old church which now survive are a font in\r\n  the west part of the middle aisle, and outside, on the north, the\r\n  entry stone to the vault of the Holdens, dated 1657.\r\n\r\n  Chantries were founded here: For William de Evesham, John de Uggeley\r\n  and Lettice his wife, at the Altar of St. Katharine, of which Thomas\r\n  de Weston was chaplain in 1564—the endowment fetched £6 : 10s. in\r\n  1548; by Nicholas Sporinge, citizen of London, for himself and for\r\n  Thomas Bryx and Elene his wife at the Altar of St. John Baptist, of\r\n  which Ralph Archer was chaplain (d. 1383); for John de Merlawe in\r\n  1315; by John Ulstrape, whose endowment fetched £10 : 13 : 4 in\r\n  1549, when Robert Walker was chaplain; by John Wigan and John Hill\r\n  whose endowments yielded £15 : 14 : 8 in 1548; by Simon atte Nax,\r\n  whose endowment fetched £15 : 14 : 4 in 1548 when John Matthew and\r\n  Philip Dey were chaplains. Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Sarum,\r\n  Walter Devereux, Miles, Lord of Ferrers, and Master Alexander Leigh\r\n  had licence to found a guild here, May 26, 1475.\r\n\r\n  This church contains many interesting monuments, and is especially\r\n  rich in memories of the poets. The Rev. John Pridden, a zealous\r\n  antiquary, who died in 1825, is commemorated by a tablet on the\r\n  north wall; here, too, a brass plate has been placed to the memory\r\n  of John Nichols, author of _The History and Antiquities of the\r\n  County of Leicester_ and other works. Wynkyn de Worde, the\r\n  sixteenth-century printer, was buried in this church; also Sir\r\n  Richard Baker, author of the _Chronicle of the Kings of England_;\r\n  and also, perhaps, Richard Lovelace, the cavalier poet. Samuel\r\n  Richardson, the novelist, who died in 1761, was interred in the\r\n  middle aisle. In the vestry-room there is a portrait of the Rev.\r\n  Thomas Dale, a former vicar (see below). Milton is recorded to have\r\n  taken up his abode for a short time in lodgings in St. Bride’s\r\n  Churchyard on his return from his travels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FLEET DITCH, WEST STREET, SMITHFIELD, AS IT WAS IN 1844\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Only two benefactors’ names are recorded by Stow—Robert Lewis, who\r\n  gave £30 per annum for coals for the poor, and Robert Dove, £50 for\r\n  a bell to warn prisoners of their approaching death.\r\n\r\n  There was one charity school for fifty boys and fifty girls, who\r\n  were clothed, taught, and apprenticed by voluntary subscriptions,\r\n  added to a yearly collection at the church door.\r\n\r\n  John Taylor or Cardmaker was vicar here; he was burnt at Smithfield\r\n  for heresy, May 30, 1555. Also Richard Bundy, D.D. (d. 1739),\r\n  Prebendary of Westminster; John Thomas (1712-93), Bishop of\r\n  Rochester; Thomas Dale (1797-1870), Dean of Rochester.\r\n\r\nThe =Fleet River=, which gave its name to all this district, was\r\nanciently known as Turnmill Brooke or the River of Wells, under which\r\nname Stow speaks of it. He says that in 1307, at a parliament held at\r\nCarlisle, Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, complained of the “decay” of this\r\nriver, for “whereas in times past the course of water running at London,\r\nunder Oldbourne Bridge, and Fleet Bridge into the Thames had been of\r\nsuch breadth and depth that 10 or 12 ships, navies, at once with\r\nmerchandizes, were wont to come to the foresaid Bridge of Fleet, and\r\nsome of them to Oldbourne Bridge, now the same course by filth of the\r\ntanners and such others, was sore decayed.” He also complained of the\r\ndiversion of the water by mills of the Templars at Baynard’s Castle.\r\nAfter this the river was cleansed and the mills removed, but the old\r\ndepth was never restored so that the river became a mere brook and was\r\ncalled Turnmill Brook. The Fleet Bridge, connecting Fleet Street with\r\nLudgate Hill, was destroyed in the Great Fire and another built which\r\nwas removed in 1765.\r\n\r\nFleet Ditch became very dirty and proved a nuisance; it is several times\r\nreferred to in no complimentary terms in the _Trivia_ and the _Dunciad_.\r\nPart of it was arched over and the Fleet Market held here. In 1765, the\r\nThames end was arched over at the building of Blackfriars Bridge. Since\r\n1841, the whole has been covered in and now runs underground as a sewer;\r\nits course is marked by Farringdon Street and New Bridge Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE ANCIENT SCHOOLS IN THE CITY OF LONDON\r\n\r\n                            By A. F. LEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of schools in London, like the history of schools in England\r\nand mediæval Europe at large, necessarily begins with the history of its\r\ngreat churches. Throughout England until the Reformation, and, in theory\r\nat all events, until the Revolution, schools were ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions, and education was a matter of purely ecclesiastical\r\ncognizance. The Ordinary, that is, the judge of the Ecclesiastical Court\r\nof first instance, had everywhere cognizance of all matters in dispute\r\nwhich concerned schools and scholars, their internal discipline and\r\ntheir relations to the external world. It could and did settle the\r\nquestion of school supply, how many schools there should be, and where.\r\n\r\nIf we want to know, therefore, what were the earliest and chief schools\r\nof London, we have only to ask, What were the earliest and chief\r\nchurches of London? When we say churches, we must be careful to remember\r\nthat the word churches for such purpose means churches of the secular\r\nclergy; that is, college and parish churches, not those of monasteries\r\nand religious orders. We must be careful not to confuse the two, and not\r\nto talk of St. Paul’s Cathedral Church as conventual, or of St.\r\nMartin’s-le-Grand Collegiate Church as a monastery. To do so is\r\nprecisely like confusing New College, Oxford, with a Jesuit seminary, or\r\nTrinity, Cambridge, with a Salvation Army barracks.\r\n\r\nThe chief secular churches of London were, first and foremost, St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral; next, the great Collegiate Church of St.\r\nMartin’s-le-Grand, now, alas! swallowed up by the General Post Office;\r\nand third, the Church of St. Mary-le-Bow, the London church of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the seat of his supreme ecclesiastical court,\r\nwhich has given its name to the Court of Arches, and was his “peculiar”\r\nproperty, exempt from the jurisdiction of the Ordinary, the Bishop of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn these three churches, some of the earliest extant documents of St.\r\nPaul’s reveal the existence of grammar schools, which were already old\r\nin the year 1138. These three schools, and they alone, constituted the\r\nwhole of the public provision for education in London until the year\r\n1441, when another grammar school was established in St. Antony’s\r\nHospital. Some other schools were afterwards founded in connection with\r\nother churches before the Reformation. But while its earlier and its\r\nlater pre-Reformation rivals have all disappeared, the earliest and\r\ngreatest of all, the grammar school of the Cathedral Church of St.\r\nPaul’s, London, commonly called St. Paul’s School, with its unbroken\r\npedigree of 800 years and upwards still ranks among the chief schools of\r\nthe country, and holds as marked a position of pre-eminence in the\r\ngreater London of 1900 as it did in the old narrow city of London in\r\n1100.\r\n\r\nThe story of London schools should, then, be simplicity itself; the more\r\nso as it suffers from a lack of material. Yet it has been so obscured\r\nand complicated by successive writers that it has been converted into a\r\ntangled and twisted texture of guesses and fables, which we must\r\nendeavour to unravel.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to have been so. For, earlier probably than any other city\r\nin Europe, except York, London found its _vates sacer_, who for the\r\nadmiration of his own and the information of later ages, sung the\r\nglories of its schools and scholars, their studies and their sports.\r\nAlcuin’s ninth-century poem[38] in Latin hexameters “On the Archbishops\r\nand Saints of the Church of York,” giving a vivid account of St. Peter’s\r\nSchool there, of which he was himself master in the third quarter of the\r\neighth century, is the earliest account we have of any English school.\r\nThe picture, drawn in poetic Latin prose of the twelfth century by “the\r\nson of Stephen,” of London schools and scholars, as they were during the\r\nboyhood of Becket, is not less full or vivid. One almost suspects from\r\nthe way in which quotations from Latin poets are lugged in “by the\r\nhairs” that Fitzstephen was himself at one time a schoolmaster, before\r\nhe became Becket’s chancellor and ended as a judge. At all events, he\r\ntook a keen interest in schools and schoolboys, and devoted a good third\r\nof his famous description of London to the games and sports of the\r\nLondon schoolboy.\r\n\r\n  “In London,”[39] he says, “the three principal churches have famous\r\n  schools privileged and of ancient pre-eminence, though sometimes\r\n  through personal favour to some one noted as a philosopher more\r\n  schools are allowed. On feast days the masters celebrate assemblies\r\n  at the churches, arrayed in festive garb. The scholars hold\r\n  disputations, some augmentatively, others by way of question and\r\n  answer. These roll out enthymemes, those use the forms of perfect\r\n  syllogisms. Some dispute merely for show, as they do at\r\n  collections;[40] others for the truth which is the grace of\r\n  perfection. The sophists and pretenders are pronounced happy because\r\n  of the mass and volume of their words; others play upon words. The\r\n  rhetoricians with rhetorical speeches speak to the point with a view\r\n  to persuasion, being careful to observe the precepts of their art,\r\n  and to leave out nothing that belongs to it.\r\n\r\n  “The boys of the different schools hold contests in verse, or pose\r\n  each other on the principles of grammar or the rules of preterites\r\n  and supines. Others in epigrams, rhymes and metres use the old\r\n  street eloquence, with Fescinnine licence scourging their\r\n  schoolfellows, without mentioning names; hurling abusive epithets\r\n  and scoffs at them: with Socratic salt girding at the failings of\r\n  their fellows, or perhaps of their elders; and in bold dithyrambics\r\n  biting them with the sharp tooth of Theon. The audience\r\n\r\n                                 ready to laugh\r\n          With crincled noses redouble their shrill guffaws.”\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this passage states as plainly as can be that there\r\nwere schools attached to the three principal churches, that they were\r\nancient even then, and privileged. By privileged is meant, not as Lord\r\nLyttelton[41] in his _Henry II._ interprets it, that “by particular\r\nprivilege was taught not only grammar, but poetry, rhetorick and\r\nlogick”; but, as the context shows, that these schools were the only\r\nschools allowed at all, though occasionally a special schoolmaster was\r\nallowed on sufferance and by personal favour. Stow, who was the first to\r\nquote this passage, went on[42] to identify the three schools. The\r\nfirst, he supposed rightly, was St. Paul’s. But for the second he puts\r\n“S. Peter’s at Westminster,” and supports it by a quotation from\r\nIngulphus’ _Chronicle_, now admitted on all hands to be a\r\nfifteenth-century forgery. The third, says Stow, “seemeth to have been\r\nin the monastery of St. Saviour at Bermondsey in Southwark. For other\r\npriories, as of St. John by Smithfield, St. Bartholomew in Smithfield,\r\nSt. Mary Overies in Southwark, and that of the Holy Trinity in Aldgate,\r\nwere all of later foundation.”\r\n\r\nThis is a curious conglomeration of errors: which has unfortunately been\r\nblindly adopted by subsequent writers. Even if there had been a grammar\r\nschool at Westminster, it could not possibly be described in the twelfth\r\ncentury as being in London, since Fitzstephen himself speaks of\r\nWestminster as being two miles off. The placing of a London school at\r\nSt. Saviour’s, Bermondsey, is even more open to the same objection of\r\nnot being in London.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question from what MS. of Fitzstephen Stow derived\r\nhis knowledge of this passage about schools. Out of four ancient MSS.\r\nnow extant, only one, and that the latest, contains the passage. These\r\nMSS. are: (i.) MS. Lambeth 138 (wrongly referred to as 1168 in the Rolls\r\nedition of Fitzstephen). This is of the thirteenth century and has not\r\nthe Description of London at all. (ii.) MS. Douce 289 at the Bodleian.\r\nThis is also of the thirteenth century. It has the Description of\r\nLondon, but having lost its first leaf has only the last few words about\r\nschools, (iii.) MS. Cotton, Julius, A, xi., at the British Museum. This\r\nis of the early fourteenth century and has not got the Description at\r\nall. (iv.) Lansdowne MS. 398, late in the fifteenth century. This is the\r\nonly MS. which has the Description of London and its schools in full,\r\nand it does not mention the churches which kept them. On the other hand,\r\nthe Description of London, apart from the Life, is written at the\r\nbeginning of the _Liber Custumarum_ of the City of London, now in the\r\nGuildhall, a MS. of the first half of the fourteenth century. It\r\ncontains the passage about the schools and after the word churches\r\ninserts “viz. the Bishop’s see, the church of St. Paul’s, the church of\r\nHoly Trinity and the church of St. Martin.” Mr. Riley, in his edition of\r\nthe _Liber Custumarum_, thinks that Stow had this book before him. But\r\nthe omission by Stow of the names of the three churches, and his bad\r\nguess as to what the churches were, seem to show conclusively that the\r\nGuildhall MS. was unknown to him, unless he garbled it for the sake of\r\navoiding a difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Stow says that Trinity Priory was not founded till\r\nafter the time of which Fitzstephen was writing. In this he was\r\nmistaken. The Priory purports in its chartulary[43] to have been founded\r\nby “good Queen Mold,” the wife of Henry I., in 1108, and its most\r\ninteresting endowment, the Portsoken, the land of the English Knights’\r\nGild outside Aldgate, in virtue of which the Prior of Christchurch, or\r\nCreechurch, as it was nicknamed, was _ex officio_ an Alderman of the\r\nCity of London, was given in 1125. There does not, however, seem to be\r\nany mention of a school in connection with the church before or after\r\nthe foundation of the Priory either in its chartulary, or elsewhere.[44]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have testimony contemporary with the time of which\r\nFitzstephen was writing, and many subsequent references, extending up to\r\nthe time of Henry VIII., which show conclusively that the three churches\r\nwith schools were St. Paul’s, St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and St.\r\nMary-le-Bow, and that they preserved their monopoly till the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century. There was therefore no room for any recognised\r\nschool in, or connected with, Trinity Church. Three explanations appear\r\nto be possible. (i.) There was a school in Trinity Church while it was a\r\nsecular church, belonging to the College Church of the Holy Cross,\r\nWaltham, which ceased on its being converted into a Priory. (ii.) There\r\nwas an adulterine or unlicensed school there, put down by the very\r\ndocument which conveys the contemporary testimony as to what the\r\nlegitimate and privileged schools were. But more probably (iii.) the\r\nwords are an interpolation due to a gloss by some badly-informed\r\ncommentator.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing is that in the very passage quoted, Stow cites, though\r\ninaccurately, a patent of Henry VI. by which, as we shall see, authority\r\nwas given for the erection of certain schools, besides those at St.\r\nPaul’s, at St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and St. Mary-le-Bow in Cheap. It is\r\nrather strange that Stow did not know of the famous document at St.\r\nPaul’s, which tells us plainly what these three ancient and famous\r\nschools were. But then he had not the advantage we enjoy of Sir Henry\r\nMaxwell-Lyte’s admirable Calendar of the St. Paul’s Muniments.[45] The\r\none in question runs thus:\r\n\r\n  Henry, by the Grace of God, minister of the church of Winchester, to\r\n  the Chapter of St. Paul’s and William, Archdeacon, and their\r\n  officers, greeting.\r\n\r\n  I command you by your obedience that after three summonses, you\r\n  launch the sentence of excommunication against those who, without a\r\n  license from Henry, the Schoolmaster, presume to teach (anywhere) in\r\n  the whole city of London; except those who teach the schools of St.\r\n  Mary of the Arch and St. Martin’s the Great. Witness, Hilarius, at\r\n  Winchester.\r\n\r\nIt is at first sight mysterious that Henry of Blois, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, should, even though he was King Stephen’s brother, thus\r\ninterfere in the affairs of another diocese. The explanation is that he\r\nwas in fact acting as Bishop of London at that time, holding the See\r\nduring its vacancy _in commendam_, or in charge. This fact enables us to\r\nfix the date. It must lie between 1138, when, according to the\r\nchronicler, Ralph de Diceto,[46] who was Dean of St. Paul’s, “the Pope\r\nwith the King’s consent, committed the care of the church of London to\r\nHenry, Bishop of Winchester,” and 1140, when “the Empress (Matilda) was\r\nreceived by the Londoners for their lady, and she made Robert of the\r\nSeal, bishop of London.” Rival schoolmasters had no doubt taken\r\nadvantage of the relaxation of discipline during the prolonged vacancy\r\nof the See, consequent on the Pope’s setting aside the election of the\r\nAbbot of St. Edmund’s Bury to it, to set up “adulterine” or unlicensed\r\nschools. When the See was placed under a strong guardian, the arm of the\r\nchurch was stretched out to defend the monopoly of its children.\r\n\r\nBut the injunction against rival schools was not, as has been\r\nrepresented by Dugdale,[47] any special favour to Henry the schoolmaster\r\nof St. Paul’s. It was merely in accordance with the common law of the\r\nchurch. We find precisely the same kind of proceeding going on at\r\nWinchester itself[48] at about the same time, and again as late as 1629;\r\nwhile copious instances of its use are to be found at Canterbury in the\r\nfourteenth, and at York and Beverley[49] in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nMaster Henry had been appointed schoolmaster by Richard Belmeis, Bishop\r\nof London, and his appointment is still extant among the archives of St.\r\nPaul’s, not only in a chartulary copy but in the actual original itself.\r\nAs it is probably the oldest instrument of its kind in England, it is\r\ngiven in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COLLATION OF THE SCHOOL[50]\r\n\r\n  Richard, by the Grace of God, Bishop of London, to William, Dean,\r\n  and the whole assembly of his brethren, and to William of Oschendon\r\n  his steward, and all his men, Greeting and blessing in Christ.\r\n\r\n  I make known to you, my beloved, that I have granted to Henry, my\r\n  canon, the pupil of Master Hugh, the school of St. Paul’s, as\r\n  honourably as the church in best and most honourable wise ever held\r\n  it, and the land of the court (_atrio_) which the aforesaid Hugh\r\n  enclosed there to house himself in; and the meadow which I had\r\n  granted to the same Hugh in Fulham, 4 acres; namely, the whole land\r\n  from the ditch to the Thames (he paying) 12d. a year by way of\r\n  acknowledgment at Michaelmas; and, in alms, the tithes of Ealing and\r\n  the tithes of Madeley.\r\n\r\n  Witnesses, William of Winchester, William of Occhenden, steward, and\r\n  Hugh de Cancerisio.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of this and a previous document, Bishop Stubbs\r\nspeaks[51] of Bishop Richard de Belmeis, de Bello Manso (or Fairhouse),\r\nas having “founded” the “schools” (_sic_) “of St. Paul’s.” The previous\r\ndocument is only preserved in a copy in the early chartulary called\r\nLiber A. It is addressed to W. Dean and the whole assembly of canons\r\n(_fratrum conventui_) and informs the bishop’s “best beloved sons” that\r\nhe has “confirmed (_stabilisse_) to Hugh the Schoolmaster, _ex officio_\r\nas Master, and to his successors in that dignity, the place of Mr.\r\nDurand in the corner of the Tower, where Dean William placed him by my\r\norders between Robert de Auco and Odo.” The Bishop then proceeds, “I\r\ngrant to him and to the privilege of the school the custody of all the\r\nbooks of my church,” and orders the dean to have a list of the books\r\nmade out in an indenture, one part of which is to be placed in the\r\ntreasury, the other to be kept by the schoolmaster, who is to be given\r\nseisin of the books; while any books that have been lent out, whether\r\ntheological (_divinorum_) or of secular learning, are to be returned, on\r\npain of excommunication. Hugh was also “to have the keys of the\r\ncupboards” (_armariorum_, aumbreys as they are now somewhat affectedly\r\ncalled) “which I ordered to be made for the purpose.”\r\n\r\nAs no witnesses are recorded, the date of this cannot be fixed, except\r\nas being between 1111, when William became Dean, and 1127, when Bishop\r\nRichard died. It must, of course, be before the document appointing\r\nHenry as schoolmaster in succession to this same Hugh.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two documents supports Bishop Stubbs’ statement that\r\nBishop Richard “founded” the “schools” of St. Paul’s. It is odd that the\r\nBishop should have fallen into this mistake, as Dugdale[52] described\r\nthe documents quite accurately, as grants to the Schoolmaster of St.\r\nPaul’s. Both of the grants imply that the schoolmaster’s office or\r\n“dignity” was in existence before. The later document is, of course, as\r\nit is called, merely a collation; an appointment of a new master, Henry,\r\nwho had himself been a scholar in the school, to succeed a deceased\r\nmaster, Hugh. The earlier one merely confirms, not grants, to an\r\nexisting officer or dignitary of the cathedral the residence he already\r\nenjoyed, at the same time annexing that particular residence to the\r\noffice, while giving him the apparently[53] new duty of taking care of\r\nthe books belonging to the church. The title of Master applied to Durand\r\nsuggests that he too had been schoolmaster before Hugh, and lived in the\r\nsame house as Hugh did, but that the house, then only an ordinary\r\nprebendal house, was now definitely made the schoolmaster’s official\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly unfortunate that Bishop Stubbs should also have been\r\nmisled by the plural form used in the original for a school into\r\nmisunderstanding the mention of the school of St. Paul’s for a reference\r\nto schools, meaning more than one. There has been no more prolific\r\nsource of misrepresentation as to the whole status and history of\r\nmediæval schools than this misunderstanding. Yet it is beyond doubt that\r\nuntil the middle of the fifteenth century the word school was habitually\r\nnot _scola_ but _scolæ_.[54] The official title of a grammar\r\nschoolmaster was not _Magister Scole Gramatices_ or _Gramaticalis_ but\r\n_Magister Scolarum Gramaticalium_. He was schoolsmaster not\r\nschoolmaster. This was the style almost universally used in official and\r\nformal documents up to the reign of Edward VI. In less formal documents,\r\nsuch as Account Rolls and the like, the singular form began to oust the\r\nplural as nearly as possible in the year 1450. Before that time, though\r\nthere are occasional uses of the word in the singular, the normal use\r\nwas in the plural. A few references to original documents will be enough\r\nto show the identity of meaning of the singular and plural forms. Thus,\r\nin an inquiry as to St. Cross Hospital near Winchester in 1373,[55] when\r\nevidence was given that among the 100 poor fed every day in the\r\nHundredmen’s Hall, there were 13 poor scholars sent from the Grammar\r\nSchool of Winchester; some witnesses call them “poorer scholars of the\r\ngrammar school (_scole gramaticalis_) of the city of Winchester,” and\r\nothers, “poor scholars from the grammar school (_scolis gramaticalibus_)\r\nthere,” the school being called indifferently the grammar school and the\r\nhigh school of the city of Winchester. Again in the Winchester College\r\nAccount Roll for 1394, the head-master of the college grammar school,\r\nwhich was not the same as the City grammar school, is called both\r\n_Magister Scolis_ and _Magister Scole_. This evidence is the more\r\nclinching as it is rare at that date to find the word school in the\r\nsingular at all. Indeed, except at Winchester and London, as will be\r\nseen presently, where there seems to have been a higher standard of\r\nclassical accuracy, I do not know of another instance of the word school\r\nin the singular in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe clearing up of this point is important, as the plural use has made\r\npeople[56] search for two or more schools, and in consequence has led\r\nthem to confound two entirely different schools, the Grammar School for\r\nthe world at large, and the Song School chiefly, if not exclusively, for\r\nthe choristers; and, in consequence, to maintain that the mediæval\r\ngrammar schools were poor starved things, where a dozen choristers at\r\nmost stumbled through their declensions and their psalter.\r\n\r\nThe documents of Richard de Belmeis then are not the foundation of St.\r\nPaul’s School. On the contrary, they point to it as previously existing,\r\nand to the schoolmaster as already one of the dignitaries or principal\r\npersons of the chapter. The true date of foundation and the real founder\r\nof St. Paul’s School must be sought in the foundation and founder of St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral Church itself. The first foundation was in 604,\r\nwhen[57]\r\n\r\n  Augustine, Archbishop of the Britains, ordained two Bishops,\r\n  Mellitus and Justus: Mellitus to preach to the province of Essex,\r\n  separated from Kent by the river Thames, and close to the Eastern\r\n  sea, whose metropolis is London city placed on the banks of the said\r\n  river, an emporium for many nations, coming by land and sea; whose\r\n  king then was Saberet (or Sebert) nephew of Ethelbert by his sister\r\n  Ricula, though placed under the power of Ethelbert, who then ruled\r\n  all the English race up to the Humber. When the province received\r\n  the word of truth on the preaching of Mellitus, King Ethelbert made\r\n  in the city of London the church of St. Paul the Apostle, in which\r\n  he and his successors had their bishop’s See.\r\n\r\nAfter Ethelbert and Sebert died in 616[58] there was a reaction to the\r\nold religion, and Mellitus fled abroad. When he tried to return, after\r\nthe conversion of Ethelbert’s successor in Kent, London would not have\r\nhim. It remained heathen till Oswi, King of the Northumbrians, converted\r\nSigebert, a refugee prince, who, on returning home, made Cedd bishop of\r\nthe East Saxons. But no mention is made of London as his See, and\r\nTilbury[59] rather appears to have been his principal church. He died of\r\nthe plague in 664. Wine,[60] expelled from Winchester, bought the See of\r\nLondon from Wulfhere, King of the Mercians, somewhere about 666.\r\nThenceforward the history of the See and church is unbroken. It is only\r\ntherefore from this last date that we can reckon the continuous history\r\nof St. Paul’s Cathedral or its school. There is no direct reference to\r\nthe school in Bede, as there is to that of Canterbury, when the King of\r\nthe East Angles got schoolmasters thence in 631. But the place[61] where\r\nlived the learned Nothelm, Bede’s principal informant as to the history\r\nof southern England, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and Erkenwald\r\nor Earconwald, bishop from 675 to 692, whose name and fame in later\r\nages, as the local saint of London, completely eclipsed that of St. Paul\r\nhimself, much as St. Swithin did that of St. Peter at Winchester, can\r\nhardly have failed to maintain a school, any more than Canterbury or\r\nYork or Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe original statutes of St. Paul’s Cathedral have not survived. The\r\nearliest statute affecting the school appears in a collection made\r\nduring the deanery of Henry of Cornhill,[62] 1243 to 1254, who had been\r\nChancellor of St. Paul’s from 1217 till he became Dean. It is a statute\r\nrelating to the duties of the Chancellor. When present, it is said,\r\n\r\n  the Chancellor makes out the table (_tabulam_) of lessons, masses,\r\n  Epistles, Gospels, acolytes, and performers of the service in course\r\n  for a week (_ebdomadariis_) and hears the lessons [_i.e._ the reader\r\n  has to read them over to him beforehand to see that he reads them\r\n  correctly]. On feast days he hears the Bishop read, hands him the\r\n  book to be read from at the beginning of mattins; and, clothed in a\r\n  silk cope, holds the book for the Bishop to read at the last of the\r\n  [nine] lessons. [The Chancellor himself, a later statute informs us,\r\n  read the 6th lesson.] He introduces the clerks of lower grade to be\r\n  ordained, and after examining them in school presents them to the\r\n  Bishop for ordination, and administers justice to every one who\r\n  makes any complaint as to their conduct. All scholars living in the\r\n  city are under him, except those of a school of the Arches, and a\r\n  school in the Basilica of St. Martin’s the Great, who claim that\r\n  they are privileged in these and other matters. The Chancellor also\r\n  keeps the chest with the school books in it.\r\n\r\nThe reference to a school (_unam scolam_) in St. Mary-le-Bow and St.\r\nMartin’s respectively, may be compared with the plural for the same\r\nschools in the writ of Bishop Henry of Blois.\r\n\r\nIn the digest of the statutes of St. Paul’s made during the deanery of\r\nRalph of Baldock, 1294-1304, the words as to the Chancellor’s supremacy\r\nover the schools are repeated almost verbatim; but the plural form\r\n_scolarum_ is used instead of the singular for the single schools at St.\r\nMartin’s and St. Mary-le-Bow respectively. This is pretty conclusive\r\ntestimony of the identity in meaning of plural and singular for a single\r\nschool. In this latter digest we find further details about the\r\nchancellor and a special statute, headed, “of the appointment of an M.A.\r\nto the Grammar School (_scolæ grammaticæ_).” The body of the statute is\r\npart of the statute as to the chancellor. It says:\r\n\r\n  The Chancellor appoints a master of arts to the Grammar School\r\n  (_scolis_) and is bound to keep the school itself (_scolas ipsas_)\r\n  in repair. He composes the letters and deeds of the Chapter. He\r\n  reads whatever has to be read in Chapter. He is the chief keeper of\r\n  the seal, and receives a pound of pepper for every deed that is\r\n  sealed or renewed, the Chapter receiving 3s.\r\n\r\n“If the Dean has to be ordained”—we may remember that William of Wykeham\r\nwas Dean of St. Martin’s-le-Grand when still only an acolyte, and\r\nReginald Pole, though a cardinal and an ex-dean, was not a priest till\r\nthe day before he became Archbishop of Canterbury—“the Chancellor calls\r\nhim by the title of St. Paul’s.”\r\n\r\nThe chancellor is\r\n\r\n  the chief keeper of the school books in the chest, and ought to show\r\n  them once a year to the Dean and others appointed for the purpose,\r\n  and a copy of the list of them is to be kept by the Dean, the\r\n  Chancellor and a third brother [_i.e._ canon] appointed for the\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, of course, though not perhaps very probable, that there\r\nwere no written statutes of St. Paul’s affecting the school earlier than\r\nthose quoted. Whether there were written statutes or not, the writs of\r\nBishop Richard prove the schoolmaster’s office to have been in existence\r\nat least 150 years before this earliest written statute. But we might\r\nhave positively asserted that there was such an officer if those writs\r\nhad not existed, because the maintenance of a schoolmaster was part of\r\nthe customary constitution of cathedral churches. Alcuin’s\r\ndescription[63] of the duties of himself and his predecessor, Ethelbert\r\nor Albert, afterwards archbishop, as schoolmaster at York in the eighth\r\ncentury, shows a schoolmaster fulfilling precisely the same mixture of\r\nlegal, clerkly, and educational duties which appear in the famous\r\nInstitution of St. Osmund at Salisbury in the eleventh and the statutes\r\nof St. Paul’s in the thirteenth century. As early as 832 a definite\r\nconciliar decree embodied in the written canon law the obligation,\r\nalready crystallised into custom, that every cathedral church should\r\nmaintain a school.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Harold[64] founded, or rather augmented, in 1060 the\r\ncollegiate church of secular canons of the Holy Cross of Waltham with a\r\ndean and twelve canons, the principal person next to the provost or\r\ndean, as he is indifferently called, was the schoolmaster. The history\r\nof the foundation was written for us by one who was made a canon before\r\n1144, having been “from tender years brought up in the church and taught\r\nLatin in its bosom.”[65] He was one of those who were turned out in\r\n1177, when, with vicarious liberality, Henry II. converted the college\r\ninto a priory of regular or Augustinian canons, in satisfaction of his\r\nvow to found a monastery in expiation of Becket’s death. This canon\r\ntells us[66] how Harold having heard that the Dutch was the best model,\r\nimported Master Athelard, a native of Liege, who had been educated at\r\nUtrecht, to assist Wulfwin the Dean in settling the constitution of the\r\nchurch. Our author himself, who does not give his name, says that his\r\nmaster[67] was “Master Peter, son of Master Athelard.” For the secular\r\ncanons were, like their modern successors, allowed to marry, and this\r\nwas the real reason why the favourers of monkery charged them with evil\r\nliving. He tells us how\r\n\r\n  a copious stream of learning flowed from this Peter after the\r\n  fashion of the Dutch (_Teutonicorum_) and yet the lessons and\r\n  classics and verse composition in no way lessened the practice of\r\n  singing in the churches. So far from boyish habits were they, that\r\n  they walked in procession, stood, read and sang, with as much\r\n  gravity as if they had been monks; and chanted and sang by heart\r\n  solos or in duets or trios, without book whatever had to be sung at\r\n  the steps of the choir or in the choir itself.... As they came in\r\n  procession, like canons getting up to mid-night matins, from school\r\n  to choir, so when leaving choir they go to school.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we see that a school, a grammar school, was regarded as an\r\nintegral and necessary, and a most important part of the foundation of a\r\ncollegiate church before the Conquest.\r\n\r\nSimilar evidence comes from another collegiate church of pre-Conquest\r\nfoundation, that of St. Mary, Warwick. This church, situate in the\r\nmiddle of the town, is recorded in Domesday Book as possessing a hide of\r\nland. There was also a collegiate church of All Saints, a kind of\r\ngarrison chapel, in the castle, the stronghold founded by Ethelfled, the\r\nLady of the Mercians, against the Danes in 916, but which after the date\r\nof Domesday Book passed into the hands of one of the Norman invaders.\r\nForty years after Domesday Book, in 1123, disputes having arisen between\r\nthe two churches, the second Norman lord, Roger de Beaumont, confirmed\r\nto these two churches all their respective property as they held it in\r\nhis father’s time. Then by a separate deed he confirmed “in alms,”\r\n_i.e._ in perpetuity free from feudal service, “to the church of St.\r\nMary of Warwick the school (_scolas_) of the said church, that the\r\nservice of God in the same may be improved by the attendance of\r\nscholars.” By a similar deed he must have confirmed All Saints in its\r\nschool, as a writ of King Henry I. addressed to this Earl Roger and the\r\necclesiastical lords, the Bishops of Worcester and Chester, directs\r\n“that the Church of All Saints, Warwick, shall have all its customs and\r\njudgments of iron and water (_i.e._ the right of administering the\r\nordeal) as they did in the time of Edward, and in like manner shall have\r\nits school (_scolas_).” A few years later the two collegiate churches\r\nwere consolidated, the canons of All Saints being transferred from the\r\ncastle, their residence there “being inconvenient,” and the property of\r\nthe united church of St. Mary and All Saints was confirmed to it first\r\nby the Earl, then by the Bishop, including “the school of Warwick and\r\ntrial of iron, water and duel.” So here again the school, and the right\r\nto keep it, is regarded as one of the most important attributes of a\r\npre-Conquest collegiate church.\r\n\r\nThe statutes made on the new foundation of Salisbury Cathedral within\r\ntwenty-five years of the Norman Conquest are preserved. They are not\r\nindeed in a contemporary document, but written in a thirteenth-century\r\nhand in a new version of these statutes made on the removal of the\r\ncathedral from Old Sarum to the present Salisbury in 1220. There seems\r\nno reason to doubt their authenticity.\r\n\r\n  These are the dignities and customs of the church of Salisbury which\r\n  I, Osmund, bishop of the same church, in the name of the Holy\r\n  Trinity, in the year 1091, have instituted and granted to the\r\n  persons and canons of the same, with the advice of the Archbishop\r\n  and the assent of King William.\r\n\r\n  The Dean and Chanter (Precentor), Chancellor and Treasurer shall be\r\n  always resident in the church of Salisbury, without any kind of\r\n  excuse....\r\n\r\n  The chanter ought to teach the choir as to singing and can raise or\r\n  lower the chant.\r\n\r\n  The Treasurer is chief in the custody of the treasures and ornaments\r\n  and the giving out of lights.\r\n\r\n  In like manner the Chancellor (_cancellarius_) (is chief) in\r\n  teaching school and correcting the books.\r\n\r\n  Dean and Chapter, Treasurer and Chancellor have double commons, the\r\n  rest of the Canons single commons.\r\n\r\n  The Sub-Dean holds under the Dean the archdeaconry of the city and\r\n  suburbs, the Succentor under the Precentor that which belongs to the\r\n  choir (_cantariam_).\r\n\r\n  If the Dean fails, the Sub-Dean fills his place, so the Succentor\r\n  has the Precentor’s.\r\n\r\n  The Schoolmaster (_archischola_) ought to hear the lessons and\r\n  determine on them, carry the seal of the church, compose letters and\r\n  deeds, and mark readers on the list, and the Precentor in like\r\n  manner the singers.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find four principal persons, of whom one, the chancellor,\r\nis also called schoolmaster. He is the legal and educational, while the\r\nchanter or precentor is the musical officer of the chapter. In the\r\nfourteenth century copy of the statutes of York Minster it is said of\r\nthe chancellor that he “was anciently called Schoolmaster”; and the\r\ntwelfth-century historian of the Minster, a contemporary of Bishop\r\nRichard of Belmeis, describes how Thomas of Bayeux, the first Norman\r\narchbishop there, had just established or (as we may infer)\r\nre-established a provost and schoolmaster; but afterwards, about 1090,\r\nestablished that which afterwards became the regular cathedral\r\n“foursquare” constitution of dean (instead of provost), precentor,\r\ntreasurer, and chancellor.\r\n\r\nIn the oft-quoted Liber A at St. Paul’s, written in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the copies of the writs of Bishop Richard of Belmeis and Henry\r\nof Blois, with some later documents, are headed “Of the Schoolmaster\r\n(_De Magistro Scolarum_) and Chancellor, seven letters”: and a marginal\r\nnote to a later document of Bishop Richard Fitz Neal (1189-99),\r\nincreasing the endowment of the schoolmaster, runs, “Note—the tithes\r\ngiven to the Schoolmaster of St. Paul’s, now the Chancellor.”\r\n\r\nThe analogy, therefore, of other cathedral and collegiate churches,\r\ncorroborated as they are by the records of St. Paul’s itself, the\r\nknowledge that we have of the existence of schools, not only at great\r\ncapitals like Canterbury, Winchester, and York, but even at small places\r\nlike Warwick and Waltham, amply justify us in asserting confidently that\r\nthe schoolmaster and school of St. Paul’s existed not merely before the\r\ndays of Bishop Richard de Belmeis, but before the Conquest, and in all\r\nreasonable probability from the days of Bishops Wine and Earconwald.\r\n\r\nWhat were these London schools? What did they teach? Lord Lyttelton[68]\r\nin his History of Henry II. spoke of them as “schools or rather\r\ncolleges,” meaning university colleges, and Sir George Buck in 1631\r\ndescribed them as the _Third Universitie of England_.[69] This was\r\nbecause of the mention of logic, and the statement that, not indeed as\r\nLyttelton says, “many” but other “schools” were occasionally opened “by\r\npersons of note in philosophy,” by special favour.\r\n\r\nBut to infer from this a University of London in the twelfth century is\r\nto transfer to it the ideas of the eighteenth century. The _Trivium_,\r\nthe “trivial task” of the twelfth century school-boy, included rhetoric\r\nand dialectic as well as grammar. Grammar meant not only grammar\r\nstrictly speaking, but the general study of classical literature.\r\nRhetoric included not only the art of persuasion, the rules of oratory,\r\nbut generally Latin composition, prose, and verse,[70] and declamation\r\nor recitation. Rhetoric was naturally incomplete without dialectic or\r\nlogic, the art of argument. So powerful during the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries did dialectic become, that not only did theology\r\nbecome almost a branch of logic but grammar itself was taught and\r\npractised “dialectically.” The “rostrum,” on which dialectic and\r\nrhetoric were practised, was to be found in the school of Winchester\r\nCollege as late as 1650.\r\n\r\nThe distinction drawn by Fitzstephen between the boys who capped verses\r\nand the other scholars who held debates in rhetoric and logic was not\r\ncoincident with that between a grammar school and a university college.\r\nThe word “boy” was used strictly, as it still was as late as the\r\nElizabethan statutes of grammar schools, for those under fourteen years\r\nof age, who were carefully distinguished on the one hand from children\r\nor infants under seven, and from youths (_juvenes_) of fourteen to\r\ntwenty-one. Then, as now, youths of eighteen and upwards were found in\r\nthe grammar schools, and William of Wykeham, and the advisers of Henry\r\nVI. in the foundation of Eton, all Wykehamists, were no innovators\r\nraising the age of schoolboys when they prescribed nineteen as the\r\nleaving age for the scholars of Winchester and Eton.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no necessary ground for the inference that the\r\nschools of London in the first half of the twelfth century bore any\r\ndifferent character from that which they had in the fifteenth or\r\nsixteenth centuries, when the same schools are described simply as\r\ngrammar schools.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the period of which Fitzstephen wrote was that of the\r\norigin of universities. It saw the birth of Bologna, of Paris, and of\r\nOxford. At Paris, the university grew out of the extension and the\r\nrivalry of the schools, the grammar schools, of the cathedral church of\r\nNotre Dame and the collegiate church, as it then was, of St. Geneviéve.\r\nAt Oxford there is every reason to believe that the university developed\r\nin like manner from the schools of the collegiate churches, as they then\r\nwere, of St. Frideswide and St. George in the Castle.[71] The\r\n“University” side of the schools finally emancipated itself, at an\r\nearlier period even than at Paris, from ordinary ecclesiastical control,\r\nthrough the conversion of these two collegiate churches into houses of\r\nregulars, and the extinction therewith of their control of secular\r\nscholars, while the Chancellor of Lincoln was too remote to exercise any\r\neffective government such as was exercised by the Chancellor of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was quite within the bounds of probability then that London also\r\nwould develop a university out of the three ancient schools, and the\r\npermitted rivalry, by special favour, of the schools of other “doctors\r\nof philosophy.” But it was not to be. London even then was too great a\r\ncommercial emporium, the prizes of successful trade were too attractive,\r\nbusiness was too absorbing, the hum of markets and wharves was too loud\r\nfor the voice of learning to make itself heard, or for schools, whether\r\nof theology or arts, to attract the pick of the intellect of the City.\r\nParis, though the political capital, was not also the commercial capital\r\nof France, where Rouen, the independent capital of a rival power,\r\noccupied, to it, the position which the Port of London bore to London.\r\nThe King’s Court and the King’s Chancery were the main avenues to\r\nsuccess for clerks, and even so late as the reign of Henry III. the\r\nCastle of Winchester and Beaumont House at Oxford, or the Manor of\r\nWindsor, rather than the Tower of London, or even Westminster Hall, were\r\nthe favourite resorts of the King’s Court, and the residence of the\r\nroyal treasury and the royal chancery. Hence London never developed an\r\nAbelard and a mainly theological university like Paris. The settlement\r\nat Westminster of the royal courts, and the superior importance in\r\nEngland of the common law to the civil law for somewhat similar reasons,\r\nprevented London from producing an Irnerius or a Gratian and giving rise\r\nto a legal university such as that of Bologna. Indeed the greater fame\r\nof Paris and Bologna universities themselves was in the cosmopolitan\r\nspirit which, under the centralising influence of the Roman Church, made\r\nlearned Europe almost a single nation, a potent obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of a university of London.\r\n\r\nNo exact definition of a university has yet been given, nor is capable\r\nof being given, and it may be doubted whether there is any university\r\nnow in existence which really corresponds to the mediæval university.\r\nBut one salient mark of a university, a number of teachers and a number\r\nof adult students in the higher faculties, in theology and law, or\r\nphilosophy, certainly existed at Paris in the days of Abelard, and to\r\nsome extent in Oxford, but did not seemingly exist in London, or if it\r\ndid exist was quenched by Henry of Blois’ mandate.\r\n\r\nIf the London schools formed a university in 1138, _a fortiori_ did the\r\nSchool of York form one in 735. In Alcuin’s description of the School of\r\nYork as it flourished under Archbishops Egbert and Albert, an even\r\ngreater multiplicity of subjects was taught than in the three schools of\r\nLondon in Fitzstephen’s day. Albert, its master,[72] “moistened thirsty\r\nhearts with diverse streams of teaching and varied dews of learning,\r\ngiving to some the science of the art of grammar, pouring on others the\r\nrivers of the tongues of orators; these he polished on the whetstone of\r\nlaw, those he taught to sing together in Æolian chant, making others\r\nplay on the flute of Castaly, and run with the feet of lyric poets over\r\nthe hills of Parnassus.” Here we get the Grammar, Song, and Rhetoric of\r\nlater days. Song had in London in 1130 already been relegated to a\r\nseparate school. At York there was taught also arithmetic and geometry,\r\nand the method of calculating the ecclesiastical calendar, the music of\r\nthe spheres, astronomy, physiography, “the rising and falling of the\r\nwind, the movements of the sea, the earth’s quake,” and natural history,\r\n“the nature of men, cattle, birds, and beasts.” Above all, Albert taught\r\ntheology. This curriculum is considerably more extensive than that of\r\nthe London schools, embracing many of what we should now regard as\r\nuniversity subjects. York afterwards branched off into three schools—the\r\nChancellor’s Theological School; the Grammar School under the\r\nChancellor’s deputy, who became the Schoolmaster par excellence; and the\r\nSong School under the precentor. Yet as we should not call York School\r\nunder Albert or Alcuin a university merely because many subjects were\r\ntaught in it, neither can we dub the London schools of the twelfth\r\ncentury a university.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore negative the claims of London to the possession of a\r\nuniversity in the first half of the twelfth century. But we can at least\r\nclaim that St. Paul’s School occupied the same position then as now, as\r\nthe chief day-school for the sons of middle-class citizens. Becket’s\r\nbiographer tells us what his education was: “Thomas spent the years of\r\ninfancy, boyhood, and youth quietly in his father’s house, and in\r\npassing through the City school (_scolis urbis_); but when he became a\r\nyoung man he went to study at Paris (_Parisius studuit_). As soon as he\r\ncame back, he was taken into public life in London, being made a clerk\r\nand accountant in the Sheriff’s office.” The true translation of _scolis\r\nurbis_ is the city school; and the city school meant the school of the\r\ncathedral church of the City, the School of London. To this school\r\nBecket, whose father had at one time been sheriff of London, was sent.\r\nAfter leaving school, Becket went, in modern parlance, to Paris\r\nUniversity before entering on professional life. He was born in 1118,\r\nso, as he may be presumed to have gone to Paris at about eighteen or\r\nnineteen years of age, he must have gone there about 1137, the time when\r\nJohn of Salisbury, the greatest writer of the age, was also there,\r\nsitting at the feet of Abelard, then lecturing in the College of St.\r\nGeneviéve. Mr. Rashdall, laying down a somewhat arbitrary definition,\r\nmaintains that Paris was not then, strictly speaking, a university,\r\nthough he admits it was such probably by the middle of the century.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it is clear that in Becket’s case, as in John of\r\nSalisbury’s, the schools of Paris, not the schools of London, were\r\nregarded as giving “university” training. Fifty years later Becket would\r\nhave gone to Oxford and the “martyrdom” would never have occurred. As it\r\nwas, after his English and Pauline training, he was, with disastrous\r\nresults, inoculated with the “fool fury of the Seine.” Still, St. Paul’s\r\nSchool may claim in him one of the earliest and most famous known\r\nPaulines, Henry the schoolmaster being the earliest.\r\n\r\nIt has to be confessed that from Becket’s time onwards to Colet’s we\r\nknow scarcely anything of St. Paul’s School beyond the bare fact\r\nevidenced by the statutes already quoted of 1243-54 and 1294-1304, and\r\ncertain fourteenth- and fifteenth-century documents to be presently\r\nquoted, that it was pursuing the even tenor of its way. While there are\r\ndocuments at Canterbury containing very full evidence of the great\r\nposition occupied by the Grammar School of the Archbishop and the\r\nGrammar schoolmaster there in the first half of the fourteenth century,\r\nwhile an unbroken series of the Acts of the Chapters of York and Lincoln\r\npreserve continual notices of the grammar schools of York and Lincoln,\r\nthere is an absolute dearth of such records at St. Paul’s. One solitary\r\nChapter Act Book of the Canons of St. Paul’s remains, and that is one of\r\nthe last quarter of the fifteenth century. It is singularly\r\nuninteresting, being almost entirely concerned with continual renewals\r\nof leave of absence granted to the canons who were called Residentiary\r\nbecause, unlike the other canons, they were supposed to be always\r\nresident; with renewals of leases and the division of the spoil among\r\nthe residentiary canons, and the “correction” of vicars—choral and minor\r\ncanons—for devotion to the forbidden sex. All we know is that the\r\nGrammar School went on and that it was not the Song School or a\r\nchoristers’ school, because we have conclusive evidence that this Song\r\nSchool was a different institution. Two statutes[73] in terms\r\ncorresponding to those about the chancellor and the Grammar schoolmaster\r\ndeal with the precentor (_cantor_) and the Song schoolmaster. “It is the\r\nPrecentor’s duty to rule [or teach, _regere_] the choir in the raising\r\nand lowering of the chant, and in singing the psalms. It is his duty\r\nthrough the Song Schoolmaster to place the singers’ names on the table,\r\nto stir up the lazy to sing, and gently rebuke those who run about the\r\nchoir in a disorderly fashion. On the greater feasts, if he is in choir\r\nand instructed as a singer, he begins the antiphons after the Benedictus\r\nand Magnificat and the processional chants and sequences. He examines\r\nthe boys to be brought into the choir and given a title as choristers.”\r\nA statute as to those choristers made during the deanery of Ralph de\r\nDiceto, the historian, between 1180 and 1200,[74] shows that they were\r\nalready then boarded in the Almonry. “As the boys of the Almonry ought\r\nto live on Alms” (or, as we might say, “as charity boys ought to live as\r\nsuch”) “they are to sit on the ground in the canons’ houses, not with\r\nthe vicars at table, lest they become uppish and drunken and perhaps too\r\npampered, and so unfit for the service of the church. Besides they\r\nsometimes go too early without saying goodbye to their host; and\r\nsometimes when they return to the Almonry from the feast, they despise\r\nthe living there and spread evil reports of their Master.” The statute\r\nrefers to the custom under which the residentiary canons had to give\r\nthree meals daily to two minor canons, two chaplains, four vicars\r\nchoral, two Almonry boys; the vergers and bell-ringers. The Master\r\nreferred to was not the Grammar schoolmaster, as has been rashly assumed\r\nby some, but the Almoner, the master of the almshouse. To the early\r\ncathedral churches a hospital or almshouse was as essential an appendage\r\nas a choir and a Grammar School. Some of them still survive. The Dean of\r\nHereford is still _ex officio_ Master of St. Ethelbert’s Hospital,\r\nattached to St. Ethelbert’s Cathedral. York had its St. Peter’s\r\nHospital, the ruins of the chapel of which, afterwards called St.\r\nLeonard’s Hospital, may still be seen. St. Paul’s, therefore, had its\r\nalmonry, a Norman-French word for almshouse, and its almoner. In\r\nstatutes made in 1263 the almoner is enjoined to distribute alms\r\naccording to the method ordained by those who gave endowments for the\r\npurpose; poor people and beggars who die in or near the churchyard he is\r\nto bury gratis without delay. “He is to have, moreover, daily with him 8\r\nboys fit for the service of the church, whom he is to have instructed\r\neither by himself or by another master in matters pertaining to the\r\nservice of the church and in literature [_i.e._ grammar] and good\r\nbehaviour; taking no payment for the same.”\r\n\r\nAn Almoner’s Register begun in 1345 is fortunately extant,[75] which\r\nrecords the statutes, charters, and customs of the office. In it, the\r\nalmoner records against himself that “if the Almoner does not keep a\r\ncleric to teach the choristers grammar, the schoolmaster of St. Paul’s\r\nclaims 5s. a year for teaching them, though he ought to demand nothing\r\nfor them because he keeps the school for them, as the Treasurer of St.\r\nPaul’s once alleged before the Dean and Chapter is to be found in\r\nancient deeds.” The allegation that the Grammar School was kept for the\r\nchoristers is historically untrue, though it is probably true that the\r\nchoristers ought to have been admitted free to it. At least, the\r\nquestion was solemnly raised at Beverley in 1312,[76] when the Grammar\r\nschoolmaster wished to make all choristers beyond the original number\r\nattending the Grammar School pay fees; but the succentor, the Song\r\nschoolmaster, contended that he was bound to teach all the choristers\r\nfree, and after inquiry by the Chapter into the “ancient customs” of the\r\nchurch it was decided that he was so bound, only the succentor was not\r\nto defraud him by admitting boys to the choir merely for the sake of\r\ngetting free education in the Grammar School. Whatever may have been the\r\nchoristers’ rights in the matter, the fact that the Grammar schoolmaster\r\nclaimed and received payment for them shows with absolute conclusiveness\r\nthat the Grammar School was not a choir school or a choir-boys’ school.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Lupton, late Surmaster of St. Paul’s School, in his _Life of\r\nColet_ actually cites[77] the will of one of the almoners, William of\r\nTolleshunt, made in 1329, as proof that the Cathedral school, which he\r\nconfuses with the Almonry school, “not only existed and flourished, but\r\ncontained within itself the germs of a University.” Yet what are the\r\nfacts? The Almoner says:[78] “I bequeath a shilling to each senior and\r\n6d. to each junior of the boys of the church whom I educated in the\r\nAlmonry. Also I give them my best Hugocio and the big and little\r\nPriscian, bound in one volume, Isidore’s Etymology, and all my grammar\r\nbooks, except those which my clerk Ralph has, and all the volumes of\r\nsermons which the Boy-Bishops used to preach in my time, to remain in\r\nthe Almonry for ever for the use of the boys living in it, and never to\r\nbe lent outside, or given away or sold.” The will goes on, “I bequeath\r\nalso my books of the art of Dialectic (of which John of Stoneground has\r\nthe old and new Logic), with the books of Natural History and other\r\nbooks of that art, in order that these books may be lent to boys apt for\r\nlearning (_ad scolatizandum_) when they leave the Almonry; due security\r\nbeing taken for their return, to prevent their being alienated. The\r\nbooks of physic also, of which I have several about medicines; and also\r\nthe books of the civil law, viz. the Institutes, Code, Digest, and\r\nAuthentics, and these legal works I give to the use of the boys in the\r\nmanner above written.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ST. PAUL’S SCHOOL (BEFORE ITS REMOVAL TO HAMMERSMITH)\r\n]\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Lupton: “There were works on Logic, on Physic, on Medicine, on\r\nCivil Law ... all were expressly bequeathed to the use of the boys.”\r\nYes, but while the grammar books were for the use of the boys in the\r\nAlmonry, these other books were, by the express terms of the will, to be\r\nlent to boys who had left the Almonry, when they went on to university\r\nstudies, so that the very words cited to show that this school was\r\nsomething more than a grammar school prove the exact opposite; and this\r\nvery case cited to show that the school in question was the St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral Grammar School shows that it was a district foundation and\r\nintended only for the eight boys in the Almonry. That these eight boys,\r\nafterwards increased to ten, were the choir-boys, is shown by the will\r\nof Bishop Richard of Newport,[79] in 1315, giving to this very William\r\nof Tolleshunt, Almoner, one of his executors, and to the Almoner for the\r\ntime being a house near St. Paul’s the rents of which, after paying £1\r\nto the maintenance of the Lady Chapel, were to be applied “to the\r\nsupport of one or two of the Almonry boys for two years after they have\r\nchanged their voices.” Again, among the earlier statutes of the Almonry\r\nit is ordered that “the boys after entering the choir are not to leave\r\nit except when their duty requires it.” William of Tolleshunt himself,\r\ntoo, bequeaths by his will a trust estate bequeathed to him some six\r\nyears before “for the Almonry boys serving the choir, for their shoes.”\r\n\r\nIn 1348 Sir John Pulteney,[80] knight, gave 20s. a year to the almoner\r\nto provide the choristers with summer clothes.[81] In return for the\r\nshoes the boys had to sing _De Profundis_, with the usual Pater Noster,\r\nAve Maria and collects, every morning on getting up and every evening on\r\ngoing to bed; and for the summer clothes to sing an anthem after complin\r\nwith prayers for the dead in the Pulteney Chapel. In 1358 William of\r\nRavenstone,[82] Almoner, gave a tenement called the Stonehouse in\r\nPaternoster Row “for the support of an additional chorister or two.”\r\nThat the choristers when clever were meant to go on to the universities\r\nis clear from a payment out of the chantry of Bishop Ralph (Baldock) who\r\ndied in 1313. He gave 3s. “to poor students being sometyme choristers of\r\nthe said cathedral church towards ther exhibicion yearly,” while a later\r\nbenefactor Thomas Ever, in the reign of Henry IV., gave a like sum\r\nspecifically “to the poore choristers of Paules towards their exhibicion\r\nin the University.”\r\n\r\nThere is no question, therefore, that, while there was a grammar school\r\nmaintained for the benefit of the choristers, it was quite distinct from\r\nthe choir school for teaching them singing, and from the Cathedral\r\nGrammar School open to all boys. Or perhaps it would be more correct to\r\nsay that the choir-boys, being lodged and boarded in the Almonry, had a\r\ntutor provided for them to see that they learnt grammar. For one can\r\nhardly call the teaching of eight or ten choristers a school.\r\n\r\nThere would not have been any need to insist on this school so much at\r\nlength if the whole matter had not been thrown into confusion through\r\nthe labours of a certain Miss Hackett who devoted herself in the first\r\nquarter of the 19th century to the interests of the choir-boys of St.\r\nPaul’s, who were then left without any proper schooling or care. She,\r\nwith great energy, routed out all she could find in the records of St.\r\nPaul’s or elsewhere, relating to the choir-boys, and published it in a\r\npamphlet misnamed _Correspondence and Evidences respecting the Ancient\r\nCollegiate School attached to St. Paul’s Cathedral_.[83] She succeeded\r\nin establishing in Chancery the claim of the choir-boys on the revenues\r\nof the Almonry. But her zeal outran her discretion, as whenever she saw\r\nin any of the records of St. Paul’s anything about a school or\r\nschool-boys, she at once attributed it to the choir school and\r\nchoirboys, and attacked the Chancellor, as well as the Almoner, on the\r\nground that the St. Paul’s Grammar School was for the choir-boys. In\r\nthis she failed. But she did a great deal of harm to the Cathedral\r\nGrammar Schools in general by imbuing people with the notion that they\r\nwere mere choir-schools. Mr. Lupton makes the Grammar School to have\r\nbeen in Sharmoveres (now Sermon) Lane. Sharmoveres is a name of naught.\r\nIt is simply a misreading of “Sarmoners,” _i.e._ Sermoners’ Lane, from a\r\nhouse which is said in a document of Edward I.’s reign to have belonged\r\nto “Adam le sermoner.” Sermon Lane is the modern shortening. This was\r\nnot the Grammar School nor even the Almonry school, but a house\r\nbequeathed to the Almonry. Sermon Lane is at the west end of St. Paul’s,\r\nsome little way from the church. The Grammar School was at the opposite\r\nor east end, in the churchyard, and quite close to the church.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared away the confusion between the Grammar School and\r\nthe choristers’ boarding-house we must leave the history of the Almonry\r\nwithout following it further, and for a little while turn from the\r\nhistory of St. Paul’s School to that of its two mediæval rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ST. MARY-LE-BOW GRAMMAR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe history of the school of St. Mary-le-Bow is unfortunately soon\r\nexhausted. The only references to it, apart from the various mentions of\r\nit in connection with the two other privileged schools, which I have\r\nbeen able to find, are in the Archbishop’s Register at Lambeth. The\r\nfirst of these is an order from Archbishop Robert Winchelsea,[84]\r\nSeptember 25, 1309, settling a dispute as to the right of appointment of\r\nthe schoolmaster. It is addressed “To our official,” _i.e._ the Official\r\nPrincipal or Judge of the Archbishop’s Consistory Court. The archbishop\r\nsays that he had received a petition from “Mr. John, rector of the\r\nGrammar School (_scolarum gramaticalium_) of the Church of the Blessed\r\nMary le Bow (_de arcubus_) London,” showing that he had been appointed\r\nmaster of the school by the Dean of the church (the Dean of the Arches,\r\nas he is now called), to whom “by ancient and hitherto peacefully\r\nobserved custom the order and government and appointment of Master is\r\nwell known to belong.” But “after he had quietly taught (_rexerit_) the\r\nschool,” the Official, “wishing to change this custom,” had appointed\r\none Mr. Robert Cotoun and removed Mr. John. The Archbishop informed the\r\nOfficial that, if the facts were as stated, he was to let Mr. John enjoy\r\nthe teaching of the said school freely.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the patronage of the school was vested in the Dean of\r\nArches explains why we do not find appointments of the master in the\r\nArchbishop’s Registers as we do in the case of the Canterbury Grammar\r\nSchool. On March 23, 1382/3, however, an entry in Archbishop Courtney’s\r\nRegister shows him committing to “his beloved son, William Poklyngton,\r\nclerk, the teaching and governance of the Grammar School of the deanery\r\nof our Church of Blessed Mary of the Arches now vacant and to our\r\ndisposition belonging,” and appointing him master of the same school.\r\nThe peculiar form of the appointment suggests that it was made by the\r\nArchbishop either because the deanery was vacant, or because the\r\nappointment had lapsed to him in default of the Dean. For some reason\r\nunknown this entry is cancelled in the original MS.\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 1399, Archbishop Arundel[85] “at his manor of Lambeth”—it\r\nis never called a palace in ancient documents; his “palace” was at\r\nCanterbury—in like manner “committed the teaching and governance of the\r\nGrammar School of the Arches of London with all its rights and\r\nappurtenances in the Deanery of the Arches” to “Mr. Thomas Barym, master\r\nin grammar.”\r\n\r\nThe school was clearly still in existence in 1446, when it is mentioned\r\namong the five grammar schools authorised by the ordinance of the\r\necclesiastical authorities, confirmed by Henry VI. Letters Patent of\r\nthat year to be discussed later. These Letters Patent were interpreted\r\nby Stow[86] into a creation of the school of St. Mary-le-Bow. “In this\r\nparish,” he says, “was a Grammar-School by commandment of Henry VI.,\r\nwhich school was of old time kept in a house for that purpose prepared\r\nin the churchyard, but that school being decayed, as others about the\r\ncity, the school house was let out for rent, in the reign of King Henry\r\nthe 8th for 4s. a year, a cellar for 2s. a year, and two vaults\r\nunderneath the church for 15s. both.” It is probable, however, from the\r\nterms of the Letters Patent, that the school was held actually in the\r\nchurch, since St. Paul’s School is expressly described as being in the\r\nchurchyard, while this school is, with equal exactness, described as\r\nbeing in the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL OF ST. MARTIN’S-LE-GRAND\r\n\r\nOf the third ancient school, that of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, there seems\r\nto be no history recoverable. Presumably when Henry VII. annexed the\r\ncollege to Westminster Abbey the documents were transferred too. But\r\nonly one small Register of St. Martin’s, written in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, remains in the Westminster Chapter Muniments, and there is no\r\nmention in it of the school. There is, however, one reference to the\r\nschoolmaster in the City Letter Books.[87] “On Thursday before 24\r\nAugust, 26 Edward I., 1298, John, the cap, hat, or hood-maker (cappeler)\r\nof Fleet Street entered into a recognizance to Master Hugh of\r\nWhittington (Wytington), schoolmaster (_Magistro scolarum_) of St.\r\nMartin’s-le-Grand for payment of £8 at Michaelmas year. Afterwards\r\nMaster John of Whittington, brother and executor of the said Hugh, came\r\nand acknowledged that he had been satisfied of such sum. Therefore it\r\nwas cancelled.” The entry is enough to show that the school was going on\r\nand that the master was a man of substance, being able to lend the then\r\nconsiderable sum of £8.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the fourteenth century was signalised by considerable\r\nactivity in the foundation of new, or changes in old, grammar schools.\r\nThis was due to two conflicting forces. On the one hand, it was due, as\r\nit was expressed in Wykeham’s foundation deed of New College, Oxford, to\r\n“the general disease of the clerical army, which through the want of\r\nclergy, caused by pestilence, wars, and other miseries of the world, we\r\nhave seen greviously wounded,” or, as it was more shortly put in\r\nchanging the appointment of a master of St. Peter’s School, York, in\r\n1369, from a five-years’ appointment to a life tenure, to “the late\r\nDeath and the rarity of M.A.s.” The demand for clergy to fill the ranks\r\nthinned by the Black Death of 1349 and its subsequent outbreaks, caused\r\na demand for grammar schools. On the other hand, the incipient revolt of\r\nthe townspeople against clerical domination which manifested itself in\r\nthe substitution of lay for clerical ministers in the field of politics,\r\nand by the open propagation of Lollard opinions against image worship,\r\ntransubstantiation, confession, and the celibacy of the clergy, and so\r\nforth, in the field of religion, created a demand for learning and for\r\nschools. The conflict of the two opposing forces is shown in the\r\npetition presented to Richard II. in 1394 (the very year, it may be\r\nnoted, of the transfer of Winchester College, founded in 1382, to its\r\npresent buildings) by the ecclesiastical authorities of London, who\r\nclaimed the monopoly of education in “the three ancient and privileged\r\nschools.” “The King’s devout chaplains and orators, William,[88]\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, the Dean of your frank\r\nchapel of St. Martin’s-le-Grand and the Chancellor of the Church of St.\r\nPaul in London,” set out how to them, “as well by the law spiritual as\r\nby customary prescription in that behalf, the order, management, and\r\nexamination of the masters of certain schools of the faculty of grammar\r\nin London and the suburbs, belonged, belong, or ought to belong, to\r\nthem, with the advice of the Bishop of London, from time immemorial.”\r\n“Yet” they complained, “lately certain strangers, feigning themselves\r\nMasters of grammar, having no sufficient learning in that faculty,\r\nwithout the assent, or knowledge, and against the will of the\r\npetitioners, wilfully usurped their jurisdiction, and kept General\r\nGrammar Schools in the City in deceit and fraud of the children, to the\r\ngreat prejudice of the King’s lieges, and the jurisdiction of Holy\r\nChurch. But when the three Masters of the schools of St. Paul’s, the\r\nArches, and St. Martin’s for the care and profit of the king’s subjects,\r\nhad gone to law against the foreign masters in Court Christian,\r\naccording to ecclesiastical law, their adversaries had sued them in the\r\nsecular courts to make them abandon their pleas.” The petitioners,\r\ntherefore, asked the King, both because of his interest in his free\r\nchapel of St. Martin, and of the prejudice done to the petitioners, to\r\ndirect letters to issue under the Privy Seal to the mayor and aldermen\r\n“to attempt nothing whereby the jurisdiction of Holy Church, or the\r\nprocess between the parties in Court Christian might be disturbed.”\r\n\r\nWhether the Privy Seal asked for was issued does not appear. Parliament\r\nwas then supporting the Lollards.[89] But next year Richard was fetched\r\nback from his Irish War to put them down, and the leading Lollards had\r\nto recant on pain of death. Certain it is that the three church schools\r\nretained their monopoly for nearly half a century more. It was then\r\nattacked and broken up by assailants from within the pale of the church\r\nitself and by orthodox churchmen. The first breach of it, apparently for\r\npurely educational reasons, was made by the establishment of a grammar\r\nschool in St. Anthony’s Hospital in Threadneedle Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ST. ANTHONY’S HOSPITAL AND SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThis hospital was so interesting an institution in itself, and the\r\nerection and career of its school have been so much misrepresented, that\r\nits history is worth telling at some length. Stow’s[90] account of this\r\nhospital is rather long but not very correct. It “was sometime a cell to\r\nSt. Anthonies of Vienne. For I read that King Henry III. granted to the\r\nbrotherhood of St. Anthony of Vienne, a place among the Jews, which was\r\nsometime their synagogue, and had been builded by them about the year\r\n1231; but the Christians obtained of the King that it should be\r\ndedicated to our blessed Lady, and since, an hospital being there\r\nbuilded, was called St. Anthonies in London. It was founded in the\r\nparish of St. Bennett Fynke ‘for a mayster, two priestes, one\r\nscholemayster and 12 poore men.’” “Moreover, king Henry VI. in the\r\ntwentieth of his reign gave unto John Carpenter, D.D., master of St.\r\nAnthonies Hospital and to his brethren and their successors for ever his\r\nmanor of Ponington, with the appurtenances” and other property “towards\r\nthe maintenance of 5 scholars in the University of Oxford to be brought\r\nup in the faculty of arts, after the rate of 10d. a week for every\r\nscholar, so that the said scholars before their going to Oxford, be\r\nfirst instructed in the rudiments of grammar at the College of Eton,\r\nfounded by the same king. In the year 1474 Edward IV. granted to William\r\nSay, B.D., master of the hospital of St. Anthony’s to have priests,\r\nclerks, scholars, poor men, and brethren of the same, clerks or lay men,\r\nquoristers, proctors, messengers, servants in household and other things\r\nwhatsoever, the like as the Prior and Convent of St. Anthony’s of\r\nVienne. This Hospital was united, annexed and appropriated unto the\r\nCollegiate Church of St. George in Windsor about the year 1485. This\r\ngoodly foundation, having a free school and almshouses for poor men,\r\nbuilded of hard stone, adjoining to the west end of the church, was of\r\nold time confirmed by Henry VI. in the year 1447.” Such is his account\r\nof the origin of the foundation. He then deals with its latter end. “One\r\nJohnson (a schoolmaster there) became a prebendary of Windsor and then\r\nby little and little followed the spoil of this hospital. He first\r\ndissolved the choir, conveyed the plate and ornaments, then the bells,\r\nand lastly put out the Almsmen from their houses, appointing them\r\nportions of 12d. a week to each (but now I hear of no such matter),\r\ntheir houses with other be now letten out for rent, and the Church is a\r\npreaching-place for the French nation. The school-house was commanded in\r\nthe reign of Henry VI., and sithence also, above other; but now it is\r\ndecayed and come to nothing, by taking from it what thereunto belonged.”\r\n\r\nThe Hospital was at first a cell of the Hospital of St. Anthony at\r\nVienne, a hospital famous throughout the world. There is no mention of\r\nany local habitation of the brethren of St. Anthony in England before\r\n1249. Then in a document at Windsor, dated 1253, a grant to the hospital\r\nof the earlier date is mentioned, when the Church of All Saints,\r\nHereford, was bestowed upon it by Henry III., and in 1253 a letter from\r\nPope Alexander IV. congratulates the same king on having granted to the\r\nMaster and Brethren of St. Anthony’s “a place in London among the Jews.”\r\nFor further on this subject see _Mediæval London_, vol. ii. p. 268.\r\n\r\nLater writers have for the most part followed Stow. Thus Mr. Lupton in\r\nhis _Life of Dean Colet_ repeats[91] the story that the original\r\nfoundation included a schoolmaster; and says that Edward IV. “augmented\r\nit. The school continued into the reign of Elizabeth, the rest of the\r\nproperty was not left to wait for the inquisition of Henry VIII.,” and\r\nthen repeats, as typical, Stow’s story of the plunder by Prebendary\r\nJohnson. Again, Dr. Sharpe says,[92] “The Hospital appears to have\r\nalways supported a Schoolmaster from its foundation.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the school was no part of the original foundation\r\nof the hospital, and only made its appearance when the main institution\r\nhad undergone a complete revolution. The hospital existed for at least\r\n100 years longer, and the school began at least 200 years later, and\r\ncontinued for nearly 100 years more than Stow leads us to believe. The\r\nlife of the hospital lasted for as nearly as possible four centuries. It\r\nbegan about 1249; it ended in 1666. For the first 150 years of its\r\nexistence it was in tutelage to a foreign and monastic parent. A brief\r\nperiod of independence followed under native English clerical (not\r\nmonastic) rulers, for some three-quarters of a century; and the era of\r\nits complete and formal release from tutelage was signalised by the\r\nfoundation of the Grammar School in it, which enjoyed the highest\r\nreputation for about 100 years. The institution was then again placed\r\nunder an external master. But the school continued to flourish, and,\r\ninstead of being destroyed in the reign of Elizabeth, lasted into the\r\nreign of Charles II., under whom both school and hospital perished,\r\nnever to be revived, in the Great Fire of London.\r\n\r\nIn 1434 John Carpenter became master or warden of the hospital, and he\r\nmust be regarded as the second founder of the hospital and the actual\r\nfounder of its school. He was a very considerable person in his day,\r\nbeing a great promoter of education and supporter of the secular clergy\r\nas against the regulars, the monks, black canons, and friars. His fine\r\ntomb, restored out of all antiquity by the ill-directed gratitude of\r\nOriel College, is still to be seen in the ancient collegiate church of\r\nWestbury-on-Trym near Bristol. He was anxious to establish the secular\r\ncanons of that church as his episcopal chapter instead of, or at least\r\nin addition to, the monks of Worcester. Indeed he actually called\r\nhimself Bishop of Westbury and Worcester. He became Provost of Oriel in\r\n1425, and Master of the hospital at least seven years later.\r\n\r\nCarpenter was mixed up with the foundation of Eton as well as with that\r\nof St. Anthony’s School. When he was made Bishop of Worcester, he was\r\nconsecrated in the collegiate church of Eton, and it was as a trustee of\r\nEton and Oriel, and only nominally in his capacity as Master of St.\r\nAnthony’s, that the grants, mentioned by Stow,[93] of the manor of\r\nPonington, and quit-rents from several places in Hampshire, were made to\r\nhim and the brethren of the hospital. What became of this grant it seems\r\nimpossible to find out. No mention of it occurs in the accounts of the\r\nhospital, nor do the authorities of St. George’s, Windsor, Eton, or\r\nOriel know anything of the property. Probably it was one of the\r\nLancastrian grants for the benefit of Eton on which Edward IV.’s Act of\r\nResumption operated, and so passed away from Eton and Oriel for ever.\r\n\r\nIn 1441 the revolution in the constitution of the hospital was\r\nconsummated. A Bull of Pope Eugenius IV. released the brethren of the\r\nhospital from the obligation to use a common dormitory and refectory,\r\nwhich by the Augustinian rule they were bound to use (though it is\r\nstated that there was no such dormitory or refectory), and enabled the\r\nclerks who served it to live in any decent place, until a dormitory and\r\nrefectory were provided—a politic way of completely authorising its\r\nconversion into a house of seculars. At the same time, by the licence of\r\nRobert (Gilbert), Bishop of London, the church of St. Benet Finck was\r\nentirely appropriated to the hospital, and converted from a rectory into\r\na vicarage. This was in order that the revenues of the rectory, worth\r\nsixteen marks a year, might be applied to the maintenance of “a master\r\nor fit Informer in the faculty of grammar,” “to keep a grammar school\r\n(_regere scolas gramaticales_) in the precinct of the hospital or some\r\nfit house close by, to teach, instruct, and inform gratis all boys and\r\nothers whatsoever wishing to learn and become scholars (_scolatizare_).”\r\n\r\nIts foundation was only one of a long series of school foundations which\r\nmarked the period of the reign of Henry VI., who, far more than Edward\r\nVI., is entitled to the credit of being the patron king of school-boys.\r\nEton, Newport, Shropshire, Newland, Wye (now the Wye Agricultural\r\nCollege, Kent), Alnwick, Towcester, are some among the grammar schools\r\nstill existing which were founded in the ten years 1440-50; while there\r\nwere many more which are no longer existing or have been degraded into\r\nelementary schools, or converted into exhibition funds. The movement was\r\nthe first breath of the Renaissance stirring the dry bones of the\r\nschools. It was the outcome of a beginning of reaction against the\r\nexcessive cult of scholastic logic, and a desire to return to the\r\nhumanities of the “artists” as opposed to the sophistry of the\r\ntheologians. Considering the conspicuous part taken in the new movement\r\nby men like Beckington, Waynflete, and Say, all Wykehamists, we may\r\nattribute a considerable share of it at least to the influence of\r\nWykeham’s foundation at Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe most striking manifestation of the new spirit is seen in the Letters\r\nPatent granted in 1439, giving leave to William Byngham, rector of St.\r\nJohn Zachary in London, to found the College of God’s House in\r\nCambridge, at first an annex to Clare Hall, and afterwards incorporated\r\nwith Christ’s College. In his petition for the licence Bingham said that\r\nhe had found all over the country grammar schools, formerly flourishing,\r\nnow fallen into abeyance for lack of proper teachers. He therefore asked\r\nfor leave to found a college of a master and twenty-four scholars for\r\nthe training of Grammar schoolmasters, who were to issue thence to teach\r\nschool all over the country. This, then, is the first Training College\r\non record. In its statutes the importance of the classics was insisted\r\non, not merely, as in the days of Wykeham and the foundation of\r\nWinchester, because grammar was the key which unlocked the Holy\r\nScriptures, and was the gate to the liberal sciences “and theology, the\r\nmistress of all,” but because “it was necessary in dealing with law and\r\nother difficult matters of State and also the means of mutual\r\ncommunication and conversation between us and strangers and foreigners.”\r\nHere spoke the citizen of London and the man of the modern world. In\r\nmuch the same way Waynflete, himself ex-Headmaster of Winchester and\r\nfirst Headmaster of Eton, in his foundation of Magdalen College School,\r\ncarried on by him from 1448 though not finally endowed and settled till\r\n1480, provided by his statutes for the demyes being trained in grammar\r\n“that they might go out and teach others,” and he particularly ordered\r\nthat they were not prematurely to be made sophisters.[94]\r\n\r\nIn 1443 Walter Lyhert, who succeeded Carpenter on his promotion to the\r\nSee of Worcester, in the provostship of Oriel, also succeeded him as\r\nWarden (Custos), as he was now called, of St. Anthony’s. He in turn\r\nbecame a bishop, being promoted to Norwich in 1445. He was succeeded in\r\nthe Mastership of St. Anthony’s by William Say, a Wykehamist of some\r\nfame, afterwards Dean of St. Paul’s. Under his rule the new constitution\r\nwas completed. By Bull of January 28, 1446, the Pope granted, on the\r\nrequest of Henry VI. as patron, power to make new statutes for the\r\nhospital and its inmates to the Bishop of Worcester (Carpenter), the\r\nBishop of Norwich (Lyhert), William Waynflete, then Provost of Eton, and\r\nWilliam Say, then master of the hospital. The school, like that of Eton,\r\nwas thus inaugurated on the model and under the guidance of members of\r\nthe College of William of Wykeham, which Henry VI. dearly loved and\r\ndeeply studied, and to which he paid the sincere homage of exact\r\nimitation. The statutes made by Carpenter and the rest are not\r\nforthcoming, but considering the auspices under which they were made, we\r\nmay safely conclude that they followed their model as closely as did\r\nthose of Eton, so far as what was presumably mainly a day-school could\r\nfollow the statutes of what was mainly a boarding-school. There are\r\nindeed not wanting minor indications that some scholars at least boarded\r\nin the hospital. We know at all events that in two things in which Eton\r\ndeparted from the Winchester model, St. Anthony’s followed suit, namely,\r\nthe raising of the stipend of the master from £10 to £16, and the\r\ndirection that the school should be a free school to all who chose to\r\ncome. We also know that, as at Winchester and Eton, a singing master was\r\nestablished and a Song School; for in 1440, David Fythian, who was\r\nrector of St. Bennet Finck, and John Grene, clerks, at the request of\r\nJohn Carpenter (and we may be sure at his expense and in consideration\r\nof a payment by him) had granted a rent of ten marks issuing out of “the\r\nCowpe on the Hoope” in All Saints parish, London Wall, with power of\r\ndistraint on it and another brew-house called the Dolphin and a tavern\r\ncalled the Bell in Southwark, to pay “John Bennet of London, clerk,\r\nyearly 8 marks, and 4 yards of new cloth of gentlemens’ suit” for\r\nteaching singing “to the boys, who are and shall be in the church of the\r\nsaid hospital.” This meant, of course, the choristers. In 1449 the\r\nbrewery called the Cup on the Hoop was definitely devised by will,\r\nwhich, when enrolled in the Hustings Court, at once operated as a\r\nconveyance and dispensed with the necessity of a licence in mortmain, to\r\nWilliam Say, then Master, and the Brethren of St. Anthony’s, “for\r\nmaintenance of a clerk to teach assiduously all the boys of the house\r\nchanting with the organ (_cantico organico_) and plain song,” but while\r\nJohn Benatt (_sic_) remained, the Master was not bound to find another\r\nteacher. The hospital was to enjoy the residue after providing for the\r\nSong schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThere is a series of documents connected with the hospital, the exact\r\npurport of which it is a little difficult to make out, but they seem to\r\nsuggest some intention on the part of John Carpenter to benefit alike\r\nSt. Anthony’s School and Oriel College, Oxford, by exhibitions at the\r\nuniversity; bringing the school, though in a much modified degree, into\r\nthe same sort of relationship with that college which Winchester bore to\r\nNew College, or Eton to King’s, or Westminster afterwards to Christ\r\nChurch and Trinity, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nOriel College,[95] Oxford, possesses a conveyance, June 27, 1424, to\r\nJohn Carpenter and Henry Sampson, both fellows and afterwards provosts,\r\nand others of land at Dagenham in Essex. Nine years later, the manor or\r\nmanors of Valence Gallants and lands at Frystelings and Copped Hall were\r\nconveyed to a similar body of feoffees. In 1442 the manor of Easthall\r\nwas acquired. By deed of June 27, 1447, all these properties were\r\nconveyed to Carpenter and Sampson, and in 1451 by Carpenter, then Bishop\r\nof Worcester, to Oriel College, on condition of their granting them to\r\nSt. Anthony’s, reserving a pension “for the exhibition of certain poor\r\nscholars in St. Mary’s Hall, Oxford,” a dependency of the College. By\r\ndeed of 14th November in the same year, the college granted the lands to\r\nthe hospital, reserving a rent-charge of twenty-five marks, and by deed\r\nof 20th November,[96] William Say, “Master or Warden of the house or\r\nhospital of St. Anthony and the brethren of the same” granted an annual\r\nrent of £20 to the Provost and fellows “of the Royal College, commonly\r\ncalled Oreall,” payable in St. Mary’s Church, Oxford, “for the\r\nexhibition and maintenance of scholars to study there according to the\r\nform and effect of certain provisions or ordinances to be made by John,\r\nBishop of Worcester.” By another deed of the same day, the Bishop, John\r\nCarpenter, declared the conditions of the exhibitions, but, alas! only\r\nin general terms; and whether any ordinances were actually made by\r\nCarpenter, and if so, what has become of them, is unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen the exhibitions were established seems rather obscure. The earliest\r\nextant accounts, now at Windsor, of the hospital are for 1478-79 and\r\n1494-95, and contain no mention of the Essex property or of scholars at\r\nOxford. But in 1501-2, the rental includes the manors of Valence and\r\nEasthall and lands called Frystelyng’s lands in Essex let for £13 a\r\nyear; and among the expenses is the item “The skolers of Oxford\r\nstypents, £10 : 18s.” The first entry in the Oriel College accounts of\r\nany money received for scholars is December 6, 1504, when, £10 : 6 : 8\r\nwas received by the College “for Mr. Tretyng” and paid over to him. In\r\n1521-22, the St. Anthony’s account, which is for expenses only, includes\r\n“for the exhibicion of the scolers of Oxford in Seynt Mary Haule £10 :\r\n7s.” St. Mary’s Hall was originally the rectory house of St. Mary’s\r\nChurch, which was appropriated to Oriel College, who still appoint the\r\nvicar; and was probably the original home of the college and always\r\nremained a dependency of it.\r\n\r\nHardly had the hospital and school thus been put upon a sound basis than\r\nthe Wars of the Roses substituted the Yorkists for the Lancastrians on\r\nthe throne. The Yorkist accession and the Restoration of Charles II. are\r\nthe only epochs in English history since the Norman Conquest in which\r\nthe successful party have not been content with the enjoyment of power\r\nand the prospect of having things all their own way for the future, but\r\nhave set themselves _more Gallico_ to destroy the good deeds of the\r\nopposite party and root out their remembrance, if possible, from the\r\nland. All the foundations of Henry VI. were threatened with destruction.\r\nFor the purpose apparently of proving himself the true heir of the\r\nPlantagenet Edwards, Edward IV. professed the most extreme devotion to\r\nthe collegiate church of Windsor. He showed his devotion in the\r\nvicarious way common in those days, by endowing it with the plunder of\r\nother places. An Act of Parliament on Edward’s accession in 1460\r\ndeclared all the grants of the three Lancastrian Henries void. Part of\r\nthe possessions of Eton was granted to other places; while the whole\r\ninstitution was by a Bull of Union in November 1463 annexed to St.\r\nGeorge’s, Windsor. Whether, as has been represented,[97] it was intended\r\nthat the school should cease to exist, is very doubtful. When St.\r\nJames’s Hospital, Westminster, was granted to Eton itself as St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, Oxford, had been to Oriel College, and St.\r\nJulian’s Hospital, Southampton, to Queen’s College, Oxford, those\r\ncolleges only took the net surplus after keeping up the hospitals.\r\nWindsor in like manner was probably only intended to get the surplus\r\nafter keeping up Eton school. However, the Bull was strongly opposed by\r\nWilliam Westbury, the provost and ex-headmaster. In 1467 a large part of\r\nthe Eton estates was restored to it, and in 1470 King Edward IV. himself\r\nasked for the revocation of the Bull of Union and obtained a commission\r\nfrom the Pope for the purpose, and a final decree revoking it was\r\npronounced by Cardinal-Archbishop Bouchier on August 30, 1476. It was,\r\none can hardly doubt, by way of compensation to Windsor for the loss of\r\nEton College that St. Anthony’s Hospital was, in 1475, annexed and\r\nappropriated to it in the same way as Eton had been. The terms of the\r\nannexation were absolute.[98] The King granted to “the Warden of Dean of\r\nthe College of the Blessed Mary, St. George and Edward the Confessor in\r\nhis castle of Windsor and to the chapter of the same college the\r\nWardenship, advowson, parsonage, donation, collation, presentation, and\r\nfree bestowal of the house, hospital or free chapel of St. Anthony,\r\nLondon, by whatever name it might be called, and the house hospital, or\r\nfree chapel itself, with all its liberties, franchises, privileges,\r\nimmunities, lands, tenements, rents, services,” etc., etc., belonging\r\nthereto, “to hold in pure and perpetual alms to their own use whenever\r\nit next became vacant by death, resignation, or otherwise”; and with\r\npower to take possession without any further process. On June 2, 1475,\r\nDean and Chapter appointed Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, and\r\nothers their attorneys to take possession of the hospital, they having\r\ngot Peter Courtney, then master of the hospital, to resign in\r\nconsideration of a pension of 100 marks or £66 : 13 : 4 a year. As in\r\n1478 he became himself Dean of Windsor, he did not suffer much by the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, did the hospital or school, which went on for at least 200\r\nyears more. Absolute as the terms of annexation were they seem to have\r\nbeen interpreted not as an abolition of the hospital, but only as a\r\ntransfer to the dean and chapter of the right to the surplus, formerly\r\ntaken by the master for his own use, estimated in the pension\r\narrangement at 100 marks.\r\n\r\nThis comes out clearly in one of the earliest Account Rolls of the\r\nhospital after the transfer, which is fortunately preserved at Windsor,\r\nand gives an exact picture of the way the hospital was managed. It is\r\nfor the year 1478-79 when David Hopton, Canon of Windsor, acted as\r\nMaster of the hospital. The total income was the very large sum of\r\n£539 : 19s. or about £10,800 a year of our money. Of this only £18 : 2 :\r\n4 was derived from rents or property, and that rental was subject to\r\noutgoings in the way of quit-rents of £7 : 6 : 8 and repairs to the\r\nextent of £9 : 5s.; so that the endowment was really a minus quantity.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the rest of the revenue was derived from voluntary\r\nsubscriptions, which are called in the accounts “procurations,” being\r\ncollected by procurators or proctors, exactly on the same principle that\r\ncollections on Church Briefs were made after the Reformation. Indeed\r\nthese and other like accounts make it clear[99] that the system of\r\nChurch Briefs,[100] only abolished in 1828, was not of post-Reformation\r\norigin, but was extremely ancient. The right of collecting in a\r\nparticular district was farmed out to different people who paid a fixed\r\nrent for the privilege for a term of years, and pocketed in return for\r\nthe expenditure of their time and trouble whatever they managed to\r\nextract from the pockets of the faithful beyond the stipulated rent.\r\nSome specimens of St. Anthony’s Hospital leases to these farmers are\r\npreserved. There is one for the year 1479. It’s an Indenture made\r\nbetween the Dean or Warden of St. George’s College, the Master of St.\r\nAnthony’s, London, or in England, and the Canons of Windsor of the one\r\npart, and Thomas Morton of Worcester of the other part. In the same form\r\nas in a lease of land the Dean and Canons transfer, grant, and let to\r\nthe aforesaid Thomas “all goods, profits, and commodities for any reason\r\ngiven, or to be given, assigned, or to be assigned, bequeathed, or to be\r\nbequeathed to and for the Hospital of St. Anthony in and throughout the\r\nwhole bishopric of Hereford and archdeaconry of Oxford in places exempt\r\n[from the ordinary’s authority] as well as not exempt; with all pigs and\r\nother animals in the places aforesaid”; and constitute the said Thomas\r\ntheir lawful proctor and receiver in the premises, with full power of\r\nappointing substitutes, and without rendering any account. The term was\r\nten years and the rent reserved £30 a year, payable in two half-yearly\r\npayments at Michaelmas and St. Philip and St. James’s Day. If the rent\r\nwas in arrear the Dean and Canons were at liberty to dismiss the said\r\nThomas and appoint another proctor in his place. The total rents of the\r\nHospital shown in the account for 1478-79 derived in this fashion were:\r\n\r\n Bishoprics of Salisbury and Ely, and\r\n   archdeaconries of Lincoln, Stow, Huntingdon, and\r\n   Leicester, and Deanery of Rutland (3 proctors in\r\n   one lease)                                         £128     13 4\r\n Archdeaconries of Northampton, Bedford, Bucks, and\r\n   the jurisdiction of St. Alban’s (1 proctor)          40      0 0\r\n Bishoprics of Exeter and Bath and Wells (3\r\n   proctors)                                            44      0 0\r\n Bishopric of Rochester, and Deaneries of Shoreham\r\n   and Croydon, with church of Criff                     4      0 0[101]\r\n Archdeaconries of Derby, Stafford, Coventry, and\r\n   Shrewsbury (2 proctors)                              22      0 0\r\n Archdeaconries of Chester and Lancaster                11      0 0\r\n Bishopric of London                                    22      0 0\r\n Bishopric of Winchester                                26     10 0\r\n Bishopric of Chichester                                 8      0 0[102]\r\n Province of York and Isle of Man (2 proctors)          76     13 4[103]\r\n Bishopric of Winchester                                28     13 4\r\n Bishopric of Hereford and Archdeaconry of Oxford       29      6 8[104]\r\n Archdeaconry of Canterbury                             26     13 4\r\n Bishopric of Norwich                                   44      0 0\r\n Bishoprics of St. David’s and Llandaff                  8      0 0[105]\r\n Bishoprics of Bangor and Asaph                          4     16 8\r\n                                                      £523     16 8\r\n\r\nThe rentals are interesting as showing approximately the relative wealth\r\nand population of the various districts of England at the time. The\r\nsuperior wealth of the south over the north and the eastern over the\r\nwestern parts stands out clearly. The total receipts, equal in value to\r\nover £10,000 a year of our money, show an astounding liberality on the\r\npart of the givers of the voluntary donations and subscriptions by which\r\nthe Hospital was maintained.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure is only given under a few different headings in gross,\r\nthe reader being referred for details to a “paper book” which is not\r\nforthcoming. The wages of ministers, “priests, clerks, other ministers\r\nand servants” came to £45 : 12 : 8; the “robes of the said priests,\r\nclerks, scholars, poor, and other ministers and servants” cost £10 :\r\n13 : 9. Bread made by Hobald, a baker of London, £21 : 18 : 7; beer\r\nbought from divers brewers at 1-1/2d. and 1d. a gallon, £35 : 11 : 8;\r\nother purchases (_cati_) £70 : 14s. “Foreign” expenses totalled £40 :\r\n5 : 11-1/2d. The Sacrist of the Chapel received £4 : 0 : 9 for general\r\nexpenses; a general obit, 8s. 8d., and Thomas Sainge’s obit, 6s. 8d. The\r\nclothes of the poor of the Hospital consisted of ten shirts and eight\r\npairs of drawers of fustian at 3-1/2d. a yard; ten pairs of shoes at 2s.\r\n5d. each; and ten pairs of stockings (caligis) of wool at 8d. a yard,\r\nand cost 19s. 11-1/2d. A new vestry at All Saints’, Hereford, was\r\nerected for £10 : 17 : 11. Repairs on the Hospital and the Swan next\r\ndoor came to £82 : 12 : 2-1/2d. So that the “arrears” (_arregaia_,\r\nmeaning in mediæval accounts, not money due, but the clear surplus),\r\namounting to £98, were handed over to the Treasurer of St. George’s,\r\nWindsor, “for the wages of 7 clerks and 7 choristers there.” In this\r\namount, unfortunately, the salaries of the schoolmasters are not given\r\nseparately, nor the number of “the children” or boys attending the\r\nschool. Indeed, beyond the bare fact of its existence we know little of\r\nthe history of St. Anthony’s School up to this time. It comes to light\r\nincidentally in a letter[106] from William Selling, Prior of Canterbury,\r\nto Thomas Bourchier, Cardinal-Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1472. “Please\r\nit your good fatherhood to have in knowledge that, according to your\r\ncommandment, I have provided for a Schoolmaster for your ‘Gramerscole’\r\nin Canterbury, the which hath lately taught grammar at Winchester and\r\nSt. Anthony’s in London, that as I trust to God shall so guide him that\r\nit shall be worship and pleasure to your lordship and profit and\r\nincrease to them that he shall have in governance.” As Archbishop\r\nBourchier’s own nephew, the heir to the earldom of Essex, was a commoner\r\nat Winchester College,[107] this reference to the master of St,\r\nAnthony’s as having been also a master at Winchester, probably usher or\r\nsecond master there, shows that St. Anthony’s School already stood high\r\nin reputation.\r\n\r\nThere is a much more detailed account than that above given in English\r\nfor the year 10 Henry VII., 1494-95, which gives the expenses of the\r\nHospital for the Michaelmas quarter, day by day, being in fact one of\r\nthe “paper books” referred to in the Latin account. It is extremely\r\ninteresting by reason of its details, telling us exactly what the Master\r\nand “the Hall,” _i.e._ clergy and schoolmaster on the one hand, and “the\r\nHospital,” _i.e._ almsfolk and “children,” had for dinner every day. The\r\naccount begins on Michaelmas Day, when two of the traditional geese[108]\r\nwere given to the Hall “at dener” at a cost of 18d., while “the Hospital\r\nand chyldryn” were put off with two loins of veal at 8d. The Master, a\r\nCanon of Windsor, is the only one who is debited with anything for\r\nbreakfast, but that was a substantial one, consisting of a neck of\r\nmutton and chicken. The others presumably only had the commons of bread\r\nand beer. At “soper,” “the Hall” enjoyed ten chickens for 15d, while\r\n“the Hospital and children” had two quarters of mutton for 7d., with a\r\nhalfpenny for “erbis,” or vegetables, and 5d. for “potage fleich”; the\r\nday’s diet cost 4s. 9d. Next day all fared well with seven ribs of roast\r\nbeef and stewed veal at dinner; and three-quarters of mutton at supper.\r\nThe 1st of October there was “potage fleich” and loins of mutton for\r\ndinner; mutton and two “coneys” or rabbits for supper. On the 2nd of the\r\nmonth there was again “pottage flesh,” and pork for dinner, “for all the\r\nhouse”; ten chickens for supper for “the Hall”; mutton for the rest.\r\nFriday, October 3, though it was the feast of the dedication of the\r\nchurch, was no-flesh day. There was a “sewe” for 4d.; twenty plaice for\r\nall the house, twenty small pike, a quarter and a half of roach, and\r\nfresh herrings. The total cost was 9s. 5-1/2d. Presumably there were\r\nstrangers. Saturday was again a no-flesh day. There was milk, 3d., and\r\nbutter, 7d., for dinner, in the form of frumenty probably; salt salmon\r\nfor “the Hall” and stockfish for “the Hospital” at dinner; five barbels\r\nfor “the Hall,” and 100 eggs for “all the house” at supper, while the\r\nMaster had, all to himself, oysters at 1d.\r\n\r\nThe next week began with “half a beeff to lay in powdyr for the weke,\r\n6s. 8d.,” while the Sunday dinner consisted of roast pork for dinner and\r\nmutton for supper. Pork, veal, beef, and mutton, varied with conies and\r\nsoup, and for “the Hall” chickens; meat twice a day, and never the same\r\nat dinner and supper, show that our ancestors lived on a very much more\r\ngenerous and wholesomely varied diet than is commonly supposed. The two\r\nfast days only represented a pleasing change of diet: “Lamprons” or\r\nlampreys “for sew,” bream, fresh herrings and salt salmon on Friday;\r\nmilk and butter “for dinner,” haddocks and whitings, 100 eggs on\r\nSaturday, were really not unsatisfying. The varieties of the fish menu\r\nwere very extensive; it comprised sturgeon, cod, stockfish, fresh\r\nsalmon, haddock, halibut, roach with shrimps (for sauce apparently),\r\ntrout, carp, turbot, plaice, mackerel, thornbacks, gudgeons, guinards,\r\nflounders, smelts, sprats, mussels, crayfish, crabs, lobsters, eels, and\r\nconger eels, besides those already mentioned. On All Saints’ Day, which\r\nfell on a non-fast day, there was a warden-pie for all the house, the\r\nwardens, or pears, which cost 6d., while the flour cost 7d., and the\r\n“serypp” or sirop, 4d. On St. Nicholas’ Day, December 6, there was\r\n“fruit for them that ete no fish,” and 2 lb. of almonds. Among birds,\r\nbesides cocks and fowls, geese frequently appear, with mallards,\r\nplovers, woodcocks, and larks, the latter for the Master’s table only.\r\nBeer as usual flowed in streams. The “good man” of the Swan—the brewery\r\nnext door belonging to the Hospital—supplied for one quarter eighteen\r\nbarrels of “threehalpenny ale,” and ten barrels of penny ale (a penny a\r\ngallon), while another brewer at the Checker supplied fifteen barrels of\r\n1-1/2d., and ten barrels of 1d. beer. Beer, of course, served for\r\nbreakfast and tea as well as dinner and supper. Still the quantity used\r\nwas enormous. At St. Cross Hospital, Winchester, every poor man had a\r\ngallon a day, and at St. Anthony’s the provision must have been on the\r\nsame scale. Wine was only drunk at the Master’s table, and that only on\r\nfeast days.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day everybody had mutton for breakfast. There was a filet\r\nof pork for “force gruel,” six geese and fourteen fowls for all the\r\nhouse at dinner, while “the Hall” had eight conies besides. There were\r\neight plovers, six cocks, and three dozen larks for the Master’s dinner\r\nand supper; and mallards or wild duck for “the Hall,” at supper; a\r\ngallon of cream for the Master’s custard, a gallon of milk for curd. Two\r\nand a half gallons of red wine and “claryet” were drunk. There was\r\ndessert: 4 lb. of “raysons” and currants at 5d.; 2 lb. of great raisins,\r\n2d.; 4 lb. prunes, 8d.; ½ lb. ginger, 10d.; 3 lb. dates, 7-1/2d.; 1\r\nquarter of cloves and mace, 8d.; ½ lb. “saundre,” 7d.; ½ oz. saffron,\r\n8d.; comfits, “counfeits,” 1 lb., 5d.; 4 lb. of almonds, 8d. On Boxing\r\nDay, the Hall had a “pottle of Malmsey to their brawn, 6d.,” and another\r\ngallon and half of wine. On New Year’s Day the Master had, among other\r\nthings, half a lamb; curd for tart, and oranges, which, with butter,\r\ncost 2d. On Twelfth Day, the Epiphany, the whole house enjoyed mutton\r\nand frumenty, made of milk and wheat, for breakfast. Dinner included\r\nfour fillets of pork in mortrews, bake-meats and tarts. But the great\r\nevent was a “wassayle.” To this there went 3 gallons of red wine at 2s.;\r\n3 lb. sugar, 12s.; 2 gallons of “strok” (what was that?); a curd, powder\r\nof cinnamon, ginger and other spices, and pears. It was a mighty brew,\r\nand must have been almost as trying as a Winchester “egg-flip” on\r\nFounder’s Commemoration.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Hospital (besides the Master, who was one of the Canons\r\nappointed for a year, who only resided at intervals) consisted first and\r\nforemost of “Master Nicholas,” the Grammar schoolmaster, at 50s. a\r\nquarter, or £10 a year—being at the same rate of pay as that of the\r\nheadmasters of Winchester and Eton. Then there were four priests, of\r\nwhom the senior, Sir John Galaway, received £4 : 13 : 4 a year, as\r\nagainst £5 a year given to a Fellow of Winchester for performing much\r\nthe same functions, while the three others got £4 a year. A clerk (not\r\ncalled Sir), John Marche, “Maister of the children of the Song-School,”\r\nalso got £4 a year. Then came six clerkes at £2 : 13 : 4 a year each.\r\nThe poor usher, or “oysshur,” of the Grammar School only got 6s. 8d. a\r\nquarter, or £1 : 6 : 8 a year, a sad contrast to the £6 : 13 : 4 of the\r\nusher of Winchester College. It was less than the wages of the cook of\r\nSt. Anthony’s, who got £2 a year, and the same as those of the butler or\r\nbuttery man. Even his name is not given. Probably the explanation is\r\nthat John Goreham, one of the priests, or one of the clerks acted also\r\nas usher. Of course, as was the case at Winchester and Eton, and all the\r\nCollege and Hospital schools, these salaries were in addition to board,\r\nlodging, and “liveries,” or broad cloth for their gowns.\r\n\r\nIn the next extant account, 17 Henry VII., 1502-3, Mr. David was\r\n“skolemaister,” but received only 20s. a quarter, the same as R. Hall\r\n“the maister of Queresters”—a term which the Wykehamist will recognise\r\nas a living word. It looks as if this reduction of the schoolmaster’s\r\nsalary was due to greed on the part of the Dean and Chapter of Windsor,\r\nwho wished to have a larger surplus to put in their own pockets. Rogers\r\nwas the usher, and received 6s. 8d. The livery of the schoolmaster and\r\npriests consisted of 4 yards of cloth at 3s. 4d. a yard, while that of\r\nthe “clerks,” including the Master of the children, was only 3¼ yards,\r\nand the usher’s livery was the same as that of the clerks, sexton, and\r\nbutler, 3 yards at 3s. The 12 “chylder” had 2½ yards at 2s. 4d. It is a\r\nlittle difficult to understand who the twelve children were. In a\r\nsubsequent account for Michaelmas to Christmas 1521, twelve whose names\r\nare given had cloth for gowns; but then comes a heading “For the\r\nchylthern of the Songe Scole,” under which six only out of the twelve\r\nreceived hose and shoes, and had them repaired as well. Are the other\r\nsix to be regarded as scholars in the Grammar School, or, as is perhaps\r\nmore probable, choristers on probation?\r\n\r\nThe next extant account is for 1521-22, when Mr. Ball was the\r\nschoolmaster and Richard-a-Lee the Song schoolmaster. The latter was\r\nsucceeded in 1522 by William Johnson, who, although he got £5 a year as\r\nagainst the Grammar schoolmasters’ £4, was still reckoned on a lower\r\ngrade among the clerks, while the schoolmaster was always ranked with\r\nthe priests. There had apparently been a considerable curtailment in\r\nexpenditure as the surplus handed over to Windsor this year was no less\r\nthan £210, or more than double the sum they derived from it in their\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\nThe next schoolmaster whose name is known was Edmund Johnson. This was\r\nthe “one Johnson,” of Stow’s account of “the spoil of the Hospital,”\r\nwhich is nothing more than a baseless libel. Edmund Johnson, or Jonson,\r\nwas admitted a scholar of Winchester, at the age of eleven, in 1514, and\r\nbecame a Fellow of New College in 1522, remaining such for two years,\r\nand is described in the New College Register as having become “a\r\nschoolmaster.” Whether he was appointed to St. Anthony’s then, there are\r\nno means of knowing. Edmund Johnson was a “clerk” in the Hospital in\r\n1522, and perhaps acted as usher, as no usher’s name is given. He can\r\nhardly be the same man. At all events he is described as “Scolemaster of\r\nthe Grammar Schole in the said Hospitall” in a lease of November 16, 35\r\nHenry VIII., _i.e._ 1543, by the Dean and Chapter to him of a house\r\nfronting “Saint Anthonies yarde,” being, perhaps, the house which had\r\nbeen usually occupied by the Master of the Hospital. The lease contained\r\na reservation “for the use of the Scolemaister for the time then being,”\r\nof “the scolle house and the rome over yt, with the chambre next\r\nadioyning to the same schole.”\r\n\r\nIn 1546, the first of the Acts for the dissolution of colleges and\r\nchantries was passed, and commissioners were appointed under it to\r\ncertify the chantries and their value. They included St. Anthony’s\r\nHospital under the heading of Berkshire, it being treated as part of\r\nWindsor in that county.[109] They reported, on the authority of “Sir\r\nAnthonye Baker, clerk, Master of the Hospital,” that in the parish of\r\nSt. Benedict Fink, London, was “one hospytall of St. Anthony, founded to\r\nfynde one master, 2 prestes, one scolemaster, and 12 pore men there,\r\nperpetually to serve and saye the devyne service and to praye for the\r\nsoules of there founders.” This is the statement which misled Stow and\r\nthe other historians into thinking that the school was part of the\r\noriginal foundation. The correct description of the foundation of Henry\r\nVI.’s time was misread as a description of the original foundation under\r\nHenry III., to which it was wholly inapplicable.\r\n\r\nThe value of the lands and possessions of the Hospital is put in the\r\nchantry certificate at £55 : 6 : 8 gross, with deductions of £4 : 1s.,\r\nbringing it down to £51 : 5 : 8. The stipends of the two priests were £8\r\neach; of the curate of Seynt Benet Fynkes, £8; and of “the clerk that\r\nkeepeth our Lady’s mass,” £9. These four make up the four priests we\r\nfind in the Hospital accounts. The steward received £5, while the poor\r\ncost £31 : 17s.; the “sexten” had £2. The schoolmaster’s stipend was\r\n£16; so that so far from the school being plundered at this time, the\r\nMaster was far better paid than several of his predecessors, and\r\nreceived more than the Masters of Winchester or Eton.\r\n\r\nThe total expenses came to £95 odd. “And so lacketh for the proportion\r\nof the same house £40 : 11 : 11, which ys borne by the Dean and Cannons\r\nof Wyndsore, whereunto this Hospytalle is annexede [and] unytide.” This\r\nis a somewhat slim way of putting the fact that the surplus expenses of\r\nthe Hospital were met by subscriptions from the public to such an\r\namount, that instead of the Dean and Chapter of Windsor defraying the\r\ndeficit out of their own revenues, a sum three or four times as large as\r\nthe whole revenue from endowment of the Hospital found its way into\r\ntheir pockets.\r\n\r\nThe Chantries Dissolution Act of Henry was only permissive, giving the\r\nKing, during his life, power to take possession of any chantries or\r\ncolleges he chose; and advantage was taken of it to enter on barely half\r\na dozen colleges, of which Windsor was not one. In 1547, a new Act of\r\ndissolution of colleges and chantries was passed in Edward VI.’s first\r\nParliament; but Windsor was, alone among colleges that were not\r\neducational, specially exempted from its provisions. There is, however,\r\na certificate, by the Chantry Commissioners of London and Middlesex, for\r\nthe parish of St. Benet Finck, in which, while certifying a chantry in\r\nthe parish church, they say complainingly (the certificates were in fact\r\ndrawn up by the church wardens) that the Dean and Chapter of Windsor “is\r\nparson,” and the value of the same £16, “and but one priest by them\r\nfound to serve the same, which priest is very unhable to serve the\r\nsame.” They add that “within the said parish is a Grammar Scole by the\r\nname of a Fre Scole, called Saynt Anthonies, the Scolemaister whereof is\r\nnowe Maister Edmond Johnson, and his wages paid by the Stewarde of Seynt\r\nAnthonyes, and how muche is not knowen.”\r\n\r\nNow Stow is said to have been born about 1525. He tells us in a passage\r\nwhich is a _locus classicus_ in the history of London schools as much as\r\nthe famous “Description” of Fitzstephen himself, that in his youth,\r\nwhich, for this purpose, we may take to be from 1535 to 1545, the\r\narguing of the schoolboys as to the principles of grammar of which\r\nFitzstephen wrote, was still continued.[110]\r\n\r\n  For I myself in my youth have yearly seen on the eve of St.\r\n  Bartholomew the Apostle, the scholars of divers grammar schools\r\n  repair unto the churchyard of St. Bartholomew, the Priory in\r\n  Smithfield, where, upon a bank, boarded about under a tree, some one\r\n  scholar hath stepped up, and there hath opposed and answered, till\r\n  he were by some better scholar overcome and put down, and then the\r\n  overcomer, taking the place, did like as the first, and in the end\r\n  the best opposers and answerers had rewards; which I observed not\r\n  but it made both good schoolmasters and also good scholars\r\n  diligently against such times to prepare themselves for the\r\n  obtaining of this garland. I remember there repaired to these\r\n  exercises amongst others the Masters and scholars of the free\r\n  schools of St. Paul’s of London, of St. Peter’s of Westminster, of\r\n  St. Thomas Acon’s Hospital and of St. Anthony’s Hospital; whereof\r\n  the last named commonly presented the best scholars and had the\r\n  prize in those days.\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful, for reasons which will appear when we come to deal\r\nwith Westminster and St. Thomas Acon’s, whether Stow’s memory was\r\naccurate when he brought scholars from Westminster and the Mercers’\r\nSchool to St. Bartholomew’s before its dissolution. However that may be,\r\nStow goes on:\r\n\r\n  This Priory of St. Bartholomew being surrendered to Henry VIII.\r\n  those disputations of scholars in that place surceased; and was\r\n  again, only for a year or twain, in the reign of Edward VI., renewed\r\n  in the cloister of Christ’s Hospital, when the best scholars then\r\n  still of St. Anthony’s school, howsoever the same be now fallen both\r\n  in number and estimation, were rewarded with bows and arrows of\r\n  silver given to them by Sir Martin Bowes, goldsmith.\r\n\r\nNow, as Christ’s Hospital was only founded on June 26, 1552, and then,\r\nas we shall see, as a mere Foundlings’ Hospital, and Edward VI. died in\r\nthe following January, there was not time for these renewed contests in\r\nhis reign and Stow’s memory must have been at fault. The resuscitation\r\nof the contests is more likely to have taken place in the reign of Mary\r\nwhen the “old learning” and boy-bishops and the like revived with the\r\n“old religion.” However that may be, the school continued to flourish\r\nunder Elizabeth, on Stow’s own showing.[111]\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless, however, the encouragement failed. The schollers of\r\n  Paules meeting with them of St. Anthonies, would call them “Anthonie\r\n  pigs” and they againe would call the other “Pigeons of Paules,”\r\n  because many pigeons were bred in Paules church, and Saint Anthonie\r\n  was always figured with a pig following him, and, mindfull of the\r\n  former usage, did for a long season disorderly in the open streete\r\n  provoke one another with “Salve tu quoque! placet tibi mecum\r\n  disputare?” “Placet.” And so proceeding from this to questions in\r\n  grammar, they usually fell from wordes to blows, with their satchels\r\n  full of bookes, many times in great heaps, that they troubled the\r\n  streets and passengers; so that finally they were restrained, with\r\n  the decay of St. Anthonies schoole.\r\n\r\nStrype,[112] in his edition of Stow a century later, gives further\r\nevidence:\r\n\r\n  This school kept equal credit with that of Paul’s; both which had\r\n  the greatest reputation in the city in former times. I meet[113]\r\n  with a merry retainer at Queen Elizabeth’s Court, giving an account\r\n  of the great entertainment she had in her progress, anno 1575, at\r\n  Kenilworth Castle by the Earl of Leicester: “I went to school\r\n  forsooth both at Polles and also at St. Antoniez! In the 5th form\r\n  past Æsop’s fables, I wiz; read Terence, ‘Vos, isthœc intro\r\n  auferte,’ and began with my Virgil ‘Tityre tu patulae.’ I could\r\n  [_i.e._ knew] my Rules: and could construe and pars with the best of\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\nStrype tells us also how this school used at a certain time of the year\r\nto go in procession. “Thus I find in the year 1562 on the 15th day of\r\nSeptember there set out from Mile End 200 children of this St. Anthonies\r\nSchool, all well be-seen, and so along through Algate down Cornhill to\r\nthe Stocks and so to the Freer Austins, with streamers and flags and\r\ndrums beating. And after, every child went home to their fathers and\r\nfriends.” This September outing was an old custom in schools. It was for\r\na nut gathering. It appears in the accounts of St. Anthony’s on\r\nSeptember 3, 1510, when “a sporting day in the cuntre” cost “the\r\nHospital” 18d., the almsmen and choristers being entertained at home for\r\n7d. William Malim mentions it as one of the Eton holidays in 1560;\r\nindeed, the drums and flags strongly suggest the Eton “montem.” Payments\r\nfor such an outing occur frequently in the accounts of Winchester\r\nCollege. It forms the subject of a “theme” at Winchester by Christopher\r\nJohnson, Headmaster in 1560-70. As late as 1711[114] “nutting-money” was\r\none of the regular payments exacted from Winchester scholars.\r\n\r\nStow’s story of the suppression of the street-shows of the scholars is\r\nborne out by the curious injunction issued by the Lord Mayor on August\r\n20, 1561.[115]\r\n\r\n  Item, yt was agreyd that precepts shall forthewith be made to every\r\n  one of my maisters the Aldermen for the stayinge of all\r\n  skolemaysters and teacher of youthe within this cytye from makynge\r\n  of eny more musters or commen and open shewes of theyr skollers,\r\n  within the said cyttye or without, in ryche apparrell or otherwyse,\r\n  eyther on horseback or on foote, upon payne of imprysonment.\r\n\r\nEdmund Johnson above mentioned became a Canon of Windsor in 1560 and\r\napparently died in 1562.[116] So that the school was in fact at the\r\nheight of its fame and success under the very man whom Stow accuses of\r\nhaving ruined it. Its fame and greatness outlived its so-called spoiler.\r\nEdmund Johnson, so far from being considered a spoiler of school, ought\r\nto be enrolled among the many great schoolmasters whom Winchester\r\nproduced, along with Christopher Johnson, the witty Latin poet, who\r\nruled over Winchester itself at the same time (1558-68) and was perhaps\r\na relation.\r\n\r\nAmong the archives of St. Paul’s Cathedral is a stray account of St.\r\nAnthony’s Hospital for the year 1564, and it shows both almshouse and\r\nschool going on; the twelve almspeople duly receiving their shilling a\r\nweek and the “Instructor of the school (scolarum) in grammar” his due\r\nstipend of £16 a year.\r\n\r\nAfter Johnson’s departure a fall may have taken place in the character\r\nof the school, but if so, that was not his fault. Strype indeed goes out\r\nof his way to correct Stow, and carefully tells us[117] that “it was in\r\nbeing in Elizabeth’s time when one Hilton a great and good man was\r\nmaster.” He must have succeeded Johnson. In 1584 another master, Thomas\r\nBrowne, was schoolmaster and receiver of the Hospital, as one of his\r\naccounts[118] remaining shows. He duly paid twelve almsfolk 7s. a week\r\nand his own wages £16, besides £1 for himself as receiver.\r\n\r\nEven as to its then state and the state of the Hospital itself, there is\r\nreason to believe that Stow’s information was wrong and was probably\r\nderived from a tainted source. For in 1590 a determined attack on the\r\nHospital was made by one of the band of informers who infested the\r\nreigns of Elizabeth and James I. It was a favourite device for some\r\nspeculative attorney or money-lender to hunt up old monastic or chantry\r\nlands, allege that they had been confiscated to the Crown under the Acts\r\nfor the dissolution of monasteries or of chantries, as the case might\r\nbe, but had been concealed from it by the tenants, or other holders; and\r\nto obtain a grant from the Crown of such concealed lands by letters\r\npatent. Sometimes these patents were in the form of roving commissions\r\nfor concealed lands over whole counties, sometimes for all the\r\npossessions of specific monasteries or chantries, sometimes for specific\r\nlands belonging to such foundations. The Crown in any case gained the\r\ncash paid down for the grant. The informer, if he recovered the whole\r\nproperty, made an enormous gain. More often he only levied blackmail on\r\nthe proprietor, who was glad for a moderate payment to escape the\r\ntrouble and vexation of a law suit, with the Crown as nominal plaintiff.\r\nThe practice went on as late as 1620, when a too determined attack on\r\nthe chantry lands of the City Livery Companies induced the Companies to\r\ncombine and pay the Crown a sum down for quiet possession of the lands\r\nand for an Act of Parliament which stopped all further proceedings for\r\nconcealed lands. The facts of the St. Anthony’s case are these:—\r\n\r\nIn 1589 Edward Wymarke and John Leake obtained from Queen Elizabeth a\r\ngrant by letters patent of all the lands of St. Anthony’s Hospital, as\r\nlands which had properly passed to the Crown, but had been “concealed”\r\nby the Dean and Chapter of Windsor.\r\n\r\nThey then brought an action for ejectment in the Queen’s Bench against\r\nTimothy Lucy, gentleman, and Thomas Cooper, farmers of the manors of\r\nValence Galant and Easthall and other lands in Essex. The Dean and\r\nChapter took counter action by a Bill on the Equity side of the Court of\r\nExchequer to restrain further proceedings in the ejectment. Leake\r\nalleged that the Dean and Chapter “compounded with the poor and put them\r\nout of their houses, and others that would not remain in a corner there\r\nuntil their end.” The church was shut up and “so remained until it was\r\nappointed to the French nation, long in Her Majesty’s time.” “The School\r\nwas no more a Free School; but the Master had £16 per annum allowed him,\r\nand compounded with the parents of the children to be taught there, at\r\nhis pleasure; and now of late the curate of the parish church is farmer\r\nof the parsonage and master of the school and a preacher abroad, and by\r\nreason of his other calling there are now very few scholars, the master\r\nnot employed, a bad room to dwell in and a school in name, but not free\r\nor of credit.”\r\n\r\nThe patentees, however, generously offered that if the Lord Treasurer\r\nshould think “that in passing the patent Her Majesty was hardly dealt\r\nwith in it, or your zeal for the school to be maintained which is no\r\nFree School, so your Honour would procure from Her Majesty a foundation\r\nand take the patronage. I can be content there go a better maintenance\r\nto the Master, viz. £30 per annum or more, or to do any act your Honour\r\nshould think conscionable.”\r\n\r\nThe Dean and Chapter in their answer did not deny that they had\r\ndiminished the number of priests, clerks, choristers, and scholars in\r\nthe Hospital, but urged that they no longer got £323 a year as they used\r\nto do “by begging,” but now spent more on the Hospital by twenty nobles\r\na year at least than they received. As to the School they said “the\r\nSchoolmaster teacheth as many freely as his grant bindeth him unto, for\r\nit was never free for all that come thither, but only for the poorer\r\nsort.” The schoolmaster himself, Mr. Brown, put in a separate answer. He\r\nalleged that “the School was never free to all comers, but only for the\r\nchoristers of the house and all such other destitute children; as may be\r\ngathered by sundry ancient accompts. The Schoolmaster is bound by the\r\nwords of his patent to entertain 40 poor scholars, whose friends are not\r\nable to pay for their teaching, if so many come, and offer their\r\nchildren to be taught freely.” He said that he had never refused any who\r\nclaimed to be free. As for compounding, that was granted him, in regard\r\nthat the revenues of the house will neither allow him an usher, nor his\r\ndiet, as his predecessors had, among the priests. He denied that he was\r\ncurate of the church as well as schoolmaster, though he acknowledged\r\nthat having “the lease of the appropriation come into his hands he\r\nthought himself bound to do some duty in the church as well as in the\r\nschool, and therefore entered the ministry the sooner.” “Neither,” he\r\nremarked, “is it so strange or odious a matter for a schoolmaster to be\r\na preacher as it seemeth in Mr. Leake’s eyes,” though in this we may\r\nfairly say that Mr. Leake’s eyes were more far-seeing than the\r\nparson-schoolmaster’s. Then he pays a tribute to his predecessor. “This\r\nplace prospered well enough under a schoolmaster who was also a\r\npreacher, Mr. Edmund Johnson. But then there was some hope that learning\r\nand religion might be rewarded; but the daily decreasing and falling\r\naway of which reward, as by other sinister means so most apparently by\r\nconcealments” (this was a side blow at Mr. Leake), “hath discouraged\r\nparents to bring up their sons at their book, but even in the\r\nUniversities also at this day, more is the pity.” He then utters the\r\ncomplaint which the unsuccessful schoolmaster, like the unsuccessful in\r\nall professions, has always made, and makes, that there is too much\r\ncompetition. “If there be fewer scholars in S. Anthony’s than have been\r\nheretofore, the true cause thereof has to be imputed to the multitude of\r\nteachers in every corner both of the city and country, and to the wonted\r\nreward of learning, and not to the want of diligence in the schoolmaster\r\nthere.” Finally, he challenges the facts. “If trial be made it may be\r\nthat both the number and the learning of his scholars may fall out\r\nbetter than Mr. Leake would have it.”\r\n\r\nThe end of the whole matter was that it was referred to Her Majesty’s\r\nGeneral Attorney, Sir John Pepham, and the Solicitor General, Thomas\r\nGerton. They certified that as the grant of Edward IV., confirmed by\r\nInnocent the Pope, had made the Hospital unconditionally a possession of\r\nSt. George’s College, the purchasers from Her Majesty ought not to\r\nmolest the Dean and Canons or any of their Governors in the said lands.\r\nSo Mr. Leake and his friends took nothing by their pains.\r\n\r\nNot many years later, however, the Chapter, on the ground that the\r\nHospital cost more than they got from it, tried to withhold payment of\r\nthe scholarship fund from Oriel College. This roused Oriel to look up\r\nthe documents, and they counterclaimed not merely the customary £10 :\r\n8s. but the whole twenty-five marks of the original grants and\r\nthreatened to enter on the Essex lands if it was not paid. Thereon the\r\nWindsor Chapter filed a Bill in chancery. Lord Keeper Bacon’s decree,\r\nNovember 17, 1617, founded on an award of Sir Henry Savile, T. Frith, a\r\ncanon of Windsor, and Joshua Sanders, confirmed the right of Oriel to\r\nsome payment; but in the absence of any proof from Oriel that they had\r\never received more, and the presence of proof on the part of Windsor\r\nthat since they became possessed of St. Anthony’s they had never paid\r\nmore, the decree was for £10 : 8s. a year only. Windsor paid £30 for\r\ncosts. The sum of £10 : 8s. a year is still paid to Oriel College by\r\nWindsor College, though it is to be feared that not many scholars are\r\nnow maintained by the payment.\r\n\r\nIn 1600 St. Anthony’s School must have been in very low water. A curious\r\ncompact was made by Mr. Thomas Smith, the schoolmaster in that year,\r\nwith Mr. Thomas Bradshaw. The latter was to come to the school with “a\r\ndozen of his own scholars at the least” and to teach all the poor\r\nchildren in the parish of St. Benet Finck “being offered and brought\r\nunto him according to the limitation of the patent,” and hold the office\r\nof teacher or master conjointly with Mr. T. Smith, taking all the\r\nprofits of his own pupils, while Mr. Smith was to take the profit on\r\nthose brought in by him. Neither was to interfere with the teaching or\r\nmanagement of the other’s scholars, except in case one of them was ill\r\nor absent, when the other was to teach the whole school. The scholars\r\nbelonging to either were to be placed equally on both sides of the\r\nschool. Finally, on payment at any time of £10 by Bradshaw, he was to\r\nhave an assignment of Smith’s patent and place. The Chapter do not seem\r\nto have relished this bargain, as there are some notes attached to this\r\nagreement as to the terms of the original grant to Smith, which included\r\na condition to appoint a deputy, and to teach free as many children as\r\nwere brought thither up to forty; and to keep a register of such free\r\nscholars, to be exhibited to the Dean whenever required, and it is\r\nremarked that the arrangement with Bradshaw was a breach of these\r\nconditions. A draft surrender of the mastership by Smith, May 1, 43\r\nElizabeth (1601), is with this paper. It was not, however, executed by\r\nhim, as ten years afterwards he is found still keeping the Hospital\r\naccounts as receiver and paying himself “pro informatione scholarium.”\r\nIn 1622-23 William Walker acted in the same capacity as receiver and\r\nschoolmaster, and duly paid himself and twelve almsmen and women their\r\nstipends. In 1661-62, the latest account preserved shows him still\r\nacting in the double capacity, but receiving the augmented salary of £25\r\na year.\r\n\r\nIn 1666 St. Anthony’s was burnt with the rest of London. The church was\r\nrebuilt after the Fire for the French Church, and still continues. But\r\nthe school seems never to have been rebuilt, and when Strype published\r\nhis edition of _Stow_ in 1720 it no longer existed. So ended this once\r\nfamous school.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now return from the later history of St. Anthony’s School to its\r\nbeginning. It was founded, as we have seen, in 1441. Five years\r\nafterwards there is a series of documents which are evidence of some\r\nstruggle going on in regard to education in London, the exact purport\r\nand the result of which are equally obscure. All we know is that on May\r\n3, 24 Henry VI., _i.e._ 1446, a writ of Privy Seal was sent to the\r\nChancellor directing him to issue letters patent, which was duly done on\r\nMay 6, dealing with schools in London. The letters patent are of course\r\nin Latin, in which language they long remained, but the Privy Seal,\r\nwhich is verbatim to the same effect, was in English. It begins by a\r\nrecital which is almost an echo of the Petition to Parliament in 1394.\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London “considered the\r\ngreat ‘abusions’ that have been of long time in London, that many and\r\ndivers persons not sufficiently instructed in grammar presumed to hold\r\ncommon grammar schools in great deceit of their scholars, as also of the\r\nfriends that find them to school,” and so they had “in their great\r\nwisdom” devised a remedy. They had ordained 5 schools of grammar and “no\r\nmoo” within the said city; “one within the churchyard of St. Paul;\r\nanother within the collegiate church of St. Martin; the third in Bow\r\nChurch (Beate Marie de Arcubus, in the Letters Patent); the fourth in\r\nthe church of St. Dunstan in the East; the 5th in our hospital of St.\r\nAnthony within our said city.” This they had openly declared by their\r\nletters patent thereupon made. The King, therefore, ordered his letters\r\npatent to be made confirming the letters of the bishops, and commanding\r\n“all our subjittes of our said citee “that they, nor none of them,\r\ntrouble nor impeach the masters of the said schools in any wise in this\r\n“partie,” but rather help and assist them inasmuch as in them is. The\r\nletters patent were duly issued on the day the writ of Privy Seal was\r\ndelivered, as the Act of Parliament required. This patent was\r\nmisinterpreted by Stow[119] as creating schools “besides St. Paul’s” in\r\nthe places named, only he puts St. Dunstan on the West for St. Dunstan\r\nin the East. He repeats this error[120] apropos of Bow Church, which he\r\nsays was a grammar school by commandment of Henry VI., whereas, as we\r\nhave seen, it existed before the reign of Henry II. Stow then goes on:\r\n“And in the next year, to wit 1394 (_sic_), the said King ordained by\r\nParliament that four other Grammar schools should be created.” It is\r\ncurious that in all the editions till Strype’s this extraordinary error\r\nof making 1394 the next year to 1446 was repeated. No doubt Stow had\r\nbecome acquainted with the ordinance of Richard II. and mixed it up with\r\nthat of Henry VI. and never noticed the confusion. It is the case that\r\nin February 1446/7 an ordinance was made in Parliament about London\r\nschools. It was founded upon a very remarkable petition. The full wise\r\nand discreet Commons were asked “to consider the great number of Grammar\r\nSchools that sometime were in divers parts of the realm, beside those\r\nthat were in London and how few ‘ben in these days.’ This,” they say,\r\n“causes great hurt not only in the spiritual part of the church, where\r\noften times it appears too openly in some persons with great shame”—we\r\nfeel inclined to call Name, name!—“but also in temporal part, to whom it\r\nis full expedient to have competent congruity for many causes”—whatever\r\nthat may mean. The petitioners go on to point out how London is “the\r\ncommon concourse of this land,” not only for Londoners born, but for\r\nothers who come up, “some for lack of schoolmasters in their own\r\ncountry, and some for the great alms of Lords, Merchants and others,” so\r\nthat many poor creatures would never have gained the “virtue and\r\ncunning” they have without such alms. Therefore they say it is desirable\r\nto have in London “a sufficient number of Schools and good Informers of\r\nGrammar” (the headmaster of Winchester’s title is _Magister\r\nInformator_), “and not for the singular avail of 2 or 3 persons,\r\ngrievously to hurt the multitude of young people of all this London.”\r\n“For where,” they sententiously observe, “there is a great number of\r\nlearners and few teachers, and all the learners be compelled to go to\r\nthe same few teachers, and to no other, the Masters wax rich in money,\r\nand the learners poor in cunning, as experience openly shows, against\r\nall virtue and order of weal public.”\r\n\r\nFour parsons, Mr. William Lichfield of All Hallows the Great, Thames\r\nStreet; Mr. Gilbert (Worthington) of St. Andrew’s in Holborn, suburb of\r\nthe City; Mr. John Cole of St. Peter’s, Cornhill; and John Neell of St.\r\nMary Abchurch, and Master of St. Thomas Acon’s Hospital, were, they say,\r\nstirred to devotion and pity by such considerations, and therefore asked\r\nthat the rectors and their successors in their respective parishes may\r\n“ordain, create, establish and set a person sufficiently learned in\r\ngrammar, and there to teach to all that will learn” with power of\r\nremoval and new appointment in the rectors. The answer was “The King\r\nwills that it be do as it is desired, so that it be done by the advice\r\nof the Ordinary, or else of the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time\r\nbeing.”\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that these schools were set up accordingly. Stow\r\nstates it for a fact as to St. Peter’s, Cornhill,[121] St. Andrew’s,\r\nHolborn,[122] and St. Thomas of Acon’s Hospital,[123] and has been\r\nfollowed by other writers. It is doubtful if a single one of these\r\nschools was ever established, except that in St. Thomas of Acon’s\r\nHospital. The very unusual form of the King’s answer to the petition at\r\nonce raises suspicion. The first clause of it is the common formula for\r\nconsent to a “private” bill, “Le roi fait comme il est desiré.” But it\r\nis followed by the very significant condition “so that it be by the\r\nadvice of the Ordinary, the Bishop of London, or the Archbishop.” A veto\r\nwas thus given to the very two officials who, doubtless under much the\r\nsame pressure, had, only the year before, limited the schools in London\r\nto five: of which three were immemorial, that of St. Anthony’s Hospital\r\nin an exempt place of the Crown’s patronage was already established with\r\nthe consent of the Bishop, and the fifth St. Dunstan’s was, like St.\r\nMary-le-Bow, a “peculiar” of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is not\r\nvery likely, therefore, that the Archbishop and Bishop would be eager to\r\nassist in almost doubling the number of authorised schools in London. As\r\nregards St. Andrew’s and All Hallows the Great it is practically certain\r\nthat no school was ever established. The two petitioning parsons of\r\nthese churches both died very soon afterwards. The will of Gilbert\r\nWorthington of St. Andrew’s, Holborn, is given in Strype’s edition of\r\n_Stow_.[124] It was made July 28, 1447, and was proved on August 12\r\nfollowing. The only reference to schools or education in it is a bequest\r\nof five marks to his brother Walter to put him to school, and 40s. to\r\nthe poor scholars of God’s House in Cambridge, just founded by Bingham.\r\nThe inscription on his tomb, also preserved,[125] makes no mention of\r\nany school foundation. Neither Stow nor any one else states that there\r\nwas any evidence of a school at St. Andrew’s. The date of the death of\r\nthe parson of All Hallows, William Lichfield, is not given by Newcourt\r\nin the _Repertorium_, but as it there appears that Thomas Westleigh,\r\nS.T.B., was appointed to the rectory, vacant on the death of Lichfield,\r\non November 1448, he must have died some time before that date. No proof\r\nof any grammar school having been kept here has yet been produced.\r\n\r\nWhether a school was established in St. Thomas’s Hospital is also\r\ndoubtful. There is no trace of such a school in the documents published\r\nby Sir John Watney in his account of the Hospital, privately printed by\r\nthe Mercers Company in 1592. The Hospital was surrendered to King Henry\r\nVIII., October 20, 1538. The Mercers Company, whose hall was next door\r\nand who had used its church for their purposes, almost immediately,\r\nDecember 18, 1538, opened negotiations with the King to buy it. On April\r\n21, 1541, the King sold it to them for £969 : 17 : 6, an enormous sum,\r\nequivalent to some £20,000 of our money, subject to the conditions that\r\nthey should keep three chaplains to pray for his soul, and also a Free\r\nGrammar School with a sufficient master to teach 25 children and\r\nscholars freely for ever. This was the origin of the Mercers’ School,\r\nand this alone is the reason for supposing that there had been a grammar\r\nschool in the Hospital before. Until the Mercers allow their records to\r\nbe ransacked by some expert with an eye open to the evidence as to\r\nschools, it is impossible to assert that there was or was not a school\r\nin the Hospital. It is strange, if there was, that no evidence has yet\r\nbeen forthcoming of its existence. The verdict must be, for the present\r\nat least, that its existence is not proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX I\r\n\r\n                           THE CITY COMPANIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 1880, the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the\r\nCity Companies issued a circular addressed to all the Companies. This\r\ncircular sought information on the various points as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n\r\n                         FOUNDATION AND OBJECT\r\n\r\n  Return A.—A statement of the date, ascertained or probable, of the\r\n  foundation of the Company, and of the circumstances, so far as they\r\n  can be discovered from its documents of foundation or archives, in\r\n  which the Company had its origin.\r\n\r\n  Return B.—A list of the charters, charters of inspeximus, and other\r\n  instruments of a similar nature whether originals or copies, which\r\n  have been at any time in the possession of the Company, together\r\n  with an abstract of the purport of each, regard being specially had\r\n  to any evidence which it may contain as to the object of the\r\n  foundation of the Company.\r\n\r\n  Return C.—A list of any trust deeds “founding, regulating, or\r\n  affecting” the Company, with the date of each, the names of the\r\n  parties thereto, and an abstract of the purport of each.\r\n\r\n  Return D.—A list with dates of any “decrees of Court,” whether of\r\n  the Courts of Common Law or of Chancery, or of any acts of the\r\n  Courts of Aldermen or of Common Council, “regulating or affecting”\r\n  the Company, with a statement of the effect of each decision.\r\n\r\n  Return E.—A list of any other documents, not included in the\r\n  descriptions in the preceding returns, which “found, regulate, or\r\n  affect” the Company, with dates and an abstract of the effect of\r\n  each.\r\n\r\n  Return F.—A concise history of the Company from the time of its\r\n  foundation to the present day, with special reference to the inquiry\r\n  contained in the commission as to “the objects for which the Company\r\n  was founded,” and “how far those objects are now being carried into\r\n  effect.”\r\n\r\n  Return G.—Has the Company a licence in mortmain? When was such\r\n  licence granted (referring to the document by description)? What is\r\n  its extent, and to what extent is it now unexhausted?\r\n\r\n  Return H.—Is there vested in the Company and how, whether by\r\n  charter, statute, order of the Court of Aldermen, act of Common\r\n  Council, or otherwise, any right of exercising superintendence over\r\n  or any duty or discretion to encourage in any way any and what art,\r\n  trade, or business? State the nature and local limits of such\r\n  control. In what manner and to what extent is such control now\r\n  exercised? If such control is not now exercised, state the\r\n  circumstances under which its exercise has fallen into desuetude.\r\n\r\n  Return I.—A list of the charities, eleemosynary, educational or\r\n  otherwise, which are under the management of the Company, stating in\r\n  each case the name of the founder, the date and nature of the\r\n  benefaction, its original and its present value as regards both\r\n  capital and income, and the purposes to which the funds have been\r\n  applied for each of the last preceding ten years.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the twelve Great Companies have been published (1884) in\r\na Blue Book. I had prepared at first to transcribe certain portions of\r\nthese returns from each Company; but the information after all belongs\r\nto bodies which are private rather than public. One can understand that\r\na Company may on the whole desire not to set forth all its sources of\r\nincome, nor its methods of expenditure. The Company of Grocers indeed\r\nentered their protest against an inquiry by the Crown, “without the\r\nauthority of Parliament, into what has been judicially declared to be\r\nprivate property,” as being “without precedent, arbitrary, and a breach\r\nof the liberties of the subject.” Moreover, the returns are so\r\nvoluminous that even an abridgment of the figures would occupy far more\r\nspace than it is possible to give. They may therefore remain in the Blue\r\nBook open for the examination of any person curious to read them, and\r\ncompetent to understand them. For the purpose of this work an epitome of\r\nthe history of each Company, and of the privileges of a Liveryman will\r\nbe quite sufficient. And for these I am indebted mainly to the Report of\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER\r\n\r\nThe following is the chronological order in which the various Companies\r\nobtained their charters of Incorporation.

The Dyers, for instance, are twelfth; the Fullers,\r\nChirurgeons, Foystors, Grey Tanners, Spurriers and Wire Sellers have\r\ngone; and there are only sixty in the former to ninety-three in the\r\nlatter list.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the second list with that at the present time, we find\r\nthat no new Companies have been formed, but that the following have\r\ndisappeared from the list:—\r\n\r\n Woolpackers.\r\n Woodmongers.\r\n Long Bowstring Makers.\r\n Silk-Throwsters.\r\n Starchmakers.\r\n Pinmakers.\r\n Combmakers.\r\n Surgeons.\r\n Carmen.\r\n Fishermen.\r\n Hatband Makers.\r\n Porters.\r\n Silkmen.\r\n Soapmakers.\r\n Tobacco-pipe Makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ASSOCIATIONS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED.\r\n\r\nGood service has been done to the history of City Gilds, Fraternities,\r\nand Associations by Hazlitt in his list of “Voluntary Associations which\r\nhave disappeared.” The voluntary associations include, however, a great\r\nmany which were gilds and even chartered companies, _e.g._ the Parish\r\nClerks, incorporated as a Fraternity by Henry III., and as a Company by\r\nJames I. I subjoin a mere list, referring the reader to Hazlitt for his\r\nhistorical notes.\r\n\r\n White and Brown Bakers.\r\n Bladesmiths and Bladers.\r\n Blockmakers.\r\n Bracelers or Bracemakers.\r\n Burillers.\r\n Cappers.\r\n Carmen.\r\n Cheesemongers.\r\n Combmakers.\r\n Orders of the Ropery.\r\n Free Fishermen.\r\n Forcers or Casketmakers.\r\n Fullers.\r\n Furbishers.\r\n Gardeners.\r\n Hatband Makers.\r\n Hatters.\r\n Heamers.\r\n Histolen and Haymongers.\r\n Hurers, Hurriers or Milliners.\r\n Linen Drapers.\r\n Marblers.\r\n Parish Clerks.\r\n Pepperers.\r\n Pinners.\r\n Planers.\r\n Porters.\r\n Pouchmakers.\r\n Pursers or Glovers Pursers.\r\n Shearman or Returnders.\r\n Sawyers.\r\n Sheathers.\r\n Shivers.\r\n Silkmen.\r\n Silk-throwers or Throwsters.\r\n Soapers.\r\n Spicers.\r\n Spurriers.\r\n Starchmakers.\r\n Stockfishmongers.\r\n Stringers.\r\n Surgeons.\r\n Tapissers.\r\n Grey Thwyers or Tanners.\r\n White Thwyers.\r\n Tobacco-pipe Makers.\r\n Vinegar Makers.\r\n Watermen.\r\n Woodmongers.\r\n Woolpackers.\r\n\r\nIn the body of the book are incorporated accounts of all those Companies\r\nwhich have Halls. These accounts are given as the Halls are met with in\r\nperambulation. Below there follows a complete list of all existing\r\nCompanies, whether with or without Halls, page references being given to\r\nthose already described.\r\n\r\n _The Apothecaries._ See p. 204.\r\n\r\n _The Bakers._ See p. 274.\r\n\r\n _The Armourers._ See p. 65.\r\n\r\n _The Barbers._ See p. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BASKETMAKERS\r\n\r\nThis Company is interesting because it has no charter, but is a\r\nFraternity “by Prescription,” as Maitland says. It is not one of those\r\nmentioned in Stow’s list as having been present at the Mayor’s Feast of\r\nthe year 1532. And Strype, though he includes it among the Companies,\r\ngives no account of it. The association was recognised by the Mayor’s\r\nCourt, 1569, and again in 1602-1603. It was also one of the Companies\r\nwhich subscribed to the Irish Estate in 1615. There is no Hall. The\r\nnumber of the Livery is limited to 30. The Company stated to the\r\nCommissioners that they have never been in possession of houses, lands,\r\nor other property.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BLACKSMITHS\r\n\r\nThis craft, like that of the Basketmakers, is one of the earliest arts\r\nlearned by man after the discovery of the metals. The Fraternity of the\r\nBlacksmiths must, therefore, have existed from the time when workmen\r\nfirst began to work together and to form associations. The trade is\r\ngregarious. It requires the collective labour of several to conduct the\r\nfurnace, to beat and to mould the metal, to design, to shape the metal\r\nin the rough, to make the instruments, etc. As the Blacksmiths are not\r\nenumerated among the “adulterine” Gilds under Henry II., we may conclude\r\nthat they were recognised as of long standing even then.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1372 (Riley’s _Memorials_, p. 361) “the reputable men of the\r\nTrade” delivered to the mayor and aldermen their Articles. We learn from\r\nthese that the places of sale or market for blacksmiths was Gracechurch\r\nStreet, the Pavement by St. Nicholas Fleshambles (Newgate Street), or\r\nnear the Tun upon Cornhill; that every Master should place his mark upon\r\nhis work; and that no one was to be free of the trade till he could show\r\nthat he was able to follow it.\r\n\r\nThis Company is reputed to have been incorporated by prescription by\r\nKing Edward III. in the year 1325.\r\n\r\nIt was incorporated by charter, and united to the Spurriers by Queen\r\nElizabeth in the year 1571, under which charter, confirmed by King\r\nCharles I. in the year 1639, power was given to make bye-laws; certain\r\nbye-laws so made were confirmed by the Lord Treasurer and by the Chief\r\nJustices of the King’s Bench, and the Common Pleas, December 1640, and\r\nunder such charter and bye-laws the Company is now, as far as the usages\r\nof the present day permit, carried on.\r\n\r\nBy the charter of King Charles I., “power to make reasonable laws and\r\nordinances in writing for the good rule, governing, and correcting of\r\nthe freemen of the said arts or mysteries within the City of London and\r\nfour miles of the said City.”\r\n\r\nMaitland, writing in 1750, says: “They have a pleasant Hall in Lambeth\r\nHill.”\r\n\r\nThe Company has now no Hall; its Corporate Income is about £700; its\r\nTrust Income is £136; the number of its Livery is 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BOWYERS\r\n\r\nThe making of bows, like the use of the smithy, was so ancient that\r\nthere must have been a Fraternity of Bowyers in very early times. They\r\nexisted as a Company by prescription, and, which is strange, they\r\nreceived no charter of incorporation until the year 1620, when bows and\r\narrows were quite superseded by firearms.\r\n\r\nRiley tells us that in the year 1871 (_Memorials_, p. 348) the Bowyers\r\nand the Fletchers (Makers of Arrows) entered into a friendly\r\nunderstanding that they would not meddle with the trade of each other,\r\nexcepting four men named, who would not assent and stood out. These were\r\nbrought before the mayor and explained that they had apprentices to both\r\ncrafts; that they had orders in both kinds to execute; and that they\r\nasked for time, which was granted with a warning.\r\n\r\nIf bows are useless without arrows they are equally so without strings.\r\nIn the year 1416 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 435) the “reputable men of the\r\ntrade of Stringers,” _i.e._ Bowstring Makers, waited on the mayor; they\r\nrepresented the necessity of looking after the workmanship of\r\nbowstrings, and they prayed for leave to appoint Wardens of their own\r\nwith power to inspect the trade, which was granted. By these examples we\r\nperceive that there were Companies which were recognised by the City,\r\nand continued working together with authority over the trade for\r\ncenturies. It is not clear whether they had the right of holding\r\nproperty. But they could, and did, impose penalties and fines upon\r\nevildoers in their trade.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the Royal Commission:\r\n\r\nThe Company has a charter dated the 25th May 1621, which was confirmed\r\nby another dated the 17th November 1668.\r\n\r\nThe following is an abstract of the purport of these charters:—\r\n\r\n1. The style of this Company is the Master, Wardens, and Society of the\r\nMystery of Bowyers of the City of London.\r\n\r\n2. James I. by his charter reciting that the Bowyers of the City of\r\nLondon using the art or mystery of making of long bows, were an ancient\r\nFraternity in the City, but who had fallen into decay, and that the king\r\nbeing willing as much as in him did lie to restore the ancient and\r\nlaudable exercise of archery with the long bow unto the end that the\r\nsaid Fraternity might with better encouragement practise their trade\r\ngrants, that the Bowyers of London, and all and every person and persons\r\nthen using or who shall thereafter use the mystery of making long bows\r\nin the City of London and liberties thereof, and being freemen of the\r\nsaid City, and then free of the said Fraternity, or hereafter to be made\r\nfree, should be a body politic and corporate by the before-mentioned\r\nname or style.\r\n\r\nThe charter grants that they shall be governed by one Master, two\r\nWardens, and thirteen Assistants, and the first Master, Wardens, and ten\r\nof the first Assistants are thereby named and appointed the first Master\r\nand Wardens, to continue in office until the Thursday next after the\r\nfeast of St. James the Apostle, 1622, and from thence until others\r\nshould be elected pursuant to the charter; and the Assistants, during\r\ntheir natural lives, or until removed, and for the future election of\r\nthese officers is granted that the Master, Wardens, and Assistants, or\r\nthe greater part of them from time to time thereafter, upon Thursday\r\nnext after the feast of St. James the Apostle, 1622, may nominate and\r\nchoose one fit person of the Assistants to be Master and two to be\r\nWardens, who are to execute their offices for two whole years thence\r\nnext ensuing, and in case of death or removal otherwise to be chosen\r\nwithin fourteen days.\r\n\r\nThe charter gives to the Wardens and Assistants power to elect a clerk\r\nand beadle to hold office during pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe charter further declares that all freemen of the Company, and all\r\npersons of the Mystery within three miles of the City of London and the\r\nsuburbs thereof, shall be contributory to the Company, and shall also\r\npay a quarterage of 8d. per quarter or 2s. 8d. per year. This charter,\r\nor the enrolment thereof, was exemplified and confirmed by Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe charter gives the power of making bye-laws to the Master, Wardens,\r\nand Assistants, or the greater part of them.\r\n\r\nThe Bowyers are now a small Company with a Livery of 25; an Income of\r\n£550; property on Trust valued at £40 a year.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that so little was the decline in the use of\r\nthe bow understood in the sixteenth century that in the year 1560 a\r\nfixed price was imposed on the bow, viz. of 6s. 8d. each for the best,\r\n3s. 4d. for the second best, and for the inferior qualities 2s.\r\n\r\nThe Company formerly had a Hall by “the corner of Monkswell Street,”\r\naccording to Stow; but according to Strype it was upon St. Peter’s Hill,\r\nin the ward of Castle Baynard. After the Fire, he says, the Bowyers met\r\nin some public-house for the conduct of their affairs. The _City\r\nDirectory_ says their Hall formerly stood in Noble Street, and was\r\ndestroyed in the Great Fire.\r\n\r\n _The Brewers._ See p. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BRODERERS\r\n\r\nThe first charter of the Broderers or Embroiderers was granted by\r\nElizabeth in 1561. This was confirmed by James I., and the Company was\r\nre-incorporated by James II. in 1686. At one time during the reign of\r\nCharles I. the trade in embroidery was at so low an ebb that a “great\r\npart of the Company for want of employment are constrained to become\r\nporters, water-bearers, and the like.”\r\n\r\nThe Company’s Hall was formerly in Gutter Lane.\r\n\r\n _The Butchers._ See p. 355.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE CARDMAKERS\r\n\r\nThis Company was incorporated under Charles I., 1629, as the Master,\r\nWarden, and Commonalty of the Mystery of Makers of Playing-Cards of the\r\nCity of London. It is governed by a Master, 2 Wardens, and 18\r\nAssistants. The whole Income of the Company is £50; the number of the\r\nLivery is 100; there are no Trust monies or charitable endowments; and\r\nthere is no Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CARMEN\r\n\r\nThe Carmen were made into a Fellowship by an Act of Common Council in\r\n1665. They have no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Carpenters._ See p. 143.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE CLOCKMAKERS\r\n\r\nThe Company was incorporated by charter of King Charles I., dated August\r\n22, 1631.\r\n\r\nThis original charter is still possessed by the Company. By it all\r\npersons using the Art or Mystery of Clockmaking, freemen of London, or\r\notherwise, within the City, its liberties or suburbs, or within ten\r\nmiles thereof, are incorporated by the name of the Master, Wardens, and\r\nFellowship of the Art or Mystery of Clockmaking of the City of London,\r\nwith power to make bye-laws for the government of its own members and\r\nthe regulation of the art, for the punishment of deceits and offences,\r\nto seek for, examine, and destroy faulty and deceitful work of clock-\r\nand watchmakers or mathematical instrument makers within the same\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThe Company has no Hall. The want of a Hall was constantly complained of\r\nfrom the beginning, but the omission was never repaired. The Livery\r\nconsists of 71. Their property is about £930, with a Trust Income of\r\nabout £172.\r\n\r\n _The Clothworkers._ See p. 276.\r\n\r\n _The Coachmakers._ See p. 85.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE COOKS\r\n\r\nThe official history is as follows:—\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the early records of the Company being destroyed by\r\nfire, the date of its foundation is not known, and from the existing\r\ndocuments in the Company’s possession its origin cannot be shown.\r\n\r\nBy inspeximus charter of George III. it appears that King Edward IV., in\r\nthe twenty-seventh year of his reign, granted unto his well-beloved\r\nsubjects the honest and freemen of the Mystery of Cooks of the City of\r\nLondon, that they and all men of the same mystery should be in substance\r\nand name one body, and one commonalty perpetual, with power to make two\r\nMasters or Governors with the aid of two Wardens and Assistants to\r\ngovern the affairs of the mystery, and to have a common seal, and to\r\nhold meetings, and to make laws and vary the same for the government of\r\nthe mystery.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the charter it will appear that power is given to the\r\nMasters or Governors to exercise superintendence and jurisdiction over\r\nevery member of the mystery and the works of such; the local limits of\r\nthe same are defined by the charter to be within the Cities of London\r\nand Westminster, their suburbs and liberties, and four miles’ compass\r\nthereof. Such control, owing to a late decision in a court of law, has\r\nfallen into abeyance.\r\n\r\nThe Livery is now 69; the Corporate Income is £2380; the Trust Income is\r\n£180. There is now no Hall; their old Hall, which escaped the Great Fire\r\n“by the space of a few houses,” was burned down in 1711 and never\r\nrebuilt. It stood on the east side of Aldersgate Street, facing Little\r\nBritain. At that time there was a passage leading beneath the houses in\r\nAldersgate Street to the Hall, which was “ancient and of small compass.”\r\nBehind the Hall a garden and open land stretched toward a wide space\r\nwhere once had been the ditch without the City wall. In the fire of 1711\r\nall the early papers of the Company perished, together with their\r\ncharter. The Cooks’ Gild formerly included the Pastelers or Pie-bakers,\r\nas one would expect. Stow calls them Cooks or Pastelars.\r\n\r\n _The Coopers._ See p. 68.\r\n\r\n _The Cordwainers._ See p. 252.\r\n\r\n _The Curriers._ See p. 74.\r\n\r\n _The Cutlers._ See p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE DISTILLERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Charles I., 1638, for a Master, 3 Wardens, 19\r\nAssistants, and 122 Liverymen. It is obvious that this is a\r\ncomparatively modern Company. It has no Hall. The Livery numbers 55.\r\nThere is no return of income by Whitaker. Hazlitt states that the\r\nCompany possesses the freehold of a piece of land intended as a site for\r\na Hall, together with certain accumulated funds. The Company refused to\r\nmake any return to the Royal Commission.\r\n\r\n _The Drapers._ See p. 142.\r\n\r\n _The Dyers._ See p. 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE FANMAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Queen Anne, 1709, for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 20\r\nAssistants. The Fanmakers have neither Livery nor Hall.\r\n\r\nThis Company, the youngest of all, is returned as having a Livery of\r\nabout 120 members, with an Income of £150.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE FARRIERS\r\n\r\nThe Farriers of London were erected into a mystery by the Court of Mayor\r\nand Aldermen in the year 1356. Among the City records is an entry made\r\nin this year (Libro G. Fol. XXX.), acknowledging the said Company or\r\nFellowship by the name of the “Marshals of the City of London,” and\r\ngiving them power to govern the said craft of Farriers.\r\n\r\nWhen we first hear of them thus, the mayor complains of them for “false\r\nwork,” and appoints two Master Farriers with authority to oversee and\r\ngovern the whole trade. They have therefore as yet no power of governing\r\nthemselves, but are under the control of the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Company was granted by Charles II., January 17, 1684,\r\ninvesting the Company with power and jurisdiction for the well ordering\r\nand governing of the art and trade of the Brotherhood of Farriers, and\r\nall who use or should use the same, within the Cities of London and\r\nWestminster, and the liberties thereof, and within a radius of seven\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nBeyond the deeds and documents hereinbefore referred to, there are no\r\ntrust deeds founding, regulating, or affecting the Company.\r\n\r\nBye-laws, rules, orders, and ordinances were approved by the judges,\r\nJanuary 29, 1676. Livery specially restored by Court of Aldermen, June\r\n23, 1692. Regulated by Act of Common Council, December 12, 1758.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Fire of 1666 most of the books and papers of the Company\r\nwere destroyed. The object for which the Company was founded was\r\nrigorously exercised until very recent years, but latterly, owing to the\r\nalterations in the habits of society and the increase of population, the\r\nCompany have not deemed it expedient to enforce their rights, although\r\nat the same time they have not abandoned any part of their controlling\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe Livery now numbers 101; the Corporate Income is £240; there is no\r\nTrust Income.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE FELT MAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by James I. in 1604 for a Master, 4 Wardens, and 25\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 60.\r\n\r\nThe Company was a branch of the Haberdashers. They were a separate\r\nassociation long before they received a charter. As a Company they have\r\nalways been one of the least important. The Livery numbers 65. The\r\nCorporate Income “varies,” and the Trust Income is £126. There is no\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE FISHERMEN\r\n\r\nIncorporated by James II. in 1687. There is no history of the Company so\r\nfar as I know. They were the Free Fishermen of the Thames. They had\r\nneither Hall nor a Livery. I suppose that the rights of the Thames\r\nConservancy were such that the Fishermen had none left for them. In\r\nother words, their trade was regulated by the City authorities, which\r\nordered times and seasons, the size of the nets, etc., while the\r\nFishmongers Company regulated the sale of the fish. The reckless\r\ndestruction of the young fry, for instance, the pulling up of weirs, and\r\nthe use of narrow nets were practices denounced by the City on many\r\noccasions. In the ordinances of 1528 concerning the Thames fishery there\r\nis no mention of any Company or Fraternity of Fishermen. In 1698, eleven\r\nyears after the Company was incorporated, an Act of Parliament ordered\r\nthat these bye-laws should be submitted to the mayor and aldermen, that\r\nthe water bailiff of the City should retain the power of granting\r\nlicences for fishing in the river, and that he should have the right of\r\nbeing one of the Wardens of the Company. And in the year 1741, when\r\nother ordinances were made for the protection of the fishery, no mention\r\nis made of the Company at all.\r\n\r\n _The Fishmongers._ See p. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE FLETCHERS\r\n\r\nThe Fraternity of Fletchers or Arrowmakers (Fr. _flèche_) must be of\r\nantiquity equal to that of the Bowyers, because bows and arrows are of\r\nlittle use without each other. The Company can show no charter or any\r\nearly document.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Company was founded in the fifteenth century,\r\ninasmuch as the grant of arms which is in its possession is dated in the\r\nseventh year of Edward IV. None of the circumstances connected with the\r\nfoundation of the Company are known. It was founded by prescription and\r\nnot by grant.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1371 the Bowyers and the Fletchers came to an understanding\r\nthat they would refrain from interfering with each other, that the\r\nBowyers shall make bows and the Fletchers arrows. In 1403 the ordinance\r\nof the Fletchers was proclaimed in the name of the mayor and aldermen.\r\nThis ordinance gave the Masters of the trade authority to oversee the\r\ntrade and make search for bad work.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the reign of Henry VII. it obtained a Livery, and in that\r\nreign obtained a crest to its then ancient coat-of-arms. In point of\r\nprecedence it is the 39th Company of the City. No charter can now be\r\ndiscovered, and the ancient books of the Company are supposed to have\r\nbeen destroyed by fire. The oldest entry in connection with the cash\r\naccounts of the Company now in its possession is dated January 25, 1775;\r\nin connection with its proceedings, January 26, 1767; admission of\r\nfreemen, February 6, 1732: all these accounts have since been regularly\r\ncontinued up to the present time. Numerous entries of very ancient dates\r\nrespecting this Company are to be seen in the journals and repertories\r\nof the Corporation of London. They principally relate to differences\r\nbetween this Company and the Bowyers, returns of the number of the\r\nLivery, and the employment of foreigners. The Company has not a common\r\nseal. The Wardens and Court of Assistants are the ruling body, and they\r\nfill up their vacancies as they occur.\r\n\r\nThe Company is now very small. There are only 16 in the Livery; their\r\nCorporate Income is no more than £100; and they have no Hall. They once,\r\nit is true, had their own Hall. It was situated in St. Mary Axe.\r\n\r\n _The Founders._ See p. 115.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRAMEWORK-KNITTERS\r\n\r\nThe Framework-knitters made stockings of silk or other work in “a frame\r\nor engine.” They were therefore a modern craft incorporated first by a\r\ncharter of Cromwell in 1657, and afterwards by Charles II., 1673, after\r\nabout a hundred years of work at their trade without incorporation. The\r\nCompany was to consist of a Master, 2 Wardens, 18 Assistants, and 82\r\nLiverymen. The Company has no document in its possession which states\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe charter under which the Company is now constituted is dated August\r\n19, 1663, and is the only charter or instrument of that nature which is\r\nnow or has for the past fifty years been in the possession of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nAt present the number of the Livery is 100; their Corporate Income is\r\n£310; their Trust Income is £130; they have no Hall. Their former Hall,\r\nwhich stood in Red Cross Street, was sold to the Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE FRUITERERS\r\n\r\nThe date of the foundation of the Company or Society of the Fruiterers\r\nis uncertain, but they were incorporated by charter, granted by King\r\nJames I. in the third year of his reign “for the better order,\r\ngovernment, and rule of them,” by the name of “Master, Wardens, and\r\nCommonalty of the Mystery of Fruiterers of London,” with perpetual\r\nsuccession and power “to purchase, have, receive, and enjoy manors,\r\nmessuages, lands, tenements, liberties, privileges, jurisdictions,\r\nfranchises, and other hereditaments” “to them and their successors in\r\nfee and perpetuity,” or for years or otherwise; “and also all manner of\r\ngoods, chattels, and things whatsoever,” with power to grant, let,\r\nalien, assign, etc., and to sue and be sued, and to have a common seal.\r\nAnd that there should be a Master, and 2 Wardens, and 5 or more of the\r\nsaid Company, not exceeding 20, to be called the Assistants of the said\r\nCompany, with power to make bye-laws for the good rule and government of\r\nthe said Corporation.\r\n\r\nBye-laws were afterwards made, and they were allowed by the Lord Keeper\r\nand Chief Justices in 1759.\r\n\r\nThese bye-laws relate chiefly to the constitution of the Court of the\r\nCompany. There are also regulations (long since obsolete) affecting the\r\ntrade, and some rules as to apprentices.\r\n\r\nThe present number of the Livery is 90; their Income is stated to be £90\r\na year; and they have no Hall. Strype, 1720, vol. i. bk. iii. p. 13,\r\nasserts that the Fruiterers had a Hall in premises rebuilt on the site\r\nof Worcester House; the Fruiterers Company, however, agree with Hatton,\r\n1709, and Maitland, 1756, in stating that the Company had no Hall after\r\nthe Fire.\r\n\r\nThis little Company is chiefly known by their custom of presenting the\r\nLord Mayor, on October 7 every year, with an offering of English fruit.\r\nThe custom is said to have arisen in memory of the commutation of an old\r\ncivic right to a toll on all fruit brought into the City. The Company\r\nalso came forward some years ago in giving lectures on the culture of\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE GARDENERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by James I., 1606, for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 18\r\nAssistants. There is no return of property; the Livery now consists of\r\n44 members. They have no Hall. The gardens of London have always until\r\nthe last two hundred years been a remarkable feature of the City, which,\r\nin its northern and less densely populated parts, was filled with\r\ngardens and trees, amidst which the industries of the City were carried\r\non; and many of the crafts had their Halls. It is quite certain that\r\nsome form of Fraternity or Gild must have been formed among the large\r\nclass of gardeners who cultivated these grounds. Stow, however, gives no\r\naccount of them. Their existence, however, is clearly indicated by Riley\r\n(_Memorials_, p. 228), when he produces the petition of the “Gardeners\r\nof the Earls, Barons, Bishops and Citizens” of London. The petition set\r\nforth that they were formerly entitled to stand in front of the Church\r\nof St. Augustine, by the gate of St. Paul’s, “there to sell the garden\r\nproduce of their said masters and make their profit.” Were the Earls,\r\nBarons, and Bishops, then, market-gardeners? If not, did the gardeners\r\ncultivate the land for their own exclusive profit? “And they prayed\r\npermission to continue the custom.” The mayor and aldermen resolved in\r\nreply that they had made themselves so great a nuisance by their\r\n“scurrility and clamour” while the priests of St. Augustine were singing\r\nmass that the permission must be withdrawn, and that they must set up\r\ntheir market in the space between the south gate of St. Paul’s\r\nChurchyard and the garden wall of the Black Friars, in other words, on\r\nthe space between Godliman Street and St. Andrew’s Hill, not nearly so\r\ncentral a spot as that which they had formerly used.\r\n\r\nThere are other references in Riley to gardens. There was one called the\r\nKing’s Garden, near the Hermitage in London Wall. And in 1276 there is\r\nthe case of a man who fell from a pear-tree in the garden of one\r\nLawrence, in the parish of St. Michael, Paternoster Royal, then, as now,\r\nthe most crowded part of the City. There is also given the lease of a\r\n“garden situate in Tower Ward, near London Wall.” Since there was an\r\nopen space all along the wall in which houses were not allowed to be\r\nbuilt, this space was without doubt mainly devoted to gardens, just as\r\nthe north bank of the ditch became afterwards a row of what we should\r\nnow call allotments, cultivated for vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\n _The Girdlers._ See p. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GLASS SELLERS\r\n\r\nAnother little Company incorporated by Charles II., 1664, for a Master,\r\n2 Wardens, 24 Assistants, and 44 Liverymen. The present number of\r\nLiverymen is 38; their Corporate Income is _nil_; and their Trust\r\nIncome, the interest on a sum of £800.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE GLAZIERS\r\n\r\nFounded by Royal Charter of King Charles I., 1631, dated November 6,\r\nafter stating that the ancient Fraternity of the Mystery or Art of\r\nGlaziers, London, had theretofore made many good orders for the\r\nregulating themselves and their trade which had from time to time been\r\nimproved and enlarged in the reigns of several princes, but that they\r\nwere not sufficiently incorporated: The said charter incorporated the\r\nthen present freemen of that trade within the City of London and five\r\nmiles compassing the same, into one body corporate or politic by the\r\nname of the Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery or Art of Glaziers and\r\nPainters of Glass, with power to make rules and orders for the good\r\ngovernment of their society, and to impose punishment by fine, or\r\notherwise, upon offenders.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing charter appears to have been surrendered in the first year\r\nof the reign of King James II., and thereupon a new charter was issued\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe present Livery numbers 60; its Corporate Income is about £260; its\r\nTrust Income is £46.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was situated before the Great Fire in Maiden Lane, then Kerion\r\nLane. There is no difficulty in locating the site on the south side,\r\nnext to the Church of St. Martin-in-the-Vintry, upon what is now in part\r\nthe roadway of Queen Street. No. 11 Maiden Lane stands upon land once\r\nadjoining, if not actually part of, the old Hall site. The Glaziers did\r\nnot rebuild their Hall after 1666, but met henceforth at the Hall of the\r\nLoriners in London Wall; also, according to Strype (1720), in a house at\r\nthe Thames Street end of St. Peter’s Hill. When New Queen Street was\r\ncut, shortly after the Fire, part of the Glaziers’ ground became a\r\ncorner site, having Thames Street on the south and the new road on the\r\nwest. In 1671 the Company sold land in these two streets for £490. Four\r\nhouses built upon land adjoining to St. Martin’s Churchyard remained in\r\nthe Company’s possession until 1850, when they were taken by the\r\nCorporation for the widening of Queen Street. The Company has now no\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE GLOVERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Charles I. in 1639 for a Master, 4 Wardens, and 30\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 130. The Company refused to give any return\r\nto the Royal Commission. The present Livery numbers 75. Hazlitt says\r\nthat in 1881 the Income of the Company was derived from a small sum of\r\n£3800 in the stocks and the fines and fees of the freemen and the\r\nLivery. The Glovers presented their ordinances to the mayor and aldermen\r\nin 1349. It seems somewhat strange that a craft of such great importance\r\nas that of glove-making should have been always one of the poorest\r\nCompanies in the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE GOLD AND SILVER WYRE DRAWERS\r\n\r\nThe art or trade of Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers is one of antiquity and\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the reign of James I., in consequence of a patent\r\ngranted by the King, the Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers of that day\r\nattempted to bring over from France artizans to work the trade. The\r\nGoldsmiths, however, rose in arms, declaring the King was not doing what\r\nwas conducive to the best interests of the kingdom, and the Lord Mayor\r\nand aldermen were called upon to act in the matter, and in the end the\r\nKing withdrew the patent, and the trade continued undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe charter under which the Company now exists was granted by 5 William\r\nand Mary, 1693, for the better regulation, encouragement, and\r\nimprovement of the said trade, and grants that the freemen of the trade,\r\nart, and mystery of Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers, and all others\r\nexercising, or who should thereafter exercise the trade, art, or mystery\r\nof drawing and flatting of gold and silver wyre, and making and spinning\r\nof gold and silver thread and stuff within the Cities of London and\r\nWestminster, the Borough of Southwark, and all other places within three\r\nmiles distant from the same, should be from thenceforth a body politic\r\nand corporate by the before-mentioned style.\r\n\r\nThe governing body consists at present of a Master, 4 Wardens, and not\r\nmore than 26 Assistants. Their Livery now numbers 143; their Corporate\r\nIncome is £62; their Trust Income is £2. There is no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Goldsmiths._ See p. 44.\r\n\r\n _The Grocers._ See p. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE GUNMAKERS\r\n\r\nThe Gunmakers Company was founded in 1637.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the Company had its origin may be gathered\r\nfrom the preamble of the Company’s charter, which recites “That divers\r\nblacksmiths and others inexpert in the art of gun-making had taken upon\r\nthem to make, try, and prove guns after their unskilful way, whereby the\r\ntrade was not only much damnified, but much harm and danger through such\r\nunskilfulness had happened to His Majesty’s subjects,” and for the\r\nreformation of which evils the charter of incorporation was applied for\r\nand granted.\r\n\r\nAs for and concerning said art, trade, and mystery of gun-making, and\r\nthe well ordering and government thereof within the said City, and\r\nwithin four miles thereof.\r\n\r\nAlso for the punishment of abuses in manufacture of guns or any other\r\nwrong or abuse.\r\n\r\nAlso for the support, rule, and government of the said Master, Wardens,\r\nand Society, and their successors, and all others exercising the trade\r\nwithin the limits aforesaid.\r\n\r\nIt recites that great deceits and abuses were frequently practised and\r\ncommitted by divers inexpert persons using the art and mystery of\r\ngun-making within the City of London and liberties and ten miles thereof\r\nwho for the most part made the said guns slightly and deceitfully to the\r\ngreat endangering and prejudice of His Majesty’s subjects, and that\r\nhand-guns, dags, and pistols, and parts thereof unartificially and\r\ndeceitfully made and wrought in foreign and other parts, and imported\r\ninto said City of London and places adjacent and were then altered and\r\nsold to the danger of His Majesty’s subjects. To prevent such dangers\r\nand abuses the Master, Wardens, and Society should have power.\r\n\r\nTo search, view, gauge, proof, trial, and marking of all manner of\r\nhand-guns whatsoever great and small dags and pistols, and all and every\r\npart and parcel of them as well those made in London, or the suburbs, or\r\nwithin ten miles thereof. And all such others as should from foreign\r\nparts, or otherwise, be brought thither to be sold for military service\r\nor other employment in any of His Majesty’s dominions or foreign parts.\r\n\r\nSuch proof or trial to be with good and sufficient gun-powder and weight\r\nof bullet of lead sizeable to every several gun according to the bore\r\nand otherwise as therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nAll persons using, making, or selling guns, dags, pistols, barrels,\r\nlocks, or other parts thereof at their own costs to bring same to the\r\ncommon Hall or other meet place of said Society to be duly viewed,\r\ntried, stamped, and marked before the same be sold and delivered.\r\n\r\nAll such guns to be brought within ten days after making and finishing\r\nthereof, and imported guns within ten days from the arrival thereof\r\nwithin London or ten miles thereof.\r\n\r\nThe said Society and their successors to have stamps with the letters GP\r\ncrowned to mark therewith all hand-guns, dags, and pistols, or parts\r\nthereof, when viewed and proved, and break up and destroy all improperly\r\nmade. And no persons to counterfeit such stamps.\r\n\r\nThat no persons exercise the art of gun-making but those who have served\r\nseven years’ apprenticeship to said art, and presented their proof-piece\r\nto said Master and Wardens, and approved by them.\r\n\r\nThe Livery now consists of 28; their Corporate Income from all sources\r\nis £2400; they have no Trust Income; their Hall is at 46 Commercial Road\r\n(outside the City). The Company had the right to examine all guns made\r\nin London and within a ten miles’ radius. In the Proof House at\r\nWhitechapel the Company still carries on the work for which it was\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n _The Haberdashers._ See p. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE HORNERS\r\n\r\nThis is one of the oldest of the Fraternities, for it is mentioned in\r\nthe reign of King Henry III., 1268, when the King granted an annual fair\r\nto Charlton, in Kent, for three days, at the eve, the day, and morrow of\r\nthe Trinity. The time for holding this fair was afterwards changed to\r\nSt. Luke’s Day (October 18). Philpot, who wrote in 1659, speaks of this\r\nfair as kept yearly on that day, and called “horn fair” by reason of the\r\ngreat “plenty of all sorts of winding horns and cups and other vessels\r\nof horn there bought and sold.”\r\n\r\nIn the reign of King Edward III. the horners of the City of London were\r\nclassed among the forty-eight mysteries of the City. In the 50th year of\r\nthat king’s reign a controversy arose between the King and the\r\nCorporation as to whether the Common Council of the City was to be\r\nelected by the wards or the mysteries of the City. This led to an\r\nordinance being made by the City, with the consent of the King, that the\r\nelection was to be by the mysteries, pursuant to which ordinance\r\nforty-eight mysteries deputed members to the Common Council; the\r\nhorners, ranking in the third class or smaller mysteries, were deputed\r\nto send two members.\r\n\r\nBy statute 4 Edward IV. c. 8, it was enacted that from the feast of\r\nEaster in the year 1466 no stranger (_i.e._ not a freeman of the\r\nCompany) not alien should buy any English horns unwrought of any\r\ntanners, bochers, or other persons within the City of London and\r\ntwenty-four miles on every side next adjoining, and that no Englishman\r\nor other person should sell any English horns unwrought to any stranger,\r\nor cause them to be sent over the sea, so that the said horners would\r\nbuy the said horns at like price as they were at the time of the making\r\nof the Act, upon pain of forfeiture of all such horns so bought, sold,\r\nor sent. And the Wardens of the said mystery should have full power to\r\nsearch all manner of ware pertaining to their mystery in all places\r\nwithin the City of London and twenty-four miles adjoining, and within\r\nthe fairs of Stirbridge and Elie; and if they found any wares that were\r\ndefective and insufficient they might bring them before the mayor of\r\nLondon, the mayor or bailiffs of the foresaid fairs to be forfeit\r\none-half to the King, the other half to the said Wardens. But after the\r\nhorners had taken so many horns as should be needful to their\r\noccupation, they and all other persons might sell all the horns refused\r\nto any stranger or other person to send beyond the sea or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Company obtained from King Charles I. a charter of incorporation\r\ndated the 12th January 1638.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1604 the Company obtained a lease of a storehouse and sheds\r\nin Wentworth Street, Whitechapel, for 1000 years from Christmas 1604 at\r\nthe yearly rent of £4, in which they carried on the trade.\r\n\r\nThis property was sold for £2400 to the Metropolitan Board of Works for\r\nthe purposes of the Artizans’ Dwellings Act.\r\n\r\nThe control given by the charter of Charles I. to the Horners Company\r\nover the trade has never been actually abandoned, but it has ceased to\r\nbe exercised.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836 the Company petitioned the Court of Aldermen for a\r\nLivery, which was granted to them on the 1st of December of that year,\r\nthe number of Liverymen being limited to 60.\r\n\r\nAt present the Livery numbers 48. Their Corporate Income is £89. They\r\nhave no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Innholders._ See p. 232.\r\n\r\n _The Ironmongers._ See p. 148.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE JOINERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Elizabeth in 1569 for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 24\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 323.\r\n\r\nThe work for which the Fraternity existed was a branch of carpentry.\r\nThey made cabinets and carved work, doors, window-frames, and other\r\nkinds of work which required special skill and training. The\r\nsubdivisions of carpentry were naturally difficult to arrange. An\r\nagreement was made between the Carpenters and the Joiners, by which the\r\nlatter were allowed to take over bedsteads, chairs, stools, cabinets,\r\npicture-frames, windows, doors, pews, pulpits, and all sorts of work.\r\n\r\nThe overlapping of trades once, if not more than once, caused a riot. It\r\nwas in the year 1327. On one side were the saddlers, and on the other\r\nside the joiners, loriners, and painters. They met in Chepe, and in the\r\nstreet of Cripplegate “strongly provided with an armed force, and\r\nmanfully began to fight,” so that many were killed or mortally wounded,\r\nand the whole City was in alarm.\r\n\r\nThe Livery is now 102; the Corporate Income is £1300; there is no Trust\r\nIncome.\r\n\r\nStow describes the Joiners’ Hall as one of several “fair houses”\r\nstanding in Frier Lane. The Hall itself, but not the entrance into it\r\nfrom Joiners’ Hall Buildings, was in Dowgate Ward. It was destroyed in\r\nthe Great Fire, but rebuilt. The post-Fire building is described as a\r\nlarge edifice of brick, with four noble windows in elegant frames,\r\ncovered with pediments, and supported by consoles. The great Hall was\r\nall wainscotted, and was very remarkable for a magnificent and curious\r\nscreen at its lower end. Upon this screen were “demi-savages and other\r\nenrichments, well carved in right wainscot.” It is said to have cost\r\n£130. The parlour was wainscotted with cedar, “with more curious\r\nartifice and embellishments.” The ceiling was fretted with wainscot\r\nwork. The great Hall was destroyed by a fire in 1694, but the parlour,\r\nthough slightly damaged, was saved by the energy of the clerk, Mr.\r\nBurroughs, who brought engines to play upon it from a window. It had\r\nalready been occupied as a dwelling and warehouse at the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and was afterwards pulled down, when a present\r\nlarge warehouse was erected on its site. In Strype’s map a long building\r\nappears to run down upon its western side in Joiners’ Hall Buildings.\r\nFrom Joiners’ Hall Buildings, Vintry Ward, leading into the warehouse\r\nyard, is the only remnant left of the Hall. The Company has now no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Leathersellers._ See p. 184.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE LORINERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Queen Anne, 1712, for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 24\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 69. It has now a Livery of 420, with a\r\nCorporate Income of £1200. It has no Trust Income, and no Hall. Formerly\r\nthe Hall was at the north end of Basinghall Street. The Livery is the\r\nlargest of all the Companies, the reason being the admission of members\r\nwho merely wish to belong to a City Company for social purposes. The\r\nLoriners’ work was the making of spurs, stirrups, horses’ bits, etc.\r\nTheir ordinances were passed and approved in 1245. They were then a Gild\r\nor Association, and as such continued till their incorporation under\r\nQueen Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE MAKERS OF PLAYING-CARDS\r\n\r\nThis Company was incorporated in 1628. At present it has a Livery of\r\n100, with a Corporate Income of £50; no Trust Income, and no Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE MASONS\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of the records of the Worshipful Company of Masons\r\nprior to the year 1666 appear to have been destroyed when the Hall of\r\nthe Company was burned in the Fire of London. The only documents in\r\nexistence of an earlier date are the grant of arms, dated the 12th\r\nEdward IV., by which Clarencieux granted to the Craft and Fellowship of\r\nMasons a coat-of-arms, which is the same as now used by the Company, and\r\na volume of accounts, the earliest of which is dated 1620, being the\r\naccounts of the “Master and Wardens of the Company of Free Masons within\r\nthe City of London.” In the heading of the accounts the Company is so\r\nstyled until the year 1655-56, from which date to the present time the\r\naccounts are headed as the accounts of “The Master and Wardens of the\r\nWorshipful Company of Masons of the City of London.” The earliest\r\ncharter now in their possession is the 29th Charles II., A.D. 1677,\r\ngranted on a petition by the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the\r\nCompany of Masons in London, but there is nothing to show whether or not\r\nany earlier charter had been granted to them.\r\n\r\nThe number of the Livery is now 48; the Corporate Income is £550; there\r\nis no Trust Income. They had a Hall in Basinghall Street, which no\r\nlonger exists. In the year 1356 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 280) ordinances\r\nwere passed for the regulation of the trade of masons. The ordinances\r\nshow that there had been dissension between the branches of “hewers” and\r\n“light masons and settlers.” The late date of the charter does not mean\r\nthat the Fraternity began their existence at that date. They already had\r\na Livery and a Gild; they returned members to the Common Council in\r\n1376, and they were probably even at that date an ancient body.\r\n\r\n _The Mercers._ See p. 33.\r\n\r\n _The Merchant Taylors._ See p. 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nInstituted by charter granted on April 24, 9th Edward IV. (1473), and\r\nreconstituted by James I., 1604, for a Master, 2 Wardens, 20 Assistants,\r\nand 31 members. The present number of members is 50; the Corporate\r\nIncome is £400; there is no Trust Income; there is no Hall.\r\n\r\nThere were always musicians or minstrels presumably, therefore the\r\nFraternity was ancient. And, as it was absolutely necessary for\r\nmusicians to act together, the Fraternity began as soon as different\r\ninstruments were used at the same time. This is one of the very small\r\nCompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NEEDLEMAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Cromwell in 1656 for a Master, 2 Wardens, 18 Assistants,\r\nand 48 Liverymen. The number of the Livery is now 66; their Corporate\r\nIncome is £230; they have no Hall. Charles II. set aside Cromwell’s\r\ncharter and gave one of his own. This also is one of the humbler\r\nCompanies. Their charter is set out at length by Maitland. I do not know\r\nwhy, nor can I find in it any special clauses which should explain this\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n _The Painters._ See p. 221.\r\n\r\n _The Parish Clerks._ See p. 87.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PATTENMAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Charles II., 1670, for a Master, 2 Wardens, 22\r\nAssistants, and 46 Liverymen. The Livery at present consists of 40; its\r\nCorporate Income is £50; its Trust Income is £13. It has no Hall.\r\n\r\nOne of the smallest of the City Companies. The Pattenmakers are a branch\r\nof the Pouchmakers, who (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 554) petitioned the\r\nmayor and aldermen for powers to look after the trade of making\r\ngaloches, _i.e._ pattens, as a thing invented or introduced by\r\nthemselves. This power was duly granted to the pouchmakers. Very shortly\r\nafter the Pattenmakers appear as a separate Fraternity. Probably the\r\ntrade assumed large proportions. The protection of the feet from the\r\nmud, garbage, and filth, then lying about the streets, caused a great\r\ndemand for the new kind of shoe. The quarter where the pattenmakers\r\nlived is marked, according to Stow, by the name of St. Margaret Pattens\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PAVIORS\r\n\r\nThere is no record of incorporation of this Company. Pavements are\r\nmentioned “within Newgate,” “hard by St. Nicholas Fleshameles,” “before\r\nthe Friars Minors”—all apparently meaning the same place. The earliest\r\nrecord the Company possesses is a small book, dated 1597, called “The\r\nBooke of Stattutes of the Pavioures which is used soundryes Tymes.” The\r\nkind of pavement consisted probably of the round cobble-stones,\r\nafterwards used everywhere. Freestone pavements were ordered after the\r\nFire of London, but the order was not obeyed. The Company has no Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Company possesses no Livery, though a considerable number of\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\n _The Pewterers._ See p. 152.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PINMAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Charles I. in 1636. They had a Master, 2 Wardens, and 18\r\nAssistants, but no Livery. The Pinners, before this incorporation, were\r\nunited first with the Wire Makers, and then with the Girdlers. They had\r\na Hall in St. Mary-at-Hill, whence they moved to Old Broad Street. Their\r\nHall was for a long time a Nonconformist chapel. It was taken down in\r\n1787. The Company no longer exists. They had also a Hall in Addle\r\nStreet, which they sold to the Plaisterers before the time of Stow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PLAISTERERS\r\n\r\nBy charter of 16 Henry VII., March 10, 1501, the King gave power to\r\nestablish the Company as the Guild or Fraternity in honour of the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary, of men of the Mystery or Art of Pargettors in the\r\nCity of London, commonly called Plaisterers, to be increased and\r\naugmented when necessary, and to be governed by a Master and two\r\nWardens, to be elected annually. The said Master and Wardens and\r\nbrotherhood were to be a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a\r\ncommon seal, and they were empowered to purchase and enjoy in fee and\r\nperpetuity lands and other possessions in the City, suburbs, and\r\nelsewhere. And the charter empowered the said Master and Wardens to sue\r\nand be sued as “The master and wardens of the Guild or Fraternity of the\r\nBlessed Mary of Pargettors, commonly called Plaisterers, London.”\r\n\r\nThe charter of Elizabeth, February 10, 1597, confirmed the privileges of\r\nthe Company, and extended the authority of the Masters and Wardens to\r\nand over all persons exercising the Art of Plaisterers, as well English\r\nas aliens and denizens inhabiting and exercising the said art within the\r\nCity and suburbs and liberties thereof, or within two miles of the said\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 19 Charles II., June 19, 1679, confirmed the privileges\r\ngranted by the previous charters, and having in view the rebuilding of\r\nthe City, forbade any person to carry on simultaneously the trades of a\r\nmason, bricklayer, or plaisterer, and also forbade any person to\r\nexercise or carry on the Art of a Plaisterer without having been\r\napprenticed seven years to the mystery. And the jurisdiction of the\r\nCompany was extended to three miles’ distance from the City.\r\n\r\nThe present Livery consists of 52; they have a Corporate Income of\r\n£1062; a Trust Income of £33. In Stow’s time they had a Hall in Addle\r\nStreet. This was burnt down in the Great Fire, rebuilt by Sir\r\nChristopher Wren, and again burnt in 1882. Riley gives an agreement\r\n(_Memorials_, p. 125), dated 1317, between one Adam a Plastrer and Sir\r\nJohn de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond. The Fraternity probably existed at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PLUMBERS\r\n\r\nThe Company had existence as a body from a very early period, as shown\r\nby ordinances passed in the reign of King Edward III. 1365. These\r\nordinances may be found in Riley’s _Memorials_, p. 321.\r\n\r\nThe earliest charter of the Company was that of King James I. in 1611,\r\nand it is believed to be the only charter in existence. The Company is\r\nincorporated as the “Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Freemen of\r\nthe Mystery of Plumbing of the City of London,” for the better ordering,\r\nrule, and government of the men of the mystery and Company aforesaid,\r\nand of all those who then exercised and used or thereafter should\r\nexercise and use the art and mystery of plumbing, or the materials,\r\nworks, merchandises, or things whatsoever to the said mystery relating,\r\nand for the utility, advantage, and relief of the good and honest, and\r\nfor the terror and correction of the evil, deceitful, and dishonest. And\r\nalso that they might have, make, and exercise the superior scrutiny,\r\ncorrection, and government of all and singular the freemen of the\r\nmystery, as also all other persons using or exercising the art or\r\nmystery in the limits aforesaid, and of their servants and apprentices.\r\nAnd also the supervision, scrutiny, correction, reformation, emendation,\r\ngovernment, the assaye, touch, and the trial of all and singular\r\nworkings, works, weights, beams and scales, lead, solder, materials,\r\nwares, matters, merchandises, and of all things whatsoever touching or\r\nconcerning the aforesaid mystery in the limits aforesaid. And also to\r\nseize, take, and place in safe custody such materials, etc., aforesaid\r\nfrom time to time so found deceptive, false, insufficient, unapproved,\r\nand unlawful, there to remain until it should be determined thereof\r\naccording to the laws of the realm of England. And further also that it\r\nshould not be lawful for any person or persons of the art and mystery,\r\nor any other person or persons whomsoever using or who might use the art\r\nand mystery, to make work or expose for sale any solder or leaden\r\nweights within the limits aforesaid or within three miles thereof,\r\nunless the same be first proved and tried by the Master and Wardens\r\nwhether they are good, sufficient, true, and lawful according to the\r\nlaws of the realm and the customs of the City or not. And upon such\r\ntrial to impress or mark with the impression, image, or sign of St.\r\nMichael the Archangel upon the same before their use or employ.\r\n\r\nThe present Livery consists of 40. The Company has a Corporate Income of\r\n£880; a Trust Income of £20.\r\n\r\nIn Stow’s time the Plumbers had their Hall in Anchor Lane, a turning on\r\nthe south side of Thames Street, next to Vintners’ Hall. For these\r\npremises they were tenants to the Vintners. After the Fire of 1666 the\r\nPlumbers left their old quarters and built a new Hall in Chequer Yard,\r\nwhere it is shown in Strype’s map, at the east end of the yard, north\r\nside. Maitland (1739) calls it a good handsome building. Malcolm,\r\nwriting in 1802, says that it had lately been pulled down, and\r\nwarehouses of great extent, called after the name of the Company,\r\nerected on its site. At about the same time a new Hall of red brick was\r\nbuilt in Bush Lane (then called Great Bush Lane). It was rebuilt in\r\n1830, but finally pulled down to make way for Cannon Street Station.\r\nHallam (_Constitutional History_) says that the first instance of actual\r\npunishment inflicted on Protestant dissenters was in 1567, when a\r\ncompany of more than a hundred were seized during their religious\r\nexercises at Plumbers’ Hall (the one in Anchor Lane), which they had\r\nhired on pretence of a wedding; fourteen or fifteen of them were sent to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE POULTERS\r\n\r\nThe ancient market of the Poulters was around the place still called the\r\nPoultry (see p. 11); they also sold poultry in the stocks market in\r\nGracechurch Street and in Newgate Street. Riley’s _Memorials_ contain\r\nmany regulations and ordinances for the sale of poultry. One remarks\r\nthat the ordinances of the City in one respect, and in one only, were\r\nobserved with the greatest care: those, namely, relating to the sale of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe Poulters Company existed by prescription as early as 1345. It was,\r\nhowever, incorporated by Royal Charter in the nineteenth year of Henry\r\nVII., on February 23, 1504. The charter was renewed by Queen Elizabeth,\r\nFebruary 22, in the thirtieth year of her reign, confirmed by Charles\r\nII., on June 13, in the sixth year of his reign, and also by James II.\r\nsubsequently, but these charters, like those of many of the Companies,\r\nwere destroyed in the Fire of London in 1666. The charter under which\r\nthe Company now acts was granted by William and Mary, May 6, 1692.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1763 the charter was supplemented by an Act of the\r\nCorporation of London and by another Act of the Corporation in 1820. The\r\ncharter gives power to the Company to inspect the poultry brought to\r\nmarket, but that power has long since been suspended by the Acts of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nTheir present Livery is 126; their Corporate Income is £1020; their\r\nTrust Income is £430; they have no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Saddlers._ See p. 9.\r\n\r\n _The Salters._ See p. 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SCRIVENERS\r\n\r\nThe Company now known as the Scriveners Company had existed from a very\r\nearly period as the Fraternity or Mystery of the Scriveners or Writers\r\nof the Court Letter of the City of London, and was “time out of mind” a\r\nsociety or Company by prescription. The Company has no document showing\r\nthe probable date of the foundation of this society, but their records\r\nextend back to 47 Edward III., being the year 1374.\r\n\r\nThe Company cannot say what were the exact circumstances in which it had\r\nits origin, but presumes that the Scriveners of London formed themselves\r\ninto a society for the purpose of more effectually protecting their own\r\ninterests and those of the occupation or craft which they carried on.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1373 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 372) the “Court Hand writers\r\nand scriveners obtained their Ordinances.” These were chiefly directed\r\nagainst “foreigners.”\r\n\r\nIt was incorporated by James I. in 1616 for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 24\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 53.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Great Fire of London all the archives of the Company\r\nwere burnt except the ancient book called their common paper, and which\r\nbook is still extant.\r\n\r\nTheir present Livery is 50. Their Trust Income is £10. Their Corporate\r\nIncome is about £440. They have no Hall. Formerly they had a Hall in\r\nNoble Street which they sold to the Coachmakers. “At present,” says\r\nMaitland, 1750, “they are endeavouring by course of Law to oblige all\r\nAttorneys of the City to become Members.” An attempt which does not seem\r\nto have been successful.\r\n\r\nThe Scriveners’ work was much like that of solicitors of the present\r\nday. They made wills, drew up conveyances and other legal documents.\r\nThey also wrote letters both of a business and a private nature. Some of\r\nthem became financiers and bankers. In fact, the step from drawing up\r\nlegal documents to advising on affairs of all kinds was easy and\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SHIPWRIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe precise year of the foundation of the Company is unknown, but it is\r\nmentioned in 1428 in the City records, from which it appears that it\r\nexisted as a Fraternity, having a trade guild or mystery and a religious\r\nguild in connection with it, with a presumption in favour of its having\r\nexisted by prescription for some time before that period. In a parchment\r\nbook belonging to the Company there are ordinances of the religious\r\nsociety, the earliest of which is dated in 1456. Additions were made\r\nthereto in 1483, beginning, “In Dei nomine, Amen. It is not unknown to\r\nall the brethren and sisters of the fraternitie of Saint Symon and Jude\r\nhath been holden in London by the crafte of shipwrights of tyme out of\r\nminde,” etc. After which follow various ordinances relating to the\r\ntaking of apprentices, and other matters, and more especially enjoining\r\nits members “to viewe and serche that the brethren of that fraternitie\r\ndoe use in their said trades good and seasonable timber, and doe their\r\nworke workmanlike as appertaineth.”\r\n\r\nThe Company was incorporated by James I. in 1605 for a Master, 2\r\nWardens, and 36 Assistants.\r\n\r\nIn 1613 commenced a dispute between the Company and the foreign\r\nshipwrights who carried on their craft on the opposite side of the\r\nriver, at Redrithe or Rotherhithe. The foreign shipwrights (so-called\r\nfrom being outside the liberties of the City) had, in the previous year,\r\nobtained a charter of incorporation, acting upon which they sought to\r\nexact fines from and impose duties upon the free shipwrights, at that\r\ntime working hard by at Ratcliffe, having previously been compelled to\r\nleave the crowded part of the City by reason of the noise occasioned by\r\nexercising their trade and from fear of fire. The free shipwrights\r\nresented this treatment, and presented their case before the Court of\r\nAldermen. The City upheld the free shipwrights, and in 1620 their\r\nordinances were approved by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen.\r\n\r\nIn 1631, from continued opposition, their funds were reduced so low that\r\nthey were allowed to make twelve persons free of the City by redemption;\r\nand this number was from time to time increased. In 1638 another attempt\r\nwas made to free themselves from their rivals by representing their case\r\nbefore the King in Council, which resulted in their being granted by the\r\nKing exemption from the jurisdiction of the new Corporation. This order\r\nis dated Whitehall, March 17, 1638. In 1670 attacks were again renewed\r\non the free shipwrights by the new Corporation, and, their cases having\r\nbeen laid before the High Court of Admiralty by Charles II., the\r\nAttorney-General, on March 18, 1684-85, decided in favour of the\r\nCompany, which decision was approved by the King.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 a Livery was granted to the Company by the Court of Aldermen,\r\nthe number being limited to 100 and the fine to 15 guineas; in 1830 the\r\nnumber was increased to 200 and the fine to 20 guineas.\r\n\r\nTheir members now number 200. Their Corporate Income is £830. They have\r\nnow no Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Company had formerly a Hall at Ratcliffe Cross, in Butcher Street,\r\nbut it has long since disappeared.\r\n\r\n _The Skinners._ See p. 238.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SPECTACLE MAKERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by Charles I., 1629, for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 15\r\nAssistants. The Company is numerically very strong, the Livery numbering\r\n356. They have a Corporate Income of £1100, and a Trust Income of £45.\r\nThey have no Hall.\r\n\r\n _The Stationers._ See p. 199.\r\n\r\n _The Tallow Chandlers._ See p. 243.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TIN-PLATE WORKERS\r\n\r\nThis Company was incorporated by Charles II. in 1670 for a Master, 2\r\nWardens, and 20 Assistants. At present it has 80 members. There are no\r\nparticulars as to the Corporate Income, but there is a Trust Income of\r\n£7:7s.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Company is obscure. Hazlitt thinks that it was a\r\nbranch of the Girdlers, that it was originally the Wire Workers, and\r\nthat it may also have been associated with the Wire Sellers and the Wire\r\nDrawers. It has no Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE TURNERS\r\n\r\nIncorporated by James I. in 1604 for a Master, 2 Wardens, and 24\r\nAssistants, with a Livery of 144. At present there is a Livery of 193; a\r\nCorporate Income of £700; but no Hall.\r\n\r\nThe principal work of the Turners originally was to make wooden\r\nmeasures. It was therefore important that these measures should be true.\r\nIn 1310 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 78) six turners were sworn before the\r\nmayor and aldermen, that they would in future make no other measures\r\nthan gallons, potells (pottles, then a measure of two quarts), and\r\nquarts, and that they would not make false measures such as “chopyns”\r\n(chopines) and “gylles” (gills). In 1347 (Riley, _Memorials_, p. 234)\r\nsome turners were brought before the mayor and aldermen, charged with\r\nmaking false measures. Our earliest introduction, therefore, to the\r\nFraternity of Turners is not much to their credit. It is, however,\r\ngreatly to their credit that they now hold annual exhibitions of turnery\r\nwork in the City with prizes for its encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TYLERS AND BRICKLAYERS\r\n\r\nThis Company was incorporated by Elizabeth in 1568 for a Master, 2\r\nWardens, 38 Assistants, and 103 Liverymen. At present there is a Livery\r\nof 73; a Corporate Income of £610; a Trust Income of £170; but no Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Tylers were an ancient Fraternity dating from the time when tiles\r\nwere first employed instead of thatch for roofing houses. As bricks were\r\nnot used in English architecture before the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, there could have been no bricklayers. The connection of the men\r\nwho put on the roof with the men who built the house was natural.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE UPHOLDERS\r\n\r\nThis Company was incorporated by Charles I. in 1627 for a Master, 2\r\nWardens, and 28 Assistants, with a Livery of 131 members. At present the\r\nLivery consists of 20 members; they have a Corporate Income of £284; a\r\nTrust Income of £20; but no Hall. The Fripperers, Philipers, or\r\nUpholders were the buyers and sellers of second-hand clothes, fur robes,\r\nfurniture, and other things. There seems to have been a large trade of\r\nthis kind, chiefly in the parish of St. Michael’s, Cornhill.\r\n\r\n _The Vintners._ See p. 229.\r\n\r\n _The Watermen._ See p. 267.\r\n\r\n _The Wax Chandlers._ See p. 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE WEAVERS\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the oldest Gild of which we have historical\r\ninformation. The weavers included under one Fraternity, at first, all\r\nthe trades which belong to the manufacture and use of textile stuffs.\r\nThe history of the Gild is briefly but clearly told by Loftie in his\r\n_History of London_.\r\n\r\n“The weavers, again, by their superior wealth, and their superior\r\norganisation, were constantly exciting the envy, not only of other\r\ntrades but also of the city guild itself. They had taken care to obtain\r\nacknowledgment as early as 1130, when Robert, son of Levestan, who may\r\nhave been their alderman, paid 16£ into the treasury for them. They had\r\na charter, more or less formal, in which Henry I. enacted that no one\r\nshould exercise their trade in London or Southwark except he be a member\r\nof their guild. This was confirmed by Henry II. On the establishment of\r\nthe mayoralty the weavers had a narrow escape. In 1202 the citizens\r\noffered the king sixty marks to suppress the guild, but they had money\r\nas well as influence, and the king only renewed their privileges, while\r\nhe increased their annual payment. ‘Although,’ as Mr. Stubbs remarks,\r\n‘there is no positive evidence to connect them and their\r\nfellow-guildsmen with the factions of Thomas FitzThomas and Walter\r\nHervey, or with the later troubles under Edward I., it is not at all\r\nunlikely that their struggle with the governing body was a continuous\r\none.’ Edward gave them a charter so worded that they assumed powers of\r\nself-government, which the city authorities could not recognise, and in\r\nthe following reign a verdict against them was obtained after long\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\n“It was perhaps in consequence of this verdict that the old corporation\r\nof the weavers resolved itself or was divided by a higher power into its\r\nconstituent elements, and we henceforth hear of the drapers, tailors,\r\nand others, but no more of the weavers till long after. There is,\r\nhowever, absolute silence on the subject in the works of London\r\nhistorians. The phenomena are altogether peculiar, and but few facts can\r\nbe picked out as tolerably certain. The weavers touched on one side the\r\ntrade in linen, on the other that in wool. The woollen drapers were\r\nnaturally very much divided in their interests from the linen-armourers,\r\nand the tailors who constructed garments, as well from the vegetable as\r\nfrom the animal production, were distinct from those who wove the cloth.\r\nWe find, therefore, not only great dissension at times among the\r\nweavers, but a strong tendency to establish separate interests. The\r\ndrapers, under their Latin designation of _panarii_, very soon divided\r\nthemselves from the tailors, _cissores_; and, though there is no\r\nevidence of their separate existence before 1299, when the tailors’\r\nrecords commence, it is very probable that from time to time they both\r\nrebelled against the tyranny of the weavers. Certain it is, that this\r\npowerful guild, which had subsisted through all changes and chances from\r\nthe time of Henry I. at least, now suddenly and unaccountably\r\ndisappears; while from its ashes rise the tailors—to whom long after, in\r\nthe reign of Henry VII. the title of ‘Merchant Taylors’ was conceded—the\r\nclothworkers, at first ‘shermen’ and fullers, and the drapers, all of\r\nwhich preserve, more or less dimly, a tradition of their previous united\r\nstate of existence” (vol. i. pp. 168, 170).\r\n\r\nWas the old Gild of Weavers, that licensed by Henry I. and Henry II.,\r\nentirely dissolved in consequence of the many branches which broke off\r\nfrom the parent trunk? It would appear that since the Craft of the\r\nWeavers was one thing and that of the Drapers was another, the Gild of\r\nthe Weavers would still remain, in which case, though we cannot say that\r\nthe Company is the most ancient, it would be quite true that the Company\r\nis descended from the most ancient Fraternity known.\r\n\r\nIt has now a Livery of 106; a Corporate Income of £1067; and a Trust\r\nIncome of £1087. It formerly had a Hall in Basinghall Street. This was\r\ndestroyed in the Great Fire, and, though subsequently rebuilt, was\r\npulled down in 1856, when offices were built on the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE WHEELWRIGHTS\r\n\r\nThe Company was founded by a charter granted by King Charles II.,\r\nFebruary 3, 1670, in compliance with a petition presented by divers\r\nwheelwrights, in and near the City of London, praying that, as “certain\r\nforeigners undertake the profession and trade of a wheelwright,\r\nnotwithstanding they are ignorant and unskilful therein, and altogether\r\nincapable of making the works used in and about the said city, whereby\r\nmuch mischief happeneth to persons in the streets, by falling of carts\r\nand coaches, and great damage to merchants and others in their goods, as\r\nalso loss and danger to gentlemen occasioned by the ignorance and ill\r\nwork of the said foreigners, that never served to the said profession,\r\nand other great inconveniences and misdemeanours used and practised in\r\nthe said art and trade,” they might, for the prevention thereof, be\r\nincorporated into a body politic.\r\n\r\nAt present they have a Livery of 120; a Corporate Income of £300; no\r\nTrust Income, and no Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE WOOLMEN\r\n\r\nThe date of the foundation of the Company was probably about 1300.\r\n\r\nBy the 27 Edward III. c. 23, the Company had the right of appointing\r\nlicencemen to wind wools. The Company possesses a book of ordinances\r\nallowed and confirmed to the Company of Woolmen of the City of London by\r\nthe Lord Chancellor of England and the two chief justices of either\r\nbench in the year 1587. Sixteen of the ordinances regulate the election\r\nof the governing body and the clerk, etc. The Company also possesses an\r\norder of the Court of Aldermen for granting a Livery to the Woolmen’s\r\nCompany, and in the report made by the Committee of Privileges and\r\nsubsequently approved and confirmed by the said court. The Company has\r\nexisted under various names, such as Woolpackers, Woolwinders, and\r\nWoolmen; it was designated by all these titles in a proclamation of\r\nCharles II., but for the last three hundred years it has been known\r\nchiefly by the style of the Company of Woolmen.\r\n\r\nThe right of the Company to appoint and license duly qualified persons,\r\nhaving previously examined them, to wind wools has long ceased to exist;\r\nthe last person licensed was in the year 1779. By proclamations in the\r\nreign of Charles II., woolcombers were obliged to be licensed by the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Woolmen’s Company has the right to nominate to the\r\nCourt of Assistants of the Merchant Taylors Company two poor members of\r\nthe Company as pensioners under Vernon’s Charity.\r\n\r\nThe Company lost its charter and most of its documents in the Fire of\r\nLondon, when the Company’s Hall was burnt down.\r\n\r\nTheir members number 20. Their Corporate Income is £376; they have no\r\nTrust Income, and no Hall. Considering that the staple trade of England\r\nfor many centuries was that of wool, there can be little doubt of the\r\nextreme antiquity of this Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX II\r\n\r\n           MAYORS AND LORD MAYORS OF LONDON FROM 1189 TO 1900\r\n\r\n                        (LORD MAYORS SINCE 1354)\r\n\r\n\r\n 1189.

This college was known as St. Mary’s\r\n  College, and Erasmus himself, an Augustinian canon, lived there when\r\n  at Oxford. The fact that the Augustinian houses each sent one or two\r\n  of their own members as students to the university does not imply that\r\n  they kept public grammar schools or did anything for general\r\n  education.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  _Hist.
